"Mormon" question. Of course
(these are all handle J from a partisan

I""" t Tho recent letter of Wdford Wood ru AT,
president of the Mormon Church, in
which he advises his people to refrain
from contracting any marriage forhi J-
' den by the laws 6f the land, has at-

J cial in restraining infractions of

H ATAV There Is little to find fault with in
BBfl SwAV these remarks of the President's,
H B unless the view that wc think will

BBfl 1 of the last Sentence is correct. It
BBfl ' would appear from it that ssme-

BBfl j I the laws is required of the "Mor-
1 mon" people. It conveys the idea
BBJ that the belirf of citizens may form

BBJ tlou. It smacks of interference by
BBJ j the State with that which belong

croichcsupon tlie perfect freedom ol
hhj 1 faith which is guaranteed to all
BBM i people under our na'ioual system of
BBM j governmcnL And- it looks as il
BBM J doctrines may be nitaeked by tht
BBl m Government when practices are un-

BBj The demand that has been made
BBJ I upon tlie "Mormon" Church, it
BBJ 1 leaders and its people has been, all
H J f - nlong.sincethe nation hasattemplcd
BBJ I ' to interfere Willi them, "Conipl)

SECKErAKY OBLK OX "Jion
JIOV ilTAUW.
SEcnETAnY Kobix touched on
the "Mormon" question in mucli
the same minner as the President
does. Still he avoids tlie rock of
religious belief on which the Presi
dent runs headlong. He deals with
practices, and while ho does cot
sanction the measures proposed for
further assaults upon the "Slor
mons," he favors the retention of
the recent laws, so as to give time
to see whether the professions In re
gard lo those practices were made
in good faith. There is little to ob
ject to in these remarks, taking the
Secretary's position into considera
tion. Hut be mentions the fact that
"tlie revelation containing poly
gamy remains unchanged," a
though this was a matter with
which the Government had any
tiling to do. It has been alliged
against the "Mormon" Church that
it aet.ks to control the State. Pass
ing by tho untruthfulness of the
charge, is it any more proper for the
State to seek to control the Church?
Revelation, doctrine, principle,
creed are the peculiar province of
tlie Church. The Slate has no
powers in relation to them. The
Constitution forbids Cougiess to in
terfere with the "free exerUe" of
religion. The legislators and jurists
who have given the widest scoi e to
the powers of Congress in relation
to religious practices, have conced
ed that iu mttters of faith anJ wor
ship CongreeS Is entirely powerless.
Revelation may be believed in ad
tiitium while it does not affect tho
believer to the extent of infraction
of the secular law. If G-d givesa
revelation, God alone can change or
revoke it. If people believe God
lias given a revelation, they must
believe He has revoked it, before it
will be changed, in their unJcrstanJ
ing. If they determine to comply
with the laws of the land and do so
in good faith, their convictions uf
the rightfulness of their faith or of
the wrjngfulnes3of the law cannot
be lawfully called In question.
That the people of Utah have de
termined to comply with the laws
furbiJding polygamy we think is
beyond reasonable que-tion. If
their cuursa Is not yet sufficient to
convince the skeptical, wc think it
will da so in tints an I that even
Secretary Noble will bs compelled
to say It is eaoj ja.-"'
But he has some personal notions
repeciiug the parposa of the adop
tion of the declaration forbidding
polygamy. He sy3:
"What is expected because of these
procceil'cgs i, no doubt, a removal of
tho Utah Comm!sion: the preserva
tion of tho elective franchise to the
member of tho church in all the
States and Territories, w here they may
b9 end a test oath may bs required of
th?m; a restoruion of tho property of
the Cnurrh; an 1 posmbly the admis
sion or Utah to btalchood with or
without a tea oat h ag-M nst polygamy."
If these expectations entered into
the preparation an 1 aioptlon of the
manifesto, they are not known to
the people who participated in tlie
work. It Is all news to us. Wo
Itelieve it is so to our frieils in this
Territory. It is always unsafe to
hazard opinions about motives. The
Secretary of the Interior ins in this
departed from tho rightful do
main of fact an I law. and wandered
into the doubtful field ot mental
ieculaton. The '-Mormons" have
simply c-ad the practice of plural
inrriagij and made a r-u'ilic an
nouncement of the fact, as a submis
sion to las which havo been de
clared constitutional by the court of
lat resort. They have done to
without any defined expectation of
results.
I fatter nil this, tho dMrauchls
ment which has been threatened
against law-obeylug "Mormons"'
shall be effected, it will be proof be
yond question to the "Mormons"
that all the outcry ngainn polygamy
has been iii;!ncero,andxnadeto cover
1 deeper design which is political in
its ch-iract.T and wicked iu its pur
pose. We certainly hope that this
will not be accomplished, and wu
believe that hope is shared by the
"Mormon people geuerally.

HOTEL TEMPLETOX.

1 'Bank Mldft?
It Is announced, by advertise
ment In the Xcvvs, that the Hotel
Tempieton will be opened tomorrow,
December 3d, to receive guests. The
new building of Zlon's Saving
Bank and Trust Company, corner
of South Temple and Main streets,
is ono ot tho mo3t majestic struc
tures between the Missouri River
and the Pacific Coast, and Is an ob
ject of admiration with ail visitors
to our growing cily. Its site is all
that could be desired, being one of
the features that adapts it admira
bly for hotel purposes. From the
upper floors the view, which takes
within its scope the greater part of
the valley of the Great Salt Lake,
is magnificent.
The bjIIJIng Is sic stories In
height, exclusive of the basement.
Its design is strikingly handsome,
being in every respect abreast of tho
times. The building committee
acting for the comptny who own
the structure were Messrs. George
Q. Cannon, Thomas G. Webber and
James Jack, anJ it neud not be saiJ
that, no expense has been spared to
make It a "thing of beauty."
It lias been suggested that tlie
apartments in this Imposing edifice
are too large for hotel purposes. Of
course this remark has been offered
as a suggestion of doubt as to the
probability Of tbo enterprise being
conducted upon a paying basis.
The Unusually spacious character of
the rooms, however, render them all
the more attractive to guests and
makes their constant occupancy
more certain than would be the caso
if their dimensions were more con
tracted. Notwithstanding the fact
that the apartments are larger than
tlioto ordinarily to be found in bote's
the liberal proportions of the build
ing admit of their being quite nu
merous There are no fewer than
Mighty of thcni. The height from
floor to ceiling is as fallows: First

Sears & Iiiddlcsupplied tlie window
glasi and glazing. All of the glass
in the north and west fronts Is plate
throughout, and some of the win
dows are ornamented with beautiful
stained combinations.
The dining hall which Is in the
sixth ttiry, is a model of its kind.
It occupies the entire width of the
building, aud has a west nud north
front, being 4ix 70 feet. While tho
guests are engaged in d!poslngof
tlie good things the Utst obtain
able placed before them, they can
aid digestion by contemplating the
splendid prospect from the win
dows, out of which they will be en
abled to gaze in three directions, as
they may elect north, south or
west. The viands ore cooked on tho
same floor, tbo baking only being
done in the basement.
The furnishing ol the apartments,
which is beiug attended to by Mr.
Henry Dinwoodey, is nearly com
pleted, and everything in that line
is done with a view to a combina
tlou of elegance, comfort and con
venience. A great many visitors
have already called at the building
and have been loud in their praises
of evtrj tiling pertaining to the
hotel. To such an extent has the
fame of the house already spread
that the manager, Mr. Alonzo
Ycutig, has been plied thick and
fat iili applications for rooms. So
much has this been tho caso that
nqtmts of time-occupants have
bad to be declined in order that
fflce miht be reserved for transi
ent guests, whom it Is desired to ac
commodate. The house having machinery and
apparatus for the purpose, will sup
ply It o n lighting, which will I
done by electricity. In order to
avoid a catastrophe in case of a
breakdown in the source of supply
of tlie fluid, however, gas can be
turned ou in an emergency, all the
ceceary fitting being in position.
The latet return-call system has
also been introduced, so that when
n guest dignities by a touch of the
appropriate button that he needs the
iM-rvices of a metssace bov. h re
reives a respone by a signal which
informs him lie lias been heard and
his ants will be attended to.
Tho means or extinguishing flres
in their inciniency are complete
and ample. On each floor is a hose
and nozzle, capable of throwing a
respectable stream Upon any point
where it may be needed.
Fire escape facilities are of great
moment In l-irge structures such as
that now lielng described. Tills
necessity npi.lles perhaps with more
forcoto hotels than nny other estab
lishments In addition to the regu
lation escape, accessible from each
fl-wr, and which are in plain eight
from the exterior, the architect, Mr.
J. D. C. Young has introduced ade
vice of Ids own. It consists of a
square trap door In the floor of each
cnrrldorofthe five upper torie,one
directly overthe other. Upon these
is written fire-escape." The per

-r Pursuant to tho above request, a
argo? cumber of the taxpayers of
the Eleventh District met in the
sehoolhousc last evening. Alex-audtir,McMaste-r
was nominated as
chalrrhan nnd the business Immedi
ately proceeded with,
j By "Kouest. Attorne vSteDhens ex-
pretH-il tils view ef the subject in
tfiieitioii. In his opinion the tax
payetaliad an excellent case and he
liadbot tlio slightest doubt but that
the supreme Court would reverse
Judge Anderson's decision. He
said, further, inasmuch as ho him
self, and Mr. Schroedrr had con
ducted the caso thus far and lost it,
tiicy would now be willing to fight
it through at their own ex
rCM should tho Supreme
Ccnrtsuttaln J udgeAndersou's de
cision. More than this they could
not do. It would be necessary,
however, for all wishing to become
participants In the suit to appoint a
trustee ho having already been
selected who would file a bond fur
nil thu taxpayers and who would re-ce-lvvUheir
assessments pending a
leel-.ibn. The matter would be
crowded through with all possible
haste, that a deciion might be had
U urine tiie January term.
After some further butlness, a
vote was taken in which Jt was
unanimously decided to take au ap
peaL. Charles Livingston and Henry
Illingsworth was appointed as a
cuunmittce of arrangements nnd to
confer with all intertstrd parties.
