ap the President in his message quiu- prop
r-iy contented himself with merely calling
attention to this country's need of an elastic
currency without recommending auy specific
scheme, the formation <-f public and legislative
opinion upon this topic will be left to the de
bates of Congress, -l ne discussion will be lol
]ow<-d by the people and the ne-vspapers with
an attention never heretofore given to it. and
this we believe will have a fortunate result.
The session will be a campaign of education in
the principles of 6ouud currency. When it is
ever Congress and the public at large will have
tomethlng more than the hazy notions that at
present prevail, and many or the schemes that
are now put forward with confidence will have
been definitely discarded.
We Bee no reason to regret that action upon
the question will be slow. The longer the dis
cussion, tvttiiln reasonable limits, the better will
be the understanding of essential principles and
the more likelihood there will be that the step
finally agreed upon will b*« in the right direc
tion. That is the utmost that can be expected
from this single session, for the whole problem
of adjusting the nation's currency to serve best
the ends of business Is too complicated to be
' Mlved at once. If as a result of this session
the country shall have tamed its back upon its
old expedient of Inventing at each new emer
gency some new kind of money to coexist with
all the preceding kinds and shall face- In rhe
direction of Kich a credit currency as ••'.-•:
great commercial nations have found necessary
in their business, all will have been done that
can reasonably be expected. Tbe people will
-tben «- prepared for such subsequent steps as
are needed to give the country a Beniceabl©
' currency system.
v.'c en. not surprised that at the present time a
plan to authorize the Issue of additional national
t>&n«i cotes based en other bonds than United
Ftstes bonds finds considerable favor In Congress
bs a method of imparting "elastic! ry to the cur
rency. That plan would make no break with
the country's existing system of bond secured
currency. Such an innovation would not af
fright the most timid soul. But it Is open to
tbt; objection that the volume of bond secured
currency bears no relation to the country's
business, while the credit currency of other
nations sustains Just as close a relation to the
volume of business as the number of personal
checks la circulation does. .When business is
; brisk the credit currency expands In volume
305t as the private checks expand in volume.
■ad wbea busiiKSP declines the notes oome back'
| Into the banks just as the volume of private
checks falls off. It is because of this very
i quality of beiu? credit made current, and so
; ••orr«>itouding exactly to the volume of credit
; in ui-e. that tlit-se not*? of foreizn uations servo
i DMfr business needs sr> well. And it is beoau^
our bond secured notes bear n<. soeh relation to
! the volume of credit needed that they serve this
country's ueed* so badly. T" pn«vidi for_
i further hourt secured issaee is t<« perpetuate th*
, .}.. '■!'- of the existing system.
There are. perhaps, countries on tJjo earth
I v. li^re banking is very primitive and cheeks ar*
very little used in business, every transaction
j being conducted on a money basis. Obviously
[ in M*-b ecuntries business must be small and
caii be conducted only under difficulties. Bop

Behind nracticaily all <<f tbe President's rec
oinanrndiriimr stands the realization that regu
lation by the I jhiihiHj and for the community
is the surest means of curing the evils which
liavo sprunsr from 100 great an effacemerit of
tbe -t.u<> and 100 great an exaltation of the
freedom Of the individual. Thi« conception ac-
•ounis for his suprcestious as to the regulation
of r;:ili":ids and trusts, the enforcement on th«
employer of e.nlar^«Hl liability, the imposition
of income and bsherttaaoe taxes, the establish
ment of an eight-hour day for labor and the
many other curbs sought to b^ put on ultra
individualMle activity. In many of these ideas
the President is undoubtedly ahead of th<» aver
age thought of the day. and especially nbead of
it as ii is reflected in the two houses of Con
gress. it is unlikely that. Conjrress at this Bes
sion will undertake to put into effect any con
siderable pnrt of the President's programme. As
•we pointed out yesterday, the approach of a
IVesldeutial campaijm is generally construed
by Congress as a warnlrj*? signal against radi
| cal or extensive legislation. The majority in
; each branch will be strongly inclined to do only
I the urgent routine work of the fusion and then
force an early adjournment. We can 'expect.
perhaps, as we certainly hope, that n helpful
currency bill will paf*. but beyond that Con
<zr"±< will probably remain quiescent. T'iis
temporary non-action will not. however, impair
the vitality of the President's re-enunciated
policies. Those policies so closely concern the
nre of the nation that they will have to b"
! <te:i!t with sooner or later. They are for to-
I morrow as well as for to-day, and their im
portance will necessarily compel attention, even
tliough In passing on them the American people
may l>o expected to show the patience, caution
I and deliberation which have usually character
ized their treatment of fundamental problems
of government.
PRJUSSIA AMD HER POLES.
The Polish problem Involves less violence in
Prussia than in Russia, but is scarcely less vex
atious and serious. For more than a score of
years the Prussian government has been trying.
incessantly and strenuously, to Germanize the
Polish provinces of the kingdom, but in vain.
Since ISSG it has ei>ent $72,500,000 for the pre
motion of German colonization in those prov
inces, with the express object of "strengthening
the German element against the Polish." IVy
this means It has settled there 17,000 German
families, of which 12.000 are agriculturists and
f»,000 artisans, and has increased the German
population by from 135.000 to 150.000.
Tho weak feature of this work i< that :t
leaves the Poles actually stronger and mora
prosperous than before. The colonists have been
settled on land purchased not from Poles but
from Germans. The Poles would not sell.. Th.^
result is that the value of the Polish estates
has been much enhanced and Polish prosperity
has correspondingly increased. Therefore, the
government feels itself driven to the adoption
of more stringent merisures. It now proposes to
appropriate a further sum of 5100.000.000 for
the purchase of land for German settlers lv the
Polish provinces and to make sure that the
land thus used is secured . from Polish propn
etors. To that end it would enact an expropri
ation law. empowering It to take the land of any
Pole against his will, at a price arbitrarily
fixed by itself, for division among German set
tlers.
The proposal of this policy has raised s
Btorm of protests from the Prussian democracy.
It is pointed out that if the iand of the Palea
could thus be seized there would be nothing Lc
prevent a similar seizure of the land of any
body else, and in that state of affairs there
would be no encouragement for the Germans
themselves to acquire or To retain land. The
policy would restore the absolutism of feudal
times. The criticism is made that the Prussian
government is thus trying to solve the Polish
question by physical force, by tb« arbitrary
GermanLzatlon of the Poles, instead of trying
to understand the Poles and to make them,
though remaining Poles, loyal and contented
subjects of the Prussian Crown, as Great Rrit

ain has done with the French in Canada. The
criticism seems to hay* some foundation In
fact and reason.
-JAPANESE RELATIOyS.
The sumniouing of Baron Aoki to Tokio is
an interesting incident which may be auspicious
rather than ominous. It is declared to be in no
sense, ■ recall, and is not to be regarded as
euch. It Bignifics no suspension or change of
diplomatic relations between Japan and thu
United States, but rather a benevolent pur^e
to confirm them in their traditional friendliness.
It apparently indicates no dissatisfaction of the
Mikaflos government with its representative
here, but rather, probably, a high degree of con
fidence and esteem. Despite all modern de
vice* for expeditious and comprehensive com
njunii-ations at long range, nothing is equal in
authority and satisfaction to a face-to-face con
sultation, and that is what the Japanese gov
ernment desires to have with the Ambassador
to Hie United States.
It is ••minently desirable that all nations
sli.mld know in the most authoritative way the
r>iil sentiments of this country toward them —
that, to be specific. Japan shall know bow
friendly is the American disposition, despite a
few sporadic manifestations of intolerance, and
with wiiat » high degree of confidence the good
faith of Japan is regarded, despite the inter
ested and sinister outgivings of a few agitators.
Baron Aoki will report the facts in the ease,
and there is no reason to doubt that as a result
of his itersona] communications the government
at Tokio will be reassured of the friendliness
and good faith of America.
Tlfiv has been some talk about an attempt to
"fore*- tin- bund** of Congress into enacting jit.

THE TALK OF THE HAY.
A Nottingham miner has patented a gafrty pit
cage, which Consul Mahin reports is believed to be
a decided advanre on all its predecessors, both in
application and security. The consul thus de
scribes this new British invention: "It is etnt".l that
H can be applied to any kind of mine cage and ship
or passengtr elevator, and that it has the groat ad
vantage of being adaptable equally well to steel,
wood. rope, or any form of guides that may be in
use. The cage is fitted with sliding bars, each bav
ins; a gripping screw with a weight or spring at
tached by which the bars are coupled to the sui.les
should the hauling or winding rope break, and
without in any way damaging the guides. A par
ticular feature is the automatic gripping action
exercised on the guide ropes by the weight of the
cage itself an<V its immediate but gentle arrest in
the event of the breaking of the winding rop«-.
Thus, it is asserted, there can be. no severe jerk
on sudden stoppage, and no danger of the occn
pants of the cage being violently thrown apainst
the roof should an accident occur. With this sys
tem, it fs contended, the danger from accidents
by the breakage of winding and hauling ropes in
mines, elevators, etc Is minimised."

THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF FREE ART.
From Bulletin ot the American f-Yee Art Lea&ue
Our Ambassador a! tb< Court of S! James's,
Mr. Whitelaw Reid, who recently Kij;in-ii an ugi-ei

15 percent, never uttered a truer w.>rri than when
li<> sat«i: "I (irmly believe that for 11 nation whi<
wishex to ri ich the M..i:k.-. of Ihe world for th<
best, and therefore tin most profitable, things free,
art is i.s vit:<! as free air." 11.- based liis state
meat on tlw now well recognized prlnciplt that thj
artistic a; ■■: ihe, Ueautiful liuve .1 very appreciable
commercial value. The success of many French

A REASON WHY EGGS ARE HIGH.
From Tin Philadelphia Record
"When *%r* g*t in the neighborhood "t 4y <_«ni»

■•iv...ys want to know what the cause l», said ;i
New Jersey fanner to a Dock .str»-.t merchant the
other day. "They think we are trying to blf«-.i
tlv-ra. but if they really knew the trutk Uiey
wouldn't have much to Bay, I believe. Of
course, you fellows here on Dock street know the
<-3nse>. but the ordinary person doesn't. T.»o you
know why egga are scarce? It's not I ause the
hf-ns aro not working bj hard as usual. Some may
be taking a vacation. It's true, but It's Jtiecause the
farmers are saving their »'ggs for.inc.ibators. Aboui
this tim< of the year the poultry raUera coileot all
ri,,. fresh «-cgs they can and pile them into th«
patent sotting hens You ask ■.-,-. ru.v do this?
W«ll, It's a simple proposition. It takes thre»
weeks to the day for "B^s to hatch out. As soon

In winter to ketyp them warm, are fairly alive wiri,
the little fellows, and by stuffing them with corn
and whent we soon have chickens as big as squabs

blame tt] farmers for hoarding their egga when
you know the protit th-re is In broiler*. Then you
get as much a pound as you get for it dozen eggs

A PHASE OF MISS NIGHTINGALE'S WORK.
From Th«- Boston Transcript.
Speaking of Florence Nlghttagala and her efforts
to keep the world healthy, it seems pertinent to
niak>' special mention of her mission in behalf of
the open window at nisht. In the early years of
her labors much unintelligent opposition to this
method of ventilation, because of the supposed
harmfulness of night air. was expressed, but Miss
Nightingale had one stock argument in support of
her position. It being the question. "What air shall
we breathe at night but niijht air?" It waa un.in
•-weraWe from h*r opponents' point of view, even if
it did not always convert them. But it did lead a
r-ountleM number Into sn.ner ways of living «n<i
