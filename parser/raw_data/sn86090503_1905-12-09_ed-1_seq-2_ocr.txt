OFFICIAL PAPER OF SOCORRO C0D1TT.
1. . "?-B
SATURDAY, DEC. , 1905.
Socorro s airead v possessed
of as gd a telephone service as
any city in the land can boast of,
and she will soon be blessed with
a strictly up-to-date electric light
and power plant. The Gem City
has had a pretty hard row to hoe
for many years past, but she is
now beginning to feel the stimu
lus of more prosperous times.
Thk first issue of the Las Ve
tas Weekly News reached the
Chieftain office this week. The
News is edited by a news
paper man of a good many
years exeriencr, who affords in
this first issue of his paper the
best possible evidence that he
knows a god thing in the news
paper line when he sees it.
Tin: New Mexico School of
Mines, located at Socorro, is
second to no other educational in
stitution in the territory in
point of efficient, practical
service to young men in atten
dance. The School now has
more advanced technical students
than ever before. In fact, the
institution was never before in as
prosperous a condition in all res
pects as now, and thos; respon
sible for this pleasing state of af
fairs don't care who knows it.
It is estimated that by the
first of April of the coming year
New Mexico will contain over
3K),000 inhabitants, or a gain of
a!out M) per cent, since the 1900
census. Judging from as reliable
information as can be gathered,
this estimate is not overdrawn.'
So says the Santa Fe New Mexi
can, anu me iNew Mexican is in
a better position than any other
paper in the Territory is to have
accurate information on that sub
ject. Three hundred thousand is
a gratifying figure, but still there
is room.
aocoRKO, expects great goou
from Max Kirchman's Bohemian
colony project, and there is good
reason to believe that she wil
not be disappointed in her expec
tation. Mr. Kirchman is a sue
cessful business man and, natu
rally enough, he has undertaken
this enterprise in a perfectly busi
ness-like manner and apirit. lie
expects to add two or three thou
sand to the population of Socorro
county within the next five years
and especially to bring about
many improvements in conditions
in this city. lie has already
received and will continue to re
ceive abundant encouragement.
Tho.sk opposed to joint state
hood have repeatedly and post
tively asserted that those in fa
vor of that kind of statehood
are in a very small minority
while those in favor of joint state
hood have just as repeatedly and
just as positively asserted tha
those opposed are mighty sraal
potatoes and few in a hill. Now
however, President Roosevelt has
said in his message thathe isinfa
vor of joint statehood. Governor
elect ILigerman had already made
a similar declaration, and Dele
gate Andrews will at once intro
duce a joint statehood bill in con
gress. It is altogether possible,
therefore, that the people of New
Mexico and Arizona will soon have
an opportunity to count noses on
this important question, and we
hall then know where the ma
jority really lies.
Thk Fifty-ninth congress con
vened Monday noon. The ses
sion promises to be one of the
most interesting as well atone of.
the most important for years.
opular interest will doubtless be
centered mainly on legislation
ooking to the regulation of rail
road rates and the control of life
insurance companies, while mea
sures to promote the construction
of the Panama canal will hardly
be second in interest and impor
tance. The president will use
all his great influence, both poli
tical and personal, in behalf of
such legislation and the popular
sympathy which he already com
mands will be intensified by the
common conviction that he will
be opposed' by certain great but
unsavory corporate influences.
The proceedings of the session
will be intently noted.
Hon. Frank W. Parker, asso
ciate justice for the third judicial
district, can hardly escape re-ap
pointment at the expiration of
his present term of office. If the
hearty endorsement of the people
of the district is all that is re
quired he certainly can notescape,
for it is extremely doubtful
whether a baker's dozen of voters
could be found in the entire dis
trict who would not prefer Judge
Parker to anybody else for the
position which he has already
filled for two terms so acceptably.
The respect which Judge Parker
commands and the popularity
which is his are easily accounted
for. Everybody who has ever
come into contact with him in his
official capacity has been im
pressed with his ability, hisimpar
tiality, his sincerity, and his un
failing courtesy. These qualities
command respect and esteem al
ways, and at this particular time
they afford the best possible rea
son for the movement in favor of
the re-appointment of Judge
Parker.

Orip Quickly Knocked Out.'
'Some weeks ago during the
severe winter weather both my
wife and myself contracted severe
colds which speedily developed
into the worst kind of la grippe
with all its miserable symptoms,
says Mr. J. S. Egleston of Maple
Landing, Iowa. "Knees and
joints aching, muscles sore, head
stopped up, eyes and nose run
ning, with alternate spells of
chills and fever. We began us.
ing Chamberlain's Cough Reme
dy, aiding the same with a dose
of Chamberlain's Stomach and
Liver Tablets, and by its liberal
use soon completely knocked out
the grip." These tablets promote
a healthy action of the bowels,
liver and kidneys, which is always
beneficial wtien the system is
congested by a cold or attack o:
the grip. For sale by all drug

While King Alfonso of Spain
was riding with President Loubet
through the streets of Paris a
bomb was thrown at him. There
upon, says the New York Times,
the following discourse took
place:
"Whom are they after?" quer
ied the Spanish monarch.
And the president replied, in
the choicest Parisian:
"After you, my dear Alfonse."
SAMURAI AND JIU-JITSU.
Tha Moat Wonderful System of Ath
letics In tha World.
More than 2,500 years ago there
sprang into existence in Japan an
order of knights who were known
as the samurai. To them was
imparted all the learning, the po
lite breeding and the forms of su
periority that mark the gentle
man. They were skilled in arms
and versed in the arts of war, for
they were the emperor's fighting
men, and none but they were al
lowed to bear arms.
As there could not always be
war on hand, and as it was con
sidered beneath the dignity of the
samurai to go into any ordinary
callings, it came about naturally
that these little knights found
much idle time on their hands.
Being men of war, they turned
their attention to athletic feats.
One among the samurai con
ceived the idea of learning by
practice the location of every sen
sitive nerve and muscle in the
body. After that he discovered
all the joints of the bones that
could be seized in such a way as
to give momentary power over the
muscles of an adversary. He
practiced with his fellow samurai,
and thus by degrees was devel
oped the most wonderful system
of athletics known in the world.
The Japanese call this work
jiu-jitsu. The deft pressures ap
plied in the practice of jiu-jitsu
produce only momentary pain, but
do not really injure the muscles
or nerves. In all other things the
Japanese are the most polite peo
ple in the world. So it follows
that even in their fighting they
have developed a humane yet, ef
fective method of. self defense.
They do not strike out with the
clinched list and seek to bruise,
as do the Anglo-Saxons in their
boxing contests.
A knowledgeof jiu-jitsu enables
one almost instantly to convince
his opponent that it is useless to
tight. There are now schools of
jiu-jitsu everywhere in Japan
Every soldier, sailor and police
man is obliged to perfect himself
in the system. A Japanese po
liceman, possessed of the art, has
been known single handed to re
duce to submission and to take to
the police station four sturdy
sailors of a foreign Asiatic squa
dron. St. Nicholas.
A Cortain Cure for Croup.
When a child shows symptoms
of croup there is no time to ex
periment with new remedies, no
matter how highly they may be
recommended. There is one pre
paration that can alwavs be de
pended upon. It has been in use
tor many years and lias never
been known to fail, viz: Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy. Mr
M. F. Comptonof Market, Texas,
says of it, "I have used Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy in severe
cases of croup with my children
and can truthfully say it always
gives prompt relief." Sold by
all druggists.
Somewhat Different.
"This question whether a word
should have its adverbial or its
objective form seems to me to
have little to do with the sense
Now what is the difference be
tween talking loud and talking
loudly?"
No difference," replied the
pedagogical friend. "But look
Here: lor a large lee you give
advice freely, but you don't give
it free. I think that will retain
vou for a while."

Millions rush in mad chase af

would only eat good food, and

A NARROW ESCAPE.
Dramatic Climax to an Exciting Will
Contest Caae. '
The conversation turned óh th'é
momentous effects of trifles at
times when they were least ex
pected to have any influence at
all, and this reminded Mr.Tliómp
son of an episode in his own prac
tice as a lawyer.". . .
"It was the most cxcitríg7légal
battle of my life," he said, and
every one present begged him to
ten it. "; j
"A fight was going o'rt' for th?
possession of a large fortune,"
continued he, while the others
settled themselves for the storjV
"A wayward son'wasrcontestin
the will of his father, and the case
abounded in dramatic features?
Charge and counter charge" we're
frequent. The young man was
explosive, hot tempered and with
out character. How much his
family had suffered tlirougli 'him
no one ever knew. The, young
rascal had hoped to get. his;1 fa
ther's vast fortune, and now . he
saw the case going against" him
and the money slipping 'tttíróygh
his fingers. The last liutc'in the
chain of evidence was all that
was needed, and that would'- be
supplied by the testimony' of Jhis
sister. Her name was calledand
as she stood up she was; a beau
tiful creature there arose a buzz
of admiration such as sometimes
comes from an audience. She
flustered at that and Tiesitated,
then started for the . witness
stand. I got up as she was pass
ing me, intending to reassure her,
and accidentally stepped on her
gown. Gowns hadasligb'ttrain in
those days. My awkwardness
saved her life."
He paused for a moment to note
the effect of his words. "The
admiration of those in the court
room was the final touch, to that
wortniess orotner. tie .sprang
up and drawing a revolver from
his pocket, exclaimed, 'Well,' if I
. . ... - . . r
don t get tne money you never
will,' and fired at her as she came
toward him. My checking her
by treading on her gown made
her sfep backward, and the bullet
missed her by au inch;" Lippin-

Torture of a Preacher.
The story of the torture of
Rev. O. D. Moore, pastor of the
Baptist church of Harpersville,
N. Y., will interest you. He
says: "I suffered agonies, be
cause of a persistent cough, re
suiting from the grip. I had to
sleep sitting up in bed. ' I tried
many remedies, without relief,
until I took Dr. King's New Di
covery.for Consumption, Coughs
and Colds, which entirely cured
my cough, and saved me ' from
consumption." A grand curé for

"What are you doing with that
sheet of paper, Orville?" sharply
asked his wife.
"I am making a wish," answer
ed Mr. Meekun.
"A wish?" ...
'Yes, my dear. In your pre
sence I shall not presume to call
it a will."
A Humble Archbiahop.
Willegis, a famous . archbishop
of.Mentz, rose to that elevated
position from the very lowest
ranks. He was the son of a. poor
carter, but was nevéf ashaimed o
his parentage. He' not. only
caused the following inscription
to be placed conspicuously in his
palace, "Willegis, . remember thy
parentage,'.' but had the wheels
of a cart hungup'in the cathedra
of Mentz. From t.hat0ttinie..,to
this the arms of the .see-. ;have
borne the figure of a cart-wheel.
