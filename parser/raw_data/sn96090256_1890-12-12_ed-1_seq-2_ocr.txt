SOUTH DAKOTA
The Huron papers say that there is
considerable interest manifested there
in the official canvass of the votes cast
in South Dakota, at the late election,
had in Pierre,Dec. 4. We have had no
news of tho result of the canvass, but
there is little probability that any ac
tion will be taken that will change re
suits already announced.
A Sioux City Journal special of Dec.
3, says:—All the members of the state
canvassing board, which meets at Pierre
to-morrow to canvass the result of the
late election, have arrived. The board
will be composed of Gov. Mellette,
Judge Corson. Sucvetary Bingsrudaud
Auditor Taylor, who will make the
canvass in the presence of Attorney
Gen. Pollard and Lieut.-Gov. Fletch-
er.
Indians rannot vote. The recent
amendment was mi necessary. In vol
ume 112 of tli'! United Slates report,
page 94, the .Supreme Court of the
United St Hits hold* that an Indian
born a member of oho of the lndiiin
tribes within the United States, which
tribe still exists and is recognized by
the government of the United States,
is not a citizen of the United States.—
Yunhton I'IVSS and Dakoian.
The Westing ton Springs True Re
publican, remarks that "Or. Clougli
managed the campaign admirably."
This is the first intimation the STAR
has had of the admirable management
of the campaign. Not one public
state republican speaker visited this
county. The democrats sent Bartlett
Tripp here, while the independents had
three slate speakers in the county dur
ing the campaign.
The mission of the Iri.sh envoys in
America has suddenly come to an end.
After reading the result of the test
vote in the Parnellite meeting in Lon
don, O'Brien and Dillon decided that
their presence was urgently needed in
Ireland, and have cancelled their en
gagements for Kansas City, St. Louis,
Omaha and other points, and will leave
for Paris immediately. The remain
der of the party will sail, Saturday, for
Liverpool. Old Ireland stands by Par
nell, and repudiates the Chicago man
ifesto of the envoys.
The following ordinance will be
presented to the Lead council at the
very next meeting: "Be it ordained,
etc: Sec. 1. That any person wrong
fully appropriating any newspaper
left in the doorway of a business house
or dwelling shall lie deemed guilty of
misdemeanor. Sec. 2, Any person
guilty of such misdemeanor shall upon
conviction thereof be fined for the first
offense one hundred dollars and one
month in the county jail. For the sec
ond offense he shall be hung by the
neck until dead."—Deadwood Tintes.
The Pierre Capital of Dec. 2, in an
editorial way, thus expresses himself
in regard to Elder Cressey's mission to
this state. It seems his mission was
not beneficial to Mr. Moodv as it was
intended to be. E. T. Cressy, who has
been in this state some weeks laboring
in the interests of the re-election of
Moody to the United States senate
showed poor judgement and a lack of
good political sense by expressing bis
opinion so freely on the capital ele&
tion. Had he confined himself to facts
it would have done Moody's cause Ie:s
harm, but even then it would have
been a mistake. When Cressy stated
that 12,000 fraudulent votes had been
cast for Pierre he knew that the state
ment was a falsehood. He knew—if
he has any political sense whatever—
that the friends of Pierre would resent
such scurrilous statements. Neither
Cressy's former reputation nor his
present campaign will materi illy in
crease Moody's chances for re-election.
The Sioux City Journal of yesterday
morning, Dec. 4, prints an excellent
letter from the pen of Col. E. E. Clough,
which tells of the efforts put forth to
build 'he home, and the benefits to be
derived from it ft will be remember
ed by our citizens that Col. Clough was
elected president of the board of com
missioners at their list meeting in this
city, and in choosing the Sioux City
Journal for the publication of bis let
ter he exhibited praisworthy discern
ment. Tbe Journal during the Indian
fiasco has shown that it appreciates the
position in which South Dakota has
been placed by the slanderous stories
of "warlike" correspondents written
for easten. papers, The-Journal has
been rather conservative and is in
elined to allay rather than promote
the excitement of settlers and their
eastern friends. Its reports have been
the most reliable, if not the most blood
curdling, and tbe people of South Da
kota should appreciatotbu and always
have a warm place in weir hearts for
the Sioux City Journf
TIIE MESSAGE.
Congress having duly assembled and
the President having submitted his
annual message, it is presumed that
it is generally read by the masses of
people. The following comment* of the
Pierre Capital concisely sums up the
contents, and voices the general
opinion of the public on the im
portant'document "The president's
message is an able document, though
conservative. It is republican to the
core and treats in a sensible common
sense way all the important questions
that concern the g. vrntiietit. He
pives a careful resume of our relations
with foreign countries. Evidentlv
reports about our national treasury lie
ing empty were false. The message
sets forth the fact that the revenues of
the government from all source* exceed
the expenditures by $105,000,000.
There is a surplus in the treasury,
partially estimated, is 152,000,000. The
wilt* department gets but slight at
tention. The beet sugar industry is
deemed worth of attention. The Mc
Kinley bill is in(liiv«ed, and reciprocity
is earnestly recommended. The
president urges t'.:e passage of
several important laws by the fifty
first congress. The election law* get.
more attention than nnv other subject.
His remarks ave so opportune on this
all important question that no one
should fail to read them. Altogether
the president's message is just such a
document as we would expect from
such a careful painstaking president
as President Harrison. Every sentence
bears the mark of thoughtful,
consideration."
STATE CANVASSING BOARD.
The State Canvassing board met yes
terday at Pierre to canvass tbe vote of
November 4. The approximate plu
rality for Mellete is 11,00!) congress
men 8,000 state officers, 14,000 The
Majority for Pierre is about 7,000
against increase of debt, 88,000 against
woman suffrage, 24.000, in favor of
Indian suffrage, 6,000. This latter vote
is the most astonishing thing ever to
lie immagined,and the first thing to be
done by the legislature is to correct it.
Tbe blind way of printing the tickets
is alone to blame. South Dakota
cast 77,500 votes. It is making a very
dispassionate statement when the Rec
ord claims that 77,450 votes would
have been cast against Indian suffrage
had the question been presented in
telligibly to the people. And even
now.its no sure thing that rattle brain
ed or ignorant precinct election clerks
hav'nt counted the ballots wrongly.—

A Library Building.
Siorx FALLS, Dec. 5.—The county
commissioners this afternoon accepted
tbe proposition of J. M. Bailey, Jr., for
the sale of the county lots on Ninth
street for the purpose of building a
free library structure to cost $20,000.
The lots are sold for $12,000 at a virtu
al sacrifice, and the work will at once
begin in the construction of the build
ing. Mr. Bailey has donated a library
containing 2,000 volumes lor use in
the building. This is the same library
that is now being devoted to the use of
the public by Mr. Bailey in the Metro
politan block.

MAY LOOSE 10,000 ACRES.
PIKRRK, S. D., Dec., 3,—Tbe state of
South Dakota is liable to loose some
40.000 acres of land granted by tbe
general government. The register and
receiver of the Pierre land office
today received a decision rendered by
the United States Land Commissioner
Goff in the matter of state indemnity,
school lands. In accordance with the
enabling act tbo legislature ordered
Land Commissioner Parker select
the school lands. These altogether
amount to about seventy
tiiousand acres. Commissioner Parker
wanted these from this district, but
the application is denied by the
general laud This means that
tbe state shall select the indemnity
lands in the districts in which they
occur. In the Huron, Aberdeen, and
Pierre districts sufficient land remains
to provide for this, but in the Water
town and Yankton districts none of
these lands remain and forty thousand
acres may be lost. The cause will be
appealed to the secretary of the In
terior.—Chicago Inter-Ocean.
POOR SOCTO DAKOTA.
Poor, helpless South Dakota, the
Cinderella of the states, upon
whom her sisters have inflicted
every possible wrong, slight and in
sult that malice could suggest or
envy devise how soon will she re
cover from the blighting influence
of this latest slander?
Her lands have been pronounced
a desert, while they were filling the
granaries of the world her climate
represented artic in severity at the
very seasons when soft Pacific
winds and cloudless skies were
cheating winter of half his reign.
Her people, because a few lunatics
have escaped eastward, have been
styled a commonwealth of cranks.
She was for years denied the right
of statehood, she has for years
paid exhorbitaut tribute to the
loaners of eastern money, while
last year, her crop failure, not
greater than that which was exper
ienced in other states, was magni
fied, in part throngh the folly of
her own people, into dire disaster.
And so it has gone, Dakota, South
Dakota especially, has evidently
been singled out as the target of
the eastern press, and the cynosure
of sectional jealousy in every part
of the land. The result is that im
migration is retarded and capital
which "would find most remunera
tive investment in mining, stock
raising, irrigation projects, manu
facturing and other pursuits is di
verted from the str.tc. This is the
motive for the slanders this fact as
well as the love of sensationalizm
accounts for the magnified Indian
scare reports. Every settler who
is restrained by tear from entering
South Dakota, may locate in Illin
ois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas or Ne
braska, or he may even be induced
to remain in abject poverty at
points further east. The press of
the state must expose these false
hoods and denounce their authors,
To accomplish that end a liberal
and hearty support must be extend
ed. YVe have nothing to hope
from outside papers we should find
no further bounty for them.
These efforts, supplcme: ted by a
fair degree courage upon the
part of the settlers, will in a meas
ure overcome the evil effei t* of our
recent malign advertising, unless,
as now seems evident, the troops
now afield arc "bound to have an
Indian war, anyway."
A great Indian outbreak without
an ounce of blood spilled, an ax
lifted or a rifle discharged is an an
omaly, and the sooner this massa
cre of facts ends, the better for
South Dakota "Rapid City Rc
publican.
FltKE IIOMGS.
There arc a number of impor
tant measures to coma before con
gress at this session. One of par
mount importance, which shculd
receive attention at once, is a law
providing free homes for all per
manent settlers on the recently
opened Sioux reservation. It is
only just to the settlers now living
on the reservation as well as to those
who will hereafter seek homes
there that such a law be passed.
The passage of such a law would
be of great benefit to thousands of
poor people who are seeking per
manent homes but are too poor to
pay $1.25 per acre for the land.
It is a noteworthy fact that the
pioneers of any new country suffer
more hardships and endure more
privations than the generations
that follow. As a recompense for
these privations the government
can well afford to give 160 acres of
land to every settler who will build
a home, cultivate the soil and live
thereon five years. It has been
the policy of the.government hith
erto when opening public lands to
settlement to give free homes to all
persons desiring to make perman
ent homes on such lands.
In view of the fact that the re
publicans will be in a minority in
the fifty-second congress it stands
them in hand to secure all the leg
islation possible during tbis session
for the northwest. It is a well
known fact learned from sad exper
ience that a democratic congress
will not legislate for the northwest.
South Dakota needs this law. The
settlers on the reservation deserve
it. Can we not have it. Our rep
resentatives in congress could do
the state no greater service than to
secure the passage of such a law.
We shall look to see our United
States senators and representatives
to put thefr heads together and se
cure the passage of this law.—
Pierre Cadital.
Lasd for Indian hiklrea.
A Pierre special of the 6th inst says:
"The United States land commissioner
has just sent along decision to special
Indian agent Norville, at this point,
the effect of which is, that the children
of Indian parents can take up lands
separately from their parents, and that
they are not obliged to live upon the
land: Also children of mixed blood
stand upon tbe same footing as full

Quite at random I made up a list of
articles to whieh the English assign
aamea differing from those we'use:
That whieh wet eall a bowl is here
known as a basin. In England you ask
for a basin of bread and milk.
That whieh is known to us aa a pitcher
is here called a jug.
A donkey here is called atnokei in
America a moke is a negro. Local slang
tor a cab-horse is "cat's meat," because
the meat of horses is peddled around
the streets for feeding to cuts. By the
way, British cats average much larger
than our American cats, and they are
notorious chicken-killers. The brindle
eat seems to tbe commonest.
What we call crackers aro here called
biscuit, and 1 suspect that thia ia strict

What we eall ahoes are here known
as boots, and what wo call boots are
here known as bluchers.% There is ono
shoe called the hilo, because it runs
high from the heel up back of the ankle
and is cut low in front.
Our druggist is hero a chemist, many
of tho older practitioners retaining the
old spelling—"ehymist."
What we call alo is here Ithownas
bitter beer.
What is hero known aa a hash we
should call a stew, and what we eall a
hash is here known aa a minee.
In England our overcoat becomes a
great coat, our undershirt becomes a
vest, and our drawers becomo panta
loons. It is said that when George \V.
Childs, of Philadelphia, was in I«ondon
a numlier of years ago he walked into a
haberdashery, and, seeking to appear to
bo a native, asked to be shown the
styles fa silk waistcoats. "Jeotnes,"
cried the proprietor to his assistant,
"step this way and ahow this Hameri
can gentleman our flowery weskits!"
What we call sick the Englishman
calls ill sickness here implies nausea
and vomiting. Tho British usage ia
wrong but tho late Richard Grant
White settled the point pretty definite
ly. How carao the British to fall into
this perversion? It was, I think, be
cause tlio British can go nowhere except
by water that travel by water induces
unpleasant symptoms of nausc-a and
retching, which condition, called sick
ness, gradually came to lio regarded as
tbo correct definition of tho word sick
ness. I can't imagine how the British
justify their use of the ids homesick,
heartsick and lovesick.
lloro they Call a streetcar a tram
correct. Here, too, an elevator is a lift,
and that is right.
What we'call a telegram is hero called
a telegraph it will probably never be
determined which of these usages is the
better. Our postal-card is here a post
card Cuffs become wrists.
That material known to us as canton
flannel is here called swan's-down, and
our muslin is known hereabout as
calico.
Our locomotive becomos engine, and
our conductor is here a guard.
What we call stewing (culinary term)
tho British call simmering our lunch
is hero a luncheon, and our baggage be
comes luggage.
Oar wheat is called corn, and our corn
is called maize, or sometimes Indian
corn. Pigs' feet are called trotters. By
tho way, a theatrical name for a bad
actor Is rotter.
A "chill'' is hero called a "rigor," and
tho eruption commonly. known among
us as "hives" is here known as "nottle
rash." Candy is variously known as
"sweets," "sweetmeats" and "lolly."
Writing to John Smith, your social
equal, you are expected to address him
as John Smith, Esq. if ho bf your
tailor, grocer, etc., you address him as
Mr. John Smith.
The word "apt" is exceedingly popu
lar here. It la "apt to rain," "apt to be
muddy," a man ia "apt to go down
town," a bank ia "apt to suspend," etc,
Even tho best prints use thia word af a
synonym- for "likely" and "like."
Another barbarism everywhere preva
lent in the United Kingdom is tho use
of tho adverb "directly" for tho con
junction "as soon aa"—e. g., "directly he
went out I shut tbe door." Charles
Dickons, who was quite slovenly at
times, seems to havo been addle tod to
tbis indefensible viee.
Wbat docs this British word "left
tenant" mean? I should like to know.
"Quite" is another hackneyed word
here it ia edged in upon every occasion.
Tbe first criticism 1 would pass upon
the press of London would bo for the
indirectness of its speech. When a
newspaper writer wishes to convey tbe
idea that yesterday was a pleasant day,
ho saya: "Yesterday waa not .an 1
pleasant day." A good play is "not
half bad," a humoroua apeech la "not
unrelieved by wit," a riotously ap
plauded address is "not wLol'.y unao
cented by demonatratlons of approval,"
