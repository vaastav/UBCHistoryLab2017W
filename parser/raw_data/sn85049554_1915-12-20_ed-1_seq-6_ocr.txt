A Friend's Greeting.
I'd like to 4e the sort of friend that
I you have been to me,
I I'd like to be the help that you've
been always glad to be,
I'd like to mean as much to you each
minute of the day
As you have meant, old friend of mine,
to me along the way.
I'd like to do the big things and the
splendid things for you,
To brush the gray from out your skies
and leave them only blue
I'd like to say the kind things that I so
oft have heard
And fee! that I could rouse your soul
the way that you've stirred.
I'd like to give you back the joy that
you have given me,
Yet that were wishing you a need I
hope will never be
I'd like to make you feel as rich as I,
who travel on
Undaunted in the darkest hours with
you to lean upon.
and I'm wishing at this Christmas time
that I could but repay
A portion of the gladness that you've
strewn along my way.
And could I have one wish this year,
year, this only would it be
I'd like to be the sort of friend that you
have been to me.

JUST A MATTER OF PATIENCE.
Des Moines is viewing with disgust
the number of packages of Christmas
booze that arrive by express. It is
noted that one shipment of over 400
packages arrived In one day.
What of it? And why not? Des
Moines, of course, could
not
the
expect
that closing saloons would stop the
thirst of
graduated boozeflghters
who esteem a Christmas drunk a per
sonal liberty and a great joy. And
counting Des Moines' hundred odd thou
sand inhabitants, 400 packages of booze
isn't much. Also Des Moines need not
worry overmuch about the quality of
the squirrel whiskey that
these
fellows
are getting. That's their lookout. If
they skin the linings off their stom
achs it only means fewer packages
next Christmas when many of them
will have gone where the craving for
logwood and tobacco juice and prune
juice doesn't affect them. About so many
will get the stuff, about so many will
get drunk and be thrown into jail or
buried from the hospitals and the like.
Nobody can stop the real and geunine
boozer who prides himself upon his
degradation. He must go on to the
finish, with rare exceptions.
The point is that thousands of men
are better off because the saloons are
prone, not that certain whiskey suicides
are committing hari kari with squirrel
whiskey. And, at that, they axe not
getting much faster results than they
might get with Somebody's Ten Year
Old. There's headache and poverty
and heartbreak and death and murder
in it all whether it was made in a
cellar in Kansas City or in a private
distillery down in Kentucky.
Des Moines will just have to lef
them go. They are on their way. It's
only a question of time and not a long
time at that. It is a question of wait
ing until the poison works. That

all.
WHEN WE WENT TO TOWN IN BOBS.
Pretty sharp weather this, with the
mercury flirting with zero and the crisp
snow crackling under foot, pretty brisk
weather, but Christmas weather, the
old fashioned kind of Christmas
weather that was favored when we
were boys and girls.
Times change, however. In those
older days snow at Christmas was con
sidered a trade necessity. Nowadays
good sharp weather with dry roads are
the hope of the merchandizes People
do not change much except as they
adapt themselves to the progress of in
ventive advancement hut the automo
bile has changed the ideas of merchan
disers from "good sleighing" to good
automobile roads.
In those old days it was a day's
journey to the big town with a span
of Morgan bred horses ami the bob
sleds.
If you remember we took the wood
rack off the bobs, cleaned the snow out
of the wagon box and put that on the
sleds, filled the box with clean oats
straw, piled in three or four buffalo
robes and a quilt or two as a prelimin
ary. Then after the team had been
hitched and the crowd was ready we
carried out the bricks and the big

the cook stove oven and wrapped them

the hard work of summer were keen
to be off. They "nearly pulled your
arms off." The runners sang of Christ
mas upon the hard packed road. The
breath of the horses changed to rapid
puffs of steam and that of the pas
sengers gathered In white fllligree upon
the heavy buffalo where it was drawn
up close about their shoulders. A cold
day but a merry one. The younger
boys pleading cold feet got out to run
behind the sled and the driver slipped
away from them by a simple loosening
of the reins for no boy was ever born
who could keep his place with old Bet
and Fan when they had their heads.
40*
A.
How th^y begged before they were
permitted to catch the"-®nd -board and
pull themselves in. How they panted
and their eyes shone and they cuddled
down under the robes warm, full
blooded and happy. There was lots of
fun going to town in a bobsled those
days.
Still and cold the fields stretched away
on either side spotted with the- cattle
stringing out from the straw stack to
the cornstalks. The smoke from the
farmstead chimneys stood straight as
an iron bar toward the zenith. The
willow hedges were marvels of frosted
beauty. And in the cold silences the
sleighbells rang keenly musical jls we
went to town In the bobsled.
Every generation hW. its pleasures.
We are past the bobsled era. We run
out the six cylinder, fix the chains and
set side curtains. We whirl at railroad
speech to the town thirty miles away
and looking at our watches pleasantly
remark that we took an hour and ten
minutes to cover the distance. The
buffalo robe has gone with old Bet and
Fan but there is plenty to keep us
warm. And arrived we buy "nick
nacks" for Christmas that mother
would have held up hands of holy
horror over when we went to town in
the bobs. Still -we haven't changed
much. We are the same folks with
the same ties and the same affections
and impulses. The boy that drove the
auto is as good a boy as he who
tooled old Bet and Fan and the rest of
the folks are like those who sat under
the buffalo robes of another genera
tion.
It doesn't matter so much how we
go as thkt we go together. Not the
bobs and the horses and the rushing
cars matter but the folks they carry,
And men and women and families are
the same and the children laugh and
the young folks smile and love rides
across the miles in an auto as 1t used
to do when we went to town in the
bobsled.
THE BUSINESS FIELD.
In contrast to the usual experience
at this season, there is no general lull
apparent in the commercial world.
December, with its preparations for
inventorying, is, ordinarily, a month of
diminishing activity, except for the
holiday trade yet in the present In
stance the tendency is steadily toward
expansion rather than contraction.
This fact is made clear not only by the
tenor of advices from all leading cen
ters, but also by the statistics of bank
exchanges, which measure business
volumes. Thus, clearings at the prin
cipal cities this week were 64.0 per
cent in excess of last year's, and 39.8
per cent larger than in 1913. while
payments outside of New York showed
gains of 29.4 and 20.5 per cent, re
spectively.
1
Why so much. fuss over the pack
ages thus sent in? If all the booase
and beer shipped in to Individuals
were placed beside the amount of drink
the saloons purveyed in one day it
would be as gills are to gallons. Why
so much worry over the old soaks who
will drink anything from Jamaica
ginger to sulphuric acid? Why not
more joy over the fellow who has quit
and who is paying for real coal in
stead of slack, getting groceries on
time where he couldn't have got trust
ed for a plug of tobacco and whose
family is looking forward to a real
Christmas?
Moreover, other barometers reflect
the same trend, gross earnings of rail
roads reporting for the first week st
December disclosing an increase of 15.6
per cent over 1914, and it is significant
of the remarkable improvement in the
position of the transporting companies
that these interests continue to make
provision for needed equipment and
extension. In view of the frequent
complaints of shortage of rolling stock,
however, the accumulation of about
3S.000 in the number of idle freight
cars last month is considered surpris
ing. Further light on the enormous
traiTic movements is shed by the most
recent returns of foreign commerce,
merchandise exports from the thirteen
principal customs districts last week
being valued at fully $98,400,000—a
total only slightly below the high rec
ord attained in the third week of Oc
tober.
Holiday demands are exceeding ex
pectations in the dry goods markets
and the trade is ra-uch encouraged by
the developments in this quarter.
Owing largely to tb- firmness of raw
materials and the seriousness of the
dyestuffs situation, prices are steadily
advancing and Jobbers generally re
port satisfactory profits for the half
year ending Dec. 1. Salesmen return
ing from their territories In the south
and middle west tell of a volume of
business far in excess of. last season
and prospects are for even heavier
trading during the late winter and
early spring months. In all lines
prices are strong, with an upward ten
dency, due to the steady advance in
leainei. The latter continues active,
tho some branches of the jobbing trade
are commencing to feel the effects of
the approach of the holidays and in
ventory taking time. Thmout the en
tire market the statistical position
favors holders, as many buyers, not
withstanding recent liberal purchases,
are short of goods.

TIMES-REPUBLICAN, MARSH ALLTOWN, IOWA: DECEMBER 20,1915.
Topics of the Times
The town of Manning has broken
into the lime light with promised per
mits for the saloon after Jan. 1. How
ever it is going to be pretty hard to
establish a "state of Manning", now
adays. Dubuque made it once but that
was a long, long time ago children.
The Washington Press is encourag
ing Clifford Thorne to run for con
gress. The state would hate to loose
Mr. Thorne from his present efficiency
on the railroad commission but Clifford
would make a mighty good Iowa con
gressman. And the First needs a good
congressman.
The present administration sheds
ultimatums as easily as it rained last
June and July.
The selection of St. Louis as its con
vention city is a death blow to any
hope that the party would favor na
tional prohibition. It couldn't be done
in St. Louis and any delegate get away
uninjured.
Perhaps if we had that army of a
million men and a navy big as all out
doors we'd be a little less prolific of
ultimatums. As it is an ultimatum

IOWA OPINION AND NOTES.
"The young man's first mild worry
over Christmas is, what does she want?
His second and great worry is, how to
get it," reminds the Hampton Chronicle.
"An optimist," says the Sioux City
Journal, "is\. saloon man who thinks
the Iowa supreme court can be In
duced to invalidate-the Clarkson law."
"People who are complaining 'be
cause President Wilson's message to
congress is tame never had the oppor
tunity to find fault on that score with
any of the messages of Roosevelt,"
says the Webster City Freeman
Tr«»une-,
fJU&S
The Iowa Otty Anoan inquires,
"Which is the better—the republican
method or pavtog as go and laying
up a surplus or the free tra'de method
of squandering all along-the line and
of soaking the people, for more taxes."
"A congress perpetually in session
will mean that the American idea of
government is a failure," declares the
Iowa City Citisen.
"If we have statutes that are blue
laws why are they not repealed?" de
mands the Carroll Herald. "Every law
should be enforced, and, if we have any
that are not suited to present day con
ditions, they should be repealed."
Says the Waterloo Times-Tribune:
"Speaking about bartenders taking up
farming after Jan. 1, they ought to be
a success at raising corn, rye and
hops."
Iowa Newspapers
ANOTHER "GREATEST?"
[Traer Star-Clipper.]
We believe Orange township, south
of Waterloo, is the most progressive
rural community in Iowa. It has a
township hall, where public jpeetings
of all kinds are held, a $30,000 church,
has voted taxes for a central high
school and is about to hold a farmers'
institute that will be attended by ten
times as many people as ever go to
such meetings in Tama county. It
comes Dec. 21 to 23. They must have
a peculiar breed of farmers over in
Orange.
TO fTUiMfMTNiST ADVANTAGE.
[Des (Moines Register.]
One of the embarrassments in nam
ing so early a date as June 7 for th*
republican national convention was the
June 6 primaries in West Virginia and
South Dakota.
But it develops now that the South
Dakota law contains a saving clause
permitting a primary election on April
1 and it is announced that the earlier
date will undoubtedly ibe chosen.
The advantage to the Cummins cam
paign of an earlier primary hardly
needs pointing out, for 6outh Dakota
in the Cummins column in April will
mean many times what Soutb Dakota
in the Cummins column on the eve of
the convention would mean.
The advantage of position in the
early primaries of the middle west is
only emphasized by this change, and
it is an, advantage that will ie more
apparent as the miowestw"
begin to be held.
way. Of course, the expert will have
to be paid. Some local man might
have been willing to give the required
advice gratis. And It might have been
good. And again It might have
worked great damage to those parks,
of' which the handsome city is Justly
proud. It would pay many of the Iowa
towns to follow Charles City's exam
ple in this matter.
THE DIFFERENCE. ft
[Perry Chief.]
The man who enjoys seeing some
other man have trouble Is taking con
siderable Interest in the controversy
between "Attorney General Cosson and
Attorney Odle, of Des Moines. Mr.
Cosson is something of a reformer but
Odle goes him a few better in the re
form line. Cosson wants to rid the
state of crooks and Odle wants to ap
ply the blue laws. Most people look
upon the work of the former with
favor and of the latter with disgust.
NO BOND ISSUE FOR DEFENSE.
[Sioux City Tribune.]
It is announced that democratic
members# of congress are already
weakening in their purpose to meet
the increased expenses of the govern
ment, due to the preparedness pro
gram. by special direct taxes and are
giving more consideration to the idea
of a bond issue.
This is political cowardice. It is'fear
to look facts in the face. It Is listen
ing to the protests of Interests which
frant greater national defenses and
would be safeguarded by them, and
yet are not willing to pay for their
increased Insurance. It is shoving th«J
entire cost of national preparedness
onto the shoulders of the working and
salaried -classes. for

HINDSIGHT AND FORESIGHT.
[Burlington Hawkeye.]
Charles City has secured a tree ex
pert from Minneapolis, to advise her
with regard to the planting of trees in
her parks. This town of 6,000 people
has three large paries with a total acre
age of 105. There must have been
some far-seeing folks in that town, in
her earlier days. For it I» but a short
time since people in most Iowa towns
considered parks a useless fad. The
whole out-of-doors was a great park,
and the people could picnic almost
anywhere. Now. that -'everything is
fenced up and all the best p«r» sites

THEE LITTLE JOHN DOES.
PMason City Globe-Gazette.]
Little John Bollinger, of Chicago, is
dead, and a whole nation is stirred up
about it. His physician and his mother
agreed that death for him would be
better than life, because life would
have meant both Idiocy and pain. The
doctor figured, too, that the little fel
low dead would be a greater asset to
society than tile little fallow living
for defective children are both a bur
den and a danger. So little John Bol
linger waB allowed to slip quietly out
ot the v.'4r!d jhnn which he had Just
opened his baby eyes.
The death of John Bollinger stirs up
the emotions, whlltf the death of hun
dreds of thousands of little John Does
from neglect simply wearies and be
wilders us, says the Christian Herald.
Thousands upon thousands of little
lives go out every year that might be
spared if society were more thought
ful, more Just, more kind. Every mu
nicipality can do specific things to
lower the infant death rate
Some things are being done to help
some to hinder.' The establishment of
the children's Jbureau will help the'de
feat of the bill forbidding Interstate
commerce in child labor products will

sure of no wages when parents' Jobs
are gone pressure of industrial em
ployment of mothers pressure of the
shameful traffic in child lslbor in many
industries pressure of high rents and
high foodstuffs and poor aid pressure
of crowding and disease and dirt—all
these things roll up the sad, gigantic
death roll of America's babies. But
Just because there are so many we do'
„ot
Just because we do not
know their names we do not care. Can
we not maike the vision real—not a
great multitude of John Does whom we
can not see nor count, but of -little
people with chances of happiness and
usefulness such as this little creature
at Chicago could never have had. Who
shall measure the grief of these need

The Christmas time is here. If some
one will be a good fellow some of these
babies will be saved and their parents
will have the happiest Christmas of
their lives.
THE RUMMAGE 8ALE.
She opened her garrets and closets,
Peered back on the uppermost shelf.
Pulled out the things she had thrust
away
As not good enough for herself
Overlooked not the flimsiest item
She found in her annual search,
For any old rummage is good enough
For a rOmmage sale for the church.
She drew forth a china teapot.
Quite good—save for the spout
And there was a lamp that always
smoked.
So she'd finally thrown it out
And then came a muslin shirtwaist.
Frail shield 'gainst the winter's blast.
But—rip off the lace!—somebody will
pay
A dime for the poor ofttcast.
This? Why this Is a flannel Jacket,
All threadbare and fretted with
holes
And here are some slippers and high
heeled shoes,
She must have danced out their
soles.
Four cups with the handles all broken,
A bodice thaf minus a cord.
But—they all into her basket—
They'll bring a few cents for the

And so the gleaning goes forward,
For miladi is fired with zeal
To sell to the pefbr of the parish
What a thief wonld not troftble to
steal.
And the price of the wornout garments
(The sweat of the poor why buy)»
Is set aside as an offering

Comes a time wlien miladl's translated
To mansions not- made with the

And St. Peter, who knows all her rec

Shall say to his angelic bands: 2
"Go, look in the dimmest corners
I Of the closet under the stair
Is a dented crown that has lost two
stars,
But 'twill do for this, woman to wear.
"And here are some wornout sandals,
A robe and other old things.
And Just take down from that hook on
the wall
That pair of second-hand wings
They are rwjty. I know, in the binges,

The first American dance was
called the minuet and consisted in a
low bow and a skittish retreat to
the other side of the room. This
dance had one sparkling advantage,
as it did not allow a beefy partner
to ruin a new blue chiffon, gown with
a perspiring paw, but it did not last
long. Then people began, to dance In
thick clusters, one of the thickest
specimens Introduced being the ser
pentine waltz. Of late years, the in
vention .of new dances has become a
flourishing industry, working in
three shifts and causing middle-aged
husbands who have lost their hair
and enthusiasm to sit out, all of the
program except the midnight lunch.
