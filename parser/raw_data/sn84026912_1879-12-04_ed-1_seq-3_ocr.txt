Tho Governor's Message.
With our last issue wo placed before our road
ors tho annual message of Oov. Simpson. It is
an able und conciso state paper, recommend
ing in plain and practical lunns mich changes
and modifications of tho law us aro likely tn
dovclop tho material and educational interests
of tho Stato and to promoto tho publie wel
fare. Wo invite special attention to. that
portion of tho message which relates to pub
lic ronds. Tho public roads ufa Connty truly
furnish tho index to its civilization ns well ns
to its material and commercial prosperity.
Thoy enable tho farmer tn convoy to market
bin produce at less cost and labor and with
loss wear and tear of his stock and wagons,
und to return to his furm such groceries and
necessaries as he must get from abroad. A
well graded and well worked network of
public roads is closoly oonnectod with tho
development nf every industry, and if, ns tho
.Governor says, our roads fifty years ago had
boon properly laid off und improved annually
what a great benefit they would havo beou to
our peoplo. This should bo looked to every
year and snob cbnngcs ho mudo gradually ns
will improve thc grado and rcduco tho work
I required on our roads. In tho palmiest days
of the Roman lOmpire Italy was noted for ber
smooth and easy road*, and in a broken
country liko ours too great attention cannot be
paid to this molter. Thc affect of engineering
skill in the laying out of roads can bc easily
seen by persons who travel over tho Tucka*
scgeo or Rowland Turnpike, built by Mr.
Slouu bolero tho war. Though it climbs
mountains, tho grado is so easy nod tho bed
6o smooth that tho traveler can hardly
realize ho is in tho midst, of tho mountains,
unless bc notices the deep gorgos on ono sido
and the ruggod slcopness on tho other. By
propor attention in the COUrso of twonty or
Ithirty years travel hero could bo groatly im
proved by propor changes in our public ronds.
Nothing would improve more tho value of
our l?inds or tend more to draw population.
Tho Governor also strongly urges the
passage nf sumo law to stop tho pernicious
prnciico of carrying concealed weapons, und
also a law tb encourage tile restocking ol
our rivets with fish, and also a law te
"lay tho foundation* of tho State
Wr University broad and deop, so that as
time rolls on story aftor story may bp built
thereon, ns rho educational wants cf thc
' peoplo may demand, until it could stand
forth amid the educational stmeiuros of thc
world, grnrid and majestic in all its propor
tions" lt may bo said tho peoplo nt this
I timo aro too limited in means to justify the
reopening this institution by State, nid.
i This is true, but wc are glad to soo our Go
vornor looks to tho time when its classic
halls will someday bo again filled with the
youth of our Stato and of otbor Staten. To
ifs training tho Stato nwoa much of hor pun?
grcntnoss, which in past years shined forth
in her ministry, in hor bar and Ju
diciary and' in statesmanship. With
ono of tho best selected libraries in the
United Slates and with grounds and build?
inga well improved and adapted to tho pur?
pososof a college, wo would not liko to seo itfl
doors closed fore vor At this time noarly all
the State? havo either a university or colloga
under their control, und it would certainly
J bo a stop backward for South Carolina to close
M an institution which hus boon in existence
moro than th reo sooro and ton years.
Tho Governor also rooomm.ends that suoh
laws bb passed a? will pr?vido bettor moans for
(ho comfortable Support of tho poor in ouch
county. It is no IOBS an uot of humanity
than of Christian duty to provide nt the publio
expenso for thoso who by misfortune or acci
dent, lmvo been rondorcd iinablo to maintain
themselves. In this mattet wo have hoard no
oomplniut from this county and boliovo our
paupers are comfortably providod for,
The workings of tho ponai end oharitablo
institutions of tho Stato aro succinctly sot
out and proper recommendations ni ado as to
the various departments of tho government.

Tho next mooting of tho Union will bo on

load US their cheering proRcnce. Wo can do
nothing without tho corporation of tho
peoplo, and they should aid us. Addresses
will bo delivorcd by Dr. J. P. Smoltzor, Mr.
John S. Vernor and Col. W. C. Keith, and on

which will moko the mooting quito interesU

LONDON, Dcoomber 1.-Tho Times, in a
leader discussing President Hayes' message,
says: "If legal teodor notes are oallod in
and cancelled, silver dollars must take their
plaoo and tho present plethora bo thus re
lieved." Eurthor relief, it thinks, will
oome from tho natural operation of tho
laws of trade. Money which has flowed so
freely from Europe to the United States
rill make itself felt in tho latter country
by on advanoo iu prices. This advance
will bo followed by a demand for European
goods. Tho process may bo slow but it is
OB sure os tho movemont of tides."
It is a faot well worth noting that thc
exports of domestic merchandise from tho
United States wcro larger, iu value, during
the lust fiscal year than during any previous
ono in tho history of this country. It is o
second fuot worth noting that tho exports
of all sorts wore in voluo 8711,637,393, and
tho total imports 8145,777,755-so that
tho former wero to tho latter os OJ to4, and
surpassed them by $205,850,638. Tho
exports were reokond in a mixed gold und
curroncy valut ; tho imports only in gold.
Allowing for this, wo still have a balaneo
of about 8250,000,000 on tho export side.
