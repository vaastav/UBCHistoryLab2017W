Santa Claus Books
When the evening shadows gather and
the time is eight o'clock
You can hear, if you will listen, Mr.
Sand Man's gentle knock.
Then you'd better hustle livelytime
your evening prayers were said
And each hoy and girl well tucked in
cozy, downy little bed.
For when Mr. Sand Man's knocking
sounds the signal, you may know
Santa Claus is closely watching from
his palace built of snow,
And the children that are naughty and
don't mind their ma's and pa's
Get their names down in the "Bad
Book" that is kept by Santa Claus.
Boys who never split the kindling, and
the girls who alwavK nrv
"When they're asked to wash the
dishesSanta Claus has got his eye
On such boys and girls, and watches
with a sad and sorry look
As he writes each name in sorrow on
the pages of the book.
And the girl whenever hurries, but
lets mamma do the work,
And the boy who's always scheming
all his little chores to shirk
They may think no' one pay's notice
when they don't help ma's and pa's,
But their names are in the "Bad Book"
that is kept by Santa Claus.
But old Santa keeps a "Good Book"
it's, the "bestest book of all,
"Where lie writes the names of children
Who are nromnt at dutv'a o.nl. '
And the boys who splits the kindling
and the girls who never shirk
But rise early in the morning and help
mamma with the work;
And the boys - who never grumbje
when there's 'work for them to do,
And the girls who help their mammas
till the housework is all through
O, they needn't ever worry when it's
Christmas time,. because
All their names are in the "Good
Book" -thatr is kept by Santa ,Claus.
Is your name" down in the "Bad Book?"
Well, there's: still a chance for you,
And -if you will listen to me, I will tell
you what to do.
Don't act naughty, don't talk rudely,
don't be noisy, be polite,
Get up early in the morning1, s early
into bed at night.
Cheerfully perform each duty, do your
work before you play,
Never put off till tomorrow work that
should be done today.
If you do these things, dear children,
it -will please your ma's and pa's,
And your names go in the "Good
Book" that is kept by Santa Claus.
Optimism
'Christmas is a-comin
". An' no turkey bird in sight,
But a happy tune I'm hummln'
Ain't no moon t' shine tonight.
Correct v '.
"I tell you," shouted the campaign
orator, "our grand old party stands for
a great deal."
"That's right," grunted the wise
gazabo in the corner. "It stands for
you, and that's something I won't do."
To Be Sure
"Do you not believe that it is always
best for a public, official to take the
people into Tils confidence?"
"Well," was the cautious reply of
Senator Graball, "I will admit that I
have always held to that In a measure.
I always take the people in."
Dangerous Man
Willie "bat feller Bertilon o'
France is a dangerous man."
Johnnie "W'ot's de matter wld
him?"
Willie "He's do guy dat invented
detectin fellers by linger prints."
Johnnie-VWell, w'ot uv it?'
Willie "Mamma was readin' about
him de other day, an' yesterday I got
into a jar o' her preserves. It was
de finger prints dat led to my undoin'."
Signs of Age
When you see a boy skating and you
begin to say to yourself, "I could beat
him skating when I was his age," it
is a sign that you are growing old.
The older you get the better you could
skate when a boy.
When several of you get together
and begin laughing over the escapades
of your boyhood days you have a lot
of fun. But when your own boy at
tempts some of those same pranks
you scold him fiercely and tell him
ho is headed straight for destruction.
That is a sign that you are growing
old.
When you get up in the morning
and think you will walk down town,
you feel as if you could walk forty
miles at the rate of about five miles
an hour. After you have walked
about seven blocks at a moderate gait
you are pufflj ""'1' a porpoise and
looking back over your shoulder to see
if. a car is coming. That's another
sign.
The Labor Vote
In a western community where
there are in the neighborhood of 4,000
union workingraen in a total voting
population of about 8,500, the domi
nant party was asked to nominate two
union working men to the legislature.
The request was refused. The minor
ity party, however, nominated two
clean, capable, honest working men,
one a union printer, the other a union
carpenter. If ono-half of the union
working men who affiliated with the
dominant party had cut loose from
partisanship and voted for thjjir fel
low unionists, they would have been
elected. The returns show that less
than five per cent of them thought
more of their unionism and the Inter
ests of labor than they did of their
party.
And yet there are a lot of working
men who are forever complaining
that "labor is not recognized," and
that "capital gets everything it asks
for."
Is there such a thing in this coun
try as "the labor vote?"
The" Message .
paying aside the paper containing
the president's message Mr. Voght R.
Strate exclaimed to his wife:
"Susan, that is the most statesman
like document that has been issued
from the White House in a quarter
of a century."
"Yes. dear." renlied Mrs. Strate,
hiding a smile behind her hand. "
"Clear, concise, right to the point,
and fearless in its demands for re
forms that the people need."
T'm an triad, dear." said Mrs. Strate.
turning her head in order to "high a
laugh.
"Its demand for tariff reform is as
clear as .a bell and can not be disre
garded. The language is that of a
statesman, the thought is that of a
patriot, and the whole breathes an in
dependence that is refreshing after
fifty years of political intrigue."
w.fh tm ,8 glad'" 8ald Mr- stto
with a giggle.
"I can not help contrasting it with
the messages of that political non
entity that hold tho presidential chair
a few years ago, Grovor Cleveland.
His messages wero turgid, unreason
mg, lacking in logic and wholly with
out merit. But this message Is just
the contrary. It will go down in his
tory. "What n thunder aro you laugh
ing at, Susan?" b
"O, nothing much. Only yesterday
the morning paper tho first thing
this morning, as you wanted to glance
at tho president's message."
"Well, why should that make you
laugh?"
"O, I don't know, only in cleaning
up tho other day I ran across an old
paper folded away In a book and it
contained President Cleveland's mes
sage of 1887, and I just cut tho head
lines out of this morning's paper and
pasted over tho headlines in tho old
paper. You have been reading Mr.
Cleveland's message instead of Presi
dent Roosevelt's and it struck mv as
being so funny that I just couldn't
help"
But by this time Mr. Voght R,
Strate had jammed the old paper in
tho stove and was on his way down
town, muttering to himself.
Brain Leaks
Satan Is his own press agent.
Self-sacrifice entails self-denial.
Life is worth living if the liver is
worthy of life.
A smile is the best weapon with
which to meet trouble..
People who look wiCh eyes of love
seldom see tho defects.
