army, showing how tho field artillery

with that of the other great nations.
The diagram was made a part of
General Wood's last report to the
Secretary of War. The subject of
the-country's defenses was put before
Congress by President Wilson's
message Tuesday. Almost simultaneously
plans were discussed at a
meeting in New York city for the
formation of a national security
league. This league proposes to extend
its work of investigation of the
national defenses to all large cities.

STATE CHILE
LAW TO B
. +By
the Coming Legislature if
What is Being Advocated 1
Prevails with It.
llffCIAL IO TNf TIUCRAM)
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.?It looks as
if West Virginia must either Take up
and Change her child labor laws or
be one of the states that have to be
coerced by the federal government into
properly safeguarding her chil- 1
dren," said Owen R. Lovejoy, general
secretary of the National Child Lar
bor Committee, in dlscusking proposed
changes In the West Virginia
child labor law in their. relation to
the Palmer-Owen bill now pending in I
Congress. There are many additions P
to the West Virginia child labor law ?
to be urged,at the coming session of 1
the legislature and among the most j
important are the prohibition of night *
work by children under 16, the pro- ?
hlbltion of the employment of chil- 8
dren under 16 in mines or quarries,
and the provision for an 8-hopr day j:
for children under 16, all of which jj
are embodied In the Palmer-Owen r
federal child labor bill.
This proposed federal bill to reg- j,
ulate Interstate comnftrce in the nro- .
ducts of child labor has already been
favorably reported by the House com-| r
miltee on labor and lias the support ,
of congressmen of all parties and of ?
many national organizations such as c
tbe American Federation of Labor, B
the Federal Council of Churches of 0
Christ in America and the American v
Medical Association besides the Na- tlonal
Child Labor Committee who
drafted the bill. It is said to reprie- I
sent the minimum provisions of a I
good child labor law and besides the f
provisions named above prohibit In
terstate commerce in goods in the
production of which children under C
14 have been employed in factories,
mills, canneries and workships. There
are nine states that have all the provisions
of this bill already on their,
statute books and only two states ol
that have none of its provisions. C
If West Virginia does not pass the c<
proposed additions to her law and be- w
comes as Mr. Lovejoy put it, one of w
the states thht have to be coerced by e:
(Tin forlorn 1 n>rtwn??tvi??* * '
? V ?vua?aMs B"' IIICUl, Otic W1I11CC1 SI
the federal law more thaii most
slates. There Is only one state be- C
sides West Virginia that does not yet fi
regulate hours of labor for children, a
and most other important mining ni
states forbid the employment of chll- ai
dren under 16 In mines, while West u
Virginia still uses boys of 14 and 15. w
But there Is reason to hope, accord- a<
ing to Mr. Lovejoy who believes the a
outlook in West Virginia is good, that f<
when the legislature meets In Janu- g
ary It will pass laws to bring West w
Virginia up to the standard of the it
country. Then the Palmer-Owen a
bill. It passed by Coingress, will bring n
to West Virginia no rtillng not al- r
ready in force as a state law. ri

Says Miss Henderson.
The mountain sections and mln
ng (owns or west Virginia are sarer

Ivelyn Henderson, principal of the
'atty C. Stockdale Memorial School
or Cirlg, at Lawson.'.W. Va., who Is
lelivering addresses to women's
ocietles In eastern cities.
"There haB been a marked imirorement
since West Virginia went
ry," sh'e .says. "Before the state
tad prohibition women couldn't venire
along the railroad tracks beween
Lawson and Colcord on acount
of the gambling dens and
runken men who frequented this
ath.
"That'sall different now, and there;
s not half so much disorder in thej
lining camps <ln , formerly. Of.
ourse, liquor is brought into 'the
tate; but there'll not nearly so much
f it consumed, because the people
ron't go to the trouble to get it.

Even men who drink and love it voted
to make West Virginia dry because
they wanted the temptation removed."
MIbb Henderson describes some of
the conditions which the miners and
mountaineers faced In the 'recent
strike. "When the mines-opened the
mountaineers left their homes and
got jobs in the camps," she says.
"Some of them had been working
only two months when the strike
came and thev ware turned nut nf
tholr homes. They couldn't go back
to the mountains, because they didn't
have anything to eat, so they lived
through the winter in tents.
"It's,a bitter things for some of
these mountaineers to see corporations
making millions out of the Umber
land which their fathers and
grandfathers owned and sold for a
mere. song. Most of the mountaineers
now are living on company Iitnd.
We can't blame them if they are a
little belligerent."
YOUHyUEN
In .the South Are Exposed to
Accident and Disease Declares
Investigator.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.?Exposure
to accident and a definite tendency
to tuberculosis, are the penalUes that
young children pay for working in
the cotton mills, according to Lewis
W. Hlne, staff pho/>grapher of .the
National Child' Labor Committee,
who baB just'returned from several
weeks of InvestlgaUon In the South.
"I am shocked to And conditions still
so bad in North Carolina. The legal
age limit there for factories is 18
years, but from my study of twenty|
mills in North Carolina alone, I believe
.that there are hundreds of violations,
and that the 1910 census
figures which reported 4,000 children I
under 14 in the cotton mills of that I
one state and 100,000 children under I
14 In non-agricultural work throughout
the country, are a conservative
estimate of the number of young
children at work today. There arc
still twenty other states besides
North Carolina in which the employment
of children under 14 in mills
or canneries is legal, so that the
physical danger and the lack ot education
from premature work continue
unchecked."
With these facts in mind the National
Child -Labor Committee is
calling a conference of all Intereied
in the projection of children", at
Washington on < January 5 and 6. to
emphasize the need of a federal child
labor law. The speakers will include
Representative A. Mitchell!
Palmer cf Pennsylvania, who introduced
last January the child labor,
bill which is on the 'Wlendar for
the present session; Senator Robert
L. Owen, of Oklahoma, gvho.sponsored
the bill 'in the Senate. Felix, Adler.

dock. W. O. Hart and Secretary Wil- J
eon of the Department of Labor.
The Palmer-Owen bill was drafted :
by the National Child Labor Committee.
and proposes a 14-year-old
litnlt for all children employed upon
factory, mill or cannery products
shipped in Interstate comhierce; it
limits the hours of children 14 to. 16
In the same occupations to eight!
hours a day and forbids their em-!
ploymnnt at night; and it prohibits '
the employement at any time of-children
under 16 in mines and quarries.
