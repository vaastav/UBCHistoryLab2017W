LEXINGTON, S. (\,
WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 11. 189'.
Judge Brawlsy has appointed J. C.
C. Hutson of Hampton, Clerk of the
United District Court, vice E. M.
Seabrook, deceased.
J. Adger Smyth will be Charleston s
next Mayor, he having defeated his
Independent competitor in a primary
election yesterday by about 100
majority.
?he Jttepu oilcan nauuuai
tion to nominate a candidate for
President of the United States will
be held in St. Louis, Mo., on June
16th next.
Bradley, the first Republican Governor,
Kentucky ever had, was
inaugurated at Frankfort, yesterday
in the presence of an immense crowd.
The Broxton bridge brutality is a
disgrace to Christian civilization,
and the inhuman perpetrators should
be made to suffer the extreme penalty
of the law.
The City of BostoD, in a municipal
election, has gone Democratic by a
large plurality. From this, sanguine
Democrats argue that the tide is
turning.
The Attorney General is at present
the most hard worked man m tne
State. In his report he showed that
eighty-one cases engaged his attention.
Besides this number he has
had to argue the Registration and
the Dispensary cases.
There is talk in Republican circles
of Congress impeaching Embassador
Bayard for high crimes and misdemeanors.
The grounds are that in a
speech before the Edinburg, Scotland,
Philascphical Institute he denounced
"protection as a form of State Socialism."
President Cleveland's message to
the 54ih Congress is in some respects
an able document. He discusses the
financial problem at length and argues
that from his standpoint the
one thing needful for the prosperity
of this country is the gold standard,
(and incidentally the issue of more
interest bearing gold bonds.) He |
touches upon all questions of interest j
vmnn which this Cjnfrress will have
~ir? ? <-<
to deal. Upon the whole the message
comes up to the expectation of
his friends, and is no disappointment ;
to Lis enemies.
A Significant Departure.
"Wit.ii the departure of another year !
when a review is made of the coudi- j
. tion of affairs, it is only light that !
some thought be given to the pbysi- j
cal body which enables everyone to !
battle with life's problem and figure
for themselves the profit or loss on
the trial balance sheet. Though the
bank account may be large and each
one's material gain be great, it would
not be surprising if it suddenly upon
many that good health has been
greatly impoverished by the low condition
of the blood. It is in this
state that the lactic acid in the vital
fluid attacks the fibrous tissues, particularly
the joints, makiDg known
the local manifestations of rheumatism.
Thousands of people have
found in Hood's Sarsaparilla the
great blood purifier, a positive and
permanent cure for rheumatism.

Sow to Asciuiro a Sass Voice, j
Ferrari, the celebrated composer,
relates the following anecdote in his
memoirs: On a cold December night
a man in a little village in the Tyrol
opened the window and stood in front
of it with hardly any clothing to his i
back.
' Peter!'' shouted a neighbor who
was passing, "what are you doing
there?"
"I'm catching a cold."
"What for?"
"So that I can sing bass tomorrow !

Af:ar Thirty Years.
j From the Ashtabula, Ohio. Beacon.
Mr. Fred Taylor was bom and
brought up near E'mira, N. Y., and
from there enlisted in the ISOth regiment,
X. Y., Y. I, with which he
went through the war, and saw much
hard servicee. Owing to exposuro
and hardships during the service,
Mr. Taylor contracted chronic diar- !
rhcea from which he has suffered
now over thirty years, with absolutely
no help from physicians. By nature
he was a wonderfully vigorous roan.
Had he not been, his disease and the
experiments of the doctors had killed
him long ago. Laudanum was the 1
only thing which afforded him relief.
He had terrible headaches, his nerves 1
were shattered, he could not sleep an
hour a day on an average, and he
was reduced to a skeleton. A year
ago, he and his wife sought relief in
a change of climate and removed to <'
^ ^ 1- in
ijr6H0V3j V^niOJ uut iiic jij-i
health came not. Finally on the i
recommendation of F. J. Hoffner, the
leading druggist of Geneva, who was i
cognizant of similar cases which Pink
Pills had cured, Mr. Taylor was persuaded
to try a box. "As a drown- >
ing man grasps a straw so I took the
pills," says Mr. Taylor," but with no <
more hope of rescue. But after
thirty years of suffering and fruitless
search for relief I at last found it in
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. The day !
after I took the first pills I com- i
menced to feel better and when I
commenced to feel better and when <
I had taken the first box I was in
fact a new man." That was two :
months ago. Mr. Taylor has since
taken more of the pills and his pro
gress is steady and he has the ut- i
most confidence in them. He has ]
regained full control of his nerves !
and sleeps as well as in his youth. <
Color is coming back to his parched j
veins and he is gaining flesh and :
strength rapidly. He is now able to j
do considerable outdoor work. 1
As he concluded [narating his sufferings,
experience and cure to a <
Beacon reporter Mrs. Taylor, who | i
has been his faithful helpmeet these <
many years, said she wished to add
her testimony in favor of Pink Pills.
"To the pills alone is due the credit i
of raising Mr. Taylor from a helples i
invalid to the man he is today," said j J
Mrs. Taylor. Both Mr. and Mr?. 1
Taylor cannot find words to express 1
the gratitude they feel or recommend J
too highly Pink Pills to suflering 1
humanity. Any inquiries addressed 1
to tbcm at Geneva, 0 , regardingMr. 1
Taylor's case they will cheerfully i
answer as tfccy are anxious that the 1
whole world sbali know what Pink I
Pills have done for tbcm and that ?
suffering humanity may be benefited 1
thereby. ^
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain all 1
the elements necessary to give new J
life and richness to the blood and ! *

I To the Editor of the Dispatch: \ t
I The past week has been fine for
! butchering bogs; we have enjoyed c
j some of the sausage and pudding. ^
[ Everybody is done sowing and a ^
heavy crop has been put in of both ^
oats and wheat. *
The saw mills are doing a fine busi- *
ness. The advance in cotton makes I
lumber more lively. 1!
Quite a stir in Xo. 10. Xo doubt i
it will in the near future be cut into t
three School districts for the conve- a
nienee of the children. The school t
population has grown to such a num- s
her as to necessitates a division. u
Cadet L. A. Sease is at home from r
Clemson College and has a fine coat j s
of measles. We have not seen much j e
of him as he is keeping close. I j r
hope he will be able to attend the j c
Teaehers; Association. | ..
The Casper Debating Society will ^
meet the Star in a joint discussion
Saturday evening, the 11th inst. The ^
place of meeting is near Amick's
L ? | c
ferry. A ceneral invitation is ex- 1 ?
? It
tended to all who wish to bear the l
debators. As the Casper is an old | ^
society, and has many fine speakers,
it will down the Star in this contest,
bat tbe Star is young and will in
time take tbe Casper to task, and no
doubt it will sbow upon tbe question
better tban tbose of longer training ' t
may expect. "We certainly admire ! c
. * I r
the youthful pluck in accepting a I y
challenge from so well organized so- I c
ciety. Such courage must succeed. e

Andy has shaken up the old man I
i i ^
oa the bridge. Soiae how he is a bad
bridge man. The Supervisor came
to see the Hayes' bridge, but have
not learned what he thought of the
rotten sills and the way bis commissioner
had patched it. Don't be so
hard on the fellows, Andy. You must
use smaller shot.
Several persons have mo red from
along the line to the factories at your
place, Batesburg and Newberry.
This move is not confined to tenants,
but men who had nice homes and
fertile lands havo left them through
the inducement of doing better at
the factory than on the farm. No
doubt they will receive good wages
for their labor, but in the words of
Old Pete, "This will better the cotton
market." If the move were confined
to tenants only, than it might
be a plea for better wages on the
farm. This cannot be done without
a loss to land owners, for those who
have lands and do not pay any rents
or interest on money are going away
from their all, then it is not reasonable
to suppose that the renters
have not gotten as much as can well
be given. "With all tho saw mills
end turpentine work, there will be a
scarcity of farm hands next year,
especially those who are good and
reliable. In looking over the column
of sales of last salesday, it is a
noticeable fact that the farm lands
sold low down, and only town lots
and timbered lands brought a fair
mice. This shows the little appre
L ? ?
ciation for the farm. Let Uncle
Pete's prophecy come?"Crowd the
factories with labor and enhance the
value of farm products/1 But the
way horses have been selling, those
effering them don't think their value
has increased. There is already a
surplus of horses on the farm and
Dnly mule3 are of general value to
the mill and turpentine industries,
md when the move to town and factory
cease and turn toward the farm
horses will again bring a fair price.
Xow, AS the manufacturing interest
is so good, would it not be well
to have more to utilize the waters of
Dur grand Saluda and Broad rivers
for driving the wheels of factories.
They are full of life and almost dying
for want of something better
than running fussily between their
hady banks only resorted to for a
'cw cat fish. There arc some of as
rue mill sits ou these streams within
Lexington county as can be found,
lor will it require canalling and ditchDg
and blasting, just a little damning
and the gayly waters will leap
vith joy to their task. There is
nore than enough capital lying idle
0 start as many more such mills as
ire now running in the county, and
bus open up more places for better
vages. All that is needed is for a
nan who has a great deal of push to
start the matter with an earnest deermination
for success and soon our
iver bills will be scenes of such in1

Mr. J. W. Whitman near Brook,
lied Tuesday, the 3d inst., and was
juried Wednesday evening at the
hc-xington Baptist church by the
dev. Mr. Stone in the presence of a
arge congregation of relatives and
riends. The funeral sermon was
jreached from the text selected by
ill*. Whiteman just before his death
. e. "Blessed is the pure in heart for
hey shall see God." About six years
,ge. Mr. Whitman's father died, and
hough he was young, he nobly as umed
the responsibility which fell
ipon him of taking care of his step
uother and three sisters. Only a
hort notice was given him of his
arly departure though he seemed
eady for the death angel when he
:ame, having been at church on the
>revious Sunday appearently in
he best of health. Little did any
me that saw him at church think beore
the sun should set Wednesday
ivening he would be buried in that
Lurch yard. Again Mrs. Whiteman
s left and no doubt she will miss
iVilliam as much as she did his father.
