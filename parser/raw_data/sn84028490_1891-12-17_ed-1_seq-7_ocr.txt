The Young Democracy, which Is so
honorably represented by our Canton
club, is lully alive to this responsibil
ity of citizenship, and in such nn or
ganization tho proper mean are. taken
of association nnd propaganda to de
velop that intelligent, conscientious
votinff, without which tho ballot Is only
hurtlul. , ,,
It Is more Important to teach tho uso
of tho ballot than of tho buyotiet.
To those who, like tho writer, believe
that Democratic principle will best
govern this land, our oii'ifj Democrats
are naturally tho hope of the future.
They aro not expected to originate any
new political truths or ru.vul political
doctrines, but to bo grounded In fiust
I'iunou'Lis, Democratic tundnmentali
that, properly applied, can meet every
requirement of a free people in a feder
ation of free republics.
Tharn la no doubt that tho fiuostlon
of tariff is a burning one, nnd, perhaps,
tho leading issue of our immediato
Amorlcan day. Yet, on his part, the
writer thinks that free roinago of sil
ver is about equally as moiiirntous nnd
as much in tho interest of the peopte
aslH freedom of commerce. The ques
tion of silver is oven mor world-wide
bo far as the United States holds tho
kov to tho situation.
But whether it bo freo States or free
men, freo trade or freo silver, the Dem
ocratic deposit of political faith has tho
right American solution for each and
every one of these.
Nor should tho history of our Stato
doms ever pass away from our political
study. Tho forces of centralization
and decentralization, old as the world
nnd sweeping as humanity, abide, In
our country, within those very lines of
tho rights of tho States and tho dele
gated, defined authority of tho Federal
agency.
Proirt consolidation of political powor
outllow nil tho other Invasions of indi
vidual right nnd liberties, whether by
corporation, tho money power or privi
leged class.
To that gallant Young Domocracy,
as typilled in tho Young Men's Demo
cratic Club, of Canton, I recall the
shibboleth Lytton gives to tho masterly
Itlchellou. that in tho lexicon of well

Mr. IngorsoU'a agnosticism evidently

of the elections in Kansas this year.
Tho election reports by the Associated

Tho I31ado is for Poraker only nnd
don't like Sherman n particle, but this
does not detract from the truth in tho
above, Tho fact that a good Democrat
is now enabled to edit nnd control the
central orgau of the g. o. p. of Ohio is
one of tno auspicious signs of tho
times. There is another hopeful thing
down in the sputliwest corner of Ohio,
whoro a real Foraker organ, tho Com
mercial Gazette, is owned aud substan
tially edited by n Democrat (John 11.
McLean), and to make the situation
still more uulquo nnd Interesting tho
same mau owns nnd edits a Sherman
organ, of Republican proclivities pond
ing nu election and ot Democratic emo
tions immediately thereaitcr. Just
what causes this groat diversity of po
litical tergiversations wo don'c exactly
know, nut we preaume.lt is owiug to
the McKlnley bill.
Only a few days ago the slow going
Kvemug Rep. of Canton pitched Into
one ot our Crisp AVnshlngton dis
patches. Well this is n game that two
can play at. On Wednesday the Rep.
printed a dispatch from Washington,
probably written in tlie Rep. olllce, that
the President's message was delivered
to Congress at noon and that Its read
lug was attentively listened to by the
House, or words of that Import. AVo
knew that was n whopper when wo saw
It. Rut now comes tho Cleveland
Leader of Thursday, a paper that keep3
James I). Morrow as its correspondent,
and ho occasionally tells tho truth.
Let U3 see what tho said Morrow
says about the attentive listening to
this volumluous Presidential essay.
Hero wo quote from Morrow, in tho
Leader, 'iho scene is in the Houso of
Representatives. Tho time is 12:30
Wednesday. Tho Secretary of the
President, Mr. Pruden, appears in front
of tho Speaker's high backed chair with
the message. Now wo quote:
"Mr. Petition takes oil his hat, likewise
his overcoat, and with an assistant scr-geaut-ut-arms
stations himsolf at tho en
tranco to tho main aisle, back near the
largo doublo doors. Ho has tho eyo of
the Speaker, also tho message, also the
floor. "Mr. Speaker," cries tho SerRcaut
nt-Arras. "Tho Secretary of tho Presi
dent," ho continues in substance, looking
nt the secretary askanco. It Is always
well to keep your eyo on tho secretary, for
Bomo timo ho may havo a knlfo In his
pocket. Tho Speaker ropeats back, "Tho
secretary of tho President," or words to
that flU'ct, which means that it is tho Sec
retary's lead and that trumps is trumps.
Then Mr. Pruden says something in
reply, but thero is too much nolso
to make out exactly what It is. Tho
import of his remarks, however, is that ho
has tho messaso under his arm and would
llko very much to get rid of it. Iho
Speaker nods stiffly as boflts a man in
his station, which moans "Co inn on,
Pruden. you havo tho rlobt of way." and
Pruduu comes down tho alslo, tho eyes of
pretty girls in tho gallery glued upon his
maniv lorm. rrotty girls imvo no nrui
to kIii ' tliolr eyes on any man, much logs
a man of Prudou'sngo and virtuous de-portim-nt.

BLAINE IS A SIOK MAN.
The New York World of Saturday'
prints nn Interview with Col. Alex.
McClure.of Philadelphia, on Ulalne's
physical condition. As Col. McClure Is
n wnrni personnl friend of Maine, nnd
nn intimnto also of Maine's Philadel
phia physician, his opinion Is entitled
to serious consideration. Hero is the
interview.
"Mr. Rlnlne Is tho only statesman
left in tho ranks of tho G. 0. P. He it
wns who rescued his party from the
bottomless abyss into which the Mc
Klnley bill would have plunged it. Rut
for Mr. Maine's insartlon of the reci
procity clause In the McKlnley bill, tho
Republicans would not to day be cer
tain of carrying n single stnto in the
Union. Mr.Maino foresaw tho situa
tion nnd wns quick to suggest the rem
edy. The Republican leaders in Con
gress objected nt first, but he nroused
public sentiment and forced them to
his position. Reciprocity is another
numo for Freo Trade, but its adoption
by tho Republicans is tho only tiling
that has saved them from utter and
crushing defeat.
"It must bo very gratifying to Mr
Rlntno to sea the very general demand
for his nomination in his party through
out tho conntry. He is unquestionably
tho strongest man In his party. Rut I
do not believe ho will bo nominated.
Mr. Maine may bo dreaming a little of
tho Presidency of into, but when tho
time comes when ho must faco tho
question nnd say 'yes' or 'no,' I believe
lie will say 'no.- ....
"His health Is tho only obstacle in his
path, but that is much more critical
than is generally known. If Mr. Rlaine
should accept tho nomination for Presi
dent next year 1 do not think he would
live to tho end of the campaign. Know
ing what I do about his physical condi
tion 1 think 1 amlustilled in snylng
that tho great strain of a canvass would
kill Mr.Maino lnsldeof sixty days. To
any one who knows Mr. Maine inti
mately nothing 13 more certain than
that ho io absolutely out of tho Presi
dential race, for physical reasons.
"I know that Dr. Taylor, of Philadel
phia, recently gave Mr. Maine a clean
bill of health, so to speak, but that does
not provo anything to tho initiated.
Tho truth is that Mr. Rlaine has been
kept alive for many years by his physl
ciaus concealing his true condition
from him. It would not do to tell him
the truth. Should any physlclnn do
so Mr. Rlaine would not live a week. I
have never met a man who was more
nearly a fatalist than Mr. Rlaine. Ills
physicians have kept htm up on false
hopes and misleading statements. If
he should learn the truth ho would col
lapse utterly."
"It is my knowledge of Mr. Dialne's
real condition that convinces me of tho
uttorimpossibillty of his being the Re
publican candidate next year. Ills
nomination nt Minneapolis would prac
tically ue nis death warrant.

Thk December number ot the North
Amerlcal Review has an article en
titled -'Tho Three Phllanthaopists,'1
which might bo read with profit by
mnny a rich almoner who gives lavish
ly of the prollt of oppressed labor. T.
V. Powderly discourses on the problem
of 'The Workingman nnd Free Sliver,"
and Hon. C. Wright Carroll, U.S. Com
missioner of Labor, contributes the re
sult of "A Great statistical Inve3tiga-

tion is tnat or Theodore Stanton on
"Quorum In European Legislatures "
Mr. Stanton, who publishes au English
periodical at Paris, nnd is nu indus
trious mau;of letters, has compiled n
very careful article on this subject,
with lettois from Swiss, Geruiau,
French, Danish and Italian statesmen.
It will bo interesting to note just how
far Ross Reed copied from tho petty
European powers In his Congression
al rulings, while Speaker of tho House,
tup leauing paper lor tno January
number will bo by Hon. W. E. Glad
stone. "Thoughts on the Negro Prob
lem," by James Rryce, M. P., which
opens the December number, is of raoro
than usual interest, recording ns it does
tho Impresslous of an Englishman who
has recently visited tho South after nn
luterval of seven years.
Ex-Speaker Reed has besn interview
ed on tlie respective merits of Harrison
aud Rlaine. As Reed was tho leader of
his party in the most notable Congress
of modern times, his opinions on his
tno3t illustrious compatriots are worth
printing, even in a Democratic journal.
The following is the most vitnl part of
an Interview with the ex-Speaker, first
published in AVnshlngton on Saturdny
nnd telegraphed we3t. Mr. Reed Bald:
"As lone as our great secretary of state
holds onto Paraguay and Patagonia and
Costu Itlca, wo can afford to give up tho
houso of representatives. I understand
that in somo of theso countries in which
Mr. Ulaine is opening markets, the peoplo
occasionally wear collars, and in somo
parts of Drazil they wear shirts on Sun
day, It will bo n great stroko of states
manship if Mr. Ulaino secures complete
control of such markets."
Then tho conversation took another
turn and ono of tho party asked Mr. Reed
if ho thought Harrison or Illaino would se
cure tho presidential nomination. "I sup
pose so,"' ho responded.
"And what do you thiuk of their respec
tive merits?"
Mr. Kood shrugged his shoulders nnd
shook his head as ho concluded: "Thero
is not much choice, hut I nm inclined to
think It is hotter to keep a sick man In tlio
whito houso, than to put a dead man
there."
Thi8moan8 as between two evils,
Reed prefera tho least, which is Har
rison. Reed Is a great admirer and reader of
Shakespoare, nnd his opinion of a
change from Harrison to Rlaine is
well expressed In tho following couplet
from Hamlet.
And nuke u? rattier bear ttmso III no have,
'I'liau Ily to outers u u kiiu not of
It is observed that Reed very cruelly
reiors to Harrison as a sick man. This
must not bo taken literally. He only
moaus Harrison is politically aeaa,
which is a far less saddening thought.
Again wo must call up the uard of all
bards, who is said to compass tho whole
gamut of human nature. For instance,
in Macbeth, Reed doubtless found the
galsomu galashe to boot his ire.
'Tho times havo been

up to bo sworn In. Plain lioalor.
Don't worry oyer this. When it comes
around that Sherman has to bo sworn
in again, Rrlco can got even with Shor

An honest Swedo tolls his story in plain

Tiiimn Is no doubt a perfect under
standing between Rlaine nnd Harrison
Rlaine understands perfectly that Har
rison wants to be President again, and
llnrrison understands perfectly that
Rlalno wants to run lor tho olllce
again. Thoy both understand also
that both can't got it. Tho recent elec
tions nlso indicate that there is a per
fect understanding among the peoplo
that neither can get It.
The President gives credit In his mos
sttneto tho McKinloy bill for tho creation
of "several creat industries" referring,
probably, to Wolsh tin and Scotch whisky,
Pittsburg Press (Hop).
This does vory well for a Republican
papor, but why did not tho President
montlon just ono Industry that tho Mc
Klnley bill created ?
Ir Mills does not nccept tho chair

mittee, it Is thought Speakor Crisp will
appoint Springer of Illinois. Springer
would givo great satisfaction, both
north and south.

that of Frederick Harrison, who asks
tho troublesome question "Is Modern

and inspiration are needed rather than
hammering, cramming and punishing.

Nearly every pattern of 5 Hors&
Blanket is imitated in color and
style. In most cases the imitation
looks just as good as the genuine,
but it hasn't the warp threads, and
so lacks strength, and while it sells
for only a little less than the genu
ine it isn't worth one-half as much:
The fact that Horse Blankets
arc. copied is strong evidence
that they are THE STANDARD,
and every buyer should see that
the trade mark is sewed on
the inside of the Blanket.
