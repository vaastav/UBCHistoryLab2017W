r., Hour-Treason
--...We hare devote gpace of jate
" development of thepolicjof tho Ad
ministration rci'itire to slavery.
i-That policy tras fairlj indicated In the
Inaugural Address of President Lincoln,
- the" election of his Cabinet, his message
to Congress, the otit-ginngs of hia Secre-
xaryot tar, antt the declarations of
'leading statesmen like Edttaed Evxeett
and'JoHsCocKEixs, who were known to
, possess his confidence and understood to
reflect his opinions; but it is so atrocious,
inhuman, and suicidal that many intel
-ligent Eentuckians believed it impossible
that even 'Abraham Likcolk, and the
. Abolition agitators he had called around
him, could contemplate it without horror.
t T We cannot but hope that the accumu
lated evidence of the purpose of the Ad
v ministration at Washington to convert
theirs into a free negro government, which
vwe have from time to time placed before
the public, had, prior to the appearance of
the last message of Mr. Lincoln, con
vinced the people of at least Southern
Kentucky that the success of the North
ern Armies in their State would. make
them the subjects of a centralized des
potism in which equality of the races is
cardinal doctrine.
.If. however, there, was one reader of
the Courier who still doubted whether the
North was given over to utter madness,
and hoped for moderation, justice, and
constitutional government in connection
with the free State, the official enuncia
tion of the policy of the Administration
through President's message, which we
hare published in full, and commented
upon at length, must have dispelled his
hopes and burned upon his brain the fear
ful fact, that the people of the South, not
now fighting for liberty, the right to
eovcra themselves, 'their interests, their
honor, ' and their independence alone,
are engaged ?! a desperate struggle for
existence, for should freedom bo given
to four millions of slaves and arms put
into their hands, then the question will
not alone be which shall be the superior
race, but which shall be exterminated!
The President's message is fearfully
- clear upon this subject, as we have shown.
" It indicates only too e'early that not only
is it intended to proclaim freedom to the
slaves, but that social and political equal
ity is to follow.
And now comes the official report of
Mr. Camzbon, Secretary of War, elabora
ting discussing, setting forth with more
pirticularity the policy of the adminis
tration a policy so infernal that the En
glish language contains no words to ex
press the abhorrence it must excite in the
breast of every human being over whose
mind accursed fanaticism has not estab
lished its. sway. Men cf Kentucky, in
whose veins flows the blood of a gener
ous andnoble ancestry, - whose fathers
would have perished at the stake rather
than submit to degradation, whose moth
en would have torn you from their
breasts and dashed you from the highest
peak of your glorious mountains had
they ever -dreamed that you would be
such spiritless and craven things as to
consent to live oa terms of equality with
the emancipated slaves of your fellow
citizens, read the recommendation of the
Secretary of War of the Administra
tion; and then prepare to meet the proc
lamation for your degradation, the dis
honor of your mothers, wives, and sweet
hearts, and the indiscriminate massacre
v of the old and the young, the innocent
and the guilty, the unarmed, defenceless,
and helpless, as those whose names you
bear would meet it could they burst the
cerements of the grave and stand in your
placeBl v- -

The Mobile Advertiser states that the
commander of the forces has proceded
West to take the necessary eteps for placing
that portion of the Province ia a state of

the Provincial Militia for drill during the
winter, and steps have been taken to erect
some fortifications at weak points, for which
purpose the Sappers and Miners at Halifax
have been ordered to MontreaL The Gov

can be employed, in case of an emergency,
before the opening of the river navigation.
Arms and ammunition are being forwarded

The erection of new batteries has been
eommeaced near the old fort at Toronto.

active preparations are being made. Tester
day afternoon the work vras commenced of
erecting a new battery of ten guns on the
south eida of the barracks, overlooking the
extensive warehouses of ihe Grand Trunk
Railway, the Queen's warf and the channel.
Two hundred men of the Thirtieth Regiment
were detailed for the dutj, and nt three
o'clock marched out to Trori:, rined with
pick axes and shovels. They appeared
quite jubilant at the prospect remote as
we trust it is of actiTe operations in h
field, and Bet about their' work, under the
superintendence of an officer of the Rojal
.engineer?, with a readiness and epmt char
actenstic of the British poldier. The
breastwork on which they are employed
will extend alone nearly the whole south
front -of the parade around, and will
be a strong and formidable work. The
guns to be mount d upon it or rather
oenwa it are sixty pounders, wita one
large Armstrong gun which will command
nearly the whole harbor. The timber for
the platforms, &c, is now on the ground.

above the surface of the parade ground. '
The battery has been dismantled and most
of the wood earned off. The new earth
work will be raised about ten feet inside of
the old, and will have a base apparently of
about twenty feet.
There are now on the ground upward of
twenty old smooth bore cannon, "honey
combed" with rust, and long since condemn
ed. The carraicres for the new metal ar
rived by railway yeoterday.and were hauled
to the barracks on Meters iiendris & ched-
den's heavy wagons. The guns are expected
to arriTe to-day or to-morrow, very little
information with regard to the work is to be
gained on the ground. The othcer in charge
on being aeked by our reporter, said be
knew little further than the facts that it
was to be a ten eun battery, and that little
he we8 not at liberty to communicate. The
work is apparently to be puehed forward in
great Basic, two Iiuuurcu ucu ucutg uoaireu
every day for the purpose. They receive
extra pay for the labor, and appear exceed
ingly anxious to be employed.
It ii reported at the garrison that it ia in
tended to extend the fortifications along the
I bank of the lake to the new fort, planting
ba teries in .all for thirty-six heavy cannon;
and that, m addition, a neavy oanery is io
be erected on the northwest angle of the
fort, overlooking the ravine and command
ing the Great Western and Northern Rail
ways.
It is also reported tnat tents ior ten tnou-
sand men are to be erected on the common,
between the two forts; and that works are
to be constructed at the eastern end of the
city, somewhere in the neighborhood of the
Dan river.. What truth there ism these ru
mors we have no reason of judging, but
they,rrobab!y arise from the fact of the
eounL-il of militarv authorities lately held
at Quebec, and the recent visit of His Ex-
cellencv the Commander of the forces in
this city. '
The Secretary of War and tne Pol
icy of t be Lincoln Administration
-The Slaves of "liebele" to bo
Armed and Set Free.
There are $1,000,000,000 worth of slave
property in the "rebel" States; "the
slave property in the South is justly sub
jected to-all the consequences of this re
bellious war ;" it would be madness to
leave the Southern people in the posses-
sion tneir slave property ; wnen tne
slaves are taken from their masters, as
the Government cannot hold them as
property, and it would houseless and ex
pensive to hold them as prisoners of war,
M it is Oiz riglity aid may "became (he duty of
the government to abjc and equip them,
and employ (heir services against the rebels f
and after the war, all such negroes
will be justly entitled to freedom and
the special protection of the Govern
ment!
These are some of the propositions of
Mr. Camebos, the Secretary of War at
Washington!.
And Mr. Camxeon speaks f r the whole
Administration. . If a majority of the
Cabinet did not approve these recom
mendations, Mr. Camebon would be
promptly dismissed. If any one member
of the Cabinet did not approve them, he
would withdraw from the Administra
tion. If the President himself did not
agree with Mr. Camebojt, he would not
lave 6ent this report to Congress at all.
That Mr. Cajieeon speaks for the Prei
dent and other members of the Cabinet,
s admitted as a fact which cannot be de
lied, by the friends of the Administra
ion. The Louisville Journal of the 6th
nst publishes the Beport, and says: .
"As respects the question of slavery,
the report confirms our worst apprehen
sions. And the most grievous fact of all
is that the report on this head can only
be regarded as an expansion of what the
President says in the same relation. . Hit
report of the Secretary is of course sanctioned
by the President. What is said by the one
concerning slavery is but an illumination
of what is said by the other. ; The Sec
retary in this respect is no worse than the'
President, and the President is no better
than the Secretary.'
: We demand of the people of Kentucky,
that they read the message of the Presi
dent and the Beport of hia Secretary
both of which have been published in
the Courier and we appeal to them by
the memories of the past and the hopes
of the future to meet the dreadful issue
thrust upon thea with the spirit of men.
' The infernal purpose' of ( .the -tyrant
Usurper and hii advisers is avowed.-
Backed by the bayonets of his armies,
the President feels strong enough to defy
the latent patriotism of his section, and
proclaims his lone-settled purpose to !
sweep away all the barriers of the Con
stitution and all the defences of civil
liberty. -
And to the South, who foresaw his
intentions and the effecls of Northern
bnaticism, and barely in time to- k steps
r the presvation of their liberties, he
otnes with fiie and sword, proclaims
.reedomto the slaves, and -u arms and
equips " the emancipated negroes for the
re-enactment of the dreadful scenes ot
St Domingo.
Men of Kentucky, you must take up
arms for liberty, dearest boon of Heav
en; but while hguting for the privileges
of freemen, you must also strike with
strong arms in defence of your wives and
little ones, upon whom the Administra
i '
tion proposes to turn loose an ignorant
and licentious horde of slaves in whom
lust and vengeance has been stimulated
by abolition appeals, and into whose
hands guns have been put by the agents
of. a government which yet pretends to
be civilized!
Wherever this fiendish policy shall be
carried out, which will bo on every foot
of Southern soil where the armies of the
administration shall get power, the inno
cent and the guilty will suffer alike.
The slaves of the loyal " and the " dis
loyal" will alike be -emancipated and
armed. And when the freed negroes
shall be turned loose, - who believes they
rill discriminate between the friends of
he North and those of the South ?
The issue is no longer disguised. The
lour in trhich it must be met, has arrived
fo delay, fellow-citizens of Kentucky, is
yqually criminal and fatal. The answer
to the defiance of the administion must
be given now. Let it be from your rifles.
Xbe Difference.
The following extract from a letter from
Washington to the Cincinnati Times, most
significantly indicates the difference of feel
ing, motiTe and action that animates the
women of the two sections. The difference
between the men ia equally as great, as
erery battle field has attested : .
And now that blankets are the subiect.let
me digress to refer to the recent appeal of
tne government ror donations of these in-
dupenaible comforts. The meager response
made by Northern women to this call is. bv 1
itself, evidence that the South is more in
earnest than the North; at least, it feels
mtre keenly ihe necessity of the crisis. It
ia known that scarcely a Southern matron
irou auu nau io mo uranae possesses a
spare blanket. All surplus contents of the
family chests and drawers have tone to
comfort tho shirerinerebil army. But the
women or the opulent and thrifty North
the 5,000,000 housewives of the North find
heart to distribute among their patriot
brothers only thirty-fire hundred of the 20.-
vw.vvu oiansieis in their- possession.
The Abolition Congress Its Sesalon.
The following from the Chicago Tribune
ofjhe 4th, pretty clearly indicates the
spirit of the present abolition Congress :
The proceedings of Cooereea TesterdaV
indicate pretty stern work. The seTerest
... - -
measures for the conduct of the war will be
adopted, and it is evident from the temper
of the house, as illus rated yesterday, so
far from constituting any ground of ob
jection to a policy, will add to the chances
of us adoption. ' We may look, therefore,
for legisUtion of the most unmistakable and
deoided character, not only on slavery but
upon all other questions connected with the
war. There will be no triflng, but action
of the most earnest kind.
The progress of the war during the nast
six months demonstrates what few even of
our most sagacious statesmen foresaw that
the struggle is not an ephemeral distur
bance, to be settled in six or twelve months
but a tremendous war that may last three
years, and call for the exertion of all the
nation's strength, and all the neode's cow
er of endurance...
A contet-t tor life cannot, in the nature of
things, be a trivial thing: and, in this ca9e,
the struggle of the nation for existence
against a conspiracy meditated and planned
ror years, ana executed with the most ei-
gantic and complete appliances, must nec
essarily be desperate, and perhaps pro
longed. Congress has arrived at a percep
tion of this truth, - and will, at the present
session, shape its measures and deelare its-
policy therewith.
e trust, however, that Consrress will be
oareful not to do any thin? rash under a
mistaken conviction of its severity The
present hour calls for wisdom, as well as
ior energy wisaom to -economise tne na
tion's strength and direct it, with the least
waste, to the end in view. -We have al
ready been too reckless in the management
of the wartoo wasteful of our resources,
and too profligate of our strength.. .
We have a prodigious army, in the field,
and a prodigious fleet on the sea; but much
of the rigor of both these arms has been
expended in un concerted and inharmonious
movements, which have led us but a league
or two into the enemy's country, and have
fallen far short of the work such powerful
forces might accomplish if steadily, judici
ously and unswervingly directed to a defin
ite object. .
Henceforth" there should be a stricter
economy, not only of oar expenditures, but
of our forces; and it will be the duty of
Congress to insure this by divesting the
war of all extraneous issues, and directing
the forces of the. country to the naked ob
ject of promptly, permanently, and effsQt
sally suppressing tht rtbeilioa.
