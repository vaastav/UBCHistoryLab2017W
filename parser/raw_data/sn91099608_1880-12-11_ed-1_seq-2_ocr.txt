f|v 8ATUBDAY, DECEMBER11,1880.
Representative Kelley, ol Pennaylva
nia, has prepared a substitute for the
I refunding bill, now pending before con
gress. It provides that the secretary
the treasury shall be authorized to issue
notes to the amount of $400,000,000 of
denominations not less thau $100, bear
ing interest at a rate not exceeding three
per cent per annum, redeemable at the
pleasure of the United States, after one
year, and payable in ten years from the
date of issue, but not more of said notes
shall be redeemed in any one fiscal year
than the amount of the sinking fund for
that year, and the particular notes to be
redeemed from time to time Bhall be de
termined by lot under such rules as the
secretary of the treasury shall prescribe.
This will be offered by Representative
Kelley as a substitute when the Wood
refunding bill is called up.
A meeting of the citizens of Fargo
was held last Monday night at which it
was agreed that the division of Dakota
was desirable upon the seventh standard
parallel and the conclusions of the meet
ing were forwarded to Delegate Bennett,
The seventh standard parallel is the
dividing line between the counties of
Bamson and Day, La Moure and Brown,
Logan and McPherson and Emmons and
Campbell. By making this the bound
ary line between the two sections no
change would be necessary in county
lines. Dividing the territory upon the
proposed forty-sixth parallel, which lies
about five miles north of the seventh
standard parallel, would place five
sixths of the lower tier of townships in
Emmons, Logan, LaMoure, Ransom and
Richland counties in southern Dakota
and the balance of these counties in
northern Dakota. It would not only
cause an inconvenient patching up of
townships, but would cut in twain
numerous farms, placing a fragment in
each of the states that are to be. These
are the causes which impel the people
of Fargo to desire division upon the
seventh standard parallel.
The following item, sent out from
Washington as an associated press tele
gram, is causing some anxiety among
the people of the north:
Delegate Bennett introduced a bill to-day to
admit Dakota as a state. The bill provides
also for the division of the territory, making
the boundaries of the proposed new state to
include that portion of the present territory
lying south of the forty-seventh degree of
north latitude.
It can hardly be doubted that the
agent of the associated press made a
mistake in writing the number of the
parallal which it is proposed to make
the line of division, and that Delegate
Bennett's bill names the forty-sixth in
stead of the forty-seventh parallel. The
Fargo Argus, the exponent of northern
sentiment, is inclined to take this view
of it, though it has its suspicions, as can
be seen from the following paragraph
from its columns:
The 47th parallel runs a little north of Fargo
and Bismarck. Can it be possible that it is pro
posed to tack these cities and the line of the
Northern Pacific railroad to the tail of south
ern Dakota's kite, and cut ns off from our
friends of the northern counties? The Argus
trusts that a mistake has been made in trans
mitting the report, and refrains from saying
anything further until the news shall nave
been corroborated or otherwise. There are
features about the movements accompanying
this latest admission scheme which suggest
watchfulness on the part of our people, ni
ted and rapid action will protect the interests
of north Dakota now indifference might lead
to results that would be regretted, perhaps,
when too late.
Without any actual knowledge upon
the subject, it is our firm belief that
Delegate Bennett's bill does not con
template any such division as the tele
graph credits him with. He fully
understands the wishes of the people
and is not the man to act in opposition
thereto.
There is no class of officials appointed
by the president who are more inade
quately paid than the judges sent out to
administer law and justice in the popu
lous territories. Each has his special
field of labor and must conduct courts in
various counties of his district and in ad
dition must hold two general semi-annu
al terms of the United States court for
his entire district. Then as often as
twice each year these judges come to
gether as the supreme court of the terri
tory and go through with seasons of la
borous mental work and research. For
all this they have' been receiving the
modest recompense of $2,600 per annum,
or less than one-half the money return
their legal attainments would bring them
in the
Bame
field as practicing attorneys.
Taking our own (the second) judicial
district as a sample of the rest,
it can be readily seen that territo
rial judges as a class give double
the yalue of their recompense in
solid work upon the bench. From one
year's end to the other one court or an
other is almost constantly in session and
the presiding judge is expected to take
time between two days to Bearch author
ities, and prepare eleborate and correct
opinions which shall go down to posteri
ty as the law of the land. There are
brief intervals between court sessions, it
is true, but they are exceedingly brief
and not at all numerouH. Instead of be
ing seasons of rest and recuperation,
they are devoted to severe mental labor
by which the presiding judge hopes to
dippose of the work which has accummu
lated and be ready to begin anew upon
matters to be developed within the court
room. During the coming fiRcal year
territorial judges will receive, probably,
salaries of $3,000, but this is too little by
abont $2,000. Lawyers of their standing
can readily secure a practice worth $5,000
per year and there is no good reason
why the government should not pay
them what they are worth.

W0 THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
A Stalwart Republican Newspaper's Opln
Ion of It.
Chioago Inter-Oeean. .,
The last annual message of President
Hayes wsubmitted to oongress yea
teraay. and is printed in full in to-day
Inter-Ooean. The paper is longer than
usual, but is of more than ordinary in
terest, owing to the fact that many of
the questions tonched upon are iu the
debatable stage, and find advooates and
opposers among men of both parties.
In a literary sense the present message
is perhaps a less admirable dooumeut
than some of the president's previous
papers but in other respects it is super
ion It is more praotical in its sugges
tions, less objectionably in it* recommen
dations, and breathes throughout a spirit
of sobered and well tempered judgment,
in pleasant contrast with the rather self
oomplaisant and over confident tone
which characterized his early utterances,
and which enabled one to read between
the lines the assuranoe that we had at
lost got a president who would correct
all evils, reform all abuses, and give the
American people an administration worth
having.
After all, there is no teacher like expe
rience, no school like that where the dif
ficulties of human endeavor and the ob
stacles to human progress come home to
a man from aotual knowledge gained iu
the conflict of practical, every-day life.
To the looker-on in this world, great
deeds seem easy of accomplishment, and
perfection in government seems only a
matter of will and authority. To the
participant, striving in the midst of the
turmoil to gain the ideal point, nothing
appears more difficult and naught so
childish as the views of the ideal
ist. To our mind, the message of
President Hayes reveals j»n advance
ment on his part away beyond the point
occupied by him at his inauguration.
His views are broader, his vision wider,
his charity greater, and his vanity less.
Fools will not gather wisdom from expe
rience great men do, and tl fact that
Mr. Hayes profited by the schooling of
his presidential term is in itself a recom
mendation. He never was so fit to be
president as now, when he is about to
toy down his office.
The message begins with a reference
to the disfranchisement of colored citi
zens in the south, and does not, as the
synopsis published yesterday would lead
the reader to suppose, "express satisfac
tion with the outlook of affairs in the
southern states." On the contrary, he
deeply deplores the reign of fraud aud
tissue ballots which have "been success
ful in defeating the exercise of the right
preservative of all rights, the right of
suffrage, which the constitution express
ly confers upon our enfranchised citi
zens."
The president truthfully says that the
failure to observe the amendments to the
constitution is "all that now stands in
the way of a complete obliteration of sec
tional lines in our political con
tests" and he no longer seems to enter
tain the hope that an appeal to the pa
triotism and gratitude of southern poli
ticians will bring abont this millennium.
On the contrary, he expresses* the hope
that congress will see to it that no mem
ber of eitner house gains a seat by rea
son of violation of the letter and spirit of
the fifteenth amendment, and declares
his purpose, if he shall receive the neces
sary aid from congress, "to prosecute
unsparingly all who have been engaged
in depriving citizens of the rights guar
anteed to them by the constitution."
While the Inter-Ocean manifests its sat
isfaction with the message on this point,
it cannot but express its regret that the
first document ol the kind sent to con
gress by Mr. Hayes did not show equal
clearness and decision upon this subject.
There will be some objection to and
probably some ridicule expended upon
hat part of the message devoted to the
subject of civil service reform. It is not
to be expected, however, that the presi
dent will abandon a favorite principle
simply because he has found it impracti
cable of enforcement during his term of
office. The theory of civil service reform
has many features to commend it, and
when Gen. Cfrant first suggested legisla
tion upon the subject ne was himself
quite sanguine that a reform could be
instituted without much difficulty that
would be most beneficial to the public
service. There are many obstacles in the
way of success, however, and one of the
chief of these is the failure of the dem
ocratic party to observe any part of the
principle wherever they are successful,
though they never fail to urge its adop
tion upon republicans. When that party
succeeded to power in the senate and
house, such a wholesale discharge oi hon
est and capable men was instituted as to
naturally excite a spirit of retaliation
and a determination to postpone all rad
ical reform in this direction until
democracy was forever relegated to
defeat. No one doubts that, hail the
democrats succeeded at the late election,
the whole patronage of the government
would have been used to strengthen and
perpetuate their tenure, and, with such
a foe to contend with many republicans
believe it dangerous to grant any favors,
even though the principle may be right
and the service would he, in individual
instances, benefitted by the "reform,"
There are many other things pro and
con to say about the practical workings
of this theory, and many questions just
now before the people which are, in the
opinion of the Inter Ocean, of more
pressing importance that progress can
be made, however, in the direction of
giving merit precedence of mediocrity
and mere political service, we think most
probable, and the remarks of the presi
dent oan therefore be accepted with can
dor, and should be treated with respect
ful consideration.
THE PONCA COAL.
•3S
Comparison of tlie rones Coal with the
Fori Dodge and Oe» Moines Measures.
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Deo.
3,1880.—T. J. Welty, esq., Dear Sir: I
completed last night the analysis of coal
from Ponca, aud I have plaoed it in a
column below, alongside of aualysis
from Fort Dodge and Des Moines, for
the sake of comparison. The Iowu coals
were analyzed by Prof. Emory, as found
in White's Geology of Iowa, vol. 2,
page 345, etc.:
Ealf
On the currency, the views of Mr.
Hayes are well known, and are expressed
in this message in substantially the same
language employed in a former commu*
mention. It is hardly likely that con
gress will venture to carry out his views,
either regarding the greenback or the
silver dollar. The people have told both
the legislative and executive departments
to let the currency alone, and both will
be wiser if that injunction shall be re
spected.
On the Mormon question the president
is surprisingly firm and positive, and ap
peals to congress to eradicate the blot of
polygamy, even if it be necessary to
change the entire form of the govern
ment of Utah territory in order to ac
complish this. He says the sect is daily
growing more powerful, is extending
into adjacent territories, and intimates
that unless sometliing be done right
speedily, serious difficulty may be en
countered in preventing its permanent
establishment.
There are many other snbjects treated
of in the message, most of them of great
public interest, and the suggestions in
the main are such as can bo heartily
commended.
The president is kind enough to re
commend the creation of the office of
captain general of the army, and recom
mends that this place be given to Gen.
Grant in recognition of his great ser
vices. A very appropriate suggestion,
but one which Gen. Grant himself would
not care, perhaps, to have made. We
donbt, indeed, if he would accept a place
which would be so needless in times of
peace, and, aside from its emolutions, of
such little consequence.
All in all, this message is the best that
has yet emanated from Mr. Hayes, and
will probably attract more attention than
I any document he has sent to congress
since his first inaugdral.

A Neighbor l'lit* in a Word iu lSeliulf of
Ilakota's Admission.
Helena (.Montana! Herald.
The scrap of news given yesterday
that the republican candidate for dele
gate in Dakota was near 1U,1KJ0, will bo
calculated to excite sometliing more than
a passing remark. People will inquire
if such is the size of the majority, what
must be the total vote, and what the
population to cast such a vote. Follow
ing up these inquiries it will appear that
Dakota has the largest area of any of
the territories, 150,932 square miles. It
would require the addition of Mas
sachusetts to make the area
of Montana equal to that of Dakota.
Three large growing states form its east
ern and soutnern boundary, Montana, to
which she has just been united by a pew
tie never to be sundered, backs her
to the west and the Dominion to the
north. Though once regarded as a cold,
dreary desert where all the waste and use
less material of creation had found a
dumping ground, exploration and devel
opment liud it rich iu various resources.
Tlie much slandered Missouri river traver
ses it diagonally with its hundreds ot
tributaries. The northwestern portion
abounds in lakes aud the lied river val
ley is one of exceeding richness. In the
southwest, the Black Hills, the Montene
gro of the United States, are full of min
eral wealth aud possess many rich and
beautiful valleys. Besides the Missouri
river, navigable throughout the
territory aud capable of being
improved into a noble channel of com
merce, already the North Pacific railroad
has been completed through it from east
to west, and three or four other roads
have reached the river aiming for the
mining district of the Black Hills.
"Her eastern gates are wide open aud
through them are streaming in a swelling
volume the hastening throngs of emi
grants from the old states and the old
world. Capital, industry, energy and
enterprise are combined to make a con
quest of this last stronghold of the great
Sioux nation. Even now her population
entitles her to immediate admission as a
state, and before another five years have
ast she will have a populetion of
a million. It is full time for
action to admit Dakota to her pioper
place as a sovereign state. The
congress just elected, we have no doubt,
will sanction the admission of Dakota as
the 39th of the United States, comple
ting the galaxy of stars on our national
banner to three times the original uum
ber that but little more than a century
since rose and clustered almost unob
served to the old world beyond the west
ern seas. Conceding the next admission
to Dakota, which will be the 40th Shall
it be New Mexico, Arizona, Washington
or Montana? There will be no great in
terval between some of these.
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.
Action Relative to the Klectorul Count Res
•1 ution.
Washington, Dee. 0.—A joint caucus
of the republican members of the senate
and house was held this evening in the
hall of the house of representatives for
the purpose of determining the party
policy in regard to the senate concurrent
resolution now pending in the house,
which provides for adopting a joint rule
to regulate the counting of the electoral
vote. Between eighty and ninety mem
bers were in attendance, and the debate,
which occupied two hours and a half,
was quite general. Among those who
took part were Senators Blain, Anthony,
Ferry and Teller and Representatives
Lapliam, Hornley, Conger, Keifer, Has
kell, Buttcrworth, UiECock, and Robeson.
The only question upon which any
difference of opinion was expressed was
to the extent to which it should be
concluded necessary or advisable to
oppose the adopttion of the pending rule.
While none of the speakers believed
there was any purpose on the part of the
democrats to attempt a revisal of results
of the recent presidential election orthat
any danger at this juncture need be
anticipated from the adoption of the
proposed rule, the majority held that
great principle was at stake, which might
at some time afreet the stability of our
institutions, and that the policy of the
party should be to meet the issue now,
and resist by every known parliamentary
method the adoption of the proposition
alike unwarranted by the constitution
and at variance with the precedent of
the past.
At the conclusion of the debate, a vote
was taken npon Judge "Lspham's resolu
tion declaring it to be the sense of the
caucus that the republican minority
should resist the adoption of this joint
rule by all the means authorized by
parlimcntarjr law, ami, wsthont dissent,
WM adopted.
A FOOLISH GIRL.
The following story i» told by •gen
tleman who is intimate with President
Hayes and President-elect Garfield, and
and whose personal truthfulness is
vouched for by the Cleveland (Ohio)
Herald:
In the little village of Bedford, only
twelve miles distant from Cleveland,
there lived, some thirty years ago, two
oharming and attractive girls. To one
of these president Hayes had beeorao
an ardent suitor but the parents of the
young lady had vigorously opposed
their courtship, on the ground that
young Hayes was poor and gave evi
dence of hardly suffioieut ability to war
rent risking their daughter's future.
The match was broken off, and the lady
is to-day married and well knowu to
Cleveland people. The other young la
dy had received some attentions from
young Garfield, and was well disposed to
reciprocate' them. Her parents, however
objected to their intimacy, giving as the
reason of their opposition the poverty of
Garfield and the anything but bright
prospccts of his future. The most
remarkable coincidences of the courtship
were that both young ladies lived in a
villnge of not more than five hundred
inhabitants, and both refused two future
Presidents of the Uuited States, because
of their proverty.

I have given above two analyses each

reports of the state of Iowa, I see that
at Fort Dodge there are four beds of
coal below the first, all of which are
thinner than the first. At the other
points, however, tlie lower beds are the
thickest. The distance between the'np
per bed and the next below is also very
variable, rangiug from forty-five to
seventy-five feet. No section is given

You see from this section that there

except the third one below, which is
often cannel coal, four to six feet thick.
The distance also from the upper to the
lower is about ninety feet, but between
the upper and the next good one below
onlv seventy-nine feet or thereabout. At

and probably much closer. Will write
