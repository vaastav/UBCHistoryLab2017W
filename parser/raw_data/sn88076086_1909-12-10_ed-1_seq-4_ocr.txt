WE HEAR Judge E. B. Goss of
the_ eighth judicial district
mentioned frequently in con
nection with the nomination
for judge of the supreme court.
He was elected to the bench
from Bottineau county and
more_ than usual interest is
therefore felt here in the mat
ter of his becoming a candi
date. Judge Goss is admirably
fitted for the position. He lias
had several years' judicial ^ex
perience, is thoroughly versed
in the law and a gentleman of
absolute integrity. This por
tion of the state .is without
representation on the supreme
bench, in fact *has been with
out representation since state
hood, and should ,j Judge Goss
decide to become a candidate
he will receive strong support,
especially so from his old
friends and neighbors ,in Bot
tineau county.
