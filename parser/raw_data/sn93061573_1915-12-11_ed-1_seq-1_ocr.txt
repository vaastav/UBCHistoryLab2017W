PREPAREDNESS IS PLEA
IN WILSON'S MESSAGE
President Asks Con o rem for Mer
chant Marine. Takes Shot at
I'n-Amerlean Crowd.
President Wilson's message to
congress Tuesday is characterized
hy the press of all parties as the
most interesting ' of his document
and full of timely and pertinent
suggestions. That he struck the
popular keynote in his advocation
of remedies for the many problems
now confronting the government is
evidenced by the comment of al
most the entire American press.
"His conception of Pan-Americanism"
as set forth in the message is
broad and inspiring," says the Santa
Fe New Mexican editorially, "his
plea for preparedness is sensible,
logical and business-like; his state
ments as to the need of a merchant
marine are statements whose truth
and pertinence are self-evident to
every thinking citizen; his sugges
tions as to revenue are reasonable.
Notwithstanding the restrained and
level-headed tone of the message, the
president, in his reference to citi
zens of foreign birth and foreigners
in this country who have brought
disgrace upon our nationalism by
their underhanded and unpatriotic
efforts in behalf of foreign sover
eignties, displays more feeling than
in any previous message. The e
pressions of indignation on the part
of the president, at these instances
of disloyalty and treason, will strike
an answering chord In the heart of
every patriotic American and he will
have the approval of his country
in whatever measures are taken to
enable the 'hand of our power' to
lose over these undesirable aliens.
President Wilson's arraignment of
those who 'calling themselves Am
ericans have so far forgotten them
selves and their honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympathy
with one or the other side in the
great conflict in Europe above their
regard for the peace and dignity of
the United States' is a stinging one,
and a deserved one and one more
than justified by present develop
ments in the exposure of Teutonic
plots against the 'peace and dignity'
of this country.
"It seems to us that the President's
plea for a body of citizens who will
be able when emergency arrives, to
defend their country efficiently and
promptly, is based upon the most
conspicuous common sense. His
presentation of the real American
idea of preparedness, free from ev
ery taint of imierialistic ambition
or desire for conquest or dominion,
is admirable. We believe the fol
lowing paragraph sums up well this
American spirit:
"'No one who really comprehends
the spirit of the great people for
whom we are appointed to speak
can fail to perceive that their pas
sion is for peace, their genius best
displayed in the practice of the arts
of peace. Great democracies are
not belligerent. They do not desire
or seek war. Their thought is of
individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
rensored thought thai quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in
our reckoning, or agreeable to our
principles. But just because we de
mand unmolested development and
the undisturbed government, of our
lives upon our own principles of
right and liberty, we resent, from
whatever quarter it may come, the
aggression we ourselves will not
practlne. We Insist upon security
In prosecuting our self-chosen lines
of national development. We do
more than that. We demand it also
for others."1
Lops t Qe Convention
Washington, Dee. (J. If anyone
had any last lingering doubU as to
whether Woodrow Wilson would be
the democratic nominee for the
presidency in 1910, those last lin
gering doubU would vanish after an ,
hour's milling with the Democratic
hosts who are gathering here for the
meeting of the national committee
tomorrow.
Someone was foolish enough to
start a poll of the committeemen as
they arrived from the various
states. After getting twelve straight
ballots reading "Wilson sure" and
stares as if to say, "Why ask such
a question?" the poll was abandon
ed. It only emphasizes the dead
certainty barring a most revolu
tionary upheaval of sentiment of
the renomination of the president.
The fight for the convention was
a lively one tonight, with St Louis
claiming victory. Dallas has a big
delegation here and a noisy one.
San Francisco is out of the running.
The convention will go either to St
Iritis or Chicago ana the dope on
the cards was for St. Louis to land
the democratic convention and Chi
cago the G. O. P. gathering. The St.
Louis convention committee is the
best organized and has worked more
systematically. St. Louis claimed
twenty-four votes of llfty-three, to
gether with fourteen second choices.
The light before the committee
will present one dramatic phase,
Speaker Champ Clark and Senator
Stone will present the claim of St.
Louis to the convention. Roger Sul
livan of Illinois will present the
case for Chicago. Intensity is added
to the fight because of the Baltimore
convention when Roger Sullivan
swung the Illinois delegation to Wil
son and the Clark presidential boom
went Hat.
Ton Pence, assistant to national
Chairman McCombs, will be elected
secretary of the committee. It was
reported Rolla Wells of St. Louis
would resign as treasurer. This re
port Mr. Wells most vigorously de
nied tonight. The two dates dis
cussed for the convention are June
l.i ;nd Juno 20. The earlier prob
ably will be picked.
Democrats and thousands of voters
of all parties, are for Wilson regard
less of his program, erause they be
lieve he is their one best bet. Many
ire frank enough to admit that Wil
son is stronger than the party pen
. ; a'ly.
OUTSIDERS KILLING DEER
Game protectionists in New Mex
ico are up in arms against Colorado
hunters who slide over the line into
northern New Mexico and invade
the national forests and other hunt
ing grounds for the purpose of kill
ing deer. Colorado has n three-year
closed season on deer. The protec
tionists claim that residents of Colo
rado come over the line, claim to be
residents of New Mexico, and take
out license and proceed to slaughter
the deer.
Sixty Seven American Universities
Have Latin-American Course
Albu'iuerque, N. M., Dec' 0. Sixty-seven
American universities and
colleges have added special courses
in Latin-American training during
the past year, according to a state
ment by Prof. Roscoe R. Hill, pro
fessor of history in the New Mex
ico state university, and head of the
university's new department of Latin-American
training. The state
ment came out in the course of a
general statement of opportunity in
tut in-America for young men of the
United States, and the increasingly
urgent demand for young men al
teudy trained In the language, cus
toms, history, geography and econ
omic conditions of the twenty re
I ubllcs south of the Rio Grande.
The new department of the univer
sity is now well under way and bids
fair to prove a tremenduus success.
It has aroused lively interest among
educators all over the state, who
-ee in it an inducement to Spanish,-
speaking young men to seek higher
rduoaUon. The enrollment in Prof,
hill's opurne promise to he mi

CHURCH ENTERTAINS AT
BANQUE√çIT K. P. HALL
Rev. Hum's Annual Get-Together
Meeting Attended by More than
100 Business Men
s U'"
As guests of the M. E. Church
members of the Clayton Business
Mens' Association with many invited
guests, totaling more thtfiT 100, got
together for a grand feed at the
K. P. hall Thursday night and fig
ured out that Clayton was the best
town in the world.
This meeting was one of the most
enthusiastic of its kind ever held
in Clayton. The credit for the affair
is due to Rev. Ray Ppotts Dum pas
tor of the Methodist church and
the lady members who built the
swell things to eat which were con
sumed by the hungry crew. The
hall was gayly decorated for the oc
casion with red and green streamers
and dozens of pennants. Music was
furnished by Mrs. M. R. Jones. Simon
Herzstein, thinking tne affair was
not complete without flowers, or
dered a bunch from Denver and
stood at the entrance and pinned
a carnation to each guest as they
entered. v-'
After the eats Rev. Dum as toast
master.v made a short plain talk
which had effect on the hearers of
making them view the church in
a different light. The little talk
presented a broad view of the church
and its relations to the town and
its business. Rev. Dum Advanced
the thought that the church shouhf
not be a social parasite but as wide
awake, live organization vitally in
terested in the welfare and progress
of the city, county, state and na
tion. Short pertinent upeeches were
made by Clayton's ' business men,
among them being O. P. Easterwood,
Morris Johnson, "Slats" Rankin, G.
G. Granville, II. Herzstein, W. C.
Barnhart Joe Gill, H. B. Wood
ward, Fulgencio C. de Baca, Rob't.
W. Isaacs, W. D. Kilburn, H. II. Er
rett J. W. Thompson and others.
Messrs. Errett and Thompson spoke
on the need of more school build
ings for Clayton, emphasizing the
fact that Clayton has taken on a
marvelous growth while but little
has been added to the school facil
ities in the last few years. From
beginning to end the banquet and
meeting constituted an event long
to be remembered. , S
DAIRY COWS MIGHT LURE
COSDENSORY TO CLAYTON
Butter and Cream Business Not an
Experiment but a Valuable
Asset to the Former.
An item in The News market re
port of last week sets forth a sta
ple, which from the price, would in
dicate that the demand exceeds the
supply, lowit; Butler, .10 cents per
pound.
In Kansas and Oklahoma where
dairy stock and products are more
in evidence that in Union county,
the price is somewhat lower, yet the
farmers of those slatea count their
dairy business one of the farm's
principal assets, their meal ticket
as it were.
In Union county the farm dairy
business has been woefully neglect
ed, due perhaps to the newness of
the country. Situated a we are,
within direct touch with the mar
kets, wHU world's of pasture and
feed galore it seems that farmers
are overlooking a big bet in pass
ing up this branch of the business.
Enough dairy catte in Union coun
ty would mean a milk oondensory
right here in Clayton, hence a cash
market for the product just as it
is taken from the eows.
One commendable feature of the
dairy farming business is that it is
past the experimental stage. It has
been tried in other communities
and it is a noticeable fact that lho.e
communities are prosperous. An
other feature we have noticed is
that it is largely a sido lino in farm
ing and does not interfere with other
branches of the business.
MISS EKLUNI) ENTERS CONTEST
Miss Inez Eklund has entered the
"Brains and Beauty" contest that is

years old, who recently came to
Des Moines from Farmersville,
Texas, committed suicide Wednes
day by shooting himself through
the head with a .38 calibre revolver
at the Central hotel m Des Moines.
U is reported that Mr. Spell had
been heard to state that he would
kill himself if his health did not
improve. This is the only reason
given for his act He was a member
of the firm of Harless and Spell
that recently purchased the J. F.
Branson grocery stock.

evening from Texas. She was in

CLAYTON IS HIGH PRICED MAR
KET v"

the prices paid in Clayton for horses
and mules are higher- than any
known market There has been lit
tle or no shipping of horses form
Clayton on account of the big local
demand, but according to horsemen,
that demand has been pretty well
taken care of. "
EVERYBODY'S GOT IT
It would be much easier to tell
the names of folks who have not
had the blankety-blank grippe than
of those who have been forced to
seek the bed in Clayton during the
past two weeks. All The News force
lias had a round of it and to finish
it off nice the boss. High, went down
and out Thursday. Physicians at
tribute the presence of the malady
disease or whatever it is to too much
summer in the midldo of the winter.

Clayton Business Folks Say Busi
ness Is Fine and Everybody has
Money to Spend.
There are moro people employed
in Clayton business establishments
Uxiay than ever before in the his
tory of the town.
Quite naturally proprietors of
the various businesses attribute this
condition to nothing more nor less
than increased business. .
Simon Herzstein, of the mail order
competition store, says that firm's
business shows wonderful increase
over 1911. While Mr. Herzstein
thinks his advertising campaign, in
which he heralds to the publio that
he is a mail order house competitor,
has had considerable to do with the
increase he also thinks that tho ex
tremely prosperous year coupled
with many new people coming to
Union county is largely responsi
ble. Morris Johnson, of the Otto-Johnson
company says the firm did a 100
per cent greater business in October
1915 than ir. any one prior month.
Mr. Johnson is of the opinion that
"there are more people, more stuff
raised, more money hence more
buying."
When asked how the banking busi
ness was stacking up, D. W. Priest
ley, cashier of tho First National
Bank, said collection had never been
better, and that everybody seemed
to have money to deposit Since
August 1, business has increased to
such an extent that it has been nec
essary to add one stenographer and
a bookkeeper to tho working force.
The instances cited are but exam
ples of the preyiiling condition in
every business in Clayton one hears
the same story business good and
everything lovely.
Building Will Open About January 1
Work on tho Herzstein building
is progressing rapidly. The hanging
awnings have been put into position.
The steel ceiling is being put on and
workmen who are in charge of the
pebble dash finish began work the
latter part of the week.
The entrance to the basement has
been cut and that part of the build
ing will be ready for occupancy
when the building is opened about
January 1.
When completed no other build
ing in this part of the country will
compare with it either in appearance
or modern furnishings.
Big Monday Bigger Than Usual
Big Monday in Clayton was even
bigger than usual. Hundreds of
people from over the county and
from neighboring counties in Okla
homa and Texas were here to take
advantage of tho Dargains offered
by Clayton merchants.
Farmers brought an unusually y
large amount of stuff to sell at the
public auctions. Carson's and the
People's Feed Yards were busy
places all day.
