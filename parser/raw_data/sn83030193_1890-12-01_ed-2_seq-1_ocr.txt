A man who recognized JuglrooathcKlevatcd

un Instant all eyes were turned ou the at par

others stared boldly at Idiu. 'Hie Jap was

While Jugiro was sealed lit the i rlsoner's

Jugiro lll'-n swept back Ills lung hair, which
hung down over tils forehead in a di. ordered
mass, unit for the hrst time rev tuled fully his
dark faie.
Uut he still kept his gaze riveted on the floor.
Hla l,odv swayed slowly backward and lor.

he beirayed.
'Die court-room was crowded when Judge

He objected to the puslng of sentence or

V ester day it weik, Just about Ihe time- his fate
had been det.1 led by the court uf last resort.
