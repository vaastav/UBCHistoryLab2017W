SAN JUAN. P. I.. November A, U.
Although the uvcertainty as to what form
of government they are going to have
keeps the Porto Ricans guessing as to
"where they are at," tpkey will soon have
the satisfaction of knowing how many
"they be" when Mr. Dingman. the' newly
appointed chief of the Pbrto Rican census.
shall have obtained the returns from his
ads. who are peering and prying into every
Porto Rican home and causing no Ond of
wonder in the minds of the natives as to
why Uncle Sam is so anxious to know so
much about their "age. sex and previous
condition of servitude." Now wide of the
mark some of their conjectures have gone
was shown in the recent reply of the San
Juan News to an "anxious Inquirer" as to
.'whether the collection of all of this Infor
mnation was merely prelimihary to the Im
position of taxes. The reassuring nature of
the reply, by the way, must have been
largely annulled by the recent aprlaranceI
of the order providing for the internal
revenues.
Nine hundred and forty census enumera
ters are hurrying over moor and mountain
in the endeavor to get in all the returns
within the prescribed time, that Is. by Do
comber 20. It is probable, though, that
several days of grace will be allowed them,
as the difficulties of locomotion in this
island have presented unusual problems. I
was Informed by one of the office em
ployes in San Juan that the only Instance
of a reftsal to answer the questions of the
enumerators was presented by an Ameri
canized German, whose tonrue had to be
loosed by force of law. Sometimes the
question of age has to be decided rather
approximately when the time of birth is
Rut down as the "great storm" of about
such and such a year.
The Tax Question.
In regard to the imposition of taxes, all
male adults. owners of property, agricultur
al, city, commercial or Industrial. and all
members of the liberal profession, trades
and arts pay $1 to the insular school fund.
Taxe are also levied on certificates of gov
'rnment hureaus, or of internal revenue of
fices: also on manufacturers of matches
and alcoholic beverages; on playing caris
and billiard tables. Th's. "the white man's
burden." fall also cn his beasts of burden
on horses. asses and mules. Coaches, pri
vate and public. ate vehicles of taxation.
Falling- on the Just as well as the unjust, it
attaches to street posters and to public
halls (which latter are allowed only at the
d'scretion of the alcalde). It is added to
the load of the peddler's back and Increases
the debts of the pawnbroker. It takes from
the profits of the money changers and skill
fully extracts half dimes from the "nickel
in the siot machine." The sons of Mars
and Neptune enjoy certain exemptions.
The recent elections held in towns of the
.Island have been attended by a considerable
amount of dirorder at some points, notably
at Ponce and Penuelas. Most of it seems
to have been due to a want of discretion on
the part of the police. The republicans had
the first inning in Mayaguez, and had 't23
to their credit at the end of it. Their root
ers were whoop'ng things up when the fed
erals came 'o the bat, and piled up a score
of Pf00 for their side.
Both parties acknowledge that the differ
ences between them are more of persons
thar. of princ!ples. Recent conversations
with reprerentatives of both parties have
convinced me that neither side wants
home rule-not yet, at least-candidly ac
knowledgink their unfitness for it.
The man who has probably enjoyed more
than any other the diversion afforded by
the late unpleasantness connected with the
elections is the director of ports in Porto
Rico. who until recently was drawing the
fire of both parties as a result of an order
emanating from his office by which several
towns in the island were enjoying daily
malls will be reduced to a tr-weekly ser
vice, while others will be deprived of their
Sunday mall.
Storm of Protests.
The ordcrestirred up a perfect storm of
protests. which, however, disappeared be
fore the political tempest which has been
raging recently. The charmber of commerce
at San Juan has just added Its voice of pro
test against the proposed order, and also
demands the re-establirhment of several
telegraph offlces recently closed, and longer
hours in those now in operation.
If the roads of Porto Rico do not become
ways of pleasantness it will not be through
neglect, as the department of public works,
it is said. will spend 860,000 in mending
our ways in the next year.- The United
States government has recently appro
priated from the "emergency fund" $2III.f0,4
to be uced in the repairing of the roads on
this island. and will cut off "storm ra
tions" from those towns where such money
is spent.
The orphan asylum, heretofore under the
same roof with the insane asylum, and un
der the Spanish regime supported by the
lottery. will soon be moved to our suburban
town of Santurse, where the boys and girls
will occupy the buildings formerly used as
school houses by the Escolapian fathers
and sisters of the Sacred Heart. respec
tively. This change will no doubt result in
the removal to more suitable quarters of
many of the inrane now confined in the
various jails of the island.
Educational Matters.
Matters educational still continue to ab
sorb the efforts of many and the interest of
all. The "model school," whose growth
has been much retarded by lack of lumber,
is now tinder roof, and it is hoped will be
ready for occupancy January 1. It will be
formally presented to the public about that
time. The town of Tagardo has taken the
final steps necesrary to secure the location
of the normal and training school there
by the deposit of bonds and other collateral
as its part of the contract with the insular
government. The high school at Ponce re
cently opened with an enrollment of forty,
which will no doubt grow rapidly.
The private schools also seem to be thriv
Ing, The Congregationalists, the pioneers
m the establishment of (Protestant) church
schools, will soon throw another banner to

German View of Amerlean Iron and

Mr. Frank H. Mason, United States con

State Department at length on the German

machinery and installatione. Jt Is also true
that Amerida 'lar SurpasseS hi in the use
f Iron and steel for building purposes.
"It is undeniable that the American iron
works operate under decidedly inre favor.
able conditions of production than dur own.
Amn important factor In. these conditions is
the fact that the United States possesses
rar richer and more widely distributed Iron
)re depositesthan Germany. While we are
largely 4ddbndent upon Imported ores-.
especially Swedish - the American iron
works find their raw naterial at home. To
this must be added the other Important ad
vantage. that the construction and equip
rnent of their Iron and -steel works far ex
!el those of Germany and, indeed. every
>ther European courntry. In America we
5nd what seems to us an astonishing sub
stitution of machinery for manual labor. i
)nly in the most 4ecRgsary details is hand I
abor now employed. Sueh a vast and skill.
lul application of machinery offers especial
advantage in a time like this, when manual
abor Is costly and difficult to obtain.
Low Freights.
"Finally, comes the enormous advantage
which the Americans enjoy through the
ligh develdpnent of their rall*ay system.
rhe Industries have at their coumand a
railway system which far surpasses in
:heapnesa and effleiency of service any
thing known in Europe. The first sight of
the tracks and equipment of an American
railroad makes upon a German an -mpos
ng impression. Their freight ca-'s of all
,lasses far surpass in size and carrylyig cr
iaclty those of the German railways. Their
track system is relatively broader and
stronger than ours. Special tracks for
reight trains 'secure' rapid, almost un
roken traffic. A widely developed system
if branch and side railways (feeders) sus
tains the traffic of the principal lines. The
rates for freight are excessively low.
While on the German railways the .cost of
Ereight per ton kilometer is (excepting
some unimportant special tariffs) 2.2 pfen
rigs, in America the corresponding rate iS
)nly 0.6 pfennig per ton kilometer.
"Under these conditions the German Iron
rdustry finds in that of the United States
its greatest, most important and most dan
cerous competitor. Just at present the full
Eorce of this competition In not apparent
.etause there is an enormous home de.
'nand for iron and steel in America. Sev
ral shipments of American foundry pig
ron to Germany prote, however, -that we
lave in future to reckon ith the competit
ion of American ifietbl" here at home.
Those shipments wely otgered by German
ronsumers of pig trop be, ,use they were in
irgent need of rawigjiatqfiaI. The belief
that the competition of the American iron
ndustry Is not yet to be seriously feared
may still be cherishert In ispite of the great
levelopment of tru,-tncerning whose
3roductive capacity large figures
lave been published -which It is impossible
:o verify and which are pobably exagger
ited. --
"But Where once a'relaplse occurs in the
kmeriedz- *aarket o~in wbakening of de
rand in the Wrorld'a-inef* .nyakets, then
we shall have to reckon .ith a sharp and
yowerful competition from America, espe

these in the United tes Is on an enor

To the question. How can the German I
narket protect-:Itself against the future
-ompetition of America, the following an.
iwer was given; -
"The German Iron and steel works must
lollow the American example, and by a I
,reatly enlarged use of machinery reduce I
he cost of production and protect them
selves from future contingencies in the
abor market. There is also urgently re
juired for our industry much lower freight
rates and the construction of special lines I
and extra tracks for freight traffuc. In this
espect, also. America is a model and ex
tmple for us to follow. The construction
)f canais, which will offer a cheaper
nethod of transportation, can Indeed be of
idvantage. but can only be considered a
)alllative, not a remedy,'
