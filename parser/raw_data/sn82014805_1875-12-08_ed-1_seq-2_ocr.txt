THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The constitution provides tnat the
President shall,"from time to time, give
to the Congress information of the
state of the Vniou.It is probable that
President Grant bud this duty in hia
mind when he sat down to write his last
Message, and it i t«> be regretted that
he had consulted the "state of the
Union" so imperfectly llis Message is
anything else than elegant, and abounds
in bad English. This might be excusa
ble in an under .*<** rotary, but in a docu
ment heralded forth as having been
mler tlu* consideration of the Cabinet,
it is abomin.il »le. Still worst» and more
objectionable is it,l > lind such a docu
ment entirely i'al. t in geographical al
lusions. l\r instance the President
opens in a sort of grand-eloqnent strain,
iu which he sa>

St. Boris, Dec. 5.—The Grand .fury
found an inun-tnient against Gen. Hab
cook on 1 i iday evening last, and it would
have been relumed to court vosterdav

Congress.
i n the United States
Senate yesterday Ex Governor James
L. English was admitted to the seat
made vacant by the death of O. S.
J erry. The organization of the House
was announced, and a committee
appointed to wait on the President.
After the Message was read reports
irom Cabinet officers and from the
Comptroller of the Currency were
* ubmitted. Iu the House Mr. Blaine
made a personal explanation in regard
to his remarks of Monday. The usual
drawing for seats was gone through
with, and the Presidents Message
read. The Senate adjourned until to
• lay, and the House until Friday.

,.r a. i , ' / " ,rcr sa J' s :
Lord, Lord, how th;s world is given
to stealing! Here comes a pension
ring in the City of Brotherly Love
that has encircled a million ot dollars
annually for several years. Of course
a representative of the l nited States,a
clerk, was one of the thieves. No first
class piece of art in stealing from the
government can be executed without
the inspiration of the approving last
touches of a representative of tho
I nited States.
Of the twenty-six who have held the
Speakership of Congress, only six are
now living, namely : Hunter, Winthrop,
Bmks, Grow, Colfax and Blaine. Hun
ter is State Treasurer of Virginia, Banks
and Blaine aro in Congress and the
others are in private life.
The health of Hon. A. H, Stephens of
Georgia, is still on the decline. ^
Tilt- Krad« I of flic Hr|iuhliaiii t ,
Tbc N. Y. '/r.'hune has undertaken
to instruct Mr. Blaine, the Republi
can leader ia the House and does it in
the following flattering style:
It will not do for Mr. Blaincto earn
estly oppose the Democratic rage for
investigation, and yet ho cannot he
expected to cooperate m movements
clearly intended to destroy his party's
chance of winning the Presidential
battlo. To know just where to draw
tlia line between passive assent to the
programme of his adversaries and re
sistance to it will tax his utmost sagac
ity. If lie
programme of cutting down expenses,
he will appear to abandon the cause of
the minority; if he opposes it, he will
be open to the charge of favoring ex
travagance. Whatever damages the
Administration wifi indirectly dam
retd to the Democratic
age him, because it will make the vie
tory of the Uepubiicatte next year
more doubtful, and yet to exert him
self to shield the Administration would
clearly make him unpopular. If the
third term project should still show
signs of life, Mr . Blaine could not be
expected to leel badly about disclos
ures tending to break down the candi
dacy of tlcu. Grant, and yet such dis
closures would seriously uffect the
party, and would therefore call'for
Buch excuses of palliation as the Re
publican leader in the house could
furnish. It is evident that the situa
tion is hedged around with the most
puzzling dilemma.-. If anybody can
lintl a safe way out of them, however,
and pluck lautels from these thorns of
difficulty, Mr. Blaine is the man. Fer
tile in resources, bold and sudden in
action, a master of parliamentary
strategy, ready in debate and strong
in argument, and carrying with him
the prestige of six years in the chair,
lie will have no antagonist capable ol
crossing swords with him, and will
often confound the raw and clumsy
Democratic majority.
As the lawyers say, that story is
very good until the otter side appears,
We have no apprehensions that Mr, 1
. ...
Blaine will not meet his equal from
the Democratic side. That he is there,
'
we are confident,and that Mr. Blaine's
argument in favor of Radicalism and
negroism, will be shown to be all de
lusive, we have mo doubt whatever.
The indictment of Gen. Babcock is
all the more significant, in view of the
official telegram, jointly signed by the
Secretary of the Treasury ami the At
torney General, and seat from Wash
ington to the United States District I
Attorney at St. Louis, on the 2d inst-, I
■'directing him to ute ettry effort t" '
prerent the implication of any innocent i
perton in the conspiracy to defraud the
Government, but to spare no one who
is guilty.
It is fair to presume that tie District
Attorney obeyed this order from his'
official superiors,and used every effort
to prevent the implication of any in
nocent person; and yet, it seems he
did not prevent the implication of
Babcock.
We have now
