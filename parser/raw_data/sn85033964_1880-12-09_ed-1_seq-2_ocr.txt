Tlie President's Message.'
Mr. Ilayes sent in his annual message
to Congress Monday. It is a volumi
nous document and would be mighty
poor rending if a man had anything
else to peruse. lie begins by charging
the South with fraudulent practices at
the late election in denying voters the
right of "freely casting their votes,"
and goes on with this sort of fol de rol
regardless of the fate of Ananias and
Sapphira. lie is caretul, however, to
make no allusion to the systematic co
ercion and bulldozing practiced by his
own party in the Northern states.
The message recommends the sup
pression of polygamy in Utah'and sug.
gests the dUfranchisment of all who
practice it; it reports favorable rela
tions with foreign powers, and referring
to the development of foreign com
merce suggests "modifications of our
regulations of trade and navigation"
and subsidies to steamship lines as helps
to secure that trade. A summary of the
finances is given showing surplus reve
nue to the amount of $90,000,000, and
the message recommends the applica
tion of this amount to the reduction of
the public debt. It also urges the com
pletion of tho refunding operations and
reduction of interest; the retirement of
the greenback circulation and the
coinage of silver dollars "of equiv
alent value as bullion, with gold dol
lars." The latter proposition is, of
course, in the interest of the National
banks. After recommending with some
degree of warmth the improvement of
the Mississippi river and tributaries, as
an imperative result of the success ol
the jetties, and touching upon a multi
tude of minor matters, the gentleman
who is drawing Mr. Tilden's salary

THE COTTON CROP.
Woful News of its Condition.
Memphis Appeal, 3rd inst.
Our Southern country exchanges
ifive woful tidings as to the condition
of cotton remaining unpicked in the
field. The Dremature appearance o
winter has had a very serious effect and
materially shortened the supply; esti
niatora of the total crop are reducing
their figures. The following are spec!
mens ol the sort of intelligence that
reaches us from every quarter. The
Camden (Ark.) Beacon says: "Many
farmers 'ell us the bulk of the cotton is
still in the fields, and is rotting rap-
Idlv." Drew county ;Ark.) Monticel
Han: "Owinir to the unfavorable
weather not more than one-half of the
cetton cron has been gathered in cer
tain localities." "Ihe Ouachita (La.)
Telegraph says they nave had snow,
aud adds respecting the cotton crop
"Although there will be little over i
third of a crop made, so unfavorable has
been the weather that it will not be
gathered before the year is out." Vicks
burir Herald: "The co'-ton crop has
been iuiured in quality and quantity
thirty-three and a half percent, at the
very least in the last lew days. If the
rain should cease now the ground is so
soft in the fields that days would elapse
before picking could be successfully
conducted. The quantity knocked out
and blown out must be very large;
the quality of that remaining is serious
ly injured, ana no one can say when tne
weather will te suitable to gainer u.
Helena (Ark.) leunian: "As all are
aware, the unprecedented rainlall of the
season has caused lrom one-third to
oiio-halt of the cotton to be in the field
unuicked. As it is with you, so.it is
with a larire portion ol ths cotton belt
I'lie Question with you now is : "How
shall I gather the balance of my crop?
It has be-n suggested oy a cotton man
in Helena that those who could do so
procure good rubber boots at once for
both males and females to wear to the
field. If the feet are kept warm and
dry, by wearing these rubber boots, it
is probable that a large portion of the
crop now in the field can yet be gath
ered. Try this plan ; we think it a feas
ible one." Little Rock Gazette : "The
unfavorable weather of November has
left thousands upon thousands of acres
of the plant untouched, and unless De
cember and January 6hould prove
much more propitious than usual, the
decrease in the production and conse
quent loss to the planters will be almost
ruinous. The Wittsburg (Ark.) Chron
ielesays: "The cotton crop of Cross
county is greatly damaged by the long
continued bad w eather." This is the
unpleasant news that comes from every
quarter of the State, adds the Little
liock Democrat. The ' reports from
other cotton States are equally unfavor

A Letter from Rev. S. II. Cherry.
Messrs. Editors: The Citizen is a
most welcome weekly visitor to the
Methodist parsonage at Mt. Pleasant.
rVife, boys, and paterfamilias are all
eager to read the news from Giles.
Few know how to appreciate the real
worth of a county paper while getting
it weekly at home in their own county,
as few who enjoy continued good health
esteem the blessing like those who are
long sick. We have a mail every morn
ing and evening by the Nashville and
Florence railroad, which runs a train
twice daily irom bere to Columbia,
twelve miles distant; rare only fifty
cent for the round trip, or just a frac
tion over two. cents per mile; hence the
amount of railroad travel from here to
Columbia, to me, seems really astonish
ing. The coach is nearly always full
of passengers. I presume two cents
per mile pays the company more In the
lonz run than five cents would. Hands
are busy grading the road three miles
beyond here, near tne Lawrence line,

This is the livest business town of its
size I have seen for some vears. Wag
ons from the factories ana lurnaces ot
Wayne and Lawrence counties bring
quantities of pig iron nd bales of thread,
cloth, and other articles for shipment.
More cotton and bogs are sold here than
I expected. Mules are so numerous be
tween here and Columbia that if 1
should state the average number on
each farm your readers might be in
credulous. Fifty mule colts feeding in
a single field of rye, barley or clover, is
no rare sight. Such splendid barns I
have seen nowhere else in Tennessee or
the South. Of course the homes of the
citizens are generally beautiful and at
tractive.

It is a beautiful lane almost the entire

each side. What enhances the beauty
and value of the lands is their high state
ol cultivation and improvement. An
equal amount ot care, labor and atten

make them nearly equal in loveliness

The Stock Sals.
The Fair Directors met Saturday
last. Caul. J. K. 1 . Blackburn, on
account of the growing demands of
private business, resigned the vice
presidency of the association and
also his position as a member ot
the board. His resignation was ac
cepted with reluctance, as he has
been most efficient in both posi
tions, aid the vacancies were tilled
by the election of Mr. William F.
Ballentine as vice-president acd
Mr. R. C. Reynolds as director.
A committee was appointed to
interview all stock men in the coun
ty and to urge them to meet with
the board on the 1st Saturday in
January to determine whether
there shall be a permanent sale of
live stock in the spring of each
year, the day of sale to be fixed by
the board of directors.
w e desire
to urge upon our stock men the
importance of meeting with the
board at the time specified, whether
personally solicited to do so or
not. These sales will be of great
benefit to them and we hope they
will see that it is manifestly to
their interest to have them re estab
lished. We expect to discuss this
matter at greater length on another
occasion.
