TIIK PRESIDENT'S MESSAUE.
The message of President Cleveland
gives the reader the impression that its
author is satisfied with himself and his
administration, and Is on terms of peace,
with all the world. . There is not a word
to show that he is affected by the criti
cisms upon his administration and the
personal assaults on him by thousands
of angry men in his own party who
charge upon him the responsibility of
the result of Nov. 6. The recollection of
Hill, Gorman. Vest and others does not
disturb his serenity. Doubtless he has
come to the conclusion that they have
been sufficiently punished. In short.
there is not a word in the message
which his foes in his own party can
make the basis of a personal assault.
Indeed, there is not a word to intimate
that Mr. Cleveland has heard that his
party was overwhelmed and his admin
istration condemned in the election last
month.
More than most annual messages, this
paper is a condensation of the reports
of subordinates, abstracts of the most of
which have already been published.
About one-fourth of the entire message
Is devoted to foreign matters, and is
merely a recital of our relations with
them and what the State Department
has been doing or attempting to
strengthen the ties which bind us to
other nations and to protect American
citizens and their Interests in other
lands. The briefest possible allusion is
made to the ill-timed letter to Japan dep
recating war with China, and to the re
buff the administration received in re
sponse to its offer to mediate. No one
would ever suspect from the message
that the work of the State Department
has been more generally criticised than
any other branch of the public service.
If the President has had differences with
Secretary Carlisle and has ignored hirr.
in any respect, he has fully atoned there
for in his most cordial indorsement of
his plan for improving the currency. The
It esident's emphatic approval of the
competitive system in the civil service
would meet with a more genuine ap
proval if it were not a notorious fact
that in several departments, notably
in the Treasury, the spirit, if not the let
ter, of the law has been ignored. The
special recommendations of the Presi
dent will be considered from time to
time; but. in general, it may be said
that while it is not an able paper and
will not invoke antagonisms, -as have
some of his previous messages, it gives
Congress and the country a Clear Idea
of the condition of public affairs, and
shows that, in the President's estima
tion, his administration needs no de
fense. The dignified manner with which
he presents public affairs will insure for
Mr. Cleveland's message candid pe
rusal, and for himself personally some
mitigation of the asperities which gen
eral features of his administration have
created in his own as well as in other
parties. The spirit of the message
shows that adversity has its uses.
TUB ADMI.MSTRATIOVS CTRHEXCY
SCHEME.
The all-Important feature in the Presi
dent's message is its currency scheme.
As it is the all-important feature of the
message, the Journal puts it in the be
ginning, while Mr. Cleveland uses it
for a conclusion. Preliminary to the
presentation of the currency scheme, the
President indulges in some assertions
which would lead to the inference that
the two issues of bonds were necessary
only to keep up the gold reserve, which
has been depleted in the redemption of
greenbacks and treasury notes. In an
other part of the message the President
observes that the receipts of he treas
ury were $69,803,260.58 less than the gov
ernment's expenditure during the fiscal
year which ended last June. The defi
cit has, been proportionately much
larger each month since June., so that
the aggregate to the end of last month
must have been over $100,000,000. The
greenbacks and treasury notes redeemed
with the gold reserve have been paid out
to meet current expenditures, so if bonds
had not been issued to keep up the gold
reserve the government would have
been compelled to borrow money to meet
current expenses or to suspend their
payment. Therefore, it is fair to assume
that the depleted treasury had a potent
Influence in the depletion of the gold re
serve. If it had' not been for the pro
vision of the resumption act authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to sell
bonds to keep up the gold reserve. Con
gress at its last session would have been
compelled to authorize a loan or the
treasury would have suspended pay
ment. The experience of the country during
the past two years must have satisfied
all intelligent men who are not the vic
tims of the flat money heresy that the
President is right when he says the
government should go out of the bank
ing business. Perhaps the most com
mendable feature of the Carlisle cur
rency scheme is that it makes the de
posit of greenbacks and treasury notes
take the place of United States bonds as
security for the circulation of the banks.
If 30 per cent, of the circulation of
banks is deposited in the treasury in
greenbacks and other legal-tender notes
as security for the redemption of bank
notes, there will not be enough of them
in general circulation to be collected
and used to deplete the gold reserve. In
deed, there is reason to believe that in
the course of two or three years there
would be no" use for a gold reserve to
redeem the government's outstanding
notes. .
In regard to the further details of Mr.
Carlisle's scheme." It is entitled to can
did consideration, except the sop which
he throwsto the South in favor of the
issue of notes by State banks. In a na
tion, all the . issues of credit money
should be under the supervision of the
national government. If a banking cor
poration has objections to getting its
notes through the federal government,
there is reason to suspect that it has
ulterior motives which are hostile to a
sound currency. The first -thing to be
secured in a bank of issue is the safety
of the holders of the notes. Secretary
Carlisle's plan Aimlts the issue of banks
to 75 per cent. oT their paid-up stock. To
redeem its notes in case of suspension or
failure there would be a deposit of 30 per
cent, of the volume of each bank Issue
in the legal-tender notes of the United
States. In addition to this general se
curity a safety fund of one-half of 1 per
cent, is required of all the banks each
year until the fund amounts to 5 per
cent, of the total circulation mttrtondlng
with which to further redeem the notes
of failed banks. In addition to this, the
indebtedness of the bank for circula
tion is a first Hen upon the assets of the
bank. These provisions, with the lia
bility of the stockholder to the amount
of his stock for the security of the note
holder, seem to be ample. The fact
that banks are required to redeem their
notes in legal-tender money insures a
stable currency, and is a standing check
upon, overissue.
There will be those who will make
haste to condemn the Carlisle scheme,
but those who have been convinced that
the time has come for a change in our
currency system will giveit candid consideration.
The recommendation of the President
that General Schofield may be given the
rank of lieutenant-general before he re
tires, thus increasing his compensation
for life, furnishes a contrast'to another
declaration of Mr. Cleveland that the
bounty and pay received by the enlisted
man were so large that he was paid for
all his service unless injured to an ex
tent which disabled him from earning
his bread.
Most people will agree with the Presi
dent in his opinion favoring the repeal
of the one-eighth of 1 cent a pound dif
ferential for the advantage of the sugar
refiners' trust. It costs less than 75
cents per hundred pounds to refine su
gar, and refined sugar is worth over a
dollar a hundred more than the raw. A
clear profit of .23 cents a hundred Is
enough and protection enough.
John Burns, the English labor leader,
nays he cannot talk fairly of American af
fairs, as it would take years of work for
him to become . familiar aith them. Such
modesty in an English visitor Is phenome
nal, and encourages the belief that when
he does talk he will have something to say
worth listening to; also, that when he goes
home after his six weeks' tour he will not
write a book telling his countrymen all
about us. '
It la likely that the respectable members
of the House of Representatives cared less
for the masses of flowers on their desks
after they saw that even Colonel Breckin
ridge had received roses galore from admir
ing friends. The "floral tribute" business
in Congress is in danger of becoming ridic
ulous. ' '
Governor Waite evidently cherishes the
opinion that he is the Parkhurst of Colo
rado, but, unfortunately, he seems unable
to get anyone to agree with him.

ABOUT THE APPORTIONMENT.
It la the Dnty of the ComlnK Legisla
ture to 31nke n Just Law.
To the Editor of the InJv.apolis Journ.il:
It may be unwarrantably venturesome
for a layman to ca 1 in question the opin
ion of so eminent aid learned a lawyer as
Judge Chambers, but sometimes a convic
tion of what ought to be law may be the
key to what the law is. In the early days
of our Republic the construction of the
Constitution, as given In legislative acts
by the men who framed the Constitution,
was conclusive of its meaning when the
language was ambiguous or obscure.
Our Constitution plainly provUes that
every sixth year, beginning with 18."7, the
Legislature shall apportion the members
of each branch among the several coun
ties according to population, but it does
not forbid such an apportionment at other
tiroes. What this meant to the framers,
contemporaneous statesmen and Jurists set
tled long ago. The Legislature of 1S55, be
ing Republican in both houses, the Demo
crats, by Democratic means, prevented the
apportionment. The leaders of the Demo
cratic party in each house had been mem
bers of the constitutional convention only
four years before, and it is fair to pre
sume that they understood the meaning
of the Constitution ;vhlch they had formu
lated. It would hardly have been consist
ent wMh their oaths of office to have left
an imperative duty unperformed if the Con
stitution had required an apportionment
then or never. Consistent with this Demo
cratic exposition of the Constitution by
the men who formulated it, the legislators
of 1ST7. Democratic in both branches, ap
portioned the State for the remaining four
years and no longer, recognizing so much
of the Constitution as calls for an appor
tionment every six years, and that appor
tionment was acquiesced in by all the
statesmen of that period. Why should It
now be unconstitutional to apportion the
State at other than the sextennial period?
It is a fundamental doctrine of Ameri
can Jurisprudence that though the people
may convey to the government, in the form
of a Constitution, a certain portion of their
fower; the fee simple of power remains in
hemserves and they have a right to as
sert, it at pleasure. If for any reason the
Legislature of 1891 had wholly neglected to
apportion the State, the Legislature of 1S9S
had . a right to do it, and it was a duty,
and that without the intervention of any
court. It would be the same if. pretending
to apportion the State, they had plainly
violated the Constitution. To have given
Marion county one Representative and
Dearborn county six. or ten, or twenty,
would have been no -more of a violation of
the Constitution than to give two to Frank
lin, with less than population enough for
one. It would have been a little more con
spl?udus, that Is all.
Nothing is better established In State
craft than that the prescribing of a given
method of doing a thing does not exclude
other methods. This was fought to a finish
In the hlaiory of our present Constitution.
Because the old Constitution prescribed a
method of calling a convention to revise
the Constitution there were those, forty to
fifty years ago. who contended that a con
stitutional convention could be called in no
other way. But the peopk-. in the exercise
of their reserved fee simple, called the con
vention, and our present Constitution Is
the result.
We are precisely in the condition to-day
that our fathers were In 18C7. The Demo
crats of 1833 had prevented a constitutional
apportionment, and Governor Wright had
improvised an apportionment for the occa
sion, under which a legislature. Democrat
ic in both houses, was elected. No tender
footed Democrat protested that an appor
tionment then would be unconstitutional-.
Why fhould he now? To the average
layman It Is plain that the legislatures of
ISUl and 1S1M, having neglected to apportion
the State according to population, it 13 as
much the duty of the present Legislature
lo do this as It was that of 1S57 to appor
tion the State, and the Supreme Court or
any other court has no need to dictate,
even if it has a right to. , U. L. SE'fcL .

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
(Concluded from Second Page.)
wise and patriotic men wro laid the founda
tions of our free lnstltut ons, and I invite
distribution of public places as rewards of
partisan activity. Numerous additional
offlces and places have- lately been brought
within civil-service rules and regulations,
and some others will probably soon b
included. The report of the commissioners
will be submitted to the Congress and I
invite careful attention to the recommend
ations it contains.
I am entirely convinced that we. ought
not to be longer without a national board
of health or national health officer, charged
with no other duties than such as pertain
to the protection of our. country from the
invasion of pestilence and disease. This
would involve the establishment by such
board or officer of proper quarantine pre
cautions, for the necessary aid and coun
sel to local authorities on the subject,
prompt advice and assistance to local
boards of health or health officers in the
suppression of contagious disease and in
cases where there are no such local boards or
officers, the immediate direction by the
national board or officer of measures of
suppression; constant and authentic in
formation concerning the health of foreign
countries and all parts of our own country
as related to contagious diseases and con
sideration of regulations to be enforced in
foreign ports to prevent the introduction
of contagion Into our cities and the measures
which should bs adopted to secure their en
forcement There seems to be at this time
a decided inclination to discuss measures
of protecton against contagious diseases
in international conference with a view of
adopting means of mutual assistance. The
creation of such a national health estab
lishment would greatly aid our standing in
such conferences and improve our oppor
tunities to avail ourselves of their bene
fits. I earnestly recommend the Inaugura
tion of a national board of health or sim
ilar national instrumentality, believing the
same to be a needed precaution against
contagious disease and in the interest of
the safety and health of our people.
By virtue of a statute of the United
States, passed in 1S8S, I appointed In July
last Hon. Jean D. - Kernan, of the State
of New York, and Hon. Nicholas E. Worth
ington, of the .State of Illinois, to
form, with Hon. Carroll D. Wright,
Commissioner of Labor, . as designated by
said statute, a commisson for the purpose
of making careful inquiry into the causes
of the controversies between certain rail
roads and their employes, which had re
sulted in an extensive and destructive
strke, accompanied by much violence and
dangerous disturbance with considerable loss
of life and great destruction of property.
The report of the commissioners has been
submitted to me and will - be transmitted
to the Congress with the evidence taken
upon their investigation. Their work has
been well done and their standing and in
telligence give assurance that the report
and suggestions they make are worthy of
careful consideration.-
OIR FOREIGN HKLATIOXS.
(
EfTortM of the Administration to Se
cure Pence In the' Far East.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
with them afithis time additionally demon
strate the advantage of consistently ad
hering to a firm but just foreign policy,
free from envious or 'ambitious national
schemes and characterized by honesty.
On the 17th of March last a new treaty
with China in further regulation of emi
gration was signed at -Washington, and on
Aug. 13 it received the sanction 6f the Sen
ate. Ratification on the part of China and
formal exchange are awaited to give effect
to this mutually beneficial convention. A
gra-iifying recognition of the uniform im
partiality of this country towards all for
eign states was manifested by the coinci
dent request of the Chinese and Japanese
governments that the agents of the United
States should within" proper 'limits afford
protection to the subjects of tdie other dur
ing tie suspension of ' diplomatic relations
due to a state of war. This delicate office
was accepted and a misapprehension which
gave rise to the belief that in affording
this kindly unofficial, protection our agents
would exercise the came authority which the
withdrawn agents of .the belligerents had
exercised was promptly corrected. Al
though the war between China and Japan
endangers no policy, of the United States,
it deserves our gravest consideration, by
reason of its disturbance of our growing
commercial interests-da -the two countries,
and the increased .dangers which may result
to our citizens domiciled or sojourning in
tbe interior of China7i
Acting under a stipulation in our treaty
with Corea (the first concluded with a
Western power) I felt constrained, at the
beginning of the controversy, to tender our
good offlces to Induce an amicable arrange
ment of the initial difficulty growing out of
the Japanese demands for administrative
reforms in Corea, but the unhappy precipi
tation of actual hostilities defeated this
kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive
war between 'the two most powerful of the
Eastern nations, and anxious that our com
mercial Interests in those countries may be
preserved, and that the safety of our citi
zens there shall not be Jeopardized, I would
not hesitate to Jieed any Intimation that
our friendly aid for the honorable termina
tion of hostilities would be acceptable to
both belligerents. .
Apart from the war in which the island
empire Is engaged Japan attracts Increasing
attention in this country by her evident de
sire to cultivate more liberal Intercourse
with us and to seek our kindly aid in
furtherance of her laudable desire for com
plete autonomy in her domestic affairs and
full equality in the family of nations. The
Japanese empire of to-day' is no longer the
Japan of the past, and our relations with
this progressive nation should not be less
broad and liberal than those with other
powers.
Samoa nnd Ilnvvnil.
In my last annual message, I referred
briefly to the unsatisfactory state of af
fairs in Samoa, under the operation of the
Berlin treaty, as signally illustrating the
impolicy of entangling alliances with for
eign powers, and on May 9. 1894, in response
to a resolution of the Senate, I sent a
special message and documents to that
body on the same subject, which empha
sized my previously-expressed opinions.
Later occurrences, the correspondence in
regard to which will be laid before Con
gress, further demonstrate that the gov
ernment, which was devised by the three
powers and forced upon the Samoans
against their inveterate hostility, can be
maintained only by the continued presence
of a foreiKn military force and at no small
sacrifice of life and treasure. The suppres
sion of the Mataafa insurrection by the
powers and the subsequent banishment of
the leader and eleven other chiefs, as re
cited In my last message, did not bring
lasting peace to the islands, formidable
uprisings continued, and finally a rebellion
broke out in the - capital Island, Upolu,
headed in Aana. the western district, by
the younger Tamasese, and In Atua, the
eastern district, by other leaders. The in
surgents ravaged the country and fought
the government troops up to the very doors
of Apia. The King again appealed to the
powers for help and the combined British
and German naval forces reduced the At
uans to apparent subjection, not, however,
without considerable loss to the natives. A
few days later Tamasese and his adherents,
fearing the ships and the marines, pro
fessed submission. ,
Reports received from our agents at Apia
do not Justify the belief that the peace
thus brought about will be of long dura
tion. It is their conviction that the natives
are. at heart, hostile to the present govern
ment; that such of them as professed loy
alty to It did so from fear of the powers,
and that it would speedily go to pieces if
the war ships were withdrawn. In report
ing to his government on the unsatisfactory
situation since the suppression of the late
revolt by foreign armed forces, the Ger
man consul at Apia stated that peace will
be lasting Is hardly to be presumed. Tho
lesson given by firing on Atua was not
sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave a
lasting impression on the forgetful Samoan
temperament. In fact, conditions are ex
isting which show that the peace will not
last and is not seriously intended.' Malletoa.
the King, and his chiefs are convinced that
the departure of the war ships will be a
signal for a renewal of war. The circum
stances that the representatives of the vil-ioo-oa
rt nil thA districts which are onnosed
to the government have already withdrawn
to Atua to noui meetings anu mat notn
Atua and Aana have forbidden Inhabitants
of those rflitricts which fought on the side
of the government to return to their vil
lages anvi isave already partly burned down
the latter indicates that a real conciliation
of the parties Is still far off." And in a
note of the 10th ultimo, inclosing a copy of
that report for the information of this gov
ernment the German embassador said:
"The contenU of the reports awakened the
Imperial government's apprehension that,
under existing circumstances, the peace
an expression of the judgment of Congress
on the propriety of steps being taken by
this government looking to the withdrawal
from its engagements with the other pow
ers on seme reasonable terms not prejudi
cial of any of .our existing rights.
Since communicating the voluminous cor
respondence in regard to Havsll and the
action taken by the Senate and House of
Representatives on certain questions sub
mitted to the judgment and aider nllscre
tion of Congress, the organization of a gov
ernment in place of the provisional ar-
rangement which followed the deposition I
of the Queen has been announced, with evi- !

THE DLUEFIELDS INCIDENT.
Prominent among the questions of the
year was the Bluefields incident, in what
is known as the Mosquito Indian strip,
bordering on the Atlantic ocean and within
the Jurisdiction' of Nicaragua. By the
treaty of 1860, between Great Britain and
Nicaragua, the former government ex
pressly recognized the sovereignty of the
latter over the strip, and a limited form
of self-government was guaranteed to the
Mosquito Indians, to be exercised accord
ing to their customs, for themselves and
other dwellers within its limits. The so
called native government, which grew to
be largely made up of aliens, for many
years disputed the sovereignty of Nicara
gua over the strip and claimed the right
to maintain therein a practically independ
ent municipal government.
Karly In the past year efforts of Nicar
agua to maintain sovereignty over the
Mosquito territory led to serious disturb
ances, culminating in the suppression of
the native government and the attempted
substitution of an impracticable composite
administration, in which Nicaragua and
alien residents were to participate. Fail
ure was followed by an insurrection which,
for a time, subverted Nicaraguan rule, ex
pelling her officers and restoring the old
organization.. This, in turn, gave place to
the existing local government established
and upheld by Nicaragua. Although the
alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua
in these transactions have been largely
American, and the commerce of that re
gion for some time has been and still is
chiefly controlled by our citizens, we can
not, for that reason, challenge the rightful
sovereignty of Nicaragua over this im
portant part of her- domain. For some
months one, and during partof the time,
two of our naval ships have been stationed
at Bluefields for the protection of all le
gitimate interests of our citizens. In Sep
tember last the government of Nicaragua
expelled from its territory twelve or more
foreigners, including two Americans, for
alleged participation in the seditious or
revolutionary movements against the Re
public of Bluefields, already mentioned,
put through the earnest remonstrance of

been permitted to return to the pfacful
management of their business. Out xuival

THE CIVIL WAR IN BRAZIL.
The termination of the civil war In Bra
zil has been followed by the general preva
lence of peace and order. It appearing at'
an early stage of the insurrection that its
course would call for unusual watchfulness
on the part of this government, our naval
force in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro was
strengthened. This precaution, I am sat
isfied, tended to restrict the issue to a sim
ple trial of strength between the Brazilian
government and the insurgents, and to
avert complications which at times
seemed Imminent. Our firm attitude
of neutrality was maintained to
the end. The Insurgents received
no encouragement of eventful asy
lum from our commanders, and such op
position as they encountered was for the
protection of our commerce and was clearly
Justified by public law. A sertoua tension
of relations having arisen at thf; close of
the war between Brazil and Portugal by
reason of the escape of the Insurgent Ad
miral Da Gama and his followers, the
friendly offices of our representatives to
those countries were exerted for the pro
tection of the subjects of either within the
territory of the other. Although the gov
ernment of Brazil was duly no-lined that
the commercial arrangements existing be

Early in the present year an agreement
was reached with Great Britain concerning
Instructions to be given to the naval com
manders of the two governments in Bering
sea and the contiguous North Pacific ocean
for their guidance In the execution of the
award of fthe Paris tribunal of arbitration
and the enforcement of the regulations
therein prescribed for the protection of seal
life in the waters mentioned. An under
standing has also been reached for the pay
ment by the United States of W23.0O0 in full
satisfaction of all claims which may be
made by Great Britain for damages grow
ing out of the controversy as to fur seals
in Bering sea, or the seizure of British
vessels engaged in taking seal In those
waters. The award and findings of "the
Paris tribunal, to a great extent, de
termined the facts and principles upon
which those claims should be adjusted, and
they have been subjected by both govern
ments to a thorough examination upon the
principles as well as the facts which they
Involve. I am convinced that a settlement
upon the terms mentioned would be an
equitable and advantageous one, and I
recommend that provision be made for the
prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus
far only France and Portugal have signi
fied their williugness to adhere to the reg
ulations established under the award of the
Paris tribunal of arbitration. Preliminary
surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a
preparatory examination of the question of
protection of food, fish in the contiguous
waters of the 'United States and the Do
minion of Canada are in progress.
The recent death of the Czar of Russia
called forth appropriate expressions of sor
row and sympathy on the part of our gov
ernment with his bereaved family and the
Russian people. As a .further demonstra
tion of respect Jid friendship, our minister
at St. Petersburg was directed to repre
sent our government at the funeral cere
monies. The sealing interests of Russia in
Bering sea are second only to our own. A
modus Vivendi has, therefore, been conclud
ed with the imperial government restric
tive of poaching on the Russian rookeries
and of sealing in waters tjvhich were not
comprehended in the protected area de
fined in the Paris award.
- Occasion has been found to urge upon
the Russian government equality of treat
ment for our great life insurance com
panies whose operations have been extend
ed throughout Europe. Admitting, as we
do, foreign corporations to transact busi
ness in the United States, we naturally ext
pect no less tolerance for our own in the
ample fields of competition abroad.
But few case3 of interference with nat
uralized citizens returning to Russia have
been reported during the current year. One
Krzemlnskl was arrested last summer in a
polish province on a reported charge of un
permitted renunciation of Russian allegi
ance, but it transpired that the proceedings
originated in alleged malfeasance commit
ted by Krzeminski while an Imperial offi
cial a number of years ago. Efforts for his
release, which promised to be successful,
were in progress when his death was re
ported. CLOSED "MARKETS OF THE WORLD."
Acting upon the reported discover' of
Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle,
the German prohibition against importa
tions of live stock and fresh meats from -this
country has been revived. It is hoped
that Germany will soon become convinced
that the inhibition is as needless as it is
harmful to mutual lnte-ests. ' The German
government has protested against that pro
visions of the customs tariff act which im
poses a discriminating duty of one-tenth of
one cent a pound on sugars coming from
countries paying an export bounty thereon,
claiming that the exaction of such duty Is
in contravention of Articles 5 and 9 of the
treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In the inter
ests of the commerce of both countries,
and to avoid even the accusation of treaty
violation, I recommend the repeal of so
much of the statute as Imposes that duty,
and I invite attention to the accompanying
report of 'the Secretary of State containing
a discussion of the questions raised by the
German protests.
I have endeavored to impress on the Bel
gian government the needlessness and posi
tive harmfulness of its restrictions upon
the importation of certain of our food prod
ucts, and have strongly urged that the rigid
supervision and inspection under our laws
are amply sufficient to prevent the exporta
tion from this country of diseased cattle
and unwholesome meat.
Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by
Spain ton the vessels and commerce of the
United States have demanded from time to
time during the last twenty years earnest
remonstrance on the part of our govern
ment. In the immediate past exorbitant
penalties have been imposed on our vessels
and goods by customs authorities of Cuba
and Porto Rico for clerical errors of the
most trivial character in the manifests or
bills of lading. In some cases fines amount
ing to thousands of dollars have been levied
on cargoes or the carrying vessels when the
goods in question were entitled to free en
try. Fines have been exacted even when
the error has been detected, and the Span
ish authorities notified before the arrival
of the goods in port. This conduct is in
strange contrast with th. considerate and
liberal treatment extended to Spanish ves
sels and cargoes in our ports in like cases.
No satisfactory settlement of these vexa
tious .questions has yet been reached. The
Mora case, referred to in my last annual
message, remains unsettled. From the di
plomatic correspondence on this subject,
which has ben laid before the Senate, it
will bo seen that this government has of
fered to conclude a convention with Spain
for disposal by arbitration of outstanding
claims between the two countries, except
the Mora claim, which, having been long
ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as
stipulated, and, of course, it could not be
included in the proposed convention. It
was hoped that this offer would re
move parliamentary obstacles encountered
by the Spanish government in providing pay
ment of the 'Mora indemnity. I regret to
say that no definite reply to this offer has
yet been made, and all -ffcrts to secure pay
ment of this settled claim have been un
availing. In my last annual message I adverted to
the claim on the part of Turkey of the right
to expel as persons undesirable and danger
ous, Armenians naturalized In the United
States and returning to Turkish Jurisdic
tion. Numerous questions In this relation
have arisen. While this government ac
quiesces in the asserted right of expulsion,
it will not consent that Armenians may be
Imprisoned or otherwise punished for no
other reason than having acquired, with
out imperial consent. American citizenship.
Three of the assailants of Aliss Melton, an
American teacher in Mosul, have been con
victed by the Ottoman courts, and I am ad
vised 'that an appeal against the acquittal
of the remaining five has been Liken by the
Turkish prosecuting officers.
Our relations with the republic of France
continue to be such as should exist be
tween nations so long bound together by
friendly sympathy and similarity In their
form of government. The recent cruel as
sassination of the President of this sister
republic called forth such universal expres
sions of sorrow and condolence from our
people and government as to leave no doubt
of the depth and sincerity of our attach
ment. The resolutions passed by the Sen
ate and House of Representatives on the
occasion have been communicated to the
widow of President Carnot.
Under our present treaties of extradition
with Italy miscarriages of Justice have oc
curred, owing to the refusal of that govern
ment to surrender Its own subjects. Thus
far our efforts to negotiate an amended
convention obviating this difficulty have
been unavailing.
During the past year, pursuant to a law
of Congress, commissioners were appointed
to the Antwerp Industrial Kxpositlon.
Though the participation of American ex
hibitors fell far short of completely illus
trating our national ingenuity and Indus
trial achievements, yet it was quite credit
able In view of the brief time allowed for
preparation.
The rules for the prevention of collisions
at sea, which were framed by the mara

A LOCAL CAPITALIST'S VIEWS O A

Objections to the Uultltnnre Plan
Suggests a Special Issue of Bonus
to Secure Circulation. -
Mr. E. F. Clay pool, capitalist, ha? som
views on financial questions aid on th
matter of currency particularly which differ
from those of the Baltimore Clearing
house Association. He does not believe the
Baltimore plan would be the best toward
providing an elastic currency. Mr. Clay
pool suggests some new measures in th
issuance of certificates to head off bank
panics, A reporter for the Journal yester
day obtained Mr. CI ay pool's views on
these questions. ' : ;
What is your opinion In regard to the
plan proposed by the Baltimore Clearing
house Association on the question of a
change In the bank currency 7' Mr. Clay
pool was asked.
"I have read the suggestions ofTered."
said he, "and have considered pome what
their practical effect if adopted. And I am
of the opinion that such a system would
not accomplish the object in view by pro
viding an "elastic currency;' neither would '
It "have full confidence of the people. How
ever the plan has merit and is "worthy -of
careful consideration and might prove to bo
a successful one, under ordinary circum
stances, especially so long as the balanc
of trade was favorable to this ' country;
but when the conditions are otherwise, and ,
hat feature of the plan Jias been accom
plished, viz., by driving the present national
bank currency, government notes and silver
certificates out of circulation, and when
there was an active demand for gold for
export a condition that often occurs then
the notes of the banks would be returned
for redemption and the situation would
not be o desirable. At present the govern
ment supplies that demand from import
duties, the redemption of the sliver cer
tificates and other outstanding notes, and
when the receipts Xrora those are not suf
ficient by sale of bonds.
"The Baltimore plan, as I understand it.
provides that the banks may isue an
amount equal to 50 per centum, of their cap
ital stock, on which the banks are required
to pay a tax of one-half of 1 per cent,
per annum and, should the bank desire,
may issue an. additional amount of 23 per
cent., on which amount the banks are to
be required to pay to the government u'
heavy tax. but the plan does not name the
amount of the taxi This latter Issue is
designated in the plan, as emergency cir
culation. Now, if that tax is net too hijh,
many of the banks would prefer to pay it
in preference to the rate of interest on
deposits, which they frequently allow. In
that case when the time arrived that an in
crease of the currency was desired such
banks could not respond, their circulation
being up to the limit. When credits ar
easy and confidence is on the up grade
and investments for speculation are f re sly
entered into then we have what is called
times of prosperity. But when such pro
cedure has reached a point beyond thi
limit of proper values and safety then the
tocsin of alarm Is sounded, the storm ap
proaches and then begins the struggle by
the banks for a haven or sarety. Their
discount lines are reduced, their deposits
are withdrawn and many failures follow
In the wake, and if there Is a demand for
specie their notes are returned for redemp
tionso that, day by day. the resources
of the banks grow less and what remains
becomes less available. The confidence of
the people is shaken and the consequence
is a contraction of credits, a contractlcn of
business nnd a contraction of the currency.
At such times the question of profit by
the banktr becomes entirely secondary and
the relief anticipated by the 'emergency
circulation would, in my opinion, fail to
be realized." .
LEGISLATION AND PANIC.
"Do you think such panics as the late
one are apt to occur again soonT
'Such events have often occurred and
should be looked for again. The panlo
of 1833 is without . a similar pre
cedent In this country. The affairs
of the government were on a sound
basis State, county, municipal, corporation
and Individual indebtedness, generally
speaking, was not alarmingly excessive,
and the banks mainly were unusually pros
perous; there was no scarcity of currency
or gold. But from some hidden cause tho
calamity came and it swept over the entire
country. Its effects are well known. Finan
cial disturbances come from various causes.
So It would seem that no remedy can bo
devised that will meet every emergency.
All that can be accomplished by legisla
tion Is to provide as many safeguards
as possible against such contingencies
first, to restrain the cause and then to
provide the means best calculated to re
lieve the difficulty when it comss. I pre
sume as long as time laSts there will be
an Irrepressible conflict on the question of
banks and bank currency. No condition or
affairs can be devised that will give general
satisfaction. There seems to be a longing
e'esire for new dejartures a great mistake,
many times, and especially on the subject
of finance. That question should have as
little agitation and change as possible.
When a policy has been fixed and has
been tried with reasonable good results It
should be carefully guarded and reluctantly
So you favor the present rystem of

"For my part, I cannot understand why
there should be any objection to the pres
ent system of national banking, taking it
In the main. It has been long and well
tried, has provided a sif and reliable cur
rency, and it should be sustained with as
little alteration as possible. However,
since its organization, circumstances have
somewhat changed. The bonds of the gov
ernment, the basis of the circulation of th
banks, have been, to a great extent, pail
olf. and the credit of th- government ha
materially increased, sufficient to cau-e a.
large premium on the ojtstanding bonds,
so that, at their present price, it is no longer
profitable for the banks to maintain a cir
culation based on them. The question tf
be solved Is how the difficulty shall best
be overcome. I am of the opinion that the
better plan is that Congress should devi.
ways and means, by providing a special
Isue of bonds for the exclusive purpose of
the national banks, to be used by them as
security for their circulation In an amount
sufficient to retire the outstanding notes
and silver certificates of the government and
to meet the demands of trade; such bonds
to bear Interest at a rate not exceeding
2 per cent, per annum, to run for fifty
years and to be delivered to the banks at
their par value upon payment thereof In
gold, treasury notes or feilver certificates,
and simultaneously therewith deliver in
exchange for such bords to the hanks
notes for their circulal.on to the fud par
value of the bonds, and require that the
amount of their circulation shall not be
less than 73 per cent, of the amount or
their capital stock. The rate of interest
to be paid on the bonds being a low one.
the banks thoull be relieved from a tax
on their circulation. Otherwise the condi
tions of the present law applicable to the
system should remain as they now arc.
The new Issue being redeemable In gold
and' secured by bonds of the government,
it would have the confidence of the people
and would be returned fur redemption on.y
when there was need of gold for export. -MR.
