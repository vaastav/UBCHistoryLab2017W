The President' Message.
Immediately after thn muling of the
journal in tho sentitt) on Dec. 0, that
body was informed that tho president
had a communication to present, and
ten minutes afterward tho annual mes
sage was before them -
Like all President Harrison's otlieial
utterances, it is a concise, gracefully
worded, well-balanced statement of the
important negotiations that have been
conducted within the past year, and
will go on record as one of the ablest
state papers over presented to Con
gress. It begins with the important work of
the State Department, treating brielly
of reciprocity negotiations, of the sue
cessful arrangement regarding arbitra
tion of the liehring sea controversary,
and of the concern of the government
over possible trouble that might arise
out of the unsettled boundary dispute.
between Great Ilritaiu and Venezuela
It reviews the unfortunate Italian dif
liculty at New Orleans, and says that
its origin was not in any general ani
mosity toward the Italian people, noi
in any disrespect for the Italian govern
ment, and states the President's belief
that a friendly settlement is attainable,
as also that Congress might make tlu
treaty rights of foreigners recognizable
in the Federal courts.
Tho Chilian situation is vigorously
discussed, and the absolute non-interference
of Minister Kagan and the
naval oilier rs in the South American
rebellion is clearly shown. The un
friendly tone of Chili's reply is deplored
and assurances given that the matter
will be brought before Congress in a
special message, unless duo reparation
is promptly made at the expiration of
the investigation now in progress in the
criminal court at Valparaiso.
The insurrection in China, tho bad
faith shown by Spain regarding Ameri
can rights in the Caroline islands, the
progress made vith the projected inter
continental railway, anil the govern
mental protest against the Itussian per
secution of the Jews, all receive due at
tention; but the most important part, of
the paper is that which is devoted to
i mo roiisiiuM anon oi me iwo paramount

these topic are ably handled and

tariff laws is recommended. The Pros
I ident declares that the tariff law has
j already "disappointed the evil prophe-
j eies of its opponents and in a large
measure realized the hopeful prcdic-
; tions of its friends. Harely, if ever be
fore in the history of the country, has
there been a time when the proceeds of
one day's labor, or the product of oni
farmed acre, would produce so large an
, amount of those things that enter into
the living of the masses of the people.'
This is followed by a clear and exhaust
ivo statement of facts and figures to
j prove his declaration that "all the condi
i tions of prosperity and general content
i ment are present in a larger degree
1 than ever before in our history, and
l.4. J..4. ...I. ii I 1
mat, iuu, just wiiuii it was propnesieu
c they would bo in tho worst state."
I President Harrison favors an honest
dollar and, after a discussion of the sil
y vcr question that reveals a thorough
t knowledge of the financial situation, re-
a iterates his belief that "the free coinage
j1 of silver under existing circumstances
& would disastrously affect our business
at homo and abroad."
The rest of this comprehensive mcs-
sago is devoted to the striking features
cjof tho 3'car's work in the various tie
tvpartments and speaks of "a progressive
and business-like administration" of tho
Department and "an intelligent
aand conscientious desire to improve the
inservicc" on tho part of the Postmaster
JjjUeneral, and heartily concurs in the
pree delivery system tho latter has
coiiarked out. Tho President thinks
pl 'there should bo no hesitancy in
"promptly completing a navy of the best
iiodcrn type, and largo enough to en
Vblo this country to display its Hag in
Jaill seas for tho protection of its citizens
nd of its extending commerce," and
dlc assures us that tho United States
an'will before long attain, in tho con
struction of such vessels with their en
gines and armaments, tho same pre
rominenco which it attained when tho
uuuaii mail uuh;iji-) uuciiu voiuim'i CO
as the clipper ship, and tho most im
I jjressivo exhibit of naval power the old
irdoodcn three-decker man-of-war."
a Tho various bureaus of tho complex
itcrior Department are all reported
i making good progress, and tho state
cnt is made that ''tho provision of ad-
juato school facilities for Indian chil
Wen and tho locating of adult Indians
'?7on farms, involve the solution of tho
diati question."
Tho work of tho Census and Pension
ircaus is approved and tho gratifying
)Vjiiemcnioi inc pension commissioner

rWc Department of Agriculture is
l;hly complimented for its practical
iyrk, and the value of the grain crop is
ur imatcd to bo $500,000,000 more than
j t year, of mcats$150,000,000 more, and
3. 'all farm products $700,000,000 more,
. i ile tho removal of restrictions upon
he
la
the importation of pork will make a
difference in our favor of $20,000,000
additional per annum.
Harrison's opinion of tho Democratic
gerrvmander of Michigan is given in uo
uncertain terms and ho declares that, if
Congressional gerrymanders are per
mitted, these methods may be extended
until wo have thn three great depart
ments of government "in tho grasp of
tho gerrymander the legislative and
executive directly, and the judicial in
directly, through tho power of appoint
ment." He recommends that this mat
ter be regulated "by such constitutional
amendments as will secure uniformity
and prevent that disgraceful partisan
jugglery to which such a liberty of
choice, if it exists, offers a temptation
In conclusion, he emphasizes as tl
chief national danger, any fraudulc
or dishonest restriction of tho right
suffrage and suggests the appointme
of a non-partisan commission whose
members might bo selected by the S
premo Court, to whom a considerate
of the dilliculties connected with oi
elective franchise might be subinitti
with good chance of a just solution.
It will thus be seen that ho not on
points out evils, but suggests a remedy
and from this resume of the messag
and these few short quotations, it nn
readily be seen how manly and slraigh
forward, how forcible anil well written
how replete with information is th
IS
state paper which Democratic newspa
pers mention as "a perfunctory presen
tation of customary topics."
Every patriotic citizen should consid
er it a duty' to read each of these an
nual messages with care, and thei
judge for himself of the work accom
plished within the year.

"There are none so blind as those
who will not see," and it is extremely
amusing to note the defective vision of
our Democratic contemporaries when
ever they turn their optics toward any
successful Republican personage or
measure. Their comments upon Presi
dent Harrison's recent message are an
illustration in point.
No unprejudiced critic could deny
that it is an ably' written and forcible
document, giving a careful review of
tho affairs of state; but because the
president dares, in a manly anil
straightforward way, to criticise the
theory of the Michigan Democracy pro
viding for the election of electors by
congressional districts, and because h
proves conclusively that the inevitable
result of such a measure would be the
overthrow of those principles upon
which the government was founded,
for such good reasons as this, forsooth,
such papers as the Detroit Free Press
accord it no credit whatever, but refer
to it as "a perfunctory presentation of
the topics which it lias been the custom
to include in annual messages."
Indeed, the Democratic brethren and
those so-called Independents who al
ways look through Democratic eye
glasses seem wonderfully in accord, and
develop a remarkable liking for that
"perfunctory" statement. It rolls like
a sweet morsel under their tongue, and
tho Detroit Evening News says, "The
president's message to congress was as
perfunctory a state paper as has been
presented to that body in many a year.
There was not a gleam of intelligence
in it."
It hardly seems necessary to say that
such an extreme statement as this is
not calculated to awaken great confi
dence in tho mind of the average reader
regarding the column of one-sided ut
terances to which it is prefixed, nor is
any person of intelligence, whether
friend or foe, liable to bo unable to read
spite and envy between tho lines.
Another illustration of this willful
blindness is culled from tho columns of
the Grayling Democrat and reads as fol
lows: "Never was a president so des
pised by his own party as Benjamin
Harrison," and this astounding declara
tion is made in spite of the many eulo
gistic remarks often uttered bytho
Republican press and his numerous ad
mirers throughout tho land.
If to bo "despised" is to bo held in
the esteem universally accorded to Ben
jamin Harrison, then aro wo ready to
bo despised and rejected of all men.
Dom Pedro dead has received tho ac
knowledgment of his worth that was
denied him while living, and has
been given a royal funeral by the
French government, while Engiand's
queen adorned his coflin with a
wreath of immortelles. Too often is
this the case with both public and pri
vate individuals, and yet how futile
and inconsistent arc these post-mortem
exhibitions of an appreciation and re
gard that is refused in life-time and
springs to the surface only when the
pulseless hands arc crossed in death
and tho tired heart stilled forever.
Hero is a hard nut for woman suffrag
ists to crack: In 1888, when tho women
of Boston were first enfranchised, over
20,000 of them voted for members of tho
school committee; yet, in tho short pe
riod of three years, this number has de
creased to 0,000. Will some of Mrs
Livermoro's adherents rise and explain
this seeming failure in their pet theory?
By a recent arrangement the United
States will allow the freo importation
of German sugar and, in return, im
ported American cereals will pay only
3J instead of 5 marks. Blaino's reci
