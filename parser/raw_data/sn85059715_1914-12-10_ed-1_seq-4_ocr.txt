BB&^gQETHE.
I'/An eight-year-old bey has been
thrown info jail here (or theft. That
|s bad, but the theft was doubtless
the result of bablts formed by the
boy The boy Is said to have committed
the theft about 5 o'clock In the'
morning. Possibly the boy had been
out al> nigbt. The theft indicates that.
Would it not bo wise for parents to
pee to it that the children arc at home
gt night? They owe that duty to their
0htlc|ren. m
- .Empty coal cars, standing on side
tracks at the coal mines is evidence!
pf .Democratic "prosperity." The I
president made no allusion to these
empty cars in his message. It may
be possible that be really doeB not
hnow business conditions. The
message indicates as much 'or if he
does know his ideas of business prosperity
are different front those who
would like to work and see business
good like it used to be.
':Idle cars on sidetracks at coal
milnes in the region can be seen
IV... t)very day and the operator counts,
himself lucky If he sees a chance to
load them soon. A different condi
tion used to prevail in this region
,.y and there was daily complaint of a
shortage of cars. Now there is no
Occasion to load cars and, of course,
oars are not In demand. This
change in conditions-should impress
[ itself on every mining community
y yrhore the empty, standing'cars are.
Jy, There is apolitical lessou to learn
&j>mthe.-present situation. Not only
' , (ioal miners suffer. The merchant
jj?f - feels, it,, too.
|'S J ' Prodding the People,
5* John J. Cornwell, well known
v ; . Domooratic editor and legislator,
casta aside partisanship and very
- - frankly admits that the Democratic
party has done an unpopular thing in
imposing '"war" taxes ot> the people.
fS He declares that the party should
better look out and It is an unwise
s thing to prod the people. Editor
Cornwall says in the current number
ffii of the Hampshire Review:
|te . Much confusion and trouble were
jjt-'.Y. occasioned in the large towns and
|rv cities from inability,on the part of
;;* * the public to procure the "war tax"
?. stamps before the law became effectHK1
,'ivo. Shippers bver railroad and express
lines suffered the greatest inconvenience,
asv each freight bill requires
a stamp. The revenue department'in
Washington had failed to
furnish a sufficient supply, the bureau
of engraving and printing having
7 been taxed to its limit in getting them
.. put. It is a' great pity the president
and Congress could not have devised
gpme way for raising the additional
revenue without resorting to a stamp
' tax, the means used in actual war
time. It is bound to prove very un.'
popular because of the trouble, rather
than, the expense, . Too many governmental
activities as against the In
dividual citizens will create a resentment
no political party ca,n withstand.
As long as government restrictions
and regulations are confuted
to corporations It is ail well
and good but when Uncle Sam begins
ttf, prod the citizen?look out.
' CormveU on Davis, '
In view of the fact that the following
editorial was penned by John
J. Cornwell, erstwhile Democratic
leader and Idol In this slate, it Is
What the Telegram calls rich:
"We have some very distressing

' a more brilliant representative in

face and dignjflpfj of hearing he was i
no dude,'our John Davis was not. i
No wonder he had- friends galore :
and could get elected frgm a Repub- ]
lican district. <
But there seems to have come a >
change since he left us and became i
a-high muck-a-muck in the national '
administration, at Washington. We '
did not think the appointment of So- '
ljcitor General of the United States I
would go to' bis head. But it has, <
evidently. We have the word of J
Charles P. Light for it, and who 1
would dare question Charley Light's J
word? John Davis, according to
Charley Lfght, has taken to wearing
a silk hat?plqg, they call It down
there?a long tall coat, with braid I
on It and carries a cane. Now, we 1
.could forgive him ir he walked with J
the stick but he actually allows it t
to dangle from his left arm. Worse \
yet, he has been knowp to pass peo- t
pie on tbe street without as much as 1
saying "good morning" to thep. i
We realize that this news will dis- 1
tress John Davis's other West Virr s
glnlq friends as it distresses us. Nq t
wonder the Alfalfa Club threatens j
to expel him. Good bye, John, you <
evidently do not Intend to come back \
to'West Virginia.

Fake Advertising. c
In another. column Is an article a
stating that W. A. Hcrscb, president t
of the United Woolen Milis Company, i
is onertng a reward for the arrest o"
fake advertisers, and what the Parkcrsburg
Dispatch-News says on the
subject as follows applies here:
Mr. "W. A. Hersch, president of the
United Woolen Mills Company, has
taken up the cudgel against fraudulent
advertisers and fraudulent advertising.
It has been his hobby for some
time, and he has before agitated the
subject, but he ,is now prepared to
take definite steps to carry out his
ideas. There it a law in Ohio, in
whiph state Mr. Hersch operates extensively,
and he has offered to the
Advertisers' Club of Cincinnati the
sum of |oD for each arrest?up to a
total qf six?made of merchant tailor
advertisers for specious advertising.
He does not make conviction a condition.
He will contribute so soon as
the formal charge is uttered.
The legal phase .of the action taken
is only incidental sfr far as Parkers- t
burg and West Virginia are concerned.
, The moral is a strong ope.. ?
Here we have an extensive user of ad- c
vertising space, not only insistent that c
his own advertising shall be compati-'. t
ble with his merchandise hut willing t
to contribute' to a propaganda to make t
the high standard he sets for himself* r
applicable to all. i
While there have been few evl-j,
dences of the need in Parkersburg, thei
need nevertnolesB obtains, lor pro-;, i
tectlng the consumer against false
and fraudulent advertising matter^ j
Honest values have been the rule t
here and so far as Parkepsburg Is con- (
oerped no concern that employed'ad- t
vertlsing for purposes of deceit could j
long withstand. This is the general i
rule. But there may be exceptions',. 1
and there Is, so long as there Is no
law to the contrary, always.the po- 1
tentlal danger of exceptions. A law j
that would compel the truth in advert ,
tlslng would not (jt(l?. provc.a.prolec
tlon to those merchants 'wh'if dedicate 1
their advertising, to, the truth but It
would be a lasting boon to the public.
Success of Average People.
What you want to do Is to cut
idown your expenses and live within I
your Income. 1 would give all the 1
legerdemain of finance and financiering
for the old, homely maxim, 1
"Live within your Income."?Sam- :
uel J. Tilden. 1
The following short and simple i
annals of the poor who became i
richer are set down here not because i
they nre startling stories of success,
but just because they aru such ex- I
laniples as the average person of am- !
bittop can hope to emulate success- |
fully. tVe cannot all become enormously
rich, but It Is possible for |
most of us to acquire a competence i
if we go about It in the] right way. i
j Back in the eighties a young man 1
In northern New York state took 1
Horace Greeley's advice and went i
west to grow up with the country, i
He settled in what is now a prosper, <
ous state in the Northwest, taking)
hp there a free government,homestead
claim oh the praries. As the t
country became more settled land i
values rose. Soon there was agita- 1
tion for the establishment of a state '
agricultural college In the nearby |
county seat. In the meantime the
young man had sold his farm at a <
profit and with some of.the money
went to Chicago to tnke a course in 1
pharmacy. He returned just iff '
time to secure-a position on the fac- I
ulty of the new agricultural college.
He is now head of a depart- t
ment there and has become comfort- ;
ably well off bfr saving from his in- i
come and investing in farms' andjl
farm mortgages in his neighborhood.!
A Bohemian servant girl was mar.I'
ried the other day. The comfortable1]
'and well furnished home Into which ]
she and her husband moved is a ,
striking illustration of the thrift for '
which this element of our foreign- ]
born population is noted. The
little house in the country was built
from the young man's savings and
a large part of tbe furnishings cama-i
from the young woman's' savings;!
from her earnings of (en years as nil
hous? servant. They were good
things, too-^substantial furniture
and reai silver. Industry and thrift
will make this couple comfortably j
well off In time.
A "city dentist 32 years old
moved bis family into a home of their
own in the suburbs during the last
, summer. He has been practicing his :
(profession for almost ten years, but
i the very substantial cash down pay1

lumber of years he had been putting
i Urge part of his savings into the
purchase' of a valuable corner Jot.

laving* account every six months to
make the required payments on his

Our >'ary Situation. !
It is very evident that the United
states navy is not what it ought to b.e.
t is true that world-pegce sentiment
nay cause a hesitation on the part of
he government to make the navy
\ hat It ought to be. That same seniment
was supposed to be possessing
European nations Just beforethe war
>wke out. It is fine sentiment and
U realization would mark an ideal
iununit in civilization, but it is not
tere yet and may not come' for many
-'eurs. ' In the meantime the United
States can not afford to act as if{
vorld-ipeace actually exists!
Our rather 'weak navy condition is
imptyaslzed by Read Admiral Fletcher,
commander of the Atlantic fleet,
i man whose credibility, apd judgment
ire not to be discounted, else the
istion has made a grave mistake to
intrust bim with the fleet. Admiral
rletcber is in position to know and
le is not a man to exaggerate. He
oust/be taken at his word, despite
>eace sentiment.
iRear Admiral Fletcher has just tola
lie House naval committee that the
Jnited States navy is unprepared to
:ope with the most powerful navy In
he world. True, his words giye the
nference that be regards the navy
itrong, but the fact that there is at
east-one stronger places the nation
it disadvantage in case of war. He
eatifled that "we are not prepared
or the worst emergency that might
irise to protect ourselves from the
;reatest force available. We would
lave to greatly enlarge our fleet to
irotect American interests against all
lossible combinations against ub to
:ontrol the ocean. We would have
0 take the offensive when we have
1 strong enough fleet."
It js true one sees in his testimony
i high degree of efficiency op the part
>t our navy, but Admiral Fletcher!
:ertalnly clearly conveys the* idea
bat something great is lacking. He
ells us that we are not fully pre>ared
for the dcfcnslye if the greatest
lavy comes against us and not at all
eady to take the offensive, both of
vhich would be necessary In case of
var with at least one of the great
latlons. '
Information such as Is given by
Idmlral Fletcher ought to arouse acton.
While no one wants war and
ivery one will do his best to keep out
>f it, there is sanity in being ready
'or it, whenever It comes. ' We can
lot count on others taking care of us.
IVc must do that ourselves.

looked closely at his visitor.

"Absolutely in spite of it," she replied.

President Wilson's Message.
The president's message, delivered
to the short term of the Sixty-third
Congress yesterday, is in the president's
usually clear English and discloses
a literary style unimpaired by
the nation-wide repudiation' of the.
fine spun theories in promotion of
which it had been heretofore employed.
But the context of' the message
discloses to a degree the sobering
effect of the recent election; nowhere
perhaps more than in the plea of
economy. Whether the words in
the president's message are as hollow
and meaningless as in the platform
on which he was elected remains
to be seen. Surely, so far as
the first half of his administration is I
concerned the president is locking the
stable after the horse is stolen. '
His answer to the movement for an 1
investigation of national defense and j
military preparedness is an excellent '
bit of writing. Here, however, he <
flies in the face, of his advocacy of
"pitiless publicity" since no one has !

American florists have imported a
great many of their plants for winter
blooming from Belgium and other
European countries. There the perfection
of gardening methods and a
more favorable climate enables the
florists to bring the plants more rapidly
to maturity.
The process has been studied in
this country chiefly by the Agricultural
experiment station of the state
of Vermont, where it was proved that
by the usp of ether. lilacs, hydrangeas
and lilies of the valley could be made
to abloom several weeks earlier than
they otherwise would. The advantage

The principle of the process rests
.tpon the fact that every plant before
blooming goes into a dormant or rest
period. The use "of ether hastens
Ihis rest period. It is as though the
deeper "sleep" induced by the anesthetic
enabled the plant to recover its
productive power more rapidly.

NAPLES.
' ''see Naples a'ntf- aif!" 'oxclainiW '
an artistic enthusiast, as- he apSreached
that city o( red and white
ung between sea and sky of.the
deepest blue. This rhapsody was repeated
to a midshipman of the United
States Naval Academy juat before
he started' on the cruise last summer.
He bad a small bump of veneration
and a large bump of humor. When
he came back he announced that he
had revised the remark to read:
"Smell Naples and die!"
There you have the two sides of
the case as it presents itself in Naples,
and also in a good many other
Italian cities. There is absolutely no
parity between the picturesquenoss
and the plumbing. The Mediterranean
is a dream, but the sewage system
is a nightmare. And the worBt
jf it is that travelers, when writing
their memoirs, often pass over'this'
latter feature,, so. that the American'
citizen, who regards sanitation as
the flrk principle of municipal government,
is rudely disillusioned when
he goes abroad.
The people of Naples are just like
their city?picturesque, but dirty.
Their costumes are very .fetching,
and all that could be expected in
color and design, but they seem to be
mtlrely unknown to laundries. And
this is the more surprising because
there are few cities when you'can
Bee more laundry in a day than in
Naples. The people hang it out the
window to dry, and upon strings
which extend clear across the streets
from one upper story to another.
There utter in the breeze all sorts of
gaily colored things not generally
seen outside the advertising pages
o'f magazines, as though the-Neapolitans
wished to prove to all the world
that thev had washed their clothes.
The discrepancy between all this lav- |
atorial activity on the part of the
Inhabitants, and their Invariably
soiled appearance, has given rise to
a legend that they keep one wardrobe
to wash and oftb to wehr.
Next to washing their clothes, the
most favored occupation of the Nea'
