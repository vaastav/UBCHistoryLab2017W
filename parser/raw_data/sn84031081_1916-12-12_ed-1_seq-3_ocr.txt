Chicago. I't'C. 11. The greatest
benefactor to tlio business of the
United States would be the man who
would tell what is going' to happen
j?ftor the war. Almost everybody Is
making a stagger at the problem and
nobody has come anywhere near solv
ing it. Virtually the student of the
subject Is putting himself up against
an impossibility, and yet tin approxi
mation might be made if all the fac
tors were laid in a cool place outsiu
the hurry of the present time and ox
cniincd at leisure.

lain leaders in business, particularly
those of sanguine temperament, are.
entitled to little attention, it Is the
nature of the American to be hopeful
ami t0 see things big, and mnny au
thorities in finance and industry have
personal motives for giving' a good
appearance to affairs.
Outlook Unsatisfactory.
If one Judges by the ordinary ap
pearance of things and holds to the
wave theory of business, ho cannot
look forward to the post-bellum situ
ation with much satisfaction. The im
mense amount of capital that has ac
cumulated in tho United states may
be regarded as a great udvantago to
I'm in the competition for world trade,
but that capitiil is of little use unless
it has something to do.
Inanity was made today of a lead
ing authority on electrical and public
utility matters as to his opinion. He
stated that he budgets of that class
of companies for if 17 are greater
than ever before, and he specified
a number of groups of men engaged
in that lino of business. It has al
ready been published that tho Ameri
can Telephone and Telegraph com
pany has great things on hand for
next year. Tho plans seem to be sim
ply for expansion on ordinary lines
and in response to public require
ments. It is believed that tho Instill
interests centering in this city will he
much enlarged, and the names of Do
lierty and Stone & Webster may be
mentioned In this connection. But all
these plans are predicated on existing
conditions, and those conditions are
temporary, because it can not be as
sumed that the Furopean war will last
many years.
What, then, will be the situation of
these companies with their purchases
of material nt present high prices and
extraordinary labor cost after the
present pressure is over? One thing
! is certain, and that is that the utilities
will be based on a nign capitalization
of cost so far as concerns the produc
tion of equipment now going on.
Then it is a (piestion whether the
demand for service will be such that
a fair income can be earned. At this
point it is found thai the ordinary
wise business manager experiences a
spiritual recoil. He thinks of the time
'Alien the factories now turning out
munitions will close down or curtail
production, when great numbers if
workers will be out of jobs, and when
consequently the demand fr trans
portation, light, food and clothes will
be reduced.
What will there be to do after the
war? We shall have plenty of capi
tal and plenty of labor. The question
is whether there will be such a need
or demand for useful things as will

I absorb the capital and labor. Surely
jwe shall not need any more Industrial
I equipment. It would-seem as if we
had enough of that for a decade at
least. Some of it will be used in cre
jfltiing ll".'.' hnmnn conveniences, and
doubtless a ire if! ft will call for much
larger activities than at the present
time.
Probably, too, there nre some ave
nues which are yet to be opened for
the race is constantly going on to new
ithings, but with all the guessing one
can do he cannot see anything com
mensurate with the equipment of cap
ital, machinery and labor that we now
have.
I tail road 'oust ruction.
Tho old field for the teviv.il of bus
iness was railroad construction. The
railroad authorities say thai there Is
i little loom left for the construction of
trunk lines In this country; at the
Fame time thev declare that something
like $1,000,000,000 per year should bo
expended for railroad facilities. These
two statements may be harmonized,
in part, by the need of better termi
nals and of enlarged capacity to the
lines now existing in the way of big
I train units, powerful engines, etc.
When that is said one does not feel
satisfied that the whole story is told.
I As to new construction, many feeders
can be built to the advantage of lines
I now existing and that of the whole
j country. Tho construction of railroad
! lines has run down to small propor
tions, being last year about one-third
jof the volume recorded in 1913.
It is the opinion of one expert not
I engaged in railroad business that
j "5,000 miles of this ought to be con
jstructed next year." Yes, there is
i plenty of need, but there is no motive
j on the part of capital. The railroad
'men have been discouraged by what
they consider unfair treatment by the
national and stato governments, and
they will not act until there is a new
spirit and promise of a fair return on
their investment. These are some of
the data that must be taken into ac
count in the study of this question,
but the solution of the problem of "af
ter the war" has not yet alighted on
this planet.

IBY MOHNINU JOURNAL C1L tIASIO WIH
Washington, Dec. 11. Kvery mem
ber of President Wilson's cabinet,
with the possible exception of Attor
ney General Gregory, expects to re
main In office March 4, when his sec
ond term begins. It was learned defi
nitely today that all of them have been
or will be asked to keep their pos's.
Reports concerning possible resig
nations have centered chiefly around
Secretaries McAdoo, Houston and
Baker, and the attorney general. It
has been taken from granted that
Postmaster General l'.urleson and Sec
retaries Uinsing, Daniels and Wilson
would remain, and indefinite rumors
that Secretary Ucdfiohl might wish
to retire to private business, were de
nied some time ago.
Secretary McAdoo today personally
denied that he had any intention of
resigning. Regarding Mr. Houston, It
became known that the officials of
Washington university at St. Louis
have extended his leave of absence as
chancellor of that institution so that
he can continue as head of the depart
ment of agriculture.
Although Secretary linker has been
credited with a desire to leave the
cabinet, it is learned that in all like
lihood he will remain. It is under
stood, however, that tliere is a possi
bility that he may be shitted to the
department of justice if Mr. Gregory
insists on resigning, and that Van"e
C. MoCormick, chairman of the dem
ocratic, national committee, may bo
placed in charge, of the war depart
ment. In the attorney general's case, tho
report about his intention to resign
have been very circumstantial and
have been generally accepted ns true
by officils, although he has given no
indication of his intentions. The pres
ident has offered Mr. Gregory a seat
on the supreme court bench, and
should another vacancy occur during
the administration It is thought prob
able ho would be seriously considered
again.

New York, Dec. 11. The situation
affecting the deportation of I'.elgians
by the Germans is "daily more tragi

Wilson, according to a cable message
received by Pierre Mali, Helgian con

The dispatch, dated yesterday at
Havre, whs made public today by the
committee of citizens which is arrang

night ns a protest, against "enslave
ment of Helgians."
The cable message rends:
"Situation is daily more tragical.
Searching and deportations reach
with no distinction men wanting work
and men wanting none.
"On white linen collar found on rail
way of Chenee was w ritten inscription
from a teacher of Mons, dragged away
during his lessons, and begging to give
notice to his wife and children. In
Nlvelles, after having hunted for a
thousand men and locked them In
railway cars for untold destination,
German soldiers went through the
streets among the despairing, sobbing
women and children, singing, 'Floria
Victoria.'
"Kvery single remaining authority
in occupied ISelgium heard with deep
est gratitude what the Cnited States
is doing for them. They all turn
their minds toward true America and
