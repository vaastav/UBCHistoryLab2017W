LADY G A r
03111$ Fraud ulency's first annual
message was sent to Congress on IMon
day last. In it he shows he is arrayed
on the side of the bondholders: and from
his arguments will veto any bill to re
peal the infameus resumption act, or to
provide for the ramonetiridion of silver,
by making it a legal tender, unless the
bondholders are privileged from the op
erations of the law. It is a little sinea-
lar he being a western man, should so
much oppose the true interests of the
laboriug classes of the west, bat we sup
pose he has received his price, and con
sequently the contraction mill must
grind on-althongh it grinds the bones
of honest labor every where, and makes
the widow and orphan sigh for bread,
ami countless thousands rush into hank
ruptcyand crime, and mourn for better
timc3, which, alas I will not come du
ring his administration. Bat the people
win be wide-awake to their interest at
he next election, and the money lords
will then reap the whirl-wind.
