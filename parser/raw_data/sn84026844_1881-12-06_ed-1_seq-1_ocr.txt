Washington', I). C'., is to have a new

plait' needs common senso, that in the
place.
Tut l'rraiiitflt'n iiicsaagu was not forthwining
afterall yesterday; and it U noticeable
llmi those enterprising journals who
iivo beet) anticipating the delivery of
mcli communication!! to Congress in their
columns have not succeeded in securing
(0|?n. I" other words, their past actions
Jiavebceti equivalent to tlio placard: "Look
out lor biu'iik thieves."
A ik.s'satiun.m. correspondent of the
Pitttburgh Uupalch scuds to that paper
from this city a telegram which the editors
dnnrale with the headlines: "After
Another Ring?Fraud? Unearthed in the
Aucwra' liepartnieiit at Wheeling." Tho
telegram in as follows:
W'uiaixo, December 4.?Investigation

tyllie assessors at ridiculously low rates.
I'eoploof the highest standing showed no
i-onipniK tion in cheating the eity by mistiming
the amount of their property. It is 1
wtimuM'il that $2,000,000 personalty was
not returned. ,
That the matter alluded to is an evil
which calls loudly for redress we do not
deny. Hut that there is any oxcuso whatever
for the sensational heading or tolo- 1
groin quoted above wo do deny, and the
city assessors owe it to themselves and the
public to prevent such an injurious im- 1
preasiou from getting abroad. Almost, if '
not quite, a year ago, the Intelmukncek '
called attention to the practice of understating
the vulue of personal property. '
This is, however, a general practice, and
litis come to bo regarded as a matter of
course. At tho time this paper was investigating
the subject it was shown that tho '
entire number of horses and carriages in
Ohio county wcro listed at a prico that '
would not pay for as many vehicles as any
citizen of Wheeling lould recall to 1
niinil of his persona! knowledge,
and there were no cows listed in tho coun- !
ly tospoak of. The same redlculous state of J
affairs prevailed in regard to pianos and 1
organs. Were all tho returns truthful, tho 1
rate of taxation could bo iuatorially lower- ;
el, and those people whoso small possessions
make it impossible to misstate them
would not huvo so disproportionuto a burden
of taxation to bear. But how is an
evil so general to be remedied? It may
well call for earnest investigation on tho
part of our law makers. It certainly does
not call for abuse of the assessors, who
merely return tho valuations certified to
them by tho property holders themsolves.

can nomination for Speaker. At noon, t
Clerk of the House Adams, called the body J
to orderandannounced tho opening of the

The roll-call showed two hundred and j,
ninety Representatives present, the absen- J
tees being Messrs. Morse, Scales, Mills and
Doustcr. v

Speaker Klefer, when the applause had

itivks:?I thank you with my heart I

honor conferred on mo by election as your I

I prumlso to devolo myself faithfully

party or section. Where parly principle
Is Involved. I will lie found to bo a tierubllcnn.
but In all other re?|>cels 1 hope
to bo ablo to act free from party bias. It
Is a singular fact that at tills most prosperous
lime in our nation's history, no
i party In either branch of Congress has
, an absolute majority over all other parties,
Mid It la, therefore, peculiarly fortunate
that at no other time since, and for muny
years prior to the accession of
Abraham Lincoln to the Executive
chair, hus there been so few
unsettled vital questions of u national char*
acter in relation to which party lines have
been so closely drawn The national pros- '
perity of the people is in advauce of any
Jther period 111 history ot our Government.
Violence of party spirit has materially subsided
and iu a great measure muny of the
reusons for its existence ure gone, while
the universal tendency of the peo- .
!>le is to continue und build up the j
in unparalleled prosperity. It should be .
>ur highest uim to permanently promote, 1
tud not cripple it. This Congress should, *
ind I profoundly hope will be, marked j
jcculiurly us the busiuess of Congreas. It (|
nay be true that additional laws are yet
lecessury to give to every citizen complete 0
)roteetion in the exercise of ull political 1
iuhts with evenly balanced party power. 1
iVith f jw grounds for purty strife, and with
to impending presidential election to disract
us from purely legislative duties,
venture to suggest that the present is un I'
uspieious time to euact to our tl
institutions and to insure tranquility at
erilous times in the future. Aguinthunk- ,

Washington, December 5.?Tho openng
of the Guiteau trial was delayed until
1 o'clock to-day, and the court room wo*
rowded al usual. Speaker Randall upteared
in answer to a subpoena. He was
[uite .at a loss to know why he had been
uinmoued, or what ho was expected to
ustify to. The defense also Bubptened
'resident Arthur, but will not summon
tiiii to Appear until after Seoville has
allied his ausent. Scovillo has an ap ointment
to call upon him at 4 o'clock
bis afternoon. Guiteau has stated that he
ad several interviews with President Ar;?ur
during the late canvass, and it is
own that he has written several letters to
lu President, which the latter still has in
is possession. The defense wish them to
t> before the jury. ,
THK CIIIN01NQ CUR,
Ciuiteau was late in arriving at the Court
louse. An immense crowd lined the side
ulks, and upon alighting from the vpii
to ussassin evinced unusual trepidation
ml begged the otlicera to take him around
> the back entrance. He was matured that ;
10 escort was ample for his sufety and with
em bl i ng steps and cri nging gait he quickly
milled through the angry crowd,
bjcct fear was depicted upon his conn nance,
and it was several minutes after
t! reached tho room in the building before
11 regained his usual composure.
Itmdall desired to no excused till
'ednesday. Scovillo stated to Kumiull
nit all he desired to prove was that in his
pinion the success of the Democratic
irly would have not disrupted the couny.
Inasmuch us Senator Davis had
ready given his views on this point, tieo>lle
said he would excuse Kandall from
irther services. .
BXl'RQT TESTIMONY.
Dr. Kennon, managing editor of tho Chiigo
Medical Jicveiw, was called upon to
vo his opinion as an expert, but before
\i could testify, Uuiteau made a little
>eech, in which he said he wuntcd theexijrlsto
nass upon the question whether he,
npelled by the Deity to shoot President
arflekl, was insane or not. Tho testimony
ioil went on, Dr. Konnon giving his
pinion that the prisoner was insane. Tho
roseeution entered into a lengthy crosscainination
of the witness.
During tho testimony Davidge mention1
that John W. Guiteau hud sworn posively
that the prisoner's father was not
isiine.
Guiteau?Wo will show by all Frceport
nit he was insane!
Davidge?Never inind, wo will tako care
f that.
(luiteau?Everybody knows that iny
itlier was badly cranked, lie was u good
lan, but badly cranked on religion.
Witness believed in moral insanity in
jrtain rure eases rendering a man irrelonsible.
Witness based his judgment of
uiteau's insanity upon the hereditary
tint, upon the impairment of tho judglent,
upon exaltation of the emotions and
pon tho inspiration which ijlso included
lotive. Witness admitted that a man comtiling
crime while acting under tho deluon
of Divine inspiration and then connoted
himself precisely as criminals would
o i,t would be presumptive evidence
gainst his insanity.
WHY, Oil W1IY IS IT ALLOWED ?
Guiteau, who had been quietly, but inintly
following the .witness, hero broke in
itlier excitedly, saying nothing of that
hid entered into this ease.
Judgo Davidge?Well, we will see.
Guiteau?Angrily?You are going too
ist in this matter. Wo want facts; not
our judgment. The witness has stated
no thing right. The Lord injects inspiriton
and then lets a man use his own judglent.
That's the way I got my Inspiraon.
Tho Lord don't employ fools to do
is work. He gets the best materiai.
tl .il it... I I.-I

Unit win turned to Davidge, and with an
ir of immense superiority. iiakl: "There's ,
ntliiiiK vulvar about this easo. It's all
Igh-toned." (Laughter, which wm quickly 1
ippressed by the court.)
(juiteau suddenly interrupted the exammtion,

Kichard I. llinton, editor of the Washngfcnn
(jitzitUe had seen the prisoner at the
(t'publiean Headquarters in New York,
ud formed the opinion that he was an exredingly
illy balanced, cranky egotist.
Vltness was asked what he thought of the
irisoner's st?ecch, "Garfield vs. llancock,"
nd replied that in his opinion it was a
idiculous, disjointed affair.
Guiteau became very much incensed,
nd shouted out: "Well, It wasn't anything
f the kind. You don't know what you're
Hiking about. My speech received the enlorscment
of the best men in the country."
Witness resumed by saying that the
irlsoner seemed to bo a perfect nuisance
bout the rooms, but Was interrupted by
luiteau who retorted, "You were a
uiisnnce yourself. I had rather bo hunc
a a man than acquitted ns a fool and I
pim'i tnvn nnv fnnrn rif thin kind nf <>vi

iiughing stock, no fur as lie coulil see.
lultenii became greatly enraged, and tuning
to Seovllle shouted: "II you put any
nore of these cranky fallows on llio JUind

il impertinence on your part to put .ludgo

nv that the prisoner la insane." Sonio
liscussion here arose In relation to the
orin ol the question proposed touching the
cs|ionsibllity o( the prisoner, and the witless
was allowed to retire for the present.

(liiltenii (Impatiently), "Why, the inlerjection

I've told vou a doten times."
The witness waa finally told by Seovllle
lo stand aaide.
Pr, Wm, W, Godding, ol th? Govern

thought upon tho theory that the
fuels set forth in hypothetical o uestions were
true, the prisoner wus undoubtedly insane.
Dr. Jus. II. McBride, of Milwuukee, Wis.,

Finding no objection to his interruption,
Guiteuu proceeded to inuke an incoherent

as if feeling that tho prisoner
was making more headway with the jury
than any exnert testimony could compuss.
He was finally silenced by Judge Cox, aud

Its allusion to tho asuassinution

Jane Miller. She arrived hero to-night,
having on board four bedsteads, throe N
oars, some pins out of the life-boat, a
piece of a mast,a steamer's gang plank and
a pail-rack. All were identified as having j
belonged to the Jane Miller. Sho had
somo kegs of butter with Captain \

for fuel, after which she intended going for *1
Lion's Head?for which place she had
some ton tons of freight. It was blowing a c|
strong gale from the southwest at tho time, ?

I87H. slio was arrested for swindling II. T.
ilubbitt, the soap nimlufacturer, out of $10,000.
It was slmrtly after her release she
purloined diamonds from a wealthy Cuban
gentleman to the value of $12,000.
At present there are numerous Indictments
against the prisoner resting In the
Ilistrlet Attorney's office which, through
sotne technicality, have not hern enforced.
In the present Instance she adopted a new
scheme and succeeded in tho following
way: Making the acquaintance of a Dr.
Fitch, of Brooklyn, she |iro|ioscd to blm a
plan by which ?10,000 could lie miwlo In a
little while If $s,UX) was raised lo put in

cqualntance ol wvenl broken who com*
posed a ring, she alleged, that could give
her points on certain stock that would not
iail to enrich their cotter*. The Doctor did
not hare that amount to invest, so the
schemer proposed to go for a "pool."
A third party could bo let Into the hocret,
she said, and she would guarantee the
one-thinl of the amount neccssarv for her
bare. The third party was soon lound in
the person of Mr. Piujer. The latter did
not uave the necessary amount, but agreed
to pay his share, and to satisfy the firm
put up purt of the capital. This be reinforced
until the $1 050 was paid, and on
the 18th of August au agreement of partnership
of tbe throe parties was drawn up
>nd signed. Dr. Fitch bad already advanced
his share of the "|>ool," and, according
to the chief operator, thu slock was
purchased, consisting of shures in the Cbi:ugo
aud Northwestern ltailroad.
Ab time went on and no dividends wore
innounced the capitalists became uneasy
ind begun questioning the promoter of the
icbeine. Mr. I'inzor soon found out tlmt he
mil been swindled anil by tho notorious
Urn. Peck. He then demanded the return
if his money ut a meeting which tliey held
n the Astor House, butjwas only laughed
it. Ho therefore appealed to Inspector
