A RkootiK« Constable —Last evening
WT lis ni C. Sweet, constable in Algiers,
brought over some prisoners to put in jail.
When near the corner of Orleans and katn
part streets two of his prisoners ran, intend
tag to escape. Sweet pursued one, W. H.
Carter, and overtook bun in the yard of a
private residence. It is said that the man,
a M soon as lie saw that the constable would
«apture him, eried out that he surrendered,
but, notwithstanding that Sweet fired, put
ting a ballet in Carter's right groin, intiict
4ng a wound which is likely to prove fatal.
5 he victim was sent to the Charity Hospital.
e was sentenced to prison because he was
«nable to pay a small fiue for a trifling
offense. Thisca.se seems to be a serious one
/or the constable.
A UlOH Cargo —The steamboat B. E.
Lee yesterday arrived with a magnificent
load of cotton—5346 bales and 1110
«acks of cotton seed. This is a great cargo,
and has been beaten but two or three
*times. Bating each bale worth $75, this load
Would sell for more than $400,000.
Buikf Mention.—J oseph 8oott was ar
te« ted at the corner of Prieur and St. Philip
streets for running his dray over Anthony
Jlononio.
George Scott anticipated Christmas and
fired hit gun in a Dauphine street horse
ear. 8ergeant Malone thought snob oon
* duct, especially as there were ladies in the
ear, was worthy of punishment, so marched
She shooter and his gun to prison.
Francois Sylvain was anxious to kill a
policeman, so he could have a better chance
to be elected to Congress, and he selected
Officer Jackson, at the corner of Craps and
Union streets. The rifled whisky in his
bead and heels caused him to resist, and
tear tho policeman's uniform ont of recog

There may be fun in bigamy before the

A Youth Learns Tempi» Fuorr.— Not
manj days ago Captain John Boeder was
despoiled of a fine gold watoh and chain,
ana was willing to go into mourning for the
loss. He related the circumstance to Cap
tain Montamat, third precinct, and that
officer instantly went in pursuit of Samuel
Antoine, a conu-ly lad. Prison fare was not
to the taste of Samuel, who hinted that pos
sibly the property might be recovered.
Louis )!.ilsanc, a grocer on "Rampart, near
Toulouse street, was sent for, and when
found, charged with knowingly receiving
stolen goods.

Election Returns.— Three more com
panics have been heard from—Louisiana
Hose, Perseverance No. 13, and American
Hook aud Ladder. R. II. Benners was
elected foreman of the first named. John
Vitspatrick of the sftoond, and R. B. Haiuil
tou of tli« third. FiUpatrick'a election was
unanimous, and so to return^ the com
pliment ho hired a band of music» took the
company and their friends into the Irish
man's shanty at the corner of St. Charles
and Perdido streots, to see Dan Owens—and
they saw him, through glasses. Of coarse
Ilan was fully prepared with a healthy
lunch for the boys, and it was good to see
turkey and chicken meat disappear. The
company then bade Dan a fond adien and
called on some other friends, on the way
favoring ur, with a serenade. The boys of
Louisiana Hose had their little diversion in
a quiet way, while the Americans ate a
hearty supper at McCloskev's restaurant.
Each company has our thanks for a mid
night call. The elected tickets will please
the returning boards without delay.

Joseph Dodd, an old and well known citi
xen, «lied at his residence in Jersey City on
Sunday at tho age of eighty-four years. He
was generally known as Colonel Dodd, and
began work over sixty years ago as a mail
messenger. attending to the delivery of out
going mail bags lrom New York. At one
time be carried the out-bound Washington.
Western aud Southern mail to the agents
on the mail coaches runuing from Jersey
Citv. At that time the mail was contained
in à single bag. and ho crossed the river in
a skill from Liberty street, rowing it him
self. The coach had an armed mail guard,
and waited at an inn for the mail hag.
Later in life Colonel Dodd was a mail trans
portation contractor, and for many years
had beeu an attache of the New York post
office, and was looked upon as a privileged
character, beit»£ the oldest employe. When
the ground was broken for the new post
office in the City Hall Park he turned up
the first spadeful of earth, special prefer
ment being shown to him on account ot h*s
ago.—,Vfif I ovk ]l orld.
There is a regular decrease, year by year,
in the quantity of trine taken into Pans,
which is supposed to be a consequence ot
the high duties. Cider, on the contrary, is
token in constantly greater q ua n ti t ies, and
the proportion in 187Î is eight times greater
than for 1873.
Tho hoard earns to order at eleven
o'clock. All the members present On mo
tion of Mr. Anderson, the tending ot the
minâtes was dispensed with.
President Wells suggested that it would
facilitate the business of the board to ex
clude all persons but connsel on the Démo
cratie and Republican sides, reporters and
candidates, or their representatives, of the
parish the returns of which were being can*
vassed. The suggestion ot the president
was favorably received by the board, and
adopted as a rule.
The returns from the parish of Rapides
were then taken up and canvassed.
This is another ot the»» parishes in the
northern part of onr State where tho voice
of Republicans has been stifled by the
reign of terror inaugurated by the White
League in the early part of last summer,
and kept up until after the election.
Rapides, In a free and fair election, under
our present law of suffrage, has repeatedly
gone Republican by majorities ranging from
1200 to 1500; hat, according to tho returns
of the late election in that parish, made to
the Returning Board, the White Leaguers,
by intimidating voters, have succeeded in
making it appear that the Democrats have
carried the parish by the snug little major*
ity of between 300 and 400 voters.
The returns show that Moncuro received
1584 votes, and Dubnclet 1232,
Republican counsel bave entered protests
against the returns of five of the polls of
Rapides, and the correct result of the elec
tion in that parish can not be known until
the Returning Board has duly considered
them and promulgated the result.
The returns from the parish ot Red River
were next taken up and canvassed. These
returns were aecompained by a number of
statements signed and sworn to before
persons duly authorized to administer
oaths. The signers are of both political
parties, and the statements agree in re
presenting that the voters of Red River
parish, though it did go Republican,
have, like Rapides and many other parishes
in that section of our Stae, severely felt the
intimidating effects of the - bloody work
inaugurated by the White Leaguers as a
means of driving Republicans from the
polls. The statements made by Repub
licans represent that many Republicans
were threatened and driven from the polls
by men armed with, rifles, shotguns, pistols
and other warlike weapons; while the state
ments of parties on the other hand repre
sent that a large number of White Leaguers
were actually intimidated by tho presence
of United States troops, and thus prevented
from voting; that in fact they were arrested
on nothing better than suspicion that they
were guilty ot murdering Republicans.
This is certainly very bard oc the White
Leaguers who really have not participated
in these acts of violence, that have served
to so thoroughly intimidate Republicans,
and cut down the Repnblican vote in North
Louisiana many thousand vote*; bnt, as it
is no harder on them than Republicans, it is
to be hoped the Retaining Board will not
throw ont the returns from Red River sim
ply because a few White Leaguers, sus
pected of having killed Republicans, have
been arrested with the aid of United States
troops and thus prevented from voting,
while others of the same order have been
prevented from votiDg through tear of
being arrested, for like reasons and in like
manner, if they went to the polls. This, wo
repeat, is very hard on the innocent White
Leaguers; but as the-order has undoubt
edly imbued its hands freely in the blood of
Republicans, it ehouid not be thought
strange that an effort is made, in the inter
est of society, to briug tho guilty ones to
justice. The Bible says "tha innocent
shall suffer with the guilty," and if
our sinless White Leaguers had remem
bered this and kept out of bad conipany >
they need not have sought hiding places on
the day of election. It is very certain that
if the United States troops had not been
present in Red River parish on tho day of
election, that Republicans would have been
compelled to seek hiding places—not from
fear of the law, but from fear of the law
less; and in that ease the returns from Red
River would have summod np like the re
turns from Bienville and other parishes
where Republicans were not allowed to
vote. It would have been a unanimous
vote for the Democratic ticket. But it is
possible, in that event, that like the vote of
tbis State in the Presidential election of
1868, when the Democrats, by means of
violence, succeeded in carrying it against
Grant, it would have been thrown out.
Therefore, it is far better as it is. The re.
suit of the canvass by the Returning
Board shows that Red River parish has
gone Republican by near 500 majority. In
this parish Dubuclet's vote is 745, and Mon
onre's 265; Dubuclet's majority 480.
The returns from Richland parish were
then taken up and canvassed. It went
Democratic by near 300 votes. Moncure
received 731 votes, Dubuclet 410. There
were no protests.
Judge Sloanaker filed his brief yesterday
in the ease of Gla against the returns from
Carroll parish. The brief accepts the law
cited in the brief of Messrs. Zacharie and
Whitaker, bearing upon the case, as cor
rect, and also the facts in the evidence as
presented by them in said case. The brief
bas the merit of being short and to tho
point. It was received and filed, and will
no doubt, together with other briefs in the
case, be duly weighed and digested by the
board when the Carroll case comes up for
its final decision.
The board took a recess until six o'clock
in the evening.
The evening session of the board was oc
cupied in canvassing the returns from the
parishes ot Tangipahoa, Terrebonne and
Tensas. In Tangipahoa the Democratic
ticket has a majority of over 400 votes.
For State Treasurer, Moncure received 850;
Dubuclet, 456. No protests were entered
against the returns from this parish.
The canvass ot the returns from Terre
bonne did not prove as easy a task as that
of Tangipahoa, only partial returns being
received from polls three, eight, ten and
eleven of Terrebonn« ; and the fact that
these were transmitted in an irregular man
ner, and outside of the channel indicated
by law. gave rise to some discussion as to
whether they should be canvassed. The
president ruled that as partial returns from
these polls were in possession ot the board,
it would be proper to canvass them and
leave the question of their eompilement fo r
the future consideration and judgment of
the board. As the returns now stand, Du
bitclet has received for State Treasurer
1607 votes, and Moncnre 1359.
The returns from thè parish of Tensas
were next taken up and canvassed. Here
the Republicans have a heavy majority.
For State Treasurer Dubuclet received
2865 votes and Moncure 243.
Mr. Cavanac gave notioe that bn would
reserve the right of entering a protest
against these returns, as he thought there
most hens been sobs "■hsnaosgio" to have
obtained each a majority.
Tbs board, on motion, adjourned to meet
again this morning at eleven o'clock.
PUBLIC SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.
Yesterday our public schools—those In
the Sixth and Seventh Municipal Districts—
opened for examination, and the success
was flattering indeed. It was pleasant to
see that there aaS but little effort at un*
usual display, and it was pleasanter to note
that both teachers and pupils gave close
attention to the work before them. As a
general thing, parents and friends of the
scholars failed to attend or show a proper
interest in the examinations.
Napoleon avenue school.
One of the best in the department is the
Napoleon avenue school for girls, and the
only disagreeable feature is that the build*
ing is altogether too small for the number
of children—144. It is not asserting too
much to say that discipline here is nearly
perfect; all is orderly, and the several
classes perform their duties without the
least confusion. There is no halting, and if
class jealousies possibly exist the girls pos
sess suffi oient address to conceal tlmir pas*
hion. The first and second classes are very
forward in their lessons, and a dozen mem
bers of the first class will strive hard to
enter the High School. During tho exer
cises some of the scholars displayed a pffo
liuiency beyond their years. It must be re
meinbered that this building is in tho neigh
borhood of large private schools.
Tho teachers are: Miss E. S. Ressner,
principal; Mis» M. L. Moody, first assistant;
Miss L. Wail, adjunct first assistant; Miss
G. Young, second assistant.
BERLIN—BOYS AND GIKLS.
This primary school is back ot tho Napo
leon avenue car station, and only buildings
are between it and the swamp, which fact
makes the children appear smarter than if
in a more favored locality. There are
eighty-four children, and they are making
good progress in their books. Miss A. M.
Narr, principal; Mrs. M. E. Washington,
assistant. Buildings and furniture very
good.
LINCOLN—BOYS AND GIRLS.
Here are 119 children, and closely packed,
in a tolerably good building, have passable
furniture. It was apparent that both boys
and girls have given strict attention to
their books, and they are confident in re*
spondiog to interrogatories not taken from
regular lessons. There will be ten ap
plicants for promhtion to the high schools,
and it is likely that alt wilt succeed. The
neighborhood, Dufossat and Carondelet
streets, is a pleasant one, surrounded by
pretty homes, but the parent» are to be
blamed for not occasionally visiting the
school. The teachers are: Mrs. II. E. Clark,
principal; Misses L. IVest and S. M. Duffy,
assistants.
colliseum—boys and girls .
Only one room for three teachers and 150
pupils, but even with this disadvantage
everything moves along in fine order. All
the classes have advanced since the last
examination and a disposition to aspire i»
evident. The Sixth District may certainly
boast of this institution.
Teachers—Mrs. M. Jerolletnan, principal;
Misses II. Woods and L. Huston, assistants.
LEONTINE— BOYS AND GIRLS.
Only a tolerable building with poor furni
ture but bright children. The next school
in the order of the programme rails our at
tention to the Leontine—a school situated on
Live Oak, between Leontine and Valmont
streets, of 138 pupils; eighty -four boys and
fifty-four girls.
Tho morning exercises were verbal ex
aminations and reading, etc. In tho after
noon the children assembled in one room
whore their attempts at recitative literature
were represented on a neatly erected stage,
nicely decorated with fiowers and ever
greens, quite lavishly supplied iu this fltral
region of the Crescent City, where flowers
bloom and grow in poetic seclusion from
the dust and influence of tho city's breath.
At one o'clock the bell vai rung summon,
ing the pupils to the afternoon exercises,
when the pupils, headed by their respective
teachers, Mrs. L G. Ancoin, principal: Miss
L. Thiel, first assistant, Miss M. Ferguson
second assistant: Miss S. Evans, third as
sistant, took their designated places to pre
pare lor the coming exerois es.
ANTOINE—BOYS AND GIRLS.
This primary school is located ou Ma ga
zine, between Chestnut and Walnut streets t
and under the superintendence of Mrs. M.
A. Baby, is doing uncomin only well. The
principal is assisted by Miss K. Kelly and
Mrs. C. Gould, who have their rooms in ex
cellent condition. Some of the scholars are
ambitious, and some can vie successfully
with others who make great pretensions.
The condition of this school is satisfactory.
JERSEY—BOYS AND GIRL».
The surrounding» of this school are any
thing but proper. On one side is a public
pound, where noisy boys congregate and
annoy the scholars by using bad language
and breaking the windows. Opposite is a
lumber yard and saw mill, but notwith
standing this the school is in a thriving
condition. Indeed, the children are very
forward, and make their studies a pleasure
There are 134 boys and eighty-one girls on
the rolls.
The teachers are K. Raitton, principal;
Miss L. Wheelwright, first assistant; Mrs.
A. Cannier, second assistant: Miss R. Frye,
second assistant; Miss M. Mulligan, third
assistant.
AUSTERLITZ— ROY# AND GIRLS.
This school is now located on Tchoupiton
las street, three squares above Louisiana
avenue, and is in a flourishing condition, as
teachers and children comprehend the du
ties before them. Parents make frequent
visits, which encourage the children. Each
room is conducted in an uncommonly cred
itable manner, and there has been consider
able improvement.
Teachers—Mrs. M. F. Baptiste, principal;
Mrs. M. C. Dore, first assistant; Miss F. 1.
Dart, second assistant; Miss A. Wall, sec
ond assistant; Miss M. Chateau, third as
sistant.
MAGAZINE—BOYS AND GIRLS.
Under different circumstances thjs school
would soon assume a better position tlian it
occupies to day. The building is located
opposite the Magazine street horse car sta
tion. consequently there is too much noise
and too many people in the vicinity. This
annoyance tends to distract attention from
studies. The attendance is quite regular,
and it can be said that many of the pupils
deserve great praise for their efficiency.
The teachers are—Miss M. McLaughlin,
principal; Mrs. N. S. Torrey, Miss M. E.
Slay, assistants.
MARENGO—BOYS.
This is a large school, containing 200
pupils and seems to be in a fair working
condition and the lads are not backward in
their books. Examination day is a great
event vitk them, they showing signs that
thoy had piopa w d th u i m tor tho oooar
sion. We are sorry to learn that parents
seldom call, although repeatedly invited.
Two scholar# will go to the High School.
Teachers—Mr. T. Carpenter, principal;
Miss V. Gordon, first assistant; Miss J.
Clapp, second assistant; Mrs. E. C. Earhart;
second assistant; Miss 8. M. Ball, third as
sistant; Miss L- Sterling, third assistant
Miss S. Payne, third assistant.
TIIE CARROLLTON SCHOOLS.
A visit to the Jefferson street Boys* and
Girls* School, in the Carrollton portion of
the city, found Mr. Thomas L. Preston,
principal, at the head of a thriving school
averaging about 160 pupils. Mr. l'reston
ha» the cooperation of Miss Dolores L.
Bostick as first assistant. Mis» Anderson,
second assistant, and Miss Nanan J. Kelley,
third assistant. With four rooms and a
good lot, this schoot appears to be well pro
vided for, and the children are attentive to
their studies.
The Washington street school, for boys
and girls, i* under the direction of Miss
Lizzie D. Watson, principal. Misa M. H.
Crafts, first assistant. Mis» M. Mason,
second assistant, and Mrs. Bentley, third
assistant. An exhibition was in progress,
which showed the pupils to good advant
age in declamation, reading and singing.
Master Lao Jacobert delivered a very cred
itable closing address. An average of 176
scholars attend« the Washington street
school.

The Board of Samt,
The hoard of engineer* appointed to
muke final survey« at the mouth ot the
Mississippi and at the site of the proposed
Fort St. Philip canal, bave finished their
labors so far as aotuaT inspection is con
cerned. November 28 and 30, they con
vened in tbis city, and it was arranged they
should be accommodated on tho revenue
cutter John A. Dix, Captain E. A. Freeman,
commanding.
On the first of December the trip was
commenced and «tided yesterday. A
thorough examination ot the passes and the
vicinity of the canal was made. On invita
tion, Captain James B. Eads, who reached
the city about the time of the board, accom
panied them to the Southwest Pass, and
returned on the third instant, much pleased
with bis trip.
The only other guest was Lieutenant
Charles E. L. B. Davis, United States
engineer, who for the past year has been
personally conducting extensive surveys
and observations at and about the several
passes and went with the commission to
point out the location of his work.
The same favorable weather as the guests
of the city enjoyed last week has been ex
perienced by the board and aided their
purpose. This waa fortunate for their
labors are of the utmost importance to us,
more than to any other community, and will
probably result in tho final settlement of
the long vexed outlet question, which, once
settled, we enter on the high road of com
mercial prosperity.
Louisiana Jockey Club.
Yesterday marked the closing day of the
fall meeting of 1871.
Thu attendance was not numerous, n
single thousand including all that were
present. For the first event but four start,
ers put in an appearance. At the start
Leap War took the lead, Pauline Sprague
close tip. Puss Brodnax and Cottrell's entry
waiting for place. The positions were not
altered till near the close, when Pauline
Sprague swept to the front, L-ap Year
keeping elose company, Puss Brodnax third
and Bonnabel'a entry fourth. Tune—2:06.
The second lace was for the consolation
purse, horses that had not won during the
meeting only being allowed to run.
King Amadeus got tho beet of the start,
but soon yielded to Carrie P., who took
fi-st place at the quarter, Mary L. on her
flank, and the others not far behind. Car
rie P. passed under the string first, Crown
Prince second. King Amadeus third, Mary
L. fourth. Captain Jack tilth, and Bob Brit
ton sixth. The time of the second race was
1:59.
The third race was at four mile heats,
and herein came the favorite and many
speculator» to grief. Nelligin won easily
in two straight heats, tho running being far
below the average, even for a muddy track.
The Trouble nt Vicksburc.
The organization of the color line at
Vicksburg has borne it« legitimate fruits—
has culminated in bloodshed. The election
for municipal officers was carried by means
best known to the White Leaguers them
selves. Emboldened by their success there,
they next united to displace the county
officers. Among those displaced was Peter
Crosby, sheriff. He had been elected by an
immense majority in a county intensely Re
publican. The men who voted for him
came in with arms in their hands, as a
posse, to report to him, and sustain his au
thority. They are met by th» armed
White Leaguers of Vicksburg, and three
fights occur between them in a single day.
They were repulsed, aud a score or so were
killed and many wounded. Intense excite,
menl reign« in Vicksburg and the surround
ing country. Rumor« of incendiarism ami
outrage are current, and it i« possible, un*
les» prompt action is had by Governor
Ante* and the United States authorities,
many wicked things may be done by the
infuriated colored men as well as the ag*
gressive whites. By this time United States
Marshal Lake is probably on the spot, and
he will be found equal to tho duty imposed
upon bun of establishing and maintaining
peace.
Bossier Parish.
From a letter from Mr. B. V. O'Neal,
sheriff of Bossier parish, tha following in
teresting items are gathered:
Twelve cases were tried during the past
two weeks, the principal one being that of
Hugh and Panuer Dickson. The«« two
accused were pardoned by Governor Kel
logg, but District Judge R. W. Turner de
ciding tho pardon illegal, the case was
commenced last Wednesday week, and
lasted till Saturday evening, the jury then
returning a verdict of not guilty. Six
cases against other parties resulted iu con
viction.
Cattle stealing seems to be the prevailing
offense there, everything else beiûg quiet
and peaceful, for the following go to the
Penitentiary for varving terms: Kitir
Roach, horse stealing, one year; Orange
Poter, hog stealing, *ix months; Edmuud
Staples, Jr., cow stealing, one year.
There are two insane women now in the
parish jail, and it is bo uncomfortable in
winter that they must be removed to the
the Jackson Asylum. Dr. J. W. Jones, the
superintendent, declares the asylum to be
so crowded that he can only take one, bat
for tho sake of humanity the aceommoda
ÜOM ought to bq stretohed • Uttlq.
Chamber of U
The monthly meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce was held last night.
On motion of Hon. W. W. Howe it was—
Jtetolved, That a committee of five be ap
pointed to report on the expediency and
constitutionality of establishing, by legisla
tive act, a court for the arbitration of mer
cantile disputes at the port of New Orleans.
The chair appointed under this resolution
the following committee: Messrs. \V. W.
Howe. J. M. Sandidge, W. G. Coyle, H. O.
Seixas and J. H. Putnam.
Mr. J. H. Kennard offered the following
resolutions:
Whereas, The early completion of the
Texas Pacific railroad is a matter of great
importance to the interests of the Missis
sippi valley, and is a work of such magni
tude and national value as to justify the
general government in granting the same
liberal aid as ba» been granted in the past
to other great national works; and
Whereas, In our opinion, such aid will be
only an act of justice, and a valuable in
vestment of government funds, in view of
the rapid development of the resource» of
the whole Southwest that would speedily
follow its completion: be it
Kesolrcd, That the plan now proposed by
the Texas Pacific railroad, modifying the
original charter received from the govern
ment meets our cordial approval and we
request the members of Congress from
Louisians to support the measure, and
respectfully me moralize Congress a» a body
to give the matter early attention and
favorable consideration; be it further
Resolved, That in this indorsement of the
modification of the original charter of the
Texas Pacific railroad, this Chamber does
not ask or approve the granting ot govern
ment aid to what are known a» the New
Orleans, Baton Rouge and Yicksbnrg Rail
road Company, and the Vicksburg, Shreve
port and Texas Railroad Company, to
enable said roads to construct lines be
tween Shreveport and New Orleans, and
Shreveport and Vicksburg; be it further
Itcsolcetl, That a shorter connection be
tween New Orleans and the Texas Pacific
railroad, more entitled to government
patronage, and with greater economy, and
of more permanent value to the interest of
the Mississippi valley, can be made than
by the above named Baton Rouge and
Vicksburg railroad, or the Vicksburg,
Shreveport aud Texas railroad, namely a
road that shall connect New Orleans with
the Texas Pacifie at a point further West,
near Central Texas.
Mr. Kennard moved the reference of the
resolutions to a committee on revision,
which committee was subsequently in
structed to report to the Chamber at a
special meeting on Monday, the fourteenth
instant.
Mr. Kennard, In explanation of the reso
lutions, stated that he had at first prepared
a resolution looking only to the indorse
ment of the aid asked by the Texas Paoifio
railroad. He explained that it was pro
posed to deflect tbe railroad perfected to
the Pacifio on the thirty-sixth parallel to a
junction with tbe Texas Pacific, on the
thirty-second parallel, and thence to con
duct tbe roads by a common stem to the
Pacific. He had examined tbe proposition
to secure the aid asked from Congress by
a mortgage of property and franchises, anil
expressed the opinion that no loan from the
government had been better or even as
well secured as was proposed.
Since the preparation of bis resolution he
had seen in the morning paper« that the
bill extending aid to the Pacific railroad con
tained provisions extending similar aid to
two other connecting railroad«. These
roads be did sot think afforded the most
eligible connection between New Orleans
and the Texas Pacific railroad. He was in
dined to think that the moat eligible con
nection would be made at some point on tho
Pacific railroad much farther west than
Shreveport, perhaps it might be found in
the location through Central Texas lately
brought heiore the Chamber and city.
However, ho did not propose action at
this moment or a precipitate decision of
an important question. lie should ask the
Chamber to refer th« question to a com
mitteeon revision, which should report its
opinion on the most- advantageous) location
for a connection between New Orleans aud
tho Texas Pacific railroad,
Mr. Sandiflgo approved, in the main, of
the purport ot the resolutions, but suggested
that it might not be expedient to disap
prove of that section of the hill which
provided aid fora railroad from Shreveport
direct to New Orleans, llo gave the early
history of that road and refered to the deep
interest which New Orleun» had always
taken in this direct connection with North
Louisiana, lie wasof opinion that any grant
of lands along that line would be of little
value since much valuable land had been
covered by the swamp land grants. The
must of the arable public land» had been
entered by private grantees, while tlie re
mainder could be entered under the gradua
tion law at twelve and a half cents an acre.
He mentioned the release of congressional
land grants along the line of the 'road now
S osed to Central Texas, and suggested
a modification of the resolutions as
would not exclude the Shreveport road
from the benefits of the bill.
Mr. Kennard rejoined in explanation of
his views and expressed an apprehension
lest the completion of Eastern connection
with Vicksburg might divert the Pacific
trade East, without affording New Orleans
an opportunity to participate in it.
Mr. Seixae advocated the recognition of
the Texas Central Railroad in tho provi
sions of the bill.
Mr. Oglesby thought it would be well to
separate the resolution indorsing the pro
posed aid to the Texas Pacific, railroad
proper from the special appropriations to
other roads. This resolution having been
adopted, the Chamber could have time to
deliberate upou the most proper mode of
carrying out the important ooject of con
necting New Orleans with tho Texas Pacific
railroad.
Mr. Howe impressed a proper degree et
caution upon the Chamber. There were
questions of vested interest on the part of
a railroad already recognized in the legisla
tion of Congress in regard to that road, and
was not prepated to express an opinion as
to those rights.
Sir. C. G. Forshey favored a distinct re
cognition of the New Orleans ami Texas
Central railroad as the proper beneficiary
to secure To New Orleans a connection with
the Pacific railroad. He would suggest
such an auioudment of the resolution as
would embody and express that opinion,
hut declined to luako any motion to that
effect.
Mr. Bayley replied to the remarks of Mr.
Sandidge in regard to the land grants which
hau been heretofore made by Congress to
the Opelousas and other railroads, and
which had either lapsed or been released.
Ife approved the suggestion of Mr. ijan
didge that these lands should be re-granted
by Uougrese, aud stated that they would
fall, in great part, upon the line of the New
Orleans and Central Tex a» railroad.
The chair, under tho resolution, an
nounced the following committer: Messrs.
K> nnard, Bussey, Gardner, iiayley and
Forshey.
The president announced, under the rule,
the appointment of Messrs. Is H. Gardnt r
and G. Townsend auditors to settle the ac
count of the treasurer
Messrs. Charles J. Johnson and Horace
Hubbs were nominated as new members.
On motion, the rule was suspended, and
they were unanimously ejected.
The president announced that he was en
gaged in filling a deputation of twelve
members of the Chamber to pro
ceed to tho City of Mexico, upon
the invitation of the Merchants' Ex
change of that city, ft was expected
that the deputation would feave for Vera
Cruz on the steamer of the nineteenth
instant. He dwelt upon the vital import
ance to New Orleans of a renewed trade
with Mexico, and expressed the hope that
at least fifty merchants of New Orleans
might be found who would accompany the
deputation and aid in this important en
terprise.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Washington, December 7,1874.
To the Senste and Bouse ot Representative.:
Since the convening of Congress one yeat
ago the nation has undergone a
PROSTRATION IN BUSINESS
And industrie» such as hae not been wit
nessed with us for many years. Speculation
as to the causes for this prostration might be
indulged in without profit, because asmanv
theories would be advanced as there would
be independent writer» who expressed their
own views. Without borrowing upon tbe
subject, without indulging in theories as to
the cause of this prostration, therefore, 1
will call yonr attention only to the fact, and
to some plain questions, as to which it
would seem there ehouid be no disagree
ment. During this prostration two essen
tial elements of prosperity have been most
abundant,
LABOR AND CAPITAL.
Both have been largely unemployed.
Where security has been undoubted, capi
tal has been obtainable at very moderate
rates. Where labor bas been wanted it bas
been found in abundance at cheap rates
compared with wbat of necessaries and
comforts of life could be purchased with
the wages demanded. Two great elements
of prosperity, therefore, have not been de
nied ns. A third might be added. Our
soil and climate are unequaled within the
limits of any contiguous territory under one
nationality for its variety of products to
feed and clothe a people, and in tbe amount
of surplus to spare to feed less tavored peo
ples. Therefore, with these facts in view,
it seems to me that wise statesmanship at
this session of Congress would dictate legis
lation, iguoring the past,
DIRECTING IN PROPER CHANNEL»
These great elements of prosperity toany
people,
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
Debt abroad is the only element that can,
with always a sound currency, enter into
our affairs to cause a continued depression
in the industries and prosperity of our
people. A great conflict for national exist
ence made necessary lor temporary pur
poses the raising of large sums of money from
whatever source obtainable. It was made
necessary, in the wisdom of Congress, and
I do not doubt their wisdom in tbe prem
ises, regarding the necessity of tho times, to
devise a
SYSTEM OF NATIONAL CURRENCY.
Which it proved to be impossible to
keep on a par with the recognized currency
of the civilized world. This begot a spirit
of speculation, involving an extravagance
and luxury not required fur the happiness
or prosperity of a people, and involving
both directly and indirectly foreign indebt
edness. The currency, being of fluctuating
value, and therefore unsafe to hold for leg
itimate transactions requiring money, be
came a subject of speculation in itself.
These two causes, however, have involved
us in a foreign indebtedness contracted in
good faith by borrower and lender, which
should be
PAID IN COIN,
And according to tbe bond agreed upon
when the debt was contracted—gold or its
equivalent. Tbe good faith of the govern
ment can not be* violated toward creditors
without national disgrace. But onr
COMMERCE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED
By American ship building, carrying oapa
city increased, foreign markets sought for
products of the soil and manufactories, to
tbe end that we may be able to pay these
debts. Where a new market can be cre
ated for the sale of onr products, either ot
tho »oil, the mine or the manufactory, a
new means is discovered ot utilizing our
idle capital and labor to tbe advantage of
the whole people. But in my judgment
the first step toward accomplishing this
object is to seenre
A CURRENCY OF FIXED STAPLE VALUE.
A currency good wherever civilization
reigns, one which, if it becomes super
abundant with one people, yrill find a mar
ket with some other; a currency which has
as its basis tbe labor necessary to produce
it which will give to it its value. Gold and
silver are now the recognized mediums of
exchange the civilized world over, and to
this we should return with the least practi
cable delay, iu view of the pledges of the
American Congress When our present legal
tender system was adopted and debt con*
tractcd. There should be no delay, cer
tain] y no unnecessary delay, iu fixing by
legislation a method by which we will re
torn to specie. To thé accomplishment of
this end 1 invito your special attention. I
believe firmly that there cau oo no prosper
ous and permanent revival of business and
industries until a policy is adopted, with
legislation to carry it out, looking to a re*
turn to a specie basis.
It is easy to conceive that the debtor and
speculative classes may think it of Value
to them to make ho called money abundant
until they ean throw a portion of their
burdens upon others; but even these, I be
lieve, would he disappointed in the result if a
course should be pursued which will keep
in doubt tho value of tho legal tender
medium of exchange.
A REVIVAL OF PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRY
Is needed by all classes, by none more than
the holders oi property of whatever sort
with debts to liquidate from realization
upou its sale. But admitting that these
two classes of citizens are benefited by ex
pansion, would it be honest to give it?
Would not the general loss be too great to
justify such reliet ? Would it not he just as
honest and prudent to authorize each debtor
to issue his own legal tenders to the extent
of his liabilities? Than to do this would it
not be safer, for fear of over issues l>y un
scrupulous creditors, to say tbat ull debt
obligations are obliterated in the United
States, and now we commence anew, each
possessing all he lias at the time, free from
incumbrance? These propositions are too
absurd to be entertained for a moment by
thinking or honest people; yet every delay
in preparation for final resumption par
takes of this dishonesty, and is only less in
degree as the hope is held out that a con
venient season will at fast arrive tot th»
good work of
REDEEMING OUR FLEDGE# TO COMMENCE.
It will never come, in my opinion, except
by positive action by Congress, or by na
tional disasters, which will destroy, for a
time, at least, the credit of the individual
and the State at large. A sound currency
might be reached by total bankruptcy anil
discredit of the integrity of the uatiou and
of individuals. I believe it is in the power
of Congres», at this session, to devise such
legislation as will renew confidence, revive
all the industries, start us on a career ot
prosperity to last fur many years, and to
save the credit of the nation and «f tho
people. Step» toward tlio return to a specie
basis are the great requisites to this de
voutly to be sought lor end. There are
others which I may touch upon hereafter.
A nation dealing in a currency below
that of specie in value, labors under two
great disadvantages. First, having no use
lor the world's acknowledged mediums
of exchange, gold and silver. These are
driven cut of the country because there is
no demand for their use. Second, the
medium of exchange in use ireing of a tine
Dialing value, for after all it is only worth
just what it will purchase ol gold aud silver,
metal» having an intrinsic valu», just in
proportion to the honest labor it takes to
produce th> m, a larger margin must he
allowed for profit by the tuanufac urerand
producer, it is months from the date of
production to the date of realization, inter
est upon capital must ho charged, and risk
of fluctuation in the value of that which is
to he received in payment added, hence high
prices, acting as a protection to the foreign
producer who receives nothing in exchange
for the products of his skill and labor ex
cept a currency good at a stable value the
world over. 1c seems to me that nothing is
clearer than that the greater part »1 tho
BURDEN or EXISTING FROSTRATION
For tbe want of a sound financial system
falls upon the working man, who must
after all produce the wealth, and the
salaried man, who superintends and con
ducts business. The burden falls npoli
them in two ways—by the deprivation of
< inployment, aiid by the decreased pur
chasing power of their salarie». It is the
duty of Congress to devise the method ol
correcting the evils which are acknowl
edged to exist, and not mine. But I will
venture to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as absolutely necessary
to a return to (specie payments, the first
great requisite in a
RETURN TO PBOSFBRITY.
Thqlogal tebdor claoMt« the law author
izing the is«no of cnrrancy by the national
government
SHOULD HB JlRFRALRD.
To take «fleet as to all contracts entered
into after a day fixed in the repealing act,
not to apply, however, to payments of sal
aries by government or for other expendi
tures now provided by law to be paid in
cnrrency. In the interval pending between
repeal and final resumption provision
should he made by Which the Secretary of
the Treasury can obtain gold as it may be
come necessary from time to time from tho
date when specie redemption commences.
To this might and should lie added a reve
nue sufficiently in excess of expenses to
insure an
ACCUMULATION OF «OLD IN THK TREASURY
To sustain redemption. J commend this
subject to yonr careful consideration be
lieving that a favorable solution is attain
able, and that if reached by this Congress,
tbat the present and future generations will
ever gratefully remember it as a deliverer
from a thraldom of evil and disgrace. With
resumption,
Tree Banking
May be authorized With safety, giving full
protection to bill holders which they havtt
under existing laws. Indeed, I would re
gard free banking as essential; it would
give proper activity to the currency. As
more currency should be required tor th«
transaction of legitimate business, new
banks would be started, and in turn banks
would wind up their business when it van
found that there was a superabundance of
cnrrency. Tue experience and judgment
of the people can best decide just
HOW MUCH CURRENCY IS REQUIRED
For the transaction of the business of the
country. It is unsafe to leave the settle
ment of this question to Congress, the Secre
tary of the Treasury, or the executive.
Congress should make the regulation under
which banks may exist, but should make
banking a monopoly by limiting tbe amount
ot redeemable paper currency that shall ba
authorized. Such importance do I attach
to this subject and so earnestly do I com
mend it to yonr attention that I give is
prominence by introducing it at the begin
ning of tbis message.
During the past year nothing has occurred
to disturb the general
FRIENDLY AND CORDIAL RELATIONS.
Of the United States with other power#,
Tbe correspondence submitted herewith
between this government and its diplomatic)
representatives, as also with the represen
tatives of other countries, shows a satis
factory condition of all questions between
tbe United States and the most of those
countries, and with few exceptions, to which
reference is hereafter made, the absence of
any points of difference to be adjusted.
The notice directed bv tbe resolution of
Congress of June 17, 1874, to lie given to
terminate the convention of July 47, 1858«
between the
UNITED STATES AND BELGIUM
Has been given, and the treaty will accord
ingly terminate on the first day of July,
1775. This convention secured to certain
Belgian vessels entering the ports of the
United States exceptional privileges which
are not accorded to onr own vessels. Other
features of the convention have proved sat
isfactory, and have tended to-the cultiva
tion of mutually beneficial commercial in
tercourse and friendly relations between
the two countries. I hope that negotiations
which have been invited will result in the
celebration of another treaty which may
tend to the interests of both countries, Ouf
RELATIONS WITH CHINA
Continue to be friendly. Dating the pus!
year the fear of hostilities between China
and Japan, growing out ot the land ing «I
an armed torce upon tbe
ISLAND OF FORMOSA
By the latter has occasioned uneasiness,
It is earnestly hoped, however, tbat tha
difficulties arising from this eause wi II ba
adjusted, and that the advance of civiliza
tion in these empires may not bn retarded
by a state of war. In consequence of tho
part taken by certain citizens of the United
States in this expedition, our represent
atives in these countries have been in
structed to iiuprcH» upon tho governments
of China ami Japan the firm intcniiuu ol
this country to maintain
STRICT NEUTRALITY.
In the event of hostilities, and to carefully
prevent any infraction of law on tho part
of our citizens. In connection with (hi«
subject I call the attention of Congics» to it
generally eoncedtd fact, that tho great pro
portion of tbo
CHINESE EMIGRANTS
Who t-onie to our shores do not corn« volun
tarily, to make their homes with ns, miff
their labor productive ot general prosper
ity, but come under contracts with luiad
men who own them almost absolutely. In
a worse form does tbis apply to Chines»
women. Hardly a perceptible percentage
of them pertorm any houorabln lauor, tut
they are brought for shameful purposes, to
the disgrace of the communities where they
are settled, and the great demoralization oi*
the youth of those localities. If this evil
practice can be legislated against It Will bo
my pleasure, as well as duty, to enforce any
regulation to secure so desirable au «mi.
It is hoped tbe negotiation» between tlnj
GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN
And the treaty power» looking to the fur
ther opening of tho empire, and to tho re
moval of varions restrictions upon trad»
and travel, may. soon produce tho result«
desired, which can not fail to inure to the
benefit ot all the parties. Having on pre
vious occasions submitted to the considera
tion of Congress the propriety of the re
lease of the Japanese government from the
further payment of the
INDEMNITY
Under the convention of October 2', 1861,
and as no action bad been taken thereon,
it becanio my duty to regard the ebligu
tions of the convention as in force, and a#
the other powers interested had received
their portion of tho indemnity in full, tha
minister ot the United States iu Japan fia»,
in behalf of this government, received tha
remainder «f the amount due ta tho Unit' d
States under the convention of Siiunouh-ki.
I submit the propriety ol applying the in
come of a part, it not *>f tig; wholts of this
sum, to the
EDUCATION ta! THE JAPANESE LANOL'AtJfl
Of a number of young men ta be under
obligations te serve the government for »
specified time as interpreter» at the lega
tion and consulates in Japan. A limited
number of Japanese youths might «t th#
same time be educated iu our own vernacu
lar, and mutual benefits would result ta
both governments. The importance of h::v
ing ourown citizens competent and familiar
with the language of Japan to act as inter
preters and in other capacities connected
with the legation and consulate» in that
country can not readily be overestimated.
The amount awarded ta the gascnwneul
of Great Britain by the

and was paid upon the twenty first day of
