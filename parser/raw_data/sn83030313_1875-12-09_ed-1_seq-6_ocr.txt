Spain's Latest diplomatic communication
to our government is said to be conciliatory,
lmt evasive of the main point at issue?the
pacification of Cuba. It is argued cogently
that the President's reasoning in his Message
leaves his hands untied for graver action than
conceding belligerent right* to the patriots.

Tin President, the Republican Party
and the School Hunlion.
The .Message of the President in so admira
ble in its must important features that we
criticise it with regret. It disappoints the
fears and in some respects the expectations
of the continuity. On the Cuban question
it is conservative and temperate and at the
same time consonant, in harmony with the
dignity of a great nation. On the Mexican
| question the President shows due respect for
i the intentions and embarrassments of a
neighboring Republic. On the financial
question he sustains his record on the na
tional credit. On minor points, such as the
Post Office, naturalization and the Interna
tional Exhibition, he speaks with propriety
and force. We question if this Message will
not be regarded as the ablest that has been
written by the President, and among the
best that we have ever had from any Chief
Magistrate.
When we consider the temptations which
surrounded the President in dealing with
Cuba and Mexico?to use the army and navy
and the discipline of a powerful- political
party to force the country into a controversy
that would muKP a third term necessary?we
must do the President the justice to say that
he has shown a spirit of self-denial and
courage. We like General Grant so much
and have so profound a respect for his mili
tary career and his personal honesty that we |
would much rather praise than censure him.
Whatever opinion the critics of this genera
tion may express of him, in good report or
evil report, he must for all time be among the
illustrious figures of our history. The Presi
dent is not merely the head of Executive
power, but the type and symbol of military
greatness. He is one of the men who will be
to our children what Marlborough and Wei- '
lington are to Englund, what Turenne and
Napoleon are to France.
The serious blunder in this Message is the
recommendations on the school and church
questions. General Grant proposes thut the
States should be required to afford '-an op
portunity for good common school education
to every child within their limits." He sug
gests that no sectarian tenets "shall ever be
taught in any school supported in whole or
in part by the State or nation, or by the pro
ceeds of any tax levied upon any commu
nity." This education should be made com
pulsory so far as to disfranchise illiterate
persons after the year He believes that
all church property should bear its propor
tion of taxation. He thinks the centennial
year the timo when these measures could
properly be put into force. Wo note as a
striking coincidence that Mr. Blaino, in a
letter which we publish elsewhere, written
on the 20th of October, took prominent
ground in the same direction. Mr. Blaine's
points are worthy of careful consideration,
especially when compared with those of the
President, as throwing light upon this at
tempt to bring the question of religion and
education into republican politics. Mr.
Blame argues that a majority of the people
can, as the constitution now stands, " if they
desire it, have an established church, under
which the minority may be taxed for the
erection of church edifices which they never
enter and the support of which they do not '
believe in." Ho shows that this power, j
which really exists, has been exercised ; that !
the auspicious time to guard against an evil
is when all will unite in preventing it He
proposes to cure this "constitutional de
fect," and with it "all possibility of hurtful
agitation on the school question," by adding
the "old Jefferson and Madison amend
ment " to the constitution, as follows :?
No Slate shall make any law respectiiii; an establish
ment of religion or prohibiting the Irop extreme
thereof, and no money rais.-d by taxation In any State
for the support ot tlie public kcIiooIm, or derived from
any public luud therelor, shall ever be under the con
trol ol any religious ?eet, nor nhall any money so
raised ev<-r be tlivided between religious sects or de
nominations.
This amendment is virtually what General
Grant recommends in his Messago. The
difference between the two is that Mr. Blaine
speaks as the leader of a party, anxious to
make party capital, while President Grant
speaks as thfe head of the nation, responsible
to the constitution for his recommendations
to Congress. President Grant's blunder,
like that of Mr. Blaine, is in giving life to an
issue that did not exist. The President's
Message shows that he is under the Method
ist influence. He is known to be an ostenta
tious, if not an altogether orthodox, member
of the Methodist Church. Since he has
been in the White House we have observed a
tendency to surround himsolf with Methodist
clergymen, to be much under the guidanco
of ifethodist bishops, to appoint the favor
ites of Methodist prelates to important
places and to send Methodist priests wan
dering around the world at government ex
pense when they needed a rest from their
spiritual laltors. Now, President Grant has
too much common sense, we should hope,
and is too much of a soldier and practical
man to fall under the influence of any
quality of priest, be it Methodist or not.
r! he danger of his position may be under
stood if we suppose him as much in the com
pany of Jesuits or Franciscans as of Metho
dists. How this country would resound
from the forests of Maine to the shores of
Lower California with invectives upon "the
proselyting spirit of Rome" and "the dark
influence of the Jesuits" and "the attempt to
revive the horrors of tho Inquisition" and 1
the persecuting fires of Savoy! With what
fervor, with what vehemence, with what de- j
nunciatory rhetoric, with what direct ap
plication of tho terrible imprecations of
Holy Writ would the clergymen of
the Protestant Church denounce the Presi
dent who was influenced by the priests of
the Church of Rome as President Grant is
now by the priosts of tho Methodist faith !
To show to what an extent this courting a
religious influence by a President and poli
tician may reach, read the extraordinary
speech of Bishop Haven, the Methodist prel
ate who, in Boston, the other clay, proposed
that Grant should be nominated for a thi\l
term. The indecency of this exhibition, if
we may use the word without personal
offence in speaking of a clergyman of a ro
spectablo Church, consists not alone in tho
bringing of religion into th? unhallowed
waters of politics, but in tho evil that it will
necessarily inflict upon the Church itself.
There is no maxim of free government
clearer than that between Church and State
there should be a complete separation. This j
separation should be in fact as well as in
name. It ia not enough for our consti
tution to lay it down as a law, if
our Presidents, who Hupport and defend
the constitution, break it in practice. Presi
dent Grant has done more than any other
President to transcend this salutary law by
surrounding himself by a Mothodist court
and showing that his administration never
fails to respond to the influence of Mothodist
priests.
To this influence we trace this wanton
throwing of this "school" firebrand into our
politics. We repeat that this is not only a
danger to our govtf^mimt, but to the Church
itself. We hold Methodism in high honor.
It has done much toward the civilization of
this New World. It has brought into reli
gion life, courage, sincerity, tolerance and
freedom, and a resolute driving on and on
toward religious aims that we see in no other
Protestant faith. No greater calamity could
befall this Church, its honored prelates and
its devoted members, than for its priests to
attempt to control the administration of the
country. When one sect, no matter whether
, Protestant or Catholic, aims for political
power, the tendency is to unite all other sects
against it and to bring scandal and reproach
upon it, and in the end to do harm to the
true spirit of religion. Therefore, President
Grant in his Message has made a double
error?first, as the head of the country call
ing into being a question sure to excite the
auimosities of sects; second, in throwing
upou his Church, if he respects and loves it,
the odium of dabbling in politics. There is
no more danger to the free schools of
America than there is to tho free press.
This phantom of "religious interference in
education" is a political Will-o'-the-wisp
which appears when a party is in distress.
It is invoked every generation by dema
gogues who would gain political power. It
is unworthy of General Grant, altogether un
worthy of his position as President, his fame
as a soldier, his character as a man of com
mon sense. We dwell upon it with pain as
the one blot in a Message which otherwise
meets our warmest commendation and
which without this would have stood out
among the ablest, most conservative and
most patriotic documents ever addressed to
the American people by an American Presi
dent.
The Wreck of the UruUi liinnd.
Our cable despatch from London gives im
portant details of this calamity, derived di
rectly from the Captain. It appears that tho
ship was out of her reckoning and that an
error in her course consequent upon that fact
led to the accident. The North Hinder light
ship is off the Belgian coast and about one
degree of longitude east of Margate or the
mouth of the Thames. The Galloper light
is about half a d??gree east of the same point
and in a line about twenty minutes north of
the North Hinder light. The Galloper
warns off from the dangerous sands of the
Essex coast and bids the mariner making
down the channel to keep to the south. The
Hinder warns from the dangers of the oppo
site continental coast and warns tho mariner
to keep to seaward in bad weather or to the
west and north. Now this light, if
sighted from the starboard by a ship sailing
west, warns to keep in one direction; while
the Galloper, sighted in the same way, warns
to keep in quito another direction. The
North Hinder, in plain English, says keep to
the right; the Galloper says keop to the left.
Let the lights be mistaken for one another;
let the warning given by the North Hinder
be obeyed in sight of tho Galloper, and
calamity is inevitable. This is precisely
what happened. As there could have been
no observation in the storm the ship's posi
tion was taken by dead reckoning, and suffi
cient allowance was not made for the force
with which the gale from tho northeast had
driven her westward. She had made two
hundred and fifty miles in about twenty
hours, and she probably could not
make this in ordinary circumstances. At the
time the light was sighted sho was, therefore,
Home forty miles further westward than tho
C.iptain, not making sufficient allowance
for the wind, had reason to suppose she
was ; and, not believing himself yet far
enough upon his journey to sight the Gal
loper, ho was forced to the conclusion that the
light seen was the nearer North Hinder.
From this it would appear that there is no
difference between these two lights by which
they may be distinguished one from the
other. As explained by tho Captain's state
ment, the calamity was clearly enough the
result of an error ; but it is difficult to say
that this error might not have been com
mitted by any man. In fact, this looks like
one of those shipwrecks that cannot be
guarded against by caution or skill?
unless tho world of commerce and
travel is ready to accept a rule that ships
shall not put to sea in a storm. This ship
went down Wore she was twenty-four hours
out. It had stormed all the time. Celestial
observation was, thereforo, impossible, and
the judgment of a ship's position by dead
reckoning is delusive, and ample experience
may be deceived in it. Yet it was upon tho
determination of the Deutschland's position
by this means that it depended whether the
light seen was one in view of which sho
might safely keep on her course or one in
view of which to keep on her course was cer
tain ruin. In tho presence of such a catas
trophe there is little consolation to be given
to the bereaved, and yo,t there must be some
in the reflection that the lost ones were not
the victims of the heedless incapacity that
destroys so many lives on ocean steamers.
The Mcbdehek Dki.ankt, who is to be
hanged to-morrow at Hempstead, has made
a confession which compresses into a life
time of twenty-four years as much utter de
pravity a* a dime novelist would think of
distributing among a whole fleet of pirates.

lawlessness, which can alono make au?h a

iron Bill," will reconcilo tho community to
the loss it is about to suffer in his sudden re
moval from life. The extraordinary docu
ment will be found elsewhere.
The Cuban Question overshadows in
Washington the work of Congress for tho
present. Is it intended that the doings of
the Executive shall dwarf tho action of the
Legislature, one wing of which has a ma
jority hostile to tho republican party ?
Cant from Washington.
Congress opened its session on Monday.
The Message has been read. We are, we
trust, to have a little peace until the com
mittees of the Ilonae are announced. In the
meantime the correspondents of the party
press are busy, and we read their elaborate
lucubrations with interest and curiosity.
We note the old canting strain. One
would think from reading the despatches
that Washington is divided into two
camps?one of the absolutely good and
the othor of the absolutely bad. We are
told of the fights between the "rings;" how
Tom Scott owns one man, and how another
is the creature of Credit Mobilier. We
have pictures of Mr. Kerr "sitting in his
parlor," holding aloof, making no promises,
giving no pledges; a man of lofty and ideal
virtue, despising political machinery and
manoeuvring, with his head in the clouds
and his thoughts ever ascending to the purer
atmosphere. Then we have a glowing, graphic
picture of Fernando Wood "in his library,
surrounded by his books," proudly turning
aside from the Speakership contest as some
thing beneath him, as a "dirty business in
which he would not put his hands. 1 he im
pressions we gather from Mr. Wood, as he is
thus painted, is that in a time of Roman vir
tue and purity of public life he would have
been chosen Speaker without opposition. As
it is, he ia sacrificed to the decadence of
the times. Then we have a beautiful pic
ture?small cabinet size, done in the style of
the old Dutch masters?of Sunset Cox sitting
at one end of the table, and, upon hearing
the result of the second caucus ballot, order
ing Mr. Howitt lo direct his friends to sup
port Mr. Kerr. Then we have him approach
ing Mr. Kerr, and saying, in his sweet, chirp
ing, canary-bird tone, that in doing this# he
had no selfish aim ; that all he wanted was
to be appointed a member of his old Com
mittee on llules ! TJu* beautiful picture is
illustrated by a figure of our glorious Mayor
Wickham in the background, beaming jo
vially upon tho party, and "Light Horse
Harry" Watterson, of the Louisville Grurier
Journal, nodding in the corner of the room
alter the fatigues of the day.
Then we have another picture, in dark
Ribera tints, of Randall, of Pennsylvania,
surrounded by lobbyists and gamblers and
pool sellers, owned by Tom Scott, of Penn- ;
sylvania, his record covered over with salary j
grab and other mistakes -altogether such a ;
character as would compel his immediate j
expulsion from the House by a party ]
"anxious for purity and good govern
rnent." But all of a sudden the caucus |
ends and the scene changes. Wood descends j
from his library to bo a candidate tor the
chairmanship of one of the committees, and :
Randall is brought forward, after all. as the
real leader of the party anxious for "reform;"
and Mr. Cox, who is said to have views on
hard money which no one could discover
when he was in Ohio last fall, is to have
charge of the Committee on Ranking and
Currency. The democratio party is har
monizing. There are no more intrigues, no
more jobs. Tom Scott's name is not even
mentioned. The wliol<> panorama?thievery
and corruption and conspiracy?sinks out of
sight, and the party stands before us "ready
for reform."
These pictures would be interesting if
they had any value. They represent the
cant of these Washington correspondents. It
is, especially in the party press, a dreary, dis
tasteful, untrustworthy business; and these
correspondents write simply from their own
feelings, from the desire to help or hurt-as
partisans, not as spectators. The truth is
that Mr. Cox and Mr. Kerr and Mr. Wood
and Mr. Randall and Mr. Lamar and all the
rest of them are politicians anxious for their
own advancement They have risen into pub
lic life by politics. They have been in that
business for years. They are all tarred with
the same stick. They know the schemes,
the tricks, the subterfuges, the whole cate
chism from beginning to end. Mr. Kerr, with
all of his ''honesty," could no more go through
an Indiana Convention or canvass for Con
gress without twisting and bending than ho
could ascend into the heavens like Elijah.
Mr. Kerr is no better than Mr. Randall; no
worse than Mr. Randall or Mr. Cox or Mr.
Wood. They are all of a class. They have
their virtues and their faults, and so far
from any election of the Speakership or
any nomination of committees represent
ing honesty against dishonesty the elec
tion might as well have been done by a
page, blindfolded, putting his hand into
a box and taking out the first name. The
democratic majority met, first and above -all
things, to destroy the administration and
build up their own party. They mean to
carry on the affairs of the government and
make as much capital as they can. All this
cant about superfine honesty and desire for
reform is midsummer moonshine.
Cable Rate* and Cheap Telegraphy.
We have several rumors from the conflicting
cable companies as to what they will do in
the way of rates. It seems that the old com
pany and the new company are endeavoring
to agree upon a general uniform tariff. It
would bo a mistake for the new company to
do anything of the kind. It has less capital
stock than the old company, and necessarily
needs to earn a smaller rate. The old com- ;
pany is governed by the Bourbon policy of
making all the money possible out of the
wants of the people and of treating tha
electric occupation of the high seas as a
monopoly. The new company will make f
a great deal more money by cheaper rates
than by continuing on the basis laid down
by the old company. The value of the oable |
is in its general use. People should be
taught to uso it. The press should be en- 1
couraged to send columns of news from Eu- 1
rope where they now send paragraphs. The j
wires should be kept at work to their fullest
capacity. When one wire will not do thero
should bo ten to follow it The argument in !
favor of cheap telegraphy is the old argu- j
mcnt in favor of cheap postage, cheap 1
newspapers and the cheapness of every arti
cle that belongs to general consumption.
We are convinced that if the new company
will only be wise to adopt fe rate of, say a
shilling a word, and hold it there for a year or
two, they will make a business large enough
to compel the building of other cables. At
the same time they will unite England and
America by ties of even closc commercial
, and personal intimacy.
The National Finance".
It ia to be hoped that the democrat* In
Congress will huve sense enough to give Mr.
Briatow's recommendations fair treatment
Legislation at this session, settling the pol
icy of resumption in 187'J by providing ad
equate means for itB attainment, would take
thut issue out of politics and Bave the demo
cratic party from the most embarrassing
question which threatens to disturb its
harmony next year. If measures looking to
resumption are defeated by democratic oppo
sition the party will be justly chargeable
with hostility to specie payments and be
sunk by the same millstone which was tied
to its neck in Ohio.
Of course the recommendations of the Sec
retary are susceptible of improvement, and
the democrats may render them more accept
able to the country by friendly amendments
to the bills intended to carry out this ob
ject. The question will probably be lirst
taken up in the Senate, and the control of
the republicans in that body will make it
easy to pass the necessary measures. W hen
they are sent to the House the democrats can
lose nothing by weighing them fairly on
their merits. We see no objection which
the hard money democrats can make to the
plan of funding the greenbacks as
an important step toward specie pay
ments. There is, indeed, room for differ
ences as to details, but none with
respect to the main feature of the recommen
dation. The other measures proposed by
Mr. Bristow are such as ought to commend
them to honest men of all parties. Besides
funding a part of the greenbacks tho govern
ment ought to accumulate a stock of gold,
and Mr. Bristow's plan for doing it seems in
most respects unexceptionable. There is no
reason why the ttee tradfc and hard money
democrats should refuse to vote for the res
toration of the duties on coffee and tea, which
would bring a considerable sum into the
Treasury without perceptibly adding to their
cost. His recommendations for consol
idating the customs districts. for
abolishing the minor custom houses,'
and thereby dispensing with needless
officers, for reducing the thousands of arti
cles on which duties are levied to a smaller
number, and simplifying the business of col
lection and making it more efficient, and for
guarding against frauds in valuation by sub
stituting specific for ad valorem duties, are
all in the direction of reform, and ought not
to be opposed for party reasons. The demo
crats in this Congress have everything to
gain by candor, moderation and sincere aid
to all the sound measures proposed by their
political opponents. They acquire and
strengthen public confidence by convincing
the country that they may be safely trusted
with tho possession of power.
"The Restoration of the Boarboni."
When wo called attention recently to tho
beautiful arrangement which had been made
by the democrats for the government of the
majority of the House we little thought that
our mounting hopes would so soon fall.
Speaking from democratic authority?nay,
from no less a source of inspiration than
the weird and beautiful Washington corre
spondence of the World?we pointed out
how the successful House had selected
three members that were to be a trium
virate. The first was Kerr, The Man of
Honesty. The second was Randall, The Man
of Capacity. The third was Wood, The Man
of Deportment By this arrangement Kerr
was to be Speaker, Randall leader of the
House, and Wood to be "Mentor," as the
gifted correspondent puts it, or "referee,"
to make the word plainer to the general
mind. But it seems that a party thus com
manded has fallen into error in its first cam
paign, and altogether through the interfer
ence of its "Mentor," or "referee."
The story of this discomfiture, has been
told in the papers, but there is one point
about it which has escaped observa
tion. It is reported that Mr. Kerr and
Mr Wood "advised together" as to tho
course to be pursued in the Louis
iana matter. Mr. Randall does not seem
to have been admitted to the conference.
Perhaps The Man of Honesty and The Man of
Deportment did not c&re to be governed by
The Man of Capacity at so early a date. So the
battle was fought and lost 1 he point of this
controversy is too grave to be overlooked. It
shows beyond peradventure that the warning
of the Hibald against the restoration of the
Bourbons was timely. The very first act
of the leaders of the democratic - party
is in itself revolutionary to the highest
degree. In the first place, tho demo
crate put themselves on the record as
attempting to violate a sacred compact
namely, that compact made between dem
ocrats and republicans in Louisiana, to the
effect that if Kellogg was recognized as Gov
ernor the republicans would recognize the
democrats in the Legislature. This com
pact, clearly understood, agreed upon
as a settlement of a grave question which
might have caused a revolution, and meant
for the best interests of the State and of
the country, is calmly thrown aside by these
Bourbons in -tho first hours of their victory.
Tho second point is that Mr. Wood, in ask
ing the democratic majority to recognize tho
government of McEnery, put himself in tho
position of a direct advocacy of rebellion.
Mr. Wood cannot have forgotten that tho
President treated McEnery's government as
rebellion, commanded it to disperse within
five days, and bade the army and navy to be
ready to rueh upon Louisiana tho moment
his commands were disobeyed. Ami yet
this movement, which stands in the history
of the country to-day as much an act of re
bellion in intent as tho firing upon Fort
Sumter, is indorsed by tho action of tho
leaders of the democratic party.
We say now as we have said before, and
we cannot bo too earnest in repeating it, that
if this democratic party moans to return tho
country to the rule of the Bourbons it leads
to its own ruin. For while the country
elected democrats to power, and would gladly
continue them there, it was for th? purpose
of reforming the government; that they
might act as a grand inquest upon tho ad
ministration of the republican party for tho
last fiftoon or twenty years ; that they
might brush away tho few remnants of pro
scription and ostracism which remained as
legacies of tho war. It was not that they
should endeavor to restore the power that
v was onlv broken down bv tho oxueudituro
of thousanas of million*' of dollars and th?
wanting of hundreds of thousands of live*.
When the Bourbons came back to Franc#
their first act was to regard the Revolution
as nothing, and all the events that had tran
spired between 1793 and 1815 as never having
occurred. We know what came of that
effort. The Bourbons lingerod along for ?
few years and finally were dismissed from
France with the oontempt of their people.
They have lived ever since in exile. If Mr.
Wood and his triumvirate propose to lead
the democratic party into the same path by
relating the foolish and mischievous?wo
might almost say criminal?action of Mon
day, the end will be the triumph of the re
publican party at the next election, even if
it should have General Grant at its head an
a candidate for the third term.
The Herald as a N?w*ji?per.
Yesterday's Herald contained seventy ?
columns of reading matter?the most varied,
interesting and valuable collection of intelli
gence, perhaps, ever presented to the publio
in a single copy of a daily paper.
Our special cable despatches from London
and Madrid were of great interest. In tho>
former was told tho thrilling story of the losa^
of the Deutschland. This was illustrated'
with a map of that part of the English coast
where the disaster occurred, showing all tho
treacherous sands of that dangerous sea.
The messages of the President and the Sec
rotary of the Treasury, making a page each,
were printed in the same issue with tho
shorter story of the Secretary of the Interior.
Fuller particulars of Tweed's escape were
givep, with the report of a minute examina
tion of a large portion of the district
drained for tho Croton water. AIL
the news by telegraph from Europe
and all parts of our own country;
our usually full reports of current events, j
decisions of courts and similar topics of;
local interest ; our unexampled collection
of ship news, our commercial and financial
intelligence and a full page of literary criti
cism ; all this together constitutes a budget'
of news such as is not every day presented
even in this paper?and never in any other.
Different newspapers are- conducted on
very different theories. News is to be gath
ered by an extensive organization of appro
priate machinery, and it is to be presented
with inoro or less editorial skill. Some jour
nals that do not gather a gTeat deal plume
themselves greatly on tho taste and dainti
ness and literary nicety with which they set
that little beforo their readers. No doubt
if a man has only a radish and a
cracker for breakfast it is better to
have this put beforo him with all tha
accessories of snow white table linen
and cut glass saltcellars. It is well to feed
his eye if you are compelled to leave his
more craving appetite not altogether satis
fied. And in this sense those of our contem
poraries who cultivate journalistic art fill
their small sphere completely and use
fully.
Our own opinion is that the public needs
a hearty meal in the matter of news and
likes also to have it served neatly and dec
orously, and our extensive organization for
the gathering of news, covering every ship
frequented sea, every civilized country and
several uncivilized countries, our provisions
for the capable discussion of public topics
and the mechanical resources for putting all
the matter thus furnished in a handsomely
printed form in the hands of the reader, aro
all without rivalry in extent and effective
ness.
Our latest features of a regular Sunday
letter of gossip by cable from Paris and of
financial intelligence by cuble from London
are intended to be permanent additions to
our news machinery, and our London bu
reau and our extensive Paris office and read
ing room will not only be rallying points for
our countrymen abroad, but will afford ua
great facilities for carrying out a still larger
prograauno for the use of the cable.

Jules Verne's latest story of "The Mysterious Island
Abandoned" speaks of "Vineyard" (probably Martha's)
as a wballag port In the State of New York. Then
Jules Verne, speaking of an albatross which had been
captured, says:?"Perhaps In his heart Gideon Spillett,
in whom the Journalist sometimes camo to Uie snr
face, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending
forth to take its chanoe an exciting article relating ilio
adventures of the settlers In Lincoln Island. What a
success for the authorized reoortor of the N*w York

article If It should ever reach tho address of ft* pro

and broad experience and comprehonaive statesman.

they must feel more than any ono elso the falling away

adds:?"Victory will perch upon our banner again

purposes of citizens, to their deepest faith in tho right
and In the Republic, and refnso to palter with palrun
