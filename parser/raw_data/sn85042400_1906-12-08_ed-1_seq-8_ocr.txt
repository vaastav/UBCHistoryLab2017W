COMMERCIAL WAR WITH JAPAN
General Miller Believes That Unlets
the United 8tates Take Some Ac
tlon Japan Will Control the
Merchant Marine.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. Among
the passengers on the steamer Siberia
which sailed for the Orient today was
Consul General II. B. Miller, who Is
returning; to his post at Yokohama. He
addressed 1.200 students at the Uni
versity of California, this morning on
the relations between the United
States and Japan. He.eald: "Thoughts
of war are the lightest thoughts Ja
pan has today. The test of the fu
ture between Japan and the United
States will not be a conflict of ar
mies and armament, but will be a war
for Industrial supremacy. Japan Is
now reaching out for the world's com
merce, and I predict that unless this
country makes rapid progress along
a line In which It is showing little
disposition to progress, Japan will
soon be In absolute control of the
merchant marine of the Pacific.

and Chines.

Is unalterably opposed to Joint occu
pancy of public schoolrooms by Jap
anese or Chine and our white chil
dren." said Governor Chamberlain to
day. "We are also aglnst admission
of Chinese or Japanese coolies. The
present controversy over the Japanese
has assumed a phase which calls for
application of more common sense
than has been manifested In some
quarters. The Interpretation ot treaties
rests solely with the court and cer
tainly not with the executive branch
of the government, through the mili
tary, aa President Roosevelt threat
ens. "It appears to me that the adminis
tration Is Inconsistent In attempting
to force association In the public
schools of an Inferior mee with whit
children, when here In the District of
Columbia, there ,1s a system of sep
arate schools for whites and negroes.
"Let the President and Congress
demonstrate here the theory of such
association before trying to force ob
jectionable policies on the people of
the Paelflc Coast."
