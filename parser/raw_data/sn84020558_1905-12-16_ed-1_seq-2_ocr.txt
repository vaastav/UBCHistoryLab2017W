Every once in a while a very disa
greeable form of amusement strikes
the youth of this and other cities. That
is to arm themselves with small pock
et mirrors and go about the streets
and reflect the sunlight into people's
faces and into business houses. Com-
about it and the officers are watching
for the troublesome youth. 1

the eastern end of , the P. " & .E. He
says the masonry work on the founda
tions of the j permanent steel, biilge
over the Gila, this side of Kelvin, is
progressing rapidly and will probably
be finisihed in ten days. There is liable
though, to be some delay then on ac
count of the steel which has not yet
arrived.
CAPITALISTS CAUGHT UP
Among the delinquents who faced Jus
tice Hurnett yesterday morning were .
two men whose names appear on the
docket as John Doe and Robert K e. I
If the name of one of them is
Doe the other ought to be also, for
they look enough alik? to be the Mul
cahys. Their real names have not been
made public, but it Is known that they j
are eastern men who came here a day
or two ago to conclude an important
mining deal. They were arrested for
fighting, and at the time they were
taken both were drunk. They were

Might and Right.
In the opinion of the Kansas City
Journal the might, in the absense of
obligation, to which the president al
luded in his message regarding the
territories, does not make right. It
says:
Senator Foraker's amendment to the
omnibus statehood bill is so manifestly
fair and equitable that It ought not to
meet with serious opposition in or out
of congress. It does not antagonize th9
interests of Oklahoma and Indian Ter
ritory, and It insures a square deal for
New Mexico and Arizona.
The Foraker amendment Is that tho
ratification of the constitution for the
new states shall be voted on by the
people "in each of said territories."
This will preserve to the people of the
territories the dearest political right of
any people, the consent of the governed.
President Roosevelt's assumption that
the territorial subdivisions are mere
matters of convenience and that the
people who live In them need not be
consulted In any disposition of them
w hich congress may choose to make, is
true only as a technical construction of
law. As a matter of justice and equity
no government and no political con
ditions should be imposed upon a peo
ple without their consent. This prin
ciple is part of the warp and woof of
American Institutions, and it Is the
main bulwark of a free people against
tyranny and oppression. The political
tyranny which would force Arizona and
New Mexico into the Union, as one I
state, against the will of the people j
of these territories, even though exer
cised under the forms of law, is as odi
ous and indefensible in principle as it
would be if the president used armed
force to weld Colorado and Kansas
Into one state. Force must be used in
both instances and the only difference j
lies In the kind of force which is em- j
ployed. ...
No harm can come to Oklahoma and ;
Indian Territory from the proposed
amendment They are united already
In the minds of their people, and the ,
ratification of the constitution will be ;
a pleasant formality. But Arizona and ,
New Mexico are strongly opposed to j
admission as one state, which is con- j
templated in the present omnibus bill, '
lrl nrefer to remain In .
their present dependent status as ter
ritories rather than to submit to an
ill-assorted union. They are entitled
to protection against such a ravishment.
A cold is always the result of undue expos
ure to low temperatures. The rapid cooling of
the surface, when not balanced by proper re-

action, produces ine congestion ana innaiiiiiia-

commonly called a cold. As the slightest cold
predisposes the individual to attacks of the most
severe and dangerous character, the necessity for
its quick cure need not be emphasized. Take

as 60on as the first indication of the cold appears
and all dangerous results will be avoided. It
not only cures a cold quickly but counteracts
any tendency of a cold to result in pneumonia.
This fact has been fully proven during the epi
demics of colds and grip of the past few years.
No case of either of these diseases having re
sulted in pneumonia when this remedy was used,
has ever been reported to the manufacturers or
come to their notice, which shows conclusively
that it is not only the best and quickest cure for
a cold, but a certain preventive of that danger
ous disease pneumonia.
There is no danger in giving this remedy to
children as it contains no opium or other harm
ful drug. It is pleasant to take.

Semi Annual Taxpaylag.
From time to time the matter of
making taxes in this territory payable
semi-annually has been agitated but
the agitation has never taken the form
of definite action. In most states taxes
are paid semi-annually, though in all
of them they were formerly paid an
nually. That was found by long ex
perience to be a wasteful process in
the accumulation of large sums in the
public treasuries from whose use no
benefit was derived by anybody.
Within the last two months mora
than $200,000 has been paid Into the
county treasury for taxes. No doubt
a great deal of that was raised with
difficulty and most of it inconveniently
The withdrawal of such a sum from
the community is necessarily telling on
it. leaving it in a more or less en
feebled condition. The county does not
need so much money all at once. Half
of It will not be disbursed within the
next six months. The other half would
serve the farmers and other property
owners, many of whom are paying
heavy rates of interest on their con
tributions, better than it will serve the
county. Even though It derive a slight
Income from the daily balances paid
by the banks with which under the new
law It may be deposited, for six
months that other half in the hands
of the taxpayers would be earning more
money.
It would be well for the business men
of the towns of Arizona, and for other
property owners to get together and
take up the matter of amending the
revenue law so that their hard-earned
tax money will not lie fallow for half
the year.
