SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1889.
The President’s Message.
President Harrison's first annual message
to Congress was transmitted to both houses
on Tuesday. As usual with such documents,
it opens with a resume ot our relations with i
foreign powers. All this is well known to ;
the country, but has to be officially commu
nicated to Congress.
The government finances are next treated.
The receipts and disbursements are given, and
a surplus of more than fifty seven millions
shown. This large surplus results, too. after
the expenditure of many millions for bonds
not yet due. The treasury was driven to this
expediency, one of questionable propriety, as
there was no other way to return the surplus
to the people and let it find its course back to
the channels of trade. The President says
that we should not collect revenue for the
purpose of anticipating our bonds, but there
is no other use to put any unappropriated
money. Had the recommendations of Pres
ident Cleveland, as embodied in the Mills
tariff bill, been carried out by Congress, there
would not have been very much surplus.
President Cleveland said “unnecessary taxa
lion is unjust taxation." President Harrison
says “the collection of moneys not needed for
public uses imposes an unnecessary burden
upon our people ” The former would have
relieved the people of unjust burdens by en
largement of the free list and a moderate re
duction in the tariff. President Harrison
approaches the subject with a timidity that
betokens no settled convictions. He counsels
against any change that will impair just and
reasonable protection to our home industries,
but recognizes that it is a matter of great
delicacy to prepare a tariff schedule because
of tbe wide divergence of opinion on the sub
ject. The President thus recognizes that it
will be difficult for his party in Congress to
unite upon u tariff measure, but he either has
no settled convictions on the subject himself,
or lacks the courage to plainly state them.
What a striking contrast is thus presented
between President Cleveland and his succes- i
sor. The one states the situation, points out
the dangers, and shows the way to avoid dis
aster. The other recognizes that tbe people
are unjustly taxed, doubts the propriety of
the present method of returning the surplus
to the people, and is aware of the detriment
to business interests by the withdrawal,
by unjust taxation, of large sums annually
from the channels of trade. But he has no
remedy to propose, or lacks the nerve to
stale it. An enlargement of the free list, and
the abolition of the lax upon tobacco and
spirits used in the arts and manufactures, is
all be has to recommend. The whole subject
to him is a theory, and he advances a theory.
He does not discuss details like President
Cleveland and point the way. but deals in
generalities.
When it was desired to “fry the fat" out of
the manufacturers and monopolists for cam
paign purposes last year, the Senate framed
a bill to mit the interests of those to be fried.
That bill represents the compact between those
who furnished tbe means to purchase a Re
publican victory and the Republican leaders.
If the Republican majority fulfills its part of
the contract, tbe Senate monstrosity will be
pet through at the present session of Con
gress. If not. those who were fried will not
submit to a second heating.
Since the election last year the people have
become more enlighted upon the subject of
taxation, and there ia strong demand for the
removal of unnecessary burdens. The high
wall of taxation, it it seen, is promolive of
trusts and apprentice monopolies. 1 rusts and
monopolies want high taxation continued.
Tbe people want alt unjust burdens removed,
and trusts and monopolies restrained. This
accounts for the recognized divergence 8f
views on tariff revision alluded to in the lues
sage. If Congress passes the Senate bill, a
large body of Republicans will revolt and join
the Cleveland hosts. If it not, those
who had the fist fried out last year will re
volt, and the Republican party will nut have
the means to purchase another victory on
Dudley's "blocks of five” plan.
The next subject of importance is the .race
issue, and the President assumes that tbe
negroes in the Sooth are deprived of free ex
ercise of the ballot. Upon the subject he has
only followed the lead of rampant Radicals,
and in recommending federal control of c-i:
gressional elections he is only endorsing
measures already proposed.
The country is tired of sectionalism. mid
none hot back-number politicians indulge in
sectional bostility. These soon will be voted
out of power, and tbe people North and
South, who arc now closely united by bus:
ness interests, don't propose to have progress
impeded to benefit partisanship at the expense
of unity, fraternal feeling and business health
and activity.
The bringing forward of sc useless and un
warranted a measure as federal control of
elections, and one whose legality could only
depend upon a strained constitutional con
struction, is bound to precipitate a contest in
which sectionalism will be brought up. It ts
doubtful if such a measure could Ire passed
by the Republican majority, and if it should
be accomplished public opinion would sweep
that majority from the halls of Congress.
The next subject of importance is federal
aid to public education, and the President
gives an endorsement to the principles ol the
Blair bill that has been discussed in Congress
for a dozen years, and which is unconslitn
tional. unnecessary, and a step to further
centralize power.
The other subjects of tbe message are of
minor importance, such ss coast defence, new
cruisers, merchant marine, inter state com
‘ merer laws, Ac.
The message lacks vigorous expression and
originality, and is commonplace. It is in
keeping with the capacity of its author, who
possesses little of the qualities of the states
man. Tbe rather, he is more of the politi
cian, tbe partisan, the spoilsman. It was not
expected that the message would be striking
in any particular, and it meets public expec
tation.
The Landlords' Protective Association of
Baltimore have invited a number of persons I
to address them on taxation, assessment,
ground rents, Ac. Some of these have made
valuable suggestions, and some have advanced
astounding propositions. Here is an extract
from the address of Col. Chas. J. Bonaparte,
on Tuesday night last:
“I will permit every owner of real properly
to assess each piece annually himself, but
oblige him to sell it at the price he fixed to
anyone willing to buy within a reasonable
time, with a right of pre-emption to the city.
This is the most absurd proposition yet
advanced. It ia well that the Maryland Leg
islature and Governor are not Bonapartes.
i —~
The Baltimore Sun appeared in an enlarged
form on Monday, being now nine columns to
the page. Ail in all there is no better news
paper published in the country. It is free
from sensationaiism, and its news is always
reliable. One of its main features is its Wash
ington correspondence, which is read brupsai
of all parties with a feeling that only fads are
given, not idle surmises and rumors. The I
Stilt, daily and weekly, reaches nearly every
household in Maryland and in parts ofDela
ware. Virginia and Pennsylvania, and when j
ever a Marylander locates in another State |
“he can't keep house" without his old favorite.
If tbe half that is said by tbe venders of |
nostrums of I heir wonderful curealls w ere
true, physicians and undertakers might close ,
up their shops.
Col. Hood’s Explanation.
The Advocate's article last week, in refer
ence to the change of mails, has brought forth
a reply from Col. Hood, President of the
Western Maryland Railroad, which will be
found in this issue. The mail facilities tor
| this section, we repeat, are inadequate, though
i there has been an improvement within the
i past few days. The fast mail, whose scheduled
j time to leave Westminster, going east, is 10.41,
j is so uncertain as to be practically valueless,
j both for mail and travel. No one here, and
I it is probable the same at other points, thinks
of going to the depot to take passage on it
without first inquiring the nrobab'e time it
will arrive. Last Friday it was late about
forty minutes; on Saturday about six hours;
on Tuesday about an hour behind. On
Friday the mail messenger was taken from
the 0.47 A. M. train and put on the 4.24 P.
M. train. With the uncertainty of the fust
mail, this left Westminster and every post
i office on the line of the road to Hagerstown,
j with no reliable morning mail communication
'to Baltimore and beyond. On Saturday, the
fast mail being late, the first mail to Haiti
more was by the 4.24 P. M. tram 100 late
for delivery at business establishments until
Monday. On Monday the Postoffice Depart
ment authorized the dispatching of a lock
pouch mail for Baltimore on tbe U. 47 train.
, the one that was formerly away mail. This
; improvement is acknowledged, but it does not
i meet the necessities of the community, as a
way mail, as formerly, is desired, and the
i evening mail is too soon for the banks at New
I Windsor and Westminster, and on 1- ridays too
soon for the palter at Union Bridge and the ,
papers at Westminster. As noted last week,
that in order to reach subscribers in the lower
part of Carroll on Saturdays, the papers must
:be sent to Baltimore on Friday nights. 1 o
get them ready lor the 4.24 (rain, they mnst
be sent from the publication offices before 4
o'clock, necessitating going to press quite
early :n the afternoon —100 early for a Satur
i day papier. For the banks and the press the
I old schedule of the fast mail was admirable.
If it was an hour or two late, or even three.
. it was unimportant, for it was only necessary
for mail to reach Baltimore by 12 midnight in
order to be carried on the early mail on the
Baltimore A Ohio road to lower Carroll or
: for the morning delivery in Baltimore.
Col. Hood's explanation of why the 4.24
train docs not go down about 5 o'clock or
later, sustains what the Advocate said last
week —that “The Western Maryland railroad
does not seem to care much for the conve
nience of the towns along its line.'' By this,
we meant its main line, and particularly the
important points in Carroll. The explana
I tion is. that trains from Williamsport and
; Shippensburg meet at Kdgemont. The travel
| runs combined to Highfield, there to separate.
one train going to Baltimore via Hanover and
j the other via Westminster. There could
be no reason for this, except to accommodate
a few passengers, and very few most probably,
from the Shippensburg line and points on tbe
main stem west of Edgemont. who would
want logo to local points on the Tape Worm
road. Those going to Baltimore would un
doubtedlv prefer to go down on the main line
and the shorter route. To accomnuwlate
these few. every bank and newspaper, and
manv people who do not like to leave their
business so soon in the afternoon to go to
Baltimore, must be inconvenienced.
In regard to the fast mail being ran east to
make connection w ith the Cumberland I alley
Road, and to accommodate Winchester and
Martinsbarg. we accept Col. Hood * Mete
ment that the connection followed the change
and was not tbe cause of it. When the sched
~ ule of the fast mail train was changed the Bal
timore papers laid great stress upon tbe
| opening of this new line to Martinsbarg and
. Winchester, and spoke of it as beneficial u>
the interests of the Monumental City. From
these press notices it p|>eared that the ex
tension of the Cumberland Valley road was
the cause of tbe change in the schedule of the
. fast mail.
Col. Hood's remark-- about the fast
mail being put on to accommodate p. -ipb
east of Hagerstown, do not change our views
in the least. The fast mail scheme originated
: in a desire of the Baltimore papers to reach -
Hagerstown and polu.s beyond M M not to b ■
preceded by Northern dailies. That was the
object—the supplying of local points between
Baltimore and Hagerstown was the incident.
But for the fact that it was desirable to have
an early mail from Baltimore to Hagerstown
and beyond, the first mail from Baltimore
would probably now be coming along at the
former hour, about 3.40, Tbe early service
j is duly appreciated, and during lhe_ washout
last June, when we were deprived of the fast
mail, its loss was keenly felt. Butlheaccom
modnlion we gel from the early mail is the
incident—not the object.
On this point Col. Hood says the unfavor
able comment “has not worried us. as we
; have not been accustomed to receive evidence?
of appreciation for anything done for your
pomt-
As far as the Advocate is concerned. Col.
Hood and tbe Western Maryland Railroad
have never received anything but kind words.
Every publication that could benefit the road
has been given, and it has endeavored to aid
it in every possible way. When the Western
Maryland wanted to lease the canal, ibe An
vocatk supported it, and the Carroll repre
sentatives in the l-egis'ature were favorable
to his scheme.
There has been much individual complaint
here as to freight charges and insufficient pas
senger accommodations, but the Advov ate
has not voiced it. As remarked last week
the people here have silently pul up with in
conveniences because the road was in debt,
but silence seoms to be taken for contentment.
Col. Hood seems to be quite sensitive over
any allusions to these subjects, and in spite of
his intention to be amiable, a little feeling
crops out.
As to receiving evidences of appreciation
for “anything done for your point,” wc would
like to ask Col. Hood what his road has ever {
done specially for Westminster, except of a
i temporary character, such as on occasion; of
large gatherings here? Has there ever been
a train put on to accommodate this place?
So far as we can now recall, all the benefits in i
the way of travel have been incidental. The
Blue Mountain express was put on the road
1 to accommodate guests at the Blue Mountain
House. That teas the object. It was sched- i
uled to stop at Westminster as a matter of
business. And so with the fast mail.
As to our depot criticism, we were aware |
| of the purchase of a site for a new depot, and j
that, not being undertaken before the disas- '
j trous washouts, the building had to be de- I
I ferred. And we were also aware that during !
the past few years insignificant stations have j
; been supplied with handsome depots, while j
Westminster, New Windsor and other points
;in Carroll have been neglected. We were
aware, too, that the Company has been talk
ing of a new depot here for some years, and
! that it had possession of the site for one here
two months—the time when building opera
! lions are usually begun —before the disastrous
■ washouts. ,
Col. Hood makes the remarkable assertion
that it is not so much Westminster that
makes this point a good station, as the country
tributary. He certainly could not have
meant to say this, as nine tenths of the freight
! and travel is drawn from the town population,
j As to the new line to Baltimore that may
j possibly be built, and leave Westminster with
a diminished train service, before that day
arrives Westminster will have the bsttis
j burg and Washington road, with a branch to
[ Baltimore, or will have a branch to the Bal
timore A Ohio, which has been already con
' sidered.
In regard to the proposed Gettysburg and
, Washington road, Col. Hood does not think
j that the enterprise would be a paying one,
i and remarks that railroads of today are rarely
ever built or materially aided by local sub
scription, but by capitalists, who find it
profitable to go into such enterprises. Our
observation is just the reverse of this. 1 lie
Valley Branch of the Baltimore A Ohio was
built mainly by local subscriptions and Balti
more city. The Shenandoah \ alley road
was very materially aided by local subscrip
tions. The Drum Point road is now being
built by local subscriptions. The Baltimore
and Eastern Shore Railroad is being built
bv local subscriptions, and the survey o(
the proposed Gettysburg and Washington
road, via Westminster, is being made by
Westminster subscriptions.
As to the amount Westminster would save
on coal and lumber by the building of the
Gettysburg and Washington road, the Auto
cate is unprepared to say. It is believed
that freight charges would be less by the new
mad, and it is certain that coal can be bought
for less at Harrisburg than in Baltimore, by
as mueli as sixty cents a ton. It is also cer
tain that one-third of the coal and lumber
trade Westminster is entitled to goes to
Taneytown and Littleslown, because prices ;
are cheaper, wagoning included. 1 rade
1 in these commodities goes from this town to
j those points. With the proposed road, this
trade would be saved to Westminster, and a
i considerable trade from the upper and lower
parts of Carroll would be brought here that
i we do not now enjoy, and there would also
be a considerable amount of local travel.
Our milk and market men could also open a
paying business in Washington, and the roa.l
would have considerable local travel to and
from the county town, and through travel '
• between the capital of the countiy and historic
Gettysburg.
Westminster is not unreasonable. It can
wail a year or two for a new depot, and it
ean. jpil of consideration for the financial
difficulties of the Maryland railroad,
do without first class tram service. But the i
people do want a passenger train to Haiti- |
more in the morning about o'clock; a faster ;
train up in the evening; away mail at 3.4. A.
M. and the 4.24 P. M. train changed to about i
SP. M, It'such a service had been supplied |
and freight charges been a little more modi r j
ate. the people of this city and vicinity would
not have interested themselves about t.,hcr ’
lines. Experience shows that competition ;
works great changes, and our people have 1
concluded that only competition will secure i
for Westminster such mail and travel taciii- j
lies as are required. Westminster's impor- ■
lance as a source of freight and jiassengi-r |
traffic may be “unduly magnified,” but then j
' it may not.
Annual Report of the School Board.
The annual report of the School Commis- j
sioners seems to have made clear, to ail who ,
were disposed to criticise.tbe fact that economy '
and sound financial ability have been excr- |
vised in administering school affairs. Adverse
criticisms generally proceeded troro lack of
information. The Board cannot report but j
once a year, bal those desiring information 1
can at all times readily gam it by inquiry at !
the office of the Commissioners. In cnticis
mg official management, no one should take :
hearsay evidence, or go upon surmises, or be i
guided by personal feeling. Particularly <•
in the case of the management of public
schools. The school system .* very near to
the people, and criticism of its management
at once arouses public attention.
The report covers tbe work of the Board
for the past six years—ever since the present
Commissioners and Examiner have been in :
office, and in ail respects is a satisfactory |
showing.
The present Board were hamt>ered with a :
debt at the beginning of thetr management. ■
It was the accumulation of previous years.
The interest on this debt about equals the in- ;
i crease of Ibe obligations during the pat • x
years. Had there been no debt when tftey
went into office, there would Uaee been none
now. although a considerable number of new
school hqsite* base been erected in various
parts Ol' the county, others repaired, and much
old furniture replaced by new.
Freed of debt, and with an additional tloo
a year, new school booses could be pul up |
where required, the school property kept in j
repair, and the school system extended and
improved as necessity arises.
Meeting of Congress
The Fifty First Congress met on Monday
last. In the Senate the proceeding? were
tame. but on the House side much interest
was mamtested, on account of a changr of j
political power, and the galleries and corn
dors acre tfaroii/*-d. Mr. Reed, of Maine, as
tbe Ann*- ATE predicted. WAS chosen Speaker,
and the next best place, that of Doorkeeper,
was secured by Okas S. Adams, of Hag-re
town, through the activity and mffaence of
Mr. McUomas. All the Republican caucus
nominees were chosen, except for Chaplain.
When the House came to elect a Chaplain,
several Republicans bolted tbe caucus muni
nee and supported Rev. Mr. Milburn, the
I democrat, who sas Chaplain of the last
House. The boiling Republicans and Deni
ocrals elected Mr. Miibam. much to the dis
gust of the Republican nominee.
On Tuesday but little was done in either
house except the reception and reading ol the
Prnaident’s message.
A great many bills have been intro
doced in tbe Senate and House. In the
Senate there was a number of bills aimed at
trusts and monopolies, and Senator Sherman
; presented his bill for federal control of con
gressional elections.
But little can be done until after the holiday
recess. Speeker Reed will require some lime
to arrange tbe House committee*, and they
will not probably bv announced until after
: tbe recess, which will likely begin on the 21st.
Mr. Httrrtson, Attontiou.
Tbe Carrolltonian remarks that Carroll
i "from its creation to the present Inn has
| never been honored with a general appoint
j ment by any President," and then proceeds
j to remark to tbe Harrison Administration,
i that if it is alleged that there are no Repubii
i cans in this portion of the stale who are qual
| ified, no one whose services to the |>arty are
I not entitled to consideration. Republicans,
while bolding the contrary opinion, /any sub
mit to being again ignored and possibly trill
' patiently wait and go on supporting the
I party.” The italics are those of the Carroll
j lonian contributor. The article in substance,
I says that if some Republican of Carroll dou t
| get a general appointment from the Harrison
, Administration, it is doubtful whether the
I Republicans of Carroll will continue to sup
: port the party. If President Harrison's eye
| ever sees this, he will doubtless make haste
) to do something for the long suffering and
patient aspirant the contributor had in view.
He is probably not aware that the Republi
cans of Carroll have been polling tor twenty
years from two to three hundred votes less
than enough to win, and at the last election
were only four hundred short of winning.
Such a record is unsurpassed, and needs
recognition. Let Carroll have a general ap
pointment.
A learned scientist assures the rest ot
mankind that the present rainy season is ow
ing to the spots on the sun being reduced to
the minimum number, and that humidity of
the atmosphere always prevails when such is
the case. We trust that the number of those
spots will soon be increased, so that we may
enjoy a little dry weather again.
If the CarroUtonian will confine itself to j
the work of making its own columns a little |
more readable and interesting to the public,
it may, in time, perhaps, swell its circulation j
to half that of the Advocate, and may defer
its own mortuary record, for a time.

Office of President and General Manager. >
Baltimore, December 2,1889. I
Messrs. Editors "Democratic Advocate,” Westminster.
Maryland.
Gentlemen: —1 have just noted the article in your
last issue under the beading “Change of Mail
Schedule,” and believing that it would not have
been written, had there been a better understanding
of the causes which led to the change of schedule
referred to. 1 have thought it advisable to ask you
i to give room to the following explanation ; The
change referred to is. I assure you, one of the most
objectionable ever forced upon this company. In
going West, the Fast Mail is required to leave this
city at the earliest hour at which complete editions
of the daily papers can be issued.
This has been fixed at 4.10 a. m. Coming Hast, it
is compelled to leave Hagerstown immediately upon
arrival of the Postal Car from the South. During
the summer, this has been arriving nl 4.l** P- m. and ,
the Fast Mail has been leaving for Baltimore at i
4.2*. Recently, we received notice that on the fol- j
lowing Monday. 25th ult. the >. N. train, with ;
Postal Car. would arrive at >.') a. m.. w hich com- j
pel led a change iu our departure from Hagerstown ;
from 4.25 p. m. to 9a. m. It was not until after we j
had informed the Cumberland Valley It. R., which I
] is used by our Fast Mail trains for reaching the S. 1
. V. Station at Hagerstown that we would bee m
: pelted to change our time upon its tracks, that wo
! w ere notified by it of the running of its trains be
tween Hagerst din and Murtinsborgai d V\ me:.ester
j so as to afibrd us connections t * and from thus-.*
j points upon the new schedule. Thu>. it will be
seen that the Winchester connections were some- :
I thing that followed the change, instead of being the j
cause of iL It would seem to be unnecessary to g..
further to satisfy you that it was not • t this compa
ny’s motion that the Fast Mail Fast, in P. M.. which
filled a want both in local mails and passenger lu.*i- .
ness, was changed t * follow chicly another through
train.
While the Posotflice Department does not prob j
ably care for any defence from u*. it would not
seem amis'* to >ay that it is no more responsible tor
the change complained of Gau this company.
It was entirely due to the winter schedule- A-lojti

• which ha* b be made up by it* guarantor, the city
I of Baltimore, it strikes me there will be some diffl
( I cully in prwaenUng this matter in a sufficiently at
j tractive hght to this claw* of investor*.
That a rad from Gettysburg b> Washington, crows-
I firing the country, would f>*el uxotv. and yet not be
t able to command one-thirl as large a business as the
| Western Maryland, would seem to go without
\ saying.
j Some year* since. I was told by a superintendent
| of the IVnna. Railroad, that hi- company never ran
j a passenger train that did not average 30 ceuU< per
: mile. The We-tern Maryland U now running a
j number by Westminster that do not make this
; average.
j Should the G. AII a * build a Dalttmorv Hue.
j and should work upon the V. R. H. minimum rule,
i which repreaeuta actual coat of train service, it is
j not clear to me how a much biller service w ith In
| creased mail facilities can be maintained by the two
j lines than is now combined upon the one.
• Sometime since, it was announced that the build*
! mg of such a road would cheapen the freight* on
I lumber and coal t • Westminster from f.U'UJ to
! year. I believe one of out Directors In
j iormed you at the lime that this could not be. as the
i entire amount received by this company for traits*
! porting such commodities was only tS.'M.'.is lor
I IBS. While for the fiscal year ending September 50.
j lb®9, it was still less.
Your statement that the W. M. K K. Go. does not
1 care for the convenience of the tow ns upon its Hue
Is incorrect, and if you had said that its course so
j indicated, that likewise would be incorrect. To af-
I ford Carroll county points a thoroughly satisfactory
i train service at all seasons is a difficult problem.
In summer, the additional A. M. Accomodation |
train, and the Blue Moomain Express, should I
| pretty well fill the requirements, but In the w inter. |
j there is not sufficient business to justify running the
! two Accommodation train.", ami to give the one !
j time for the milk and market work, makes the
! schedule very slow. .....
1 This arrangement, however, suits your milk ship- j
1 pers better at this season than to run an additional
' train at an curlier hour for the milk business, us it I
is only by so doing that the lime of the second can
I be quickened. All things considered, ami every- j
! thing has been carefully considered, the present ar- -
! rangemeiit is the best that can be done with the |
present light business,
j I must apologize lor such a lengthy trespass, ill
would have been shorter, had you ilea It more j
I briefly and justly.
I if you will only afford us an opportunity to give
our reasons for our course before going into a j
I wholesale denunciation, when our policy does not ,
' accord with vour views, we will either satisly you I
! that we are right, or bow sumissively while you j

FACTS! PACTS!
PACTS!
Which every housekeeper in Carroll county
should know something ahont.
Do you want to save money?
Do yon want to buy Holiday Goods cheap?
Don you want to buy all your Groceries cheap?
Facts are stubborn things to prove, but we
will prove the fact that we are the very
cheapest of Grocers by giving you our prices
and telling you a little about the quality of
our goods.
HO! FOR CHRISTMAS !
Raisins Tic a pound; you could not buy a
hundred boxes of this kind today for less than
7Jc; Seedless Raisins 10c a pound; Currants
6c a pound: Citron, that is Citron, 22c a
pound; Bunch Raising, Muscalelle Raisins,
Valencia Layer Raisins, Raisins of all kinds.
NUTS. NUTS. NUTS.
Hazel 10c. English Walnuts 14c. Butternuts
lie, Pecans 10c, Almonds 17c, Mixed Nuts
!3c a pound. nr
V
Figs 10c a pound. Candy from 11c a pound
upward, Oranges 20c a dozen. Lemons 15c a
dozen and upward.
Baking Molasses 40c, 48c and 65c per gal
lon: you cannot replace our (55c Molasses at
80c.
Now remember, these are low prices, but
the goods are of the very best quality that are
imported.
Now a Word About Groceries:
Best Oc Sugar sold in Baltimore. All
Sugars sold at cost. Best Syrup 35c a gallon,
best Coal Oil 8c a gallon, best Cider Vinegar
15c a gallon, fine Salt 10c a peck, Apple
Batter and Jellies 5c a pound, best rice 6c a
pound. Starch 34c a pound, Corn Starch 7c
a pound. Washing Soda IJc a pound. Pepper
20c a pound, best Lard 74c a pound. Oat Meal

:’.o a pound. Corn Meal 14c a pound, New
Hominy 34c a quart, Sew Beans 74c a quart,
best Turkish Prunes 44c a pound.
But the most wonderful reduction has been
:in Tea. YVe cannot understand why there
should be such a big profit on Tea. Usually
if a merchant pays 80s for Tea he sells it for
'•Oc or 70c a pound. This is not right; it is
too much. We sell such a Tea as this for 85c
or 40c a pound. Our Teas range in price
as follows: 15c. 25c, 30c, 40c, 50c, and the
very finest of Tea at 60c a pound.
Now, friends, come to see us; it is to yonr
advantage. We have the two old time houses
on the corner of Gay and Ensor streets, right
across the street from the engine house with
the high tower, and we will be pleased to wait
on you at any time.
