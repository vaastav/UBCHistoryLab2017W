CUSTOMS FALL BELOW GUESSES.

Washington, Dec. 3. ltlmates of rev
enue for the- fiscal year ending June 30
next In Secietary of the Tie.nury Mc
Adoo's annual report give the latest in
foi mation as to what thc Wilson Admin
istration expects from the new tariff law.
The Secretary estimates that for the
twelve months ending with next June the
customs revenues will amount to JS70,
000,000, or $.4,400,000 les-s than under
the Payne-Aldrlch law In the preceding
fiscal year.
Mr. McAeloo figures, however, that the
Government will rcctlve from Internal
revenue 1407,000,000, or $62,500,000 more
than in the previous twelve mouths.
This maefked Increase In Internal reve-
nun reeetntn u-111 rnstllt from file new to.
eome .ax. Seeretarv McAd,o Mtl,nH.e.
that this tax will yield 154.000,000 from
.. . 1 m
Individuals and 33,000,000 from corpora-
tlons In the present fiscal year, but this
will be reduced by nn $5,000,000 compen
satory reduction In thc corporation excise
tax, which has been superseded by the
Income tax.
Thc Secretary believes .that the revenue
from tho new tariff law will be amplo to
meet the Government's expenditure, with
a big margin of sutplus.
Thc customs receipts for November fell
off about $4,500,000 from the correspond
ing month of last year. A similar reduc
tion in other months would mean a loss of
about $50,000,000 a year.
