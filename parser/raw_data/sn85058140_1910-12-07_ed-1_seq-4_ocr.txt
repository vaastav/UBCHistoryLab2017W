PRESIDENT TAFTS MESSAGE yo I i
P 1tESI1RN 1AVrS meeMftge read in both houses of ConI
gresa yesterday is of such considerAble length as to dis
tmrage1 the IUttIA1 reader but it is to be hoped that un win
CSH with close ht rest the resume of the message as it ap
JPT1oi on the tint f pMg of this issue tile President has dealt
with pnctieaDy ever subject of national welfare at the pres
nt tim and IU1 CXlmu5tivo rending of the mcssnge will give
one a tllo e ill8ight into the condition of the country from A
govrrnnwntal stnndpoint
Mr Tait undoubtedly but mirror the desire of the nation
at IsrJf when ho says thAt he win not recommend any tariff
1fgisJIt ion until the new Congrees convenes in December 1911
W1iie WP NI havo something in common with the reasons ad
vanced hy Mr raft for the attitude he assumes yet in the
pinion or many the best argument against it io i the fact that
it would once mora uusotta business conditions which are
rapidly aming bank to normal The Presidents reason is the
fart that the tAriff board is not ready to submit a report on
any of tho heduJoo of the Payne bill He desires to wait
until the tariff board gives some intelligent basis for action
iThen it cloGS so the President desires that the tariff be re
vied t + Ohedule by schedule and announces hiS vigorous oppo
1rition to Any general revision He desires the tariff board to
+ be made permanent which will appear to most of us as n most
43en ble 81ggcstion
While the tariff clause of his m08sage is the most inter =
iteBtmg to the people generally the President will meet popu
Jar approval in the stand he takes concerning antitrust legis
lation Kr Tart A8SUU1K tho position that it is time to stop
legilating with reference to regulation of corporations md to
lcuspend that Sort of thing 1mill the effect has been noted of
a vigorous execution of the laws already on the statute books
The President believes that the exact limitation upon business
T1P1ho will be mAdo clearer by pending decisions of the 8U
prP1l1e court
From the foregoing and from further comment upon it
hy the President it is apparent that he is weary of the hue
anti I err against oorporAtions just because they are corpora
tion is j tired of the continual mnckrnking that i going on and
that 110 radical trustbusters are going to get encouragement
It the White House Mr Taft wanta the Jaw enforced he
want the people pro1cMed from the exactions of the trust but
he c1cw not hold that every corporation is guilt of NH11 crime
11 t 11f faleooAr And he believes it is time we becnme slightly
IIWIf oIRre and SilO on the trust question
Thp mMM undoubtedly will have n splendid effect on
hll insMS rbere is nothing in it to alarm capital in fact the
I N i plRinly held out to capital that there is i going to be no
I1fTal program l of nnming amuok The President says that
1pliVN + the Activities of the government in addition to the
t 11toreemOltt of the lAWS Should be directed towArd economy of
dlllinitration the enlargement of opportunities for foreign
1 rJch l the building up of home industry and the 5trngtbcning i
Uri r the t eon dense of capitAl in domestic investment
The Preeident strikes R conservative Irate That be is go
itig tn do ilothiflg radiCl iIJ plainly apparent His Jnessnge
RiIi help mUM to relfltore confidence and itought to he nt once
retltted in It quickening or tile commercial pulse all or the
IIIt ion
iont win be IL sad bloW to victor Murdock the par excellence
i1l5ugent that ho is not to nave the opportunity to put wool 011
the fre list The attitude of the President in opposition to
any tariff legislatafm at this session puts it outside the realm
of probability thAt the wool schedule or any other schedule of
t Pavno bill win bo considered Coming from the President
the titular head of the Republican party it is apparent thflt
it is in line with the views of the party leaders So Mr Mur
dotk tan bide his time with as much patience as he CAn muster
nn il i l the next CongreM meets which will be in December 1911
It rill be good news tb 1tn11 also that the wool schedule I
is to romaiu as it is Here in Utah as sellers of woolit is i to
our advantage thAt wool shall sell at n price that will afford
the wool grower It profit Mr Murdock is of conrs arguing
from a self1s1t standpoint Ilia constituents buy the finished
product If they ware large sellers of wool 11e would favor

Mr naxeJ hownec sharer the

There ought to be some way of set

there will he no need far hOUGn on the

be expected that the statutos or Utah
which forbid combination to control

The satisfactory teaturf ot aU this
