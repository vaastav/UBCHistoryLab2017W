The McNamaras thought so much of "the cause," they were willing to
take the lives of others for "freedom's" sake; but when it came to having i
their own necks stretched, their craven hearts did quail.

Oa December 11-14, there will be held in Washington, D. C., a National
Conference on the Evils of the Interstate Liquor Traffic, at which time res
olutions will be passed and Congress will lie memorialized to forbid the
issuing of Federal liquor license in dry territory. That would do more to
break up boot-legging, than any one thing that could be done,

STANDPATTERS:—George Fitch, who writes Vest Pocket Essays"
for several newspapers, says "a standpatter is a stationary statesman who
is satisfied with majorities as they are, and standpatters are confined en
tirely to successful candidates. Lot's wife was a standpatter, and has j
stood for centuries looking backward. The standpatter believes there is a
future, but does not believe in trying to haul it into the present day by the
neck. Political standpatters are satisfied with last year's laws and social
standpatters are satisfied with last year's shirts. There has also arisen
a new brand of standpatters who are regarded with great contempt in some
quarters because they are satisfied with last year's wife."
President Taft in his recent message to Congress said: "It is not the
purpose of the statute (the Sherman law) to confiscate the property
capital of the offending trusts." Nay, verily' Perish the thought! Nor
