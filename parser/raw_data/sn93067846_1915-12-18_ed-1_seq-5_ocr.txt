armament is a burden," said Mr.
Scott.

dressing the Southern Commercial

[they call it, yet 1 want to see this
counftry adequately prepared," said
Mr. Straus in expounding the objects
and aims of the league for the en?
forcement of peace. "I, for one," he
said, "wish to express my apprecia?

tendance on the meetings this after?

ingness, the men of the ships took
extra pains to impress upon the dele?

country.
The bluejackets of the fleet are
having a great time during their visit
to the city. Besides the various forms
of public entertainment that are be?
ing provided for the bluejackets, the
latter are providing entertainment
for the people of the city with their
football and basketball games. The
mere presence of the men from the
ships on the streets of the city is a
source of much Interest. The behavior
of the men is matter of favorable
comment in the city.

upon Charleston and Is giving admir?
able weather for the Southern Com?
mercial congress and the fleet.
The men of the ships are making
preparations for the big military pa?
rade on the morrow. The sailors are
determined not to be outdone by their
land brethren, artillerymen and ma?
rines.

being royally entertained during their
stay In the harbor. Many of them
were entertained at a luncheon at
the rooms of the Charleston club yes?
terday morning which was given by
the chairman of the naval committee,
E. W. Hughes. Several of them were
present at the dinner that was given
by Gov. Manning last night. Many

EXHIBITS OF SCHOOLS.
Charleston, Dec. 14.?The Charles?
ton educational exhibit uncfer the aus?
pices of the local Woman's auxiliary
to the Southern Commercial congress,
which is being held in the Charlcs
i
ton museum, Is a revelation, as an j
index to the work that is being done,
and has been done in the educational
institutions of this city. All the pub?
lic schools are represented along with
the colleges. Exhibits are there from
the elementary schools, Bennett,
Craft, Courtenay and Mitchell, white
schools, and Simonton and Shaw, the
negro schools; Charleston high
school, Memminger, Citadel, College

emy, Medical college, the kindergar?
tens of the city and the negro in?
dustrial school. The Natural History

hibit of the Charleston museum are

mosf creditable exhibition of what Is
being done in the schools of the city.
Yesterday afternoon, the exhibit was
visited by many pupils of the schools
and by others attracted there. It Is
open to the public every day this
week.
The exhibit was promoted by the
local Woman's auxiliary to the South?
ern Commercial congress through Its
chairman, Mrs. 11. G. Lelding. Miss
U M. Bragg was appointed the chair?
man of the committee in charge of
the educational exhibit and the suc?
cess of the committee can be judged
by the standard of the displays that
they have secured. Prof. Paul Rea,
the curator of the museum, provided
space for the exhibit in the museum.
I The northeastern section of the main
auditorium is devoted to the booths
that have been arranged by the vari?
ous schools.

lull of happenings that the import
lance of this single feature is dimmed.
