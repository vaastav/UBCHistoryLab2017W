PRESS COMMENTS
Various Views of the Presidett's
Message.
VERY GENERIL APPROVAL
The Report's Conservative Tone
Commended.
DEMOCRATIC ACQUIESCENCE
From the New York Herald.
Insomuch as relates to his messages at
least. President McKinley is an energetic
expansionist. It is exhaustive-almost ex
hausting-in its minuteness, and while the
evidence of painstaking, it would be more
thoroughly read by a busy people if much
that is irrelevant, together with statistics
and matter that has already been laid be
fore the public, were omitted.
From the Baltimore American.
The President's message is unusually
long, but this is due to the unusual number
of important matters which he is com
pelled by the Constitution to discuss. It is
well expressed, clear and admirable in
tone. Those who do not agree with his
views will scarcely question their sincerity.
or the patriotism which inspired them.
From the Philadelphia Times.
A glance at the President's message
to Cong.*ess is sufficient to recall the ex
traordinary change in the public interests
of this country within the last few years.
Time was, not very long ago, when the an
nual message. after some opening para
graphs that usually might be summed up
in the familiar phrase of a royal speech.
"Our relations with foreign governments
continue friendly," went on to consider the
various details of domestic administration
as reported by the heads of departments.
The unusually long message which the
President sent to Congress yesterday ex
pends no space at .all upon this domestic
routine, and after its comprehensive and
important reference to the financial and
commercial interests of the country is de
voted almost exclusively to matters out
side the United States. And yet the an
nual message has not often contained so
little that is insignificant.
From the New York Jcurnal.
Itn the forty thousand words, more or
less, which the President unloaded yester
day upon a helpless Congress, there is not
one clear-cut, inspiring thought. The mes
sage hat some good points and some bad,
like any average report of a bureau clerk.
It would have been immensely improved
by the intervention of a blue pencil, ruth
lessly cutting down Its twenty-one sprawl
ing columns to three. The Constitution
says that the President "shall from time to
time give to the Congress information of
the state of the Union." Now that his
message is out of the way it is about time
for Mr. McKinley to be thinking about
carrying out this constitutional require
ment.
From the New York World.
For a year Congress has practically ab
dicated its authority over great questions
coi: mitted to it by the Constitution. Upon
reassembling it finds the policy of the gov
ernment in regard to military expansion
and European colonialism irrevocably lixed
by the executive. The President's message
is simply a notification to this effect.
From the New York Sun.
The message of the PrcE:ident is a lucid
and temperate narrative of facts, in strict
accordance with the requirements of the
Constitution that he "give to the Congress
information of the state of the Union," and
its recommendations are likewise simple
and direct, in form suggestive rather than
argumentative.
From the New York Journal of Commerce.
The public turns to the message of the
President to learn his views and his recom
mendations to Congress regarding three
topics cf primary Importance-the currency,
our commercial rights in the far east and
our relations with our new dependencies.
On each of these topics he says less than
might have been expected; he indicates in
only the most general way what action
Congress should'take. But on each of these
topics he says enough to show that he is
In entire acz)rd with the best judgment of
the country, and his recommendations to
Congress will commend themselves to in
telligent and thinking men uf all parties.
From the Brooklyn Eagle.
The message, as a whole, is a wonder of
industry, a prof of patient thought and
study, a body of practical and righteous
suggestions and a document of sanity, liber
ality, sagacity and patriotism. There is
not a partisan line In it. There is not a
note of anger or rashness in It. It is the
work of a man who appears to feel the
legal and moral rcsponsibility of a great
office, in a great time, held in trust for a
great people, a people whose interests are
not only those of the present but such as
reach far into the future. We think the
country will like the message in all Its de
tails and, best of all, will like the broad
ness of its tone throughout, from beginning
unto end.
From the Blitimore Herald.
It is neither diffuse nor superabundant
in its treatment of national subjects. De
spite its length, it is safe to assume that
it wil! be read from beginning to end by
the mass of intelligent American citizens,
because the occasion of its deliverance is
one of supreme importance to the welfare
of the republic.
The message is replete with patriotic
thought, and on those themes related to
the progress of the republic along the lines
of national greatness it is a ringing expres
sion of true and genuine Americanism,
such as will evoke the applause of all good
citizens irrespective of political divisions.
Upon the whole, the message may be con
sidered as a masterfully written state pa
per, and as demonstrating, in a striking
way, the comprehensive grasp that Presi
dent McKinley has upon the grave prob
lems of government with which he, as the
nation's chief executive, is confronted.
From the New York Mall and Express.
The annual message which President Mc
Kinley sent to Congress today, like all his
state papers. is a model of lucidity and
frankness. He is not of those who believe
that language was made to conceal rather
than reveal thought. He treats all topics
which maire up the message with perfect
candor worthy of the chief magistrate of
an inteliigent peopie. It Is a document
which stamps Its author as a broad-minded,
accomplished, conscientious statesman.
From the P'hiladelphia Telegraph.
It is one of the most important messages
ever received by Congress, covering as it
does a vast range of national interests ex
tending from Porto Rico, in the Atlantic.
to the Philippines. on the other side of the
Pacific ocean, and is necessarily volumi
nous, as the official information conveyed
on many subjects to be brought for the first
time before the attention of Congress is
given as required with considerable elabo
ration of detail. It is broadly national in
character and contaIns no hint of partisan
allusion, unless it be in the sharp reference
with which the President legitimately
enough cut down to the ground the demo
cratic pretense of party monopoly of the
anti-trust issue by showing that republican
Presidents and republican legislators have
been practically anti-trust advocates, while
the democratic administration of Mr. Cleve
land distinctly regulated the trusts to the
purview of the state legislatures,
From the New York Time,.
We hope President McKinley's clkar and
candid review of the causes that led to
the conflict with the insurgents and his
statement of the faithful ciforts made to
prevent it wilt not be entirely overlooked
in anti-imperialist circles in Boston and
Chicago, it should convince any fair
minded .American that the President is
not the swaggering tyrant that his ene
miles have represented him to be. Indeed,
for all that class of Americans who de
serve to be described as fail-minded and
who are free from the trammels of party,
the message goes far to destroy the issue
of imperialism which Bryan, Aguinaldo and

From the Baltinore News.
A very considerable portion of the mes
sage is devoted to the Philippines question
In its various aspects. What the President
says upon it Is evidently the result of care
ful.thought, and will receive the attentive
consideration of the copnry.
From the New York Triba
It certainly exceeds any in the scope
and variety of topics considered. Nor are
these devoid of Interest and importance.
There are no surprises nor sensations; but
there are many gratifying reports, and
more than one suggestion which will be
heartily commended to the sqund judgment
of the nation. According to theominous
vaticinations of some, the message should
be filled With war' and rumors of wars,
and with all manner of embarrassing eii
tanglements; since such were to be the
immediate and inevitable results of ex
pansion. But, on the contrary, the key
iotes of it are peace and freedom from en
tanglements, together with a marked
growth In Infiuence 'and prestige.
From the Philadelphia 'Press.
This broad policy in the regions for
which the United States Is responsible will
command the respect and confidence of
sane, clear-headed. Just men. Sober Amer
;cans, anxicus not to satisfy their theories,
tut to see their country do its duty before
the world with disinterested justice, will
approve every line of this sound, conserva
tive, well-considered policy. It is a busI
ness policy. It is a righteous policy. It
considers first and foremost the good of
the governed. It asks no profit for the
United States. It seeks no revenue from
dependencies. It proposes in words which
stir the blood that as "our flag has never
waved over any con1 nuntty but in bless
ing," it shall not lose "its gift of benedic
tion in Its world-wide journey to new
shores."
LONDON ON THE MESSAGE.
Papers Note Coolness Toward Britain
and Blame Chamberlain.
LONDON, December .-All the morning
papers have editorials on President Mc
Kinley's message. Here are extracts:
From the Daily Telegraph.
What differentiates the present from pre
ceding messages is its all but formal ad
mission that the United States have been
drawn into the outer eddies of eastern
politics. It is the far east which is the
real reason for this partial abandonment of
Monroelsm. So far as Great Britain is con
cerned, there is no apprehension, but
rather, unqualified satisfaction at the new
departure.
From the Daily Mail.
Commercial expansion is the dominant
note. The utmost cordiality Is expressed
toward Germany. and the President's tone
toward England is distinctly friendly.
Shipping subsidies are plainly hinted at. If
Congress carries these into effect British
ship owners will have to break through all
rings and enter upon a new epoch of en
terprise.
From the Daily News.
Mr. Chamberlain will find but cold com
fort if he reads between the lines of the
message. While it urges a good under
standing with all countries, it is not effu
sive toward our own. If it sins anywhere
In that way it is for the benefit of Ger
many, and Americans will do all in their
power to make the two countries the best
of friends.
From the Standard.
He is friendly to us. but does not mean to
be fervid. Toward Germany, on the other
hand, he is very cordial. The reference to
"entangling alliances" would probably have
been omitted if a certait speech at Leices
ter had not been delivered.
From the Daily Chronicle.
Toward Germany Mr. McKinley's friendly
expressions have quite a noteworthy em
phasis, and if his tone is a- shade cooler
with reference to this country we owe it to
the unlucky exaggerations of Mr. Cham
berlain.
From the Morning Post.
His language regarding Great Britain is
cordial but cautious. His statements In re
lation to the new possessions Of the United
States are.much less emphatic than those
which he used during thetsprimer and au
tumn In his speeches.
OBJECTS TO MUZZLING.
Dr. French Dissents From Proposed
Order.
Dr. Cecil French, a veterinary surgeon,
today addressed a communication to the
aealth officer of the District concerning a
phase of the subject, lately under discus
tion, of protection against rabid animals.
Re says, in part:
"Your favor of the 2d instant, in which
you suggest that it might become advisable
to urge the promulgation by the Commis
doners of a general muzzling order against
the dogs of the District, impels me to place
myself on record as dissenting from the
view that such a procedure would bring
ibout the eradication of rabies in this Dis
trict. It is, of course, obvious that under
such an enjoinment only those dogs of an
rwner would be found to wear muzzles
when on the-streets, while all the tramps
and .outcasts would still roam the high
ways at perfaet liberty to bite and snap at
whatever came in their way, be it man,
borse or dog.
"From observations and inquiries that I
have made from time to time during the
past few years when outbreaks of the dis
sase have occurred, I caninot come to any
3ther conclusion than that the ownerless
tramp is the main cause of the spread of
rabies. Such strange dogs have always
been described to me as of the cur type.
When the wandering cur has thus planted
the infection behind him in his domiciled
brethren there is not such great danger
zhat they in turn will become a menace to
ther dogs. I think I am safe In asserting
that there is no record In the health de
3artment of a person having been bitten by
a rabid dog which was not either an owner
ess tramp or on the premises of its owner
It the time of the occurrence. So that the
alame for this must fall back on the orig
nally infected animal.
"There are a great many dogs at large.
Ind though the poundmaster and his as
distants are continually decimatIng them,
heir numbers are constantly recruited
!rom the neighboring country districts. As
ong as the neighboring states of Maryland
and VirginIa. which without exaggeration
are hotbeds of this disease, exert no meas
ures to exterminate the canine nomads
roaming on the borderland of the District
the disease will find its way WithIn the
imits with which we are more particularly
concerned, even were the health depart
ment able to destroy every ownerless dog
!ound within Its jurisdiction. This lax
;tate of affairs does not exist wholly among
mur fielghbors, for it is only a little over
mne year ago that there camne to my notice
the presence of a hand or nest of semi-wild
:logs in Rock Creek Park,.not a mile from
Mount Pleasant.
"But much could be done to lessen the
ilanger were the facilities'in the hands of
the health officer propdhtienate to the re
luirements. The pound corI'should be in
treased four or five foiV rder that an
active campaign may benot only com
menced. but maintained aat this evil.
The District receives ann a consider
able sum of money in taxa ion of dogs.
