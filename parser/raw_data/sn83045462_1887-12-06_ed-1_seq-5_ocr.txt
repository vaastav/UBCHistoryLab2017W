TALK or A RESOLUTION or EMJCIKT.
The principal topic ot conversation this Doming
among member* on the floor ot the House wu the
change made last evening by clerk Clark in the
office of Journal clerk. Mr. Jno. c. Robertson, who
was appointed to succeed Mr. smith as jour
nal clerk, took the oath ot office this morning, and
after a consultation with his predecessor began at
once the discharge of his duties. He Is from In
dianapolis, was formerly a Ju ige of the Indiana
Circuit court and held for a time the position <X
journal clerk to the state senate. It Is rumored
that Mr. Smith will make a light for reinstatement,
and Mist a Michigan democratic member will offer
a resolution providing for an inquiry Into the
vague statements that have been made to the
effect that the change was as a result of a promise
by the Indiana democrats to support the Clerk of
the House in his candidacy for reflection If the
office of journal clerk was given to an Indiana
man, and that Don M. Dickinson had demanded
smith's removal. When Mr. Clark, the clerk of
the House, was spoken to on the subject this
morning he declared positively that Mr. Dickinson
had not communicated in any way with him in re
gard to the matter. He had Intended to make the
change last session, he said, but had deferred
action for various reasons. No member of the
Indiana delegation had been consulted upon the
appointment or knew of his intention to make a
change, save Representative Matson, who had
been requested to furnish some information con
cerning Mr. Robertson's record. Mr. Clark denied
la the strongest terms that there had been any
understanding between himself and the Indiana
delegation relative to his candidacy for the ofllce
of clerk. In all ot these statements he was cor
roborated by Representative liolman and other
Indiana democratic Representatives.
To-day's Komi nations*
WHAT 18 SAW or TUMI AT THE CAFITOI
For once, at least, the President's seieotlons for
Important appointments wort ascertained in ad
vance. To-day, as stated elsewhere, the nomina
tions of L. Q. C. Lamar, for Associate justice of
the supreme court; Wm. F. Vilas, for secretary ot
the Interior Department, to succeed Mr. Lamar,
and Don M. Dickinson, to be Postmaster-Oeneral,
were sent to the Senate. It was so well under
stood that these appointments were to be made
that they occasioned no surprise, but there seems
to be a feeilng ak'.n to disappointment among
Bome of the southern congressmen. The South
loses one of Its places in the cabinet
without gaining anything by way of
compensation, as the appointment of
Mr. Lamar to the supreme Beuch Is to
succeed Justice Woods, who was chosen to repre
Bent the south. The judicial circuit over which
Mr. Lamar will preside comprises most of the
Southern States, and hence the southern people
feel that they are entitled to that appointment.
There has been some speculation as to tlie con
firmation ot Mr. Lamar uy the senate, mainly be
cause of his age, but the prevailing impression ot
his party friends in the Senate is that he will be
confirmed without delay. He was long a member
of the senato, and has strong personal friends
among the members of both parties.
The Wool Interest*.
JOINT CONFERENCE OF GROWER* OF, AND DlALIUS IN,

The Joint conference ot the wool-growers and
wool-dealers was continued this morning at the
Ebbltu the time of the session being occupied with
an lnterchangoot views as to the changes thought
necessary to be made in the present tariff rates.
Committees representing each interest were ap
pointed to draft resolutions expressing the ideas
entertained, and these resolutions will be sub
mitted at a meeting to be held this evening.
These committees are as follows:
From the wool-growers?Columbus Delano and
J il Converse, of Ohio; James McDowell, of Penn
sylvania; O. H. Wallace, of Missouri; A. E. Shep

Henry T. Thompson and J. Sherman Hall, of Chi
cago; Edward Meller and Edward ureen, of Phila

Capitol Topic*.
EFFECT OF THE MESSAGE IN THE HOUSE.
While the President's message was not of an en
tirely unexpected character, yet the protectionists
could not help being startled at Its bold sentences.
The greatest attention was accorded the reading,
narticularly by the republican*. Satisfaction was
shown on the face of every tariff reformer In the
House and some of the enthusiasts were almost
hysterical in their suppressed feelings. Mr. Spring
er's face was wreathed in smiles, and Mr. Mills
sat with a hand at e tch ear with a look of pleasure
on his face. Mr. Randall sat uuietly In his seat
living marked attention Until the reading was
nearlv through, when he took up the prlnteocony
of the message and began reading for himself. The
message seemed to cause more of a sensation
among the republicans than with the democrats
Nearly every one pronounced it an unique docu
ment and decidedly forcible.
WHAT THEV SAT OF THE MESS AOS IN THE SENATE.
The reading of the President's message In the
Senate was listened to with attention, but very
many of the senators, after adjournment, upon
being asked for their opinion of the document,
said they preferred to examine it more closely
before declaring themselves. The judgment of the
St-naie may be summarized generally by stating
that the democrats pronounce it an able State
DaDer while the republicans say It Is a free-trade
menage intended to Influence the House in behalf
of tree-trade legislation.
THE HOUSE RCI.ES.
It Is probable that the old rules of the nouse
will be amended In several particulars before they
are adopted for this congress. It will be a con
siderable time yet before the committees are ap
pointed, and meanwhile there can be no legislation.
The Speaker will not wait until he Is ready to an
nounce the other committees, but will arrange to
have the committee on elections appointed within
a short time, so as to have hls'conteat settled.
UNDER V ALU ATION.
The senate subcommittee on undervaluations of
Imports promise to report a bill before the holiday
recess but nothing can be learned of Its provl
Stonslnadvance. It Is said to embody quite a
revolution in the customs machinery, and there
are intimations that It will excite the formida
ble opposition of the lawyer class for the reason
that itdlscourages?in fact does away with?a
proline and prolltable source of litigation.
THE SENATE COMMITTEE*.
The caucus committees of both parties in the
Senate held meeting to-day and began their work
of arranging representation upon the regular and
standing committees of the senate. It Is possible
though nardlv probable, that the majority side
will Be completed to-morrow.

The Secretary approves the recomui?ndatlcn of
Oen. Sheridan that 5,000 men be added to the
army, thereby perfecting the organization of the
Infantry by adding two majors and two corapanlea
to last regiment, and In t his connection approves
Gen. Schoneid's recommendation that two addi
tional regiment* of artillery be provided for.
TM SCHOOLS or WSTRCCTTOK,
the Secretary says, afford admirable post-grado
ate courses of study, and It will be necessary, as It
Is desirable, that every officer should take his tour
of study, In order that he may be fully equipped
for his duty. He trusts that the Mil Introduced!!!
the senate at the last session requiring the exami
nation of officers for promotion mav be passed
by ..c'0?S?"ess. lie thinks that the perma
nently-disabled officers should be at once
retired, and hopes I hat Congress will authorize a
sufficient increase of the reilred list to accomplish
the purpose. An Illustrated catalogue of the
army medical itrsBra,
he says, would be of great value to science. A
large portion of It Is already prepared, and au
thority from Congress to publish it is earnestly
requested. A larger appropriation for binding is
is urgently required. Unless the isecrotlry's
remarks as to the retired list receive the favor
able consideration of Congress, he does not urge
the suggestion ot the Paymaster-General that the
number of paymasters be limited to forty, and
that any paymaster of the rank of major, after
twenty years' service as a commissioned officer,
may be placed upon the retired list.

The secretary refers at length to the report of
the chief of urduance, and embodies in there,
port the recommendations sub.mt ted by him and
heretofore published in Tas star. The recom
mendallon of the Chief signal Officer for ihe
purchase of suitable premises for his apartment,
according to plans already suggested, is concurred
In by the Secretary as a measure of economy and
for the Interest of the service and saiety of re
cords.
Tne Secretary thinks that a regular and proper
organization of the Signal Corps would Increase Its
efficiency and materially reduce Its expenses.
THE LAFATBTTE HTATt'E.
The Secretary says that the basis of a contract
with Messrs. Mercle & Falgniere, of Paris, for the
Lafayette monument, has been concluded, and
the formal /?ontract has Mien forwarded to the

In conclusion the Secretary expn-sses satisfac

and says tnai the result of the examinations for
promotion was satisfactory.
The work of the Department continues to

offices, and recoursee must again be had to

THE SENATE CO.H.HITTEES.
Probability that Senator Chandler will
on the District Committee.
The work of preparing the regular committees of
the senate Is going forward. The republican cau
cus committee was busy all the forenoon, and the
democrats are arranging their list. Some of the
most Important committees will undergo very lit
tle change. There is but a single vacancy on the
District committee, and that Is caused by the re
tirement of Mr. Cheney, of New Hampshire. It Is
salt that Senator Chandler, the successor of Mr.
Cheney, will probably nil the vacancy on the com
mittee, and as ho has been a resident of Washing,
ton, and has taken a lively interest In Its progress,
the appointment is regarded as most Oiling. The
District committee win probably consist of Sena
tors Ingalls (chairman), palmer, spooner, Chace,
and chandler, republicans, and of Messrs. Harris
Vance, Brown, and Blackburn, democrats. There
Is some tal'i oi probable changes among democrats,
but Senator Ingalls wants to keep the old commit
tee together If i>ossible.
There is only one vacancy In the appropriations
committee caused by the retirement of Senator
Mahoue. The commerce committee loses its chair
man, McMillan, Conger. Miller, and Jones, of
Florida. Senator Frye will get the chairmanship
of that committee, Mr. Jones, of .Nevada, preferring
to retain the chairmanship or the committee on
contingent expenses, which remains Intact. The
finance committee loses only Miller, of New York,
and It will remain as formerly, with that excep
tion. Mr. Harrison Is the only member of foreign
relations Who drops out. Mr. Sherman will remain
at Its head. The Jud clary committee loses only
Mr. McMillan; naval affairs, Jones, of Florida, and
Whittborne; railroads, seweli, and public lands
Van Wyck. Mr. sawyer will get the chairmanship
of post-offices and post-roads. Military affairs loses
SewelL, Harrison and Camden, senator Cameron
will take either naval or military affairs. The
printing committee remains Intact? Manderson
Gorman and Hawley. of the minority committees
Senator Saulsbury will probably retain engrossed
bills, Senator Harrt? epidemic diseases, Hansom
private land cl 1ms, Mcpherson the Potomac River
front, and voorhees additional accommodations
forthe library. Mr. Gorman may get Nlcaraugua
claims coke revolutionaty claims, and Mr. cocke
reli will perhaps retain the woman's suffrage
committee.
as all the former members of the elections com
