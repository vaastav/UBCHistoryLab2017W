The following is a fair specimen of the

"Pnddy, dear, und did you hear
The news that's gninsr round :

What a grand mistake they made.
W c are* hound to have free whisky.
And maybe have free trade."
In France the div orce business is brisker
than in Montana. The new divorce law
there seems to meet with considerable
favor, if wc may judge by the fact that
thc-e have been presented to the Tribunals
of the Seine not less than 5,000 petitions
for divorce since the law went into effect.
On this basis, supposing the proportion to
hold good, there would be a demand
throughout France for divorce in more
than 80,000 cases.
Iowa schoolmasters are tougher fellows
and meaner creatures than the pedagogues

master transmogrified himself into a lover

him. The big girl got mad and told him
ahe'd not have him if he was the last man
on the face of the earth. The schoolmas
ter then resumed his functions as peda
gogue and thrashed her like blazes, and
now the big girl sues for damages to a
damaged back.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The annual message of President Ar
thur to Congress is a document of extraor
dinary length, and it is not entirely devoid
of interest. Our readers will find n full
text of that portion of the message rela
ting to foreign affairs on the first page of
to day's paper. The occupantof the White
I louse lias fed his independent subjects on
a mess of message too long for our col
umns, and so we can not do better than re
fer in brief to the features in the Presi
dent's paper relating to the domestic affairs
of the country. Mud» of the message in
treating of the affairs of the country is
quotations from the reports of secretaries
and other officers of the government which
have heretofore been given to the public
through the columns of the Tribune and
hence will not he new to our readers. The
President exhibits the finances of the na
tion in a favorable light and recommends
the immédiate suspension of the coinage of
silver dollars. The army and the Indians
receive some attention, and the fact that
the country hr.s been comparatively free of
Indian raids during the past year is credit
ed to the score of the army. Our coast
defences are discussed and appropriations
are asked to guard against attacks of for
eign foes. The Arctic expedition is touch
ed and praise is bestowed on the manage
ment of the relief expedition that succored
the survivors. The postal system is allud
ed to at considerable length. While the
sv stem is found not to be self-sustaining, it
is shown that if lias invariably been the pol
icy of the Government to supply the peo
ple with the most efficient system of mail
service that with a due regard to its best
interests can be furnished. The Mormons
in their plurality practices are condemned
and Congress is urged to assume absolute
political control of the Territory of Utah
and provide for the appointment of a com
mission clothed with such power as in its
judgment may safely and justly be placed
in its hands. He next urges commercial
improvement, assigning as an incentive
that we nre a people much interested in
mechanicnl pursuits and fertile In inven
tion. The President thinks that beneficial
results will flow from retaining protective
duties without making them burdensome.
In speaking of the civil service commission
he says that it has fully answered the an
ticipations of its friends in securing compe
tent and faithful public servants. After
referring to the local affairs of tiie District
of Columbia, which are shown to be in a
purer condition than heretofore, President
Arthur closes his message with the fol
lowing graceful acknowledgment of the
courteous co-operation of Congress and
the people in aiding him in performing his
official duties:
"As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from
the public service, I can not refrain front express
ing to the National Legislature with whom I have
been brought into personal and official intercourse,
my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy,
and of their harmonious co-operation with the Ex
ecutive in so many measures calculated to promote
the best interests of the Nation; and to iny lcllow
citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of
obligation for the support which they have accorded
me in my administration of the Executive Depart
ment of the GovernmvnL''
MEETING OF CONGRESS.
The second session of the Forty-Eighth
Congress commenced at the Capitol on
last Monday, the day fixed hv law. The
opening of the Senate and House was pre
ceded by a lively half hour of handshak
ing between Senators and Representatives
and their friends. The scenes on the open
ing day are reported to have been tamer
than usual. The Senatorial desks were
decorated with lloral devices, presumably
for the purpose of making the grandpas
of our country feel youthful and frisky. In
the House members indulged in jovial
greetings until the Speaker's gavel called
them to order. The meeting of Congress
has been attended witli no extraordinary
interest, and the vast business interests of
country do not seem to be unduly commo
ted over the event. In relation to the
character ol legislation to be presented at
this session Speaker Carlisle may be quo
ted as authority. The Speaker is reported
as saying that there would be no tariff leg
islation during the present session. Speak
er Carlisle has not, in any respect, chang
ed his views as to the necessity for a revi
sion of tiie tariff, but at tiie short session
of Congress he deems it inexpedient to at
tempt legislation on that subject. The
Speaker expressed the opinion that the
great question to come before Congress
this winter is the ratification of the treaty
recently negotiated between the United
States and Spain as to the free admission
to this country of West Indian products.
If that treaty is ratified sugars will be ad
mitted free of duty, which will result in a
large decrease In the revenue from cus
toms and in consequence exercise a very
considerable influence upon any tariff leg
islation. During the present session many
matters of interest to Montanians will re
ceive attention, piovided Delegate Magin
nis does his duty toward his constituents.
The preliminary steps toward the admis
sion of Montana as a State of the Union
will be taken. Congress, it is presumed,
will be hostile to our admission, but the
progress made in the matter will be watch
ed with deep interest by nine-tenths of the
citizens of Montana.
NEEDED LAWS.
Before the meeting of the Legislative
Assembly it is well for the Territorial press
to discuss needed laws and to call the atten
tion of the legislalors-elc-ct to such new
statutes as are required for the better gov
ernment of Montana. In a few running
suggestions we may be permitted to men
tion subjects that require legislation, and
the enactment of law s covering these mat
ters will be asked at the hands of the next
Legislature. A liberal, practical militia
law, encouraging organization and drill,
and providing for suitable discipline, is de
sirable for tin- Territory. A registration
law, which »»ill protect the established vo
ter. pro» ide for an honest ballot and lor a
fair count, is something that both political
parties should unite in enacting. Con
gress should be memorialized and asked to
provide for the appointing of a fourth As
sociate Justice for Montana. A law should
he passed compelling Boards of County
Commissioners to cause to be officially
published in the respective newspapers ot
the different counties full reports of the
proceedings of all regular and special meet
ings of the boards. The people should
kno»v all about county affairs in which
every tax-payer, large and small, is direct
ly interested. A well-defined est ray law
should be put on the statute books, requir
ing ail persons who take up stray animals
to advertise the same a certain number of
consecutive times in some newspaper of
general circulation »vit hin a reasonable
time after taking up. The ln»v should spe
cifically provide for the sale of stray ani
mals, at public auction after the same shall
have been duly advertised, and that the
monies derived from such sales—after re
imbursing the party finding the animal—
divert to the poor or school fund of the
county. A law creating three Commis
sinners districts in each county should be
enacted, providing that one County Com
missioner only be elected from a district at
one time. This kind of a la»v »»oui dis
tribute the Commissioners and give nil
parts of a county a fair representation on
the board. The general election laws might
be amended so as to provide for additional
polling places in precincts where the vote
exceeded five hundred, and the law should
be so amended as to make it obligatory on
the county boards of canvassers to cause
to be published in some newspaper of the
county the official result of each general
election in tabular form at the expense of
the county.
EDITORIAL ASSOCIATION.
Inspired by a leeling of friendly fancy
for a fraternal fellowship among the fellows
of the Montana Press, the Tribune would
modestly suggest to the brethren of the
pen the propriety of organizing an Edito
rial Association for the Territory during
tiie coming winter. It strikes us that pen
cil-pushers should have an organization of
their own, and that the proper time to give
birtli to such an organization would be dur
ing the session of the Legislative Assem
bly at the capital. If the scribes of Mon
tana are ready and ripe for the question,
we would respectfully suggest that Mills,
of lire AVit' North-West, manufacture a
motion calling us all together for the pur
pose of organizing. We name Mills lor
tiie work because he has such seducing
ways about him that we would all cheer
fully »valtz to the music of a call from his
persuading pen. Do it, Mills, and perhaps
the unknown pencil-heavers of the future
will erect a monument to your memory
in recognition of ) our services. We need
an association of this character. It would
prove beneficial in many respects. It
would be an organization for mutual pro
tection and mutual admiration. It would
afford the means of bringing the newspa
per men of Montana together, and when
assembled their united experience would
suggest methods whereby those »vho edify
the people might establish regulations for
the conducting of the printing business
that would materially help the members
of the profession which toils without ade
quate recompense. Socially it would be a
model institution, for modesty and merit
would be its foundation stones. With
these inducements, and many more reasons
that might be earnestly urged.it is apparent
thaï the formation of an Editorial Associa
tion—comprehensive enough in its scope
toinelude the followers of Faust and Frank
lin—is urgently demanded. We would
like to see tiie newspaper men of Montana
wakened up in this matter.
WICKED PLACES.
Rev. Mr. Rossiter, of New York City,
who musters in the same religious denom
ination with Rev. Talmadge, said in his
last Sunday sermon: "A minister who
goes to lewd places to get points of moral
warning for his Sunday sermon does ten
times more harm by his example than lie
can effect good by his sermon. Just at
this time once would appear too often to
visit a theater. I do not know anything
of what goes on inside a theater, but from
the show bills I see on the saloon windows,
and criticisms in the daily papers. I judge
that people see nothing there but -educ
tion, adultery, false marriage, robber», and
blasphemy."
