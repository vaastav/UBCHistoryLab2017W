Prrwltltnt National Rivera aad Harbors
Congress.
The National Rivers and Harbors Congress
met this morning In annual session
at the New Willard Hotel. A river and
harbor bill' satisfactory to the entire
country was promised by Representative
8tephen M. Sparkman, chairman of the
rivers and harbors committee of the
House of Representatives. Secretary of
AVar Stlmson predicted an increase of the
importance of the rivers of the United
States as transportation mediums beyond
what has ever been: the commercial supremacy
of the United States, due to development
of water way a was foretold
bv Dr. David Kinley, director ot the University
of Illinois, and President Joseph
K. Ransdell saw in waterways improve
ment the spread of prosperity that would
not work to the disadvantage of competing
carriers.
Over 1.000 delegates took their seats
In the big banquet hall. Banners bearing
the names of states or of organizations
represented In the Congress, indicated
the presence of delegates from
every part of the nation. Many men
of national prominence were in the
assembly.
The session was called to order
shortly after 10 o'clock by President
Ttansdell. He immediately introduced
Secretary Stimson of the War Department.
Address by Secretary Stimson.
Mr. Stimson was suffering from a
cold, and his voice was hoarse and
weak His remarks were therefore
brief
Til*1 rivers of the United States, Mr
Stimson said, will shortly recover
th?-ir value as transportation mediums,
and will take on a greater importance
than ever before in the industrial development
of the nation. With the
pioiH or period of our history nearing
its end. the Secretary saw the nation
becoming, instead of primarily a producer
of food, a great consumer, and
through this necessity reaching out
for trade into the markets of the
world.
"The moment we poke our noses into
thi markets of the world," said Mr. Stimiv.

l Commissioner Budolph Directs Heads
of Departments to Elucidate
Their Recommendations.
President Taft will not send to Congress
his special message on the needs
of the District until after he has received
from the District Commissioners
a more complete expression of
their views on the important questions
now confronting the people of
the National Capital.
The President early this morning
summoned to the White House cuno
H. Rudolph, president of the board of
Commissioners, for a conference on the
annual report of the Commissioners,
which was transmitted to Congress
yesterday. He requested that he be
furnished with a supplemental report
concerning legislation which, in the
opinion of the Commissioners, is most
needed in the District.
Budolph Calls Conference.
Within half an hour after his call at
the White House Commissioner Rudolph
had held a conference with the heads of
the various departments of the District
government and given i?istructlons for the
Immediate preparation of the supplemental
report, in accordance with the
President's wishes.
AH other matters were laid aside while
the department heads took up the work
of elucidating recommendations contained
in their annual reports to the Commissioners.
The Commissioners will go over
these recommendations and select the
most important to lay before the President.
It is believed that the supplemental
report wiU be finished by not later than
tomorrow.
Among the local officials called Into conference
this morning with Commissioner
Rudolph and directed to prepare additional
reports on recommendations previously
made toy them were Collector of
Taxes Charles C. Rogers, Auditor Alonzo
Tweedale, Disbursing Officer Louis Wilson,
Superintendent of Insurance George
W. Ingham, Secretary of the Board of
Charitleg George S. Wilson, Director of ;
PlaygramAr * . SAmttttr Purchasing Officer
M. C. Hargrove, Corporation Counsel
E. 1L Thomas and others.
Neither Engineer Commissioner Judson <
nor Commissioner Johnston was in the city
today, these officials, it was stated at the
municipal building, having gone to Occoquan
to inspect conditions there.
Yesterday the Engineer Commissioner
called ai the White House. Although
Maj. Judson would not discuss the object
of his visit, it is understood that he submitted
to the President a document con- 1
tainlng his individual views on matters 1
related to the District- 1
4
Brief Conference at White House.
The belief that MaJ. Judson had sub- j
mltted only his personal views was in- ]
creased when President Taft this morn- <
ing invited Commissioner Rudolph to a 1
special conference and requested that he
be furnished with a supplemental report
setting forth the attitude of the entire
hoard of Commissioners on matters affecting
the interests of the District.
The conference was a brief one, the
President merely going over the principal
features of the Commissioners' annual
report. He stated that there are a
number of recommendations in the report
which he would like to have explained in
detail before sending to Congress his special
message on legislation wanted for the
District.
What recommendations in their report
the Commissioners will submit to the
President as being the most important,
as far as the needs of the District are
concerned, remains io be seen, it is regarded
as assured, however, that they
will put themselves on record as desiring
especially the creation of a public utilities
commission and the establishment of
an adequate police and lit emeu's rebel
and retirement fund.
In compiling the supplemental reports
the department heads will not reiterate
all tiie recommendations they previously
iia\e made, but they will select the most
important and explain them more in detail.
The recommendations then will undergo
a second revision at the hands of tne
Commissioners, who, of course, realize
that the President will not be ubie to
include all of them in his special message.
Probable Recommendations.
ii in nAjwiru iiiai ine -i.'isirici neaus
will re.-ommend annual instead of trif-nnial
assessments hi the District, explaining
more fully tlie need of such legislation,
and, also, will urge the passage of
j a law for the enforcement, i?y a proceed- j
i ing in equity, of liens upon real estate |
acquired through tax sales.
< )f the \ ai iows municipal reforms urged
in the report, the Commissioners, in ail
probability, will ask Presidertf Tuft to
give consideration to those providing for
the establishment of a municipal asphalt
plant ami the conducting of a preliminary
j survey for the establishment of a garbage
| reducing plant, to he located at Oecoquun.

J. Henry Cochran, former state senator
c and a leader of the dtkiocratlc party In
Pennsylvania, died last night of pneutnonia
at his country place, Rosegill,
1 \ a.
d Mr. Cochran was born in Maine in
if 1845, and removed to Pennsylvania in

HIGH BALLSA TOPIC
Information Sought of Witness
in Lorimer inquiry.
GAUGING DRINK OF LIQUOR
Testimony Regarding a Conversation
in Chicago Hotel.
W. H. STURMER'S STATEMENT
Classes as "Barroom Talk" Threat
of Charles A. White Against
Lorimer Crowd.
* *
Hiffh halls and how to make them, how
much whisky makes one drink and how
mank drinks will make one man diunk
were aiscussed at the hearing today in
the Lorimer senatorial election investigation.
William H. Sturmer, clerk in the Brlggs
House in Chicago, repeated testimony relating
to conversations between himself,
Charles A. White and Fred Zentner, a
salesman, in which White was alleged
to have said he intended getting money
out of Lee O'Neil Browne. Sturmer testified
all three had been drinking with
him. He said White was drunk and so
was Zentner, and added that he had been
drinking also.
Senator Kern's Guess.
"How many drinks did you have?" I
asked Senator Kern.
"That depends on what you call a
drink," returned Sturmer.
"I should say about two inches and a
quarter," said Senator Kern. "Is It part
of your business to buy drinks for
guests?"
"No, it's not my business; it's a pleasure,"
replied Sturmer.
The effect of Sturmer's testimony was
that White's threat to get money from
Browne by telling of proceedings at
Springfield was made while White was
drunk.
Zentner corroborated Sturmer's testimony
as to the alleged conversation.
Witnesses for Defense.
The Tg>rlmer committee resumed its
session today with the prospect of hearing
a long list of witnesses called by the
defense to disprove the testimony of
Charles A- White, that Sidney Yarbrough
was with him in Springfield, HI., the night
of May 24, 1800.
Judge Elbridge Hanecy, counsel for
Senator Lorimer. had Cfporsre E. flloss of
Chicago and his wife, Kllen Gloss, ready
to go on the stand, expecting to prove
by them that Yarbrough was at their
home in Chicago the night White has
claimed he was in Springfield.
E. J. Bell, William Stunner and Fred
Zentner, all of Chicago, were waiting to
testify for the defense on the point of
Yarbrough's whereabouts. F. Lu Brown,
an Illinois Central railroad conductor,
was expected to testify that Yarbrough
rode from Chicago to Springfield on
White's pass May 25, lfiop.
The day's testimony promised to resolve
on the mysterious "coupon No. 28" from
White's Illinois Central pass book, by
which Judge Hanecy expects to discredit
White's testimony of what happened at
Springfield the night of May 24, when a
United States senator was being elected
by the legislature.
Opening Testimony.
The hearing began with less than hall
af the committee present. Senator Larimer
had a batch of telegrams from proposed
witnesses who wished to have their
appearances postponed.
F. L. Brown, a transportation official of
the Illinois Central, identified the railroad
:>ass issued to Charles A. White, and William
II. Sturmer, the Briggs House clerk
f Chicago, was called. Sturmer repeated
some of the testimony he eave before the
Burrows investigating committee.
He reaffirmed his former statement
of a conversation with White, during
which White was alleged to have declared
that he had something on the
"Lorimer crowd and was going to get
some money without working."
Boastful Barroom Talk.
Sturmer said he considered White's
statement "a drunken, boastful barroom
conversation." He testified that
Zentner, a traveling salesman, was
present at the conversation.
"They were both drunk," he said,
"hut Zentner was not as drunk as
White."
"They were on an old-fashioned
spree, weren't they?" asked Senator
Kern.
"Yes," replied Sturmer. He added
that White, Zentner, Lee O'Neil
Browne and himself were close friends
EPIDEMIC HALTS COTJHT.
Smallpox Prevents Attendance of
Jurors in St. Johnsbury, Vt.
ST JOHNSBURY, Vt., December 6.As
a result of the epidemic of smallpox,
which lias caused much worry in this section
of the state, not one of the jurors
impaneled for the December term of the
Caledonia county court is at the courthouse
today. Although it is considered
that the spread of the disease has been
checked, the state hoard of health ordered
the Jurors to remain at home, and as a
result the court will not be able to hear
any cases that require a Jury or witnesses.
The court will not make any attempt to
tight the health authorities, but will take
a recess until the danger passes.
In various places near St. Johnsbury
there have been more titan .".on cases of
smallpox during the past few weeks.
Physicians fear that the coming of cold
weather will increase the severity of the
epidemic.

TO COMBINE ACTIVITIES.
Plan to Consolidate Science Branches
pf the Navy Department.
A plan is ?mder consideration at the
Niurv T)marfnu>nt fnt> pnnNnliHiitinp tho
I activities of th? Naval Observatory, the
rhydrographic office and the compass office.
If that arrangement can be satisfactorily
effected the production and issue
of all charts, sailing directions,
nautical instruments and other information
necessary for safe navigation will be
placed under the direct supervision of one
officer. It is held that the proposed consolidaion
will insure greater efficiency
and co-ordination, and doubtless greater
economy.
Besides the valuable work done at the
Naval Observatory in purely astronomical
investigations, it also. prepares the annual
Nautical Almanac and Ephemeris in
general use by all navigators. The time
service, by which.the correct time Is sent
out daily all' over the United States by
land wireE, and to vessels at sea by wireless,
i's under the Naval Observatory. That
institution also has charge of the testing
and issue' of all nautical instruments used
by'the navy, including chronometers. The
hydrographic" office prepares the charts,
sailing" directions., notices to mariners and
hydrographic notices of great value to
our merchant marine.
It-was recently noted by the Secretary
of the'-Navy that the United States Navy
depends upon British admiralty charts
'for" about iW per .cent of the charts it
uses. f He added that the necessity under
present conditions of procuring many
charts'from abroad* has been embarrassing
in time of peace and might become of
serious moment in time of war. He

' The mystery surrounding the sudden disappearance
of a lake on John D. Rockefeller's
estate at Pocantico Hills last
week has been solved. It appears to have
i kiunaned unintentionally by Xew
I York city.
The Croton aqueduct runs through Mr.
Rockefeller's estate about 300 feet under
ground, and the water from the lake
flowed down into the aqueduct through a
crevice. The springs which fed the lake
are still running into the aqueduct- Mr.
Rockefeller's only resource is to put a
concrete foundation under the lake.

MEETING TO PROTEST
MUST RUSSIA'S ROT
First of Series to Be Held in
Principal Cities in New
York Tonight.
NEW YORK, December 6.?The great
mass meeting here tonight, it was announced
today, will be only the first of a
series to be held in the principal cities of
the country during the next thirty days
to protest against Russia's discrimination
regarding passports held by citizens of the
United States on account of their religious
belief. While this movement was i
startea by tne leading Jews or rsew York j
city. It has the backing of Influential'
Americans of many creeds, and the j
speakers at Carnegie Hall here tonight in- j
elude statesmen, educators, financiers and
business men.
The meeting will crystallize a demand
that Congress either compel Russia to
live up to the treaty of 1832 or that the
treaty be abrogated. This treaty marked
the beginning of the friendly relations between
the two countries. The organizers ,
of the present movement contend, that the
basis of the treaty was equality of treatment
in citizenship, and that Rusia's's recent
refusal to honor passports held by ;
certain Jewish citizens of the United
States is a violation of the spirit cf the 1
agreement. The national citizens' committee
which has charge of tonight's <
meeting has received assurances of support
from more than 100 members of
Congress.
The committee announces that similar
demonstrations are being organized in .
Ix?hdon and Berlin regarding Russia's at
titude toward the Jewish citizens of those
countries.
Among the speakers tonight will be Vice
President Sherman. Gov. Woodrow Wilton
of New Jersey, Senators O'Gorman
of New York and Penrose of Pennsylvania,
ex-Ambassador White, Champ Clark,
President Jacob Gould Schurman of Cornell,
John Mitchell, the labor leader, and
several United States representatives.

expresses the opinion that a body of

Navy Department, which can be utilized
either in detachments or up to the limit !
of the command stationed there, and
I which can be dispatched with the greatj
est celerity and" without undue attention
! being brought to the move, would be of
j the greatest value, botli to the State and ^

Therefore, he suggests the allotment of 1
! a site in the Canal Zone for the use of 1
i the advanced base and expeditionary ]
forces of the Marine Corps.

Mistake Due to Circulars Calling' for W

I
????Grouped
In Statuary Hall in the Capitol (
this morning a great crowd of colored thl
men and women met in the belief that Ar
the losses incurred In the collapse of the be
Did Freedmen's Bank in the early seven- of
ties would be fully made up to them by pe
the United States government today, th
They had come in scores, bringing with (3
them old and musty bank books, which 1
tor forty years have been treasured, in on
the belief that some day there would be
an appropriation made, or some law enacted,
whereby the full amount of the b*
deposits would be made good. Many of th
these old depositors have been disappoint- f0
ed before in the same matter?and they cj,
were disappointed today, and all through ^
a misunderstanding.
Circulars were distributed throughout Al
the colored churches here last week j to
calling a meeting in Statuary Hall. th
From there, the circular stated, the
meeting would adjourn to Speaker
Clark's office. This circular was read bp
in some of the churches, but not in to<
all of them. A minister of a colored mi
church in which the circular was not
read said this morning: pe
"For twenty years or more there has ,n)
been a continued effort to have the old to
Freedmen's Bank claims paid. At one th
time Recorder of the Treasury Lyons so
was interested in a method to pay these .
claims, but for certain reasons he dropped
the matter, and he is not connected ^
with the disappointment of this morn- de
ins. I received a circular on the subject.
but I did not read it to the congregation.
and would not allow the j
church to have anything to do with it" ; to,
They Asked the Policeman.
ri<
However, the impression spread abroad
among the old colored men and women p'
who have had visions of their nest eggs
returning to them that Speaker Clark pf
had arranged everything. Exactly what U(
the announcement in the ehurches was h)
could not be learned accurately today, but
whatever it was, the effect oa the old- 11
time depositors was surely a strong one. hi
They thronged into Statuary Hall and
talked Incessantly about their1- windfalls.
For an hour they continued happy in the &
illusion, and then some of them sought in
out a Capitol policeman and asked him: ...
"Where do we get our money?" 1
Now Capitol policemen are very fa- ui
miliar with the frequent pension hunter. S|
the disappointed claimant and the crank,
but the ingenuous queries of these old
negroes had a different tone. 01
"What money do you mean?" he asked SI
in reply. p*
Then ono of the old depositors ex- of
plained: in
"This is the day when we all are going ! Lu
to get back the money we deposited in N<
the Freedmen's Bank. They said it would te
be given out in the rotunda." ,
Of course, they were doomed to disap- R;
pointment again. iii
s?
Object Was to See Speaker. j ^
The true purpose of the circular, it was al
explained later, wis simply to call upon |
Speaker Clark and urge further legiala- j wl
tion for the relief of the survivors of the :
thousands of colored persons who lost!
their savings when the Freedmen's Bank ,
smashed, and a committee actually did M
see the Speaker later in the day. ce
The bank, with branches at Baltimore, CI
New Orleans, Jacksonville and other south- m
ern cities, had over 70,000 depositors when fe
a board of commissioners .took over its
affairs In July. 1874. The liabilities were f
over its $2,879,000 deposits. The bank
was in a badly tangled condition, and a,)
Congress provided for the handling of all lo
its funds by the Treasury Department. J11'
There has been a continuous appeal to ;l
Congress since then for the full payment "
of the negro depositors, but none of the l"
claims has ever been paid by Congress.
