The recent dccUIon ot the metropolitan
court of lubiiiio ( ] on tlic Joint optical ot
Fathers Mnriliy | and KltzRcrald from tlio
fcr-nu-nres Imponed by tbc bishop of Lincoln ,
contlnuiH to lie a topic of unabated Inlereat
In Catlmllc circles. A mom ; the priests of
Omaha considerable untlsfactlon Is oxpreMod ,
bin It IB H-mrcicd with regret over the pro
longed delay In reaching ft conclusion under
church laws. While rejoicing over the vln-
dli-ntion of th-'lr brethren of the Lincoln dlo-
CCFI- , they condemn the policy that rendered
proceedings necessary. "The bishops
bhnuld have suppressed Ilotinciini Inns ago , "
said onu clergyman. "They were well awiiro
of lite wrongdoing and his conleinpl of
church law. It Is admitted that they would
have done so lr.it for the fact that Ilia imp-
] > ntslon would have seemed to ho a victory
for tinprlista. . They look the slnml tlmt

i-\l.n. I.et tlirin now contemplate the ro-
rult. If Donocnm should now be retired , It
will be more mirprlslng than the fact that a.
dci-iston wax given ugalnat him In the
ini-triipolltnn court. "
This crlllclRin of the bishops la not wholly
ill HIT veil. It la learned that several of them
made diligent elTorts to resloro peace in the
Lincoln dloccxQ and effect a settlement that
vuiild be satisfactory to priests ami bishop.
Their efforts were unavailing. When Arch
bishop Hcnnessy of Dtilmquc notined the
prk'Hta. sonio mantlis ago , that a trial by a
metropolitan court hud been ordered by thu
li'opaianda ; , he appealed to them to pioposc
li settlement to the bishop nnil abamlon the
trial. The priests did so. They proposed to
let byguncs be bygones to forgive and for
get. Hut the olive brunch was rejected.
Just before thu court convened In Dubuiiuo
the arrhhltdiop personally endeavored to har
monize the warring elements. The priests
wore Killing ; the bishop was not. lie In-
Hinted on amends . : hut amounted t > punlsh-
inc nt. The proposal was rejected and thu
trial proei'i'ded.
TIIK QUESTION OK AI'IMJAL.
What the oilteome of the cast1 will be Is , of
course , pioblematlcal. Bishop Honaclim nn-
iiounrcd In a letter given to the press on
the nth lust , that ho would appeal from
the derision of the court to the apostolic
delegate In Washington. An Associated press
dispatch Irom Marshall , Mich. , the home of
leather Ilnart , judge of thu court ,
( jiiotes Judge Haart as saying that
the time within which an appeal
might bu filed expired last Friday
nnd that he had received no communication
from the bishop of Lincoln. According to
authorities , the only part of the court's
decree against which an appeal would lie Is
the amount of damages and costs assessed
against the Lincoln curia. The accused
priests were acquitted , ami cannot be tried
again far acts committed up to the time of
the trial. This feature of the celebrated cosu
Is best explained by the Western Watchman
of St. Louis , edited by Father I'hclan , a well
luiown canonist. In last week's Issue Father
Pht Ian says :
"Hy a late decision of a judge specially
iiy tiie propngamla to try tlio
case , two priests of the diocese of Lincoln
were acquitted of the criminal charges pre
ferred against them by their ordinary and
restored'to their parishes , from which they
had been dismissed. This decision was final ,
as ( hero is no appeal for the prosecution In
church or state. If the accuser had the
right to both make the accusation nnd drag
his victim from court to court until he got
ono to condemn , there would be little cbnnco
of justice for the poor and weak. A crim
inal rase comes to an end with the first
judgment In favor of the accused. In this
rant ) the bishop of Lincoln was permitted
by the propaganda to act the part of nc.
ctiser. ami It was In that capacity , and not
ns bishop , that ho appeared before Father
Haart In Dubwiue. An appeal Is from n
sentence , and only he can appeal on whom
n sentence falls. An appeal from an ac
quittal In a criminal cabo Is onu of tin :
Htrangest claims ever set tip In a court of
law. "
AN UI'ISCOI'AL MISTAKE.
The public letter of Bishop lionacum at
tacking both the verdict of the court and the
fairness of the prrHldlng Judge la regarded
by the clergy as a eerlous mistake. The
rules of the church strictly forbid the dis
cussion of church matters In the public
prints. Dlsliojw cannot violate this rule
without Incurring the displeasure of their
Hitperlors. Hence the bishop's letter la likely
to Increase the dllllcultlra that beset him.
The reference made to Father Ilaart'n
" .strain * cl relations" with Ills own bishop Is
rlalmed to be far-fetched. On two occaulons
Father Haart acted as attorney for priests
who had been removed from their parishes
by Hltdiop Foley of Detroit. The question
Involved In both cases was the right of the
bishop to remove them from ono parish to
another both parishes being of equal Im
portance without Just cause. The decision
of the diocesan court was against the bishop.
Thrse cases are said to constitute the only
grounds for the "strained relations" alleged
to exist between Father Haart and the
bishop of the dlocr.se of Detroit. The tone
of Illshop Honacum's public letter Is so rad
ical as to provoke expressions of nslonl.-di-
ment. In all his letters heretofore made
public he treated thu assumptions of the
p'-icsls ' with lofty ridicule and pooh-poohed
their hopes of dual triumph , The Dubuque
decision changed all this and provoked a
llcive denunciation of both court and
idnlntlfTs.
Father Haart , who In the resident priest
nl Marshall. Mich. , Is about 37 years of age
nnd has achieved a wide reputation an a
canonist. That ho enjoys the confidence of
the legation Is further evidenced by the fact
that after the trial at Dubuque he was or
dered by Martinet ! ! to preside over a like
court eUowhere. Thrao facts strengthen the
belief expressed by the priests that the ver
dict ot the metropolitan court will not only
lie confirmed , but that Ulshop Monacum's
dcpreltlon Is a foregone conclusion.
The amount of the money damages and
costs ansrfiscd against the Lincoln dloceso
Iiy the metropolitan court aggregates $1.521 ,
nnd lime for Us payment Into the chancery
of Duhnquo expires January 1. .Much specu
lation Is Indulged as to what will happen
then. Many of ( he clergy believe that Hlahop
lionacum will pursue to the end his policy
of "no mirrender. " and that the civil courts
of the state may yet bo called upon for
power to enforce the decrees of the church
courts.
CATHOLIC t'UKSS COMMUNT.
Whllo no mention has been made of the
case by the local Catholic paper , the West
ern Recorder , tlio Catholic press of the mid
west Is not silent. The Northwestern Cath
olic or bloux City , edited by Hon. John
Ilrcimoii , has this to say respecting Ill hop
Honacum'B public Utter : "It falls far short
of a Justification , it b n sweeping attack
upon the Integrity of the court and a naked
nsiertlon that the proceedings wcro null
nnd void In to o. It U garnished with un
dignified flings at the newspapers and per
rons nut named , and Is altogether beneath
the dignity of a Mshop. No chari
table person will rejoice over Illshop Hona
cum's humiliation , but all lovers of Justice
will rejoice over the triumph of law. "
Father Malonc's paper , the Colorado Cath
olic , says the decision hardly Justifies the
claim that It clguallzcs the establishment of
cletlaetlcal law In America , for the rraron
that Hlihop llonaciiin "spurni It , treats It
contemptuously , and maliciously attacks the
vindicated priests. As long an such things
can endure , wo arc a very long ways from
having ecclesiastical laww In America. "
The Woitcrn Watchman of St. Louis says :
"Wo have received from the court copies of
the sentences In the cane * of Fathers Fitz
gerald and Murphy In Dubuque. Wo can't
publish even extracts from them. They are
well calculated to make Catholics blushfor
their religion. There has been terrible scan-
dill , and It luiu lasted live years , but the
court places It ut the door of the blihop of
Lincoln ,
BKNTKNCK OF TIIK COUUT.
, Following la a copy of the verdict of the
tnMropolllAn rourt In the cn e of Ilcv I ) .
(1 Kitjwi-nld of South Auburn. It differs
from t ie verdict In Father Murphy's cane
only In thf amount of damaRos awarded , the
former rwlvlim 8BO and the latter $ .126.
"None of the uperlflcnttonn under the ncc-
end charge have been proven. As wns found
above none tinder the first charge wcro
proven. Kven the flscil procurator In hli <
llnal review dlnllnctly admits that the
charges ngnltvt the defendant hnvti not been
proven. Wo therefore Judge , decide nnd de
clare Hut thn defendant , Hcv. DonlR 0. Kit-
gerild. In not guilty of the chars * * lodged
asalncl him.
"From thin sentence , however , the con
clusion may not be drawn that the conduct
of the defendant , pending this whole contro
versy , was exemplary and without fault. The
records' of the case show that nt times even
the mrst reverend apostolic delegate wai >
not treated with proper respect. The Ir
reverence , however , was rebuked by the apoe-
lollc delegate hlmfelf and the rebuke wan
made public by the blfhop of Lincoln. Wo
may. therefore , no longer consider thlD fea
ture of the controversy.
"Neither doca this Judgment and sentence
determine , the amount due by the mission of
the defendant In the dloccsun chancery nnd
vlco versa. This matter ehould be fairly nnd
amicably arranged.
"Since It la our duty an judges In this
cent1 not only to determine the merits of the
principle cause , but also to consider and pass
judgment on those matters which belong to
It either ns accessories or conscqucnccn , It
becomes neiesary to review the record on
certain points nnd to settle the question ot
cosln. The record shows , nnd we have de
cided that the bishop of Lincoln without any
authority In law assumed and stated pub
licly that the defendant was suspended ,
whereas he was not suspended. In an offi
cial document sent to the defendant by the
bishop , the latter. In order to deceive the
defendant , stated that he withdrew , of his
own potion , the expulsion from the diocese ,
whereas thU wan done on the Instruction of
the apostolic delegate to whom the defendant
had appealed.
"Moreover , the bishop ot Lincoln , much
to the damage ot the defendant , In a letter
to ( lie public press , published this same as
sertion.
"Again , on October 2 , 189i ! , the bishop ot
Lincoln passed n most grievous sentence for
contumacy on the defendant , when the de
fendant was not truly and legally contuma
cious , anil when the essential forms ot law-
were entlrclj omitted.
"Further , In order to head'off any appeal ,
the bishop of Lincoln Informed the apostolic
delegate In Washington that under due pro
cess of law the defendant had been sentenced
In contumacy , the effect of which false re
port from the Lincoln curia was that the
defendant could get no redress and relief
from the legation.
"Ho wai , therefore , forced In great dls-
trcps to go to 'the additional expense and
trouble of making recourse to Home. When
the recourse had been granted by the pro
paganda , the Itli'liop ot Lincoln. In a letter
to Mr. Kelllgar , Intending to Injure the de
fendant , wrote that the defendant had de
ceived the cardinal prefect of the propaganda
and had obtained under falw pretences the
grant of his recourse and a rehearing be
fore thin metropolitan curia. More than this ,
after the bishop of Lincoln knew that the
whelo ciiw of the defendant was In the Juris
diction of this metropolitan court , he never
theless again Illegally fentenccd the defend
ant mrst severely , and In the final clause
of the sentence gave notice that the hearing
ot till ? case of the defendant was postponed
Indefinitely , thus deceiving the public nnd
greatly injuring the defendant. When finally
this metropolitan curia took cognizance of
the cause , the bishop cf Lincoln sent up to
this curia the actu of the Lincoln curia In
u mutilated form , having withheld svveral
essential documents' , among which was the
sentence he had Inflicted on the defendant
on October 2 , 1S05. which was the very basis
of the recourse the defendant made to the
propaganda.
"Thus ho also attempted deceit on this
metropolitan curia In a most serious matter ,
much to the Injury ot the defendant. After
Indicting the Illegal sentence ot October 2 ,
isns. the bishop of Lincoln further published
an excommunication against the defendant
so that all defendant's parishioners became
aware of his disgrace , much to the Injury of
his reputation. When on August 1.1 , IS'JO ,
the bishop revoked his Illegal censures of
October 2 , 1893 , he nevertheless In no way
repaired the damage done the defendant.
Moreover , the bishop deprived the defendant
of all bin means of support by appointing
another priest In December , 1805 , to take
charge of his qtiasl-parlsh and damaged him
so much In the estimation of his people that
It Is doubtful whether this special damage
can over be repaired. And of thla whole
case ot the defendant the bUhop truly says
'It has distracted the diocese and scandalized
the country. ' All this trouble , damage , ex
pense and scandal the bishop of Lincoln put ; ;
upon himself In his letter to the defendant
wherein over his own signature he admit' ]
that the basis of all the trouble , damage , ex
pense , scandal , viz. , the sentence which lie
passed on October 2 , 1S05 , Is defective and
Illegal and which we have declared null and
void. Underlying all these proceedings evi
dently wca some other motive than n sense
of justice ; considering these things and the
additional fact that not one of the specifica
tions under either charge was proved and
that little or no testimony was offered to sus
tain them , thus constituting legal calumny ,
there la nothing left for us as Judge but to
declare that the defendant la entitled and
must receive from the bishop and the curia
of Lincoln not only hl taxable cents , which
are In the sum of $179. but that he must
also bo reimbursed for the damages unlaw
fully and unjustly sustained , which hereby
we determine and declare to bo the sum of
$ S50. Moreover , we assess upon the curia
of Lincoln the actual coats of thla metro
politan curia In this case , which are hereby
determined and declared to be the sum of
$170. Hoth the cents of this metropolitan
curia nnd the costs ami damages of the
defendant given above , we order to be paid
Into the chancery1 of Dubuque by the proper
olllccr of Lincoln diocese within thirty days
from the date of this prraent sentence
"Furthermore , we Inhibit the curia of Lin
coln from further persecuting the defendant
bccaiiEo ot the charges for which he has been
on trial , and we order that the defendant
forthwith bo reinstated with all his lights
In the quasi parish , as It existed on Juno 15 ,
181)5 ) , when these charges wcro first brought
against him ; and , therefore , wo order the re
moval of Kev. E. J. Fenny from the quasl-
parlsh of the defendant and direct that de
fendant's name be again forthwith placed
on the list of the clergy of Lincoln diocese
from which It has been removed. Because
through the action of the bishop of Lincoln ,
the people of Auburn have become averse
from the defendant , It later it Is found
nccctssary or advisable that he be given
another mission or quasl-parlsh ; then as a
part of this sentence for damages we Judge
and decide that he must be given a mission
and quasl-parlsh at least equivalent to the
mission of Auburn an It existed on June ID ,
1S95. when these charges were Hist lodged
against him.
"That there may bo no misunderstanding ,
all parties are notified that by special dele
gation given ad cautclam , the exccut'on of
this sentence pertains to us aa judge dele

the feeling mnong railroad mutineers Is one
of much eonlldonce In nn early Increase of
business , which IH evidenced by their gen
erally enlarged orders for rails and for re-
plenlMhmetitM of rolling ntock.
Although the opening of congress has ex-
riled considerable Interest In Wnll street ,
yet It can hardly be mild to have had any
disturbing effect. The president's message
was , upon the whole , well received. There
ran be no doubt tlmt the past uncertainty
as to the disposition of the 'idmlnlHtriitlon
on the Cuban question bus In some measure
hold In check the current of prosperity
which fet In after the election. The vivid
recollection of the Venezuelan meswi
naturally mnile many people timid lest the
country might again be takop by surprise
through some disturbing outcome of our
relations with Spain ; and this suspense bus
undoubtedly held bark recovery in rortaln
directions. The president , However , has nov
revealed the wbnlo situation and lias fully
stated the attitude of the government , and
that with a spirit of openness and randor
which may help to obviate misunderstand
ings with Spain. The public appear to pen-
erally accept Mr. Cleveland's position as
wise and moderate , and the same view is
nrparent In congress , with little regard to
party. Thus , on this question , n great relief
lias pome over the publln mind ; and Kie Im
pression prevails Hint , unless * Spain should
assume an utterly reckless attitude , this
dangerous Issue may be ultimately settled
upon a pacificbasis. . So far therefore as
respects the Cuban ditllcilltles , the night
mare Is now dispelled , ami business men
run again move forward with their enter
prises without fear of distil'bailee from
Washington. It Is quite possible that Indi
vidual members of congress may seek to air
themselves on this subject , but congress
as a whole appears to sanction the tentative
policy expounded In the president's message ,
and sucfi sensations can therefore have little
Influence.
TRAUR REVIVAL IS CURTAIN.
The feeling In trade clrrles continues
buoyant and hopeful. Here and there , ho-.v-
ever. the question Is asked where Is the
great Improvement In business that was
rnomlred as the consequence of Mr. Mc-
Klnley's election ? The answer Is that It Is
on Its way , and will put In Us appearance
co soon as the march of the seasons per
mits. Some critics of the situation s'eem to
have Imagined that the promise of better
times meant that mero'innts and traders
who bad already boimlit their winter Mip-
p'les and were busy Hearing them out would
proceed to restock themselves for the sea
son's trade , and so duplicate their business
at the end of the year's business. This of
course would not be a revival of trade but
a commercial madness or a trade mlrae'e
No Intelligent merchant.1" have cherished
hopes of any surh Impossibility , and yet
they fiave generally expected a great busi
ness recovery , nnd have no doubt that It
did reullv arrive a few days after the elec
tion , and further felt assured Miat It lias
come to stay. They consider that It Is an
Improvement 'n ' business when eonlldenee
Is well restored. 'When hope taVes the place
of paralyzing apprehension when under the
Influence of that hope the Idle mills all over
ICie country start Into activity , and wren
the distributing trades largely Increase their
orders for the spring business. That Is the
kind of recovery practical men of business
have anticipated ; and the realization of
their hopes lias not fallen below their ex
pectations , sniiiTUlne as they may have
seemed to pessimistic minds. The full
fruition of these Im irovcments will be In
evidence when distributors and retailers be
gin to supply the demand for the spring
market ; when the unbelieving deprecators
will have to confess that the recovery grow
ing out of the sound money victory Is some
thing more than a myth.
There are also bilious persons nnd papers
who express a great ile.il of disappoint
ment because Europe has not been led by
the- election results to buy ! i large amount
of our securities , but 1ms on the contrary
sent home n large amount of our stocks
and bonds. This Is another case of disap
pointment at the non-appearance of n mir
acle. Thf election came just after we had

of tilie dlllleultles between the trust and

already at work upon the construction of

exists for any such statements. This par
ticular competition Is about as certain as ;
anything In the business world i-an be. An

11KALMNR STOCK CONSPICUOUS.
In the railway list Heading stoek has suddenly -
denly beeome conspicuous. Hear traders
ihammer It viciously. They are de-irossed
over apprehensions that the reorganized
company Will be seilously affected by ad
verse leg.il proceedings brought In the name
of the state of I'r.insylv.ini.t.
Of course the people who worry most are
speculators who have not a flngle IVnnsyl-
vunlii Investment Interest at stake. Thel
present Heading bugaboo has the same sub
stance to It that has been disclosed In a Ion
line of preceding fakes.
The antics cut iiy bear ralilcrs or tn
Heading property would be a refrcshln
spectacle were It not for the faet that tuei
style of attack , however silly , Impose ? pen
allies upon Innocent Investors. Cool headei
business men , sagacious and experienced
have controlled the reorganization of th
Heading property. They are not Impulslv
speculators ; they plan before they act ; en
terprlses of magnitude are not new to them
they are not blunderers.
Mven were a suit begun questioning the
legality of Heading's reorganization It Is
safe to count implicitly on ample jintlflca
tlon bilnjr ready for every step that Inn
been taken. Sales of Heading securities
long stoek or short stock , on the thenrj
that the fompnny'o reorganlzorn bave pro
ceeded precipitately or Inadvisedly , inun
bo sales by people with little Wall street
experience.
Next to Heading In the- railway list there
Is Interest In what IH going on In Manhat
tan Klcvatcd. Thanks to the nlsgardlj
management , which has been so long pur
sued there Is no local security hero so
much distrusted. The property lias bcei
shamefully mismanaged. The stinginess of
KiiHHdl Tngo hau bucn the adopted pole ! >
of the management.
Of a Hiidden there Is u disposition to
change. Om of the younger members ol
the Oould family Is coming to the front in
a live factor In'lhc ' company's affairs. Koi
the first time In Its history the ears are to
be properly lighted. Hut what Is of special
consequence Is tlmt now there has he-en an
olllclal vote to change the system's motive
power , the present 'old-fashioned coal loco
motives , uiioii Which New York depends for
what little local rapid transit It has , are
finally to he disposed of. Experiments are
already under way testing the comparative
merits of olertrledty and comprised air.
These testn have been talked of for Home
time. Now they are really being made.
One or the other will bo adopted within the
next sixty days.
The Importance of this Is not merely the
popularization of elevated roads here ; lla
ehicf consequent * ! Is ; the way It promises to
Hffit.'t .Manhattan's net earnings. One elec
tric manufncturlilg company has e-ven gone
so far us to oflVjto put up a bond guaran
teeing that by use qf electricity tlio .Man
hattan Klovnteit'wiirmivo 11.000,000 per year.
The consequenceof thlti appears when It In
shown that mich a saving would bo over 2
per cent on the capital stops. It would In-
Hiiro fixed dividends at n rate higher than
at present Is paid , and the advanced rate
would be earned , while- now that paid Is at
the expense of a deficit.

light lun of cattle , the receipts doing only
about half ns large as a week ago. The j
total receipts for the- week foot up H.O'J'i , as
against 1005S for the previous week.
Of the cattle here only adont MX ) head
were on sale' , and there were not really
enough cattle of any kind to make-a test of
the market. There were , however , two
loads of the best cattle sron here tills fall ,
fancy cornfed steers and he-lfirs fattened
for the Christmas trade. Aside fiom that
bunch there were only four loads of corn-
fed steers In the yards , and no KHISS west
erns good enough for beef. With so few
cattle' here It was not to be expected that
thu inaiket would show any material
change , but packets wi/re complaining that
they would no over Into next week short
of cattle , and that the market would be
Htronrer If there had been any rattle- here
to make * It any object to do business.
Butchets' stock was also In very light
supply , only four or five loads of cows
being offered. The- few cattle hero sold
readily at about yesterday's prices.
Slookcrn and feeders were strong and
active and the few loads on sale changed
hands In a very short lime. The demand for
dealradlc feeding ami stock cattle- has deen
good all the week ami more than equal to
the supply. In consequence the market han
had a gradual upward tendency.
