MMlen of lie left beak of tie flfctao to Franco and the creatton of a greater
8ertta. Including what ti now the Austrian prorince of Bosnia.
Von Bcthniann-Hollwef said he recognlxcd the fact that some people
in foreign countries were inclined to look at tho situation sensibly, lint
these, ho said, are In the minority and their yoIccs go unheard, like those of
certain member of the English House of Lords.
"But tho enemies' theories havo lost force," he said. "The people havo
ceased speaking about the war lasting twenty years. The pretext that they
are waging war for tho protection of small countries has lost Its persuasive
power since the recent crents in Oreece. Small countries are in a severs
plight slnco England Is fighting."
The CkMUKclIor 4tecvse4 Ute principle of nationalities as ap
plied by GenMay's c Beetle and askee whether the English Colonial
Secretary knew that of the lJNtfiW Inhabitants of Aliace more
than 87 per cent speak Herman as their mother tongue.
He asked whether Poland by right of nationality belongs to
Rassla. He demanded to know whether the same principle applied
by England In the ease ef Alsace loses power wb jH applied to India
and Egypt.
INVENTED STARVATION STORY.
Germany's enemies, Von Bcthm&nn-Hollweg said, had blinded them
selves at tho beginning of tho war by false stories about dennaay.
Now, after military and diplomatic defeats, they are only able to cling
to the idea of Germany annihilation. For this purpose they invented the
starvation theory.
"We all agree," tho said, emphatically, "that our foodstuffs are sufficient
and that tho only Important question is that of distribution. Tha great
economic unit stretching from Arras into Mesopotamia cannot be crushed."
CHANCELLOR'S TALK ABOUT
BALKANS SITUATION.
The Chancellor ioke of tho situa
tion in tho Ualkans. Tne entente pow

jrarld by liberal offers of neutntl nnd
Austrian territory to Join them.
"But tho Bulgarian Ciar redeemed

tho brunt of battle and was then de
sertftd by Russia," ho wild. "Berbla

Th rJinrllor mentlonod the at
tempt of the Allies to regulate their
lost Hainan position tnrougrn miww
nf vlnlsncA nrnlnst Greeco.
"ThoSe who used tho pretext that
they are making war against Pros
nlan militarism now threaten the
Greek Government with the power
of the English navy," he said. "This
nttHude make it Impossible for the
allies to continue the Belgian hypo
crisy. Why did not the Westminster
Uatette not mis at uio nca-in-nlng?
Then the whole world would
have heard the truth."
The Chancellor said tho Germans
now hold advanced strong lines In
Russia and that despite their numer
ical auDcrlorlty tho Anglo-France
troops have been unable to break
the Oerman front in tho west.
On the Av-tro-Italtan front thore
have been no changes, ne eaid, "ax
cent that the Italians iiave succeeded
in dcatroylng towns which they
meant to conquer."
ECONOMIC LIFE IN BELGIUM 18
REVIVING.
rtathrruinn-Ilolwer then discussed
briefly Germany 'a adiuluUtr&Uon. of
conquered termor;-. Kconomio lire in
Belgium la slowly reviving, be said
The coal mines are now almost ai
busy aa in .times of peace, having pro
duced ,500.ooo tons during the last
three months, be said.
"Belgium." he said, "now suffers
from the tact that England binders
tho export of Belgium "goods across
tha sea.
"Gormany'a task In the conquered
parte of Russia Is especially bard
since uie uussuui STorornmtwi nrui
Isft everything undono. The clUej
were without sewerage. They had
formerly been ruled by Russian bu
reaucracy. The Germans established
self-government In Poland where the
authorities now enow.xeai ana intelli
gence. Germany baa built nearly
1,000 miles of new 'roads. She has
oponed new schools, but the children
are taught the mother tongue, not
the Russian.
"Against the convincing power of
these facts," he eald, "our enemies ore
helplee. There is nothing in the In
formation we posses which could
bake 'our confidence. If our enemies
refuse, to recognise the facta they will
bare t'o do eo later."
The Chancellor mentioned the great
stores of copper, which, he said, are
sufficient for years of industrial de
mands, and the Introduction .of sub
stitutes like artificial rubber.
To bring greatly superior forces In
to the field, the Chancellor aald that
Franco already had coiled to the col
ore the doe of .19 17, bringing Into tho
war youth tinder the usual mllftary
age.
The Chancellor referred to 'the
charge that member of the crow of a
German submarine had been shot
while defenseless by the crew of the
British patrol boat Baralona?, and
aid the Knglleh pre bad oonoealed
the facta of this case from the nation.
As ho made theso remarks the whole
house arose aa an expression of Indig
nation. Speaking of the guarantee of the
position of Oermany 1n the future; to
be concluded In the peaca terms. Dr.
Von Beihmann-Hollweg Insisted that
the longer the war la continued, with
Increasing bitterness, by Germsny'n
enemies, the greater la the need of
sudh guarantee.
"Wo ion't fln-ht to subjugate other
nations." declared the Chancellor In
conclusion. "We fight. for the protec
tion of our life nnd liberty. For the
German Government this war his al
ways remained what it waa at the be
ginnings a war of dsfense for the Ger
man nation and for her future. This
war can only be terminated by a peace

SOCIALIST LEADER REPLIES TO
THE CHANCELLOR.
Dr. Philip Scheldemann, the Social
ist leader whose Interpellation resulted
In to-day's peaco discussion, followed
tho Chancellor. Dr. Holieldemann re
minded the Reichstag that at the be
ginning of the war tho Socialists ap
proved the attitude of the German
Government.
"A glance at the map," said
Scheldemann, "will show that Ger
many la conscious of her strength and
her successes. Germany can now
speak for peace without risking being
considered weax-tieartea or an
plrlted." iicheldemann protested against thoso
who dream of a war of annexation.
"My plea for a statement of peace
terms, like that of Lord Courtnoy,
need by no means be construed as a
sign of lack of strength," aald the
Socialist loader. "But the present
war Is bringing Europe to the verge
of ruin."
Rcheldmnann assailed the idea that
it Is possible to starve Germany. Re
cent census figures, he said, ehowod
20.000.000 swlno and 55.000,000 kilo
grams of potatoes In Germany,
enough rood, he said, to supply toe
entire Empire for a long time.
Koheldemann quoted Kaiser WIN
hejm as saying that this is no war
for conquest.
"Therefore," said the Roclallst
leader, "I have asked tho Chancellor
to state possible conditions of peace."
In' concluding Hcheldomann denied
that Germany la seeking world
leadership. ite asserted that she
wants only to be the equal of other
nation. The preaont moment Is
opportune for psace talk, he said.
By- moving now, Germany, he de
clared, may gain the glo.-y she first
dreamed of.

TWO GENERALS CAUGHT
German Cavalry Foiled in an
Effort to Rescue the Cap
tured Officers.
FETnoonAD, Dec. 9. Vla Lon
don.) The entire staff of the Eighty
second Germany Army Division waa
captured by Itusslan mounted scouts
nnd brought aa prisoners Into the
Iluaslan lines as the result of a daring
night raid recently, according to un
official accounts which have Just been
received.
Under cover of darkness, a small
company of scouts worked Its way
past the German trenches towards
the German base. Emerging from a
wood, the scouts found themsolves
close to a vlllago. They stopped and
sent forward a reconnoltertog party.
The latter soon cams upon a
Oerman sentry who gave tho alarm.
Ten minutes later a Oerman cavalry
squadron galloped out of tho village,
followed by two companies of A us
trlan tVandsturm troops. The nus
slans dismounted and concealed them
selves.
The Germana and Austrian fell
Into tho ambush and became panlo
trlcken when the nuailana opened
Are, the Austrlans running for thslr
live and throwing down thslr rifles.
Tha Oerman cavalry, not knowing
how large a foroe might be opposing
them, also retreated, many troops
falling under tho Itusslan Are.
The Russians were ordered to fol
low on foot Into the village. On ap
proaching a mansion, they saw
through the window figure of Ger
man officers. Halt of the force of
scouta made for the mansion.
A rush for the doors of the man
sion waa made by ten Cossacks. They
were so quick that the German offi
cers did not have time to secure their
coat and fur before they ware hus
tled outsfde.
The mansion proved to he a division
staff headquarters. The aoouts se
cured valuable paper. The whole
incident iook piaco in ins than fif
teen minute.
With their prisoners, the scouts be
gan to retire, The Gorman cavalry
men moan while had reformed and
attompted to cut off the Itusslan re
treat, The prisoner were sent back
unasr convoy ana tne retreat covered
by the bulk of the scouts, whn p.ir.
ceeded In returning to the Itusslan
line with small looses.
It I stated that the captured staff
nciuaea two uenerais, one being a
AJiTjiioa uuiuniaaaer, aeven Start o Ul
cers and several Hcd Cross physl
clans. One Colonel waa killed In at
tempting to escape.

HAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Dec. 9.
The Porto Hlco liner Coamo was
stopped this morning by tho French
cruiser Descartes, which took four
German firemen from tho merchant
man on board tho warship. The of
ficers, crew nnd alt the passengers
were exnmlnsd.
It Is reported thnt the Descartes
was looking for Waldemar Hepp,
Oerman Consul at San Juan and
John Htubbe, the Austrian Consul,
who ayi now In New York.
Clile? Steward Schaade of the Porto
Hlco liner Carolina wan taken from
that vessel lost night.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. Word that
tho American steamer Coamo and
Carolina hnd been eitopped by a
French cruiser, searched and that
four German flromen had been takon
off tho Coamo, elicited no excltoment
among omclals here. The right or a
belligerent warship to atop, visit and
search American ships at sea, under
certain circumstances Is not ques
tioned. The Incident Is not likely to
be made the subject of diplomatic In
terchanges, unless undue hardship
wero tmposod, or International law
violated.
It wan assumed, of courso, that the
vensel was stopped outside the threo-
mllo international limit or rono itico.
The Coamo nnd the Carolina nre
American steamships, ownod by tho
New York and Porto Hlco Steamship
Company. The Coamo was bound
for San Juan from New York, having
left that port on December 4. The
Carolina nrrlved at Ban Juan Decem

Bui Tagteblatt, in Comment on
Wilson's Speech, Says Ameri
cans Aroused Passion.
BERLIN, Dec 9 (via London).
"Persons wlio are born In Germany
and becomo American citizens cannot
be excused for violating the laws of
America," says tho Togobiatt, In com
menting upon President Wilson's
message. "Germany would punish
persons from abroad who came hero
and violated German laws.
"But the passion Of German-Ameri
cans to which President Wilson refers
would not have been heated to euch
a point If tho United States, under
Mr. Wilson's Presidency, had endeav
ored to maintain honest neutrality.
"That was not done. A great por
tion of tho press not only proclaims
sympathy for Franco and Great Ilrlt
nln, which is pardonable but wages
wordy warfnro against Germans."
The Morgon Post mukes n violent
attack upon. President Wilson. It
says: "This 'neulral' Government's
nonu nasinaraly a word ,of reproach
for the'SliamoleKs Incitements nr thn
Jingo press against Germany
but he insults an traitor. AnnrrhUta
nnd dlslionornlilo persons thoso men in
wnnm love lor the old fatherland lives
and who rise up against tho desplc-
nuic mings uono agninni tnem dally."
The Krouz Zcltung says that thus
far there has been no sufficient evi.
dence of German plots agulnst tho
united males to justify the words of
the message
"Ho that as It may." continues tho
nowspapcr, "Germany cannot be
made rtsponslblo for them. There Is
nobody in Germany who approves of
them." AjJAltL
