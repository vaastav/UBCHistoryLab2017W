HOW TO SAVE WILD GAME.
The State Zoologist Dr. Warren
Makes his Annual Eeport.
The Sportsmen Do Not Deplete the Forests
Hot the Market Hilnters Large Num
bers of Birds Shipped by Thein. A
Better Trespass Law Needed,
The chapters devoted to " the de
struction of game birds and ani
mals," and to "the violations of our
game and fish laws " are of especial
interest to sportsmen. In them ho
shows how wild game has played an
imKrtant part in the development
of the country, but that now to the
great multitude of the people of the
State game is no longer in any sense
an essential factor in the food sup
ply. ' It is a luxury, and sold at
prices which make it such, and the
traffle is one of large proportions,
with much capital invested. lie
says the sportsmen must yield to
the game dealer, or the game dealer
give way to the sportsman and asks
which it shall be. The interest
which is of least advantage to the
community must give way and the
ono which is of para mount public
importance must be preserved.
Either game must be saved tor the
enjoyment of those who pursue it
for the sake of pursuit.for the bene
fits derived as a recreation, or it
must be given up to those who sim
ply regard it for the value it repres
ents. He soys from the many care
fully reports obtained from the
grouse counties of the State it is
shown that 00 per cent, of all the
game is killed by market hunters
and shipped to the large cities.
That over 1,500 grouse were shipped
in one season from two stations on
the Delaware, Lackawaxen & West
ern Railroad and Wilkesbarre &
Eastern Railroad to New York
city. That young grouse are shipped
with woodcock during the month of
July. This market hunting is not
done by the farmers or their sons
but by professional market hunters,
who traverse over farms and en
closed grdunds respecting no rights
and who become impudent when
requested to leave. He states that
it is the consensus of opinion
that there is no use to at
tempt to propagate game so long as
this state of affairs exist, and sug
gests a reasonable trespass att, and
the restriction of the game traffic
so that it will include deer, wild
turkey, ruffed grouse, woodcock
and quail, and thinks this would
meet the views of the landowners,
and all interested in preserving and
increasing our game.
The fish laws are also being vio
lated in all parts of the state, and
the doctor thinks the violations of
the game laws are as numerous as
thuse of the fish laws. Snaring
birds is widely practiced, and he
says ferret are so generally Used in
the pursuit of rabbits in gome of the
Northern counties that they are
called " punching sticks," and that
in one county, Wyoming, two hun
dred were owned for hunting pur
poses. Doer licks, turkey blinds,
quail traps, dead falls, box trails,
snares and ferrets all play an im
portant part in helping to deplete
our rapidly decreasing game sup
ply. Running deer rith dogs, and
shooting them at deer licks is albO
carried on to a considerable extent
in several sections of the State.
Anti-Overcoat Club.
Several Stroudsburg gontlemon in
cluding Editor Morey, Dr. Walton,
J. D. and W. S. Shafer, Wm. Gulick
and A. V. Miller have agreed not to
wear an overcoat this winter under
penalty of a large forfeit. They
will probably wrap themselves in
the sweet consciousness of the good
example they are setting others.
Suoeautul FUlilng.
"Doo" Steele and brother went to
Sawkill Pond lust Saturday and
succeeded in raising 44 fine pickerel
through the ice, and on Monday

MILFOKD, PIKE COUNTY, PA., FRIDAY,
Notes From the Pennsylvania Experiment
Station.
The State Experiment Station has
recently issued the first number of
a series of Bulletins of Information.
It is the intention, in this series of
bullotins, to present, to the farmer
in simple and concise form the re
sults of investigation and the best
available scientific and practical in
formation on the various branches
of farming.
The first bulletin of the series is
entitled "Computation of Rations
for Farm Animals." It consists of
two parts. The first is a brief ex
planation of the principles upon
which the computation of rations is
based. Following this, Part 2 shows
by numerous examples how these
principles may be applied to the
daily problems of the farm. Ex
amples are given of the improve
ment of rations, of the compounding
of rations from given feeding stuffs,
and in particular of the selection of
feeding stuffs with reference to
economy in their purchase and use.
It shows how an intelligent applica
tion of the principles of Part 1 may
enable the farmer, by exchanging
one feed for another or by wisely
proportioning his feeds, to reduce
the cost of his rations and at the
same time improve their quality
and add to the fertility of his farm.
The bulletin is being disturbnted
at all the farmers' institutes held in
the State, and will be mailed free to
any resident of , the State applying
for it.
The Station has also issued a re
vised edition, in more convenient
form, of the spraying calendar for
which there was so large a demand
last year.
" The annual Reports and quarterly
Bullotins of the Station will be sent
free of charge, on application, and
inquiries on agricultural subjects
answered so far as possible.
Address,
II. P. Armsby, Director,
State College, 1
Centre Co. , Pa.
Vacclnnatlon Compnlsory,
Judge McPherson, of Dauphin
county handed down a decision re
cently in which the court holds,
that the right of any citizen's chil
dren to attend the publio schools is
not complete until they have com
plied with the conditions which the
legislature has seen fit to impose.
The act of June 18, 1895 requiring
school directors to demand certifi
cates of successful vaccinnation, as
a condition precedent to admission
to the publio schools, is a "valid
police regulation, and as such con
stitutional. If the compulsory edu
cation act and the law tinder consi
deration are in irreconcilable con
flict the former statute must give
way, because the Publio Health Act
was last enacted and therefore takes
precedence of the other. ,
Perished In the Slorm.
Among the viotims of the great,
blizzard, which raged in the north
west on Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday of lust woek is numbered a
Deposit boy, Henry M. Burrows a
mail clerk on the Northern Paciflo
R. R. He left his train which was
stalled at Devil 's Luke, North Dakota
to go to town for provision and
perished in the storm. His wife and
children live in Deposit.
War of Beef Companies. (
The two large and wealthy meat
corporations, the Armour beef com
pany and the Swift meat company
of Chicago are engaged in a lively
competition at East Stroudsburg in
building cold storage warhouses.
Each are at work as rapidly as pos
sible pushing their structures,
which will cost about 110,000, to
completion.
News Via Stroudsburg.
A Stroudsburg dispatch to the
Philadelphia Press says: Measles
have broken out to an alarming ex
tent in this county, that schools in
Matu moras have been closed and two
deaths reported. All of which is the
sume kind of stuff that dreams are
sometimes made of , a disordered im'.
agination.

The President's Message.
On another pai,e will be found a
synopsis or Mr. Clevelands lost
words as Chief Magistrate to the
American people. It has the gen
eral tone of one who is willing to
shift the burden of responsibility on
his successor, and outside of his re
marks on the Cuban, and revenue
questions, it is little more than a
resume of Department reports. His
discussion of the Cuban matter is
temperate, and in harmony with his
previous attitude. It may be judged
that his sympathy with that strug
gling people is much stronger than
his language and that he feels re
strained because of his position,
and in order that our Government
may not lose her influence with
Spain in aiding to bring about a
settlement. - ;
Congress at its last session passed
resolutions declaring that our Gov
ernment ought to use ' its good in
flnenoes in the direction of Cuban in
dependence. The message discloses
that the President has in a measure
used his office, but not for independ
ence. It has been more in the line
of having Spain grant autonomy to
Cuba, or in other words conceding
some measure of home rule. It
cannot be known whether this
would be possible or acceptable,
even if this country should find
some means of guarenteeing to Cuba
its execution.os no response has been
received. He treats the deficit
rather lightly and thinks the pre
sent tariff bill will produce ample
revenue if given a fair trial, thus
impliedly opposing the 'passage of
any emergency measure. It is con
sonant with himself to say this for
any other view would be to condemn
his own policy.
Married Women mm Incorporators.
Attorney General McCormick
holds that subscription to the Capi
tal stock of a corporation whereby a
married woman becomes an incor
porator, is a contract upon her part
to pay the sum so subscribed. If
she may make a subscription to the
Capital stock of a corporation and
be liable on such a contract, it
would seem that she would be fully
qualified as an original subscriber or
incorporator and liable as such.
Brooks vs. Merchant's National
Bank decides that a married woman
may now enter- into a partnership,
and as a result become individually
liable for all the debts of the firm.
Killed Near Lackawaxen.
Monday night a freight train
eastward bound struck and killed

His father was William Kirkham of
Rowlands and he also had a brother
Howard, and two sisters one the wife
of Thos. J. Ridgway of Rowlands.
The commissioners besides hav -ing
their office newly floored, hav
