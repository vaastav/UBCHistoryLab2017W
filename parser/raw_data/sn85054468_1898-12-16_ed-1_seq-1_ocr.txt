American l'crrle -A Defense of
Iiuitcrlulihni.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec 13. President JltKn
ley -received another ovation this after
noon. 'When lie stepped upon the plat
form in the Auditorium in 1'leJinont Park
nearly S.CCJ persons must have been
lucked in the huge Larn-Uke eJlficc. which
fairly shook under the mighty shouts that
went up inslile of it In greeting to the
President, lI- Cabinet ana famous fight
ing men. The exercises were opened se
dately enough with prajcr, but from the
close of the prajcr on. there was nothing
but the noisiest kind of enthusiasm.
Secretary Alger started the bill rolling
by stepping to the front of the platform
and asking the band to play "America"
and the audience to sing to it. Then thi
Problem took charge of affair?, nnd cs
the first bars of the song were played he
led the Mnglng lu jitrsoa.
The Prtsldcnt, in his speech. Mid:
Fnder hotlIe fire on a foreign soli,
fighting in a common cause, the memory
of old disagreements ha- faded into his
lory. I'rom camp and campaign there
romca tlie magic healing which has clocl
indent wound and effaced their scars.
Fur the result every American patriot will
fonder rejoice. It U no small indemnity
for the cost of tlie war. This Government
has proved ltlf invincible In the ritcit
ar, and out of It has come a nation
which will remain lndlI-lble forever
more. No worthier cintrlbutiocs have
Jiecn made in fiairlulkm and In men than
by the ieople of these Southern States.
I'l.dcr tlie able leadership of men dear ta
them, who had marched with their faiherj
under another flag, now fighting under th"
old (lag again they have gloriously helped
to defend its spotless folds and aided new
luster to its shining stars. That Hag !ia3
been placed In the two hemispheres, and
there i remains the sjmbol of liberty and
law, of peace and ;rogrecs. "Who will
withdraw from the people over whom It
lloats its protecting fclds? Who will haul
it down?
The 1'copIeN ietory.
"The v Ictorj wc celebrate is not that of
a ruler, a President or a Congress, but
cf the people. The place v.c have won is
rot a sclflsh truce of arms, but one whos3
condition": presage goad to humanity. We
have so bcrno ourselves in tlie conllict
and In our intercourse with the powers
of the world as to escape complaint or
complication and to give universal con
fidence of our high purpose and unselfish
tacrlfice for a struggling people.
The task is nut fulfilled. Indeed, It
is only just begun. The more serious
work is still before us and every energy
of heart and mind must be bent and the
pules of partisanship subordinated to
its faithful execution. New occasions
teach new duties. Meetirg these condi
tions hopefully and facing them bravelj
and wisely is to be the mishtiest tot of
American virtue and capacity. Without
abandoning past limitations, tradi ion3
and principles, but by meeting pres nt
opportunities and obligations, we stall
show ourselves worthy of the great trusts
T.hlcli civilization has Imposed upon us.
The glories of war cannot be dimmed,
but the result will be Incomplete and un
worthy of us unless supplemented by
civil victories, harder, possibly, to win;
In their way no less indispensable.
The Genius of Our Civilization.
"The republic is today larger, stronger,
and better prepared than ever before for
wiso and profitable development In new
directions and along new lines, and if the
minds of our own people are still dis
turbed by perplexed and anxious doubts
in which all of us have shared and still
share, the genius of American civiliza
tion will, - I believe, be found both
original and creative and capable of ob
serving all the great Interest which shall
be confined to our keeping.
"If we had blinded ourselves to the con
ditions so near our shores and turned a
deaf ear to every suffering neighbor, the
issue of territorial expansion in the An
tilles and the East Indies would not have
been raised. Uut could we have Justified
such a course? Is there .-inone who
would now declare another to have been
the better course? With less humanity
and lecs courage on our part, till Spmish
Hag, instead of the Stars and Stripes,
would still be floating at Cavite, at Ponce
and at Santiago, and a chance in the race
of life would be wanting to millions of
human beings who today call the nation
noble and who, I trust, will live to call
it blessed.
When the Mists Clear Avv.-iy.
"Thus far, wc have done our supreme
duty. Shall wc now, when the victory
won In war is written In the treaty, of
peace and the civilized world applauds
and waits in expectation, turn timidly
away from the duties imposed upon the
country by its own great deeds? And
when the mists fpde away, and we see
with clearer vision, may we not go forth
rejoicing in a strength which has been
employed solely for humanity and alw-ajs
been tempered with justice and mcicy,
confident of our ability to meet the exi
gencies which await us because confident
that our course is one of duty and our
cause that of right?"
Pandemonium broke loose when the
President finished and was continuous
thereafter until he and his party arose to
leave. Silence only reigned at Intervals
when Gen. Wheeler, Gen. Shafter, Gen.
Law ton. Gov. Johnston and Lieut. Hob
foi; appeared at the front of the platform
in answer to calls. After tho sneaking
was ov er the guests and the audience ad
journed in a mass to the public reception
at the executive mansion, which was a
.genuine crush.
The day was not a hard one for the
jucsidentlal party, although a very full
ore. President McKInley and most of II12
citj's guests remained In quiet seclusion
during the morning. Gen. Wheeler, how
ever, was active enough to take a prom
inent part in helping to form the order of
' Service Men of the Spanish War."
At 12 o'clock, the President and party
were driven to the stand from which
the President reviewed a long mil
itary and civic oarode. The Fifteenth
Pennsylvania and Third New Jersey Vol
unteers and Gen. Wheeler at the head of
a few score of his old Confederate caval
rjmen were the chief features of this
pageant.
When it had passed the reviewing stand
the presidential party was entertained
with luncheon at the Driving Club, in
Piedmont Park, and went from there to
the Auditorium. The number of events
en the official program was a guarantee
against monotony, but not much time was
left for the banquet at night.
Probably no recent banquet has brought
together such a number of distinguished
men as were here tonight In honor of the
President.
Among those at his table were: Clark
Howell, Gov. Allen D. Candler, Capt. T.
IJ. Nell, MnJ. Gen. Shatter, Major
Charles r. Warwick of Philadelphia
Lieut. Hobson, Stephen O'Mcara of Bos
ton, John Addison Porter, Gen. A. M.
Pennington, Gov. Voorhces of New Jer
sey, Hoke Smith, Gen. Henry W. Law
ton, Gov. Johnston of Alabama, Maj.
Gen. Young, Maj. Gen. Joe Wheeler and
Secretaries Smith, Long, Gage, Wilson
and Alger.
Covers had been laid for three hundred
other guests. The banquet proved to to
an opportunity for the expression of sen
timents of patriotism and fraternity
which were well in keeping with the era
of good feeling- which President McKIn
ley inaugurated In his happy address 3 es
terday. Tlie speakers and subjects were: The
President, "Our Country;" Secretary
Long, "The Navy;" Maj. Gen. Shafter,
"Tlie Armr;" George It. Peck. "The New
Union:" Stephen O'Meara, "Santiago, the
Plymouth Hock of Cuban Freedom;"
Secretary Gage. "How-the People Paid the
Hill;" Maj. Gen. Wheeler, "The Sotith's
Part in the War;" Maj. Gen. Young, "The
Volunteer us Viewed by a Regular In Com
mand;" Postmaster General Smith, "The
War as an Echo of Independence Hall;"
Gov. Johnston of Alabama, "Tlie State
Government's Answer to the Call to
Arms;" Lieut. Hobson. "We Follow
Where Duty Calls;" Mayor Warwick,
Philadelphia, "What the Liberty Bell
Says About It;" Congressman Settle,
"There is no Minority in Patriotism."
Mr. MrKlulcj's Response.
Mr. McKinley said:
"I am not a stranger to your hospi
tality. You have nlwajs given me a
courteous and cordial reception. My first
visit was under the auplce3 of jour fellow-citizen.
Capt. Howell, and another
distinguished Georgian, the brilliant
Grady. Then we were engaged In an
economic discussion. In which honest dif
ferences of opinion prevailed and heated
discussion ruled tlie hour. I do not for
get that then, although advocating the
theory or taxation seemingly opiiosed to
the majority sentiment of our State and
city, jou nciprdcd me an impartial hear
ing. Stranger as I was to all of jou. ou
made me feel at home, and from that
hour Atlanta won ray heart. My subse
quent visits here only served to increase
my admiration for your enterprising city.
Tour jears have gone since I last met
tlie people of Georgia In public assembly.
Much lias happened In the Intervening
time. Tlie nation has been at war, not
within Its own shores, but with a foreign
power, a war waged, not for revenge or
aggrandizement, but for our oppressed
neighbors, for their freedom and amelio
ration. A biircc-KMlon of Victories.
"Jt was short, but decisive. It recorded
a succession of significant victories ou
land ard sea. It gavo new honors to
American arm. It has brought new prob
lems to tho ltcpublic, whoso solution will
tax the genhn of our people. United we
will meet and solve them with honor to
ourselves and to the lasting benefit of ail
concerned. The war brought us together.
Its settlement will keep us together. Un
united, glorious realization! It expresses
the thought of my mind and the long
deferred consummation of my heart's (le
b'.TC as I stand ili this presence. It lnter
rxets tlie hearty demonstration here wit
nessed ami Is the patriotic refrain of aU
sections and of all lovers, of the Republic
Reunited, one country again and one
country forever! Proclaim it from the
press and pulpit; teach It in the schools;
write it acro-s the skies! The world see;
and fecis it; it cheers every lieait in Nortl
and South and brightens the life of ever..
American home. Let nothing ever strain
it again. At peaco with all the woild and
with each other, what can stand in the
pathway of our progress and prosperity ?'
Gen. Young's address was made along
the line of the necessity of professional
training for tho soldier. He dnelt at
length on his experience in the civil and
Sparlsh wars with volunteer soldiery, and
said in part:
Tvvo Volunteer HeRlment.
"In looking at the volunteers and con
sidering them as soldiers, the fact is lost
sight of that they hav c not received a pro
fessional education. We are too quick to
condemn, wc are slow to remember that
these patriotic men, taken from every
walk of life, cannot, within less than a
year, be educated to the point wheie
these obligations to them are paramount.
I speak particularly of two volunteer
regiments, the Scventj -first New York
and Second Massachusetts, for tho rea
son that these were the only volunteer
regiments, except the First Volunteer
Cavalry, present with the regular forces
that plajcd an important part in tlie bat
tles in and about Santiago. I have sin
cerely regretted that these two regiments
were taken away from my brigade, be
cause they were brought into act'on b:
fore they had attained the confidence In
their company and regimental officers
that is necessary to success in an en
gagement. Understand me distinct y,
that I am not criticising the action of
these regiments under fire. There is no
better material in these United States
than is to be found in those two regi
ments, but they lack the instruction ard
tho training necessary to success in the
extreme hour of trial.
"With our limited force In that expedl.
Hon it was necessary to call upon these
two regiment's, but they were called upon
too soon. They were not fitted for the
work."
As tho President's special train was
scheduled to leave Atlanta at 12:03 o'clock,
the banquet was not prolonged.
Tho President will visit Booker T
Washington's InsUtute, at Tuskegec.
which he will reach in tho morning, where
ho will make his longest address of the
tour. Ho will visit Montgomery In the
afternoon.

Santiago do Cuba, Dec 13 Senor An
deldo 'lamas o. associate Justice, of tlie
Supremo Court here, has- resigned aCnd
lias been appointed by Gen. Wood aa at
torney for the department. His succes
sor on tho bench has not been selected,
hut will be Immediately. Senor Tamajo
will represent tho department in all
claims for damages by Cuban, ar.d
others resulting from the unsettled state
of the country during the past three
j ears.
Tho committee of American officers ar.d
Cuban lawjers which was oppolntjd Ly
Gcn. Wood to inspect the taxable prop-'
crty here and to arrange a scLedule of
taxation havo completed Its work and
will submit Its report tomorrow. It Is be
lieved that a tjstcm of taxation can le
instituted within u- week which will en
able the city to get enough money to
carry through tho work on tho new wa
ter system, which Is greatly needed just
now. It Is believed that Gen. Wood will
make the system of taxation retroactive
to tho first of October, instead of the
first of September, which was the ori
ginal scheme. None of the business
houses here has iiaiJ any municipal taxes
since the occupation of the island by the
Americans.
Capt. V It. I.jle, of tha revenue marine
service, and Capt. James Shelley, of the
Fifth Immunes, started overland for Ma
jnrl today. They have been commissioned
by Gen. Wood to raise the Spanish gun
boat that was sunk in the bay of NIpo
during the war to prevent the ingress of
American; warships.
A citizen of Mayari named Joaquin Tcr
rer protected to Gen. Wood today that
the gunboat was his property. Ho de
clared that he had purchased it from the
Cuban government at Mayari and showed
a. bill to support h! stnlement. Gen.
Wood told him no one had the right to
sell tlie vessel and authorized Capt. Ljie
to apply to Col. Hood, at Holguln. for
as-stanco If the Cubar.3 Interfered with
the work of raising the gLnboat.
Surgeon Major William Solz returned to
day from the Holguln district on board
tlie ttcamcr Los Angeles. He told your
correspondent that The smallpox epidemic
In the district had almost been conquered.
The number of cases has been reduced
from D.CCO. which was the INt when CoL
Hood took hold of njatters there, to 500,
and most of the patients arc now- con
valescing. The experience of the village of Auras,
near the city of Holguln, indicates the
severity of the epidemic. Scve-n hundred
of its l.tCO inhabitants died of smallpox in
two jears. . Tho town itself was half
burned away, the people setting fire to the
houses In which patients died and burning
the bodies of the victims with the build
ings. Mure than ItX) Cuban laborers on tha
wharves here struck today and refused to
unload the transoort Port Victor. The
caue of the strike was the decision of
Gen. Wood to reduce the pay .of the la
borers from 51.50 to J1.25 per day. When
the decision was made known the laborers
demanded S1.S9 for a daj's work and then
quit.
They declared that they would not per
mit other laborers to take their places.
Gen. Wood immediately sent SCO men to
take tho places of the strikers. They
were accompanied and protected by a
company of Infantry, the captain of which
had orders to kill anvone who interfered
with the new- men.
When the strikers were informed of
these orders they sullenly gave way to
the new men. Under Spanish rule wharf
laborers received CO cents a day.
A HAVANA RAILWAY SOLD.
Tlie Property UoiiKlit liy n Sjndicnfc
for $1,172,000.
Havana, Dec. 13. An exciting meeting
of tlie stockholders of the Terro Carrli
Street Railway Company, of this city,
resulted jesterday in the sale of the en
tiro property to a. sjndicate headed by
Col. G. B. M. Harvey, of New York.for $1.
472,000, or $)2 a share. The meeting lasted
six hours. The American Indies Com
pany, another New York sjndicate, prom
ised to bid above par if the meeting
could bo postponed a week, and a Ger
man syndicate agreed to bid S03 under the
same conditions. Tho stockholders final-lj-
decided to take tho bid in hand and
accepted the proposition of Mr. Castena
da, who was supposed to represent an
Hngllsh sjndicate, but, as transpired af
ter the meeting, really represented the
Harvej- sj-ndicate. of New York. As the
Ceballos concession, purchased by the
Indies Company has been awarded to the
Ferro Carril, the purchase Includes the
entire street railway sjstm and conces
sions of Havana. This is tho same syn
dicate which bought the Regla Fcrjj
and. Guanabacoa Railroad last week.

New York, December 13. Col. Harvey
was seen at his office, No. 3 Nassau
Street, and confirmed the above report.
"I received a cablegram last night," lie
said, "that our proposition had been ac
cepted. We had evcrj- reason to believe
that It would be, as nobody else seemed to
be ready to make an immediate cash offer.
Mr. D. Doull, of Hanson Bros., Montreal,
and the general manager of the Bank of
Nova Scotia, left here for Havana on
Wednesdaj- to complete the transaction,
and Mr. Pearson, formerlj- chief engineer
of the Metropolitan Street Railway Com-panj-.
Is- also en-route for Havan,ato pre

"Who are the principal members of j-our
sjndicate?"
"'Hanson Bros., of Montreal, the Bank of
Nova Scotia,' the Bank of Toron.to,i'and
B. r. Pearson, of Halifax; -Those-chteny
interested in New- York, aside from "Mr.
Pearson "and mjseif, are Jlarry Payne
Whitney, W. K." Rjan and Senator Smith
of New Jersey."
"Is it correct to assume that your syn
dicate is a rival of the American Indies
Companj-?"
"Not at all. Both companies are work
ing harmoniously In the Interest of qu'ck
development of the island? but on different
lines, so that there 13 nh conflict of Inter
ests. I am surprised to iearn that the
Indies Company proposed to bid for the
Ferro Carril, as Iunderstood they did not
Intend to do so. It was probablj' due to .1
misunderstanding on thepart of their Ha

Vienna, Dec. 13. There was an uproari
ous session of tho Rcichsrath today, which
recalled the scenes which preceded Count
Badeni's resignation of the premiership
In November, 1S37. While Dr. Edler von
Ruber, minister of Justice, was answering
Interpellations, Herr Wolf, tho notorious
German member, rushed toward him,
flourishlr-K a copy of the Pan-GcTmanlc
newspaper, tho Ostodcutsche PJundschau,
which Wolf edits and which had been
confiscated by tho government for report
ing an offensive speech. Wolf screamed:
"This confiscation is roguerj- and bru
tality," and his friends followed him in
his denunciations, each of them shaking
or throwing a copj- of the paper la the
minister's face.
Dr. Von Ruber sat unmoved throughout
tho turmoil
Count Thun-Hohensteln, the prime min
ister. proposed that tho remaining an
swers to the Interpellations be slmplj'
written ar.J added to the minutes of the
session. This evoked a storm on the ieft
of tho chamber, w'lero the German pro
gressists sit. They loudlj- protested that
such a course would be a. breach cf the
rules.
One deputy read the extracts for which
the paper was suppressed, and this cre
ated a. general Impression that the
seizure was not Justified.
After a prolonged pandemonium of epi
thets and desk thumping, in which
Wolfs equallj- notorious friend, Herr
Schoener, was conspicuous. President
Tuehs declined to complj with the prime
minister's proposal, declaring that the
answers must be read, but he added tliat
ho never- moro regretted that the rules
of the house conferred upon him no
discipiinarj- powers for dealing with
Wolf.
"It is quite unheard of," he said "that
a deputy of Herr "Wolfs insignificance
should permit himself to degrade parlia
ment In this waj-. I regret that such a
member is protected by immunltj-."
Although a majority of the members
cheered the president, the consensus of
opinion is that the language he employed
toward Wolf was the most rcmarkible
ever heard from the chair. Wolf will
probablj- challenge the president to Pght
a duel.
The whole affair turns on the Jew-baiting"
fever, w'ith which Wolf Is. rabid.
The same eternal judenhelte almost
concurrents led to a like scene in the
Vienna town council, where tho antl
Semltc major. Dr. Lueger, was presiding.
A squabble arose over Dr. Lueger an
nouncing an alteration In the procedure
and an angry altercation took place be
tween the president and Dr. Foerster, a
Liberal member, which resulted in the
major suspending- Dr. Foerster for three
sltttlngs and ordering him to leave the
assemblj-. Dr. Foerster did not budge
and defied 1he mayor,-who, amid a babel
of shouts bj the anti-Semite roajoritj- of
"Turn him out," "Horsewhip him," etc.,
sent ushers to remove the recalcitrant.
Thr ushers seized Dr. Foerster and car
ried him out like a bundle.
Dr. Brix Interceded, whereupon lie was
also suspended.
Dr. MIttler, a distinguished Liberal,
raised his hand in a warning gesture to
ward Dr. Lueger, and this called forth
an order for his suspension. He refus2d
to go and the ushers bundled him out as
they had Dr. Foerster. amid the trluxpV
ant shouts of tho anti-Semites.

Taris, Dec. 13. Tomorrow the respec

the Spaniards depressed by the less of
their last foothold in the New Word,
their own discoverj-, and the annexation

name recalls Spain's greatest period.
It is opportune at this moment to refer
to the hard work of the commissioners
and their courteous behavior toward the

unfaillnglj' treated the newspaper men
with the greatest consideration. In spite
of the fatigue of their onerous duties.
Mr. Ferguson, the able interpreter, is
likewise entitled to the highest, praise.
Though occupying an Invidious position

AN EMBASSY ATTACKED.
The Anrrovv Lrnpo of Sir Julian
Pnuiicrfute'h I'amll).
Joseph W. Pearson caused a furore
shortly before 3 o'clock last night at the
British embassy, at the corner of Con
necticut Avenue and N Street northwest.
The offender is a neatly dressed man,
tvventj--six jears of age and a printer bj
occupation.
Pearson is said to be, ordinarily, quiet
and well behaved. He resides at No. IOCS
I Street northwest. He appeared on the
N Street side of the embassy at S-30
o'clock last night. After pacing up and
down between Connecticut Avenue and
Nineteenth Street for five minutes he
halted In front of the banquet hall, gath
ered an armful of missiles, and, after
carefully looking about 1dm, hurled them
through the large plate glass windows.
The man then repaired to the front of
the residence on Connecticut Avenue. As
the result of his bombardment here, the
handsome storm doors, just within the
porte cochere, were wrecked and the
magnificent plate glass vostibale doors
were shattered. The damage done fa con
servatively estimated at between $600 and
?700.
The noise of the assault attracted a
large crowd. Persons ran hither and
thither, wondering what the trouble wa
about. Those who first arrived saw- Pear
son with all appearance of a lunatic,
wildly hurling stones at tho embassj.
In the meantime the residents of the em
barsy were almost panic-stricken. They
were unable to comprehend the meaning
or character of the fusiilade..
An effort was at once made to notify
the police and it succeeded. BIcjele Po
liceman Burrows, of the Third precinct,
had been attracted bj- the noise. Ho Im
mediately placed Pearson under arrest. A
call was sent In for the police patrol and
the man was "hurried to the station house.
He was at first demonstrative, but soon
subsided.
When Pearson reached tho station he
would offer no explanation for his con
duct. No amount of questioning availed.
In answer to the usual routine questions
Pearson replied in a firm and steadj
volce, but posltlvt-lj- refused to cuvulge
any further information. After persist
ent efforts on tho part of the police to
learn his motives Pearson was locked up
He was apparentlj- sober and at this time
in full possession of his mental faculties.
The case against Pearson is a p;cu lar
one. Were he. taken Into court the
charge that would probably b2 placed
against him would be disonler.j' conJIuc .
One of the singular points of this case
Is that he cannot be charged undo- tve
common law bf the District with the de
struction of privato propert-. Ilia c s;
will probably be brought to the attention
of the State Department. No act'oi w.ll
be taken until tho British ambassador
has olllciallj- notified that department cf
tho occurrence. The police wil have
nothing more to do with tlie cue. except
to hold the man in custody until he is
wanted.
The handsome plate glass floors of the
embassy vestibule can be replaced only
after weeks of waiting and an expendi
ture of hundreds of dollars. The doors
were of an Imported bevel plate, on
which had been inscribed the heraldrj- of
tho embassj'.
That Sir Julian Pauncefote and the
members of his family escaped personal
injury from, the fljlng missiles was al
most miraculous. The ambassador, with
his wife and four daughters, was- com
fortably seated in conversation near tic
windows at which the fus'-liada was di
rected. Several of the stores crashed
through the glass into the, room ani oner
of a large size fell in their very midst.

The funeral of the Hon. Calvin S. Brice
will be hcCd in the Fifth Avenue Presbj--terian
Churrti, New Yoff. Saturdaj- at 1Z
o'clock. .Tie deceased statesman will be
buried at Lima. O , h 3 old home.
Calvin S. Brice was born in Denmark,
O , September 17. 1S3. He was- the wi
of the Rev. W. IC. Brice. a Presbyterian
minister. He entered Mlvml Universltj,
famous for the men It had graduated. In
September, 1S3S, ar.d was a. studious and
energetic worker, a characteristic that
clung to hlra ever since.
A little more than two j-cars after he
began his universitj- course the war broke
out. and joung Calvin, with many other
Northern boys, tired with the spirit' ot
patriotism, laid down hU Latin. Greek
and calculus and took up the knapsack
and the musket. Senator Brice never pa
raded Ks war record, but the fact re
mains that he served his country faith
fully and honorably. Responding earlj- to
the call for voluntecr.s. he enlisted in
April. lc61. in Capt. Hood'd compinj-, made
up of university bojs. which was sent ti
Camp Jackson, Columbjs. In the Autumn
Mr. Brlce, his term of service hav.ng ex
pired, returned to school, but in April,
ISC. rc-enl!sted. this time in Capt. McFar
land's urdverpitj- company. Company A.
Eightj--sixth Regiment. O. V. I., and
served during the Summer of that year
in West Virginia. Again was he mus
tered out of the service, ard returning tc
Oxford he graduated in 155. havmg been
engawd for two jears la altercatelj light
ing for ills country and studying to secure
an education.
Following his graduation. Mr. Bric!
taught school at Lima for three months,
but the Ions continuation of the war tired
the old spirit, and he once more donned
the blue, recruited a company and en
listed for the third time, now as he
captain of Company E. of the One Hun
dred and Eightieth Ohio Volunteers,
which regiment was .1 part of the First
Division, the Twentj--thtrd Army Con's.
In Tennessee, Georgia and tho Carolinas.
until January. 155. When the army was
disbanded Mr. Brice went direct to Ann
Arbor, Mich., where he studied law. and
was subsequentlj- admitted to the bar in
Cincinnati in 1SW. Associating himself
vv ith Mr. James Irv Inc. he formed the law
firm of Irvine & Brice. and began the
practice of his chosen profession in I.l.-n.i,
where he first taught school and re
cruited his company of soldier boj-s.
As a member of this law firm Mr.
Brlce became connected with the legal
department of the old Lake Brie and
Louisville Railroad This was tho begin
ning of the career of Mr. Brice as a. rail
road magnate. As one of the counsel for
the road, lie obtained an insight Into the
actual work of railroading and saw
spread before him the opportunities
vvhicli he subsequentlj- grasped. He be
came interested in the road financhily,
modestly, it is true, but Ids holdings
gradually Increased. Ho saw where
monej- was being lost in the railroad
business, ar.d where It should be made.
Quick of conception and equallj- quirk in
execution, Mr Brlce recognized that the
extension of sj-stems and the opening up
of new- territory would enhance the prop
ertj". This idea developed and resulted, in
the construction of the "Nickel Plato"
railroad, a name given to the road In jest
by Mr. Brice.
Mr. Brlce and the men associated with
him built the road which paralleled the
Lake Shore. The Lake Shore had refused
to make a satisfactory arrangement for
taking- care of the tr-iffic turned over to
It by the Lake F.ilc ':nd Western, and its
refusal led to the building; of this new lina
from Chicago to Buffalo, which it was
compelled to buy to get rid of the danger
ous opposition thit It promised. This
operation opened the eyes of the Eastern
railroad world to Mr. Briee's abliitj-.
In politics Mr. Brice was likewise sin
gularly fortunate, and at the time of his
death he was the ieadirg Democrat In his
native State and a man of national prom-
