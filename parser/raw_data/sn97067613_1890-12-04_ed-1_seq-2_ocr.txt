MORRISVILLE and HYDE PARK.
Thursday. Dec. 4-. 1890.
The new laws will Ik? ready in a
few daya and we shall send a copy to
each subscriber of this paper. They
will be sent out as an extra and our
readers may look for them almost
any day.
The business of the legislature may
be summed up as follows: Intro
duced in the senate 1G2 bills, 61 of
which became laws, and in the house
414, of which 172 went upon the
statute book, makingthe whole num
ber of laws by the general assembly,
233.
The horrible stories of Stanley's
men seem to show that explorers do
not average much better now than
they did in the days of the conquest
of Mexico or Peru. Given the gam
conditions, human nature is about
the same in all countries and all
ages.
The verified census figures show
that Vermont is a trifle larger in
population than she was in 18S0,
and not smaller as at first reported.
The figures as given out by Super
intendent Forter last week show the
population to be 332,422 a gain of
13(i. Vermont more than holds its
own.
The farmers are vowing vengeanee
for the defeat of the agricultural col
lege bill. Brattleboro Reformer.
This is strange. Of the eleven
farmers who voted on the bill in the
Senate, only four voted in its favor.
We hope our farmer readers will
make a note of this and put the
blame where it belongs. Had all or
even half of the farmer Senators
voted with the three manufacturers,
two lawyers and the banker, the bill
would have passed. The farmers
must lay the blame this time to their
own men.
The insinuation of the Hardwick
Gazette that the appointment ot
Hon. P. K. Gleed as Tax Commis
sioner " is a sop thrown to him to rec
oncile him to the loss of that Judge
ship for which he was lobbying for
such a long while," is an insult to one
of the most highly respected citizens
of Vermont. Mr. Gleed is not an of
fice-seeker, a lobbyist or a log-roller.
Had he been a man of this sort per
haps he might have received a Judge
ship. His -eminent fitness (which all
who know him will admit) was the
cause of his name being suggested in
connection with the Judgeship. P.
K. Gleed is too clean a man to be
thus scurrilously assailed.
The President's message was read
in both houses of Congress, Monday,
and again demonstrates the level- j
lieadedness of Benjamin Harrison.
It is replete with suggestions and if
Congress would receive the approval
of the people it will give attention to
many of the suggestions. There is
nothing blind or uncertain in any of
the utterances of the President. The
message has three great features,
wJjicJi are: 1, its firm defence of the
tariff" policy of the Republican party:
2, its exposition of his ideas on reci
procity; 3, and a request, almost
amounting to demand, that the 51st
Congress take up and press through
the important legislation pending
before it.
than ever before, ami there will bo
$30,000,000 a year less sent out of
the country for that commodity.
The reduction of the ore and the pro
cesses of manufacturing will give em
ployment to 40,000 men. One fact
which proves that the mines are
good is the fact that large owners in
the companies are holdingonto their
stock, and there is none of it in the
market."
The United States Senate.
Of the United States Senators who
will retire from office on the fourth of
March, 1891, sixteen are Republicans
and twelve Democrats. The Demo
crats will all be succeeded by men of
the same party, except perhaps Sen
ator Vance of North Carolina, whose
successor may come from the Farm
ers' Alliance faction. Ten of the six
teen Republicans are pretty sure to
have Republican successors. As to
the six remaining, Senator Spooner
of Wisconsin must give way to a
Democrat; Ingalls of Kansas must
retire to private life, and Democrats
will fill the seats now occupied by
Evarts of New York and Farwell of
Illinois. The Farmers' Alliance has
carried South Dakota, Governor and
legislature, and will elect a United
States Senator in place of Gideon C.
Moody another Republican loss.
The present Senate has 47 Republi
cans and 37 Democrats. Idaho and
Wyoming will add four more to the
Republican strength, which would be
fifty-one after the fourth of March,
were it not for the losses in New York,
Illinois, Kansas, AVisconsin and South
Dakota, reducing the total of Repub
licans in the Senate to 46, or one
more than they had at the beginning
ot the t ltty-nrst Congress the count
then standing, Republicans, 43: Dem
ocrats!, 37. Leaving out New HaOfp-
shire, the IVmoL-rats wul, in uli prob
ability, have 40 Senators in the new
Congress, and there will be two Sena
tors chosen by the Farmers' Alliance
to supersede Republicans, reducing
the Republican majority to four,
which will be further diminished to
two if the New Hampshire legislature
should turn out Democratic and elect
a Senator of that persuasion to suc
ceed Mr. 151air.
The newspaper publishers have
just reason to be thankful for the in
crease in pay allowed them for print
ing the supplements containing the
newly enacted laws. The public may
think this. " a raid on the treasury,"
but investigation will show that the
price heretofore paid for the work
was outrageously low so low that
many of the publishers had stated
that if it was not raised they "would
not issue the supplements this year.
After having the matter explained
in detail to them by R.J. Humphrey,
the legislature saw the unfairness
and readily allowed an increase, for
which, of course, the newspaper
fraternity is very thankful. The
press are under obligations to Bro.
Humphrey in securing the increase,
and he has doubtless received many
personal thanks from publishers ere
this. Mr. Humphrey proved an effi
cient and able member of the leerisla
ture in many winra, and the town of
Poultney was well represented by
the editor of the Toultney Journal
at the late session.
Presention to the State.
Among the various presentations
during the closing hours of the legis
lature was the gift to the state of an
elegantly framed life size portrait of
the late Gen. I. H. Sheridan, finished
in crayon from a rare photograph
furnished by Mrs. Sheridan. The pic
ture is pronounced by competent
judges to be a meritorious work of
art, and as such it is eminently fit
ting that it should grace the walls of
our capital. The purchase was made
of Gen. S. M. Southard of Brandon.
Anions the donors were Frederick
Billings, Franklin Fairbanks, C. S.
Page, J. Gregorv Smith, A. B. Val
entine. R. J. Kimball, W. S. Webb,
Henry A. Fletcher, F. D. Proctor,
Warren Gibbs, H. R. Start. J. M.
Tyler, A. Ropes, L. H. Thompson, etc.
Senator Evarts as a Farmer.
Senator Evarts told a Washington
reporter recent! v that theologv, as a
profession, had no attractions for
him when he left college in 1837.
Medicine," he adds, "was such a
grewsome business that I could not
bring myself to consider it seriously
as a life vocation, although it prom
ised wealth and honors. 1 was very
favorably impressed with the life of a
farmer. In fact, throughout all my
life I have had a passion for farming,
and I now own two large farms one
in Vermont of 1000 acres, and one in
Maryland, on the Potomac, of about
the same number of acres. But when
at the time I speak of I tried to lift a
barrel of apples into a wagon as a
test of my physical strength and
found that I was not equal to the
task I turned m.y attention to tiro
law, which I have followed for over
50 years with more or less success. I
think now that if I were standing
where I was 53 years ago and jour
nalism was what it now is I should
choose as the business of my life that
of a journalist. I can see in it great
er possibilities than are embraced in
other professions."
The Tin Plate Industry.
There will be tin plate industries in
America whether the Democrats want
them or not. At Springfield, Illinois,
within the past week, the Secretary
of Stat licensed the Chicago Tin
Plate Company to manufacture tin
plates, sheet steel, sheet iron, steel
ingots, steel bars and terne plates;
capital stock f 250,000; incorpora
tors, Richard J. Ress, George C.
Manchester and S. W. Snow. The
Democratic campaign story that
there is no tin ore in the Black Hills
is vigorously disputed by James
Haft, of Rapid City, Idaho, an ex
pert, who has returned from that re
gion, bringing with him rich speci
mens. "Here is a specimen," said he,
" that is about 50 per cent. tin. Here
are others that average 10 ier cent.,
which is pretty good, when you
know that the tin ores of Cornwall
run about 1 to 1 per cent. Most of
the tin mines of the Dakotas are near
Harney's Peak. The work of open
ing up the large beds of ore has been
going on for three years, and many
people wonder why no tin has been
mined. The work is slow, in the first
place, taking from two to four years;
but the main reason why there has
not been an output of ore is that
two big Companies want to get con
trol of all the good claims in sight.
The English capitalists have sent
over experts to moke the most care
ful examinations, and have satisfied
themselves that there is plenty of
good mineral. The English own
nearly 30 per cent, of the liest claims.
A great deal of the development is
due to James ilson, of New York,
who organized the Harney Peak
Mining Company. It took two years
of prospecting to strike the Czar
ledge, one of the company's most
valuable properties.
"The mining of tin is bound to be
come a great industry, and when the
'mines Ix'gin to be worked the tariff
on tin will cut no figure. Tin cups
and tinware are going to be cheaper
"Snap" Advertising; Schemes.
There is probably no branch of
business so little understood by busi
ness men generally, and there is cer
tainly nothing so essential to success
in any mercantile or manufacturing
enterprise as advertising. The most
successful men in both advertise in
newspapers; and no one who has any
foresight or experience would think
of not using newspapers first, and
other mediums only as an adjunct.
No held is so thoroughly worked
and so much ingenuity displayed to
induce people to invest money as in
these numerous schemes which are
generally of but little benefit and of
ten worthless. Thousands of dollars
are annually expended in this way
and people will patronize them, pay
ing exorbitant prices for some tran
sient benefit; people who would re
fuse to pay the same money for a
standing advertisement in a local
newspaper.
This class of people is the first to
complain bitterly when outside par
ties who understand their business
open in their midst and take away
their patrons by liberal newspaper
advertising. They censure the news
papers because they carry these ad
vertisements for strangers, and they
seem to forget that the press has any
power until it is demonstrated to
their disadvantage, when they invoke
its influence to correct the very evils
they are directly responsible for.
Nothing delights wide-awake, ener
getic advertisers so much as to get
into a locality where those in busi
ness are too penurious or indifferent
to make use of the newspapers, and
when they do there is both profit and
amusement in store for them.
There is no safeguard like a local
newspaper, nothing can do more to
keep up a town an(l help business;
and merchants, above all, should
give them the preference. Yet fre
quently the only return the newspa
pers get for their enterprise is depre
ciation from those whom they have
benefitted both directly and indirect
ly. As long as this is the case, news
papers will be prone to welcome new
comers in the field, even if their visits
are brief. Harrisburgh (Pa.) Call.
Lamoille County Court.
The December Term of the Lamoille
County Court opened on Tuesday at
Hyde Park with Judge Loveland
Munson presiding, assisted by the
Associate Justices, J.A.Andrews and
S. R. Miller. Smith B. Wnite, in his
usual and familiar way, officiated at
the clerk's desk, while Miss K. E.
Benham of Burlington reported the
proceedings of the court. Joel W.
Page, Jr., did the honors of the
State's Attorney's office as though he
had been accustomed thereto, and we
predict he will meet the full expecta
tion of the people in the performance
of his duties. The familiar voice of
MiloS. Burnell was again heard from
the Sheriff's stand iu the opening of
the court.
The proceedings were opened with
an earnest prayer by Rev. E. J. AVard,
whose effective appeal for divine as
sistance and direction ought to in
duce those whose business leads them
into court to labor for justice and
right. The Grand Jurors, all answer
ing to their names, were sworn in by
the clerk and very ably charged by
the Court, who laid particular stress
on the duty of the jury regarding vio
lations of the liquor law. Algier
Jones of Wolcott was then appointed
foreman.
The Petit Jurors were then called
and answered to their names. The
charge thereto was brief, but suffi
ciently direct to enable them to dis
charge their several duties.
Among the familiarattorneys pres
ent were the Hon. Geo. Wilkins, Hon.
II. H. Powers, Hon. AY. 11. H. Bing
ham, Hon. P. K. Gleed, Hon. Geo. AY.
Hendee, Col. Sawyer and AA Brig
ham, Esq., who are regarded as lead
ing members of the bar in length of
service and ability. 1 hose from out

B. Stewart, Col. 11. F.Brigham, Bak
ersfield ; Geo. W. Kennedy of AVater
bury; and T. J.Boynton, Montpelier.
At the opening of the afternoon
session J. B. Slavton of Stowe was
excused from serving on the Grand
Jury, and the Sheriff selected II. A.
Waterman. 0. S. Chaffee was also
selected in place of J as. Brown.
Of the five cases on the jury calen
dar only those of T. J. Baker aplt. v.
Joseph Jacobs and AY. S. Newcomb v.
O. & A. H. Buck, is there any possi
bility of trial. These two cases were
assigned for AVednesday morning.
The old law and chancery dockets
were called and a few of the many
cases were left for hearing by the
court. The time spent in the after
noon was devoted to calling the at
tention of court to some minor mat
ters and at three o'clock the court
adjourned to AVednesday morning,
with indications of a brief term.
The officers assigned to the charge
of the grand jury are deputies Ray
more and 11. L. Stevens. II. M. Cor
nell is clerk ot that body. Messrs.
Lanpher, Butts and Potter have
charge of the petit jurors.
Sheriff Burnell has appointed the
follow imr deputies : T. M. Potter, Jas.
Parker, Waterville; D. C. Hardy. E.

Johnson; J. T. Stevens, Eden; II. C.
Lanpher, Hvde Park; H. L. Stevens,

The court room in its new dress
presents a very handsome appear
ance. Newly papered and painted
throughout it attracted much atten
tion and received many complimen
tary remarks from the bar anil pub
lic. Authorized by the Judtres to
have the work done well and as rea
sonable as possible the County Clerk
may well feel satisfied with the result.

TAL MAGE AND HIS BANJO.
Why His Neighbors in Brooklyn Miss Him
When Ho Takes His Vacation.
The Rev. Dr. Talmage is sadly missed
by his neighbors in Brooklyn in more
ways than one. So if it is a "pleasant
thing to be missed" the popular preach
er probably has plenty of pleasure.
Everybody knows that the doctor is
fond of music, but they are unaware
that he can expertly play the banjo.
Yet it is true.
Before he departed on his vacation
he pretty regularly made the early
evfenings melodious with the mel
low "pink-a-punk, pank-a-punk, pank-pank-pank,
thrum-m-m" of his favorite
musical instrument as he sat in the
bask parlor of his residence on South
Oxford street. The windows were
usually open, and the touching strains
of some old time melody floated out
upon the air.

the summer, when he lived at the Sol
diers' Home, he would take his frugal
breakfast and ride into town in time
to be at his desk at 8 o'clock. He
began to receive visits nominally at
10 o'clock, but long before that hour
struck the doors were besieged by
anxious crowds, through whom the
people of importance, senators aud
members of Congress, elbowed their
way alter the fashion which still sur
vives. On days when the Cabinet
met, Tuesdays and Fridays, the hour
of noon closed the interview of the
morning. On other days it was the
President's custom, nt about that
hour, to order the doors to be opened
and all who were waiting to be ad
mitted. At luncheon time he had lit
erally to run the gauntlet through
the crowds who filled the corridors
between his office and the rooms at
the west end of the houseoccupied by
the family. The afternoon wore
away in much the same manner as
the morning; late in the day he usu
ally drove out for an hours airing
it 0 o'clock he dined. He was one of
the most abstemious of men; the
pleasures of the table had few attrac
tions for him. His breakfast w-as an
egg and a cup of coffee; at luncheon
he rarelv took more than a biscuit
and a glass of milk, a plate of fruit in
its season; at dinner heat? sparingly
ot one or two courses. He drank lit
tie or no wine; not that he remained
always on principle a total abstainer.

the fervor of the " Washingtonian
reform; but he never cared for wine
or liipiors of any sort, and never used
tobacco. Lol. John Hay in iSovem

- clung to his post at an open window
and kept up a steady, ear rasping blare.
People in the vicinity closed their
windows with a vicious ,:bang!" but
still be kept up the fusilade of mutilat
ed and discordant notes. There seemed
to be no relief from the infliction until
a happy idea struck a man across the
street. lie opened a window, and with
an energy born only of despair bawled
out:
"Fish! Fish! Fish! Nice, fresh
fish !"
The cornet player did not at first
seem to understand the meaning of the
cry, for after a brief cessation of tor
ture he resumed bis work. But the
cry was repeated, this time louder than
before, and the young man stopped,
closed bis window and went away, and
his cornet has not since been beard. If

Press Comments on the Legislature.
The legislature, upon the whole,
with the senate as a balance wheel,
did well, and probably made as few
mistakes as any of its predecessors.
St. Albans Messenger.
The great struggle of the session
came upon the agricultural college
bill, and it. is that which left the air
tainted with the breath of gross
scandal. Rutland Herald.
The work of the A'ermont legisla
ture is a disgrace to any New Eng
land commonwealth. Hard wick Ga
zette. The legislature did the most prac
tical thing of the season in the inter
ests of economy, when it adjourned
on AVednesday. Ludlow Tribune.
Reform with a very little " r" will
size up the work of the present legis
lature. Its work is worse than that
done by its predecessor of 1S8S. in
creditable though it may seem.
Richford Gazette.
The legislature's record is one of
barrenness in nearly every worthy j
sense. Except for the Australian
ballot law there cannot be said to be
a single great-measure "which it has
intelligently handled. Brattleboro
Reformer.
AA'e won't condemn, nor find fault.
Honest, earnest men have occupied
both chambers this session and their
work will be judged by its results,
later, with less passion and more jus-
lice man can oe expected now, so
soon after the sessions closed.
Springfield Reporter.
The things done which are of leading
importance are the passage of the
Australian ballot law, the' new cor
poration tax law, and a new school
law. The list of tilings not done is
much longer. At its head stands the
failure to establish a new agricultur
al college in regard to the merits of
which there will be a wide difference
of opinion. A new college, which
would really meet the needs of the
farmers and attract their sous as
students, would be of undoubted
merit and value, but the sella to
where the project met its defeat, evi
dently believed that this work oimht
to be done at Burlington, and that a
new institution would involve an ex
pense to the state which ought not
to be assumed. fPhii'iiix.

our membership, lherearevct several hun
