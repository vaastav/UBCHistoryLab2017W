Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dee. S.— This city seems
to be on the eve of a convulsion
that. If brought to the issue
sought by the promoters, cannot
but result in violent disorder, in
volving murder, arson and rapine.
At the extra session of the State Leg
islature held at Springfield last winter
a law known as the Allen law was
passed, giving Common Councils of
cities power to grant to street railway
companies franchises running fifty
years, providing mutual agreement re
garding compensation could be reached.
Inder this law local traction compa
nies caused, at the last meeting of the
Council, to be introduced an ordinance
extending franchises to the limit and
offering what they deemed to be a fair
compensation. This has brought on a
storm of denunciatory disapproval from
the Tribune, Times-Herald, Record,
News and Post. While the law was
pending in the Legislature the papers
named protested vigorously against its
passage and denounced Senators and
Representatives who voted for it and
the Governor who signed it in terms of
unmeasured violence.
Mayor Harrison, whose private secre- j
tary was formerly an editorial writer I
on the Times-Herald, is opposed to
the passage of the ordinance, and in an
Interview Tuesday said he wanted 150.
000 men to surround the City Hall next
Monday night and, if the ordinance
was approved, to wreak summary ven
geance tipon the Aldermen voting in
favor of the measure.
This interview was published by the
papers named and each had an editorial
commending the Mayor and urging the
carrying out of his plan. This has been
kept up since till the minds of the great

Incidentally, during the trial. It came
out that the first- Mrs. Wittmeier, since
the divorce which separated her from
her first husband, had assumed the bonds
of matrimony with five other men. Her
appearance at the trial, a hard faced,
wrinkled, loud mouthed harridan, with an
unenviable record, and a red wig. the lat
ter considerably ton small for her, did
not a little to damage her son's cause. It
was vain for George's lawyers to argue
that the heartless conduct of Wittmeier
had been the first cause of the trans
formation which had occurred since the
days that she only stole time from her
washtub sufficient to visit his bedside and
nurse him back to health and strength.
The verdict of the Jury was against the
son. who has always been, under all cir
cumstances, the Idol of his mother's ex
istence. She heard the decision silently
and left the courtroom as one dazed. On
the corner she stood for a few minutes in
utter silence. Then she raised her head
and looked at the little group which had
followed her.
"She got my husband away from me."
Bhe said, "and now she has got my son's
money away from him. Let her be happy

She said the same thing in Oakland,
with a wild force of gesture and a light in
her eyes that struck terror to the timid
hearted who listened to her. And she said
the same thing to Magdelena herself once
when she met her by accident on Pacific
street one day, when shn had come across
the bay to visit a friend.
And, queerly enough, from the day the
verdict was rendered which cut the only

mass of newspaper readers have be
come inflamed. Mass meetings were
held In various parts of the city to
night and addresses delivered that have
added fuel to the flames. Men are
walking the streets wearing minature
hangman's nooses, as advised by the
newspapers, and warning the Aldermen
who believe the pending ordinance to
be a good one and who have signified
their intention of voting for Iv.
The Inter-Ocean cautions the people
to be slow to take the advice of its
contemporaries and in an editorial to
morrow morniug will call attention to
the fact that the anarchists who were
hanged as a sequel to the Haymarket
riots of 1886 were not hanged for actual
participation in the riots, but for incit
ing to /nurder by inflammatory editori
als in newspapers with which all of the
men hanged were connected.
So great is the interest in the ques
tion that the citizens have divided into
two great camps. Mass-meetings are
largely attended and personal encount
ers between partisans are of frequent
occurrence.
The traction people say rather than
have the city turned over to the mob
they will refuse to allow the ordinance
to be put upon its passage upon the
date now set and will hold mass meet
ings at which the questions involved
may be debated quietly, with the hope
of overcoming the exposition and de
feating the ends of the newspapers now
urging the lynching of Aldermen and
the holders of street car stock*
Unless a positive statement Is made
by Monday morning at the latest that
the ordinance will not be presented that
night, and If the present incendiary
agitation is kept up, a mot) — two mobs,
in fact — will certainly gather and blood
will surely flow. As one step to prevent
this it is being urged that the editors
of the papers publishing the incendiary
articles be arrested and tried under the
act under which the anarchists were
arrested, tried and convicted.

out with troubles with which she had not
the ability to cope, she gave up the strug
gle. The prayer that Bertha Bockman
had offered day and night for close on
to two years was answered.
"I have always triumphed over my en
emies. Let Magdalena Wittmeier not live
to enjoy the wealth that belongs to my
boy!"
That was her invocation up to the day
she disappeared from Oakland. And there
is a prospect that the money she believed
was rightfully her son's will yet fall to
him, for George Wittmeier yesterday stat
ed that so far as he knew Magdalena left
no near relatives and he intended to make
another fight in the courts for the prop
erty his father had left bequeathed to her.
JOINT COMMISSION
MAY PROBE SCANDALS
Senator Vest Introduces a Resolution
Providing for a War Inves-
tigation.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S.— Senator Vest
to-day introduced in the Senate a resolu
tion providing for the appointment of a
joint commission to investigate the
charges of corruption in the conduct of
the war with Spain.
The preamble to the resolution recites
that "charges have been made through
the press of the country over the signa
! tures of responsible parties that corrupt
I and improper means have been used to
i secure contracts from the Government for
the purchase of vessels for the navy and
for the furnishing of clothing and other
I necessary articles for the army of the
United States during the war with Spain
! at excessive and exorbitant rates."
L The resolution calls for the appointment
| of three Senators and five members of the
House and imposes upon them the duty
of "Inquiring as to the truth of all such
charges and to make report by bill or
otherwise."
The Senators are to he appointed by the
Chairman of the Senate, and the mem
bers of the House by the Speaker of the
House.
APPROVE THE NEW CHARTER.
Citizens of Vallejo Vote in Favor of
Proposed Reforms.
VALLEJO, Dec. S— The election he*re to
day on the adoption of the new freehold
ers' charter resulted In 658 for the char
ter and 170 against it. Only one-fourth of
the vote was polled. Vallejo has virtually
been without a charter, working under
the general laws. The new charter Is not
radical in its changes from the old, nor
does It in any way attack local Interests.
The new charter makes a small increase
in the list of salaried officers, gives the
city a Mayor with authority which prop
erly belongs to such officer, a unifomed
police, whose continuance in office will de
pend on efficiency alone, a Superintendent
of Water Works, who will devote his
whole time to the duties of his office, a
Board of Health with power to enforce
its orders and a Board of Public Works to
look after the city Investments. It pro
vides safeguards against extravagance,
and the duties of the officers as defined In
sure great improvements in the city gov
ernment. The only material change In
the government of public schools was the
doing away with a salaried Superintend
ent, and making heads of families only
eligible as members of the Board of Edu
cation.
After passing to the Legislature the
charter takes effect in 1901.
ATTORNEYS SUE FEANCEE.
New Phase in the Salinas Mayoralty
Contest.
SALINAS, Dec. B.— A new and lnterest-
I ing phase of the Mayoralty contest de- \
j veloped this afternoon, when Renlson &
Jones, attorneys, filed an attachment for
the sum of $1055 against Charles Francee,
now seated as Mayor, pending the dcci- j
■tea of the Supreme Court. The suit is
for legal services rendered during several
trials, transcribing testimony, printing
briefs, costs and other incidentals. The i
Sheriff .took possession this evening of the
furniture-store of Francee, who furnished
bonds shortly afterward. The attachment ,
and suit are the result of a quarrel be- ;
tween the parties over matters recently '
before the City Council, and It is believed i
; that when the case comes to trial some '
i spicy and very interesting details as to :
■ the Mayoralty contest last March and
. subsequent proceedings will be exploited.
SOCIALIST ELECTED MAYOR.
HAVERILL, Mass., Dec. B. —An
avowed disciple of social democracy will
on January 2 be inaugurated Mayor of
this city, being, so far as known, the first
socialist to be elected to an administra
tive office in the country.
By the municipal election on Monday
John C. Chase, aged 28 years, a clerk in
a co-operative grocery-store, was elected
Mayor, as the candidate of the Social De
mocracy, by a plurality of 350 votes in a
field of six candidates. With him on the
victorious ticket were three socialist can
didates for Aldermen and three for Coun
cilmen.
. THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1893.
TWO HUNDRED CASES OF SMALLPOX AT BEDFORD.
HUNTINGDON, Pa., Dec. B.— Among Bedford's population of 2800 there
are about 200 cases of what is said to be genuine smallpox. This
alarming condition of affairs was discovered yesterday, and up to
that time there continued an uninterrupted commingling of the citi
zens of the town. The disease prevails from one end of the town to
the other. The Bedford physicians disagree, some pronouncing it to be
chicken-pox and others a harmless skin disease. Dr. Atkinson, State Health
Inspector, says it is genuine smallpox. Men, women and children, he de
clares, with smallpox crusts on their bodies and faces, have been traveling
the streets day and night and visiting from house to house, unconscious of
the true nature of their affliction. The whole town is now closely quaran
tined, policed and guarded and vigorous measures will be prosecuted to
check the plague. The danger to the whole central part of the State i 3
manifest, as the people of Bedford, while infected with the disease, have
been traveling far and near.
George Martin, a member of Company A, Fifth Regiment, of Hunting
don, who is afflicted with smallpox, contracted the disease While playing
football in Bedford from an opposing Bedford player, who at the time
showed the crusts of smallpox on his face.
PECULIAR FINANCIAL SITUATION IN CUBA.
HAVANA, Dec. 7 (via Key West, Dec. 8). — Serious problems confront
the last days of Spain's sovereignty in Cuba. One of the most delicate
and difficult of solution is the question of the return of bonds given by
civil officials and employes who now cease to hold office. Many of
these are cash bonds furnished years ago, the refunding of which
now becomes imperative. All such moneys having en appropriated and
spent, the Government is unable to meet these obligations or to fulfill the
guarantees.
The settlement of the arrears of pay due the mobilized and all the
regular troops offered a brilliant opportunity for masterly i.'rancierinK on
the part of the military intetidant. With money in hand for the full settle
ment of all pay due the troops, the quartermaster general devised an ingeni
ous plan. Paying the men off in notes payable in Madrid, he otrered, through
trusted agents, to discount such notes at 20 or 30 per cent for cash. As
practically every one of the irreeular and mobilized troops will remain on
the island, the men eagerly embraced this opportunity to have their notes
cashed, and a handsome profit therefore accrued to the astute originator of
the scheme.
SHARKEY AND M'COY SIGN ARTICLES.
NEW YORK, Dec, S.— Articles of agreement for a twenty-round boxing
contest between Tom Sharkey and Kid McCoy, to take place at the
Lenox Athletic Club, this city, January 10, were signed to-day by both
principals. The men are to box for a purse of $20,000 and 50 per cent
of all receipts exceeding $40,000. Tim Hurst was mutually chosen as
referee.
In order that the fight may not result in a fiasco like the Sharkey- Corbett
affair, the articles provide that the interference of any fighter's seconds or
their invasion of the ring will not stop the contest. A second or outsider who
tries to enter the ring during the contest will be immediately placed under
arrest.
The men will box under Queensberry rules, with the exception that they
will not be permitted to hit in clinches or breakaways.
After the match had been made Sharkey held a friendly conference with
Jim Corbett, who wished him luck in the fight and announced his intention
of going to the Pacific Coast to fight Jeffries. Corbett afterward sent a
dispatch to his brother in California, saying: "I' will take on Jeffries.
Match me to meet him in February."
WOMEN WORKING HARD TO SHUT OUT ROBERTS.
NEW YORK, Dec. B.— The efforts to prevent Brigham H. Roberts, Rep
resentative-elect from Utah, from taking his seat in the Fifty-sixth
Congress because he is a polygamlst and advocates the doctrine of
the Mormon church is to have the organized support of hundreds of
thousands of women in the United States. The initial woman's move
ment is to take an organized form in this city at a meeting of the Presby
terian Woman's Board of Home Missions on December 20. There are a hun
dred thousand members of the Presbyterian Home Mission Society alone in
the United States. The Home Mission Societies of Congregational and Bap
tist churches are preparing to make a similar campaign against Rob
erts and women's societies of other denominations are becoming interested
in the fight. The women are to give information regarding Roberts' case
and the supposed danger of a revival of polygamy and to unite in obtain
ing personal letters to Representatives in all districts throughout the coun
try protesting against the seating of an avowed polygamist.
ROMANTIC TALE OF AN ALLEGED DUKE.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8. — A dispatch to the World from Ixmdon says:
The Johannesburg correspondent of the Mail telegraphs:
"A remarkable story was told to-day during the hearing of a charge
of fraud against Charles Gunn. A statement was put in by the pris
oner In which he declared that he was the brother of the late Duke
of Hamilton, and had left England after fighting a duel. For private rea
sons his death was formally announced and a sham funeral took place.
"Gunn asserts that Robinson of Rotherwellbaugh filled a coffin, which
was sent to Hamilton palace and nlaced in a mausoleum, and says if the
coffin is opened and examined his statement can be verified."
The late Duke of Hamilton died May 16, 1895, leaving no son, and was suc
ceeded by his kinsman, Alfred Douglas Hamilton.
The late Duke's only brother was Charles George Archibald. It is re
corded in Burkes Peerage that Charles was born May 18, 1847, and died
childless in May, 1886. If Charles can prove that he is alive he may get the
dukedom and vast wealth.
DAYLIGHT ROBBERY OF A CAPITALIST'S HOME. \ i
MILL VALLEY, Dec. B.— While Ebenezer Wormuth, the capitalist,
was absent in Sausalito this afternoon, his residence in East Mill
Valley was entered by robbers and looted of everything of value that
could be carried away.
The robbery occurred in broad daylight and yet was so cleverly
planned and executed that not a clew to the identity of the miscreants
has been discovered.
Though Wormuth refuses to state the amount, it is a matter of com
mon belief that the thieves secured several thousand dollars in coin, as the
capitalist is known to have kept a large sum of money concealed on the
premises. _* — - ,
"ANOTHER INSULT" TO THE FRENCH ARMY-
PARIS Dec 8 —The Court of Cassation this afternoon ordered a stay of
proceedings in the Picquart court-martial. Several of the newspapers
here assert that the court has examined the secret documents in the

court, which they describe as another insult to the army.

Representative Loud has Introduced
a bill amending "An Act in Relation to

thereof the following: "Provided, how

or packages, encasing not less than two
tins, said packages or cases, or packages
encasing tins, to be of not less capacity
than ten gallons, wine measure, to be fill
ed with distilled spirits from receiving
cisterns in such manner as said Commis
sioner may, by regulation, prescribe for
the purpose of exportation from the
United States. And there shall be charged
for each of Bald packages or cases for
the expense of providing and affixing
stamps five cents, instead of ten cents as
now required by law."
The hill Is limited to export, and, there
fore, in no way conflicts with the spirit
distilling interests of the country. The
size of the package is in keeping with
the law and regulations of the department
and does not increase bureau labor. The
charge for export stamps is not designed
by Congress to realize revenue, but to
assist the export and shipping trade.

Or THE GREA T WA TER WA Y.
Sijecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. B.— The 'Wash

ald says: President McKlnley is
in favor of opening negotiations
with Great Britain for the pur
pose of modifying the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty so as to permit the construction
and control of the Nicaragua canal by
the United States.
Should Congress during the present
session fail to enact the pending Mor
gan bill the President also favors en
tering into negotiations with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica looking to the construc

and control of the United States. On
the authority of a high official of the
administration I am able to state there
is absolutely no foundation for the re
port tha.t Great Britain, through Sir
Julian Pauncefote, has protested to the
State Department against that feature
of the President's message dealing with
the canal question.
On the contrary the authorities have
every reason to believe that Great Brit
ain will consent to any reasonable mod
ification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
that the President may desire, so as to
remove obstacles which it places in the
way of the control of the canal by this
Government. So satisfied are the offi

in an agreement especially intended to
CHECKS HASTE IN
PENSION BILLS
Vest Calls a Halt in the
Senate.
MAKES DEMAND FOR QUORUM
PAST DELICACY TO OBJECTIONS
REMOVED.
Regards Payment to Veterans a Sac
red Duty, but Seeks to Secure
All Proper Consideration
t of Measures.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.— ln connec
tion with the consideration of bills on
the pension calendar, in the Senate to
day, Vest of Missouri said:
"I do not want to be captious about
this pension business and do not want
to set myself «•» as a reformer, but this
thing of passing a lot of pension bills
simply by the reading of the titles, and
when a quorum of the Senate is not
present, has got to be stopped."
After further referring to the meth
ods by which pension bills are passed
by the Senate, Vest said:
"Men of the South have permitted
these bills to be passed, having some
delicacy about entering objections to
the course of procedure. Recent events
have obliterated sectionalism and we
are united. We can, therefore, come
here and object to this spoliation— and I
use the word advisedly— without fear
of having our motives impugned or our
words misconstrued.
"We are payin 0 " out in round figures
$141,000,000 annually for -fusions, and it
is our duty to find out why It is that
thirty-three years after the cloße of the
Civil War this thing of pension claims
shows so enormous a sum. I have been
criticised by some of my people because
I have not taken a more determined
stand on this pension question. I want,
however, to pay munificently and liber
ally in pensions. I regard such pay
i ment as a sacred duty, but I do object
to the passage of these bills without
proper consideration and with the same
restrictions that are hedged about
other measures."
Qallinger of New Hampshire, as
chairman of the Pension Committee,
agreed with Vest in his desire to have
the pension bills carefully considered.
He thought a quorum of the Senate
ought to be in attendance when the
pension calendar was considered.
The anti-scalping bill passed yester
day by the House was received and. at
I the request of Cullom, chairman of the
! Committee on Interstate Commerce,
was laid on the table instead of beinc
referred to the committee. A similar
bill has already been reported by the
Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce.
A considerable number of pension bills
had been passed before the Senators,
one or two at a time, began to leave
I the chamber. Finally true to his warn
! ing, Vest raised the point of no
i quorum. Forty-eight Senators re
sponded to their names and considera
tion of the pension bills was resumed.
At the expiration of the one hour al
! lotted to the consideration of the pen
sion calendar, twenty-six bills had been
passed.
At 11:50 o'clock the Senate west into
executive session. At 2:15 the Senate
resumed business in open session.
Morgan called up the Nicaragua
canal bill, with a view to making it the
unfinished business. He moved that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of
the bill.
Pettlgrew moved to adjourn. De
feated, 13 ayes, 42 noes.
Morgan's motion to proceed with the
consideration of the Nicaragua canal
bill was then carried, and after the bill
he.d been laid before the Senate, thus
becoming the unfinished business, the
Senate, on motion of Morgan, at 2:25
p. mi., adjourned until Monday.
Gallagher Given the Decision.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. B.— Billy Gal

Trimble of this city fought fifteen rounds

struct and control the proposed water
way.
It seems to be pretty generally under
stood that the conflict of interests over
the construction of the Nicaragua canal
will prevent action during this session
on the Morgan bill, and in this event
there is reason to believe that when
President Iglesias of Costa Rica re
turns to Washington the latter part of
the winter he will discuss with Presi
dent McKinley and Secretary Hay the
advisability of entering into a treaty
for the construction of the canal by
this Government. Iglesias is in favor
of such action and so Informed the au
thorities while here. But nothing can
be done by the authorities on this line
until the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is
modified.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.— ln the Sen

Resolved, That it is the sense of the
Senate of the United States that the

INTERNAL REVENUE DECISIONS
Thomas Will Not Arrest for Serving
Wine in Pitchers.
The following recent decisions have been
issued regarding internal revenue taxa
tion and the special war tax:
Merchants do not bring themselves within the
definition of bankers in the Hrst paragraph of
section 7 of the act of June 17, 18»#, by reason
of selling their own drafts to thejr customers'
they are not on this account required to pay '<
special tax as bankers.
An unstamped package of cigars cannot be
repacked in another box made expressly for
it. The stamps on an outer box will not pro
tect the Inner box, neither can a stamped box
be contained in an unstamped outer box.
The office will not approve of dummy pack
ages for the purpose of advertising cigars
Cigar packages having a less or greater num
ber of cigars packed therein than the number
denoted by the stamp will be forfeited.
In reply to a letter of inquiry which you have
addressed to this office as to whether you "can
make and sell blackberry wine without spec
ial United States Internal Revenue license "
you are hereby advised that you cannot do bo
unless the wine is made by you from blackber
rie« of your own growing or gathered wild by
yourself or by persons in your employ, and un
less this wine is sold by you only at the place
of manufacture, or at but one "general office"
(Section 3246, Revised Statutes). If this or any
other wine is put up In bottles for sale, tax
must be paid thereon under the following pro
visions of schedule B of the act of June 13,
189S (war revenue act): "Sparkling or other
wines, when bottled for sale, upon each bottle
containing one pint or less, ie; upon each bot
tle containing more than one pint, 2c."
A fair or entertainment given by a fraternal
organiiatiun (even though the public pay for
admission) Is held not to be such an exhi
bition or show as is contemplated by the eighth
paragraph of section 2 of the act of June 13,
1898, If the proceeds are to be> devoted to "sick
benefits" or to other like subjects, and sqpcial
tax is not required to be paid therefor under
this act.
A draft or order drawn on the treasurer of
such an organization by another of its offi
cers for the payment of money to a third per
son whether "for payment of bills or for "sick
benefits,' " as you state, or for any other pur
pose requires a 2c stamp under schedule A of
this act.
An entertainment riven by a grange of the
Patrons of Husbandry, such as a "harvest
home festival" or the like, is not regarded as
such a public exhibition or show for money
as the statute contemplates and special tax is
not required to be paid therefor.
Jugs, pitchers, etc., used In serving wine in :
restaurants and elsewhere for the purpose of '
evadinp the war tax stamps will be considered
as bottles and must be stamped as such. But a '
saloon-keeper selling wine by the glass in al
lowed to draw it from the ca*k into bottles for
that purpose without stamping the bottle.
Special Revenue Agent Bert M. Thomas i
said yesterday that he would not arrest !
any restaurant keeper for serving wine '
in unstamped pitchers. He is of the opin
ion that the courts will not decide that
a pitcher is a bottle.
DESERTED HIS FIANCEE.
Capitalist Frank 7. Capitain Sued for
Breach of Promise.
Frank J. Capitain. a well-known busi
ness man and capitalist of Los Angeles,
was made defendant in a breach of prom
ise suit filed in the office of the County
Clerk Tuesday afternoon. The plaintiff
in the action is Miss Nellie Wallace, ]
daughter of Mrs. Martha R. Edwards,
who resides at 622 Post street.
In her complaint Miss Wallace avers
that she became engaged to Mr. Capitain.
who is her senior by almost a score of
years, last Christmas day. They were to
have been married on the 12th of last
April. The wedding was postponed, how
ever, and the groom to be, as Miss Wal
lace supposed, was called from the city
on business. While absent he daily
penned his fiancee messages of love. His
ardor began to cool by degrees, how
ever, and at last the day came when he
spurned his love and broke the engragre
ment. Miss Wallace now seeks to sooth*
her outraged feelings by recovering a
judgment for $50,000 against the capital
ist. Capitain, who has been long and fa
vorably known in business circles, is salt!
to be exceedingly wealthy. He was born
in Frankfort in 1846.
Consul for Peru.
President McKinley has recognized
Senor Don Carlos Estenos as Consul for
Peru at this port.
