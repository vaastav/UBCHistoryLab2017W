Showing the course of hot and cold air in an Art Gar­
land stove will, we think, interest the people of Worth
ington at this season of the year.
I
'L
FLOOR
You will notice in the cut shown herewith the hot air pipe is in the cen­
ter of the stove and is heated from all sides. That is wnere we get our
wonderfullyjstrong circulation of hot air. If you will take the trouble to
examine a similar cut of any other stove you will find that the hot air blast
flue is on the back of the stove and is heated from one side only. That not
only reduces the strength of hot air circulation but.it takes away 20 per
cent of the outside radiating surface of the stove.
Study the above over carefully and you will understand why an Art
Garland base heater can heat as much surface with two tons of coal as any
other make with three tons. A Garland costs no more than you can buy an
imitation for and you can save $10 in fuel in a single season.

The increased price of the raw ma
torial does not enhance the price of
clothing in a similiar latio. Wool
now worth fifteen cents .and shrink­
ing sixty per cent, is taken as the ba*
silof these calculations, and may
very fairly considered as a represent­
ative or average qualitiy. A suit of
clothes requiring for its manufacture
seven pounds scoured or 171-2
pounds in the grease weuld be unus­
ually heavy but the additional out­
lay for the wool necessary to make
this suit would be only $1 more at
present than under the Free-Trade
conditions of last Cyear.
It is readily seen, therefore, that
under present Tariff conditions the
wool grower reaps a decided benefit,
while the consumer is not seriously
inconvenienced by the difference in
in the price of his clothing. These
figures regarding the price of cloth­
ing are based upon the supposition
that clothing has advanced in price,
but other factors have been at work,
and the fact is it may be purchased
as cheaply now as under the former
Tariff.—Wool Cecord.
Congressman McCleary seems
to have mortally offended the edi
tors of the Worthington ADVANCE
and Mountain Lake View, both re
publicon papers. And all on ac­
count of post office appointments.
Without question Mr. McCleary
tries to do right in the distribution
of patronage but he has a hard
job on his hands. Up to the pre­
sent time he has been fortunate in
satisfying almost everyone in the
securing of appointments. It now
begins to look, however, as the riv­
er that flows on the greatness will
be full of snags, and if he would
avoid shipwreck he better hold
hard on the helm.—St. James Ga­
zette.
Look here, Brother Nicholson,
havn't you tumbled to the fact
that the right which has dominat­
ed in the post office appointments
in a good many towns, is the same
kind that can turn the greatest
number of votes to Mr. McCleary
when he comes up for re-election?
If you have not we would refer you
to the people of Fairmont, Worth
ington, Pipestone, etc., towns of
considerable importance. We give
Mr. McCleary credit for being one
of the "cutest" politicians in this
section, and whatever the county
bosses, who favor McCleary, say,
goes, in the matter of post office
appointments,without much regard
to other people. You may get
taste of it before you are through
Windom will.—Windom Citizen,
We said a few weeks ago that,
"the man who receives the repub­
lican nomination for governor of
Minnesota next year should be a
man of clean personal character
with an official record and connec­
tion that need not be apologized
for, and be a man who is able to go
out and lead the fight We have
done enough carrying the candi­
date about cn a pedestal to be
looked at and apologized for."
Mr. Weaver hardly sizes up to
this standard. We do not know
that there can be very much said
against his personal character or
business honesty. Neither do we
know that he has ever filled any
position that would bring out his
executive ability and prove his
fitness for the position of governor
of the great Btate of Minnesota. It
is true if he would show good
judgment in the selection of a pri­
vate secretary the business might
rnn along all right, as it has done
before. But we do not want to
elect a man governor who has got
to depend on his private secretary
to fill the governor's chair. Mr.
Weaver may possess the ability,we
do not know,he has not been tried,
but there is a great deal of differ­
ence between making sale contracts
for threshing machines and being
the chief executive of this great
commonwealth.
Besides Mr. Weaver is too close­
ly connected with the Clough ma­
chine and one thing the people are
going to insist on above all others
is that the last bit
at
that old
wk
chine shall be cleaned out. Mr.
Weaver was going about the state
two years ago fixing things for
Governor Clough's nomination.
We know to a certainty that he was
here for that purpose, and it is be­
lieved an understanding was had
at thattime that he should be their
candidate in 1898.
Why is it that the authorative
announeement of Mr. Weaver's
candidacy should come from Lu
verne and Sleepy Eye simultan­
eously and not through the papers
of his own county,except that he
has no support at home. We would
be glad to see a man from the Sec­
ond district elected governor if we
have a man that is a candidate who
will be a credit to the district and
state, but we are not going to sup­
port a man stmply because he lives
in the second district.
As to the candidate being able
to go ont and lead the fight. We
never heard of Mr. Weaver mak­
ing a speech or trying to, and we
believe the Republicans of this
state are done carrying a candi­
date around sitting him upon a
platform with a placard upon his
storage department, reading'."This
is the Sepublican candidate for
Governor."
We can't make location every­
thing in the selection of a candi­
date for so important a position.
With such a man as ,Evans, Col­
lins,
Clapp, Eustis or YanSant, we
cocld go before the people with
some show of strength in the can­
didate himself.—Madelia Messen­
ger.

Washington Letter.
(From Onr Regular Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 10,1897.
The most astounding thing
brought to light by the first week
of the session of Congress is the
audacity of the agents of the lob­
by which is trying to prevent the
annexation of Hawaii. It is only
necessary for a senator or repre­
sentative of prominence to express
in private conversation the slight
est douot of the wisdom of annex­
ation to have these agents an­
nounce through such newspapers
as they control or can by hook or
crook obtain space in cash is un­
questionably paid in some in­
stances—that the senator or repre­
sentative in question is straining
every nerve to defeat annexation.
They have thus misrepresented
Senator Morrill and Hoar and
Speaker Reed. It seems as cer­
tain as anything can be that such
audacity is in the end bound to re­
act upon those who employ it, and
to result in making more votes for
annexation than against ii. This
lobby was started by the sugar
trust, but there are reasons for be
lieving that a portion of the mon­
ey it is spending so liberally
comes from the secret funds of
three foreign nations which desire
to prevent annexation, but have
no reasonable excuse for attempt­
ing to do so openly. Some of the
democratic senators who talk the
loudest against trusts, during a
campaign, are acting in concert
with the sugar trust now. In fact
with two exceptions, Gorman and
Morgan, all the democratic sena­
tors appear to have landed, bag
and baggage, in the lobbist's camp.
Senator Davis, of Minn., chairman
of the committee on foreign rela­
tions, which has charge of the
treaty, is thoroughly confident
that annexation will be accomplish
ed through the treaty, and abso
lutely certain that a bill providing
for annexation can be passed by
both Senate and House,should the
power of the lobby be sufficient to
prevent the ratification of the fcrea
ty. It is his intention to push the
matter to a conclusion in the Sen
ate at the earliest possible mo­
ment.
Senator Chandler, chairman of
the committee on elections and
privileges, says that committee
will decide upon its report in the
Oregon case at its next meeting
and that he has no doubt the re­
port will be in favor of seating
Hon. H. W. Corbett, as successor
to Hon. J. H. Mitchell, whose
term in the Senate expired last
March. If the democrats who
have expressed themselves in fav­
or of seating Mr. Corbett vote
that way he will be seated.
The House committee on appro­
priations broke the record when it
reported the pension approprition
bill to the House this week, thus
furnishing evidence that Chairman
Cannon and the industrious mem­
bers of his committee intend to do
their part towards pushing the lm
perative business of the sesson, in
order to help the project for early
adjournment, which is generaly
favored by the republicans. The
Pension bill carries $141,218,830,
of which $140,000,000 is for the
payment of pensions.
It has already been made ap­
parent that a serious attempt is
wing to be made atthis session of
Congress to modify the civil ser­
•*r-—
vice rules. President McKinley
having said in his annual message
that he believed many, positions
were now embraced by the civil
service rules which ought not to be
republicans in Congress do not feel
that they are antagonizing himor
tho party platform in taking part
in this movement, although so
good a republican as Representa
tive Johnson, of Indiana, has told
them in a speech made in reply to
Gen. Grovsner, of Ohio, that he
disagreed with them. Gen. Grovs
nor's idea, which he will endeavor
to get through in the shape of a
bill,is that the only employes of
the government who should be em
braced by the civil service rules
are the clerks whose duties are not
executive, in the departments at
and employes of the postal service
in all its branches. All other po­
sitions he desires to have thrown
open and the democrats' who new
fill nine-tenths of them thrown
out to make room for the republi­
cans.
PresidentMcKinley's being de­
tained at Canton by his sad duty
has not in any manner inconven­
ienced Congress, as he arranged
all matters requiring his personal
attention before starting upon his
last trip to the bedside of his dy­
ing mother. Everywhere his name
is mentioned the deepest sympa­
thy is expressed for him.
The committee ou banking and
curreney has obtained permission
from the House to sit daily during
sessions of the House, and will at
once endeavor to agree upon one or
more bills embodying portions of
the financial recommendations
made by the president in his an­
nual message and by Secretary
Gage in his annual report to Con­
gress. Secretary Gage has been
asked to put his ideaS into a bill
and submit it to the committee.
The conservative men in Con­
gress, regardless of party, approve
of the position President McKin­
ley took in his message, on Cuban
affairs, and the matter will be left
in his hands.
