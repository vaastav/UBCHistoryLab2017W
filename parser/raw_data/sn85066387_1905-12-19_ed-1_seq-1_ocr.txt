USES BANK DEPOSITS
IN PRIVATE DEALS.
Three Chicago financial in
stitutions, believed to have
been among the strongest
in the Middle West, have
been wrecked by the op
erations of John R. Walsh,
by whom they were con
trolled. Walsh used the
funds on deposit to further
private enterprises. The
Chicago Clearing - house
banks have guaranteed that
no patrons of the closed
concerns shall lose a dollar.

CHICAGO, Dec. 18. — Three of the
largest financial institutions in the
West, the Chicago National Bank, the
Home Savings Bank and the; Equitable
Trust Coiapanjs,<ali_of tfa«n- controlled
hf John R. Walsh of this city, and In
a great measure owned by him, sus
pended operations to-day. Their af
fairs -will be liquidated as rapidly as
possible and they will go out of busi
ness.
Welsh, who was the president of the
Chicago National Bank and of the
Equitable Trust Company, and all the
other officers and all the directors of
the Chicago National Bank have re
fcigned. National Bank Examiner C. H.
Bo s> worth has succeeded Walsh at the
head of the Chicago National Bank, and
the places of the directors have been
liMed by men appointed by the Chicago
Clearing-house.
Back of the new management stand
the allied banks of Chicago, which have
pledged their resources that every de
positor shall be paid to the last cent,
und that no customer of any one of the
three institutions shall lose anything
by reason of the suspension.
Hat 1 , not this action been taken by
the banks of the city a disastrous panic
most have followed in the" financial
•world. As it was the only effect in this
city was the decline on the local Stock
3-:.\chang-e of 2»£ in the price of Na
tional Biscuit common stock, which has
employed the Equitable Trust as trans
fer agent, and. besides, had dealings
vith the Chicago National Bank, but is
not affected by the failure in the slight
est degree. The closing of the two
banks had the effect, also, of shutting
off all demand on the local exchange
for bank stocks, none of them being
purchased.
BA.VKS' FCXDS LOANED TO WALSH.
The immediate cause .of the collapse
of the institutions controlled by Walsh
is sale to have been the large amount
of money which they have loaned to
various private enterprises of his
notably the Southern Indiana Railway
end the Bedford Quarries Company of
Indiana. Walsh claims that if he could
have had a little more time and been
left untrameled in his -operations he
could have teavcVhis banks and made
ciiormous profits far himself and his
£*>.soclates. He bases this statement on
Ins estimate of the value of the bonds
of the Southern Indiana Railroad Com
pany. The Comptroller, the State Audi
tor and the members of the Chicago
Clearing-house Committee place the
value of the bonds at one-half the
valuation of Walsh, and it was their
refusal to accept his valuation that
caused the suspension of the banks.
The liabilities .of the three Institu
tions are estimated in the aggregate at
52d.00U.000. Against this amount the
banks and the trust company have re
sources that, on a conservative esti
mate, are worth $16,000,000. Then there
arc the bonds of the Southern Indiana
Railway Company, estimated by Walsh
as being worth $16,000,000. They are
considered by the Comptroller, the
State Auditor and the Clearing-house
Committee to be worth a little > more
tliau half that, sum. Their value is a
rratter to be determined in the future,
and the presidents of the local banks
admit that, if the estimate of Walsh be
vfound to be correct, the two banks and
ttie trust company will not only pay
all of their debts,, but leave a surplus
besides. The directors of the two banks
and Walsh, -who has turned over all of
liis private property, as well as that
standing In the name of Mrs. Walsh,
have pledged real estate and securities
valued at $5,000,000, and. estimating
the railroad bonds at $8,000,000 more,
there is a total of $29,000,000 assets,
against $26,000,000 liabilities.

This was the striking statement made
by Dr.* Albert rE. Winship, editor, of the
New England rjournal of Education ' of

in . educational . circles throughout" the
country. The J statement was a part jof
his lecture up*6n "Twentieth .Century

"Every is noted for some
particular thing,'; "said he. "The nine

and though I am 'not a prophet, nor the
son of a prophetess, as a Yankee' l may
be allowed k guess that the twentieth

little attention as compared with that
given; to his estimate of the leading men
of the country. ,
: Asked after the lecture for an addi

expressed all he could say! in the words
quoted. He. added' that : posterity will
