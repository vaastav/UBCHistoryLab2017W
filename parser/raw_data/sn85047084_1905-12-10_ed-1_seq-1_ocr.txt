PORTUGUESE ARE FREE TO

Nevertheless the Home Government Will Not
Encourage Emigration to Foreign Lands

The following circular is translated
from the local Portuguese journal, O
Xiuso:
CONSULATE GENERAL, OF
PORTUGAL..
Honolulu, Dec. 4. 1905.
The Consul General of Portugal
hereby declares that His Majes
ty's government only favors the
emigrations from our country to
national possessions and by no
manner whatever to foreign coun
tries. We desire to make well known
to the public that the Consulate
shall maintain itself indifferent
- to all projects for Portuguese em
igration, that we see discussed by
the rress.
A. de S. CANAVARRO.
Consul General of Portugal.
Consul General Canavarro, who was
seen last evening about the above cir
cular said:
"The translation of the circular is
correct. 1 thought necessary, on ac
count of incorrect ideas that some
persons have spread, to define the at
titude of the home government in mat
ters of emigration and at the same
time the attitude of the consulate. It
is an absolute, settled policy of Portu
gal not to encourage the emigration of
its people to foreign countries. Our
great colonial possessions need all our
"surplus population. These possessions
are in Atrica. j?toiii -view
the government favors and assists
materially, by grants of land and sea
passage, the settlement of its own out
ivintr territories. Nevertheless Portu
guese citizens are free to emigrate to
any country, after complying with po
lice regulations as to passports, etc.
My circular defines the policy of the
government and the policy of the con
sulate as its interpreter. It was drawn
out principally by letters of inquiry from
Portuguese of these islands who had
been misled by printed articles which
made them believe that the consulate
had something to do with immigra
tion." Consul Canavarro was asked what ne
thought were the possibilities of get
ting men from the Azores and Madeira.
He said :
"These emigrations having been stop
ped for so many years, I do not know
what is the real situation of the peo
ple in those islands. The news which
some Portuguese bring from there is
very contradictory. Some say people
will be willing to come and some say
not. but really they don't know much
about it."
"If the planters send for laborers in
Portuguese territory, will the govern
ment be likely to put obstacles in their
way?" was the Advertisers next ques
tion. "In answer to this question," said
the Consul General. "I must simply re
peat what I have said about Portu
4 guese citizens being absolutely free to
' come and go as they please subject on
ly to the usual regulations."

OCEANIC S, S, COS
NDIGHAHT PROTEST
Indignant over treatment of its pas
sengers arriving at this port (San Fran
cisco) from Australia, the Oceanic
Steamship Company has addressed a
strong note of protest to Immigration
Commissioner North. The document
contains the following paragraph:
"The treatment of our passengers in
many instances (by your inspectors)
has been in violation of law; our pa
trons have been insulted without cause;
they have been held for days when they
were clearly entitled to land; they have
been asked Insolent and Impertinent
questions; they have been caused to
suffer for lack of ordinary clothing, be
cause they were unable to come on
shore and purchase it. Your dock offi
cers have no more right to intimidate
our passengers than the passengers
have to resent an insult at the point of
a dangerous weapon. I would ask you
to imagine what your heart would feel
were you to tell some one that Mrs.
X'orth was vour wife, and thereupon
you should be asked. "Are you married
tn hr?" Would you repent the insult.'
I would. We are injured by the man-
npr nf vour inspectors, passengers are
being driven away from us by reason
of the reputation of the manner ot your
examination, and the reputation Is
known from Old England around the
world. This statement is verified by
letters now in our possession."

tion to this abii?" mnnv time5' in th?

BIG FRUIT C

COMING
Two Experienced Fruit Packers From San
Franciso Here Arranging Preliminaries
Capacity of 200,000Cases.
A fruit cannery employing two hundred persons and having a capacity of
200,000 cases a year will probably soon be added to the industrial establishments
of Honolulu..
This is a prospective enterprise of the Hawaiian Pineapple Co. which has
every appearance of shortly coming to a head. The company now operates a
cannery on its plantation at "Wahiawa, but has strong business incentives for
removing that 1 ranch of its operations into town.
Yesterday evening an Advertiser reporter ran across a group of four men
at the Hawaiian hotel connected with the scheme. They were James D. Dole,
president of the Hawaiian Pineapple Co.; Joseph H. Hunt and A. C. Baumgart
ner, representing-Hunt Brothers & Co. of San Francisco, and L. E. Arnold of
Wahiawa. Hunt Brothers & Co. have been interested in the local company
mentioned for several years. They are the largest fruit packers in California.
Messrs. Hunt and Baumgartner arrived in the Sierra week before last on Busi
ness especially related to the projected
Mr. Dole referred the reporter, said:
"Yes, it is our intention to establish a cannery in Honolulu. "With rail
road communication it will be more economical to have the manufacturing
branch located in the city, and now that work has begun on the railroad we are
making preparations to remove the cannery to Honolulu. A site for the build
ings has not yet been secured.
"If the preliminary arrangements can not be made in time to build this
year, the scheme may be delayed over one season. This would not inconvenience
us very much, as the cannery at Wahiawa is capable of handling all the fruit
at present available.
"The cannery here will have much greater capacity than the one at
Wahiawa. It will be capable of turning out 200.000 cases a year, or about
5,000,000 cans of fruit. Our firm in San Francisco has an output of 8,000,000
cans. The Honolulu factory will be equipped with the latest improvements in
machinery. Yes. it will manufacture its own tins on the premises.
"Employment will be given to about two hundred persons in the factory
when fully under way. At Wmhiawa. the plantation and cannery labor is mostly
Japanese, but I suppose Portuguese will take the work lareelv in town. To a
considerable extent the labor is suitable
deal of steam is consumed in a cannery, as it is needed for cooking the fruit
as well as running the machinery.
"I consider there is a great opening for a large fruit packing business here.
This ought to be one of the greatest pineapple countries in the world. The
planters here are thoroughly well up in their business. With the packing branch
under experienced control and in expert hands, the two divisions of the industry
can be harmoniously and successfully worked.
"While our company has 1300 acres of land for cultivation, the cannery
will be capable of expansion so as to take care of all the fruit that other
growers may contribute.
"Mr. Dole will probably be able
project within a few days."
r.ast. but it seemed to do no good. Now
that the steamship company has taken
un th matter, perhaps the outrages
will cense. The Oceanic people are not
in the business to lose moeny, and they
will certainlv make a strong fight to
bring about a reform.
The first thing to demand should be
the removal of the brutal Irish in
