ENORMOUS LOSS BY WATER
Union Pacific Line Between Roch
ester and Cosmopolis Ruined
by Floods.
Hoquiam—The entire line of the
Grays Harbor & Puget Sound,
Union Pacific Railway Company,
from Rochester to Cosmopolis, will
have to be rebuilt and work is to
begin at once, it is impossible to
estimate the amount of damage done,
but the figures will easily reach
$250,000. In addition to the road
bed, grading and bridges being a
total loss, three locomotives, two
large steam shovels and a number
of dump cars and tools for 500 men
lie at the bottom of the Chehalis
river and cannot be recovered until
the water goes down.
Near Independence creek, on the
Chehalis river, two locomotives and
two steam shovels are somewhere
in the bed of the- river. All of the
tools used in construction have been
lost and probably wilfrifTiot be re
covered.
Bellingham—The loss to the rail
ways by the recent floods will ex
ceed $1,000,000. Whatcom county
loses $100,000 in bridges alone. Five
miles of Northern Pacific track in
this , county have disappeared, even
the grade being obliterated. Line
men reconstructing the telegraph
lines followed the rTgfif of way by
the ditches.
Peculation Made Good.
Seattle—The United - States Dis
trict Court today ordered claims
against the* George Edward Adams
fund paid upon propf made to the
clerk of the court. Adams was for
unore than eight years cashier of
the United States Assay Office here
and used to levy toll on all bags
of gold dust turned into the office
by miners. He was convicted of
embezzlement. sentenced to ten
years in the Federal prison and all
his property was taken by the
Government after a civil suit. Adams
is estimated to have stolen $175,000
from the miners, but claims for only
$60,000 were filed. These claims
will be paid and also the cost of
prosecution from the $75,000 obtain
ed by sale of Adams' property. Two
lots in this city are left to Adams
after the settlement.
Aberdeen—Because of the existing
low prices of lumber and the general
poor condition of the market on the
Pacific Coast, it is stated on good
authority, that owners on Grays
Harbor have agreed to close all the
mills for 30 days, beginning Decem
ber 24.
Walla Walla—Arrangements are
being madt for the biggest celebra
tion ever hold at Whitman college
February 16, the occasion being its

died on the same date, February if.
Lumbermen to Build Line.
Chchalis—Articles of incorporation
have been ti led by the Pe Ell &
Columbia River Railway company.
The company proposes to run an
electric or steam railroad from Pe
Ell southerly to tap the Columbia
river near Cathlamet, with ware
houses. telegraph and telegraph
lines, etc.
One of the primary objects of
this company, in all probability, is
to find an outlet on the Columbia
River for the output of their mills,
which are now located on the South
Bend branch line. The millmen on
the branch have always had more
or less difficulty with the railroad
company in the matter of securing
plenty of cars and getting their
product to the markets as they de
sired.
Merry School War Agitates Dayton.
Dayton—Because two students at
the High School were insubordinate
and mischievous, as is alleged, the
superintendent of the public schools,
L. V. Beaulieu, suspended them.
This brought on a storm, and in the
stress of censure from the school
board, the superintendent resigned.
Then the entire corps of teachers
also quit in sympathy with its su
perior. The striking teachers were
summoned before the board and the
whole affair was gone over. Finally
the teachers admitted they had been
a trifle hasty. They said they be
lieved the board was condoning in
subordination on the p.»rt of the
students.
Prof. Reed Is In Serious Trouble.
North Yakima—Professor David
C. Reed. superintendent of the
North Yakima schools, is charged
in an action begun in the superior
court by Lydia .McMillan Reed, the
widow of his brother, the late Sen
ator \\ alrer J. Reed, with having
wrongfully converted thousands of
.dollars' worth of the property of
the late senator to his own use.

plaint. It is also alleged that there
are other transfers and transactions
of a wrongful character.

SCURVY AMONG STARVING
I. W. W. PRISONERS
Spokane, Dec. s—Disease resembl
ing scurvy has broken out among
I. W; W. prisoners confined in the
old Franklin school building. It
is believed to be the result of lack
of vegetatble food. The gums of
three men have turned dark blue
and their teeth are so loose they
can scarcely keep them in their
sockets.
The police have reduced rations
in the effort to starve the revolu
tionists into submission to the anti
street speaking ordinance.
The Franklin school building is
declared to be in a frightfully un
sanitary condition. It has not been
scrubbed since the prisoners were
taken there.
THE TAFT POLICIES
An Outline of the Recommendations
of the President to Congress in
His Annual Message.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The program
placed before congress by President
Taft in his annual message is the
most extensive and ambitious ever
proposed by a chief executive. It
even dwarfs the recommendations
made by Roosevelt. Ten main poli
cies are urged by the president, be
sides a list of minor items covering
routine matters and questions of
secondary importance. They are:
Supervision of the issue of stocks
and bonds by interstate corporations.
Readjustment of the duties and
powers of the interstate commerce
commission.
Expansion of the duties of the
bureau of corporations.
Creation of a new bureau in the
department of justice to deal with
violations of law by interstate car
riers.
Establishment of a so-called "rail
road court."
Amendment of the Sherman anti
trust law.
Creation of a postal savings bank.
Ship subsidies.
Amendment of the procedure re
garding the granting of injunctions.
Conservation of natural resources.
One of the minor policies favored
by the president is the consolidation
into a national health bureau of all
instruments for the investigation,
prevention and cure of disease,
which are now included in the na
tional government or may properly
be included.
Would Control Stocks.
The recommendation for the con
trol of the issue of stocks and bonds
by corporations is aimed at the
evil popularly known as stock water
ing, while those for the expansion
of the duties of the bureau of cor
porations and the creation of a new
bureau in the department of justice
to deal with violations of the anti
trust, anti-rebate and railroad laws
suggest closer inspection and con
trol of interstate- corporations.
Those for the readjustment of the
duties and powers of the interstate
commerce commission, the creation
of a railroad court and the amend
ment of the Sherman anti-trust law,
$ire partially in line with Roosevelt's
plans and partially to the initiative
of President Taft himself. The work
ings of the railroad rate law have
not been entirely satisfactory in
practice, and this proposed legisla
tion is for the purpose of remedying
the defects in the act.
President Taft would divide the
executive and judicial functions of
the commission, giving the last
named to a court proper.
ONE KILLED, SEVEN HURT
Party of 13 Coasters Hurled into
Telephone Pole.
Portland, Dec. ' 6.—While dashing
wildly down a steep hill, a bobsled
carrying 13 young Portland pleasure
seekers careened from the beaten
path and crashed into a telephone
pole. The blow dashed one of the
occupants of the six coasters to
death, another, it is expected, will
not survive and others are injured.
Zelaya Seeks an Investigation.
Managua, Dec. s.—President Ze
laya has asked the United States
to send a commission to Nicaragua
to investigate conditions existing
here, and says that if its findings
show that his administration is det
rimental to Central America he will
resign. President Zelaya believes
the information sent to the United
States regarding cruelties practiced
by his government is prejudiced.
To Reduce Homestead Residence.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Senator Bo
rah will introduce a bill reducing the
homestead residence period on gov
ernment irrigation projects to three
years; a bill providing for aiding in
the development of towns on gov
ernment projects and a bill author
izing a $200,000 public building at
Twin Falls, Idaho.
