Tho President'* Message.
"It is a motion for a new trial," said
Congressman Allen of Mississippi, in
speaking of President Harrison's mes
sage, "but I think it will be overruled."
Forty years ago the Delaware Gazette ,
in reviewing the farewell message of the
last Whig President, Millard Fillmore,
said: "But, as this message is but the
representatiou of the dying remnant
of a destroyed party, it will'not be
worth while to expend much time upon
it, as it will fall without influence and
weight to the ground."
Whether the Republican party i
not destined to share the fate of its po
litical precursor, whose impending doom
so accurately foreshadowed by the
Gazette in tho words we have quoted,
wc are quite confident that the judgment
therein expressed of the farewell
sago of President Fillmore will prove
equally applicable to tho farewell
sago of President Harrison.
Wo are sorry thnt the President has
addressed Congress and tho American
people in the strain ho has chosen. Wo
sorry that he has made his disap
pointment and chagrin so obstrusive.
Critically considered, it is neither digni
fied in himself
,
,
President,
cour
teous to tho country at large. It is say
ing, in effect, to a large plurality of the
' American people:
wrong; I am wise and you f
ish; 1 havo tried to make y
and happy in my way, but you have de
termined to be wretched and miserable
in your own wav; 1
not know any better and hope you will
not suffer any more than enough to
show you how foolish you
wise 1 am; I
with you, but you can't blame me; at the
same time permit mo t«j remark that you
a pack of deluded fools and will not
deserve much sympathy when all sorts
of misfortune and doleful things befall
you, and remember that l told you so,
and since you have decided to go to
destruction I wash my hands of further
responsibility."
We do
right and you
fool
prosperous
sorry you do
and how
very much dissatisfied
wish, however, to discuss
this message in this spirit. We prefer
to take into consideration tho private
sorrows as well as tho public disap
pointment with which President Harri
son has been distracted and not to hold
him to the fullest accountability for his
last public utterance.
But what must we say, even making
for these considerations,
of the spectacle, as a contemporary ex
presses it, "of a rejected President send
ing recommendatii
due allow;
to a rejected Con
gress at variance with the commands of
the people recently expressed at the
polls V"
Ex-Governor Henry M. Hoyt of Penn
sylvania, who died Thursday is praised
by the Philadelphia Ledger as a success
ful teacher and lawyer, a brave soldier
i a worthy chief magistrate, but
will be remembered chiefly for his bold
declaration of independence of the
po.itical machine in 1882, to which
trumpet-like call to tho Independents
is attributed tho first election of Patti
governor of tho stato. It was
not in the nature of things that Gover
nor Hoyt should gain anything {person

The Eftftville, Va., Herald is the
nearest paper to Hog Island, where
President-elect Cleveland has hoe
rusticating and shooting ducks. For
this reason wo have awaited this week's
issue of the Herald with some curiosity
to see how it would deal with tho
sojourn of Mr. Cleveland in its baili
wick. We find its sentiments expressed
briefly in its editorial columns. It takes
the sensible position that tho President
elect came down there to get away from
business and botheration and to have a
quiet season of rest and recreation and
that he ought to be permitted to enjoy
himself in his own way without inter
ference. Therefore, the Eastville Herald
t
says :
Believing that Mr. Cleveland has sought
Hog Island in order to seek notch needed
repose, we have kept away from this dis
tinguished visitor to our county, and that
little paradise where ho is installed. But

reporters of great city duiltes,chased him in

him prematurely old. Our
