Sunerintendent S F Judy of the Texas
and Pacific was seen at the Union depot
lastTiight and it was learned from him
that the company is just about up with its
most pressing orders for cars but it
is expected that 1000 more
carloads of cattle will be shipped over
that road before there will be any slack
ening Wheh afrked if there would be
any let up soon in the shipments Captain
Judy said that as he came in from Big
Springs yesterday he could see nothing
all along the road from the
car window but the backs of
cattle waiting shipment There has not
been near so much rain at Big Springs bb
there has been at Fort Worth and the
weather has been so warm that the stock
have not begun to feel the winter
A few more facts about sorghum rais
ing for cattle were gleaned by a reporter
jesterday from stockmen of Fort Worth
who have tried it When the cane is to
be used for feeding it is sown broadcast
like wheat or oats and Is usually cut just
before it ripens The only precaution
necessary to prevent its spoiling through
the winter i3 to allow it to lie on the
ground three or four days until it is per
fectly dry4 then it can be stacked It is
not so good if it is allowed to thoroughly
xlpen before cutting as it becomes
woody1 and tough It is just as nutric
ious if cut a little preen and is liked bet
ter by the etock The assertion was made
by ope stockman that it was unhealthy
but others disputed this saying any
grain is unhealthy if fed in too large
quantities And that overfeeding sor
ghum is the onlv means by which it can
be made injurious

Mr A C Wilmeth of Scurry county was
spoken to yesterday about the condition
of stockmen along the Texas and Pacific
The range he said west of Taylor county
is good The snow which fell west of
Sweetwater did no damage to the grass
as it dried oft half an hour after
it fell The stock is all in good
fix The two questions troubling the
stockmen now he says are the low
prices and tne scarcity of cars on the rail
road The matter of prices has less ter
rors for them since the firmness of the
Cnicago markets set in a week ago and
they do not expect them to fall
back sgain As evidencing
the faith western people
have in better markets next year Mr
Wilmeth says some of the4 well fixed peo
ple are paying Chicago prices for cattle
on the range to those who are compelled
to sell with the intention of holding them
till spring As to the scarcity of
cars he says the railroad is
650 cars behind orders at Colorado City
One cattle company two weeks ago
turned loose 1000 bead from a station
where they had taken them to ship see
ing there was no chance of getting the
cars in reasonable time
Mr A P Moore manager of the Rio
Cattle Company of Fisher county was
seen at the Mansion House last night
He had been at Albany when Mathews
Reynolds made their first shipment from
there in the street stable cars and was
favorably impressed with the value
of those cars in the future
shipping trade They are divided
into three sections he explained
so that different kinds of stock can be
carried in the same car but in separate
compartments The facilities furnished
for watering en route will be of great
value in hot weather and as feeding can
be done on the cars the steps between
Texas and Chicago will be fewer and
shorter for all the cattle will have to
stop for will be to rest and one unload
ing on the trip will be enough
The street stable cars stand in the same
relation to the old style that Pullman
palace cars do to the ordinary passenger
coaches
The stock and range of the Rio Com
pany are In firstrate condition The only
thins troubling the western stockmen
now is the scarcity of cars to ship by as
there are a great many beeves and feeders
being held awaiting the pleasure of the
railroads Mr Moore goes to Chicago
tonight
Mr W H Fasch who has been en
gaged in all branches of the stock raising
business in West Texas for the past ten
years was at the Mansion house yester

The San Antonio correspondent of the
Tex + s Live Stock Journal says the latest
start in the way of Texas refrigeration is
at Fnlton a little town on Aransas Bay
He says at that point ten or twelve years
ago were erected large slaughtersg
houses for taking the hide and tallow
from the thousandsof cattle that over
stocked the millions of teres of open
lands of Southwest Texas Subse
quently a better market for them
was found in the northern drive
and the establishments were closed
Soon after one of them was remodeled
for a cannery by a Boston firm and run
for several years but the cattle boom put
prices above profitable canning and the
establishment was again closed Addi
tions must be made for refrigerating
and then it will be in proper shape In
location it has superior advantages
Mr Burke Burnett arrived back In the
city yesterday from a trip to his ranches
in the Panhandle and the Nation
where he had gone to see what had
been the effect of the late rains
on his range He found everything in
good condition up to this time but is not
Ijisp certain of the continuance of these
of the
as are a great many
PanfiaBdle stockmen whose opinions have
been secured The grass as yet has not
been damaged to any great extent and
the cattle are in good condition and have
drifted but very little When asked how
the outlook of the markets appeared to
him he declined to say anything as he
considered it a matter too doubtful to
form any opinion upon He says
stockmen on the Fort Worth and
Denver road are in as bad or
worse condition in the matter of ship
ping facilities as are those along the Texas
and Pacific Ed Est he says held a
large drove of cattle at the road for
twelve days through the late cold and
wet weather waiting for cars
Mr R H Porter of Abilene manager
of the St Louis Cattle Company was in
the citv last night Mr Porter speaks
favoraoly of the condition of
cattle and range in his neigh
borhood He says the only thing
stockmen have to kick about out there is
the low prices to be had for their beeves
and this he thinks will be remedied in a
short time Losses in the northwest the
selling out of cattle of all kind3 by str ck
men all over the country the number of
cows that have been spayed during the
last year or two and the small number of
cattle being fed this winter owing to the
scarcity of feed will create a scarcity of
marketable stock nex year that will
bring about a firmer market Mr Porter
has been raising a great deal of sorghum
and millet for feeding and although his
crop was rather light this year
owing to there being no fall
rain in time to do any good
he has found sorghum grow
ing successful and remunerative
He does not think the present rains will
do any harm in the west to stock proper
ty unless it turns cold immediately after
Mr George Wilcox of Seven Rivers N
M was in the city yesterday looking for
horses He does not speak very favor
ably of the condition of the range
and cattle there In the course
of cinversation Mr Wilcox ex
pressed surprise at the large num
ber of small stock owners from Texas
who were pouring into New Mexico He
ventured to say tna within two days after
quarantine was raised November 110000
head of stock had passed over into
that territory from Texas He did
not know how they were
going to pull through out there In the
winter the crass is very good and the
weather generally veryjfavorable to stock
interests but when spring comes the
only grazing land is along the banks of
the rivers and streams and there
were already all the cattle
in the Territory that the grass
on those limited ranges would suppirt
Most of the people going there from West
Texas are farming stockmen with from
fifty to 200 head of stock They calculate
to raise hay and feed for the cattle but
Mr Wilcox is at a loss to see where they
are going to settle to carry out those planB
in New Mex co
on cattle feeding that are of interest
A stockman feeding cattle in Texas J
will use from thirty to fifty bushels of
corn to the head according to the length
of the feeding season That is a reason
able estimate Now in those portions of
the state where cattle are fed
it requires two acres of land
to grow these say thirty bushels
of corn necessary to feed oue head in a rj
a7erage year Now sorghum far J
purposes Ql Ceding possesses qualiti J
equal to comj and oco acre of
land sown WitQ sorghum will in
the very poorest year yield feed
sufficlPi u for one head of stock
r a in a favoraole year enough for four
or five head Besides this advantageand
what is of great importance sorghum In
Texissrcan always be relied upon to fur
nish a good yield for the land in this
state is in every way adapted to its grow
ing The plant t Mi not die in
irae of drouth r out ohly stands

people to do what they can and esked

THE WOOL GROWERS
THEY FORMULATE AN APPEAL FULL OF IN
TERESTING FACTS AND STATISTICS
Washington Dec 7 At todays
session of the conference of the
wool growers and wool dealers of the
United States called by the president of
the National Association of wool growers
the following was unanimously adopted
The wool dealers and wool growers of
the United States representing a capital
of 50000000 and a constituency of 100
000 wol growers and dealers assembled
in conference in the city of Washington
having read the annual message of the
President to the Fiftieth Congressdeclare
that the sentiments of the message are a
direct attack upon their industry one of
the most important of the country
and in positive violation of the
national Democratic platform of 1884 as
interpreteo by party leaders and accepted
by the rank and file of the party that the
argument made by the President for the
removal oi our protection against foreign
competition is an old one repeatedly
made by the enemies of our in
dustrial Drogress and effectively answered
in nearly every school district of our
land and so thoroughly disproved by the
logic of facts and the demonstration of
experience and history as to need no an
swer from us We acknowledge that our
small holdings our scattered and
unorganized condition makes us
the easy prey of the free
trader but we had a right
to expect something different from the
chief executive of the nation at once
the most happy and contented of any of
the world made so by the policy of pro
tection and development which he now
seeks to destroy We had a right to ex
pect our President would favor the wool
growers of the United States
and we confess our deep
disappointment that instead he
favors the in erests of our foreign com
petitors Justly alarmed at his position
we make an appeal from his recommenda
tion to the people to all the people to
the seven and threefourths millions of our
fellow citizens engaged in agriculture

to the millions engaged in mannf icturing
to the army of wageworkers whose wages
are maintained by a protective system to
the tradesmen and the merchants whose
prosperity depends upon it We
are confident that the deci
sion will be based upon justice
and patriotism and therefore for the
maintenance of the American policy of
protection to which the country is in
debted for its unexampled prosperity To
demonstrate the injustice of the Presi
dents policy and the fallacy of the
remedy he proposes for the reduction of
the surplus we point to the fact
that If the whole amount of the revenue
derived from wool was abolished it would
reduce the surplus only about 5000000
or less than ten cents per capita of the
p pulatlon which is paid by foreigners
while the old war taxes he recommends
retained the yield over 119000000 and
is a diect tax per capita cf 2 each and
is what mk s up the great buik of sur
plus of 140000J000 and which fostera a
most dangerous monopoly We would
therefore add the following statistic
The annual revenues derived from thR
imports of wool under the tariff of 1SG7
was lass than 1700 Under thereductd
tariff of 83 the revenue last year was 5
000000 The numoer of sheep in the
country in 84 was 50602062 In 1887 it
was 14794393 a decrease of nearly
G000000 and a diminution of the annual
wool product of over 3000000 pounds
thus showing that the reducing of the
tariff by the act of 1883 has increased the
revenue from imported wool and
diminished the number cf sheep in
the United vStates 12 per cent and
the annual product in the same propor
tion The Presidents policy would briDg
about the destruction of this industry anu
the same policy of reduction or abolition
of tariff would end in disaster to the other
Industrial productive business of the
country

Pnlladelphia Record
Upon economic grounds wholly apart
from any moral consideration there is
reason to believe that the masses of
American workingmen are not willing to
accept a repeal of the internal taea on
whisky and tooacco as an alternative to a
repeal cf the burdens of taxation upon
the necessaries of Hying end the raw
materials of labor But strangely
enough a repeal of the Internal revenue
system is favorably regarded in mercantile
and business circles where it could hardly
be supposed that so desperate a financial
policy could be harbored Bankers
and merchants who are or
ought to be keenly alive to
the importance of maintaining a sound
fiscal system as essential to the public
credit have only to consider what would
be the effect of the threatened policy in
case the country should becoms involved
in an expensive foreign war or In finan
cial embarrassments from any cause In
the event of a foreign war in preparation
or which it is proposed to expend hun
dreds of millions of dollars f jr fleets and
f rtiflcations no dependence could be
plflctd upon revenues from customs
With the iiiternal revenue system abol
ished whence would the country draw its
means of meeting its military expendi
tures and preserving its credit
Happily we have had such on abun
dance of experience on this subjct that
there can hardly be a possibility of erring
in it In the second year of the civil war
1S62 the revenues from customs amounts
ed to but S49000000 notwithstanding
the large Increase in the rates of duty
The receipts from internal revenues
were 1795 000 The loans in
1862 amounted to 433000000 In
1863 the customs amounted to S69
000000 the internal revenue to 39
000000 aud the loans to 5950 0000
In 1864 the customs amounted to S102
000000the internal revenues to SllOOCO
000 and the loans to 69G 000 000 In
1865 the customs amounted to 85 000
as important to maintain a sound
system capable of mee ing any financial
emergency of government
Yet at the approaching session of tne
Fiftieth Congress as was seen in the
Fortyninth Congress will be found
statesmen exaggerating Jhe dangers of
foreign war as a pretext for vast military
expenditures and at the sametime advo
cating the abandonment of a fiscal
policy that would be as essential for
successful war as would fleets and armies
