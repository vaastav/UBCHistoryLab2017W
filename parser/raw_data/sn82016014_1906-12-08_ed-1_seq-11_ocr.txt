Sides in Correspondence.

Dismissal Was Unwarranted.
Chicago, Dec. 8. The Chicago Tri
bune In Its Washington din itches to
day 5avn that an extraordinary letter
has been addressed by Bellamy Storer
to President Roosevelt, and the mem
bers of his cabinet in regard to his dis
missal from the post of ambassador of
the United States to Austra-Hungary.
Mr. Storer was dismissed because ot
his wife's supposed Interference in af
fairs of the Roman Catholic churches
and her alleged misuse of letters from
the president.
It was also charged that Mrs. Stor
er had meddled with French politics
by taking part in anti-Republican in
trigue to promote the marriage of
Victor Bonaparte with a member of
the Orleans family. Both of these
charges Mr. Storer denies and. on the
other hand declares! that the presi
dent's interest in the selection of Arch
bishop Ireland, as a cardinal was not
due to Storer or to Storer's wife but
to the president alone.
The text of Mr. Storer's letter was
printed and transmitted not only to
the president, but also to members of
the foreign relations committee of the
senate.
Mr. Storer says that his removal in
-o summary a manner suddenly dis
missed him from an office which he.
had been given reason to believe he
hid filled to the satisfaction both of
his own government and of that to
which he was accredited and being ac
companied by no public legislation, it
exposed him to suspicion and injurious
conjectures such, as must naturally
arise when a man in public office Is
abruptly dismissed by his government
with what It obviously intended to be
discredit. The correspondence shows
the familiar relations of the president
and the Storers from the time Mr.
Roosevelt was governor of New York,
just after the Spanish war. Some of
the Roosevelt letters to Storer were
addressed "My Dear Bellamy" and to
his wife "My Dear Maria" and Mrs.
Storer addressed the president as
"Dear Theodore."
Charges Inconsistency.
Mr. Storer asserts that Roosevelt,
himself while governor of New York,
urged the Storers to use their influence
with the Vatican for Ireland's promo
tion, believing the prelate's well known
patriotism would aid in solving the
problems connected with the Catholic
church in the Philippines.
One letter of the president to Mrs.
Storer. dated December 11, 1905, after
the efforts of the Storers in behalf of
Archbishop Ireland began to attract
attention, contains the following pass
ages: "Your direct or implied complaint of
and reflections upon my own personal
conduct give me no concern, but I am
verv gravely concerned at the mis
chievous effect your letters must have
in misrepresenting the position of the
United States government and by the
far reaching governmental scandal
your indiscretion may at any time
cause.
"Your letters not only convey a
totallv wrong impression of my atti
tude but thev are such as you have
no buines whatever to write in view
of the position of your husband in the
diplomatic -service.
"You do not seem to realize that it
Is out of the question for me knowing
ly to permit the wife of one of our
diplomats to engage in ecclesiastic in
trigues to influence the Vatican."
American Ambassadress.
After referring to the reports that
jjrB storer was known in Europe as
the American ambassadress to Rome,
Mr. Roosevelt closes thus:
"I must ask you to give me this
positive nromise in writing If Bellamj
fa to continue in the service and if you
ven unintentionally violate it, I shall
have to ask for Bellamy's resignation,
for I can no longer afford to have the
chance of scandal lein brought on
the entire American diplomatic service
and on the government itself by such
indiscreet and ill advised action as
yours Ivis been."
"I canno: trust myself to express
fully the feeling of indignation with
-which I read the letter to Mrs.
qorer " savs Mr. Storer.
'Though 1 wa'-in the public ser
vice I felt and still feel that I had lost
none of the rights, whicn a man has
tJ jude of the propriety of letters ad
dressed to his wife and to resent an
Improper communication.
"I dJd not thn krrw what I have
since learned, that the letter was not
written for my wife's eyes or mine
alone but had "been shown to others
befcre it was sent and used to make
a case against a iadj. a trusting friend,
who could not be neard in her own
defense."
The Shah Is Reported Dead.
London, Dec. 8. A dispatch received
here this morning from Paris an

IKE," THE COOK, IS DEAD.
Well Known Topeka Character Strick
en IVltb Heart Failure.
"Ike" Martin, who for the past four
teen years has been employed by C. L.
Scott of the Creamerle restaurant as
head night cook, dropped dead shortly
after 2 o'clock this morning. He was
a very short colored man about 32
years of age and weighed in the neigh
borhood of 250 pounds, which caused
an accumulation of fat about the heart
which resulted in his death.
He had been doing his work as usual
last night and just a few moments be
fore his death was observed by one
of the waiters who entered the kitchen
leaning against a tab-le with his head
resting on his arms, as was his custom
when resting. A moment later he was
heard to fall and when the help about
the restaurant reached him he was
dead.
HARTZELL DEAD.
Man Who Built First City Hall
way in Topeka Succumbs.
Laid Out Garfield Park and Was
a Leading: Citizen.
Vallejo, Cal., Dec. 8. Colonel J. W.
Hartzell, a prominent railroad promo
ter and the brother of Bishop Hartzell
of the Methodist Kpiscopal church,
died here today, aged 63 years.
Colonel J. W. Hartzell was a former
resident of Topeka. and the promoter
as well as the builder of the first street
railway that was constructed in the
city. The road, a horse car line, was
placed in operation in 1S81 and Colonel
Hartzell was one of the heaviest stock
holders as well as active head.
Garfield park was laid out by Colonel
Hartzell and for a time it was known
as Harwell's park, later being re
named Garfield park.
Mr. Hartzell located in Topeka 1n
1S76 and for three successive years he
was proprietor of the Tefft house, the
leading hostelry of the town at that
time. In 1S79 he bought the' Topeka
Omnibus company and in 1S80 purchas
ed the business of Bolmar's freight city
line and incorporated the combination
under the title of the Topeka Transpor-
: tation and Omnibus company. In addi-
tion to this he was a charter member
i of the Topeka Water company and on
I its board of directors.
A short while arter Hartzell project
ed the Topeka street railway, he was
ousted from control by the other in
terests and following this removed
from Topeka to Wichita where he pro
moted a street railway and lost control
in much the same fashion as he did
in Topeka. He removed from Wichita
then to California where he has resid
ed continuously.,

ROAD TOPAY GASH
Santa Fe Will Uuy Advertising
Space For Money.
Will Discontinue Practice of
Exchanging Transportation.
W. J. BLACK EXPLAINS.
Says Annual Expenditure in
Newspapers Hill lie 400,000.
Initiative Taken in West
Other Roads to Follow.
Announcement is made today by W.
J. Black, passenger traffic manager of
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe rail
road, that beginning January 1, 1907,
the Santa Fe railroad will pay for all
advertising in newspapers, magazines,
and on bill boards and elsewhere, in
cash rather than In transportation.
In accordance with this decision of
the officials of the Santa Fe railroad,
J.'M. Connell, general passenger agent
of the Santa Fe at Topeka, is today
sending out the following circular let
ter to all publishers with whom the
company has contracts for the ex
change of transportation for advertis-
isg of various kinds:
"To the Publisher:
"Beginning January 1, 1907, we will
discontinue issuing transportation in
exchange for advertising and will
thereafter pay cash for all advertising
space required by us.
This action is taken by the Santa
Fe management in order to fully com
ply with the amended interstate com
merce act. . . .
"While said act does not prohibit is-
suing- free transportation locally with
in a - state, such state transportation
might tif issuedj be used tor" inter-:
state journeys contrary to law. Hence
the necessity for placing all our con
tracts on a strictly cash basis.
"Please, therefore, do not publish
any advertisements for this compvtny
after December 31, 1906, unless Au
thorized to do so by the terms of a
new contract providing .for cash set
tlement.
"Kindly favor us with, your lowesf
cash commercial rates, for both dis
play and local readers, covering- the
period up to June, 30, 1907 filling in
attached slip, detaching and mailing
same to the undersigned. The reason
ableness of your rates will have con
siderable bearing on whether or not
we can afford to use your paper and
to what extent.
"As the publication of Santa Fe
local time tables is essentially a matter
of news, same will not be paid for as
advertising, t Should you continue to
publish such timt tables as news, our
agent will gladly furnish corrections,
when changes occur. ,
"Under the terms of present con
tract, we are receiving free copies of
your paper for checking advertise
ments, etc. If,; pending -a new con
tract being made, you continue fur
nishing such copies, it is understood
they are sent complimentary."
The announcement made today places
the Santa Fe railroad in the position of
having taken the initiative in the mat
ter of the promulgation of this policy
which Mr. Black declared he believed
would be followed by the other large
railway systems.
"I believe that the practice of buy
ing all the advertising that the rail
roads desire and paying for the same in
cash will come to be universal in every
locality in the United States," said Mr.
Black, who is in Topeka today on bus
iness, having stopped off here on his
return from a trip to Colorado.
"As a matter of fact," he continued,
"it is no new idea. The railroads, or
rather a few of the larger railroads,
have considered such a move as this
more or less for several years. And
doubtless it would have come sooner or
later, regardless of the fact that the
new interstate railroad law makes it
necessary.
"There has been a growing demand
on the part of newspaper publishers to
bring the business relations between
themselves and the railroads to a more
business like basis. And I fully be
lieve that within a short time, when
the detajls of the plan as mapped out,
are all worked out, the editors and
publishers of the papers all over the
west will declare that the plan is a
good one and that they will like it bet
ter than the old plan.
"The Santa Fe railroad now spends
$250,000 annually in cash in its adver-;
tislng account, in addition to the issu
ance of transportation In exchange for
some forms of advertising. Thig cash
txperiditure is for literatute, pam-
phlets and folders describing the vari- j
ous localities along the lines of the road,
and in bill board, magazine and news
paper advertising in the larger cities
where the railroad desiies more adver
tising space than the papers care to
give in exchange for transportation.
"The policy of paying cash for advertising-ln:
every newspaper and per
iodical, we ' estimate will largely in
crease the cash advertising appropria
tion. The increase will be not less than
an additional annual expenditure of
$150,000. and possibly more, so tiiat, the
total annual expenditure for advertis
ing, to be paid in cash, will be at least
$400,000. and this may possibly run up
as high as half a million dollars.
"We were largely guided in making
this decision on account of the peculiar
position that the Santa Fe railroad oc
cupies. The interstate act applies only
on interstate affairs, except in the ter
ritories of Oklahoma, Indian Territory,
Arizona and New Mexico, where the
federal law applies in the same man
ner as though it was a state law. So
if we had decided to continue contracts
with newspapers for advertising in ex
change for transportation to be used
wholly within the state for which it
was issued, we would be in the position
of carrying out relations with publish
ers in some states that we couid not
carry out in other states.
"The interstate commerce commis
sion recently handed down a ruling on
the law holding that the law forbids the
Issuance of interstate transportation
for anything but money, thereby for
bidding the roads from entering into
contracts to exchange commodities
with the newspapers even on a strict
dollars and cents basis along book ac
count lines.
"The, interstate commerce commis
sion also holds that intrastate trans
portation, if used in payment of a por
tion of- an interstate trip constitutes a
violation of the law.
"Consequently we came to the con
clusion that the only sensible and
businesslike method of handling the
matter was to enter into contracts with
the newspapers, like any other corpor
ation or person desiring advertising
space, and pay the current commercial
rates for the space, the same as anyone
else, and allow the publisher or editor
to pay for whatever, transportation he
needed, and if the amount of adver
tising done by the railroad amounts to
more than the publisher cares to spend
in transportation, he can use the
money as he chooses."
"I believe after the plan Is tried out,
the publishers will thank the railroads
for inaugurating thepolicy."
General Passenger,', Agent ConnelJ
sent out blanks today to every pub
lisher with whom the Santa Fe has
existing contracts on which he maj
give figures relative to circulation and
rates for both display advertising and
reading notices,. -
V0TESF0R JAPANESE.
Will Go Far Toward. Preserving
Friendly Relations, Says Aoki.
Washington. Dec. Favorable ac
tion by congress on the recommenda
tion on the part of the president in his
last annual message that an act be
passed specifically . providing for the
naturalization of Japanese who come to
the United States intending to become
American citizens will go far tow
ards securing a continuance of the tra
ditional friendly relations between this
country and Japan in the opinion of
Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassa
dor. "Of course." said Viscount Aoki to
day, "no nation likes to see its sub
jects leave to take up a permanent
abode in a foreign land and lose all re
lation with the fatherland, but in many
cases it can not be helped."
' The ambassador expressed the belief
that there were not so many Japanese
in. this country to take advantage of
naturalization if it were granted but
he thought that such an opportunty
should be afforded them along with the
citizens of other countries. He said he
did not think it probable that those
Japanese who were emigrating In large
numbers to Hawaii and the Pacific
coast would avail themselves of natur
alization because of the fact that they
represented the poorer classes and most
of them ultimately returned to Japan.
Viscount Aoki said hehad every con
fidence in the outcome of the test case
which will be brought in the California
courts.

The mail sack was in the depot at De

SupreineCourtG rants Mandamus
Against Missouri Pacific.
Decisive Victory for Larabee
Flour Mill Company.
AGAINST ISLTII WELLS.
His Ruling on the Belleville
JJond Case Reversed.
List of Opinions Handed Down
Today by Supreme Court.
A decision was handed down by the
supreme court today allowing a writ of
mandamus against the Missouri Pacific
railway company in the suit brought
by the Larabee Flour Mills company
of Stafford requiring the railway com
pany to handle cars on the switches to
the plant of the milling company.
The Missouri Pacific and the Ateh
son, Topeka & Santa Fe built-a track
so that cars from the Santa Fe could
reach the switching tracks at the mill.
This transfer track was owned by the
Santa Fe. Some cars that had been set
on the mill track were not moved in the
required time and a bill for demurrage
was presented by the Missouri Pacific
to the mill company. The mill company
refused to pay. The Missouri Valley
Car Service Storage association, a vol
untary organization of railway lines
to look after the distribution and hand
ling of cars ordered the Missouri Pa
cific not to handle any more cars com
ing from the Santa Fe over this trans
fer track for the mill company until
this demurrage bill was paid.
The opinion in this case was written
by Justice . Burch, in the syllabus of
whicn he says: A common carrier has
no right to discontinue switching cars
for a shipper on account of his refusal
to pay bills for car service when the
detention for which the charges were
assessed was occasioned as much by
the fault of the carrier as by the fault
of the shipper..
"A rule or order obliging a shipper
to pay Car service charges, whether
just or unjust, with no redress but to
submit a claim lor the return of his
money to the manager of the car ser
vice association promulgating the re
quirement, is not reasonable."
At the time of hearing of this suit ir:
the supreme court the railway com
pany's attorneys claimed that a major
ity of the business of the mill company
was interstate and that the supreme
oourf did not have any jurisdiction.
On this point the court says: "The
internal movement of property is not
freed from state control until after it
has been finally released by the" con
signor to' a. carile -for. -transportation
to a destination fixed beyond the state
,line;. and', under -the "facts , of , this case
sucn control is not tost until atter tne
freight has been billed to its destina
tion.": . - ;
"The switching of cars, loaded with
freight afterwards transported to an
other tate., which is purely local, which
is independently contracted for, which
has no relation to the contract of carriage-
-under' -'which the freight is re
moved beyond the border; of the state,
which has no relation toi the ultimata
deetinatiqh" of-'the cars, and which be
gins and ends before the destination of
any car handled is fixed; is a mere pre
liminary incident to interstate com
merce and subject to state control."
A charge of $2 was made by the rail
way company for switching cars from
the transfer track to the mill track or
vice versa. The court held that no
matter where the ear came from or
was bound to, this switching was not
a part of interstate commerce.
The court compels the Missouri Pacific
to handle the business of the mill com
pany over the transfer track to the
Santa Fc.
Strife Auditor's Ruling Reversed.
The city of Belleville wanted to is
sue $20,000 in bonds for building a
municipal waterworks plant. Seth G.
Wells, state auditor, refused to regis
ter the bonds on the ground that a
city could not issue bonds which would
exceed fifteen per cent of the assessed
valuation of all property in the city
and this 120,000 would exceed the I
statutory limit. A writ of mandamus
was asked for to compel the auditor
to register the bonds and the supreme
court today allowed the writ.
It was claimed that the act allowing
cities to issue bonds for municipal
utilities was limited by a previous act
which set the amount to which bonds
could be issued. The upinion was
written by Justice Porter in wheh he
says: ,
"The amount of bonds which cities
of the first, second and third class are
authorized to issue under chapter 101,
session laws 1905, for the purposes
therein mentioned, is not controlled by
any limitations of previous legislative
acts. The act of 1905 is the latest ex
pression of legislative will upon the
subject asd repeals the provisions of
all other acts in conflict with it."
Under this decision the cities of
Kansas can issue bonds for water,
light and heating plants and natural
gas to any amount, even if their bond
ed indebtedness at present equals the
statutory limitations.
Hits Foreign Corporations.
Foreign corporations cannot main
tain suits in Kansas unless they have
complied with Kansas laws and have
obtained a certificate fro:;i the secre
tary of state, according to an opinion
of the supreme court which was writ
ten by Chief Justice Johnston in the
suit brought by D. M. Osborne & Com
pany' against J. A. Shill:ng, appealed
from the Miami county district court.
Mr. Shilling and his brother bought
a corn harvester from the Osborne
company and ave notes in payment.
The machine was returned as not be
ing up to the representation of the
agent and payment on the notes was
refused. The corporation brought the
suit to collect the notes but the case
was thrown out of court because they
had not complied with the Kansas
statutes relating to foreign corpora
tions. The case was appealed to the
supreme court and it was held that the
corporation did not have a right to
seek red.ress in the court3 of Kansas to
coliect a debt because it did not have
any right to do business here.

It Is Used by an Editor to Print His
Paper.
New York, Dec. 8. The electric motor
which is used to drive the press in the
office of the Staten Island Advance, In
West Brighton, broke a'own yesterday
and an expert found that It would have
to be sent to Philadelphia for repairs.
John Crawford, jr., the editor, found
that no other office in Staten Island
could print his 16 page paper last night,
so he took his 35 horse power automo
bile up alongside the building, had a
hole knocked through the wall and the
shaft of his press run out. A pulley
was then adjusted to the shaft of the
automobile and last night l.e paper
was being run off successfully.
WAR ONLY DELAYED.
Californians Look for It to Come With.
In Five Years.
Chicago, Dec. 8. A dispatch to the
Tribune from San" Francisco saysv
California regards the Japanese im
broglio as practically settled and while
the present crisis has been bridged over,
expects and predicts war between the
United States and Japan within five
years. That the federal government by
dodging the Issue and placing respons
ibility for the alleged insult to Japan
on California has prevented immediate
war is the firm conviction of politicians
and office holders in San Francisco but
that war with Japan will eventuate is
declared on every Bide.

Lewis walked into the bank a few
minutes after it opened this morning
and pointing a revolver at A. E. Tav

throw up his hands.
As Mr. Taylor complied he tossed
out a bunch of bills amounting to

darted up an alley with a crowd of
men and boys in pursuit. Seeing him

the second floor of the Wells-Fargo
building and into a millinery store.
Two women who vyere occupying the
room made a rapid g"taway. Several
of the pursuers entered the third
story room above the bandit and fired
at him through the floor.
Bud Westfall, the express driver
was in the express office on the first
floor and a bullet passed through th1
two floors, killing him. Westfall was
a newly married man.
Finally after, parleying for an hour
with his pursuers. Lewis surrendered
and was taken to the county jail. The
money was recovered. Officers be
lieve that the name of Lewis is ficti
tious. The man said that he came hers.
from Chicago three days ago to do the

After he had surrendered he was

He cried as he told his story.
TOPEKA LOSES 48 PER CENT.
Building Operations for November
Smaller Than In I05.
The aggregate of the building opera
tions in the leadihg'cities over the Uni
ted States for the month of November
was less by 17 per cent than that for
the same month of last year.
The total volume of construction
amounted to $35,807,107 during the pact
month while November of 1905 is cred
ited with $43,624,783. The months ot
November and December are always
poor months locally. The weather con
ditions are such as to discourage activi
ty and not until March does the teal
construction business commence. There
is a pronounced loss In the building In
Topeka; in November, 1906, it was $35,
860. In November. 1905. It was $68,620.
However, cities such as Des Moines,
Mobile and Davenport report less ac
tivity than Topeka.
The operations last year were so
enormous, breaking all records, that
the pace could not be expected to be
1 mat prospeiny m me uuuuiiik uny is
to continue.
as comparea witn tne cor-
responding month of last year, the per
centage of gains in the leading cities
Is as follows: Atlanta, 13: Cleveland, IS;
Dallas. 14; Duluth, 14; Harrlsburg. 92;
Hartford, 14; Manchester, 110; Milwau
kee, 8; Minneapolis, 25; Newark, 1;
Paterson. 31; Pueblo, 56: Rochester, 7;
Seattle, 65; Syracuse, 23; Winnipeg, 50.
The percentage of the chief reported
losses are as follows: Buffalo, 18; Chi
cago, 9: Cincinnati. 33; Denver. 56: De
troit, 15; Kansas City, 35: Louisville, 70;
Nashville. 38; New York, 31; Omaha.
12; Pittsburg, 10; Spokane, 25; Topeka,
48; Toledo, 8; Tacoma. 25. From this
comparison It appears that the gain
and losses, practically, even so far as
the number of cities is concerned, are
widely distributed, thus showtng that
the changes are due to local conditions,
such as the supply of buildings and
the cost of construction. Viewed in this
light it is manifest that there Is nothing
existing In this country tending tow
ards a discouragement of building op
erations. The high price of material
and labor doubtless has the effect of
curtailing present operations, particu
larly in cities where there Is no press
ing dei.iand for more buildings.
