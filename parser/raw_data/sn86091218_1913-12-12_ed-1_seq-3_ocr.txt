President Wilsoïi, to the consideration
of tariff and currency reform,
nothing that might interfer with those
issues was taken up. The
bill still dominates the situation as the
new session begins, but the adminis
tration program of anti-trust and rail
road legislation,, which is to follow,
must share the field with a score or
more of other important subjects.
The new session probably will wit
ness more activity prior to Christmas
than any of recent years. Democratic
leaders propose to hold the senate to
thirteen-hour sessions, with no Christ
mas vacation, unless the currency bill
is passed before the time set for the
holidays. In the house, meantime, an
effort will be made to dispose of sev

before Christmas, so that appronrl"

as possible with the consideration of

French Works for Improved Lan;'
Conditions.
Congressman French has been very
active in supporting the proposition of
passfing to patent all lands in Idaho,
patent to which under grants should
be issued to grantee, and is greatly
pleased with the view the interior
partment is taking of the proposition.
In northern Idaho alone approxi
mately 2,000,000 acres
^ranted lo railroads or to grantees of
the latter and are paying no taxes.
Some of this land is so situated that
under the ordinary survey work that
the government is carrying on, it can
not be reached within tiie near future.
le
have
been
I in view and has the support of the in
terior department in the proposition.
Assistant Secretary Jones said to
day to Mr. French, "I shall hack up
the. proposition to the limit." Speak
ing on the subject Mr, French said, "I
condemn most earnestly the scrip law
vvhich was enacted some fifteen years
ago under which these lands iftve
been selected in Idaho in lieu of land
grants in other states. This crime,
however, has been committed, and we
cannot undo it. The thing to do now is
to make the lands taxable instead of
permitting them to increase in value to
the owners at the expense of the state
of Idaho and the counties through the
non-payment of taxes.
Mr. Frencti urges that in addition to
this a special appropriation should be
I provided for the survey of this land.
! He has introduced a bill with this end
*
Wants Western Delegations
~ Unite.
In discussing leTtislrttot/Vlesired by
the west recently, Congressnvn SrnithMpS*'
expressed a sentiment which will find
a heartv response in the hearts of all
true westerners. He said;
"Recent developments convince me
that it may be necessary for western
delegations to act in unison on certain
measures, as a matter of self-protec
tion.
"if we do not we will be denied many
things to which we are entitled, and
some things which we have long en
joyed will be taken away from us.
"The eastern section of the coun
try is particularly favored because of
the seat of government being located
here. / All the senators and represen
tatives are required to spend the most
of their time here, and because of this
fact they are all advised regarding
the legislative needs of the central
and eastern part of the country, but
they are not required to inform them
selves in regard to the great Rocky
Mountain and Pacific coast states and,
as a consequence, they are handicap
ped by lack of information when ques
tions peculiarly applicable to that sec
tion are under consideration. What
actual knowledge can the new mem
ber have of the legislative needs of
that country who has never been west
of the Mississippi river? What can he
Know about the necessity of proposed
changes in the homestead laws, the de
sert land laws, the dry farming act,
the reclamation law, the mining law,
and numerous other laws effecting the
country? And yet we all know of in
stances, many of them, where mem
bers refuse to follow the opinion of
those who know by actual experience
and observation the hardships impos
ed on the pioneer farmer because of
the unjust provisions of our public
land laws.
"It seems to me that every member
of the committee on public lands,
mines and mining, irrigation and agri
cultural and forestry should be ex
pected to make a trip through the west
at government expense if necessary
in order that he may have first hand
information before he .is called upon
to consider in a responsible way leg
islation effecting the interests of that
section 'oJ the country.
"There are very few questions ef
fecting the west about which western
people differ. We belong to different
political parties, and may disagree in
religions views, or on the tariff,
currency and trusts, but when a ques
tion effecting the interests of the west
arises we are generally of one mind."
Homesteaders Entitled to Patents.
The Interior department has issued
order touching the patenting of
homestead lands acquired under the
reclamation projects, requiring that
hefnre the homesteader may make
proof It will be necessary for him to
.have successfully cultivated dot lese
than one-half of his land two yea"
In succession.
Congressman French Is. reeelvln

President's Message.
Probably no presidential message h
recent years has attracted more inter*
est than President Wilson's message
of yesterday. The recommendation of
President Wilson touching the nomiita
ation of candidates for the presidency
by a primary law that will apply to an
the states, is of special interest, and
sentiment is divided.
Congressman French in speaking of
the subject said: "I am heartily
favor of carrying out this recommend
dation of the president and for a Iona
time I have stood for this manner ot
nominating our presidents. If the poM
pie generally may well have, the
