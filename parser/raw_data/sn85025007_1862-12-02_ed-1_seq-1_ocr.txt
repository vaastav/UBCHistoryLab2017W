produced a profound impression in armypircles.

the sympathy for him was very strong.

cent and a halt per sheet after it has been print
ed, precisely $7 20. On the cost of white pa
per alone, therefore, there is a clear loss of over
$4 on every thousand printed. The New York
Post has raised its prices to four cents*per copy
and ten dollars per annum.
