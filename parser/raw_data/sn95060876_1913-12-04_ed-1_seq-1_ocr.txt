GOOD WORK DONE BY
AND CITY COUNCIL I
MAYOR
N CITY PARK
The Ocotillo club met last Saturday
with Mr. C D. Baker, and after ad
journment went in a body to Sunset
Park, to see the good wo.rk that is go
ing on there. They found the new
curbing well under way, the palm
trees in the center adding greatly to
the park, in present appearances and
future promise, and the red gum trees
that they had furnished prospering
nicely.
The mayor and city council are to
be highly commended for their public
spirit in this undertaking. Lying as
it does between the Second avenue
School and the High School block the
park will be in sight of all -the chil
dren every school day. And when it
is a thing of beauty, who can tell how
great an influence it will have on their
education and future lives. Let us
hojd up the hands of our honorable
mayor and city council, and assist
them in every way possible to beautify
this place of rest and recreation, not
only for our own citizens, but also for
the "strangers within our gates."
ARIZONA WlliS OVER
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
THE TAX COMMISSION
ORDERS TAX REFUNDED
At the city council meeting Tuesday
night, a communication from the Tax
Commission concerning a claim by
the Mountain States Telephone, and
Telegraph Company, for a refund of
a part of a tax recently paid ,was rtwd.
It stated that the State collects all
taxes from telephone and telegraph
lines and the proportion of the tax
due to cities and towns and counties
is paid them by the state. The town,
therefore, has no right to levy a direct
tax, and the tax already collected by
the town is illegal and is to be re
funded. A motion was carried that the re
fund, amounting to $13.64, be made.
The communication also stated that
the Town had no legal right to col
lect an occupation ax from the tele
phone company. Manager Bunton of
the company, stated .however, that
his company would pay the occupation
tax to the present time and hereafter
would allow the town the use of three
telephones free of charge in lieu of an
occupation tax. ' Mr. Bunton stated
that the free use of these three phones
was in the nature of a contribution
for the sake of good fellowship.
PHOENIX, Dec. 2
ler of currency of the United States,
George E. Downel, has recently hand
ed down an opinion in the matter of
the payment of members of the Na
tional Guard companies that are as
signed to certain special duties by
the adjutant generals of the states,
that relieves the secretary of war and
the division of militia affairs of the
United States army of one of the
things that has caused more embar-1
rassment than any other matter with
which they have to deal, and that is
the disbursement of funds, provided
for the national giJard by enactment
of congress and allotted to the various
states, according to the number of
congressmen each state has.
It has been the custom for the dis-
busements to be made by warrant
through the disbursing officer detailed
from the national guard, but all of
these warrants have been made sub-,
ject to auditing by the war depart
ment. If for any reason the auditor
for the war department withheld pay
ment then the states were out. This ,
situation happened once too often, and
the kick, which finally knocked over.
the complex structure, came from Ari
zona, having been made by Colonel
Charles W. Harris, the adjutant-general
of the state, who as Captain C.
W. Harris, disbursing officer, paid out
certain moneys upon order from him;
self as adjutant general.

Although Arizona has only two
thirds of the population of New Mex
ico, yet, it has more large towns
than this state, as is indicated by the
postal receipts for the past fiscal year
just made public by the postoffice de
partment. Of nine cities whose re
ceipts exceed $20,000 a year, six are
located in Arizona. Arizona postof-
fices in that class had more than
double the receipts! 1 of New Mexico
postoffices above the 20,000 mark,
to-wit, $247,473, as against $JL13,798 in
New Mexico. The twenty postoffices
with receipts of more than $10,000 a
year in two states rank as follows,
and at the same time indicate -the
twenty largest towns:
Phoenix $96,568
Albuquerque 63,29.8
Tucson 48,280
Bisbee 32,589
Roswell ; 26,5S4

In other words, Albuquerque has
grown to be three times the4 size of
Santa Fe, Tucson twice the size, and
Phoenix more than four times the size
of the oldest city of them all, which
thirty years ago was the Jargest town
in the two commonwealths,- and had
a greater population than either El
Paso or Colorado Springs or than both
taken together, while forty years ago
it was larger than Los Angeles and
fifty" years ago larger than Denver,
and there was a day when it was the
largest town in what is now United
States and Canada.

President Wilson's message, deliver
ed in person, to congress yesterday, is
the briefest regular message ever sub
mitted by a president to congress, and
has many salient features for. the
American people to ponder o'er.
Vlctoriano Huerta, dictator of Mex
ico, is denounced as a usurper. It is
made plain that pretended govern
ments such as his will not be counte
nanced or dealt with by the United
States. "Huerta's power and prestige
are crumbling and his collapse is not
far away," says the president. , '
Congress is told that the country
awaits with impatience for the enact
ment of the currency bill and the sen
ate is urged to concentrate on it until
the matter is disposed of.
The president devotes a considerable
portion of nis short message to a rec
ommendation for the enactment of
laws which will facilitate rural credits.";
Congress is urged to enact laws which
will not make it necessary for the gov
ernment to resort to such extraordi
nary expedients as the distribution of
deposits in Western banks to help
move the crops.
More explicit legislation aimed at
the trusts and supplementing the Sher
man Anti-Trust law is recommended.
The president promises a special mes
sage a little later onthis subject.
A presidential primary with the re
tentions of party conventions to draw
nlatforms and carry out the wishes of
the people expressed at the primary is
recommended.
The president recommends that leg
islation affecting the Philippines be
drawn with a view to the ultimate in
dependence of the islands.
A territorial government for Alaska
is recommended by the president.
Legislation looking to improved con
ditions for mine labor is recommended.
A fair and effective employer's lia
bility act is among the recommenda
tions.
Legislation relating to safety at 'sea,
now pending in the house, is also recommended.
DISARMING IS CAUSE
OF TERROR IN SONORA
ATTY. HARRIS IIUU
010 TURNS OVER
Late Wednesday a message ws
received from Dome, stating that City
Attorney Harris and a man named
Harsh, on their way to inspect some
mines in the Middle Wells district,
met with an accident, their auto turn
ing turtle. Mr. Harris is reported seri
ously injured, and he is being brought
to Yuma. Dr. Clymer is on the road
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Dec. 2. The dis
armament of the people of the dis
trict south of Lampazos, which was
accomplished a few days ago under
the direction of Captain Laustaunou
of the constitutional army, has de
veloped much wrath in that section,
although the plan was that of the
constitutional government announced
several months ago. The peo
ple, who feel that they will , be
helpless in the face of Yapui raids
which are anticipated, will ,it is un
derstood, petition, the stategovern
ment to return their weapons that
they may defend themselves.
Recent reports from the Yaqui
country have it that several hundred
Indians have finally broken with the
Mexicans and are raiding, independ
ently. All of these Indians are armed
with Mexican army "rifles and have
plenty of ammunition for a long
drawn out fight. The raids have, as
yet been confined to a small district,
according to reports. There is every
reason to believe, however, that as
they find themselves practically un
opposed by the constitutionalists,
who are attempting conciliation of
the Reds, they will expand the scene
of their depredations.
The' Indians insist upon the return
of the ancestoral lands which have
been wrested from them during the
last few generations by the Mexicans.
A number of promises have been
made by the constitutional govern
ment and, in some cases carried out,
One recent proposal, which was to
assign a large tract in the Montezuma
district, in the vicinity of the Yaqui
village of Terupa formerly held by
the Yaquis, but now, in many in
stances in the possession of foreign
ers, was reported- here to have been
squelched, surveyors had been set at
work but, for some reason were with
drawn before their work of segre
gating the Indian lands had been
completed.
