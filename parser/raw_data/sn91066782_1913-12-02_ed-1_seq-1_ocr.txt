FARMERS NEED
GOOD SYSTEM
OF CREDITS
President Wilson Urges
Congress to Adopt Legis

Their Industry on Same
Basis ' as Forestry and
Mining
WE LAG FAR BEHIND
OTHER COUNTRIES
The President Repeats That
Huerta Must 'Go and That
Indications Continue to
Point to That Consum
mation Washingon, D. C, Dee. 2. Regret that
the United State as a government has
done so little to aid the" farmers in
building up the agricultural interests of
the country and a suggestion for the
adoption of a system of farm credits
formed salient features of the message
of President Wilson, which was sub
mittod to Congress to-day. As to the
Mexican affair, the president reiterated
his belief that the downfall of Huerta
must tome and that the downfall seems
more certain with each succeeding day.
President Wilson said:
'Gentlemen of the Congress:
"In pursuance of my constitutional
duto to 'give to the Congress informa-
tion of the state of the union, 'I take
the liberty of addressing you on several
matters which ought, as it seems to me,
particularly to engage the attention of
your honorable bodies, as of all who
study the welfare and progress of the
nation.. , k ;
"l shall ask your indulgence if I ven
ture to depart in gome degree from the
Usual custom of setting before -you in
formal review the many matters which
liave engaged the attention and called
for the action of the several departments
of the government or which look to them
for early treatment "in the future, be
cause the list is long, very long, and
would, suffer in the abbreviation to
which I should have to subject it. I
shall submit to you the reports of the
beads of the several departments, in
which these subjects are set forth in
careful detail, and beg that they may re
ceive, the thoughtful attention of your
committees and of all members of the
Congress who may have the leisure to
study them. Their obvious importance,
ss constituting the very substance of
the business of the government, makes
comment and emphasis on my part un
necessary. .
At Peace With World.
"The country, I am thankful to say, is
at peace with all the world, and many
happy manifestations multiply about us
of a growing cordiality and sense of com
munity of interest among the nations,
foreshadowing an age of settled peace
mid good will More and more readily
each decade do the nations manifest their
willingness to bi"nd themselves by
solemn treaty to the processes of peace,
the processes of frankness and fair con
cession. So far the United States has
stood at the front ofsuch negotiations.
She will, I earnestly hope and confi
dently believe, give fresh proof of her
sincere adherence to the cause of inter
national friendship by ratifying the sev
eral treaties of arbitration awaiting re
newal by the Senate. In addition to
these, it has been the privilege of the
department of state to gain the assent
in principle, of no less than 31 nations,
representing four-fifths of the population
of the world, to the negotiations of
treaties by which it shall be agreed that
whenever differences of interest or of
policy arise which can not be resolved by
the ordinary processes of diplomacy
they shall be publicly analyzed, dis
cussed, and reported upon by a tribunal
chose'n by the parties before either na
tion determines its course of action.
"There is only one possible standard
by which to determine controversies be
tween the United States and other na
tions, and that is compounded of these
two elements: Our own ho"nor and our
obligations to the peace of the world.
A test so compounded ought easily to
be made to govern both the establish
ment of new treaty obligations and the
interpretation of those already assumed.
Huerta Bound to Fail .
"There is -but one cloud Upon our
borizon. That has shown itself to the
south of us, and hangs over Mexico.
There can be no certain prospect of peace
in America until On. Huerta has surren
dered his usurped authority in Mexico;
until it is understood on all hands, in
deed, that such pretended governments
will not be countenanced or dealt with
by the government of the United States.
We are the friends of constitutional gov
ernment in America; we are more than
its, friends, we are its champions; be
. cause in no other way can our neighbors,
to whom we would wish in every way to
make proof of our friendship, work out
their own development in peace and
liberty. Mexico has no government. The
attempt to maintain one at the City of
Mexico has broken down, and a mere
military despotism has been set up
which has hardly more than the sem
blance of national authority. It orig
inated in the usurpation of Victoriano
Huerta. who. after a brief attempt to
play the part of constitutional president,
lias at last cast aside even the pretense '
of legal right and declared himself die'
tator.
"As a consequence, a condition of af
fairs now exists in Mexico which has
made it doubtful -whether even the most
elementary and fundamental rights
either of her own people or of the citi
zens of other countries resident within
her territory can long be .successfully
safeguarded, and which threatens, if long
continued, to imperil the interests of
peace, order, and tolerable life in the
lands immediately to the south of us.
Even if the usurper had succeeded in his
purposes, in despite of the constitution
of the republic and the rights of its peo
ple, he would have set up nothing but a
precarious and hateful power, which
could have lasted but a little while, and
whose eventful downfall would have left
the country in a more deplorable condi
tion than ever. But'he has not succeed
ed. He has forfeited the respect and the
moral support even of those who were
at one time 'willing to see him succeed.
Little by little he has been completely
isolated. Jty a little every day his pow
er and prestige are crumbling and the
collapse is not far away. We shall not,
I believe, be obliged to alter our pol
icy of watchful waiting. And t IieVi,
w hen the end comes, we shall hope to see
constitutional order restored in dis
tressed Mexico by the concert and energy
of such of her jeaders as prefer the
liberty "of their people to their own am
bitions. Farm Credit System Needed.
"I turn to matters- of domestic con
cern. You already have under consid
eration a bill for the reform of our sys
tem of banking and currency, for which
the country waits with impatience, as
for something fundamental to its whole
business life and necessary to set credit
free from arbitrary and artificial re
straints. 1 need not say how earnestly 1
hope for its early enactment into law.
I take leave to heg that te wnoie
energy and attention of the Senate be
concentrated upon it till the matter is
successfully disposed of. And yet I feel
that the remiest is not needed that the
members of the great House need no
urging in this service to the country.
'I present to you, fn addition, the
urgent necessity that special provision
be made also for facilitating the credits
needed by the farmers of the country.
The pending currency bill does the farm
ers a great service. It puts them upon
an equal footing with other business
men and , masters of enterprise, as it
should; and upon its passage they will
find themselves ouit of many of the diffi
culties which now hamper them In the
field of credit. The farmers, of course,
ask and should be given no special priv
ilege, such as extending to them the
credit of the Government itself. What
they need and should obtafti is legisla
tion which will make their own abund
ant and substantial credit resources
available as. a foundation for joint, con
ccrted local action in their own behalf
in getting the capital they must use. It
is to this we should "now address our
selves. "It has. singularly enough, come to
pass that we have allowed the industry
of our lamia to lag behind me oiner ac
tivities of the country in' its develop
ment. I need not stop to tell you how
fundamental to the life of the nation is
the production of its food. Our thoughts
may ordinarily be concentrated upon the
cities and the hives of industry, upon
the cries of the crowded market place
and the clangor of the factory, but it is
from the quiet interspaces of the open
valleys and the free hillsides that we
draw the sources of life and of prosper
ity, from the farm and the ranch, from
the forest and the mine. Without these
every street would be silent, every office
deserted, every factory fallen into disre
pair. And yet the farmer does not stand
upon the same footing with the forester
and the miner in the market of credit.
He is the servant of the seasons. .Na
ture determines how long be must wait
for his crops, and will not be hurried in
her processes. He may give his note,
but the season of its maturity depends
upon the season when his crop matures,
lies at the gates of the market where bis
products are sold. And the security he
gives is of a character not known in the
broker's office or as familiarly as it
might be on the counter of the banker.
Agricultural Department Assists.
"The agricultural department of the
government is seeking to assist as never
before to make farming.an efficient busi
ness, of wide co-operative effort, in quick
touch 'with the markets for foodstuffs.
The farmers and the government will
henceforth work together as real part
ners in this field, where we now begin to
see our way very clearly and w'here
many. intelligent plans are already be
ing put into execution. The treasury of
the United States has, by a timely and
well-considered distribution of its depos
its, facilitated the moving of the crops
in the present season and prevented the
scarcity of available funds too often ex
perienced at such times. But we must
not allow ourselves to depend upon ex
traordinary expedients. We must add
the means by which the farmer may
make his credit constantly and easily
available and command when he will the
capital by which to support and expand
his business. We lag behind many other
great countries of the modern world in
attempting to do this. Systems of rural
credit have been studied and developed
on the other side of the water while we
left our farmers to shift for themselves
in the ordinary money market. You
have but to look about you in any rural
district to see the result, the handicap
and embarrassment which have been put
upon those who produce our food.
"Conscious of this backwardness and
neglect on our part, the Congress recent
ly authorized the creation of a special
commission to Btudy the various sys
tems of rural credit which have been put
into operation in Europe, and this com
mission Is already joepared to report.
Its report ought to make it easier for us
to determine what methods will be best
suited to our own farmers. I hope and
believe that the committees of the Sen
ate and House will address themselves to
this matter with the most fruitful re-

officer, who sent armed soldiers in pur
suit. The infantrymen succeeded in
catching only the lame shoemaker, who
resisted arrest.
Von Forstner came up and deliberately
struck him on the head with the sharp
edge of his sabre. This fresh incident

Graniteville Presbyterians Wish to
Secure Rev. Fred McNeil's Services.
Presbyterians of Graniteville voted in
congregational meeting last night to ex
tend a call to Rev. Fred McNeil, who is
now supplying the church at Windham.
N. H. There was a large gathering of
Presbyterians at the church when Kev.
Duncan Salmond, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church, this city, called the

accept. The call is extended through
the Boston presbytery and will later be
forwarded to Ilev. Mr. McAeil. rarisli
loners of the Graniteville church are
anxious to secure a pastor as early as
possible and it the Windham clergy
man accepts the call he will be asked to
begin ins duties in the near future.

Bethel, Dec. 2. The sister and daugh
ter of Mrs. Julia F'owler, whose sudden
death occurred Saturday night, arrived

gaged the services ot Charles Batchel
der as legal adviser. Meanwhile- the
state's attorney, .Raymond Trainor, of

HAD MONEY THAT BURNED.
But William T. Carley Saved Enough of
$50 Remnants To Get Money Back.
It was-the four weeks ago yesterday
afternoon that William T. Carley, a
stone cutter living at 75 Prospect Btreet,
handed Ins wtte $; in bills. Some 10
minutes less than, four weeks ago the
same afternoon, Mrs. Carley gathered up
some gingham remnants from her lap
and emptied them into the kitchen range
with the paper currency, $50. Shitt
ing the scenery again, yesterday Mr.
Carlev came out of the Granite Savings
bank with a crisp roll of new bills, $50
worth. For it mav be stated here that
he happened to see his wife when she
accidentally dumped the 50, into the fire
and was able to rescue the frayed ends
of every bill. That is now he happened
to get his money back, although there
were anxious days when it looked as
though the government would refuse to
honor the scorched paper.
The moment Mrs. Car'lev discovered
that she had been feeding the fire such
expersive luel, her husband did a dash
across the room and managed to snatch
blazing handful of gingham and bills
out of the coals. Most of the matter
was burned to a crisp, but he managed
to sort out the recognizable corners of
a 20, a 10 and four five-spots, which he
later carried to the banks. Some peo-
pie suggested that Mr. Carlev would get
a good lesson in cautiousness from his
experience and .that would be about all,
or words to that effect. It hardly
seemed to them as though Uncle Sam
would be willing to invest in $50 worth
of charred banknotes.
However, the officials of the Granite
bank told Mr. Carley they would do the
best they could for him. His collection
of paper was' sent to the bank's Boston
representative, the First National bank,
and from there it was turned over to
the treasury department at Washington,
D. C, with a recital of the circum
stances surrounding its partial incinera
tion, the local bankers got a reply yes
terday and were able to turn the face
value of the remnants over to Mr. Car
Icy in the. afternoon.

a' surface sewer constructed along Elm

care of the water. In commenting upon
the situation he said he wasn't sure the
city could be held altogether responsible
tor surface water. A previous inves
tigation convinced the street committee,
according to a subsequent report, that
the water. is now following a natural
course, tin a motion made bv Alderman

structed to confer with the city attorney
in the matter and report.
