proval of the people of Chlckasha was
dispelled this morning when it was
found that only ten votes had been
cast against the proposition and that
the number of votes cast Insured a
safe majority.
It was rumored yesterday that
there was danger of the proposillou
being deteated for the, simple reason
that tin; entire vote east in this elec
tion would not total a majority of the
votes east in the last general elec
tion. The total number of votes cast
foi the acceptance of tho franchise
was Sill and working on a basis of
ll'W) votes cast within the city limits

It would have carried it. as thoroughly
as did the 811 that was actually voted.
The terms of the franchise with the
Big Horizon Oil and Gas company
pledges the company to have gas pip
er into Chic-kasha and ready for use
within eight months from yesterday,
but according to statements of the
gas company's officials, natural gas
will have ceased to be a novelty by
that time and will havo become a fix
ture with Chickasha people. The work
it: to bo pushed to the limit and the
pipe line will be laid into Chickasha
at the earliest possible moment. Prac
tically the only obstacle that will de
laj the construction work is the trou
ble incurred In the transportation of
material from eastern points.
When seen this morning, Mr. O'llara
o' the Big Horizon Oil and Gas com
pany said, "We have already encoun
tered considerable trouble in getting
out supplies and piping promptly and
are inclined to believe that this trou
ble will continue, owing to car short
age of the transportation companies.
Our franchise requires that we have
gas piped into C'hickasha within eight
months from December .", but I am
almost tempted to promise it within
7". days from yesterday. At any rate,
we will ilave the line completed and
will be selling gas in Chit-kasha just
as soon as possible. Every effort will
be exerted to have the line completed
within three months. The work
construction will start at once."

SHERIFF LEWIS
APPREHENDS
HORSE THIEF
The Grady county officials are es
tablishing a reputation for catching
horse thieves, especially those emanat
ing from Caddo county. Sheriff John
Lewis received word Monday inorn-
iiif. of a horse that had been stolen
mar Ft. Cobb, which horse he locat
( d yesterday at Alex and ran the thief
down at Pr.uh Valley the same day.
Monday being sale day here, it was
iiatuiull expected t-C thief, would
bring the stolen hoiae heio and dis
pose of him at the sale. The. man
tic m whom the horse was stolen ar
rived Monday morning, having track
ed tho thief through Anadarko. The
sheriff worked all day on the case
here without results and yesterday de
cided to look further. He went to
Alex and located the horse, which had
been sold to an Alex man yesterday
i morning. The thief, who gave his
name as Harry Meyers, went to Pauls
alley on the same train on which
Sheriff Lewis arrived in Alex. Lewis
wired to Pauls Valley aud had the
authorities there meet Meyers at the
depot and take him into custody. He
will be brought to Cbickasha this aft
ernoon, where tbt Caddo county of
cials will take him into custody for
transportation to Anadarko, "I felt
safe .when I loarnM that Meyers ha 4
taken a course through C.raiiy county,"
said the Caddo county sheriff yester
Oay, "for I knew he would never get
all the way through without Lewis or
some of his deputies getting him."

Oklahoma City, Dec, 4 The senate
session this morning witnessed the
unusual spectacle of a Democratic bolt
from the caucus Held last night. After
an interesting session last night the
caucus determined that all commit
tees should be composed of six Demo
crats and one Republican, to bi se
lected by the respective caucuses and
affirmed by the senate, as has been
tho custom. After two hours of wran
gling and many roll calls this morn
ing, by vote of IT to 11), it was de
cided by the senate that all commit
tees should be elected by the entire
senate. The fight appeared to be
principally between old and new mem
bers, hold over senators going with
the Republicans to overthrow the cau
cus rnle adopted last night. Several
prominent senators were heard to say
alter the morning session that if the
present alignment was maintained
that tho Republicans would control
the future actions of the senate in all
matters of legislation, as they, with
the insurgent senators, would consti
tute a working majority not only in
the senate, but in all the committees.
Senator Barefoot voted to overrule
the caucus agreement. Senator Pugh
voted to sustain it. The senate re

they will meet, probably in executive

Recruiting Station
Reports Progress
Reports from the local recruiting of
fice snow a good record for obtaining
men for the United States army during
the month of November. Thu vow
seven year enlistment period did not
seem to have any material effect on
the number of applicants, as seven
men were accepted here last mouth,
two of which were given special as
s'gnments, one to Indianapolis and
one to Fort Benjamin Harrison. Two
were accepted for cavalry, two for
coast artillery, two for quartermaster
corps and one for the hospital corps.
Ali of these men were sent to Fort1
Logan, Colo., from which point they
w ill W bent to IWii ' respective sta-
iieus. C ntier me new rule, they will
hi'Ve tho privilege of serving either a
three, four or seven year enlistment
ind are allowed some time in tho ser
vice before making their choice.
The seven men accepted were out
of a total of 119 applicants during the
month of November. Following are
some of the causes for which ",2 of
the applicants were turned down.
Three were over ;i,' years of age, sight
were considered worthless for a sol
dier because of their unclean appear
ance, two were married, two were un
der the influence of li'juor when they
made application for enlistment, three
were rejected on account of defective
eyesight, two were too short in stature
and five could not read or write.
The quarter master corps is attract
ing much attention and quite a num
ber of the sppPcantii desire bp be
placed in this department. This corps
takes the place of civil service men
who are appointed to places in the
I classified service, and assigned to
