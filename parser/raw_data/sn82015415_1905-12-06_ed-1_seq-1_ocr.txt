PLAN IS PAL
CARTER'S ANNUAL REPORT FOR" THIS YEAR SAID TO BE THE FIRST
. . WHICH DOES, NOT.ASK. FOR CHINESE "IMMIGRATION TO THE
ISLANDS RECOMMENDATION; S OF COOPER, DOLE AND CARTER
1 ' IN PREVIOUS YEARS, , , .
... Governor Carter's annual report, now
S-in '.the Department ot the Interior at
Washington, is said to be the first an
nual report of a governor of Hawaii
which does not contain a recommenda
tion that Chinese immigrants be allow
ed to enter Hawaii. The report has
not been made public yet, but the em
phatic stand taken against allowing
Chinese to come here by President
Roosevelt In his message, Is regarded
as evidence that Carter did not make
any such recommendation as has been
customary in the past. The President
has again shown his complete confi
dence In Carter and readiness to ac
cept his recommendations, In promptly
adopting the scheme of allowing Ha
waii 75 per cent of her federal revenues.
The following are the various recom
mendations which have been made
from here regarding labor In the past:
"That Congress be requested to au
thorize the Immigration of a limited
number of Chinese laborers, conditioned
Upon their engaging In agricultural
pursuits only, during their residence In
the (Territory, and that upon their ceas
ing to do so, that they shall return to
their own country." Acting Governor
Henry E. Cooper, 1S01'.
"That a limited Immigration of Chi
nese laborers be permitted, conditioned
upon their engaging in agricultural
work for hire only during their stay In
the Territory and subject to deporta
tion at their own expense upon their
ceasing to do so." Governor Dole, 1902.
"That a limited Immigration of Chi
nese laborers to the Territory be per
mitted, conditioned upon their engag
ing only in agricultural, mill and do
mestic work for hire during their stay,
and subject to deportation at their own
expense upon their ceasing to do so."
Governor Dole, 1903.
"First. By far the most important
question which concerns the future of
these islands Is the need of some modi
fication of the Immigration laws in or
der to provide labor to develop the re
sources of this Territory to the fullest
extent. By reference, the article on
sugar, with the remarks on labor con'

PORT THOMAS.
They maintained a strict quarantine
on the transport Thomas today at the
Naval wharf No. 1. In fact even the
officers of the army were . hauled up
without much ceremony and Captain
Humphrey, tho local depot quarter
master of this place, got afoul of a
husky sentry this morning.
Captain Humphrey naturally went on
the wharf for tie had business to trans
act with the vessel. When he started
to leave the wharf a tall sentry was on
duty with Instructions to allow no one
not even the officers of the vessel to
leave the wharf unless they had passes.
Captain Humphrey was Jield up.
"Where's your pass?", inquired the
sentry.
"Why," replied Captain Humphrey,
"I have no pass."
"Well, then, you can't go ashore," re
plied the sentry. "I have orders to al
low nobody by without a pass."
"Oh, that's all right sentry," good
naturedly replied the Captain. "I am
the depot quartermaster and do not be
long to the ship," and so tho sentry
finally allowed the land officer to. de
part. All lot the other officers aboard the
vessel, both ship's and the army, were
required to have passes, as was every
other passenger permitted ashore. None
of the steerage passengers are to be
permitted to come ashore during tho
stay of tho vessel In port. Every pre
caution Is being taken to prevent the
vessel being held up by the quarantine
officials when she reaches San Fran

(Associated Press Cable to The Star.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, December 6 A resolution has been. Introduced la
Congress providing for .the annexation of San Domingo and Hayti to tho

III FOB II CANAL
WASHINGTON, D. C, December 6. Unanimous consent has been gtveir"
by all parties In Congress for the consideration of tho bill appropriating
$16,500,000 for use in constructing the Panama Canal.
The figures given In the text of tho cable dispatch today name the amount
to bo appropriated as $165,000,000. But such a sum Is evidently an error.
The measure under consideration Is an emergency one and day before yes
terday, Monday, at the opening of Congress, about tho first measure Intro
duced was one by Representative Hep bum appropriating $16,500,000 for tho
construction of tho canal, as the former appropriation had been exhausted.
His measuro was an emergency one and was taken so that the work of tho
canal construction could be prosecuted until Congress could tako further
action looking toward the appropriation of more money. , iJkjiflB
