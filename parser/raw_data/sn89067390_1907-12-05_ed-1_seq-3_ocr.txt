Washington. Dec. 8. President
Roosevelt's annual message to congress
1.1 a voluminous document of nearly
30.000 words, by far the longest mes
sage ho has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message Is
the financial condition of the country,
nml tor which the president lays much
of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
speculators, and says:
"In any large body of men. however,
there aro certain to be soma who are
dishonest, and if the conditions aro
such that these men prosper or com
mi' their misdeeds with Impunity, their
example ' a very evl1 thing for the
rommunltv. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
chock from public opinion, they delude
manv innocent people Into making In
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that aro really unsound.
Vhn the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men nre discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the Innocent men whom they
have misled. It Is a painful awakening,
whenever It occurs; and, naturally,
when it docs occur those who Buffer
are apt to forget that the longer It was
deferred the more painful It would be.
In the effort to punish tho guilty It Is
both wise and proper to endeavor so
far as possible to minimize, the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
o imiitv. Yet it Is not possible to
r.,tYnin li'ei-.nuso of such distress from
striving to put an end to the misdeeds
that are tho ultimate cavses oi mo sin
tering, and. ns a means to this end
where possible to punish those re
sponsible for them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
irnvcrnmrntal policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
need of unllinching perseverance In the
wor against successful dislionesij.
He quotes at length from his mos-
K.ire of last year In which he odvo
cated federal control of corporations
doing interstate business, and believes
that in such control would be found the
remedy for overcapitalization ami
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present finan
cial conditions. Ho says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
latioa, cautiously and carefully under
taken but resolutely persevered In, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by altlrrnative action.
"This is only In form an innovation
In substanco it is merely a restoration;
for from tho earliest time such reguia
linn of Industrial activities has been
recognized In the action of tin? law
making bcdlcs; and all that I propose
Is to meet the changed conditions In
such manner ns will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
nlw.ivs possessed, not only in this coun
try. but also in Knglanrt before nnd
Mince this country became a separate
nation.
Federal Control of
Railroads M Favored,
"Nn small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to nil ex
trcme the national virtue of self-re
llanre. of Independence In Initiative
onrt nrtlun. It Is wise to conserve this
virtue nnd to provide for its fullest ex
crrlse. compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lark of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no Interstate business
save such as was conducted ty water,
ami this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate In thorough
nln Hnd effective fashion. Condi
tlons have now so wholly changed that
the interstate commerce by water is In
significant compared with the amount
that goes' by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged In
Interstate commerce. As a result. It
can be hut partially and imporfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of tho several states; such ac
tion Inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax. and In either
case Ineffective for purposes of Justice.
Only the national government can In
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This does not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution In
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but It does mean that there should be
1 an extension of federal activity. This
Is not advocating centralization. It Is
merely looking facts In the face, and
realizing that centralization In burlnrss
has already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized in the
national government by the constitu
tion itself. There must be no halt In
the healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
ing the last six years, as shown both in
the legislation of the congress and the
administration of the law by the de
partment of Justice. The most vital
need Is (n connection with the railroads.
As to these. In my Judgment there
should now be either a national Incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage In Interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
should be so framed ns to give to the
Interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the future issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
ever In Its Judgment It Is necessary, to
make a physical valuation of any rail
road. As I stated In my message to the
congress a year ago, railroads should
be given power to enter Into agree
ments, subject to these agreements be
ing made public la minute detail and to
the consent of tNe Interstate commerce
commission being Jlrst obtained. Until
the national government assumes
proper control of Interstate commerce.
In the exercise of the authority It al
ready possesses, It will be impossible
either to give to or to get from the
railroads full Justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognize that this control
must come; the only question Is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely exercise it. The courts will de
termine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise It, and
there will still remain ample work
within each elate for the railway com
mlfslon of that state; and the national
Interstate commerce commission will
work in harmony with the several state
commissions, each within its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired end.
Control of Interstate
Business Concerns I'rged.
"Moreover, In my Judgment there should
bo additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged In interstate business, this
control to be exercised for their own
beneoU and prosperity no less than for
the protection of investors and of the
general public. As I have repeatedly
said In messages to congress and else
where, experience has definitely shown
not merely the unwisdom bu: the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
ondltions are such that combination is
not only necessary but inevitable. It is
so In tho world of business just as It Is
so In tho world of labor, and it is as idle
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end tu combina
tions of labor. Corporation and labor
union alike have coma to stay. Kach If
properly managed Is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever In either there
Is evil, It should be promptly held to ac-
ount; but tt should receive hearty en
couragement so long as-It is properly
managed. It 13 profoundly Immoral to
put or keep on the statute books a law,
nominally in the Interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public Immorality, by undertaking to
forbid leanest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law itself provides that
Its own Infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at tho accomplishment of too much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
age. 'The antitrust law should not be re
pealed; but It should be made both more
tllelont and more in harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which dots harm to tho general public.
such amendment to bo accompanied by.
or to be an Incident of, a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these his; corporations engaged In Inter-
stale business. This should bo accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the Inspec
ting of the government otllcials. A be
ginning has already been mndo for such
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no Injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which Is on tho whole of benefit to the
public. Hut even If this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
as an cipiully objectionable feature the
difficulty nnd delay now Incident to Its
nforreinent. The government m ist now
submit to Irksome nnd repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings Instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean nn
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to Impose upon both the depart
ment of Justice and the courts un Im
possible burden; It Is not feasible tu carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, nnd not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses Incident fo the crea
tion of unhealthy and improper combina
tions, Instead of waiting until they are
in existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings. Investing I'ublle Should
lie Amply Safeguarded.
'"The congress has the power to charter
corporations to engage In Interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral dinners and new federal corpora
tions could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whither the applicant for
a federal charier was tin association or
combination will-In the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should nlso be
made for complete publicity In all matters
itffectlng the public nnd complete protec-
tlon to the Investing public and the share
holders In the matter of Issuing corporate
securities. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
Interslute corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The supervision established might
be analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At bust, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by spec I tic
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience lias shown have been of most
service In enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. Tho real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business III their own name.
The right to hold stork In other corpora
tions should heareafter be denied to Inter
stale corporations, unless nn approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockho'ders. both by the
corporation owning such stock anil by
the corporations In which such stock, is
owned.
'To confer upon the national govern
ment, In connection with the amendment
I advocate in the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business concerns
engaged in Interstate commerce, would
benefit them as It has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent buslnens
crisis It Is noteworthy thnt the Institu
tions which failed were Institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
"Natlonnl control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point of the public there I? need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonnl terminals, and
Improvements In the actual handling of
the railroads, and all this as rapidly as
posslhle. Ample, safe, and speedy trans
portation facilities nre even more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there Is need for the Investment of
money which will provide for all these
things while at th" same lime securing ss
fas ns Is possible better wages and
shorter hours for their employes. There
fore, while there must bo just and rea
sonable regulation of rates, we should be
the first to protest against any arbitrary
and unthinking movement to cut them
down without the fullest and most care
ful consideration of all Interests con
cerned and of the actual needs of the
sltuntlon. Only a special bod v of men
acting for the national government un
der uuthorlty conferred upon It by the
congress is competent to pass judgment
on such a matter.
;realer Elasticity (a
Currency Is I rgrd.
The president quotes extensively from
bU lout message In dealing with the dl-
snd
says:
"I again urge on tlie congress the need
of Immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity in our cur
rency; provided, of course, that we recog
nize tho even greater need of a safe and
secure currency. There must always be
the most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities. Provision should be
made for un emergency currency. The
emergency Issue should, of course, be
made with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully prescribed by the
government, fiueh emergency Issue must
be based on adequnto securities approved
by the government, and must be issued
under a heuvy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when the demand
for It was urgent, while securing Its re
tirement as the dehiand fell off. It is
worth Investigating to determine whether
officers and directors of rational banks
should ever bo allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should be sub
ject to the same supervision ns banks;
legislation to this effect should be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
"Yet we must also remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the business community ngalnst the
results of speculative folly any more thnn
It can guarantee an Individual against the
results of his extravagance. When an In
dividual mortgages his house to buy nn
automobile he invites disaster; and when
wealthy men, or men who pose ns such,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such, Indulge In reckless spec
ulationespecially If it Is accompanied by
Ulshnnesty they jeopardize not only their
own future but the future of all their In
nocent fdlow-cltlzens. for they expose
the whole business community to panic,
and distress."
lie advises against nny general tariff
legislation this session of congress, and
says:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth ns ours It Is probably well that
everv dozen years or so tho tariff laws
should be carefully scrutinized so ns to
see that nn excessive or Improper bene
tits are conferred thereby, thnt proper
revenue Is provided, and that our
foreign trado Is encouraged. There
must nlvtnys be as a minimum
a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference In cost of production
here and abroad; that Is. the difference In
the labor cost here nnd abroad, for the
well-being of tho wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
The question should be approached pure
ly from u business standpoint ; both the
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of ngi
tation and disturbance In tile, business
world, and to give the least play for
hellish and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause ns a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a time
It Is Impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter Is immediately after such elec
tion." ile asks for the repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
lie reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommenda ; ions for the enact
ment of federal Inheritance nnd Income
tax lavs.
Attention Is raited to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection he nsks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
are brought be strengthened und made
more definite.
The I hp nnd the
Abuse of Injunctions.
"Instances of abuse In the granting of
I it J ii in tlons In hibor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment In the minds
of those who fee that Ihelr rights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of tho attack
on the use of the process of injunction Is
wholly without warrant, but 1 am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of it there Is warrant. This ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime
Importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with It In effective man
ner, It Is certain ultimately to demand
some form of legislative action. It wouid
be most unfortunate for our social wel
fare If we should pMinit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had Just cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. 1 earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this mailer, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of In
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time It unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with, the use of the process of
Injunction by the courts, not only In la
bor disputes, but where stale laws are
onrerncd. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that It
will soon receive the consideration of tho
supremo court."
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor ho favors federal Inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to nil workmen
employed In uny way by the government,
and says:
Tho constitutionality of the employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts.
In two Jurisdictions the law has been de
clared unconstitutional, nnd In three Juris
dictions its constitutionality has been af
firmed. The question has been carried to
tne supreme court, the case has been
beard by that tribunal, and a decision Is
expected at an early dat In the event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg.
Islutlon along the lines ndvocitted in my
message to the preceding congress. The
practlco of putting the entire burden of
loss of life or limb upon the victim or
tne victim's family is a form of social In
justice In which the Fnltcd State stands
In unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have,
with few exceptions, scarcely gone
farther thnn the repeal of tho fellow
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and In some of our states even this
slight modification of a complete out
grown principle has not yet been se
cured." He favors the extension of the eight
hour law to nil departments of the gov
ernment, and to all work carried on by
the government. He urges legislation
for the compulsory Investigation of In
dustrial disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
Investigation was forcibly Illustrated
during the past summer. A strike of
telegraph operators seriously Interfered
with telegraphic communication, caus
ing great damage, to business Interests
and serious ineonvenlence to the gen
eral public. Appeals were made to mo
from many parts of the country, from
city councils, from boards of trade,
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organizations, urging that steps
lie taken to terminate tlie strike.
Kverythlng that could with any pro
priety be done by a representative of
the government was done without avail,
and for weeks the public stood by and
suffered without recourse of any kind.
Had the machinery existed and had
there been authority for compulsory
Investigation of the dispute, the public
would have been placed In possession
or the merits of the controversy, nnd
public opinion would probably have
brought shout prompt adjustment.
"It Is idle to hold that without good
rct subject of currency legislation,
laws evils such as child labor, as the
over-working of women, aa the fall- 1
ure to protect employes from loss of
life or limb, can tie effectively reached.
any more than the evils of rebates and
stock-watering can bo reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to force
honest men Into them, becauso other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
them.
Inland Waterway Systems
Should Ile Drevloped.
"The conservation of our national re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other rroblem of our
national life. We must maintain for
our civilization the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. Wo must show foresight,
we must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
present prosperity but if this prosper
ity Is used aright It Is an earnest of
future success such as no other nation
will have. Tho reward of foresight fot
this nation Is great and easily foretold.
Hut there must be the look ahead,
there must be a realization of the fact
that to waste, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust the land
Instead of using It so ff.s to Increase Its
usefulness, will result In undermining
In the days of our children the very
prosperity which we ought by right to
hand down to them amplified nnd devel
oped. For the last few years, through
several agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead nnd to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources in place of a huphuz.ird striv
ing for immediate protlt. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
sippi, with its tributaries, standing first
In importance, nnd the Columbia sec
ond, although there nre many others of
importance on the Pacific and Atlantic
and the gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work.
and I hope a beginning will be made
In the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention. From
the (ireat Uikcs to the mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterways leading
from it to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our roast lino into the
very heart of our country. It would be
of Incalculable benellt to our people. If
begun at once It can he carried through
In time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our great freight-carrying
lines of railroads The work should be
systematically and continuously carried
forward in accordance with some well
conceived plan. The main streams
tlnuihl h" Improved to the highest
point of efficiency before the improve
ment of the branches Is attempted; and
the work should be kept free from
every taint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention is called to the work of Ir
rigation nnd reclamation of govern
ment huids. In the same connection he
nsks for u revision of the public land
laws along- the lines proposed by the
public lands commission, lb lleves the
government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our forests and should In
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern 1'niteil States the
mineral fuels have already passed into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following.
It Is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and it would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so fai
ns that can still be done. What has
been accomplished In the great
fields of the Indian Territory by
action of the administration nnV

the rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else. If the i-on-giiss
will not adopt this method, tin
coal deposits should he sold under lim
itations, to conserve thorn as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to the soil.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to be worked in sufficient quan

present limitations h:iv been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render It n ssary that

Progress of the Work
On the I'nnniiin Cnnnl.
"Work on the Panama canal Is pro
ceeding In a highly satisfactory man
ner. In March the total excavation In
the Culebra Cut. wiiere effort was
chiefly concentrated, was ft 1 r, ;o cubic
yards. In April this was increased to
STlU.l!" cubic yards. There was a con
siderable decrease in the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of the rainy season and partly to
temporary trouble with the steam
shovel men over the question of wages.
This trouble was settled satisfactorily
to all parties and In July the total ex
cavation advanced materially and In
August the grand total from all points
In the canal prism by steam shovels
nnd dredges exceeded all previous
Fnltcd States records, reaching 1.271,
101 cubic yards. In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1.517.
11;! cubic yards was removed. Of this
amount 1.1S1.307 cubic yards were from
the canal prism nnd ,10.105 cubic yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved In the rainy sea
son with a rainfall In August or 11. S3
Inches and In September of 1 I.S.I Inches.
Finally, in October, the record was
again eclipsed, the total excavation be
ing 1.R6S.729 cubic yards; a Imly ex
traordinary record, especially In view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
Inches. In fact, experience during the
last two rainy seasons demonstrates
that the rains are a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed.
"Wrk m the locks and dams nt
Gatun. which began actively In March
last. has. niHunccd so far that it Is
thought that masonry work on the
locks can be begun within 15 months.
"Last winter bids were requested and
received for doing the work of cannl
construction by contract. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
were rejected. It Is tho unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
the work can be done better, more
cheaply, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors.
Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant
needed for construction has lit en pur
chased or contracted for; machine
shops have been erected and equipped
for making all needed repairs to the
plant; many thousands) of employes
have been secured; an effective organi
zation lias been perfected; a recruiting
system la In operation which Is capable
of furnishing more labor than cm be
used advantageously; employes are
well sheltered and well fed; salaries
pobl are satisfactory, and the work is
not only going forward smoothly, but
It Is producing results far In advance,
of the most sanguine anticipations.
I'nder these favorable conditions, a
change In the method of prosecuting
the work would be unwise and tinjustl
liable, for it would inevitably disorgan
ize existing conditions, chock progress,
and increase the cost und lengtbeu the
time of completing the canal.
1'rmldcnt Recommrad
Postal Savings Ranks.
"I commend to the favorible consid
eration of the congress a postal sav
ings bank system, as recommended by
the postmaster general. The primary
object Is to encourage among our peo
ple economy and thrift and by the use
of postal savings banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, particularly those who have
not the facilities at hand for depositing
their money In savings banks. Viewed,
however, from the experience of tho
past few weeks, it Is evident that the
advantages of such nn Institution are
still moro far-reaching. Timid depos
itors have withdrawn their savings for
the time being from national banks; In
dividuals have hoarded their cash snd
the workingmen their earnings; all
of which money has been withdrawn
and kept in hiding or In the safe de
posit box to tho detriment of pros
perity. Through the agency of the pos
tal savings banks such money would be
restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend to the congress
the consideration of the postmaster
general's recommendation for an ex
tension of the parcel post, especially on
the rural routes. Thrro aro now JH,
215 rural routes, serving nearly 13,000,
000 people who do not have the ad
vantages of tho Inhabitants of cities In
obtaining their supplies. These recom
mendations have been drawn up to
benellt the farmer and the country
storekeeper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I believe that It is good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to aid the small town
and the country district. It is desirable
that the country merchant should not
be crushed out.
"The fourth-class postmasters' con
vention has passed a very strong reso
lution In favor of placing the fourth
class postmasters under the clvll-scrv-Ice
law. The administration has al
reody put Into effect the policy of re
fusing to remove nny fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with the good of the service; and It Is
endeavoring so far as possible to re
move them from the domain of partisan
politics. It would be a most desirable
thing to put the fourth-class postmas
ters In the cliissitleil service."
lie renews his recommendations of
last year In regard to Alaska: calls at
lention to the admission of Oklahoma
as a state; urges the Importance of pro
viding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks
for citizenship lor Porto Kieans, and
promises submission of Secretary
Tart's report on Philippines when that
official returns.

"I'nder our form of government voting
is not merely a right but a duty, and
Moreover, a fundamental and in ssary
duty if a man Is to be a good citizen.
It Is w ell to provide that cot pal nitons
shall not contribute to presidential ur
natlonnl campaigns, nnd furthermore to
provide for tlie publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There Is,
however, always danger In laws of this
kind, which fnun their very nature aro
difficult of enforcement; the danger being
lest they lie obeyed only by the honest,
and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so
as to act only us n penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no such law would hani
pi r an unscrupulous man of unlimited
means from buying his own way Into of
fice. There Is a Very radical measure
which would, 1 believe, work a substan
tial improvement In our system of con-
lucting n campaign, although I am well
aware that It will take some time for
people to so familiarize themselves Willi
such a proposal as to he willing to con
sider Its adoption. The need for collect
ing huge campaign funds would vanish It
congress provided an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses of
each of the great national parties, an ap
propriation ample enough to meet the
necerslty for thorough organization and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then tho stipula
tion should be made that no parly re
ceiving campaign funds from the treasury
should accept more than a IIvmI amount,

Wants Improvement In the
Ocean 1 f 1 1 1 Sort Ice.
"I call your especial attention to the un
satisfactory condition of our foreign mall
service, which, because of the lack of
American steamship lilies, is now largely
done through foreign lines, and which,
particularly so far as South mid Central
America are concerned, is done In a man
ner which constitutes a serious liarrler
to the extensions of our commerce.
"The time has come, In my Judgment
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our recent commercial ami
political development. A beginning was
made by (he ocean mall ni t of March ,t.
iv.il, but even at that time the act was
known to be Inadequate In various jsir
lleulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly In our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, tho Philippines, and
lesser Islands In the Pncitlc We are
steadily prosecuting the great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantic and the pacific. To u greater
extent than seemed probably even a
dozen years ago we may look to an
American future on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past. As the first
step In that direction, nnd the step most
feasible at the present time, I recommend
the extension of the ocenn mall act of
IS'.ll. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of Its prin
ciple and purpose. It was based on theo
ries of the obligations of a great marl
time nation, undisputed In our own land
and followed by other nations since the
beginning of steam navigation. Itrlelly
those theories are, that it Is the duty of
a llrst-class power so fur as practicable
to carry Its ocean mails under Its own
ting; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mail serv
ice, nre valuable auxiliaries to the sen
power "f a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such steamships Insured
the maintenance In an efficient condition
or the shipyards In which our biUb-shlps
must be built.
"The expenditure of public money for
the performance of such necessary func
tions of government Is certainly war
runted, nor is II necessary to dwell upon
the Incidental benefits to our foreign
commerce, to the shipbuilding Industry,
and lo ship owning and navigation which
will accompany th" discharge of these
urgent public duties, though they, too,
r.hould have weight."
Asks Increase In Toy
for Army Officers mill Vem.
The president devotes much space to
the affairs of the army, and strongly
urges that our regular military organi
zation be kept up to the highest ponsible
standard of efficiency, and says:
"The medical corps should oe much
greuter than the needs of our regular
army In war. Yet at present It Is small
er than the needs of tho service demand
even In pence. Tho Spanish war oc
curred les than ten years ago. Tlie
chief loss wo suffered In it was by dls
asc among the regiments which never
left th". country. At the moment the
I nation seemed deeply Inipresjed by this
fact; yet seemingly It has alresly beet
forgotten, for not the slightest effort
has been made to prepare a medical
corps of sufficient size to prevent tlie
repetition of the same disaster on
much larger scale If we should ever bs
engaged In a serious conflict.
"But the medical department Is not ths
only department for which Increased pro
vision should be made. The rate or pay
for the officers should be greatly In
creased; there Is no higher type of citizen
than the American regular officer, and he
should have a fair reward for his ad
mirable work. There tthould be a rela
tively even greater Incrca-se In the pay for
the enlisted men. An especial provision
should be made for establishing grades
equivalent to those of warrant officers In
the navy, which should be open to the
enlisted men who serve sufficiently long
and who do their work well. Inducement
should be offered sufficient to encourage
really good men to make the army a life
occupation. The prime netyds of our pres
ent army Is to secure and retain compe
tent noncommissioned officers, inis aim
culty rests fundamentally on the ques
tion of pay. The noncommissioned officer
does not correspond with an unskilled la
borer; he corresponds to the best type of
skilled workman or to the subordinate
official in civil Institutions. Wages havs
greatly Increased In outside occupations
In the last 10 years and the pay of the
soldier, like the pay of the officers, should
be proportionately Increased. The first
sergeant of a company. If a good man,
must be one of such executive and ad
ministrative ability, and such knowledge
of bis trade, as to be worth far more than
we at present pay him. The same Is true
of the regimental sergeant major. These
men should be men who had fully re
solved to make the army a life occupa
tion and they should be able to look for
ward to nmpln reward; while only men
properly qualified should bo given a
chance to secure these final rewards. The
Increase over the present pay need not
he great In the lower grades for the first
one or two enlistments, but the Increase
should be marked for the noncommis
sioned officers of the upper grades who
serve long enough to make It evident that
they Intend to stay permanently In the
nrniy, while additional pay should bo
given for high qualifications In target
practice.
"Among the officers there should be
severe examinations to weed out th
unfit up to tho grade of major. From
that position on appointments should
be solely by selection nnd It should bo
understood that a man of merely av
erage capacity could never get beyond
the position of major, while every man
who serves In any grade a certain
length of time prior to promotion to
the next grade without getting the
promotion to the next grade should be
forthwith retired."
President Sees Need ft
Largely Increased J.
The president asks for ft continuous
Increase In the navy, und asks present
congress for appropriations for four
new battleships, and says:
"We need always to remember that
In time of war the navy Is not to be
used to defend harbors nnd sea-coast
cities; we should perfect our system of
coast formications. I lie only euicieni
for the navy In for offense, i no
only way In which It ran efficiently pro
tect our own coast against tne possnu
action of a foreign navy Is by destroy
ing that foreign navy. For defense
against n hostile fleet which actually
attacks them, the const cities must de
pend upon their forts, mines, torpeuoes,
submarines nnd torpedo bunts and de
stroyers. All of these together lire ef
ficient for defensive purposes, but they
In no way supply the place of a thor
oughly efficient navy capable of actln
on the offensive: for parrying never yet
won a light tt can only bo won by
hard biting, and an aggressive sea-going
navv alone can do this hard hittln'
of the 'offensive tvp P.ut the forts
nnd the like nre n ssary so that tho
navy may be footloose. In tlni" of war
thero Is sure to be demand, under pres
sure of fright, for the ships to be scat
tered so as to defend all kind ol ports,
t'n.ler penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must he n-l'iio 'l. The ships
must he kept together, and their ob
jective made the enemies' fleet. If
fortifications arc sufficiently strong, nu
modern navy will venture to ntta.-K
them, so long as the foe has In exist
ence a hostile navy of anything liko
tlie same size or efficiency. I'.nt unless
there exists sm h a navy then the forti
llcatlons are powerless by themselves
lo secure the victory. For of course
the nnre ibii.lincy means that any
resolute enemy can at his leisure com
bine all his forces upon one point wltli
the certainly that he can take it.
I.lvrn llensons for Despatch
(It Fleet lo the PnclHc.
Tntil our battle tl.-et Is much lartrer
than at present It should never be split
Into detachments so far apart that tlo-y
could not in event of emergency b.
speedily united. Our coast line Is on
the Pacille just as much an on the At
lantic. The Interests of California,
Oregon and Washington are ns em
phatically the Interests of the whole)
union ns those of Maine and New York,
of Louisiana and Texas. Tho battle
fleet should now and then be moved to
the Pacific, Just ns nt other times it
should be kept In the Atlantic. When
the Isthmian canal is built the transit
of the battle fleet from one ocean ti
the other will be comparatively easy.
Fntll It is built I earnestly hope that
the battle fleet will be thus shifted be
tween the two oceans every year or
two. The marksmanship on nil our
ships ha.i Improved phenomenally dur
ing the last five years, l.'ntll within
the last two or three years it was not
possible to train a battle fleet In squad
ron maneuvers under service conditions,
and it Is only during: these last two or
three years that the training under
these conditions has become really ef
fective. Another nnd most necessary
stride In advance Is now being taken.
'I he battle fleet Is about starting by
the Straits of Magellan to visit the
Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships aro
going under the command of Hear Ad
miral Kvans. whll- eight armored
cruisers and two other battleships will
meet him at San Francisco, whither
certain torpedo destroyers are aIso go
ing. No fleet of such size has ever
made such a voyage, nnd it will be of
very great educational use to all en
gaged In it. Tin only way by which to
teach officers and men how to handle
the fleet so ns to meet every possible,
strain ami enorgency in time of war Is
to have them practice under similar
conditions in time of peace. Moreover,
the only way to find out mtr actual
needs is to. perform in time of peace
whatever mea.-uvers might be neces
sary in time of war-. After war Is de
clared It is too late to Ami otit thw
needs; thnt ronns lo Invite disaster.
The trip to the pacific will show what
some of our needs nre and will enable
us to provide for them. The prop f
place for nn oiTlet r tu b-.trn his 'ut
is at si a. and the only way in which a
navy erm ever be made efficient Is by
practice at sea. under all the condi
tions which would Iav to be met If
war existed.
