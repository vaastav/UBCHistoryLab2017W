ISpecial Dispatch to The Call]
WASHINGTON. Dec* }3.—When
President Taft'a message on
the tariff goes to congress
next week, it will precipitate
a long- and hard struggle between the
demo ! republicans, who, for
rst time in many years, will put
on the legislative scales the protective
theory as opposed to a tariff for
revenue only.
It was learned authoritatively yes
terday that the tariff board's report.
which shortly will reach congress, will
show that while substantial reductions
Can be made in various Hems of the
wool bill, the average re.lin'tioii can not
• y great if the protective prin
ciple is to be maintained.
It also was stated that evidence is
in the report that justifies the
contention of protection republicans
that all duties should he estimated on
the specific r;ith»'r than on the ad valo
rem 1
Senate to Smother House
Among the republicans, of the senate
it virtually has been determined- that
if the ways and means committee of
the house, under . democratic control,
sends over a wool bill which disregards
the report of the tariff board the meas
". tire will be ignored and virtually a new
bill prepared. The democratic measure,
"of course, will he used as the basis for
the republican revision.
It is. the. understanding of jsever^l
#nf the regular republican leaders'ln the
. senate that the insurgents will not be so
radical in their demands for alow tariff,
but will aid in any movement that has
as its object the passage of a protec
• tion bill. The republicans have but a
majority of four and it will need only
three desertions to upset any program
■ of the protectionists.
The last few years have been fraught
With many tariff struggles, but there
lias been no cleancut tight between the;
bare principle of the protection and
the idea of a tariff for revenue only.
The, sole question in the recent years
has been the extent of the reduction of
duties. . ;■;
Democrats Will Be Forced
**' Accepting for the sake of argument
' that a certain "amount of ; protection
was needed, the, democrats and Insur
gents have contented themselves with
the contention that the Dingley and
Payne bills granted entirely too much ]
protection. The democrats have not
pushed their tariff for revenue only
Idea to the front very vigorously.
At the. present sessions, however, the
democrats will be forced into a position
•where they will.have to declare them
selves unalterably opposed to the prin
ciple of protection or else accept the
recommendation of President Taft.
The republican leaders will be will
ing to have a wool bill passed if the
spirit of the ; protective principle is
maintained. They expect to have the
co-operation of the Insurgents, but un
. less they win the support of every
member of that faction of ; the party
the democrats again will pass their
own bill and President Taft probably
«*»* ill veto It, as he has said that he will
veto, any bill that disregards the pro
tective principle in the tariff.

HAMMOND, Ind., Dec. 15.—Nicholas
Foster, an aged crossing- tender for the
Erie railroad, saved three lives at the

in Hysterics
NEW YORK. Die. 1 •"■>.- A verdict of
"not guilty'" was returnrrl late today,
freeing: LiHlan Graham and Ethel Con
rad of criminal charges on which they
had been held since last .Tune for shoot
ing the millionaire sportsman and hotel
proprietor. W. E. D. Ptokes. The jury
reached its verdict in slightly less than
one hour.
"When summoned to hear the verdict.
Miss Graham appeared unstrung and
was assisted into the court room. Miss
Conrad came unassisted.
When the girls faced the foreman he
announced the words "not guilty." Miss
Conrad cried "thank God." sank to the
counsel table then jumped up again
shrieking and tearing her hair and
throwing her arms about wildly. It
was a surprise to the spectators, for
Miss Conrad had kept much the bet
ter nerve of the two defendants
throughout the trial.
Miss Graham, who Bobbed when ehe
heard the verdict, recovered, and acted
the comforter to her younger friend.
It was at first thought that Miss Con
rad had misunderstood the verdict and
her companion tried to assure her that
they were free.
"Oh, I know," she said. "Tell moth
er we are free. Tell her we are com
ing home."
Assistant District Attorney Buckner
referred to the contention of counsel
for the defense that Stokeß could not
be punished and that the girls had been
punished, saying:
"Perhaps if is no punishment for a
man with a six months* bride and a 14
year old son to have such things
ha\vkc><l about. And how have these
girls been punished? While Stokes was
nursing his wounds they hung his
bloody trousers outside of a theater and
askr-d the public to deposit its money
in the box office."
Favorable word as to Stokes.' condi
tion was given out late today. He has
not been told of the verdict.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec, 15.—Dr. Wil
Ham Furness, the psychologist of Wai

succeeded in educating two female
chimpanzees to such a degree of intelli

most remarkable reasoning power. To
further his investigations, Doctor Fur

purpose. He wishes to ascertain if the
offspring will retain the intelligence of
their parents.
The chimpanzees have been on the
estate of Dr. If. H. Furness, fath'-r of
the psychologist, and have been under
daily instruction until they have at
tained a degree of mentality surpass
ing that of a large percentage of defi

from their native environment when
young and up to the present have been
segregated, living in a truly "intel

The experiments prove that the mon

really think. There have been so many

WOOL GROWER PROPOSES
PLAN FOR CHEAP CLOTHES
Factory to Make Goods for Sale
to Consumers
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 15. —The estab
lishment by the National Wood Grow
ers' association of a factory for the
manufacture of woolen goods, so as to
give consumers "better goods at lower
prices," was the proposition of Magnus
Brown, president of the Minnesota
Wool Growers' association, in an ad
dress before the association today.
Brown said the prevalent impression
that the present high cost of clothing
was due to the duty on wool was er
roneous. He said:
"Wool is the only agricultural prod
uct not increasing in price. While our
industry languishes, the steel, oil,
lumber and mining industries prosper.
While we are in fear of bankruptcy,
the greatest consumers of our product
are continuing 1 to pay their regular di
vidends."
A. D. Potter, associate forester of the
United States, said that the govern
ment desired to regulate, not prevent,
the grazing of sheep on forest re

PICTURES TELL
STORY OF CRIME
Jury Trying Rumball Case Hear
Damaging Testimony Against
Alleged Slayers
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
OROVILLK, Dec. I".—Grewsome
pictures of the body of little Helen
lUnnball. bearing the marks of the
rope with which she was bound on the
neck, ■wrists and ankles, were shown
to the. Jury today in the case of Arthur
Lewis, who, with hi? sister, Mrs. Emma
Rumball. is charged with the murder
of the girl.
The pictures also showed the garret
in which she was bound for hours on a
swelteringly hot day in June. These
photographs mailo a most visible im
pression upon the jury, who conferred
together while viewing them, pointing
out to one another their salient fea
tures.
The most important witness of the
day was Dr. L. I>. Thompson, one of
the physicians who performed the au
topsy. Doctor Thompson testified that
death was due to a double dislocation
of the neck. One of the dislocations,
he said, was of the ordinary kind,
while the other was a most unusual
ras.', there being but five of *a like
kind recorded in the history of medi
cine Tliis latter dislocation, he stated,
could only be accomplished by a twist
ing, turning force.
Thompson said he did not believe
that it was possible for the girl to
have Inflicted this injury by simply
throwing herself from a low box. The
most plausible explanation, he main
tained, was that her head had been
sharply Jerked and at the same time
twisted. In her weakened condition,
where the power of resistance was
gone, it would be possible for a man
with liis hands to have caused this
injury.
Realizing the importance of the evi
dence, Attorney Kennedy for the de
fense attempted to get from him a
statemenlt that if such had been the
case there would be external markings
of the hand left. The witness refused
to make this statement, however, stat
ing that, owing to the fact that the
hands were no harder han the head, it
would be extremely improbable that
there would be any external evidence
of the imprint of the hands.
When court adjourned Thompson was
still under cross examination. The case
went over until Monday.

SCHOOL TO COMPETE
WITH PUBLIC DANCES
Chicago Board Opens Buildings
for Evening Frolics
CHICAGO, Dec. 15.—Pupils, graduates
and working boys and girls last night
flocked to four public school houses,
where they engaged in many forms of
amusement.
The evening marked the inauguration
of the school board's .plan for turning
over the schools to the people for social
amusement. The Idea of the board was
that the plan would have a tendency
to overcome the evils of the public
dance hall.
At three of the schools the young
people danced. At all of the schools the
plan was declared a success.
Of Providence, R. t., was re-elected
president without opposition.
There were 12 nominees for the six

was so divided that the result will not
be known until tomorrow.

Supreme Ju&tice Max Sloss, when in
formed last night that she had been
n-ominated as. a director of the Nations]

.that she did not care agsffl to accept

WOMAN IS ACCUSED
IN POISONING PLOT
Three Sons and Husband Die
Mysteriously; Physician
Is Held
BAD AXE, Mich., Dec. 15.— After a
sensational climax of his preliminary
examination, Dr. Robert A. McGregor
of. Übly, charged with the murder of
Cyril Sparling of Übly, was today
bound over without bail to the circuit
court.
Miss Margaret Gibbs of Port Huron,
the nurse, charged with being an ac
cessory after the fact, waived exam-
inatlon. The last witness for the pros
ecution was Sheriff, Donald McAuley of
Huron county. McAuley swore out the
complaint for Doctor MacGregor's ar
rest and then made the arrest.
In his testimony he said that after
the inquest to determine the cause of
Cyril Sparling's death he talked with
Doctor MacGregor, and the latter asked
him if the authorities were going to
exhume the other Sparling bodies. Four
members of the family, three sons and
the father, died of a suspicious ailment.
" 'If you do,' Doctor MacGregor said
to me," Sheriff McAuley said, " I know
you will find poison. If you fellows
will take up Albert Sparling and find
arsenic in him T know of a man who
can make Mrs. Sparling confess.'
■"I said, 'for God's sake, why don't
you get busy; that's just what we
want." MacGregor answered. "I would
have •to look in the fiias.s to find
him.'
At the conclusion of the sheriffs tes
timony, Doctor MacGregor and his law
yers held a conference, after which his
attorney said they wanted a full in
vestigation before a jury.
Sheriff McAuley said tonight that a
warrant would be served on Mrs. John
Wesley Sparling tomorrow charging
her with poisoning her son Cyril.

LOS ANGKLKS. Dec, I".—Miss
Tillie McCarty, stenographer for
Olaf A. Tveitmoe of San Fran
cisco, secretary of the State
Building. Trades council, was a. wit
ness before the federal grand jury
this-evening: for a half hour. At the
end of-her examination the jury unex
pectedly adjourned, although . there
were several other witnesses -waiting
to be called.
■When .Miss McCarty's examination
was. concluded it was reported unoffi
cially that Tveitmoe and Anton Johon
sen, organizer of the state building
trades council, might not be called as
witnesses before the grand jury. Both
men are under subpena, and have wired
that they will arrive in v San Francisco
from the east tomorrow afternoon. It
was "believed until this .evening that
they would be summoned to appear in
Los Angeles.
Can Demand Right
They will have the right, / it; is con-,
tended,,"'.to demand that they be taken
before the grand jury which is in
vestigating the alleged nationwide
dynamite conspiracy which included
the actions of the McNamara brothers.
However, it is the law that a forced
examination before a grand jury might
moan immunity from indictment.
When the grand jury adjourned to
night it was to meet again tomorrow
morning, when it is expected that in
dictments,will be voted, but not issued
before Monday morning. That action
may end the local investigation. ..
Judge Olin, Wellborn of the United
States district court, to which the
grand jury reports, took adjournment
today until Monday morning. That
precludes the possibilities of indict
ments being returned before next week.
Henry Wills, 923 Haight street. San
Francisco, was the first witness: called
before the grand jury today. He tes
tified for more than an hour. Wills
was the cafe singer to whom .T. B. Mc-
Namara gave $60 for 60 repetitions of a
favorite ballad.
Munsey Is Angry
"They may put me in jail for con-
tempt of court, but they'll never get me
before that grand jury unless they use
force and then I will refuse to tell any
thing, 1 said J. E. Munsey of Salt LAke
tonight, the union leader, at whose
home J. B. MdN'amara stayed for 10
days subsequent tothe dynamiting of
the TimeK.
Munsey was angry at the reports
that he had "confessed" to Oscar Law
ler.
"I'm going to refuse to testify on
the ground that I might incriminate,
myself, but I'm not going before the
grand jury willingly,' he added.
A square canvass and a leather case
ten inches squaiv and as tall as a
small ice cream freezer was shown the
jury today. This case, and others like
it, are said to have been used in carry
ing dynamite about the country needed
for various "jobs'.''
Like McManigal's
It was such a case that Ortie E. Mc-
Manigal carried when, according to his
own statement, he came west to blow
up the Llewellyn Iron works, and Ortle
was so accustomed to its presence that
he gave it to a porter, giving him also
a dollar to take care of it. Presumably
In cqnnection with the appearance of
the dynamite case came B. J. Crosby,
now of L.os Angeles, but formerly of
Boston, Mass. Crosby used to be con-
