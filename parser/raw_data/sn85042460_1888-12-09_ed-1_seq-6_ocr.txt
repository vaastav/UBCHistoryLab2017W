THAT FAMOUS TARRIFF MESSAGE
The True Nlory of How President
Cleveland Came to Send It to Hon-
Cress.
The inside history of the tariff reduc
tion message sent to Congress by the
President last December has not yet
been written and it is of some interest.
Indeed, in view of the defeat of Mr.
Cleveland and of the opinion of a large
number of persons, right or wrong, that
the result was due to the tariff message,
it is desirable that the people should be
informed of all the circumstances con
nected with that new departure of the
administration.
President Cleveland is the putative
father of the child, but the real author
of its being is Mr. Manton Marble. For
twenty years Mr. Marble has been eager
to force tariff reform into politics as a
distinctive issue. He devoted much
time to the task of bringing the Presi
dent round to his views of the political
revolution, which would sweep over the
Western States if the Democracy only
had the courage and sense to make
• bold fight on the tariff issue; not
through a meaningless plank in a
convention platform, but through agres
sive action on the part of the President,
who would unquestionably be the candi
date of the party for re-election and
would thus compel the recognition of the
issue in the contest, Mr. Marble pointed
ont the position held on the question by
Western newspapers and Western poli
ticians, and quoted the World as favoring
tariff revision and tax reduction so earn
estly as to urge a special session of Con
gress for the consideration of that impor
tant policy.
Mr. Cleveland was not entirely con
vinced by Mr. Marble's argument, but
was disposed to believe that they had
gome strength and well deserved consid
eration. Mr. Marble found an effective
ally in Mr. Henry Watterson, who sup
plemented the appeal of his friend in his
own impulsive and impetuous manner.
Meanwhile members of the Cabinet were
approached and urged to favor the
proposition of a Presidential message,
stripped bare of all outside adornments,
and placed before Congress and
the country as a naked tariff
revision proposition from the consider
ation of which neither parly, nor any
individual of either party, could escape.
In a short time afterwards Mr. Marble
laid before the President his draft of a
message such as he advised. This was
the origin of the much-discussed docu
ment which in the opinir.n of many per
sons settled the Presidential contest. As
transmitted to Congress there were some
changes from Mr. Marble's composition,
but the main features were preserved,
and in some of the idiomatic expressions
the ex-editor's style can be easily recog
nized.
While these discussions were going on
Secretary Whitney was indisposed and
absent from Washington. On his return
to the capital shortly before the assem
bling of Congress lie received a letter
from the President, who expressed a de
sire to see him as soon as possible. Sec
retary Whitney called at the White
House, and in a private interview with
Mr. Cleveland the latter submitted to
bim the draft of his proposed message,
which was then prepared. The revela
tion was a surprise and shock to the Sec
retary, whose keen perception and accu
rate political information at once suggest
ed to him that, however wise and com
mendable the propositions might be
in the abstract, it was not the right time
to cast them upon the country. He
frankly expressed these views to the
President as the first impressiou made
on his mind by the message. Mr. Cleve
land was evidently considerably sur
prised and disappointed at the position
taken by the Secretary. He told Mr.
Whitney that the messaga had already
been discussed by the Cabinet, and that
his remarks were the first hostile expres
sions he had heard in regard to it. He
desired that the Secretary would take a
little time to reflect on the matter and
see if he could not find reasons to war
rant a change in the views he then ex
pressed.
At this interview Mr. Whitney at once
discovered and pointed out to the Presi
dent one important instance in which
the alleged facts were not correct, and
the reasoning built up on them was
fallacious and open to destructive criti
cism. The Presinent was surprised at
the information, and made a note of it
for inquiry. Mr. Whitney was found to
be right and the message was modified
accordingly. The Cabinet was then
called together in a special meeting, at
which the message was again
considered, Mr. Whitney and all
the members being present. The
discussion which ensued was warm and
Srolonged. Reflection seemed only to
aye confirmed Mr. Whitney's views of
the inexpediency of the policy, and when
he spoke he expressed his opposition in
no uncertain terms. He believed it was
most injudicious to give the Republicans
any issue such as they most desired, and
•which they had repeatedly tried to falsely
force on the Democracy when they were
searching anxiously, and up to that time
vainly, for a war cry. He insisted that
the merits and justice of the policy
recommended in the message had no
part in the discussion; that the real
point was whether it was judicious to
urge the policy on the eve of a Presiden
tial election, when there would not be
time enough at command of the party to
combat prejudice, to overthrow false
charges and to educate the minds of the
working people up to an understanding
of their true interests. Mr. Whitney in
sisted that without this direct issue in
the approaching canvass the opposition
would have nothing to do but to make a
fight by attacks on the general policy
and character of the administration, and
on this there could be no question of
their defeat. The result would be the
vindication of the Administration, and
its patriotism and integrity would become
historical through the discussions of the
canvass. Mr. Whitney urged the policy
of first winning the battle and then
securing the forms and relief sought dur
ing the four years of the next issue.
The other members of the Cabinet op
posed Mr. Whitney's position, and urged
the expediency of the message at the
time. But it was reserved for Mr. Vilas
to assail Mr. Whitney's views with a
force which encroached on the limits of
courtesy. The flowery orator from Wis
consin talked flippantly about the objec
tionable character ot cowardice in in
politics, and accused | his colleague of
want of manliness in his temporizing
and "expediency" policy. In his calm
reply, Mr. Whitney remarked that he
had never heard that prudence in plan
ning a campaign was a mark of cowardice
or recklessness and bravado indications
of courage. He had heard it somewhere
■aid that discretion is the better part of
valor, and certainly it was not an evi
dence either of discretion or common
sense to cast down your fortifications and
open a clear path for the enemy into the
heart of the citadel just before a battle
for existence. Mr. Whitney was left
alone, however, in his condemnation of
the message as ill-timed, inexpedient
and full of danger for the party.
It was determined that the message
should be sent to Congress; but on the
night of the Cabinet meeting Mr. C'~
THE LOS ANGELES DAILY HERALD: SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1888.
land was in consultation with his private
secretary until 2 o'clock in the morning.
He was greatly disturbed by the position
Mr. Whitney had taken, having always
regarded him as the shrewdest political
adviser and the best equipped states
man in the Cabinet. Finally he threw
the message from him in an irri
table outburst and declared that it
was too late to retreat. The mci*
sage was sent in. It did not enable Mr.
Villas or Mr. Endicott to decrease tl c
Republican majorities in their States. It
lost New York to Mr. Cleveland, de
spite Secretary Fairchild's confident pre
dictions to the contrary.
No one believes that Mr. Manning, al
though like Mr. Whitney an honest
friend of tariff reform and reduction,
would have endorsed the policy of the
President's message as the opening gun
of the campaign. The steady return fire
opened by Mr. Blame from the other
side of the ocean is said to have been
the first eye-opener the President got to
enable him to see the wisdom of Mr.
Whitney's position.—[N. Y. World.
SKETCHES FROM REAL LIFE.
The Persistent Resit nlna Which
Has Enabled Quay to Constant,
ly Change Offices.
When Quay was elected to the United
States Senate, says tne Philadelphia
Record, one of his friends rashly pre
dicted that his record as a"resigner was
ended, as he would never relinquish his
Senatorial seat. Iv a long life of office
holding the Senator lias never filled out
his term in any position except that of
Representative in the Legislature from
Beaver county. The politicians gener
ally feel confident that he will now have
a chance of resigning his seat in the
Senate for a place in Harrison's Cabinet,
and there is a good deal of speculation
as to whether he will embrace the op
po'tunity.
Quay's first oflice was that of prothon
otary of Beaver county, which he re
signed in 1861 to enter the army as a
lieutenant. Before his regiment was or
dered to the field he resigned his lieu
tenancy to become assistant commissar)
eeneral, with the rank of colonel, on
Governor Curtin's Btaff. This placa he
soon resigned to become Governor Cur
tin's private secretary. In this capacity
he served for one year, when he also re
signed it, and was made colonel of the
One Hundred and Thirty-fourth Penn
sylvania Infantry. At Autietain Colonel
Quay was stricken with typhoid fever,
and, after he had somewhat recovered,
upon the advice of his physicians he re
signed from tbe army. Soon afterward
he was appointed by Governor Curtin
Pennsylvania's military agent at Wash
ington. In 1863 the legislature created
the oftice of military secretary to the
Governor and Colonel Quay resigned his
place at Washington to accept the secre
taryship which Governor Curtin prompt)y
offered him. In 1860 he was elected to
the State Legislature as a member of tbe
lower bouse, and at once presented Gov
ernor Curtin with his resignation of tbe
secretaryship in order to take his seat in
the House of Representatives. That is
the single occasion in his official life that
Colonel Quay filled out his term without
resigning. Curiously enough, in 1867 he
was Governor Curtin's candidate for
Speaker of the House in the combination
against Simon Cameron in his fight for
the United States Senatorsbip. Quay
was defeated, and Cameron won the
Senatorsbip.
The next public office which Quay
filled after his legislative experience was
that of Secretary of tbe Commonwealth,
to which he was appointed by General
Hartranft upon the latter's first election
to the Governship. But it appeared to
be Colonel Quay's fate to keep un re
signing, for he left the Secretaryship to
accept the Recordership of Philadelphia,
an office which was suppose to be worth
$100,000 a year. While be was Recorder
he was widely spoken of for the Uuited
States Senatorship soon to be filled, but
he at that time declined to enter the con
test, remarking to a friend, "I can wait."
Even the large emoluments of the Re
cordership could not hold the colonel for
a full term, and he resigned this place to
accept the Secretarship of the Com
monwealth under Governor Hoyt. He
held on to that office until nearly tbe end
of Governor Hoyt's term, but when the
Governor hurled his famous "Wolsley
letter" into the heated political fight
which resulted in the election of Gov
ernor Pattisou, Colonel Quay promptly
wrote Governor Hoyt a letter'of resigna
tion and left the office.
Colonel Quay was elected State Treas
urer in 1885, and held that oflice until the
summer of 1887, when he resigned this
place in view of his election to tho United
States Senate. The Senatorship which
Quay now holds is a big prize to resign,
but in the present situation of affairs it is
not improbable that he may even drop
this for a cabinet office.
Extraordinary Increase in the Pro
duction of Cigarettes.
During October tax was paid on some
;hing over 207,000,000 cigarettes, which
swells the total for the firßt ten months
jf the year to 1,071,000,000. It is appar
snt that with even an average manufac
;ure for the next two months the total
r or the year will very easily reach 2,000,
--100,000 cigarettes. This would be 1,000,
--100,000 more than in 1884—four years
tgo—Boo,ooo,ooo more than 1885—three
rears ag0—500,000,000 more than 1880—
two years ago—and 200,000,000 more than
last year,lßß7.This gives a faint idea of the
3uoimous increase that, has and is oc
jurring in these "little smokes." On
the basis of 2,000,000,000 tax paid in
1888, it would mean the consumption of
almost 5,500,000 every day of the year,
and the daily increased consumption
aver 1887 would be about 571,000. These
2,000,000,000 cigarettes, if placed end to
end, would go almost four times around
the globe, and if you wished to build
'railroad tracks" of them you could
construct twelve lines from the Atlantic
to the Pacific ocean, using them
every three inches for sleepers, or
ties, too. Is it any wonder that cigars
have shown comparatively little increase
in consumption in late years, for cigar
ettes, whicn have been doubled in con
sumption in the short space of four years
must certainly find many of their ad
mirers in the ranks of cigar smokers.
Besides the 2,000,000 000 that will be
consumed at home, 200,000,000 will be
shipped abroad, making the total output
3f not more than one dozen firms (and
most of it by one-half dozen) in one year
the enormous amount of 2,200,000,000 or
oyer.—[Western Tobacco Journal, Cin
cinnati.
I haven't seen Miss Gushy since I re
turned from Europe," remarked young
(shallow. "I wonder what she will think
of the mustache I have raised?" "If
she is as affectionate as she used to be to
me, returned young Merritt, "I should
say she would be tickled to death."—
