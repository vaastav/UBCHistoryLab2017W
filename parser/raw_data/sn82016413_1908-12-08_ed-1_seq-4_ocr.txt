TUESDAY , DECEMBER 8, 1908
Mr. Cooke's proposal to let every man In the Chamber of Commerce
have Ills full say on the coastwise shlppinK law suspension Is very proper.
We, howecr, doubt that there will be further change, of nttltiule on this
subject. The compelling argument for refusal to tamper with the present
law U that Hawaii shoulil be last to force an overthrow of the principles
of Protection. The coastwise law Is its miioh a part of the scheme of
protection as tho tariff schedule on foreign Imports. The argument for
the passage of the mall subsidy at the present session of Congress is
stronger than for n special exception for this Territory In tho coastwise
law.
THE MESSAGE
i President Roosevelt' message luted.
its relutlon to the Nation its a whole All through his Interesting chap
Is n reiteration of the doctrines, tbdi1"1' "" nriitliiiiii. the courts.
. , , , mid labor we find the American Idea
alms, and the aspirations of his Ad- . ... .. ,.,, !.,, , ..
mlnistiatlou.
In Its special reference to tho Tct
rltory of Hawaii the message is par
ticularly vigorous and pointed.
Though the President proposes noth
ing new, he has touched on the vital
necessities for the development of
these Islands as n strong outpost
transportation, immigration, and for-
tlllcatlon.
After reading the recommendation
for thu suspension of tho coastwise
shipping law, wo may better under
stand why the Governor cabled hU
regrets over tho action of the bull
ness organizations in revoking their
upprovnl of the bill embodying tho
amendment for Hawaii in particular.
The President goes at tho BUbJect
of our needs in his usual Incisive and
forceful style. He directs attention,
to the cessation of oriental Immigra
tion and tho opportunity for Internal
development with a citizen popula
tion. To uphold the prosperous con
ditions of the Territory und nt tho
same time build on right lines for the
futuro we must have ample transpor
tation facilities, improved harbors,
and a free hand for securing labor
from thu mainland and Europo,
Tho conference of Territorial offi
cers held yesterday with Secretary
Garfield on European Immigration
was obviously n preparation for car
rying out the suggestion mado by tho
President and presented to Congress
today.
Every detail of the message Is
pithy and well worth careful perusal.
That portion In which ho deals with
tho corporations, the railroads, nnd
the laboring men will, under present
conditions of public mind, attract tho
widest attention.
One reading his schemo for tho con
trol of tho railroads of the country
cannot fall to observe tho lnllucnco
the Chicago traction strugglo has had
on the Chief Executive. It may bo a
coincidence, but tho President in ad
vocating control of corporation-owned
railroads rather than destruction
and Government ownership, has fol
lowed what Chicago found a practical
solution, ns set forth in tho state
ment of the. situation given by Miss
Tarbcl In tho American Magazine.
The President demands In effect
that the railroads shall bo sufficiently
controlled by the Government to tako
them outside the field of exploitation
for tho benefit of swollen fortunes
und tho oppression of tho people
through rebates and unfair dealing
with employees. He would have tho
Federal Government supremo In
handling Inter-Stato commerce. Ho
would not rob n single Investor of
ono cent of legitimate profit. He
would atsuro tho employe a good
wage. Ho would guarantee satisfac
tion for tho public by a full puljllc
fctatcment of tho affairs of tho cor
poration, that tho peoplo may know
exactly the condition under which
the roads nro operating and whero
the money is going.
This Is Intensely practical. It has
proved successful In ono of tho great
municipalities. And the principle in
volved is ono bo meaty with good
hard business senso that It might well
expand to the National field.
In matters of National finance It
la Interesting to note that taking tho
full period of Mr. Iloosevelt's eervlco
ns, President, tho country finds Itself
many millions ahead, tho National
debt reduced, und the Interest ac
count cut down.
It is In his mornllzatlon over the
attitude oMho reactionaries 'of high
finance and' the radicals of labor nnd
socialism that the Rooseveltlan abil
ity to volco the,Mntlmentiottho aw
erage, common-sonso citizen Is mail;

act phrase he has made famous Is lit
tle used, It nt all. Tho President
calls for tho highest respect to bo
paid the Judges on the bench, but hu
believes that the courts should Inter
pret law with a view to the advanc
ing spirit of the times and some
thought for the future. He objects
to calling tho judges und the courts
names, while reminding the courts
and the Judges that they should be
In some degree amenable to settle 1
public opinion.
The chapter on preservation of tho
forests is n liberal education to the
man who thoughtlessly or criminally

It is worth while for local sup
porters of Government by Commu
nion to note that when speaking of
the Philippines, tho President first
points with pride to tho large meas
ure of self-government that lias been
granted the Filipinos and' of which
they have found thcmsolvcs capable.
blllty to defend yourself is the
greatest ugent for peaco, according to
our President. This sticks out all
through his reference to tho Army,
tho Navy, and the Natlonnl Guard.

peacemakers, we bcllcvo Roosevelt Is
right.
Ills crltlclBm ot mechanical promo
tion in tho Army and Navy Is sound
At the same time there are thousands
of his fellow-countrymen who bcllcva
that the President did many loyal
end patriotic men a great wrong
when he boosted his friend Wood
over the heads of proved, able, und.
educated fighters. That pleco of rad
icalism may have the effect of hold
ing back needed reform many year.
The call for an Increased Navy
ought to be listened to with more
consideration than when ours was n
Navy In port nnd the people knew
little of it or of its relation with ot'.i
pr nations.
No one will dispute the President
that the world-tour ot the battleship
fleet was one of the greatest events
of our history.
Taken as a whole, the message,
may be reckoned us exceptionally
calm for n Roosevelt state paper.

"The problem of tho City and Coun
ty of Honolulu Is ono ot importance
In my opinion. It Is customary in
a great many places to have tho City
and County In one government unit,
but thero are many special difficulties
here. I went out pheasant hunting
tho other day, Bot out of tho nuto-
nioblle to shoot a bird and tho feath
ered creature ran away, and I'could
n't find a policeman to, get it. The
problems here nre certainly varied. I
understand tho mongoose are bo thick
that the rats have to roost on tno
telephone poles, llut. seriously, I
think the city of Honolulu should be
confined In entailer limits. In tho
States in tho line ot municipal prog
ress, tho city is the most Important
government unit there Is. Tho best
results come where there is the larg
est home rule. The best results can
not be achieved in a city and county
consolidated government.
"I met the captain ot tho Mongolia
yesterday, and ho suggested that I
cpeak on tho coastwise shipping laws.
Ho suggested that I say that tho most
Important thing is that "Ships keep
off.the grass," or rocks. This means,
of courso, that mora lighthouses bo
provided In order that tho ships cun
properly keep off tho grass. By the
way. I think that If our friend Hobson
would confine tho work of his mouth
to kissing and conversation, thero
would be less trouble In the world.
"I have been greatly interested in
the development of your Anglo-Saxon
civilization In tho Islands. I presume
you Incltido Portugueso and Porto Rlc

that you would prefer that thlH Terri

accomplish this, is a big problem. In

chanco nt it. You know moro about
this than I do, though. However, it
beems hhvlous that tho islands are but

ures that havo been furnished me by
Mr..Farrington.
'II' don't lKdftne In the total sanctity
ot tho tnriff protection. Tho Idea of

And 1 tblnl before you tako up tho
question ot subsidizing ships, tho tar

American shipbuilders could compete

here, anil I .behove that, by develop

for the pineapple, and it will become
almost a hbuschohl necessity. And I
must say that much can bo hoped for
