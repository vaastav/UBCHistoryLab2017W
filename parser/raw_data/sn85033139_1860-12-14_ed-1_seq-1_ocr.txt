election of any man to office is not just
eaue for a dissolution of the Inion The
antecedeo-s of the Pre-idem elect are cal-
ulater] to excite fears in South Carolina,
but is fl.e question of contingent danger
•uffrient to jus’ify the (h rx-tion o< the
Government! He rcvvv- the ar ts of the
'! ffcrerit Nort he l n'-’ate- in the pa of
personal i^>*-ty Li.is. and pronounce*
them unconstitutional. He savs that it
chon and t ot be presumed in a Ivance that,
the President elect will fail to enf< rce the
Fugitive Slave Law, as this would be un
just and contrary to Christian charity. Let
us wait for the overt act. He then de j
dares against the right.of secession, and
says to admit it, the Union tn ghi I.* brok- i
en into fragments in two week- Hr* quotes
the language of .Ja< k-on and Madi-on.—
■Secession is altogether founded on .m in
ference in the ('• uistirnti'ifi
The Union was designed to be rerpe’u
ated. lie then quotes the Constitution in
support of this view- The framers of the
Constitution never intended to plant in its
bosom seeds for its own destruction. They
were not unmindful of the absurdity of
providing for its own dissolu’ion. The
right of resistance against tvrann- and op
pression, however, cannot be denied T his
right is asserted in the Declaration of In
dependence, bnt secession is neither more
nor less than revolut’- n He speaks of j
the atfairs of South Carolina He does !
not apprehend that an attempt will be
made to seize the fort, but if in this he is
mistaken, the officers have orders to act
-ti icily on the defensive. Let the respon
sibiiitv rest on the hands of those who
provoke the contest He invokes bis
countrymen to pause before attempt ing to
destroy the Union which ha- conferred so
rnanv benefit*. He argues that Congress
can do much to restore peace by propos
ing and recommending an amendment to
the Constitution for remedying the exist- |
ing evil.
The very coure he recommends is to j
have an explanatory clause or amendment
of the Slave question, first, expressly re
cognizing tie right of property in slaves
in States where slavery now is, ,>r may
hereafter exist Secondly, ft.e first duty
of protecting such tights in all the coming
Territories, until the latter are admitted 1
a.-, in the Union. Thirdly, a like recogni j
tion.
After alluding to the great commercial
agricultural and other material prosperities j
of the country, the President asks, *• why
i* it tl en that discontent now *o exten- j
sively prevails and the union of the States •
which is the source of a'l those blessings is
threatened with destruction.
The 1 otig continued and intemperate in
tei terence ofihe Northern people with the
question of slavery in Southern States has
av. length produced its natural effect.
Ihe different sections ofihe Union are!
now arrayed against each other, and the '
time has arrived so much dreaded by the |
father of his country v\ fieri hostile geo- '
graphical parties have been formed. This!
does not pn ' -ol- , pom i <! i ion

It I .
t igitive slave law, b-it the immediate peril
nru.es from incessant and violent agitation
<>/ the slavery question, throughout the
North for the last quarter of a century has
produced its malign influence on the slaves
and inspired them with vague notions of .
freedom—hem e a sense ot security no
longer exists around the family altar.
1 his feeling of peace at home has given
place to appreiiens >n o >- senile in.sitrtec
tion M.anv ani Iron ihiougliout the
South retires at night tndread ot what mav
befal herself and children before the morn
ing. Should this apprehension of domes
tic danger exten i and intensify itself until
it shall jmrvade the masses of the Southern
people, then disunion will become inevita
ble. Self preservative i the first law of
nature, and no politics union, I. wever
fraught with blessings and hemfi's in .11
other res|-ecS, cm long coiittnu**, it the
necessary consequence I.** to render the
homes ami ti . .side* of n* •> !v half the par
ties to it are habitually and hopoVs-dy in
secure. Sooner or later the bonds ot
union must be severed.
“ It is my conviction that this fatal pe
riod has not yet arrived.’’
After referring to the incessant agitation
against slavery at the North, for the last
thirty years, loth by the pre-s and 'he peo
pic and asmrliiig that the time oft -egress
i* occupied with violent lies on the
never ending subject, he remarks;
** How easy wou'd it be f-.r rhe Arneri- i
can people to set'! the slavery qtiestion ,
forever, and restore peace and harmonv to
this districted c * .ntrv, which can h* done
by letting the slave stn’e- done, and per
milling them to u mage their own state
affairs, as they only are responsible l-efc-re
(rod for slavery existing among them,
and wtth which li e North has n more
right to interfere titan with the similar
institutions in Russia and Brazil
The I’resident still rehe on the good

are the-e dt nie i ? Not bv Cot gre-s, which
has i,ever passed, and I believe never will
pass, any act to exclude s!iveiy from the
territories, and certainly not by the Su

that slaves ate proper v and like all other

The moat palpable violations of cons'i

t< and. i-or.sist iii the arts ><f different slate
legislatures to defeat the execution of the
fugitive slave Iw. it ought to be retnem
hereil. however, that for tnese acts neither
Congress nor any President justly be held
responsible.
Having been passed in violation of the
federal constitution they are therefore null
and void.
It will be the duty of the next President
as it lias been mv own, to act with vigor
in executing the fugitive slave law against
conflicting enact met sot -late legislatures
We are not to presume in advance that
lie will violate h e duty, which would be
at war with everv principle of justice.—
Let, us wait tor the oven act.
The fugitive slave law has been carried
into execution in every contested cas<-
since the commencement of the present
administration. Let ns trust that the
State legislature* will repeal their uncon
stitut oriel and obnoxious enactments. —
Unless this shall be done without unn r
essary delay, it is impossible fur any hu
man power (<> save the Union. And the
southern States have a right to demand
this a<t of justice from the northern Slate*.
Should this be refused, (he injured States

of its own people a-scud - , -i in convention
so any one of them mav retire from the
Union in a similar m.inner I>\ the vote of
rnrii a convention, is wholly inconsistent
with the history as well as the character of
the federal constitution.
He then rehearses a portion Gen Jack

lifting ordinance of South Carolina, and
says this Gov. rnment v\a* intended bv its
founders to Iw perpetual and not u< bean
nulled a* the pb' isure of ;,nv one of the
contracting parties The President then
enumerates the povvets cent tied on Con
gross by the federal government, and that
these powers may be effectual, it also po
ssesses exclusive right to lay and collei-t al!
import duties and oilier taxes and has
adopted etiectui.i means to restrain the
States from interfering.

States? he pi curved to the slate- respect
ively, or to the people.
To the extent of the delegated powers
the constitution of the United States is as
much apart of the cons itulion of each 1
state, and is as hindirg on its people as '
though it had l**en lextually inserted
therein. Thb g- vein:u--nr therefore is a
g eat ati : powcifui g< vcrtoi.ent invested 1
wi;b ad the altrihules uf soveieigntv over
special -objects to whi> ii its authority c.x
tends. It iuav he asked, then, are the
people of the state then without redress
against the tyranny and oppression of the
fedora 1 government ? Bv no means. The
right of resistance on the part of the gov
erned against the oppresion of their gov \
ernments cannot he denied It exists inde
pendently <f ah con -tttufions, and has
been exercised at all peri- ds of the world's ;
hist.*rx.
But the distinction must ever be ob
served that this i- a revolution against an
establ i.she<! Government, and not a volun
tary secession from it, by virtue of an in
herein constitutional right.
In short, !e' us look the danger f airh
in the face, s-- -m is n< it her more nor
lens than revolution. It mav, or it mav ;
nor, be a justifiable revolution. What, in
the meantime is the resp msibilitv ami i

destruction of remedial justice among the
people, has been demolished, and it would
be difficult, if not impossible, to replace it.
The only acts of Congress on the statute
book beating on t is subject are those of
28t.. Feb uhi v. 1705, and 3d March 1807
These authorize the pres dent after he
shall have a--enabled ’hat the Marshal
with hi * p "e comtia ins i- unable to ex
ecute cim o ciim.n.a' p.-.*ce>- in any par
ticular case to cab <*nh •- iiidiiia. and
employ tile arm, mid a .' \ to aid him in
petfonnir g this service, having first bv
prodam t on commanded the insurgents
to disperse and retire peacably to their
respective abodes within a limit and time.
This duty cannot Ia any possibility be
performed in a state where no judicial au
thorily exists to issue proce-s, and where
there is no marshal to execute it, and
where even if there were such an officer,
the entire population would constitute
one solid combination to resist him.
Congress alone has power to decide
whether the present laws can not he
amended so a- to carry out more etfeciu
ally the objects of the constitution. The
revenue sti 1 continues to be collected as
heretofore at the Custom House at Charles
ton and should the collector unfortunately
resign a successor may be app duted to
perform this du'y.
It is not believed that any attempt will
be made to expel he United Sta'es from
its property there by force; bu if in this
I should be mistaken the offi ers in com
maud of the bets have received orders to
act strictly on the defen-ive In such a
contingency, the re-pon-ibilit j fot conse
quences would rightfully rest upon the
heads of the as-ailants.
In reference to reorganizing a seeding
state a an utdepemh nt government, hv
tlit- President, he says it. would he a naked
art of usurpation on his part, and if is his
duty to submit to Congress the tv hr ; ■
question in all its bearing.-.
The probability, of an omo r g< nr-*. soon
arising when Congress ml, I 1 . ... and on :o
decide the question whether it p .s-essen
power to compel a Mate to ta gu in the
Union, authorizes him to exp < ■ titeopin
ion that no sm-h power has been delega’ed
to Congress, or to ativ other deparunenl
of the federal government. it is manifest
that this is n t among the specific and
enu erative powers granted to Congress,
and it is equally apparent that its exerci e
is not necessary and proper for carrying
into execution any one of these powers.
The President declare* that to make
war upon a state is at variance with the
snirT ot the Constitution, and af'er having
conquered a state how aio we to govern
i' : We could no*, govern hv despot <• ik.w
<-r, nor could we ov p ivsicai force compe

this, the grandest temple which has ever
been dedicated to human freedom, since
the world began. It has been consecrated
by the blood of our fathers, by the glories
of the past, and by the Lopes of the fu

The Union has already’ made us the
most prosperous and ere long will, if pre
served, render o the most powerful tia
lion on the f ice of tiie e-irth.
In every foreign reg.ou of die Globe
the title of \uterie oi <-itiz**ns is held in ice
highest respect, and when pronounced in
a foreign land it causes lire hearts of our
countrymen to swell With honest pride
Surely, when we reach the brink of the
yawning abyss, we sli.di recoil with hor
ror from the fatal plunge Bv such a
dread catastrophe the h pes of the friends
of freedom throughout the wot Id would be
destroyed, and long night of leaden des
pot ism would enshroud the nations. Our
example for more than eighty years, would
not only be lost, but it would be quot
ed as a conclusive proof that man is unfit
tor red government.
The slavery que-lion, like every thing
human ha its day. I fervently believe
that it lias already reached and past the
culminating point ; but if in the of
the existing excitement the Union shall j er

Removal of the Remains of Co
lumbus.
It is stated from Havana that the re
mains of Christopher Columbus, the Djs.
coverer of the New World, are again to he
removed to anew anil splendid cemetery
soon to be opened near that city They
are to be deposited in a silver urn. upon
which will be inscribed in letters of gold,
the most remarkable events of his great
enterprise. A bronze statue is also to be
eiec’ed over them, representing the great
discoverer in the attitude of revealing the
grand mission of his wonderful life.
Columbus died Ascension day. the 29th
of May, iu about die seventieth year of
his age His obsequies were celebrate!
with great pomp at Valladolid and his
body deposited in the convent of San Fran
cisco. Thence, nine years after, in dm
tear 1513 it was removed to the Carthu
sian nionasfry of Seville, where was like
wise d**posit< (} the body i f hi* Diego.
Tweu'y-three t ears after, in the year 1 />-'JG,
the bodies ot Dot Ij the Admiral and his
son were removed with appropriate pomp
and ceremonies to the New Woi'd he had
dscoveied, anil interred in the principal
chapel ot S:m Domingo, rli-paniola.—
There ti ev remained undisturbed tor the
period of 259 years,
!n the year 1795 however, at the close
i.ftlie war between France and Spain, all
the Spanish possessions in the Ish.nd of
Hispaniola weie ceded to France, whete
npon a request was prefei red to the French
Governor to have tße remains of Colum
bus removed to Cuba. The request was
granted, and on the 20th of December,
1195, the vault in the cathedral of San
Domingo was. for the first time in nearly
three hundred yec<r, opened. Wirhin,"
shvr the record of the event, 11 were found
ihe flagmen's of R lea-ten coffin. >. nnmh r
of honos, and a quantity of m-niid, ev it J - 1 .
lv the remains ot a human b >dv. 1 tu-'H
were carefully collected and put into a
• a>e of gilded lead, about hair an ell in
length and breadth, and ii rd in iieigo!,
secured bv ati iron .o<-k. .<• kev o' which
wa • delivered to tha A . hop. The
case was enclosed in i cufii i covered with
black velvet, and ornamented with lace
fringe of gold.”
After appropriate funeral ceremonies,
th3 body was taken on board the ship Sa
Lorenzo and taken to Havana, where it
arrived on the 15ih of January, 1790 It
was received in the most solemn manner,
with all the honors given to a sovereign.
“ On arriving at. the mule, the remains
were met by the Governor of the Island,
accornpanied by In’s generals and military
staff. The coffin was then conveyed be
tween files of soldiery, w hich lined the
streets to t he obelbk. in ihe Place d'Anne*
here it, was receive*! in a hearse prepared
for the purpose. Heie the remains were
formally delivered to the tfovernor and
(’attain (reieral <>f the Island, lit© key
given up t<> him. the cotlin opened and ex
amined, acd 'tie sale transportation of its
• ontents auiuetittcated
The ceremony concluded, (he solemn
rites for the (Bad were perfumed bv tlie
Arc.hibi.sbop, and the remains of the g- eat
discoverer were again deposited in the
wall, ©n the right side of the yrand alter
of the Cathedral of Havana, where thev
have ever since remained, the object of
reverence to at! visitors of the Island.
Nothing c m he said against auv honors
that may be done, on occasion of opening a
new cemetery in Havana to the memory
of one so illoustiious. The erection of a
sta'ue would certainly be very appropriate.
But why again disturb the bones of the
great discoverer ? They n..w rest in a con
secrated place, in a building whose walls
have only become tinner as they grow gray
with years, and which proof, so far as any
edifice can be proof, against the elements
gives everv guarantee of protection, and
why should the mortal remains of the
great Admiral be not allowed, then, to
rest at last in peace ?

Astounding Success of a Confi

Mr. Wm if. Newcum, a wealth? - gen
tleman residing near Nashville, Term., lias
been lately on a visit to his brother and
other relatives in this city, living on Wash
ington avenue, between Sixth ami Seventh
streets. About ten days ago Mr. New
cntn’a acquaintance was handsomely made
b\ an individual represented to be a rich
and influential citizen of St. Louis, named
Washington L. Johnson. Mr. Johnson
assiduously cultivated an in * i nacv with
Mr. Newcurn
Mr Newcum came to repose unlimit' l 1
confidence in the probitv and pecuniary
resources of bis valuable St. L<iuis fiie.ud.
The Utter insiduously impressed him with
a conviction that Washington L. Johnsmn,
Esq., was the principal millionaire of the
Mound City. Mr Newcum, therefore, felt
no surprise when his honorable friend cas
ually and graciously expressed biinself as
having so available cash income of three
thousand dollars per month.
On last Saturday the cordial friends
“ might have been seen'* in still more fra
ternal and confidential mood, surveying
the valuable blocks between fifth and
Sixteenth streets in Car, all of which bv
the golden imagination of one friend, and
the truthfulnee* of the oher, showed as the
almost priceless property of Washington
L Johnson, Esq. The latter inadvertent-
I ly exhibited a large number of valuable
l drafts, mortgages, ete.. which furnished
I him occasion to remark that with the im
1 mediate conveniences ot ahuii ♦‘JO,OOO ho
! could effect a grand speculation which
i would richly remunerate them both. Mr.
Newcum agreed to take his friend’s paper
: and furnish him in return with $S (J(jU hi
1 currency and f 10.000 in drafts. The
| money was paid ever, and the drafts were
: promptly cached at the counters of the sev
i eral banks at which thev weie made pay
I ab f e. ,
Mr. Newcum reposed insecurity until
yesterday, when he missed the pleasin'-
attentions of his friend. The hours wore
on, and Mr. Johnson did not n j>j• ar.--
Kind inquiry disclosed that the ihh citizen
was not so wejl known as lie should he.—
Further investigation dissipated W-i-hing
ton L. Johnson, Esq., entirely, and lu f >. in
place of the goodly citizen, a miss in /
sharper Mr. Newcum’s securities are
worthless, and a most adroit villain hi,
fled with full twenty thousand dollars of
which he has fleeced an estimable but to.

Important to Farmers. —Coon the
question of “ ||ow much pork will a bush
el of corn make?” Mr. Kic ar i {'hatch
er, of Pensylvania, give in the Xew Ymk
Tribune , the result of feeding scalded or
cooked corn meal, in several instances, t >
fatten hogs. The re-ult of one trial gave
sixteen and one half pounds of pork for
each bushel of fifty pounds meal fed out
In another instance seventeen and nariv
one half pound* was the gain from a
bushel. The I of hogs experimented
upon was the “ Chester” (county,) Pa.,
white, which we regard as among the be-*
breeds now in the country. We have re
centlv seen accounts of several other ex
periments of feeding hogs in the sane
way. with similar results, while tho sarno

dry corn in the ear, gave return of abmi.-
