PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The following is
the President's message delivered to Con
gress to-day, at noon:
T<’ the ,Senate and House of Representa
tives:
In addressing my third annual message
to the law-making branch of the Govern
ment, it is gratifying to be aide to state
that during the past year success has gen
erally attended the efforts to execute all
the laws found upon the statute books.
The policy lias been not to inquire into
the wisdom of laws already enacted, but to
learn their fecial interest and enforce
them accordingly.
The past year ha. under a w ise Provi
dence, ’oeen one of general prosperity to
the nation. It has, however, been attend
ed with more than the usual chastisements
in loss of life and property by storm and
fire. These disasters have served to call
forth the best elements of human nature in
our country, and to develops a fri n-lship
for us on the part of foreign nat; >:i<. which
goes far toward alleviating the dGtres* oc
casioned by the calamities. The benevo
lent who have so generously shared llicir
means with the victims of these misfor
tunes will reap their reward in the con
sciousness of having performed a noble act,
and in receiving the grateful thanks of
men, women and children whose suffering
they have relieved.
FOREIGN RELATION-.
The relations of the I'nitcd States with
foreign pow ts continue to be friendly.
The year lias been an eventful one in wit
nessing two great nations, speaking one
language, and of one lineage, settling, by
pieacefnl arbitration, disputes of long stan i
ing. and liable at any time to bring these
nations into bloodshed and a state of con
flict.
An example has thus been set which, if
successful in its final issue, may be followed
by other civilized nations, and be the final
means of returning to productive industry
millions of m°n maintained to settle the
disputes of nations by the bayonet and
broad-sword.
THE WASHINGTON*'TREATY.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty
alluded to, which has heen concluded since '
the adjournment of Congress with Her
Brittanic Majesty, and a copy of the proto
cols of the conference of the Commission
ers by whom it was negotiated.
This treaty provides methods fir adjust
ing the questions pending between the two
nations. Various questions are to tie ad
justed by arbitration. 1 recommend to
Congress, at an early day, to make the ne
cessary provisions for the tribunal at Gene
va, and for the several commissioners on
the part of the United States called for by !
the treaty. His Majesty, the King of Italy,
the President of the Swiss Confederation,
and fits Majesty, the Kmpcror of brazil,
have each consented, on the joint request
of the two powers, to name an arbitrator
for the tribunal at Geneva.
1 have caused my thank® to he suitably
expressed for the readiness with which the
joint request has b.-cn complied with b.
the appointment of gentlemen of eminence
and learning to those important positions.
His Majesty, the Kmpcror of Germany, has
been pleased to comply with the joint re
quest of the two governments, and has con
sented to act as the arbitrator of the dis
puted Costar boundary lie tween the Unite !
States and Great Britain.
The controlling parties in the tr. aty have
undertaken to regard as settled between
themselves, certain principles of public law
for which the United States ha\ contend
ed from the commencement of their history.
They have also agreed to bring these princi
ples to the knowledge of other maritime
powers and to invite them to accede to
them. Negotiations are going on as to the
form of the note by which the invitation is
to bo extended to the powers.
1 recommend the legislation necessary on
the part of the United States to bring into
operation the articles in the treaty relating
to the fisheries, and to the matters touch- :
iug the relations of the United States to- (
ward the British American possessions, to
become operative as soon as the proper leg
islation snail be had on the part of Great
Britain and its possessions. ltsi® much to
bo desired that thi: legislation may become
co-operative before the fishermen of the
I nited States begin to make their arrange
ments for the coining season.
I have addressed a communication, of
which a copy is herewith transmitted, to
the Governors of New York. Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wis
consin, urging upon the Governors of those
states, respectively, the necessity of activi
ty on their part to carry into effect the
object of the article of the treaty, which
contemplates the use of the canals on either !
side, connected with the navagation of the
lakes and rivers, forming the boundary, in
terms of equity, by the inhabitants r.f’botb
countries: and it is hoped that the impor
tance of the object, and the benefits to flow
therefrom, will secure the speedy approval
of the legislature of the states concerned.
THE NORTHWESTERN HOI MIARV.
T renew the recommendation for an ap
propriation for determining the true posi
tion of the 4Sth parallel of latitude, where
it forms the boundary between the United
States and the British North American
possessions, between the bake of tin
Woods and the summit of the lloekv
Mountains. The early action of Congre--
on the recommendation named, won! 1 put
it In the power of the War Department ! ■
place a force in the field during the next :
mi miner.
PROTECTION OR GERMAN® j\ PARIS.
The resumption of diplomatic relations ,
between France and Germany have enabled
me to give directions for the withdrawal
of the protection afforded to Germans In
France by the diplomatic and consular rep- .
resontatiyos of the United States, in that
country. It is just to add that the delicate (
duty of this protection ha® been performed
by the Minister and consulate in Paris, and
the various consuls in Franco, under the
supervision of the latter, with great kind
ness as well as with prudence and fact.
I heir course has received the commenda
tion of the German government, and has
wounded no susceptibility of the French.
The government of the V.mperor of Ger
many continues to manifest a frien
feeling toward the .United States, and a j
desire to harmonize*with the in Aerate and ■
just policy which this government main
tains in its relations with the Asiatic
powers, as well as with the South Amer
ican Republic. 1 have given assurance
that the friendly* feelings of that govern
ment itre fmly shared by the I nited
States.
RELATIONS witu ATSTRIA.
The ratification of the consular aiul nat
nralixafinn connection with the Austro-
Hungarian Umpire has b<'tn changed.
ITALI V>: r.MTV.
I liAvo boon oftciillv mi formed of the an
nexation of the Stnt 's of the Church to the
Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the i
capital of that kingdom to Rome, in con- 1
formation with the established poliev of
the I idled States 1 have recognized this
change.
TREATY OF COMMERCE WITH ITALY.
The ratifications of the new treaty of
commerce between the Tinted Statesand
Italy have been exchanged. The two
powers have agreed in their treaty that ,
property at sea shall be exempt from cup
tnre in case oi war between the two power*.
Ihe I nited States have spared no oppor
tunity of incorporating this rule into the
obligations of nations.
AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN.
The Forty-first Congress, at its seeomi
session, made an appropriation for the or
ganization of a mixed commission for ad
judicating upon the claims of citizens of
the Rutted States against *j.ain, growing
out of the insurrection iu Cuba. That
commission ha since been organized. I
transmit a copy of the correspondence,
r lating to it- formation and its jurisdiction.
It is to 1 • Loped that this commission will
afford the claimants a complete remedy for
their injuries.
It ' a- been made the agreeable duty of
the United States to preside over a con
ference at Washington between the pleni
potentiary of Spain am. the allied South
American republics, which has resulted in
uu armistice, with the reasonable assurance
of a permanent p. ace.
RELATIONS W ITH HI SSIA.
The ultimate friendly relations which
have so long existed betwe *n the L nited
"Taies and Ru-.-ia continue!, undisturbed.
The visit of the third son of the Emperor
is a proof that there is no desire on the
part of bis government to diminish the
cordiality of those relations. The hospita
ble reception which has been given to the
Grand ]>uke is a proof that on our side
we share the wishes of that government.
The inexcu-.able course of the Russian
Minister at Washington rc•llde>~'' , it neces
sary to ask bis retail, and :o decline
longer to receive that functionary as a dip
lomatic representative. It was impossible,
w ith a ju.-t regard for the dignity of the coun
try to permit Mr.Cataca/.vto continue to hold
interviews with tbi- government after hi*
abuse of government officers, an ! during
bis per-ii tent interference, through various
means, with the relations between the
I'nit. i States an I oth it p ■•.ers. In ac
cordance with my wishes, our government
has h-en relieve 1 of further intercourse
with M. Catacazy and the management
of the affairs of the imperial legation has
passed into the hands of a gentleman en
tirely unobjectionable.
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN.
With Japan we continue to maintain
intimate relations. Ibe cabinet of the Mi
kado has since the close of the last session
of Congress, selected citizen© of the United
Mates to serve in office* of important de
partments of the government.
1 have reason to think that this selection
i- due to an appreciation uf the disinterest
edness of the policy which the United States
have pursued towards Japan. It is our
desire to continue to maintain this disinter
ested and just policy with China as well as
Japan.
THE COREAN TROUBLES.
The correspondence transmitted here
with shows that there is no disposition on
the part of this government to swerve from
its established course, prompted by a de
,-ire to put an en 1 to the barbarous treat
ment of our shipwrecked sailors on the
Corean coast.
1 instructed our Minister at Pekin to en
deavor to conclude a convention w ith Corea,
for securing the safety and humane treat
ment of -m b mariners. Admiral llodgors
was instructed to accompany him with a
sufficient force to protect him in case of
need. A small surveying party, sent out
on reaching the coast, was treacherously
attacked at a disadvantage. Ample op
portunity was given for explanation and
apology for the insult, and neither came.
A force was then landed, and after an ar
duous march over a rugged and difficult
country, the fort® from w hich the outrage
had been committed, were gallantly* as
saulted and were destroyed. Having thus
punished the criminals and vindicated the
honor of the flag, the expedition returned,
finding it impracticable under the circum
stances to constitute the desired conven
tion. I respectfully offer the correspond
ence relating thereto therewith submitted,
and leave the euhjert for such action as
Uongress may see fit to take. .
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO AND SOUTH
AMERICA.
The Hi public of .Mexico has not yet re
pealed tlie very objectionable law -estab
lishing what i® know n a® the Frozen Zone,
the frontier of the I nited States. It is
hoped that this may* yet he done, also that
more stringent measures may be token by
that rej iblic for re lining lawless j■ i
sons on the frontier. 1 hope that Mexico,
by* it® own action, will soon relieve the
government of the difficulties experienced
from tin ,-e causes. Our relations with the
various republic® of Central and South
America continue, with one exception to
be* cordial and friendly*. I recommend ac
tion by Congress r girding to the overdue
installm ts under the award of the Vene
zula claim commission of 1 Mid.
The internal dissensions of this govern
ment present no justification for the ab
sence of effort to meet their solemn treaty
obligations, I lie ratification of an extra
dition treaty with Nicaragua has been ex
changed.
EM A N CIP AT tON IN BRAZIL.
It is a subject for congratulation that
the great Umpire of Brazil has taken the
initiatory steps toward the abolition of
slavery. Our relations with that empire,
always cordial, v ill naturally be more so
by tin® act. It i not too much to hope
that the government of Brazil may hereaf
ter find it for its interest, as well as intrin
sically right, to advance toward entire em
ancipation more rapidly than the present
act contemplates. Its true prosperity and
greatness a® a nation tire to be found in
the elevation ami education of its laborers.
H.AVERY IN SPANISH (oI.OME®.
It is a . * fi n : ;:..-.t ; h refi rii
in sh; direction, which were voluntarily
promised by the state men of Spain, have
not been carried out in it® Best Indian
colonic®. The law s an I regulation.® foi
the apparent abolition ot slavery in Cuba
and i'orto Rico have left the laborers in
bondage with no hope of release until their
lives become a burden to their employers.
AMERICANS OWNING SLAVES.
1 de-ire t i direct your attention to the* fact
that the *itTens of the United States arc
largt holders, in foreign lands, of this spe
cie-of property, forbidden by the funda
mental law of their alleged country. 1
recommend to Congress to provide, bv
stringent legislation, a suitable n medv
against the bolding, owning <u* dealing in
slaves, or being interested in slave proper
ty on foreign lauds, either us owners,
hirers, or mortgagers of the Unite I State®.
CUBA.
It is to he regretted that the disturbance
in the island of Cuba continues to be a
source of annoyance and of anxiety. The
i xistencc of a protracted struggle in
such dose proximity to mir ow n country,
without apparent prospect of on early ter
minati in, cannot bo other than an object
■ rn to a people who, w bile abstain
ing from interference in the affairs of other
powers, naturally desire to sec every coun
try in the undisturbed enjoyment of liberty
and the blessings ot free institutions.
Our naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been instruct ' I. in case it should be-
Coine necessary, to spare no effort to pro
tect the live® and | roperty of bona tide
American citizens and to maintain the
dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all
pen ung qne-tions with Spain, growing
oat vit the affairs in Cuba, may be adjust
ed in the spirit of peace and concord w hich
has hitherto gukh I th< two powers in their
treatment of sncli questions.
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND 1
I Javan.
To give importance and to add to the ef
ficiency of our diplomatic relations with
i dapau and China, and to further in retain
| iug the good op.aion of those people and
1 to secure to the Tinted States its share of
the commerce destined to flow between
th< >c nations an t die balance of the coiu
m rcial world, 1 oaniesliy recommend that
an appr>j riati,m made to support, at
bast, t it American youths iu each
of these countri* s to severe in
the official family of ( ur minister there. .
Our representative w ould men Sc placed oa
an equality with the representatives of
Treat Britain, and several other powers.
A> m>w situated, our representatives in
China and Japan have to depend for inter
preters and translator*, upon the natives
of these countries, win* know oar language
imperfectly, or procur* for the occasion
the services of employes off ire : gn business
i 1 i*e*. or the interpreters to other foreign
ministers
FACinc steamsnir lines.
I would also rceimini nd 151 •• n*l mea
sures for the purpose of parting the Amer
ican line uf steamers now plying between
.San Franciace and Japan and China, and
the Australian iine, at most our only re
maining linos of ocean steamers, and of in
creasing their service.
the Tariff ox taxes.
I recommend that all taxes from internal
sourc'-e be abolished, except those on spir
ituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobac
co in its various forms, from stamps. In
readjusting the tariff. I suggest that a
careful e.-timate be made of the amount of
surplus revenue collected, under the pres
ent laws, after providing for the current
expenses of the government, the internal
account, and a sinking fund; and, that this
surplus be reduced hi such manner as to
afford ilw greatest revenue.
There are many articles not produced at
home such as medicines and compounded
essences, from which but little revenue is
derived, but which enter into general use.
Such articles I recommend to be placed on
the free lists. Should further reduction
prove advisable, 1 would then recommend
that it be made up on articles which can
bear it without disturbing home proiuc- j
tions, or reducing the wages of American
labor.
I have not entered into figures, because
to do so w mid be to repeat all that is laid
before you in the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury. The present laws for
collecting revenues pay collectors too
'mail salaries, but provi le for shares in all
seizures, which, at principal ports of entry
particularly raisQthe compensation of these
officials to a large sum. It has always
seemed to me as if this system in ist at
times work perniciously.
it holds out an inducement to dishonest
men, should such got possession of these
offices, to be las in their scrutiny of goods
entered, to enable them finally to make
large seizures. Your attention is respect
fully invited to this subject.
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
The national debt has been reduced to
the extent of *80,057, lthl.Bo during the
year, and by the negotiation of national
bonds at a lower rate of interest, the inter
est uf the public debt has been so far dimin
ished, that now the sum to be raised for
interest account is nearly $17.'100,000 less
than on the Ist of March, Itsoo.
It was highly desirable that this rapid
diminution should take place, both to
strengthen the credit of the country and
convince its citizens of their < ntire ability
to meet every dollar of liability without
bankruptcy; but in view of the accomplish
ment of these desirable ends, of the rapid
development of the resources of the country,
1 and it- increasing ability to nv-et the large
, demands, and the amount already paid, it
; is not desirable that the present resources
: of the country should continue to be taxed
i in order to continue this rapid payment,
j I therefore reeomend the modification of
both tariff and tax laws.
COM) AN'S) CURRENCY.
Continued fluctuation in the value of
gold, compared with the national currency,
has a most damaging effect upon the increase
and uevelnpement of the country, in koep
i ing up prices of all the articles necessary
i in every day life; it foster- a spirit of
j gambling prejudicial alike to national mor
als and to national finances. If the ques
-1 tinn can be met as to how to get a fixed
1 value to our currency, that value constantly
j and uniformly approaching par with specie,
a very desirable object will be gained.
■
THE ARMY.
For the operations of the army in the
! past year, the expense of maintaining, csti
mates for the ensuing year,and for continu-
I ing sea coast and other improvt moots con
j ducted under supervision of the War De
[ partment I refer you to the accompanying
' report of the Secretary of War.
1 call your attention to the provisions of
j the act of Congress, approved March 2d,
1 SO*J, w hich discontinm s promotions in
j staff corps of the army until provided for
:by law. I recommend that the number of
I officers in each grade of staff corps be fixed,
| and that whenever the number in anv one
grade falls below the number so fixed, that
! the vaeancy may be tilled by piomotion
from the grade below*.
1 also recommend that when the office of
chief of corps becomes vacant, the place
may be tilled by a selection from the corps
in which the vacancy exists. The report
of the Secretary of the Navy show - im
provement in the navy, and efficiency of
tlie naval force, without material increase
in expense of supporting it. This is due
to the policy which has been adopted and
i® being extended as fa -1 as our material
w ill admit of using smaller vessels as cruis
ers on the several stations. By these
means wo have been enabled to occupy at
once a larger extent of cruising ground,
to visit more frequently* tbe posts where
the presence of our flag is desirable and
generally to discharge more efficiently the
appropriate duties of the navy in time of
peace without exceeding the number of
men or the expenditures authorized bv law*.
During the past year the navy has, in
addition to its regular service, supplie t the
men and officers and the vessels of the
coast survey, and has completed the sur
veys authorized by Conge of the I-th
! mils of Darien and Tehauntepce; and un
l'>r like authority has sent out an expedi
tion completely furnished and equipped
to expl ire the unknown <k an of the North.
I The suggi stiuns < t the report as to the
! imce'sity for increasing and improving the
1 material of the navy, and the plan recom
mended for reducing the personnel of the
service to a peace standing by the gradual
abolition of certain grades of offices and
reduction of others, and the employ ment of
■ some in the service of the commercial ma
rine, are well considered, and deserve the
attention of Congress.
1 also recommend that all promotions in
j the navy above the rank of captain he bv
i selection instead of bv sonority. This
'course will secure in the higher grades
greater efficiency and hold out an incentive
to your officers to improv* themselves in
the know ledge of their profession.
Ihe present cost <d' maintaining the
navy, and its cost compared with tiiat of
preceding years, and estimates fur the en
-1 suing year, are contained in the accompa
| uyiug report of the Seer tary of the Ntivv.
THE I’OST OFFICE.
The enlarged receipts of the Post Offi c e
Department, as shown by the accompany- ;
ing report of the Postmaster General, ex
hibits a gratifying increase in that branch
of the public service. It is the index of
the growth of education and of the pros
perity of the people, two elements highly
conducive to the vigor and stability of re
publics, with a vast territory like ours, j
much of it sparsely populated' but all re
quiring the services of the mail. It is n.it
at present to be expected that this depart
ment can be made self-sustaining, but a
gradual approach to this end from vear to
year i® confidently relied on, and the dav
is not far distant when the Post Office De- i
partment of the Government will prove a
much greater blessing to the whole people
than it is now.
The suggestions of the Postmaster Gcn
' era! for improvements in the department
presided over by him are earnestly recom
mended to your especial attention, especial
ly the document favorable to the considera
tion of a plan for uniting the telegraph
system of the Tnited States with the pos
tal system. 1
It is believed that by such a course the
cost of telegraphing could be much reduced,
and the service as well, if not better, ren
dered. It would secure the further a Ivan
tage by extending the telegraph through
portions of the country w here private en
terprise will not construct it.
Commerce, trade, and. above all, the ef
forts to bring a people, widely separated,
into a community of inter .-ts.'are alwavs
benefitted by a rapid communication: and
education, the grand ground-work of Re
publican institutions, is encouraged bv in
creasing these facilities together with
Speedy news from all parts of tbe coon try.
The desire to reap the benefit of such
improvements will stimulate education, i
refer you to the report of the Postmaster
General for full details of the derations ,
of last year, and for comparative state
ments of results of former years
THE PfliLlC LANDS.
I renew my recommendations that the
pubiic lands be regarded as heritage to oar
children, to be disposed of as required for
occupation and to actual settlers. Those
already granted have been, in groat part,
disposed of in such a way as to secure ac
cess to the balance bv the hardy settler
who may w ish to avail himself of them:
but caution should be exercised even in ai
ming so de-ireablo an object. Educational
interests may well be serve! by the grant
of the proceeds of the sale of public lands
to settlers.
EDUCATION A L.
I do not wish to be understood as recom/
mending in the least degree a curtailment i
of what is being done by the general gov
ernment for the encouragement of v loca
tion. The report of the Secretary of the
Interior, submitted with this, will give you
information, collected and prepared fur
publication, in regard to the census taken
during the year 1 f*7‘*, the operations of the
Bureau of Education for the year, the
Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land
Office and Indian Bureau.
ACRICI LTI RE.
The report of the Commissioner of Ag
riculture gives the operations of his depart
ment for the year. As agriculture is the
groundwork of our prosperity - , too much
importance cannot be attached towards
labor; and his department is in the hands
of an able bead, yvitb able assistants, all
jealously devoted to introducing into the
agricultural productions <>f the nation all
the useful products adapted to the various
climates and soils of our vast territory, and
to the giving of ail useful information as to
the best method for the cultivation of
plants.
Quietly but surely the Agricultural
Bureau is working a groat national good,
and if liberally supported the more widely
its influence will he extended, and the less
dependant wc shall be upon the products ,
of foreign countries.
SALARIES.
The subject of compensation to the heads
of bureaus and officials, hoi ling positions
of rosj ousibility ami requiring ability and
character to fill properly, and one to which
your attention is invited. But few - of the
officials receive a compensation equal to
the respectable support of a family, while
their duties are such a- to involve millions
of interest. In private life their services
demand compensation equal to services
rendered. A wise economy would dictate
the-same rule in the government service.
GOVERNMENT EXPENSES.
I have not given the estimates for tlie
support of the government f>>r the ensuing
year, nor the comparative statemeitt be
tween the expenditures fur the year just
passed and the year just proceeding, be
cause all these figures are contained in the
accompanying reports, or in those present
ed directly to Congress. Those estimates
have my approval.
POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
More than sis years have elapsed since
the last hostile gun was fired between the
enemies then arrayed against each other,
one for the perpetuation, the other for the
demolition of the Union, it may well be
considered whether it is not now time that
the disabilities imposed by the 14t!i amen I
ment should he removed. It does not ex
clude the ballot, hut only requires the disa
bility to hold office of certain cla.-ses.
W lien the purity of the ballot is secure,
majorities arc sure to elect officers rellecting
the views ot the majority. Ido not see
the advantage or propriety of excluding
in ;i from office merely. They were b< tre
the rebellion of standing and character
sufficient to be elected to positions requir
ing them to take an oath to -a] port the
constitution, and admitting to olegihility
those entertaining precisely the same views
hut of less -landing iu their communities.
It may he said that the former vi 'ale 1 an
oath while the latter did not. The lath r
did not- have it in their power to do so. If
they hr. 1 taken this oath it cannot he
doubted they would have broken it, ns did
the former class. If there are any great
criminals, distinguished above all others
for the part they took iu oppo ition to the
government, they might, in the Judgment
ot o •nijuorors. he excluded from such an
amnesty. This subject is submitted for
your careful consideration. The condition
of the southern states is unhappy, not su -h
as all patriotic citizens would like to se 1 :
social ostracism fur opinion’s sake, person
al violence and threats toward ] ersons en
tertaining political views opposed to those
entertained by the majority of the citizens,
prevents immigration and the flow of much
needed capital into the states lately in re
bellion.
It will be a happy condition of country
when the old citizens of those states shall
take an interest in public affairs, promul
gate the idea honestly entertained, to vote
for men representing their views, permit
the freedom of the press and ballot to those
entertaining different political convictions.
THE DISTRICT OK COLOMBIA.
I mil r the provisions of the act of Con
gre-> approved i'eburary £lst, IbTI, -a ter
ritorial government was organized in the
District of Cohimhi . I• ■ :■■ ■.' ■. have
thus far fully realized the expectations of
its advocates. Under the direction of the
territorial officers a system of improvements
has been inaugurated, by mean:- of which
Washington is rapidly becoming a citv
worthy of the nation's capitc-I, the citizens
of the District have voluntarily taxed them
selves to a large amount for the purpose of
contributing to the advancement of the
seat of government.

provements.
ooveknmem r.rn.niNcs ix Chicago.
I’y the great fire in < 'hiengo the most
important of the government buildings
in that city were consumed. Those burn
ed had already become inadequate to the
wants of the government in that growing
! city, and looking to the near future were
wholly inadequate. 1 recommend, there
fore, that an appropriation be made imme
diately to purchase the remainder of the
entire square on which the burned build
ing stood, provided it can be purchased at
a fair valuation, and provided the legisla
lure ol Illinois will pass a law authorizing
its occupation for government purpose,,
ami also make an appropriation of as much
money as can be properly expended to
ward the erection of new buildings during
this fiscal year.
IMMIGRATION.
Ihe number of immigrants, ignorant of
our laws and habits, aud coming into our
country annually, has become great, and
the impositions imposed upon them so
numerous and flagrant that I suggest con
gressional action fur their protection. It
seems to me the affair is a subject of legis
lation by Congress. I cannot now state ,
as fully as I desire the nature of the com
plaints by emigrants of the treatment thev
receive, hut will endeavor to do so during i
the session of Congress, particularly if the
subject should receive your attention.
THE Kl-KLIX LAW.
There ha? been imposed upon the execu
tive branch of the government the execu
thm of the act of Congress, approved April
-Oth, IjsTl, and commonly known as the
Ku-Klux law.
la a portion of the State of South Caroli
na the necessity of the course pursued will
be demonstrated by the report of the com
mission to investigate -southern outrages.
I ndt r the provisions of the above act I
issued a proclamation calling the attention
of the people of the United States-to the
same and declaring my reluctance to exer
cise any of the extraordinary powers there
by conferred upon me, except in case of
imperative necessity, but making known
my purpose to exercise such
powers whenever it should becon*.
necessary to do so for the purpose of
securing to all citizens of the United Stafc
the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guar,
an teed to them by the constitution and the
laws.
After the passasre of this law. informa
tion was received from time to time that
combinations of the character referred to
in this law existed ami were powerful in
many parts of the southern states, particu
larly in certain counties in the state of
South Carolina. Careful investigation
was made, and it was ascertained that in
nine counties of that State such cotnbina
nations were active and powerful, embrac
ing a sufficient portiou of citizens to control
the local authority, and having, among
other things, the object of depriving the
emancipated class ol % the substantial
benefit- of freedom and of the privilege of
the free ] lineal action of those citizens
who did not sympathize with their views.
• .Among their < perations were frequent
scouring* and occasional assassinations,
generally perpetrated at night by diguised
persons, the victims in almost all cases
being citizens of different political senti
ments from their own, or free persons who
had shown a disposition to claim equal
rights with other citizens. Thousands of
inoffensive an! well disposed citizens were
the sufferers by tins lawless violence.
Thereupon on the Kith of Oct., 1871. a
proclamation was issued in terms of the
law. calling upon the members of the com
binations to disperse within five days, and
to deliver to the Marshal or military of the
I nitod .'states, all their arms, nmunitions,
uniforms, cognises, cad other means and
implements used by them for carrying out
their unlawful | urpo-cs.
This warning not hiving been heeded,
on the 17th of October another proclama
tion was issued suspending the privileges
of the writ of habeas corpus in nine comi
ties in that .'Mate. Directions were given
that within the counties so designated per
sons supposed, upon credible information,
to be members of such unlawful combina
tions, should be arrested by the military
forces ~f the Tinted States and delivered
to the Marshal, to be dca iPw itb according
t to law.
In two of the said counties—York and
Spartanshurg—many arrests have been
made. At !a-t accounts the number of
persons thus arrested was one hundred and
sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose crimi
nality was ascertained to be of an inferior
degree were released for the present. These
have generally made confessions of their
guilt. Great caution has been exercised in
making arrests. Notwithstanding the
large number, it is believed that uo inno
cent person is now in custody.
The prisoners will be held for trial in
the judicial tribunnsl of the United States.
As soon as it appeared that the authorities
of the United States were about to take
vigorous measures to enforce the law, many
persons absconded, and there is goo 1 ground
for supposing that till such persons have
violated the law. A full report of what
has been done under this law will be sub
mitted to Congress by the Attorney Gen
eral.
THE MORMONS AMI POLIO AMY.
In Utah there remains a remnant of bar
barism, repugnant to civilization, decency,
and to the laws of the United States.
Territorial officers,however have been found,
who are willing to perform their duty in a
spirit of equity, and with due sense of sus
taining the magesty of the law. Neither
polygamy nor any other violation of the
statutes will be permitted within the terri
tory of the United States. It is not with
the religion of those self-styled saints that
we are now dealing, but their practices.
They "'ill be protected in the worship of
God according to the dictates of their con
sciences, but they will not be permitte ! to
vio!at< laws under the cloak of religion.
It may be advi-ab! ■ for Congress to con
sider what, in the execution of laws-against
polygamy, i- M be tin* statu- <>f the plural
v.i\e- and their offspring. The proprietv
of Congress passing an enabling act au
thorizing the Territorial Legislature of
Utah to legitimatize all ohildn n born prior
to a time fixed in the act, might be justifi<*d
by ,’i> humanity to these innocent children.
I his is a suggestion only, an 1 n< t an c
ommen lation.
THE INIUVN POLICY - .
The policy pursued towards t!; 1 Indians
has resulted favorably, so far ns can be
judged from the limited time during which
it has been in operation. Through the ex
ertion- of the various societies of ('iiri.-tlaus,
to whom it has been entrusted the execution
oft! * policy, and the board of commisi m
ersauthorized by the law of April H.ith,
IbiiO, many tribes of Indians have been in
duced to settle upon reservation, to culti
vate the soil, and perform productive labor
of various kinds, and to partially accept
civilization. They are being cared for in
such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those
still pursuing their old habits of life to em
brace the only opportunity which is left
them to avoid extermination. I recommend
liberal appropriations to carry out the In
dian peace policy, not only because it is
human, Chri.-tiau-liko and economical, but
because it is perfectly right. 1 recommend
to your favorable consideration, also, the
policy of granting a territorial government
to the Indians, in the Indian Territory
w est of Arkansas and Missouri, and soutli
of Kansas. In doing so, every right guar
anteed to the Indians by a treaty .-ho ilj In
secure 1. Such a course might, in time, be
the means of collecting most of the Indians,
now between the Missouri and the Pacific,
ami south of the British dominions, into
one territory, or one state. The Secretary
of the Interior has treated upon this sub
jeet at length, an 1 I recommend to you his
suggestions.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
It has been the aim of the administra
tion to enforce honest;, and efficiency in all
public offices. Every public servant, who
lias violated the trust placed in him, has
been proceeded against with all the rigor of
the law. If bad men have secured places
it has been the fault of the system estab
lished by law and customs, for making ap
pointments, or the fault of those who re
commend for government positions persons
not sufficiently well-known to them person
ally, or who give letters endorsing the
character of office seekers without proper
sense of the grave responsibility which
such a course dev. Ives upon them. A civil
service reform w hich can correct this abuse
is much desired, in mercantile pursuits,
the business man who gives a letter of rc
, commendation to a friend, to enable him to
, obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded
as morally responsible for the integrity of
bis friend and ids ability to meet his obli
i gallons.
A reformatory law which would enforce
this principle against all endorsers of per
sons for public places, would ensure great
! caution in making recommendations. A
salutuary lc>son has been taught the care
less and dishonest servant in the great
number of prosecutions and convictions of
the last two years. It is gratifying to no
tice the favorable change which is taking
place throughout the country in bringing to
punishment those who have proved recreant
to the trust confided to them, and in elevat
ing to public office none but those who pos
sess the confidence of honest and virtuous
men, who will always be found to comprise j
the majority ol the community in which j
they live. In mv message to Congress one j
year ago, I urgently recommended a reform !
in the civil service of the country. In con- j
formity with that recommendation. Con- j
gross, in the 9th section of an act making '
appiupriations for sundry civil expenses of i
u,e Government, and for other purposes !
approved March 3d, IS7I, gave the neces
sary authority to the executive to inaugu
rate a civil service reform, aud placed upon
him the responsibility of doing so under
the authority of said act. 1 convened a
board of gentlemen, eminently qualified,
for the work to devise rules and regulations
to effect a reform. Their labors are not
vet complete, hut it is believed that they
will succeed in devising a plan which can
be adapted to the great relief of the execu
tive. the heads of departments, and mem
bers of Congress, which w ill redound to
the interest of the public service. At all
events, the experiment shall have fair trial.
t’O.SCLCSIOM.
I hare thus hastily summed up the op
erations of the Government during the
past year, and make such suggestions as
occur to me to he proper for your considera
tion. I submit them with a confidence
that your combined action will he wise,
states man-like and in the best interests of
the v.holc country.

Kan Him Out.
The moral to the fidlowing. told by the
sufferer, is too ap'iarent to mention. Young
ladies will hercaf'er run their brothers out
when gentlemen call:
Um certain that 1 wished somebody would
spank the young rascal. We talked of
hills, mountains, ’ ales and cataracts —I be
lieve I said waterfalls, when the boy spoke
up and said:
“ Why sister s got a trunk full ofthgra up
stairs; pa says they are made of boss hair ”
This revelation struck terror into me nd
blushes into the checks of my fair compan
ion.
It began to be very apparent to me th it I
must be very guarded in what I said, lest
the boy might slip in his remarks at uncalled
for pi ices; in fact 1 turned my conversation
to him, and told him he ought to go hum
with me, and see what nice chickens we had
in the country. Unluckily, I mentioned
a yoke of calves my brother owned. The
word calves, ruined all. The little one
looked up anti said.
Sister’s got a dozen pur of them, but
she don’t wear ’em only when she goes up m

wretch ! ’ exclaimed Emily; *• leave immedi

“ I know what yon want me to leave the

want to set r,n that man’s lap and kiss him
like you did Bil Simmons the other day;
you can’t fool me. I js tell you. Gemme
some candy like ho did and I’ll go. You
think because you’ve got 'be Grecian bend
that you re smart. Guess I know a thing or

would have bought me a top yesterday, it'
it hadn t been for you gettin 7 them curls,
Jog on yer ! You needn't turn so red in the
face, cause I can see the paint. There
aint no u-e in winking at me with that glass
eyeofyourn, for I ain’t goiu 7 out o 7 here,
now that- what's the matter with the purps.
I don’t care if you are twenty-eight years
old, you ain’t no boss o’ mine.”
Told Ihe Truth.
Some one was telling mo, the other day,
anew story about the late Dean Richmond,
who was known far and wide for his pro
fanity and giddiness of manner. Rich
mond was here at the time, and my inform
ant, who was then a boy working in a
printing office, wished to get a pass over
the Central Railroad. \\ It It this purpose
in view lie entered tlie office where the mag
nate was, fearing that he would he rudely
rebuffed when he made his mission known.
After a moments hesitation, he said falter
ingly:
“Mr. Richmond, I believe?”
“Yes; what do yon want of me?'’
“1 should like, sir, to get a .pass from
Albany to Buffalo, as I can go up on the
boat for nothing.”
“On what groan Is do you ask for a
pass? ’ (This with a rising and a very
rough voice.)
‘din the ground, s;r. that I don’t want
to pay my fare.”
Rielim m 1 without another word, wrote
oit a pass and handed it to the applicant.
The hoy took it, saying; “ Thank you,
Blank you, Mr. Richmond.”
“\ on needn’t thank me, youngster.
lin and and glad to accomodate you. You
are the first person I’ve ever known, hv
G—d, to ask for a pass on the right
grounds.”
