New Yoi:k. Dec. 4. The following crr
rcspondence lielween the Hon. J.J. Van
Aleu ami the president ami department
of state is made public ami is self-explanatory.
It is dated at Newport. K. I., Nov.
2 , 1(3, and addressed to the Hon. Walter
Q. tin-sham, secretary of state:
"itrc I have the bot.or to acknowledge
receipt of your letter of t he S.'Sth of Oito.
her iu which you officially notify tue that
the presiileut, by and wit It the advice and
consent cf the senate, has appointed me
ambassador to Italy.
".Since tho receipt of your letter I have
given the matter my most serious and
careful alt?ntion and ns the result of my
rt'llectii-as have concluded to ask you to
c::press to the president my decision ne t
to accept the oflice tendered me.
No l.sek of Apprermtioli.
"I mnst be? that vou will not infer from
this actlou any la -k of appreciation tin my
part of the honor conferred. On the con
trary I fully comprehend the dignity, im-
po:tance and responsibility of the position,
and having this realization I may frankly
add that the nomination was extremely
gratifying to me not in a personal sense
merely, but more particulaily because of
the opportunity afforded me of represent
ing my country in sstcli a manner ns I
hoped might be satisfactory to the Ameri
can people and creditable to the adminis
tration. Among the comments upou my

many persons unfamiliar with the tudi
vidmtls concerned and the facts essential
to the formation of an accurate judgment.
A llecial Vt Itlior.t ftnalilication.
"The charge was that 1 received the an-
pomtmeut 111 return for a contribution of
"'(lMo t lie Democtatic national cam

liending in the senate it did not an lil

when my notion cannot bs fairly attrib

me that 11 repetition of that denial, which

I was impelled by both patriotic aud sel
fish reasons to aid the Democratic cause.
Ntrver Thought of Au Obligation.
"So far from attaciiiug undue import

Nor did I lielieve that it should entitle
