Uolh the President and the Secretarj of the
Treasury are anxious to have the foolish and
reckless business of piling up 85 cent dollars
blopped at once. Out of a total of over 1 82(
000,000 of these dollars, let than JHO,000,(X)
are In circulation, and every attempt to force
tbcm upon the public fails.
The Burlington Free Press unkindly BayB
of the legislature's work that, leaving out the
billdtflnlug the property rights of matried
women and the usual tax levy, "alt the rest
of the legislation might as well bo dumped
into Lake Champlain, anil the general inter

would be just ftfl well off,"

of the Important measure which requires the
erection of a fence ibree feet high Around

to put ornamental Iron fences around their

Oapt. David L. Payne, tbo Oblabotna fili
buster, died in Kansas last week. Ha carried
the western idea that Indians have no rights
white men are bound to respect to Its logical
conclusion, and had persuaded himself that it
was not a sin, but a virtue, to rob the rid
men of their lands. He had cost the govern
ment some hundreds of thousands of dollars
to keep his "expeditions" out of the Indian
territory.
The report of the PostmasterUeneral
shows that the loss for the first year, cauced
by the reduction of postage from three cents
to two, is a little over six million dollars, or
$2,750,000 less than was estimated when the
change was made. The change caused a de
crease in the use of postal cards amounting
to over sixteen and a half millions. Presl
dent Arthur unites with the Postmaster
General In recommending an increase cf tLe
letter weight to one ounce.
Home details of the terrible plague whteh
exists In the mountain districts of eastern
Kentucky and western Virginia are given on
our first page to-day. A staff correspondent
of the Louisville Courier Journal, who Is in
vestigating the malady on the spot, finds it
reaching over a territory about bO miles long
by 70 wide. The disease runs two days and
U usually fatal. It Is probably duo to the
drought, but is contagious, and its victims
number at least 1000. Some of the oases, as
where whole families have beeu carried off,
with none left to bury the diad, are shocking
beyond description.
One hundred and thirty-seven of the lead
ing citizens of St. Albans addressed ft letter
to Chief Justice Itoyoe last week, congratu
lating him on his late vindication, both by
jury trial and by re election by the legislature,
and inviting biin to a public dinner in bis
honor at the Welden House. Judge Kojce
replied, thanking his fellow-townsmen for
their expression of confidence and good will,
but declining the dinner because he chooses to
avoid even tho appearance of evil by accept
ing such a compliment from the people of his
judicial district, whose cauhes he Is most like
ly to be called upon to try.
The opening of the second session of tho
48th Congress on Monday was as tame and
uneventful as possible. Neither branch did
more than to come to order and lihtui to the
reading of the President's message. In the
House on Tuesday Mr. Follett of Ohio intro
duced a resolution impeaching the United
States man-ha I In Cincinnati. This is a move
ment Intended to ascertain whether there was
proper management of the marshal's office at
the October election, or whether its power
was used to compel a Republican majority in
Hamilton county. In the senate Mr. Edmunds
is understood to be ready to push the business
of compelling the Pacific railroad companies
to fulfil their obligations to the government.
An Investigation has shown that an ugly
Democratic fraud was attempted in the sixth
(Chicago) senatorial district iu Illinois. De
velopments show that after the returns were
all in and it was evident that the Democrats
had lost the legislature, 200 fraudulent ballots
were printed and the returns doctored with
them to show the election of a Democrat
from that District. Oov. Hamilton has de
clared the Republican candidate elected and
given him his certificate. A good many Dem
ocratic politicians are mixed up in the job,
and some of them will have to go to tho pen
itentiary. The legifalature now stands on
joint ballot, Republicans 102, Democrats 100,
Independents 2, and there id a possibility,
though a remote one, of Logan's reelection.

those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. Tbe
falling off of revenue from customs made up nearly
t20,000,0i0 of this deficiency, and about $ 23,000,000 of
tbe remainder was due to the diminished receipts
from internal taxation. The secretary estlmatea.tbe

It has been well said that that uatiou is a
happy one the annual summing up of whose
affaire contains nothing more startling or ex
citing than Is found in President Arthur's
message which was delivered in tbe two
houses of Congress on Monday. The mes
sage makes no pretence to brilliancy of
thought or argument, and is neither inoro
nor less than a quiet, dignified and conserva
tive statement regarding those things which
most interest the country, and claim tbe at
tention of Congress. Our relations with all
foreign powers are harmonious, and in an
extended statement regarding them only two
points of special interest are developed. Oue
of these relates to the commercial treaty
which has beeu negotiated with Spain and
the Spanish Antilles, and has especial refer
ence to the sugar products of Cuba and Por
to Kico. What this treaty contemplates In
regard to tho reduction of the tax on sugar
and molasses Imported from those Ulands the
country will wait with Interest to learn. The
other Horn of peculiar Interest h that regard
ing the treaty with Nicaragua for tbe con
struction of a canal, railway and telegraph
line across Klcaraguan territory. The Nicar
agua route w&? carefully surveyed several
years ago by engineers commissioned by the
United States, and declared this the most
feasible of all possible interoceaulo canal
routes across Central America. Since that
time a company of American capitalists have
been refused government aid to build such a
canal, and It Is undoubtedly the case that
this treaty contemplates tbe building of a ca
nal by our government and not by private
citizens. Efforts in this direction have un
doubtedly been stimulated by reports of the
almost insurmountable difficulties experienced
by the French canal diggers, and by the pros
pect that many years must elapse in any case
before the completion of their enterprise.
President Arthur renews his recommenda
tion for "the abolition of all excise taxes ex
cept those relating to distilled spirits," which
means that he thinks the tax should be taken
off tobacco and beer and left on whiskey
alone. We doubt whether the Republicans
in Congress will agree with tbe President In
this matter. We ihould rather see the ex.
periment of making sugar free tried in Ibe
tint place.
II r. Arthur has a he&tty good word to say
lor tbe favorable results which have been re
alized from tbe operation of tbe civil service
law. Should President Cleveland fulfil the
THE EIGHTY-FIVE CENT DOLLAR.
I roncnr with the tecretarv of tbe treasury In rec
ommending tbe Immediate suspension of tbe coinage
or silver dollars anu oi ine issuance oi iintr i u
rntM. This Is a matter to which in former com muni-
rations I have mora than once Invoked the attention
of the national legislature. It appears that annually
for the pact six yesra there have been coined, In com
pliance with the Act of February 23, 1878, more than
OT.nfMi ivwi stiver dollar. The number now outstand
ing Is reported by the secretary to be nearly $1 85,00
000, whoreor ont uttie more man iu,uuu,wj or
than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation. Tbe mere
existence of this fact Been to me to furnish of it
self an argument fur tbe repeal or tbe statute which
has made such a fact possible. Hut there arc other
considerations thxt tend in the same direction. Tbe
secretary avows that aniens this coinage and tbe issu
n nf sliver certificate be snanended. silver is like
ly, at no distant day, to become our sole metallic
standard. Tbe commercial disturbance and the Im
pairment of national credit that would be thus tcca-
Bionea can scarcely ueofttwmuaitu.
T horx that thn secretary's sucsestions rcspcclins
tbe withdrawal from circulation of the one dollar and
two dollar notes will receive your approval. It is
Haflvthata considerable portion of the silver now
Incumbering the vaalta of the treasury might find it
way into tbe currency.
Mhile trade dollar bave ceased, for the present, at
least, to be an element of active disturbance in our
currency system, some provision shoutd be made for

the fact that they bave never had a legal tender qaal-

that they may near tneir uue rauo oi vaiue iu iue

IMPORTANT RKCOMMENDATIONS REGARDING EX
CISE TAXES.
In my annual message of 1882 I recomuended the
abolition of all excise taxes, except those relating to
distilled spirits. This recommendation la now re
newed. In case these taxes shall be abolished the
revenues that will still remain to tbe government
will, in mr oninlon. not only suffice to meet it rea
sonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large
enough to permit such tariff reduction as may eem
to bo advisable, when the result of recent revenue
laws and commercial treaties ahall have shown In
what quarter these reductlonscan ne most judiciuns.
ty enectea.
OtJB SHIPriNQ INTER EATS.
That nortion of tbe secretary report which con-
cerna the condition of our shipping interests cannot
fall to command your attention, lie emphatically
recommend that as an Incentive to the Investment
of American capital In American steamships tbe gov
ernment anan ny noenw payments ior man irauspur
tallnn or otherwise lend its active assistance to indi
vidual enterprise, and declares his belief that unless
that course he nuransd our carrying trade must re
main as U is to-day almost exclusively in tbe hand
of foreigner. One phase of this subject 1 now espe
cially prominent In view of tbe repeal by the act of
June 26, 1884, of all statutory provisions arbitrarily
compelling American vessel to carry the mat la to
and from tbe United State. As it is necessary to
make provision to compensate the owners of such
vessels for DerformlLir that service after April. 1885,
His hoped tbal tbe whole subject will receive early
consideration that will lead to the enactment of such
measures for tbe revival of our merchant marine as
tbe wisdom of Congress may devise.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION,
1 The three per cent, bonds of the government to
I tne amount oi more man iuu,uuu,uw nave since my
last annual measaee been redeemed by' tbe treasury.
The bonds of that Issue still outstanding amount to a
' little over $200,000,000, about one-fourth of which
I will be retired throunh tbe Derations of the sinking
fund during tbe coming year. A these bonds still
constitute tbe chief basis for tbe circulation of tbe
national banks, the aaestlon how to avert the con
traction of tbe currency caused by their retirement
is one of constantly increasing importance. It seems
to be generally conceded that the law governing this
matter exacts from tbe bank excessive security and
that upon their present tona aeposits a larger circu
lation than Is now allowed may be sraoted with safe
ty, I hope that tbe bill which passed the Senate at
tbe last session permitting the issue of notes euat to
the lace value or deposited nonus, wm commena it
self to tbe approval of the House of Representatives.
THE WAn DEPARTMENT.
lu the ei Dense of the war department the secret.
ry reports a decrease of more than f9,000,000; of this
reduction 15.600.000 was effected In the expenditures
for rivers and harbor and 12,700,000 In tbe expendi
tures for tbe quartermaster' department. Outside
of that department tbe annual expense of all the
array bureau proper (except possibly tbe ordnance
bureau) are substantially fixed charges, which cannot
be materially diminished without a change in tbe nu
merical atrength of the army. The expenditures in
tbe quartermaster' department can readily be sub
jected to administrative discretion, aud It i reported
by tbe secretary of war that as a result of exercising
such discretion iu reducing tbe Dumber of draught
and rack animal in the army, tbe annual coat of up-
Tbe renort of the I'oHtmasterOeueral acquaints you
with the present condition and ueed ot tbe postal
strvlce. It discloses tbe gratifying fact that the lss
of rereuue irom the rediution in the rate ot letter
postage, as recommended in my message of Decem
ber, 1882, and effected by tbe act of March 3, 18H3, ha
been much less thu was generally anticipated. My
recommendation of this reduction was based upon the
belief that the actual falling off in receipt from let
ter postage for the jear succeeding tue cuaoge oi rate
would be 3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,276,-
000. This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue
will soon be restortd to Its former volume iy the in
crease of Bealed corrtspondeuce. I confidently re
peat, therefore, tbe recummendation of my last mes
sage that tbe single rate of postage upon drop letters
he reduced to one rem wnerever me raj men oi iwu
cents is now required. Tbe double rate is only at offi
ces where tbe carrier e.vsteui is tu operation, audit
appears that at those omces where the carrier system
la In operation the increase of the tax upon local let
ter defrays the cost not only of Its own collection
and delivery, but of tbe collet tion and delivery of all
other mail matter. Tuis is an Inequality that oogbt
no longer to exist. I approve tbe recommendation of
tbe Postmaster General, that the unit of w eight In tbe
rating of flrstcUss matter should be one ounce in
stead of one-half ounce, as it now Is, Iu view of the
statistics furnished by the department, it may well be
doubted whether the change would result In auy lots
of revenue. That it would greatly promote the con
venience of tbe public is bejoud dispute.
Tbe free delivery sjstem has been lutely applied to
five cities, aud the total number cf offices lu which it
is now In operation is 159, Experience shows that Its
adoption uuder proper conditions is equally ansccom-
mouauon to me lmuuc uu au uuttuu iu tue
service. It Is more than Belf-snstalnlng, and for the
reason urged iy the rostmaMer uenerai may properiy
be extended. In the opinion cf that officer it i irop
er to prov ide means w hereby exceptional drspaUb in
dealing with Utter In free delivery offlce may be se
cured by payment of extraordinary poatage. This
scheme might be made effective by tbe employment

of tbe largo cities private express companies bave un
dertaken to outstrip the government mail carrier by
affording for tbe prompt trausmisfiou of letter bet

government to discourage such enterprises, and in no
better mode can that policy be maintained than In

TUE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The Attorney Qeneral renews the recommendation
contained in bis report of last year touching the fees
of witnesses and Jurors, lie favors radical changes
In the fee bill, tbe adoption of a s)stem by which at

of offender against Its laws.
THE INDIAN QUESTION,
Allusion has been made already to the circumstance
that both as between the different Indian tribe and
as between the Indian and the whites tbe past year
has been one of unbroken peace. Iu this circum
stance the President is ciad to nndiustincaiion oi tne
policy of tbe government In it dealing with the In-
atan question, anu connriamiuu ui iua iew wuivu
were fully expressed in hi first communication to
the 47th Congreas, The Hecretsry of the Interior
urge anew the enactment of a statute for tbe punish
ment OI crimes commiueu ou iue iluisu reerauuus.
and recommends tbe passage of tbe bill now pending
in tbe House of Representatives for tbe purchase of a
tract of 18,000 square mile from tbe Hioux reserva
tion. Beth these measure ato worthy of approval.
RADICAL MEASURES AGAINST POLYGAMY.
The report of tbe Utah commission will be read
with luterest. It disclose tbe resnlta of recent legis
lation looking to tbe preventiou and punishment of
polygamy in tbat territory. 1 still believe that if tbls
abominable practice can be suppressed by law, It can
only be by tbe most radical legislation consistent w lib
tbe restraints of tbe constitution. I again recom
mend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute polit
ical control or tne territory or man, ana provide ror
the appointment of commissioners with such govern
mental power In Its Judgmeut may wisely be put
Into their bands.
EXTENSION OF OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
In the course of this communication reference ha
been made to the policy of this government as regards
tbe extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper
to declare tbe general principle tbat should, tn my
opinion, underlie our national effort in tbls direc
tion, Ibe main conditions of tbe problem may be
thus stated: We are a people active in mechanical
pursuits and fertile in invention. Yto cover a vait
extent of territory, rich in agricultural products and
iu nearly au tne raw materials necessary ior success
ful manufacture; we bave a system of productive e-
wealth. This would require a monetary union of 1
America, whereby tbe ouwml of tbe bullion prodno- i
log eountrle and tho circulation of those which yield
mllher gold or silver could be adjusted In conformity
with the population, wealth and commercial iieed of
(-rii. ab man m inn rminirin mruinu un uiiuiuu
to the common stock, the surplus production of our
mine and mints might thus be utilized and a step I
tskeo toward tbe general remonetlzatlon of silver.
To tbe accomplishment of these ends, so far as they
CRUte attained by separate treaties, tbe negotiations
already concluded and now la progress have been di
rected, and the favor with which tbl enlarged policy
h thus far been received warrants the belief that It
operation will ere long embrace all, or nearly all, the
countries of tbls hemisphere. It In by no mean do
lirabie. however. ihi the policy under consiuersuon
should be applied to these countries alone. The
hcRlthrul enlargement of our trade with Europe. Asia
aud Africa should be Bought. Ity reducing tariff bur
den on such of tbelr ware a we nor other American
stales are fitted to produce, 'andj thus enabling our
selves to obtsln In return better market for supplies
of food, oi raw materials, and or me manuiacturra m
which we excel, It seen to me that many of the em
barrassing element In Iho great national conflict be
tween protection and free trade may thus be turned
to good account, tbat tbe revenue may be reduced so
as to no longer overtax the people, that protective du
ties may be retained without becoming burdensome,
tbat our shipping Interest may be judiciously encour
aged, tbe currency fixed on a firm basis, and above all
sucu a unity oi luieresiesiaousneu mong iu tururs
nf the Amnrlran svitem as will be of creat aud ever
iucreaslug advantage to them all. AU treaties In tbe
line of this policy which have been negotiated or are
iu proceiB oi negomuou contain a provision, ueeineu
to ne requisite tinder tho clause of the constitution
limiting to the House of Representatives the sntborl
ty to originate bill for raising revenue.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
Ou the 29th of February last t transmitted to Con
gress the first annual report of tbe civil service com
mission, together with communication from tbe
bead of the several executive departments of the
Government. Respecting the practical workl tiers of the
law under which the commission had been acting, the
good results therein foreshadowed bare been more
than realized. Tbe system has fully answered the ex
pectations of its frleuds In securing competent and
isnuiui puouo servants anu in protecting the appoint
ing officers of tbe government from tbe pressure of
personal importunity and from the labor of exam In
Ins the claims and pretensions of rival candidate for
public employment, The law ha had the unqualified
support of the President and of the hrads of the sev
eral departments, and the me rubers of the commission
nave perrormed tneir dune with zeal and fidelity,
Their report will shortly be submitted, and will be ac
companied by stich recommendations for n1arglng
tho scope of the existing statute as shall commend
themselves to tbe executive aud tbe romrnlxsloner
charged w Ith Its administration,
THE IUNKRUrTCY QUESTION,
In view of tbe general and persistent demand

CHOLERA PREVENTION,
The pestilence which for the past two years has been

President, lesiied certain regulations restricting, and
for a time prohibiting, the importation of rag and tbe
admission of bagagnof immigrant and of travelers
arriving from Infected quarters, Lest thiscoursemay

ance of labor by persona sentenced to Imprisonment
in tbe jail, the construction and occupation of wharves
along the river front, and tbe erection of a suitable
untitling tor tiistrict omces,
A PENSION FOR GRANT
1 recommend that, In recognition of tbe eminent

Hon, tbe Congress confer upon blm a suitable pru

GENER Kh RECOMMENDATIONS RENEWED.
Certain of tbe measures that seem to me necessary
and expedient 1 bave now, tn obedience to tbe consti
tution, recommended for your adoption. Aa respect
others of no less Importance, 1 shall content myself
with renewing the recommeudatloua already made to
Congress, without restating tbe grounds upon which
such recommendation a were baaed. Tbe preservation
of forests on tbe public domain ; tbe irrautlog of gov
ernment aid for popular education; the amendment
of tbe federat constitution so ai to make effective the
disapproval by the President of particular Items in ap
proprlatlou bitla; tbe enactment of statutes in regard
to nlline of vacauciea In tbe Presidential office, lu de
termining of vexed questions respecting Presidential
Inability are measure whUh may Justly receive your

The "Midnight Marriage." at Crosby
hall on Wednesday evening by tbeltadniund
Harry company, waa one of the strongest
dramatlo presentations ever witnessed in
llrattleboro. The marked sucoesa aobleved
by Mr. ltedmund and Mra. Darry In tbla piece
ia won strictly by faithful, straightforward
devotion to tbe principles of true dramatlo
art, without once appealing to popular favor
through stage tricks or clap-trap. Ia every
particular tbelr presentation Is dignified, ar
tistic in the true sense, and wholesome. The
support Is good, and In two or throe instances
ia notably excelleut. Tbe costuming Is ele
gant and tbe setting of tbe play satisfactory
In all respects.

A decided Improvement has been made In the
operation of the heating apparatus in the new
puniic acnooi nunuing since our allusion 10 ine
matter two weeks ago. Last week during the
Thanksgiving vacation Mr Alfred Hopkins nf
uriugepori, conn., ine invenior, was ncre wun an
assistant making some slight changes about the
furnaces and pipes and to superintend the opera
tion of the spparalus at tbe opening of Ibe new
term. On Wednesday morning several citizens
lalted the bu ding by Invitation of the commit
tee to see the operation of the srstem. The out
sldo temperature In the early morning was 16
above zero. Inside the building tbe various rooms
showed a uniform temperature of from 65 lo 70
deg. The furnacca had been left full of coal over
night with a alow draft and a small quantity bad
been addid to each In the morning. The hot air
was ueing ueuvcreu irom tne registers near me
top ot the rooms at a temperature of ISO deg., and
was going out of tho veutllators at the bottom at
a temperature of 00 deg. Thermometers hung on
the walls at various points In the larger rooms
showed the temperature to bo very nearly uniform
in an pans oi eacn room, i no air in ine nuiiuing
was soft ai d agreeable and a teat wltn the hydrom
eter showed tho moisture to be at attout the nor

In reality taking place. The quantity nf coal now
being used per day is from looo to 160) pounds.
The estimated quantity for a year's supply is loo

D is true that Charles's Grandmother Is
growing old, and it may even be true that she
Is growing a trifle foolish, but she is neither
so old nor so foolish as to be caught by blm
twice on tbe tame old trick. She has not

afterward, and has never paid the mouey to

bad every appearance of "making bis head

made blm tbe laughing-stock; of tne county,
does be suppose tbat anybody would enter
tain a proposition from him to pay money on
the settlement of any disputed point ? If b.

The failure of V. W. Frink, jeweler,
waa announced last Monday. About a year
ago Gen. E. Crowell and F. W. Child, be-
came bis sureties on a bank note for $!00,
taking a chattel mortgage ou all tbe goods iu
bi store aa tbelr security. Da Monday Mr,
Frink informed them that his market credit
ors were pressing him for settlements which
he could not make, and Mr. Cbilds therefore
took possession of tbe store under the mort
gage. On Wednesday afternoon J. G. Eddy,
representing a Boston creditor, tried to oust
Mr. Cbilds through a writ of attachment
placed in Sheriff Starkey'a hands for service.
and Mr. Starkey spent tbe afternoon in watch
ing tbe store and Mr. Cbllda under tddy i
orders, but tbe latter finally gave his job np
as something that couldn t be done. Mr,
Frink's liabilities are about $10,000, most of
which is for money owed fcr gooda to jobneia
and manntactnrera In lloaton and Mew lork
and In two or three Connecticut towns. Ilia
debts to Brattleboro parties are small. Whit
ney A Co. of Boston are the largest credit
ora, their claim being for about $2u00. Tbe
aaaeta are represented to be between $1X100
and soooo. tbe gooda In tbe store represent
ing nearly J.WOO in value. The probability
is tbat Mr, Frink will go into Insolvency,
tbat a compromise wilt be made with his
creditors after tbe claim ot Crowell and
Cbilds ia satisfied, and tbat be will then re
aume businesa.

TUE LATE JOHN .8TEABN8 OF HINSDALE,

THE TOWNHItENU AND QRAFTON MAIL ROUTE
A sTi'.oso n.Ei ron tub fbehent AnniNOE-
MENT.
70 mitort 0 The l'litrnix :
I noticed in tbe Issue of your psper of Nov. II an
Item from Townsbend to tbe effect thst tbe Inbsbl
tanta of Gralton and Townsbend are dlssstlsfied with
tbe chsnge recently made In the mall aerilce betweeu
these towns. Tbe chsnge Is an advantageous one, ss
a brief conslderstion of the facta will show,
The stsge formerly left Townsbend at 6 o'clock a.
sc., by way of Orafton, for Bellowa Falls, sod upon
tbe return trip lert Bellows Falla about 1 o'clock p. u.
and arrived at Townsbend about 6 r. H, All mail left
at Ibe Bellows Falls offlce for Townsbend snd Qrsf
ton sfter tbe departure of the Townsbend stsge re
mained at tbat office until tbe next day, unless for
wsrded to Brsttleboro by tbe mail trsln having be
tween 3 aDd 3 o'clock. All mall from New York and
south of Brattleboro, alao all Boston mall reaching
BrattUboro after 10:20 a. v., and tbe mall from Brst
tleboro, Dummeraton, Willlsmsvllle, Fsyettevtlle sod
Townsbend, for Orafton, after tbat time, remained at
Townsbeod overnight. Tbe chsnge msde ensbles
Orafton to receive all this msil tbe same evening, snd
also gives to Orafton a dally mall to and from 2tew
York.
Under the present arrangement tbe mall facilities
are much better for Townsbend and tbe towns west
and aooth of Tosrnshend to commanicate with Oraf
ton, which last-nsmed town bas retained all facilltlea
between Itself snd Bellows Falls which it had before
tbe change was msde.
Tbe stsge now leaves Townshend for Orafton upon
tbe arrival of tbe evening train over tbe narrow-gsugs
road, and returns from Orafton in aeason to connect
witb tbe mall train to Brattlenorotbe next mornlog.
If tbe stsge between Orafton and Townsbend should
be run and managed for tbe convenience of tbe pub
lic, as It undoubtedly will be, the change, aside Irom
tbe Increased mill facilities afforded, would alao fur
nish greater conveniences to the public so far as trav
el to and from Orsfton Is concerned. Tbe people of
Orafton could go by public conre)ance to Bellows
Falls each morning, arriving there about noon; or
tbey could come to Townsbend, and arrive in Brat
tUboro npon tbe morning train In season to take the
first train from there to Boston or New York.
If there Is any dlssslisfactlon on account of tbe
change made, it is not becaote of the increased mall
facilltlea or of tbe Increased convenience to tbe trav
eling public, but because the proprletoia of the stsge
lino between Orsfton and Bellows Fslls and tbe peo
ple cf tbe Falla would be glad, so fsr as tbelr Interests
sre concerned, to bsve the msll service continued ss
before, so thst Orafton woold reap but btlle, If any,
benefit from tbe narrow-gauge railroad.

THE COMMITTEE'S BETOBT ON TBE REAPS TJORO
EAILBOAD QUESTION.
To the Cillzentc Wilmington and all inlirttttd In lit
railroad enttrpritt ,-
At tbe town meeting recently held It was voted lo
rescind tbe vote bonding the town In aid of lb. road
projected from Brattleboro. Vthether that was a wise
and Judicious measure may baa matter of discussion.
Messrs. Russell, Smith and Barnard were elected a
committee to confer with Mr. Newton and gather snch
f sets aa he felt disposed to stste In relation to the con
tinuation of his line of rosd from Readsboro, tbe
present terminus, to this place. Agreeably to such
Instruction, we waited upon Mr. Newton, and here
with briefly glte the result of each cenference:
1st. Wesre authorized toatatethat Mr. Newton de
sires tbe road, and tbat he will stsnd ready to aid lib
erally lo ita construction ; tbst he bss alwaya expected
and designed to have tbe rosd extend above Heads
boro, and thai be would not have constructed tbe rosd
to tbst point bad he not had each Intention. Thia
aettlea the point that has been raised by aome, tbat
Mr. Newton would oppose tbe project.
2d. Mr. Newton does not propose to build the rosd
without aid from the Interested towns especlslly
Wilmington and Wbltlngbam. He feels tbst tba
towns ought to raise or gusraotee (8000 to tho mile,
or lo round numbera about f 90,000. Tbls Is comput
ing the dlatance aa a trifle over 11 Biles. Alter the
raising of this amount he stsnds resdy to complete
and equip in aood order. As to tbe control and man
agement of the road, he would be wtlbng lo lease his
Interest to tbe towns or to tskea lease of tbe towna
of their interest in the line, ss might be determined.
3d. As to freight rates, be ststed tbst 10 cents per
hundred would be tbe probable rate from Hoossc tun
nel to Wilmington, and pasaenger ratea about 6 cents
per mile.
.tb. Mr. Newton thinks the cost of bulMiog npon
tbe east aids of the river would be a trifle more tban
upon tbe west aide. In other words, be tbloka tbe
cost of bulldlog on tbe weat aide, piua tbe cost of two
bridges, woold Jnst about equal the cost of building
on Ibe esst side. Ssdiwga and Jacksonville would be
better convenlenced by tbe letter route, and on tbls
accoout It is probable it would be adopted.
Of course It Is unnecesssry to spesk of tbe fesllbll
Ity of tbe road aa regarda grade. Tbe grade from
Hoosao Tunnel to Readsboro Is about 65 feet to tbe
mile, and from Readsboro to Wilmington It would be
less. It Is not for your commute, to express tbeir
personal opinions, but we would suggest lost a town
meeting be called to consider and discuss this ques
tion. Respectfully submitted,
C. M. RUSSELL, Chairman.
