WEATHER FOR DECEMBER.
Rev. Irl R. Hicks Predicts All Sorts of
- Disagreeable Things.
Rev. Iri R. Hicks, the well known
meteorological prognosticator of St.
Louis, Missouri, announces a pro
gram of all sorts of disagreeable
weather for the month of December.
Ice, snow and sleet, blizzards in the
northwest and heavy . gales in the
lake region, together with a real old
fashioned snowy Christmas. '
Dr. Hicks forecasts might be con
sidered seasonable. Between today
and Sunday next he expects storms
cf rain which, will turn to sleet and
then to snow, passing from west to
east across the' country. ' Blizzards
may visit Medicine Hat, and the
waters of tfte great lakes will be
lashed into great fury. From De
cember C to 9 a bitter cold wave mav
be had and it is probable that earth
quates will lie heard from in other
parts of the world.
The second storm period will be
reactionary, with fitful, stormy con
ditions. The third storm period,
from Dec. 14 to 19, will be marked
with excessive storms of rain, snow
and sleet, attended and followed by
high, dangerous, winter gales, par
ticularly on the seas. Another
seismic and volcanic crisis will cen
ter on December 19, covering three
days before and after that date.
Heavy snow will be the feature in
the fourth storm period, which will
include Christmas day. In the fifth
period, from Deo. 20 to tbe end of
the month, there will be sudden
changes. Dr. Hicks says warmer
weather will be here Dec. 28, but
that J sudden change to a blizzard
will follow. He pi-opbesies that the
old year will go out with a great cold
wave from the northwest.

Local Merchants; Begla (Displaying
Vf ' Holiday ' Goods and old v and
Young Commence to Look.'
Three weeksjfrom Wednesday next
will be Christmas day, this may seem
a long time to shoppers who have
but a few Christmas gifts to buy ar.d
imagine that it can be done in a few.
days. But it isjnot long to merchants
who have to wait upon the many
customers who visit their stores.
In order that shoppers may become
interested in what the stores, have
on hand in the lino of holiday goods
several of the merchants have put
their window decorators to work
arranging displays of holiday goods
which will be placed on sale immedi
ately. These immediately take tbe
eye of prospective shoppers and
many purchases will be maie early
in the month. The holiday adver
tising has also been started in this
way many others are brought to the
stores before the big rush.
Almost every publication in the
country is at present advising all
Christmas shoppers to do their buy
ing early and have some feeling for
the employes and proprietors of the
stores pt the towns. By visiting the
stores when there is no large crowds
much better service is obtained from
the clerks and a 'better opportunity
is afforded to" look over the stock
and pick out articles.
For the past month Baraga county
merchants have been receiving con
signments of holiday goods and have
been Ion packing and p aci ig their
wares on display. All of the Christ
mas 6tock is now on hand and the
6tores are ready for the shoppers. It
will bo to the advantage of pro
spective purchasers to get busy at
once and purchase their gif,s as
early a. possible.
