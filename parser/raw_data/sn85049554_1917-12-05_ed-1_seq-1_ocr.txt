Hungarians employed in the mines of
the country will run Into the tens of

There are other thousands of Austro

London," Dec. 6.—President Wilson's
message to congress has the fullest
possible prominence in the morning

for much considered comment. JThe

The Times says there are no half
tones inr the message but reiterates
that formally It expressed dissent to
the president's distinguishing between
German government and the people no
more than the president can longer dis
