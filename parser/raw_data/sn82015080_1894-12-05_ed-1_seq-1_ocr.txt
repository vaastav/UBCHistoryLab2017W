"But, Tom."
said hi 8 later
Cecy, soberly,
"Aunt Aimee was
in the right It
wasn't fair of you
to be copying out the answers to the
algebra sums from Iomis HI ton's
hook."
"Who risked your opinion, miss?"
retorted Tom. "I suppoae a fellow
;m have his own thoughts, eh? And
I'll he even with Aunt Aimee yet; see
if I don't -hateful old maiil!"
Meanwhile, Aunt Aimee herself,
K-ienely unconscious of the tempest
of wrath shii h:id evoked, was ar
ranging flowers for the dinner table,
i inking softly to herself as she sorted
out the clusters of purple heliotrope,
the sprigs of scented geranium leaves,
Jind the half-open Xareehal Neil rose
buds, into their various vases.
She hal recently come into control
of her widowed brother's household,
and the rebellions Mid I nan bord innte
condition in which she found it, was
11 grief to her pintle feOttL Nells
carelessness as to dress an I regular
liahits; Cecy's utter d isreirard of rule
end command; Tom's habit of "cril-
bingM his 1 ss(,:is. and little Joe's
dreadful nntidinese in regard to his
hair ami finger-nails poor Aimee
feared that she never should be able
to entirely eradicate these ingrained
predilections.
Hut she had resolved to try her
best; and it was in the following up
of this resolve that she ha I unawares
won Master Tom's deepest hostility.
She was tall and graceful, with soft
brown hair, ores like the velvety
floss of the pansy petal, and a deli
cate complex io 1. win re each passing
emotion was photographed in pink
end white. Captain Astley took little
heed of the beauty to which he had
jil ways beefl accustomed. To him she
was "only Aimee," but ethers were
Hot so Mind n her brother.
' I'll he revenged on her," muttered
Master Tom lo himself, an 1 he
stragntway look lis sister Cecy Into
his confidence.
"Yon remember, sis, don't you."
said lie, "that she made you stay in
nil the afternoon that Saturday when
th Wells girll had their picnic, to
mend your frock, ready for Sunday?
Ar.il sho took away all year sweets,
nnd she makes yon practice on the
piano two hours every day, instead of
one. Now, doesn't she?"
"Yes," nodded Cecy, "that's very
true. Bat she tells mo nice stories,
and she gave me a little sandal-wood
M orK-box last week."
"Oh, bother the stories ami the
sandal-wood work-boxes!" said Tom.
"I tell yon. sis, I'm going to play her
Such a trick!"
"A trick, Tom?"
"Yes. .lust look here, l'vo written
her a red-hot love-letter."
"lint you can't write a love-letter
to your own uunt, Tom," pleaded
troubled tec v.
Tom chuckled.
"It's from Mr. Salvius," said he.
"Do yon suppose I haven't found out
tl;a Mr. Salvius admires her, and
"MY TOBY OWH."
that she likes him? Well. I found a
letter of his to papa about some busi
i ess the other day. And see! I've
imitated his writing exactly. She
never'll know the difference."
"Oh, Tom!" cried Cecy.almost carried
nway by the enormity of the con
spiracy. "Oh, I don't see how you
dared!"
"And it's all about how much he's
in love with her," said Tom, dancing
wildly about tho lawn in his delight,
"and asking her to be his wife. And
I'm going to post it to-day; and to
morrow he comes to our house to din
ner, to meet the old colonel, you
know, and Mrs. Jocelyn; and, of
course, she'll believe it's all a true
declaration, nnd what a state of
things that will be. eh, Cecy? And
you and I II be hiding somewhere to
hear her accept what's never been of
fered her."
The letter was duly delivered. Tom
and Cecy were hiding behind the
dining-room shutters when the mail
was brought in, immediately after
breakfast They saw the pink glow
fufTuse Aunt Aimee's lovely cheek as
she glanced over the contents of the
letter, on which Tom had spent so
much malicious mischief.
Bhe. had seen but very little of Mr.
Salvias' writing, and Tom's handi
work was really a very excellent im
itation. The style was, perhaps, a
little abrupt; but Mr. Salvius was un
like other men; and Aimee Astley'a
heart was full of wild, undefined rap
ture, all that day.
"He does love me, after all!" she
kept telling herself. "He loves me!
He wants me to he his wife! Oh, can
all this be true?"
M ss Astley dressed herself with
unusual care for the little dinner
party; while Master Tom turned sev
eral double somersaults on the lawn,
in the fullness of his ghoulish delight
Mr. Salvius. as it chanced, was the
first of all the guests to arrive. Miss
Astley was sitting in the parlor, her
fair face half hidden by the shadow of
a blossoming orange tree, which had
been brought in from the greenhouse.
Bhe looked up, at tho sound of hia
jap
slop, and rose, with the soft color
fluttering in her face.
"Oh, Ernest!" she said; "did yon
really mean it?"
"That I loved you, Aimee?" he an
swered. "If you have any doubt aa
to my meaning, let me reiterate it
again and again: 'I love you!'
And then he drew his chair very
clos to the low easy-chair on which
she was sitting, and put his arm ten
derly about her.
"My own!" said he. "My very own!"
Oreat was the amazement of Tom;
unboundod the mystification of Cecy,
when, on Corning in to dessert as
usual, they saw Aunt Aimee add Sir.
Salvius, seated side by Bide, appar
ently the very best of friends.
"Look! looki whispered Cecy. "Do
you see the diamond ring on her
engagement finger? She's engaged,
Tom, as sure as you live!"
"Weill if this isn't queer." said
Tom, grimly, biting into his peach.
Somehow the "capital joke" had
fallen flat to earth. There was noth
ing of embarrassment in Ernest
Salvius' mien; n:thin of mortifica
tion in the smiles that dimpled Aunt
Aimee's sweet face.
After the guests were gone, Captain
Astley called th ; children around him.
"Youuar folks," sail he, "I shall
have to engage a grim old governess
for you, after all. Mr. Salvius is
going to take Aunt Aimee away from
us. They are to be married next
month, and if Cecy will be very gooJ,
she shall be a little bri lesinaid, and
carry the bride's bouquet for her."
Tom and Cecy exchange I glances
once more. And at th ; instigation of
the former, Cecy followed Aunt
Aimee to her room, to hazard one last
question.
"Aunt Aimee," said she, "has Mr.
Salvius really proposed to you?"
"Yes, dear," answered tho young
lady.
"Would would you mind telling
me how? I should so much like to
know," faltered Cecy.
"He wrote me a letter, Cecy," said
the gentle bride-elect. "You'll un
derstand all these things yourself
some day."
But neither Cecy nor Tom could
fathom this mystery.
"I think there's witchcraft in it"
growled Tom. "I do."
Hut Mr. Salvius never told them
nor did Miss Astley herself ever
know that he himself had chanced
to bo reading in the little summer
house on the lawn, behind the creeper-covered
trellis, when the arch plot
was concocted, anil heard every word
of it
"The little imps!" said he to him
self. "If they only knew what a deal
of uncertainty and trouble they are
saving me!"
And so beautiful Aimee was
wooed and won, and tho secret was
always kept from Aunt Aimee.
RICHES OF NORTHERN SWEDEN
Vast Iron and I amber Counter Opnned
Cp by a New Iiallroad.
The Northern part of King Oscar's
realm has often been called "Sweden's
America" because of tho richness of
the land, although it is still unculti
vated, says the Stockholm correspond
ent of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
'llio poorer class prefer to emigrate to
the United States instead of seeking
new homes in Nordland, because that
part of the kingdom lacked means of
communication by land with the cap
ital. The coast cities suffered in the
winter when ice covered the 8ca as
much as the interior settlements suf
fered the year round. When it was
discovered that there were great hid
den riches there for the government,
it decided to grant money for the
building of a railway. The' Northern
Trunk line is now complete, and has
been opened by the king. He is said
to bo Sweden's ablest orator, and
ho mado the "speech of his life." The
festivities surpassed anything ever
seen hero. The new railroad con
nects at Boden. near tho gulf of Both
nia, with the northernmost railroad
in the world, running from the sea
port of Lulea up to the Gellivara iron
mountains, forty-seven miles north of
the polur circle. This road has been
in operation two years. It may be
considered the end piece of a continu
ous line of railroad about 1,250 miles
long, reaching north and south the
whole length of Sweden. The com
pletion of this line, it is believed, will
materially chock immigration to Amer
ica. Nordland contains more than
twenty per cent of tho lumber of the
world, and more than Canada and al
most twice as much as the United
States. The famous iron mines, the
largest in existence, are capable of
supplying the world for centuries.
The scenery is highly picturesque,
and tho new road presents much for
tourists.
It Was a Heal Compliment, Though.
At a dinner-party at Bo wood. Canon
Bowles, then past sixty, was intro
duced to an elderly lady, with whom
he sat chatting pleasantly about many
things of the day. Bowles was per
fectly oblivious that this was the very
lady to whom he had been engaged to
be married when he had very little in
come besides his curacy. The lady,
of course was perfectly well aware
that she was talking to her quondam
lover; but her married name had in
no way enlightened him as to her
personality. After a time she said,
having touched upon old days: "But.
Mr. Bowles.don't your remember me?'1
"No, ma'am, I don't." Then she
added, smiling: "You used to know
me and pretend to be very fond of me.
I was Mure " Oh, what a wreck!"
was the spontaneous exclamation of
the poet. Happily the lady enjoyed
the joke immensely, for she was a re
markably handsome woman of her
age, and his burst of surprise was
really only a compliment to the ex
treme beauty of her youth Argonaut.
Stag Fright.
Nervous prostration among actors
and actresses is commonly accom
panied by stage fright. Men and
women long accustomed to face the
public find themselves suddenly seized
with nervous fear even at the thought
of a rehearsal. Bicycling, as a pleas
ant and easy mode of exercise, has
been recommended in such cases, and
an actress who confessed that she
rose one mornincr with a dread of th
i afternoon rehearsal declared that after
two hours in the open air with her
j bicycle every trace of stage fright had
j disappeared.

Is the president's message to congress:

States: The assemblage within the nations

condition of o ir dsttoial affairs and recom
mending such le islation as seemj to be neces

The history of our recent dealin?e with
other nations and ourpeacful relations with
them at this time additionally demon
strata the advantage of consistently adhertn?
to a firm but just fofeign po licy, free from
envious or ambitious national schemes and
characterized by entire honesty mi sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a law of
congress, commissioners were appointed to
the Antwerp Industrial exposition, tnou-h the
participation of American exhibitors fell far
short of comp etely 1 lustralin? our national
ingenuity and indu-trial achievement, yet it
was quite ere lluble in view of the brief time
allowed for preparation
The termination or the civil war in Brazil
has been followed by the general prevalence
of peace and order It appearin ; at an early
state of the insurrection that its course would
eall for unusual watchfulness on the part of
this government our naval force In the harbor

precaution I am sitisfle.1, tended to restrict
the Issue to a simple trial of strength between
tho Brazilian government and the Imur.-ent.
and to avert complications which at timei
seemed imminent Our tirm attitude of neu
trality was maintained to the end. the in
surgents re ei vert no encouragement of event
ual asylum from our commvnders and such
opposition as they oacount-jred was for the
protection of our commerce and was clearly
justified by publlo law. A serious tension of
relation havin : arisen at ths close of the
war between Brazil and Portugal by reason
of IM escape of the insurgent Admiral De
trama and his followers The friendly offices
of our representatives to those countries
were exerted for the protection of the sub
Jecta of either within the territory of the other
Although the government of Brazil was duly
notified that the commercial arrangements
existing between the United State and that
country, based on tho third section of the
tariff act of 1K0, was abrosa'ed on Au. :t
1894, by the takin? effect of the tariff law now in
force, that government subsequently notified
us oflts intention to terminato such arrange

mention to the correspondence between the
secretary of slate and the Brazilian minister

The China-Japan War.

partiality of t his country towards all foreign
states was man ifested by the coincident re

to the subjects of the other during the sus

nnd a misapprehension which pave ri-e to tiaa
belief that In affording this kindly unofficial
rrotection our a ents would exercise
the .. me authority which tho with
drawn a.ents of tho bel igerents h d
exercised w as promptly corrected Although
the war between Ctil na and Japan endangers
no policy of tho United States it deserves our
i. raves t consideration, by reason of its dis
turbance of our growing commercial interest
in the two countries and the increased dangers
whloh may resuJt to our citizens domiciled or
ojourninr In the interior of China Acting
under a stipulation in our treaty with Korea,
(the first concluded with a Western power)
i felt constrained at the begl nnin of the
controversy to tender our good offices to
induce an amicable arrangement of the
initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese
demands for administrative reforms in
Korea but the unhappy precipitation of
actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose
Exploring the destructive war between the
two most powerful of tho Eastern nations
and anxious that our commercial interests in
those countries may be preserved and that
the safety or our citizens there shall not be
jeopardized I would not hesitate to heed any
intimation that our friendly aid for the
honorable termination of hostilities would be
acceptable to both belligerents.
The German Meat Prohibition.
Acting upon the reported discovery of Texa3
fever In cargoes of American cattle the Ger
man prohibition against Importations of live
etock and fresh meats from this country has
been revived It is boned that Germany will
soon become convinced that th ih-,iii.. i.
as needless as it is harmful to mutual In
terests.
The German government has protested
against that provision of the customs tariff
act which imposes a discriminating duty of
one-tenth of one cent a pound on su ars com
ing from countries paying an export bounty
thereon, clalmins that the exaction of such
duty is in contravention of art! -lea n
nine of the treaty of l&M with Prussia In the
uioh ui tus oommiroi or both countries
and to avoid even the accusation of treaty
violation I recommend the repeal of so much
of the statute as imposes that duty and I in

of the questions raised by the German pro
tests. The Hawaiian Incident.
Since communicating the voluminous cor
respondence in re.ard to Hawaii and the ac

sentatives on certain questions submitted to
the judgment and wider discretion of congress
the organization of a government in place of
the provisional arrangement which followed
the deposition of the queen has been an

has been accorded the new government
BlneSelds Affair.
Prominent amonir the questions of ter
ritorial jurisdiction of the year was the Blue
fields incident in what is known as the
Mosquito Indian strip h -rtlcrln: on the At
lantic ocean and within the jurisdiction of
Nicaragua By the treaty of 18S) between
Great Britain and Nlcara-rua the former
government expressly recognized the sov
ereignty of the latter over the strip and a
limited form of self government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to be
exercised accordinr to their customs for
themselves and their dwellers within its
limits. The so-called native government
which grew to be largely made up of
aliens for many years disputed the sov
ereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and
claimed the rlrht to maintain therein a practi
cally independent municipal government
Early in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to
maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito ter
ritory led to serious disturbances culminating
In the suppression of the native government
and the attempted substitution of an Impract
icable compact administration in which Nicar
agua and alien residents were to participate.
Failure was followed bv an insurrection which
for a time subverted Nicaraguan rule, expell
ing her officers and restoring the
old organizatioa This in turn gave
way to the existing local government
established and upheld by Nicaragua
Although the alien Interests arrayed against
Nicaragua in these transactions have " been
largely American and the commerce of that
re ion for some time has been and still is con
trolled by our citizens we cainot for that
reason challenge the rUhtful sovereignty of
Nicaragua over this Important part of her
domain For some months on and during part
of the term, two of our naval ships have been
stationed at Blueflelds for the protection of
all legitimate interests of our citizens. In
September last the government at Managua
expelled from its territory twelve
or more fwrelmers including two
Americans for alleged participation in the
seditious or revolutionary movements against
the republics at Blueflelds already men
tioned Through the earnest remonstration of
this government the two Americans have been
permitted to return to the peaceful manage
ment of their business Our naval commanders
at the scene of this disturbance by their con
stant exhibition of firmness and good judg
ment contributed largely to the prevention of
more serious consequences and to the restora
tion of quiet and order
I resret that in the midst of these occur
rences there opened up a most grave irritating

slowness of ber recuperation from the war of

in f acinar international obllj rations invite our
kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance
in pressing loa pendinj claims I have felt
constrained to testify this sympathy in con
nection with certain demands urgently pre
ferred by other powers
The recent death or the czar of Russia c died
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on tho part of our government with
his bereaved family and the Ru slan people
As a further demonstration of resoect and
friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at i he
funeral ceremonies
Under our pre ent treaties or extradition
with Italy mtscarria-es of justice have oc
curred owing to the refusal of that govern
ment to surrender its own subject 3. Thus
far our eft one to negotiate an amended con
vention obviating this difficulty have been un
availing. Apart from ths war in which the island em
pire is engaged Japan attracts increasing at
tention in this country by her evident desire
to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us
and seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy In her
domestic affairs and full equality in the family
of nations. Tho Japanese empire of to-day is
no longer tho Japan of the past and our rela
tions with this progressive nation should not
be less broad and liberal than those with
other powers.
Relations With Mexico.
Good will fostered by many interests in
common has marked our relations with our
nearest southern neighbor.
Peace bcin: restored alon? her northern
frontier. Mexico has asked the punishment of
the late disturbers of her tranquility. There
ouirht to be a new treaty of commerce and
navigation with that country to take the
place of the one which terminated thirteen
years a-ro. The friendliness of the Inter
course between the two countries is attested
by the fact during this Ion ; period The com
merce of ea h has steadily increased under
the rule of mutual consideration, bein ; neither
stimulated by conventional arrangements nor
retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish desires.
An indemnity tendered by Mexico as s
gracious act for the murder in 1S87 of Leon
Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band or
marauders in Uurang3, has been accepted and
is bein r paid in installment

scarcity is often severely felt in the regions
where the river forms a common bound

The government or Salvador bavin? been
overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak,
certain or its military and civil officers, whllo
hotly pursued by inruriated Insurgents sought

rtiuiou-rn me practice or asylum is not ra
vored by this I'ovcrnmont yet In view or the
imminent peril which threatened the ruritlves
and solely from considerations of humanity,
they were afforded shelter by our naval com
mander and when afterwards demanned under
our treaty or extradition with Salvador for
trial on charges of murder, arson and
robbery. I directed that anoh of them
as had voluntarily left the ship be conveyed
to one of our noarest ports where a hearin?
could be had before a judicial officer in com
pliance with terms of tho treaty. On their
arrival at San Francisco such a proceeding
was promptly Instituted berore the United
States district judge who held that the acts
constituting the allsged offenses were politi
cal and discharged all the accused except
Cienf uouos. who was held ror an attempt to
murder Thereupon I was constrained to
diract his release, ror the reason that an at
tempt to mur lor was not one or the crimes
char ed against him and upon which his sur
render to the Salvadoran authorities had
been demanded.
A convention has been concluded with Vene
zuela ror the arbitration or a loni disputed
claim growin r out or the seizure or certain ves
sels, property or citizens or the United States.
Although sinned, the treaty or extradition
with Venzueta is not yet in force, owing to the
insistence of that government, that when sur
rendered its citizens shall in no case be liable
to capital punishment
The rules for the prevention of collisions
at sea which were framed at the maritime
conference held In this city in 1889, having
been concurrently incorporated in the stat
utes or the United States and Great Britain,
have been announced to take effect March 1,
18U5, and invitations have been extended to all
maritime nations to adhere to them Favora
ble responses have thus rr been received
rrom Austria, France, Portugal, Spain and
Sweden
The sealing interests or Russia In Behring
sea are second only to our own A modus
Vivendi has therefore been concluded with
the imperial government restrictive of poach
ing on the Russian rookeries and or sealing in
waters which were not comprehended in the
protected area defined in the Paris award
Occasion has been found to ur.-e upon
the Russian government equality of
treatment for our great life insurance
companies whose operations have
been extended throughout Europe
Admitting, as we do, forei-h corporations to
transact business in the United States, we
naturally expect no less tolerance for our own
In the ample fields of competition abroad
But few cases of interference with natural
ized citizens returning to Russia have been
reported during the current year. One
Krzemln ki was arrested last summer in a
Polish province, on a reported charge of un
permitted renunciation of Russian allegiance
but it transpired that the proceedings origin
ated in allezed malfeasance committed by
Krzeminski while an imperial official a num
ber of years ao. Efforts for his release,
which promised to be successful were la
progress when his death was reported.

In recognition of the Ion r and distinguished

Department of Justice.
The report of the attorney irCneral notes tho
gratifvln r progress ma le by the supremo
court in overcoming the arrears of its busi
ness and in rcachin; a condition in which it
will be able to dispose of cases as they arise
without any unreasonable delay. This result
is of course very largely due to the successful
working of the plan inaujurating cirouit
courts of appeals. In respect to these trlbun
a tlr suggestion is made in quarters entitled
to the highest consideration that an addi
tional cirouit judre for each circuit would
greatly strengthen these courts and the
confidence reposed in their adjudications
and that such an addition would not create a
t rcater rorce or judges than the increasing
business or such courts requires I commend
the suggestion to the carcrul co:i3ideratl n ef
the congress. Other important topics are
adverted to the report accompanied by recom
mendations, many ot which have been treated
at lar .e in previous messages, and at this
time they need only be named. I refer to the
abolition of the tee system as a measure or
compensation to federal officers. The en
largement or the powers or United States
cemmissioner in the territories the allowance
of writs of error in criminal cases on behalf
or the United States and the establishment of
degrees in the crime of murder A topic dealt
with by the attorn ey general of much import
ance is the condition ot the administration of
justice in the Indian Territory. The perma
nent solution of what is called the Indian
problem is probably not to be expected at
once, but meanwhile such ameliorations ot
present conditions or the existing system will
admit ought not to be neglected I am satis
fled there should be a federal court estab
lished ror the territory with sufficient judges
and that this court should sit within the ter
ritory and have the same jurisdiction as to
territorial affairs as now vested in the federal
courts sittin; in Arkansas and Texas.
Eight years a,'o in my annual message I
urged upon the congress as strongly as I could
the location and construction of two prisons
for the confinement of United States prison
ers A similar recommendation has been
made from time to tims since and a few years
ago a law was passed providing for the selec
tion or sites ror three such institutions. No
appropriation has, however, been made to
carry the act into effect and the old and dis
creditable condition still exists
Another subject of pressln; moment re
ferred to by the attorney general is the reor
ganization of the Union Pacific railroad com
pany on a basis equitable as regards all pri
vate Interests and as favorable to the gov
ernment as existing conditions will permit
The operation of a railroad by a court throu ! h
a receiver is an anomalous state or things
which should be terminated on all grounds,
public and private, at the earliest possible
moment. Besides not to enact the needed
enabling legislation at the present session,
postpones the whole matter until the assem
blage ol a new congress and inevitably In
creases all the complications of the
situation and could not be regarded as a sig
nal failure to solve a problem which has
practically been before the present congress
ever since its organizalon
It is not my purpose at this time to repeat
the considerations which make an impre
nable case in favor of the ownership and man
agement by the government or the penal in
institutions In which federal prisoners are
confined I simply desire to a-aln urge
former recommendations on the subject and
to particularly call the attention ol the con
gress to that part of the report of the secre
tary or war, in which he states that the mil
itary prison at Fort Leavenworth Kansas,
can be turned over to to the government as a
prison ror federal convicts without the leas
difficulty and with an actual saving of money
from every point of view.
Pendln; a more complete reform, I hope
that by the adoption of the suggestion of the
secretary ot war this easy step may be taken
In the direction or the proper care of its con
victs by the government of the United States.
Postal and Navy Departments.
The message next takes up the report or the
postmaster general and stronriy urges the
recommendations of that official looking to
the correction of the abuses of the second
class mail matter privilege by publishers of
advertising matter, who send tons of papers
through the mail and defraud the government
out or minion or dollars postaze annually.
The free carriage of seeds of grain throu h
the mails Is also condemned If these abuses
were rectified the department would be self
sustaining. The report of the postmaster
general, which has already been published, is
reviewed at length
Attention is called to the report of the sec
retary of the navy which shows very gratify
ing progress in the construction of ships ror
our new navy.
I recommend that provision be made ror the
construction or additional battle ships and
torpedo boats The secretary recommends
the manufacture not only of a reserve supply
of ordnance and ordnance material ror ships
of the navy, but also a supply for the auxil
iary fleet Guns and their apnrtenanoes
should be provided and kept on hand for both
those purposes We have not to-day a single
gun that could be put upon the ships Paris or
New York ot the International Navigation
company or any other ship of our reserve
navy. The manufacture or guns at the
Washington navy yard Is proceedin ; satis
factorily, and none of our new ships will be
required to wait for their tuns or ordnance
equipment.
- During the peat fiscal year there has been
an unusual and p essin; demand in many
quarters of the world for the presence of ves
sels to guard American interests. In January
last, during the Brazilian insurrection, a

Ij.io de. Janeiro. The vt rorYrus action of Rear

Pensions.
The barefaced and extensive pension frauos
exposed under tho courageous and generous

leaves' nti rortm for fhe" eiftlm that no purgation
or our pension1 roll war needed of that con

that an effort to detect pension traiiqt is evi
dence or unrriendlineis towards our
worthy veterans and a denial of their
claims to the genero'sity 8t the gov

has for its motive the securing of a pension

The work done h tfc5 department of agri

An exceed In ly important recommendation

which contests and litigated cases growin 7
out of efforts te. obtain governmcmt land are
determined. The entire testimony upon
which these controversies depnr in all their'

power to subpoena witnesses or to enforce
their attend 1 nee to. testify.. These, cases,
number in j three or four thousand annually
are sent by the officers to tho commissioner
of the general land office for his action. The

his determination or t he - appeals must be
almost perfunetiortary and based upon the ex

in the opinion that the commissioner of tfie
general land office should b3 relieved from

Civil Service Reform.
The advantages to the publlo service or an
adherence to tha principles of civil service
rofvr.u are 'constantly more apparent and
nothing is so encouraging to those la official
life who honestly desire good government as
the increasing appreciation by our people of
these advantages A vast majority of the
voters or the land are ready te insist
that the time and the attention or
those they select to perform for
them important publlo duties, should not be
distributed by dolin? out minor offices and
they are growing to be unanimous in regard
ing party or anlzations as something that
should be used in establishing paity principles
instead or dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards of partisan activity
Numerous additional offices and places have
been brought within civil service rules and
regulations and some others will probably
soon be included The report of the commis
sioners will be submitted to the congress and
I Invite careful attention te the recommen

National Board Of Health.
t am entirely convinced that we ought not
to be longer without a national board of

no other duties than such as pertain to the
protection or our country from tho invasion

Strike Commission.
By virtue 08 a statute of the United States
passed in 188 I appointed in July last Hon.
J. D Keen of the state of Now 'S'orlc and
Hon. Nicholas E Wort bin: ton. of the state
or Illinois, to form with Hon. Carroll D.
Wri?ht, commissioner of tabor, who was des

purpose of making careful inquiry la to the
causes or the controversies between certain
railroads and their employes which had re
sulted In an extensive and destructive
strike, accompanied by much violence and
dangerous disturbance with considerable loss
ot lire and great destruction of property. The
report ot the commissioners has been sub
mitted to me and win be transmitted to con
gress with the evidence taken upon their in
vestigation. Their work has been well done
and their standing and Intelligence give as
surance that the report and suggestions they
make are worthy of careful consideration.
Tariff Amendments Urged.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
congress needs important amendments tf It is
executed effectively and with certainty In ad
dition to such necessary amendments as will
not change rates of dutv I am still very de
cidedly in favor ot patting coal and Iron on the
free list So far as the surer schedule Is con
cerned. I would be glad under the existing ag
gravations to see every particle of deferential
duty in favor of refined sumr stricken ent or
our tariff law. If with all the favor accorded
the sugar refintnz Interest In our tariff laws It
still languishes to the extent of closed re
fineries and thousands of dl -char red work
men It would seem to present a hopeless cese
ror reasonable leclslatlve aid
Whatever else is done or omitted I earnest
repeat here the recommendation 1 have made
in another portion of this communication that
the additional duty of one tenth of a cent per
FwuUu iiu upon sugar imported from coun
tries paying a bounty on Its export be abro
gated It seems to me that exceedingly im
portant considerations point to the pronrletv
or this amendment With the advent of a new
tariff policy not only contemplated to relieve
the cousumers of our laud In the cost of their
aaiiy me, dui to invite a better development
of American thrift and create for us closer
and more profitable commercial relations
with the rest of the world It follows as a logi
cal and imperative necessity that we should
at ouce remove the chief if not only obstacle
which has so lon prevented our participa
tion in the foreign carrying trade of the sea.
A tariff built uoon the theory that it is well to
check import4 and that a home market should
bound the industry and effort of American
producers, was fitly supplemented by a re-
lusai to allow American registry vessels
oum aoroaa inoazn owned and navigated by
our people, thus exhibiting a willingness to
abandon all contest for the advantages of
American trans ocean to carriage Our new
tariff poller bill uoon the theory that It is
well to encourage such importations as
our people need-and that out prod nets and
manufactures should find market in every,
part of the habitable globe la consistently
supplemented by the greatest possible liberty
to our Citizens in the ownership and naviga
tion of ships la which our products and man
ufactures may be transported The millions
now paid to foreigners for carrying American
passengers and products across the sea
should be turned Into American hands Ship
building, which has been protected to
strangulation, should be revived by the pros
pect of profitable employment for ships when,
built, and the American sailor would be resur
rected and again take his place, a sturdy and
industrious citizen in time of peace and a pat
riotic aad safe defender of American interests
in the day of eon filet The ancient provision
of onr taw denying American rertstry to ships
built abroad and owned fey Americans, ap
pears, in the light of present conditions, not
only to be a tailure for tood at every point,
hut to be nearer a relic of barbarism than any-
tbifi? that exists under permission at statu
of the United States. I earnestly recttaewtad

The Gold Reserve.
During the last month the gold reserves In

botes of thS govtffnmeut circulating as money

aCd its further depletion frt the near future
seemed So certain that in the exercise or
proper care ror ttiC puMte" weitare It became
necessary to replenish fhte reserve and thus
fitalntain popular faith in the ability and
detertRiretion of the government to meet as
agreed its pecuniary obligations. It would
have been well if Id this emergen -v authority
had existed to issue the" Tends of the govern

being the shortest time authorized by the act
IstA'adad to sav, however', that On the sale or
these bonds the premium recel ved operated to
reduce the rate ot interest to' be paid by the
government to lsj than three per cent

Even If the claims uon thli fund were con

and if the fedcmptloii Ot tbesd obligations
meant their cancellation the fund would be
very small. But these obli.attons when re
ceived sjnf? redeemed in gold are not cancelled
but are re-issued and may do duty many times
by way or drawing goM rrom the treasury.
Thus! we have an endless chain IS operation

bad enough we ilate a statutory declaration
that it is the policy of tho government
to maintain the parity between cold aird sil

to know that the protection afforded is only a
temporary palliation It is perfectly and pal
pat 1 iflaln1 that the only way under present
conditions uy which this reserve When
dangerously depleted, caih be replen

such authority will be utilized whenever and

to save the credit of our country and make
uooA the financial declarations of Our govern
ment Questions relatin to our banks and
currency are closely connected with the sub
ject just referred to and the? also present
some unsatisfactory features
New Banking; System Advocated.
Prominfcrit afflodg them are the lack of elas
ticity in our currency circulation and its fre
quent concentration in financial centres when
it is most needed in other parts of the' ob'mvtry'.
The absolute divorcement of the government
from the business of banking is the ideal rela
tidftshfp cjf the government to the circulation
or the currency 6t the cfiufltry This condi
tion cannot be immediately reached but as a
step in that direction and a a means ot secur
ing a more elastlo currency afid obviating
other objections to toe present arrange-"
ment of bank circulation the secretary
Of the treasury presents In his report a
scueme modifying present bankinr laws and
providing for the issue of circulating notes by
state banks free from taxation udder certain
limitations The secretary explains his plan
so plainly and its advantages are developed by
him with snch remarkable clearness tbet any
effort on my part to present arguments in its
supports would be surpufloua I shall there
fore content myself With an unqualified in
dorsement of the secretarys' proposed
changes in the law and a brief and tmpeVftct
statement of their prominent features
It is proposed to repeal all laws providing
for the deposit of United States bonds as se
curity for circulation to permit national
banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding
in amount 75 per cent of the. r paid tip and un
impaired capital provided they deposit with
the government as a guarantee fund m United
States legal tender notes including treasury
notes of IWtO. a sum equal in amount to 31
per cent of the notes they desire to issue, this
deposit to be maintained at all times but
whenever any bank retires any part of its cir
culation a proportional part of Its guar
antee fond shall be returned to it to
permit the seretary of the treasury
to prepare and keep on hand ready for Issue
In case an increase in circulation Is desired
blank national bank notes for each bank liar
lag circulation and to repeal the provisions
of the present law Imposing limitations and re
strictions upon banks desiring to reduce or in
crease their circulation, thus permittin? such
ncrease or reduction within the limit of
iseventy-five per cent of capital to be quickly
made as emer .e.icy arise In addition to t hi
guarantee fund required it is proposed to pro
Vide a safety fund for the immediate redemp
tion of the circulating notes of failed banks
by imposing a small annual tax say one half
of one per cent upon the av jra re circulation
of each bank until the fuad amounts to five
per cent or the total circulation outstaddidr.
When a bank tails its guarantee f un 1 Is to be
paid into this safety funds and Its notes are
to be redeemed In the first instance from such
safety fnnd thus au meatei; any impairment
of snch fnnd caused thereby to be made good
from the Immediately available cash assets of
said bank, and lj these should be insufficient,
auch impairment to be made good by pro
rata assessment among the other banks, tbei r
contributions constituting a first lien upon
the asets of the failed bank la favor of the
eontr.buting banks
As a further security it is contemplated
that the existing proposition fixing the indi
vidual liability or stockholders is to be re
tained and the bank's Indebtedness on ac
count or its circulatin r notes is to be made a
first lien on all its assets For the purpose or
meeting the expense or printinr notes, offi
cials, supervision cancellation and other like
charges there shall be impose! a tax of say.
onehaif of one per cent per annum upon the
average amount of notes in circulation It Is
further provided that there shall be
no national bank notes issued of
a less -denomination than ten dollars:
that each national bank, except in case ol a
failed bank shall redeem or retire Its notes in
the first instance at its own office or at
agencies to be designated by it, that no fixed
reserve used be maintained on account of de
posits.
Another very Important feature ot this plan
is the exemption of state banks from taxa
tion by the United states in cases where It is
shown to the satisfaction of the secretary ot
the treasury and comptroller of the currency,
by banks claiming such exemption that tbey
have not had outstanding their circulating
notes exceeding seventy-five per cent of
their paid up and unimpaired capital
that their stockholders are individually liable
for the redemption or their circulating notes
to the full extent of the ownership of stock
that the liability of such banks upon
their circulating notes constitutes
under their stste law a first lien upon
their assets: that snch banks have
kept and maintained a guarantee
fund in United States leal tender notes tn
cludln; treasury notes of 1890 equal to thirty
per cent or their outstanding circulating
notes, and that such have promptly redeemed
their circulating notes when presented at
their principal or branch office
it is quite likely that this scheme may be
usefullr amended in some or Its details, but I
am satisfied it furnishes a basts for a very
great Improvement In ear present banking
and currency system
I conclude this communication fully appre
elating that the responsibility for leri slat ion
affecting the people of the United States rents
upon their representatives in conrress and
assuring them that whatever accordance with
recommendations I have made or not I shall
be glad to co-operate in perfecting any l'gisi
tion that tends to the prosperity and a elf are

The royal snub is of all snubs thn
most brutal and at the same time the
most effective, unless it is th papal
sn'ib. U'httt Henry of Germany who
stood thn?e dayo barefoot in the snow
at Gregory's castle gate after seeking
him as a suppliant on foot over the
dangerous, snowy mountain route,
doubtless felt the force of a snub more
fully than any. unless it were some of
Henry Ill's victims. The Tudor dy
nasty especially excelled in the art of
snubbing, and it is difficult to de
termine whether bluff Hal or his ac
complished, intellectual, but withal
somewhat coarse daughter excelled in
snubbing thoso who, desirous of sun
ning themselves in the royal favor,
were forced to accept all royal insults
as excellent jeata. Kate M. Kabb in

A traveler stopped for the night at
a cabin in the Georgia woods. "I am
very hungry," said he to thO host;
"have you anything to eat?"
"Nuthin but 'possum."
The traveler winced, but watched
patiently for the repast.
After the lapse of. half an hour tho
host came in, accompanied by three
hound dogs, and holding a lightwood
torch aloft.
"Here," he said, to the almost
starving man, "take this rabbit foot
an' rub my shoulder with it."
"What is it for?" asked tho guest.
"Well, ding it all, ain't I got to go
out an' ketch a 'possum for yer
supper?"
Something- to Palut.
Mme. d'Albertin, one of the lesser
painters of France, was as conceited
about her artistic ability as she was
notorious for her use 01 cosmetics. On
one occasion a certain count, who held
her in much disesteem, lost a bet to
her. "And what will madame choose?"
he asked with mock courtesy. "Some
thing in my art," she simpered; "some
thing I can paint." "Very well,
madame," replied he, bowing himself
out. A day later madame received a
package from the count, which, upon
being opened, revealed a life-size
drawing of her own face in outline.

Westerner There's one nice thing
about the West. When neighbors
can't get along, they don't go on quar
reling for years, as they do here.
They just have one little spat, and af
ter that there are no hard feelings.
Easterner That's remarkable. How
do you account for it?
Westerner Well, you see, after the
spat the one that's alive ain't got any
thing to feel hard about.
