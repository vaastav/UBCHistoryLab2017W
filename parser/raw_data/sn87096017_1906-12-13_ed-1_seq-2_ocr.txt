AWARDED PEACE PRIZE

INDUSTRIAL PEACE COMMIT­
TEE AT WASHINGTON.
Ctarlstlanla, Norway, Dee. 11.—The
Norwegian parliament has conferred
the Nobel peace prize upon President
Roosevelt In recognition of his serv
ices In ending the Russo-Japanese war.
Candidates for this distinction must
be proposed by legislative bodies,
peace organizations or universities. It
Is understood that the president's
sponsors were Professor H. P. Judson,
acting president of Chicago univer
sity Professor Baldwin of Yale, Pro
fessor Harberger of the University of
Munich and the faculty of Georgetown
university, Washington.
The American minister, Mr. Pelrce,
In an eloquent speech, thanked parlia
ment in the president's name. He
said that words were Inadequate to
express the deep emotion which he
experienced at receiving this distin
guished testimonial in behalf of the
president, who recently cabled that he
regarded this prize as one of the great
est honors which any man In any
position throughout the world could
receive. The award, Mr. Peirce add
ed, would deeply appeal to the hearts
of the American people. Mr. Pelrce
then read a message from President
Roosevelt expressing his deep thanks
and saying there was no gift he could
appreciate more. The president also
announced that he had concluded to
use the prize to establish at Washing
ton a permanent industrial peace com
mittee with the view of maintaining
righteous peace In the industrial
world, which was as important as the
maintenance of peace in the world of
nations. The following is the text of
President Roosevelt's dispatch:
Gratified by Honor Shown Him.
"I am profoundly gratified and
touched by the signal honor shown
me through your body in conferring on
me the Nobel peace prize. There is
no gift I could appreciate more and 1
wish it were in my power to fully ex
press my gratitude. I thank you for
it and I thank you in behalf of the
United States, for what I did I was
able to accomplish only as the repre
sentative of the nation of which for
the time being I am president. After
much thought I have concluded that
the best and most fitting way to ap
ply the amount of the prize is by us
ing it as a fund to establish at Wash
ington a permanent industrial peace
committee. The object will be to
strive for better and more equitable
relations among my .countrymen who
are engaged, whether as capitalists or
wageworkers, in Industrial and agri
cultural pursuits. This will carry out
the purpose of the founder of the
prize, for in modern life it Is impor
tant to work for the cause of just and
righteous peace in the industrial world
as in the world of nations."
The Nobel peace prize is part of a
bequest left by Dr. Alfred Bernhard
Nobel, the Swedish scientist, who died
in 18!)ti. By his will a large portion of
his fortune was devoted to five annual
prizes, each valued at about ?40,000.
They were awarded for the most im
portant discoveries in physics, chem
istry, physiology or medicines, for the
most distinguished work of an idealis
tic tendency in the field of literature
and for the best effort toward the fra
ternity of nations and the promotion
of peace. The last named is awarded
by the Norwegian parliament. The
others are awarded by Institutions at
Stockholm.

Salt Lake City, Dec. 8.—The federal
grand jury that is Investigating coal
land frauds in Utah and charges that
railroad corporations have discrim
inated against certain shippers made
a partial report during the afternoon.
Indictments were returned against
the Union Pacific Railroad company,
the Oregon Short Line railroad, the
Union Pacific Coal company, the Utah
Fuel company and several of the high

man and Gould corporations In Utah.
The Indictments charge violation of

WRIT OF ERROR DENIED.
Federal 8upr«me Court Will Not Hear
Case of Mrs. Myora.
Washington, Dec. 8.—-The supreme
court of the United States, through
Justice Brewer, has denied the appli
cation of Mrs. Aggie Myers of Kansas
City, Mo., for a writ of error, which,
If It had been allowed, would have
had the effect of bringing her case to
that court. Mrs. Myers Is under sen
tence of death In Missouri on the
charge of murdering her husband In
Kansas City a year or more ago. The
effect of the decision will be to leave
the matter In the hands of the state
authorities.
SHOT BY UTAH WOMAN
EX-SENATOR BROWN 6F THAT
STATE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED
IN WASHINGTON.
Washington, Dec. 8.—Former Sena
tor Arthur Brown of Utah was shot
and perhaps mortally wounded late
this afternoon in his room at the
Raleigh hotel by Mrs. Annie Bradley
of Salt Lake City.
"I was fully justified In doing what
I did," was the only statement Mrs.
Bradley would make.
Senator Brown apparently Is In a
dying condition in the Emergency hos
pital with a bullet wound though the
stomach and another in the hand. Sev
eral blocks away from the hospital
Mrs. Bradley was pacing the floor of
the matron's room in the police sta
tion, anxiously inquiring every few
minutes as to the condition of her
victim.
"I loved the ground he walked on,"
she continually remarked.
Her condition at midnight was such
as to render a medical examination as
to her sanity necessary. As the night
wore on she lost her composure and
gave every indication that her reason
had left her.
The cause of the shooting, so far as
Mrs. Bradley will say, is that Senator
Brown was the father of two of her
children, Arthur Brown, Jr., seven
years old, and Montgomery Brown,
three years old, and that he refused to
marry her despite his repeated prom
ises to make her his wife.
SLAP AT COUNT BONI
HALF THE CHAMBER WALKS OUT
WHEN CASTELLANE ARISES
TO MAKE A SPEECH.
Paris. Dec. 6.—A remarkable scene
followed the interpellation of the gov
ernment on the Moroccan question in
the chamber of deputies by M. Jaures,
the Socialist leader. Count' Boni de
Castellane unexpectedly ascended the
tribune, whereupon half the deputies
abruptly left the house.
Count Bonl, however, was not great
ly disconcerted. Wearing a red neck
tie and a lavender colored waistcoat
and with his hands in his pockets he
addressed the chamber after M. Jau
res, airily arguing that France was
continuing the policy of ex-Foreign
Minister Delcasse, who aimed at the
conquest of Morocco.
After Count Bonl de Castellane M.
Herbet, reporter of the Algeciras con
ference, and M. Pinchon, the foreign
minister, had spoken the chamber
passed a vote of confidence in the
ministry, 457 ayes to 56 noes.
The Algeciras convention was then
ratified by the unanimous vote of the
chamber.
FAMINE AFFECTS MILLIONS.
State Department Informed of Condi
tions in China.
Washington, Dec. 7.—A serious
famine, affecting millions of people,
prevails throughout Central China, ac
cording to a cablegram received at the
state department from Shanghai. This
is the first Information the govern
ment here has received that such a
serious condition exists. The dispatch
adds that' the sufferers are on the
verge of actual starvation.
CHINESE LABOR FOR PRUS8IA.
Step Necessary Owing to 8earcity of
Farm Help.
Danzig. Germany, Dec. 6.—The agri
cultural chamber of West Prussia has
adopted a resolution empowering its
executive committee to prepare to Im
port Chinese farm laborers in order to
relieve the present scarcity of such
hor. The chamber added that, from
the ntiiinnt'l standpoint, it regretted
to huv.e to import Chinese, but that
ne Kief was linavoidable.'

GILLETTE CONVICTED
JURY AT HERKIMER, N. Y„ FINDS
HIM GUILTY OF THE MUR­
DER OF GRACE BROWN.
Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 5.—The jury
has pronounced Chester E. Gillette
guilty of murder in the first degree in
killing Grace Brown, his sweetheart.
The twelve men deliberated three
minutes less than five hours before
they reached their verdict. Five bal
lots were taken. Four resulted in
eleven for conviction and one for ac
qqfttal.
Two hours elapsed between the
fourth and .fifth ballots and during that
time the men who felt sure of Gil
lette's guilt argued and worked upon
the one man standing against them.
When the verdict was announced
Gillette was the most unconcerned
man in the room. He sat motionless
as one after another the twelve jurors
arose to their feet and declared that
they were united in their decision.
When the twelfth man had responded
the stolid indifference or studied com
posure of the boy was exhibited as
never before. Leaning oyer a nearby
table he wrote this message to his
father in Denver:
"Father: am convicted."
The verdict means death in the elec
tric chair.

James Theodore Isfahan, who suc

as president. He sided with Edward

that of a track laborer. He drifted
from Virginia to Nashville, Tenn.,
where he held various jobs on- the
Louisville and Nashville road and in
1873 secured the position of rondmas
ter of the Nashville and Decatur line.
From 1879 to 1881 he was superintend
ent of the Memphis division of the
Louisville and Nashville. He was
gradually promoted until In 1884 he
was made general manager of the
Louisville and' Nashville system. In
the next few years he held several dif
ferent positions, and one of these was
that of general manager of the Chesa
peake and Ohio railroad. He made a
good move in his acceptance of the
post of general manager of the Louis
ville, New Orleans and Texas railroad,
for under his direction the possibilities
of the line became so apparent that he
was able to negotiate the sale of it to
the Illinois Central. The result of
this deal was his elevation in 1900 to
be second vice president of the latter
company. When he assumed the du
ties of this post he was given charge
of the operation of the entire system,
being responsible o.nly to Mr. Fish.

Matt, xxrlll, 6 Comaaeatarr Pre
pared fey Rev. D. H. Stearaa.
ICopyright, 1806, by American Prea Aaociatlon.1
As He died the veil of the temple,:
which separated the holy from the
most holy place, was rent In twain,
that veil representing His body (Heb.
x, 20), In which the glory had been
concealed all those yean of His hu
miliation. There was also an earth
quake, and many graves of the saints
were opened, but the bodies of those"
Mints did not come out of their graves
until after He was risen (Matt xxvll,
61-63). Then they went into Jerusa
lem and were seen by many. We may
hope that the centurion who saw Him
die and said, "Certainly this was a
righteous man," "Truly this was the
Bon of God," received Him as such,
even as the penitent thief did. When
the bodies were taken down from the
crosses, the legs of the thieves having
been broken to hasten their death,
there was probably some kind of a
grave to receive the three bodies. Ac
cording to Isa. 1111, 9, "they made His,
grave with the. wicked," but the next
word had to be .fulfilled also, and so
Joseph of Arlinathea, a rich man, ask
ed Pilate for the' body and, with the
assistance of Nlcodemus, prepared the
body for burial and laid it in his own
new tomb. The women from Galilee
saw where and how the body was laid,
and, returning, they prepared spices to
anoint His body when the Sabbath
should be passed and rested the Sab
bath day. None of them believed that
He would rise again, not even Peter
and John (John xx, 9), although He
had told them so often and so plainly
that He would rise again the third day.
Little faith and even actual unbelief
characterized ofttimes the men whom
He had chosen to be nearest to Him.
And how it must have grieved Him!
How pitiful His questions, "How is it
that ye do not understand?" (Matt, xvl,
8-11) "Have I been so long time with
you and yet hast thou not known me?
(John xiv, 9.) The Sabbath being past,
very early on the first day of the week
several of the women came to anoint
His dead body, wondering how they
could roll away the stone, but they
found the stone rolled away and an
angel sitting on it, who bade them to
"fear not" (verse 5), but come and see
where His body had lain and go and
tell His disciples that He had risen, as
He said that He would. Mark says
that they entered into the tomb and
saw a young man sitting, who said
similar words to them. Luke says that
similar words were spoken to them by
two men who stood by them in the
tomb, and in these several accounts
there is no disagreement whatever, but
simply the assurance that two heaven
ly messengers were there and assured
them that Jesus was risen from the
dead. The strange thing Is that this
should have at all surprised them or
have seemed to the disciples when
they heard It like an Idle tale (Luket
xxlv, 11). Yet to many a professing
Christian today the death and resur
rection of Christ are of no more practi
cal benefit than an Idle tale, for they:
have neither the joy nor the reveren
tial fear of verse 8. They have noth
ing worth telling, and therefore there
is no going quickly (verse 7), and the
four great "ails" of verses 18 to 20 are
nothing to them. When the mighty
truths of His great atonement do not
move us mightily they are evidently no
more to us than idle tales. Many are
like those of verse 17, still doubting
with the living Christ before them.
Before His appearance to the women,'
according to verses 9, 10, we must
consider His first appearance to Mary
Magdalene as she stood weeping at the
tomb, looking for a dead body and
blinded by her tears and unbelief,
though filled with love. He was then
on His way to His Father in His res
urrection body and for that reason did
not allow Mary to touch Him (John
xx, 17), while in our lesson today He
allows these women to hold Him by
the feet and worship Him. Between
His meeting with Mary and His meet
ing these other women He must there
fore have been to the Father and re
turned, and thus He evidently did
many times during those forty days
until He finally ascended from Olivet
not to return till He comes to the air
to welcome His church.
Besides these two appearances on
that glorious resurrection day there
were three others—to Peter, to the two
who walked to Emmaus and to the
disciples gathered together that even
ing. In the early morning He said to
Mary, "Why weepest thou?" (.John xx,
15) and in the evening He said to the
disciples, "Why are ye troubled, and
why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"
(Luke xxiv, 38, 39.) To the women in
our lesson He said, "Be not afraid"
(verse 10), and to the disciples in the
must be some great unbelief on our
part If we are slow to obey His com
mands, "Go tell," "Go teach" (verses
10,19), can we truly say that we know
Him? If we do know Him and yet are
slow -to tell of Him and His wonder
ful redemption we certainly do not
know. Him as we might, for when once
we come to know Him as we should
our testimony will be. "We cannot but V.
speak of things which we have seen
and heard" (Acts Iv. 20). He said. "As
My Father sent Me, even so sc. I I
you," "And. l'o, I nm with you ail le
