ROYAL B'AKING
'PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Summary* of Mr. Roosevelt's Annual
Communication to Congress-A Long,
Able and Interesting Document.
As the limited space of The Chief
will not permit the reproduction of the
full text of President Roosevelt's an
nual message to congress, which was
issued Tuesday, Dec. 4, the following
summary is borrowed from the col
umns of our esteemed contemporary,
the New Orleans Times-Demo'crat:
The president again recommends a
law prohibiting contributions to polit
ical campaign funds by corporations,
directly or indirectly.
Pleads for the passage of the bill
giving the government the right to ap
peal on questions of law in criminal
cases, and for a law preventing the
setting aside of judgments on techni
calities where the merits are not af
fected.
Urges the enactment of a law to pre
vent the abuse of the power of injunc
tion and defends the proper and tem
perate criticism of judges and their de
cisions.
Condemns lynchings and the crimes
which lead to lynching; urges orderly
negroes to aid in the punishment of
the criminals of their race; urges
speedy trials in cases of assault, and
favors death sentences in cases of as
sault and attempted assault. Lawless
ness grows by what it feeds upon, and
when mobs begin to lynch for assault
they soon lynch for other crimes. The
two races can never get on until there
is an understanding on the part of
both to make common cause with the
law-abiding citizens against criminals
of any color.
Condemns a policy that would give
to negro public school education only
the money proportionate to the taxes
paid by negroes.
Preachers of discontent in matters of
labor and capital should not be coun
tenanced. Both capital and labor
should have all their rights, but no
more. The election of an unworthy
and sinister agitator on a platform of
violence and hypocrisy is the worst
blow that can be given popular govern
ment.
Asks congress to investigate the
conditions of child labor.
Recommends the strengthening of
the employers' liability law.
Would have labor and capital dis
putes investigated and arbitrated by a
disinterested commission.
Public coal lands should be with
drawn from entry and saved for the
generations to come.
Recommends no legislation on cor
poration regulation until the recently
enacted laws have been given a fair
trial.
Favors a graduated inheritance tax
and, if possible, a graduated income
tax.
Urges technical and industrial train
ing in the schools and agricultural ed
ucation for the benefit of the farmers.
Asks for appropriation for a memo
rial amphitheater at Arlington Ceme
tery.
Advises a constitutional amendment
so as to provide uniform marriage and
divorce laws.
Urges the developing of American
shipping and reform of the currency.
Asks congress to lower the tariff on
products of the Philippines, declaring
no American industry wiil be hurt.
Recommends American citizenship
to the people of Porto Rico; revenues

NEW ORLEANS LETTER.
Christmas Displays at the Shops-Bemark.i
able Weather-Battleship Louisiana
Artives to Receive Her Silver Ser
vice-Miscellaneous Matter.
New Orleans, La., Dec. 12, 190.
Staff Correspondence of The Chief.
Christmas shopping and Christmas
shoppers are turning Canalstreet into
a very festive place these days, and
the show windows of nearly all the big
stores are indeed revelations of the
decorator's art. Holmes' centeer win
dow has a gorgeous display of many
giant holly wreaths rising from amid
a wonderful confusion of playthings
ranging from the tiniest wooly "Teddy"
bear to the most perfectly appointed
toy automobile. This Christmas sea
son is a great season, sure enough, and
a sight of the big moving picture of
Canal street is bound to fill you with
the holiday spirit and egg you on to a
reckless disbursement of your pennies
whether or not you can really afford
to do much buying.
I don't want to talk about the
weather, but have you noticed the re
markable character of this particular
commodity we've been having here of
late? It would almost seem as if sum
mer had missed her cue and corms
dancing into the limelight long before
her proper time for appearing, for
certain it is that regular summer
weather has been prevailing here all
of last week and the better part of this
week as well. It behooves the weather
man to sit up and take notice, for if
he doesn't quit getting his dates mixed
in this way, some sensational maga
zine writer is going to hop up and
electrify the world with burning arti
cles on "Frenzied Forecasts," or,
"The Treason of the Temperature,"
or something else equally startling in
the way of climatic muck-raking.
The event of the week in New Or
leans will be the presentation of the
magnificent $10,000 silver service to
the battleship Louisiana, which is to
occur Saturday. The ship arrived in
port on Tuesday, and thousands of
visitors are expected to board the
splendid vessel. The service which s
to be presented to the Louisiana was
designed by Coleman E. Adler, a lead
ing jeweller of this city, and has been
on exhibition in Mr. Adler's store
window in Canal street during the
past week. Governor Blanchard is to
make the presentation speech, which
will be responded to by Capt. Albert
R. Couden, commanding the vessel.
Hon. Henry McCall, collector of the
port of New Orleans, will propose a
toast to the president of the United
States, Congressman Adolph Meyer
will pay a like compliment to the see:
retary of the navy, and Admiral Fred*
eric Singer, commandant of the New
Orleans navy yard, will respond. The
Louisiana will remain in the harbor
of the Crescent City until the early
part of next week, and elaborate ar
rangements are being made for the en.
tertainment of her officers and crew
during their brief sojourn in our hos
pitable harbor.
Striking employees of the Southern
Pacific Railroad or their sympathizers
have been guilty -of further lawless
ness, and in Algiers Thursday evening
of last week brutally assaulted two
clerks and a mail messenger in the
company's service. It is charged that
members of..the city police department
were being influenced by the stelker
codntiued on alhthi Peg..
