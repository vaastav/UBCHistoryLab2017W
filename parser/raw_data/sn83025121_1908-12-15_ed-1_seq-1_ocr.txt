ON SCRAP PILE
Yacht Hawaii Would Not Sell
for Enough to Clear Her
of $3000 Debt.
"If tho yacht Hawaii wero to bo
broken up, she would boivorth several
thousand dollars for old metal, but I
doubt if anyone would' buy her for
that price as a yacht," said W. II.
yesterday, discussing the sought-for
disposition of the racing craft that
cpst somewhere in the twenty thousands
and which is'ballasted now with a debt
of three thousand. Mr. Mclnerny wont
further in ono stage of tho discussion
and gave as his opinion .that the'yncht
could not find a buyer willing to take
her over for tho amount of tho 'balanco
due on her, except as scrap.
"I have, nothing to do with tho plan
of asking the contributors to tho yacht
f unuV to transfer their share in the
yacht to tho Hawaii Yacht Club," ho
said. "All LJtnow is that tho yncht
is in tho keeping of three of us, and
that besides tho thousand dollars we
each advanced for tho race, all tho cost
of her upkeep now falls on ub personally.
I think tho plan proposed now,
however, is tho best one. As things
aro, each contributor holds a receipt for
money donated to the yacht fund, but
no ono actually owns any sharo of the
yacht. By transferring their stock to
the Yacht Clab and becoming' members
of the club, bowevor, they wonld own
just the same in the yacht as now and
also have an in'torestin the club, which
has tangible assets. I do not know of
any other way to settle tho ownership
of tho boat. There would bo no use
selling her with an ideofof paying back
the contributors on a pro rata basis, be
cause the would not bring enough. 'People
will pay seven or efght thousand
dollars for an automobllo, but no nno
here wonts to put that amount of money
into a yacht any more."
hours to go over tho long list of names
and special committeo find
ings. Tho endorsements were mado last
night solely ou tho basis of tho carat
mark oif tho applicant's Democracy,
thero beng no attempt to delvo into
tho fitness of tho various applicants for
tho particular place each wanted on tho
county payroll. Tho decisions in that
respect will bo up to Fern and
Then, beforo the great time of actually
holding offico comes, -will como
tho battle between tho Democratic
Mayor f there is a D6mocratic Mayor
and tho Republican Supervisors. So
far as the police forco goes, of courso,
Jarrett will havo a frco hand.
In all thero tore applications from
ono hundred and real and
near Democrats for various jobs on tho
police force, and ono hundred and fourteen
for jobs under tho Mayor. Tho
applications of moro than half tho will'
ing ones were endorsed and G. J.
named to prosent tho lists of the
eligible ones to Messrs. -Torn and Jarrett.
In the rush for places it is singu
lar that the majority of Democrats
wanted the minor jobs. For tho important
places only tho few names given
at tho bead of 'tho column wero endorsed.
There was only one application
in Bight -for tho office of. County Engineer,
ono of the best plums on tho tree.
Johnny Wilson, who was supposed to
bo slated for ihis job, and perhaps is,
was not mentioned cither 1 as an applicant
or as ono endorsed. Thero was
only ono application on filo for tho office
of secrotary,to tho Mayor, tbat of
Charles L. Rhodes. It seemed to bo a
surpriso to somo present that no application
was in from Honry W. Kinney,
of tho "Bulletin staff, who was supposed
to be doing some considerable canvassing
for tho position.
No ono wants to bo Senior Captain
of Police, evidently, although thero is
room for putting 11. A. Juen in tho
role of applicant for that high post;
his endorsed application being for
"something on the police force."
From what could bo gathered at the
mpetlng there is only one applicant for
'Uio post of Chief of Detectives who
has a chance, that being the present
detective, who holds down
firmly. It was stated that
Sheriff-elect Jarrott favors Kalakiela
and will retain him in office.
The position of Coachman to tho
Sheriff is something new, but may have
been added to the list of positions to
balanco an expected one of Chauffeur
to tho Mayor. Mr. Fern, It is said,
has already been sounding the Supervisors
to learn if they would stand
an appropriation of $5000 for a 1909
model automobile for -the 1909 model
.Mayor.
Thero are plenty of applications for
the position to bo vacated by Deputy
Sheriff-elect Rose, that of Sheriff's
clerk. For this job the committeo has
endorsed the applications of Fred Tur
rill, Solomon Mehcula, J, W. ABch and
.lose J, Bias.
Among some of the qthor endorsements
are the following: l
Receiving clerk, police station -Wm.

It was explained after the meeting
last night tbaf ha choico of the
