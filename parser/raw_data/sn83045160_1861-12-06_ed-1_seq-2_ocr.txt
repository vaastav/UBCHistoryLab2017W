Black .Republican functionary before the bom

It is no unimportant issue, a the ai-erbity of
temper with which it is discussed by the press
of Missouri, Kentucky and Maryland readily indi
cates. L'pou its decision rests the determination
of the attitude takeu by a large portion of the
aiaveholding population of these States, who are
now disposed to support the war policy adopted
hv the Lincoln government. It is saying too
little to assert that its adoption, as a filed feature
of the administration policy, will iose every non
seceded slave State to the enemy, for that

" we trust be will be taught to speak like a man

the query : "Has (ionerai Sherman proffered

The St. Louis Democrat asserts that " it is
more than nttibutively just to confiscate the
vry property which, next to munit.uus, is most
serviceable to the rebels in the war, and which,
as an element of their society, first stimulated
them to treasonable projects" for "at this
time." it adds. " for military purposes, an able
bodied slave is about as valuable as individually
the one-half of their soldiers.'' The latter is cer
tainly a discovery of recent origin among the
abolitVnists, as it is only of late that their
graphic sketches of negTo insurrections, that
were to embarrass the rebels so formidably. hav
proved to be utterly visionary and baseless But
thus reasons the Democrat :
In discussing the question, it ought always to
be horse m miud that Jus rebellion, from its in
ception. is but the outbreak of the nnqnset. tur
bulent system of slnveholding. It was th.
slaveholders of the planting States who began
the revolt : partly, perhaps, in the imagined in
teresiseof slavery, and partly in the arrogance
which is incident to the relation of master, de
manding political power in their own hands, an !
enraged at being deprived of it by the fiat of the
people.
The St Lotus Sort, wi the contrary, expresses
the hope that LlS oi,.s will avoid aii intermed
dhug with auinstituti.ii, interference with wbicli
would be certain to produce complications, per
plexities and difficulties, that would harraas au,i
cripple the country for generations after the war
had ended."
The Reynlluan. is still more emphatic, anil
intimates that the recommendation of the em at.
npating poucy in the President's message would
produce a disaffection in the border slave State
that would result in their speedy se cession.
The Louisville Democrat, too. is severely exer
cised, and vents its spleen frantically on ( am
EftOK. It says:

mm MESSAGE
TO THK nmkh MNIM !
WAR ! WAR ! WAR !
The Abolition of Slavery
His Policy !
Telegraphed to Ike Apix iii.
Col t MBio, Kv., Ieceinler fth The St
Lauis ft publico of yesterday ha been received
here to-night containing Lincoln's message in
full, as delivered before the regular sossiou of the
Federal Congress, which met at Washington on
Monday.
In the commencement of the message, he ex
presses the apprehension that the existing rebv
tious between the Federal government aud for
eign power are not on as firm a basis of friend
ship as they should be. Yet he hoes to con
vince them that the proper means of re-establishing
a system of commerce throngh which they
will be enabled to get a supply of cotton w ill best
be effected by the preservation of the I'nion
He recommend that East Tennessee. West
ern North Carolina and Kentucky be connected
with other part of the Union by railroad as a
military measure. He suggests several different
routes for this road, and thinks that Kentucky
wUI CAeoperate with the government in its im
mediate construction.
He propose to pay the owner of the British
shin Perthshire for her detention by the Federal
steamer Massachusetts, which was occasioned
owing to a supposed breach by her of the laws
of blockade.
The message reiterate the charge of piracy
against the privateeramen who haAc been cap
tured, and authorizes instruction to lie giA-en to
captains of sailing vessels to recapture all priies
which pirates ( privateers) may have made up
to this time.
He makes a boast of the number of troops
tendered the government, but still advises the
reorganization of the militia, and declares that
the safety of the country depends upon this
arm of the service. Also, that the present or
ganization of the navy is defective, and accord
ingly he recommends au impn veinsnt.
The codification of the laws of the l'uite.1
States is suggested.
The government, he alleges, has refrained
from establishing courts in the revolted States to
liettcr facilitate the collection of debts, for fear
of assumuig arbitrary power, but the hope is ex
pressed that Congress w ill be equal to the de
mand, and will establish some temporary ar
rangement of the kind to answer the purpose.
Tbe deficit iu the Post Office Department for
the present fiscal year i hown to be over five
and a half millions of dollars, but the message
hopes it will improve by the next year. It pro
poses negotiations with V irginia itlie Piupout
government) for the purpose of regaining that
portion of the 1 hstrict of Columbia re-ceded to
her some years since by the Federal govern
meut, and pronounce th. cession made to Vir
ginia as unwise and dangerous
He ( Lincoln ) complains that tSe receipts of tls
Land and Patent offices have greatly declined
inconsequence ot" the rebellion, aud that tbe de
mands on the Pension office have largely in
creased. Numerous applicatians baed upon
theciisualtie of the existing war have alreutv
been made.
The relations of the Federal government w ith
the Indian tribes have beeu disturbed hv the
insurrection, especially in the northern supcrin
tendency and in New Mexico. The Indian
ceuntry south of Kansas is in possession of tlie
insurgents. The new agents of the I'nited
State have been unable to reach their posts,
while the old agents have espoused the insur
rectionary cause. Information has been received
that Indians liave been organized there as a
military force, and attached to the army of the
insurgent, but believes tliat Use presence of a
Federal army will cause them to relinquish their
hostile demonstration?.
An agricultural and statistical bureau should
be organized by Congress.
The country is congratulated upon the exe
cution of the laws for the suppression of the
African slave trade.
The territories of Colorado, Iacouh, and
Nevada are organized. Complaints are male
that the leaven of treason exists iu them.
The message recommends to Congress the
fai orable i-onsideration of the interests of the
District of Columbia, and expresses regret that
the rebellion ha caused much suffering aud sac
rifice arnoug it inhabitants.
A plan for the confiscation of slaves is recom
mended It proposes that Cofljfieos should ac
cept slave from the States according to some
mode of valuation in lieu of direct taxes : that
such slaves, on such acceptance by the general
government, be at once set free and colouized in
a climate congenial to them ; that free blacks be
colonized with thera in some territory, hereafter
to be purchased for them, ami that Congress
take immediate steps to make tbe necessary ap
propriations for the purchase. 1 he question is
here asked in this whole proposition, if it is not
an absolute necessitv. without which the Fedtnl
government cannot be peqM-tuated.
Regarding the policy which ought to
adopted lot suppressing the inurrectiou, luniety
is expressed that the inevitable CAUitlict for this
pnrpe shall not degenerate into a violent aud
remorseless revolutionary struggle, and he (Lin
coin) think it proper to keep the integrity of
the I uion prominent as the primary object of
the contest, on his part, leaving aU questions
which are not of vital military importance to
Congress
He claims not to have tianceuded tlte act of
Congress to confiscate property used for insur
rectionary purposes, but proposes to consider the
propriety of any new law on the smne eubject.
The I 'nion must be preserved, and hence all m
dispensable means must be employed, but ought
not to determine hostilities ; that radical and ex
frrrr,e measures . which inav reach the loyal as
well as the disloyal, are indispensable.
He indorses and reiterates bis inaugural ad
dress and message to Congress, at tlie last sje
cial session. He says tlie lan ray of hope for
preserving the I'nion peaceably, expired at the
assault on Fort Sumter.
He reviews the past, and says the I uion pro
peel in Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware ard
Missouri, has considerably brightened of late,
aud estimate that not more thau a third of the
inhabitants of those States are among the insur
He says tlie I'nion people of Western Vir
ginia are masters of their own country, and
claim some advantages on the Eastern shore ;
also, that the government troops have obtained
a footing at Hatteras. North Carolina; Port
Royal. Tybec aud Ship Island ; and has heard
of popular movements in behalf ot the l.iuon
in North Carolina and Tennessee, and therefore
base an argument that the cause of the I uion
is advancing steadily southward.
General Scott is highly complimented, and a
great bosst is made of McCtellan.
The message coucl lUes as follows:

bat there i on- point With its connections not
sy hackneyed a most other, to which
I ask a brief att.-utiou It is the effort to place
capital ou au equal fooling, if uot above labor.
in tlie structure of the govemmnt.
It is assumed that labor is available uly in
connection with capital; that nobody labo.s
uuless somebody else owning capital, somehow ,
by use of it. induce him to labor
Tin assumed, it is next com-ider-d whether
it is best that capital shall hire laborers and in
duce tli' in to ivork by their own consent, or bu
them, and drive theni to it without their couscnt.
Having proceeded so far, it is uaturally con
cluded that all laborers are either hiied laborers,
or what we call slaves. And further, it is as
sumed that whoever U once a hired laborer is
fixed in that condition fol life. Now there is no
such relation between capital and labor as us
umed, nor is there any such thiug as a freeman
being fixed in the condition of a hired laborer
Both ot these assumptions are false and all in
ferences from them are groundless. Labor is
prior to aud iudepeudeut of capital. Capital is
only the fruit of labor and could never have ex
isted if labor had not first existed. Ijibor is
the superior of capital and deserves much the
higher consideration. Capital has its rights,
which are as worthy of protection as any other
rights, nor is it denied tliat there is and probably
always will be a relation between labor and cup
ital, producing mutual benefits.
The error is in assuming that the whole labor
of the community exists within that relation.
A tew men have capital, and those few avoid
labor, and with their capital hire or buy a few
to labor for them. A largo majority belong to
neither cjaas neither work for other nor have
others to w ork for them.
Iu most of the Southern States a majority of
the whole people of all colors are neither slav.ss
nor musters, w hile in the Northern States a Ivy
majority are neither hirer nor hired. Men w ith
their famines, wives, sons and daughters work
lor themselves on their farms, iu their bouses
and in their shops, taking tlte whole product to
themselvt and asking no favors, ot capital on
the one hand nor of hired laborers of slaves on
the other.
It is not forgotten that a considerable number
of persons find their own labor with capital that
is their labor with their own hands aud also
buy or hire others to labor for them. But this
is only a mixed, and not a distinct class. No
principle stated is disturbed by the existence of
this mixed class. Again, as has already bJj
said, there is not of necessity any such thing :is
the free hired laborer being fixed for that condi
tion for life. Many independent men every
where iu these States, a few years back in their
lives, were hired laborers. Tlie prudent, penni
less beggar iu the world labors for w ages awhile,
aud saves a surplus w ith w hich to buy tools or
land for himself. He then labors on his own
account, and at length hires another new be
ginner to help him.
This is the just, generous and prosperous sys
tem which opens the way to all, gives hope to
all, and conseiUeut energy, progress and im
provement, in the condition of all. No men liv ing
are more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up or ou from poverty ; none less in
clined to take or touch ought which they have
not hones ly earned.
Lei them U-ware of surrendering a political
power which tbey already possess, aud which if
surrendered will surely be used to close the door
of advaueenx nt agalust sucii as thetii. and fix
tie-.v disabilities and burdeus upon them till all

The evidence iu relation to the affair at Bel

we think clear :
I. That the movement upon the enemy wa
ordered by (jen. Fremont tbr a specific purpose
its necessity b-ing hy uo menus established.
II. That the commander of Cairo had no dis
cretion in the premises, except as to the time and
manner of his attack.
III. That the attack was well planned and
brilliantly executed, our troops displaying a
degree cf bravery that entitles them to the
bighestpraise.
IV. Tnat, after the victory was achieved, the
ardor of the victors caused them to temporarily
leave their ranks for tho purpo.o of destroying
the enemy's camp.
V. That when thus in disorder they were as
sailed by the enemy, then strongly reinforced,
but gallantly succeeded iu cutting their way
through to their b,,ats, bringing off their trophies
from tbe field, though relnctautly leaving many
of the wouuded and dead
VI. That the affair, of no consequence in its
effects upon the progress of the w-sr, was a vic
tory for our arms, ami as such must be recorded.
All this is established: and if the war has uo
worse things in store for the honor of our troops

Ev.mt.vtion OF Tybkj:. Our citizens were ta
ken by suipri.se, Ntttudav aft 'moon, bv a report

and were taking their departure from Tybee.

report The particulars, as we leru them f,om
an authentic source, i(re m fellows:
Early Saturday morning a movement was dis
eovried among the Federals oi the island. Soon
the boat-, commenced pushing ,,nt from tbe shore
for the fleet, and up b nightfall some tweuty
four boats, containing from forty to fifty men
each, had left the islaud. The emliarkatiou con
tinued through Saturday night. Oue ship load
had left Saturday morning for th. South, and
one yesterday bearing northward.
We are left to con! -dure the causa of this sud
den departure. It may y timt ffcy feared au
attack nud were unwi'ung to meet as in the tug
of war, w .ili gleaming ste,-l nud face to face.
Another conjecture is, that, finding an attack on
the maiuiaud via the frowning walis of Fort Pu
laski, j nth. r an impracticable affair, they vou-
cluded to concentrate their force nt a more as
sailable point. Still another is that the forces
were originally thrown on the island for the pur
pose of erecting th necessary defenses to con
trol the entrance to the harbor, and having fin
ished the work, were taken back to the rendez
vous on Hilton Head, or to construct lortifica
tions at some other point.
The indications of Tybee yesterday, as ole
served from the fort, seemed to warrant the be
lief that a garrison has beeu left behind, sufii
cient, in tlieir opinion, to hold the island against
any force likely to be sent against them.
Saturday afteruoou. a large ship, equal in size
to the New York and Savannah steamers, was
seen to enter u inlet io the south, supposed to
be the Warsaw, and rati up several miles. Sup
posing her intentions to be to intercept our in
land navigation, which has been considerable iu
the last day or two. Commodore Tatnall went
down with his rlet yesterday to run her off or
give battle. She. however, ,l appeared before
his arrival, and the fleet retur to the city last
night.
Six Federal vessels were off Tybee yesterday
afternoon.
Tho Charleston Mercurg, of the same date
says :
Thesleamer Gen. Cliucli, Capt. lexter, ani-, .d
here on Saturday night from Jehossee island
and neighborhood. The Liucoinites had uot
got beyond Fenwick's Island, and no event of
importance had transpired for several day s in
tha' vicinity
The planters on Hutchinson's and Fenwick's
Isiandi have all burned their crops aud removed
their negroes. These places are lisated in St.
Helena Sound, near the Ashcpoo river, and are
easily approached by th enemy's gunboats.
Latf.r. A private letter, dated tbe .'.th tilt .
has been received from Hutchinson
stating that on that day one of the
Island, !
etiemv s
steamers had approached and landed a force of
two hundred men, who broke into the overseer's
house ami plundered and carried off everything
ngM anont tnc premises l liey thfn pro
ceeded to the residence of ibe. proprietor, the
door of which they forced open, and demanded
from the servants the key of the wine cellar.
Tlie wines, however, bad previously been re
moved. The marauders, after committing some
further petty depredation, skulked off to their
beats, fearing, probably, a surprise.
Immediately upon their departure. th torch
was applied to the biiildihg containing the
crops, ami soon little was left upon the rich
plantation except heaps of sniokiug ashes.

a formidable force. The night came on bringing
with it a teinjiest of wind aud raiu. it was very

all the tents on Ivath sides of the rivers were

-Confederate" as a band of outlaws', it has ot lata
been constrained to Sake very unusual and ex
tensive measures in urder to propitiate abroad a
feeling of respect for its Conduct and priuc.ples,
which it has discovered to be lacking in itnaje

great state of trepidation iu regard to the pro-
gross of the Contederate cause in tbe opinion of
me wornl. it resorts to measure ot extreme
illegal violence to prevent ( 'onfed-rafe ministers
from reaching Europe, for the purpose ol pre

should be heard for herselt, and at tlie same time
multiplies its own agents in a manner to indi
cate that it has already iMBi spontaneous exhi
bition of judgment, which extraordinary meas
ures are required to combat. While it forcibly
suppresses the missions uf SluU il and Mason to
Europe, it strengthen its own corps of ministers
by sending out etni-6fJJcfal missions to cooper
ate with the regular legations, and operate upon
opinion by extra orficial exertion. The north

Ifuarantee will prevent the repetition of similar
uiisuoeas.
Disorder and excess have reai-bed their hight
in the nn orttinate country of Me xTco treaties

subject having been exposed to MM attacks
and continual .langers, it became indispensable
at leugfh to make an exampl' of salutary rigoi .
no mis oojeci my "ovrruuieut had uia-le
tb necessary preparations, wheu two great ua
tion found that tUoy had io complain of wts of
violence ou the part of the Mexican authorities.
Our wrongs were cominou ; our action should be
joint. My government desired as much. Proper
st ps tor this purpose were at tirst favorable ;
but the result did not correspond with the desires
of the other two natiuns.
Subsetiuently France, England and Snain ar-
rauged together to obtain tliat satisfaction which
waa due to them, and to prevent the repetition
of offenses, which scandalized the world and
outraged humanity. Thus the desireo will be
acoiiiulistie.l. the execution u wlncii has been
the cuustant oiiject ot my government. At the
prober time an account will be rendered to von
of tbe convention which, with this object, bas
been signed by the representative of the three
powers.

us to coutemplate, its sutl -nugs without emotiou,
to disown iu appeal, inspired by great recollec
tion aad by au mexlinguisliable fove fur Spain.
Convinced that this appeal, that these wishes,
were fpoutatn.-ouj aud uuauiuious, I did uot hes
