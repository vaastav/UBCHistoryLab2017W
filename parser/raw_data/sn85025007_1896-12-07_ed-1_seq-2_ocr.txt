In ki.-. account of the call Mr. H<*ol2
made upon the President last Saturday
evening, the correspondent of a New
York newspaper =ays the President,
shaking the band o: the man whc~?
corruption fund bought the Presidency,
is reported to have said : "I wan; U
congratulate- you upon the great victo?
ry you have won.'" To which Mr
Hanna replied : "Tcank you Mr. Presi?
dent, but I want to acknowledge th<
debt of gratitude Major McKinley anc
?we all owe for the magnificent wori
done by =o many democrats like jour
fie':." *
A Washington newspaper, in its ac
count of the same call, =ay= : "Meceri
Hanna and Payne, General Porter
Chairman Babcock and .Senator Proc
ter walked slowly over to the Whi:<
House, and were escorted direct U
President Cleveland's private office, a;
if they had an appointment with him
Almost immediately there were sound;
of merriment as i: somebody was mak
ing fan over the situation.'' And yel
the democrats nominated Mr. Cleve
land three time3 for. and twice electee
him, to the Presidency.
the "fbee vote and fair count'
ahriekerfi in Virginia having nothing
else tpon which to base their charge
of fraudulent counting at the late elec

the democratic election judges are re

there were negroes who, though utterh

A MAN in Richmond, where crank
isms of all sorts now abound, who is re
ported in the newspapers a.-, engaged it
an effort to raise a military force to as
Bist the negroes and scalawag inaorrec
tionists in Cuba, has received a lette
from another one in .Vew Jersey, "ten
dering him the services of one hundret
Northern veterans of the late war." A
the war closed thirty-two years ago
and as few of the soldiers in it wen
less than twenty years old. the^
are fifty-six, if they went ir
during the first year, so the hundred re?
ferred to must now be pretty well crip
pled with rheumatism or other ill3 thai
flesh is heir to, and could ill afford U
stand a campaign against the younj,
Spaniards in Cuba, especially during t
wet season.
These ark no people less disposed
to follow the wise advice of their own
countryman, Davy Crockett?to dc
sure you are right before you go ahead
?than those of the L'nited States. Citi?
zen? of other foreign countries have at
much, if not more property in Cuba
than those of this one, and the consul.
of those countries are as much interest?
ed in securing the protection of that
property and its owners as those of this
have in protecting American life
and property there. But not only tho3fc
consuls, but their governments, being
well informed of the actual condition
of Cuban ailairs, give Spain their moral
support in the effort she is making to
suppress the insurrection of her negro
anil scalawag BUbjects in Cuba.
Some Northern people mix with
their abuse of their Southern enforced
fellow citizens, for supporting the regu?
larly and fairly nominated democratic
ticket, at the late election, side slaps at
them for expressing a wish that their
children may learn the true history ol
their country, and not be taught by
Northern books that their fathers, whe
acted in accordance with the Constitu
tion and even with the text books usid
at West Point until after the breaking
out of the war between the States,
were t raitors ami rebels. Their abuse
is not objectionable to those at whom
it is cast, and true histories of the
country will be used iu Southern
schools all the same.
The second session of the Fifty
fourth Congress commenced to-day. It
will end ou the 4th of March. It is
risking nothing to say that the country
will derive uo benefit from it, and, in?
deed, if all the regular appropriation
bills be passed, it will bo &>> much as in
expected. With a monthly deficit of
eight million and Mr. Keed ae
Speaker of the Hou.se, the chance
of any other than the regular
appropriation bills being parsed
iB poor indeed, and no body ia silly
enough to suppose that any thing will
be done with either the tarill or cur?
rency questions._
SOME PEOPLE imagine they see the
dawn of the prosperity that was to oc?
cur from the election of Mr. McKinley
in tho ability of certain cities to float
four and five per cent, bonds. They
never labored ur.der a vainer ce'.nsioz. '
In 315try 1= so depressed and business I
so slack that the few people who have :
j money can find no profitable mves:-:
men: for it, and have so little confi- ?
dence in the promised revival that |
they are afraid to lend i: except upon j
gilt edzed security, which few can offer.
? City bonds are about the safes: now is?
sue.!, and people with money would ln
veet it them at even two or three per
cent.. rather than iet it iie idle.
GovsenoeBuluv of California, at the
reo :esl of the President, has reprieved
the murderer of four men, for whose
mother Mr. Cleveland had ??formed a
Kroog s'.ucbi?rL'." before he became
President, though his crime was that of
a mo:.-ter rather than a man. as he tried
to kill a whole train load of people.
D jLe of whom had ever seen him, let
a.>-c io-e him any injury. In view of
this reprieve and of the io?uence that
obtained it. is it at all wonderful that so
many people have lost faith in free in
agitations ?_
In his message to Congress to-day
the :J.-^:^en: takes the unwise ground
that trusts aDd combinations must be
suppressed by States, not by the feder?
al government. If all the States would
agree, such a plan could succeed, but
Virginia had a woeful experience with
separate .State action when she attempt?
ed tc^retaiiate upon England before the
formation o: th~ Union. Some States
would only wait for others to drive
trusts out of their territory, in order to
invite them into theirs.
Waem woolen clothing is pretty
cheap now, and is necessary, net only
for comfort, but for health. It is not
unnatural for the manufacturers of such
clothing to want the tariff on it raised,
as that would increase their profits, but
why Congressmen, who are elected
by the votes of the people who
have to buy that clothing, should want
any such thing, unless to redeem a
promise to the manufacturers for bene
received, is hard to tell.
Thk negro republican candidate for
mayor of Richmond two years ago is
now on trial for swindling one of his
own race, and is in danger of the peni?
tentiary. If he shall escape, he should
apply for an office under Mr. McKinley,
in whose service he was engaged dur?
ing the late political campaign. His
character i.-. certainly as good as that
of the man of his race who has just
! b:en elected a member of the Govern
i or's council of Massachusetts.
Thk President in his message to Con?
gress to-day takes the wise ground that
unless the condition in Cuba shall be
entirely changed, this government
should let Spain paddle her own canoe.

PRESIDENTS .MESSAGE.
Presiden: Cleveland sent his annual
message to Congress to-day. The fol
lowing is a synopsis:
A political contest, involving momen?
tous consequences, fraught with feverish
. apprehension and creating aggressive?
ness so intense as to approach bitter
( ness and passion, has been waged
; throughout our land and determined
' by the decree of free and independent
suffrage without disturbance of our
tranquility er the leas: sign of weakness
't in our national structure. We discover
! abundant evidence of a determination
on the part of our countrymen to abide
I by every verdict of the popular will.
Our people exhibit a patriotic dispe?
rsion wbich entities them to demand
j of those who undertake to make and
! execute their law= such faithful and
unselfish service in th .: behalf as can
only be prompted by a serious appre?
ciation of the trust and confidence
which the acceptance of pubiic duty
invites.
We have made cuims agains: the
Turkish government for the piilaceand
destruction of missionary property at
Harpon and Marash during uprisings
at those places. Thus far the validity
of these demands has no: been admit
ted. though our minister, prior to such
outrages and in anticipation of danger,
demanded protection for the per=on=
and property of our missionary citizens.
Tne facts as they now appear do not
permit us to doubt the justice of these
claims, and nothing will be omitted
to bring about their prompt settlement.
The insurrection in Cuba still con?
tinues with all its perplexities. It is
difficult to perceive that any progress
has thus far been made towards the
pacification of the island. If Spain still
holds Havana and the seaports and all
the considerable towns, the insurgents
still roam at will over at least two
thirds of the inland country. If the
determination of Spain to put down
the insurrection seems but to strength?
en with the lapse of time, there is much
reason to believe that the insurgents
have gained in point of numbers, and
character, and resources. Lf Spain has
not yet reestablished her authority,
neither have the insurgents yet made
good their title to be regarded as an
independent State. Indeed, as the
contest has gone on, the pretense that
' civil government exists on the island,
except so far a> Spain is able to main?
tain it, has been practically abandoned.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in
pitched batilw, prompt and decisive re?
sults might be looked for. But they
are called upon to face a foe that shuns
?i general engagements, that can choose
and does choose its own ground, and
that fights only from ambuscade and
when all the advantages of position
and numbers are on its side. Excesses
[ on both sides become more frequent
and more deplorable. They are also
participated in by bands of marauders,
who, now in the name of one party and
now in the name of the other, as may
best suit the occasion, harry the coun
'?? try at will and plunder its wretched in
; habitants for their own advantage. Be
: sides its large pecuniary stake in the
fortunes of Cuba, the United States
finds itself inextricably involved in
the present contest in other ways both
: vexatious and costly. Many Cubans
reside in this country and indirectly
promote the insurrection through the
press, by public meetings, by the pur?
chase and shipment of arms, by the
raising of funds, and by other means,
which the spirit of our institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit to be
made the subject of criminal prosecu?
tions. Some of them, though Cubans
at heart and in all their feelings and
interests, have taken out papers as nat?
uralized citizens of the United States, a
proceeding resorted to with a view to
posible protection by this government.
The result is that this government i3
constantly called upon to protect
American citizens, to claim damages
for injuries to persona and property,
now estimated at many millions of dol?
lars, and to ask explanations and
apologies for the acts of Spanish of?
ficials.
These inevitable entanglements of
the United States with the rebellion in
Cuba, the large American property in?
terests affected, and considerations of
philanthropy and humanity in general,
have led to a vehement demand in va?
rious quarters for some sort of po.-itive
intervention on the part of the United
Slates. It was at first proposed that
belligerent rights should be accorded
to the insurgents. It has since been
and is now sometimes contended that
the independence of the insurgents
should be recognized. But imperfect
and restricted as the Spanish govern?
ment of the island may be, no other
exists there. It is now also suggested
that the United States should buy the
island?a suggestion possibly worthy of
consideration if there were any evidence
of a desire or willingness on the part of
Spain to entertain such a proposal. It
is urged finally, that, all other methods
failing, the existing internecine strife in
Cuba Bhould be terminated by our inter?
vention, even at the cost of a war be?
tween the United States and Spain?a
war which its advocates confidently
prophesy could be neither large in its
protions nor doubtful in its issue. The
United States has nevertheless a char?
acter to maintain as a nation, which
plainly dictates that right and not
might should be the rule of its conduct.
This government ha.s hoped to discover
the most promising and effective means
of composing the present strife, with
honor and advantage to Spain and
with the achievement of all the reason?
able objects of the insurrection. It
would seem that if Spain should offer
to Cuba genuine autonomy?a measure
of home rule which, while preserving
the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy
all rational requirements of her Span?
ish subjects?there should be no just
reason why the pacification of the isl?
and might not be effected on that basis.
Such a result would at once stop the
conflict which is now consuming the
resources of the island. It would keep
intact the possessions of Spain without .
touching her honor. It would put the i
prosperity of the island and the for- i
tunes of its inhabitants within their own
control, without severing the natural ]
and ancient ties which bind them to ;
the mother country. Being sincerely ,
desirous in the interest of both as well ,
as on its own account that the Cuban i
problem should be solved with the least '
possible delay, it was intimated by this '
government to the government of
Spain some months ago that, if a satis- ,
factory measure of home rule were ten- ,
dered the Cuban insurgents, and would (
be accepted by them upon a guaranty t
of its execution, the United States <
would endeavor to find a way not ob- ?
jectionable to furnishing such guaranty, j
While no definite response to this inti- t
mation has yet been received from the ?
Spanish government, it is believed to be r
not altogether unwelcome, while, aa t
already suggested, no reason is per?
ceived why ic snouid not be approved
by the insurgents. Ic is therefore fer?
vently hoped on all grounds that earnest
efforts for healing the breach between
Spain and the insurgent Cubans, upon
tho lines above indicated, may beat
once inaugurated and pushed to an im?
mediate and successful issue.
Whatever circumstances may arise,
our policy and our interests would con?
strain us to object to the acquisition o:
the island or an interference with in
control by any other power. It should
oe added that while we are anxious to
accord all due respect to the sovereignty
of SDain, we cannot view the pending
conrlict in all its features, and proper?
ly apprehend our ioevitaoly close rela?
tions to it, and its possible results, with?
out considering that by the course ol
events we may be drawn into such an
unusual and unprecedented condition,
as will fix a limit to our patient waitina
tor Spain to end the contest.
When the inability of Spain to deal
successfully with the insurrection has
: oecome manifest and when a hopeless
struggle has degenerated into a strife
i which means nothing more than the
useless sacrifice of human life, a situa
tion will be presented in which cur ob'
lig&tions to the sovereignty of Spain
will be superseded by higher obliga?
tions, which we can hardly hesitate to
recognize and discharge, deferring
the choice of ways and methods until
the time for action arrives. Until wt
face the contingencies suggested, or the
situation is by other incidents impera?
tively changed, we should continue in
the line of conduct heretofore pursued,
j The Venezuelan boundary question
has ceased to be a matter of difference
i between Great Bratain and the United
States, their respective government
having agreed upon the substantial pro
visions of a treaty between Greai
Britain and Venezuela submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The
i provisions of the treaty are so eminent'
ly just and fair that the assent of Vene
zuela thereto may confidently be an'
ticipated.
Negotiations for a treaty of genera!
arbitration for all diligences between
Great Britain and the United States are
far advanced and promise to reach s
successful consummation at an earh

The scheme of examining applicants
for certain consular positions to test
their competency and fitness, adopted
under an executive order issued oo the

of examination promotions and trans?
fers of deserving incumbents have been
quite extensively made with excellent
results.
I desire to repeat the recommenda?
tion contained in my last annual mes?
sage in favor of providing at public ex?
pense official residences for our ambas?
sadors and ministers at foreign capitals,
Following the discussion of foreign
allairs the President reviews the reports
of the various Cabinet officers and the
workings of the departments of which
they are the head?.
Regarding the revenue the Presi?
dent says: I believe our pre?
sent tariff law, if allowed a fair oppor?
tunity, will in the near future yield a
revenue which, with reasonably eco?
nomical expenditures, will overcome
all deficiencies. In the meantime no
deficit that has occured or may occur
need excite or disturb us. To meet any
such deficit we have in the Treasury, in
addition to a gold reserve of one hun?
dred millions, a surplus of more than one
hundred and twenty-eight millions of dollars
applicable to the payment of the expenses of
the government, and which must, unless ex?
pended for that purpose, remain a useless
hoard, or, if mot extravagantly wasted, must
in any event be perverted from the purpose
of its exaction from our people. The payment,
therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue
from this fund is nothing more than its prop?
er and legitimate use. It is not one of the
functions of qmt government to accumulate
and make additions to a fund no: needed for
immediate expenditure. It is immeasurably
better to appropriate our surplus to the psy
ment of justifiable expenses than to a'ic-w i:
to become an invitation to reckless appro?
priations and extravagant expenditures.
Because we may be enjoys? a tem.r-.riry
relief from the depressing iadaeace of mone?
tary distress, we should not be lulled into a
false security nor lead to forge: the Sudden?
ness of past visitations. I am more convinced
than ever that we can have no assured rir.?z
cial peace and safety until the government
currency obligations upon which gold may be
demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn
from circulation and canceled. This m.gh:
be done, as has been heretofore recommenced,
by their exchange for long-term bonds bearing
a low rate of interest or by their redemption
with tiie proceeds of such bonds. Even if
only the United States notes known as green?
backs were tens retired, it is probable that
tho Treasury notes issued in payment of
.silver purchases under the act of July 14.
1-!j<), now paid in gold when demanded,
would not create much disturbance, as they
might, from time to time, when received in
the Treasury by redemption in gold or
otherwise, be gradually and prudently re?
placed by silver coin. This plaa of issuing
bonds for the purpose of redompiioa certainly
appears to be the most effective and direct
path to the needed reform. In default of
this, however, it would be a step in
tho right direction if curr-ncy oMiga
tions redeemable in gold, whenever so
redeemed, should be canceled iu?tead of >>eing
reissued This operation would bs a slow
remedy, but ic would improve present condi?
tions. National banks should redeem their
own notes. They should be allowed to isaue
circulation to the par value of bonds deposit?
ed as security for its redemption, and tho tax
on their circulation should be reduced to one
fourth of 1 Der cent. In considering pro?
jects for the retirement of United .States notes
rind Treasury notes issued under tho Jaw of
1890, I am of the opinion that we have p ac
ed too much stress 'upon the danger of con?
tracting the currency, and have calculated
too little upon the gold trat would be added
to our circulation if invited to us by better
and ssfer financial methods. It is not so
much a contraction of our currency that
should 1)0 avoided as its unequal distribution.
This might be obviate!, and any :ear of
harmful contraction at the same time remov?
ed, by allowing the organization of smaller
banks and in less populous communities than
are now permitted, and also authorizing ex?
isting banks to o-.tablish branches in small
communities ender proper restrictions.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn upon us until
uur government abandons the banking busi?
ness and tho accumulation of funds, and con?
fines its monetery operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by the people for its
iupport, and to the expenditure of such mon

KO' Kefellee vs. Cakxegis.?John
D. Rockefeller is seeking to outdo An?
drew Carnegie as an iron king, and has
plans already matured and about to be
carried out aiming at that end. The
Standard Oil Company, directed by
Rockefeller, will be the foe of the
Scotchman. This company has pur
cnased in South Chicago, along the
shores of Lake Michigan and at the
mouth of the Calumet river, a plot of
ground several acres in extent, and with
a water frontage of 3,_00feet. On this,
it is said, rolling mills will be erected,
to cost $10,000,000?possibly twice that
amount.
With this plant for manufacture, with
the vast mines in the Mesaba region for
the raw product, and with eighteen
huge lake vessels to carry the ore to
the very doors of the works?all owned
by the Rockefeller Company?that cor
poration may be able to dictate terms to
Mr. Carnegie and his associates, instead
of being dictated to.
