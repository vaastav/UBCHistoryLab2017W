The Defence of Fort Moultric.
The Nations! Democrat eny that "thcie
are troop enough at Fort Moultrie Uic
' commandant neither taking nor a-unting any
more."
Vrnj how man; does the Democrat consid
er "enough" to guard a fort in an eneraj'
country ? Accordiu; to the luut accurate
account, Col. Anderson lias only ixty or
evenly men, and ia poorly supplied with
munition ot war. The C. S. Arsenal at
Charleston U in tbe possession of the eces
sionisM, and a gentleman direct from Charlt-
ton reports at Wishingt-oa that Col. Andersen
iu refused the privilege of Hindioj to tbe
arsenal for luppliea, and hi officers weie
seut back without them, because percussion
cap were sect for, and a guard was subse
quently placed about the arsenal. Docs this
look as if the commandant would neither atk
fuf, nor need any more?
Agata we are informed by telegraph that
on reception at Charleston of a report that
steamer with 600 soldiers for the defence of
Fort Moultrie was on iu way from New York,
tbe citizens rushed in arms to the docks, de
termined to preveut their lauding. We sup
pose this is another proof tuat "there are
troops enough at Fort Moultrie." It ia re
ported further that the rumor is prevalent
that Buchanan has actually advised Col. An
derson to vacate the Fort, and thus ignomin-
iously abandon the post to the rebellious
secessionists, but this report we are loth to
believe.
It is perfectly apparent to the Democrat,
and to every one else, that Fort Moultrie is
not sufficiently guarded, and that the Presi
dent is inviting the danger which haugs over
it. Were the fort in any other locality be
side the South; were it ir. UtH.li, Kansas, or
Central America, the w no e Democratic
press would strenuously urge a garrison of
five hundred men lor its protection, bur, be
ing in the way of Southern revolution, they
are eager to have it fall.
England and America.
The Democratic-Disunion press have en
deavored to impress their reader with the
belief that England and the European pow
ers were rejoicing at the prospect of the dis
solution of the Union, and that England
would hail with pleasure the establishment of
Southern Cotton Confederacy, with which
f he would hasten to form an alliance, offen
sive and defensive, the ground work of her
upport lying in her commercial interests.
The National Democrat of Nov. 21st, assert
ed that "for years England has labored, in
directly, but not tbe less surely, to bring
about the state of affairs now culminating
not because ot any real dislike she has to our
form of Government, but because the United
States is her great rival in commercial su
premacy, and with the cIon ot the world in
ber hands, must beat her iu manufactories.
The monopoly of the cotton secured to ber,
and willingly would she see the slave-trade
re-cpened willingly would she wage a war
in its defense for with that, England would
etand confessed the first of commercial as she
would be the first of manufacturing nations."
The barometer to a nation's sentiment and
interests is her publicpress,un!ess,a3 is not the
case In Eagland--that press is trammeled by
slavish lubserviency to cliques and powers.
Let as see how the English press speaks up
on I he political troubles in tbe United States,
and how it bears the insult so often repeated,
that England would eit aside all her hos
tility to slavery, if by so doing, she could put
money in her treasury 1 and power in her
hands. The London Times of Nov. 21st (the
very same day rpon which the National
Democrat published the above assertion,) af
ter saying that "a man may have opinions
adverse to Slavery, and a man may reside in
a slave State, but he cannot do both these
things at once ;" adds,
"We are glad to think that tbe march of
slavery, and the domineering tone which it
advocates were beginning to assume over
Freedom, have been at length arrested and
silenced. We rejoice that a vast community
of onr own race has at length given an au
thoritative expression to sentiment which
are entertained by every one in this country.
We trust to see the American Government
employed in task more worthy of a State
founded on the doctrines ofliberty and equal
ity than the invention of shifut and devices
to perpetuate servitude; and we hear in this
great protest of American freedom the tardy
echo of those humane doctrines to which

Not a word of exultation or of the prospec
tive advantages which England will reap, but
tbe same characteristic tone of opposition to
human slavery which has ever been tbe Eng
lishman' boast.
The London Herald of Nov. 20th says :
"May be wtvill thortly have to look to oth
er tourcet for our cotton and other Souther
product, and it is to be hoped Her Majesty's
government, ia view of the precarious condi
tion of American affairs, will devote its im
mediate attention to our much neglected West
Indian and other colonies, so as to enable our
planters to supply the deficiency.
The London News, of Nov. 22d, having re
viewed the position of the country, "at the
momenta of it going over from a corrupt to
a regenerate republican system," says:
"One more evil may be impending the fail
ure of the cotton tuppiy. It need not be so if
the planters were wise ; but they are in this
matter, not wise. We can only bear in mind
that a tervile tear tooidd have been tvorte fur the
eo tUn crop than a fanciful political ogitation,
and meantime,for our oim rart, make kattt to
create olhir tourcet of supply.
We shall have th9 nation on our side in op
position to the siave trade, and iu our endeav
ors to make industrial aliies of the inhabitant
of Africa. Spain must then give way about
her Cuba slave trade. In. America, free l.-v-bor
will presently supersede the more extrav
agant method of production, and the antag
onism of race will be much softened.
The London Post, of Nov. 23d, soys:
"To all abearance, American intlitutient are
about to be tried by a teverer tett than hat ever
yet been applied to them, and tre need hardly
' tag thai a civil var between the. North and Soath
would, at the pretrnt time, prove highly mju

men of all politics will n3e their utmost ef

No Compromise.
A vsgua and startling Impression hag ta
ken firm hold ot a portion of the public mind
that soma sort of humiliating, disgraceful
compromise or flx-up ii about being elimina
ted by the politician of tMt hot-bed of cor
ruption" the' National Capita! to appease
the wrath of South Carolina and the South
generally.' Caa It be possible that there i
to betuch a collapse of ih great principle,
upon which this great battle has been so brave
ly fought and wen in the triumphant election
of Lincoln and Hamlin T We cannot be
believe that any politician from tbe Eait or
the Great West will do so, and thus knock a
hole in the noble Republican ship, sinking
the hopes of the million of American cili-
sens who have so long labored and grayed
for the glorious consummation, now for the
first time attained in the history of our gov-
eminent. Never befote in our political con
tst was an issue more definitely made up,
Tbe most experienced and skillful pleader in
our court of justice could not hare brought
out the point of difference upon which the
case wenttotheAnerican people, better than
did the Chicago Convention. Upon this issue,
thusjmade up, the question was discussed upon
every stump at the North and South, when
Lynch law did sot Intervene to prevent it.
Upon this plain issue the Press fought the
battle, ' It is not pretended (hat there has
been any misapprehension on the part of the
people. But it is said the South will not sub
mit to this long sought, long labored for.Jver
diet ot the honest heart and noble manhood
of a people determined to be free a people
willing however to wait as tbey cave done,
for the grand result to be brought about by
the legitimate Use of constitutional machine
ry. Now that this mult is all but reached,
here is the traitor that will dare try and
wrench from the freemen ot this nation, at
the demand and under the treasonable threats
of the oligarchy, tbe fliigof victory. It seems
impossible that -such a woe should come; but
we have not forgotten tbe compromise of 50,
nor the most recent and more daring and
desperate repeal of the Missouri compromise
una. and tbe still later attempt to torce sla
very into Kansas. 1 It may come, but woe to
tbe man or men by whom such a woe comes!
Let any member of Congress from Ohio favor
any compromise or hx-up and his , political
Undertaker will have his remains in charge
immediately. lie had better never been born.
A mill stone around the neck of such a trait
or would not hasten his fate. Burr whs no
more surely doomed than is that Ohio Repub
lican who dares to trifle with the solemn ver
dict of the people on this great matter ot Hu
man Rights. What Webster did to quiet and
appease the South in 1850, was indeed God
like, when compared with the treason new
contemplated; yet what he did in the way of
compromife cost him, not only uis political,
but national lite. Thank God, the people, and
not the politicians, have come to judgment,
and are about settling the boundaries of this
great question.,
Hellish Southern Outrage.
L ist evening's Plain Dealer contains a let
ter from a correspondent in Memphis, Tenn.,
ia which, in an unfeeling manner, he de
tailed the most savage act of cowardly cruel
ty ever committed by any community on the
lace of the earth, the barreling up ot a cit
izen of Ohio, and rolling bim into the Mis
sissippi I Can it be possible that such heath
enish worse than heathenish cruelty ia be
ing practiced in this professed Christian land?
But read the extracts which we publish
below. It will be borne in mind that this
account is written by a pro-slavery man to a
pro-slavery paper, consequently it cannot be
charged that the story is a Republican invention.
MEMPHIS, Nov. 6, 1860.
Daaa Gaxr : I buve been TOTS few aayi
n this city, and am much pleased with the
state of affairs. They have a Vigilance Com
mittee as a consequence of the (taction of Lin
coln, and this committee are vigilant in ma
king Northerners hie their homes, i An an
instance of the intensity of feeliug here,
against the Northern abolition emmissaries,
tbey took an Ohioan, a few davs since, at the
po nt just below tbe city, and being satisfied
that he was "one of 'em," after consultation,
they put him in a barrel, headed him up, and
rolled the barrel down the bluff into the Mis
sissippi river, and that was the last ot bim.
The Arkansas people oppo
site here have fired into several ot the Cin
cinnati steamers which have attempted to
land, and will not allow Ohio boat to land
at all
Last week a Cincinnati merchant took $15,-
OuO and went to New Oi leans to purchase su
gar and molasses, but could not purchase a
dollar's worth and was ordered to leave tbe
city in five hours. He secreted himself in
the bouse of a friend and got his friend
guardedly to do the purchasing and shipping
for him. He then left in the night by tbe
express train for the North.
AH along tbe river strangers are asked
where they are from, and if they say "North,"
they are ordered forthwith to leave.
The Cincinnati Commercial publishes an
account of tbe same tragedy, and gives a col
umn article in denunciation of the outrage.
If our people are being thus tortured and mur
dered by such a remorseless race of savages a
now exist in some localities of tbe South, it
is high time that steps be taken by the Gov
ernor and Legislature of Ohio to protect it
citizens. Tbe cruelties of the Southern mobs
equal those of the Roman Catholic Inquisition.
Another Veteran.
John Henington, living in Augusts town
hip, Carroll countj, Ohio, who will be 102
years old on the firtt day ot January next,
voted for Lincoln at the late election. In
1817 be settled on tbe farm which he still
own. He b s. always enjoyed good health
until recently. The effect of hi extreme
old age are now beginning to bear upn him.
Gov. Seward's Criticism.
Gov. Seward ha the credit of the most
pungent and concentrated criticism made on
the President' Message. He is reported to
have said that thePresident has established
two- things that a State may not, secede,
unless it wants to; and, in case of secession,
It would become the duty of the Executive
to enforce the laws if nobody objected. fm-j-
Outwitting the Enemy by a Flank Movement.
u
The Washington correspondent of the
Cincinnati Commercial say 'anew scheme il
talked of by which a flank movement will
astonish tbe Southern Confederacy. .'
A prominent Republican member astonish
ed Southern gentlemen by intimating that
when the South moves in the march of dis
solution, tbe Republicans, after Lincoln is
inaugurated, will acquire Mexico by treaty
and, flank the Southern confederacy by-' free
State. i
, 10 We would call attention to a commu
nication in another column, headed "No
Compromise." It was written and prepared
by two of our most prominent and leading
Republicans.

Insanity at New Orleans.
A gentleman of Chicago, direct from New
Orleans,- furnishes the Tribune with sou
sketches ol political feeling in that city, from
which w triike several extract:
THE FURY OF THE SOUTH.
Tbey are for Instant and unconditional dis
solution of the Union, at any price, and at
all huzard. They want no compromises, no
concession, no bargains, no ameudmenU of
the Constitution. They are for a Southern
Confederacy nothing leas. There is, he
tell us, a conservative class, but they are
borne along with the crowd, and dare not
yet lift a voice in remonstane against the
extreme measures upon which tbe populace
are bent; nor do they hope that anything
like reason will again rule the hour until
some fatal act is committed which will sei
rale the Cotton States from the Union, .
the into war.
NO SAFETY FOR NORTHERN MEN.
Of course, in the midst of excitement like
that which reigns in New Orleans, no North
ern man, unless uu fie to bis principles, or
uuder the protection of powerful friends, is
safe. To be suspected of Republicanism is
the signal tor a warning; to be convicted of
it, is to be driven off. The moveable police
torce istne mob under tbe name ot vigilant
commitiees, and these the better class of cit
izens are powerless to restrain. There is iu
tact throughout all the Cotton States an un
disguised Reign of Terror.
ST. CHARLES HOTEL.
The St. Charles Hotel is the center of the
excitement. That house is the common re
sort of the most violeut ot the fanatics, who
between tbeir cups and their cursings amuse
themselves with hunting up, insulting and
driving off Northern men because they are
Northern men. When our friend left tbe
city, the ruffians had made a clean sweep;
and that caravan sery was without a resident
of any of tbe free Sta es within its walls.
They had all been compelled to leave some
to quit the ' city and their business, others to
look np more decent quarters where violence
and ruffianism are not the rule.
ASSASSINATION PUND.
One evening, in tbe reading-room of that
establishment, the crowd was assembled as
usual, and as usual the Abolitionists were the
theme. Becoming excited, one man said to be
wealthy and influential, pulled out his pocket-book
and said, "Here axe $3,000 which I
will subscribe to a fund to procure the assas
sination of Lincoln and Hamlin. Who'll
swell the pile?" In ten minutes, or less,
more than $40,000 had been offered for this
infamous purpose, and the names of tbe sub
scribers were tuken down. The witness of
this transaction is far from believing that this
was mere gasconade.
NARROW ESCAPE FOR PROF. MITCHELL.
the escape of Professor Mitchell, the well
known Astronomer of Cincinnati. He was
on the cars going South, and when near Jack
son, Miss., a man somewhat inflamed with
liquor, but more with pro-slavery hate, en
tered into conversation with him on political
subjects. The Professor was cautious and
reserved ; but venturing to say that he
thought Mr. Lincoln was a conservative man
and would not do injustice to tbe South, his
pro-slavery friend was greatly incensed; and
when the train halted at Jackson, jumped to
the platform and shouted to the crowd about
the station, "there a a d ned abolitionist
on the train 1 Lynch him I Lynch him 1"
Instantly, at least fifty men jumped on and
commenced a search for the offensive speci
men of Northern opinion; but before the
Professor could be pointed out, the conductor,
seeing the danger, pulled bis bell cord and
tbe cars moved off, and with them the Pro
fessor with a whole skin.

Asylum Burned---One Life Lost.
our occur
rence of the greatest conflagration that ever
took place in this part of the State. ! The
Western Lunatic Asyum, the li-rgest and
most costly building in Kentucky, look fire
on Friday morning, at 11 o'clock, and in tbe
course of four hours was totally destroyed,
with the exception of the walls. Tr.e fire
was first een in the roof in the rear of tbe
anaa w mft, anjitma"n;tMgti-wliAl waj Ulcrwlng
from the northwest at the time, the dry shin
gles were soon In a Same that defied a 1 effort
of subjection. The vast halls created a dralt
like the blast of a furnace, and in a short
time the immense edifice, which we had
ught might stand as an everlasting mouu-
nient to it builders, was wrapped from tower
to foundation in one sheet of livid, crack
ling, and roaring flame, that swept along
with the fury of a tornado. .
Dr. Montgomery, tbe superintendent, lost
everything in bis great efforts to save his pa-
pnta. Tue assistant suffered in like manner,
-n reaching the yardsome fifty of the patients
fed panic-stricken to the woods. Parties are
n the woods searching for them and are fast
ringing them in. On repairing to the spot
it three o'clock, we found the road, extend
d some two mile from tbe Court ' House,
thronged with citizens visiting and retnrning
;rom the scene of the disaster. Tbe splendid
structure was tb pride of our people, and all
were shocked at its swift destruction.
The attendant succeeded in saving tbe pa
tients, gome two hundred and fifty, without
iniury, except one who fastened his cell, near
where the tire originated. The attendant;
after endangering his own life, had to leave
him.
The procession. of lunatics, marching into
town, presented a spectacle of melancholy
grotesqueness; as the poor creatures passed
on, the men on foot and the lemales in wag
ons and hacks, wrapped op in quilts, blank
its and comforts of every hue. . Some ot
them seemed passive and indifferent ; some
seemed unusually elated, whilst others wore
in their faces a vague impression that some
heavy misfortune had befallen them. Tbe
county and town authorities bave made tem
porary quarters for them in the Court House
and other buildings, which will be made as
comfortable a possible. We learn that the
patient burned up was Stewart, a carpenter.
Most of tbe wall are without a fissure, and
seem a good as ever; but th mistaken econ
omy of the State in not providing a metal
roof, has cost ber aany thousand of dollars.
Tbe building cost over $200,000. :
Another Pionisr Gok. --We are called
upon to-day to chronicle the death of Heze
kiah Stiles, an old and much esteemed citizen
of this county. He died at his residence, in
Columbia, not far from the spot of his birth.
His uncle, Majar Benjamin Stiles, it was who
induced Symmes to make tbe purchase be
tween the two Miamis, and the deoeased's
failier and ondes were among tbe first to
pettle, tnereon. For, thirty years Hezekiah
Stiles has occupied an important place in tbe
community, and bis death -will be felt and
beard with regret in many households. Cin.

advices of the 5th state that it is now ascer
