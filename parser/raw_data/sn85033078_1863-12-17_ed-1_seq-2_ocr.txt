I sliu.ll submit, lor the consideration of the
Senate, the adjustment of the possessory
claims in Washington Territory arising out of
the treaty of the loth of June, 1840, between
the United States and Great Britain, which
iiave been the sources of some disquiet among
the citizens of that now rapidly improving
part of our country.
A novel and important question, involving
the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of
Spain in the waters which surround the Is
land of Cuba, has been debuted without
reaching an agreement, and it is proposed,
in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbi
tration of a friendly power. A convention
for that purpose will be submitted to the
Senate.
1 have thought it proper to submit to the
approval of the Senate, to concur with the
interested commercial powers in an arrange
ment for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues,
upon the principles which have been hereto
fore adopted in regard to the imposts upon
navigation in the waters of Denmark.
The long pending controversy between this
Government and that of Chili, touching tiie
seizure at Salina, Peru, by Chilian officers, of
a large amount in treasure belonging to citi
zens of the United States, bus been brought
to a dose b\ the award of His Majesty, the
King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration
the question was referred by the parties.
The subject was thoroughly and patiently
examined by that jpstly respected monarch,
and, although the sum awarded to the claim
ants may not have been as large as they ex
pected, there is no reason to distrust the wis
dom of His Majesty’s decision. That decis
ion was promptly complied with by Chili,
when intelligence in regard to it reached that
country.
The Joint Commission, under the act of
the last session, for carrying into effect the
convention with Peru on the subject of
claims, has been organized at Lima, and is
engaged in the business entrusted to it.
Difficulties concerning the oceanic transit

CO.NCKR.MMi AI. IK NS.
Incidents occurring in the progress of our
civil war have forced upon my attention the
uncertain state of international questions
touching the rights of foreigners in tiiis coun
try and of United States citizens abroad. In
regard to some governments, these rights are
at least partially defined by treaties; in no
instance however, is it expressly stipulated
hat on the instance of civil war a foreigner
residing in this country, within the lines of
the insurgents is to be exempted from the
rule w hich classes him as a belligerent, in
whose behalf the government ot his country
cannot expect any privileges or immunities
distinct from that character.
1 regret to say, however, that such claims
have been put forward, ami in sonic instances
in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the
United Stales the greater part of their lives.
There is reason to believe that many persons,
born in foreign countries, who have declared
their intention to become citizens, or who
have been fully naturalized, have evaded the
militar} duty required of them, by denying
the fact, and thereby throwing upon tiie (•ov
ertime at the burden of proof. It has been
found difficult or impracticable to obtain this
proof, from the want of guides to the proper
sources of information. These might be sup
plied by requiring the Clerks of Courts, where
declaration of intention may be made, or nat
uralization ellected, to send periodically lists
of the names of persons naturalized or declar
ing their intention to become citizens, to the
(Secretary of the Interior, in whose depart
ment these names must bo arranged and prin
ted for general information.
There is also reason to believe that for
eigners frequently become citizens of the
United States lor the sole purpose of evading
the duties imposed by the laws of their sev
eral countries, to which, on becoming natu
ralized, they at once repair, ami though
never returning to the United States, they
still claim the interposition of the govern
ment as citizens. Many altercations and
great prejudices have heretofore arisen cut
of this abuse. It is therefore submitted to
your serious consideration. It might be ad
visable to tix a limit beyond which no citizen
of the United States, residing abroad, may
claim the interposition of the government.
The right of suffrage has often been as
sumed and exercised by aliens under the pre
tence of naturalization, which they have dis
avowed when drafted into the military ser
vice. 1 submit the expediency of such an
amendment of the laws as will make the fact
of voting an tvs tojtpel against any plea of ex
emption from military sei vice, or other civil
obligations, on the ground of alienage.
JAPAN.
In common with other Western powers,
our relations with Japan have been brought
into serious jeopardy through the perverse
opposition of the hereditary aristoeraev of
that empire to the enlightened and liberal
policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the
country into the society of nations. It is to
be hoped, although not with entire confidence,
that those difficulties may he peacefully over
come. I ask your attention to the claims of
the Minister residing there for the damage
he sustained in the destruction by fire of the
residence of the Legation at Yeddo.
INTERN AT ION AL TE LEG RA PH.
Satisfactory arrangements have be n made
with the Emperor of Russia, which it is be
lieved will result in effecting a continuous
line of telegraph through that Empire from
our Pacific coast. I recommend to your fa
vorable consideration the subject of an inter
national telegraph across the Atlantic ocean,
and also of a telegraph between this capital
and the national forts along the Atlantic sea
boards and the Gulf of Mexico. Such con
nections,established with any reasonable out
lay would be economical, as well as effective
aids to diplomatic treaties and the naval ser
vice.
OCR CONSULAR SYSTEM.
The consular system of the United States,
under the enactments of the last Congress
begins to be self-sustaining, and there is
reason to hope that it may become entirely
so, with the increase of trade which will ensue
whenever peace is restored. Our ministers
abroad have been faithful in defending Amer
ican rights, in protecting our commercial in
terests. Our consuls have necessarily had to
encounter increased labors and responsibil
ities growing out of the war. These they
have for the most part met and discharged
with zeal and efficiency. This just acknowl-
edgoment includes those consuls who, residing
in Morroeco, Kgypt, China, and other central
countries, art? changed with coniprehensive
and extraordinary powers,

FOUKUJ.N CLAIMS.
Injuries unfurseen by the government and
unintended may ia some cases have been in
dicted upon the subjects or citizens of for
eign countries, both at sea and on land, by
persons in the service of the United States.
As this government expects redress from
other powers when similar injuries are inflict
ed by persons in their service upon citizens
of the United States, we must prepare to do
justice to foreigners. If the existing judi
cial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose,
a special court may be authorized, with pow
er to decide such claims of the character re
ferred to as may have arisen under treaties
and public laws. Conventions for adjusting
claims by commissioners have been proposed
to some governments, but no definite answer
to the propositions has been received from
any. In the course of the session I shall
probably have occasion to request you to
provide indemnification to claimants where
decrees of restitution have been rendered
and awarded by the Admiralty Court, and in
Oliver cases whore this government may ac
knowledge itself to be liable in principle and
when the amount of that liability has been
ascertained by an informal arbitration.
The proper officers of the Treasury have
deemed themselves required, by the law of
the U. S. upon the subject, to demand a tux
on the incomes of the foreign consuls in this
country. While such a demand may not be
interdicted by public law or by an existing
treaty between the United States and a for
eign country, the expediency of so far modi
fying the act as to exempt from tax the in
comes of such consuls, who are not citizens
of the United States, derived from the emol
uments of their offices or property not situa
ted in the United States, is submitted toyonr
serious consideration. 1 make this sugges
tion upon the ground that a country which
ought to be reciprocated exempts our con
suls and all other countries’ from taxa
tion, to the extent indicated. The United
States ought not to be less liberal to other
nations.
PUBLIC FINANCES.
The operations of the Treasury during the
last year have been successfully conducted.
The enactment by Congress of a national
banking law has proved a valuable support
of the credit, and the general legislation in
relation to loans has fully answered the ex
pectation of its authors. Some amendments
may Vie required to perfect the operations of
the existing laws, but no change in their
principles or general scope is belived to be
neces.-ary. Since these measures have been
in operation all demands on the Treasury
touching the army and navy have been
promptly met and fully satisfied. So consid
erable a body of troops it is believed, were
never before so amply provided for or more
liberally and punctually paid. And it may be
added, that by no people were the burdens
incident to a great war, ever more cheerfully
borne.
The receipts during the year from all
sou ees, including loans and balance in the
treasury at its commencement were §901,-
125,671.86. The aggregate disbursements,
§895,796,630.65 ; leaving a balance on the
Tih ol July, 1863, of §5,329,044.21. Of the
receipts, there were derived from customs,
§66,039,142.40 ; from internal revenue, §37,-
610,787.95; from direct taxes, §1,485,703.61;
from lands, §167,617.17 ; from miscellaneous
sources, §3,846,615.35 ; and from loans,
§776,682,361.57 ; making the aggregate
§'.01,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there
were §232,539.22 for pensions, Ac.; §4,216,-
520.59 for interest on the public debt, and
§24,729,846.51 for ;
§599,298,600 for the war department; §63,-
211,105.27 for the navy department; for the
pay incut of the funded and temporary debt,
§181,086,635.07; making an aggregate of
§895,766,630.65, and leaving a balance of
§5,329,044.21 ; but the payment of the fund
ed and temporary debt having been made
from monies borrowed during the year, must
be regarded as merely a nominal payment,
and monies borrowed to make then as merely
nominal receipts and the actual amount, §lßl.-
086,635.07, should therefore be deducted
1 from the receipts and disbursements. That
being done, there remains as the actual re
ceipts, §714,709,995.58, leaving the balance
as already stated.
As the actual receipts and disbursements
for the remaining three-quarters of the cur
rent fiscal year of 1864, will be shown in de
tail by the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, to which I invite your attention, it
is sufficient to say here that it is not believed
that the actual results will exhibit a state of
the finances less favorable to the country
than the estimates of that officer heretofore
submitted, while it is confidently expected
that at the close of the year both the dis
bursements and debts will be found very con
siderably less than has been anticipated.
REPORT OF WXR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War is a
document of great interest. It consists of:
Ist. The military operations of the vear, as
detailed in the report of the General-m-
Chicf.
2d. The organization of colored persons
into the war service.
3d. The exchange of prisoners, fully set
forth in the letter of General Hitchcock.
4th. Operations under the act for enx-oll
ing and calling out the national forces, as de
tailed in the report of the Provost Marshal
General.
sth. The organization of the Invalid Corps.
6th. The operations of the several depart
ments of the Quartermaster General, Com
missary General, Paymaster General, Chief
of Engineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Sur
geon General.
It has appeared impossible to make an
available summary of this report, except such
as would be too extended for this place, and
hence I content myself in referring your at
tention to the report itself.
THE BLOCKADE.
The duties devolving on the naval branch
of the service during the year, and through
out the whole of this unhappy contest, have
been discharged with fidelity and eminent
success. The extensive blockade has been
constantly increasing in efficiency as the navy
has expanded ; yet, in so long a time, it has
so far been found impossible to entirely sup
press illicit trade. From the return's re
ceived at the Navy Department, it appears
that more than 1,000 vessels have been cap
tured since the blockade was instituted, and
that the value of prizes already sent in for
adjudication amounts to over §13,000,000.
THE NAVY.
The naval force of the United States con
sists at this time of 588 vessels, completed and
in course of completion, and of these 75 are
iron-clad armored steamers. The events of
the war give an increased interest and impor
tance to the Navy, which will probably ex
tend beyond the war itself. The armored
vessels in our Navy, completed and in service,
or which arc under contract and approaching
completion, ar believed to exceed in number
those of any other power, but while these
mnv ho relied on for harbor defence and sea
const soi vice, others of greater strength and
capacity will he necessary for cruising purpo
ses. and to maintain our rightful position on
the oeyan.
The change that has taken place in naval
v. M>l- and naval warfare since the introduc
tion of steam as a motive power for ships of
war, demands either a corresponding change
in some of our existing navy yards, or the
establishment of new ones for the construc
tion and necessary repairs of modern war
vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment,
delay and public injury has been experienced
from the want of such Government establish
ments. The necessity of such a navy yard
so furnished, at some suitable place upon the
Ml antic seaboard, has on repeated occasions
been brought to the attention of Congress by
the Nav\ Department, and is again presented
in the report of the Secretary, which accom
panies this communication. I think it my
duly to invite your especial attention to this
subject, and also to that of establishing yards
and depots for naval purposes upon one of
ihe western rivers. A naval force has been
created on these interior waters, and under
many disadvantages, w ithin a little more than
two years, exceeding in numbers the whole
naval force of the country at the commence
ment of the present Administration.
Satisfactory and important as have been the
performances of the heroic men of the navy,
at this interesting period, they are scarcely
more wonderful than the services of mer
chants and artizans in the production of war
vessels, which has created anew form of
naval power. Our country has advantages
superior to any other nation, in our resources
in iron and timber, with inexhaustible quan
tities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of
both, and all accessible and in close prox
imity to navigable waters. Without the ad
vantage of public works the resources of the
Nation have been developed, and its power
displayed in the construction of a navy of
such magnitude, which has at the very period
of its creation rendered signal service to the
Union. The increase of the number of seamen
in the public service—from 7,000 men in the
spring of 1861, to about 24,000 at the present
time—has been accomplished without special
legislation or extraordinary bounties to pro
mote that increase. It has been found, how
ever, that the operation of the draft—with
tlic high bounties paid for army recruits—is
beginning to effect injuriously the naval ser
vice, and will, if not corrected, be likely to
impair its etiiciency by detaching seamen from
their proper vocation and inducing thorn to
enter the army. I. therefore, respectfully
suggest that Congress might aid both the
army and the naval service, by adequate pro
visions on this subject, which would, at the
same time, be equitable to the communities
more especially interested.
I commend to your consideration the sug
gestions of the Secretary of the Navy, in re
gard to the policy of fostering and training
seamen for the naval service. The Naval
Academy is rendering signal service in pre
paring midshipmen for the highly responsible
duties which, in after life, they will be re
quired to perform. In order that the coun
try should not be deprived of a proper quota
of educated persons for which legal provision
has been made at the naval school, the va
cancies caused by neglect or omission to
make nominations from the States in insur
rection have been filled by the Secretary of
the Navy. The school is now more full and
complete than at any previous period, and is
in every respect entitled to the favorable
consideration of Congress.
POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
During the past fiscal year the financial
condition of the Postoffice Department has
been one of insreasing prosperity, and I am
gratified in being able to state that the re
ceipts of postal revenue have nearly equalled
the entire expenditure, the latter amounting
to $11,311,000.84 and the former to $11,163,-
789.09, leaving a deficiency of but §150,417.-
25. In the year immediately preceding the
rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $565,-
670,549, the postal receipts of that year being
§264,972,219 less than those of 1863. The
decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of
transportation has been only about 25 per
cent., but the annual expenditures on account
of the same have been reduced 35 per cent.
It is manifest therefore that the Postoffice
Department may become self-sustaining in a
few years, even with restoration of the whole
service.
The International Conference of postal
delegates from the principal countries of
Europe and America, which was called at the
suggestion of our Post Master General, met
at Paris on the 11th of May last, and con
cluded its deliberations on the Bth of June.
The principles established by the conference
as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse
between nations, and as the basis of future
conventions, inaugurate a general system of
uniform international charges at reduced
rates of postage, and cannot fail to produce
beneficial results.
THE INTERIOR.
I refer you to the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, which is herewith laid before
you, for useful and varied information in re
lation to the Public Lands, Indian Affairs,
Patents, Pensions and other matters of public
concern pertaining to that Department. The
quantity of laud disposed of during the last
and the first quarters of the present fiscal
year was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911
acres were sold for cash; 1,456,514 acres
were taken up under the homestead law, and
the residue disposed of, under the law grant
ing lands fo, military purposes, for railroads
and other purposes. It is also thought that
the sale of the public lauds is largely on the
increase. It has long been a cherished opin
ion of some of our wisest statesmen that the
people of the United States had a higher and
more enduring interest in the early settle
ment and substantial cultivation of the public
lands than in the amount of direct revenue
to be derived from the sale of them.
This opinion has had a controlling influence
in shaping legislation upon the subject of our
national domain, I may cite as evidence of
this, the liberal measures adopted in refer
ence to actual settlers ; the grant to States of
overflowed lands within their limits, in order
to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for
cultivation ; the grant to railroad companies
of alternate sections of land upon the con
templated lines of their roads that, when com
pleted, will largely multiply the facilities for
reaching our distant possessions.
This policy has rec -ived its most signal
and beneficent illustration in the recent en
actment giving homesteads to actual settlers.
Since the first day of January last, the be
fore-mentioned quantity of 1,456,514 acres
of land has been taken up under its provi
sions. This fact and the amount of sales
furnish gratifying evidence of the increasing
settlements upon public lands, notwithstand
ing a great struggle in which the energies of
the nation have been engaged and which has
required so large a withdrawal of our citi
zens from their accustomed pursuits.
I cordially concur in the recommendation
of the Secretary of the Interior, suggesting
a modification of the act in favor of those
engaged in the military and naval services of
the United Stales. 1 doubt not that Con
gress will cheerfully adopt such measures as
will, without essentially changing the general
features of the system, secure to the greatest
practicable extent its benefits to those wiio
have left their homes in defence of their
country in this arduous crisis.
I invite your attention to the views of the
Secretary of War, as to the propriety of
raising by legislative appropriation a revenue
from the mineral lands of the United States,
THE INDIANS.
The measures provided at your last session
for the removal of certain Indian tribes, have
been carried into effect. Sundry tribes have
been negotiated with and the treaties made
will, in due time, be submitted for the con
stitutional action of the Senate. They con
tain a stipulation for extinguishing the posses
sive rights of the Indians to large and valu
able tracts of land. It is probable that the
effects of these treaties will result in the es
tablishment of a permanent friendly relation
with such of these tribes as have been brought
into frequent and bloody #ollisions with our
out-lying settlements and emigrants. Sound
policy and our imperative duty to these tribes
demand of the Government an anxious and
constant attention to their well-being; to
their progress in the arts of civilization ; and,
above all, to that moral training which, under
the blessing of Divine Providence, will confer
upon them the elevated and sanctifiying in
fiuences, the hopes and consolations of the
Christian faith.
I suggested in my last annual message, the
propriety of remodeling our Indian system. —
Subsequent events 'have satisfied me of its
necessity. The uc tails set forth in the re
port of the Secretary, will evince the urgent
need for immediate legislative action.
I commend the benevolent institutions
established or patronized by the Government
in this district to your generous and fostering
care.
THE ILLINOIS CANAL.
The attention of Congress, during the last
session, was engaged, to some extent, with
appropriations for enlarging the water com
munications between the Mississippi river
and the north-eastern sea board, which ap
propriations, however, failed for the time.—
Since then, upon a call of the greatest re
spectability, a convention has been called at
Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of
whose proceedings is contained in a memo
rial address to the President and Consrress,
and which I now have the honor to lav before
you. That this interest is one which ere long
will force its own way, I do not entertain a
doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your
wisdom as to wdat can be now done. Aug
mented interest is given to this subject by
the actual commencement of work upon the
Pacific road, under auspices so favorable to
its rapid progress and completion. Enlarged
facilities of navigation become a palpable
need to the great reads.
AGRICULTURE.
1 transmit my annual report of the Comm is
sion of ‘.he Department of Agriculture, ask
ing your attention to developments in that
vital interest of tSe nation.
THE WAR EOR THE UNION.
When Congress assembled a year ago the
war had already lasted nearly twenty months
and there had been many conflicts on both
land and sea, with varying results. The re
bellion had been pressed back into reduced
limits, yet the tone of public feeling and
opinion, at home and abroad, was not satis
factory, and with other signs, the popular
elections, then just past, indicated uneasi
ness, while, amid much that was cold and me
nacing, the kindest words coming from Eu
rope wore uttered in accents of pity that we
were tco blind to surrender. Our commerce
was sulforing greatly by a few armed vessels
ouiit upon and furnished from foreign shores,
and we were tiireatened with such attacks
from the same quarter as would sweep our
trade from the sea‘*yid raise our blockade.
We had failed to elicit from European gov
ernments anything hopeful upon this subject.
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.
The Emancipation Proclamation which was
issued in September, was running its as
signed period to the beginning of the new
year. A month later the final proclamation
came, including the announcement that col
ored men of suitable condition would be re
ceived into the war service. The policy of
emancipation and of employing black sol
diers, gave to the future anew aspect, about
which hope and fear and doubt continued in
uncertain conflict.
According to our political system,as a mat
ter of civil administration, the General Gov
ernment had no lawful power to effect eman
cipation in any State, and for a long time it
had been hoped that the rebellion could be
suppressed without resorting to it as a mili
tary measure. It tvas all the while deemed
possible that the necessity for it might come,
and if it should, the crisis of the contest would
then be presented. It came, and as was in
timated, it was followed by dark and doubt
ful days.
PROGRESS.
Eleven months having been passed we are
permitted to take another review. The rebel
borders are pressed still further back and
by the complete opening of the Mississippi
river, the country dominated over by the re
bellion is divided into distinct parts, with no
practicable communication between them.—
Tennessee and Arkansas have been substan
tially cleared of insurgents’ control and influ
ence,and the citizens in each and even owners
of slaves, and advocates of slavery at the
beginning of the rebellion, now declare
openly for emancipation in their respective
(States. Of those States not included in the
emancipation proclamation, Maryland, and
Missouri, neither of which a year ago would
tolerate any restraint upon the extension of
slavery into the territories, only dispute now
as to the best mode of removing it, within
their own limits.
Of those who were slaves at the beginning
of the rebellion, full 100,000 are now in the
United States military service,about one half
of which number actually bear arms in the
ranks of.the United States forces, giving the
double advantage of taking so much labor
from the insurgents’ cause and supplying the
places which otherwise must be filled' with so
many white men. So far as tested it is diffi
cult to say that they are not as good soldiers
as any. No servile insurrection or tendency
to violence or cruelty has marked the meas
ures of emancipation of the blacks.
These measures have been much discussed
in foreign countries, and cotemporary with
such discussion the tone of public sentiment
there is much improved. At home the same
measures have been fully discussed, support
ed, criticised and denounced, and the annual
elections following are highly encouraging to
those whose special duty it is to bear the
country through this great trial, Tims we
have the reckoning. The crisis which threat
ened to divide tiie friends of the Union is
past.
A PLAN FOR RECONSTRUCTION.
Looking now to the present and future, and
with reference to a resumption of the Nation
al authority within the States wherein that
authority has been suspended, I have thought
fit to issue a Proclamation, a copy of which
is herewith transmitted. On examination of
this proclamation it will appear, as is believed,
amply justified by the Constitution. True,
the form of an oath is given, but no man is
coerced to take it. A man is only proffered
a pardon, in case he voluntarily takes the
oath, the Constitution authorizes the Execu
tive to grant, on terms fully established by
judicial and other authorities. It is also
proffered that if in any of the States named
a seat of government shall be, in the mode
prescribed, sot up, such government shall be
recognized and guaranteed by the United
States, and that under it the State shall, on
constitutional conditions, be protected
against invasion and domestic violence.
The constitutional obligation of the United
States to guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of government, and
to protect the State in the cases stated, is
explicit and full, but why tender the benefits
of this provision only to a State Government
set up in this particular way ? This section
of the Constitution contemplates a case where
in the element within a State, favorable to a
Republican Government in the Union, may
be too feeble for an opposite and hostile ele
ment external to, and even within the State,
and such are precisely the cases with which
we are now dealing. An attempt to guar
antee and protect a revived State Govern
ment, constructed in whole or in proponder
ating part from the very element against
whose hostility and violence it is to be pro
tected, is simply absurd. There must be a
test by which to separate opposing elements
so as to build only from the sound, and that
test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts
as sound whoever will make a sworn recan
tation of his former imsoundness.
But if it be proper to require as a test of
admission to the political body, an oath of al
legiance to the Constitution of the United
States and to the Union under it, why not al
so to the laws, and the proclamations in regard
to slavery? These laws and proclamations were
enacted and put forth for the purpose of aid
ing in the suppression of the rebellion. To
give them their fullest effect, there had to be
a pledge for their maintainance. In my judg
ment they have aided, and will further aid,
the cause for which thev were enacted and
put forth.
To give up this principle would be not only
to relinquish a lever of power, but would cl
so be a cruel and astounding breach of faith.
1 may add, at this point that, while 1 remain
in my present position I shall not attempt to
retract or modify the emancipation proclama
tion, nor shall I return to slavery any person
who is free by the terms of the proclamation
or by any act of Congress.
For those and other resolutions it is thought j
best that the support of these provisions
shall be included in the oath,and it is believed
that the Executive may lawfully claim it in
return for pardon and th restoration of for
feited rights, which he has a clear constitu
tional power to withhold altogether, or grant
upon the terms which he shall deem wisest
for the public interest. It should be observed
also that this part of the oath is subject to
the modifying and abrogating power of legis
lation and the supreme judicial decision.
The proposed acquiescence of the National
Executive in any honorable temporary state
arrangement for the freed people, is made
with the view of possibly modifying the con
fusion which must, at best, attend [;-] all
classes by a total revolution of labor through
out the revolted states.
It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted
people in those states may be somewhat more
ready to give up the cause of their affliction
to this extent, if this vital matter be left to
themselves, while no power of the National
Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged
by the proposition. The suggestion in the
proclamation as to maintaining the political
frame-work of the States or what is called
“reconstruction,’’ is made in the hope that it
may do good without the danger of doing
harm. It will save labor and avoid great
confusion.
But why any proclamation now upon this
subject? This question is beset with the
conflicting views that the step might be de
layed too long, or be taken too soon. In
some States the elements of a resumption
seem ready for action, but remain inactive,
apparently for want of a rallying point or
plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan
of B, rather than JB that of A ? and if A and
B should agree, how can they know that the
General Government here will respect their
plans ? By the Proclamation a plan is pre
sented which may be accepted by them as a
rallying point, and which they are assured in
advance will not be rejected here. This may
bring them to action sooner than they other
wise would. •
The objection to a premature presentation
of a plan by the National Executive consists
in the danger of committal on points which
could be more safely left to future develope
ment. Care has been taken to shape the doc
ument so as to avoid embarrassment from
this source. In saying that certain classes
will be pardoned, with their rights restored,
it is not said that other classes, on other
terms, will never be included. In saying
that a reconstruction will be accepted if pre
sented in a specified way, it is not said that
it will never be accepted’ in any other way.
EMANCIPATION.
Tilt; movements for emancipation in seve
ral of the States not included in the emanci
pation proclamation are matters of profound
congratulation, and while I do not repeat in
detail what 1 have heretofore so earnestly
said upon this subject, nr, general views anil
feelings remain unchanged, and I trust Con
gress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding
these important steps to the great consumma
tion.
TRIBUTE TO SOLDIERS AM) SAILORS.
In the midst of other cares, however im
portant, we must not lose sight of the fact
that the war power is still our main re dance.
To that power alone can we look for am thing to
give confidence to the people in the contested
regions that the insurgent power will not again
overrun them. Until that confidence shall
be established little can be done anywhere
for what is called reconstruction, hence our
chief efforts must be directed to the army
and navy who have thus far done their hard
er part so nobly and well. It may be es
teemed fortunate that in giving the greatest
efficiency to their indispensable arms we do
also honorably encourage gallant men, from
the commander to the sentinel, who compose
them, and to whom, more than all others, the
world must stand indebted for the home of
freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged
and perpetuated.

The following proclamation is appended to
the message :
PROCLAMATION.
Whereas, By the Constitution of tlic United
States, it is provided that the President shall have
power to grant reprieves and pardons for olleuses
against the United States, except in cases of im
peachment, and—
Whereas, a rebellion now exists whereby the loy
al state governments of several states have for a
long time been subverted and many persons have
committed and are now guilty of treason against
the United States, and
Whereas, With reference to said rebellion and
treason laws have been enacted by Congress, en
acting the forfeiture and confiscation of property
and liberation of slaves of all upon the terms and
conditions therein stated, and also declaring that
the President was thereby authorized at any time
thereafter, by proclamation to extend pardon to
persons who may have participated in the existing
rebellion in any state or part of a state, with such
exceptions and at such terms, and on such condi
tions as he may deem expedient for the public wel
fare; and
Whereas, the Congressional declaration tor
limited and conditional pardon accords with well
established judicial expositions of the pardoning
power; and
Whereas, V ith reference to said rebellion, the
President of the United States has issued several
proclamations with provisions m regard to the lib
eration of slaves ; and
]fherca3, It is now desired, by some persons here
tofore engaged in said rebellion, to resume their
allegiance to the United States, and reinaugurate
loyal State Governments within and for their re
spective States ;
Now therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, do proclaim, declare and
make known to all persons who have, directly or
by implication, participated in the existing rebel
lion, save as hereinafter excepted,—that a full par
don is granted to them, with the restoration of all
their rights, upon the condition that e-ery such
person shall take and subscribe an oath ad thence
forward keep and maintain said oath in T .olate, and
which oath shall be recorded for pe- aanent pre
servation, and shall beef the tenor and effect fol
lowing, to wit :
jg/G Jo solemnly swear , in the presence of Almigh
ty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support,
protect and defend the Constitution and laws of the
United States, and the Union of the States there
under: and that I will, in like manner,abide by and
faithfully support all the acts of Congress passed
during the existing rebellion with refer
ence to slaves, so long and so far as
not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress,
or by the decision of the Supreme Court; and that
I will in like manner abide by and faithfully sup
port all Proclamations of the President, made du
ring the existing rebellion, having reference to
slaves, so long and so far as not modified or de.
dared void by the decision of the Supreme Court,
so help me God.”
The persons excepted from the benefits of the
foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have
been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the
so-called Confederate government; all who have left
judicial stations under the United States to aid the
rebellion; all who are or shall have been military or
naval officers of the rank of Colonel in the army
or lieutenant ; n the navy ; all who left seats in the
United States Congress to aid in the rebellion ; all
who resigned their commissions in the army and
navy of the United States, and afterwards aided
the rebellion ; and all who have engaged in any
manner in treating colored persons, or white
persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully
as prisoners of war, and which persons may be
found in the United States service as soldiers, sea
men, or in any other capacity.
I do further proclaim, declare and make known,
that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas,
Texas. Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, or North Caroli
na, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth
of the number of the votes cast in such States at
the Presidential election of the year of our Lord
1860, —each having taken the oath aforesaid and
not having since violated it, and being a qualified
voter, by the election laws of the State exist
ing immediately before the so-called act of se
cession, and excluding all others—shall establish
a State Government which shall be Republican
in form and in no wise contravening said oath,
such shall be recognized as the true Government
of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder
the benefits of the constitutional provision which
declares that the United States shall guarantee to
every State in this Union a Republican form of
Government, and shall protect each of them against
invasion, and on application of the Legislature, or
the Executive when the Legislature connot be con
vened, against domestic violence.
I do further preclaim, declare and make known,
that any provision which may be adopted by such
State Government, in relation to the freed people
of such State, which shall recojfniie acd declare
their permanent freedom .n4 provide for their edu
cation, and which may yet he consistent as a tem
porary arrangement with their present condition a*

State Governments, has no reference to States
whereof the State Governments have all the while

members, sent to Congress from any State, shall be

with the respective Houses, and not, to any extent,
with the Executive ; and still further, that this
Proclamation is intended to present to the
people of the States wherein the. National
authority nas been suspended and the loyal State
governments have been supplanted, a mode by
which the national authority over every loyal
state government may be established within said

WWIII CONGRESS— FIRST SESSION.
Washington, Dec. 7.
House.— At noon Etheridge, the Clerk,
called the House to order, and said he would
proceed to Call the roll of names of such
members only, whose credentials show that
they were regularly elected in accordance
with the laws of their state and the United
States.
The Clerk then read the roil of members
from all the States excepting Maryland, West
Virginia, Oregon, Missouri, and Kansas.
Mr. Stevens, of Penn., desired that the
credentials of all those whose names were not
on the roll be read.
The Clerk said he had placed on the roll
the names of those whose credentials bore
evidence in accordance with the law passed
by this House in March last.
Mr. \V ashburue asked whether there were
any contestants of seats.
The Clerk replied that there were three or
lour from Missouri, one from Virginia and
one from Kentucky as he recollected.
Mr. Stevens repeated his request.
AN ACT regulating the duties of the Clerk of the
House of Representatives in preparing for the
organization of the House.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives of the United States of America in Con
gress assembled, That before the first meeting of
the next Congress, and every subsequent Congress,
the Clerk of the next proceeding House of Repre
sentatives shall make a roll of the Representa
tives elect, and place thereon the names of all per
sons, and of such persons only, whose credentials
show that they were regularly elected in accord
ance with the laws of their States respectively, or
the laws of the United States.
At the request of Mr. Stevens the Clerk
read the form of the credentials of the Mis
souri members which he had ruled out for
informality.
Mr. Dawes offered a resolution that the
names of the Maryland delegation be placed
on the rolls of the House and moved the pre
vious question, which w as seconded.
Mr. J. C. Allen moved to lay the resolution
on the table.
The question was taken on Mr. Allen’s
motion to lay Mr. Dawes resolution on the
table and it was decided in the negative—
yeas 74, nays 94; which caused much ap
plause from the galleries, and on the floor of
the House.
Mr. Dawes demanded a vote on his resolu
tion, which was adopted, followed by ap
plause. So the names of the Maryland dele
gates were placed on the roll.
The names of the members from Missouri,
Oregon, Kansas, Virginia and West Virginia
were directed to be placed upon the roll.
Mr. Stevens then asked that the credentials
of the Louisiana members—Messrs. Beal,
Coltman and Baker—be read. The creden
tials state that the election was in accord
ance with the Constitution and laws of Loui
siana, and that said election was held on the
2d of November last. The credentials of the
Louisiana members are signed by “J. L.
Riddle, Governor of Louisiana.”
Mr. Stevens moved that the names of the
Louisiana members be stricken from the rolls.
Mr. Brooks said the House could elect a
Speaker without the names of these Louisi
ana gentlemen being stricken off the rolls.
Mr. Stevens protested against their admis
sion, but in order to facilitate the organiza
tion of the House, he would withdraw his
motion for the present, and again offer it
when the Louisiana members were to be
sworn in.
Mr. Washburn moved that the House pro
ceed to the election of a Speaker viva voce,
which was agreed to.
Mr. Washburn nominated Mr. S. Colfax,
Mr. Pendleton nominated Mr. Samuel Cox.
Messrs. Pendleton, Dawes, Wadsworth,
and Pomeroy, were appointed tellers to con
duct the election. The House then proceed
ed to vote with the following result: Whole
number of votes, 181; necessary to a choice,
92 ; Colfax, 101; Cox, 42 ; King, 4 ; Mallo
ry, 10 ; Stebbins, 8 ; Dawson, 12 ; Blair, 2 ;
Stiles, 1.
The Clerk declared Mr. Colfax duly and
legally elected. The announcement was
greeted with vociferous applause.
Messrs. Dawson and Cox were appointed
to conduct the Speaker to the chair.
The Speaker, on taking the chair, delivered
a brief, eloquent, and patriotic address, which
was received with general applause.
The members of the House were then
sworn in. The names of the members from
Louisiana being called, Mr. Stevens objected
to their being sworn in. Considerable dis
cussion ensued, when Mr. Stevens offered a
resolution that their credentials be referred
to the committee on elections. Mr. Allen
moved to lay the matter on the table. This
was lost by 107 to 74. The resolution of Mr.
Stevens was then adopted by 100 to 74.
The Clerk then proceeded to administer
the oath to the delegates from the several
Territories. The House then adjourned.
Senate.— The Vice President called the
Senate to order at noon.
The credentials of Messrs. Willey and Van
Winckle, Senators elected from West Vir
ginia, were presented by Sen. Collamer.
The credentials of Mr. Conniss, of Califor
nia, were presented by Sen. Nesmith, and the
credentials of Mr. Henderson, of Mo., by
Sen. Foote. Messrs. Conness and Hender
son were qualified and took the oath of loy
alty prescribed by the last Congress.
Sen. Davis rose with a question of the
right of the gentlemen from West Virginia
to take a seat. He held that there was con
stitutionally and legally no such state as West
Virginia ; therefore there could be no Sena
tors from such State. His object was simply
to put on record his objections. He believed
the old State to be intact and that this whole
thing is a flagrant violation of the Constitu
tion.
After debate, Senator Davis, as a test ques
tion moved that the ©ath of office be admin
istered to the gentlemen from West Virginia,
which was carried by yeas 30, nays 5 ; the
nays being Buckalew, Davis, Hendricks, Mc-
Dougal, and Powell.
On motion of Sen. Foote, a resolution was
adopted appointing a committee of three, in
connection with a committee on the part of
the House, to wait upon the President of the
United States, and inform him of the readi
ness of Congress to receive his annual mes
sage. Senators Foote, Trumbull and Nesmith
were appointed.
Sen. Foote offered a resolution for the
classification of the Senators from West Vir
ginia by the usual means, drawing by lot,
which was adopted.
Sen. Van Winckle was chosen to fill the
long term, expiring in 1869, and Sen. Willey
the short term expiring in 1865.
Senator Lane, of Indiana, gave notice of
the introduction of bills to repeal the *3OO
commutation feature of the enrollment act,
ad to increase the pay of non-commissioned
officers and privates in the army fiftv per
cent. r
The daily hour of meeting was fixed at
two o’clock.
Washington', Dec. 8.
®^ CsE ,‘^r McPiierson was elected Clerk, re
ceiving It 1 votes against 69 for Etheridge. He
was t en declared elected and entered upon
the duties of his office.
Ordway of New Hampshire was elected
bergeant-ut Arms.
The House re-elected Ira Goodnow the
present incumbent, doorkeeper. He receiv
ed 98 votes, 79 being necessarv to a choice
W. S. King, of Minnesota, was re-elected
postmaster by 104 out of 166 votes cast.
Mr. Dawes presented the credentials of
Messrs Segar, Kitchen and Chandler from
\ irginia, which were referred to the Com
mittee on Elections.
Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, offered a reso
lution presenting the thanks of Congress to
Maj. Gen. Grant and the officers and soldiers
who have fought under him during the re
bellion, and providing that the President
cause a medal to be struck for Gen. Grant, in
the name of the people of the United States.
This was passed unanimously, without a word
of debate or explanation.
Mr. Cox said he desired to offer a resolu
tion respectfully requesting the President to
lake immediate steps for the exchange of our
prisoners in the prisons of the South, and
that he communicate all correspondence in
the War Department relative to the exchange
of prisoners. After some discussion the reso
lution was laid over.
Mr. Arnold gave notice of bills to prohibit
slavery forever in the territory included in
the President’s emancipation proclamation;
also to repeal so much of the enrollment act
as authorized the discharge of a person draft
ed on the payment of S3OO.
Senate.— Senator Wilson, of Mass., sub
mitted a resolution that the committee on
Military Affairs inquire what legislation is
necessary to facilitate the payment of back
pay and pensions of deceased soldiers, kc.
Senator Davis, of Ky., submitted the fol
lowing :
liesclved , That the refusal of the rebel authorities
to exchange negro soldiers and their white officers
should not prevent the exchange of our other sol
diers and officers in rebel prisons on such justterms
as will prevent suffering to our bravo officers and
soldiers in the hands of the enemy.
The resolution was laid over.
Senator Sherman called up his resolution
that the Judiciary Committee inquire and re
port whether Kobt. VV ilson was still a Senator
from Missouri.
Senator Trumbull moved to amend the res
olution by declaring that Wilson was not en
titled to a seat in the Senate, which was
agreed to, and the resolution as amended
was adopted.
The Clerk of the House appeared and an
nounced tiiat the House had organized, and
appointed a committee to wait upon the Pres
ident, with the Senate committee, to inform
him that both Houses were ready for business.
Senator IV ilson, of Massachusetts, gave
notice of a bill to increase the bounty for
volunteering, and to make an appropriation
for the same.
PROCLAMATION BY THE PRESIDENT.
Executive Mansion, Washington, D. 0.. Deo. 7.
Reliable information having been received that
the insurgents’ force is retreating from East Ten
nessee, under circumstances rendering it probable
that the Union forces cannot be hereafter dislodged
from that important position, and esteeming this
to be of high National consequence, I recommend
that all loyal people do, on receipt of this infor
mation, assemble at their places of worship, and
render special homage and gratitude to Almighty
God for this great advance of the National cause.

FROM EAST TENNESSEE.
Knoxville, Dec. 5.
A special to the Tribune ‘-•ays the seige of
Knoxville is raised, and Longstreet with his
army is in full retreat towards Virginia. It
virtually terminated yesterday, when at an
early hour the advance guard of our rein
forcements under Gen. Sherman arrived. The
enemy, during t’.n last few days, kept up an
active show of in intention to prolong the
seigo or renew an assault until early this
morning, when a reconnoisance sent out by
Gen. Ferrero found their works empty.
A few deserters were brought in, who re
port that the main body moved off after dark
last night, leaving the rear guard and pickets
in their rifle pits to fall back at 2 A. M., and
join the remainder, who, they were told,
would form a line of battle a short distance
east of Cincinnati. This ruse was adopted to
prevent their premature abandonment of their
picket line.
Gen. Shackelford, with his cavalry, is al
ready in pursuit and close upon their rear.
Prisoners and deserters are continually arriv
ing in squads of 10 to 20.
