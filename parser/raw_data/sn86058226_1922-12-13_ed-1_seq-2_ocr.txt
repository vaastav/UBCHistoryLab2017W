"PENALTIES," SAYS
MARY LOCKE HURIN
American policies, new Central Eu
ropean state, the premier's confer
ence, and other national and Interna
tional topics were reviewed by Mary
Locke Hurin in her Current Event 3
address before the Civics department
of the 'Woman's club Tuesday after
noon at the First English Lutheran
church. -
Our country's policies as outlined in
the president's message to congress
wero pa,ssed over briefly by the
speaker.
"The law ot exchange and econom
ics takes no account of guilt or Inno
cence," Mrs. Hurin declared In dis
cussing Germany's condition and pos
sibility of another moratorium in Jan
uary. France's demonds, she said, are
not "guarantees" Dut "penalities.'
French exploitation of the Ruhr, she
continued, would result in a great
triumph for a time but it would be
temporary.. France in taking the Ruhr
would acquire all the metallurglc and
coal resources of Germany which
would be a crushing blow to that coun
try. The breakdown of the premiers'
conference in London Is partly due to
this question as not even Bonar Law
feels that he can side with the French
in this matter.
The premiers are so at variance that
the Brussels conference would as yet
be useless. Lloyd George, the speak
er commented, is laughing up his
sleeve in the meantime because Bona
Law's conservative policy is getting
no further than he with his Liberal
policy.
Jugo-Slavia, Czecho-Slovakia, and
Roumania were discussed In connec
tion with their little entente treaty and
the conditions and rltuatlons which
they were presenting. The people of
the first two countries which were so
oppressed by the German magyars,
have made great tdvances educa
tionally.
