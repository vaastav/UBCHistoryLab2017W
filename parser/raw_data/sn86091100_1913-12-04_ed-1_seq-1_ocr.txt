BOLEB-PABK8 WEDDING.
Yesterday at high noon occurred a
beautiful wedding when Mr. H. Saxby
Boles and Miss Hazel C. Parks
united in marriage at the home of the
bride's mother Mrs. Fred Noyes of this
city. The bride was attired in a dainty
white French serge dress while the
groom wore the conventional black. A
beautiful wedding march was played by
Miss Pearl Hubbard while the couple
marched to the parlor where A. F. Van
Slvke of the Christian chureh in a very
impressive ring service spoke the words
whieh made them one. After eongratu
lations all repaired to the dinning room
where a sumptuous dinner was served.
There were about 30 relatives and
friends present and the bride and
groom were the recipients of many
useful and valuable presents. The
bride is a highly respected and accom
plished young school teacher of this
county and is well and favorably
known. The groom is a prosperous
young rancher and has a wide circle of
friends throughout the county. They
will go at once to the groom's ranch on
the Joseph plains near Holes. The
Free Press joins their many friends in
congratulations.

GETS TREATMENT AT HOME.
Mr. •ami Mrs. (Jhas. II. Everest came
in ou Thursday evening's train from a
visit to Spokane and Moscow where
they have been consulting specialists
for Mrs. Everest's hearing. The spe
cialists say Mrs. Edward's hearing is
nearly gone and there is no hope of it
ever being restored. A Spokane doctor
says the only thing that can be done
to help her retain the little hearing
she has. is an operation on the nose to
remove an obstruction that has existed
since childhood. However, a Moscow
speeialist says that the treatment can
be done just as well and as skillfully
by local physicians, one of whom has
been consulted by Mrs. Everest and
who is now treating the case with every
assurance of success.
MUCH SNOW AT HUMP.
T. B. Fuller returned the first of the
week from his trip into the mountains
in the Buffalo Hump district. Mr. Ful

A BULL MOOSE TICKET.
\
Cruzen for Senator and Martin for
Governor for "Social Justice.''
I Alonzo Crunzen of Boise 11s the Hull
Moose candidate for United (States
; senator, and Guy H. Martin us the
Bull Moose candidate for governor—
these two in a large touring car makiug
j a house-to-house canvass of the entire
state, a canvass that is to consume six
months and make it possible to reach
every hamlet in Idnho in the interest of
"social justice"—this is the picture
that occupies first place in the imagina
tion of the men who control the destiny
of the Progressive party at this time
in Idaho.
Talk of this
'ombination has been
going the rounds for days anil weeks.
It was announced on good authority
that Cruzen was to go to California
for a brief stay,
was to take Martin aboard a large
touring car and spend six solid mouths
campaigning, not in the eities, but out
in the country holding small school
house meetings and speaking to the
voters fare to fare in their homes.
The combination seems to have
pealed to the party leaders as ideal—

party either. Republicans and demo

progressives.
"You may say for me," Mr. Cruzen
said, "that I am not talking politics at
this time; that I am so busy building
the Boise-Winnemucea railroad that I
have no time for politics."
But from sources close to Mr. Cruz
en it is learned that he is determined
to have a vindication for what he
considers the disgrace forced upon him
in the newspaper contempt case a year
ago. He feels, it is said that he was
made the victim of injustice in that
case; that he wns decorated with the
order of the double cross, and that now
he is in position to dear his name be
fore the people of the whole state.
Whether he will do this by making a
fight for another or for himself for the
senate remains for the future to reveal.

K. Parker who has charge of the

town of Clearwater was in the county
seat the last of the week on business.
He took advantage of the two days
vacation caused by Thanksgiving ami
came over here to transact some busi
ness at the county superintendent's
office and to interview his many
friends in Grangeville. He says that
the Clearwater schools has an attend
ance of about 75 pupils and that splen
did progress is being made. Two in
structors are employed.
WILL OPERATE STOCK RANCH.
Lee Smith left this week for his new
home at Rogersburg, Washington,
where he has purchased a stock ranch
of 400 acres. He expects to go onto the
live stock business on a large scale and
believes that ho has selected a good
neck of the woods to make that kind
of a venture pay from the start. The
other members of the Smith family are
at present residing at Asotin but they
will join Mr. Smith at Rogeraburg
within a short time.

PROFESSOR OLIN WRITES THAT
DEMONSTRATION TRAIN MAY
ARRIVE HERE ON DEC. 17.
HOLD MEETING THURSDAY
Students of Schools May Attend Lec
tures in Body—Farmers Urged to
be on Hand Early.
Great benefit to the agricultural in
terests of the piairie country and all
Idaho county in fact is bound to accrue
from the visit of the
"Livestock
Special,'' the special train which comes
to Orangeville from the state univer
sity at Moscow on December 18, two
weeks from today.
Professor W. H. Oliu, director of
agricultural extension of the university,
has written Dr. H. J. Smith to tho
effect that the train will probably
reach Orangeville on the evening of
December 17 and that the meeting prop
will commence the following
ing at 8 o'clock sharp. It is also likely
according to
er
morn
'rofessor Olin 's letter,
that the time limit will be extended
from 8 to 10 o'clock as originally an
nounced, to 10:30 o'clock. The change,
it is claimed, will be greatly appreciat
ed by the farmers and livestock men,
in particular, who will be pressed for
time if the original time schedule is
adhered to.
Schoots Turn Out.
At the suggestion of Professor Olin
it is quite probable that all the stu
dents iu the local schools together with
the instructors and teachers will go to
the depot in a body on the morning of
the 18th to attend the meeting of the
university experts and the farmers, to
hear the lectures and to witness the
fine livestock to be brought from the
university's farms. It is argued that
this visit of the experts is au excellent
opportunity for the school students to
acquire practical, first-hand knowledge.
Ladies are especially invited to be
on hand at the depot during the visit
of the experts. Miss Jpsie M. Hoover,
head of the department of home
omirs, and Miss Amy Kelly of the home
economics extension department, have
charge of the home economics
train ami will give special lectures
to the ladies.

Is Unusual Opportunity.
This visit of the university experts is
of great import to Camus Prairie and
citizens of both town arid country
should avail themselves of this
tunity. The lecturers whi
pany the train are: Acting President
W. L. Carlyle; Professor W. n. Olin of
the agricultural extension department;
Professor E. V. Ellington of the depart
ment of dairying; E. F. Rinehart, live
stock field man for Idaho; Miss Jessie
N. Hoover, head of the department of
home economics, ami Miss Amy Kelly
of the home economics extension de
partment.
A feature of the campaign is a series
of letters that are being sent to every
rural school teacher in the sections
through which the train will run. It
is requested iu these letters that each
teacher announce the coming of the
train in his school and make an effort
to interest everybody in his community
in order that the attendance may be as
large as possible.

DIED AT WALLACE.
A telegram was received here Tues
day evening announcing the death of
Mrs. Ed Lockhart at Wallace that day.
Mrs. Ivockhart was formerly Miss
Nellie Crooks and is well known in
Grangeville and in Idaho county where
she grew to womanhood. The body
was brought to Grangeville and the
funeral will be held Saturday after
noon.
WHY HE CHANGED HIS MIND.
Somebody asked George D. Smith, a
well known resident of Grangeville and
Idaho county, at the Commercial elnb
luncheon whether or not he intended
visiting the Lewiston livestock show.
"Well, I did intended to go to Lewiston
and then to Portland," replied the
genial George; "but I got my tax
statement from the county this week
and I decided I'd stay at home."
