HONDA Y, DECEMBER 5, 1S9S.
The Mrskaai'.
The President's message is not longer
than the events of the past five months
would warrant, but it is worthy of note
that the most important of these, the
war with Spain and the enlarged re
sponsibilities of the nation growing out
of it, tak'e but a small part of the
whole. Besides an outline history of
conflict there aie only the briefest refer
ences to the fruits of victory, thes?
matters being reserved for special mes
sages on the completion of the treaty
and when tht need for legislation touch
ing the islands arises. No advantage is
taken of the opportunity for a display
of eloquent enthusiasm. On the con
trary, there is an apparently studied
effort to keep the ivcitnl as free from
the exhibition of emotion as possible.
The message i elates the t vents leading
up to the war briefly, dwelling on the
efforts of the President to reach a satis
factory settlement of the Cuban trouble 1
by peaceable means. It describes in a S
few lines the suite rings of the Cuban.- I
hd the complete failure of Spain to !
respond to his endeavors, the patience j
! the American people during the in- '
vestigution of the "vlaine tragedy, and
his final disappointment which induced ,
him to remit the whole question to '
Congress. He pays a tribute to the
Iatriotism of that body which was I
shown by generous appropriations and j
the prompt granting of the power to
declare war, etc. There is nothing in '
W? ..utlA --.sM ; o 1 tli.it- !o ..a..- t.-k .l.i 1

ccn.tary of T ar, that "the outbreak of , , ,,

war lound us not unprepared to meet ....
,, ,f!int " a ,,,ni, i .i-ii I del's Pwl"'. llst ns certainly they are
to the remarkable victory of Dewey,
and in the mention of the "destruction of
Cervera's fleet there is a careful omis
sion of names, the credit being given in
a general way. Of the Santiago cam
paign nothing is said touching the scan
dals and there is no reference to th
ravages ot epidemic disease in the
camps of mobilization. There is, how
ever, unstinted praise for the army, to
the lied Cross and our patriotic pe?
Me. A bare outline of the history of the
peace negotiations, from the signing of
the protocol to the meeting jf the Peace
Commissioners at Paris, completes the
President's story of the war. He re
serves all discussion of the treaty of
peace and the future of our new pos
sessions lor later messages, concluding
with the statemtnt that it will be neces
sary to continue for a time the military
government of the present. In Cuba,
"Spanish rule must be replaced by a
just, benevolent and humane govern
jiK'iit. created by the people of Cuba."
I'ntll there is complete tranquillity,
military rule by this country must be
maintained. The greater part of the
document deals with our foreign rela
tions, and gives a brief history of
events in Central America. Included in
tins part of the message is a reference
to the Nicaragua Canal, on which Rear
Admiral Walker's commission is soon
to make a report. He urges some defi
nite action by Congress in view of an
option granted by Nicaragua to another
association. The President touches on
our Chinese relations, asserting our
claim to a share in the trade and the
protection of our citizens in any future
arrangements by the European powers.
He approves the suggestion of a com
mission to study the commercial and
industrial conditions of China. At pres
ent we are ready to send warships
there to protect our citizens and our in
terests. Nothing is said, d.icctly, of our
willingness lo co-operate with England
and there is an excess of caution and
reserve In ihe neglect to refer to En
gland's efforts for more cordial relations
with this country.
There is less of an abstract of the re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury
than is usual. That portion of his pre
vious message advocating legislation
for the gradual retirement of the green
backs is repeated and there Is a three
line statement of an obvious demand
for other legislation relating to the cur
rency, which the reader is left to con
strue as he will. There is a warm ap
proval of the suggestion of a centennial
celebration at the Capital in
1900 and a request for an appro
priation and the appointment of com
mittees from both Houses. It is sug
gested that the President also appoint
a committee from the country at large
Jo make the plans for a great celebra-
Uon to the establishment of the Capital
at Washington. Th? remaining matteis
are of minor interest, though some of
them are important to Congress and
the departments. It Is u clearly-written
document with an easy evasion of every
embarrassing concern. There Is not a
hint of' the won? of the Alger Relief
Commission and no suggestion of a
Congressional investigation. In respect
of the things about which the country
would like the President's opinion there
is only disappointment to the hopeful
reader.
The Meeting1 of Congress.
After a five months' rest from the
active work of legislation and after di
rect contact with the people, the mem
bers of the National Congress return to
Washington. Not since the civil war
has so much transpired In the time of
recess to affect their labors. As a
rule, the closing session of a Congress Is
chiefly devoted by the majority to evad
ing positive action. The time is com
paratively short, even to take up the
threads of the preceding session. In
this instance much that interested the
members in the past has been overshad
owed by the intervention of a war and
the many concerns that grow out of it.
These exceed In number and importance
anything wo have known since the re
construction period, and in some re
spects they are not unlike those of that
time. Then there was the problem of
establishing a form of government for
the Southern States, and there was an
army of place-seekers eager to make
the most of the opportunity. Now we
are to face the problem of devising a
svstcm of administration for new de-
pendencies, the conditions of which are
., . . , . . ,, . .v,i1.1iiif
otm l" utr ".-........ " ,.--.
however, that owing to the immediate
eeeSbtv of military rule in the islands,
" ''---
Congress will go only SO far during tne
j,tfSSion as the situation compels it
a ,.,,-,..
to go. A fair estimate of the President s
sentiments has been made in advance of
,..,,,,, ,iaa ,hft r-
mr iuksusc """" m... ....? ...-
Hon required for carrying out ins
scheme of temporary administration.
We may hope that he will escape for a
time the ptessure of the politicians, who
see in the civil government of the new
colonies the chance of their lives for
plunder. Soon or late that will have to
be met, but the longer it is delayed the
stronger will become the public senti
ment in favor of clean administration.
Since Congress adjourned the war
that the Democratic minority with the
aid of a minority of the Republicans
forced the laggard Administration to
undertake, has been carried to a suc-
j evssful end. Out of its maladministra
tion has grown gigantic scandals that
j call for impartial investigation. In
! spite of the effort to forestall and pre-
Ivent a Congressional Inquiry, a patient
but indignant people look confidently to
I their representatives to probe the cruel
! btfsiness to the bottom. Out of the re
sults of the Avar has come the question
of national expansion. After a study
of popular opinion that was certainly
long enough to be thorough, the Presi
dent decided in favor of assuming the
burdens and benefits of American lule
in the Philippines. His decision has
been effective in obtaining fiom Spain
a surinder of all title to the archipel
ago in a treaty that is in course of com
pletion. On the Senate is imposed the
duty of ratifying the treaty and on the
House the necessity of whatever legis
lation the possession of The islands in
volves. In response to the personal ap
peal of the President, the people have
stood by him in every step, regardless
of the hysterical anguish of an un
American minority of foreign birth or
sympathies. What the people them-
a command to Congress to support that
policy. It is about this that the strong
est interest centers.
An intelligent forecast of the session
does not encourage the idea of any
diastic legislation in respect of either
the tariff or the finances. If the blind
est of the protectionists refuse to see in
our new conditions and relations the
end of the policy of favor to special
classes, at least they realize that the
problem is not as simple as formerly.
Some light is bound to penetrate their
understanding even before this Con
gress passes away.
If there are enougli, opponents of the
Spanish treaty in the country to keep the
few public enemies of expansion in coun
tenance, they keep very still. Except a
little rural Democratic paper here and
there, all the press urges the prompt rati
fication of the treaty and threatens sena
tors who delay It with an unpleasant no
toriety. Ever since the establishment of the pres
ent alleged republic in France, the Lon
don Spectator has been expecting Its
overthrow. At least six times it has dis
tinctly announced that the end was im
mediately at hand. This time there Is
good reason to believe it has made an ac
curate prophecy. When France herself
admits that the conditions arencompat
Ible with the existence of a republic, as
no doubt they are, we may surely look
for an end. France is not and has never
been a republic in fact.
One of the minor results of the war is
a desire on the part of the Kaiser that
his eldest son and heir shall with his own
eyes inspect the greatness of the latest
world power. Accordingly, It is said, the
crown prince will shortly make a tour of
the United States in strict incognito. It
is a great pity that his father could not
have enjoyed h like opportunity. In that
case he would now know a great deal
about tilings on this side of the water
that It will be hard for him to realize
from books and the reports of others.
AilmltH the Democratic Tlelory.
Parsons, W. Ya., Dec. u. Judge Phlletus
Lipscomb, the defeated Republican candi
date for the legislature in Tucker County,
was urged last week by Gov. Atkinson,
and Secretary of State Dawson to contest
the election of Mr. Wagoner, his success
ful Democratic opponent. 3Ir. Lipscomb
firmly refused to be a party to contest,
saying: "Go back and tell Dawson and
Gov. Atkinson that if they want this no
tice served they will have to sign it them
selves and do the swearing. I was beaten
for the legislature In this county, and
have no grounds for contest against ifr.
Wagoner, and I decline to be a party to
any scheme which looks to deprive him of
the seat in the legislature to which he
was elected." In this county there had
been a recount a few days after the elec
tion, at the request of air. Lipscomb, but
the recount showed a gain In favor of Mr.
Wagoner.

The annual repot t of the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia was today sub
mitted to President McKinley and trans
mitted to Congiess by him with his annual
mej-sage. The report Is a voluminous af
fair and contains the record of the olllclal
doings of the local Government during the
fiscal year which ended June 20 last.
The basis of the report Is something
more than fifty annual reports of subor
dinate ofllcers and heads of various de
partments of' tlie District government, In
cluding the chief of police, the lofcal health
ofiicer, the superintendent of charities, the
auditor, assessor and others. These were
submitted from time to time during the
late Summer and early Fall months and
have been fully considered and digested
by the Commissioners in joint hoard ses
sion. In preparing their annual report some ot'
the recommendations made by the subor
dinate olllcers were adopted and reiter
ated. Other suggestions which failed to
meet with the approval of the board, or
which in their opinion it would not be
wise and expedient to make at the present
time, were pigeonholed and left out of
their annual report.
The report is as follows:
Appropriation) mill HeveiinvN.
"The appropriations for the year which
were payable out of the general revenues,
excepting those for the water department,
were $C,091,4.25. The receipts from taxes
and other resources applicable to the pay
ment of said appropriations were 17,009,
KJG.26. "The expenditures ot the water depart
ment were $205,853.35, and were payable
from water rents and assesmentb. The
revenues of said department were $109,
5T0.3G. Funded Debt.
The funded debt of the District of Co
lumbia on June HO. 1S9S, was $10,013,920 IS.
No portion of It was incurred under the
present form of the municipal govern
ment. The Treasurer of the United
States, who is charged with Its manage
ment, reports It as follows:
Of the District of Columbia--Water
stock, mature October 1, 1901, $:529.000:
water stock, mature July 1, 1903. $14 000:
50-year funding, mature August 1. 1924,
$14,224,100; 20-year funding, mature Ju y
1, 1899. 5750,300. 10-year funding, mature
July 1, 1901. $149.5f).
Of the late Corporation of Washington
3-year (Emery), mature July 30, 1873,
$100: 30-year funding, mature November
1, 1902, $571,100.
Stocks and bonds outstanding on which
interest has ceased, there being funds for
the payment of the principal and interest
deposited In the United States Treasury
Corporation of Washington, 10-year
bonds, $150; corporation of Washington,
3 per cent gfneral stock, $1,340.01; corpora
tion of Washington. C per cent general
stock, $7b0.17; District of Columbia, per
manent improvement C per cent bonds,
$l,CO0; corporation of Washington, 20-ear
funding. G per cent bonds, $1,350; Dstiict
of Columbia. 10-year funding, 3.5) per
cent bonds. $G00.
The District has no floating debt that
Its revenues are not much more than suf
ficient to meet: but as the Commissioners
have no authority to make expenditures
without specific authority from Congress,
they are obliged to withhold payment of
certain current and emergent obligations
for which appropriations have not been
made. These are small, and are settled
from year to year.
Certificates of Indebtedness.
"The District is required to receive In
payment of special assessments or of ar
rears of general taxes, $11,175.03 of draw
back certificates which were issued as re
bates for overcharges or Interest on ac
count of special assessments levied by
former municipal governments; and is
lso under obligations to issue further
like drawback certificates for about $000.
"There was outstanding July 1, 1S9S, $3,
iCC.07 of liens against private property for
special improvements and secured by spe
cial assessments; and $1,343.48 of scrip
issued by the late corporation of the city
of Washington, and secured by special
assessments.
There was also outstanding S per
cent certificates issued under the legis
lative assembly, act of May 29, 1S73,
amounting to $300, with about $450 of ac
crued interest.
"The Treasurer of the United States
has recommended that all of said unpaid
assessments In his custody be transfer
red to the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia, and that the cash now in
his hands, derived from collections of
special assessments, but not needed to
pay outstanding S per cent certificates
of indebtedness, and the Interest be de
posited in the Treasury of the United
States as general revenues of said Dis
trict." The following statement of taxable
real estate and personal property In the
District is then given by the Commis
sioners ,
City Taxable on land, $S7,C97,49G; on im
provements, S71.SS2.423. County On land
at $1.50. $10,C95,711; on improvements at
$1.50, $7,161,500; on land at $1, $1,50S,G09; on
improvements at $1, $230,C00. Total as
sessed value of real estate, $1S3,13G,271.
With $13,431,475 worth of personal prop
erty, the total taxable property, real and
personal, is $196,587,S4G. The total tax on
real and personal property is $2,94G,143.21.
The rate of general tax for the year was
fixed at $1.50 on each $100 for all taxable
personal property and for all real prop
erty except that used solely for agricul
tural purposes, the rate of which was $1.00
per $100 of assessed valuation.
Estimates for the fiscal year 1SG9
amounted to $S,124,375.90, including $110,
2)51.71, payable out of the water funds.
Continuing, the report says:
"The popularity of the municipal bath
ing beach Is shown by the fact that dur
ing the past season its patronage was
very largely In excess of that of the sea
son of 1897. So long as a bathing beach
Is located at the present site it should
be made as safe and enjoyable as prac
ticable. Public Play Grounds.
"The Commissioners feelfthat the public
should provide play grounds "where youth
ful freedom of action is not only re
stricted by lack of available area for out
door games, but where the general safety
requires that such diversions be prohibited
on the streets.
"The spaces where pastimes in the open
air may be permitted are becoming fewer
and smaller, and the opportunities for the
municipality to acquire, without prohibi
tive cost, tracts sufficiently large for the
purpose, have practically passed-
"The reclaimed ground at Potomac
Park embraces locations readily adaptable
at moderate expense for public out-door
field diversions, while the basins, in addi
tion to bathing beach accommodation,
would admit of the establishment of pub
lic facllltlos for rowing and sailing under
munlclpaljregulatlon and surveillance.
StVeet CleaniiiKT.
"The cojptnlct for sprinkling, sweeping
and cleanjng of the streets and avenues of
tho District will expire on June 30, 1S99.
This contract!' was limited to "two years,
the Comniiss'foners believing that at tho
end of thjtt time they would be able to
demonstrate, to Congress the advisability
of abolishing! the contract system and
have the entire work of cleaning by day
labor under their direct control. The at
tention of Congress has been heretofore
Invited to the eminently satisfactory re
sults attained by the hand cleaning sys
tem here, and the advisability of substi
tuting it In lieu of the contract system
throughout the District. "
"After a four months' trial, beginning
July 1, the superintendent of street clean
ing reports that he has cleaned dally 30?,
512 square yards, or a total of 29,518,039
square yards of street paving, at a total
cost of $5,098.09, which is at the rate of a
trifle less than 19 1-5 cents per thousand
square yards. The contractor's price for
the samo kind of work Is 32 cents per
thousand square yards. The superintend
ent also states that during this year,
under the provision above quoted, the
District will sweep by the hand cleaning
method, at a cost of $15,000, an aiea equal
to that swept by the contractor at a cost
to the DIstr'ct of ?2G,2I2.S1. It should be
also stated In this connection that the
contractor pays his laborers on the hand
cleaning work $1 per day, while the Dis
trict has paid them for the same work
$1.23 per day. No -stronger argument In
favor of the abolition of tho present sys
tem of contract work could be made.
Under the hand cleaning system the
streets have been kept much cleaner and
more presentable during the busy hours of
the day; there are no clouds of dust swept
and thrown In the faces of pedestrians,
and no noisy, boisterous gangs of men or
rattling carts and sweeping machines In
the middle of the night. At the same
time, more of our worthy laboring men
are given employment and at better wages
under the hand cleaning than under the
machine cleaning method. Petitions and
requests of representative citizens for the
extension of the hand cleaning system
have been so numerous, and the results of
the operation of that system here have
been so highly satisfactory, that the
Commissioners are convinced that the
entire area of the improved streets and
avenues should be cleaned by hand labor
under direct municipal control without
the Intervention of a contractor.
Dlntriet .Mllltlu.
"The Commissioners reiterate the rec
ommendation in their last annual report
that the entire supervlslon-und control of
the militia be vested In the Secretary" of
War.
"Tho Commissioners are pleased with
tho influence which this organization has
had upon Ihe military history of the Dis
trict. The recent call lo arms in the con
flict between this country and Spain found
It well prepared to provide many trained
volunteers of all ranks for the regiment
which the District furnished to maintain
the national honor, nnd for other fields
of public duty. The soldierly bearing of
the District's representatives In the army
during every phase of their service. In the
camp, on the march. In the midt of pes
tilence, and hi, the. presence of the enemy,
is a matter of'natlonal repute and of jus
tifiable local pride.
Civil Service.
"The Commissioners renew their reccm
mendalion: that the District Government
be placed -within the purview of the civil
service laws. The reasons for such ac
tion, given in previous reports, still ap
ply with increased force.
Police Department.
Earnest efforts have been made to Im
prove the condition of this department,
so as to get the greatest advantage out
of the small number of men allowed the
District for the prevention of crime. The
old and feeble have been retired and their
places filled with active young men. All
the mounted men have been detailed to
the county, enabling the department to
give better attention to a large territory
hitherto unprotected.
"The bicycle squad has been Increased
from live to twenty. The' Introduction of
the bicycle has proved a very decided
benefit. They are now assigned to pre
cincts, and their duties prescribed by the
lieutenants. The department has no apol
ogies to make for the record of the past
year. It has done exceedingly well. Al
though unusual conditions have existed
In connection with the recent war, which
brought many criminals and cranks to
the city, the record is good, especially In
keeping down and apprehending criminals
of the higher grade.
"So much "has been said regarding the
inadequacy of thoforce in point of num
bers, and the fact has been so thoroughly
demonstrated, that it seems unnecessary
to say more. Strong efforts will be made
during the, coming session of Congress
to secure its enlargement to a point
which will be proper and in keeping with
the work to be done and the property
and territory to be guarded.
"Attention is more particularly invited
to the condition of the station houses.
Taken as a whole, the stations are very
far behind the modern stations of other
cities, and not at all what Washington
should have.
"As inadequate as these accommoda
tions are we can get along pretty well
without much change at presentThe cells
are absolutely Insecure and discreditable.
Made of brick, with old fashioned doors
and the crudest sanitary arrangements,
they are unsafe and unsightly, and should
be substituted at the earliest possible
date with the modern steel cell.
"The contingent fund should be en
larged to an amount sufficient to meet
necessary expenses without a deficiency
and a suitable amount provided for the
prevention and detection of crime. In
order to secure criminals rewards must
be offered and the traveling expenses of
detectives met, as well as other ex
penses incidental to such work. The de
partment has been hampered In securing
the arrest of criminals because of the
Inadequacy of the appropriation.
"The most important change would be
by far the erection of a central police
station. The station now occupied as the
headquarters of this precinct, located in
Twelfth Street between C and D Streets
northwest,, has been rendered almost un
fit for use by the erection of the clty
postofilce, which towers so far above it
as to completely darken the building. In
addition to this the cellar is always damp
owing to the fact that the sewerage is
above the floor, the water sometimes
rising so high as to put out the fire In
the furnace. It would be better if a
building could be erected which would be
complete and modern. It should be
located in the First Precinct, which con
tains most of the principal business
houses, hotels and banks. It should con
tain rooms for, office purposes, sleeping
accommodations for the men and police
matrons, and, cell rooms for the proper
detention of young girls, women and the
better class of prisoners. There should
be a swimming pool for the use of the
men, pistol practice galleries, appurte
nances for physical development and a
room in which instruction could be given
to new officers as to the proper perform
ance' of their duties.
"This building was not provided for in
the estimates submitted by the Commis
sioners In October, because the exact cost
could not then be obtained, but during the
coming session of Congress sketch plans
with detailed estimate of cost will be sub
mitted and an appropriation asked.
"In July the department suffered the
loss, by death, of William G. Moore, who
was for eleven years Its major and super
intendent. Affable and courteous in his
manners, with a kindly heart, full of sym
pathy with all In distress, he made for
-himself a host of friends. His loss was
sincerely felt by every man serving under
him, as well as by those whom he served.
"The vacancy occasioned by his death
was filled by the promotion of Richard
Sylvester, who was for eighteen years, the
chief clerk of the department, and who,
by his personal knowledge of its duties,
was thought to be well equipped for the
position.
"Attention Is called to the fact that the
offlcers.of the department are not proper
ly paid as compared with the amount of
work they are called upon to perform, or
the amounts paid by other localities. The
Commissioners Indorse the recommenda
tions of the major that these salaries be
Increased, that provision be made for desk
sergeants instead of station keepers, and
that the lieutenants be given their proper
titles of 'captains.'
"It is especially recommended that an
adequate salary be allowed for chief of
the detective bureau, in order that the
skill required may be more adequately
compensated, exceptional ability in this
line always finding employment at good
pay.
Fire Department.
"This department has maintained Its
high record for efllclency, preventing se
rious conflagrations by Its prompt and"
satisfactory service. A great deal might
be said relative to the necessity for its en
largement. At present there are only
fourteen engines, two chemicals, and fenr
trucks to protect the entire District, com
prising an area of seventy-two square
miles.
"As an Illustration of how Inadequate
ly the city is protected, attention is in
vited to the fact that south of East Cap
itol Street and an imaginary line coin
cident with It extending directly westto
the river front; from the Eastern Branch
to Rock Creek, including a part of the
territory known as Capiiol Hill; the
navy yard district; the property near the
Washington Barracks; the entire river
front of the Washington and Georgetown
channels; all the important and valuable
merchandise handled by the railroads
which have their termini In the Baltimore
and Potomac depot, the warehouse of
the Adams Express Company; dwe.llng
houses; the Government buildings, such
as the Smithsonian Institution, the Na
tional Museum, the Department of Agri
culture, the Medical Museum, etc, there
are only two engine companies, one lo
cated In North Carolina Avenue, between
Sixth and Seventh Streets northeast, the
other in Virginia Avenue, between Four-and-a-half
and Sixth Streets southwest.
The area embraced comprises five square
miles; the assessed value of tlie bul d
Ings, Intludhig Government property, in
$21,141,400; the estimated annual value of
freight and expressage, together with the
shipping Interests at the river front, is
$25,000,000, making a grand total of $49.
141,400. protected by the two companies
above mentioned, at an annual cost ot
less than twenty thousand dollars.
"The entire district known as George
town, including all the territory west of
Rock Creek, Is prqtected by only one en
gine. "In the rapidly developing portion of the
District known as Anacostia there is only
one engine, which has been placed there
within the last eighteen months. The en
tire number of engines distributed
throughout the District Is grotesquely in
adequate to meet Its needs.
"Last year the chief engineer requested
an addition to his department of six en
gines and four trucks. The Commission
ers, fearing that this number might not
be allowed, cut It clown to five companies,
every one of which was denied. They have
again urged the importance of enlarging
this branch of the service, and It Is hoped
that more liberal legislation will be en
acted. "A chemical engine should be provided
for the neighborhood of Tenleytown and
Cleveland Park. An additional engine
should be placed in the northern part of
Georgetown and a truck assigned to the
territory west of Rock Creek. South
Washington should have a truck and an
additional engine. An engine should be
located immediately west of the Executive
Mansion, between Pennsylvania Avenue,
the river and Rock Creek.
"Within the past four or five years a
number of high apartment houses have
been built In the vicinity "of Mount Pleasant-
and occupied by many families.
Should fire occur In one of the struc
tures, ladders would be indispensable.
The nearest truck to this point Is at the
intersection of New Hampshire Avenue
and M Street. From this point to Mount
Pleasant there Is a continuous steep up
grade. It will be seen, therefore, that the
necessity for the location of a truck in
this vicinity cannot be disputed.
"The Commissioners urge an Increase in
the salaries paid In this department, in
order that the firemen may be compen
sated in a measure commensurate with
their hazardous duties. It is hoped that
this recognition may be accorded them
in connection with the next annual ap
propriation. "It is proposed to erect a stable on
ground owned by the District, where all
the horses of the District Government
may be properly cared for In case of dis
ability, and an appropriation is request
ed for that purpose.
"During the year the attention of the
Commissioners was called to the large
number of alarms incorrectly struck on
the engine house gongs, often causing
serious delay in reaching fires. Investi
gation showed the present system of re
ceiving and transmitting alarms to be,
with very slight change, the same which
was Introduced in 1S73.
"On the strength of this fact $0,000 was
secured for the addition of a story to No.
14 engine house. located in Eighth Street,
between D and E Streets northwest, for
the accommodation of permanent fire
alarm headquarters, and the sum of $37,
500 was provided for the installation of
the most modern equipment known to
the service. Tlie building is about com
pleted. The cabinet work and furniture,
which have been especially designed, will
soon be in place, and it is believed that
the first of the year will see the new sys
tem successfully inaugurated.
AVeiRlits nnd Measures.
"A very noticeable improvement Is ob
served in the office of the sealer of
weights and measures. A little reflection
will demonstrate the importance of the
faithful administration of this office,
when it is considered how much depends
upon proper weight and measure, especi
ally with the poor, who buy in small
quantities.
Superintendent of Charities.
"The Commissioners have included in
their estimates an item in connection with
charities which it is believed is an Impor
tant step toward the solution of the vexed
question of appropriations to hospitals,
and the unsatisfactory treatment of pa
tients sent to them.
"It Is proposed that all appropriations
thus made shall be expended under con
tract between the Commissioners and
these institutions at the rate of so much
per annum for. each case. This will en
able the Commissioners to Insist upon
proper provision for urgent cases and will
insure their reception at the hospitals. It
has sometimes been the case in the past
that patients have been necessarily taken
from one hospital to another when in
urgent need ot treatment because they
have been refused admission, it being
alleged that there was nelthern-oom nor
preparation for the treatment of the
particular class of disease with which
they were afflicted.
Pulilie SeIiMls.
"At present many of the school build
ings have no more ground around them
than that occupied by their entrances.
This condition of affairs, k Is believed,
could be greatly improved, greatly to the
advantage of the general public and de
cidedly to the advantage of the scholars.
The buildings should also be made fire
proof and supplied with the latest and
most improved methods of heating and
ventilation.
"The plumbing in many of the schools
was fotd to be very defective, and in
some cassti unsanitary;
Pnbllc Vehicles.
"The Pennsylvania Railroad has Inaugu
rated a local cab system in connection
with Its passenger service gtcatly to the
benefit of the traveling public. The ve
hicles used are of the latest and most ap
proved style, provided with rubber tires
and la every way a credit to the company.
It is hoped that a similar Innovation will
be made at the other railroad, station and
that the movement will result In the gen
eral improvement of the cab and hack
service ot the city. At present many pub
lic vehicles are In ,uch a dilapidated con
dition as to provoke deserved criticism.
Kxciite'llonrd.
"During the year the exdse board has
pursued the policy of reducing as far as
possible the number of barroom licenses
and preventing the establishment of too
many barrooms In any one locality. The
total number of barroom licenses Is now
532, and the number of wholesale licenses
134. Existing legislation regarding the
sale of liquor is enforced, but "sew laws
are very much needed, especially one
which will prohibit the sale of beer on
Sunday by the breweries.
Ilnrlmr Maxter.
"The work of the harbor master, with the
patrol boat, has progressed satisfactorily.
The Commissioners earnestly recommend
favorable action on the estimate for new
machinery and the complete equipment
of this busy little craft, in order that the
many duties devolving upon It may be
properly performed. In this connection a
large amount of wharf property demands
protection, the Washington and George
town channels must be policed, dead bod
ies dragged for, the fish and game laws
enforced, and security afforded the nu
merous shipping Interest along the entire
river front.
"Attention is again invited to the neces
sity for the construction of a publie cre
matory to dispose of that class of Indi
gents who are now buried in the potter's
field. It is hoped that some provision can
be made in the near future for the estab
lishment of such service.

the health department of almost all of the j
authority which it was formerly supposed
to have under the act to prevent the
spread of scarlet fever and diphtheria.
Its work is now almost entirely education

Municipal Hiiildin.
"With the return of prosperity and with
a full treasury, it is hoped that the ob
jections heretofore made to granting an
appropriation for a municipal building
have at last been overcome, and that at
the coming session of Congress the pend
ing bill, or a modification of It, will re

settled, or are in a fair state of adjudica-
tion, so that the energies of all interested
may be centered on the accomplishment
of this worthy object with every assur
ance of success.
The Smoke Viilsanee.
"Attention Is Invited to the extensive
consumption of soft coal, which has so
rapidly increased that it promises at no
distant date to very seriously mar the
beauty of the city and destroy the plen.--ures
which enhance its value as a place
of residence. A bill providing the neces

the Prosecution.
Rockville, Mil., Dec. 5. The case of the
State vs. Guy C. Barron, charged with
the murder of Walter H. Keyworth. re
moved to this county from Prince George
County, upon the affidavits of Barron.
was called for trial thl3 morning, with
Chief Justice McSherry and Associate
Judges Jamei B. Henderson and John. C.
Motter on the bench.
The State is represented by State At
torney Beltis, of Prince George County,
State Attorney Kilgore, of this county,
and ,James C. Rogers, of Prince George
County. Senator J. S. C. Blackburn, Eel
ward C. Peter and Robert W. Wells are
counsel for the accused.
The room was crowded whea court
opened. Barron, In charge of Deputy
Sheriff Selby, entered the court room ear
ly. He Is a young man, of prepossessing
appearance and was neatly clad In a dark
blue suit. His appearance indicated, that
he felt the effects of his confinement in
jail since the unfortunate occurrence in
July last. He was self-possessed. hwev
er, and quietly respondea to the saluta
tions of. friends.
Barron's mother, brother and aunt
were seated near the prisoner. As Bar
ron had been arraigned in PriHce Georg
County the court Immediately proceeded
to the selection of a jury. The defense
demanded that the jurors be swan on
their voir dire and out of the regular
panei 0f twenty-four eight jurors were
accepted by the State and defease, the
latter using twelve of Hs twenty cha'
lenges and the State one. Three were
excused on account of conscientious scru
ples in regard to capital punishment.
The eight jurors selected from the
panel are: Reubln C. Riggs. Henry G
AVood. Daniel T. Shreave. William C.
Hoskinson, Julian E; Osborne, Gustavus
F. Cashell, Allen Freas. Frank M- Page.
The court Instructed the sheriff to sum
mon ten talfsn.ien. out of which number
t the panel was completed. The raea se
I Iected were Samuel E. Eastburn, X. H.
Robertson. John H. Hilton and T. M.
McCuIIough.
The jury Is composed of representative
farmerSr with the except' ef Mr. East-

burn, who is the Baltimore and Ohio agent
"" Mr- Hkinon, a merchant a.
Poolesville; John Hilton, a bhieksmitn.
and Thomas McCuIIough, proprietor of
one of the Rockville hotels.
The opening statement was raaIe by
State Attorney Kilgore, who explained the
four counts In the indictment and recited
the facts as follows: On tne aftenwon ot
the 6th of July last Guy Barron jeiaed in
a game of cards with Keyworth and oth
ers at Key worth's place in Btedensburr.
Barron was winning, in result of which
there was much abusive language from
Keyworth. After the game Edward Par
ker and Barron departed awl peeeded
to Mr. Penn's place in Bfculensbitrg- From
there it stems Barron went to the- sIoon
of Edward B. Garges ami procured a pis
tol from J. H. Johnson on Mr. Garges
order. He then returned to Pem"S. where
he rejoined Parker, and they proceeded to
gether down the street back to Kyworths
! barroom. Barron entered first. Parker
i
quest on the 13th eommfeied for trial
i upon the charge of murder. Th State
claimed that Barron's hunt for the pis
tol, obtaining it and returning to Key
worth's, together with the threats made
by Barron furnished every element to
constitute murder in the first degree. It
was also claimed that the State wou'd
prove that Barron exclaimad immediate
ly after the shooting: "I killed the
because he insulted me and I wl hang
for him.'
The defense reserved its opening state
ment. What the line of defense will i e
has not developed, but it is generally
supposed that It will be self-defense.
Dr. G. A. Richardson was the first wit
ness called. He attended Keyworth in his
lat illness and was called in a half hour
after Keyworth was shot. He described
! the wound which penet:
penetrated the back and
passed through the body coming out di
rectly opposite on the chest. Keyworth's
death was caused by inllamation, the re
sult of the wound. He attended Key
worth very frequently and there were no
concurrent troubles. Keyworth was
treated for gunshot wounds and nothing
else- The wound in the back was an inch
and a half higher than the one in the
chest. The treatment was then described.
The wounds were dressed antiseptlcally.
Dr. Ford Thompson. Dr. Charles Wells.
Dr. Carr and Dr. Barnes saw the patient.
On cross-examination the witness said
that as no post-mortem was made he
could not say whether the ball had touch
ed a vital spot; that until the third day he
thought the patient would recover.
Philip Clark was the next witness. He
produced a number of photographs of the
scene ot the killing.
There are seventy witnesses in the ease,
and It Is thought the trial will consume
four days.
