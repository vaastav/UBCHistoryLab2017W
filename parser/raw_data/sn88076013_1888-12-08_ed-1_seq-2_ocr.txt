But Sees Cause for Sombre Forebod

Capital and Labor.
A Short Synopsis of President Cleve
land's Annual Message to
Congress.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.—The president's
message was delivered to congress
shortly after that body reassembled for
the afternoon. In introduction ho calls
attention to the fact that with the ex
piration of this session the first century
of the congress as a constitutional body
expires. Although law and liberty has
survived the lirst 100 years of its exist
ence, this is not sufficient to assure us
that we have no longer dangers to
fear in the maintenance, with all its
provisional blessings, of a government
founded upon the freedom of the peo
ple. The times rather admonishes us to
soberly ini|uire whether before us the wav
is plain and clear and leads to happiness
and prosperity.
We view with pride and satisfaction
the bright picture of our country's
growth and prosperity while only a close
scrutiny develops a somber shading.
I poll careful inspection we find the
wealth and luxury of our cities mingled
with poverty and wretchedness and nn
reinunerative toil.
rI
lie gulf between employers and em
ployed is constantly widening and
classes are rapidly forming, one com
prising the rich and powerful while in
another are found the toiling poor.
.Our fanners cannot but see the falla
cies that they must accept prices for
their produce fixed in foreign markets.
Their lands are declining iu value and
their debts increasing and without com
pensating favor they are forced to pay
for the benefit of others the enhanced
prices caused by the protective tariff.
A just and sensible revision of the tariff
laws should be made.
The arguments of his former message
in favor of a reduction of the revenue
are reiterated and enlarged upon in sev
eral points.
ITUMC l.ANfl LAWS.
Keconinicndatioiis are submitted for
the amendment of the laws relating to
public lands, preventing their use for
other purposes than for homes for honest
settlers.
rI
he propriety of the erection of more
federal prisons is depicted.
A revision of
TIIR l'KNSION l.AWS
which would rest on more just princi
ples is suggested and the passage of pri
vate pension bills is deplored.
lie announces that llie close of the
year finds the government in the enjoy
ment of domestic tranipiilitv and peace
with all nations. The fact thai the fish
eries troubles are not yet settled is de
plored and attention" is called to the
message sent to congress in September
last, asking for fuller powers of retalia
tion.
The conduct of l,ord Sackville and the
demand for his recall is recited.
Attention is called to the necessity of
an accurate survey of the boundary be
tween Alaska and British America.'
The rejection of the Chinese treaty by
that country is mentioned and a consul
ship recommended for Corea.
The overthrow of the Haytien govern
ment and the complications arising
from the
KKIZCItF. OF AMRKICAN VKSSHLH
is fully recorded.
In regard to
1'oltKIGN RELATIONS
lie says: In the vast field of oriental
commerce now unfolded from our Pa
cific borders no feature presents stronger
recommendations for congressional ac
tion than the establishment of commu
nication by submarine telegraph witii
Honolulu.
The long pending boundary dispute be
tween Costa Hica and Nicaragua was re
ferred to my arbitration, and bv ail
award made on flu '.'.'d of March' last
the ((Uestion has iieen finally settled to
the expressed .satisfaction of both parties
in interest.
The emperor of Urazil, in abolishing
the last vestige of slavery among Chris
tian nations, called forth the earnest con
gratulations of this government in ex
pressions of the cordial sympathies of
our people. The claims of nearly all
other countries against Chili, growing
out of the late war with Bolivia and
Peru, have been disposed of either by
arbitration or by a lump settlement.
Similar claims of our citizens will con
tinue to be urged upon the Chilian gov
ernment, and. it is hoped, will not be
subject to further delay.
The president announces an advanta
geous treaty of amity with Peru, and
the satisfactory settlement of claims of
American citizens against Kipiador and
Denmarck and Hayti by arbitration, and
the extension of time for the ratification
of a treaty for a rehearing ot claims
against enezuela. He advises recipro
cal,commerce treaties with south and
central American countries and with
San Domingo and Hayti.
The wisdom of concluding a treaty of
commercial reciprocity with Mexico'has
been heretofore stated in mv messages
to congress, and the lapse of time and
growth of commerce with that close
neighbor and sister remiblic confirm the
judgment so expressed.
ItKVlSION OF Till: NATURALIZATION LAWS.
With the rapid increase of immigra
tion to our shores and the facilities of
modern travel, abuses of the generous
privileges afforded by our naturalization
laws call for their careful revision. In
ternational complications of a serious
nature arise, ami the correspondence of
the state department disclost's the great
number and complexity of the questions
which have been raised.
THE FINANCES
of the government are summarized from
the reports of the various heads of de
partments. In regard to the silver cur
rency he says: "The secretary recom
mends the suspension of the further
coinage of silver, and iu such recom
mendation 1 earnestly concur."
Reports of the secretaries of war
and the navv, of the post
master general, of the department
of justice and of the secretary of the in
terior are given and concurred in. He
commends also the recommendations
that appropriate measures be taken to
complete the adjustment of the various
grants made to the states for internal
improvements, and of swamp and over
flowed lands as well as to adjudicate and
finally determine the validity and ex
tent of the numerous
private land claims.
Ue also concurs in the suggestion of
the secretary regarding the Turtle moun
tain Indians, the two reservations in
California and the Crees. They should,
in his opinion, receive immediate at
tention.
THE PENSION* LIST.
The number of pensioners added to the
list during the liseal year ended June
30. ltfSf. is 60,'J52 and increase of pen
sions was granted in 43.716 cases. The
names of 15,730 pensioners were dropped
from the rolls during the year for vari
ous causes and, al the close of the year,
the number of persons of all classes re
ceiving pensions was 43^,337.
The message concludes as follows:
As public servants we shall do our
duty well if we constantly guard the
rectitude of our intentions, maintain un
sullied our love of our country, and with
unseltish purpose strive for "the public
good.

the proposed new state.
Third—That the fiftieth congress
should provide for the admission of

gress fails to provide for the admission
of North Dakota as a state, we earnestly
request the president-elect to call a spe
cial session of the Fifty-first congress for
that purpose.
Fifth—That the F.ighteenth legislative
assembly of Dakota territory is urged to
provide, at the earliest practicable mo
ment after its meeting in January. 1 ssil,

FARMERS ARE PROSPEROUS.
Stal 1st ii-lan Hod^e Shows Tluit Mort
gages in tl"' West Are Disappearing
Kapiilly.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—Statistician
Dodge, of the agricultural department,
writes to a local paper protesting against
the exaggerated statements which are
made about farm mortgages in the West.
He says these loose assertions are unjust
to the agricultural classes. Two years
ago an extensive investigation of the
subject was made, and it showed a de
crease of farm indebtedness during a pe
riod of ten years. In his letter the sta
tistician says: "There has been alto
gether t«o much misrepresentation of
farm indebtedness. Farmers of the
South. West and East, averaging In
states. are in a better financial position
than they were ten years ago. Nobodv
will deny this, unless he has a crankish
theory to sustain by sweeping assertion.''
COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE.
Said by tlic New York I'ress.
NKW \OKK, Dec. 5,—The Sun savs of
the president's message: "I am right
and flic country is wrong." It is an aim
less and iiicoiibenuential document.
The Press says it is the effort of a shal
low demagogue to create ill feeling be
tween classes.
The Tribune says it is an attempt to
stir up anarchy by pandering to igno
ranee and passion.
The Herals says that Mr. Cleveland's
remarks are sensible and well put, but
his is the voice of one crying in the wil
derness. The people have' elected a party
which favors monopolistic combination
and tliev do not care enough about the
evil effects of tin.1 system to change it.
The Times thinks the president has
somewhat overstated the case, but the
message contains an amount of undeni
able truth to which the country will be
compelled to give attention.
The World says the message is a dig
nified. clear, compact and forcible state
paper. It issued three years ago and
followed in 181(1 by last year's tariff
message, not even the power of money
nor the personal disaffection in the party
could have prevented Democratic suc
cess this year.
English Opinion.
LONDON, De(*. .1.—The Post, comment
ing 011 President's Cleveland's message,
says that if the Americans are reallv in
clined to resume negotiations with a view
to a settlement of the Canadian fisheries
question, they will find the F.nglish min
isters willing to meet them.
The Chronicle thinks that Mr. Cleve
land uses strong, but nevertheless true,
language 011 the subject of protection.
The Standard says the message could
have been more dignified if Mr. Cleve
land had effaced from the record of the
recent election his unsuccessful coup
(meaning the Sackville incident!.
The Daily News says: "We wouid re
gret President Cleveland's acrimony with
reference to the Sackville incident much
more if it were not for the fact that
Lord Salisbury set the example. Mr.
Cleveland evidently-possesses Salisbury's
bitterness of tongue', bftt otherwise (lis
message is a great document."
TLIC Moiit DISCUSSCMI rttrngraph.
LONDON, Dec. 5. President Cleve
land message to congress is still a
prominent subject of discussion, com
ment anil criticism, both in and out of
political circles. The paragraph begin
ning: "As we view- the achievements of
aggregated capital," etc.. attracts the
most attention, and is r*?garded as an en
tirely new departure in the composition
and scope of a state document, the sig
nificance of which it would be impossible
to exaggerate.
MILLERS TO MEET.
