Tho Advance of the Allies
THAT forward movement of the allies ex
pected a week ago seems to have been
begun. Russian successes in the east have
made it necessary for some of the army corps
defending the long German line in the west
to be shifted to Poland, and these reinforce
ments account, it is probable, for General
von liindenburg's dramatic counterattack and
the fall or investment of Lodz.
Shortly before the British army in Bel
gium and Northern France had been strength
ened substantially, and the French had
brought up new levies. Now, apparently,
there Is an advance in many parts of the al
lied line. One of its most important" pur
poses, it may be assumed, 1b to push the Ger
mans back across their own frontier, or, if
that be not feasible, to drive them as far as
may be from French soil. Just now the Ger
mans are living in part on their enemies, and
that is conducive among the allies neither to
economic efflclenc3' nor to military morale.
Following a Good Example
DECISION by the faculty of the University
of Virginia that the university football
eleven hereafter shall not play on any save
ite own home grounds or those of Its oppon
ent?a general rule to which the annual Vlr
gjnla-North Carolina game in Richmond is
uiBde the only exception?merely emulates
the example of other large institutions oC
learning throughout the country.
The purpose, of course, is to divest the
game, so far as is possible, of the commercial
spirit and increase its measure of true sports
manship. Football, in the view of the fac
ulty, is becoming much too large a part of
college life?of the life not alone of members
of the eleven, but of the body of the students
as well.
Reform in such a case is an excellent thing.
Football furnishes a spectacle that stirs the
blood, and jt i$?comforting to Virginian pride
to see the university excel In the sport, but,
after all, It scarcely embodies quite so much
of the purpose for which a boy is sent to
college as some of us once thought it did.
Yale, Harvard, all the great institutions
of the North and East, play their games with
their rivals on college gridirons and diamonds.
Virginia does well, in this matter at any
rate, to follow in their footsteps.
New Ground of Marriage Annulment
NNULMENT by a Now York judge of tne
/A marriage bond in a case where the
man had concealed froin the woman, before
the performance of the ceremony, the fact
that he was a victim of tuberculosis, estab
lishes a new precedent and a sweeping one.
It may he doubted that it will be followed
widely, in the present state of public and
legal opinion, but much cau be saiil for its
essential sanity aiW sound policy.
Marriage Is a triangular contract, to which
the state is the third party. The law con
ceives that the state has a special and pecu
liar Interest in the marriage relation, on
the ground that it is one of the institutions
on which the modern stato is established.
? Insanity at the time of marriage is a ground
of annulment, and for a double reason. In
the first place, a person not in possession of
his faculties cannot enter into a valid con
tract, and in the second the state regards the
possible consequence of insane offspring.
jft was by analogy to the latter considera
tion, combined with the question of conceal
ment, that the New York Judge reached Ins
decision. He said:
It Is for the court, in the exercise of
Bound discretion and with regurd to
public policy because of the peculiar
nature of the contract, to determine
whether or not the misrepresentation of
fact and the probable consequences to
he expected are of sufficient importance
to cause the court to exercise its power
to dissolve the contract in the Interests
of the parties and of the public at large.
t do not think it should be the policy of
the court to sustain the obligation of a
union which would entail the burdens
and dangers that would follow under the
circumstances. This includes the danger
of transmission and heredity that even
science cannot fathom or certainly define.
ThlB is merely a backward application of
the theory and policy of eugenics. Without
going to the lengths that some of the more
egrde&t followers of this new science would
carry ub, it doeB seem that tho stato, con
stantly professing Its interest in marriage,
might well display a llttlo more concern for
those who apply for leave to contract it.
When two young persons determine to get
married, as many of them do, with the samo
casual regard for tho presont and outlook
on the future as usually accompany the pur
chase of half a pound of tea, some Btato of
ficial should be on hand to supply their in
tellectual deficiencies.
Tho President's Messuge
PRESIDENT WILSON'S message to the
Congress, which he delivered in person
yesterday before the Senate and House of
Representatives, is an eloquent and uoble ex
pression of his country's sentiment, and as
piration. No loyal American can read its
measured and stately periods without a thrill
of Just pride that, of the land he ,loves, so
much in the best senso inspiring can be
truly said.
The message is a rebuke to mad jingo and
impracticable pacificist alike. "Dread of tho
power of any other nation," says the Presi
dent, "we are incapable of. We are not
jealous of rivalry in the fields of commerce
or of any other peaceful achievement. We
mean to live our own lives as we will; but
we mean also to let live. We are, indeed, a
true friend to all the nations of the world,
because we threaten none, covet the posses
sions of none, desire the overthrow of none.
Our friendship can be accepted, and is ac
cepted, without reservation, because it is of
fered in a spirit and for a purpose which no
one need ever question or suspect. Therein
lies our greatness."
No spokesman of American Ideals has given
them finer expression. In this paragraph Mr.
Wilson sums up the true foreign and mili
tary policy of a government erected on a
foundation of liberty and equality. We fear
none; we would be friends with all. We con
template no aggression, and to defend our
selves against attackt as the President says in
another place, we have always found means
"without calling our people away from their
necessary tasks to render compulsory mili
tary service in times of peace."
Mr. Wilson believes in a Btrong navy, and
that our standing army should be kept in
the highest condition of preparedness and ef
ficiency. He believes in making military
training attractive, so that as many young
Americans as possible may receive its benefits
and be equipped to impart its lessons to
others. All this, he says, the fathers taught;
it inheres in the very origin and in all the
history of our national structure.
He is unmoved by the jingoes' perfervid
propaganda?content that they, like the
heathen, shall "rage and imagine vain
things." So is the great body of the people.
The President urges forcefully the adop
tion of the measures now pending for the in
crease of the merchant marine and for the
establishment of a sane and helpful policy
of conservation. He speaks in behalf of the
bill conferring a larger degree of self-govern
ment on the people of the Philippines. He
pleads that provision be made for the survey
and charting of our coasts, especially that of
Alaska. He bespeaks approval by the Senate
of ,the international convention for assuring
safety at sea. He insists on a wise economy,
as contrasted with a foolish ahd stupid parsi
mony, in the conduct of government.
Surely partisanship should not cavil nor
carking envy bark and snarl at a legislative
program so inspired. It -is too much to hope,
probably, that Senator Lodge, or- Representa
tive Gardner, or any of the other fire-eaters,
will be satisfied with the President's pre
paredness policy, or that Colonel Roosevelt
will be pleased by anything he says, but tho
nation as a whole will feel differently. It
will recognize In this message, again to use
the President's words, "some of the great con
ceptions and desires which gave birth to tills
government, and which have made the voice
of this people a voice of peace and hope and
liberty among the peoples of the world."
Conservation of Good Citizenship
WHILE there has been a gratifying re
sponse to the nppeal The Times-Dis
patch has made in behalf of the unemploy
ment fund of the Associated Charites, there
is an enormous discrepancy yet between the
neea and the means to meet it. Richmond
nr.ust give even more generously, must invest
more largely in this enterprise, which is con
structive in the highest sense.
Articles on the business situation which
The Times-Dispatch printed yesterday showf-d
that a day of larger prosperity was beginning
to dawn. Everywhere there Is a lightening
of the financial skies, and the glow in thf?
east nowhere is more apparent than it is in
Richmond. But such business changes take
time. A nation does not recover from a
slump in a day or a week, or even in a month.
Necessarily and in tho nature of things a
healthy readjustment must be gradual.
Meantime, we have here a degree of un
employment at least twice the normal for
this season of the year, when normal unem
ployment reaches its peak. Included among
the sufferers are the heads of many families
?not paupers or beggars, but honest, decent,
hard-working folk, to whom their present
situation is a spiritual as well as an economic
tragedy.
What is Richmond going to do with these
men and those who look to them for food and
clothing? Will Richmond permit them to
sink into a condition of permanent depend
ence? Will it allow them to want the com
mon necessities of existence? Will Rich
! mond men and women, whoso own lives are
I comfortable and happy, stand idly by while
any such ghastly drama is played to its bitter
: end? The Times-Dispatch thinks not.
There, if you please, is the charity side,
i the humane side, of this proposition, but
there is another. It is a matter of business.
A city's chief asset is its citizenship, and that
includes the mechanic and the day laborer, as
well as the professional man, the banker and
| the merchant. A segment of that citizenship
1 is threatened?beaten to Its knees by a finan
j cial storm. There is an efTort to conserve it
. -?to raise and straighten the serried ranks,
i to hold these, men in line, so that when this
> period of stress Is over Richmond's indus
trial army may be intact, productive, useful
| to itself and to the whole community.
That is true conservation of the best and
; most valuable of all natural resources.
Doesn't it merit your sympathy and help?
The supersensitive business man ought to
be reassured by the President's statement that
there will be no more regulatory legislation.
| Those who have suffered from the psychology
of fright may now take their courage in their
hands and get to work.
With $30,000 in additional money to spend
for clean streets, Richmond should look so
much like Spotless Town that the oldest in
, habitant will hardly recognize it. j

Chats With Virginia Editors
The nomination of Editor Alfred B. Williams,
of the Roanoke Times, for the office of field sec
retary of the Anti-Saloon League of Virginia Is
seconded by Editor Wise Worrell, of the Rad
ford Record, who moves to close the nomina
tions and proceed with the balloting. He In
timates his belief that, with Colonel Williams In
the Rev. J. D. McAlister's shoes and the prohibi
tion law in effect, the Desert of Sahara will
look like the Father of Waters in floodtlme
compared with Virginia.
The Abingdon Virginian strenuously opposes
the proposed removal from that town of ItH
seat of learning, saying: "Several towns are
Working to secure the removal of Stonewall
Jackson College. They offer land, money,
buildings, patronago. Will we permit them
to succeed in taking Stonewall Jackson Col
lege away from Abingdon? Not In a thousand
years." If the Virginian can hold the ques
tion deadlocked that long, tho Philistine op
position will have ceased troubling ~and the
weary will get a rest.
"The stores of Norfolk arc ablaze with beau
tiful Christmas things," tho pert paragrapher
of the Ledger-Dispatch announces?not as a
call to the Are department, but as an admoni
tion to shop early before the beautiful things
are consumed.
Explaining the tardy movement of tobacco
to the market, the Page News and Courier
says; "Many merchants failed to pay the to
bacco tax required by the emergency revenue
bill prior to December 1, and, under the terms
of the law, are subject to a penalty of 50 per
cent of the tax for so doing." The penalty does
not apply to the consumer. lie will continue
to pay as he chews.
"Andrew Carnegie moves to the front of tho
stage to remark that the astronomers have dis
covered 172 new worlds," the Norfolk Vlrgln
lan-Pilot observes. And they have telescopes
that give ocular evidence to small extent to
their finds, something more concrete than
Lieutenant Peary and Doc Cook have to offer.
The envy of Editor Lacy, of the Halifax Ga
zette, is stirred. He says: "The editor of the
Chatham Enterprise has a cinch. He doesn't
have to bother about writing half a dozen
heads for his front page every week. There
aren't any heads." But be of good cheer! Tho
talc with the head Is much more attractive to
everybody.
Current Editorial Comment
Because Mr. Wilson did not
. _ _ . , recognize Huerta, the President's
Jlooseveit s administration and official hands
Attack o.n are stained with all the righteous
the President blood and all the religious out
rages that have oceurced during
the course or the revolution, says Mr. Roose
velt. He might as well say that because George
Washington did not recognize. George III., he
is responsible for every evil thing that has since
happened in the history of this country. Blood
shed and atrocity of one kind or another have
been the almost daily feature of Mexican govern
ment long before Huerta, Villa or Gnrranza was
born. It would not be difficult to collect thou
sands of affidavits of the kind that Mr. Roose
velt makes public. Mexico's government has
been based upon crime for generations, and an
administration which drew its life from an
assassin's dagger naturally bred murder and
outrage in others. Huerta, not Wilson, la the
man who should be blamed. His overturning
of a constitutional government, which promised
safety and protection to all classes of people,
opened the doors to all that has followed. But,
strange to say, Mr. Roosevelt pleads the cnuso
of the assassin and the real author of all these
recent woes, and seeks to hold up to obloquy the
man who has tried with all his strength and
patience to exorcise the evil spirit which has so
long dominated Mexico. We hope Mr. Kooscvelt
will throw out the devil of envy from his own
heart. His political fortunes have split on the
Wilson rock, but wo would like to see him show
himself too great to let that circumstance affect
him.?Baltimore Evening Sun.

War News Fifty Years Ago
(From the Richmond Dispatch, Dec. 9,1SG4.)
There comes a report that up to night before
last General Grant had been reinforced by two
corps from the Valley, believed to be the Fifth
and Sixth Corps of the United States Army, and
It was confidently expected that, having ro
celvcd these reinforcements, he would have pro
ceeded on yesterday to mako an attack, but
such' an attack did not materialize, although the
Confederate forces wero Just ready for it.
There Is a. great scarcity of official Informa
tion from the War Department of the Confed
erate government, but if a semiofficial report
that comes to us through a gentleman Just from
the Petersburg front proves to be correct, a
big brttle may be expected at any momenta
This gentleman reports that the enemy has
thrown a force across the James River from the
north to the south side and effected a landing
between Fort Howlett and Drewry's Bluff.
There is no official Information either to affirm
or to contradict this statement, but on the face
of It there is much plausibility, and it seems to
mean a big fight within the next two days.
During the most of yesterday the sound of
cannon reached the ears of all of the citizens
of Richmond, but It turned out that the firing
was nothing more than the shelling of Butler's
Dutch Gap by the Confederate batteries on the
south side of the James River.
With the exception of some rather vigorous
cannonading on the lines just immediately south
of the Appomattox River, nothing of interest
occurred on the Petersburg front yesterday.
Governor Brown, of Georgia, who has con
stituted himself the commander-in-chief of all j
of the Georgia forces to oppose Sherman, has !
established his headquarters at Macon, which !
good town Is clear of Yankees. From there the
Governor has Issued a vigorous proclamation
; which proves that lie is not afraid of Sherman
| and his cohorts.
I Judge Holt declined Lincoln's profter of the
attorney-generalship of the United States, and
James Speed, a renegade from Kentucky, has
been offered the place. It remains to be seen
If he gets there with the consent of the United
States Senate.
"During a recent printers' strike In Boston,"
says the Boston Transcript, a copy of which has
gotten through the lines, "the venerable Na
thaniel Willis, who began to set type In 1790,
and who published a paper In Richmond, Va.,
sixty-odd years ago, called at the Transcript
ollice and offered his services. The same were
accepted, and the old man Is at the case and
doing mighty fine work."
The House of Delegates of the Virginia Gen
eral Assembly was called to order yesterday
morning by Speaker Itugh G. RhefTey. The dis
gusted Speaker was sure, after overlooking the
House, that a quorum was not present, but, all
the same, he called for the reading of the Gov
ernor's message requiring the extraordinary
session of the House. The same was read by
the clerk, and then there was a roll call of the
members, which showed that considerably less
than a quorum was present. The House then
took a recess to await the coming of delayed
delegates. They may all get there In time to
draw their per diem. Yea, doubtless.

To the Editor of The Times-Dispatch:
Sir,?Now that bad weather has set In, and
as Broad Street, west of Allison Street, Is In a
shape any small town or hamlet should be
ashamed of, citizens of the West End must
allow the Virginia Railway and Power Company
to stop its cars In such a manner as to make
us walk half a city block to the rear entrance
of the car, and then fun chances of being left
by his majesty, the conductor or motorman.
In a recent issue of one of our daily papers,
I noticed where our Mayor had Issued instruc
tions or requested the company to notify Its
niotormen and conductors that when streets
were torn up or In had condition that they
should stop nil cars where the passengers could
get on and off without sinking In mud up to
their shoetops, as well as risking their limbs
and lives.
Now is the time for all citizens to think about
the new franchise the company is asking. The
near-side stop ordinance Is In effect, but the
company litis failed to adopt the nejir-slde equip
ment that is so necessary to make this ordi
nance run smoothly and successfully.
Now that our city government lias given the
company this ordinance, let the citizens of Rich
mond get the city mako the company so fix Its
cars that there will' be near-side entrances as
well as exits, or else instruct Its motormen and
conductors to use a little common sense And
stop the rear of their cars on the crossings of
unpaved streets in this section, or any other
section, of our city.

Pittsburgh District.
| The situation In the Pittsburgh dis
trict. as tolil by the People's National
Hank, of that city, follows:
i "The actunl ntute of trade In this
j district was Indicated this week in two
oflltilal statements which are accopted
as fairly accurate gauges of volume.
The first was tho clearing-house re
I port. The exchanges for November
i were $191,060,000, a decrease of 15 pfcr
cent compared with the same month
a y6ar ago, and 18 per cent compared
i with November, 1912.
I "The other was the statement for
October of the Philadelphia Company
system, which virtually operates nli
the lighting, natural-gus-heatlng and
traction utilities of the city. With tho
exception of an increase of only 1290
In gross earnings of the Pittsburgh
Hallways system, all the other utilities
showed decreases la gross earnings,
the aggregate loss being about >95,000.
| "A part of the decreaso in gross earn
ings of the natural Ran and oil corn
panics was duo to the mild weather,
which reduced consumption of natural
gas. and part of thu decrease was due,
to thu lower price of crude oil, which
i Is now quoted at $1.45 a barrel for
the Pennsylvania grade, against $2 at
this time a year ago.
"However, a part of the decrease in
exchanges as well as in earnings of
the public utilities is due to the con
tinued depression In tho chief indus
tries, which has forced economies by
consumers employed on reduced lime.
"The steel trade is looking a little
better. There lias been better buying
of pig Iron, Induced by the low price
and by the feeling that Increased de
mand after the turn of the year will
appear for finished steel; hence makers
nre anticipating their probable needs
for pig Iron. Some inquiry for products
other than war supplies are reported
in the market from foreign consumers,
but the demand from domestic con
sumers, and particularly from th*?rall
roads, remains extremely light."

President John McHugh, of the First
National Bank of Sioux City, Iowa,
says there has been considerable Im
provenieiit noted in the business and
financial tone of things in that Vicinity
during the Ins.t week. His letter says:
"While the movement of corn to
market is fully twenty days behind
that of last year, It Is now moving
quite freely, with every prospect of a
continuance of a free market movement
from now on. There is fully 30 per
cent of the wheat and 55 per cent of
the oat crops in the country at the
present time, ail of which will prob
ably find its way to market In due
seasoh.
"The railroads report much better
business, and the Jobbers in this sec
tion state that collections are Improv
ing, and altogether business Is much
Improved.
"With continued Improvement I con
fidently look forward to much Activity
during the winter, and I believe there
will be a great many improvements
that will make for the employment of
labor in the way of building find new
enterprises during tho coming year.
Many plans are being made along these
linos, and the hesitancy noted In the
early days of the European war Is
gradually changing to one of plans for
greater activity In the future."
Mr. Loo's Hello Girls
Those who knew Ban Francisco's
| Chinatown before the fire declare that
Its charm is gone, but my companion
land I found interest in Its shops, It.-:
printing offices, and, most of all. in
its telephone exchange, says Jul!::u
! Street, in Collier's Weekly.
The San Francisco Telephone Dire.
tor.^ has a section devoted to Chi.?.
| town, in which the names of Chin- r ?
subscribers are printed in both En^iiir'.i
I and Chinese characters.
i The operators are, of course. Chlln : ?
I girls, and the exchange, which hij.i
over 1,0.10 subscribers, representing
about a tenth of the population of tho
Chjjiese district, is under the manage
ment of Mr. Ix>o Kurn Shu, who was
born In California and educated at tho
University of California. His assistant,
Mr. Chin Sing, Is also a native of the
State, and is a graduate of the San
Francisco public schools.
For a "soulless corporation." tho Pa
cific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany has shown a good deal of imagi
nation In constructing and equipping
Its Chinatown exchange. The btilld*
itig, with its gaily-decorated pagoda
foof and balconies, makes a colorful
spot In the centre of Chinatown, in
side it is elaborately frescoed with
dragons and other Chinese designs,
while, tho woodwork Is of ebony and
gold. The switchboard is carved and set
in a shrinis, and tills fascinating In
congruity, with the operators all
dressed In the richly-colored silk cos
tumes of their ancient civilization,
poking in plugs, pulling them out,
chattering now in English, now In
Chinese, teaches one that anachronism
may, under some conditions, be alto
gether charming.
