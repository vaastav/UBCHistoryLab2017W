'GOING FOR" THE SUGAR TRUST.
Approximately 130 suits have been
filed by Louisiana sugar producers in
the United States district court at
New Orleans against the American
Sugar Refining Company, claiming
damages aggregating over $100,000,
000 for alleged, violations of the an
ti-trust law.
The allegations are practically
identical in all the petitions and are
based on the general presumption and
belief that the defendant company,
commonly known as "the sugar
trust," deliberately and unlawfully
conspired to depress the price of su
gar and succeeded in compelling the
plaintiffs to sell their crops for sev
eral seasons at less than the real
market values.
Among the numerous plaintiffs are
several from this parish, including
the Lemann Company, Meyer Lem
ann and others, Geo. B. Reuss, and
the Belle Helene Planting and Manu
facturing Company, whose claims
foot up over $5,000,000.
All parts of the sugar-producing re
gion of the state are represented in
this litigation, the progress of which
.wvil be watched with general and
absorbing interest.
AN EXPOSITION OF BIG IDEAS.
A red-hot campaign is being waged
in New Orleans to raise a fund of
$5,000,000 for the purpose of conduct
ing an Exposition of Big Ideas next
year, commemorative of the comple
tion of the Panama canal and illus
trative of the resources, products and
advantages of New Orleans, Louisi
ana and the Mississippi valley gen
erally.
This movement is under the direc
tion of Herbert Kaufman, a genius
in the line of promoting civic pride
and effort, and he is backed by a
combination representing all the
city's commercial and civic organiza
tions and the most prominent citi
zens in all branches of business.
No similar enterprise has ever
been attempted on such an extensive
and systematic scale in New Orle
ans, and if it is successful in the
matter of raising the required fund,
the city will indeed have demonstrat
'2d its right to be the site of an lx
position of Big Ideas.
A CRISIS TI-HAT CALLS FOR REL
BLOOD AND BACKBONE.
'This community is now' passing
through the most trying period of
its existence. Not since the great
ci4il war ravaged our land half a
century ago, have men's souls been
so sorely tried. A succession of
disasters which has already left ruin
and suffering in their wake, has
now culminated in a calamity that
has shaken to its foundation man's
Laith in man.
It is no time, howt.ver, to despond
or despair., Out. of tile crucible of
adversity must emerge a chastened
but stronger manhood. Never was
there such need to get together and
strive shoulder to shoulder for the
rehabilitation of our community.
Now is the time to prove the stuff
we are made of, whether we are real
men; or weaklings. There is much
to do; much that can be accomplish
ed. Above all, the promised locks at
the head of Bayou Lafourche CIA
and MUST be secured.
In this matter we are not only
sleeping on our rights, but we are
forgetdful of our plain duty to our
community and to our children whoi
follow us. Let us but make up our
minds to hammer on this subject day
'nd night and never rest until we
ihave had justice done, and we can
notl fail of success. Only let the
men higher up understand that we
are now, dead in earnest, and they
will no longer shirk their legal and
bounden duty.
'flhe success of our first inter-par
ish fair taught us what harmonious
and energetic action will accomplish.
If we brace 'a and carry the same
determined s rit into our efforts to
-seckire th4 locks and other things
wJhich we need and can get and i
MUST get if we expect to press for- !
ward, our present misfortunes will
soon be but memories of the past f
A PROPER CASE FOR SUSPEN
SION OF PUBLIC JUDGMENT.
It is a matter for deep regret that
the failure of the Bank of Donaldson
villc, besides entailing heavy loss to
the depositors and stockholders and
inflicting much injury upon the busi
ness and credit of the community at
large, has furnished sufficient basis
in the judgment of the state bank
-on-!lhinler for a criminal lpr.secution
of the presid.nt, vice president, cash
ier and four members of the ruined
beanks board of directors.
in justice to all concerned, how
ever, the facts should be borne in
mind that a mere accusation is not
o i.r accepted as proof of the exist
e-nce or commllission of a crime, and
that every accused is entitled under
our laws and according to the spirit
of common justice and humanity, to
be presumed innocent until his guilt
is established by competent evidence
after a fair trial of his case.
The presumption of innocence in
the present instance is particularly
strong by reason of the high standing
and irreproachable character which
all of the seven defendants in these
prosecutions have maintained for
many years-in this community. They
have been prominent and useful citi
zens, doing much for the upbuilding
and improvement of the town and
parish. Most of them have been ad
vanced to important positions in civ
ic life and fraternal circles, and have
never failed to "make good" and to
discharge every duty incumbent up
on them in an entirely capable and
satisfactory manner. Furthermore,
the bank with which they were con
nected has ever stood as a staunch
friend to the town, and a large part
of the many substantial improve
ments accomplished here in past
years can be justly credited to the
good offices of this institution in a
financial way.
Add to these considerations the
justifiable inference that the charges
against the accused officials are
more technical than otherwise, and
it would seem that this is pre-emi
nently a proper case for a suspension
of public judgment until such time as
a full and searching investigation has
been made by means of a trial in
court. The Chief earnestly hopes
that the outcome of such a test will
exonerate the accused of any inten
tional wrongdoing.
CONGRESS AND THE PRES
IDENT'S MESSAGE.
The longest continuous special ses
sion of the United States congress
on record came to an -end last Mon
day noon and was immediately fol
lowed by the opening of the regular
session. Officers having been elect.
ed and committees appointed dur
ing the special session, both houses
were in readiness to resume the rou
tine of business without interrup
tion or delay.
In pursuance of the policy mapped
out for himself at the beginning ol
his administration, President Wilson
read his annual message to the sen
ate and house of representatives in
joint session on Tuesday. The com
munication was unusually brief, it:
reading occupying only twenty-eight
minutes, and both the matter it con
tained and the manner of its pre
sentationi" elicited hearty manifesta
tions o~a proyal and applause from
the audience, irrespective of political
alignment.
President Wilson avoided the prac
tice of his predecessors in devoting
a great part of their messages to
inarters of routine that are presented
in the reports of the heads of the
,arious departments of the govern
ment, and confined himself to topics
of general scope and specific subjects
upon which legislative action is nec
essary or desirable.
The Mexican situation is given
precedence as one of the most im
portant problems confronting the
country. The Huerta regime is
characterized plainly as a military
usurpation that is bound to crumble,
and President Wilson expresses the
belief that our present policy of
watchful waiting should be continued,
and that an early restoration of con
stitutional and orderly government in
Mexico will transpire.
Currency reform is urged and leg
islation recommended for a system
of rural credits, reinforcement of the
Sherman anti-trust law, selection of
presidential candidates by primary
elections, territorial government for
Alaska, better conservation of nation
al resources, 'and a fair and effective
employers' liability act.
The president thinks we can bind
Hawaii and Porto Rico firmly to the
United States through the forms of
territorial or state government, but
that the Philippines present a differ
ent problem, only to be properly
solved by the gradual relinquishment
of the control of the islands to
the Filipino people as they develop
and improve their capacity for intel
!igent and efficient self-government.
The message contained an approv
ing reference to the internation
al conference being held at London
for the consideration of plans look
ing to the greater safety of ships at
sea and betterment of conditions un
der which crews of vessels are em
ployed, and the president closed with
an expression of the pleasure he has
experienced in co-operating with con
gress in the common service and his
admiration for "the diligence, the
good temper, and the full comprehen
sion of public duty which has already
been manifested by both of the
houses."
SAME HERE.
The esteemed Assumption Pioneer
remarks that the newspapers of the

the members of the constitutional
coulnvention of 1913 for the highly sat

acconmplished its allotted mission,

b:.d out a merited meed of com
nlendation to Hon. John Marks, the
Assumption delegate, for his share
in the good work.
]this reminds us to say that As
cension's representative, Hon. R.
N. Sims, is eminently deserving of a
similar tribute. He served as a mem
ber of the style and revision com
mittee, one of the most important of
the convention's committees, took a
prominent part in all the discussions
and deliberations, and was a leader
in the fight for the adoption of the
anti-trust ordinance which is a nota

state's ormganic law.

A TIMELY SLUI N
ANOTHER OPTIMIST FURNISHES
INSPIRATION TO THE PEOPLE
OF DONALDSONVILLE.
'Deposit at Home" Should be the
Watchword, ..s Well as "Buy at
Home."
Not less inspiring and encouraging
to this community than the fine let
.i" from President E. P. Brady of
the Alluvial Land Purchase Company
printed in last week's Chief, is the
following communicatjon from George
\W. Reese, president of the St. Elmo
and Belle Helene railroad.
Everybody should read what he
says:
"New Orleans, La., Nov. 26, 1913.
"Editor Chief, Donaldsonville, La.
"Dear Sir:-Anyone who thought
the suspension of the Bank of Don
aldsonville would have an infavorable
effect on the other two Donaldson
viile institutions would have had to
revise that opinion had he looked in
at- either the - People' Bank or the
Bank of Ascension Monday morning,
"When I dropped in to open an ac
count with the People's on Monday, I
found really a crowd on hand-not
drawing out, but making deposits, and
many of those present were new ac
counts like myself. I am told the
same agreeable condition of affairs
prevailed at the Bank of Ascenson.
"While, of course, the closing of
the doors of the Bank of Donaldson
ville is an occurrence to be regretted,
there is much encouragement in the
fact that the remaining institutions
enjoy the confidence of the Donald
sonville public, and that no one, ap
parently, has been tempted to re
move his deposits to any other bank
ing center.
"Certainly there is no end for a
merchant or business man to gain by
sending his money away from his
home tiown; in fact it is just the
other way around. All the "buy at
home" arguments might be applied
with equal weight to the "deposit at
home" principle. Banking-by-mail is
just as much of a detriment to local
interests as is the mail-order busi
ness, and for almost the same identi
cal reasons.
"All credit to Donaldsonvilie, there
fore, that in a condition like the
present, its people have shown their
loyalty' to their home institutions in
such a substantial and convincing
manner. I believe the close of this
crop season will find Donaldsonville
and the surrounding territory in bet
ter financial, condition than they
have been for some time past.
"Yours very truly,
"GEO. W. REESE."
Mr. Reese is a bopster, a hustler
and an optimist of the first water,
who has shown his faith in the fu
ture destiny of Donaldsonville and
Ascension parish by deeds and
works that speak for themselves
and leave no room for cavil or doubt.
He planned and conducted the poul
try show held at St. Elmo last Sun
day, which proved successful despite
the bad weather and will no doubt
exert much influence for good on the
poultry industry of this section, and
this is. but one of numerous instances
i:n which he has sought to promote:
and upbuild local interests.
Anything such a citizen says with
regard to the affairs and prospects
of the community is entitled to fair
consideration and full credence; and
the plea he makes for the support of
home business and home institutions
is so forcible in its simplicity that it
should command instant and cordial
concurrence among all classes and
conditions of our people.
"Buy at home" and "Bank at
home" are good watchwords for the
hour. Every dollar spent here is go
ing to help a bit toward overcoming
business depression and restoring the
confidence and activity essential to
the recouping of past losses and the
laying of a foundation for future
profits. Doubts, fears and repinings
can do no possible good. It is up
to us all to be cheery, hopeful and
confident like Messrs. Brady and
Reese.
District Court.
The exception of no cause of ac
tion in the suit of B. Mistretta et
.a,s. vs. A. Falsetta et als. was ar
gued before Judge Charles Wortham
last Saturday forenoon and taken
under advisement. Counsel for de
fendants offered a written motion to
set aside the injunction, which was
ordered filed. Counsel for plaintiffs
)bjc:.ted to the filing of the motion
on the ground that it came too late,
and 'by consent the matter was fix
ed for argument on Dec. 3. The lit
igants are members of the local
Italian Benevolent Society, and the
squabble involves the seating of the
officers iecently elected, the plain
tiffs having enjoined the defendants
from assuming the offices -to which
.liy w-re named.
At Wednesday's session of court,
the case of Stella Smith vs. Joe
Millet was taken up on confirmation
of default, and judgment rendered in
favor of plaintiff, granting her an
absolute divorce. In the suit of
Mistretta vs. Falsetta, the exception
of misjoifnder and no .cause of action
was overruled, and the injunction
modified so as to restrain A. Fal
setta from performing the duties of
president of the Italian Society on
ly until such time as he shall have
been duly and legally inducted and
installed in such office by the prop
er authorities of the society, after
which time he shall be no longer re
strained. As thus modified!, the in
junction will remain in "force and ef
feet, until the final decision of the
muerits of the case.

i RTBY SiOW BIG SUCCESS.
First Semi-Annual Display of St. El.
mo Association Attracts Large
Crowd-Fine Exhibits and Inter
esting Addresses.
The gloriously bright and clear
weather of Sunday afternoon, coupled
with the interest that had been ex
cited in the first semi-annual show
of the St. Elmo Poultry Association
by the announcements spread
throughout the neighborhood, brought
out a large and enthusiastic crowd
to see the exhibits and 'hear the talks
that were on the program. That all
who attended the show were highly
pleased was.evidenced by the expres
sions of appreciation heaird on all
sides regarding the exhibits, the
speeches and the other features of
the interesting affair.
The honors of the show went to
Mrs. G. Donnaud Bentley, a Donald
sonville exhibitor, who took four
firsts pnd two seconds with her en
tries of White Leghorns and White
Wyandottes. Prof. W. H. Gates, of
the Louisiana State University, Who
judged all the entries, was so
pleased with Mrs. Bentley's chickens
that he specially requested they be
sent to Baton Rouge to compete in
the show which opened in that city
yesterday, to continue until tomorrow
evening.
Among the prize-winners from St.
Elmo, Darrow and Burnside were Miss
M. Landry, J. R. Beauvais, Mrs. J.
Troxler, Mrs. E. Oubre, Mrs. N. Bou
dreaux, Mrs. A. Gautreau. Mrs. Guy
A. Porche,, Mrs. N. C. Reynolds, Mrs.
Truxillo, E. A. Landry, J. H. Krae
mner, Mrs. O. Martinez, Mrs. E. Scor
sone, and Mrs. J. Lark.
The exhibit of Carnaud pigeons en
tered by E. J. Breaux took first pre
miumr in its class,, and the second
premium was won by Chandler Oubre
of St. Elmo.
Westley Nicholas, a colored farmer
from the New River section, drew
first premium with his exhibit of
Rhode Island Red chickens. Nicholas,
it will be remembered, won four
prizes at the Donaldsonville fair, and
was the only exhibitor in that event
from his section of the parish.
As side issues, there were several
xhibits .which proved to be interest
ing to.zth'crowd. The famous hack
ney stallion, Wood Paragon, was' on
hand, and,was much admired. A dis
play of agricultural implements, fence
wire and chicken feed, by B. Lem
ann 8& Bro., attracted attention and
w'as valuable because it showed
where up to date farmers and chick
en-raisers could purchase necessary
supplies-a thing, by the way, which
vas not so well knoawn before. Much
amusement was created by the
bright pink ribbon, tied in a big bow,
sported by the young boar pig, Wood
land Master George, . owned by
George W. Reese. Pigs were not
supposed to come in for ribbons, but
'W. M. G.'s proud owner could not
bear to see him left entirely out,
so one of St. Elmo's prettiest lit
tle girls had to sacrifice her cherish
ed bit of hair ribbon in order that
piggy might be decorated. Mrs.
Porche's exhibit of a capon taking
care of twenty-eight little chicks was
rihe subject of much admiring com
ment.
Prof. Jordan, of the State Univer
sity, gave an interesting lecture on
hog-raising, and dwelt especially on
the advantages of organization and
co-operation among breeders and ship
pers of hogs, and, in fact, any live
stock or agricultural product. En
couraged by the interest taken in his
remarks, Prof. Jordan has offered to
give a special course of instruction
and supervision to any one or two
men in St. Elmo who are ambitious
to do some big things in the hog
raising line. This generous offer has t
been accepted, and Adam Gautreau
and J.: H. Kraemer have been named 1
as the two to whom Prof. Jordan will 1
lend his assistance.
Prof. Gates won the admiration of i
his audience at the outset of his ad
dress by naming the various points t
by whieh chickens are judged for
excellence and showing in an under- -
standabie way the value of these
points in relation to healthfulness and
maximum egg production. The pro- b
fEssor talked mainly from the utility
stanrdpoint and in this way made ab
distinctly favorable impression upon F
.all in the audience, who are interest-C
ed in chickens chiefly for the money i
that may be made with them, and a
not as fanciers. At the conclusion of i
Mr. Gates' talk, a number of neoDle!
Who had raised chickens all their
lives said he had told them more
about successful chicken-raising in
these few minutes than they had been
able to pick up from experience in
the years them. have handled the
birds. As one man put it: "I have
raised chickens and have been fairly
successful, yet Prof. Gates has
shown me that about nine out of ten
things I did were Werong. What would
have been my success if I had done
these nine things right?"
Anorther said: "He was right
about that bent breast bone being
due to the hen roosting on a round
pole. 'That chicken was mine, and
frcni now on, she and the rest of
them will have the right kind of
roosts."
Prof. Gates' talk having made such
a profound impression on all present,
the St. Elmo Poultry Association has
asked him for a synopsis of it, and
the address will be studied and dis
cussed at the weekly meetings of the
association in connection with in
struction that the members of the
association are receiving from other
sources.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
The Chief is not responsible for the
views expressed by correspondents.
The Donaldsonville Bank Failure.
Colomb, La., Nov. 28, 1913.
Editor Chief:
The necessity for a national cur
rency law such as congress now has
under consideration, is emphasized by
the suspension of the Bank of Don
aldsonville. If there had been some
means of realizing cash for valid
loans, that had not yet matured, it is
possible the bank might have weath
ered its embarrassment. This fea
ture of the Glass bill will be of incal
culable benefit to small country banks
in the farming districts. The financ
ing of agricultural interests, upon
adequate.security, would then be un
dertaken more freely and with lit
tle risk of impairing the cash re
serve, as the collateral would be
quickly evailable by re-discount in
the regional' banks.
Another requirement that comes
into prominence is the necessity for
a state law. to guarantee depositors
a.gainst loss. It is to be hoped the
next legislature will take this ques
bton up and follow the example of
Nebraska and some other states, by
enacting a law to protect every de
positor in a state bank against any
loss of his money. Such a law would
attract to small banks a vast amount
of timid capital that now goes to the
larger Blanks,, or remains out of cir
culation and useless for financial op
erations, and would operate to the
benefit of the depositor, the bank and
the borrower. The prejudice in favcr
of the large banks would no longer
exist, as depositors would be as well
protected in the one as in the other.
Such a law would be opposed by
the large banking houses and the
commission merchants who work to
gether, for the same reason the mon
eyed interests are now opposing the
currency bill-it would interfere with
their business. The farming indus
tries should be financed by home
capital as much as passible, and
freed from the domination of big
corporations, operating through the
large city banks and commission
houses, which not only exact all the
traffic will stand, but, by conspiring
together, force his produce into the
maiw of some predatory corporation,
rouh a rigged up market, where
he is fleeced to the limit.
Yours truly,
L. A. COLOMB.
Closing of the Bank of Don.
aldsonvjlle,
Paincourtville, La., Dec. 1,, 1913.
Editor Chief:
Aften reading in your paper the
article on the failure of the Bank of
Donaldsonville, I wish' to say there is
only one of three deductions to ar
rive at: 1, That Bank Examiner
Young is either using poor business
judgment; 2, that the writer is an
exaggerated specimen of the business
world, or 3, that the laws of our
land are criminally socialistic.
In District Attorney Gilbert's affi
davit he claims that a certain ap
praisement made by the officers and
several of the directors of the bank
on Oct. 24, 1913, was false. Further
along it is recited that at a special
meetihg of the board of directors of
the bank that same day, Mr. Young
and his assistant, Mr. Thompson,
made the very extraordinary discov
ery that many of the loans of the
bank were not properly secured and
others were in excess of the amounts
prescribed by law. Is it possible the
wonderful genius the state has se
lected to administer the banking de
partment only discovered at the end
of October, after being examiner so
long, that these conditions existed?
fn every well organized family
:here is an old French adage that is
.acredly observed, "I1 vaut mieux
aisser son enfant morveux que de
ui arracher son nez." Does the state
f Louisiana feel so presumptious as
to believe that through its vested au
thority it can select a man competent
to judge values of property add collat
erals? At a time when the whole
political powers have fallen Into the
hands of the Philistines; at a time
when our nation is undergoing a
business warfare the like of which
has never been recorded in the an
nals of history; at a time when our
country is striving through its social
Istic administration to bring about
an equalization of wealth-this is the
time Mr. Young selects to order the
Bank of Donaldsonville to reduce its
loans or properly secure them, and
to furnish him with certificates of
mortgages.
The closing down of the Bank of
Donaldsonville is an outrage. If the
state will give the bank examiner
enough rope he wtill hang himself, by
closing all the banks and losing his
own job.
If these gentlemen who have been
accused had used the public's money
for their own speculations, or had
wallowed in luxury with it, there
might have been some excuse. I
think our officers have acted hastily,
and it would be wise for our young
men to read the Progressive platform,
and especially that portion referring
to the recall. We will never get
justice until we can recall our offi
cers by public elections demanded by
the minority. G. J. LABAIRR$.
