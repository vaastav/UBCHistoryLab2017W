If tub Herald waged any unfair war
on Mr. Miles —which it did not—why did
not the "organs" of the g. o. p. come
boldly to the rescue? Why, forsooth?
Because all the Herald said was the
calm truth.
Fob the mouth of November the mean
temperature in Los Angeles was 57.2 de
grees, the highest temperature was 83.8,
the lowest was 40, the mean langeof
temperature was 19.7, and some days
the range was only a little more than (i
degrees. Bring the blessed spot on the
whole footstool which can compare with
this record! Think of a place where during
the sunny hours of the day the mercury
ranges at 65 to 85 degrees in November,
and where the night temperature has
been 40 to 50 degrees! Contemplate
these figures and realize what it all
means!
Still butter, eggs, cheese and poultry
come rolling into the 6unlit semi-tropics.
They come daily, *.nd bear tbe marks of
Kansas, Nebraska aud other blizzard
swept States. Thusit is not in our clime
but in ourselves that we are tributary to
these alien sections of tlie Union. Let
us be up and doing. If a man can make
a dollar in these enterprises east of the
Bookies, the same capital, energy and
sense expended here would produce
three, yea five dollars. There is the big
gest sort of profit to be reaped here iv
just these industries. Get in and reap
it, you who desire the benefit.
The Fullerton cannery is busily en
gaged in putting up tomatoes. Here we
are well into the month of December and
yet people who raise garden truck are
gathering fresh tomatoes from the vines
in the open field. That teils the story
of our climate. The same con
cern is putting up baked beans.
The cannery has an order for
15,000 cans from Los Angeles
merchants. This is the initial step in a
new industry hereabouts, and that tells
the story of our future. There are very
numerous ways here of founding new
lines of enterprise which will grow apace
and prove most profitable to those who
are shrewd enough to take hold of them.
Hk was rebooked for th<3 Council, but
he was rebuked by the people. Mr.
Book probably realizes to the full the
difference between f hese 'wo pro
grammes. He made an unwarranted
attack in a"v unfair way on the recent
Chief of Police. It was all done for po
litical capital, but the American people
like fair play and just methods. Mr.
Book knows now better how to
earn popularity. It is by doing
the fair thing. There are two
or three others who figured in the same
bad role at whom the people on a future
occasion will cast many a stone of disap
probation. Their day is coming. Tlie
mills of the gods grind slowly, but they
grind exceeding small.
The Evening Hidebound says yester
day : "The Democrats have made an un
usually viciou3 warfare upon Mr. Miles,
the Republican nominoe for Mayor," and
their party organ has employed itself in
a most "unscrupulous manner in dealing
with his official record." There is this to
be said of it, that our esteemed contem
porary leaves this to be said
by "its devil-may-care reporter,"
as itself styled him on a
previous occasion. It has the decency
not to put this "bouncer"' in its editorial
columns. The "vicious warfare" con
sisted in telling the exact truth about
Mr. Miles, and the "unscrupulous man
ner of dealing with his official record"
consisted in telling just what that record
shows on its own face. If that is
"vicious warfare" and an "unscrupulous
manner of dealing," why, in the memor
able words of Patrick Henry, make the
most of it!

THE LOS ANGELES DAILY HERALD: TTFSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1888.
A Sweeping Democratic Victory.
The municipal election in this city yes
terday resulted in a sweeping victory for
the Democratic ticket. The candidate
for Mayor, John Bryson, ran well aheajl
of his ticket, and this fact shows con
clusively that the people of Los Angeles
are not prepared to place their city in the
hands of visionaries and impracticables.
One week ago the Republican candi
dates aud their backers thought they had
a walk-over. The party had suddenly
bloomed into an organization of ex
tremists upon social questions, and, in
stead of promising a practical
and progressive administration of
our municipal affuirs, it threat
ened to usurp the functions of
a conventicle and turn the Common
Council into an arena where moral
polemics would take the place of sensi
ble discussion of public improvements
and police protection.
On the other hand, the Democratic
party took tlie position that the city gov
ernment should confine itself to its legiti
mate functions; that the saloon question
should be treated on its merits; if high
license was to bo exacted, tbat it should
be exacted as a means of revenue, aud
not on the false pretense of weeding out
the dives and deadfalls; that no license,
however high, should tolerate disorderly
houses, and that the way to get rid of
such places was to suppress them by
the police arm under the law.
The liberal-minded people of this city,
regardless of party, took the Democratic
view of the question. They evidently
did not consider that Los Angeles was an
Eastern village, wheie Blue-Law experi
ments ought to be tried; but a great col
mopolitan city to which people were in
vited to come from al! parts. They
conceived that to place a grow
ing city like ours in a strait
jacket, and to drive people away by rad
ical exactions interfering with the liberty
of the person, would soon result in para
lyzing progress and putting and end to
prosperity. They wanted law and order
and good government; but they did not
want to be subjected to narrow-minded
dictation outside the legitimate province
of government. The Democratic pol icy
has, in thisinstance, received so powerful
an endorsement that it is to be hoped the
lesson will not bo lost upon those vision
ary people who labor under the delusion
that political governments can success
fully usurp the field of labor of religious
organizations, and make moral men and
women out of the vicious and depraved
element that is to be found in all large
cities. Violations of law can be pun
ished by the civil authorities; but to re
form the vicious and profligate is a task
which belongs to other than political or
ganizations.
We congratulate the Democracy of
Los Angeles on the victory gained yester
day. Now let our city officers elect show
the people that their pledges were not
lightly taken, by giving Los Angeles a
pure, progressive and practical adminis
tration, carrying out the principles of the
platform upon which they went before
the people and triumphed so signally.
The Presidents message.
At the opening of Congress yesterday
the President's message was read in both
Houses. It is a very leugthy document,
and treats in detail all the leading ques
tions relating to our domestic aud foreign
affairs. Like all of Mr. Cleveland's pub
lic papers, it is straightforward, earnest
and logical. He devotes consider
able space to the tariff, and reiter
ates, wfth force and clearness,
his views on this important sub
ject. He insists that a fa ; r revision of
the tariff is a matter that cannot be
ignored, if we are to carry on the gov
ernment iv the interest of equality under
the law of all classes of people. The
wrong of discrimination is so opposed to
tae principles of our institutions t! iat h
cannot be long continued without pro
ducing the most serious consequences.
The President treats the Sack ville-West
affair as an impertinent and undiplo
matic interference in our domestic con
cerns, and justifies the dismissal of the
British Minister on the ground that his
conduct had rendered it impossible for
the Government to hold further official
communication with him. The message
will repay a careful perusal.
Real estate sales for November footed
up nearly three and a half millions of dol
lars. For the eleven months of 1888, the
record runs at over $50,000,000. Where
is the other county in the Union whicii
lias such a record to show ? And this is
in what is alleged to be a "bu rated
boom."
Poor Quantity of Valencia Raisins.
The quantity of Valencia raisins of
fered lhe trade lately has boen anything
but satisfactory. Many a grocer whose
chief aim is to furnish good goods to his
trade has already found this fact out.
and others will later on.
A large portion of the crop this season
has been seriously injured by rain and
in very many instances the first
was not fit for consumption. The
Spanish packers, disregarding the
unfitness of many of the crops, have
packed them in boxes, and those boxes
are now in this country. They have, in
order to deceive the buyer, placed good
fruit on the top and the poor below, so
that the grocer who looks at the top only
feels he is getting the same grade alt
through the box, and only discovers hi
mistake when he begins to retail them
Some of the trade that has discovered
the trick of the Spanish traders, offset it
—so to speak—by offering the goods at a
low price in order to get rid of them.
The retailer, however, who wants his
customers to have good goods, does not
want these raisins at any price. The
grocer who doesn't care what kind his
customers get, wants them to he sure
that he is not paying full price for them.

Associated Tress Disratcfles to the Herald I
Washington, December 3. —It was
an unußuallj - dull Senate that re
sponded to President pro tent. Ingalls'
call to order at 12 o'clock to day. At that
time all the gtllet ies were full, except the
President's and the diplomatic depart
ments. As the miuute hand overtook
the hour indicator on the dial of Iheclock
facing him, Ingalls let i'ali tlie gavel aud
Chaplain Butler opened the proceedings
with prayer. A few moments more were
spent in greeting Senators and then Sen
ator Sherman offored the usual lesolution
that the Secretary notif> the House that
the Senate is ready to proceed to busi
ness.
The resolution was adopted and a
committee ordered to notify tlie Presi
dent that the Senate is ready to receive
any communication he may have to
make. Messrs. Morrell and Saulsburry
composed this committee. Mr. Camer
on offered a resolution that the Senate
take a recess of haif an hour. The recess
was further extended tiil half-past one
o'clock.
At the conclusion of the recess the
usual message from the House announced
the fact'of its being in session and of
having committee to wait
upon the President, delivered it, it hav
ing been delayed in consequence of the
recess. That was followed by a report
from the comn.ittee to wait on the Presi
dent, and to wiat effect it. had performed
that duty, ant' the President would com
municate in writing immediately. Then
the President's message was delivered
by Pruden, one of his secretaries, and
McCook, Secretary of the Senate, pro
ceeded to read it.
[The full text of the message will be
found on page three.—Ed.j
The reading of the message occupied
an hour and forty minutes. The portions
of it which discuss the questions of tariff
revision, treasury surplus, fishery
troubles and the "West" incident, were
listened to with very close attention and
apparent interest by fourteen Republican
Senators and about an equal number of
Democrats. The other portions of the
message seemed to have few if any lis
teners and the reading had the effect of
gradually clearing the galleries of the
numerous spectators.
When the reading was finished the
message, on motion of Mr. Hoar, was
laid on the table and ordered printed.
Mr. Hoar then said that he was about to
move an adjournment, but thought it
would be convenient for the Senate to
learn from the gentlemen having the
various measures in charge what was
likely to be the order of business for to
morrow.
Presiding Officer Ingalls said that the
unfinished business was a bill to reduce
taxation (the tariff.)
Mr. Hoar—At what hour will that
bill be in order to-morrow ?
Presiding officer—2 o'clock.
Frye—l give notice I shall call up for
consideration, with consent of the Sen
ate, a bill for the settlement with the
Union Pacific Company to-morrow morn
ing immediately after the routine busi
ness of the morning is completed.
The Senate adjourned after notifica
tions Viy Frye that he would call up the
the Union Pacific Settlement bill to mor
row ; by Chandler that he would ask for
action ou his resolution to investigate the
Louisiana election of April last, and by
Allison that be would ask the Senate to
proceed with the Tariff bill, and would,
even if discussion became too protracted,
call it up during the morning hours of
session.
The Senate Committee on Finance will
begin this afternoon to hear therepresen
atives of interests affected by the Tariff
bill pending before the Senate.
THE HOI'IE.
Two Hundred and Thirty.Stx *Jem.,
ber» Present at the <>teniae •
Washington, December 3. —Long be
fore the hour for the meeting of the see
or.d session of the Fiftieth Congress the
public galleries were filled with specta
tors. On the floor handshaking was in
dulged in, and congratulations on re
election or condolences on defeat were
exchanged among the members.
Jocose raillery on the part of the
Republicans and patient resig
nation on the part of the Demo
crats was everywhere evident.
The Republican members who are prom
inently mentioned in connection with the
Speakership came in for an extra share
of felicitation, it being generally con
ceded on the floor that the next House
will be Republican with from three to
seven majority. When Randall entered
the chamber, which he did at a few mo
ments before noon, he was surrounded
by his friends, desirous of expressing
their pleasure at seeing him once more
able to resume his Congressional du'ies.
At precisely 12 o'clock tlie fall of the
gavei stilled the tumult which existed in
the hall, and silence reigned while the
Chaplain offered prayer. The roll of
members was then called and the hum
of conversation broke out afresh. Dar
ing the progress cf the call Mrs. Cleve
land entered the Executive gallery and
became an attentive spectator. " Tho
call developed the presence of 23G mem
bers, there being 88 absentees.
On motion of Mills, of Texas, a resolu
tion was adopted directing the Clerk io
inform the Senate that a quorum of the
House had appeared and the House was
ready to proceed to business. In accord
ance with the resolution the Speaker ap
pointed a committee to join a similar
committee appointed by the Senato to
wait upon the President and inform him
that Congress was ready to receive any
communication he might desire to trans
mit. The House then at 12:30 took a
recess for an hour.
After recess Holman announced that
the committee appointed to wait upon
the President had performed ils duty,
and the President would communicate
with Congress forthwith. Pruden, one
of the President's secretaries, then an
nounced the annual message and deliv
ered it to the Houee, which was immedi
ately read by the Clerk.
That portion of the message in which
the President treats of the tariff question
was listened to attentively by the mem
bers of both sides of the House. Now
and then a smile, more of triumph than
derision, would appear upon the face of
some enthusiastic Republicans, but the
silence was not broken until the clerk
read in a clear voice, "The cause for
which the battle is waged is comprised
within lines clearly and distinctly defin
ed. It should never be compromised.
It is the people's cause." Then the
Democrats could no longer restrain their
feelings, but broke into a round of ap
plause, which was answered by the Re
publicans with deris-ive laughter.
Tne President's reference to the Sack
ville West incident piovoked laughter
from the Republican side of the House,
but no demonstration was made by the
Democrats.
From this point interest in themesfuge
slackened. Mills was the only member
who paid the slightest attention to its
further reading, and the noise of conver
sation was so great that this was no easy
task.
When, at 3:15, the reading was com
pleted, Mills offered a resolution, which
was agieed to, referring the message to
Committee of tlie Whole and providing
for its printing.

WASHINGTON. December 3.—The re
port of the Secretary of the Navy, of
which a brief synopsis was telegraphed
a f- w days ago, contains several Inter
esting features which could not be em
bodied at that time. Of the work of the
Asiatic squadron it says: Owing to the
co.tinued unsettled condition of affairs
in Corea, part of tlie force on that station
has been kept during the year constantly
in Corean waters. In June last an out
break of the populace in Seoul was threat
t?ned,andat tho request of uiu Minister
an armed force of twenty-five seamen
and marines from the Essex, under com
mand of Lieutenant Galloway, was land
ed in that city to protect American resi
dents, and were w itlidrawn a few dayc
later upon affairs becoming again pacific
The Brooklyn and .Juanita have been de
tached from the squadion aud ordered to
the United States, tlie former via Hono
lulu and Cape Horn and the latter by
way of Sue/, canal and tlie Mediterranean
sea. Tho Juanita joined (lie fquadron
from the Pacific iv March last.
The Pacific squadron continues under
command of Rear-Admiral L. A. Kim
bcrly, and eousists of the Trenton, Van
dalia, Mohican, Adams, Alert, Nipsic,
Dolphin, l'iuta and the store ship Mo-
The Trenton, Nipsic and
Dolphin have joined the Eqtiadron dur
ing the past year, and tbe Iroquois aud
Joanietta, the Former needing extensive
repairs, were ordered to the Mare Island
navy yard, and in March last was put off
commission, and the latter was ordered
to the Asiatic station. The vessels of
the squadron have visited during the
year the principal ports ou the
west coast of Mexico and Central and
South America, but owing to the political
disturbances in the Hawaiian and Sa
moau Islands, and in Teru, almost the
entire force on this station have been
kept constantly in the waters of those
countries for the protection of lhe lives
and property of our citizens. Tho Mo
hican having been over three years in
commission, has received new officers
aud men and is now at Mare Island
yard, relitting for Eervice- The Monon
gabela is there undergoing tepairs, and
when they n;o completed will receive
stores and supplies for the Pacific squad
ron and return to her station. The rinta
is still employed in Alaskan waters.
Of the steamer i hetis, lhe report says:
The Thetis has been employed during
the past year on special service in the
North Pacific. She has been actively
engaged in visiting the principal settle
ments on the north and west coasts of
Alaska, and has rendered valuable ser
vices to our whaling fleet in the Arctic
and to numerous destitute mariners in
Alaska. Through the exertions of her
commanding officer and crew, tho Ameri
can schooner Jane Gray, abandoned in
the Arctic, was floated and repaired suf
ficiently to be sent to San Francisco,
where she was turned over to her owners,
the officers and men of the Thetis genet
ously waiving all claims of salvage.
Recommendations are renewed to build
large proving and testing machines at
the New York and Mare Island navy
yards, aud to establish central steam
and electric generating plants in the navy
yards, which should supply all points
where steam power and light is required.
Chief Constructor Wilson reports that
the navy yard at Mare Island is being
fitted with a complete outfit of modern
ship building tools. Mare Island is the
only yard on the Pacific coast and is par
ticularly well suited for ship-building
purposes.

A Motion to Advance the Case in
the Supreme Court.
Washington, December 3 —In the Su
preme Court to-day Hon. C. F. Richards,
of Salt Lake, made a motion for the ad
vancement of the case of the United
States vs. the Mormon Church for the
forfeiture and escheatment of church
property to the Government, an appeal
fromadec.ee of the Supreme Court of
Utah. After stating the claims of the
Government and of the appellants, the
following reasons were given for the ad
vancement of cause, viz : That it is a
cause in which the United States is a
party, that it involves the con3'itution
ality of certain acts of Congress; that it
affects not only the people of Utah, but
the rights of church corporations of every
denomination in the Territories, and
is therefore a question of public in
terest; that a large amount of
church property had been seized and
is now held by a receiver, much of it be
ing of a perishable nature and thus liable
to irreparable loss and damage if left till
the case can come up to its order, and
the delay, with the great expenses en
tailed, will amount to a virtual confisca
tion of said property ; that nearly half a
million dollars of personal property has
been thus seized, when there is no law
or semblance of law for the seizure of
personal property ; that part of the real
estate so seized has b, en held by said
Church for over thirty-five years and be
fore the act of 18C2 was Dassed, limiting
the amount of real estate to be held by
Church corporations, and that another
part has been held as a parsonage and is
exempted in tbe terms of law. For
these and other reasons appellants ask
an early hearing of the case. Counsel
for Government offered no objection.
Trie Court took the matter under advice
ment.

I Associated Pr«ss Dispatches to the Herald. I
Indianai-oi.is, December 3. —A most
desperate and cold-blooded attempt to
commit murder occurred early this morn
ing in the bakery of James P. Bruce.
About thrse years ago Bruce took a poor,
homeless German named George Hacker
into his employ and taught him the
trade. Hacker gradually developed into
a full-blown anarchist, and when con
versing on tho subject of anarchy would
grow excited and abusive. This morn
ing, when Bruce entered the bakery to
mix the flour for his bread, Hacker
sprang on him armed with a hatchet and
a long knife. He struck Bruce on the
head with the hatchet, then he crowded
Hie dazed victim against the wall and
deliberately plunged the dagger nine
times Kinto Bruce's neck and face.
The victim cried out for his wife.Jand the
brave woman rushed into the room and
clutched the blood-bespattered Anarchist
about the neck, dragging him away
from her husband, just as lie was lifting
the hatchet to brain the helpless man. A
terrible Btruggle between the frantic wife
and the anarchist then took place. He
was wild with murderous hate, and hold
ing his bloody knife in his hand he
rushed about tlie room endeavoring to
get again at the dying Bruce. He finally
did get by the wife and reached Bruce,
when the latter, who is of giant frame,
struggled to his feet in a dying effort,and
grabbed a shovel and struck Hacker a
blow on the head, who fled and is still at
large. Bruce is at the hospital with slim
hopes of living thiough the night.

Other guests were General Longstreet, E.

General Longstreet tells a reporter
there is not the least bit of political sig

Chicago, December:!.—This afternoon
Judge i'uley, of tlie Superior Court, is
sued a rule ori Judge Prendergast, of the
County Court, forbidding him to proceed
to appoint a receiver for tlie bankrupt
firm cf Lindaner Bros. & Co., clothiers.
Judge Prendergast held that Judge
Tuloy had no jurisdiction in the prem
ises, anl proceeded to appoint a
receiver. lie named Michael J.
Schwersthal, of the International Bank,
as assignee. The matter was further
complicated this afternoon by the action
of Judge Horton who, on petition of the
attorneys for the insolvents and several
New York creditors, appointed Bern at d
Kuppenheimer receiver for the failed
firm. It is said the petition of thefe
creditors was part of a plan to outwit
Judge Prendergast, and they certainly
now have the best of the matter, as Re

Canon City, Col., December 3.—George
Wether-ell, who is charged with the mur
der of Charles R. McKain near this place
about a month ago, and who was also
charged with killing two other men in
this State, arrived here from Denver this
morning to stand trial. At this time
(11:30 p. m ) several hundred citizens are
on the streets armed with shotguns and
revolvers, determined to take Wetherell
from jail and lynch him. The Sheriff's
family live in a part of the jail. The
Sheriff is flying to keep the mob off on
the plea of having a very sick child.
Should he succeed in keeping them off
to-night the citizens say it is only a mat
ter of time when they will get him.
Harry Perdu, another murderer confined
in the same jail, will likely suffer the
same fate as Wetherell if the mob gains
possession, cf the prisoners.

THE COMMONS.
A Debate on Ualfour's I tl in 1 n Ist ra.
lion or Irish Affairs.
London, December 3.—The Commons
went into Committee to-night on the
Irish estimates. An appropriation of
£12,707 was asked in order to complete
the sum of £40,707 for the expenses of the
Irish Secretary's otlice.
Ellis, Liberal, moved a reduction, his
purpose being to raise a general debate
on Ualfour's administration. He charged
that the Gove nment was using coercion
to such an extent that 1,500 persons were
imprisoned since the crimes act went
into operation. Balfour was seeking to
conceal from the people of England the
acts of cruelty perpetrated in Ireland.
Balfour's entire administration had been
characterized by party malignity and
calculated brutality.
Balfour retorted sharply and con
cluded his remarks by saving if the
country once understood the criminal
methods by which political objects were
advocated in Ireland, in the character of
au alliance, the verdict would not be
with Gladstone.
Gladstone, who had come from
Hawarden in order to assist in the attack
upon the Government, twitted Balfour
and other Conservatives with having
sought a similar alliance on the eve of
last election. The Ex-premier denied
that the Liberals had sought party ad
vantage in the alliance which arose from
a concurrence of opinion with the
Nationalists upon the great lines of their
policy toward Ireland. [Cheers.!
He proceeded to charge Balfour with
misrepresenting Eari Spencer's treat
ment of prisoners, when Spencer was
Viceroy ef Ireland, and reviewed other
cases. Coming to the murders at
Mitchelltown, he assured the Conserva
tives that nothing but repentance would
silence the reproach arising from that
mistake. It would be heard again and
again, until the Government would be
obliged to condemn what it heretofore
had praised, or until tbe time came
when the solemn verdict of the whole
country was given. [Cheers and counter
cheers.] The murders were never in
quired into as they ought to have been.
But what could be expected of an ad
ministration whose claim of character
was neither honorable, nor pure, nor
just?
Mr. Balfour said Gladstone, while pro
testing against strong language, was
himself indulging in criticism, the chief
featuie of which was the strength of epi
thet. He (Balfour) admitted that he had
fallen into error regarding Earl Spencer,
but the mistake arose from defective
information supplied him. Gladstone,
in his account of the events at
Mitchelltown, omitted to refer to the
mob's attack upon the police, thereby
distorting the truth about the affair.
The assailants of the Government could
not (ravel beyond the narrow limits of a
few charges which had often been re
futed.
After short speeches by Mr. Dillon, Sir
Geo. Trevelyan and Mr. Balfour, with
reference to the Gladßtonian Govern
ment's treatment of political prisoners,
Ihe debate, on motion of O'Brien, was
adjourned.
