SYNOPSIS OF THE MESSAGE.
The president's message opens with a re
minder that this session of congress will
mark tho closo of a century of constitution
al existence. Ho reminds congress that
the constitution was tho chart of puidaneo
laid down by tho fathersof tho country, and
that departure from it means failure of our
institutions. Ho draws a bright picture of
the country's growth, but says that "upon
more careful inspection wo und tho wealth
and luxury of our cities mingled with
poverty and wretchedness and unremuner
a tire labor. A crowed und constantly in
creasing urban popui .tkm suggest tho im
poverishment of tbti rural sections and dis
content with agricultural pursuits. The
farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's
Eimplo and laborious HU joins tho eager
chase for easily uc mired wealth, and so
economic conditions have become difficult
of solution. Wo discover that the fortunes
realized by our manufacturers are no long
er solely a reward of sturdy industry and
enlightened foresight, but that they result
from tho discriminating favor of tho govern
ment and are largely built npon undue ex
action from the masses of our ieople. The
gulf between employers and the employed
is constantly widening and classes are rap
idly forming, one comprising tho very rich
and powerful, while in another are found
the toiling poor.
"As wo view tho achievement of aggro
pated capital, we discover the existence of
trusts, combinations and monopolies, while
tho citizen is struggling farin the roar or is
trampknl to death beneath an iron heel.
Corporations, which should be the carefully
restrained creatures of the law and the ser
vants of tho people, are fast becoming tho
people's masters. Still, congratulatingour
selves npon tho wealth and prosperity of
our country, and complacently contemplat
ing every incident of change inseparable
from theso conditions, it is our duty as
patriotic citizens to Inquire, at tho presort
stage of our progress, how the bond tho
Sovernment made with the people has been
ept and performed.
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn
from our citizens to tho necessities of its
economical administration, tho government
persists in exacting from tho subsUinco of
tho people millions which, unapplied and
useless, lio dormant in its treasury. This
flagrant injustice and this breach of faith
and obligation aJd to tho extortion and tho
Innrrar nltmillnf? tl.n rllrprsinn ftf lhf prr.
rency of tho country from tho legitimate
channels of business. Under the samo laws
by which theso results are produced, tho
government permits many millions more to
bo added to the cost of tho living of our
pcoplo aud to bo taken from our consumers,
which unreasonably swell tho profits of a
small but powerful minority. Tho people
must still bo taxed for tho support of tho
government under the operation of tariff
laws; but to tho extent that the mass of
our citizens nro inordinately burdened be
yond any useful public purposes and for tho
ticneSt of a favorol few, the government,
under pretext of nu exercise ofitstax-ng
power, enters gratuitously into partnership
with thesti favorites, to their advantage
and to tho in urv of a vast majority of our
fteoplc. Tl.ii ii not equality before the
aw."
After the prelmlo tho president argr.ei
that such conditions at e injurious to the
nation, making the government an instru
ment for private gain; and -ho says that tho
farmers aud laborers will see ouly too noon
that they are being fcixed under nn unjust
theory of taxation, without compensatory
favor. When this discontent and tho self
ishness of the benellciaries of protective
tariffs are realized, we will realize that tho
beneficent purpo of our government aro
endangered. "Communism is a hateful
thing, and a menaco to poace and organled
government. Uut'tho communism of com
bined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of
overweening cupidity and selllshness.whieh
ins.duously undermines the justlco and in
tegrity of freo iostitu lions, is not less dan
gerous than tho communism of oppressed
Ioverty, which, exasperated by injustice
und discontent, attacks with wild disorder
tho citadel of rule.
"There aro people whe proposo that tho
government shall protect the rich and that
they in turn will caro for tho laboring poor.
Any intermediary between the people and
their government, or tho least delegation of
tho caro and protection tho covcrnmcnt
owes to tho humblest citizen in tho land,
makes tho bonst of froe Institutions a glit
tering delusion, and tho pretended boon of
American citizenship a shameless imposi
tion. "A Just and sensible revision of our tariff
laws should bo made for the relief of those
of our countrymen who suffer under pres
ent conditions. Such a revision should re
ceive the supjwrt of all who lovo that Jus
tice and equality duo to American citizen
ship; of all who realize that in this
justice and equality our government finds
its strength and its power to protect tho cit
zenand his property; of all who bollevo
that Iho contented competence and comfort
of the m ny accord better with tho spirit of
our institutions th:in colossal fortunes, un
fairly gathered, in the hands of the few; of
all who appreciate that tho forbearance
and fraternity among our people, which
recompense tho valuo of crery American
interest, aro tho surest guarantee of our
national progress, and of all who desiro to
see tho products of American skill and in
genuity in overy market of tho world, with
a result ng restoration of American com
merce." i Paternalism of government is stronily do
r.ouncod, and tho pretext of tho wealth of
tho government being sufllelent excuse for
extravagant expenditure combated. In
this class of false theory comes pensions
granted on no other ground than the appli
cant's liced, private relief bills, etc, which
have con.'.-e-tted congressional work and
prevented consideration of really import
ant puoic urn... Among me Dusiness o
avoided wer j measures for the relief of tho
supremo court ; for United States prisons;
ror an onuiublo land law: and for revision
of the pension laws. Furthermore, under
ploa of serving tho puoiicgooo:, there has
been great laxity In observing tho parti
tions that dlvldo proper fields of federal
and state legislation: and closing this por
tion of his message, ho quotes Andrew
Jackson's peroration on tho constitution.
Tho president argues then on the neces
sity of tariff reform being patent to all and
aysltsnouia Dononcsuy nieiiinucuocuve
j.v rouit-d.eu. A plun Bhotwd bo effected,
"fair and conservative toward existing in
dustries, but which wilt reduce tho cost to
consumers of the necessaries of life, while
it provides for our manufacturers tho ad
vant go of floor raw m terials and permits
no injury to tho interests of American la
bor." Dealing with tho stato of tho;unlon, the
prcsideut says foreign relations havo been
strengthened. The in'emational questions
which still await settlement aro all reason
ably within tt.o domain of a tapablo nego
tiation, and there is no existing subject of
dispute between the United States and any
foreign power that is not susceptible nf
satisfactory adjustment by frank diplo
matic trcatmc-nt.
"The questions between Great Urltiln
and the United States relating to tho rights
of American fishermen under treaty and
international comity in tho territorial
waters of Canada and Newfoundland, 1
regret to say, aro not satisfactorily ad
Justed." Ho recites the diplomatic history of theso
disputes. He then goes on and says:
"Having essayed in the discharge of my
duty to procure by negotiation tho settle
ment of u long standing cause of disputo
and to remove a constant menace to the
good relations of tin two countries, and
continuing to bo of thu opinion that tho
,'ire.ity of Februury last., which failed to
rccoivo the approval of tho senate, did sup
ply a satisfactory, practical and linal ad
justment upon n basis honorablo and just
to both parties of tho di Moult and vexed
question to which it related,' and having
subsequently and unavuilingly recommend
ed other legislation to congress, which
I hoped would suffice to meet tho
exigency created by tho rejection
of tho treaty, I now a -rain in vole a tho earn
est and immediate attention of tho congress
to tho condition of this important question
as it now stands before them and the coun
try, and for tho settlement of which I am
deeply oolicitious. Near tho closo of tho
month of October last, occurrences of a
deeply rcgretablo nature wero brought to
my krowicd-;o which mado it ray painful
but imperative duty to obtaiu with us dtUo
delay na possible, a new peruonal channel
of diplomatic intercourse in this country
with the government of Great Hritain.
"Tho corrcspondeneo in relation to this
incident will, in duo course, bo laid before
you, and will disclose tho unpardonable
conduct of the ollicial referred to, in his in
terference by advice und counsel with
tho suffrages of American citi.ous in tho
very crisis of tho presidential election nenr
ct hand, and aho in his subsequent public
declarations to justify his action, superadd
ing impugnment of tho exeeutlvo and sen
ate of tho United States, in connection with
important questions now pending in contro
versy between tho two governments.
"The offense thus committed was most
grave, involving disastrous, possibilities to
tho good relation of tho United States and
Croat Llrltaln, constituting a gross breach
of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of
tho purely domestic affairs and essential
soverignity of the government to which the
euvoy was accredited. Having first fulfill
ed the Just demand of lutcrnational comity,
by affording full opportunity for her majes
ty's government to act in relief of tho situa
tion, I considered prolongation of the dis
cussion to be unwarranted, und thereupon
declined to further rccogule the diplomatic
character of tho person whose continuanco
in such function would destroy tho mutual
contldcnco which is essential to tho good
understanding of tho two governments, and
was inconsistent with the welfare and self
respect of the government of tho United
States."
A survey of tho Alaskan boundary is
recommended.
An arrangement with Great Hritain
looking to tho romoval of obstacles to the
humano relief of shipwrecked sailors on
the great lakes is suggested.
The relations with Franco on tho im
pressing of American citizens into its mili
tary servief, and tho relations with Samoa
and China on the restriction act. are retold.
The convention with Japan is still in prog
ress. A ct nsular couit in Corca Is recom
mended. Uur representative in Haytl has
been lnstruetel to abstain from interfer
ence in tho revolution now to there, while
duo precautions for tho observance of
neutrality laws have been taken. Sub
marine telegraph connection with Honolu
lu Is roeommeuded. A precise location of
tho Mexican boundary line is urged to
avoid future complications. Claims of
American citizens against tho foreign gov
ernments have been amicably settled.
Tho president then takes up tho question
of naturalization, dealing with It thus:
"With the rapid increase of immigration to
our shores uud tho facilities of modern
travel, abuses of tho generous privileges
afforded by our naturalization laws call for
their careful revision. Tho easy and un
gu'i'jed manner in which certificates of
American citizenship can be obtained has
induced u clans, unfortunately largo, to
avail themselves of tho opjortunity to be
come absolved froai allegiance to their
nativo land, aud yet by a foreign resideuco
escapo any Ju&t duty aud contribution of
service to the country of their proposed
adoption. Thus, while evading the duties
of citizenship to tho United States, they
may muke prompt claim for its national
protection, and demand its intervention in
their behalf. International complications
of a serious nature arise und tho corres
pondence of the stto department discloses
tho great number and complexity of the
quostions which have been raised. Our
laws regulating tho issue of passports
should be carefully revised, und tho insti
tution of a central bureau of registration
at the capital is again strongly recommend
ed. LJy this means full particulars of
each case of naturalization in tho United
States would be secure! and properly re
corded, und thus many cases of spurious
citizenship would le detected and unjust
responsibilities would be avoided.
"Tho reorganization of the consular ser
vice is a matter of serious Importance to
our national interests. Tho number of ex
isting prinoipal consular officers is believed
to be greater than is at all nocessary for
tho conduct of the public business. It need
not bo our policy to maintain more than a
moderate number of principal officers, each
supported by a salary sufficient to enable
the Incumbent to live in comfort and so
distributed as to secure convenient super
vision over a considerable district. I re
peat tho recommendations heretofore mado
by me, that tho appropriations for tho
maintenance of our diplomatic and consular
service should be recast; that theso called
notarial or unofficial duties which our rep
resentatives abroad are now pcrmrttod to
treat as personal perquis'tes, should bo lor
bldden;that a system of consular inspec
tion should be instituted ; and that a limited
number of so :i etaries of legation at largo
should bo authorized."
Tho preparations for a centennial of tho
inaugura ion of Washington, to bo held at
New York, aro adverted to.
The message thea goes on to deal with
tho reports of the various departments,
heretofore sent out ly the press. The sur
plus io tho treasury is put at $104,000,00'.).
The money saved by purchase of bonds not
yot duo is put at t.T.l.tt.OiX). At first sight
this would sce.n to be a prolitable and sen
sible transaction on tho part of tho govern
ment, but as suggestod by the Eccrotary of
tho treasury, the surplus thus expended for
tho purchase of bonds was money drawn
from the peoplo in excess of any actual
need of tho government, and was so ex
pended rather than allowed to remain in
tho treasury. "If this surplus under the
operation of Just and equitable laws had
been left In tho hands of tho people, it
would havo been worth In their bus'ness at
least six per cent per annum. Deducting
from the amount of Interest upon tho prin
cipal end premium of theso bonds for tho
timo they had to run, at the rato of six per
cent, tho saving of two per cent made for
the people by tho purchaso of such bonds,
the loss will appear to l.o $V,7(V),000.
"With regard to silver coinage, tho sec
rotary of the treasury recommends the sus
pension of the further coinago of silver,
and in snch recommendation I earnestly
concur. For further valuable information
and timely recommendations, I ask tho
careful attention of the congress to tho sec
retary's report."
Tho reports ot tho war department are
given In abstract und the recommendations
concurred in. Tho death of (len. Sheridan
is spoken of thus: "Tho death of Gen.
Sheridan in August last was a nutlnnal
affliction. The army then lost tho grand
estorits chiots; tho country lixtnbnve
and experienced soldier, a wiso and discreet
counselor and a modest and sensible nir.n.
Thoso who in any marinor cumo within the
range of his personal association will never
fail to p iy deserved and willing horn ago to
his greatness and the glory of hiscareor;
but they will cherish with moro tender
cnsibllity tho loving memory of his simple,
generous und considerate nature."
Tho movement for tho return of tho Apa
che prisoners to their reservations is spok
en of as a dangerous and ill-Judged piece of
philanthropy.
Tho report of tho secretary of the navy Is
plven in abstract and tho recommendations
upproved. The same disposition is mado of
the postmHster general's report, published
to-day, and rocoiiimcndationsmadoof legis
lative read ustment of much of its machin
ery. The president favors Mr. Dickinson's
plan t o place the erection of postonico build
ings in tho hands of the department, on a
basis of busiuess done. Much legislation,
reasonable and proper at tho timo it was
made, is out of dato to day, and should bo
rcviBod for the benefit of the postal estab
lishment. Tho work of tho department of Justlco Is
related, special attention being oiled to the
prosecution, in Utah, of offenders pgainst
ant. -polygamy laws, and tho opinion is ex
pressed that under such a firm and vigilant
execution of these laws, and the advance of
ideas opposed to the forbid len practices,
polygamy within tho United States is virtu
ally at an end.
Secretary Vilas' report has ono f.'aturo
called attention to, that relatin-r to publio
lands "Wo havo no excuso for tho vio a
lion of principles cogently taught by reason
and example, uor for the allowance of pro
texts which havo sometimes exposed our
lands to colossal greed. Laws which open
tho door to fraudulent ncquisition.or admin
istration which permits favor to rapacious
seizure by a favored few of expanded ureas
that many should enjoy, are accessory to
offenses against our national welfare and
humanity.not to bo too sovcrely coudemned
or punished. Our dear experience ought
sufficiently to urgo the ppeedy tuactment ol
measures of legislation which will conlino
tho luturo disposition of our remaining
agricultural lands to tho uses of actual hus
bandry and genuine homes. Nor should our
vast tracts of so-called desert lands be yield
ed up to the monopoly of corporations or
grasping individuals, as appears to bo much
iho tendency under tho existing statuto
The hinds require but tho supply of water
tobeeomo fertilo und productive. It is a
problem of great moment how, mot wisely
for the public good, that factor shall bo
furnished. I cannot but think it perilous
to suffer either these lands or tho sources of
their irrigation to fall into the hands of
monopolies."
Legislation for tho adjustment of stato
grunts is recommended, in the equal inter
est of the nation, the states and the set
tlers. The failuro of the Sioux lnnd treaty is
soTatcd. The number of pensioners added
to the rolls during the fiscal yoar ended
Juno 3), lsv, is 'o.2Vj, and tho increase of
pensions was granted in 45.7(H) cases. Tho
names of 15,7() pensioners were drepited
from the rolls during the year for various
causes, ard at the close of tho year tho
number of persons of aM classes receiving
pensions was 452,.ro5. Of theso thero were
KX1 survivors of the war of 10,707
widows of thoso who served in that war,
pi.oo soldiers of tho Mexican wur and 5,104
widows of said soldiers. Ono hundred and
two different rates of pensions aro paid to
these beneficiaries, ranging from $J to
filtt 00 per month. Tho amount paid for
pensions during the fiscal year was $75, 777,
btil O'J. being an increase over tho preceding
year of $.,:,08,NX) 27.
"I am thoroughly convinced," the presi
dent says, "that our genernl pension laws
should bo revised and adjusted to meet as
far us possible, in tho light of our experi
ence, all meritorious cases. The fact that
10J different rates cf pensions
ar- paid cannot, in my opinion,
bo mado consistent with Jus
tice to tho pensioners, or to tho govern
ment; and tho numerous private pension
bids that are passed predicated upon tho
imperfection of tho ge""ral laws, which,

The work of tho asrioultural bureau is
rclated,and co-operation with tho states rec
ommended. The adjustment of tho relations between
the government and tho railroad companies
which have received land grants, and tho
guaranty of the public credit in aid of tho
construction of their roads, should rocoive
early attention, and be treated as a purely
businoss proposition. After making recom
mendations relative to tho District of Col
umbia, tho president concludes as follows:
"Tho consciousness that I have presented
but nn imperfect statement of the condition
of tho country and its wants occasions no
four that anything omitted is not kuown
and appreciated by tho congress, upon
which rest the responsibility of intelligent
legislation in behalf of a great nation and u
confiding people. As public servants, we
shall do our duty well ir wo constantly
