SUB COMMERCIAL AXD riXABCIAL
MITI'ATION.
The clearinghouse BtatenicnU of the
List financial week, as classified by the
Kew York Public, present a general: same
ness with those of several preceding
weeks. Ten cities report gains, generally
l uiall, the greater number show losses
1 ot U on the week and the month. Thofe
:it New York and Pittsburg are unusually
ire. The decline must certainly indicate
.shrinkage in the quantity of products
1 - irnsf erred, as well as in value. The
m onthly statement is especially unfavor
i.i le to Pittsburg, partly because of the in
"i:ti.ion this time last year in oil operations,
! nt the decrease in other business has
) in considerable. Memphis exchanges
r how a gain of 6.3 per cent over
j i.it year on the week, and G.l per
nt. on the month. (Stock seculation
id much to do with the shrinkage
sit New York, but the facta show
3 iiat a great deal of the business formerly
'oue there has been diverted to other
3 uinU, and it is probable that the shrink
age is rather in the place of payment than
in the volume of business transacted. The
J'uhlic in pointing out this state of facts
Jemarked: ''If the interior cities have be
come better supplied with money than
formerly, and so have acquired such finan
cial relations with the business of the
"Western and Southern States that a larger
part of the payments made each year are
luade without the use of the "Sew York
Exchange, the consequence would be that
upon the same amount of purchases and
payments the exchanges at New York
would be less, and the exchanges at other
points greater than before." In this way
there is increase of exchanges elsewhere
without a corresponding increase of busi
ness, and a decrease at New York without
a corresponding loss of business. But
alter tne most liDeral a.lowance it is evi
dent that the volume of New York
transactions has materially decreased.
This apparent independence of the interior
upon a cential point cannot but be ad
vantageous in time of convulsion. When
that center is embarrassed there must be
universal panic; but where there are a
number of centers, each of which can op
pose some resistance to the storm, the ca
lamity may become greatly modified and
its evil consequences decreased. The
troiier monetary resources of the inte
rior must add to the power of the coun
try's commerce to resist or overcome pres
sure. The supply of money increases not
mly in the banks but elsewhere. The
j'uiiur says: "Literally tins market is
running over witli idle money. The
orted reserve, though it already reaches
SSTi.-I.jSjOOO, does not by any means repre
sent the whole of the money that is here
available. Much more is coming, too, in
disbursements from the Treasury.' Here it
is worth calling attention toa fact that is, we
believe, unprecedented in our history at a
tune when there was no panic prevailing
we see more capital available than there
is a demand for. "IV hen before, nt a time
clear of panic, was this the case? Want
of capital has been the great obstruction
to tins advance of American enterprise.
Has not pome subtle change como that
i aiiital pnw lies idle? . And is not the re
strictive effect of our protective system nt
the bottom of this significant change?
Another f ict the Public mentions demands
attention. It says: "The tendency of
Treasury orders is to collect vast amounts
nt money here, while scattering vast
amount. of certificates over the country."
Here is a singular combination of facts.
-At tlio Very time the interior is carrying
on its biiHiness from its own monetary
csourccs more than it had ever done
'telore, its money is assuming a form that
ill shrink to eighty-livo cents upon
ii dollar the first time momentary convul
: on strikes us, while the more substantial
irrencv lows back to the principaj money
liters. There is a play of centrifugal
ad centripetal forces here that is well
orth the attention of financiers. Another
'"iticeable fact is mentioned by the Public
i a consequence of the increased ccrtitl
'ite issue. It says: "Hence, it is not
. n prising that the demand for bank notes
'irinks. It is clear that the
' anks are not linding enough use for cur-
eiicy to make them desire to retain circu-
1 .it inn at the expense of buying high
priced bonds." Of the business part of
Jie Presidents message the Public pithily
remarks: "In respect to the questions of
taxation ami finance, it will be found
puzzle and a disappointment." Turning
to the review of the last financial week, as
;:iven in t lie New York Clironicle, we find
it referring to Kelley's bill for suspending
the coinage of silver dollars, a measure it
thinks necessary to prevent the future
outflow ' of gold, which would leave
us, and wo would have to bear
the loss arising from our finunciul
system resting on a silver basis, and says:
"A vague fear that such a result is im
pending, is paralyzing all. our industries,
the proverbial timidity of capital mani
festing itself in an entire absence of enter
prise, while our savings banks and trust
companies are full of deposits, and money '
in abundance is ollcring at almost man-
inal rates for temporary investments." As
the Aitkai. has expected, the "mysteri- j
mis" influences that produced a business
depression without panic, arc coming to
he understood, an unsettled tariff and a
depreciated currency are two main factors
without a donbt, the prospect of a possi
ble decrease in the bank note circulation
is another, Far-seeing men are cautions
where such contingencies threaten the fu
ture. The ITironicIc summarizes the charac
ter of the week's business as follows : "The
most prominent fact in the general com
mercial and financial situation now and
for that matter for the hist year and a half
is that profits are exceedingly small in
almost every line of business. This is not
only true as regards every kind of dealing
in and manufacture of marketablo com
modities (or consumption, but is as true
u1m in regard to the employment of bank
capital in loans and other forms of tempo
lary investments. There is but one ex
ception to the general rule, in the not
earnings of the railroads, which are larger,
pi r-itninately, than the nek profits of
other kinds hf twtgines."

The bloody-shirt Stalwarts, the protec
tionists, the monopolists and all the mon
eyed powers that ;row rich on the hard

frighten the people into continued sub
mission to their unjust exactions. They

the two article published elsewhere iu
;le Ari'KAl. one from the Sew York Hrr
' ( and the other from the St. Louis Kqmb
'. in. If the lVmocratic party had
dirked the issues it has made it
wuld have proven recreant to its
inly and unworthy of its historic
. no as the party of the people,
l i t it has the courage to practice what it
i reaches, to make successful its convic
; us. Knun this time forward the issue
II be broad and distinct, and the con
' t will tie sharp and decisive. Thepreo-
nt overwhelming I emocrat ic majority
is elected to Congiess for a purpose, and
il.ere must lie no retreat from the profes-
ions and pledges made during tlie cam
;aign. The one thing which lias tended
more than all others to bring politics into
iisgrace is the obvious discrepancy be
i ween campaign promises and the ier-
formanees after the election. The people
are weary of pretentious humbnggery. The
issues which the Democrats championed
liefore the election are the issues which
searate the IHunocrats from the Republi
cans, and the Iemocrat who shirks the is
sue is a renegado to the party which
allures' into its support only to betray.
Courage is the duty of the hour. The
leople must not be frightened by the
racket of those who enrich themselves by
legislation which discriminates against one
industry for the benefit of auother. It
the moneyed power is to be .believed the
country is going to the bow-wows on ac
count of the election of Carlisle. But the
people have shown that they cannot be
frightened by such humbugjtery. The
new Speaker is patriot and statesman, a
safe man who will do nothing to paralyze
the 'great interests of the country. ' The
people are told that he is a rampant free-
trader. But he fives the lit) to this cuu-
sation by pointing to the Tilden and Han
cock Democratic . Dlatforma which he
indorsed and still indorses. The
country is told tbat Carlisle, is a rebel,
was disloyal to the government and that
his election means the payment of the
Confederate debt and the emancipation
slaves and all that kind of tomfoolery,
when the fact is Carlisle was a Union
man during the war. In taking the oath
as Speaker and member of Congress, he
had the option of taking the . iron
clad or the modified oath. With the
choice before him he took and i sub
scribed to the Ironclad oath, thus swear
ing that he had not participated in the
rebellion, and had not given "aid, coun
sel, countenance or encouragement to
persons engaged in rebellion. This oath
proves that he was a' Union man daring
the war, and now that the rebellion is
crushed and the Union cause, which he
espoused, triumphed, it is not likely
that he will do anything in aid
of the rebellion or to destroy the Union,
which he supported when the life of the
nation was imperiled. War issues have
nothing to do with the election of John G.
Carlisle to the Speakership. He was elected
solely in response to thunders of the peo
ple in demanding that heavy and unneces
sary burdens now imposed on them be
lifted from their shoulders. As the Balti

therefore, uion which Mr. Carlisle was selected

ofthe Democratic party. But it does not mean iree

simply means a modified tariff". We hold that it
is the part or statesmanship, as well as patriot

protectionists policy, ana 11 is in opposition to
this policy that Mr. Carlisle was elected Speaker.
the purpose indicated in his selection is to lessen
tariff taxes, instead of keeping Ihcm up. The
idea is to keep out of the Treasury vast sum of
surplus revenue, the collection nf which is an
outrage and an oppression on the people. It
weans that heavy tariff taxation shall not be kept

schemes and squandering with indiscriminate
recklessness the publie money. It moans that

pressed lor the benefit of a lew rich men.
With such an issue before the country
the people need have no fears as to the re
sult. If fce Democratic party proves cour
ageous and firm in its convictions it will
achieve a brilliant victory in its efforts to
save the people from burdens which op
press them for the benefit of the moneyed
power.
THE KEL1.EY KILTER BILL.
The subject of suspending the coinage
of the eighty-five cent silver dollar has
been brought before Congress by Mr.
Kelley. In an interview he has given the
N'ew York Titncs his reasons for this step.
Three-fifths of the Bilver produced by our
mines is kept out the Kuropean market,
coined and laid by uselessly in vaults that
are made at much expense for its recep
tion. The silver dollar was adopted for
the purpose, among other purposes, of in
ducing the Kuropean nations to use silver
as well as gold as a standard metal for cur
rency. The effect of our holding so large
.in amount of silver out of the market,
however, is to make it easier for those na
tions to sustain gold as the only standard
metal for currency. ' The standard of the
Knglish possessions in the Kast Indies is
lilver, and the rupee of that metal circu
lating there was equal to two shillings Kng-
lish fifty cents. Owing to the increased
quantity, and consequent decreased value
uf silver, the value of the rupee went down
to'onc shilling and seven pence half-penny,
r forty cents. If we stop the coinage of
silver dollars, and tho three-lifths of the
vield of silver we now retain is thrown
upon the market, the change M ill tend
till further to reduce the valuo of the
rupee, and to that extent embarrass En
,'lih commerce, and thus induce the Kn
lirih to rescue the rupee by aiding to re-establish
silver as a standard and so restore
its circulating and-market value. This is the
object Judge Kellcy has in view. Whether
this view be correct or not we will not now
inquire. In either case, the suspension of
coining silver dollars, for which there is
no demand, and the quantity of which is
beyond the demand for silver certificates,
is clearly desirable. Silver is bought as a
"protection" to the American silver pro
duction, and the purchase is subject to all
the objections that lie against a protection
i hat is not for the benefit of the nation,but of
favored capitalists and monopolists. What
ever may be the force of Judge Kelley's
position, the reasonableness of suspending
the coinage of the silver dollar is obvious.
A possible danger to financial stability is
connected with it, and with the certificates
that represent it. That danger is that, in
ue of those- contingencies so common
imivl commercial fluctiiatious, there may
'to a rush for gold. When that occurs and
the Treasury has paid out all the gold
available, it must have recourse to pay
ments in silver. The moment it does so
the silver dollar will go down to its bullion
value, eighty-fivo cents, certificates and
Treasury notes will do the same,, and
panic and disaster -must follow snch a
change in the currency. Here lies one
Treat reason of our present business de
gression; aud consequently it is of ex
treme importance- that the coinage of sil
ver dollars should be suspended tbierCon

TRK PEARCT CROP.
The peanut business of tliq South prom
ises to become an important one, tho "yield
this year is estimated to be of the value of
;,000,000. Of this quantity Virginia
grew 2,400,000 bushels, Tennessee L'TS.OOO,
North Carolina 135,000'and Alabama 23o,

of production. The nut came originally
from Africa, and itd production here is so
profitable that before long the country
will cease to import them. The nut id not
the only useful product of the plant; no
part is wasted, even the. shells are bought
by the Jyery stablvor horse-liedding, as

a miri devoted to the business. This flour
is used by confectioners in making peanut
candy, and has the reputation of making
afvery palatable kind ot biscuit, which
tastes something like cocoantit but is
richer and sweeter. Tho cultivation of
the peanut pays about equal to that of
cotton, but is less laborious and requires
less attention. Here is another product
which, in addition to the small fruits and
early vegetables, promises to help "the
South to deliverance from that Bourbon
curse, "all cotton." The Tennessee nut
is equal to any grown, but brings less than
the Virginia in the market, because less
care is taken to sort it and put it in the
beat condition for sale, a defect that should
lie remedied.

MART AXDERSOX'S "GALATEA."
All Her Previous Soeeemes Surpassed
London, December 8. Mary Anderson's
previous successes Were to-night surpassed
by her performance as "Galatea," when
her ease and grace wore shown to especial
advantage by the classic severity of the
Athenian costume. Her absolutely per
fect interpretation of naitv innocence fairly
enraptured the fashionable audience that
to-night crowded the pit and gallery.
When the bewitchingly beautiful statue of
"Galatea" was unveiled the public seemed
completely taken bv surprise, and razed a
few moments in silent admiration, as if
spellbound, and then spontaneously burst
into a storm of applause. At the end of
the nrst act the charming American ac
tress was called three times before the cur
tain and showered with exquisite bouquets,
several of which were trimmed with red,
wriite ana blue streamers.
Tne play was mounted in the traditional
artistic excellence of the Lyceum. "Pyg
malion's" studio was ornamented with an
appropriate profusion of statuary and
works ol art ot tne highest merit, the
last act, where "Galatea" realizes that her
love can only bring calamity on those on
whom it was lavished, was greeted with
shouts of approval. The performance, in
lact, was a succession of cameos of extra
ordinary beauty, of which Miss Anderson
was the center. Miss Amy Roselle, as
'Pygmalion's" wife, acted with great force
and discrimination. The linal,verdict was
most enthusiastically favorable.

ANNIHILATED.
Another Esrypllan Foree lsestroyed by

Cairo, December 10. News was re
ceived at Aden that a great force of hill
rilies attacked five companies of F.gvptian
troops, which were reconnoitcring outside
Niakun on the th instant. Severe light
ing ensued. The. Egyptians were com
pletely annihilated and their artillery cap
tured. The defeat proves that tho rebels
are firmly established in Soutli Suakim, on
1 lie .Berber frontier, lhe news of the re
volt at Sennaar leads to daily expectations
of the attack on Dongar and Khartoum.
ANOTHER ACCOUNT.
Another account of the Ksrvptian de
feat at Suakim on the 5th instant savs:
Spies entered Suakim Unit rvnorted thnt
hill men were hovering near the town.
On hearing this, Mahmoud Topes Pasha,
anxious to efface the defeat at Tokkar of
the bth ultimo, on account of which a
court-martial pending, sent forward 500
biacK troops and 200 Isaslu Bazouks
against the Hill tribes. He himself re
mained at Suakim. Ata distance of three
hours march from the town the Kgyptians
were attacked bv several thousand men.
The Kgyptians fought stubbornly, but
were cut to pieces. Fifty, of whom half
were oflicers, escaped. This defeat of the
troops hitherto regarded as the flower of
the army, caused great consternation here,
as it tends to show that the task of open
ing a route from Su-tkim to Berber with
the material at Baker Pasha's disposal is
nearly hopeless.
The blacks fought back to back in
groups or pairs, some with clubbed mus
kets. Many rebels were killed. The fight
occurred on the 1 instant. Forty-live
men had returned to Suakim bv the 4th,
including fifteen cavalrymen and two
otiicers, with ten wounded blacks.
Twenty ' cavalrymen accompanied the
Kgyptian foree which was defeated near
Suakim on the tith instant with a loss of
two men. There were two European
oflicers with tlie force, and the whole
were under the command of an Egyptian
major. The surviving otiicers say thev
were surrounded by 5000 men. The
Kgyptians formed a square, the black
troops being stationed on three faces and
the Bashi Bazouks on the fourth face of
the square. The latter fell back, throwing
the blacks into disorder. The blacks
fought with great bravery. One gun and
all the arms and ammunition were lost.
In consequence of the disaster the garri
son at Suakim is reduced to 1000 men.
Dervishes are appearing in I'pper Kgvpt,
who proose to preach a holy war. The
whole country beyond Egypt proper is
ablaze. .
A SIWK1M DISPATCH
says there is a panic among Egyptian offi
cials. The fall of the garrisons at Tokarand
Sinkat is expected daily, owing to starva
tion. It is stated that' Othman, chief of
slave dealers, was killed in fight. The
British ship Ranger, holds this town, and
there is no fear for the safety of Europeans.

The exhibit this week is an unexpect
edly favorable one, both when compared
with last week and with the correspond
ing week last year. The gain is mostly at
the leading trade centers, and while there
has been no great improvement in specu
lative dealings it must be ascribed to a
better feeling in legitimate trade.

Aberdeen, Columbus and West Point,

loyalty enough to see many good reasons
why West Point should have the honor.

Regular Correspondence of the Appeal.
Birmingham, December 8. Now that
the Posey matter has reached a peaceful
conclusion, the public and the papers are
occupied with reviews ol the whole trou
ble. The opinions expressed in these re
views ditler widely, out most ot them are
pnt caustically enongh. Almost every
body finds somebody or something to
blame either the sheriff, for not taking
the prisoner ont of the county as soon as
he was caught, for not relying on a civil
pome to protect htm instead of calling lor
troops, or lor not making a vigorous enort
earlier, calling for troops if necessary, to
repress unlawful agitation and violence
the judge, for conceding too much to the
mob or lor not conceding enongh : public
sentiment, for not more sternly rebuking
tne lawlessness tn its mctpiency, or any
one oi a dozen other persons
conditions. The claraorers for lynching
are too badly whipped out to say much
but there is an opinion, concurred in by
some who were opposed to lynching, that
the massing of the troops here will do the
town more harm than any number of
mobs like that of last Monday night
would do. The most prevalent fehng,
however, among la -abiding citizens. a
one of satisfaction that lawleasneiss n
been suppressed; albeit not by ie wisest
cuon in every respecv sums ivt
the costliness of the course pursued by
tbe authorities one ot its most fortunate
features, as showing that the State intends
to uphold the law at any cost. As to a
call for troops, it appears now that no
reauisition. in a strict sense, was! made.
and that such request as was made came
from the sheriff, and not from' Judge
Spratt, as has been published, and the
sending of so strong a force was the Gov- .
ernor's and Col. Jones's idea.
A proposal has been made by a repre
sentative of New York capital to build the
Birmingham and Northwestern road to
Corinth. The proposal has been forward
ed to Col Sam Tate, jr., president of tlie
road, and as it is a very fair one. the pros
pects are bright for the early building of
the road.
Considerable capital has been invested
in coal lands in this district lately. A Cin
cinnati syndicate has bought 10.000 acres
in Fayette county, and down in Sumter
county a party of Englishmen are making
extensive purchases.
It is said that the grand jury is still
finding indictments against the leaders in
last Monday riight's lawlessness. Several
arrests have been made, and there is a ru
mr to-day that one of the most prominent
men in the mob has gone to Mexico.

lNov, when the lemo-rat saw tbat they were
about to be deposed. They had nothing to offer
the people; they no longer careu, nor were aoie,
to serve the country. Like the Republicans
now. they wished only to retain power;
and so they raised tlio cry ot uinunion
thcT valli-d them'Ive-" ' t uion caver?,
and denouueri th Republicans us "Abolition

Kcpublican "tree trade cry now. ltwrm
neither truth nor pence in thin cry, iu one ce or
the other, aud tha only intention wm then and
now to misrepresent, and by mi representation to
scare timid and stupid voters.
1 he leiuocrats ouieiit to take courage rrom tne
extremity to which the Republican areevidently
reduced, lbev need not n-a inr neuer evidence
that in the election of Mr. Carlisle they have
struck the right track thau is furnished them
the foolish uutcne: ol the KeDUbiicant.
It will be the fault of JJcmoeratictimidity if the
ridiculous preten.oe of a "solid South' .apainiit a
"solid iorh makes the leust headway. tuc'i a
f.tlH iflMiiA cannot it' the Iremocratu are onlv
attentive to the people's funta and calmly innift
on the true issue. Vhnt the pe"pli of this coun
try want is the repeal of necilios Uixes- the
abolition of a furnltis revenue, which exists only
for the benefit of lobbyist!, and tlie breakinir
down of that thine.-"e wll of extreme protection

the Democrats, in their turn, aim to moderate
the oppressive and barbnrous war tariff, reduce
the people's taxes and strike off po tne of the
shackles under which both production and com
merce are prostrate, the Republicans, in their
turn, rmse tlie equally tttupid cry of f ree
traders!" If the Peiuocrats only do their clear
lutv to the oroide, aa under lhe lcadorhin of Air.
Carlisle and his friends they can do, this cry will
not alarm anybody.
The Republican n;irty has lost the initiative. It
haa been too l,njr in power, and hna ceased to
serve the people. It alliance is with capitalists
and monopolists; its friend are no longer the
people, out a lew rich men who hare fattened on
the nrivileres it has err an ted them and who hun

like one of its orrans, the 2VVmm.-, which, in the

an imiMiverished people to support a handful of
favored and wealthy private intercuts. W e advise
the Republicans to take a lesson from the past.
md be crelul not to cirrv tiicir upiKrittou to
necessary reforms too far. lest the people, en
