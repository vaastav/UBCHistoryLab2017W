One of (he Fullu-ie$ of the Abo
litionists. "
The Abolition pulpit slang-whangers,
President Lincoln and the presses of
the irrepressible conflict class declare
that slavery is the cause of the war,
and that,' until it shall be abolished,
we can not ' have, peace. ", We are 'not
able to see it in that light. ( If slavery
is the cause of the war, so is property
the cause' of theft. "If w ithout slavery
we 'should not have war, so we can say,
without property1. there 'would bo no
theft. Slavery -of itself would no more
have produced war than does property
of itself produce theft. Both con exist
without necessarily producing war or
theft,, Evil passions, evil desires, dis
regard of obligations, make war and
beget theft out of what in themselves
would produce neither." i?'
If negro shivery is the ' cause of the
war, why did it not produce war for the
past severity years? It had existed in
more or less of the States since the or
ganization of the Government,'' and
produced no war. There had been
fourteen ' different " Administrations Of
the Federal Govcnimeatj , ' covering V
period of seventy years, and during the
who!j of , which slavery had existed,,
and vet no war Was nroduced bv ln,'.

The.vhola thing was changed as soon
as the people of the free States elected
sectional President on purely nti
slavery grounds of hostility .to a pe
cuuar uomestic institution ot sonyj .ftJb
teen Southern States. That was the
real, true cause of tlie jvarj slavery was
not,- any , more , than ; is property ( the
cause of theft. 'Property excites the
bad. to secure, its 'possession' by fraud
and violence; fit does riotvcxcita such

WAsutsoTOjt, Dec. iJ.
SEVAtic The chair laid before the Sen
ate a communication from the Secretary of
War in answer to a resolution calling for in
foimalion in relation to the sale of colored
freemen captured by the rebels. The reply
of Secretary Stanton states that no informa
tion on the subject is in tho possession ol Ihe
War Department.
Mr. Sterman presented a petition in favor
of ft general bankrupt act.
Mr. Davis piesented two petitions protest
ing agninstthe action of the Advisory Board
of the Navy.
Mr. Summer, from the committee on For
eign Relations, roportod a bill for the relief of
the owners of the French vessel Jules et Ma
ne. "
Mr. Anthony, from the committee on Print
ing, reported a bill to increase the bonds of
the Superintendent of Printing.
Mr. Halo introduced a bill to abolUh the
grade of Medical officers in the service olthe
United States. .
The resolution offered by Mr. Saulsbury
relative to arbitrary arrest of citizens of Del
awnre, was taken up.
Mr. Halo said the Senator from Delaware
(Dayard) yesterday referred to a proper divi
sion of power as being the hope of a free Gov
ernment, nnd he (Hale) was not willing to
see the Senate 'interfere with other depart
ments. If any cit zen of Delaware has been
aggrieved, the courts were still open, and he
believed the writ of habeas con us was not
dead vet. . 11c acknowledged this was an cm
barra-MPg question.- ' u
llr. 'Bayard said there was no such divi
sion ol Government power;' the Judiciary
was always the weakest. The President
has asserted the right- to suspend tlie writ of
habeas corpus;' end he thought it proper
for the Semite to inquire into the matter.
' Ir. Wilson of Massachusetts said: Doubt
less evrybody regretted, the necessity of ma
king these artests in this country the Pres
ident regrttod it as much as anybody, lie
did not think any ' loyal man could charge
the President with' wantonly violating the
right of citizens. Fir a long time the lead,
ing traitors sat' here, but no arrests were
made. When they were commenced they
were necessjrV, and the first arrest was for
selling gun caps to the enemy. " He, for one,
thanked the President for making' these ar
rests. It was a powerful means of preserving
the Government, and he hoped the President
and his advisors won Id not shrink from ar
resting any man Who shows protb!e cause
of being in league with' the robela.:. There
was never a rebellion where so much con
sideration had been shown and so much tu
maiity for traitors. ";- -': ..n' : .
'. Mr. Saulsbury did not doubt there were
made which were justifiable, but these men
were citizen ol Delaware, whose loyalty had
nover been questioned. 'jo; .sk-i
, The motion to lay on the' table was rJisa
greed to by a vote Of three yeas to forty hays.
Mr. Fiold said he should -vote against the
resolution., He was of opinion that the Pres
ident had the light to suspend the writ 'of
habeas corpus.' ITU framers of the Consti
tution evidently provided that the habeas
corpus might be suspended fo tiae f insure
rectiooand Invasion, ana ne thought it was
clearly an Exxcutiye acr He was of opinion
that If any complkiDt was to bt jsade, it was
lenient
1 to tiattorg.
Mr. Bayard continued at some length,
"J10? ,h PW8r 1 suspend the writ of ha

i ,hlg was admitted, and the legislative power
I n( n0 r'Knt 10 inquire, theh the President
mht ""P"8"" "'en. or torture them, or do
as he pleased With them.
Mr. Sherman favored the adoption of
these resolutions of inquiry, which were
ctfered in gocd faith. He believed the
right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
was purely a legislative power, and it could
onlv be done bv Concress: but since tho le-
islutinn nf thf Ih( rtrtnvrasj 1 1. Prgniit1Ti I

had the power given to him. He thought
many bf these, arrests Were great mistake,
nd every arrest ought to be reported to
Congress and the reasons for it. If this
power was unlimited, the Gotiernment
would become oppressive. The people have
been exasperated at the manner of these ar
rests and discharges, and it was due to the
country and justice that no man should be
arrested for light causes, and that the cane
and charges should be properly explained;
and Congress bad a perfect right to call for
all information, that thry may go before the
the people and explain and dufbed those ar
rests..
Mr. Trumbull said, as he could not see any
particular benefit to b attained in passing
mese resolutions, iia was, inclined to vote
against thorn. He thought those arrests Had
been unfortunate and-impolitic Judges and
courts and commentators iave held that the
power of suspending the WriJ of habeas cor
pus was a legislative power.- It is cot from
any spnipathy with traitors thit there is
great leelir.g cpon the sulject, but because
it is feared this is an exercise of an unncces
cary and arbitrary power, and he would
say to his friend Wilson, who gloried in
these arrests, that there Was very great
danger in them. There was a bill now here
from the Ilouse relative to this very subject,
and ho was io lavorof acting upon that as a
practicle measure. . ,
Mr. Powell said the Fiosident had no
right to make these arrests or to su-pend the
Writ of habeas Corpus, at d doing so war
usurpation. He contended that the people
had decided that these arrests should cease.
The recent elections showed this. -.
llr. Wil son claimed that no such question
was settled by the elections. The only thing
settled was that the Kepublican party conld
not raise men enough to send to the field to
whip Southern trators, and still have men
enough horns to vote down Northern

at length.
ng the question the Senate adjourned.
'diousK. The Ilouse considered Senate
1 for the admission of the slate of estern
Virginia into the Union.
Mr. Conway said he did not regard the
proposition as now presented as having re
ceived the assent required by the Constitu
tion. West Virginia was not a lawful State,
tie believed it wag the intention of the Pres
ident to encourage State organizations ia all
the seceded States, but placing the' assump
tion of the State in the hands of a few indi
viduals appointed by the President, was
llagrant and unconstitutional. Tho scheme
was revolutionary, and ought to be exposed
to the reprobation of every loyal citizen. It
would be an utier perversion of our erstem.
It would in effect concentrate all the power
of the Government in the hands of the tx
eeil'ive. I
Mr. Ilrown of Viraiiia, retl;ed. areuina
the erection ol the S aie of West Virginia
was perfe tly lawful and constitutional.-
The provision of the Constitu.ional in regard
to the admissiun or erection of new States
had been complied with, and this connection
he quoted as sjmil.ir the preamble and act
admitting Kentucky, which was formed from
part of Virginia. Precedents, he insisted,
supported the new State organisation. ;
Mr. Mallory said I understand that more
than hall the counties of Virginia were not
represented in the Wheeling Legislature.
Mr. lllairol Virginia asked, Were not 11
the counties invited?
Mr. biown All were exprestly invitod.
Mr. Mallury Although they were invited
were not some of them s completely within
the control ol a foreign government that they
could not send representatives to the Legis
latures? Mr. Drown I can't say whether the peo
ple were under intimidation or not. It is suf
ficient to say that they wore invited to come.
If they strfitl a'a.v it was their fault, not ours
If they were disloyal, ihtsv could have no
voire in the Legislature of Virginia.
lietore Mr. brown concluded, the morn
ing hour expired, vr ben the House took up
the fpecial order, authorising assessors and
celtectoi s and their assistants under the tax
law to administer oaths, ect.
Tlie bill passed.
Mr. Brown resumed his remarks in advo
cacy of the bill for the admission of the State
of West Virginia. He staled various consid
erations why the Slate should be admitted
as a matter ot expediency. The people of
that section had been struggling lor lorty
years for a st perate existence. They now
bad sixteen regiments in the field, obtained
by volunteering, not by draft. -
Mr. Collax remarked that at tho last ses
sion he bad great doubts as to the' propriety
of passing this bill. Do examination his mind
was made up that it ought to pass.
Mr. Crittooden appreciated, the patriotism
and valor of the pcop'lb bl West Virginia,
and the desire which they expresssd to be
come a free people; but on this matter he
was uolgoerned by feelings, but by the prin
ciples of constitutional law. Congress could
not admit a new Stale out of the ancient ter
ritory, without tho asent of the old com
uionwcalth; and this had not been civen.
If Statos 'should be made in the method pro
posed, new ones could be made at pleasure,
irrusfxetive of the Constitution bf the Uoit
States. ' r. .
