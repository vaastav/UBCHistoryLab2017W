!f- bill •which was passed this afternoon after
m^ o nder consideration for three days.
-gcotslor. of the question of salaries for Con
| -gssaien and povernment rials excited an
fiscal degree of interest among the members.
la.-£e number of arkMsl took advantage of the

to be paid out < I dH Legislative, Executive and

jjai there was a noticeable stir among- the
= «sbers on Mm Soot, and a long debate fol
jp^ed. On a rail of the roll the vote stood 108

I*£islatcrs who advocate increasing thejr sal

electicn— will not prevail in the Senate, and it is
♦height probable that the provision will be in
carpcraied In the legislative bill in the tipper
bbssa.
mi«: Mr. LtttasMT presented the amendment
ttigir.s the salaries of the Vice-President and
Ike Epeaker to $12,000 a year, he spoke of the
durri* T "' the p'.ace of the Speaker, and said
♦Jja: everybody recognized that the duties were
arduous and the pay was Insufficient. Mr.
ri^erwood. of Alabama, Eaid that he was op
pos«: to ary further' increase of salaries along
the line of legislative and executive offices. He
lelirred '.:.'■■ salaries of the minor clerks of the
paanaaCßl should be increased on account of
the increased cost of livii^. His contention was
that 6.....T as are paid to members of Congress
so that a poor rr^.n might come to Congress and
represent his constituents. He said he would
tct cor.:ens that a Congressman could live in
TTafhlrgtoa and keep pace •with modern
to-.--:
Mr. Fttrgerald, of New York, said he would
rote tax the increase, even If the price he paid
was pcl!tica! oblivion. He called attention to
the zzlzr.es cf tha Mayor and Controller of
tm York. ar.d Insisted that the Vice-President
and the Speaker Efcouid receive salaries com
inenr--. with the dignity of their offices.
After ether speeches the amendment was
tdepted ty a vote of 214 to DL the opposition
Ta.'"rg to tain votes enough to call the yeas
iM nays.
Sir. Littauer then introduced another amend-
Eer.t, as follows:
On and after March 4. 1907, the compensa
tion cf heacs of executive departments who are
aenbers cf the President's Cabinet shall be at
the rate cf $H\ouo per annum each.
In his remarks on th'.s amendment Mr. Lit
ttaer held up a large ; tare of a president of
a bo^ebcll association whose salary had been
2xr*asec! from $10,w0 to $10,000 a year, and
ccrtriated that with the salaries of members
c! the Cabinet.
The sjr.ezxirv.ent was opposed by Mr. Mann, of
Illinois, but was adopted by a vote of 204 to 60.
The amendment so closely concerning th»»
rjenbers themselves followed immediately after
the atneniir.er.t raising the salaries of members
cf the Cabinet.
Sic. Littauer. who retires to private life with
the close cf the present Congress, offered
the provision raising tne salaries of Senators
asfl members of Congress, Delegates and the
resident commissioner from Porto Rico to
(~i&j>j. and en agreement the time fixed upon
Jor tie increase to begin was March 4, 1907.
Mr. BonxeU. of Illinois, said he was opposed
to the proposition to increase salaries of mem
bers, but was glad to vote to increase the com
pensation of the Speaker, Vice-President and
nembors cf the Cabinet.
Mr. Clark, cf Florida, was cheered when he
•aocr. that he desired to discuss the ques
tion from the point of view of a poor man. He
called attention to the fact that men are leaving
the gorvlce of the country and returning to pri
vate Hfej solely becnupe th^ salary they receive
la c£c* if inadequate. - I believe," he said,
"tivre are r.ot ten m*n on this floor 1 ho in pri

he would Qualify next Monday as an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court, and th«» changes
In the President's official family resulting 1 from

"These fellowa are In a hurry to take their
places in their new positions," said Mr. Moody
with a laugh as he left tha Cabinet meeting
with Secretaries Bonaparte and MetcaJf.
"I wonder of the Increased salary hasn't some
thing to do with this precipitate change ?" asked
Mr. Bonaparte.
"Not at all," retorted Sir. Moody; '"I nm doing
this solely for your sake."
As the result of the leavetaklng of Mr. Moody

SUBSIDY GOES OVER.
Message from President Expected
Committee Action Postponed.
[From th* Tribune Bureau.]
Washington, Dec 14— With the understanding
that the President ■will send a special message
to Congress on the subject of ship subsidy, the
Republican members of the Committee on Mer
chant Marine agreed to-day to postpone action
on the Shipping bill under consideration by the
committee until January 7. The announcement
that the President would send a message re
garding subsidy was made by Representative
Watson, of Indiana, to his associates on the
committee, and it was immediately determined
to defer action until Congress meets after the
holidays, by which time the President's views
will have been sent to Congress officially. It
is expected that President Roosevelt will am
plify the statement in his message regarding
subsidy, where he said It war; especially urgent
that government aid should be given to encour
age better transportation facilities with South
America. Subsidy advocates in the House will
meanwhile continue their efforts at persuasion,
and General Grosvenor's amended bill, which
outs off all subsidies except for South American
and riental lines, will be generally circulated
so that members may become familiar with its
provisions.
BLOW TO ALCOHOL TRUST.
Denaturing Regulations To Be
Amended by Commissioner Yerkes.
I From The Tribune Bumau.]
Washington. Dee. — The Commissioner of
Internal Revenue is about to issue an order
amending the regulations providing for the de
naturing of alcohol, which, it Is believed, will
bring grief to the alcohol trust. When Mr.
Yerkes first issued his regulations providing for
the denaturing of alcohol, he stipulated that at
least 10 per cent of wood alcohol must be added
to the pure product. Since Issuing those regu
lations, however, the commissioner has been
informed that the alcohol trust has obtained
complete control of the wood alcohol industry
and has be«-n preparing to nullify all beneficial
effect expected from the competition of the de
natured product by maintaining at an exorbitant
point the price of the only article winch can
b*t used for denaturing purposes. To remedy
this condition of affairs, Mr. Yerkes baa now.
after seeking the advice of experts, prepared a
new set of regulations which require the use of
only 8 per cent of wood alcohol, and it is ex
pected that this revision will make it Impossible
for the alcohol trust to render entirely nugatory
all the beneficial results expected from the free
alcohol law The new regulations will probably
be promulgated next Monday.

NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE, SATURDAY. DECEMBER 15. 1000.
A STAXDARD MONOPOLY.
Secretary Hitchcock on Indian Coal
and Oil Lands.
Washington, Dec. ».— Secretary Hitchcock to-day
added his view to those which have been gathered
in the Indian Territory by the special Senate com
mittee authorized to investigate the property rishts
and citizenship situation of the Five Civilized
Tribes. Considerable time was devoted in an en
deavor to arrive at the value of the coal lands of
these tribes, which has been variously estimated
at from $15,000,000 to between $4,000,000,000 and
£,OOO,O<*>.OOO. It was stated that an appropriation
was expected to be made by the government for
the purchase of these lands by the new state of
Oklahoma.
The Secretary was unable to place a value on
the lands. The Geological Survey bad estimated
the deposits to contain nearly three billion tons of
coal, while the government mmmg 1 inspector for
the territory placed the amount at one and one
quarter billion tons. The Secretary regarded the
latter estimate as more nearly correct. He added
that a fair price for the mineral rights might be
arrived at on the basis of the royalty of eight
cents a ton the Indians now receive under coal
land leases. He expressed himself as against any
present sale of the coal lands, saying he believed
it would be impossible to get anything like a fair
price for them In view of the unsuccessful efforts
his department had made in that connection.
Senator Brandegee remarked that he had heard
$4,000,000,000 was to be offered for the lands.
'•I would accept that offer in a wink," responded
Mr. Hitchcock.
The Secretary advocated the present sale of sur
face lands over the coal deposits, saying the way
to accomplish this was by the sealed bid system.
He approved generally a plan suggested by the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that the Indians
incorporate and lease their coal lands.
Discussing the oil production in the territory Mr.
Hitchcock asserted that the Standard Oil Company
had a monopoly by controlling- the pipe lines, by
means of which the price of oil had been forced
down to 34 cents a barrel and that only 50.00" bar
rels a day were being produced, whereas 300.000
barrels a day could be obtained should the field
1- worked to its normal capacity. The Secretary
sal 1 he was doing what he could to encourage the
Independent producer, but the only possible chance
of success would be by the construction of Inde
pendent lines.
ere was a proposition on foot, he said, to pipe
natural gas from the Osage Nation to St. Louis,
where the company expected to reduce the price
of gas from 83 to 35 cents a thousand feet. The
Secretary said he had refused to approve this plan
unless the price paid to the Indians for gas well
leases should be placed on a morn equitable basis
than the email price a well now f.aid.
Tha committee Rjljourned until Tuesday next.
when Director Wfl'.entt of th« Geological Survey
win endeavor to give an estimate of the value of
tha lands In question.
CONGRESS MARKS TIME.
Little Business To Be Transacted
Before January 15.
[From The Tribune Bureau.]
Washington, Dec. 14.— Congress 13 still marking
time with remarkable earnestness, and it intends
to pursue this policy for some time to come.
Each week since it convened the Senate has ad
journed from Thursday until Mond and in the
House the widest latitude has been given to those
who desired to air their views on all sorts of sub
jects while the Legislative bill was nominally
under discussion.
Next Thursday both houses will adjourn for the
holiday recess, which will nominally vnd on Janu
ary S, but actually on January 7. On January 3
at noon the Vice-president, with tiicut dignity,
and the Bpeakai with a merry twinkle ia his eye,
will call their respective houses to order. At their
tjt-sk.-> in each chamber will be a. email number of
legislators, and uu one will be unkind enough to
call attention to the fact that there is no <iuorimi
l.recent. It is barely possible that some little- Lusi
nesa will be done, by unanimous consent, of course
— such business as introducing private pension
bills and presenting petitions — and then a member
of each House will gravely move adjournment, to
meat again on Monday, the 7th, axid so one of
the farcical features of the passion will bo curried
out with all due solemnity. But actually Congress
will enjoy a holiday recess of eighteen days. When
the nationai legislature really meets, on the 7th,
there will be a tremendous show of energy, but
even then it la not intended to do much befor* the
16th. When the day arrives there- will remain
a little over ■- x w.-.-k- of the session. The leaders
will then call attention to that tact and to the
further fact that there still remains thirteen big
appropriation bills to be passed, all of which have
right of way. The biennial legislative Jam will
have • ■■■"n produced and the leaders will be happy.
Nothing which , does not command their cordiai
approval can poesibl] get through, "because nf
the lack of time." while those things which they
really want enacted will go through without much
debate, members who are longing to get through
private measures being unwilling '"to delay the
game" by indulging In any debate not absolutely
essential.
And so when the clock strikes 13 on March 4.
and the gavels of the Vice-President anil the
Speaker fall fnr the last time in this Oongre^,
the leaders may be filled with "infinite regret"
because of the measures which have fallen by vie
Wayside and localise of the lack of time in which
to parry Into effect many of the President's recom
mendations, hut everything in which they were
really Interested will have been placed safely on
the statute books.
TREASTJEY BTTSTS MORE SILVER
Price of the Metal, However, Continues to
Decline Steadily.
[From The Tribune Hureau.l
Washington. Dec 14.— The Director of the Mint I
to-day purchased WO ■« ■• ounces of silver for im
mediate delivery at Denver, paying 68.763 cents an
ounce. The price of the white metal is falling
steadily. In spite of the fact that the Treasury has
bought. more heavily this week than in »■.;. pre- I
vious week since it re-entered the market. Since, j
last Monday Director Roberts has purchased ■CS.oou
ounces of silver, dividing it between the Philadel- i
tiLla and Denver .mints. The last purchase before ■■
to-day was at the rate of *s.U3 cents an ounce, and :
the one before that at a trifle more than ffl cents.
■India has left the market," said Mr. Roberta. In
explaining the reason for the decline in price. "As
long as India continues to buy. the price holds up .
nretty hich. but as soon us Bhe retires from the I
market th« fl»ures drop."
it is also utiggested at the Treasury Department i
that the demand for silver for use in the arts for i

MR. SHAW OX CI^RREXCr.
Criticises Bankers' Plan — Favors
High Taxed Credit Issue.
"Washington, Dec. — Secretary Shaw appeared
before the House Committee, on Banking and Cur
rency to-day in advocacy of a high taxed credit
currency, suggesting 5 per cent as a desirable rate.
He emphasized the need for greater elasticity in
currency, but expressed the opinion that the plan
framed by the American Bankers' Association
would not bring about sufficient elasticity X& be
very useful. Granting that the bankers' plan re
sults in tho issue of J200.0f0,000 additional in na
tional bank notes, Mr. Shaw said that in his opin
ion not more than $20,000,000 worth of these will be
redeemed.
Mr. Shaw thought the bankers' plan was wholly
inadequate to meet the requirements of the com
mercial world, and said it was encumbered with
too much machinery for the limited good results
he felt it was capable of accomplishing-. He sail
he did not want to be regarded as an opponent of
the measure suggested by the bankers, because he
felt that an step toward relieving the demand for
greater elasticity at certain seasons of the year
was desirable, but he ur?red that the committee
strive to frame a more effective measure.
lie ur^ed that an effort should be made to make
all currency more elastic, rather than to Impart
elasticity to v certain amount of emergency cur
rency. Under the hankers plan, he said, only the
cre'lit currency which goes Into national banks
would be on It* way to redemption. There would
be mo reason why private banks should seelc the
redemption of national banknote.", and consequent
ly they would make no effort to do so.
CONGRESS AND SPELLING
Simplified Form Still To Be Used in White
House Correspondence.
Washington. Dec. 14.— What will probably be ■:■•<*
last action of tlie House of Representatives on th«
subject of simplified spelling occurred to-day, when.
vn motion if Representative Tawney, chairman at
the C< mmittee on Appropriations, the House, with
out debati or division, struck out of the Legislative
Executive and Judicial bill the provision relative to
spelling. The action was taken because of the
promise of tbe President to revoke his order to tiie
Public Printer and the consequent adoption of yes
terday's resolution on this subject.
The simplified form of spelling will be continued
at the White House in al! correspondence emanat
ing: from ere, notwithstanding what action may
be taken by Congress In regard to the spelling of
public documents. The use of the simplified form
will Include all correspondence passing between the
White House and public officials, personal corre
spondence of the President, and. In fact, 1 all com
munications which <!<> n..t require printing at the
Mvernment printing office or any of Its branches.
It was said at the White louse to-day that the

That Kei Kelchl Aokl. the Japanese child who

Japan and Is a subject of the empire. is ten
years and three months old. and. with the excep
tion of being of Japanese descent, has the quali

schools of San Franc to which American
children and those of other nationalities are ad
