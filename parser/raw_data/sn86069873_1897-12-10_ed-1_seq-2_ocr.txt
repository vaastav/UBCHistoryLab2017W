0VE AND DUTY

She Places Her Aria Around Ills Xeclc
Tlio President Kissed Her Tenderly
A Scene That is Almost Too
Sacred for Pen to Write
Caotox O Dec S Once more th
children of Nancy Allison McKinley
have gathered about her couch made
sacred by her tenacious struggle
against death The reunion is com
plete The president arrived before
the death angel made his visit and took
with him the spirit of the aged mother
With the children were other rela
tives among whom was the aged sister
of Mrs McKinley Mrs Abigail Os
borne mother of Consul W M Os
borne
The scene was a pathetic one that
beggars description In the midst of
it all there was a joy unspeakable in
the breast of the president He had
again been permitted to see his mother
alive He had answered all the obliga
tions of his country lie had fulfilled
his vows to his neonle lie had wit-
nessed the assembling of congress and
Jiad been cheered with the news at the
same time that his mother was better
In that little upper room at the Mc
Kinley homestead Tuesday morning
there was a scene that is almost too
sacred for pen to write The eyes of
all present were filled with tears as
they witnessed the remarkable and al
most miraculous rally of the presi
dents mother from the unconscious
estate into which she had fallen eai ly
Tuesday morning
As her famous son entered the room
accompanied by his wife and his
niece Miss Mabel McKinley the sister
of the president Miss Helen said
Mothor here are William and Ida
lie kneeled by her bedside he kissed
her tenderly reverently and as he did
so she put her arm about his neck and
signified that she knew him She also
recognized the presidents wife and
reached her hand toward her and
knew Miss Mabel McKinley and lack
Duncan
It seemed to friends that she had
some how or other been waiting for
the arrival of her son Soon after she
lapsed into an unconscious state and
the strength that had been husbanded
for the last meeting of son and mother
seemed to leave her
An hour after his arrival the presi
dent sat by the bedside holding the
hand of his mother The attending
physician was surprised at the remark
able rally At 930 he said that she is
getting weaker but he thinks she will
live through the dajT
At 5 oclock Tuesday morning it was
thought by those in attendance that
the president would not arrive before
the aged mother had died He was in
formed that such was thought to be
the condition ne was anxious to get
to her bedside The run was a rapid
one from Pittsburgh but there was a
slight delay there in making the trans
fer to the Ft Wayne track
Dr Phillips who was present at the
time of the presidents arrival and the
recognition said afterwards in com-
imentang upon this that the affair was

weaker and that despite the rallies she
has had she has been failing since he
left her
Canton Dec S Dr Phillips left
Mrs McKinley late Tuesday afternoon
She was then entirely unconscious and
resting quietly She has taken no
nourishment for 24 hours The doctor

TORU HOSHI
The Japanese Minister Gives an Inkling of
the Course Japan Will Pursue Should
Hawaii Be Annexed to the United States
Omaha Neb Dec 9 Toru Hoshi
Japanese minister to the United States
passed through Omaha Wednesday
evening en route to Washington ac
companied by his private secretary
In an interview Mr Hoshi admitted
that the object of his mission to Japan
was to ascertain the views of his gov
ernment on the proposed annexation
of Hawaii and to procure instructions
from the mikado relative to the course
he was expected to pursue in case the
treaty shall be ratified by congress
The impression has gone out to the
American press said Mr Hoshi that
we propose to recall the protest en
tered by Japan against the acquisition
of the Sandwich islands by the United
States government This is mislead
ing and untrue Japan has always
maintained amicable relations with
the United States and it is not our
purpose now to take any steps that
would lead to a breach of mutual good
will but at the same time Japan will
staiid firmly in the maintenance of its
rights and- privileges acquired under
treaty with the Hawaiian government
If the United States decided to annex
Hawaii we hope to be able to enforce
our demands for indemnity for the
violation of treaty rights in the expul
sion of Japanese immigrants from the
island and their exclusion from the
rights acquired under our treaty
Concerning President McKinleys
message particularly as referring to
relation of Japan with the United
States in connection with the propos
ed annexation of Hawaii Mr Hoshi
declined to express any views beyond
reiferating what he stated at the out
set that there would be no disposition
on the part of Japan to resist the ac
quisition of Hawaii by the United
States but that he hoped to be able
through diplomatic negotiations to
bring about a peaceful solution of the
matters involved

Dayton 0Dec 8 A petition signed
by 3000 veteran inmates of die central
branch National Military home near
this city was mailed Tuesday evening
to Senator Hanna in Washington tc
present before- congress The petition
in strong respectful terms sustains the
proposition of Gen Breckinridge in
spector general of the army to change

so that the secretary of war will have
direct control the same as the regular
army home at Washington The vet
erans commend the recommendation
of Gen Breckinridge providing for
commutation of rations eight or ten
dollars a month while on furlough or
permanent leave from the home as
this money in addition to their pen
sions would enable them to live com
fortable with their families away from

for destitute soldiers who are now
barred from the over crowded institu

CIVIL SERVICE
A Movement on Foot to Change the System
Conference of Representatives Will Be
Held at An Early Date
Washington Dec 9 A paper was
circulated in the house of representa
tives Wednesday with a view
to cringing about a conference j
of those members favor in a i
change in the present civil service
system The paper was handled by
Representative Pearson of North Car
olina and received numerous signa
tures The purpose it is understood is
to make the conference non -political
in character and to extend it outside of
the membershin of thp mvil sorripo
committee as some of the men most j 1
a m
active m urging a revision of the law
are not on this committee Gen Gros
venor of Ohio is among these He
approved the plan of a conference of
those interested in the subject and it
is likely to be held at an early day
The indications are that the holiday
recess of congress will extend from
Saturday December IS to Monday or
Tuesday January 3 or 4 Speaker
Reed is understood to favor these
dates If however any important
business developes in the senate or
house the recess will propably be post
poned into Christmas week So far as
the house is concerned no general
legislation will be ready for considera
tion before the holidays and work is
likely to be confined to the appropria
tion bills
It is stated by those in a position to
know that the reason the Hawaiian
treaty is not pushed in the senate is
because the friends of the measure
have grave doubts as to their ability to
secure the necessary two thirds vote to
pass it The impression prevails that
it may be necessary to pass a joint res
olution and annex the islands by legis
lation It has been found that a num
ber of senators who were confidently
counted for the treaty are against it
while others have expressed doubts
abouty hasty action
Washington Dec 9 The house com
mittee on invalid pensions met Wed
nesday and took action that is intend
ed to correct the alleged rapidly grow
ing abuse of young women marrying

ing a pension from the government
This subject has been much dis
cussed in iew of the comparatively
large number of widow claimants
on account of the revolutionary war
of 1812 and Mexican war service of
husbands The committee authorized
Chairman Bay to obtain from the com
mittee on rules an order or rule per
mitting an amendment to the pension
appropriation bill providing that no
pension shall hereafter be granted to
the widow of a soldier or a person
after the passage of this act except
ing however all soldiers sailors offi
cers etc now in or who may hereafter
enter the militar or naval service of

Washington Dec 9 United States

low prices paid for beets making it
more profitable to cultivate cereals
than sugar

ing the debate Gen Grosvenor of Ohio fired

and enemies of that measure into
action Mr Johnson of Indiana in a ringing
warning declared that if a bill to emasculate
the civil service law were passed it would
meet the presidential veto Eventually Mr
Dingley in deference to the opposition of the
members of the banking and currency commit
