PRESIDENT TAFT'S
ANNUAL MESSAGE
Underwood Accuses President And Ad
ministration With Trying to Over
shadow Tariff With Trusts.
; Washington, D. C, Dec. 6. Presi-
dent Taft's message on the trust was
i I read in both branches of congress yes-
S terday, and was generally well re
... celved. The president's objection, to
;s a repeal of the Sherman law was ap
':i provel by some of the leaders on both
( sides, although the message should
have dealt with the tariff.
Democratic Leader Underwood said
the president and the administration
was trying to overshadow the tariff
with trust issues.
"The message is an able one from
the president's standpoint," said Mr.
Underwood, "but we feel that the
counding , message should have dealt
with the tariff. There seems to be
an effort on. the part of the president
and the administration to force trust
issues ahead. I am opposed to the re
peal of the Sherman law, but there
may be supplemental action to define
it. I do not think he favors an early
corporation, act." i
Speaker Clark said he could not dis
cuss the message until he had studied
it thoroughly.
Republican Leader Mann, who has
not always agreed with the president,
praised the message.
"Is is probably the strongest utter
ance President Taft has ever made,"
he said. "It shows that he is on the
side of the people; that he is not con-
trolled by the trusts, and that he does
J not wish to cause undue violence to
commissions." .
In the house the reading of the mes-
sage was Interrupted by applause from
( the republicans. The clerk was dron
i Ing the document, a majority of the
V; members were following by 'reading
; printed copies which had been dis-
tributed to their desks.
i The senate heard the reading of
3 the measure with its usual dignified
attention, and ilien adjourned in re
spect to the memories of Representa
tives Madison of Kansas and Latta of
Zt Nebraska, whose deaths were an
nounced by a committee from the
house. . ,, ' .,
For lack of something to do, the
: senate will not meet until Thursday
I afternoon and will then adjourn until
Monday. The bouse will meet at noon
'4 today.

City's Chief Executive Refused to Sign
Ordinances Passed at the Last
Council Meeting.
The regular meeting of the city
council last night proved an interest
ing session. After a communication
of the attorney general had been read
and the usual routine business of the
session was out of the way, including
the monthly finance ordinance, the
mayor announced the return of two
ordinances passed by the Council, at
the last meeting, without his signa
ture. These ordinances were the or
dinance fixing the salary of the city
engineer at $75 per month, and the
ordinance creating the office of audi
tor of the water works. In returning
the ordinances the mayor gave as his
reasons for so doing that the ordin
ances were illegal. The council how
ever thought differently and passed
the ordinances over the veto of, the
mayor. The vote for passage over the
veto was 6 to 2. Martin and Couch
voting against the passage of the or
dinances. After a brief period, following the
passage of the ordinances, ,'tv' situa
tion looked a bit squally, find some
choice sarcasm was Indulged izi, but
the meeting closed with the discussion
of the refunding bond issue, and the
election of a delegate to the Municipal
League meeting at Tulsa next week,
as peacefully as the session started.
The high school fottball team and a
team of former high schoo lplayers

championship, at Electric Park, this
afternoon.

ative scores than Oklahoma this year
and the margin in favor of the unusual

Oklahomas attribute the great show
ing of the team, which for the first
time has won statewide support, to the
coaching ability of Bennie Owen.

PASSER
OVER MAYOR'S VETO
WOMEN VOTERS
OF LOS ANGELES ELECTIOI
Los Angeles, Cal.. Dec. 6. Esti
mates based on a partial count of the
vote at 10:30 o'clock last night place
the majority for Mayor George Alex
ander over Job Harriman, socialist,
at more than 50,000. In 110 precincts
complete, out of 317, Alexander's net
gain over the primary vote was 23,
990. Alexander carried Harriman's
home precinct 1,537 to 192. Partial re
turns indicate that prohibition has
been defeated two to one.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. C. Social
ism grappled in a final struggle with
its opponents under the "good gov
ernment" banner at the ballot box yes
terday and was defeated.
Prohibition, the other big issue in
the municipal campaign, received
scant attentlonfrom the vote counters
last night and the fate of the "dry"
ordinance remains uncertain, though
the probability is that it has been de
feated. ,
Forced to yield first place in the
nominating ballot, October 31, when
the vote cast totalled 45,000, Mayor
George Alexander polled yesterday ap
parently more than a two to one ma
jority over Job Harriman, socialist, in
a vote which totalled 140,880. When
Harriman gained a plurality of 3,000
over the mayor in the October primary,
the registration was approximately
000. Yesterday 187,000 persons, in
cluding 83,000 women, were entitled
to vote. .
Ninety per cent of the -registration
on the west side, where the vote was
light in the primary, was voted yes
terday, while on the east side, Harri
man's stronghold, there was a falling
off in comparison.
The women on the west side outvot
ed the men. The reverse was true in
the precincts where Harriman was the
stronger in the primary. But the bal
ance of power which the women were
credited with having prior to the 03
tonnding finale of the McNamara case
last Friday, did not figure In the re
sult.
"Persons who would not vote for
Alexander simply stayed away from
the polls," Chairman C. S. Graham of
the good government decleared last
night In predicting a majority of at
least 30,000 for Alexander.
Harriman was in conference with
his campaign manager, Alexander Ir
vine of New York, early in the even
ing. He declared that gross frauds
had been perpetrated by the opposi
tion, but refused to concede his de
feat.
The victorious ticket consists of
Mayor Alexander and nine councilraeu,
made up of bankers, lawyers, store
keepers and realty brokers.

The tariff board is working at break
neck speed in an effort to present Its
report on woll to President Taft Sat

ability will not be in the president's
hands until after the Christmas holi
days. Day and night shifts of clerks are
rushing toward completion the tabula

editor of one of the local morning pa-

labor leaders.
One feature of the balloting was the

of Joseph Ascott, candidate for re-
election to the school board, who also
was one of the attorneys for the Mc- dent; Mrg Mary Mercer of Capron,
Xaniaras. vjce president; Lee Woolley of Woods
It became apparent early that the county( secretary; County Superin

Namara case would not occur during
the balloting.
"The peace insurance" army of 1,000
officers, detailed by Chief of Police
Sebastian and Sheriff Hammel, had
little to do.
Only three minor cases of trouble
were reported.
Leaders of both sides thanked the
women, thousands of whom were
crowded about the pooling booths of
the 317 precincts. The wnien were
treated with the greatest gallantry.
Many went to the polls propelling baby
carriages, and often father took care
of baby w hile mother voted.
One woman ran the line of voters
at a westside precinct.
"But, madam, you must take your
place In line," an election official re-
plied. She glanced at the long line
75,-'and refused,
I left a batch of bread in the oven
and I wouldn't leave it burn for either
Harriman or Alexander."
And she went back home.
Caroline M. Severence, ninety-two
years old, a iormer associate of Susan
B. Anthony, made her way to the polls,
I have waited fifty years for this
day my first vote," she said.

Lawler Says Investigation Will Reveal
One of Most Dastardly Con
spiracies in History.
Los Angeles, Dec. 6. James B. Mc-
Xamara, aged 29, confessed murderer
by the dynamiting of the Ims Angeles
Times building, was sentenced to life
imprisonment here Tuesday.
His brother, John J. McNamara,
aged 34, secretary of the International
Associatlo nof Bridge and Structural
Iron Workers, who confessed to the
dynamiting of the Llewellyn Iron
Works, was sentenced to fifteen years
in the penitentiary.
Twenty-one persons lost their lives
in the Times disaster. No one was
killed in the Llewellyn Iron Works af
fair.
Imprisonment will be in the Sau
Quentin penitentiary.
Two hours before court opened sev
eral hundred men and women as
sembled about the corridors of the
Hall of Records to get a last glance
at the prisoners.
The McNamara brothers faced the
prospect of sentence with more than
equanimity. . They rose in good spirits
and made rapid work of a big break
fast of ham and eggs, coffee and coun
try sausage.
James B. McNamara simllingly met
the greetings of his guards, while John
J. worried considerably because his
trousers had not been pressed with the
proper creases.
Both men joked with Jailor Galla
gher. They told him they expected to
be his guests until the federal grand
jury finished gleaning from them in
formation which it Is believed the
United States authorities are seeking
regarding the "inner dynamite ring."
Oscar Lawler, formerly assistant
United States attorney general today
received word of his appointment as
special prosecutor in the Inquiry Into
the alleged dynamiting conspiracy.
"I am convinced," said Lawler, "that
the investigation., will reveal one of
the most dastardly conspiracies in tho
history of this couBtry."
