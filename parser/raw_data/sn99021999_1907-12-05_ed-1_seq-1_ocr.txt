WASHINGTON'. Dec 4. Prominent offi
cials of the national government, governors
of state, representatives of foreign pow
ers, members of th senat and house of
representatives pa-tldpated. today In the
opening of the convention of the National
Rivers and Harbors congres. Nearly awX
delegates, representing 'every stat In tha
onion, were present. It was not expected
that any definite or concrete action In pro
motion cf the prospects advocated by the
congress will b taken, but It Is hoped that
th work of the convention will so lmpres
the national congress now In session, as to
Indue It to make adequate appropriations
for th Improvement of th river and
harbors of the' country. It Is tha desire of
the a negates to secure such sotldri by ths
congress of th Vnltd State s will pro
mot the trade and commerce of America.
It is hot a special pro! chat the conven
tion haa In view, but the adoption, of a
policy by th gwvarmnt looking to the
extension of the transe-artailnn facilities of
the L'nlted States. ,
On behalf of the national administration.
Ellhu Root, recretary of state, extended
to the rongi'.ss hearty sympsthy In the
work which It had undertaken and gave
assurance of the support of the admlnts
trstion In the conclusions arrived at by the
delegatea. The congress will be In session
for thres days and th body will be ad
Idrcsed by soma of th most prominent
publicists and economists of the United
States.
Secretary Root Make Address.
The convention was formally opened at
10 o'clock this morning. Representative
Joseoh JB. Ransdell of Louisiana presided.
and J. P. Ellison of Cincinnati officiated as
secretary. Th session began with prayer
by Earl Cranston, bishop of th Methodist
Episcopal church..
Before tb ' congress formally convened
President Rarndell was presented with a
silver-mounted gavel by the Upper Mis
sissippi Improvement association. Mr.
Ransdell In opening the congress referred
to th work of the national administration
in promoting trad relatione between Amer
ica and foreign countries, particularly those
countries lying to the south of the Lnlted
States, and referred In compliments ry
terms to the achievement -of Secretary
Root In promoting those relations. He then
presented the secretary of state.
Secretary Root was received with great
applause, th delegates rising to greet him.
"It is a pleasure," said Secretary Root,
"to extend to you the Interest and hearty
sympathy of the national administration
la your grefit work. It has been a subject
of much . misunderstanding and depreca
tion and even of derision. Our people ar
s busy that the In habitants of on section
of th country understand little of what is
going on in other sections."
The Intra trj scheme, Mi.' Root said
had been sought under eolorrit river and
harbor Improvements. H 'felicitated the
convention on the. fact that the river and
harbor bills of this day were relieved of
temptations Df th k!nd referred to.
Railroads Art Overtaxed.
Th aecretary said that the policy fol
lowed by th United State must b con
sidered truly as a policy and not a a
project. He referred to the construction
of the Panama canal and to the Improve
ment of the Erie canal aa Instances show
ing thst the American people stand
squarely behind the Improvement of water
ways and he expressed the hope that they
would assert thst policy In the future.
"In your last convention," said Secretary
Root, "there was some reference that we
should not cross a bridge ustil we reached
It. W now have reached the bridge;
(Applause). There Is no greater achieve
ment than the transportation of ' articles
valueless at on point to another point
where they are valuable. The railroads
of the country no longer are able, phy.
sically, to carry the traffic of America and
the one a venae cpen t such traffic Is
waterway transportation. We must move
forward or we will go backward. I i
American production handicapped by two
things first, ths great cost of gating the
goods to the seaboard, and, second, the
absence of an American merchant marine.
President Ransdell presentod a report of
the work of the conres during the lat
few months. Then he introduced M. Jus-
serand, the ambassador of France to the
United States.
Frame Sets Goad Example.
"W hold the record for the present.
said Ambessador Jusserand, "you will bold
It In your turn when . th great Panama
canal la finished; we turned the first sod;
you will turn the last, and no one will ap
plaud more heartily than your predeces
sora."
The ambassador reviewed the history of
the efforts mad by France In th Im
provement of waterways and the resultant
benefit to commerce. He said that the
greatest era of canal building In France
Is the present. The elm be added, la to
have throughout France free canals aa
they have free roads.
'From 1S75 to 1900 the traffic increased UJ
per cent and It now amounts to over
tO.fflnOOO tona Tha Investment is valu
able because of what It yields, of what It
help, and al-.o of what It prevents. The
best thing It prevents is th rsilroada
raising their tariffs too high. As soon as
ths rairoad companies ratss their tariffs
Quantities of goods find that they ra very
well afford to travel at a slower pace and
take th water route. Our canals act. In
a way, as a kind of rata bill, a self-regu
tatlng one.
Forests Aboolato Wee easily.
"It is an absolute principle no forests, no
waterwaya Without forests regulating the
distribution of wcters, rainfalls are at once
hurried to tb sea, hurried sometimes, alas,
across country. After having devastated
the neighboring fields the rivers find them
selves again with little water and much
and; with such rivers bow will you feed
your canals In all seasons? Since our for
ests suffered damagea which w ar now
bent upon repairing at considerable pains
and cost, a river Ilk th Loire haa been
entirely transformed; It used t b th best
of waterwaya, and it is now th river whose
inundations ar most , destructive. Tb
question Is as clear can be. Do you
want to have navigable rtvera. or do you
prefer to hav torrents that will destroy
your crop ard never bear a boat? If you
prefer tbe first, then mind your forests.
We can tell you. for w know."

coln, Neh.. arrived here today from Wash
ington arxl met his wife and daughter, who
are bound for New fork, whence they will
sail for Europe f-'t-u-day.
Mr. Pryan commented on several of the
testes treated In President Roosevelt's
message and credited the president with
introducing an original proposition In sug
gesting tha appropriation of campaign
funds by tha government.
I hope," he said, "that It will be enacted
Into a law."
Mr. Bryan Is strictly In accord with the
president concerning postal savings banks
and guaranteed banks.
8ald he: "Th money boarded In hiding
places. If It can be drawn Into th banks
and thus be put into channels of trade
will relieve the stringency more ef
fectively than anything else. The postal
bank will do this to a limited extent, but
not completely, for ta th plan proposed
th depositors will V limited as to each
person, and no checking account will be
allowed. r
"Tha system of th guaranteed banks
contemplate absolute guarantee by the
government of such banks as may volun
tarily enter Into tho system. In entering
tha system they . agree t reimburse the
government In proportion to their deposits
for any losses incurred by tbe government
In payment of depositors In failed banks.
During the last forty year the average
lo among rational bank has been less
than one-tenth of 1 per cent of deposits,
and, as we have passed through two
panic In that Urn It la not likely that th
average lost will be greater during th
next forty years.
"To rem up, th depositors need security
and thia must either be given by the postal
savings bank, which will grow until It has
absorbed the deposit banking of the coun
try, or It must be furnished through th
guarantee of existing banka"

of a desire to resign, and no official an
nouncement I expected until after his ar
rival In Toklo. It Is now regarded aa a
foregone conclusion that Ambassador Aokl
will not return to Waahlngton. The ques
tion of his probable successor, in th event
his resignation is accepted, haa be-n long

this connection include Baron Kaneko.

Foreign office, and M. Takahlra, at present
Japanese ambassador to Italy and formerly
minister .of-Japan at Washington. It Is
now understood that M. Takahlra Is first
choice. Nether Baron Chlnda nor Baron
Kanek -in be spared, so Takahlra will
undoubtedly be appointed if be is accepta
ble at Washington. Th Assoclsted Press
ta assured by th highest authority in th
Foreign office that the recall of Viscount
Aokl Is rot Intended as a reflection -upon
his course, but a possible chang at Waah

ahould th present action be construed to

WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. Acting .upon
speclflo orders of ths rrestde.nl. th War
department made every effort In Its vsrl
oos branches to acquire before the first of
October all of th coal necerary td be
used at army posts throughout th com
ing winter. In Usulng these orders th
president fallowed the suggestion of th
Interstate Commerce commission, acting
upon a recommendation of ths president of
the Northern Pacific rnlla-sy that th fed
eral government should set a good example
by laying In an adequate fuel supply for
all Its offices or branche In the northwest
well In advance of winter so a to avoid
so far as possible the trouble caused by
the shortage of fuel In that region last
winter. "This," th president said, "Is ex
cellent advice," and he gave ordors ac
cordingly. Army quartermasters have found no dif
ficulty in obtaining fuel and forage this
year, as was at on tlm expectedj but
prices hare appreciably advanced for both.
Thl year's contract prices are from 20
to S per cent higher than those of last
year, when the prices were 15 per cent
grester than these of the preceding year.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec 4.-Several of th
Independent anthracite operators, after at
tempts to Induce the Reeding and some
of the other big anthracite companies to
tak th initiative In further advancing
the prices of steam sixes of hard coaL have
raised the price from 15 to 2S cents a ton
at the mine.
The Reading so far has declined to make
any further advance In th pric of these
sixes, on of the reasons assigned being
that the last advance of 25 cents a ton
made some weeks ago, had not yet become
operative In many Instances where pre
vious contracts were concerned. With the
expiration of most of these contracts, on
January L this advance will become gen
eral, and unlcs some falling off In the
demand Is indicated by. that time It Is
probable that an additional advance will
bo made before the Reading makes any
new contract.
