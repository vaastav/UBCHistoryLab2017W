THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
First Annual Message of Presi
dent Arthur to the Con
gress of the United
States.
A Document Full of Practical Sug
gestion* and Extreme Good
Seme.
*vv Washington, Deo. 6.—To the senate
and house oi representatives of the Unit
ed States:
An appalling calamity has befallen the
American people sinoe their chosen rep
resentatives last met in the balls where
yon are now assembled. We might
recall with unalloyed content the pros
perity with whioh throughout the year
the nation has been blessed. Its harvests
have been plenteous its varied indus
tries have thriven the health of the peo
ple has been preserved ithas maintained
with foreign governments the undisturb
ed relations of amity and peace. For
these manifestations of hfe favor we owe
to him who holds our destiny in his
bands the tribute of our grateful devo
tion to that mysterious exercise of will
which has taken from us the loved and
illustrious citizen who was bat lately the
head of the cation we bow in sorrow and
submission. The memory of his exalted
charaoter, of his noble aohieveirifents^md
of his patriotic life will be treasured lor-

p*
ever as a sacred possession of the whole
people. The announcement of his death
drew from foreign governments and peo
ple tributes of sympathy and sorrow
which history will regard as the signal
tokens of the kinship of nations and the
fraternal union of mankind. The feeling
of good will between our own govern
ment and that of Great Britain was nev
er more marked thim at prescjbt. In rec
ognition of this pleasing fact I directed
on the occasion of the late centenial cele
bration at Yorktown that a salute be giv
en to the British .flag.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Save for the correspondence to whioh
I shall hereafter refer in relation to the
proposed canal across the isthmus of
Panama little has occurred worth men
tioning in the diplomatic relations of the
countries.
Early in the year the Fortune bay
claims were satisfactorily arranged by
the British government paying in the
sum of d£15,U00,moet of which has already
been distributed. As the terms of settle
ment include compensation for injuries
suffered by our fishermen at Aspec bay,
there has been retained from the gross
award a sum which is deemed adequate
tor those claims.
The participation of America in the
exhibition at Melbourne and Sidney will
be approvingly mentioned in the reports
of the two exhibitions soon to be pre
sented to congress. They will disclose
the readiness of our countrymen to make
successful competition in the various
fields of enterprise.
Negotiations for an international
copyright convention are in hopeful pro
gress.
The surrender of Sitting Bull and his
forces upon the Canadian frontier has al
Inyed all apprehensions, although bodies
of hostile Indians still cross the border
in quest ot sustenance. Upon this sub
ject a correspondence has been opened
which promises an amicable understand
ing. Our troops have orders to avoid,
meanwhile, all collisions with alien Indi
ans.
FRANCE.
The presence at the Yorktown celebra
tion of representatives of the French re
public and descendents of la Fayette
and of his gallant compatriots who were
.. our allies in the revolution, has served
to strengthen the spirit of good will
which has always existed between the
two nations. You will be furnished with
the proceedings of the bi-metallic con
ference during the summer at the city of
Paris. No accord was reached, but a
valuable interchange of ideas was had
and the conference will next year be re
newed. At the electoral exhibition and
congress, also held at Paris, ttis conn
try was creditably represented by emi
nent specialist, who, in the absence of
an appropriation, generously. lent their
efficient aid at the instance of the state
department. While our exhibitions in
v: this almost exclusively American field of
achievements have won several awards,
I recommend that congress provide for
the repayment of the personal expenses
incurred in the public interest by the
honorary commissioners and delegates.
GERMANY.
No complaints respecting the status
of our naturalized citizens in Germany
have arisen during the year, and causes
of complaint, especially in Alsace and
Lorraine, have practically ceased through
the liberal action of the imperial govern
ment in accepting onr often expressed
our views on the subject.
The application of the treaty of 1868
to the lately acquired Bhenish prov
inces has received very earnest atten
tion. A definite and lasting agreement
on this point is confidently expected.
The participation of the descendants
of Baron von Steuben in the Yorktown
festivities, and their subsequent recep
tion by their Amerioan kinsmen, strik
ingly evinced the ties of good will which
unite the German people and our own.
Our intercourse with Spain has been
friendly. An agreement concluded in
February last fixes for a term the labors
of the Spanish and American claims
commissions. The Spanish government
has been requested to pay the late award
of the commission, and will, it is believed,
accede to the request as promptly and
courteously as ou former occasions. By
recent legislation onerous fines have
been imposed upon American shipping
in Spanish and colonial ports for slight
irregularities in manifests. One case of
hardship is worthy of attention. The
bark Masonic, bound for Japan, entered
Manmlla in distress, and is there sought
to be confiscated under the Spanish rev
enue laws for alleged shortage in her
shipped cargo. Though efforts for her
relief have thus far proved unavailing, it
is expected that the whole matter will
be adjusted in friendly spirit.
BU8BIA.
The sAate resolution of condolence
upon the assassination of the czar Alex
ander II was appropriately communica
ten to the Russian government, whioh in
turn has expressed its sorrow in our late
national bereavement. It is desirable
that our cordial relations with Russia
should be strengthened by proper enact
ments, assuring to peaceable
Americans
who visit the empire that consideration
which is due them as citizens of a friend
ly state. This i« especially needful with
respect to Amerioan Israelites, whose
classification with the native Hebrews
has evoked
energetic
remonstrances from
this government.
A consular agreement with Italy has
been sanctioned which it is now claimed
pats at rest the conflicts of jurisdiction

The peril of life and properly in many
parts of Turkey has given use to corre
spondence with the porte looking to the
better protection ot American mission
aries in the empire. The condemned
murderer of the eminent missionary. Dr.
Justin Parsons, has not yet been execu
ted, although the government has re
peatedly demanded that exemplary jns
tioe be done.
The Swiss government has solioited
the good offices of our diplomatic and
consular agents for the protection of its
citizens in countries where it is not itself
represented. The request has within
proper limits been granted. Our agents
in Switzerland have been instructed to
jrotest against the conduct of the au
ihorities of certain communities in per
mitting the emigration to this country of
criminals and other objectionable per
sons. Several such persons through the
eO-operation of the commissioners of em
igration at New York have been sent
back by the steamers whioh brought
them. A continuance of this course may
prove more effectual than diplomatic
remonstance.
Treaties of commerce and navigation
and for the regulation of consular privil
iges, have been concluded with Bouma
ma and Servia since their admission into,
the family of European states.
insxico.
As is natural with contiguous states
having like institutions and like aims of
advancement and development, the
friendship of the United States andMex
ioo been constantly maintained. The gov
ernment has lost no occasion of encourag
ing the Mexican government to a bene
ficial realization of the mutual advan
tages which will result from more inti
mate commercial intercourse, and the
opening of the rich interior of Mexioo to
railwav enterprise. I deem it important
that means be provided to restrain the
lawlessness unfortunately so common on
the frontier and'to suppress the forays
of the reservation Indians on their side
of the Bio Grande.
CENTRA! AMERICA
The neighboring states of Central
Amerioa have preserved internal peace
and their outward relations toward us
have been those of intimate friendship,
and there are more encouraging signs of
their growing disposition to
subordinate their local interests to those
which are common to them by reason oi
their geographical relations. The boun
dary dispute between Guatemala and
Mexico has afforded this government an
opportunity to exercise its good offices
for preventing a rupture between these
states and for procuring a peaceful solu
tion of the question, ana I cherish a
strong hope that in view of our relations
of amity with the countries onr friendly
counsel will prevail. The Costa Kican
government lately formed an engage
ment with Columbia, settling by arbitra
tion the boundary question between
those countries, presiding that the post
of arbitrator shonla be offered succes
sively to the king of the Belgians, king
of Spain and the president of the Argen
tine confederation. The king oi the
Belgians has declined, but I am not ad
vised of the action of the kinpr of Spain.
As we have certain interests in the dis
puted territory which are protected by
our treaty engagement with one of the
parties, it iB important that the arbitra
tion should not, without our consent, al
tect our righs, and this government has
accordingly thought proper to make its
views known to tlie partus to the agree
ment and to intimate the same to the
Belgian government.
The questions growing out of the pro
posed inter-oceanic water way across the
isthmus of Panama are of g"ave natured
importance. This government has not
been unmindful of the solemn obliga
tions imposed upon it by its compact oi
1816 with Columbia as the independent
and sovereign mistress of the territory
crossed by the canal, and has sought to
render them effective by tresh engag
ments with the Columbia tepublic lool
ing to the practical execution of the ne
gotiations to this end. After they had
reached what appeared to be a mutually
satisfactory solution here they were met
in Columbia by a disavowal of the pow
ers which its envoy had assumed, and by
a proposal for renewed negotiations on a
fortified basis. Meanwhile this govern
ment learned that Columbia had pro
posed to the European powers to join in
a guarantee of the neutrality of the pro
posed Panama canal—a guarantee which
would be in direct contravention of our
obligation as to the integrity of Colum
bian territory, and of the neutrality of
the canal itself. My lamented predeces
sor felt it his duty to place before the
European powers the reasons which made
the prior guarantee of the United States
indispensable, and for which the inter
jection of any foreign guarantee might
be regarded as a superfluous and un
friendly act. Foreseeing the probable
reliance of the British government on
the provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty of 1850 as affording room for a
share in the guarantees which the Uni
ted States covenanted with Columbia
four years before. I have not hesitated
to supplement the action of my prede
cessor by proposing to her majesty's gov
ernment the modification of that instru
ment and the abrogation of such clauses
thereof as do not conform with the obli
gations of the United States toward
Columbia, or with the vital needs of the
two friendly parties to the compact.
This government sees with great con
cern the continuation of the hostile rela
tions between Chili, Bolivia and Peru.
An early peace between these republics
is much to be desired, not only that they
may themselves be spared further misery
and bloodshed, but because their contin
ued antagonism threatens consequences
which are, in my judgement, dangerous
to the interests of republican government
on this oontinent, and calculated to des
troy the best elements of our free and
peaceful civilization. As in the present
excited condition of popular feeling in
these countries there has been serious
isapprehension of the position of the
nitea States, and as separate diploma
tic intercourse with each, through inde
pendent ministers, is sometimes subject,
owing to the want of prompt communi
cation, to temporary misunderstanding,
I have deemed it judicious at the present
time to send a special envoy accredited
to all and each of them and furnished
with general instructions which will, I
trust, enable him to bring these powers
into friendly relations.
The government of Venezuela main
tains its attitude of warm friendship and
oontinues with great regularity its pay
ment of the monthly quota of the diplo
matic debt. Without suggesting the di
rection in which oongress should act, I
ask attention to the pending questions
affecting the distribution of the sums
thus far reoeived. These relations be­
tween Venezuela and France growing
out of the samo debt havo been for some
time past in an unsatisfactory state, and
this government as the neighbor aud one
of the largest creditors of Venezuela
interposed itself with the French gov
ernment with the view of producing a
friendly and lionoiable adjustment.
BRAZIL.
I regret that the commercial interests
between the United States and Brazil,
from which great advantages were hoped
a year ajro, have suffered from the with
drawal of the American lines of oomtnu
nioation between Brazilian porta and our
own. Through the efforts of our minis
ter resident at Buenos Ayres and tlio
United States minister at Santiago, a
treaty has been conoluded between the
Argentine Bepublic and Chili, disposing
of the loug pending Patagoniau bounda
ry question.
of
It is a mutter of congratulation that
our government has been afforded the
opportunity of successfully exerting its
good iufluenoe for the prevention of a
disagreement between the rcpublica of
the American continent.
CHINA.
I am glad to intorm you that the trea
ties lately negotiated with Chiua have
been duly ratified ou both sides, and the
exohange made at Peking. Legislation
is necessary to carry its provisions into
effect. Tlio prompt and friendly spirit
with which the Chinese government at
the request of the United States con
ceded the modification of existing trea
ties should secure oareful regard for the
interest and susceptibilities of that gov
ernment in the enactmeut of auy laws
relating to Chinese immigration. These
olausesof the treaties which f-rbid the
articipation of citizens or vessels of the
United States in the opium trade will
doubtless receivo your approval, aud
they will attest the sincere interest which
our people and the government feel in
the commendable efforts of the Chinese
government to put a stop to this demor
alizing and destructive traffic. In rela
tion both to China and Japan some
changes are desirable in our present sys
tem of counsel or jurisdiction. I hope
at some future time to lay before you a
scheme for its improvement in the entire
east.
JA1*AN.
The intimacy between our country and
Japan, the most advanced of the eastern
nations, continues to be cordial. 1 am
advised that the emperor contemplates
the establishment of a constitutional
government, and that he had already
summoned a parliamentary congress foi
the purpose of effecting the changes.
Such a remarkable step toward complete
assimilation with the western system
cannot fail to bring Japan into closer
and more beneficial relationship with
ourselves as the chief Pacific power. A
question has arisen in relation to the
exercise in that country of the judicial
functions conferred upon our ministers
and consuls. The indictment, trial and
conviction in the consular court at Yoko
hama of John lioss, a merchant seaman
on board an American vessel, have made
it necessary for the government to insti
tute a carel'ul examination into the na
ture and methods of this jurisdiction.
It appeared that Boss was regularly
shipped under the ilag of the United
States, but was by birth a British sub
ject. My predecessor felt it his duty to
maintain the position thnt during his
sei vice as a regularly shipped seaman ou
board an American merchant vessel,lloss
was subject to the laws of that service
and to the jurisdiction of the United
States counsul.
I renew the recommendation whicL
has been heretofore urged by the execu
tive upon the attention of congress, that
after the reduction of such amount as
may be found due to Ameiicau citizens,
the balance of the indemnity funds here
tofore obtained from China and Japan,
and which are now in the hands ot the
state department, be returned to the
governments of those countries.
The king of Hawaii, in the course ot
his homeward return, after a journey
around the world, has lately visited this
country. While our relations with that
kingdom are friendly, this government
has viewed with conceru the eHbrts to
seek a replenishment of the diminishing
population of the islands from outward
sources to a degree which may impair
the native sovereignty aud independence
in which the United States was among
the first to testify a lively interest.
Relations of unbroken amity have been
maintained throughout the year with
the respective governmtnts of Austria.
Hungary, Belgium, Denmark. Havti,
Paraguay and Uruguay, Portugal, Swe
den and Norway, and this may also be
said of Greece and Equador.
Although our relations with these
states have for some years been severed
by the withdrawal of appropriations for
diplomatic representatives at Athens
and Quito, it seems expedient to restore
these missions, even on a reduced scale,
and I decidedly recommend such a course
with respect to Equador, which is likely
within the near future to play an impor
tant part among the nations of the south
Pacific.
At the last extra session of tlie senate
it called for the text of the Geneva con
vention, relating to the relief of the
wounded in the war. I trust this action
foreshadows sueh interest in the subject
as will result in the adhesion of the Unit
ed States to that humane and commend
able engagement, and I invite your at
tention to the propriety of adopting the
new code of international rules for the
prevention of collisions on the high seas,
and of conforming the domestic iegisla
lation of the United States thereto, so
that no confusion may arise from the ap
plication of conflicting vessels of differ
ent nationalties meeting in tidal waters.
These international rules differ but
slightly from our own. They have been
adopted by the navy department for the
government of war ships ot the United
States on the high seas and in foreign
waters, and through the action of the
state department in dissimulating the
rules and acquainting shipmasters with
the option of conforming to them with
out tne jurisdictional waters of the Unit
ed States, they are now very genetally
known and obeyed.
The state department continues to pub
lish to the country the trade and manu
facturing reports received from the offi
cers abroad. The success of this course
warrants its continuance, and such ap
propriation as may be required to meet
the rapidly increasing demand for those
publications. With special reference to
the Atlanta cotton exposition, the Octo
ber number of the reports was devoted
to a valuable collection of papers on the
Cotton goods trade of the world.
The international sanitary conference,
for which in 1879 congress made provis
ion, assembled in this city early in Janu
ary last, and its sessions ere prolonged
until March. Although it reached no
specific conclusion affecting the future
action of the participant powers, the in
terchange of views proved to be most
valuable. The full protocols of the ses
sion have already been presented to the
state department. As pertinent to the
general subject, I call your attention to
the operations of the national board of
health, established by act of congress,
approved March 3,1879. Its sphere of
duty was enlarged by acts of June 2, of
the same yeir. By the last named act
the board was required to institute such
measures as might be deemed necessary
for preventing the introduction of infec
tions or contagious diseases from foreign
or countries into the United States, or
