ALL PROPOSALS SO

Goventinent Officials Fail in Ef-i
forts to End Strike at This I
Time i
Washington, Nov. 27.?An abrupt
end came late today to all attempts
to settfe the nationwide cool ?trdrei
by peaceful agreement.
Miners and operators spent a bleak j
Thanksgiving afternoon in embitter
ed debate over the government pro
posal for a 14 per cent wage increase,
made last night by Fuel Administra
tor Garfield, and rejected it and
every other proposal that was forth
coming, and then dissolved, sine die.
Participants went home' tonight,
and where the* break left coal strike
conditions, no one of them, miner or
operator, would, say. Likewise, in
^official quarters, there was silence.
Acting President John L. Lewis of
the mine workers, though refusing to
jsay one word as to the strike itself,
. which theoretically was called off in
obedience to federal court injunction
holding it a violation of the Lever
act for war time food and fuel con- j
. trol, scored the government roundly
at the conclusion of the conference.
So did William Green, secretary of
the minr workers.
Operators, though accepting the
government proposal definitely, in a
letter of explanation to Dr. Garfield
which they made public, intimatdd
that the governmental refusal to al
low price increases would bear recon
sideration. V
It. was. behind closed doors that the j
coal" situation reached its climax to-i
day, after involving the full attention j
of the federal government for two?
days previously. There was much j
heated oratory but T. W. Guthrie of'
Pittsburgh, acting chairman of thej
operators' committee, described the
parliamentary procedure succinctly as
heV<^?snre- -?aer-v-T!? -operators,-; hy a'
?prearranged plan, notified the min
ers* 6cale committee for the central
competitive field of their acceptance j
of Dr. Garfield's plan.
This the mine workers promptly
voted down. In turn, the miners put:
forward a counter proposal, that Sec-!
retary Wilson'? suggestion for a 31.66 j
per cent, wage increase be granted:, j
and this the operators flatly refused. I
3Tor the third time the operators re-!
hewed their formal offer of arbltra- ?
tion and the miners, voted this down. '
?By unanimous vote adjournment was!
taken.
"The operators are pretending to!
accept Dr. Garfield's proposal,'* Mr. !
Lew's said, manifesting scorn and in- j
dignation as he called the newspaper
? men around him in the littered and !
noisy hall that was the scene of the j
all day gatherings.
"But as they do it, they state they j
are unable to operate many of their:
mines under it. ' It would be foolish
for us to attempt to make an agree-'
ment unless miners are to be given j
work.
"Our position is unchanged. We!
. hold the United States government 1
can not break its word. The pledge J
of Secretary Wilson to grant us a 31
fper cent increase must be redeemed.
In my judgment Dr. Garfield and the
cabinet have committed the most j
colossal blunder in the history of our j
nation. They are blindly following an
academic theory without regard to
justice to the mine workers or effects
on the people of the United States.
"Responsibility for the crisis now
confronting the nation must be with ;
those states using the powers of gov- j
erament to oppress and deny justice to 1
a great element of its citizenship di- 1
rectly concerned in industry.
"I can not believe the people of j
our country will indorse such a policy |
of oppression and repression, which i
means continued industrial chaos'
and intense suffering on the part of
the mine workers and our citizen- i
?hip."
With that, Lewis brushed away all ,
Questioners. His associates, however,
confirmed the impression that there
would be no resumption of work in i
the mining camps now closed.
Operators less communicative, went;
away with varying resolutions. One
or two had reached a determination i
they said to attempt coal production
Regardless of the strikers, but most j
of them were in doubt on this point.
Atcin;: Chairman Guthrie indicated j
that an organized body they had:
ceased to function, and that individ- j
ual necessity and inclination would
govern their action, though all would j
wait a little to see what the govern-1
ment proposed. i
The open letter to Dr. Garfield said ;
that in view of the serious situation,
the wage scale committee for the cen- |
tral field would accept his suggested
basis of settlement, preserving pres
ent differentials."
"At the same time we wish to call i
your attention to the fact that the
acceptance of this increase in wages
Without any increase in selling price

STATES POSITION
I
[Discusses World Politics in
House of Commons in Re
; ply to Questions
I
THE WORLD LOOKS TO
j
PRESIDENT WILSON
.He is Charged With Duty of
: Calling Meeting of World
Council
London. Nov. 27 (By the Associated
Press?Premier Lloyd George again
today stood on the floor of the house
of commons and answered a lengthy
list of questions on all subjects, most
ly, however, in connection with the
European economic and military sit
uation arising from the war.
One of the most important of the
questions related to the condition of
Austria, concerning which Com dr.
Viscount Curson. coalition Unionist
member for Battersea South, asked
whether the supreme council in Paris
was taking steps to deal with the sit
uation.
The premier declared that the su
preme council had reached the con
clusion that only a comprehensive ar
rangement for a large international I
credit would adequately meet the sit- 1
uation and that it was essential for
the success of such a proposal ^that
th& United tSates should contribute
that part of the expenditures which
would' have to be incurred in dollars.
"Urgent representations have ac- J
cordingly been made to the United I
States government in this sense,' the
premier added."
Questioned regarding whose duty
it would be to summon the first meet
ing of the assembly and the first
mooting of the council of the league'
of nations in view of the fact of the!
American senate's refusal to ratify j
the Versailles treaty. Mr. Lloyd j
George said that Article 4 ot the treaty
stipulr ed th; " the president of the
United State.? .;ouId summon the
meeting. He added that he did not
understand that this wa? in any way
affected by the refusal of the Ameri
can senate to ratify the treaty^,
' AnothoK inquiry! "nfade ny James
M. Hogge, advanced radical and
Scottish home rule member for Edin
burgh, was whether Mr. Lloyd George
gave any undertaking to President
Wilson during the peace conference
that Mr. Lloyd George would en
deavor to settle the Irish question.
This brought a direct negative reply.
Answering still another question
the premier said that the effect of the
American senate's action with regard
to the treaty provisions for plebiscite
and other commissions in Germany j
would be only indirect. It would be j
necessary for the other powers to find !
a larger quota of representatives for |
these commissions.
The premier said that the Anglo- [
French-American treaty providing for
the defense of France in cose of wan
ton attack was contingent on ratifica
tion by the United States senate, but
that America's refusal to ratify the
peace trctay would not necessarily ef
fect the tri-partite treaty, provided the
United States ratified the tri-partite
part separately.

request for the immediate release of
Consular Agent Jenkins, who is im
prisoned at Puebla. Mexico, the lat
est American note to Mexico which
was made public today arraigns the

studied attempt to ensnare the Amer
ican agent in the intricacies of legal
proceedings. No ultimatum is served
however, and no indication is given
what the government's course will be
if Jenkins be not immediately releas
ed.

I Washington, Xov. 28.?The govern
i ment served blunt notice on soft coal
I miners and operators tonight that in
1 terferencc with coal production would
j not be tolerated. Warning that legal
j prosecution would be employed to
?'thwart conspiracies by either si3e
atid troops sent wherever necessary
t? protect miners willing to work
came from the department of justice
after members of the cahinet had con
sidered every phase of the fuel sit
uation, admittedly critical, in view of
the abrupt breaking off of negotia
tions.
It is not the intention of the gov
ernment to let the mines remain idle
with half of the country in the grip
of cold wea'h^r and the coal stocks
rapidly dim ..shing. The administra
tion it was said, by those in a posi
tion to know, had fully expected the
miners to reject the 14 per cent wage
Increase offered by Fuel Administra
tor Garfield. Anticipating this, plans
had been considered for augmenting
the present output of bituminous
mines officially figured at better than
40 per cent of normal.
A statement by Assistant Attorney
General Ames, issued late in the day,
gave assurance to ail miners that
they would bo afforded ample pro
i tection if they returned to work,
even if troops had to be called out.
i This was the only definite state
! ment of policy' from the government,
j In official circles it was said that, the
I federal authorities were determined to
force resumption of operations on the
terms laid down by the fuel adminis
j trator.
I The department of justice .stater
I ment- called'attention: to' the"fact that,
j mstruetions issued heretofore by the
! war department in connection with
I the possible use of troops in coal field
regions still were in effect, and that
department commanders stood ready
to guard the fields the instant their
j aid was required by the State au
i thorities.
Operators tonight set out to re
sume production, so far as that was
possible under the muddled condi
tions by teleg. phing notice for
j posting at mines everywhere offering
i an increase of 14 per cent for all men
j willing to work.
i There were fe\v oppressions as to
! how this information might be re
j ceiv^d, but representatives of the
i miners here still declared it would
j be no incentive, and that it would be
ignored, especially in the central com
I pet hive fields, embracing the States
i of Ohio, Tliinois, Indiana and Western
j Pennsylvania. Operators, however, be
j lieved that it would draw large num
! hers to the mines and that next
t week would see a big increase in the
! daily soft coal output.
Dr. Garfield had explained earlier
iin the day that he regarded 14 per
I cent a just wage increase for mine
workers and that mine owners who
; did not cooperate with the govern
. ment would find their properties
j taken over 'and operated by the fuel
! administration.
! John Lewis, acting president of the
\ Tnited Mine Workers, who had borne
j the brunt of the wage negotiation
I fighting, went home tonight, worn out
j by the long wrangle. Before leaving
j for Indianapolis. Lewis saw Secretary
j of I.abor Wilson and Samuel Go7np
! ers. president of the American Feder
| ation of Labor. He did not have
j much to say and explained that he
! had arranged with Gompers to hav?
! the federation's lawyers assist coun
1 sei for the miners in perfecting their
appeal from the ruling of Federal
Judge Anderson ordering the coal
strike order canceled.
In labor and official oircles the
meeting of Lewis and Gompers was
regarded as significant, but there was
no statement concerning questions
discussed except Lewis' reference to
seek'ng counsel.
After leaving Secretary Wilson's
office Lewis said:
"Dr. Garfield represents: the govern
ment. Mr. Wilson told me that to
day."
This was taken by Lewis to mean
that the 14 per cent, wage offer was,
definitely and finally, the govern
ment's offer, and that Mr. Wilson's
proposal for a .'11 per cent, advance
had been rejected by the cabinet. So
far as obtaining: help for bis Pinion
Lewis realized that 14 per cent, was
ail he might expect.

? 'All the Cnited States attorneys in
