E Bp' -The statement of the injustice and tho

HHB&'' Inequitable and illogical" Tariff Law is foar-
KTi lesely characterized. And the recommenda-
HKn ' tlon is squarely urged of an extension of tho
KB' tree list and a reduction of the duties on the
fljKs necessities of the people.
HHr; The President truly says that this is not a
RHk Question of free trade or protection. " It is

T. V. Powdeiilt, General Master Workman
of tho KniRhts of Labor, is resolutely op

of Anarchy. Ho has devoted his best efforts
to driving this element from his order.
As the Federation is gradually assuming an

two significant facts that tho intelligent

The wielding of the professional razor
would appear to bo a perennial joke, accord
ing to the funny papers. But, as n matter of
fact, tho barbers oro one of tho most over
worked as well as the most useful classes in
tho community.
It is certainly a vory roasonablo proposi

eighty-six hours per weok, and that tho
provalont custom of boarding with bossos
should bo abolished.
Let tho barbers form thoir union, adopt a
good approntico system, arrange for arbitra
tion of disputes, and insist on fair treatment
in the matter of wages and hours. They
have tho sympathy of every man to whoso
creature comforts they so deftly administer.

Ten-yoor-old Froddy Eellly, who so ter.
ribly tortured four.yosr-old Tommy Jonos
yesterday at the Homo of the Blstors of
I'eaco, 78 Grand street, Jersey City, of which
both boys are Inmatos, was arraigned in Jus
tice Stllslng's Court this morning.
Tho injured boy was uuablo to appear, ns
ho is lying in a critical condition at thy
Homo. Pollco Capt. Farrior told the story
of tho caso.
It seems that tho two boys wero left alone
in tho kitchon of the Homo for a fow minutes
yesterday morning.
Young Reillv is described as a boy pos
sessed of a character purely devilish. Ho
nroved it by seizing his playmate, gagging
him with a haudkorchlof, stripping him of
every stitoh of clothing and holding him on
the red-hot lids of the kitchen range
The gag proventcd any outory by the child
until ho had been terribly burned. When
it slipped off In his struggles his shrieks
brought Sister Evangeline to tho kitchen in
timo to safe his life.
Dr. Gray was summoned and everything
done to save tho child's life, but it is now a
question of life or death. Tho boy's suffer
ings aro described us awful.
When ltellly was asked by Justice Stilslng
why he burned tho child, no answered with
out a trace of tears: "I was kinder mad at
him for HOiuethiu'."
Tho was remanded to await tho result of
Jones's injuries. A fow days ago ho stolo a
bunk containing CO cents from u playmate,
and for this ho was also committed.

COMPLICATED MUSICAL AFFAIRS.
A Vexed Question of Representation In the
Central I.abor Union.
Tho 2,500 membors of the Musical Mutual
Proteotivo Union aro greatly agitated over
tho complicated state of affairs arismg out of
thoir attempted affiliation with the central
trades and lr.bor bodies.
Under a former administration no repre
sentation wu sought in tho Central Labor
Union by tho Musical Union, but a change
in tho officers brought about a representation
in tho Central Union.
Lately the latter expelled tho delegates of
tho MubIcsI Union, but tho lialfe MuBioal
Club, which is composed of members of the
Musical Union, has a representation in tho
Central Labor Union.
Now tho Musical Union men want to know
why tho Central Labor Union does not expel
tho Iiulfo Club, or, orgo, why have the Balfe
Musical Mutual Unlonpnen a representation
in the Central Union ?
The annual election of officers of tho Musi
cal Mutual Protective Union will toko plaoe
next Thursday, at CI East Fourth stroet. The
annual meeting will bo hold at 2 p. m. tho
name day in tho Gonuania Assembly Rooms,
2'J1 and 2V3 Bowery.
Alexander Drouier and Anthony Roiff are
candidates for President, and W. II. Anstead
and Henry Ottes for Secretary. The latter
represents tho Knights of Labor in the
union and is said to bo anxious to havo that
body get control of tho Musical Union. He
is a member of the llalfo Club. Tho regular
ticket is likely to bo elected.

VISIONS OF A6PE0TRE THAT DROVE JOHN
J, DELANEI TO CONFESS.
Calm To.Doy After Telling; Police Capt.
Campbell, of Ilrooklyn, How He Admin
latered Itat Poison to Pretty Mary Jnnr
Cox Preferring tho Prosper! of Death on
the) (tallow to Tortures of Itrmnnw.
John J. Dclnnoy, tho confessed murderer
of young Mary Jano Cox, who was found
dead in her home, 110 Prince street, Brook,
lyn, on tho morning of June 3 last, is still
locked behind tho bars in Capt. Campbell's
station-house.
When a World reporter saw him this morn
ing his face was worn and haggard. His eyes
were sunken in his head, and his whole ap
pearance gave evidonco of tho mentalstrug
gle that he haB endured since he deliberately
gavo the girl he betrayed the poison which
she innocently drank and which caused her
death.
From that timo until the present tho pris
oner has had hut little peace of mind.
According to his own story, try as ho
would, he could not escapo the tortures of
remorso. No matter what expedients ho re
sorted to, drink or dissipation of any kind,
the result was always the same. He could
novcr rest. Walking or while at work, awake
or asleep, his crime was ever in his thoughts.
Ever, as he says in explanation of his sur
render, tho spirit of tho murdered girl roue
beforo him. Ho saw her just as he left her
on that fatal night. There sho sat in the old
fushioned kitchon chair which sho was so
wont to ocoutiy during his visits.
Even tho glass containing tho sediments of
tho deadly mixturo seemed at her elbow, and
tho faco, which in lifo was always pretty nud
happy, appeared beforo him palo, appealing
and accusing.
In his sleep he saw her. Tho spirit seemed
to hover around his bed. Ho would wake in
the middle of the night with perspiration
rolling down his face, and then the figure
would disajMiear. Rut the moment he sought
rest it would return and haunt him.
This lasted for months. His face become
pale and careworn. His companions no
ticed the change and wondered at it, as well
as at his forced merriment.
Then in place of an occasional drink he
took many. His position, which ho strove
hard to keep, was lost. lie found compan
ions in barrooms and among tho Idwest
classes, and in thoir midst sought in vain to
drown his haunting thoughts.
Finally, so desperate did he become that for
weeks, according to the statement of a friend
of his sister's, the young man never drew a
sober breath.
Then, when at last the strain seemed
unbearable, he determined to acknowledge
his guilt. What tho consequences wero, ho
did not stop to considor, and last Saturday
night ho started for the Adams Btreet pollco
station in Brooklyn.
Tho confession required moro courage than
ho possessed, so he began to drink. With
tho extra stimulant his timidity forsook him
and at tho station-houso ho grew bold and
loft without any explanation of his visit.
Sunday came and with it roturnod his re
morso. All through tho long hour of that
day the spirit of tho dead girl was before
him. He says he thought of the consequences
of a confession and resolved not to mako ono
for fear of the gallow s.
But tho longer he thought tho weaker grew
his resolution, until Snnday night, with n
full knowledgo of tho fact that probably
death would bo his punishment, 0 again
started for the police station.
This time ho did not falter, but explained
his connection with tho murdorand told
how when tho girl naked him for medicino
he deliberately bought rat poison, mixed it
with water and without explaining tho nature
of the mixture, gave it to the girl, who drank
it and died.
A great load seemed taken from his mind
after making the confession and ho talked
rationally. When his statement had been
read to him by Capt. Campbell, ho acknowl
edged it. Then ho was lookod up. For the
first time in five months ho found rest. All
Monday ho seemed easy and last night he
slept like a top. To-day ho .was perfectly
calm.
Dolauey is a young man with a smooth and
pleasant placo and regular features. Since
tho death of his father, who was killed on the
Bridge three years ago, and of his mother,
who died broken hearted, he has gone to the
bad.
His brother William is a successful printer
and the only sister, Kate, a girl sixteen years
old, lives with Mrs. McCabe, on tho corner
of Hudson and Park avenues, Brooklyn. An
uncle is a policeman, also in Brooklyn. Capt,
Campbell will tako his charge beforo Justice
Walsh to-day.

KL'SIOKED HER UMBRELLA.
Miss Juliet Corson Grateful to an Unknown
bnt Eeeentrlo Person.
Miss Juliet Corson's umbrella is restored !
When that good lady went to the Motropol
itan Oporo-Houso last Saturday to enjoy that
Wagnerian puree, Siegfried, sho supported
herself with an invislblu-groon silk umbrella
and tho delightful thought of tho Gargantuan
month of tho dragon.
When sho left all tho rnptnro of seeing
countless menus dlsappcnr, in fancy, down
the Saurinn's vasty throat was dispelled.
Homebody who does " not let his right hand
know what his left doeth " had abstracted the
umbrella.
The umbrella was a cherished stiok. It
had an oxidized silver handle and " J. C."
was delicately gn-vcu on its head. But its
great aluo was as a memory. It was the
gift of a dead friend.
Miss Corson rushed into print. Yesterday
evening sho had heard nothing. She then
thought that she would try tho Metropolitan
Opera-House on a forlorn chauco.
You haven't heard of my umbrella, I
suppose," she suid to Mr. McLaren.
"Miss Corson, prepnro yourself. Your
umbrella is hero !" said that worthy. " It
was handed in just now."
The abstractor of the umbrella had brought
it back, but deliberately denied himself this
unique chance to win a doathlcss fnino as tho
Great Restorer who had brought back an
umbrella!
" It has given mo a very optimistic view of
human nature," suid Miss Corson to a Woblu
reporter this morning. " It suited mo so
well, and v as not as conspicuous as a cane.
I have a collection, you see," sho said, point
ing to a number stacked in tho corner of her
bright llttlo room. " but this lost ono was
the pet. Do say, if you write anything about
it, that I am so grateful to tho person who
brought it back. I fancy all sort of delight
ful motives that they could havo had in doing
it, and feel truly thankful."
DREARY DAYS FOR MURDERERS.
Dan Drlscoll a Hero of the Dime Novel Order
fur Diiu Lyons.
Tho days pass slowly for the condemned
murderers in tho Tombs. Tho two Dannys
Drlscoll and Lyons uro locked up from
morning till night. They are on opposite
Bides of Murderers' Row, and their only re
laxation is to place their mouths against tho
bars and shout out greetings to each other.
A hundred times a day tho corridor re-echoes
with such cries as, "Hollo. Danny, how
d'yo liko the soup ? " " Cheer up old man,
I've had a good feed and I'm going to tako a
nap."
Warden Walsh sizes up Lyons as a man
whoso head has been turned by reading dime
novels. Ho says Lyons looks upon Driscoll
as a first-class hero, and worships him ac
cordingly. " Lyons is the smarter man, though' said
tho Wurdon to a World reporter this morn
ing. " See thoso two iron bars that thoy cut
from their cots. Lyons had tho senso to cut
off tho curvod end and use it as a jimmy.
Driscoll didn't know enough for that, and
sawed off a straight pieco of iron."
Mr. Howe intends to move on Monday for
a new trial on the ground of newly discovered
evidence Tho caso is the first to come up
under the now provision of tho codo of civil
procedure and Mr. Howe is unusually con.
fldent of tho success of his application.
Sullivan and Blake. Lyons' counsel, got
tho minutes of the trial from District-Attorney
Martiuo this morning, and will argue tho
appeal in the early part of next month.
Adolph Reich, tho wife murderer, is tho
most friendless prisoner in tho Tombs. Ho
mopes all day long, novor takes exercise, and

Tho production of "Elaino"at tho Madi
son Squnro Theatre to-night will be extremely

havo mourned.
J. Barton Key, before starting for Balti
more, discussed Mr. Miner's methods to a
very considerable extent with his theatrical
friends It is thought that thero will bo what
is popularly and graphically known as a
lively time, if no satisfactory arrangement is
made between the two gentlemon.
" A Holo in tho Ground " will be given at
tho Fifth Aveuuo Theatre next week. This
is generally looked upon as a remarkable
error in managerial judgment, in view of the
fact that tho play was presented at the Peo
plo's Theatre, in the Bowery, and comes from
thero to a high-class house, thus revorsing
the usual order of things.
Erdelyi Kaczi and his famous orchestra be

" Tho Arabian Nights" was duly produced

this burlebquo is tho libietto of Alfred
Thompson, which is so full of absurd local
allusions, puns and rubbish that it dotracts
ono's attention from the beauty of the
