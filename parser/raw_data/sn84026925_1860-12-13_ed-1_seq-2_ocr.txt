It does; and this is the way the North has J
been getting rich, while you have been just
living comfortably; and nothing but the
kind providence of God, in giving you articles
which the whole world needs, has
kept you from hopeless ruin long ago.
no. vn.
There is a reason why the Southern
States should leave the Union, which will
satisfy the most abject submissionists in
the South, which I would not venture to
suggest, if it were not absolutely certain
that South Carolina will secede, and were
there not strong reasons to believe that at
least two other States will follow her ex..
ample. I would not suggest it, because
the Abolitionists have never yet thought of
it, and I would not remind them of it for
all this world's treasure, if I were sure the
Southern States would remain in the Union.
I present it in brief, by itself, lest it
should be overlooked in a long article, or
be excluded from papers which will not
publish long articles, no matter how important
they may be. Do you know, people
of the South, that the Black Republicans
can, by the enactment of one single
constitutional law, of twelve words, accomplish
their aims to the full measure of their
wishes 1 When I say constitutional law,
I mean a law within the letter of the Constitution.
Here it is; "No products of
slave labor shall be exported from the
United States." Congress has the power
of regulating commerce between the United
States and foreign nations. Congress
did, in 1807. stop (by an embargo) (^commerce
between this country and foreign
nations, and that, too, on the motions and
votes of Southern men; and that was one
of the grievances of the Hartford conventionists.
Congress may forbid the exportation
of particular articles. How would
you answer these arguments in support of
such a law? Under such a law, what
would your cotton, sugar, rice and tobacco
be worth ? And what would the labor
that produces them be worth ? Thank God,
South Carolina is safe !

FROM CONNECTICUT.
We had a high gratification afforded us
a day or two since by Governor Gist, in
being shown a letter from a noble son of
Connecticut, full of wise and patriotic seniimpnts.
and fixnressincr entirn annrnval of
the stand which South Carolina has taken.
The sincerity of the writer's view is farther
attested by a check for SI,000 on New
York, enclosed in the letter, with a request
that it be invested in the new issue of
South Carolina 6 per cent, stock, intended
to raise funds for arming the State.
This i9 a most sigrificant indication. It
furnishes gratifying evidence that, as the
writer says, the game is nearly played out
and the reaction just at hand. So mote it
V1*1
By permission of Governor Gist, we
make the following extracts fom this letter.
Uur readers, we are sure, will relish them
keenly, as well as the Governor's reply :
"Enclosed I hand you bank check on
New York, to your order, for one thousand
dollars, which you will please collect, and
invest for me in the new emmissionof South
Carolina 6 per cent, stock, proposed by her
Legislature to raise funds for the defence
of her constitutional rights.
"Believing, as I do, that South Carolina
has ever been one of the most faithful sentinels
on the citadel of State Rights, aud
that her watchfulnesss has been one of the
main causes of preventing the General
Mflt Government from verging from a mere
agent into an absolute master through the
operations of the old leaven of Federalism,
under the various names that the demagogues
of the North have seen fit to disguise
it, I cannot but view the stand now
taken by South Carolina as (he only onele/t
to put down effectually the demon of fanaticism
now and for all future time.
"Had our fathers settled the matter in
1820, in strict accordance with that contract
of the sovereign States, instead of basely
compromising the rights therein secured,
we should not now be fighting that battle,
over again. In the present instance, South
Carolina, 'asks for nothing but what is
clearly her right.' Compromises will be
offered to cheat her into the surrender of
those rights, but as a friend to liberty, I
beg of her never to submit.
"The game however, is about "played
out." The reaction has begun, and when
the fog blows off and reason asserts its em
pire, and those poor, deluded creatures see
the fearful precipice to which they have
been blindly led by Seward, Sumner, Douglas,
Lincoln, and the like, then will these
demagogues find New England, even, too
hot to hold them. As sure as that night
follows day, so sure will this extreme of
fanaticism here be followed by the extreme
of popular fury against the leaders of the
miscalled Republican party, when the tumult
shall have died away."
The Reply of Governor Gist.
Executive Office. 1
Columbia, S. C., Dec. 7, 1860. j
Dear Sir: On the occasion of a fire in
Charleston, a crowd was collected near the
burnt spot, and a Freuchman riding up
asked what they were doing ? The reply
was that they were sympathizing with the
sufferers. The Frenchman, pulling out
810, said, "I smypathize this much, how
much do you sympathize ?" And we now
call such acts French sympathy.
For your substantial sympatny, be pleased
to accept the thanks of the State, and
be assured that the moral influence of your
patriotic act is worth infinitely more to us
than ten times the amount given in any
other way. It will commend itself to every'
citizen of our State, and after this no one
will have the boldness, if he has the meanness,
to refuse to contribute to the defence
of his native State.
The money shall be drawn and applied
as you direct, and I am satisfied you will
never lose a dollar. If we should be overrun
by superior numbers and become a conquered
province, some patriot will be left
to conceal enough gold in our mountain
recesses to refund the amount due you,
with interest.
I hereby acknowledge the receipt of ?H>ur
draft for 81,000.
With great respect, 1 am yours, &c.

There is much feeling here on account

Arkansas will lead in a secession movement.
If South Carolina, Georgia and other Southern

THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 1860.
THE PRESIDENT ON SECESSION.
We lay before our readers, to day, the portion
of the Mr. Buchanan's Message which relates
to Secession; and, we doubt not, they will
give it an early and attentive perusal. His
heart is evidently with the South. Brave and
honest as he is, he must sympathize with an
injured people struggling for the right and the
just in spirit, even to the tearing down of itb
lettered corruption and defilement. He denies
the right of Secession. At the same time he
denies the right of Coercion. He refers the
whole matter, however, to Congress. Meanwhile,
he will administer the laws, and collect
the revenues; but declares that he has no righ t
to do the latter by means of revenue cutters.
According to Mr. Buchanan's position, it is
evident that, as there is no law now for the
'dirty work," South Carolina, when she gets
out of the Union, will have to be whipped in,
under an ex post-faclo law. He simply regards
the government as defective just here. We
think not. We think that our forefathers wisely
provided for a peaceable rupture, in case we
could not live together. Such is now the case.
Right or wrong in the eye of abolitionists and
Union-savers, we that feel we "have our quarrel
just" in the eye of God ; and we will "go ahead"
with a firm tread and atrusting heart.
OUR FREE-NEGRO POPULATION.
The Legislature of our sister State did one ,
good thing last week, in passing a bill to prohibit
the freeing of slaves by will. A memorial
from Currituck was offered to compel free negroes
either to go North, or to go into slavery.
This memorial is, also, in accordance with the
genius and spirit of our institutions. The theory
of the South is, that the negro can do better,
protected as the white-man's slave, than downtrodden
and spit out of society in a state of
nominal freedom. The theory of the North is,
that the negro ought to be free to -work for himself,
and also free to freeze to death or starve.?
The free-negroes of the South should choose
their lot?one way or the other. There is no
mid-way ground.
The lot of the free-negro either North or
South, is a hard one; because he is out of his
sphere. He is thrown loose upon civilized so
ciety, at best a white washed barbarian, to be
crushed beneath its mighty energies and activiities,
as the Indian has been. Only a few centuries
ago, the negro was taken, a wild and naked
savage, from the deserts of Africa. Providence
has brought him to this country to be
Christianized and saved through the bible-insti
tution of negro servitude ; and as a granite basis,
to "raise and support" the marble temple
of the noblest civilization the world has yet
known. This is plainly the will of God. Africa
is the negro's proper place of freedom and debasement
; America was set apart for his slavery
and amelioration.
SECESSION AT WASHINGTON.
A paragraph from the Capital to the Richmond
Enquirer, holds the following pertinent
and suggustive language : Two hundred men are
enlisted here for South Carolina, most of them
clerks. I am told there are hot secessionists,
members of Congress, from Southern Illinois.?
They say they will split the State and go with
the South. It is well understood that Washington
will be the capital of the Southern Confederacy,
in case we all go out, as we must do
in the end. Montgomery, Alabama, has been
spoken of, but the holding of the old capital
will give us prestige abroad, as if we held the
battle ground. England is expected to mediate
for a peaceful separation. Any serious diminution
of the cotton crop, such as would result
from civil war in this country, would ruin England.
COMMISSIONERS TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
Mr. Buchanan, it is said, regards secession
during his administration as a reflection on him- '
self (!) and, therefore, begs the Southern members
of his Cabinet and the leaders of the Demo- ,
cratic party to aid him in urging South Carolina
to postpone action until he has retired to private
life (1!). He has sent Wm. Henry Trescott, assistant
Secretary of State, a native Carolinian,
to make a solemn appeal to Gov. Gist. It is
said that Governor Letcher, of Virginia, is also i
arranging a commission to proceed at once to i
South Carolina, urging her to delay her contem- i
plated secession. Ex-President Tyler, Senator i
Hunter, and Hon. W. C. Rives, will probably be
the names indicated. Similar steps have been i
taken by the Governor of Kentucky. VicePresident
Breckinridge, Hon. James Guthrie, ,
1 mi .
auu ucumui vi nicuuvu, lire bpoaeu 01. TD18
action is to be followed by all the Executives of
the border States.
It is said that Thompson, Floyd, Cobb, Jeff. ;
Davis and others have acceded to this request; ,
but two prominent members of South Carolina
regarding the President's plan of delay, as "a ,
deep laid conspiracy to prevent disunion," have ,
telegraphed and written to Gov. Gist to hold
fast, and go out promptly Gov. Gist has sim- ,
ply nothing to do with the matter?it is the business
of the Convention alone. It is too late to
influence that. Two thirds of its members, perhaps,
are committed to prompt and final secession.
DELAY-AS ALLEGORY.
Once upon a time?as the story tellers begin?
there was a fleet of fifteen vessels out on a stormy
sea. It was a pitchy dark night; but they
were nearing a broad, deep harbor, and a great
pharos?or light-house?directed each ship in
the safe way to the shore. Now the winds and
the waves had scattered them all about; but one
was far ahead. Those behind did not know
where each other were ; but they all knew where
the foremost was, for they could see the flag at
its mast-head flutter and flash through the storm,
[ in the light of the pharos, or light-house. Moreover,
to those behind, the cliffy and dangerous
parts of the shore appeared like dense clouds on
the horizon ; and, in spite of the breadth of the |
harbor, they were in danger of drifting to the|l
rocks on either side, and so perishing. Bat the
ihip before could see the dangers, and shun them.
Notwithstanding these facts, the pilots of the
binder ships began to cry out to the one ahead?
"Wait, and lets all go into the harbor together" ;
Mid, forthwith, called to each other "come hither
! come hither!" In those old, old days, men
had "lungs of brass" and the voice of a Cyclops ;
and you may depend, the pilots, who roared
with all their might, could be heard. Their
cries, however, were wisely heeded not; and so
that pennon, streaming away up in the Btormy
light, guided all safely ashore. We doubt not,
if the foolish calls of the pilots had been listened
to, in their efforts to get together on the dark
Bea instead of the luminous shore at the light
house, the ships would have been scattered far
and wide, and wrecked upon the rock-ribbed
coast.
THE NEW CONFEDERACY.
The N. Y. Herald's Washington correspondent
says: There is no use disguising what is before
us. Cool and sagecious observers see no prospect
of avoiding a rupture. By the 1st of February,
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi
and Florida will be out of the Confederacy.
By that time, they will have consummated
such an understanding with France and
Great Britain as will enable them even to set
Federal coercion, should it bo attempted, at
defiance. They will insert in their Constitution
a clause prohibiting the importation of Africans,
which will tend to conciliate the border States,
and in a short time every one of the latter, except
Delaware, perhaps, will join the Southern
Confederacy. This denouement is considered so
certain, that already the minds of statesmen are
almost exclusively turned to projecting the
means and conditions of reconstruction.
OUR LEGISLATURE.
The following bills have been read one or more
times in the Senate or the House : a bill to incorporate
the York Gas-Light Company; alpo
the Presbyterian Church of Yorkville; a bill on
selling liquor to slaves; a bill to have dead timber
near public roads cut down ; to amend the
law on house-burning ; to regulate (perhaps diminish)
the compensation of tax collectors ; to
extend relief to debtors (for the purpose, likely,
of preventing forced sales during these hard
times of secession and suspension): to provide
for a separate Court of Appeals (made an Act);
to repeal the law punishing Banks for suspension;
a bill to alter the sheep-and-dog law; to provide
for a coast police; for a foreign diplomacy ; a
bill to put all the laws relative to patrols in one
Act; to raise $500,000, by the issue of bonds,
to be placed at the disposal of the State; to enforce
attendance on drills ; to raise a military
force; to increase the powers of the Ordinary;
and a bill (reported) to sell free-persons of color
into slavery.
The annexed enquiries have been made of the
appropriate committees: whether further reg
ulation is necessary to prevent free-negroes from
carrying fire-arms ; whether it be expedient to
change the present free-school system into a
common-school system ; whether "stimnlant
liquors" should be inspected before they are offered
for Bale in the State ; whether South Carolina,
after secession, should levy a needful revenue
(to be reported on by bill or otherwise);
what the new State House will cost; and various
enquiries looking to the temporary suspension
of that work, its steady progress, or the
expenses to be incurred?first by suspension of
the work, and secondly bv its continuance.
Mr. Rhett offered the following resolution
(agreed to) in the House on Saturday :
Resolved, That in view of the secession of S.
Carolina, within a brief period, from the Federal
Union, a special committee be appointed, to
consist of seven members, for the purpose of
considering and reporting, at an early period,
what measures of extraordinary legislation may
be necessary or expedient, in reference to foreign
and domestic trade and other subjects, growing
out of our new relations with the Federal Government
and other nations.
The two houses cast a joint-ballot for Governor
and Lieutenant Governor, on Tuesday.
We herewith append a statement of the pay
and rations which are to be allowed to all?both
officers and privates?in the active service of
the State:
for the infantry service.

pay and rations hereinbefore allowed.
The commutation of each ration shall be 30
cents. The commutation of forage for each
borse, $8 per month. The commutation of clothing
for each soldier, per year, shall be $15.
TEXAS AND GOV. HOUSTONl
Gov. Houston, of Texas, refuses to convene
the Legislature of that State to call a Convention.
He has said, however, if the people wish
it, he will not stand in their way?he will re
sign. Meanwhile, meetings have been held* in
all the principal towns; and resolutions adopted
in favor of disunion. The Lone Star flag is everywhere
to be seen; and the talk is, in some
quarters, that Texas will set up alone-star government.
She has tried one Union. It has
failed. She will not try another, therefore.?
However this may be, her people are rife for secession
; and they will have a convention. There
is a general understanding among the members
of the Legislature, that they will convene in extra
session on next Monday, without a formal
call from Gov. Houston. The Legislature will
call a convention to meet, likely, on the 8th of
January. The convention will secede. Secession
will result in a new Union with the other
seceding States.
A PRETTY SIGHT I
The Lawrence Courier?a Whig Journal of
the Bay State?gives the subjoined graphic account
of an Abolition meeting held on the 2nd
instant, in Boston. Boston is the abode of sanctified
professors, and puritanical snobbishness.
She boasts of her literature and learned men?
of her high degree of culture and refinement;
indeed, as has been said, thinks herself "the
hub of creation." Look, now, on this side of
the picture:
The Abolitionists had a meeting in Tremont
Temple, Boston, on Monday forenoon, ostensibly
for the purpose of ascertaining "how shall American
slavery be abolished." The hall was
filled, the majority appearing to be opposed to
the Abolitionists, and the presiding officers were
elected by them. Fred. Douglas, J. Stella Martin
and other negroes essayed to deliver abolition
speeches, but they were hushed up, and
Fred. Douglas was pitched out of the door of
the hall into the street, as was also F. B. Sanborn,
of Concord. So much confusion prevailed
and the prospect of a row being evident, the ri
meeting; was dispersed by order of the Mayor, i(
and the hall was closed.
Ci
GEORGIA LEGISLATURE. "
The following preamble and resolution have
passed the Georgia Honse of Representatives, t<
by a vote of 101 yeas to 27 nays, and been forth- 0
with sent to the Senate: b
"The grievances now affecting the Southern $
States must be effectively resisted. The inter- g,
ests anc. destines of the sl&veholding States of
this Uni on are, and mast remain common. The n
secession of one from the Union must, more or b
less, involve and affect all. Therefore, cl
Resolved, That, in the judgment of this Gen- t|
eral Assembly, any State in this Union has the
sovereign right to secede from the Union, when- b
ever she deems it necessary and proper for safety,
honor, and happiness; and that, when a State 1
exercises this right of secession, the Federal
Government has no right to coerce or make war ri
upon her because of the exercise of such right
to secede; and should any Southern State secede
from the American Union, and the Federal n
Government makes war upon her therefor, Geor- a
gia will give to the seceding Southern State the t|
aid, assistance, encouragement and sympathy of
her entire people. And should the 8tate of b
Georgia, secede from the Union, by the action or *
theConrentionof her people, to assemble on the Sl
16th of January next, she asks the like sympa- .
thy and assistance from her Sonthern sisters
which she hereby offers to them." h
S
NORTH CAROUNA LEGISLATURE. ^
A bill has been referred to the Military Committee,
authorizing Governor Ellis to purchase ^
5000 Minnie rifles, 250,000 ball cartridgei, 10,000
boies of percussion caps, &c., &c.; and appropriaiing
$175,000 for the purpose. The ^
Legislature has not elected a successor to Mr. t
Clingmnn in the United States Senate. We are 0
heartily disappointed with their proceecRngTlast r
week. Almost all their time was dribbled away
in petty bills and elections, while scarce a t
thought seems to have been devoted to the gnve
and mighty future which is rushing to our em- ^
brace. No call of a Convention to decide ; almost
no preparation for an emergency; an incubug I
seems to reBt upon the Legislature.
flHSSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE. 3
This body has adjourned after calling a Con- g
vention to meet on the 7th January; and trans- g
acting some other business of importance look- |
ing to the co-operation of all the Southern States i
in the formation of a new Confederacy. The j
Governor was requested to appoint as many Com- ]
missioners, as in his judgment may be necessa- j
ry. to visit each of the slave-holding States, in ]
order to secure concerted action for the common (
defence and safety. j

EXPULSION.
A Georgia exchange suggests that we hold on '
to the Constitution and the Union, and exDel the i
Northern States from the present Confederacy!
With due regard to the Editor's opinion, we 1
think he is "milking the cow by the horns."
A CONFESSION. j
President Buchanan, in his Message, says, 'I ,
confess that I still greatly rely upon the good
sense and patriotic forbearance of the Northern
people.' Yes, and the Bible tells us to "confess j
our sins and forsake them." J
MECKLENBURG. \
This birth-place of the Revolution, where the 1
banner of Freedom was first thrown to the breeze {
on our continent, on the 20th May 1T5, is true
to its "ancient renown." A large and most ]
respectable meeting of her citizens has sent up
a 6et of stirring and trumpet-tongued resolutions '
to the North Carolina Legislature. The fire has t
broken out there. All hail, classic soil of liber
. . 1
ty, true to the past and the present!
GOV. GIST.
The Edgefield Advertiser proposes that this
patriotic and christian Statesman and Chief be
elected the first President, or Ruler, of the new
Republic of South Carolina. He has inspired
us with it feeling somewhat akin to veneration
by his high-toned purity and unswerving integrity
as Governor; and we could trust him most
readily to pilot the ship of State over the stormy
seas on which it is now floating. He is brave
without rashness, wise and prudent without
timid caution, and therefore "the man."
HEROIC.
A lady writer in the Charleston Mercury, offers
two hundred dollars for herself, and a
hundred for each one of two daughters, as the
beginning of a subscription by her sex towards
arming the State. This money is not to come
out of thu pocket of the husband and father ; but
is to be saved by curtailing expenses for dress
and amusement. Such patriotism is worthy of
the women of any age. Thrice are we armed,
when such heroism flashes out in the acts of our
women. A laurel wreath for Charleston and her
women!
THIRTY-THREE' AND 'PROTECTION.'
The House Commitee of one from each State,
fl
to whom was referred the part of the President's
message on Secession will "hitch," it is said, on
that part where the President recommends "protection"
"o slavery in all the Territories of the *
Union. The denial of this right to Southerners
to settle on the unoccupied soil purchased by our
common blood and treasure, will be an "overt
act" and an outrage. The committee of thirtythree?which
Southern members call a farce?
will likely be weak and stubborn enough to drive
the most conservative Southerner on it to the
wall. (
THE LAST SESSION.
A Washington correspondent of the New York
Utrald says :?The idea that this is the last session
of our National Congress, is becoming familiar
to thousands. Visitors at the White
House not uncommonly leave with the remark
that they have just looked on the last President
01 me UDuea oiaies. xne citizens 01 rriiauiug- j
ton, who see ruin staring them in the face if the e
Union should be broken np, look upon the signs ^
of the times with undisguised apprehension. It c
is a fearful responsibility now devolving on the (
North. Unless a large united effort is there (
made, and promptly, there will probably be two s
Confederacies before Lincoln's inauguration. a
"THUNDERS OF THE VATICAN."
The Northern press, both religious and secular,
for the last few weeks has been reeking with 1
the vilest charges, and the grossest threats.? c
Some say, the Secession movement was merely a u
scheme of the politicians to defeat Lincoln ; *
others, that it is the work of a class bont on re- ^
opening the African slave-trade; others still,
that "the money changers" havo done it to ere- ?
ate a "panicand still others, that it is the ^
mad work of ambitions men who are too weak ^
f
to acquire a broad national reputation. All
these are wilfully blind to the paramount cause ^
of disunion. Yet they are the very men who c
threaten coercion. Sumner says Massachusetts '
is ready to secede. Senator Hale has made a
speech that has caused furrows of wrath to gath- ^
er on the brow of every Southorn member. He 1
says that those who are preparing for secession, *
must also prepare for war. Messrs. Brown, ^
Iverson and Wigfall instantly met his sugges- 3
tion with defiance. The Republican members ^
of Congress will make no concessions ; and Sew- n
ard is said to be preparing to make "a great Y
speech" at an early day. He is to be their b
Achilles in the fight. They are making a tre- h
mendous fuss. The President's message has excited
one universal growl in their ranks. They ?
think Mr. Buchanan is in his dotage. They think 1
the South a set of enraged barbarians. They a
ive, they threaten, they bully. Meanwhile, de
it us see what "aid and consolation" Mr. Lin - uc
dId, when he gets into office, will find a bank- ct
apt treasury. es
Ihe Treasury has refused, for want of funds, Li
3 pay the members of the House, their dues.? di
?nly about $200,000 have been paid to mem- a
ers since the beginning of the session. Some in
60,000 duo for pensions on New Year's day, 1(
ave been ordered not be paid, unless Treasury w
otes (to the amount of $10,000,000 is proposed) tl
e issued promptly. None of the clerks in the
ifferent Departments will recieve a cent for
lis month's services. Poor Uncle Sam, we fear g
e is too poor to buy his grave-clothes!
MILITARY DEFENCE OF THE STATE. ^

They have received one or two readings ;
ut neither of them has as yet become an Act,
re believe. The groatest difficulty in the way ?
eems to be the manner in which the offiaers of a
he armed force are to be appointed?whether n
y the Governor with the concurrence of the [!
ienate, by the Legislature, or by the soldiers C.
hemselves. The whole force will likely consist f
f one Division, divided and subdivided into K
trigades, Regiments, Battalions and Companies
-the GeneralB of Division and Brigade to be K
ppointed by the Governor or Legislature ; and, si
a case an officer is killed or cashiered, his place ^
o be filled by the next in rank below him, and j-J
very officer even down to "dog-pelter" to rise ?
a regular gradation. The $400,000 will be
aised, not by direct taxation, but by loans od A
he credit of the State. We have no doubt that
,11 this "stock" will be speedily taken by the w
latriotic citizens of South Carolina. ci
)ELEGATES TO THE STATE CONVENTIOIT.
fa
We give below, as far as ascertained, the re- ^
ult of the District elections for delegates to the u
itate Convention. The original nomination has n
teen elected in our District; and they are "out e
.nd out" for secession. If any District or Par- e
sh in the State sends up a milk-and-water dele- n
;ation, we will mark the fact in some way. Wo,
lowever, do not anticipate any such thing. We n
.re now satisfied that the people will be as unani-^ ^
nous for secession, as was the Legislature in 8

MERE-MENTION. a
Gov. Moore, of Alabama, has appointed Col. "
lohn A. Elmore, of Montgomery, a Commission- 0
ir from that State to South Carolina. Mr. El- b
nore is a relative of Hon. Frank. H. Elmore, r
leceased, who filled the unexpired term of Mr. 8
lalhoun in the United States Senate. The a
ladets from our State at West Point, have re- y
igued their appointments, and will be home at
,n early day. The total amount of proper- ?
y in South Carolina is estimated at $342,526,1R7
her annual nroducts. at S52.725.382. You *
oay put this down in round terras, as four hun- r
Ired million dollars. The importation of f
Iry goods at New York for the past month is 0
ralued at $5,797,000, which is nearly half a mil- a
ion below the importation of November, 1859. 1
It has been recommended that all church- d
is offer up their united prayers in behalf of the f
Convention, on next Sabbath. Wm. H. c
jivingston & Co., of New York city, have reused
to fill an order from Messrs. Henerey &
Co., of Charleston, amounting to the poor sum j
if $53 13. The plea is "the position of Charleson
towards N. York and the North generally !" t
The New York Tribune says: "The Pesi- J
lent's Message insults reason, outrages humaniy,
falsifies history, and defies common sense."
t calls President Buchanan a liar. The ^
Vashington correspondent of the N. York Herald
ays that the members from South Carolina, y
Llabama, Georgia and Mississippi, drew pay and S
lileage to this date, which leaves the Treasury
rithout money for similar service to other mem- r
era." A dispatch says: The President ii
as given assurance that he will not reinforc e the b
arts of Charleston harbor. Maj. Anderson, at
'ort Moultrie, has not asked for more troops.? ti
'he best feeling prevails between the garrison \{
,nd the citizens. It is estimated that the A
ipreciation throughout tip country in the vali
of flour, wheat, cotton, wool, corn, State seirities,
railroad and bank stocks, negroes, real
tate and other property, since the election of
incoln, is not less than two hundred milliont of
illars. A dispatch from Washington says,
prominent manufacturer of Massachusetts, now
i Washington, declares that in thirty days
10,000 operatives in his State will be out of
ork, and that a great reaction is going on in
le public mind there.

n Explanation.
Rev. R. A. Ross requests us to say that he
as urged time and again, but refused, to be a
andidate for the Convention. Notwithstanding
lis, some of his friends, for whose partiality
e is grateful, determined to run him anyhow.?
if this determination he himself knew nothing,
ntil about noon of Wednesday, the 6th; and
lany of the people, not until after the day of
lection. As soon as he found it out, he requestd
his friends to go to work, and get him as
lany votes as they could; for even then, at that
ite hour, it could hardly be made a respectable
umber. He does not regard the vote cast for
im?and, we suppose, properly?as any test at
dl of his popularity in the District.

We are glad to say that a "Union Prayerleeting"
of all Christians and others who wish
3 attend, will be commenced in Yorkville this
vening, at the instance of President Anderson,
'he meetings will alternate between the churches
f the Methodist and A. R. persuasion. They
re to be weekly?on Thursday night?and will

'eraonal and Patriotic.
Hon. Augustus W. Burton, of the North Carlina
Senate from Cleveland, passed through
orkville on Saturday last, for his home in
helby. He is a resistance man of the longest
alibre. He says that be will leave the Senate,
' the Legislature of his State does not call a
onvention of the people. He spent but a few
ours with his friends and relatives of this place.
By the way, we learn that a paper is soon to
e established at Shelby, to advocate secession,
'ho material for it, we believe, is at the Yorkille
Depot, now. Has Mr. Burton "a hand in
ae pie !"
l Drive into the Country.
We threw aside our "Falcon" last Friday evenag?we
put on our boots and Sunday-coat?we
tctded from town, office and all?and a brisk
rive of eight miles mountain-wards, with a
mack of the news and a letter from "a friend
i Texas" as we went along, brought us to the
ospitable residence of Maj. Myles Smith?and
ar what ? Why, an old-fashioned singing party,
rith the rosy-cheeked, round-limbed, full-chestd
lasses, and the strong-lunged, clear-eyed
oys of the "blue-hills." It was a taste of
'merry Christmas times" to us. Such singing'
-clear, ringing, elastic, thrilling ; there was a
reshness, a heartiness, a life in it, only of the
ountry. Ye, who pine over your pale faces and
ough out your incipient consumption in airight
rooms in town; you ought to havewitnessd,
as we did in the whole event of the singing,
tie magic influence which out-of-doors air and
xercise work upon the eyes, cheeks and voice,
'hen, the cheerfulness, the freedom, the uuretrained
naivete that prevailed, were refreshing
o see among the happy people; and all the
thile impressed us with the truth so beautifully
xpressed by the poet:
"God made the country, and man made the town."
Many and many were the young folks there;
nd Maj. Smith and his estimable lady?whose
ery face and form remind us of the stately dames
nd sires fo the Revolution?presided over their
louse in the whole-souled and generous spinn
f old-time hospitality. The "ebonies" vrere
usy in waiting, or else in displaying their "ivoies"
or otherwise manifesting their intense
[ratification. Had Mr. Buchanan been there,
nd seen the perfect security that reigned, he
rould have "eaten" his late message, where he
gnores all the grave and grievous wrongs of the
louth, and refers the secession excitement merey
to a vague sense of fear and insecurity. We
alked with the people; and there seems unaninous
readiness to defend our rights at the point
if the bayonet. New Centre is a pleasant part
if our District; the country is rolling and hilly ;
,nd the landscape views are frequently cbarmng
to the eye. We returned to town on Saturlay
morning much gratified, and heartily thankul
for the kindness of this drive into "the hill
lountry."

Mr. Simonton in the Legislature, in enumeraing

We wonder why.
We don't see it.
The Columbian Confederacy.
Four weeks ago, our readers will remember,
re suggested this style and title for the new
louthern government about to be inauguarted.
When "Rome was the world," the prondest
cply to a foreigner's challenge, in whatever land
I might be made, or in whatever tongue it might
e uttered, was?"I am a Roman citizen."
When, in the years to be, we wander in dieant
lands, wo hope to reply to the same chalange,
with a purer than Roman pride?"I am
Columbian citizen."
Let the Columbian Confederacy oomprebend ai
our whole South: and as a united people we will ?'
U
I take our place among the nations of the earth.
Columbia will be a aynonyme for this "our own gj
proud land of the South"?the rich sunny land *
of our glorions clime?the clime of the gallant, ^
the true and the brave?the home of the fair, it
"Where the flowcra ever blossom, the beams ever shine, ri
And the virgins are soft as the roses they twine." gj
Last Saturday's Carolinian suggests "Southern
Confederacy" as a suitable name; it also b'
mentions "Columbian Confederacy," being ignor- ^
ant no doubt of the fact that the name had been
already proposed by us, and had reappeared 1<
in perhaps every paper in the State and among 11
them the Southern Guardian of this city. tj
A Williamston correspondent of the Carolinian, a
under date of December 6, proposes "Columbia
Republic." *
The Williamston correspondent also has the
air of one ignorant that his idea had been al- n
ready presented in a better form.
That is to say, the Williamston correspondent ^
of the Carolinian and the Carolinian itself ig- I
nore us.
We are, accordingly, very much ignored.

The Board of Health will call it Variola.?
Up to the present time, (Tuesday), we hare
heard of five veil authenticated eases of SmallPox.
Of these, two hare resulted fatally.? 1
There are some other cases not yet decided on. j
The Board of Health has faithfully reported j
every case that has been officially (by the attending
physician) returned to it as variola. b
We have inquired of members of the profes- g
sion, and feel safe in assuring our readers of the
following points:
1?Small-Pox is communicable only during its
eruptive stage, and then mainly when fully developed
2?To contract the disease at all, either direct
personal contact, or immediate inhalation of 0
breath or effluvium, by confinement in the same b
room, is necessary, Therefore? f<
3?To pass in the street by infected houses, *
or to live even next door, involves very little if t'
any danger. a
4?Small-Pox is as incontestably contagious *
?catching, in the popular meaning of the word t
?as any disease in the whole domain of Nosology. E
5?Vaccination is a reliable preventive. ?
6?A certain preventive is?to keep out of 0
the way. s
7?There is no certain way of knowing whether
a vaccinated person will take the disease or s
uUb, except tu ?ppiy it ogam. xnenv u do eneoi ?

seven years; others, twenty-one; others, a thoui c

Literary, *An
article in last week's Borne Journal, of *
New York, reviews the poems of John W. Over- I
all, of New Orleans, with high praise. The po- 6
ems are ready for the press, and will appear soon
we presume, The specimens given prove Over- '
all to be one of oar most gifted southern poets.
The Blue and Gold edition of Mn: Osgood's t
Poems, purporting and claiming to be "com c
plete," is a fraud. It is incomplete. It is in 8
fact a reprint of the edition of 1845?five years ?
before the author's death. ' *
Woman's Friendship.
Willis of the Home Journal, with, characteristic
facility of expression, says: "While a woman
of genius is unlikely to be loved, she is, of all
human beings, the most exquisite susceptivity
for a friendship."
Case of Conscience.
Sheridan Knowles is just very much exercised
on account of moral scruples upon the matter of ,
his earlier productions. He acquired distinction (
as actor, dramatist, novelist, and lecturer, and ?
made arrangements with his publishers to re- ?
ceive an annuity for life upon the copy-rights
of his works. Then, recently he turned preaoher:
and his conscience becoming sore on the matter
of accepting the annuity, it being the wages of :
sin, he is in a strait. What should he do ? It 8
is a nice point for the casuists.
A case in some respect similar occured in ^
America. Captain Ingraham, the author of
"Lafitte the Pirate" and many other second-rate c
novels, at length became a preaoher and labored (
manfully to suppress his youthful works.
Secession.
Before another issue 01 the Enquibe&, South
Carolina may have become a separate sovereign- *
tySo
be it. t
It becomes every good citizen now to be es 1
pecially circumspect in observing every iota of J
the law, so that no occasion of violence may j
arise. One drop of blood may involve a whole
continent in war. Let no rash act on our part
be afterwards referred to by oar enemies as the
cause. Let them have no handle to blame us.?
If a war with the General Government arise in
the North, and be precipitated upon us, let it ^
come; but let our hands be clean of even the im- *
putation of lawless violence. Let Carolina's
robes of State be pure from any stain of outlaw
blood. This is of all others not a time to "hang 1
a peddler." The man who raises an arm in riot C
should be shot down in his tracks as a traitor
to his country. When war comes?if come it
must?our people are ready for it?ready to -i
the death, man by man. t
Nextweek we are to hear the charge-command 1
from the lips of our State Convention :? <
"South Cabolina !?Forward?quick ttep? 1

And our separate nationality will be consume- 1
