His Sweetheart.
VERDICT CARRIES DEATH SENTENCE
Tragedy of Bia; Moose Lake la Which

First Dearree. i; '
HERKIMER, N. T, Dec. 5.-The
Jury in the trial of Chester E. Gillette
(or the murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Brown, at Big Moose lake last night
returned a verdict of guilty' In the first
',. degree. v-.
Sentence will be pronounced tomor
row morning, to which time court ad
journed after the jury had reported.
Former Senator Mills, Gillette's coun
sel, before adjournment announced
that when court reconvened he would
move to have the verdict set aside. ,
The jury, which had deliberated for
five hours, sent word at 11 o'clock
that a verdict had been reached. A
moment later they filed Into the court
room and at 11:15 o'clock an officer
who had been sent for Gillette return
ed with the prisoner.
Pale and a trifle nervous apparently,
Gillette faced the jury, and when Mar
shall Hatch, the foreman, declared
that a' verdict of guilty In the first de
gree bad been found the youthful pris
oner gave not a sign of emotion. A
few moments later, when bis counsel
had announced his purpose of making
a formal motion that the verdict be
et aside and the judge was dismissing
the jurors, Gillette bent over a nearby
table and, picking up a pencil, wrote,
"Father, I am condemned, Chester."
He then folded the dispatch carefully
and placed it In his pocket Imme
diately afterward he was taken from
the courtroom back to his cell in the
- jail.
It . was learned that the jury had
some difficulty In reaching an agree
ment, and six ballots were taken be
fore the twelve men agreed. , Vp to
that time the Jury had stood eleven for
conviction and one for acquittal.
The case was given to the Jury at
550 o'clock last night, after Judge Dev-
endorf had occupied an hour and fif
teen minutes in his charge. He dealt
with the points of law Involved and
instructed the Jurors to consider the
evidence from a legal standpoint and
not to be influenced by sentiment.
The session until the judge's charge
bad been taken up by District Attor
ney Ward, who described the friend
ship of Gillette and Grace Brown and
their companionship up to the time of
the girl's death In Big Moose lake. For
the first time during the trial the
youthful prisoner broke down as be
was mercilessly scored by the prose
cution. For some time be glared defiantly at
the district attorney, but when the
latter read abstracts from the letters
sent Gillette by his sweetheart the
prisoner burst Into tears and at times
throughout the remainder of the ses
sion sobbed convulsively.
When the jury went to Its room and
Gillette was led back to his cell be
asked the deputy. "Are the doors all
locked, sheriff?" He apparently feared
violence, but there was no evidence of
any such intention on the part of the
big crowd that swarmed the court
room. The chief features of Judge Deven
dor's charge were as follows:
'Gentlemen of the Jury The duty
each of you have assumed is an im
portant one, not a higher or more sa
cred duty thau that of a Juror Is
known to our civilization. A citizen
should not shrink from jury duty, but
should be ss faithful to respond to the
performance of that duty as be should
be to take bold of a rifle in defense of
bis country.
"To all concerned this is a case of
great importance. To the defendant
it Is of vast importance because his life
or liberty bangs on the Issue. To the j
people it Is u infinitely more tmpor-:
tance because the good order of the :
community snd the safety and life of
its citizens depend upon the faithful
administration of Justice.
"The defendant in all cases may tes
tify ss a witness in bis own behalf,
but the Jury may nse their discretion
In regard to bis testimony, as be Is an
Interested party. It Is the duty of the
Jury to consider the evidence of the
previous good character of the accused,
together with all the other evidence la
the rase, In determining his guilt or In
nocence. It should not disturb or both
er you at any time through life wheth
er, on the one band. It sends the de
fendant to answer the death penalty or
whether it gives him the lilwrty snd
freedom which be seeks.
"I caution yon to put aside any feel
ings of favor or sympathy and In the
closing hour of your labor to do your
sruty as yon see It The fact that the
Indictment was found against the de
fendant raises no presumption agsinst
fciiu in other words, the trial of this
rase starts along In this court with
the presumption of Innocence In favor
of the defendant.
"Now. none of tm was present on the
1 1th of July where it Is said this crime
occurred. The evidence that Grace
Brown lost ber life at Big Moose lake
admits of bo doubt, bnt there Is no tes
timony on the part of the people ss te

the fatal moment other than the de

Grace Brown, about bis being a man
of the type that reaches out for young
girls and ruins them, the district at
torney's quotation -from Shakespeare
about "the dagger" and the district at
torney's claim that Gillette's lawyers
concocted the story be told on the
stand.
When District Attorney Ward resunv
ed his summing up he pictured Gillette
as a base deceiver and heartless mur
derer, ridiculing the theories advanced
by Mr. Mills for the defense.
The prosecutor ridiculed the theories
advanced by Mr. Mills that If Gillette
had been planning to commit murder
he wouldn't have traveled on a rail
road train and he wouldn't have pur
chased a mileage book. "Of course, no
one who commits murder ever rides on
a railroad or ever buys a mileage
book," he sneered. Then he ridiculed
the idea that Gillette was a mere boy.
"Why, this poor, fragile boy, who
carried a canoe for three-quarters of
a mile on his shoulder; be, a poor, frag
ile boy, who couldn't pull a 100 pound
girl out of the water. A por, Inexpe
rienced boy he, who had traveled all
over the west and who had lived In
Chicago among its rottenness and wick
edness; he, who had traveled on the
tops of the freight cars he is the poor,
inexperienced boy.
"He got next to the minister, he gqt
next to the college professor so that he
could say, 'Gentlemen, I am your equal
aid your peer.' That was the robe by
which he fooled the public. It wasn't
the jury he was trying to fool; It was
the world. Did that minister friend of
his In all that time make one attempt
to rescue that girl from this villain's
grasp?
"Gentlemen, this man denied that he
kept company with this girl. When his
uncle asked him if he was going with
the girl he said he had called on ber
once by accident. If It had become
known how he was ruining that girl
under her sister's roof, his cousin and
ois workmates would have wrung his
worthless neck."
District Attorney Ward said that Mr.
Mills was wholly unjustified in excus
ing Gillette's immoral conduct, saying
every self respecting person would
have shunned him aud closed their
doors to him had they known.
"He wanted to stay In Cortland, in
society." said Mr. Ward. "He never
intended, never for a moment to take
Grace Brown anywhere except to her
death. He concocted a plan to rid him
self of ber, oue far less evil than bis
first to rob her of virtue. That girl
received her deathblow, I am sure,
with a grateful heart, out there in tbe
woods."
.Mr. Ward asked why Grace Brown
should net wish for death expecting
to become a mother with, no husband,
going about the factory alone, and be
saying, "Go home." He did not go to
ber as a lover and take ber to a minis
ter, but said. "I'll take a vacation later,
and then I'll take care of you." And
be did.
"Tbe band of God guides the tongue
of tbe murderer to his own undoing,
and Providence acted here. Gillette
asked Grace at the hotel when he saw
her talking to another girl, 'Did you
tell her I was here? . (
"Grace Brown tried to reach Gil
lette's stony heart a heart as cruel as
that of the wolf that met Little Red
Riding Hood. Heart? Sympathy? He
knows nothing of them."
Of the letter where Grace Brown
said, I said 'No' so many times, but
the world will never know it," Mr.
Ward said, "Tbe world does know It
little girl, even If you had to sacrifice
your life beneath the fangs of this
monster to let the world find it out
"There was never a lewd thought In
this girl's mind. She was as innocent
the day she died as when she was
born.
"Tbe counsel said she wss like the
paramour one who Walked tbe streets
that poor little wild flower, that In
nocent child! A paramour! What
fiend of hell put that word In his
mouth?"
In all that the district attorney said
he spoke no more eloquently than
wlien he paused for a moment then
with a choked voice pictured Grace
Brown's marvelous love and purity of
soul with these words:
"Ah. gentlemen, pray that you may
understand the beauty and purity of
that child's soul and life! I tell you
that she was worth more than the
whole of Cortland county, where they
spurned her. hhe wss worth more to
tbe world than all Its banks and their
gold, than its acres. Its industries. Its
wealth, its society. Its churches.
"She meant more than all of those
things to the world, and the world trill
lie better that she lived and died. Tbst
God who sometimes has tt do with tbe
affairs of men ordained that ber let
ters should be firen to us.'
The trouble taken by Gillette to eon
resl bis identity when he was away
with Grace Brown wss prominently
displayed by the district attorney.
"If she were a lewd girt would she
bsve liegged permission of bins to tell
ber uncle and aantl"
While District Attorney Wsrd wss
going on with his scathing denunrls
tlon of Gillette the youthful prisoner
broke Into tears.
"Did Gillette say to ber In Cortland
.he would not bare to go away sens
except as his wedded wife? Her let
ters say so," Mr. Wsrd said. "Toe
must come Saturday, dear. If yea do
not come I will do something des
perste. lie did sot went ber re de
anything desperate to tell her father."
Mr. Ward carried Gillette threw (A
his story about an accident to the bnat
on tbe lake and said the aeraeed was
carp fully coached on his tale.
The werfoos proposition in this east
was to make Grace Brown Jnsop over."
Mr. Wsrd said. "And anally he said
that he woa3d tea that he proposed e
ten ber rather.
That wa all right Told flee or eU

ted to Congress Japanese Question
la the Senate by Rayaer of
Maryland. :
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. -President
Roosevelt, submitting his annual mes
sage to congress, opens it by affirming
that as a nation we still contluue to
enjoy a literally unprecedented pros
perity, aud it is probable that only
reckless speculation aud disregard ol
legitimate business , methods on the
part of the business world can materi
ally mar this prosperity.
No congress iu our time, he says, hat
done more good work of Importance
than the present congress. . There wers
several matters left unfinished at the
last session which he most earnestly
hopes will be completed before ad
journment. The features of the message are a
follows:
A law prohibiting corporations from
contributing to campaign funds.
Revision of the statutes to give the
government the" right of appeal in both
civil and criminal actions against
trusts. "
Capital punishment for rape.
Rigid enforcement of the eight hour
law where practicable.
Shorter hours for railway employees,
Investigation of tbe conditions of the
labor of children and women. '
A more stringent employers' liability
act
Provision for federal Investigation of
controversies between capital and la
bor.
Withdrawal of public coal lands from
sale or entry.
' Amendment to meat inspection law
providing for placing dates on cans.
Some method whereby at an early
date tbe federal government may ex
ercise a more complete control over
corporations.
"A graduated inheritance tax and, if
possible, a graduated Income tax," to
be accomplished "when next our sys
tem of taxation Is revised."
National laws on divorce and polyg
amy. Subsidies for the development of
American shipping.
Revision of the currency laws.
Lower tariff or absolute free trade
for the Philippines.
Citizenship for the Porto Ricans. ,
- An act providing for the naturaliza
tion of Japanese. . ""
The amendment of the statutes so
that we can enforce the rights of
aliens under our treaties.
That the navy be maintained at Its
present strength by replacing obsolete
ships with new ones.
A new principle of selection In both
the army and navy "which will bring
into the higher ranks fewer men and
these at an earlier age."..
Of race suicide the'presldent says It
Is "a sin for which there Is no atone
ment" Here and there the reading of the
document was punctuated with ap
plause aud hearty handclapplng from
Democrats as well as Republicans fol
lowing its conclusion. During the ma
jor portion of the time of the reading
of tbe message Representative Lacey
of Iowa acted as speaker pro tern., be
ing the first of tbe defeated stand pat
ters to be recognized by Speaker Can
non. In the senate President Roosevelt's
message occupied attention to tbe ex
clusion of almost all other, business.
The exception was tbe Introduction of
a resolution on tbe Japanese situation
by Senator Rayner of Maryland.
Mr. Rayner's resolution says:
"That In the opinion of tbe senate
tbe government has no right to enter
Into any controversy with any foreign
government relating In any manner to
any of the public school systems of
any of the states of tbe Union; and,
further, .
"That it is the duty of tbe president
of the United States to notify the gov
ernment of Japan and to notify any
foreign government with which this
question may arise that tbs public
school institutions of the ststes are not
within the jurisdiction of the United
States and that tbe United Statea has
no power to regulate or supervise their j
administration."

CLOCK ALL Of GLASS.
Bohemian Workman Produces Work
ing Modsl Aftsr Six Ysars of Labor.
A somewhat futile feat of painstak
ing Ingenuity has been accomplished
after six years of continuous work in
the construction of a working clock,
every part of which except the springs
Is made ot glass. The constructor Is
a Bohemian glass polisher named
Joseph Bayer, who lives in Thereslen
jthal and who is now 1l years old.
The plates and pillars which form
the framework are ot glass Snd are
bolted together with glass screws. The
dial plate, hands, shafts and cog
wheels are of glass, and glass wedges
and pins are used for fastening the va
rious parts of the running gear to
gether. ; '.-: -. .
, All these parts are ground to the
average proportions of the metal parts
ot other clocks of the same else. The
teeth of the cogwheels are cut with
minute exactness. Only, the balance
wheel is heavier and thicker than it
would be In an ordinary clock, but it
is fashioned so as tp properly con
trol the movement of the machine. -
Like the clock itself, the key with
which it Is wound i is of glass. The
completion of the work was a mat
ter of Infinite pains. Some of the
parts had to be made over and over
again as often as 40 times before a
clock that would go and keep time
was produced. The builder sets a
price on the finished model of 2.500
marks, or about $625. Labor is cheap

' Real and Bogus Relics.
A tooth alleged to have been drawn
from Napeoleon's head at St. Helena
was sold for $37.60. For Kant's wig
only $10 could ' be obtained, but
Sterne's wig was valued at $1,000.
Two hundred dollars Is said to have
been given . for Descartes' skull,
whereas $3,400 was given for one of
Sir Isaac Newton's teeth, and $20,000
was offered for one of the teeth of
Heloise at the time when her body
was exhumed. . The waistcoat worn
by Rousseau has been priced at $190,
his watch at $100. Not all the relics,
however, ln which there has ' been
traffic have been genuine. Voltaire
cannot have owned more than a .frac
tion of the walking sticks that have
been sold as his and a tradesman in
France used to boast that lie had dis
posed o( 132 "last walking sticks" car
ried by Jean Jacques Rousseau. A
Paris tradesman for a long time did
an equally lucrative business ln "the
last pair ot trousers worn by Victor
Hugo." , ,

STORIES OP SCOTCH JUDOM,
Indulged In Levity When Human LIM
' Was at Stake. . .
ewe, saw , f .
Lord Salvesea In an address tt
Edinburgh recalled the old days when
human life was held very cheap aad
Judges frequently Indulged In levity
when life was at stake.
pn one occasion Sir Francis Bacon
was "mightily Importuned" by a male,
facto? to save his life. All appeals
failed and the culprit at length
pleaded for mercy on account of his
kindred. "Tour name," said he, "Is
Bacon and my name Is Hog, and la,
all ages Hog and Bacon are so nearly
kindred that they are not to be sepaV
rated." "Aye, but," replied the JudgS.
"you and I cannot be kindred except
you be hanged, for Hog is not Bacon
until it be well hanged.",
Similar callousness was evinced by
Scottish Judges even as late as the
18th century. Lord Braxfleld seemed
to have taken a positive pleasure In
obtaining convictions in cases and, it
was he who told an unfortunate cul
prit that he was a very clever fellow
but that he would be "nane the waur
6 a hanging." l
On another occasion, when this
Judge noticed a Juryman who was a
personal friend entering the court he
exclaimed: ("Come awa' Mister, coma
awaV and help me to hang a few o
they damned scoondrels."
- In 1870 Lord Kalmes presided at
the trial of a man named Matthew
Hay. with whom he had been in the
habit of playing at chess. He summed
up against the prisoner and when he
was i convicted exclaimed, "That's
checkmate to you, Matthew."
Battles In the Blood.
An interesting record of what mtf
be called the battles that occur ia
the blood of a fever patient between
noxious and benign microorganisms
was presented at a recent meeting of
the Royal Microscopical society.
. The patient in this case was suf
fering from malarial fever. The ob
servations were made at intervals of
a few minutes during a period of five
hours. The defenders of the patient's
life were a kind of leucocytes, which
destroyed the malarial parasites.
A leucocyte would engulf a para
site, which would then be seen under
going a process of disintegration in
side the leucocyte, and only the pig
ment granules were left. Afterward
other leucocytes would approach and
absorb even . these granules. Ex
