New York, Doc. 2.— At Uio aftcruoou session
of tho Reformed Episcopal Council to-day, on
motion of tho Rov. M. B. Smith, tho Rov,
Charics E. Ohenoy, D. D., of Chicago, was elect
ed Missionary Bishop of tho Northwest. Mr.
Ohouoy thou zuado a fow remarks with all
oaruostnoss in his tone and manner, and
with trembling voice ho said God only
know how pained ho was at tho
result of tho voto. Ho was unfitted in every way
for*tho ofilco. Evor since tho movement was
begun ho had folt sure that tho coutro would bo
in Chicago, and that the Church should bo built
up there, and that success in that direction was
of more consoquonco than a Bishop. In consid
eration of his present position, he thoughthowas
qualified for local work, but it would be
impossible for him to do both. Ho had como at
tho request of tho Vestry, without thought of
the possibility of such a result, and for him to
go back and say that ho should leave
them, was something ho could not possi
bly do. Ho was compelled to say ho could not
accept tho position tendered him.
TUoiiup Cummins, tho Rev. Mr. Smith, and the
Rev. Mr. Leacock strenuously urged him to ac
cept it. Dr. Chouoy replied that ho could not
think of taking tho stop until ho had consulted
with his congregation.
It was resolved by tho meeting that, in case ho
should subsequently accept tho position, ho
should be duly ordained. Tho mooting then ad
journed sine die.

Church do now return tho same to this meeting, and
oiler tho following resolutions:
ftesolveil, That wo whoso names are appended to tho

mighty God, organize ourselves into a Church to lie

copal Church,” In conformity with tho following dec
laration of principles, and with tho Dt.-Dov. George
David Cummins, D. D„ ns our presiding Bishop :
DECLARATION OF VIUNCII'LUa.
Firsts The Deformed Episcopal Church, holding
tho faith once delivered unto the saints, declares its
belief in tho lioly Scriptures of (ho Old and Now
Testaments as tho word of God and solo rule of faith
and practice; in tho creed commonly called tho
“ Apostles' Creed in the Divine Institution of the
sacraments of Baptism aud the Lord's Supper; and in
the doctrines of grace substantially as they aro set
forth iu the Thirty-nine Articles of Duligion.
Second— This Church recognizes uud adheres to
Episcopacy, not us of Divine right, but as ' © very
ancient ami desirable form of church policy.
Third— I Tho Church, retaining a liturgy which will
not bo Imperative or repressive of freedom lu’praycr,
accepts tiie book of Common Prayer as it was revised,
prepared, &ml recommended for uko by tho General
Convention of tho Protestant Episcopal Church, A. D.
1783, reserving full liberty to alter, enlarge, abridge,
and amend tho same, as may seem musk conducive to
the education of the people, provided that tho sub
stance of tho faith bo kept entire.
Fourth— This Caurch condemns and rejects the fol
lowing erroneous uud strange doctrines as contrary to
God’s Word:
(d.) That tho Ohnrch of Christ exists only in ac
cordance with one order or form of ecclesiastical poh-
cy.
(6.) That Christian ministers oro priests In Another
souse than that m which all believers aro a social
priesthood.
(c.) That the Lord’s table in nn altar on which an
obiatlou of the body and blood of Christ Is ottered
anew to (ho Father.
(d.) That the presence of Christ In thoLord’s Supper

From the lowa Church ifinsionary for Deumber, 1878.
My Deai; Brother : I have, with many oth
ers, boon deeply pained at your course in a pro
posed separation of yoursolf from tho Protest
ant Episcopal Church. I say “ proposed sepa
ration,'* for tho act is not yet canonically con
summated, and thoro is even room for hope that
you may bo led to
TO RECONSIDER YOUR ACTION,
and romain in tho communion in connection with
which youhavo spent bo many of your best years,
and in an ofilco to which you wore solemnly con
secrated in tho samo connection, and which, it
seems to mo, you cannot relinquish without in
volving yourself in much unhappiness as
tho great mistake of your life. 1 was
ono of your cousocrators, aud had tho honor of
preaching tho sermon on tho interesting and
solemn occasion. I have long known and loved
you; and it is ono proof of my affootlon that I
address to you thoso words of fraternal remon
strance and expostulation.
You are well awaro that
MY GENEROUS SYMPATHIES
have boon with you in tho differences and con
troversies that have characterized our Ohuroh
and the Church of England for some years past;
although I may not havo taken os extreme ground
in thcso'aa you have felt it your duty to occupy.
I havo participated very strongly In tho opposi
tion to tho Ritualistic system, fooling that it
involved serious doctrinal errors, and that
it was calculated to do us immense
harm as a Church, both iu alienating
many of our own people, end in doing us dis
credit in tho estimation of Protestant Christen
dom. I havo never been more opposed to that
system than lam now; and I cannot conceive it
possible that I shall over regard it with any
favor or sympathy. I believe in my heart that
what I understand by Ritualism is not only for
eign to tho real genius and touching of tho
Protestant Episcopal Church, but that it is actu
ally and radically subversive of its primitive and
scriptural character. But, my dear Brother, the
Church, as such, is
NOT AT ALL COMMITTED
to this system. She remains as she has boon
for years and generations. No ono Rit
ualistic doctrine ban received her legisla
tive sanction; and she simply shows
her moderation and comprehensiveness
by bearing with her mistaken children until they
shall bo brought to a bettor mind. It is my own
hope and belief that, in tho lonj run , she will
come out all right, though her present chasten
ing is not joyous, but grievous. And I believe,
further, that it is tho duty of her friends to stand
by her in this time of tiial, and do battle with
her, if uoed bo, within her pale, and not desert
her when she most needs their help. I believe
her to bo a true branch of the Universal Church
of Christ, and, lake her all in nil, I believe her
to ho tho purest branch of that Church iu all
the world, iu her doctrine, polity, dis
cipline, and worship. 1 do not believe
that it is necessary to desert her unless
she herself deserts tho truo faith of
tho Gospel, and proves false to hor avowed char
acter and principles. Permit mo to say, in all
affection and frankness, that 1 cannot say that
your published motives for leaving hor pale aro
AT ALL SUFFICIENT
to warrant and justify a decision involving such
serious consequences. Your letter to tho vener
able providing Bishop surprises mo in its lack of
adequate reasons for your course. Tho objec
tionable practicoo ip Kentucky, to which you re
fer. can hardly bo regarded as insuperable. It
would seem that two Bishops, and tho good
sense of tho clergy and luilv in general, might
iu time havo mitigated and removed this un
pleasant objection. In my own Diocese, I havo
scarcely any trouble of tins kind,—l may say
none at all that is occasioned by any actual
Ritualism. Now and thou I may havo been
somewhat annoyed by a slight development of
the epidemic, but it has soon passed away, and
for the most part no novelties disturb our peace.
My face is sot as a Hint against these foreign mid
disturbing elements. 1 consider them as indi
cating a morbid state of mind, as I do also thoso
radical views in another direction, which seem to
mo to havo a disorganizing tendency aud effect,
and to make man unnecessarily uneasy and dis
contented in n Church which has nurtured so
many saints of God, and which has Apostles and
Prophets as a foundation, Jesus Ghruib Himself
being tho Ohlcf Corner-Stone.
You say, my dear brother, that you have lost
all hopo that the Ritualistic system either can or
will be eradicated by any action of tho author! •
ities of tho Church, legislative or executive.
I.CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU
that the case Is hopeless. I admit that the state
of things in tho Church of England and in her
daughter Church hero is depressing ami dis
couraging ; but lot us not look on the dark side
alone, when thoro is a bright side also. When
in Emrlaml, at tho Lambeth Conference, in
1807, I saw much to regret and condemn in tho
Mother Church, and I endeavored to boar my
feeble testimony against tho views and practices
that 1 folt, amt still feel, to bo inimical to her
best interests, and full of danger to hor
truo life as an integral part of tho Church
of Christ. This testimony was homo
iu a published iottor to tho then Bishop
of London, now tho Archbishop of Canterbury:
and I have tho satisfaction of knowing that 1
had tins sympathy of Dr. Tail in my views, ami
that ho is now, as then, strongly opposed to the
Ritualistic system. A majority of tho Bishops
in England are olao opposed to tho mischievous
system, aud so aro tho great body of tho clergy
and laity of that Church. Tho samo is truo
hero. Tho real Ritualists aro
A SMALL MINORITY
of our Bishops, clergy, ami laity. They are In
deed un active and earnest minority; hut there
is uo probability that they will bo able to gain
tho ascendency in tho Church. Give them rope
enough, mid, according to present signs, they
will effectually hang thomHolvos in duo lime.
Wc may feci soino of tho effects of thou* move
mentbut I foci quits certain that tho Church
at largo will not adopt or amici lon their views
or pracliccH, so far as they uto “ erroneous aud
strange,” and “ contrary to God’s Word.” The
Church herself not having given countenance to
this system, and it nut being generally provident,
I repeat that I cannot tuku your vlow that the
case is so hopeless as to justify a imputation
from her raored fold.
1 do not doom it necessary to dwali at length
I’HE CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1873.
nnon the third reason yon assign for your course.
With some atrlcturea that have boon made upon
YOUR AOT IN TUB REV. DU. HALL’S OnUIIOII
Ido not sympathize; though I myself, as a
Bishop, should nob have thought it necessary to
do what you did. To nave oven a more his
torical ecclesiastical principle, I should
havo thought that you would have
boon invited to preside on the occasion, or at
least to consecrate tho elements according to
our own form ; especially an tho Presbyterians
do not hold tho principle in question, and re
gard our own ecclesiastical status as at least equal
to their own. Such a course, however, may have
boon regarded as impracticable. In any case, 1
doubt not that you acted in all sincerity, and
with tho best mol Ives, Ido not for a moment
suppose that you intended any departure from
tho order of tho Church, or any violation of its
laws or of your own vown, hut regarded your
self as acting simply in your individual capacity,
and in tho .exorcise or a broad Christian free
dom.
I do not fool disposed to sit as Judgo upon
your conduct in thin matter of jolnt-oommuuion;
but I raiißt way that, in my opinion, tho criti
cisms pawed upon *ou for this act
DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VALID REASON
for such a stop an a desertion of a Scriptural and
Historical Church, and tho inauguration of a
movement which nuy result in tho formation of
a now religious body, at the hazard of an In
cronao of tho existing ovilo of separation and
division among tho members of tho professed
household of God. If you felt that you had
dono right, why not bravely nbido all tho con
sequences, and not bo driven away from tho
Church by what you considered intolerant and
views of Christian liberty and
Christian duty ? Dudor ail tho circum
stances, many •of your host friends
f elt that your act, especially as a Bishop
of tho Church, was at least inexpedient, and so
regretted it; but they did not generally antici
pate that you could bo brought to your present
decision by any animadversions upon a course
which you believed to bo right, and not incom
patible with your position or duty as a Bishop of
“this Church.”
I had reached this precise point in mv already
too long letter, when I saw in tho public panors
a notice of tho proposed mooting iu Now I’ork
next week, for the purpose of organizing a now
Lplscopnl Church. I
DEEPLY 11EOHET THIS MOVEMENT,
though I am free to say that the responsibility of
it is a divided one. It has, mmy opinion, been
precipitated by extreme views and practices in an
opposite direction, as well as by an unwise and
unfortunate exorcise of ooolerioatioal discipline.
iuoßo have boon the occasion of most serious,
though of course unintentional, injury to tho
Church. Whatever blame there may have boon
m this onootion, I yet cannot feel that you and
your wsodntoa are thereby justified In your
present position. I know full well how hard It
is Ko bear what you and many others have homo,
in connection with tho present condition of our
Church j hut it does not appear to mo (hat the
point has yet boon reached, oven if itevcrcau
be, when an actual division and separation are
justified and demanded by tho leadings of God’s
Providence. I could earnestly desire and pray
that & now and diulinot organization
MIGHT NOT RE EFFECTED
at tho proposed mooting. A oocosalonal or
Bohismatical movement at this time would, in my
opinion, bo a greater evil than those wo aro now
boating, and from which we may hopo to bo
relieved in duo time. It were far bettor for our
extreme Ritualistic brethren to finally secede to
tho Church of Romo, to which they are tending,
than for yourself and others of like mind to
leave such a Church as omu fora now ecclesias
tical organization. I pray yon to pause and con
sider before committing yourself fully to such a
step, and may God the Holy Ghost guide and
direct you In all things I
I began my letter with simple reference to
yourself, and for your personal perusal; but you
may make imoh use of it as you see fit, aud I
reserve tho same privilege for niyaolf.
I remain, my dear Brother, faithfully end
affectionately yours, Henry W. Lee,

WABUiNdtolc, D. D., Deo- 2-—The President's
message has not pmvoked much discussion hero.
Tho subject Is generally dismissed with a smile,
and Is believed to cover about all tho weak en
terprises that could be put In the apace It occu
pies. Tho project of building residences for
Cabinet Minister* md Senators Is sot down as
ridiculous, and was received with a broad grin
by members of the House, which gave place
to a ludicrous indignant expression at bolng
, loft out in tho cold. The recommendations for
h National University, an Irrigating canal be
tween the Misaonri River and the Rocky Mono
tains, favoring Oroswell’a Postal Savings Banks,
and tho claims of the Board of Public Works on
the Government lundi, ore laughed at good
naturedly by all save tho close friends of tho
Administration, who appear to bo anything but
pleased with them. The manner in which tho
President jumbles his suggestions to authorize
the Executive to approve so much of a bill oisliis
judgment may dictate, without approving tho
whole, with hii other suggestion that (here
should be no legislation by Congress in the last
twenty-four hours of & session, so that
the Executive may bo enabled to examine
bills and sign them uuderstandingly, is
Interpreted as an effort on his part to convey the
impression that if ho had time to mako mu4* on
examination he would not havo approver! tho
Baek-Pay and Incroaec-of-Salarlos bill. As. .It Is
well known that President Giant was an inter
ested lobbyist to secure the passage of! Ibo
measure, nobody hero has been seduced iffi o ibo
belief that bo would have disapproved tho bill If
bo bad boon allowed a week to consider :dt in.
Very few opinions differ from tho godoiiall ver
dict, that tho message is one of the weakest
papers that has come from the White Itlouae,
and, from its general make-up, no one 'doubts
that it was prepared by tho President, vilih but
little assistance from his Private SeoroUity and
officious statesmen.
THE LOUISIANA lOSSinERS,
Tho contest in tho House to-day over Jtho ad
mission of Sypher, Sheldon, and Pimobhauk,
from Louisiana, was narrowed down to a strict
party fight, tho Democrats going in a r.uaes for
tho Warmouth appointments, while tho 'Republi
cans, with the single exception of HJiowart L.
Woodford, of Now York, and the mtiuibors of
tho old Committee on Election n, sided
with tho Pinohbaok appointees. TJ.to Demo

of alleged frauds perpetrated at tho

on tho question whether tho certifies tea issued
by Warmouth woro regular and in ];ogal form.
The question of frauds at tho ballot-box belongs
In the first instance to the CommitU/s on Elec

Tim CASE or SENATOR OAIIPr.NTEB
Is again oomiug ir to general discussion. An
editorial in tho Now York TUtuis of to-day,
giving letters fr im Senator Spencer, Dr.
Bliss, of tho Boa* xi of Health of this city,
President Grant oj id Farrar, tbo clerk at tho
West End Hotel, |Long Branch, ami contain
ing strong charges Against tho editor and corros-
Eondouc of tho Novf York Tribune, is endorsed
y Carpenter, and is supposed to bo a notifica
tion from him that lie ia disposed to push tho
matter. Tho President’s letter merely certifies
that Camontor was in his company ou tho even
ing referred to. and that ho was not intoxicated.
Bliss says that ho has boon the professional
advisor of tho lady .in tho case; that her
character ia irreproachable, and that tho Tribune
correspondent virtually acknowledged to him that
tho story was lalec, and that his only object in
placing it in circulation was to retaliate upon
Carpenter lor having-had him incarcerated dur
ing the Treaty of Washington diillculty. Tho hotel
clerk certifies that ho refused Carpenter rooms
solely because thoro vero none vacant in the
house, and Senator Spencer says that tho corre
spondent admitted to him ut Long Branch that
thoro was no truth in tho inference to bo drawn
from tho telegram which ho sent to the Tribune.
On tho other hand, tho Tribune seems per
fectly content that it has its case
well in hand, and is only anxious
to prove tho truth of what it has charged, prom
ising to do not only that, but to go further, and
show that Carpenter's whole hfohnu boon dis
figured by similar practices. Carpenter has
taken his place as President pro tcm. of the Sen
ate without question since his return.

the fad that ho has built a mngnilicout house

that ho still cleaves to tho hope that some of tho |
passengers remained on hoard tho Loch Earn,
and will soon bo heard from afl safe. 110 has
forwarded by mall dll papers concerning tho last
and present voyage of tho vessel, in view of tho
Investigation which ho boliovoa tho French Gov
ernment will institute an soon as tho officers
roach Paris. Ho has no doubt but that
OAPT. BUHMONT
will bo acquitted, and ho thinks it probable that
ho will bo commcndod for his coolness and gal
lantry. . 110 was a thoroughly vigilant and bravo
officer. His private cabin faced upon tho bridge,
which was hia post of duty, and it was a Hied
custom with him during tho voyage to sloop
only during Iho day.
A IUOID INVESTIGATION EXPECTED.
’ I Tho X ? ronch Government Is usually very rigid
In those examinations, and is equally ready to
impose blamo or pi also.
STATEMENT OF AN INSURANCE MAN.
An officer of oao of tho largest marine insur
ance companion said to-day that, if the weather
was clear, (to could not account for tho collision.
Usually sailing vessels have tho right of way.
but they aro ipxpootod to exorcise all
necessary precautions. Reports soy that
tho Loch Earn struck tho steamer square
amidships. If a proper watch was kept ho could
not understand why the vessel could not have
luffed up, and passed astern of tho steamer, ilo
was apprehensive of the safety of tho Loch
Earn. She was on iron teasel, and, according
to all reports, must have been considerably in
jured. The collision will bo thoroughly investi
gated by tho French Government. Tho fol
lowing
Tireon? or Tire collision
ttm clvoxi by Capt. Johnson, ono of tho Harbor-
Masters of this port. Ho believes that,on sight
ing each otticr, tho Havre ported her holm hord
to got out of tho way. and collision would have
been avoided it tho Loch Earn had ported her
holm. As sho did not. she struck tho Havre
evidently on tho port side. Conflicting state
ments aa to provaionco or nhaonco of fog make
it difficult to arrive at a dolluito conclusion.
TUB SURVIVORS IS LONDON. ,
{Herald Cubit.]
London. Deo. 2. —Elovouof tho survivors from
the Villo Du Ilavro departed for Paria to-night.
The railway company niudly provided a saloon
car for them. During their abort stay in Lon
don everybody vied with each other in comfort
ing tho survivors.
HAHKS OF AFFECTION
wore evinced. Tito storekeeper refused to ac
cept payment. These offers were resisted with
difficulty. The steamer's agents provided
funds, while Morgan, Browns, and others
offered a homo. All this was unnecessary,
as several of tho surviving gentlemen saved a
sufttuioney of funds. Mr. Bishop had £BOO in
English gold and notes. It is a remarkable fact
that several others, seemingly, had ample time
to dress completely.
TI3IK OP THE DISASTER.
' Bishop’s watch slopped at twonty-olght min
utes after 2 j Cramer’s watch stopped exactly at
half-past 2. This loads to tho supposition that
much valuable tirao was lost in lowering the
boats. Owing to the utter absence of discipline
after tho collision, no enters wore given.
TOE omCET.S WERE DISTRACTED,
and oooh helped himself. The fact is undia
puted that tho long boat contained no passen
gers. The sailors and coal-boys rushed and took
possession, all tho rescues being affected
subsequently, Tho Scotch shin was pre
vented from; preparing immediately for the
rescue from its ignorance as to whether sorious
damage was done tho steamer, which arose
probably from inability to communicate in
French. Consequently, the Xoch iSnru’n boats
wore not lowered until tho steamer had gone
down.
NO LTFE-riir.HERVEn
wu in its proper place. One gentleman, search
ing vainly through lour cabins, ancortnh-od that
tho occupants of throe nr four cabins in tho mid
ships wore probably lolled whou the Scotchman
struck the Yillo du Havre,

Tho moot of those rescued had been floating

LITTLE COMFORT
to extend to the rescued beyond open hearts and
goodwill. Tho ladies changed their drenched
night dresses for Bailors’ clothing. It noon,
however, became a question whether tho Loch
Emo offered safety to those on board:
URDEIITION.
Capt. Sumiont declared his dotorminution to
transfer tho crow to some other ship when
poiisiblo, leaving tho passengers behind. This
was resisted by tho mute and Belknap, and,
after consultation with the Carpenter, they
overcame, with some difficulty, Surmout’a op
position.
WHEN Tim TUI WAS HIG1ITE1),
«. transfer was effected, uud tho American Cap
thin offered.the ladies increased comfort in
tho neat cabin occupied by Ids wife.
Still, when a lauding was effected at
Cardiff,'at twilight on Monday, tho ladies wore

kets to protect,—no bonnets, and foot covered
with sailors' stockings.
TUB ARRIVAL AT THE HOTEL
when tho agents immediately provided clothing
to all the Indies assembled in tho parlor, having
shore notice to dross prior to their departure for
London. Whou ilia signal wv» given, tho gen
tleman asked whether they wore ready, and
the door wan opened, when all realized
tho fearful tragedy. All ladies being
UI.AD IN MOURNING.
Tho heroism ,of the ladies was beyond nil
praise, Unit of Misu Hunter being
especially conspicuous. All gratefully
acknowledge ln6 motherly euro with which
they were treated. At tho time of collision the

that ■' <> latter gave.a confuted direction to tho

to tho Engineer, who stopped tho ongiuoa
in time, thus preventing further loss of life.
