RESUMPTION OP TUB IXQUIRY IXTO
NEW YORK POLICE AFFAIRS.
Father Uucey In Court Against Arch
bishop Corrlgun's Order Colonel
Fellows ou Trtul.
NEW YORK. Dec. 3. After a month's
recess the Senate investigating committee
to-day resumed its probing Into the cor
ruption of the police department in this
city. Since Senator .Saxton's resignation
from "the committee almost immediately
after his selection as Lieutenant Governor,
It leaves the committee with only six mem
bers. Father Ducey appeared in the court
room at 1:43 o'clock. The fact that his rev
erence Ignored Archbishop Corrigan's order
not to present himself at the sessions of
the Lexoiv committee was a topic of inter
est. In response to a reporter's question,
Father Ducey said: "For information of
any kind I shall have to refer you to Mad
ison avenue," where Archbishop Corrigan
lives. The chamber was well filled by 11
o'clock, shortly after which hour Recorder
elect Gofif arrived. When the committee
was called to order there were present Sen
ators Lexow. 'Bradley, Robertson and
O'Connor. Among those who were present
in the chamber was John Burns, the Eng
lish labor leader, who was accompanied
by Samuel Gompers.
Evelyn Bell's name was called, and as
sho did not respond, Mr. Goff asked that
she be declared in contempt. A request by
Commissionerof Street-cleaning Andrews
that he be furnished with a copy of the
committee record was refused. August L.
Lewis admitted, under, examination, that he
had committed perjury In swearing that he
was the owner of a saloon, of which Mad
ame Schaude was the real owner. The lat
ter was under the ban of the excise board
and could not procure a license 'in her own
name. This witness did not recollect hav
ing heard Mme. Sehaude say that she was
obliged to pay the police "big money" for
protection.
Dr. Charles IL Parkhurst entered and
was In earnest conversation with Counsel
Goff a few minutes before the committee
was called to order in the afternoon. When
Witness Ryan was called he refused still
to Rive any testimony about the "green
Roods" business and on leaving the court
room was arrested for refusing to obey a
subpoena to testify. He was held in $500
ball, ex-Assemblyman Michael Callahan be
ing his bondsman.
Charles Harris, alias Michael Newton,
waa then called. He was recently released
from the Erie county penitentiary. He testi
fied that the Hon. "Paddy" Divyer had sent
him to the Island on one occajion for two
months for being drunk anT disorderly.
The witness also said that in 1532, Just be
fore the presidential election, he was paid
50 cents by "Jimmy" Dlvver to register
as Patrick Ryan, from the International
Hotel. The next day he was told Assembly
man Mitchell Callahan wanted some voters.
In this Instance he registered under an
alias from the Grand Central lodging house.
Assemblyman Callahan paid htm $1 for
this. Harris explained that after all he
did not vote, He was arrested and sent
to Erie county prison before the election.
-Trial
of Colonel Fellows. .
NEW YORK, Dec. 3. The trial of Col.
John R. Fellows, district attorney of the
city and county of New York, upon charges
of neglect of duty, was begun before Gov.
Flower's commissioner, ex-Senator John J.
Lenson, of Kingston, to-day. One set of
charges made by Good Government Club
men embraces over three hundred specified
cases, while another set. presented by the
German-American Reform Union, made ex
actly 501. The first series of charges were
read by Mr. MacMahon, who then swore to
their accuracy. Cross-examination brought
out that the witness was shearing to in
formation. It was conceded by counsel that
the accused was under no compulsion to
take the witness stand to swear that his
defense waa true. The attorney for the
German-American Reform Union argued
that the charges preferred by that body
should, where the specific charges are not
the same, be tried separately, and as dis
tinct cases.
Commissioner Llnson decided, despite ob
jections from both the Germans and the
Five, that the charges of tho former should
be heard next. After recess the charges
regarding forfeited recognlzmces were
taken up. Mr. Phillips, for the German
American Union, produced evidence to show
negligence by Colonel Fellows in collect
ing forfeited recognizances in a large num
ber of cases. After a number of such cases
had been called up Mr. Fellows objected,
saying that it was the duty of the district
attorney simply to issue execution and then
leave the matter to the sheriff. Commis
sioner Linson said: "If you can show that
it is the duty of the district attorney to ko
further than to issue execution, then I will
not shut you off." Mr. Phillips argued that
it was the district attorney's duty to prose
cute cases where frau ent bonds were
given or where transf. haj been made
to defraud people. Th had sixty cases,
he said, where 7,fi00 wotto o' loill had been
forfeited, and only a few thousand col
lectel and ten profesf lonj . bondsmen al
lowed to go unproseculed. Colonel Fellows
ref-tsed to produce the bo.ks of his office,
stating tha: they would s.iow the name
of iersons indicted and uot yet arrested.

EDWAKD SWIFTS COMET.
roaslhllity that it In the Long Lost
"Wanderer Discovered 1y Ecvlco.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Dec. 3. Recent ob
servations at the. Mount Lowe observatory
indicate that the Edward Swift comet, dis
covered by the ron of professor Swift, at
that observatory on Tuesday evening, Nov.
20, may turn out to be the famous lost
comet discovered by Devico, at Rome, Aug.
22, 1S4I, just half a century ago. The orbit
of Devlco's comet. was computed by Bruno,
and found to be within that of Jupiter, its
aphelion closely approaching the orbit of
the giant planet, and Its perihelion lying
just within the orbit of the earth. Its
period was a trifle less than five years and
a half (5.42) years), and it should have re
appeared nine times since its discovery, but
it did not return as predicted, or if it has
returned It was never seen: The re
searches of M. Leverrier indicated that It
was Identical with the comet observed by
Iahiere, at Tarls, in 1878, though it was not
uetected at any one of the many returns to
its perihelion, which must have taken place
In the interim. There was one rather pe
culiar feature about Devlco's comet: its
orbit was direct and it was inclined only 2
decrees. Fl-l mtnntau nn.l r.c ,

TWO 3IEASIRES IlEFOItG TUB ALA-
11A3IA LEGISLATtHE.
Iloth Intended to Punish the Populist
"Governor" nnd Hla.8uiporters
3tesave Promised.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec.' s.-A bill was
introduced in the House to-day by Renre-
sentatlve Knight, of Hale, which is in
tended to put a stop to Kolb's nerform.
ances and prevent all possible danger of
advantage. Briefly the bill makes it a
crime punishable by fine and imnrlson mpnt
for uny person to take the oath of , ofliv
r.rd atfempv to discharge the duties of such
omoo without .first having been declared
elected thereto by the person or' body hav.
lag authority to so declare the result. It
makes the pealty for violating anv of it
precisions a fine of not less than $00 and
n.u rrore than 510,000, and the offender
shall be Imprisoned in the penitentiary of
this state for not more than twenty-f.ve
years. There is little doubt that the bill
will become a law. Its Introduction in the
House at this time, when there is s: much
not bloor on both sides, created x sc-nsa-'.ion
and great indignation among the Popu
list mem he; s
Mr. John, of Jefferson, also introduced
a resoluuon requiring the committee on
privileges and elections to ascertain what.
If any, members of the Legislature had
participated In the inauguration of Cap
tain Kolb, the purpose of the investigation
being to expel such member or members
from the House. The Populist members
offered no protest wh?n the bills were pre
sented and read. Only a few of them at
tended Kolb's Inauguration. Rev. Mr.
Hearne, one of the Populist members,
opened Kolb's inaugural ceremonies with
prayer and prayed among other things for
deliverance from the usurpers. His seat,
for one, will be vacated.
State Senator Goodwin, a leading Popu
lift, said to-night that he hoped the Knight
bill would pass. Its enactment and enforce
ment, he says, will only precipitate the
Issue. He says the Populists want
an investigation of the election frauds
and that Kolb will proceed to violate the
law as soon as practicable after Its enact
ment in order that he may be arrested and
tried and the facts be brought out, and It
is reported here to-night, in fact, a promi
nent Populist is quoted as authority for the
statement, that Kolb would Issue a procla
mation to the white voters of the State in
structing them not to pay their taxes to
Gdvernor Oates, but to pay them to his
appointees or those elected on his ticket.
The effect of this ploclamation, together
with an already low State treasury, the
Populists affect to believe, will bring the
Legislature to their terms and cause them
to pass a contest law that will suit the
third party voters. Mr. Knight's bill, how
ever, makes any one who recognizes the
authority of a usurper as guilty as the
frlncipal. and it Is not believed Kolb's fol
owers will heed his instructions.
A dispatch from Rirmlngham says: R.
F. Kolb returned from Montgomery to
day, and says he is now engageU in writ
ing a lengthy message, which he will, as
Governor, send to the Legislature to-morrow.
Just what It will contain he would
not say, further than he will Insist on the
enactment of an election contest law. It is
not believed the Democratic presiding of
ficers of either branch of the Legislature
will allow the document to be read.
The 'People's Tribune, Kolb's paper, pub
lished a card from Kolb to-day in which he
denies that he asked Governor Jones's per
mission last Saturday in Montgomery to
deliver his Inaugural addreas in tne capitol
grounds, saying he simply asked Governor
Jor.es if he had ordered his arrest if he
attempted to Fpeak there, and he was In
formed that Governor Jones had. "I de
sired to avoid a conflict, which I knew my
arrest would cause, and at once returned
to the ktreet." said Kolb.
COLLIDED IX A FOG.

LONDON, Dec. 2. The steamer Al-
bertine, from Shields to this xort, arrived
at Yarmouth to-day with her bows com
pletely stove in and leaking badly. Her
commander reported that she was in colli
sion yesterday with a large passenger
steamer. The Albertlne struck the steamer
amidships, and the latter disappeared in
the fog which enveloped that part of the
coast all day yesterday. The Albertlne,
in mite of her damaged condition, re
mained about the spot where the collision
. occurred and searched for the vessel with
which she had collided, but no trace of
the steamer could be found, and it is sup
posed that she has foundered. A life buoy
and four steamer's hatches marked "Ken-
more" were washed ashore near Yarmouth
to-day. The steamship Kenmore left
Shields on Nov. 18. for Carthagena. Sev
eral other collisions and wrecks of small
steamers are reported to have occurred
during the fog of yesterday.

. WASHINGTON,, Dec. 3. The short ses
sion of the Fifty-third Congress began at
noon to-day, with a fair attendance of
members and visitors. No unusual feature
marked the proceedings of the upper house.
Senators Voorhees and Turple were both
in their seats when the Senate was called
to order, Mr. Voorhees's ' desk being
adorned by a very pretty bunch of pink
carnations, sent "with the compliments of
Misses Edna Delcon and Edith Townley."
At 12 o'clock Vice President Stevenaon
rapped for order, and ex-chaplain Mllltrn
oflered prayer, referring to the illness of
Mr. Stevenson's daughter. The customary
opening resolutions were proposed and
adopted. The roll was called, showing the
presence of sixty members. A reces3 was
taken urjtll 12:03, during which the Sena
tors moved about the chamber exchaging
greetings. Many of the Senators had re
ceived floral tributes, which gave a touch
of color among the black garbs. The most
noticeable floral design was that placed on
the desk of Mr. Smith, of New Jersey, after
the session began. It represented a huge
shield of red, white and blue, with "New
Jersey" worked In crimson flowers across
the face. Mr. Brlce, of Ohio, was also the
recipient of flowers after the session
opened. At 12:30 the Senate took a further
recess until 1:30. '
Most of the well-known figures of the
Senate were in their accustomed places.
Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, the octogenarian
of the body, moved about with a step giv
ing little evidence of bis advanced years.
The tall, gaunt form of Sherman moved
about the chamber, much of the time being
on the Democratic side. Mr. Gorman passed
among his associates giving greetings with
that suavity which is such a marked char
acteristic with him. Mr. PeiTer sat In his
rear seat absorbed in a" newspaper, Messrs.
Jones, of Arkansas, and HarriV of Tennes
see, who had borne the brunt of tariff
work last fall conferred together. Senators
Voorhees and Vest, the two other conspicu
ous figures of the last tariff battle, had
their heads together during the recess. The
galleries looked in vain for Mr. Hill, of
New York, who was still absent in Florida.
On the Republican side, Mr. Walcott, of
Colorado. who has been so prominently
identified In the right for sliver, conferred
with Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania.
Messrs. Aldrich and Allison, the respective
tariff and appropriation authorities on the
Republican side had a half hour's confer
ence during the second recess, being joined
by Messrs. Teller and Cullom. These and
other informal gatherings of senatorial
groups were mainly for the exchange of
personal and political views, although the
prospects for the coming session were pret
ty fully discussed.
On the reassembling of the Senate, at
i:30, Messrs. Harris and Manderson re
ported that the President would communi
cate with the Senate by one or nis secre
taries. Executive Clerk Pruden Immedi
ately appeared at the main door, and the
white-haired Isaac IJassett, of the Senate
staff, announced, "Message from the Pres
ident." A large document was carried to
the Vice President, who directed that the
message be read. Thereupon Secretary
Cox, in measured tones, began reading the
document. In the meantime printed copies
of the message had been secured by many
Senators who read the text, instead of
listening to it. Most of them, however,
paid close attention to the reading. There
was special attention to the reference to
the China-Japan war. It was the first
ofllclal Information known even to mem
bers of the foreign committee.. It was
much briefer, however, than had been ex
pected, and left still open the exact details
of the negotiations. Shortly before the ref
erence to China-Japan was reached the
Chinese minister, attended by Mr. Chung,
an attache, entered the gallery reserved
for the diplomatic corps, and were inter
ested listeners to the foreign features of
the message. The reading of the message
closed at 3:40 o clock, having taken Just
two hours and ten minutes. The Vice
President announced that in accordance
with the usurJ custom the President's
message would lay on the table and be
printed.
Mr. Hoar offered a resolution, which was
adopted, requesting; the President to sub
rait information, if not incompatible with
the public service, concerning the recent
massacre of the Armenians in Turkey, and
as to what protest, memorials, etc., had
been presented by American citizens.
Mr. Turpie offered a resolution reciting
that the time had now come for the elec
tion of United States Senators by direct
vote of the people. Mr. Turple announced
that on Friday next he would submit some
remarks on the resolution, and in the mean
time the resolutions went over.
Mr. Lodge offered a resolution, calling on
the Secretary of State for particulars con
cerning the execution of two Japanese stu
dents by the Chinese at Shanghai when the
students had been given the protection of
the United States. At the request of Mr.
Gorman the resolution went over under the
rules until to-morrow.
Mr. Iilanchard presented a resolution pro
testing against the recent Turkish atroci
ties against Armenians and directing that
the remonstrance of this government be
communicated to Turkey. The resolution
went to the committee on foreign relations.
Mr. Peffer offered two resolutions. The
first directs the judiciary committee of the
Senate to Investigate the circumstances and
legal authority under which the Secretary
of the Treasury made the last two Issues
pf bonds. The second resolution calls on the
President for Information concerning the
circumstances and necessity for sendlna
United States troops to Chicago during the
pendency or the Pullman strike. Both res
olutlons went over under the rules. ,
Mr. Call offered a resolution for the aD
polntment of a special committee to inquire
as to what extent the Louisiana lottery
or jionauras lottery was operating in Flor
ida; whether either of them had sought to
control State or national elections; whether
their money had not been expended by
them in the recent elecons of members of
Congress, and whether they did not own
or subsidize newspapers in Florida. The
resolution went over.
The annual reports of the various depart
ments and bureaus were received. Then, at
4 o'clock, on motion of Mr. Gorman, the
Senate adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Opening? of the Short Sennlon Devoid
of Interenttujr Features.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The opening of
the House was picturesque In a way, but
devoid of Interesting features. The victor
ious Republicans and the defeated Demo
crats exchanged greetings and gave and
toolt thrusts on the result of Ihe recent
political battle with much animation but
thorough sood nature. The galleries were
crowded and half of the desks on the floor
were smothered with flowers. The Indiana
absentees were Messrs. Taylor, Johnson
Waugh. Hammond and McNagney. Mr.
Bynum was first counted as absent, but
it was afterwards discovered that the mem
ber from the Seventh district had shav:d
off his mustache and so signally disguised
himself that no one recognized him.
Representative Holman was one of the first
to put in an appearance. He was greeted
warmly by his old friends, and then went
to his seat and busied Llmself .lth the
business of the day. The leaders on both
sides got enthusiastic receptions from their
respective partisans, the appearance of
Speaker Crisp. ex-Speaker Reed, Mr. Wil
son and Mr. Burrows being the signal for
long and loud outbursts. Many of the
members' desks were strewn with flowers
as one of the House wits said, flowers for
the living and flowers for the dead." Many
of the floral pieces were large and hand
some. On the desk of ex-Speaker Reed was
an immense floral ship of state, sent, as
the card attached to it affirmed, by a "Pro
tectionist." "Advocate as you have." it read.
protection to American labor and the shin
of state will guide you Into a haven of
peaceful taters." On the desk of Repre
sentative Linton, of Michigan, was a large
floral schoolhouse, the compliment of an
A. P. A. organization for his championship
of the public school system. Many other
nanasome pieces adorned the desks.
onortiy before 12 o'clock Mr. Reed's
towering form was espied as he came down
tne center aisle, dressed in a conventional
black frock coat. Instantly the babble cf
voices on tne noor was drowned in a ring
ing cheer from his party associates. The
cheer was 'taken uo and echoed by the
galleries. Mr. Reed, with radiant face,
bowed his acknowledgments. A moment
later Representative Wilson, of West Vir
ginia, entered and the author of the tariff
bill was enthusiastically greeted, by his as
sociates, the Democrats responding with Hp
and hand to bis appearance. As thefhands
of the clock pointed to the hour of 12,
Speaker Crisp entered -the hall from the
lobby and ascended the rostrum. A burst
of applause signalized his entrance. With
several iihtu u.tn oi me gavei, ine
Speaker restored order and the second ses
sion of the Fifty-third Congress had begun.
About fifteen minutes after 12 o'clock Mr.
Breckinridge, of Kentucky, with snow-
white hair and beard, entered 'and walked
quietly to his seat. A page boy carrying
a large armful of roses ioiiowed and placed
them on his desK. noses, enrysanthemums,
orchids and others flowers were also car
ried in profusion for Messrs. Richardson,
Burrows and others until the hall almost
looked like a flower bower.
The roll call developed the presence of 215
members, forty-seven more than a quorum.
The Speaker announced the fact that sev
eral members elected to nil vacancies oc
casioned by death or resignation were pres
ent, and George P. Harrison of Alabama,
John S. Little of Arkansas, William L.
Henry, Chase E. Coffin and William L.
Laire of Maryland. William M. Beck
ner of Kentucky. J. H. Bromwell of
Ohio, and Michael Griffin were escorted to
the bar of the House and sworn in. The
Speaker announced the resignation of Amos
J. Cummlngs, of New York, who resigned
to accept an appointment as subway com
missioner of New York city. Upon motion
of Mr. Wilson. Democrat, of West Virginia,
a committee, consisting of himself, Mr. Hol
man and Mr. Reed, was appointed to join
a similar committee from the Senate and
inform the President that a quorum of both
houses was present and Congress was ready
to "receive any communication he desired
to make. Several other resolutions fixing
the hour of meeting, etc., were adopted,
and at 12:30 the House took a recess until
1 p. m. to await the President's message.
At 1 o'clock, the committee not yet having
arrived, a recess until 1:15 was taken.
When the committee at last walked down
the aisle the House was all attention while
Mr. Wilson announced that the President
would communicate his views in writing.
At 1:33 Mr. Pruden, the President's execu
tive clerk, appeared with the message,
which, by the direction of the Speaker, was
read by the Clerk of the House, Mr, Kerr.
The reading of the message occupied an
hour and forty-five mmutes. It was list
ened to with careful attention particularly
the portions relating to the tariff and the
banking scheme, but there was no demon
stration when it was concluded, mere was
no chance in the first day's proceedings
for anv public reference to tha election
so that the actual proceedings were dull
and uninteresting. The death of the late
Representative Wright, of Pennsylvania,
waa then announcad, whereupon the House,
as mark of respect, adjourned.

President Cleveland Action in the
Cne of General Swalnt.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. The announce
ment of the President's intention to retire
Judge Advocate-general Swaim this month
has caused much speculation in military
circles as to the succession. Under ordinary
circumstances General Swaim would not
retire before V if he cared to remain on
the active llSi, and in deciding to avail
himself of the privilege of arbitrarily retir
ing an officer of this rank on reaching the
age of sixty-two without the officers' ap
plication, the President has adopted a
course which, while perfectly legal, has
very few precedents In the history of the
arm Up to this time but two names
have been prominently mentioned for the
succession. One Is Joseph Doe, of Wiscon
sin, Assistant Secretary of War, and the
other is Col. Q. H. Iieber. of South Car
olina, Mr. Doe has. however, publicly de

several of the specifications, but found the
General guilty, by a bare majority, of
conduct unbecoming an officer. Thfy sen
tenced him to suspension from rank and
pay for one year. President Arthur re

the report to the court. The court inade

times It was returned by the PresUent,
and finally the court sentenced General
Swaim to suspension on half pay lor

WASHINGTON, De-2. 3,-Coincident with
the return to the United States of Dr. Kin
yon, of the Marine Hospital Service, who
went to Europe to Investigate and report on
the diphtheria cure, is the fact that ex
periments are already being made to ob
tain serum with which to conduct experi
ments in this country. The horse which is
being used for the purpose of experimenta
tion and from which it is hoped to obtain
a supply of serum was purchased for the
Marine Hospital Service some time ago and
is now kept in a branch station of the Agri
cultural Department near Bennlngs, D. C.
He has been given several Injections of the
liquid obtained from the feeding- of diph
theria germs taken from the throat of a
child suffering from diphtheria, in a mix
ture of beef broh and peptone, until they
have reached full development. To get the
animal thorough. Immuned against the
disease will take from- seven to nine
months administration of the liquid. When
the animal is In condition and the germs
have had full effect the horse is bled and
the serum secured. The results of the ef
fect on the horse are being watched with
much interest and care was taken in se
lecting him to get one free from 'disease-of
any kind.

WASHINGTON, Dec. . 3. Complaint o?
Irregularities conducted through the United
States and English mails has been made
to the Postoffice Department by the English
embassy, and as a result Postmaster-general
BIssell to-day directed the postmasters
at New York, Boston, . Philadelphia and
Baltimore to return to senders" all regis
tered letters addressed to the International
Patentees' Agency or to either W. 11.
Munn, Percy Willis or Henry Martin, con
stituting the agency. The parties are
charged with conducting a . fraudulent
scheme through the American and inter
national mails, from London. The official
orders recuire that the returned communi
cations be marked "fraudulent," and post
masters have been directexl to refuse to
certify money orders to the agency or its
operators. The agency has addressed cir
culars to patentees throughout the coun
try, representing that it will have, inven
tions patented by both the United States
and the British government, and that the
Official Gazette, of the United States Pat
ent Office, gives the ogency all the infor
mations about inventions that is required to
obtain a provisional protection for nine
months, during which period a four years'
patent may be obtained. The agency, ac
cording to postal officials, advertised that
government fees are $5 for a provisional
protection for nine months and $42 for four
years, while the only compensation asked
by the concern, after the money for either
right has been forwarded. Is the sole rijrht
of sale of the Invention .when patented for
three months. Many people in this country
have made complaint that they have not
heard from the agency since making their
remittances.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. President Cleve
land came to the White House from Wood
ley at 10 o'clock this morning. It was
the first visit he had made to the city In
two weeks past. He came alone, and was
met by Private Secretary Thurber. The
President looked very' well, conslJerlng the
severe Illness he has suffered from, and the
only outward sign of his ailment was the
pronounced limp which characterized hj3
walk from the carriage into the houje.
Probably because his coming had not be, n
generally expected there were very few
callers at the White House In the morning,
the only one of note being Representative
Catchfngs, of Mississippi, who. In behalf
of the Steaker, came to inquire whether
the President would receive the committee
of notification at the White House.

that will attract most attention Is th
indorsement of Secretary Carlisle'

tem. which the President outlines. Tho
message follows:
To the Congress of the United Stales:
The assemblage withinthe Nation's legis
lative halls of those charged with the duty
of making laws for the benefit of a gen
erous and free people Impressively sug
gests the exacting obligation and inexora

national affairs and recommending auclj

M;W ClllREXCY SCHEME.
Proponed Change In the Hanklucr
Lnun-Itnd Iaue.
During the last month the gold reserved
In the treasury for the purpose of redeem
ing the notes of the government circulat
ing as money in the hands of the peopla .
became so reduced and Its further deple
tion In the future teemed so certain that
In the exercise of proper care for th-j pub
lic welfare it became necessary to replen
ish this reserve and thus maintain ropu
ular faith In the ability and determination
of the government to meet, as agreed, ita
pecuniary obllKations. It would have been
well if. in this emergency, authority had
existed to i.-sue the bonis of the govern
ment "bearing a low rate of interest and
maturing within. a special period. But the
Congress having fallei to confer such
authority, report was necessarily bad to
the resumption act of 1S75, anJ, pursuant
to Its provisions, bonds were issued draw- .
Ing interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per
annum and maturing ten years after their
issuing, that being the shortest time au
thorized by the act. I am glad to say,
however, that in the sale of these bonds
the rremlum received operated to reduce
the rate of interest to be pal-l by the gov
ernment to less than 3 per cent.
Nothing could be worse or further re
moved from sensible finance than th re
lations existing between the currency the
governmtnt has issued. :he goll held for
its redemption and the means which mu?t
be resorted to for the purpose of replen
ishing such redemption fund when im
paired. Even if the claims upon this fund
were confined to -the obligations originally
intended, and if th redemption of these
obligations meant their cancellation, the
fund would be very small. But hee ob
ligations, when received and redeemed in
gold, are not canceled, but are reissued
and may do duty many times by way of
drawing gold from the treasury. Thus wa
have an endless chain in operation con
stantly depleting the treasury's Kld and
never near a final rest. As if this wert
not bad enough, we have by a statutory
declaration that it is the policy of th
government to maintain the parity be
tween gold and silver, thus aiding the force
and momentum of this exhausting process
and aiding largely to the currency obliga
tions claiming this peculiar gxld redemp
tion. Our small gold reserve is thus sub
ject to drain from every siie. The de
mands that increase our danger also In
crease the necessity of protecting this
reserve against depletion, and It Is most
unsatisfactory to know that the protec
tion it affords is only a temporary pallia
tion. MUST SELL BONDS.
It 4 perfectly and palpably plain that
the only way under present conditions by
w'hlch this reserve when dangerously de
pleted can be replenished Is through the
issue and sale cf the bonds of the govern
ment for gold; and yet Congress has not only
thus far declined to authorize the issue of
bonds best suited to such a purpose, bu:
there etems t disposition In some quarter
to deny both the necessity and power for
the issue of bonds at mlL I cannot or a.
moment believe that any of our citizens ara
deliberately willing that their government
should . default in Its pecuniary obliga
tions or that its financial opera
tions should be reduced to a silver
basis. At any rate. I should not feel that
my duty was done if I omitted any effort
I could make to avert such a calamity. As
long, therefore, as no provision Is made
for the final redemption or the putting
aside or the currency ooiigaticn novy used
to repeatedly and constantly draw from
the government its gold and a long as no
better authority for bond issues is allowed
than at present exists, such authority will
be utilized whenever and as often as it
becomes necessary to maintain a eufflcient
gold reserve and in abundant time to aave
the credit of our country and make good
the financial declarations of our govern
.ment. Questions relating to c.'r banks and cur
rency are closely connected wVth the sub
ject Just referred tp. and a3 present iome
satisfactory features. Prominent among
them are the lack of elasticity in our cur
rency circulation and its frequent concen
tration in financial centers when It is most
needed In other parts of the country. The
absolute divorcement of the government
from the business of banking is the ideal
relationship of the government to the cir
culation of the currency of the country.
This condition cannot be Immediately
reached, but as a step in that direction and
an a means cf ecutini? a more elastic cur
rency nnd obviating other objections to the
present arrangement of bank circulation,
the Secrrtary of the Treasury presents In
his report a scheme mollfylng the present
banking laws and providing for the issue
of circuiting notes by Rate banks fres
from taxation under certain limitation.
The recrrtary explains his plan c plainly
and its advantages are developed by him
with such remarkable clearness that nny
effort on my part to present arguments in
Its support would be superfluous. I tthall.
therefore, content tnys-If with an unquali
fied Indorsement of the Secretary's pro
posed changes In the law and a brief and
Imperfect review of their prominent feat-
