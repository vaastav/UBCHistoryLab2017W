OUR NAVAL STRENGTH.-
In his latest message President Taft
refers to the great mistake which was
made by the last congress in provid
ing for but one battleship, and the
need to make up for the action by
making appropriations for three as this
ession, believing that It is necessary
tf our navy 1s to be maintained as an
insurance of peace. Our navy, through
the extra efforts made by foreign Bow
ers, is threatened with becoming fourth
In classification unless the plan of at
least two battleships a year Is carried
out. It was only five years ago that
we ranked next to the British navy,
but we have slipped from that posi
tion through our inactivity and through
the activity of Germany, and are but
- lightly ahead of France, which Is
steadily Improving her position.
Great strides are being made by the
British and German empires because
of a feeling of distructfulness of each
other and it Is a pace In navy build
ing unprecedented. The British em
pire through the dependencies will roll
' up a big addition to the fleet, Canada
at present anticipating the gift of
three dreadnoughts while India con
templates about the same, Australia
and others giving one or, more. Be
cause of our position as a world power
our possessions which need protection
and the responsibilities which we as
sume. It is necessary to have a suffi
cient navy to back our stand and up
hold our Influence. It certainly can
not be done by decreasing our naval
strength, dropping back from a first
to a second class power and ranking
fourth Instead of third.
ENCOURAGING NEW BUSINESS.
It Is always an inspiration to wit
ness the encouraging of new business
and in no Instance is this being done
on a larger scale than by the rail
roads throughout the west. There the
broad expanse of fertile land awaits
cultivation. It is well split up by rail
roads, but it needs the presence and
attention of the farmers. This has long
been the aim of J. J. Hill of the Great
Northern, but he and his road are not
alone In the extensive work.
Of the total of 249,992 miles of road
operated In 1910 in this country, ex
clusive of Alaska and the inland pos
sessions, 191,448 miles or 76.6 per cent,
were operated by companies making
organised efforts to Increase the num
bar of farmers or promote agricultural
education. Of the total land area of
the country 89.2 per cent, is in coun
ties penetrated by railroads doing this
work. This is, of course, a process of
development, primarily for the rail
roads but also for the nation. It is
the business of handling the product
of the farms, which the encouragement
will result in, that the railroads are
after. It is a proper ambition and its
worth is recognized by the roads of
the east, where manufacturing instead
of farming is being encouraged. De
partments are maintained for the ben
efit of the business seeking a location,
and a locality seeking a business and
Norwich knows the value of such ser
vices. AH parties Interested are the
gainers by the laudable method of in
creasing business.
OWE CENT POSTAGE.
' Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania is
getting much favorable support for his
Mil in behalf of one cent postage
v. hich he has Introduced at this session
of congress. It is a matter which has
vefived agitation for a number of
-ai s and is bound to be adopted soon
or later as the business of the post
develops and expands. An or
'ration has been pushing such

require further adjustments or leave

continuance the improvements

insthe way is heiVif paved for the one
cant latter rate.
COTTON AND COTTON FACTORIES
What is to become of the J cotton
lactones o this country is an 'inter
esting question which faces those in
terested in the industrial problems,
especially when consideration Is given
to the fact that Leader Underwood of
the democratic forces says, "we .are
going to revise the tariff from agate
to zinc" which from a democratic
standpoint must mean a revision down
ward, at least', whether it reaches free
trade or not.
This country is the greatest pro
ducer of cotton in the world supply
ing seventy per cent, of the total
amount of raw cotton for mill con
sumption. About two-thirds of this
production of the United Startes is ex
ported to European countries, from
which we In turn import a large
amount of cotton manufacturers, most
ly of the higher grades. We rank
third among the world's greatt Import
ers of cotton goods, though raising the
raw material which Is sent.auroad to
be bought back again.
As exporters of cotton? goods we
are making steady progress, but are
far behind certain industrial countries
of Europe which continue to find this
country a rich market Cotton mills
here are todav showing a decline in
profits, even though prospwity is being
enjoyed throughout the country.
Higher wages are being flemanded in
the face of the threatened tariff re
vision, .a condition which is likely to
further open this country to the fac
tories of Europe and the cheap labor
employed there. It would be a much
better thing to encourage the factories
of this country to greater business in
stead of handing it over to Europe.
. . r
THE LIBERTY BELL.
Great value Is attached to the ob
taining of the Liberty bell for' each
and every patriotic demonstration
throughout the country. It Is consid
ered necessary to canupjete all the de
tails and naturally it would provide
an object of much interest wherever
displayed, particularly to the children.
California is making al determined ef
fort to obtain it for fine Panama ex
position at San Francisco in 1915 for
which petitions aggregating two miles
in length have been sent to Phila
delphia.
Had this occurred a few years ago
there would not have been the least
hesitancy for it was considered an
honor to be called upon for Its use,
but in its trips about the country it
has been subjected to the necessary
jar and strain of handling itt and the
crack which has Invalidated it for so
long appeared to be widening. The de.
cision therefore that It was not to be
subjectQd to any more rides about the
country was arrived at because of the
risk involved, the desire being to keep
the bell Intact as long as possible. Cal
ifornia hopes to overcome this and is
doing its best to uphold her claim that
so long as other expositions have had
it, they ought not to be deprived and
that the people of the Pacific coast
should have a chance to get a look at
it. Philadelphia indicates that she will
continue to say no, politely but firmly,
and it can be readily understood that
it is better td have the bell at Phila
delphla intact than in pieces.
EDITORIAL NOTES.
It is safe to plan on Woodrow Wil
son being inaugurated March 4,. pomp,
weather and all.
From all reports there seems to be
reason in the democratic cry of swat
the office seekers.
Happy thought for today: The best
nerve tonic of the season .is early
Christmas shopping.
The moving pictures, which please
the storekeepers most, are the busy
buyers and the early ones.
The bookmen seem to have about
the same control in New England that
the gunmen did in New York.
When Gov. Blease of South Caro
lina speaks it sounds like an echo
from the recent election campaign.
Now that peace has been signed in
the Sickles family and the war relics
saved, there is hope for Turkey and
Greece.
If wouldn't be surprising if the
weather was bothering Santa Claus.
It's hard to tell which conveyance to
make ready.
A woman in New Jersey who broke
two ribs and an arm trying to kiss a
bashful boy will have time to repent
at her leisure.
If you miss anything' nowadays it
is well to be cautious. Perhaps it Is
being used to match up your Christ
mas present by.
The book agents quickly demonstrate
that they know where the people are
who have the money and that they
know how to get it.
Bulgaria has won a great victory at
the sacrifice of the leading business
and prbfesslonal men. War is all Gen
eral Sherman said it was.
With the Cape Cod canal five-eighths
done. New England coasting trade can
begin to anticipate the overcoming of
a mighty dangerous route.
The postal card circulation has been
diminished nearly one-half by the pic
ture post card, but that doesn't please
the letter carriers and postal clerks
any.
While the fad of showing one's teeth
when photographed is said to have
spru.ng up in Washington. It was sup,
posed that was confined strictly to Oy
ster Bay.
Changes have been made in many
of the New Haven road officials. As
they have been promotions It can have
no reference to the many wrecks of
the recent past.
When the democrats face the fact
that $43,000,000 has been realized by
the farmers of the south and west on
beet sugar they will do some thing
ing over slashing the sugar schedule.
A one man shellfish commission Is
being strongly urged instead of three
on the board. and yet in the matter
of highways, where one man has made
a big success, three are now being ad
vocated. That the New Haven Times-Leader
has been obliged to add materially to
its mechanical equipment in order to
keep up with its steady growth is one
of the Incontrovertible facts that New
Haveners not only appreciate its good
service, but can expect it to continue.
Norwich is trying to get the Con
necticut company to use its streets
for better transportation. In Bridge
port they are endeavoring to stop the
company from getting any . more
streets. Why not make the efforts
where they will be most appreciated?
THE MAN WHO TALKS
Every family's problem as to liv
ing n ft own nroblem. and must be
settled within its own .abode by skill
ful management It is the fashion to
look at the market reports ana mo
middlemen and then to Jump up into
the chairs and scream concerning
outrages which are -largely chargable
to our own account. What we want
not what we actually need opens the
avenue for expenses; and our wants
are usually in excess ot our incomes.
It is right here every family must put
on the brakes and first of all get their
needs and their financial ability to
gether for an understanding. This will
immediately affect the purpose wnue
screaming about the grocer, the bak
er and the candleetlckmaker at best
results only in bad temper and a loud
noise. It is unmethodical .and it is
lack of method which makes us ir
rational. The way to cheapen things
is to lessen the demand to halt! The
men having them for sale cannot al
ways wait. If he cannot sell them at
his price he will eventually sell them
for' what he can get . Combinations
help protect the people, but those
will not protect them from their own
extravagances. ' The home tackle is
the real hold by which outgo and
income may be balanced and to this all
other grips are secondary.
Ttoere is a proverb that ''a good book
Is, one of the best of companions," but
only a small per cent, of the people
who read find this out. Reading is a
way of increasing knowledge and cul
tivating thought. Living truth from
great minds are to1 be found in, good
books;- but when the book is finished
what the writter thinks is of less im
portance to you than what you think
of his work. Those who read all the
new books as fast as published do
not get from books what a reader does
who has a fixed purpose in reading.
Emerson laid down three good rules
regarding the perusal of books: First,
never read any book that is not a year
old; second, never any but famed
books; third, never any but what you
like, which means reading for a pur
pose; waste no time, select books of
life 'and power, cultivate your taste
along high and inspiring lines. ' It was
Bacon who said, "read not to contra
dict and confute, nor to, believe and
take for granted; nor to find talk and
discourse, but to weigh and consider."
To know how to read is to satisfy the
mind and make rapid progress.
What is a good hater? You may have
heard some one spoken of in this way,
and upon the whole he was regarded
as a. very estimable gentleman. This
is the way we use language. There is
nothing good about hate never was
and never will be. The feeling of
hate depresses the hater, but in no way
affects the hated, unless the hater
Btoops to violence. A mind controlled
by hatred soon becomes abnormal it
is really diseased and this leads men
to villainy to every kind of evil con
spiring.' A good hater is sunnosed to
be one who does not easily relent one
who breathes vengeance from every
pore ;and keeps it up. How good is he
when you view him Just as he is? He
is 'dependable to wreak vengeance to
act along the most contemptible and
most cruel lines. Good never travels
that way. Nothing coed comes of such
a disposition. Hatred has been defined
aa maaness or the heart." It is a
question even, whether hating evil
is a virtue since the virulence of hat
ing tans to make saints of the
rignteous. There is noeause for hat
ing since we can abhor and not fly off
uo ueiuer oi calmness.
Perhfees the fellow who appears to
ue mucn worse than I am is a bet
ter fellow than I would be In his con
dition. We are born to conditions with
power to better them if they are not
too good, or to make them worse if we
think it will make life more interesting.
We do not start equal; and opportu
nities are sometimes so contracted that
they make one feel that betterment is
ft false hope. A fellow who was well
born and had a good start has no
excuse for having become a knave;
but there is merit in the rise of a
man to knowledge, dignity and honor
from, a meager beginning. The reason
man cannot Judge righteously of an
other Is because he has to measure
him by conditions which were not the
other fellows. It is by our yardstick
we measure manhood and woman
hood, and it is usually a cheat, for it
is never a correct measure for any
one else. The man who is trained
through juvenilty and youth by ef
ficient people has no knowledge of life
compared to the man who was born
to the realm of toil and Ignorance and
early service and short schooling. We
get our opinion of the world early, and
the concreted prejudices of childhood
are hardest to overcome. Treat a child
like a dog and the tiger will be in
him before he is 20. We better-than-thou
fellows may be responsible for
some of the evil we despise.
There is no one who has more re
spect for the man who is trying to
Somewhere that I am o rnot Some-
for him. It is of no importance wheth
er he is following the same road to
somewhere that I am or not Some
where has just aa many gates as the
new Jerusalem, and we may focus
all right if we are not on the same
point of the compass. I can re
spect the man who thinks there is, only
one gate to Somewhere, and that those
only are trying to be something or
someDoay wno are trailing his foot
steps. - Narrowness is not a crime, if
u is common it is only a fault which
may be overcome. I suppose most
people are trying to get Somewhere:
and a big per cent, of them are not to
blame because they get Nowhere, for
mat was me Place they were born to
and find H a difficult task to depart
from. Home is home if it is ever so
homely. The popular song, "I am Go
ing Somewhere, I Don't Know Where,
But I'm on my Way," isn't any more
humorous than It is serious. Getting
somewhere does not always add to
our manhood, or lend assurance to our
nopes, v
' Every man who is making money
should see that he Is at the same
time learning how to spend it. It 1b
a bad plan for any one to save monev
and waste himself; or to lend himself
to making a fortune without pre
paring nimsen to fully enjoy it. Get
ting money alone for the sake of hav
ing money, of being rich, is to unbal
ance one's self. There is mental and
spiritual neea to De met as well as
physical ,and it must not be neirlected.
The spiritual man calls for the riches
money cannot buy, and without them
earthly riches are not satisfying.
Franklin pointed out that "wealth is
not his who-has it ,but his who en
joys it!" We find temporary joy in
possessing wealth, and the loss if it
causes intense misery. He whose
only dependence Is money is possessed
by fear, and fear demands that he shall
have a rallying point. Lacking this the
man of wealth is In danger of becoming
a victim of his own base Imaginings.
Life demands of man the best that is
in mm oeiore it win yield to him the
best that is in it If you are making
money learn how to enjoy it Do not
employ greed as a superintendent of
your pile and die with his clutch up
on you, instead of your clutch upon
hope.
- Ignorance is at bottom of our
woes; apd man is beast learned about

his own well-being. All scientific in
vestigators come to the one conclu
sion, that human life is wasted. The

(Written Specially for the Bulletin.)
A dull, gloomy day In November
found Mrs. Merton in her mother's
room for a chat soon after breakfast
She was favored with long visits from
her mother, who was a welcome guest
at all times, and as much a pleasure
to Mr. Merton as to his wife. He often
said he failed to understand the fre
quent jokes at the expense of mothers-in-law,
or else Mrs. Brown was a
great exception. Certainly she and
Mr. Merton were on the best of terms,
and her coming in. the autumn of
each year was looked forward to by
him as one of the joys of Thanksgiv
ing, at which time she was siure to
aIAVgioomy day this threatened to be,
not yet stormy but cold, windy, and
dull. Mrs. Merton sank back in her
chair with a sigh. "There is so much
for me to do today that I am perplexed
to know what to choose for the day's
die in a hundred, are victims of diso
bedience to natural laws. The average
person does not use himself well. No
creature God has made lets appetite
make such a wreck ,or such a fool, of
him as man. The excesses we are all
guilty of amazes the doctors, who are
themselves not wholly free from them.
In many directions we enjoy wasting
ourselves; and go on impairing our
health by senseless indulgences, we
do things to find enjoyment or com
fort which impair our health, for get
ting that without health we are likely
to win neither. We all ought to know
how to live better live trues for to
day and for tomorrow, for the mistakes
of today may mar many days to come.
One of the 150 visiting German doctors
says Americans are a race of dyspep
tics because ot tneir mauigence in
ice cream. Oh, how many good things
are productive of distressing results.
Snowflaky weather began on
Thanksrivine day and a winter land
scape was the result. We looked out
upon the beautiful snow,' I realize
some people deride the idea that there
is anything beautiful about the snow;
and most of them have no idea of the
crystalized raindrop which has been
discovered to take on izou aisunct
lacy, geometrical forms, and every
form a separate picture. When Veu
look out of the window upon the flying
flakes the air is just full of Beauty;
and to learn this patient students had
to catch the snow flakes on cold glass
slides and examine them beneath a
microscope, and make pictures of them.
These tiny snow flakes have promoted
art, and the world in general knows
nothine about it and cares less. Na
ture creates a 'million of these forms
in the time it would take an artist to
sketch one ;and most people wonder
what there is in nature that is fascin
ating they do not know the plumage
of buterfiies which appear to them like
dust, is made up of perfectly formed
scales as pretty as the feathers of a
humming bird. The snow is oeauti
ful. and its work beneficent, for it pro
tects plants from the fierceness of the
frost, and it teaches man forethought
and economy because he must pro
vide against the season of ice and
snow drift ,

work. I am told that duties never
conflict, but I am sure mine do. Now
today, for instance, I ought to go to
see poor Mrs. Wilder. I havent been
there for several weeks, and I prom
ised her to come often. She seems
so forlorn since her husband's death.
Then the other is that heap of mend
ing on my work-basket ' waiting and
Increasing constantly, and I should
spend the entire forenoon at my desk,
Judging from the looks of the piles
of notes and letters. I feel over
whelmed whenever I stop to think
of all the accumulations of work to be
done, and which to choose I do not
know.
"Let me advise you, then," replied
her mother. "Go to Mrs. Wilder and
try to cheer her up. A day like this
is depressing to anyone placed as she
is. You may be able to comfort her
and brighten the day for her. I will
attack your work-basket I taught
you to mend and am equal to that
task, anyway. As for your letters and
notes, use the telephone as much, as
you can, nd you will find less to do
then. Mrs. Wilder is your first duty,
I am sure, but don't talk all the time
while there about her loss. That is
always in her mind. Take her some
of those pretty flowers Frank brought
you last night, and tell her all the
society news you know. She used to
enjoy that sort of thing very much.
I know well that after your father's
death I was thankful indeed when my
friends directed my thoughts to some
other channel than that where I found
them constantly drifting. I realized
my loneliness at all times and was
glad to be made to think and talk of
Other topics. Tell her all the funny
things you know, the children s pranks
and odd speeches, or the blunders your
new cook made at Thanksgiving, any
thing except her own sadness and loss.
I wish she had three 'rollicking chil
dren like yours. One thing she has to
be thankful for; there is plenty of
money a't her disposal. Now, I was
left comparatively poor, you know, and
had to plan pretty closely to make
both ends meet and care for you and
your two brothers. You are all well
provided for now, and I feel more than
repaid for my exertions. No mother
was ever more happily placed in her
advancing years than I, that is cer
tain. But if I keep on talking you
will fail of reaching Mrs. Wilder.
Send the children In to see grandma
while you are gone."
Mrs. Merton was soon equipped for
her visit, and very thankful that such
was her choice. The lonely widow was
more than grateful for the attention.
"I am so glad you came." she said as
her friend took her leave. "You have
cheered me so much. I should have
moped here all by myself had you not
come. So few would come to me on
such a day. I wish you would bring
those children of yours to see me soon,
I'd love to have them come, and I do
enjoy children, though I have none of
my own. I have seriously thought
would take one into my home from
some institution or other. It would
be a great care for me, but, if all
turned out well, it would be a com
fort as well. Come often, won't you,
and bring one of your boys next time."
On reaching her own home Mrs.
194
Merton went at once to her mother
and the children, whom she found with
her aa she expected to do. Thetr
mother rewarded the good behaviour
reported of them with the bundle of
sweets she had brought them and sent
them to the nursery to enjoy their
feast, while she reported the outcome
of her call.
"I am glad I took your advice and
went to 'Mrs. Wilder. 8 he was so gJad
to see me and was interested in all
the news I carried her. She wants
to have the children brought to see
her; I feared they would be a trouble,
for I did not know she liked children.
She strongly thinks of adopting a child.
I wish she would. It would give her
a notion in life, arvd she haa so little
to occupy her time and thought, but
one is so uncertain of those who come
from Institutions. I hardly knew how
to advise her."
I know Just the one for her," ex
claimed Mirs. Brown. "There Is in
mv neighbourhood at home the very
one for her, a little girl five or six
years of age, of good family and train
ing, but whose parents have recently
died, and tlie child is left destitute.
The authorities aTe talking of putting
her Into the county home or something
Bimilar. I know they will be delighted
at this solution of the problem, for
they have disliked to be forced into
the other arrangement and feel sorry
for the child. She is pretty In looks
and gentle in manner, and I know Mrs,
Wilder will be pleased with her. Let
me send for her to come here for a
visit, and we can arrange with Mrs.
Wilder to see her and decide about It
A good thing for both, I am con
vinced."
Again was Mrs. Brown s advice fol
lowed and with good results. Mrs.
Wilder was at once attracted to the
child, and? the little girl responded to
the affectionate kindness shown ner,
with all the strength of her poor little
lonely heart. Both were very happy
in their new relations, and all con
cerned felt it to be an ideal arrange
ment. "And it all came from your morn
ing call," said Mrs. Wilder, while Mrs.
Merton felt amply repaid of the exer
tion she made on that memorable,
gloomy November day.
" You shall advise me In all things
after this, mother," she declared," for
surely you have shown yourself skil
ful In solving difficult questions."

8EDATIVE OR 8TIMULANT.
A good doctor should have skill In
diagnosis. He must know the disease
ha is treating before prescribing a
remedy. Most of the medicine that
is poured down invalid throats is good
for something. It Is, unfortunately,
not always good for the particular ail
ment of the patient who swallows it
Tlhe first, and often the hardest Job
of the M. D. is te locate the trouble.
We physicians called to the cure of
souls have need of similar discern
ment. A considerable part of the
counsel we give In public and In pri
vate is Ineffective because unsulted to
the needs of the individual patient
Among the many dagraas ef spiritual
need ens may note at least two grand
divisions. There are people who need
sedatives and others who need stimu
lants. Some require calming down
and some need nothing so much as to
be stirred up.
In the churches there are many who
are broken in spirit from carrying
heavy burdens, consumed with anxiety
over the greater or the lesser ills of
life. Some of them are the most esti
mable people In the community. They
shoulder the burdens of great reforms,
they stand behind the great missionary
enterprises at home and abroad, tjwy
are foreemost In their effort for all
good things In the places where they
live.
Worry Is reckoned as distinctively an
American sin. Uncle Jonathan is pic
tured as a thin, wiry gentleman, while
John Bull Is round, rosy and contented.
The characterization te mainly true.
Whether It Is due to the dry, stimu
lating air of America or the sharp
competitions of our business life or
to any one of a dozen other causes, a
great many people on this side of the
Atlantic are overborne with cares, per
plexities and apprehensions for the
future.
I never see these people in church
without wishing to speak a word of
peace to their spirits. Weary and
heavy laden, they need a comforting,
quiet gospel as full of balsam and nf
balm as the breezes that play through
a pine forest
But there are other patients whose
case does not call for sedatives. They
do not need a remedy for worry, but
rather to be told to worry a bit more
about some things. When these peo
ple come to church the preacher Is
less disposed to pull out the soft stop
than te turn on the electric battery,
As regards spiritual matters they
art careless and indifferent. Immersed
in their own selfish concerns they give
nothing of time or strength to good
causes. No splendid reform claims
their support; they strive to right no
wrong. Like Meroz of old, they come
not to the help of the Lord against the
mighty.
Such as these require not light but
lightening. The sound of a trtimppt
in their ears should be made to shock
them out of their spiritual sloth.
"Woe unto them that are at ease in
Zion," said the Prophet Amos cen
turies ago. A great many successors
of those lazy folk are lolling about
both within and without the walls of
Zion" today. With appalling indlffer
$18.50 to $26.50
$9.50 to $14.50
6, 8, 10, 12, 14
ence to the deeper issues of life ao4
destiny they neither rherlsh the ideals
nor do the works of faith.
There in a remedy for this trouble
too. The gospel Is Just what the
Apostle Paul called It the "dunamts"
o God. It Is the spiritual dynamite
that shall rend the hard rock of imp's
selfishness and awaken the thought
less to a sense of responsibility.
Gentle reader, which do you need
a sedative or a stimuhuit.'

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.
Good Seats Not All Checked Off.
Mr. Editor: In the absence from

comes my duty and pleasure to recon
cile "Justice" to his seat In H later
hal. He laments that at a. m. he la
able "to find nothing in the whole hall
that can be called a good seat" It mutt
be apparent to him, now thut he haa
given second thought to the matter,
that the only poor seats In Plater hail
are those in range of the pillar. All
other seats are "good seats." th bet
being those in the annexes and thomp
back of the center In the mi'lUm
block.
He says "All the people p'it together
from those three towns do not take a
third of the seats that are marked o
when the tickets go on sale." As a
matter of fact 86 seats had been
checked off In the middle Work whn
the sale began. Of these 8. 1 nt
to New London, WnWIy and WiIU
mantlc, 25 to other patrons who mas .
td to the committee entitled to p7?j
consideration. There still remain"!
untaken 1344 seats in the central thk.
besides annex and side iK-ats. 1 arn re
ceiving other requests from out of town
for seats, and hope to find "food'
seats remaining, eveej now.
The chief promoter of ths. concert",
who has often risked a conidraf.'e
loss to bring good music to Norwich,
and who la paying for tn 'otirs tick
ets at live dollars each, find hi
sufficiently "good," though tl.'y are a. I
In the side block.
If "Justice" will guarantee u against
