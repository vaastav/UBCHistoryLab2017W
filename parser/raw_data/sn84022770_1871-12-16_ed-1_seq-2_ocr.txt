The Echo and Ourself.
Tlie Echo acknowledges that there is
tome truth in our article of last week, re
lating to the position of the temperance
lodges and the Republican nominees for
Congress in several of the pnst contests.
While it freely a flirty that it " is not ilia
posed to deny the truth " of some of our
assertions, it objects to receiving them be
cause it affects to believe they are " not
given in the spirit of truth." Now we ob
ject to the spirit having anything to do
with deciding the merits of the controver
sy. When we present facts, we expect
that they shall be received as facts. If the
essence of truth is given, it should matter
but little what may be the spirit which
prompts it. Truth is a gem that cannot
bo tarnished by falsehood or sophistry,
•nd all the verbiage our cotemporary is
capable of piling upon the subject cannot
obscure ita brightness or diminish its power
for good.
The Erho admits our propositions in the
*tai». To quote its own language :
" In one of the instances to which the STAND
ARD alludes, his enndidnte was dnnhtless supe
rior in moral worth, bat he bad nothing which
was calculated to draw out and attach temper
ance men to kit support."
We have reason to believe that our co
temporary alludes to Gov. Moore, in the
above quotation, the Democratic nominee
in opposition to Garfielde in his first cam
paign. The moral superiority of our can
didate being admitted by the Echo, we
presume that point is settled; but wc most
emphatically deny that his opponent pre
sented superior claims to the support of
temperance men. If the Governor did set
wines before his guests, or indulged in
their OM, it was in obedience to social cus
toms that he regarded as imperative as any
common usages of society. As Govern
or, he was bound to respect the ruW of
hospitality, and it was no part of his duty
to fly in the faoe of popular sentiment by
affecting support of a reform which had
not yet learoed to distinguish its friends
from its foes. But Garfieldd, the Echo
indirectly affirms, had something to " draw
out and attach temperance men to his sup
port." What was it ? Will the Echo an
swer ? Was it his eontempt for the obli
gation of the Order ? Was it his habits
of dissipation 1* Was it his association
with gamblers, or his well known skill in
the game of poker ? Was it that while lie
was reeking with the fumes of the bar
room, so versatile was his genius, that he
could sit in the councils of the faithful
with the iosigoia of innocence and purity
upon his breast and whisper his vows at
the shrine of the sanctuary ? l'ardon the
tpirit that prompts, and answer, dear Echo.
candidly, frankly, honestly.
Then again, while you affirm that in the
lodge "no political party or creed is
known," in the same breath you excuse
Good Templars for supporting Garfielde,
or what does this language mean ?
_" Tl ere wtre mom rer some political prin
ciples at issue, bearing upon the best interests
of the nation, which they deemed important to
be maintained. These have now, for tbe most
part, become so thoroughly interwoven with
the political fabric ot tbe government, as to be
in a measure settled."
Now, we ask, have not those clauses a
political significance f This must be ad
mitted, and then the query arises, which
candidate, judging from his political rec
ord, wai best adapted to subserve those
u best interests of the oatioo," the patriot
•ad soldier, who carried the wounds re
ceived while upholding the nation, its
honor and glory, or the politician, who af
ter « campaign in opposition to the war,
W to the wilds of British Columbia, aod
there preached treason until it was no
longer fashionable or profitable? The
£dt» well knows that this palaver about
" national interests," is nonsenso as ap
plied to the politics of this Territory, ouly
iii(< uilnl l«> dcffitf ili«* uia»»c« and aecure
their aid to foi»t into place a few aspiring
demagogue*. Kxcu-e the apirit which
pn metallic inquiry, dear Etho. and in
»wer, iao't it *o ?
In conclusion, arc cannot refrain from
congratulating the Orucr upon the decided
improvement in tlic loading articles of the
Echo. It of late nianvi'csts Du disposition
to avoid a discussion of its principles, and
instead of heaping abuse upon its oppo
nents, seems dispoted to appeal to the
reasoning faculties of its palrous, rather
thau to stimulate and keep alive the baser
passions and prejudice*.
*AR A city cotomporary, with n Rood deal
of satisfaction, makes merry over what be'ap
poses to lie a fact, that lager beer was drank
at tiood Templars hall on the occasion of a
dancing party which was recently held in it.
We have made diiigeut inquiry and tind no one
who saw anything of the kind and hence are
forced to the conclusion that the only lager at
the party was tinder the waistcoat of the afor
>aitl coteinporary.— i'eho.
W'c presume that our cotemporary has
made just such diligent inquiry iu this
instance, as lie did when it wa9 charged
that tiarOclde, although a member of the
order in good standing, drank whisky.
The publisher of the Echo appeared to
manifest much zeal in obtaining the facts,
but took good care not to inquire of any
body who could give direct information
upon the matter, aud the result was that
he could produce a large number of " wit
nesses" to testify that they had not seen
Sclucious partake of the forbidden beve
rages. This course puts us in mind of a
certain silly bird which when pursued, is
•aid to thrust its head in the sand, thus
obscuring its own vision doubtless in the
belief that the pursuer is likewise blinded
by the maneuver. In the above quotation
our colcmporary again betrays his anxiety
to impress upon the public the belief that
we indulge in the immoderate use of la-jer
beer. In fact the chief efforts of that
journal appear always to have been direc
ted towards inculcating, the belief that
all its political friends abstain from the use
of alcoholic beverages, though they may
stagger through the streets or play sineh
until the small hours of morning, and
that the editor of this paper and his friends
live, breathe and have their being amidst
the fuuie9 of " Asthmatic Bitters" aud la
ger beer. This is by no means the Icigitimat
sphere of the organ of a great temperance
reform, and betrays unmistakably the in
capacity of those having it in charge.
A VICTIM.—A year or more ago we
published one of the circulars scattered
broadcast through the mails by rogues
in New York, and other Eastern cities,
proposing to send counterfeit greenbacks
for a small remittance in good money. It
appears that these knaves find occasionally
people who are green enough to invest in
the palpable swindle and fraud. A few
days ago a box was received at the express
office in this place, addressed to a farmer
living on the Skookum Chuck, with a bill
of charges amounting to $lO3, to be paid
before the delivery of the box. The ap
plicant not having the money to pay these
charges, but stating that it contained a
remittance from a relative, the agent very
obligingly allowed him to open the pack
age, upon the promise to pay the charges
out of tho proceeds. But alas! for the
expectations of the enterprising recipient,
upon raising the lid, a slip of paper was
disclosed containing the words " Mr.
you're sold; don't tell anybody," and a dili
gent search only brought to light scraps of
paper and shavings, a few sheets of lead,
and pieces of an iron casting. The victim
of the " sell" insists that he is not a party
to the fraud ; that he really expect a re
mittance from a relative; but the facts arc
as we state them, and a letter submitted to
the inspection of the agent by him announ
ces the shipment of a package of coun
terfeit money. But we give him the
benefit of his denial of complicity, and of
the donbt, if there is room for a doubt in
the nutter.
BIUDINO SHOPS. —Henry Ward Bcoch
er recently declared that " every 'custom
house in the country is a bribing shop."
A cotemporary adds: Very true. But the
custom houses arc not the only bribing
shops in the country. The White House
is little less than a bribing shop if not a
great deal worse, and the War Department
is in the same bunt. Congress itself is a
bribing shop of the most depraved and
colossal proportions, and there is not a rad
ical in the country who does not recognize
and act, if he- acts at all, upon the known
fact.

Imagination an Aid to Journalism.
The C'orvsllis (Ogoj Gazette, in dol

•' It wonM be interesting to review the his
tory of I lie Hurtle through ail these lo tg yrmn,

be ? Time and »piice forbid* this—bat the
numrroiK parous who have been {Booaatiit
reader* of our paper during all this time, can
run otcr iu ttair minds, some of the most im
port'int ol these events —and that mnst suflice
for the present."
This is au original altcrnativefor inditing
a long article abounding in vigor, power,
warmth, scntentiousness, sublimity and pa
thos. The reader can elaborate such
incident* in this mental exercise as suit
h'l9 peculiar fancy, or his precise tempera
ment, at that cxict time. lie can but be
pleased with the retrospect, none can be
offended by the substitution of views at va
riance with his pre-couceived ideas, and
t'lerc can be no cavil upon questions in
vo'ving nice and subtile points of distinc
tion. What an improvement it is upon
the old system of editing a newspaper!
How easy it will be, when this plan is
generally adopted, to conduct a political
jonrnal. For instance we could say : " Se
lucius Garfielde—our readers can run
over iu their minds the secessiou pro
clivities, the gambling propensities and
drinking habits of this celebrated individ
ual, arid that must suffice for the pre-c.it. '
Or, " Flanders and the Good Templars—
our readers can review in their minds the
incidents succeeding the Flanders cam
paign, aud—sufficient for day is the
evil thereof." Then how easy it would be
to write pufFs. We could say, " Bettman,
twelve yeurs in business—our readers cau
review iu their minds the incidents which
have contributed to this firm's marked
success." Or, " Ligiitner &, Rosenthal—
San Francisco. Olympia. We leave our
readers to infer the advantages to be de
rived from a member of the firm residing
in San Francisco." Or, " Macleay, Hirscl),
Louthan, Harris, or I'arker—big stocks—
viricd assortments —cheap for cash ; wo
leave our readers to supply from imagina
tion everything further necessary for a
first-class puff." The Gazette should pat
ent the process as one tending to sim
plify and adorn the profession, and obviate
in a great measure the necessity, for the
Oregon style of journalism," heretofore
so prevalent on this coast.

The President's Message.
The following is that portion of the
the I'resident'! Message which refers to
oar relations with Ureal Britain :
The past year has, under a wise Provi
dence, beeu one of general prosperity to
the nation. It has, however, been attend
ed with more than usual chastisements in
l<iss of life aud property by storui and fire.
The disasters have served to call forth the
best elements of human nature in our
country, aud to develop a friendship for
us on the part of foreign natious which goes
far towards alleviating the distress occa
sioned by calamities. The beoevoleot who
have so generally shared their means with
the victims of these misfortunes will reap
their reward in the conciousness of having
performed a noble act, and in receiving the
grateful thanks of men, woman and child
ren whose sufferings they have relieved.
The relations of the Uuited States with
foreign powers continues to be frieodly.
The year has been an eventful one, in see
ing two great nations speaking one lan
guage and having one lineage, settling by
peaceful arbitrations disputes of long
standing, and liable at auy time to bring
these nations into hostile conflict. An ex
ample has thus been set, which, if success
ful iu its final issue, may bo followed by
other civilized nations, and be the fiual
means of returning to productive industry
millions of men maintained to settle the
disputed of nations by the bayonet aud
sword.
I transmit herowith a copy of the treaty
alluded to, which lias been concluded since
the adjournment of Congress, with her
Britanic Majesty, and u t»py of the pro
tocols of (he conferences of Commissioners
by whom it was negotiated. This treaty
provide* methods for adjusting the ques
tions pending between the two nations.
The various questions arc to be adjusted by
arbitrations. [ recommend Congress at
an early day to make provision for the tribu
nal of Geneva, and also for the several
Commissioners on the part of the United
States called for by the treaty. His Ma
jesty the King of Italy, the President of
the Swiss Confederation, and his Majesty
the Emperor of Brazil, have each consent
ed, on the joint request of the two Pow
ers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal
at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to
bo suitably expressed for the readiness
with which the joint request has been
complied with, by the appointment of gen
tlemen of eminence and learning to the
high positions. Ilis Majesty tho Empc
ror of Germany, has been pleased to com
ply with the joint wish of the two Govern
ments and has consented to act as arbitra
tor of the disputed water boundary
between the United States and Great Bri
tain. The contracting parties in tho
treaty have undertaken to rezard as
between themselves, certain principles of
Cuhlic law for which the United States
ave contended from the commencement of
their history. They have also agreed to
bring these principles to the knowlodge of
other maritime powers and to invite them
to accede to them. Negotiations arc going
on as to the form of the note by which
the invitation is to be extended to the
Powers.
I recommend the legislation necessary
on ike part of the United States te bring
Into operation articles of the treaty relat
ing to fisheries and other matters touching
the relations of the United States toward*
(he British North American possessions to
become operntive as soon as proper legis
lation shall be had on the part of Great
Hritnin and its possessions. It is much to
be desired that this legislation may become
operative before the fishermen of the Uni
ted States begin to make arrangements for
the coming season I have addressed a
communication, of which a copy is trans
mitted herewith, to the Governors of New
York, Pennsylvania. Ohio, Indiana, Mich
igan. Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon
the Governors of these States respectively
the necessary action on their part to carry
into effect the articles of the treaty which
contemplate the use of canals on cither
side connected with the navigation of the
lakes and rivers forming the boundery in
terms of equity bv the inhabitants of both
countries. It is hoped the importance of
the object and benefits to flow therefrom
will secure speedily approval and legisla
tive sanction of the States concerned.

NEW YOKK, Deo. B. —At a meeting of
the Committee of Commerce yesterday, A.
A. Low submitted a letter from Olyphant
& Co., of China, regarding the outrages
comtnited on Chinaman ut Los Angeles,
California, with extracts from certaiu
newspapers on the same subject. They
suggested that such outrages will tend to
render the lives and property of all Amer
icans in China unsafe.
Low hoped tho Chamber of Commerce
would take action on the matter. The
Chinese in California have been subjected
fr.ni the first to uttacts from the lower
classes. In that State there is antagonism
between the labor of Chinaman and whites,
and this letter sets forth the danger that
constantly begets the Chinese. Hethought
it worthy of action on the part of our Gov

in its treatment of these people way be
sustained. The letter and accompanying
newspaper accounts were referred to a
