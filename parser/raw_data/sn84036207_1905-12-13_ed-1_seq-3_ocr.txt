Extremely Weighty—Must Define
Term "Labor"—Insist Upon Most Fa
vored Treatment of Chinese in U. S.
At a meeting of the boycott commit
tee of the Chinese guilds and Ameri

ALIENS TO THIS SIDE
COMMISSIONER'S ANNUAL REPORT
SHOWS 1,026,499.
Over Two Hundred Thousand More
Than Last Year—Pacific Ports Show
Decrease—On Account of Jap-Russo
Wa r—Slavs and Huns Most Promi
nent—Fewer From Germany.
In presenting the annual report of
the bureau of immigration. Commis
sioner General Sargent refers to the
magnitude and gravity of the problems
presented by the growth of the alien
population of tne United States.
"These problems," he declared
"loom so largely in the prospect of our
country that it may be said without
giving just cause to charge exaggera
ion, that all other questions of public
economy relating to things rather than
to human beings, shrink into compara
ive insignificance."
The total alien arrivals reported for
the year of 1,026.499 represents an in
crease over the preceding year of 213,
629, of which the continental ports of
the United States report an increase of
196,940, as compared with arrivals last
year, and Canadian ports 13.830. At the
insular ports the increase was 2S49.
although the arrivals at Porto Rico
were less by 94 than in 1904. There
also was a large increase in arrivals at
southern ports, while a decrease is
shown for the Pacific ports, which is
accounted for in some measure by the
Russian-.Tapanese war.
Of the increased arrivals above re
ferred to. Austria-Hungary sent 98,537
over its quota of 1904, Russia 39,756,
Italy 28,183, and the United Kingdom
49,544. This increase from the last
mentioned country, says the commis
sioner, is somewhat offset by the de
crease from Germany, Switzerland and
Sweden. Notwithstanding the increase
from Italy, that country, says the com
missioner. may be regarded as having
probably reached the high water mark.
From this showing, Commissioner Sar
gent ventures the prediction that the
chief source of future increases in im
migration are those two in Europe
which have the greatest resources in
population, probably, to dispense with
-—Russia and Austria-Hungaria.

PREDICT DOOM OF BUREAUCRACY
"Quo Vadis" Author Fears Germans
May Absorb Poland.
Stockholm.—The Associated Press
correspondent recently had an inter
view with Henryk Sienkiewicz (author
of "Quo Vadis" and other well known
books) prior to his receiving the Nobel
prize for literature. The novelist said:
"1 have not been in Poland for three
weeks. The situation in Russia and in
Poland is extremely bad. The bureau
cracy can not last much longer with or
without revolution, its days are count
ed. The Russian people are good, but
the bureaucracy are a set of thieves.
That was proved by the war. Count
Witte's position is most difficult. Witte
is ciever and of great ability, but it
is doubtful if he will be able to retain
u.a pusuion.
"We are in the greatest danger as
Poles, and a German occupation of
Poland is possible if tnis revolutionary
movement gets beyond the control of
the Russian government. Perhaps such
occupation would be by consent of the
Rusaian government and perhaps not.
However, if the Russian government
should acquiesce in the occupation of
Russian Poland in whole or in part by
Germany the act would be resisted not
only in Poland, but in Russia.
