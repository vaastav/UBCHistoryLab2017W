How The President's Message Was
Eeceived.
Report of Tlie Secretary of Tlie Treasnry
Railroad Collision Other
Notts of News.
Washington, Dec 3. Long before
the bcrar of meeting of the second
session of the fiftieth coDgress the
public galleries were filled with spec
tators. On the floor hand shaking
was indulged in and congratulations
on reelection or condolences on de
feat were exchanged among the mem
bers. Jocose raillery on the part of
Republicans, patient resignation on
the part of Democrats, was every
where evident. Both houses have
taken a reces3, the house at 12 SO for
one hour, and the senate at 12:47 for
half an hour. Republican members
who are prominently mentioned in
connection with the speakership
came in for an extra share of felicita
tions, it being generally conceded on
the floor that the next house will be
Republican, with from three to seven
majority.
When Randall entered the cham
ber, which he did at a few moments
beforo neon, he was surrounded by
his friends, desirous of expressing
their pleasure at seeing him once
more resume his congressionalduties.
At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of
the gavel stilled the tumult which ex
isted in the kail, and silence reigned
while the chaplain offered a prayer.
The roll of membership was then
called, and the hum of conversation
broke out afresh.
During the progress of the call of
members, president Cleveland en
tered the executive gallery and be
came an attentive spectetor. The
call developed the presence of twenty
three members, there being eighty
eight absentees.
THE SENATE.
It was an uunsnally full senate that
responded to president pro tern In
galls' call to order at 12 o'clock to
day. At that time all the galleries
were fall except the president s and
the diplomatic department, as the
minute hand overtook the hour indi
cator on the dial of the clock, Ingalls
let fall his gavel and chaplain Butler
opened tlie proceedings witn prayer.
A few moments were spent in greet
ing senators, and then senator Sher
man offered the usual resolution that
the secretary notify the house thnt
the senate is ready to proceed to
business.
MOSUL'S CLAIM BECOQNIZED.
Washington, Dec. 3. The court of

island certificates to Chinese immi
grants to the United States, etc., col
lected in official capacity for which
the accounting officers of the treasury
refused to allow him credit.

They aggregate $323,407,483, which
is S382,305 less thau the estimates for

nual appropriations, $10S,G91.005; to
tal, $323,467,488.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSMiC.
Washington, Dec. 3. That por
tion of the message in whidi the
president treats of the tariff question
was listened to attentively. U mem
bers of both sides of tin- house.
Now and then n smile moio of tri
umph than derision would nppear
upon the face of come i-ntlinsinstic
Republican, but the silence was not
broken until the clerk rend in a clear
voice, "cause for which battle is
waged, and is comprised witbin Hues
clearly and distinctly defined, it
should never be compromised. It is
the people's cause." Then the Dem
ocrats conld no longer restrain their
feelings and broke into rounds of ap
plause, which was answered by Re
publicans with derisive laughter.
AN ANAEOniST ABSENTED.
Vienna, Dec. 3. An anarchist has
been arrested at Vienna while on bis
way from Rome, to Trieste, upon sus
picion of having designs upon the
life of Emperor .Francis Joseph.
A BUMOB OP STANLEY.
Liverpool, Dec. 3. Mail advices
from the west coast of Africa say, "a
rumor has reached Bonny, from the
upper Niger, that Henry Stanley is
proceeding at the back of great oil
rivers under the British flag, and that
the natives are friendly.
AN UNFOUNDED REPORT.
Boston. Dec. 3. The Pilot's Rome
cable denies the truth of the report
that the Pope has directed Cardinal
Gibbons to convey tho people's con
gratulations to President Harrison on
his election, on the ground that Cath
olic interests will bo safe in his
band?.
rotm men'killed.
Merriton, Dec 3. A coal train
ran into an engine this morning and
fireman Michel Sherry, engineer Jas.
Williams, and brakeman Allen, of the'
coal train, were killed. It is said
that the body of n tramp who was
stealing a ride, is in the debris.
PANAMA CANAL STOCK.
Paris, Dec 3. Panama canal
shares are quoted this afternoon at
183 francs and 75 centimes.
WASHINGTON NOTES.
Washington, Dec. 2. Washing
ton merchants are bewailing the sor
ry prospect of business this winter.
They say that all the Democratic of
fice holders will go to hoarding their
earnings in fear of the rainy day that
may come almost any time after the
4th of March. This affects every
class of business except food sellers.
The same state of affairs existed, only
in a more marked degree, just before
and just after Mr. Cleveland's inaug
uration. Tho only enterprises tbat
seem to prosper conspicuously at
present are the suburban real estate
schemes. Nothing cools that crrzj.
Mr. Harrison will be called upon to
fill, during his term of office, a great
many vacancies in the army. On
May 28, 18S9, adjutant general Drum
will be retired, and later in the same
year paymaster general Rochester,
quartermaster general Holabird, and
commissary general McFeeley will
follow. Surgeon general Moore will
be retired in 1890, and chief of engin
eers Benet's time comes in June. 191.
Several brigadier generals will also
leave active service, with colonels ga
lore. In tho navy a great many re
tirements will occur, The amount of
currying for favor that will be done
by the eminent military candidates
for there positions, will be something
pleasantly exhilerating to behold next
season.
Tbero must be something radically
wrong about the treatment which the
private in the United States army re
cieves. The annual teport of tho
adjutant-general to tho commanding
general of the army states that the
number of desertions from the nrtny
for the past year was 2,430. When
the fact is considered that the entire
number of enlisted men in the army
has not averaged during thnt time
over 23,200 men, it will be seen what
an enormous percentage more than
one in each ten the deserters repre
sent. Army officers have for jears
been trying, or pretending to try, to
discover a preventative for the deser
tions from the army, which is getting
more nnmerous every year. They
have failed. Why isn't it now in
order for a congressional committee
to try its hand?
Secretary of war Endicott, in his
report, says that "from investigations
recently made it appears tbat 80 per
cent of the desertions occur before
the expiration of tho second year of
service.'' In discussing various plans
suggested to prevent desertions, the
secretary says: "It is worthy of con
sideration whether the officers in
command of troops at military posts
or captains of companies should not
be authorized to impose punishment
for a minor offense. But in granting
snen authority it will be necessary to
specify the extent and character of
the punishment for each offense,
otherwise there would be no uniform
rule, nor would it be wise to repose
so large discretion upon a single of
ficer." Preparations already on foot for
the 4th of March ceremonies indicate
that the inauguration of Gen. Harri
son will be a very imposing one.
There will be no lack of money to
carry out whatever programme may
be formulated. It is a matter of
pride with Washingtonians to make
each inaugural event excel its prede
cessor, and for the time being feel
ings of partisanship and prejudice are
suspended and Democrats and Re
publicans work together harmoni
ously. Advice to llnli.ii:ils.
If you have a wife who does keep
her house in order, is not constantly
at war with her servants and is not
extravagant, has meals recularlv and
well served, and does her best to
please, let her see you appreciate her;
otucrwise sue win cease to try and
make your home comfortable, and in
due course your troubles at home will
be innmtely worse tlian nny you may
nave at yonr onice.
When your liver is out of order re
member food cannot be palatable;
mereiore, uo not grumble ami turn
over on yonr plate what vonr wife bas
provided for you as if it were not lit
for a dog to eat.
Bo punctual at meals. Remember
tliat a cook cannot keep dinner wait
ing without its being spoiled. Do
not expect eacu servant to have two
pairs of hands.
Dress as well and as neatlv as vour
means will allow and be careful not
to get your best tronsers wet, as bag
gy knees aro a thing no woman can
respect.
Always come homo good tempered,
leaving business cares behind, and do
not vent annoyances met with at the
office on your wife and family.
Be as kind and attentive to your
wife ai yon were before your mar
riage, and remember she has got no
pipe to go to for comfort.
Make yourself agreeable to your
wife and friends and do not sit glnm
all the evening, looking utterly bored.
Be lenient to your wife s faults and
do not expect perfection until yon
nave lirst become perfect yourself.
