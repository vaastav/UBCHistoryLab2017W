: 'l'heit! is veiy lit t e comparison In gojii
looks between the shirt waist of 'summer
and the 'one or' winter,' for. the latter so
. l'nr outdistances ttitj former that it were
unwise to look' at the two in the euma
day or. by ; tire same -light. The' summer
ehirt waist was a iltile wusli. thing, some- '<
thing- to : be picked up, put on, worn a
day and thrown aside for the tub. The
winter shirt waist is something that is not
to be tubbed,. but to be worn delicately,
wisely und well, and to be enjoyed as a
staple and- conventional feature of dress.
■ .Yet there are winter shirt waists that
can be tubbed. The new flannel waists,
made, with ; tucked yokes and plain. bust,
with buttons down the back, are titted for
washing, provided the colors be of; the
Hurt that do not fade. ; These waists are
made without lining; there being the
veriest shell of a lining from the stock
downward toward the bust, but terminat
ing Just at the yoke.
Kven the' Bleeve3 of, these waists aro
unlined and the cuffs are stiffened with
material that will - not shrink, usually
with another thickness of tlannel, stitched
along the edges.

tlannel and in the outing wools. It is

Inclines toward the tucked front* and
back, und it is buttoned down the back.
Those who do'not fancy the back but
tons can make the waist wlthsilver but
tons extending from the throat to the
belt. The waist has a few side plaits for
fullness just at each side of the throat.
and at the waist these plaits are again
laid with neat precision. There Is no other
trimming down the front, for the elegance
of this waist depends wholly upon the
general set of the collar, the way the
sleeves are put in, the : trlmness of the
back and' the squareness of the coat
tslpeve shoulder. A waist properly fitted
on these lines is called the Kngliah waist,
lor it is the accepted one abroad.
But it is in the trimmed waists that the

modes and upon this fancy shirt waist
one expends one's .admiration, for it is u
thing'of much beauty.
A shirt waist, to tell of the handsomest
first, was made of panne silk, very soft
nnd very velvety upon tho surface. Its
color was the dearest rose, such a delicata
shade. The yoke, for It had u deep yoke
front and, buck, showed a covering of net
lace upon when' there, was a litlo silk cm
broidery. To the yoke hung a. deep fall
of lace. •- ■ .. • .
The upper part of the sleeves and th*
upper part of the waist were made of tha
pink* panne silk with u little figure in it,
all Htudded with, the tiniest steel nail
heuds. Around the elbows there was i\
band of chinchillu with a deep fall of side
reaching ulmost to the wrists.
The belt wag a very deep band of white
satin ribbon studded with steel and fas.
tened at the back, with three little buc
kles of eteel and rhinestones. Over this
belt fell a putting of plain pink panne silk.
to look like a blouse. The stock was of
pink velvet and lace.
Such u waist, worn, by |Mrs. Clareivo
Mackay, was one of the loveliest at a
matinee party, and owing to its high neck
and long sleeves It was wholly appropri
ate for the occasion and for the tea which
followed the theater. No hat was worn
with this shirt waist, but a little shouLier
cape* with a hood that came up over liiu
hair. The skirt was u plain black sain
one, trimmed with a deep flounce of k> • t
lace with a little pink velvet laid unlor
the lace as a heading.
The Waist and Skirt.
The ehirt waist, while differing from the
skirt, matches it In many ways. It bears
a family resemblance to it in color und
often in general style, though rarely in
texture.
In these days of choux the matter of
color can always be arranged, and it ta
a simple thing to get color results from
the judicious use of ribbon and roses.
Upon tne shirt waists there. are choux.
and few are the dressy waists that do not
show from one to three of them. These
are made up In materials light or materi
als heavy; in ribbon,, in chiffon or in vel
vet, and in the hearts ot the handsomest
ones there nestles the fashionable rtM*.
Surely there was never a season when
the artificial rose was one-half as much
sought after nor a season when it was
used In more ways. The newest chou
sets show the rose nestling In the middle
of the chou, and besides they show a ro*e
dangling from the chou until It hangs at
the end of a ribbon. - A chou that wua
