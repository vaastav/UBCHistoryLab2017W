August 14, Magers, who was at
that time a paroled convict, at
tempted a brutal assault upon Miss
Beulah Walton, who was riding along
the road about a mile from est ba
lem. He was frightened away by an
approaching wagon, and very shortly
afterward .attempted another assault
upon Mrs. M. Jorgenson, whom he
found alone on the Eola road. For
tunately an automobile rounded the
corner and he fled. The chase was
taken up by the occupants of the ma
chine and Magers escaped by swim

he came very near being lynched by
a mob. He was later brought to Dal
las and confined in the county jail,
from which he attempted to escape
several times.

The grand jury began its investi
gations Friday, and by Saturday af

Program Includes Addresses by State
Superintendent Alderman and
President Ackerman of State Nor
malState Health Officer to Speak
on School Sanitation.
The animal convention of the
School Officers' Association of Polk
county is to be held in this city next
Saturday, and will undoubtedly be
the most successful gathering of the
kind that has ever been attempted
here. The officers of the association
have arranged an excellent program
and they expect every district in the
entire county to be represented, and
provision will be made for entertain
ing not less than 200 delegates. A
banquet will be tendered the visitors
by the Dallas Commercial Club at the
Hotel Gail at 11:30 a. m.
The following is the program pre
pared for the convention, beginning
at 10 a. m.:
Program.
Address State Superintendent L.
R. Alderman.
"What the School Board Owes the
School" John Simkins, Spring Val
ley School.
Discussion, led by G. W. Meyer.
Address " Sanitary Conditions of
the School," Dr. Calvin S. White,
State Board of Health.
"Standard School" II. C. Sey
mour. "How Can We Improve Our
Schools?" R. O. Dodson, Elkins
School.
Discussion. led by George Wells.
Address President J. H. Acker
man, Oregon Normal School.
T. W. Brunk, president, and Su
perintendent II. C. Seymour, secre
tary, of the association, who have
been looking after the preliminaries
of the approaching meeting, believe
that it will be one of the roost im
portant events in the school affairs of
the county. In a circular letter
which they are sending out to each
school officer of Polk, they have this
to say:
Attendance Urged.
"The chairman of the school board
of each district is the regular dele
gate and receives $2 for attending,
but if the chairman should not be
able to attend, be should see that
some member of the school board is
present, and if possible every mem
ber should attend.
"We are hoping to make this the
greatest school officers' convention
l.vj v tf this vear. Pok
! County is the Blue Ribbon County
and if every school officer will do his
best to attend this convention we
can make this the Blue Ribbon Con
vention of the State.
"Every school director and cleric
should attend. You have your faH
'work completed; take one day off and
!he!p to boost the sthool conditions
'of the eounty." m

ROAD TO GET READY FOR

SHORT NOTICE.
ONLY MONTH'S TIME NEEDED
Threatened Invasion of Hill Inter
ests in Willamette Valley Gives
Dallas a Chance to Get On the
Rapid Transit Electric Map to
Portland in Near Future.
Electrification of the Fourth-street
line ns far south as Corvallis isTi step
that now is forcing itself on the
Southern Pacific interests regardless
of the city's demands, says the Ore-
gonian. Competition of the Oregon
Electric line has brought the South
ern Pacific to a position where the
change from steam to electric service
is becoming a stern necessity. Even
had the city not ordered electrifica
tion, it is probable that this step
would be under consideration at this
time anyway.
In fact, the Southern Pacific is in a
position now to substitute electricity
for steam in less than a month's no
tice in case of emergency. Within the
last summer almost the entire line be
tween Portland and Newberg was re
ballasted and repaired. New and
heavier steel was installed, and in
most cases the rails were "bonded"
that is, connected with wire, to per
mit the electric current to follow
them. All that remains to be done
now is the overhead wiring.
Current Contract Made.
The Southern Pacific has a con
tract with the Portland Railway,
Light & Power Company providing
for the delivery of all the electric en
ergy required to serve the Fourth
street line. The contract gives the
Southern Pacific the privilege of call
ing for this power as early as Janu
ary, 1912, if it is reeded, but does
not stipulate that service shall begin
at that time. The Portland Railway,
Light & Power Company must be
ready to furnish power at any time
after January 1, 1912, that the
Southern Pacific demands it.
In laying its plans for the electrifi
cation of the Fourth-street line, the
Harriman interests are not seeking
merely to obey the mandates of the
Portland City Council, but to fortify
themselves in the struggle for busi
ness in the Willamette Valley for
many years in the future.
They are confronted with the most
vigorous kind of opposition through
the Oregon Electric, a Hill road, that
now is pushing south from Salem to
Eugene as fast as a large force of
men, horse, tools and machinery will
permit The completion of this line
will give the Hill interests entrance
to a portion of the state that hereto
fore has remained the undisputed
territory of the Harriman system.
Hotel Opening.
Tbe Dallas Hotel, of which Henry
Mascot t is proprietor, will be form
ally opened Sunday, December 10,
with an elaborate 50 cent dinner.
The building has been completely
renovated and thoroughly refarnish-
