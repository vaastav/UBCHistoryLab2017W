A brakeman on the railroad had

Christmas is just two weeks off
from next Tuesday. From what
we can see at present it bids fair to
be a very dull one for almost ev
erybody. The scarcity of money
and low price of cotton have de
moralized people.
The railroad company began on
Tuesday last the erection of a new
depot, to replace the old one de
stroyed by fire some time ago.
This move should have been made
some time ago, for the traveling
public has no doubt been put to a
great deal of trouble and inconven
ience by the bad accomodations
since the destruction of the old
building.
Senator Newton C. Blanchard
has introduced a bill in the Senate
of the United States, that, if pass
ed and signed, will give to the
Louisiana sugar planters the boun
ty for 1894. It is to be hoped
that the bill will pass through
Congress without any hitch or de
lay, for the United States really
owes the planters, and it should
discharge itself of an honest debt. j
Reuben F. Kolb, the notorious
Alabama politician, who has run
for Governor of that State for the
past three elections aud been de
feated each time, went through the
formality of being sworn in on in
auguration day last Monday, when 0
the Governor-elect, W. C. Oates, i
took the oath of office and assumed t
the responsibilities of the office. p
Kolb, however, persists in saying
that he is the Governor; that he
is the choice of the people, and
that he was defrauded out of the
office. But, then, anyone who is $
acquainted with 2 'abama politics
knows that Kolb is a political gas- n
bag and is only blowing to hear him i%
self talk, and to attract public at
tention, and thereby gain a little
potoriety. t

The regular annual election ol

No. 19, F. & A. M., was held in the

t A PROMPT SETTLEMENT.
The New York Life Insurance
Co. paid on Dec. 3d the sum of $10,
- 000 to the widow of the late Ben
Meginley, under the policy taken
out by him last January, only ten
- months ago. Considering that the
proofs of death only reached the
home office of the company in New
York on Nov. 24th, this is pretty
prompt settlement, and evidences
not only the liberality of the com
1 pany, but the security of the poli
1 cies which it issues. Mr. M. M.
Kohlman, the special agent of the
company who paid the money ov
er to Mrs. Meginley, is at La
combe's hotel for a few days, and
will be glad to meet any residents
of the parish who desire to avail
themselves of the protection that
only life insurance offers.
The second session of the Fifty
third Congress of the United States
convened in Washington City last
Monday, with both Houses having
a quorum. After the reading of
the President's message a little
minor business was transacted and
both Houses adjourned for the
(lay. The message, except in a few
points, was devoid of any interest.
It was a lengthy document, and
treated of various subjects. The
only local issues treated of that
would attract much attention was
the advising of the President to
place coal and iron on the free list,
and a revision in the banking and
currency laws.
As will be seen in our corres
pondence from Big Cane, published
in another column of this issue, a
sad and much-to-be-regretted acci
dent occurred at that place last
Saturday, which resulted in the
death of Mr. John Haw. Mr. Haw
and Mr. Hardin Hebert were hunt
ing together, when, as the letter
will explain, Mr. Hebert's gun ex
ploded accidentally, and the charge
of shot entered Mr. Haw's head,
causing a wound from which he
Numa Dudoussat, one of the
crooked New Orleans councilmen,
v after being on trial in the criminal
court of that city for some time
past, was convicted last Wednes
Â© day on the charge of receiving a
bribe of $100. This makes the se
1 cond conviction on the same charge
in that city of late, and the remain
ing indicted councilmen can well
tremble in their boots at the
"rocky" prospect that stares them
in the face.
The approach of the Christmas
holidays has served to enliven
things a little. Some of our mer
chants are getting in quite a stock
of goods and novelties, while others
say that they will not carry any
larger stock than they now have,
as the "times are too hard."
The usual fall term of the Civil
District Court met in the court
house last Monday, with Judge
Perrault presiding. The first day's
session attracted many visitors to
town. The Grand Jury is also in
session.
J. B. Sandoz has the best quality

note this initial step towards its
consummation.

BRYANT AS AN EDITOR.
He Fought Fairly and He Respected '(
His Adversary.
In 1825 Bryant gave up the law
finally, resolved to earn his living by
his pen. He removed to New York,
where he was to reside for the next
fifty years. He was appointed ed
itor of the New York Review, to
which he contributed many poems,
among them that beginning with
the well-known line:
'The melancholy days have come, the saddest
of the year."
One of the poems by other authors
which he published in the pages of
the New York Review was the
"Marco Bozzaris" of Fitz-Greene
Halleck. But the Review did not
prosper. Before it ceased Bryant
became an editorial writer on the
Evening Post. In 1829 the editor
in chief died, and Bryant was pro
moted to his place. He already
owned one-eighth of the paper, and
he was now enabled to increase his
holding to one-half. This share he
retained to his death, and it became
increasingly profitable as the years
went by. For the last half of his
long life Bryant had an assured in
come from property in his own con
trol. He had to work hard, but he
was his own master. In his editor
ial writings, as in his poetry, the
tone is always full of dignity. Calm
in his strength, he was both temper
ate in expressing his opinions and
good-tempered. He foEt fairly,
and he respected his adversary. He >5
was never a snarling critic, either of
men or of measures. He elevated
the level of theAmerican newspaper,
but it was by his practice, not by
preaching. He was choice in his
own use of words, and there was in
the office of the Evening Post a list
of words and phrases not allowed in
its pages.
The editorial articles which Bry
ant wrote for his paper day by day
for more than fifty years have never
been collected, and probably they
never will be, though they are a his
tory of the United States for almost
half a century. The letters written
to the Evening Post, when he. was
on his travels, have most of them
been reprinted. - Brander Mat

Traveling Mountains.
Changes in the topography of the
country may occur from causes but
little appreciated by casual ob
servers. Water courser are stopped,
lakes and bayous are formed and
whole counties may be submerged
by the moving of immense bodies of
land that gradually slide down into
waterways and stop their outflow.
An instance of this sort is found at.
the cascades of the Columbia river.
A mountain of basalt more than
eight miles long and two thousand
feet high is slowly sliding Into
the river, and, unless it meets with.
some natural obstacle, will in time
fill the riverbed and formsa dam by
which an dn ,mense body ,of waterr
will be held back in a grea...t ak
Civil engineers and scientists are
wondering how the channel is to be
kept open, and, as. it will be mant-'f
years before any encroachment in
terfering with navigation occurs,
there is ample room for study
and conjecture. The most plausible
reason given for this downward sli:
ing of mountains is that there nty
be a substratum of soft sandstone or
clay. This is continually g dis
solved and washed away'y the
strong current, and thus there is
gradual settling of the mass above;
or the tremendous weight of he
mountain may crush andgrinduje
rock, acting in precisely The sahe
manner as traveling glaciers.-N.
