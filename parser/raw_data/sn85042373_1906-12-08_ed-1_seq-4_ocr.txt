vatlng, as well as the luxurious fads
and fancies. Indeed, there may be
some danger of their treating agri
culture too much as a fad. There is
need of and there is profit in the high
est, deepest and broadest possible ed
ucation for the farmer, but there is
nobody who can so well afford to es
chew visionary fads and speculations.
The science of agriculture is as truly
a science as any with which the
learned world is concerned, but it is
pre-eminently a cautious, conservative
and practical science.
Nor may it be amiss to note, not to
our national credit, that, apparently
because of those very qualities of ne
cessity, agriculture has not always re*
ceived the encouragement and aid
which have been given by the nation
to Borne other industries. Manufac
tures and commerce have been objects
of paternal solicitude, of stimulation
and of protection, while agriculture
has more largely been left to "hoe its
own: row" and to depend upon natural
advantages. It .was well to do what
was done for those others and it
would be welt if a generous measure
of the same solicitude were exercised
though perhaps in different ways,
toward this greatest of all our indus
tries. There can be no more au
spicious sign of the times than for ag
riculture to receive from the nation as
well as from persons in their individ
ual capacities an attention propor
tionate to Its magnitude and its im
portance.
POLITICAL DEMAGO0RY.
President Roosevelt in his annual
message to congress did more than
point out the legislation which is
needed by the country at this time.
He successfully wielded the big stick
at the heads of those so-called reform
ers who attempt to w:n success by
hysterical plays to the galleries. Dis
cussing this matter he said:
The sinister demagogues and fool
ish visionaries who are always eager
to undertake such a campaign of des
truction sometimes seek to associate
themselves with thuse working for a
genuine reform in governmental and
social methods, and sometimes mas
querade as such reformers.
Moreover, while such preaching
and such agitation may give a certain
notoriety to some of those who take
part in it, and may result ia tie tem
porary political success of others, is
the long run every such movement
"will either fall or else will provoke a
violent reaction, which will itself re
sult not merely in undoing the mis
chief wrought by the demagogue and
the agitator, but also in undoing the
good that the honest reformer, the
true upholder of popular rights, has
painfully and laboriously achieved.
Corruption is never so rife as in
communities where the demagogue
and the agitator bear full sway, be
cause in such communities all moral
bands become loosenend, and hysteria
and sensationalism replace the spirit
of sound Judgment and fair dealing
as between man and man.
Roosevelt is hot a demogogtfe not
can he be charged with insincerity.
The American people know him too
well- to believe that he used these
words idly to fill space in a .mes
sage which he well knew would be
come a part of our national history
and would be read and pondered by
his fellow men a century hence. There
can be no doubt but that he meant
every word which was uttered and
weighed well its import before he
used it.
The truth is Just as he pointed out
in his message, that no reform has
ever been accomplished through the
instrumentality of agitators. Neither
do reforms among free people come
in the character of revolution. When
the first concession of liberty was
wrested from King John at Runny
mede, it was not the work of a day
nor of a year. For a long time the
matter had geen growing and when
the opportune time arrived there was
nothing left for a reluctant king to do
but grant the demands of the barons.
The accomplishment of our indepen
dence was another illustration of the
same principle. The foundations of
our liberty were laid long be
fore the common at Lexington was
drenched with the blood of the first
dead patriots. The French revolution
might be taken as the illustration of
demagogury and fanaticism in the af
fairs of mankind rather than the evo
lution. Fanaticism took the place of
judgment and frenzy the place of pa
triotic courage. The guillotine was the
supreme court of the land and the
streets of Paris and (the vine-clad
vales of France ran red with the
blood of the innocent. That condition
was the result of the work of dema
gogues of the same kind as those to
whom the president refers in his mes­
sage, and the danger to the free in
stitutions of this country from this
source are Just as great as they were
to France more than a century ago.
These waves of fanaticism may re
act and in doing so leave the country
where it was before, but tho more
probable thing is that once the discon
tent with the exist'.ng order of thtngs
is created it will smoulder and remain
suppressed, but in time will burst
forth with renewed energy and bring
a greater destruction.
Minot is endeavoring to secure a
state normal school, and it is not
among the impossibilities that it will
be successful. That the western
portion of the state should have some
educational institution cannot be dis
puted. The larger part of the popu
lation is in the western half, and
while the slope has the reform school
and the penitentiary it is a regretta
ble fact that they are used as much
by the people from the eastern coun
ties as they are by those from the
west. The education of the young
people of the state is the most import
ant part of its responsibility to Us
citizens. Especially is this true of
those who are to become the teachers
of the rising generation. That occu
pation is no longer considered a prop
er means of earning money during the
period "when the teacher is experi
menting. They are now expected, and
in fact required, to be qualified for
the work of developing the intellect
by understanding its nature and
needs. In a word the teachers must
be qualified to do scientific teaching.
This qualification can only be se
cured through the medium of the nor
mal schools and the more of them the
state has, the better will it be pre
pared to fulfill the obligation of the
commonwealth to the children. The
state needs another normal school
and Minot deserves the advantage of
the location more than any other
town in the state.
It is to be hoped that the legisla
ture will forget politics long enough
to consider and pass a road law for
the state providing for the construc
tion of high grade public ways leading
to the principal cities. This matter
has been discussed before in these
columns and it has been pointed out
that the construction ot good roads
from the agricultural sections into
the larger towns serves to increase
the importance of the towns and at the
same time to save expenses for the
farmers who are enabled to reduce the
cost of marketing their products be
cause of the improved conditions in
the roads. It is true that the frozen
condition of the roads in winter and
the solid condition during the greater
part of the summer limits the time in
which the roads need special atten
tion. But that time is in the fall—
during the wet season—when the farm
ers must use the roads most for the
marketing of their grain. In some
parts of the state the roads are so
bad during this time that the crops
cannot be marketed over them. Min
nesota has met the condition to some
extent by providing for the construc
tion of certain roads according to
modern systems in different parts of
the state. The only defect is that
there is no provision for uniting the
several sections into a general sys
tem. A similar law with this change
would be a good thing for this state,
leaving its adoption a matter of local
option, so that it need not be en
forced in the newer parts of the state
until they were sufficiently settled.
It is decidedly amusing to see the
democratic Alex. McKinzie trying to
get the democrats of the state to leave
Governor Burke well alone so far as
urging appointments upon him is con
cerned and then see the political War-

The institution of gift giving of former years was characterized by a giving of things
that appealed to the eye.
Today a change has come over the spirit of the custom and if a gift merely suggests
sentiment it serves only half its purpose.
Demand that the gift shall possess some practical as well as pretty qualities then it
will not only define your taste but will be a gift in the real sense of the word. Such
gifts will be doubly appreciated. They represent the thoughtfulness of the giver and at
the same time add to the comfort and happiness of the receiver. Such are the
