No ono will pretend that whero

tiat m this world all men play at tho
kmo of fortune; that tho winning
pkots aro fow, whilo tho blanks aro
lany, and that tho rich man can do
btlnng better than to build palaces,
tho building and furnishing of

Throughout tho oast tho anti-
monopoly movement is gathering
trength, as oaoh daj reveals some
now onormity on the part of corpor
ations as against the people. In our
eastern exchangos wo learn that some
prominent merchants of St. Louis aro
oraranizinfr in behalf of a movement
that must soon becomo gcnoral.
They' proposo a freight bureau lor
tho purpose of influencing railroad
companies in the matter of cheap and
uniform rates. Let tho companios

and tho democratio paity will tuko
the broad ground for tho rights of
tho mass against tho tyranny
of tho few. Thero is room for
but ono great monoply in this
country, and that is a monopoly
whose main business it shall be to
establish justico and fair play. In a
short timo tlfo pooplo of this terri
tory, and in faot tho great southwest,
will mako similar demands, and tho
peoplo will look to but ono party for
relief tho democratic
Any ono who has traveled much
in Arizona has bcon at times con
sidorably disturbed by the yelping,
whining, and when darkness covers
all with its protecting shield, thosav
,ago barking of tho thieving, cowardly
coyote. Ordinarly, little or no atten
tion is paid to this mostcontomptihle
and worthless of animals It is con
sidered a common nuisance, and is
not interfered with oxcopt, when era
boldenod by non-iutcrfcrcnce, it mis
takes tho contempt in which i is
held for fear and pokes its snes iing
nose within the boundaries of . the
camp and attempts to steal a bone or
a bit of bacon rind to appease its
ravonous appetite On su.h occa
sions a shout from a pai. of lusty
lungs or a random shot in the air
sonds tho midnight thief back into
tho darkness, whero, safo from
danger, it s.its on its lean and attenu
ated hauuehc snarling and howling
at its superiors. Too cowardly to
fight, too insignificant to pursue, it
roams, tho renegade of tho mesa,
despised by its own species and held
in abhorronco as tho synonym of all
that is vicious, low and despicable.
In Sunday's EriTAPii appeared a
plain, torso statement, to tho effect
that tho action of tho board of super
visors in publishing for proposals for
bids was done at the urgont advico
of thoir logal advisor, tho district
attorney. No respectable or honorable
man in this community doubted tho
truthfulness of tho Statomcnt, but a
morning contemporary says: "Wo
doubt tho statement, and will not be
prepared to believe it until Mr. Prico
corroborates it." When an honorable
man doubts tho statement of another,
ho does not call him a liar, as a black
guard would, but seeks tho authority
given for tho subject of his remarks,
aud from him ascertains its veracity.
This might have been dono without
any troublo or lnconvenince by the
manager or editor of tho paper re
ferred to had ho so desired. In
proof of this wo quc-io tho following
conversation with tho Hon. Lyttlcton
Prico, district attorney, with tho
editor of tho Epitaph: "ilr. Pnce,do
you yet adhero to your advico to tho
board of supoivisors, that their action
in advertising for proposals for bids
is legal?" Mr. Prico: "I most cer
tainly do. Without sueh an action on

dviSed tho board to pursue this
course last year, but they postponed
advertising for proposals until Jan
uary. True, thoy woro not much
loser, as a majority of tho old con
traits were ronowed; but had tho
contracts been given to other bid
deis, they would havo had to pay
dearly foi thoir negligence Tho
board of supervisor, of San Francis
co, aro now doing tho samo as this
bjaid,.and thoro is no law to tho
contrary, and I think they woj)d bo
remiss in their duties if they allowed
tho present contracts tooxpiro with
out advertising for now ones. The
incoming board will have to do tho
satin) in 1881, unless tho law is
oh niged or amended by tin) legisla
tuie, an-! tho board coming in in
1SS5 will stand in exactly the samo
pobitiun as tho incoming board of
1S83. 'It is as board as it is long.' "
i "Did anyone eonneotod with tho In-
Impendent aSK your opinion on this
subject?' "No, I mot M. Hamilton
on tho stroot, but ho did not speak,
merely nodded as wo passed each
other.""

and its progress chronicled in this

cratio, in tho other it is energetic anil
untiring in promoting tho interests
aud welfaro of Arizona, aud Cochise
county in particular. During the last
political campaign it made a vigor
ous and aggressive fight against its
opponents and nondescript rene
gades. It won the battle, aud with
out derisivo jeers or exultant cheers
it quietly resumed ,hc "even tenor
of its way," working ini a common
cause, for tho good of our country.
Had it lost, it would not have pleaded
with its victors for susteuanco; it
would not havo converted itself into
a oharity or contribution box, but
knowing it had battled in tho cause
of justico and right would havo
nailed its flag lo the masthead and
sunk with its party or sailed with
flying colors in tho opon sea of pros
perity, which now, owing to its
efforts, lies boforo it.
A VV.W ISSUES.
It is true that congress has not
been convened for any length of
time, but so far they appear to bo
laying on thoir oars. It looks as
though tho republicans have not ro
covoicd from tho surprise adminis
tered to them through tho last elec
tion, and tho democrats aro calmly
awaiting to claim judgment upon
some error which their opponents
may make. There aro some very live
issues which either party may con
sider without detriment to them
selves and much benefit to the people.
Among them we may mention that
tho government has too much spend
ing money, and too much of that sort
of thing invites corruption. The taxes
are so heavy that capital is embar
rassed and cannot be as generous
with labor as it would like. The
prices of tho necessaries of life aro
absurdly high, through tho rule of
the monopolists, notwithstanding the
fact that labor is cheap. 1 he monpo
lists control the market, and the taxes
control such small capitalists and
business men as havo not that power.
Small capital and largo work are
thereby embarrassed to the last do
grco, and this notwithstanding the
fact, as pointed out in tho president's
message and the accompanying docu
ments, that thero have been good
crops, largo business, and on the sur
face an apparent abundance of pros
perity. Too little attention has been
and is yot being paid to the growing
interests of tho territories especially
Arizona. We want increased mail
facilities, appropriations for the sur
yey of thousands of acros of public
land, appxopriions (or the sinking
of artesian wellL the culture of trees,
and above all, rRj passage of tho Re
gan railroad bill -eventing discrimin
ation in rates. These are a few points
which congress should take up with
out delay. There is not a man in the'
country who is not interested in
.them, and his family along with him.

which ho pays a merited rebuke to
our present system of reservations,
inferring that when the Indians are
closely pushed in Mexico they inva
riably take rofugo across tho border
in our reservations, thereby furnish
ing themsolves with a sure place of
safety. It is an establishad fact that
in caso of an uprisiug of tho savages
in this territory they, after committing
a series of depredations, cross the
lino either into Sonora or Chihuahua,
where they rob and murder tho peo
ple, ami when closely pursued again
rcoross the lino and mako for the res
ervations, where thoy aro clothed and
fed, putting them in shape for an
othor sortie. If we were to adopt
tho sjstem of shooting tho ringlead
ors of theso savage desporadoos as
soon as thoy returned from their trip
of rapine aud murder, in a short timo
thoy would becomo so thoroughly in
timidated aud subjected that thoy
would not mako many other excur
sions. The following,carofully condensed,
shows the opinions of tho leading pa-
pors regarding the president's lato
mossago: Herald: "An admirable,
clear and business-like stato paper."
Sun: "Made in the interest of honest
and economical government." World:
"Ho, Presidont Arthur, looks at pub
lic questions with the eyes of an in
telligent and public-spirited man; he
proposes to deal with them in tho
spirit of a time-serving politician."
Star: "Shows that ho has heard of
tho recent elections in the country
and understands thoir meaning." Tri
bune: "A creditable document. His
sentiments aro admirable. If he had
conducted his administration in ac
cordance with them the party would
not bo staggering under an adverse
majority of nearly 200,000. Ho has
always talked well." The Tribune

Tin: difficulty attending the pro
curing of a jury for the pending Stu
Routc trial is rather a sinking com
mentary on tho situation of afLdrs in
Washington. It is alleged that ic
putablo men, as a rule, aro unwilling
to servo because of tho unpleasant
prominenco it will give them and tho
suspicion it will place them under,
whilo tho avoragc haberdasher does
not want to servo because, whatever
the verdict may bo, his business is
likely to be hurt by it. If ho votes
for acquittal ho will lose trado, be
cause ho will bo regarded as bribed;
and if ho votes for conviction, ho will
be shunned by the numerous friends
of tho criminals, and be abuse 1 bo
sides by tho Star-Route newspapers.
Therefore, every Eort of oxeuso is
made Use of to escape serving. But
the jury is slowly being made up,
nevertheless, and confidence is ex
pressed that it will be an honest one.
If such is tho case, lln feat on the
part of the court will bo regarded as
something remarkable.
