THE SITUATION.
Affairs in the Army of the Potomac remain
unchanged. Our correspondent at headquarters
atatea, from reliable authority, that General Lee's
army occupies the following positions:?Hill's
corps is around Orange Court House, where General
Lee has his headquarters. Early's division is
near the Summerville Roads, at Morton's and Tobacco
Fords. Johnston's division is at Mitchell's,
Brown's and Germanna Fords. From the dense
volumes of smoke arising from the woods and
batteries south of Raccoon and Morton Fords it is
evident that tlic enemy arc also in force there.
Our latest dates from Charleston arc to the 8th,
and come from rebel sources. The despatches
state that on that morning a brisk tire between
Fort Moultrie and Battery Gregg was opened; that
our forces have ceased firing on Sumter, and are
altering their battelies and entrenching Gregg
eastward. One Monitor had timber work arouud
her sides to protect her from torpedoes.
Rebel despatches still further confirm the retreat
of General l.ongstreet from Knoxville, in
consequence, they say, of heavy reinforcements
received by General Burnsidc. The rebel forces
fell back to Morristown, where, it is said, they intended
to make u stand. Their loss at Knoxville is
admitted to be COO, principally in General Hood's
division.
Rebel accounts from Dalton, Ga., to the 8th say
that our cavalry at Ringgold were attacked by the
rebel cavalry on the day previous and driven a
mile beyond the town.
A numerous fleet is now on the track of the ,
Chesapeake which fell into the hands of the rebel
pirates. The Pt. John (New Brunswick) Globe
says that the scheme was concocted by rebel
agent* in t'mt city, and that the parties concerned i
were sent from there to Vew York, where they I
went on hoard the Chesapeake armed and ready to j
carry out their purpose, it is stated in St. John |
that the cargo of the steamer wae shipped hy rebel i
agents with the intention of seizing her and eon- j
veying her to the South. Vo evidence of this fn t, |
however, lias come to light. It appear?- that she I
took in no coal at St. John, but took cm hoard
Captain Parker, formerly of the privateer P. tiilm
tion, who took command of her. The Chesapeake ?
was reported to be near Cape Sable yesterday.
The flr-t instance in which tlm declaration ot
the President in hi? late pre Inmntion providing
for the pardon of dc'in p; line he? n exercised
ts in til?- ease of General F. W. tiannt, formerly of
the rebel army, but who, it will be remembered,
recently issued an address to the Southern people
from Little Rock. Arkansas, recanting Irs treasonable
doctrines and advocating a return to the
Union. The President lias extended to him n full
pardon, and returned to him all his rights of property,
except iu slave*, an exception w hi lithe
proLlamstion very rigidly provides tor.
General Rank* arrived at ,V? w Orleans with his
stall from Brazos, Texas, on tIn--Id inst. Then is
no further news concerning the expedition.

England has positively declined to take part in

is "conceived in very conciliatory and courteous
terms." Nevertheless it is stated that the Emperor
Alexander demands a preliminary "programme"
of the subjects which the congress is to discuss
and the powers which it is to exercise. The Loudon

sending a representative to the congress, unless
he is assured beforehand of the restitution of the

The President's Message and the Next
Presidency.
The art of riding two horses is not confined
to the circus. It has boen practised by politicians
from time imruomorial. It is an old trick
of tho trade in this country; but, where one
experimentalist has thus made a successful
run around the national course, a dozen hare
been thrown to the ground. Henry Clay, for
AVAmnln l.n/iu<v)il At f in 1 Qili. lit AttnAoSltAn i A
the annexation of Texas?was persuaded to write
a letter to Alabama in favor of the scheme, whereby,
in losing the vote of New York, he was defeated.
He was thrown by the abolition horse
in attempting to ride at the sama time the conservative
horse.
President Lincoln, on a much grander scale,
has for some time been riding two political
horsos, and, with the skill of an old campaigner,
he whips them?the radical horse "a leetle
ahead''?through bis Message and bis appeuded
proclamation of amnesty to the rebellious
States. During the last two or three years
he has given us some marvellous surprises
in bringing forward the radical horse
in front when it was supposed he bad been
hopelessly dropped behind. Thus, aftor removing
General Fremont, and after roundly
reprimanding General Hunter for dabbling in
emancipation proclamations, and after pronouncing
the thing as futile and foolish as "the
Pope's bull against the comet," our facetious
President astonished the country with an abolic<ypj>letely
cast into the
shade the sinafi experiments 0? Fronts and
Hunter. Again, after having peremptorily refused
to listen to the demands of the radicals
for the removal of Mr. Seward, and after having
excited their wrath and threats of vengeance in
the matter ol' the Kansas Missouri-muddle, ho
exalts them ia his Message to the seventh
heaven of Mahomet. Next to a good joke, it is
evident "Old Abe" is fond of a rousing sensation.
He will adhere to his proclamation: he will
never abandou it. He proposes to receive
back into the Union the rebellious States only
as free States. The radical horse loads the
way; but the conservative horse.is not yet
abandoned. Congress may restore the rebellious
States in the readmission of their repre- i
sentatives to the two housr s. Who knowB ?
And then the Supreme Court may decide
the emancipation proclamation as in
reality nothing better than 'the Popo's
bull against the comet.'' Conservatives,
behold the comfort reserved for you in tko Supreme
Court. Have not both wings of the
administration cauip abundant cause to rejoice?the
radicals in the sweeping abolition
programme and proclamation of the Message,
and the conservatives in the idea that all this
is only another tub to the abolition whale*
We think it must be confessed that the President
has done enough for each side to challenge
the support of both in the nominating
convention ol his parly.
Mr. Lincoln repudiates the abolition plan of
Sonator Sumner. Is not that something for
the conservatives? He winks, with a meaning
smile, at the restoration plan suggested by
the Secretary of State to the French government.
Is uot that encouraging? lie brings
forward bis owu plan of restoration; but did
he not, last year, bring forward his scheme of
gradual emancipation, whereby the work
would be consummated in the year 1900?
Think of that, oh! ye complaining conservatives,
and be consoled. Cut admitting that,
while the radicals have cause to rejoice, the
conservatives should be thankful, the cpiestion
recurs, lias President Lincoln cleared the track
for another nomination and anothei term in the
White House'
This is a very interesting problem, and difficult
of solution, svilb tbe lights before us.
There is tbe danger of a 1 iv;?I military hero iu
the administration camp. or as tbe champion of
tbe united opposition camp. Iu either case
such u military hero as Gcneial McClellan or
General Grant, for instance, with tbe army
and the soldiers" vote at his back, will be a
formidable competitor. Finally, President Lincoln
having proclaimed his platform for the
succession, tbe active work on all sides of Ihe
Presidential campaign begin-, and there may
soon appear such complications and combinations
in hi' way as to prove to Honest Old Abe
himself that nothing is more uncertain or more
subject to accident than tbe next Presidency.
The Treasury Report.
We publish this morning the elaborate report
of Secretary Chase on the Ominces of Ihe country.
This review presents the condition of tbe
monetary affairs of the nation in a much more
favorable light than tbe public have generally
imagined it would. It also gives us au idea of
the magnitude of the work that our government
has had on its bands, and shows bow well and
easily the country ba* borne the financial burthen
rendered necessary by ihe evonts of the
war. Tbe rebellion plunged us into one of tbe
most extensive wars ever engaged in by any
nation: but Ibe effect upon tbe country is nothing
when compared to that prodn< ed upon Mugland
by tbe wars of Napoleon Tbe debt incurred
by us will also be found to be much more
easily removed.
Our national debt at the present time is put
down in round number- at eleven liuri
<1 red millions of dollat* It in estimated tbat
on the 1*1 day of July, 18tif, it will reach
in round numbers about seventeen hundred
million?- It the wm should continue until the
1st of .Inly. 1 1 which doss not seem pos
sible wit!) an\ decent management?our debt,
according to present estimate*, will reach the
neighborhood of two thousand five hundred million",
or a little more than one half of the present
debt of England. The debt of the IJr'dish
government is now over four thousand mil'iions
it is true tbat it beats a sai ilb-r rate of i uteiest
than ours: but, counting it at the rate -of three
and a half per cent, she is paying an 'annual interest
of upwards of one hundred and forty
millions The expense* of the Kng if^b govern
ment are so great that it i* impossible for tier
even in time of peace to rty'juce her debt;
but. on the other hand, the inexorable logic of
fuel* idiowa that it must gradually increase.
,\r ?. I ig i > Hocrebvy Vliaae's . siimale, our
g.vcromeu. will hsv to pa/, at rate of
ECEMBER 11, 18C3.-TRrP:
' interest which the debt boars, eighty-five
; millions duriug the coming fiscal year.
! Siiould the war continue until the
1st of July, 18G5, and the debt be swollen
! to twenty-live hundred millions, our annual
! interest, even at present rates, will still be bo!
low that paid by England. The vast resources
i of this country, its bidden treasure and varied
1 wealth, which are from day to day being de|
veloped, will enable us to meet all this, and
ttie people will not feel tbe burthen one-half as
much as the subjects of England feel theirs
now. It will also enable us to rapidly reduce
our debt when the war is over.
What other nation of the world can present
such a record? llere we are engaged in a gigantic
civil war. We have been at work nearly
tbroo years in crushing out a robellion of an
extent and magnitude unknown to any other
nation in ancient or modern times, and yet the
burthen is hardly felt by the people. We shall
soon show to the world that we can crush out
the greatest rebellion of the world. And when
the war ends, and every State returns to the
family circle, we will add to the wonders the
astonishing feat of actually paying off our
enormous debt within the lifetime of tbe present
generation, thus furnishing au example
that no other nation san follow. Let tbe
growlers in our midst and the croakers in
Europe put this in their pipes and smoke it.
Tbey will find it an excellent remedy for their
agitated nerves.
The Proposed Baropesn Congnti-th*
Refusal of England to Attend.
By the arrival of the Etna we obtain two
days lator news from Europe. England has
positively refused to accede to Napoleou's proposed
Congress to discuss and arrange European
affairs. Austria and Prussia demand oxr
,.p it... Ev?n?t,
[iiauauvun ?viu mv u.upU.v. v. .vuvu v.v
they can accept his proposal. The course pursued
by England will doubtless influence other
European Powers, and we may look upon the
meeting of the Congress as highly improbable.
The French Emperor's project of a grand
council of European nationalities, for the purp&ftof
reVisiuj; and rearranging thepolttijaJ
map of that Continent, is a movement jpfegnnnt
with the most momentous issues, and
it is not a matter of surprise that the
existing govornraonts view it with equal alarm
and astonishment. They cannot fail to see
that it is a menaco upon exsting institutions.
It is palpable to all that the execution of
the plan would convert monarchical Europe
into a great federative republic, presided over
by Louis Napoleon, to which all important
questions affecting the goncral peace would
have to be submitted. The various States en tering
into this confederacy might preserve
their internal forms of government, questions
of peace and war would be no longer in their
hands, but ty those of the congress; and it
would be a difficult and delicate matter to define
accurately just whero the powers of the
Slate ceased and those of the confederacy
commenced, and over what class of subjects
the jurisdiction of the latter extended.
These difficulties present themselves on the
very threshold. And so wo find Austria laying
it down, as a condition precedent to her acceptance,
that the aotual status of affairs shall
he recognized, and that no proposition tending
to a severance of Hungary or Venetia from her
empire shall be introduced. In other words,
she will go into it just to gratify the whim of
the French Emperor, if she is assured in advance
that it is all a delusion, and that nothing
u la
wuuinvri is uumu vi at.
The Pope ie reported by Ibe I ant new* to
bare given in bid adhesion to tbe plan. At first
sight it might appear strange to find bis Holiness
willing to subject the control of tbe patri-"
mony of St. Peter to the review of a council of
lavmon, some of them heretics aad most of
them liberal in opinion; but in doing so lie
acted wisely, tor one of the first recorms to be
effected by the congress should inovitably bo
the removal of that last monument of tbe Middle
Ages, wh'cb is the chief obstacle to the
unity of the Italian nation. And Pius tho
Ninth reasons, naturally enough, that his
chances aro better if lie is represented in the
congress than they would be if he held himself
aloof from its deliberations.
As to Russia, tboro was perhaps neither the
expectation nor tbe desire that she should tako
part in this European conclave. Her recent
snubbiug ol the three Powers on the Polish
question has not been forgotten or forgiven.
8he Is regarded, too. rather as an Asiatic than
as a European nation. Besides, the question of
Poland must necessarily form the leading topic
of discussion. It is true to-day. even more than
it was when Talleyrand declared it in the Congress
of Vienna, lhat the most exclusively European
question is that which concerns Poland.
And it is evident now, oven if it was not so
then, that tbo only way of solving that question
in a permanent and satisfactory manner is
to force Russia. Austria and Prussia to disgorge
those huge morsels of Poland which they each
swallowed, but which none of thoin can digest,
and reorganize that kingdom with 4the boundaries
which it possessed before the first partition.
Such importnnt and difficult subjects as thojo
to which we have casually alluded?questions
of Poland, Italy, Hungary. Ireland, to s.iy
nothing of the Danish duchies?would coiue before
the congress which Louis Napoleon, with
his wonderful sagacity and tact, imagined but
never expected to see realized.
Hut. even though be might not flutter himself
with that prospect, he attains annthot very important
result by bis proposition, and it was
probably the one which he had more particularly
in view?that is, he succeeds in divert
ing the attention of the French people from
himself and hi* internal policy to this project
of a European congress and to the great questions
involved in it The results of the lust
May elections indicated a wonderful change o*
sentiment in tho public mind of France. Tlw
pitiful opposition minority of five in the legislative
body finds itsalf increased to thirty; and
the worst of it, to Urn, is that this opposition
represents the libei at sentiment of Franco, and
includes such men as Thiers, Berryer and Jules
Favre. All the great centres of population?
Paris. I.yons, Marseilles, Havre, Bordeaux,
Nan tee gave majorities against the govern
nient. The election figures In Paris are instructive.
In Ih:,7 the government candidates
received one hundred in I ten thou and votes
against ninety six thousand given to the npposition
candidates. In 1803 tho government candidates
received only eighty four thousand votes
against one hundred and fifty thousand given to,
j the opposition. And Ibis success of the liber 4i?
' was achieved in spite of all tho patronago and
power of Hie government, with the, frt,P.
dom of the press restricted and <ho right
I oi h dding public meetings denied The pria
LE SHEET.
ciples contended for on the part of the opposition
were the freedom of the press,
the right of holding public meeting# and the
extension of municipal franchises, including the ,
election of mayors and common councils; and i
the public mind was influenced by complaints
about the Mexican expedition, the embarrassed
condition of the finances and the annual levy or (
a hundred thousand men for military purposes.
This indication of the current that affairs
wore taking has not been without its due effect
on the mind of Napoleon. He must have reflected
upon the fate of his two immediate predecessors,
Louis 1'hilippe and Charles X.,
who lost their throues by the operatiou
of just such causes as he new sees at work. He
has prepared lor the contingency by the public
iuijji vmciibs U1HUL- 1U i alio, willUU ll'UUl'l IUC
citv more easily defensible in case of a revolution.
But he knows that the criticisms upon
the policy of his government, which will now
be hoard in the Chambers, will be published in
the journals; that the public mind will soon be
operated upon by them, and that cvon the army
will in time become inoculated with liberal
ideas. He will probably be forced to relax immediately
some of his repressive rules of policy;
but he evidently calculates upon this great
European project of his for changing the
popular current and turning the thoughts Qf
Franee into another direction. That, we take
it, is the real motive and design at the bottom
of the whole atfair.
RtsottciTi.no for the Army.?Recruiting business
is exceedingly active just now, and if
our capitalists would Bbow their patriotism a
little by subscribing for the county loan it
would be still more se. Our banks did well
yesterday. They subscribed $G00,000 towards
the $2,000,000. The Supervisors' committee
are likely to lose many volunteers for the want
of means to nav the bountv. Our loyal citi
zona must come forward and take the remainder
of the $2,000,000, and then our
quota will be soon filled. Mr. Blunt, chairman
of the committee, received yesterday
and paid the bounty of three hundred dollars
lor one hundred volunteers, and as
mapy more blank forms for volunteering
wore issC?di It i? an easy mutter to make
a display of pat'u?tam Public meetings, &c.;
but the money i9 what is now tVanteu, jnco
would be had and a draft prevented. Unlet"
the direotion of the War Department, every per
son bringing in a recruit for the regiments in
the field is paid by the Provost Marshal
fifteen or twenty-five dollars. This bun turned
one-half of the community, apparently, into
recruiting sergeants. Hence the rush upon
tho committee for blank forms wherewith
to secure men. Some of these agents uro
doubtless rogues; but when a blank is
returned by one, properly filled, with tho
name of the Provost Marshal attached,
the bounty must be paid. But whenevor a
fraud .is detected by any one of these agents
ho is soon brought to the bur of Supervisor
Blunt, and made not only to disgorge, but is relentlessly
cut otr from any further business j
with the committee. No less than three wo- i
men mado their appearance yestorday at tho !
rooms of the committee whose husbands had <
volunteered, and received, one but $50, one ,
$75 and one $200. The chairman heard their j
cases, got up the papers, and found the names
of the agents, brought thein up and compelled
them forthwith to pay over the balance duo to
tneso poor women, wuose nusDanus vrero
already on Hiker's Island. Tbe work is so i
prompt that it is never found that the same ]
ugonl ia caught twice. All tbe committee j
now desire is money to pay tbe bounty.
Pat oi- Navai. OnicKit*.?We have received J
a letter from a master'* mate on one of our i
war vessels, complaining, and very justly too. 1
of tbe inadequate pay received by officers of ,
his rank; also showing llic impossibility of an 1
officer of that rank supporting bis faintly on '
his salary. It appears that tho pay of a
master's male is forty dollars per month when (
iu jvort, and forty-nine dollars when at sea, in- ,
eluding rations. At the former rate he receives
four hundred dollars per year, and at
the lattor five hundred and eighty-eight dollar*.
Tbe actual expense of the officer, at Ihe 1
lowed figure ?and that, too, without including '
any luxuries, but simply counting those items |
that be is obliged to buy, and cannot under
any circumstances avoid puying lor?amounts :
to about lour bundled and sixty dollars, living
in a pinched style at thai. This leaves him ;
only twenty dollars per annum to support his
family, on a salary of forty dollars per mou It.
and one hundred and twenty-eight dollars on a
salary of torly-nine dollars per month. We
are assured thai at least two-thirds of those
men who bold positions ot that rank in our
nuvy are loeu of families. How is it possible, r
we ask, for them to make both ends meet' Is
this treating uieu who are engaged in guarding r
our nation's honor on the high seas und but- !
fling for Mm* restoration of the Union as they
should be treated ' t
We call the special attention of Hip Van
Winkle Welles, of the Navy Department, to j ,
tins outiageous feature, and also urge upon ;
Congress immediate action upon thw question. ?
It is one of the first questions that our Lew- f
makers- should take up. Let it oot lie said '
fi
that men iu the service of the country are
obliged to grow poor and poorer every year f
that they tcroaia in that service. Suc h-treat* 1
