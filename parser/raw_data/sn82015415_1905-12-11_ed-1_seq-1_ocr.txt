James Love cannot revoke the trust
deed by which he placed. his proporty
in the hands of trustees for the benefit
of his heirs. Another decision was giv
en this morning, by the Supreme Court,
to tho effect that the deed is not re
vocable. Love made tho deed imme
diately after ho was released from his
spendthrift trust, after a long legal
light, and it now appears that ho sim
ply stepped from one trust into anoth

this morning was brought in his behalf
by H. B. HIghton, against James Love,
Jr., Annie K. Hart and the Henry Wa-
terhouse Qrust Company, trustee for
Love. The opinion of tho court is by

THAT BUSINESS HAS FALLEN
OFF A LITTLE THIS YEAR.
From all appearances, as the Post Of

sents as usual this year. The S. S.
Korea will go out today and up to noon
150 sacks of mail of which 30 are re
gistered pouches had boen prepared. As
tho ship will not sail until G o'clock
and as the stream of people at the
Post Office was continuous, this .num
ber of pouches and mall bags will be
largely augmented.
"The business has been smaller than
It was last year" said Louis Kenukc
this morning "although of course It Is
Impossible to tell how much may rush

habit, despite warnings, of delaying
their mall until it is really too late to

'Last year we sent 112 sacks of mail
by the Ventura on December C and 37

24 were registered pouches. Then on
tho 10th by the S. S. Mongolia we sent
178 sacks, 48 registered and on tho 21st

HEAD OF THE HOME RULE PARTY
'SAYS HE CAN DETECT THE
GOVERNOR'S CAMPAIGN.
Charles K. Notley the head of tho
Homo Rule party, declares that he can
see In Governor Carter's late speeches,
and the publication of his letter to tho
President relative to nawailan affairs,
tho beginning of tho Governor's cam
paign for Delegate to Congress.
"Ho wrote to tho President asking
for seventy-five per cent of tho federal
revenue of the islands to be spent
here," said Notley this morning. "Tho
President recommends it to Congress.
Tho Governor gives out the letter for
publication. Don't you see .between
the lines, ho Is telling the peoplo, "I am
the ono ivho can get things for you;
send me to Congress."
"Then ho makes a speech at the
Young Hotel In which ho tells tho peo
plo all about this seventy-five per cent
proposition. Between the lines, I read
that he Is telling them ho Is tho man
they ought to send to Congress; the
man who can get things.
"Ho tells the same thing at tho Y.
M. C. A. meeting tho other night. Oh,
there Is no doubt ho lias begun his
campaign for congress. I don't blame
.him. It ho wants to bo Delegate and
tho Republican party wants him to be,
why he has a right to run, if ho can
get tho nomination.
"But mark my words, he has begun
to work for the nomination."

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND
MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION TO
DELIBERATE THIS AFTERNOON.
This afternoon's meeting of tho
Chamber of Commorco and tho Mer
chants' Exchange, In Joint session at
the rooms of the former mentioned
body should bo of tho interest to all
who are concerned In tho welfaro of
Hawaii.
"Just what wo are going to do has
not been outlined," said Chairman
Smith at noon today "but the general
Idea Is to back up, as far as posslblo
tho welcome words in tho message of
President Roosevelt In which ho ad
vocates tho return to Hawaii of a very
considerable portion of tho revenues
derived hero. The sentiment Is unanim
ous but it has seomed to us that It
should be put In proper form crytalllz
ed, so to speak."
From what could bo gathered, It
seemed that this afternoon's meeting
will go carefully over tho President's
message, o'r of such portions of It as
affect Hawaii, and will then pass reso
lutions for transmission to tho head of
tho nation and also to tho governing
bodies.
