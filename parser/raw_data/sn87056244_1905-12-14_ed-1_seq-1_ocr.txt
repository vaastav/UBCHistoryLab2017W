Wonderful Glimpse Glimpse In
to Electricity's Future by
Edison.
Thomas A. Edison declared
Sunday that before his death he
would see the world's electricity
produced by a direct process
without the intervention of steam
and with that discovery the
-solution of the problem of aerial
navigation
and ocean vessels
crossing
the Atlantic in three
davs time.
ürp (Trnntn rr rn
ot another great epoch in the
world's history," he said. "It
"would not surprise me any morn
ing to wake up and learn that
some one or some group of the
300,000 scientific men who are in
vestigating all over the earth has
seized the secret of electricity bv
direct process and begun another
practical revolution of human af
fairs. It can be done. It will be
done. I expect to see it before I
-die."
"The first great change in pro
duction of electricity will abolish
the carrying of coal for that pur
pose," he said. "'Instead of dig
ging gross material out of the
earth, loading it on cars and car
rying it, say, 500 miles, there to
put it under a boiler, burn it and
so get power, we shall set up
plants at the mouths of the mines
generate the power there and
transmit it wherever it is needed
by copper wires.
"It is preposterous to keep on
putting the coal mines on wheels.
Jt is too clumsy. It is too costly.
There is no necessity for it.
"It is easier to carrv molecular
Aibration millions of waves a
second than freight cars full of
crude matter. We can ship a
10,000 horse power over a wire
quicker and more economically
than we can send the equivalent
in coal over a railroad track.
"We must eliminate the rail
road altogetner from this prob
lem. What's the use of it? We
don't' want the coal anvhow. It
does us no good to look at it.
What we want is the resultant,
the utmost energy that can be
produced. And there is no sense
in carrying around millions of
tons of raw material like coal
when we can get its product de
livered to us by wire.
Everything points to the fact
that in the near future electricity
will be produced for general con
sumption in the great power
houses at the mouth of the coal
pits. That is the logical and com
mon sense outcome of present
events.
"The present method of doing
things is merely a matter of hab
it. It's simply wonderful to ob
serve how habit controls man and
how it sometimes 'delays great
reformations even in practical af
fairs. This system of carrying
coal from the mines for the pur
pose of producing electricity
somewhere else is habit. Habit
is the greatest foe to progress
and invention.
"The great majority of men
are controlled bv habit. They
have always seen a thing done
one way and. that way seems to
them the only way. But there
are some ot us who have a littla
of the spirit of evolution and we
bother and trouble the others by
not letting them alone.
"Now., the truth is that it will
cost a third less to transport elec
trical power by wire than to car-
. - - i r
ry u in me iorm 01 coal in rail
road cars. Assume the price of
coal to be $1 at the mouth of the
mine and assume the freight to
be $1.90. Now, we can turn that
coal into electricity at the mine
and convey it by wire at less than
half the cost of the freightage of
coal.
"So, in years to come, the great
electric power plants will be set
up in the coal fields. Electric
power will largely do away with
the steam power. Electric light
will become cheaper than gas
light.

Statesmen Must Buy Tickets.
Congressmen who went to
Washington on passes and then
collected mileage from the Gov-j
ernment for car fare ostensibly
paid out, will have to save moneys
to get home on if the Eastern
railroads adhere to their express
ed determination to abolish freej
passes after January 1.
The Pennsylvania and Phila-i
delphia & Reading roads have al-j
ready anounced such an order, to
take effect on that date, and oth
er Eastern roads under the con
trol of the Pennsylvania system
are expected to follow suit The
result will be that Washington
will be cut off from the world
except by the payment of rail
road fare after New Year's day
except for those members, which
are few, who have been in the
habit of paying railroad fare in
the past as a matter of principle.
The new policy of the roads
has been heard in Washington in
silence. Congressmen who have
been in the habit of accepting
passes are loath to adimt the fact
by kicKing against the new order.
Several bills have already been
introduced in Congress to abol
ish the pass evil, but the rail
roads have done what Congress
has refused to do in the past and
wiped off the slate without legis
lation. Thrown Against Train,
Clem Hershberger, aged 24
years, who resides four miles
west of Bremen, and is employed
at the factor of Coppes, Zook
& Mustschler Co., at Nappanee,
came near being killed Monday
morning in trying to catch a
freight train just east of the
Main street crossing in Nap
panee. Hershberger was thrown
toward the train and his head
5 truck the box on the end of an
axle which prevented his body
from going across the rail, no
doubt, and meeting instant death.
As it was, he received very se
vere injuries, which may yet
prove, fatal. His skull had a
large hole knocked in on the
back of his head, and a bad
wound at the side of the head
over the ear and one on the chin.
Besides these, his face was bad
ly cut and his back injured.
How People are Interested.
"In what way are all the peo
ple interested in hte rate regula
tion question: someone asks. In
this, that evervbouv is more or
less affected by railroad charges
on pretty much every tmng
that- he eats, drinks, wears or
uses domestic water excepted.
It is the purchaser that pays
the freight. There is no escape
from this. The ettect of over
charges on freight ana the grant
ing of rebates is in some instan
ces felt doulbly, and felt keenly.
Such discrimination destroys
competition; enables the big fel
lows to swallow up the little
ones. It is iniquitous, demoral
izing, destructive. South Bend
Times.
Adjt. Gen. Ward Resigns.
John R. Ward, who served as
adjutant general of the Indiana
National Guard in Durbin's ad
ministration, resigned Thursday.
It is said to have been the result
of an investigation of the books
in the auditor's office which - re
vealed "irregularities. The com
mittee reports to the governor
that pay rolls of the state militia
.companies were padded to the
extent of over $900 during the
last two years. Ward was re
appointed, by Gov. Hanly at the
beginning of the administration
of the latter.
. Ward, who is wealthy, offered
to make good, but Hanly refused.
Ward resides in Monticello.
I :
What the President Expects.
The Chicago Chronicle thinks
the president does not expect
congress to enact all the legisla
tion he recommends during the
present session or the next. If he
gets during the present session
the sort of rate law he wants,
the legislation necessary to the
financing of the isthmian canal,
the money he asks for the navy,
free trade with the Philippines
except insugar and tobacco, and
some improvement in the immi
gration and naturalization laws
he will feel tolerably satisfied..
Ward Makes Shortage Good.
John R. Ward, deposed adju
tant general of Indiana, settled
in full with the state Saturday,
A A. f 1 1- t
paying ine amount oi rus snort
aere so far as it has been deter
mined. He says he will meet any
claim that may be made against
him and that his drawing's of the
money in excess of the amount of
his vouchers was due wholly to
clerical errors.
LITTLE GRAFTS.
Bryan's Commoner Thinks They,
Exist Almost Everywhere. .
The Commoner for Dec, 1 has
the following article on "Little j
Grafts:"
Graft is not to be measured by
size alone The little grafter is!
just as bad in his way as the big'
grafter who accumulates his
thousands and hundreds of thous
ands in a manner that will not
bear scrutiny- If graft is to be
abolished the work of abolition
must permeate all branches of so
ciety, for graft is worse than dan
delion, or burdock, or cockleburr
root.
An eastern physician writes
that he has been offered a com
mission by the- proprietor of a
'health resort" on - every patron
sent." That ts eralt.
A New York phvsiciain was of
fered a commision of 10 per cent
on all business sent to a crema
tory firm. At first thought this
might seem a legitimate offer,
but when one considers the stat
us of the family physician it takes
on the earmarks of a yeVy con
temptible bit of graft.
Traveling men know full well
that a small "present will often
influence a department buyer to
favor a certain line of goods, but
it is gratifying to know that the
traveling salesmen are beginning
to fight that sort of thing. But
the buyer who engages in it is
guilty of a very contemptible
graft.
In our eagerness to abolish
graft in high places we should
not overlook the "little grafting"
that abounds on even side.
Every species of graft must be
put under the ban if the national
character is to be cleansed and
given a chance tD improve.
i
Waning Respect for Wealth.
At a dinner in New York a few
days ago Mr. Hughes, the lawyer
who is making such a reputation
as the inquisitor for the Arm
strong Committee, in discussing
the insurance investigation in its
relation to puDiic morals, maoe
the remark that what we most
need is more public attention to
standards of honor. We need to
hear less of the man who was
born poor and amassed a fortune
and more of the man who died
poor and left an unsullied record.
There are hopeful signs of a
trend of public thought in -that
direction. The universal honor
that was paid the memory of Col.
Jacob Greene, president of the
Connecticut Mutual, when he
died comparatively poor after
managing the affairs of a great
corporation for so many years,
was one of these signs. The dis
position of the social leaders of
Pittsburg to ostracise the presi
dent of the Steel Trust for social
irregularities is another. , The
very fact that the millionaire has
grown so common as to com
mand little attention nowadays is
another.
Elect Good Road Supervisors.
Those directly interested in
each road district and that
means everybody, should see to
it that only the very best men
be selected as nominees for the
office of district road supervisor.
The election to fill these offices
in the several townships will be
held Saturday, December 16.
The law specifies the polls shall
be open two hours during that
day, the time and place in each
district to be designated by the
Township trustee under whose
supervision the election is held,
by the posting of two notices in
each of the several road districts
of his township.
Lagrange County will be Dry
The county commissioners of
Lagrangecounty refused a license
Monday to the applicant for a
liquor license in Milford town
ship, the only township in the
county in which there are no sa
loons. The remonstrators filed
272names against the traffic, to
242 for it, and the commissioners
had nothing "else to do than to
heed the remonstrance. This
frees Lagrange county entirely
from the saloons after the license
of the present holders expires.
- Auto Law a Dead One.
Judge Vaughn of Bluffton,
holds that the law enacted by the
last legislature or the govern
ment of autos is a dead one, for
the reason that the law can not
be uniformly enforced. The law
requires. the autoist to give per
sons reasonable time to drive
their horses to the side of the
road. No two courts would agree
as to what constitutes a reason
able time, and consequently the
law is lame and imperfect.
Our Vast Internal Trade.
The report of the business of
the Sault Ste, Marie canal for the
month of October shows, the pas
sage through htat water: way of
6,046,187 tons of frei ghtv a larger
traffic than that of any other
month since the canal was open
ed. Reports for the first half of
November also showed an in
crease over even that enormous
traffic
Heretofore the year 1902 lias
been "the record year"' of the can
al, but the ten months, of the cur
rent year ending Nov. lr showing
the passage of more than 37,000,
OOOtons, exceeded bv something
like 2,000,000 tons- of traffic of the
whole of
Among, the interesting poiüts
in this record is the fact that of
the whole amount of freight dur
ing the ten: months 31,603,000
tons were carried eastward and
only 6,385,000 came west and of
this latter- more than 1,000,000
tons were of soft coat, notwith
standing the enormous amount
of that product mined in the cen
tral west.
Another point is that while
east-bound freight was rive times
greater than westbound the pas
sengers carried east were more
than 2rW0 fewer than those car
ried west. Relatively this line is
not a great carrier of passengers,
but the difference indicates that
even this slower mode of move
ment shares in the continued
shifting of our population west
ward. Meantime 'the colossal internal
railway traffic of the country has
shown like growth. The gross
earnings of fifty-eight different
companies for October aggregat
ed nearly $69,000.000, an increase
of 3,500,000 over last year's cor
responding month.
Candidates for Congress.
The South Bend Tribune has a
special from Goshen which says
in substance that Congressman
Brick will succeed in getting
Postmaster Sherwin reappointed
at Goshen notwithstanding ' the
charges against him i.?A that
Brick will have a solid delegation
from Elkhart county for renom-
ination over John W. Parks of
Plymouth.
So far as Mr. Parks is con
cerned, we know that he is not
at present making any effort to
get a nomination for congress.
What the future will develop wo
do not know, but we do know
that Plymouth politicians expect
there will be several candidates
when the convention meets and
that one of them will be from
Elkhart county, two from ' St.
Joseph county, one from Starke,
and one from Kosciusko.
Many prominent men in this
district now are like Fred Lan
dis who when asked about being
a candidate for renomination in
the Eleventh Indiana district
next year put his head in his
hands and with all the caution of
an old-timer said very carefully:
"Things a$ in somewhat of a
muddle in my district just now
and I am not yet ready to make
a statement."
Lauer Raps Darrow.
L. M. t,auer of Plymouth,
whose "Dooley" article last sum
mer on the disbarment case cre
ated a feeling that Marshall
county would not be a proper
place to which to send the case
for trial, has written another
chapter, the same appearing in
the Plymouth Independent. Al
though Mr. Lauer is a personal
friend of Attorney Samuel Par
ker, one of the lawyers for the
defense, and the article was writ
ten from the standpoint of the
defendants,in the alleged hope of
belittling the "prosecution, the
writer unintentionally, it is be
lieved, takes several hard raps at
the defense when he declares that
changes of venue are senseless
and that the prejudice and bias
exist mostly in the minds of the
lawyers who make the affidavits
and are for the purpose of gain
ing time, for the defense has tak
en two changes of venue, one
from the judge and one from the
county. Mr. Lauer's latest-h a -

Marvin Kuhns Prefers Prison.
Marvin Kuhns,; the Indiana
desoerado. who is serving a life
sentence in the Ohio state orison.
at Columbus, prefers to remain
there to having - his freedom.
Kuhns has löst the sight of one
eye and is badly crippled so thnt
it would be hard for him to earn
a living outside. In the prison
he has the souvenir concession
and it is said he is making mon
ey. He has instructed his attor

ANNUAL INSPECTION.
Plymouth Commandery No: 26
Knights Templar.
It is the custom of the Grand
Commandery Knights Templar,
of the State of Indiana to appoint
each year an Inspector General
whose duty it is to visit each sub
ordinate Commandery of each
Grand Jurisdiction and make a
thorough examination of the
books and records and witness
the work of conferring the orders
on a candidate. The Avork of the
Commander is criticised by the
Inspector who points out the de
fects in the equipment or work
of the officers. Bv this means the
Commanderies are spurred on to
make a special effort to maintain
a good standing, as the reports of
the Inspector General are read
with interest by the Knights
Templar throughout the state.
The earnest and effective work
of Eminent Commander Arnot
M. Cleveland, supported by his
corps of offiicers and members of
Plymouth Commander' bas
brought this commandery to the
state of efficiency that warranted
the approval of . the Inspector
General.
The year just closed has been
one of unusual prosperity for the
order of Knights here and Ply
mouth Commandery has a mem
bership of - about 100, including
members from Rochester, Knox,
Argos, Bremen and Bourbon.
The visit of M. W. Goltra,
Deputy Inspector General, Tues
day evening was made the oc
casion of a reception to the ladies.
After the work of conferring
the Order of Knighthood upon
Companion F. W. Bosworth was
concluded, the Knights together
with their lady guests repaired to
Hill s cafe where a bountiful ban
quet waV spread, which was
thoroughly enjoyed by about 100
guests. After the banquet speech
es were made by the Inspector
jGeneral and others.
The music furnished by Miss
Irene Kuhn , and Messrs. Fred,
Jr.. and Gus Kuhn was greatly
enjoyed by all pre e it.
Circuit Court Items.
Mos of the time oi the courts
this week has been taken up with
the trial of. the State of Indiana
versus Kesie O. Mclntire.
The charge against the defend
ant was fraudulent marriage and
he was found guilty. It is the
first case under the new law that
has been tried in this county.
The law provides punishment for
a man who marries a woman to
escape bastardy proceedings and
.then abandons her.
Mclntire has been in jail sever
al weeks and as he seems to have
no money he will probably re
main there 200 days, the mini
mum fine being $200.
William Overman who has a
saloon at Lake Maxinkuckee en
tered a plea of guilty of selling
liquors on Sunday and was fined
on two counts $20.00 and costs.
His bar tenders, Lee Hunter and
Emanuel Bush were each fined
$10.00 flnd costs.
$1,222 for Broken Back.
The price of broken backs, if
there is another man alive who
has one, has been fixed. A brok
en back may be paid for, where
some other person or company
caused the injury, for $1,222.
Thurston Shuck of Elwood sued
the Snyder Canning Company of
Cincinnati for $2,000 and a com
promise was effected whereby
the sum mentioned and ail expen
ses of the suit will be paid. Shuck
will be a cripple for life. Physi
cians say his back is broken, but
he lives and walks and his case
is a revelation to medical science.
A number of medical schools
have asked him to appear before
them for an investigation.
Accidents at Morris' Mill.
There were two accidents at
the Morris mill Wednesday mor
ning. Just after the machinery
started Jacob Roth caught his
right hand in a sticker and three
fingers were so badly lacerated
that Dr. Kaszer had to amputate
the ring finger. The middle fing
er .and little finger will be saved.
About 10 o'clock Jefferson
Pletcher got the middle finger of
his right hand badly cut in a
jointer. Dr. Kaszer- dressed the
injured member and Mr. Pletcher
will probably be able to work
again before many days.

Postoffice Appointments.
A Washington dispatch says
the Indiana congressman beseig
ed the postmaster general's office
Wednesday demanding ' answer
as to postmastership appoint
ments. All recommendations
have been pigeonholed and no in
formation as to the president's
intention is obtainable.
Longest Wedded Couple.
It seems that Marshall coun
ty's claim for the longest wedded
couple is outclassed. Westfield
and Richmond, Indiana, come in
a little ahead. Mr. and Mrs.
James Taylor of Tippecanoe
township, Marshall county have
been wedded sixty-eight years ;
Mr. and Mrs. James Scott, of
Westfield, Ind., have been mar
ried sixty-nine years.
But Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter, of
Richmond, were wedded in Clin
ton county, O., in 1834, and soon
after the opening of the coming
new year will have been married
seventy-two years. Carpenter,
who sixty years ago was presi
dent of Earlham college and also
its superintendent, was born in
Schenectady, X. Y., Jan. 1, 1811,
and the birthday of the new year
will mark his 94th anniversary.
His wife, who was Miss Susan
Mable, of Clinton county, O., is
one year younger.
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Carpen
ter of Richmond, are among the
best-known Quakers in the Indi
ana yearly meeting of Friends.
Preserve President's Message.
Speaking of the president's
message, the Chicago Tribune
observes that the readers of that
elaborate but exceedingly inter
estng document "will not be star
tled by novel theories or unex
pected statements. They will ob
serve some excellent doctrines re
garding labor and wealth which
have been set forth so often by
the president that they may be
regarded as truisms. They will
come across recommendations
whichthey will remember having
read one. two, or three years be
fore. For the person who has
read the earlier messages, the
president's recent statements in
public addresses of his views as
to important subjects, and the in
spired utterances of some of his
cabinet officers, there is little that
is new in the latest message."
While this is true it is likewise
a fact that as an entirety it is just
such a document as deserves to
be read and re-read from time to
time. The teachings contained
therein are conducive to good cit
izenship. $25.000 for a Story. .
Think of it! Twenty-five
thousand dollars for one' story!
The highest price that has been
similarly paid in America to any
author. And this for just the ex
clusive rightto print the story in
this one publication no right to
publish it in book form being in
cluded. Consider the quality of merit,
the intensity of interest this story
must possess to command this
extraordinary price. The "White
Company" has ever been accept
ed as the greatest work of any
author, and by far superior to
his own "Sherlock Holmes" tales
but ''Sir Nigel," says Conan
Doyle himself, surpasses them
all.
Conan Doyle receives this fab
ulous sum for his "Sir Nigel,"
which began in the Sunday mag
azine part of last Sunday's Record-Herald.
Shippers Should be Punished.
The Elkhart Review calls at
tention to the fact that President
Roosevelt in his annual message,
"makes one suggestion which has
been lost sight of in the discus
sion hitherto by those who favor
railroad rate .legislation, that the
beneficiary of an unjust and un
fair rate should suffer the penal
ty for accepting such rate or re
bate by being obliged to return
twice the amount of the rebate as
a penalty. The shipper is as
much a violater of morals in ac
cepting as the other in giving.
A Fact Worth Knowing.
In this progressive age all
things must be in pace to win ac
knowledgement and success.
Knowing this Varney & Adams
have made use of unlimited capi
tal to place their production of
"The Diamond King" in the
front ranks of all amusement en

INDIANA'S BIRTHDAY.
The Hoosier State was Admitted
to the Union of States,. Dec
11, 1816.
Monday Dec. .11, is Indiana's
89th birthday anniversary. Its
chronology may be summed up
as follows: Vincennes a mission
post 1700, Wabash discovered
1702, Ceded to England 17G3,
Made a territory May 7, 1800,
Constitution adopted June 29,
1816, Admitted to Union Dec. 11,
1816.
The struggling infant of the
days of 1816 has risen with the
years to a position of wealth, in
tegrity, honor and trust; youth,
middle age and the prime of life
have come and crowned the com
monwealth with dignity and the
seal of untold progress. What
was, in the days of long ago, a
vast and unimproved tract, has
developed by the brawn and
brain of Indianians into a land
bursting with harvests, factories
and the spirit of commerce; a
land crossed and recrossed with
railroads and meshed with an in
tricate system of electric sys
tems ; a land crowned with grow
ing cities and inhabited by a peo
ple who have deserved the bless
ings which have been awarded
them.
The Territory of Indiana was
organized by an act of Congress
May 7, 1S00', and William Henry
Harrison was appointed Gover
nor May 12 following. May 13
John Gibson was appointed sec
retary. The Territory then em
braced all the Northwest terri
tory save what was then included
in the Territory of Ohio. The
capital was fixed at Vincennes
and April 13. 1816 Congress
passed an enabling act for the ad
mission of the Territory of Indi
ana as a State.
The Territorial Legislature
called a State constitutional con
vention, which was elected May
13, 1816. This convention assem
bled at Corydon, June 10, 1816,
made a Constitution, submitted it
to the people for ratification and
adjourned June 29. This conven
tion also provided for the election
of State officers and a State Leg
islature to be chosen the first
Monday in August of 1816. that
being the date of the vote on the
State Constitution.
The Constitution was adopted
and the newly elected Legislature
convened at Corydon, organized
and received the message of the
Governor and thus fully complie 1
with the requirements of the en
abling act of Congress. That was
Nov. 7, 1816, the fifth anniversary
of the battle of Tippecanoe.
A messenger bearing a certified
copy of the proceedings of the
State's organization was dis
patched to Washington to lay
the record before Congress.
Whereupon, Congress, in due
form, declared Indiana a State in
the Union. The proceedings of
the State's organization were
signed by the President, who is
sued a proclamation declaring In
diana one of the States of the
Union, Dec. 11, 1S16.
Voted Under Age.
Henry Erhardt, who -was ar
rested for casting a ballot at the
last South Bend city election be
fore he had attained his majori
ty, changed his plea of not guilty
to guilty, after waiving arraign
ment. 'He is IS years old. Judge
Funk said he would take the mat

statutes and is punishable by a
