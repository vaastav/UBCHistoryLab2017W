*e think so, too. The dodging days are
gone, the saddest of the year.
Mr. Oct*sty Commissioner Woods ought
to blame the Stein committee for reflecting
on itself. That committee is lacking either
in integrity or intelligence, and it makes
little difference which. It has doubled on
its own tracks, swallowed itself and gener
ally exhibited itself as a sorry spectacle. It
can give no reason for Its change of mind,
and the public will never believe that it
has acted from a sense of justice. Com*
miaaioner Stein's oflense warranted ex

The preeent Btatus of the case iB an insult
to every membor of the Board who believes
in a lawlul and straightforward way of
transacting the public business. Tho fair
inference is that somebody iB afraid of
Commiaioner Stein.
Mr Chalmers is not an admirable per
son. lie is rather too much of a tumbler
in politics to bo highly respected. But if
the people of the SeccrA Mississippi Dis
trict elected him to Congress Mr. Manning
ought not to have the seat. Manning hae,
over his own signature, already admitted
that Chalmers has a prima facie right to
the seat, and he has also said that he
would not Mk to have his name enrolled
until the House, shall have affirmed his
right thereto. Iiis friends in the House
seem to be in needless hurry. The Com
mittee on Elections will make him a case
and the Uouae will seat him. Mr. Man
ning's political friends are running the
House in these days.

Thote who looked down from the gal
leriea today upon the members of the
House ol ltspreeentatlves aw many
changts which reminded them ol the poli
tical revolution that occurred at the elec
tions last (all. one year ago. More than
half the faces are new ones. Many promi
nent men heretofore occupying seats in
Congress were not there to-day, and there
is knottier Speaker in General Keifer's
place.
A glance at the Representatives present
to day reveals some of the changes. There
was only one new face in the delegation
from Alabama, that of Luke i'ryor. Only
one old face appears in the California dele
gation?that c.1 Oen. Koeecrans, whose war
record is set forth with great elaboration
by himself In the Congressional Directory.
Page, who was chairman of the last Com
merce Committee, and who was elected to
the Forty-seventh Congress by 3,600 major
ity, fs aucceeded by the man that fn WHO
he defeated.
HSI.F0KB STIIX STICKS.
Colorado is again represented by Judge
Jjmca Belford, who seems to have a stroBg
hold on bis constituents, whom he de
lights to serve Mr. Wait iB the only Rs
publican who will represent Connecticut
in the present House. Mr. Buck gives
way to ex-Senator Eaton. Two old mem
bers are returned from Georgia?Elount

on bis wheel-chair in the space in front of
the Speak) r's chair.
Among those returned from Illinois are
Mesirs. Davis of Chicago, Cannon and
Thomap, Republicans, and Morrison. Town
ehend and Springer, Democrats. One of
the new members present to-day is John J.
Kinnerty, who wis here a few months,
several years ago, as the representative of
the Chicago Tima, and who afterwards
wrote many interesting lslters to that paper
from all parts of the country.
Tin obi at oftijCTrn.
Indiana returns Holman, "the Great Ob
jector," Brown and Calkins are the only
tvo Republicans who escaped from the
deluge. One of the new members from
the Hooeier State is John E. Lamb, said to
be one of the best orators in the Slate. He
resembles somewhat, Senltor Kennaand
might easily be mistaken for him. While
he is not the youngest member of the
House, he is among the youngest. He is
Senator Voorheea" law partner and comee
from ferre Haute. Iowa's greatest con
tribution is Mr. Ki'son, who was a promi
nent candidate for the Speakership against
Gen. Keifer two years ago.
Three old members are returned from
Kansas and are all prominent and active
members.
Kontucky has Carlis'e, Joe Blackburn
back, but Proctor Knott's familiar face was
not seen to-day.

navy, with Mr. Candler, one of the hand
somest members of the last House. But
among tliOBe that were sworn In to-day
are Mr. Robinson and Mr. Ramsey. Nine
of the eleven members from Michigan are
new men; six of them are Democrats. The
only prominent Republican returned
from Michigan is Mr. liorr, who Is distin
guished as a humorist and a supporter of
all River and Harbor bills. Barrows was
defeated and his fice was missed to-day.
Bunnell, of Minnesota, got left, and bis
presence lo-day was not required, so be
was not hero.
Chalmers was present claiming bis seat,
but not the one that tbe Republicans gave
10 his colored opponent in tbe last House.
Mr. Lynch was also here. Mr. Money is
another Missiasippian sworn in to-day.
CUIU>-LUU AND BLAND.
In the Missouri delegation is Mr. Bland
of silver bill notoriety. He is able to laugh
at the Rspnblican Green backers, Meeers.

he so savagely attacked two years ago-for
while Mr. Bland is here, the others are lelt
at home. Mr. Buckner Is also a member of
the present Hoiim.
Brewster, of New Jersey, is the only old
member returned from that State. The
corpulent, well dreesed, red faced and loud

EentUmin, whose only distinction la, that

in the House, is returned and was among
tboee who qualified to day. Bai LfFevre,

Dr. UpdegMfTssucceesor, was also among
those present
TUB FATHER OF THE 1i0usk.
In the Pennsylvania delegation were
Mr. Kelley, the father of the House, and
Mr. Randall?the two most prominent
members from that State. Several well
known Republicans from that State were
either beaten or not renominated. Among

Washington, D. C., December 3 ?
In the Senate, while the Republicans,
with the votes of Mahone and Riddleber

Democrats are much stronger intellectually
than their opponents, but both parlies ap

The faces of such men as Conkling, Blaine.
Thurman, Mat Carpenter, Eaton and
other prominent leaders are no longer
seen in the chamber. The Democrats have
ten of their Sanators whose terms expired
on the 4th of March, viz, Morgan, Garland,
Saulsbury, Beck, Lamar. McPberson, Ran

all trained legislators, and most of them are

They have re-elected four, viz., Anthony,

Washington, D. C., December 23.?The
question of patronage is already distressing
the statesmen. The House is not yet fully
organizad, that is the cfHcere who deal out
the plums are yet to eloct and a Demo
cratic caucus has been held for the spoils
after tho adjournment of the House to-day.
First, there was a suggestion that the
House should select for itself all the sub
ordinate oflicers, giving an equal division
to the States in proportion to their Demo
cratic representation. This was finally
voted down and it was determined to de
mand a fair divide and dump the respon
sibility on those who are to directly em

From OurPptcial Corrtupondcnt,
Washington, December 3.?The flret
session of the Forty-eighth Congreea BtarteJ
off to-day under fall eail, without any spe
cial incidents. The House was nearly full,
and there will probably not be as many
members present again during the session.
There was only one man elected as a Re
publican who voted for other than Keifer,
and he had a personal feud with, the ex
Speaker over some whisky legisla
tion in which tho House
nearly unanimously sustained Mr. Keifer.
Robinson got two votes from two Inde
pendents and had the bad taste to sit in
his seaf and refuse to vote for Keifer. He
was a candidate two years ago and
got badly left. Kasson dodged, and
Willie Phelps voted for Keifer. When
the Speaker in delivering his inaugural
apologized for his election and promised
good behavior on the tariff about one-hal/
of the Democrats applauded and the rest
eat still and sullen. There will be trouble
in the camp bye and bye. The free traders
are aggresaive and determined and mean
t j show their hand and let their nerve pile
oa it.
The first move ol the swearing-in of the
members was to get Manning in by the
hack door, after ne hail written to the
Clerk of the House he would not accept
his seat until his one was examined by
the Ejection Committee. To do this they
had to reverse their previous record In
similar caBes. Hewitt, Hill and a number
of Democrats openly* denounced it
as a steal, being Intended to give
Manning pay from March 4'h last lor a
seat be does not claim the roturnu elect him
to. The unfortunate part of it is that in
opposing Manning the Republicans are
compelled to partially espouse "Fort Pil
low" Chalmers, who is one of the moet
anxious men in the country, and while heis
not a Republican is opposed to the regular
Democratic ticket. The house was getting
into a snarl when Cox moved to adjourn
to give time for conBiillation. To-morrow
morning he will be given the seat, the or
gan:zition will bo completed, the mem
bers ckocee for seats and hear the Presi
dent's message read and the house wilt
take a recces till Friday and then again
till Monday.
The Senate moves slowly and has not
yet fixed on a time for a caucus to reor
ganize their offices, but will fill up their
committees and be ready for business next
week.

Wahhikgton, 1). 0., December 3.?At
12 o'clock Clerk McPbereon rapped the
House to order and proceeded to cell the
roll ef Representatives. When the State
of Mississippi had been reached, the Clerk
said he wished to make a statement as to
his failure to put upon the roll the name of
any Representative-elect for tho Second
district and the reason was that no paper,
which could be considered a certificate of
election in the sense of the law, had been
Jircseuted to him. Mr. Chalmers had filed
our exhibits in support of bis claim, but
neither individually nor collectively did
the exhibits afford tho Clerk sufficient
authority to enroll Newton B. Chalmers.
If the Governor of Mlsiisslppi bad issued
a certificate of election to any one, it had
not been presented to the Clerk.
In regard to the First district of North
Carolina, the Clerk had not received the
certificate of the successor of Mr. Pool, de
ceased.
The roll call disclosed 310 members. The
nomination of Speaker beiog in order, Mr.
Ucddea said: "I nominate for speaker of
this House of the Forty-tighth Congrecs,
Mr. Carlisle, of Kentucky, a man of ac
knowledged pre-eminent qualifications for
the place."
Mr. Cannon presented the name of Mr.
Keifer, of Ohio.
Mr. Lyman named Mr. Robinson, of
Massachusetts.
Messrs. Morrison, Tucker, Raed and
Calkins were appointed as tellers. The
Clerk proceeded to call the roll, which re
sulted as follow*: Carlisle, 101, Klefer, 112;
Robinson, 2: James, Lyman, and J. H.
Wise, of Virginia, 1; Wadswortb, o[
New York, 1; Ochiltree and Lacy, of Michi
gan, 1; White, of Kentucky, 1. The Clerk
declared Carlisle elected. Randall and
Keifer escorted tho gentleman to the chair.
His entrance into the Chamber was the
signal for loud applause. The oath of office
was administered.
CABMSLI'S nflEETlNO.
Upon taking the chair Mr. Carlisle laid:
GgMTUUtN OF THE UOUSB OP IUl'MBEK
tativkb?I thank you sinctrely (or the high
honor conferred by the vote just taken. To
be choeen from the membership of a great
body like this and preside over its delibera
tions is a distinction upon which any citi
csn can properly congratulate himself, and
I assure you that your kindness and par
tiality is fully appreciated, at the same time
I realize the fact that the position which
you aligned is one of very great labor and
responsibility, and while profoundly grate
ful of this manifestation of your confidence,
1 shall enter the discharge of its duties
with a serious distrust that my capacity
will meet in an acceptable manner the re
quirements of the office. I promise, how
ever, to devoto to your Bervlce all the zeal
and ability of wbich I am possessed. Gen
tlemen, the maintenance of order on the
floor Is essential, absolutely essential, to
the intelligent systematic transaction of
public business, and I earnestly invoke
your assistance in the enforcement of rules
adopted for the government of our pro
ceedings. The large addition to the mem
bership of the House, resulting from the
late apportionment, ol representatives,
makes this duty even more difficult than
before, and without cordial co-operation
and support I cannot reasonably hope
even to discharge the ordinary daily dui*
of this office. That you will cheerfully co
operate with me in every proper f Sort to
preserve order and facilitate the builnen
of legislation, I have no doubt; but, gon
tlemen, I shall ask something more than
mere co-operation in the discharge of my
duty. Assuring you of my earnest desire
at all times to be jaat and impartial. Kill I
cannot expect to avoid mistakes, and shall
be compelled, therefore, frequently, no
doubt, to rely on the friendly forbiarance
of the gentleman on both lidee of the

When Kansas was reached, Peter*, rep.
resentatlve at large from that State, at the
request of Springer was asked to stsp aside.
Springer said the Governor of Kansas for
warded to him a petition signed by him
eelf and other State officers and a large
number of citiaenr, protecting sgainst
the admission of Peters on the grotind
that under the laws and constitution of
Kansas he was Ineligible to hold cffice.
He, however, withdrew the objection, and
Peters took the oath.
Convene, rising to a question of privi
lege, said the Clerk of the House this morn
ing stated be bad the certificate of the
Governor of Mississippi.
For reaeons satisfactory to Manning be
had choeen not front that certificate
until action be taken by the House. He
(Oonverse) had called upon Manning's at
torney and asked permission to present
Manning's credentials to the House. It
has been the policy of the House by an un
broken train of precedent to seat the mem
ber who held the certificate of the Gover
nor. He asked that the certificate be read.
Keifer eaid M lining never accepted the
certificate and put on the clerk's files a
statement which showed he was beaten by
980 votes. He bad also in effect stated he
would not not ask to be seated on that cer
tificate. Did the gentlemen proprsa to
force Manning to do what lie did not want
to do himself.
ANOTHER CONTEST.
Converse replied that not only Manning
held a certificate and was prima facia en
titled to a seat, bat upon the'Contest it
would be shown that he was entitled to it
upon the merits of the case. The certifi
cate was read and after a short discussion
over the right of Republicans to demand
the reading of the other papers on tile in
the Clerk's office, Converse cfl'ered a reso
lution reciting that Manning holds the cer
tificate of iho Governor of Mississippi and
providing that he be immediately qualified
a cStanber of the House without prejudice
to tffinal right to a seat. Mr. Kasson
doubted whether the House had a right to

dtfek the day of election by the House.
Two Kentucky ladies prepared and sent
Carlisle to-day a beautiful original device

gavel in the shape of George Washington's
hatchet resting on a mossy slump of a tree
in such a way fb to show Doth sides of the
blade and handle. One side was compof ed
of beautiful flowers and the other hand of
painted satin. Through the centre of the
blade on the white satin appeared in illu
minated Old English letters the follows:
"May your eyo bo u keen as tbe blade of ibr
httchel
When worth t member?rife to catcb It,
And lUlliiKi a? trueai?t?el t-j match it,
All lawful builQ h to despatch It."
Oathe left inscription was the trumpet
of fame blowing out the gavel, and bt -
neath on the ldtt a little George Washing
tor, hatchet in hand, catting down a cher
ry tree. On his right were a larger hatchet
and felled tree, la the upper left corner

Piiilaukltiu, December 3.?A. K. Mc
Clure, editor ol the independent Timet ot
this city, teifgraphs from Washington a
striking letter on the election ol Mr. Car
lisle and the poesible resullf:
It was made to crucify every Southern
conservative element of the party and
force liberal Southern members to desert
Ruidall or be retained at home A con
test thus waged and thus won can take no
Btep backward. It is a revolution in Dem
ocratic policy, a bold departure from all
Democratic teachings and traditions of the
last century?a defiant declaration of war
against even incidental protection to the
dissatisfied industries which are to day the
pride, the force, and the wealth of the Re
public. For years the Democratic party
nas battled against prohibitory protection,
but never until now has it avowed its pur
pose to discard even dhcrimination in fa
vor of domestic industry.
A SUICIDAL DECLARATION.
The new Democratic deliverance will
startle the country North and South. The
suicidal declaration for "a tariff for revenue
only" in 1889 defeated the Democrats in
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York,
Connecticut, and nearly lost New Jersey
und Delaware, but the party disavowed it
in all these States, aud the country bad
enough faith in Ueneral iUncock to pre
vent the positive disintegration ol the
party. But now the Democratic proclama
tion of apgreseive hostility to any and every
shado of protection to American ioduslry
comes from a llouse atsuming to speak for
the party just on the threehold of a Presi
dential contest, and ths proclamation
comes from the body that is charged by the
country with the preliminary legislation
about ihesnbj<ct.
It is not the mere deliverance of a party
platform that may be forgotlcn after the
battle. It is the deliberate declaration of
the supreme Democratic representative
body, and it will promptly proceed to exe
cute its purpose. Of coorsa it can accom
plish nothing in the modification of the
tariff', as the Senate and the President are
both ready to defeat and profit by this im
practicable Democratic agitation; but it
wiif throw uncertainly and unrest upon
liie already depressed businessof the coun
try, and all patt history must be at fault in
i'B lessons if the business interests, of the.
land shall not be crystalix :d against Demo
cratic authority, and Republican authority,
with all its ghastly sores ol corruption;
profligacy and sectional despotism, Mr
tinutd as a choice cf evils.
Nor will this sentiment prevail in the
South alone. There are many, very many,
patriotic Southern men who have thrown
themselves into jtbe breach to arrest this
wanton assertion ol sectional force.
TUB RESULT OK SECTIONAL! M.
The obvious result of tbo issue will be a
united North ou the tarifl', and every State
erst cf the Mississippi, and a divided
South, with a mr jority of the ablest jour
nals of the South aggressively against the
whole sectional and industrial policy de
livered by tho election of Carlisle. This is
the entertainment to which Southern sec
tionalism invitrs Democracy. It would
give Virginia hack to Mahono. It would
make North Carolina, Alabacnp, Louisiana,
Tennessee and Wist Virginia doubtful,
and it would leave the Democrats without
the hope of a single Ureteral vote in the
Northern States.
Such is the outlook to-day, and only the
resolute revertal of theseciional policy de
clared by the Ilouso can give the Demo
crats the remotest chance to contest the
election of a President next year. Tho
mere self-destruction of the Democratic
party would bo a matter of very little con
stqueLcs. Bu>, in ito self destruction, it
gives new life to the sectionalism that has
been suppressed in the North by the in
telligent and patriotic pi ople of all paities,
and that element can ana will iule the Re
publican party whenever it can rnle with
out parly disasti r.
From this day until the Democratic peo
ple shall unmistakably repudiate the sec
tionalism of their party leaders in Con
gress, no conservative Republican will be
in the range of the next Presidential nomi
nation. li Blaine ahall je enter tho con
test, as iB now uiore than probable, he wiil
refresh himself on bis debate with Hill,
when ho made hla deeperate bid lor North
ern sectionalism, to nominate himself in
1876; and if nominated, he would sweep
the North and break the South by local
strife. Ue knows that tho South cannot
now remain solid on a sectional Iesus with
the North certain to be solid against it,
and he would rend it by fear and promiso.
THE CI.U GUARD AGAIN.
Bnt I look beyond Blaine in casting the
results of this seething Democratic fountain
of sectionalism jnst creatcd in Congress.
There wiil ba loud and earnest calls for the
old commander to return to the fore, un
less Arthur shall pro=e an intuperoble ob
stacle to concentration on Grant, lie will
be made a candidate again, and in the
preseut attitude of the Democracy he
would ba nominated, and, if nominated,
he would carry more Southern State s than
any Republican in the crantry. Ho is the
strongest candidate that Northern section
alism can present. Ha is the idol of capital
and budniaa. He is the terror cf Southern
sectionalism. He would completely dis
arm and more plausibly rally the South to
bis fupport, for Southern tafaly, than
could any other candidate. The South has
had his rule in war and in peaca. Repres
sion of sectionalism, and with Its people
sick of Southern suicide and its fearful con
sequences, he would end solid South for
! ever.
It is Grant's mission to be recalled to tho
Preeidency. lie has defeat to atone, and
I Btial! bu greatly surorised If he does not
become the foremost Republican candidate
In 1834, within the nut three months
He could not have made himself a formi
dable aspirant; but Sonlhern tcctlonol
folly can da for Qrant In a day more than
all bis friends could hope to acliievo in a
life time. The one obstacle to Grant en
tering isthe probable persistence of Arthur
in a candidate, in the present reasonable
certainty of an election; butVith Arthur
out of the way Grant would bo the foremost
candidate before another moon slioll have
waxed and waned. Hat, whether Blaine
or Qrant, the Republican candidate will
be one who can meet Southern sectional
ism with sggrenlve sectionalism, and that
is the supreme calamity it flirted upon the
country by the sectional and industrial
issues made paramount by the Democratic
[louse.

Annlyiisof llie Public Debt Klntement
Amount or Beduction.
Washington, December 3.?The follow
ing is Major .John M. Carson's analysis of
the public debt statement:
The November debt statement shows a
reduction for the month of $1,721,870, and
for the Ave months of the current, fiscal
year of $41,300,140, against $*$34,143 ani
$65,050,801, respectively, for Wfc two cine*
sponding periods of last year.- The email
reduction for last month is due to a falling
off in receipts and to an increase of the
expenditures for the month. Tne receipts
for the month jast closed were in round
figures $20,000,000, and the expenditures
?25,000,000. Bgainst $30,000,000 receipts
and $23,000,000 expenditures in Novem
ber. 1882, a difference of SO.OOp.OOO in favor
ef the latter month.
The column of bonded deb?shows a re
duction of over $11,000,000, afid the non
interest-bearink column of bonded debt an
increase of $2 300.000. The available cash
foots up $153,044,072. n decrease- since No
vember 1 of $7,838,471. The payments for
pensions were over $12,000,000, which is
nearly $4,000,000 in excess of the pay
ments on this account during'November,
1882.
The silver dollars on band now amount
to $117,708 000] an increase for. the month
cf $1,732,1)00. There is outstanding against
this fund nearly $88,000,000 In- certitlcates,
an increase for the month of nearly $3,000,
000, and since July 1 of $14,000,(H)0. The
gold coin aud gold bullion fund is $1(5,133,
527, an incieaae since November 1 of
nearly $7,000,000. The increase in out
standing gold certificates was aid') about
$7,000,000, the amount being nearly $39,
000,000. Since July 1 tho gold fnud, de
ducing. outstanding certificates, lias in
creased $15,000,000.
The following table shows the receipts
for November, compared with the corres-j
pondifigmonth last year:

says he killed Mm. Ford at 9 o'clock Satur
day morning, lie did not attempt to out
rage her. She waa killed in a drunken
squabble. She showed signs ol life in about
ten minutes, and he made several attempta
to bring fier to if; failing, he became
frightened and chopped the body up and
put It into a trunk and started off to dis
pose n( the body, and he carried it to Rud
dy's house, where he was somewhat ac
quainted. He lelt the trunk iu front of the
house where it remained two hours. lie
took it into tho house about dark,and during
the night he became nervous and^eouia
not sleep until near morning, and as be had
no opportunity to dispose of the body he
concluded a plan of killing Ruddy and
family, nnil burning the house, thereby
destroying the evidence of hia guilt.
HOW TUB MUKDEK WASC0M1IITISI).
Simon gives a graphic description ot
the killing of ltuddy and child and the - '
attack on Mrs. Ruddy. Tho latter got up
at midnight and made him a cup ol tea
and returned to bed. ltuddy sat up with
Simon, who did not intimate to-him what
the trouble waB. Simon waaliirworked up
aid imagined the house waa surrounded.
"I walked about the hocm," he say*, 'ion
til about :i o'clock, when it occurred to ma
I might kill the whole of them and bum

came 1 s'.rtci Rji'dy. I don't s ippoee he
saw me. 1 Hilled hiui Instantly. lie made
no noise more than dropping off the chair.
Hi3 wife ran out. There wasa light on the

grabbed at her and struck her with a
ttatchet. She screamed. I cannot remem
ber what she laid. A child screaming I
took him off the bed but don't remember
cutting him with the hatchet. I cannot
tell whether I struck the woman
afterward or not. At this time the trunk
had not been opened.

I chopped a rope oil1 tie trunk and turned
the body of Mrs. Ford on tho floor. Iu
some way I pullsd the bed clothing around
tho every way, poured kerosene around it
and set it on lire. Then I ran out into
the street - and went right over to
Ford's, but couldn't get in. 1 then Btarted
lor 1'iymouth. I didn't hear the fire bells
nor did I hear the woman eoream. I did
not know the hour until Jewell told me.
I supposed tho bodies might have been
destroyed. I have not seen Ford since
Friday night. Before I killed Mr. Ford
I ate supper with htm that night. They
had words at the table. I did not sea Mrs.
Ford again uulil the next morning. I
