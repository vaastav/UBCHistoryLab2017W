Army and 1
BY CAPT. ARTH1
T THE ARMY *
*
FACING the possibility of at least
a temporary discontinuation of
Army recruiting. It has been
suggested that the recruiting division,
with its efficient organisation,
exert its efforts in building up the national
and state guard and also recruit
for a National Reserve Corps, which.
Con cress recently authorised. The Re- |
serve Corps at present Is not in a coordinate
state. Methods of increasing
Its membership do not synchronize?
, each corps or branch of the Army acts
for itself in its own way. The recruiting
division of the Regular Army, as it
stands today, is a strong, energetic organization.
Its beneficial work is evidenced
by the large number of recruits
secured in every section of the country.
The energy and experience of the recruiting
division might be utilized as a
means of building up the present skeletonized
Reserve Corps to the quota deaired
by Congress.
Anthony on "Promotions."
That recent Army promotions will
not be confirmed by the committee
' on military affairs without due con- )
aideration is indicated by statements J
from members of Congress who are 1
giving the subject their attention. '
At the office of Representative Daniel
R. Anthony, Jr. (Kan.), a confirmation
was given to his recent state
lent in one of the leading service
papers, which read as follows:
"There is a feeling that the Intent
f Congress has not been faithfully
carried out by the War Department,
especially as to the provision that
at least 50 per cent of the new commissions
created should be from {
without the Regular Army. Under i
the way they have interpreted the [,
law they have arranged it so every .
graduate of West Point in the last';
live classes has been made a major. ,
All West Point graduates of over
live years' service will reach the grade
of major and all the rest probably
that of captain. In other words, the :
increased rank was not faiyly passed , i
around to the men who fought in
this war." i
Bearing out the West Point state- <
' ment of Mr. Anthony, the fact exists <
that hundreds of youngsters from the 1
academy have been pushed ahead eo i
fast during the past five years that
the percentage of appointees from <
the regular and emergency forces
will be left far behind tn future pro- j
motions. It is a lamentable fact that <
few of the emergency officers recently
appointed were given better than a
captaincy, although a number of t
them were men with years of pro- c
fessional, technical or business train- .
ing. which experience cost the government
absolutely nothing. On the I
other hand. West Pointers?for ex- I
. ample, the class of 1915?were young- t
Sters. educated at government ex- c
sense for a period of four years, dur- I r
ing which time they received the a
liberal pay of a cadet, and were ap- 7
pointed second lieutenants In' 1915, e
grst lieutenants in 1918. captains In c
1917 and majors in 1920. Their pres- n
nt pay. with allowances, is in ex- h
esse of 85.000 a year, or a sum great- b

Comment to rife aa to who will he t
. the next Secretary of War. It to t
J Stnown that many Army men would i
V prefer to oerve under a civilian Secre- f
tary. There ia some talk of the appointment
of Gen. Pershing or Wood t
and. under the law. either could be
appointed to the office by retiring j
from the Army or by being placed
on the inactive list without pay. Both
generals have their quota of friends ,
in and ojit of the service, who would ,
like to see their favorite occupying
the role of Secretary. It In known
that Gen. Pershing is close to President-elect
Harding, as Is also Gen.
Wood. The record made by Gen.
Pershing in the world war adds to
. his prestige as a prospective Secretary,
although eome of his friends
believe his popularity has not been
strengthened by heading the -recent
appointment board. The stand that
Gen. Wood took In promoting preparedness
prior to the war will be
one of hie chief assets for- the Secretaryship.
No intimation, however, has
come from Mr. Harding as to his
wishes regarding this portfolio and
hts decision may not be determined i
for some time. Iw event a civilian iaj
appointed Secretary the Army wilt he
specially interested aa to who will be
, the next thief of staff. There are
seme excellent general officers available
for this appointment and the
question of who will be chosen to fill
this office occasions more or less
general comment and surmise.
Borers to Supplaat Autos.
"In fifteen or twentr vears. when
the supply of gasoline la either (one
or the price too high for * person of
ordinary means, the horse will again
become a necessity in rural districts,
and future venerations will owe a
debt of gratitude to those who are
laboring against odds to preserve
good blood, especially In the riding
animals."
This is the gist of an article from
flu December issue of the Remount,
the official organ of the American Remount
Association, which depicts the
shortage of well bred riding horses,
particularly the type necessary In a
good cavalry horse. "It Is an extremely
important thing," the article
reads "for the United 8tates to have
? la the country an ample supply of
gsod cavalry horses. Indeed, the
lack of such animals would prove
disastrous In war. The remouat service
of the Quartermaster Corps hss
started Its breeding scheme In time

Its quality. It is being' helped in this
work by the American Remount and
other associations, by clubs and public-spirited
citlsens, who realise the
great importance of the work."
* Preach Gratitude.
Another evidence of Franco-American
friendship and cordial co-operation
between the French army and
the United States graves registration
service in France is the following letr
ter. received by the quartermaster general
from Gen. Nudant. commanding
the 7th Corps, which reads as follows:
"I wish to assure you that every
Frenchman will learn with gratitude
that you intend flying the French colors
by the side of the American flag
on Ail Saints day. It will be to us a
solemn and glorious thought that on
that day. the i?nory of the brotharaia-urma

reverent gathering that will stop with
a feeling of respect and gratitude before
the graves of the noble sons of
America, fallen on French soil, will
see with deep emotion the two.flags
flying together, symbol of FrancoAmerican
friendship."
Remount Activities.
In combining horse breeding with
agriculture in a peaceful valley of the
leuowstone?once notea ior us om?born
resistance against hostile Indians
? the War Department now
maintains one of its largest remount
depots, namely. Fort Keogh, Mont.
The land comprises some 60.000 acres,
upon which soil rich grasses grow
and horses thrive. This reservation
is under the direct charge of Lieut.
Col. Henry GibKons. The budget for
next year, when approved, will enable
the first steps to be taken toward permanent
agricultural development of
this land, under a system of intensive
irrigation. While the amount of hay
and grain now produced does not meet
the Army's demand, it establishes a
valuable medium through which a
large amount of feed is available each
year.
Communications from all parts of
the country continue to pour In to the
military committees of the Senate and
House from emergency officers who,
were injured on duty during the war.
asking that they be granted the same
pay as officers of the Regular Army
who were retired for illness or disability.
Now that the Navy is likely to
accede to a similar request, emergency
officers of the Army believe !h*t their
claims will be granted.
The ordnance department is conducting
a series of experiments look-|
ing to the development of caliber .30
armor-piercing ammunition with still
greater penetration than the present
type.
Steps have been taken by the quartermaster
general for the establishment
at the remount department.
Camp Dix, N. J., of a training school
for officers. It is proposed to send all
captains and lieutenants on duty in
the remount service to this school for
a basic course, the first class, not to
exceed ten officers, to start about January
1, 1921.
Members of the military and naval
forces of the nation were pleased to
note the sympathy and interest of
President Wilson, expressed In his
message to Congress, when he appealed
for more adequate facilities in the
eare and treatment of former members
of the service who are now sick
?r disabled.
