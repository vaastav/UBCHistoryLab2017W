PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Summary of President jlcKinley
^lossage to Congress.
Thc third annual message to C
gress of President William Melvin
submitted to that body December I
is the longest document yet issued
the President. Thc message will
tract widespread attention becaus*
deals with the new conditions brou
about by the accession of new te
tory resulting from the Spanish An
ican war, and because it will bc
garded as the plea ol' the Republl
party for the support of the Amerii
people in the presidential election
next year. That the message is int
esting throughout and is well wo
reading, despite its great length, th
is no doubt. It is given in full, w
for word, in The Journal to day,
mainlines are summarized below:
The president begins by stating tl
on the threshold of the deliberalic
of Congress the members are call
upon to mourn with their countrym
the death o:c Vice President Hoba
paying tribute to che worth of t
:'<r dead statesman.
The president next declares unqu
ifiedly for the gold standard. On-tl
momentous question, he says:
"I urgently recommend that to su
port the existing gold standard and
maintain 'the party value of the coi
of the t >vo metals (gold and silve:
and the equal power of every dollar
all times in the market and in tl
payment of dehts,' the secretary
the treasury be given additional pow
and charged with the duty to s<
United States bonds and to emph
such other effective means as may 1
necessary to these ends."
Mr. McKinley next discusses tl
subject' of an American merchat
marine, and earnestly recommenc
that steps bc taken by Congress i
encourage and aidintheestablishmer
of a great marine, seemingly endor
ing the proposed ship subsidy mo vt
ment without raying so clearly.
Perhaps there is no greater surpris
in the message than the President'
. reference to the trusts. He plac?
his administration squarely in opp(
sition to *he combinations of trade
On this s jject he says:
"Combinations of capital organize
into trusts to control the conditions c
trade among the citizens, to stifi
competition, limit production and de
termine the prices of products use*
and consumed by the people, are just
ly provoking public discussion am
should early claim tfhe attention o
Congress."
Coming to the Transvaal-Britisl
war, the President seemingly rebukei
in no uncertain tones the recent utter
anees of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
British colonial secretary, and Mr
Joseph Choate, United States ambas
sador to England, proclaiming thal
this country and England are practi
cally in alliance. The President re
affirms the time-honored doctrine
that this country shall remain free
from entangling foreign alliances. He
says:
"This government has maintained
an attitude of neutrality in the unfor
tunate contest between Great Britain
and the Boer States of Africa. We
have remained faithful to the precept
of avoiding entangling alliances as to
affairs not of our direct concern. Had
circumstances suggested that the par
ties to the quarrel would have wel
comed any kindly expression of the
hope of the American people that war
might be averted, good offices would
have been tendered."
Coming to the acquisition of Porto
Rico and discussing the Cuban ques
tion, the President dv ells on the des
tiny of both countries, recommending
the establishment of a civil govern
ment for Porto Rico as rapidly as pos
sible and the raising of the custom
duties on exports of that island. He
declares that the island of Cuba, which
is temporarily under the protection of
the United States, must be turned
over to the people of the is.'and as
soon as a stable government can bc
formed, reaffirming the purpose of
the government declared prior to the
Spanish war that the people of Cuba
would be given their freedom and the
yoke of Spanish rule swept away. He
says this pledge is of the highest hon
orable obligation and must be sacredly
kept. Then he speaks of the intimacy
which must exist between America
and Cuba and of the destiny of the is
land, declaring we must protect the
people.
The President relegated the Philip
pines question away to the rear of his
message, but it can be clearly discern
ed that he intends what he says on
this subject to be regarded as the
most important part of the document.
He begins on the question by referring
to the treaty of peace between Spain
and the United States signed Decem
ber 10th, 1898, by which Spain ceded
to this country the Philippine Islands
in consideration of $20,000,000 and
peace. He declares on this ques
tion:
"The islands were ceded by the
government of Spain, which had been
in undisputed possession of them for
centuries.
"They were accepted not merely by
our authorized agents in Paris under
i the direction of thc executive, but by
; the Constitutional and well considered
action of the Repr?sentative? of the
people in both houses of Congress. I
had every reason to believe and I stili
believe that this transfer of sovereign
ty was in accordance with the wishes
and the aspirations of the great mass
of the Filipino people.
"On the 21st of December, after the
treaty was signed, the commander of
the forces of occupation was instruct
ed to announce and proclaim in the
most public manner that we came, not
as invaders cand conquerors, but as
friends, to protect the natives in their
homes, in their employment and in
their personal and religious rights.' "
"It is enough to say that the claim
of the rebel leader that he was prom
ised independence by any officer of the
United States in return for his assist
ance has no foundation in fact and is
categorically denied by the very wit
nesses who were called to prove it.
The most the insurgent leader hoped
for ?vheo he came to Manila was the
liberation of the islands from thc
Spanish control, which they had been
laboring for years without success to
throw off.
"The future government of the
Philippines rests with the Congress of
the United States. If we accept them
in a spirit worthy of our race and our
traditions, a great opportunity comes
with them. The islands lie under the
shelter of our flag. They are ours by
every title of law and equity. They
cannot be abandoned. If we desert
them, we leave them at once to anar
chy and finally barbarism. "We fling
them, a golden apple of discord, among
the rival powers, no one of which
could permit another to seize them
unquestioned.
"Their rich plains and valleys
would be the scene of endless strife
and bloodshed. The advent of Dew
ey's fleet in Manila bay, instead of
being, as we hope, the dawn of a new
day of freedom and progress, will have
been the beginning of an era of misery
and violence worse than any which
has darkened their unhappy past.
The suggestion has bern made that
we could renounce our authority over
the islands, and giving them indepen
dence, could retain a protectorate
over them. This proposition will not
be found, I am sure, worthy of your
serious attention. Such au arrange
ment would involve at thc outset a
cruel breach of faith. It would place
the peaceful and loyal majority, who
ask for nothing better than to accept
our authority, at the mercy of the
minority armed insurgent. It would
make us responsible for the acts of
the insurgent leaders and give us no
power to control them. It would
charge us with the task of protecting
them against each other and defending
them against any foreign power with
which they choose to quarrel. In
short, it would take from the Congress
of the United States the power of de
claring war and vest that tremendous
prerogative in the Tagalo leader of
the hour.-Atlanta Journal.

MOKE BLOODSHED.
Desperate Fight Between Constables
and George Howard.
Col it mb ut State.
GREENVILLE, Dec. 5.-This after
noon between *i and 5 o'clock a desper
ate fight took place at thc bridge over
thc Southern railway on thc road to
Paris mountain, two miles from thc
heart of thc city, between Constables
Cornwell and Cooley of thc State
constabulary, and George Howard,
whose home is just outside the city
limits, on the duncombe road near
thc Sampson and Poe cotton mill. It
seems that Cornwell and Cooley were
ou the scent of whiskey wagons and
met George Howard with another man
coming from towards the mountains,
but there is no acurate information as
to what took place except that shoot
ing began without any unnecessary
delay, resulting in George Howard re
ceiving a mortal wound, Cornwell be
ing severely, if not fatally, wounded,
and Cooley receiving a shot through
the thigh. Cornwell was brought to
the Windsor hotel, where physicians
were called immediately and he was
put under the influence of chloroform.
He was suffering so much that he
could not give any account of thc
trouble, but said he felt certain that
shot from his pistol killed Howard.
This is said to be a mistake, however,
and that Howard is still alive, though
there is no hope for his recovery.
Cooley's wound is not considered
dangerous and he will probably sur
vive the combat.
The man who was with Howard is
unknown as yet, and it is said that he
made a quick escape.
Howard formerly lived in the Dark
Corner, but recently has made his
home near town. He is a cripple,
about 45 years old and has a family.
Later.-The shooting affray this af
ternoon took place in a piece of woods
near the Paris mountain road, just
before it crosses thc Southern railway.
George Howard was there with his
unknown companion, who had driven
a covered wagon into thc woods this
morning. The constables were out on
a raid, and circled around the wagon.
One of tnem discovered liquor kegs
and notified thc other. Cooley took
charge of the liquor and carried it to
his buggy, while Cornwell approached
the men. who were sitting on thc
ground before a fire near thc wagon.
The men surrendered without resis
tance and Howard says that Cornwell
took hold of him, at which he remon
strated, telling him that the liquor
belonged to thc other man, but that
Cornwell again seized him. After
saying this much he declined to talk
any more.
Cornwell has said that Howard in
formed him that he was not armed,
but that Howard opened fire on him,
which.he returned at close range, in
flicting five wounds, and when Howard
was found on the roadside by his
nephew his overcoat was afire from
the powder of Cornwell's pistol.
Cooley was putting a keg in the
buggy on the opposite side from where
the others were standing, and says he
was fired upon when his back was to
wards them. He thinks it was the
man who ran away that shot him, and
says the fire was repeated almost in
stantly. He raised up and fired a rifle
at Howard and then emptied his re
volver at him.
Howard was wounded five times, the
most serious of which is in the left
breast, just below the nipple, the
bullet going in straight, and the doc
tors are afraid to probe for it. He
was taken to his home on thc Poe hill,
and the physicians injected nitro-gly
cerine to keep his heart fcoing and
prevent a collapse, while they were
examining his wounds. It is thought
he cannot live through the night.
Cornwell's wounds are also consid
ered fatal, thc ball passing through
his intestines, and 'the physicians do
not express any hope of his recovery.
He was married about two months
ago in Chester county and his wife is
seriously ill at their home, which
caused him to be taken to thc hotel.
Cornwell walked about 50 yards on the
road to town before he fell, and when
Cooley found him on the side of the
road he was too weak to get into the
buggy. Cooley then hastened to town
for assistance, which was speedily
given.
Howard walked 100 yards before he
gave up and when his nephew came
to him on the roadside driving a wagon
out of town on his way home Howard
informed him very coolly that he had
been in a shooting scrape and was cer
tain that he had shot one of the con
stables.
Cornwell is unconscious at 10
o'clock and result is uncertain.
The Greenville News of the 8th
inst, says:
Two of the men engaged in Tues
day's battle between moonshiners and
dispensary constables died yesterday
from their wounds. Constable John
B. Cornwell, whose serious wound was
in his abdomen, expired at his room
in the Windsor hotel a few minutes
af ter 2 a. m.. and "Little George''
Howard, whose mortal wound was ;
his left chest near the heart, breathed
his last at the Poe mill village at 3 p.
m. Neither made a dying declara
tion.
