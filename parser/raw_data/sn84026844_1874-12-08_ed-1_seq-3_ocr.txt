President's Message.
To I he &na(e anil House of Jiepreientatices:
TilE 1'ROdTRATION Of UUSIX1M9.
Sinco the convening of Congress one
year ago the nation han undergone a ]>roaIration
in lmaine-M nnil iniluntrina quaI. ?u
has not been witnessed with us for many
years. Speculations as to the causes for
this prostration might ho indulged in
without profit, because as many theories
will ho advanced us there woulu be independent
writers-?those who expressed
their own views without borrowing upon
the subject. Without indulging in theories
.n to the cause of this prostration theretore,
1 will call your attention'only to the
fact and to some plain questions as to
which it would seem there should be no
disagreement. During this prostration
two essential elements of prosperity have
lieen most abundant.
LA 110It AND CAPITAL
Hotli have been largely unemployed.
Where security has been undoubted capital
has been attainable at very moderate
rates. Where labor has been wanted it has
been found in abundance at cheap rates as
compared with the cost of the necessaries
and comforts of life which could he purchased
with the wages demanded. Two
great elements of prosperity, therefore,
have not been denied iih, to which n third
might be added,
TIIE CAPACITY OF THE .SON..
< hir .toil is unequalled within the limits
of any contiguous territory under one nation
for its variety of productions with
which to feed and clothe a people, and in
the uinountof surplus to spare to feed less
favored peoples. Therefore, with those
facts in view, it seems that wise statesmanship
at this session of Congress would dictate
legislation ignoring the past and directing
in proper channels these great
dements of prosperity to any people.
DEBT AND CREDIT
is the only element that can with a sound
c urrency enter into our affair* to cause any
continued depression in the industries and
prosperity of our people.
CURRENCY.
A great conilict for national existence
made necessary for temporary purposes
the raising of large sums of money from
whatever source attainable. It made necessary,
in the wisdom of Congress?and 1
do nut doubt their wisdom in the premises
(regarding the"necessities of the times) to
devise a system of national currency, which
it proved to be impossible to keep on a par
witn the recognized currency of the civil
ized world. This begot a spirit of speculation
and extravagance and luxury not
required for the happiness or prosperity
( f a people, and involving, both directly
and indirectlv, foreign indebtedness. The
currency, being of fluctuating value, and
therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate
transactions requiring money, became a
subject of speculation in itself. These two
causes, however, have involved us in a
foreign mdebtedoov. contracted in good
faith by borrower and lender, which should
be paid according to the bond agreed upon
when the debt was contracted, in gold or
its equivalent. The good faith of the
lioverninent can not be violated toward
creditors without material disgrace.
COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURES.
Our commerce should be encouraged,
the American ship building and carrying
capacity increased, foreign markets sought
for the products of the soil and the manufacturer,
to the end that we may be able to
pay those debts. Where a new market
can be created for the sale of our products,
either of the soil the mine, or the manufactory,
a new means is discovered of
utilizing our idle capital and labor to the
advantage of the whole people. Hut, in
my judgment, the first step towards accomplishing
this object is to secure
A CURRENCY GOOD WHEREVER CIVILIZATION
REIGNS?
one which whenever it becomes^ super a
uununni wiui one people vmi una a market
with some other?a currency which
has as iIs basis the labor necessary to j>roduce
it, which will give to it its value.
Gold and flilver are now the recognized
mediums of exchange the civilized world
over, ami to this we should return with the
least practicable delay. In view of the
pledges of the American Congress when
our present legal tender system was adopted,
there should be no delay, certainly no 1
unnecessary delav, in fixing by legislation
a method by which we will return to specie. 1
To the accomplishment of this end I invite
your especial attention. 1 believe
firmly that there can be no prosperous and 1
permanent revival of business and industries
until a policy is adopted, with legislation
to carry it out, looking to a return to
a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that
the debtor and speculative classes may
think it of value to them to make so-called
money abundant until they can throw a
|>ortion of their business on others, but
even these, I believe, would be disappointed
in the result if a course should be pursued
which will keen in doubt the value of
the legal tender medium of exchange.
A REVIVAL OK PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRY
is needed by all classes?by nono more
than the holders of property, of whatever
sort, with debts to liquidate by realization
upon its sale. Hut admitting that
these two classes of citizens are to be benefitted
by expansion, would not the general
l(oss be too great to justify such relief?
Would it not be just as honest and prudent
to authorize each debtor to issue his own
legal lenders to tho extent of lus liabilities
as to do this ? Would it not be safer, for
fear of over-issues by unscrupulous creditors,
to ?ay that all debts and obligations
are obliterated in the United States, and
now arc we to commenco anew, each possessing
all he has at the time free from incumbrance?
These positions are too absurd
to bo entertained for a moment by
thinking or honest people; yet every delay
in tho preparation for final resumption
Partakes of this dishonesty, and onlv
hysons the hope that a convenient day will
:jt last arrive for the good work of redeeming
our pledges.
IT WILL NEVER COMB,
in my opinion, except ly positive action
by Congress or by national disasters which
will destroy, for a time at least, the credit
<>f the individual and the State at large.
A sound currency might be reached, uy
total bankruptcy and discredit of the nation
and of the individual. I believe it is
the duty of Congress at this session to devise
Huch legislation ax will renew confidence,
revive industries, start us on a career
of prosperity to last for many years,
and ho save tho credit of this nation and
of this people. Steps toward a return to
a ?l?ecie basis are the great requisites devotedly
to be sought for, aud there nre
other*, which I may touch upon hereafter.
A nation dealing in a currency below that
of snecie in valae, labors under two great
disadvantages. First, having no use for the
world'a acknowledged medium of ex
change, gold and nilver, tlieso are drivei
out of tUo country, because there in no do
inand for their use; second, tlio mediun
of cxehango in use being of tluctu
ating value?for, utter all, it really ii
only worth just what It will purchase o
gold and siver mctalfl, having,an Intrluaii
value just Id proportion to the honest labor
It takes to produce tliutn, a large:
margin must bo allowed lor prollt by tli(
manufacturer and producer. It is month
Irom tlio date of production to the dato o
realization; interest upon capital must bi
charged and the risk ol fluctuation in tin
value of that which is to bo received It
payment jndded, lletico high prices ac
as a protection to tlio loreign produce]
who receives nothing in exchange lor tin
products ol his skill and labor exceptloi
a currency good at a stable value tlx
world over, It Beems to mo that nothing
Is clearer than that the greater part of the
burden ot the existing prostration Is for
THE WANT OK A B0UKD FINANCIAL SYSTEM
tho evil of which falls upon the
working man. who must after all pro
duce the wealth and the salaried tnau
who superintends ami conducts business.
The burden tails upon them
in two ways, by the deprivation ol employment
aud the decreased purchasing
power ol their salaries. It is the duly ol
Congress to devise the method ol correctting
the evils which are acknowledged to
exist and not mine, hut 1 will veuture to
suggest two or three things which seem
to me as absolutely necessary to a return
to specie payments. As a first great requisite
to a return to prosperity, tho legal
tender clause to the law authorizing the
issue ol;currency by the National Government
should ha rpnpatM tn tulm > UD
to all contracts entered iuto after a day
lixed by tho repealing act, not to apply,
however to tho payment of salaries by the
Government, or tor other .expenditures
now provided by law to be paid in currency
lu tho interval pending between the
repeal and tbe tlnal resumption. Provision
should bo mado by -which the Secretary
ot tho Treasury can obtain gold hb it may
become necessary Irom time to time,
from tho date when specie redemption
commences. To tbia might and should
be added a revenue sulllciently in excess
of the expenses to insure an accumulation
of gold iu tho Treasury to sustain tbe redemption.
1 commend this subject to
your careful consideration, believing that
a favorable solution ia attainable, and
that il reached by tliid Uongress the present
and luture generations will ever gratefully
remember it aa their deliverer
from a thraldom of evil and disgrace.
With resumption, Irce banking may be
authorized with salety, giving the lull
protection to bill holders which they
have uuder the existing laws. Indeed,
I would regard free banking hs essential.
It would give proper elasticity to the
currency, as more currency should be required
for tho trauBttdio.i of legitimate
business. New banks would be started,
and in turn the old banks would wind up
their business, when it was found tint
there was a superabundance of currency.
The experience and judgment uf the pen
pie ctn best decide Jvist bow much
currency is required for tbe transaction ol
the business 01 tho country. It is unsafe
to leave the settlement of this question to
Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and tho Executive Congress should
make tho regulations uuder which banks
may exist, but should not make banking
a monopoly by limiting the amount ol
redeemable paper currency that shall be
authorized. Such importance do 1 attach
to this subject, and sr? earnestly do 1
commend it to your attentlou, that 1 give
it prominence by introducing it at the
beginning of the message.
f0hb10n iiblations.
During the past year nothing 1ms oc
curred to disturb the general friendly and
cordial relations of tbe United States with
other powers. The correspondence submitted
herewith between this government
and ila diplomatic representatives, as also
with the representatives ol other countries,
shows a satisfactory condition ol all
questions between tbu United Mates and
ine moat of these countries, and with lew
exceptions, to which rclerenco will hereafter
be made, there is an absence ol any
points nt dilierence to hj adjusted. The
notice directed by tbe resolution of Congress
ol June 17th, 1874, to be given to
terminate the convention of July 17th,
185$, between the United States and Belgium,
has beeu given, and the treaty accordingly
terminates on the 1st dny of
July, 1S75 The convention secured to
certain Belgian vessels entering the ports
of the United States exceptional privileges
which are not accorded to our
own vessels. Olbcr features ol the
convention have proved satislactory, and
have tended to the cultivation ol
ot mutual, beneficial, commercial intercourse
and Iriendly relations between tbe
two countries. 1 hope that the negotiations
which have been invited will result
in tbe celebration ol another treaty which
may tend to the interests ol both countries.
Our relations with China continue
to be Iriendly during tho past year, and
the fear of hostilities between China and
Japan, growing out of the landing of an
armed force upon tlio Island of Formorsa,
by the latter, has occasioned much uneasiness.
It is earnestly hoped, however,
that tho difficulties arrising Irom this
causo will he adjusted, aud that tho advance
of civilization in theeo Empirrs
mcy uot be retarded by a state o! war. In
const queucc of the part taken by certain
citizens ol the United States in tin's expedition
our representatives in those
countries have been instructed to impress
upon the governments of China and
Japan tho firm intention ol this country
to maintain strict neutrality io the event
of hostilities, and to carelully prevent any
infraction of law on the part olourcit
izcuB.
CITINBSU IMMUIIIVTION.
In connection with this subject 1 call
the attention ol Congress to a generally
conceded fact that the great proportion of
the Chinese immigrauts who have comc to
our shores do not come voluntarily to
make their homes with U9 and their laoor
productive ol general prosperity, but come
under contract with head men who own
them almost absolutely. In a worse form
docs this apply to Chineso women partic*
ularly. A very small percentage of them
perform any honorable labor, but they
aro brought for shameful purposes to the
disgrace ol the communities where settled
end the great demoralization of tho youth
of thoso localities If this evil practice can
be legislated against, it will be my
pleasure as wen as my uuiy loenmrce
any rCBUlalion to sccure so desirable an
cnu.
.1 Al'AN.
It is hoped that negotiations between
tho Government of Japan and the treaty
powers looking to tho further opening "f
tho empire and to tho removal 01 various
restrictions upon Irade and travel may
soon producu tho results desired, which
cannot fail to enure to tho benefit ol all
parties. Having on previous occasions
submitted to tho consideration of Congress
tho propriety of the roleaso ol tho Japanese
Government from further payment
ot tho indemnity under tho Convention of
October 22d, 180-1, and as no action had
been taken thereon, it becamo my duly
to regard tho obligation ol tho Convention
as in force, and as tho olher powers
interested had received their proportion
of tho indemnity in lull, tbo Minister ol
tho United States in Japan has in behalf ol
this government received tho remainder
of the amount due the United Stales
under the convention of Simonascki. 1
submit the propriety ol applying tho income
of a part, if not tho whole, ol this
Itind to tho education In tho Japineto language
ol a number ot young men to bo
under obligations to serve the government
for a specified time ai Interpreters
at the Legations and Consulates In Jspun.
i A limited number of Japanese youths
- might at the simo tiuio be educated In
1 our own vernacular, and mutual benefits
'would rejult to both governments, The
i Importance ol having our own clliasua
I lamiliar with the languago of Japan aud
. act as Interpreters and In other cipacitlcs
. conncctod with Legations and Consulates
r in that country, cannot readily bo over,
estimated.

against the United Stales arising from acts
committed against these persons and their

pears i quitablu that an opportunity should
be ollered to citizens of other States to
present their claims as well as to '
thoso British subjects, whose claims were
not admissable under tho late)cotnmisslon, '
to the early decision ol some competent
tribunal. To this end 1 recommend tho
necessary legislation to organlso a court

and tho departments from the consideration
of this question.

T10N9. ii
There has been uo material change in t|
our reunions wuu me inuepenaem Diates (j
ol this hemisphere, which were formerly s)
uuder the dominion of Spaiu. Marauding j,
on the frontiers between Mexico and tj
Texas still frequently takes place despite ,(
the vigilance or the civil and military au- C(
thoritiea in that quarter. Thedifllculty ol f,
checking such trespasses along the course n
of a river of such length as the Uio n
Grande and so olten not lordable is obvious.
It is Loped that the efforts of the T
government will be eeconded by those ol
Mexico to the effectual suppression ol the
acta ol wrong. Upon the condition ol the el
business beforo the American and Mexl- o
can Joint Claims Commissions made by li
the agent on the part of the United States ;t
und dated October 28, 1874, it appears il
that of the 1,017 claims filed uu the part h
ol citizens of tho United States 483 had <1
been finally decided and 75 wero in the tr
hands ot the umpire, leaving 402 to be
disposed of, and of the 1)93 claims filed
against the United States 720 bad been
finally decided. Ono was before the um- 1
piro and 271 remained to be disposed of. K
Since the date of such report other claims "
nave ocen awposeu o?, reducing some- y
what the number still pending,and others 1:1
have been passed upon by the arbitrators. 01
It has become apparent in view ol these P
figures and ol the fact that the work de- 1
volviug on the umpire is particularly la- "
borious, that the Commission would bo
unable to dispose of the entire number ol s;
claims pending prior to the lirst day of 1.
February, 1870, the date fixed lor its ex- l'
pi ration. Negotiations are pending look- w
log to the scouring ot the results of the ?
decisions which have been reached, and to u
a lurther extension of the Commission for
a limited time, which, it is confidently t<
hoped, will biittlce to bring all the busi- w
nesa now before it to a final close. Tho o
strife in the Argentine Republic is to be a
deplored, both on accouut ol the parties tl
there and from the probable ifleets on the c<
interests of those engaged in the trade to o
that quarter, ol whom the United States o
are among the principal. As yet, so w
lar as 1 am aware, there has been tl
no violation of our neutrality rights, ti
which as well as our duties in that res- w
pect, it sIihII be my endeavor to maintain w
and observe It is with regret I announce o
that no farther payment has been receiv- u
cd from the Government ol Venezuela, on fi
account of awards in favor of the citizens b
ol the United States. lIope9 have been >v
entertained that if that Republic could 1,
escape both foreign and civil4war for a ti
few years, its great natural resources \t
would enable it to honor its obligations.
Though it is now understood to be at
nPHm? with other countries). h serious in- ...
surrection islreported to bo in progress in
an interior region ol that Republic. This
maybe taken advantage of, as another ?
reason to delay the payment of the dues I1
ol our citizens. The deplorable strife in ?
Cuba continues without any marked 11
chango in thu relative advantages of tho I'
contending forces, and tho Insurrection 11
still continues liut Spain has gained no n
superiority in six years of strife, and thus ?
gives the insurrection a signilicanco h
which cannot bo denied. Its duration r
and the tendency of its advance, together I'
with the absencc of the raanilestcd power I)
ol suppression on tho part ol Spain can- r
not be controverted and may take some p
positive steps on tho part ol other powers t:
a matter ol necessity, I had confl- C
dently hoped at this time to bo ablo to an- t:
nounco tho arrangement ol somo ol the t
important questions between this govern- t
meat and that of Spain, but Ibo ncgotia- a
Hons bavo been protracted, The unhappy a
intestine dlssentlons ol Spain command n
ourprolound sympathy and must bo ac- o
ccpted as perhaps a causo ol somo delay. c
An early settlement in part, at least, ol the \
questions between tho governments is *
hoped. In the meantime, awaiting tho re- t
salt ol immediately pending negotiations, i
I doler a further and fall communication f
on tho subjcct ol tho relations ol this coan- f
try and Spain.
EXPATRIATION LAWS. 1
I have again to call the attention ol Con- c
grcss to llie unsatisfactniy condition of the
existing lint with reference to tbe expatriation
and the election of nationality.
Formerly amid conflicting opinions and
decisions it was difllcult to exactly determine
bovr lir the doctrine of perpetual
alleglanco was applicable to citizens of
tbe United Btates. Congrew by tho act ol
the 27lh of July, 1803, asserted tho abstract
riglitol expatriation is a fundamental
principle ot this government Notwithstanding
this assertion and the necca
sity ol a formal application of the principle,
no legislation has been had defining
what acta or formalities shall work
expatriation, or when a cii'z n shall be
deemed to have renounced or lost bis citizenship,the
importance ol such dcllnition
is obvious. Tho representatives ol tho
United Slates in iorelgn countries aro continually
called upon to lend their aid and
tho protcctionof the United States to persons
concerning tho good faith or tho roality
of whose citizenship there is at least
question. In somo eases tbe provisions
ol the treaties furnish somoguide, in others
it seems as il lelt to persons claiming
tho benefit of citizenship while living in a
foreign country, contributing in no manner
to the performance of the duties ot a
citizen ol tbo United Btates and wilhDUl
the intention at any time to return aud
undertake those duties, to use tho claims
:>! citizenship or tho United States simply
is a shield Irom the perlormanco ol the
jbligatlons ol a citizsn elsewhere. Tbe
status of children, burn of American parents
residing in a foreign country, ol
American women who have been married
;o aliens, of American citizens residing
ibroad whore such questions arc not regilated
by n treaty, are all questions ol Irepient
dilliculty. Tho decision of and
egislation on these and similar questions,
larticularly defining when and under
vliat circumstances expatriation can be
iccomplisbed, are to ba presumed cspec
any necueu in inia coddcciiod. l caricetly
call tho attention of Congress to
be difilcultlcs arising irom
FRAUDULENT NATURALIZATION.
The United States wisely, freely and
i be rally oilers its citizenship to all who
nay come in good faith to reside within
ts limits, on their complying with certain
described reasonable and simple t'ormaliies
and conditions. Among the highest
lutics of the Government is that to allord
irm, ellicient and equal protection to all
ts citizens who are native bom or naturalzed.
Care should be taken that a right
tarrying with it such support from the
lovernment be not fraudulently obtained,
ind should be bestowed only upon full
iroof of a compliance with the law, and
et there are frequent instances of illegal
ind fraudulent naturalization and of the
inatithorized use of certificates thus imiroperly
obtained. In some cases the
raudulent character of the naturalization
1:1s appeared upon the face of the certiO*
ate itself, iu others examination discloses
hat the holder had not complied with the
aw, ami in others certificates have been
ihtained where the persons holding them
tot only were not entitled to be naturalled,
but had not been within the United
itates at the time of the pretended naturalnation.
Instances of each of these classes
f frand have been discovered at our legaions,
where certificates of naturalization
re presented either for the purpose of
btaining passports or of demanding the
irotectiou of the legation. When fraud
i apparent on the face of such certificates
hey are taken up by the representative of
lie Government and forwarded to the Deinrtment
of State; but even the record of
lie port in which the fraudulent naturaliation
occurred remains and duplicate cerificates
are readily obtainable. Upon pre- i
intation of these for the issue'of passports i
r in demanding the protection of the
iovernmeut, the fraud sometimes es? 1
apes notice, and such certificates arc not 1
nfrequent iu transactions of business, to
lie deception and injury of innocent par- :
ice. "Without placing any additional ob?
lacles in the way of the obtainiuent of cit'.ensliip
by the worthy and well-inten- ,
ioned foreigner who comes in good faith (
) cast his lot with our.*, 1 earnestly re- ,
oiuineni further legislation to punish (
audulcnt naturalization and to secure the (
iiady cancellation of the record of every
aturalization made in fraud. RKATIK3
OF EXTRADITION AND COM- (

liange has been made of the ratification <
f treaties of extradition with Belgium, 1
leuador, Peru and San Salvador; also of 1
treaty of commerce inid consular priv- f

TREASURY MATTERS.
The report of the Secretary of the
'reasury, which is made directly to Conress
and which forms no part of
lis message, will .show the receipts and
xpenditurcs of the .Government for the
ist liscol year, the amount received from
ach source of revenue, and the amount
aid out for each of the departments of
ic Government. It will be observed from
lis report that the amount of receipts
vcr the expenditures has been but $2,811,82
for the fiscal year ending June 80th,
$74, mid that for the current year the esmated
receipts over the expenditures
ill not much exceed $1),000,00(5. In view
f the large national debt existing and the
bligatious to add one per cent per annum
)tho sinking fund?a sum amounting now
) over ?800,000 per annum?1 submit
hether revenues should not he increased
r expenditures diminished to reach this
mount of surplus. Is'ot to provide for
ic sinking fund is a partial failure to
omnly with the contracts and obligations
f the Government. At the last session
f Congress a very considerable reduction
as made in the rates of taxation and in
:ie number of articles submitted to taxaon.
The question may well be asked
'hether or not in sonic instances thisjwas
ise. In connection with this subject
f funding, J am of the opinion that the 1
leans of collecting revenue, especially
oni imports, have been so embarrassed 1
y legislation as to make it questionable
hether or not large amounts are not lost
y a failure to collect, to the direct loss of
io 'Pronoun* nnd tu tnvoiiulino nf iJin
ltcresta oi' honest importers and tax^yers.
Tho Secretary of the Treasury, in his
jport, favors legislation looking to

economy in appropriations, calls
ttention to the loss of revenue from reealing
the tax on tea and coflee without

n increase of 10 cents per gallon on
dusky; and further, that no modification

modification should become necessary
y reason of the adoption of the Treasurer's

lie same time decrease the number of ariclcs
upon which duties are levied. Those

TUB AIIMY AND NAVY.
The report ol tho Secretary ol War,
herewith attached, and forming a part ol
this message, gives all tho information
concerning tho operations, wants and necessities
ol tho army, and contains mauy
suggestions and recommendations which
1 commend to your attention. There is
no class ol Government employes who
are harder worked than tho army officers
ana men; nono who perform their tasks
more cheorfully and clHciently, under
circumstances or great privations and
hardships. It is desirable to render more
clllcient this branch of the public service.
All tho.recoratnendationsol the Secretary
of War I regard us judicious, and I
specially commend to your attention the
following: Consolidation of Government
I arsenals; the restoration ol mileage
to olllcera traveling under orders;
the exemption of money received from
the sale of subsistence stores from being
covered into tho Treasury; the use of appropriations
lor subsistence stores without
waiting lor tho beginning ol tho fiscal
year for which tho appropriations are
made; for additional appropriations for
tho collection ol torpedo material; lor increased
appropriations in the manufacture
ol arm?; lor relieving the States from indebtedness
lorartn9 charged to them during
tho rebellion; for dropping olllccrs
from tho rolls of the army without trial
lor the offense of drawing pay more than
once lor tho same period; for the discouragement
of tho plan of paying soldiers by
checks; and tho establishment ol a professorshipof
rhetoric and English literature
at West Point.
Tho reason lor these recommendations
are obvious, and are sot forth Bulllciently
in tho report attached.
1 also recommeudthat the stall'corps ol
tho army be fixed,where this has not been
done, so that promotions may be made,
and vacancies tilled as they occur in each
grade when reduced below the number to
be lixed by law. The necessity for such
a regulation is specially felt now in tho
pay department. The number ol olllcera
in that department is below tho number
adequate to the performance ol the duties
required of thein by law. The efficiency
of the Navy hns bscn largely increased
during the last vear under the imntilsn
ot the foreign complications which threat
enctl us at the commencement ot the lust
session o! Congress. Most ol our dllclent
wooden ships were put in condition for
immediate service and the repair ot our
Iron Clad tl .ct were pushed with the
utmost vigor. The result is that the
most ol these are now in an ilU'Ctive
state and need only to be manned and
put in commission to go at once into
service. Some ot the new eloop3 authorized
by Congress are already in commission,
and the most ol the remainder
are launched and only wait the completion
of their machinery to enable them to
take their places ns part ol our cllective
force. Two iron torpedo ships have been
completed during the lust year, and lour
of our large double turretted Iron Ulads
are now undergoing repairs. When these
are linished everything that is useful ol
our Navy as now authorized, will bu in i
condition for service, and with the advance
in the science of torpedo warfare,
the American Navy, comparatively small
as it it?, will be lound at any time power- i
lul enough for the purpose ol a peacelul I
nation. i
SCIENTIFIC AND QBNKUAL KNOWLRDOK. 1
Much has also been accomplished during
the year in aid of science and to inirease
the sum of general knowledge and ,
turthcr the interests ol commerce and
livillzitiou. Extensive and much needed
joundings have been made lor hydro*
graphic purposes. and to fix the proper
routes lor ocean telegraphs. Further
surveys of tho great Isthmus have been
lndcrtaken and completed, and two vessels
ol the navy are now employed, in
lonjunction with those of England,
France, Germany and UnssU. in observations
connected with transit of Venus,
?o useful Hud interesting to tho scientific
world. The estimates for this branch ol
.he public service do not differ materially
from those ol last year?those lor the
general support ot the service being Rome*
what lew, and those for permanent improvements
at the various stations rather
arger than the corresponding estimate
Made a year ago. For the regular maintenance,
and steady increase in iho efficiency
of thi3most important arm, in proportion
to tho growth ol our maritime interests
and intercourse, it is recommended
:o the attention of Congress that the use of
he Wavy in lime ol peace might be lur;her
utilized by a direct authorizition of
:he employment of naval vessels in experiments
and surveys ol supposed navigable
waters ol other nationalities on thiB Con*
tiuent, especially the tributaries of the
two great rivers ol South America, the
Oronoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevents,
under the existing laws, such nn
jxploration, except that ihc expenditures
must bo mado in such expeditions beyond
those usually provided lor in the
ippropriations. The field designated is
unquestionably one of interest,' and one
:apable of large developments of commersial
interests advantageous to the people '
reached and to those who may establish .
relations with tbem.
Education ol the people entitled to the j
exorcise of the right of Iranchise I regard '
is essential to general prosperity cwry- 5
where, and especially so in Hepublics, '
where neither education or previous con- 1
ilitlon enters into account in giving sulIrage.
Next to the public schools the '
Postofflce is the great agent of cdncalion
over our vast territory. The rapidity '
with which new sections are being setlied,
thus increasing the carrying of the 1
mails in a more rapid ratio than the increase
of receipts, is not alarming
l'JLTAt, AFFAIRS.
The report ol the Postmaster General, i
herewith attached, shows that there was
au increase ol revenue in this dcparlment
In 1H7II over the previous year of fl,071,411,
and an increase ol the cost ol
carrying the mails by paying employes ol
J!101,14tl.8!U. The report ol the Postmaster
General gives interesting statis
ties ol bis department, and, comparing
them with the corresponding statistics ol
a year ago, they show a growth in every
branch ol the department
A postal convention has been concluded
with New South Wales, an exchange ol
postal cards established with Switzerland,
and the negotiations pending for several
years past with France have terminated
in a convention with that country which
went Into (.fleet laBt August. An international
postal congress was convened In
lierne.Switzsrlaud, in September last, at
which the United Stales was represented
by an officer ol tho Postofflce Department
of much experience and of qualifications
(or the position. A convention for the
establishment ol an international postal
union was agreed upon and signed by the
delegates of tho countries represented,
Bubject to the approval ot the proper authorities
ol those countries.
1 reipectlully direct your attention to
tho icport of tho Postmaster General and
his suggestions in regard to an equitable
adjustment of the question ot the compensation
ol railroads lor carrying the
mails.
Till SOUTHERN STATU.
Your attention will be drawn to the
unsettled condition ol nlliirs In gome ol
the Southern States. On tbe 14th of September
last tbo Governor ol Louisiana
called upon mo, as provided by tho Constitution
and lawsol the United Slates,
to aid hltn in suppressing tbo domestic
vlolonco In tliat State. This call was
made In vie* ol a proclamation issued on
tbat day, by 1). 1>. 1'enn, claiming that
be was elected Lieutenant-Governor in
ISiJ, und call log upon the militia ol the
State to arm, assemble and drive Irom
power tbe usurpers, as bo designated the
otllcers ol tho State government, 'l'lio next
day I Issued uty proclamation command'
ing tbe Insurgents to disperse witbin Ave
days from I tie date tbereot, and subsequently
learned tbat on that day tbey
had taken forcible possession ol the State
House. Steps were takcu by 1110 to sup- 1
port tbo existing and recognized State
government, but before tbe expiration ol
tbe live days tbo insurrectionary movement
was practically abandoned and the
olllccrs ol tho Btato government, witb
some minor exceptions, resumed their
powers and duties. Considering that the
present Slate administration of Louisiana
has been tbo only government in tbat
State for nearly two years, that it has
been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced
in as such by Congress, and moro than
once expresily recognized by mo, I regarded
it as my clear duty, when legally
called upon for that purpose, to prevent
its overthrow by an armed mob under
pretence ol Iraud and irregularity iu the
election ol 1971 1 have herololorc called
tho attention of Congress to this subject,
stating tbat on account of tbe frauds and
forgeries committed at said election, and
because it appears tbat the returns thereof
were never legally canvassed, it was
impossible to tell thereby who were
chosen. Hut from the lirst sources ol inlormatton
at my command I have always
believed thepreecnt State olllcera received
a majority ol tbe legal votes actually
cast at that election. 1 repeat what I
said in my special message of February
2M, 1873, that in tho eventof no action
by Congress I must continue to recogniz?
the government heretofore recognized by
mo "
1 regret to say that with the prop.ira- il
tions lor the latu election deeidea indica- p
lions appeared in some localities in the 11
Southern States ol a determination, by
acts or violence and intimidation to deprive
citizens of the freedom ol the bal- p
lot, heeause ot their political opinions. ,|
Bands ot men, masked und armed, made e]
their appearance: white leagues and other
societies wore lormcd; large quantities a]
of arms aud ammunition wero im- t|
ported and distributed to these organize b
lions; military drills, with menacing de- jr
inonsirationB, were held, aud with all jt
these murders euongh wero committed |j
to spread terror among those whose po- c)
litical action was to be suppressed, if pos- j
sible, by these intolerant sad criminal u
proceedings. In some placcs colored la- u
borers were compelled to vote according
to the wishes ol iheir employers under
threats ol a discharge, if they acted otherwise,
and there aro too many instances in 11
which when these threats were disregard* Jj|
ed they were remorselessly executed by 1
those who made them. I understand m
that the Ffteenth amendment to the Con- P
stitution Wd9 made to prevent this and a 111
tike Biato ol things, and the act ol May 1,1
31, 1870, with amvudments, was issued to
enlorce its provision?, the object of both 05
being to guarantee to all citizens the ^
right to vole and to protect them in the
Iree enjoyment ol that right. Enjoined by !r
the Constitution to take care that the laws 1U
be faithfully executed, and convinced by P(
undoubted evidence that the violations ol j*
said act had been committed and that a 1(1
wide spread and flagrant disregard ot it
was contemplated, the proper officers [c
were instructed toprosccntcthc cftenders [e
and troops were stationed at convenient 'f
points to aid these ofllcers if necessary in 11
[he periormance ot their olHcial duties.
Domplaintsare made of this interference
by Jfederal cfli2ial authority; but if said Jr
intendment and act do not provide lor "
such interference under the circumstances
19 above stated, then they are without l)<
meaning, force or effect, and the whole
scheme of colored cnlranchisemcnt is e,1
worse than mockery and littlo better than
i crime. Possibly Congress may find it due
to truth and juaiicc to ascertain by means P1
3f a committee whether the alleged wrongs >"(
to colored citizens for political purposes
ire realtor tbe^rcports thereof were manmacturcd
for the occasion. The whole 11
number of troops in the States of Louis- l?-'
iana, Alabama, Georgio, Florida, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, ?
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland
and Virginia at the times ot the el- ?1'
jction were -1.082, Ibis embraces the gar- ,n
risona o! all the forts from the Delaware
lo the Gull of Mexico. Another trouble 8*'
ias risen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the m
Constitution of the State which was 6U
idoptcd io 1S03 and upon the approval ot u:
which by Congrcps the State was restored ?|
,o its representation as one ot the States p'
)f the UnioD. It provides in cffect that iu
joforo any amendments proposed to the
Jonstitution shall become a part thereof, 1,1
hey shall be passed by two successive
issemblies, ratitied by a majority of the
.'lectors of the Stato voting thereon. On rj,
he 11th of May 1874 the Governor con- KC
zoned an extra session ol the General pi
Assembly ot the State, which, on the 18th
)f the same month passed an act provid- T'c
ng lor a convention to frame a new Constitution
pursuant to this act, and at the
.'lection held on the 30th of June 1374 the ?8
Jonstitution was approved und dele-gates
were chosen thereto, who assembled on J:
:ho 11th ol last July aud formed a new V
Jonstitution, the schedule of which pro- ? j
srided lor the election ot an entire new f
jet of State officers, iu a manner c mtrary
to the then existing election laws ot that
Statu. On the lUtti of October, 1874, this
Donatitution, aa therein provided, was se
submitted to the people for their approval Li
:>r re jection, and according to the election w
returns was approved by a lt?rge majority m
ol tho&c <|uulitled to vote thereon, and hi
it the 6!ime election persona were chosen to
[o till ull the State, couuty and township in
Dfllces The Governor elected in 1872 di
lor the term of lour years turned over his 0
ofiioe to the Governor chosen under the re
new Constitution, whereupon the Lieu- su
tenant Governor, also elccted in 1872 for a;
* term ot 4 year?, claiming to act as ir
Governor, and alleging tint said pro- at
seeding*, t>y which the new Constitution ly
was made and a new set of officers ai
elected, were unconstitutional, illegal at
and void, called upon me ad pro- rt
vided in section 4, article 4 ol the gi
Constitution to protect the State against vi
domestic violence. As Congress is now st
investigating the political ?>ir?ira of C
Arkansas, 1 have declined to*interfere, la
The whole fubject of Executive inter- re
ferencc with the nlhirn ol a State is rej?ug*
nant to the public opinion, to the feeling e:
ol those who liotn tneir (llhial capacity fn
must bo used in such interposition, anil Hi
to him or those who must direct. Unless at
most clearly on the eido ol law, such gi
interference becomes a crime, and, with at
the law to support it, is condemned with- hi
out a hearing. I desire therelore tliit all tfc
necessity for Executive direction in local si
aflaircjimy bccome unnecessary and ubso- w
lete. 1 invito the attention not only of it
Congress, but ol the people oi the United tc
States, to the causes and ctlcets of these is
unhappy questions. Is there not a dis- si
position 011 one side to maguify these pi
wrongs and outrages, and on the other tc
to belittle or justify them? If the public el
could bo directed to & correct purvey of ti
what is right, and to rebuking wrong and at
tiding the proper authorities In punishing bc
it, a better etato of feeling would bo in- re
r.ulcated, and the sooner we would have fe
that peace which would leave the mates ol
free indeed, to regulate their own do- u
mostlc alUirs. I believe on the pirt of es
our citizens ol the Southern States, that o|
the bitter pari of them are oi t dlipo- rc
sltlon to bo law abiding and to do no violence
either to Individuals or to tlio laws
existing. Bat do they do right in Ignoring
the existence of violence and bloodshed
in resistance to the constituted authority.
I sympathlzi with their proslrato
condition, and would do ail In my power
to Jrellevo Uitih I aekuowleilgo that
in some instances they have had moat
trying governments to live under, and
very oppressive ones in the woy ol taxation
for nominal Improvements, not giving
beiiilie equal to tbo hardships
imposed. Hut can they proclaim
thcintelVtH entirely irresponsible lor this
condition '; They cannot.
Violence has been rampantjin some localities,
ami has either been juatilied or
denied by those who could have prevented
It. The theory is even raised that there
Is to be no further interlerenco ou the
part ol the general government to protect
lliu ciliz;us within it State when the State
Minorities mu 10 give protection. This
is a great mistake. While 1 remain Ex
scutive all tho laws of Congress and tbc
provisions ol the Constitution, including
[he recent amendments added thereto,
will be enforced with rigor, but with regret
that they should have added one jot
)r tittle to the Executive duties or powers.
DISCUSSION OK SOUTHERN AFFAIR).
Lot,there be fafrncsain the discussion ol
he Southern questions, the advoc ites ol
)oth or all political parties giving honest
ind truthful reports ol occurrences, con*
lemning tho wrong and upholding the
iglit, and soon all will 1)2 well.
Under the existing circumstances the
legro votes tho Republican ticket, because
to knows his friends arc all of that pirty.
tlany a good citizen votes tho opposte,
lot because he agrees with the great priniplea
of state which separate the parties,
mt because generally opposed to negro
ule. This ia a mo&t delusive cry. Treat
he negro as a citizen and a voter, as he
j and must remain, and eoon parties will
'0 divided not upon the color liue, but on
rinciplu. Then we shall havo no com*
laint of sectional interference.
The report of the Attorney General

JUDICIAL DISTRICTS.
1 respectfully suggest to Congress the
ropriety of increasing the number of
Dilii'ial Diatrirfu 1Tnii/nl

nd Ihe creation ol two additional judgelips.
The territory to be traversed by

CIVIL BKItVlCB.
The rules adopted to improve the civil
iviceof tho Government have been ad;rcd
to as closely as has been practicable
itli the opposition with which they have
eet. The eflect, I believe, has been
neficial on the whole, and has tended
the elevation ot the service, but it is
^practicable to maintain it without the
rect and positive sunnort of Conprrun ..
euurally tho support which this relorm t;

cited to as departures from the rules t
lopted, and the retention ol thoBe
jmnst whom cliarges arc made by ir- ?
sponsible persons and without good c
ounds, is also olten condemned as a ,,
olation of tliera. Under these circum- (
otices, therelore, 1 announce that il
ongress adjourns without positive legialion
on thu subject of the civil scrvico
:fornt I will regard such action as a (lis- jowal
ol tho system and will abandon it I

impossible to carry this system to a
iccessful issue without a general aproval
and assistance, and a positive law t
i support it. I have slated that three J

aarily follows. I have expressed the
ilnion, and repeat it, that the first thing '
qulslte to the accomplishment of thfi
cntl is the substitution of loand currency
in the nlaco ol a fluctuating value. This
secured, there are many interests that
might ho fostered to the great profit of
both labor and capital. How to induce
capital to employ labor is the question.
CURAT TIUNironTATION.
Tho subject of chcAp transportation
has occupied tho Attention ot Congress,
and much new light on this question will
without doubt be given by tho committee
appointed by tho last Congress to investigate
and report upon thl9 subject. A
revival of t-hip building and particularly
of iron steamship building is of vsst important
to our National prosperity, the
UnltedStates is now paying over $100,000,
000 per anuum for freight and passsge on
foreign ships, to be carried abroad and expended
in tho employment and support of
other people's beyond n fair percentage of
what should go to foreign vessels,estimating
on the tonnage and travel of each re*
spectivcly. It is to be regretted that this
disparity in the carrying trade exists, and
| to correct it t would ho willing to see u
great departure from the usual course of
governments in supporting what might
usually lie termed private enterprise. 1
would not suggest as a remedy a direct
subsidy to American steamship lines, but
1 would suggest the direct oiler of ample
compensation for carrying the mails between
the Atlantic seaboard cities and the
Continent on American-owned and American-built
steamers, and would extend tins
liberality to vessels carrying the mails to
South American States and to Central
America and Mexico, and would pursue
the same policy from our Pacific seaports
to foreign seaports on the Pacific. It
might be demanded that vessels built for
this service should come up to a standard

?U other qualities looking to the possibility
of the Government's requiring them at
soino time for war purpose*. The right
also of taking posession of them in such an
emergency should be guaranteed. 1 oiler
these suggestions, believing them worthy
of consideration in all seriousness, affecting
as they do all sections and interests
alike. If anything better can be done to
direet the country into a course of general
prosperity, no one will be more ready than
I to second the plan.
TIIE DISTUICT'GOVKRNMENT.
Forwarded herewith will be found the
report of the commissioners appointed under
an act of Congress approved June 10,
187*1, to wind up the affairs of tho District
Government, it will be seen from the report
that the net debt of the District of
Columbia, less the securities on liand and
available, is: Bonded debt issued prior to
July 1, 1874, $8,883,1)40 3-05 bonds,
'.ict of Congress June 20, 1874, $2,088,108
7:5; certificates of the Board of Auditin
Si,770,558 45; total $15,742,607 01;
less the special improvement assessments,
chargeable to private property in exjess
of any demand against such assessments,
$1,014,054 37; less the Chesapeake
Si Ohio Canal bonds ($75,000) and the
Washington & Alexandria Railroad bonds
$59,00U), in the hands of the Conimis'ioners
of the Sinking Fund $1,748,054 37;
leaving the actual debt, less said assets,
$13,994,013 24. In addition to this, there
ire claims preferred against the Governnent
of the District amounting In tho
i mated aggregate reported by the Board
)f Auditors, to ?3,147,787 48, of which
he greater part will probably be rejected.
Chirt sum can with no more propriety be
nehuled in the debt account of this Disrict
Government than can be the thousands
of claims against the General Govirnment
be included as a portion of the
mtional debt; but the aggregate sum thus
tated include something more tnan the
muled debt, chargeable exclusively to the
District of Columbia. The act of Congress u
>f June 28, 1874, contemplates an apporiomnent
between the United States Gov rnment
and the District of Columbia in
csnect to the payment of the principal
mil interest of the 55-05 bonds. Ihercfore,
n computing with precision the bonded
lebt of the District of Columbia, the
iggregatc sums which are above stated,
is respects the 3-Go bonds now issued,
lie outstanding certificates of the Board of
Vuditors, and the unadjusted claims pendng
before that Board should be reduced to
he extent of the amount to be apportioned
o the United States Government in the
nanner indicated in the act of Congress
?f June 20, 1874. #
I especially invite your attention to the
ecommendation of the Commissioners of
he Sinking Fund relative to the ambiguity
of the act of June 20, 1874, the interest
?n the District bonds, and the consolidaion
of the debt of the District. 1 feel
uuv.i> iiiuwmicu iu iiiu geniiemcn who conented
to leave their private ntliiirs and
ome from a distance to attend to thebusiless
of this District, and for the able and
atisfactory manner in which it lias been
:ondueted. L am sure their services will
?e equally appreciated by the entire eonnry.
It will he seen from tlio accompatiyng
full report of the Board of Health that
he sanitary condition of the District is
ery satssfactorjr. I n my opinion the Disrict
of Columbia should be regarded a*
he ground of the National Capital, in
rhicli the entire people arc interested. I
lo not allude to this to urge generous apiropriation
to the District, but to draw
he attention of Congress in framing a law
or the government of the District to the
nagnificent scale on which the city was
ilanned by the founders of the Govern lent,
the manner in which, for ornamental
urposcs, the reservations of the streets
nd avenues were laid out, and the protortion
of the property actually possessed
y the General Government. I think the
iroportion of the expenses of the Governnent
to be torn by the General Governnent,
the cities of Washington and Georgeown
and the county should be carefully
nd equitably defined.
In accordance with section 3 of the act
pproved June 2!$, 1874, I appointed a
oard to make a survey of the
louth of the Mississippi river, with
view to determine the best method of obnining
and maintaining a depth of water
ulHcient for the purposes of commerce,&c.,
nd in accordance with an act to provide
or the appointment of a Commission of
Engineers to investigate and report a permanent
plan for the reclamation of
he alluvial basin of the Mississippi subL'ct
to inundation, 1 appoined a Commis?
ion of Engineers. Neither board has yet
ompleted its labors. "When their reports
,re received they will he forwarded to
'ongress without delay.
