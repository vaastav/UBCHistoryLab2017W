bo closgcd. Cankers, debarred from ex
chanins certificates of small denomination
for certificates of large denomination,
would resort to the trick of presenting
preat stacks of the Fmaller bills for gold
und then turning In the gold In exchange
for gold certificates of large denomination.
This would be an endless chain in a way,
and would caue unnecessary trouble to the
treasury- Holders of silver certificates
would get bv indirection what they are
prevented ft en getting directly, and then
when the time might arrive to make it
desirable to reconvert the gold certificates
Into small bills, the process would be
tedious. It is probable, when this defect In
the bill 13 called to the attention of thc
who have it in charge, a remedy will be
suggested.

Express Companies Said to De Doing
a Large Exchange Banlness.
WASHINGTON", Dec. 9. Col. J. C. Boyd,
assistant attorney general, gave a hearing
to-day to John A. Carver and others, rep
resenting a committee of the American
Bankers" Association, and John J. McCook,
representing the Wells-Fargo Express Com
pany, and Charles Steele, of the Adams Ex
press Company, on the question of tho tax
ability of express companies as brokers un
der the war revenue act. The Question has
been before the commissioner of internal
revenue for some months, tho bankers
claiming' that the express companies not
enly do a Urge business In domestic ex
change, but also In foreign exchange, and
Vinder the wording of the war revenue act
are clearly liable to a tax as brokers.
Mr. Carver contended that the express
companies, or some of them, at least, did
a larga foreign exchange business, and that
owing to the fact that they had hitherto
heen exempt from the tax, they had been
able to cut rates to such an extent as to
drive banks out of tho exchange business,
lie Insisted that checks, orders, drafts, and
all Instruments of that character were In
effect bills of exchange, and therefore
clearly within the scope of the law.
Some time ago Commissioner Wilson de
cided that express companies engaged in
buying and selling foreign coin were sub
ject to the tax. The question of their lia
bility, however, for Issuing travelers
checks, cable transfers of money or do
mestic exchange was not decided, and the
whole matter was referred to the attorney
general for an opinion on the questions In
volved. Mr. McCook and Mr. Steele asked per
mission to file briefs, which was granted.
Mr. McCook maintained 'briefly, however,
that if express companies were declared
liable to the tax, telegraph companies must
tlso be Included. Thus, about 101.000 of
flees of these companies, representing
largely the business activity and industry
of the whole country would be practically
closed to the public. The business men of
the country, he said, would not consent to
any such restrictions on their methods of
doing business. Large areas of the coun
try .depended almost entirely on tho ex
press and telegTaph companies for the
transmission of funds. Colonel Boyd stated
that he would receive briefs any time be
tween now and Jan. 1.
RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
Scope of the Agreements rltlx Great
nrltnln and France.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The reciprocity
treaties negotiated between the United
States and France and between the United
States and Great Britain during the past
Bummer, the terms of which have been
carefully guarded, have at last been
printed. They were transmitted to the
Senate on Tuesday and via be taken up for
conspiration by tho Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations at the first meeting of
that committee, which probably wlh be
held next Wednesday. The treaty with
Great- Britain covers the dependencies of
Jamaica, Bermuda, Barbadoes, British Gui
ana and Turks and Calcos Islands.
All the agreements Include lists of arti
cles on which concessions are made by the
respective parties. Those with Great Brit
ain are signed on the part of the United
States by John Kasson and on the part
of Great Britain by Mr. Reginald Towers.
The French treaty is signed by Mr. Kasson
and Ambassador Cambon. The list of re
ductions In each case is followed by treaty
articles giving the general terms of the
stipulation. The French convention Is made
applicable to Algeria and Its products as
It is to France and its products.
The general terms of all the treaties are
practically the same, the stipulation being
in most cases, that "In case either of the
contracting parties shall, during the con
tinuance of this convention increase the
duties upon the importation of merchan
dise, the increase shall be without discrim
ination or prejudice against the products
of the other."
There are variations of this provision.
'For Instance, in the case of Jamaica, it is
stipulated that the lncrea?e shall In no
case exceed 50 per cent, of the present duty.
In the case of France It Is provided that
"Any reduction 'of the duty of the tariff
act of 1SD7 upon sparkling wines or upon
certain articles of woolen manufacture. Im
ported Into tho United States from any
other European country shall be imme
diately extended to the articles when Im
ported from France."

The various publications coming from
European sources touching the decision of
the powers to meet the United States re
quest for a formal written undertaking to
maintain the "open door" in China are giv
ing satisfaction to the officials here as in
dicating the success of this important dip
lomatic negotiation. However, It may be
stated the responses of the European gov
ernments have not yet reached the State
Department. It Is realized thoroughly that
In a matter of this Importance the negotia
tions must be conducted with the greatest
circumspection and deliberation. Hence it
is no matter for surprise that the re
sponses havo not yet been received. It is
hoped that the final success of the negotia
tions can be communicated to Congress in
the shape of a special message from the
President, accompanied by an explanatory
statement from Secretary Hay, soon after
the hoIIdays;
The Department of Agriculture will begin
its distribution of seeds a little earlier this
year than last, shipping them South the
beginning of January and perhaps sending
a few shortly before the 1st. This year
tne seeds for distribution to all parts of
the country will consist of 13.OW.0uO packs
of vegetable seeds. 1.5&3.000 of flower seeds,
besides field and lawn grass seeds.
The annual report of General F. C. Alns
worth, chief of the record and pension
ofllce of the War Department, shows that
tho enormous business of the office has
been promptly dispatched, more than 96 per
cent, of the cases received during the fiscal
year, aggregating 1S3.018, having been dis
posed of within twenty-four hours after
they reached the office, and not ono case re
mained unacted upon at the close of busl
ress hours at the end of the fiscal year. On
the recommendation of the chief of the
office a reduction of CC0 was made in .the
clerical force in IS) I. a further reduction of
fifty was made in 1SD, and a still further
reduction of twenty-five in 1S97. In the es
timates submitted by General Alnsworth
for the coming year a still further reduc
tion of thirty-two Is provede' for, making
a total reduction of 407 clerks, representing
a permanent saving of JfGO.OOO annually In
the appropriations for the clerical force of
the office. Adding to this the saving ef
fected In contingent and other expenres. It
Is shown that the cost of maintaining the
office has been permanently reduced by
fully $500,000 annually.

UNITED STATES' BONDS 3IADE A
RECORD DURING THE WEEK.
Market Conditions Offer More Attrac
tions than the Government Re
demption Offer Money Situation.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. United States gov
ernment bonds touched, this week, the
highest prices of the year. To-day's quota
tions were from Uc higher for the 3 per
cent, bonds, to lic higher for the four per
cent, bonds of lOZo, than a week ago. It be
came known, to-day, that several large in
surance companies, seeking to do business
in Cuba, had made heavy purchases of the
bonds during the last week or ten days.
Each company's deposit represents holdings
of 1100,000 in the various issues, and this,
with demands from other quarters, has' had
an important influence in raising the price
for securities above the rates named In the
treasury circular. One of the most im
portant bond houses pointed out to-day
that the government issues were always
in demand at this season, because they
were exempt from taxation and persons,
by buying the bonds, could easily effect a
transfer of their funds so as to escape the
ordinary charges. Since the government's
purchases had lessened by 518,000,000 the
supply of such securities, the price natu
rally advanced as the demand increased. A
large, dealer In government securities said
It was ridiculous to suggest that blocks of
government bonds were being held by per
sons In this city for the purpose of forcing
the treasury to increase its bid for the 4
and 5 per cent, issues, the fact being that
under prevailing money market conditions
it costs a half per cent, a month to hold
the bonds. This precluded the posibllity of
profits from such transactions and ought
to dispose of the theory in the minds of
well Informed persons. Another authority
pointed out that if tne marKci price iur
hnnHa la hicnor than tti Governments
offer, the government cannot buy the bonds
or continue disbursements at tnis center.
The interest rata would be thus left un
affected and the possibility of sterling ex-
. . . t &
change touching tne goia exporting pomi
removed. Considering the stringency pre
vailing at European money centers, such
calculations might not be absent from 'the
minds of financiers in more or less control
of the local situation.
GRIDIRON CLUB FUN.
Niagara had a cargo of lumber and shin
gles and was bound from Georgian bay to
Buffalo.
Senators Fairbanks and Beverldge
Witness a Funny Initiation.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The December
dinner of the Gridiron Club was given to
night at the Arlington Hotel, where about
130 guests were entertained In character
istic manner by the forty correspondents
who compose the famous organization.
Gen. 11. V. Boynton presided. He took
part in an interesting burlesque election.
In which members of the club imper
sonated well-known statesmen and poli
ticians, and participated in a Kentucky
Philadelphia election on plans of the most
exaggerated type. General Boynton was
unanimously voted out, but he called In
the "army" and "navy" and was again
seated.
The initiation of Rudolph Kauffmann, of
the Evening Star, was made the text of a
clever skit. The candidate appeared as
"Aguinaldo," running for safety and pur
sued by three members of the club repre
senting Generals Lawton, MacArthur and
Wheeler. "Aguinaldo" - was captured by
these three "aScers" and then "General
Otis," another member of the club, stalked
In with military pomp and after some con
versation received the report of the offi
cers, each claiming to have captured the
Filipino chief. After reading each report
he dictated a dispatch to his "orderly,"
cabling Adjutant General Corbln that "the
army under my command presents the Na
tion, as a Christmas gift, Aguinaldo." The
club took In the candidate, saying as he
had done most of his fighting in the news
papers he was entitled to belong to a
correspondents' club. "General Otis" was
presented with a "house" for his great
victory.
Another incident was the reading of an
alleged dispatch from South Africa detail
ing a great victory which the English had
achieved over the Boers. This was fol
lowed by a number of British soldiers run
ning the whole length of the room, pur
sued In a leisurely manner by "Oom Paul
Kruger," who cracked his whip in great
glee. There were many other features
sandwiched in with the bright and witty
speeches, making the entire evening one
of thorough enjoyment. Among the promi
nent guests present were Senators Fair
banks and Beveildge, of Indiana.

Germany her success.

Over 100,000 Cotton Operative to Il
ctlve Increase in "War.
BOSTON, Dec. 9.-New England cotton
manufacturers are greatly pleased at the
announcement from Augusta, Ga., that the
cotton manufacturers of that city are to
raise the wages of their 8,000 employes
Jan 1, as this is regarded as an indica
tion that other mill men of the South
will also take action on the question. Man
ufacturers in the North, with very few ex
ceptions, have granted an advance and the
step has been taken in spite of the knowl
edge that If wages in the South remained
unchanged New England manufacturers
would be placed at a disadvantage. The
news from Georgia, therefore, is very wel
come Intelligence to Northern manufactur
ers. It is estimated that by January from
HO.OTO to 150,000 cotton mill operatives in
the North will be working under an ad
vance of wages and that the advance in
the South will bring the total in the United
States above 160,000.

tearing up the tracks. Two of them broke
away and ran. A dozen shots were fired
and one, Harry Hayes, was wounded In the
leg and recaptured. The other men ar
rested were Michael Geltl, William Molly,
Frank Hand and Walter Salves and one
man, name unknown. The prisoners were
brought to the county jail in a patrol
wagon.

OMAHA. Neb., Dec. 9. Judge Scott, of
the District Court, has ordered that the
Rev. Elmer P. Qulvey, general manager of
the Nebraska Children's Home Association,
be committed to Jail., and he has directed
that the Rev. T. J. Muckay, of All Saints
Church, tne Rev. II. C. Herring, pastor of

F. Harford be cited to show cause why
they should not be punished for contempt
of court In trying, by means of a letter,
which they all signed, to influence the
Judge's action In tho Dodd children habeas

Dodd placed the children In the care of the
Home for the Friendless, the officers of
which found homes for them. Dodd is now
suing to recover possession of the children,

the Judge, and set forth the opinion of the
writers that the little ones were better off
where they were, and recommended that
they be allowed to remain.

officers went after the children, they could
not be found, and Xiela charged with se
