Tapped for Butte's Benefit
Though Butte has hitherto been obliged
to content herself with being the terminus
0 | a short spur railroad, the day ie not
, jar distant when she will be the grand cen
tral point in a vast system of transconti
nental and other trunk lines of railroad,
n ot to speak of net-woik of brunches that
«ill lay tributary the surrounding mining
end agricultural regions. Butte has been
(ontsnt to give Helena the distinctiou of
tsin: the greatest wholesale distributing
point in Montana, yet she may, ere long,
gMOine that position, and when she does
•be will attract trade by legitimate meth
ods, and not through such relics of bar
barism ns the commercial license tnx, that
WH 9 lenz "mposed for the sole object of
driving all Territorial trade to Helena. It
je now well understood »hat the Northern
Pacific »ill < xtend its Helena & Boulder
Valley branch to Butte, and those wbo
ought to know suy tbat it
WILL BE IN OPERATION
to this camp by the time the Montana Cen
tral is completed, if not sooner, the work
ou its line betwoen Calvin's and Butts be
leg generally light. Before tbat branch is
«ell in opera'ion. arrangements will be
made to complete the loop by building the
direct line from Pipestone Pnss to Gallatin.
This road will be of greater value to Butte
than any other of the short lines in con
templation, as it will bring her nearer to
Eastern terminals than Helena now is,
shortening the distance as compared with
prêtent routes by about 125 miles. It will
open short and direct communication with
oil the best coal deposits yet discovered in
Montana, at Timberline, Trail Creek, Liv
ingston and Rocky Fork, and the conse
quent reduction in tbecostof coal and coke
will be
WORTH MILLIONS OP DOLLARS
annually to the industries of this camp.
Ibis line will not stop in Butte, but it will
be pushed to a connection with the main
line at some point father West, and will be
come the main line itself. It is quite
natural to conclude that the through pas
censer truins will be run on the shortest
and most direct line, where there is the
greatest passenger traffic, and Butte will,
of course continue to furnish her best out
lets with the heaviest passenger traffic, as
ebe does in freights. In building t.bis short
line the No-them Pacific will simply rectify
a grave mistake, tbat has cost it many
millions of dollars, and entailed great loss
1o this camp. A few weeks ago The Miner
referred to the fact that the Oregon Trans
continental would devote its newly ac
quired funds to the construction of a
system of branches, the mrst important of
which was the branch from Lewiston on
Snake River, to Butte. This road would
give Butte direct connection with Portland,
making a saving of about 175 miles as com
pared with present routes, and would open
up a series of
RICH MINERAL DISTRICTS
between the Bitter Root River and Pierce
City. All those east of the Idaho line
would certainly become tributary to this
city, as well as the fertile valley of the
Bitter Root. Since Sidney Dillon has ac
cepted the presidency of the Oregon Trans
continental, there is a better prospect of
the earlv r, v,etruction of this important
line, lie is too well acquainted with the
magnificent traffic furnished the roads by
this camp, to be behind in the race of the
roads to get here, and his bands will be
strengthened by the business men of Port
land, who are very anxious to tap the
mineral districts on the Clearwater, to
draw ores to feed the smeltert at Portland.
It is very impoitant to the people of Butte
that a railroad to tbo Bitter Root Valley
should be built as soon as possible, me
products of the valley: tl.e lumber and
ores of the Bitter Root range will be wanted
here, but there is more. The Bitter Root
branch of the Northern Pacific will hardly
cross the mountains to the head of Salmon
River before
another road
will be heading for that point from Wlnne
mueca, on the Central Pacific. A glance at
a map will show that this link will complete
the shortest and most direct route possible
from San Francisco to Western Mon
tana. This connection is. ard Ä
desired bv the people of San Bran
cisco, and when the first Bitter Roo
Euilroid Company was formed in 1883.
the Winnemucca branch was yery soon un
der consideration. Through the Bitter
Root also, Butte will be connected witn the

^ Vow Voot Body of la Bwndrsd Onnoe
Oro in tho Mountain Lion—Sixteen Oers
of Timbor for tbo Anaeomda—Driving
Deep Down in the Lexington—The Coal
Moaenros of tho Flathead Region.
Messrs. Pete Conway, Dr. Holmes
and B. Marchesssan are receiving con
gratulations npon having made a
rich strike in the Mountain Lion
Tunnel, Horse Canyon. After boring the
tunnel 600 feet, the lead waa encountered
on Friday afternoon, showing up a four
foot body of exceedingly rich ore. Samples
taken from all over the face show up an
average of 600 ounces of silver per ton.
From the numerous rich strikes that are
being made within a radius of a few miles
from the center of Batte, it ie evident that
prospecting is only fairly begun.
The announcement by the Lexington
Company of tbeir intention to siuk to the
2.000 foot, level, will be bailed with general
satisfaction. There ie enough ore above
the 1,000 to keep all the reduction worke
in Montana in full operation for several
generations to come. When it is demon
strated by deep working's that the ore
reaches to the other side, ninety-nine year
leases will be more common than now.
Superintendent Tibbey reports the Par
rot as showing up as well as it ever did in
all the various levels. The supply of ore
in sight ie sufficient to justify the belief tbat
this mine will continue its regular output
throughout the next eentury.
In answer to the rumor that the Ana
conda would have to shut down for want
of timber, a train of sixteen ears of timber
arrived at the mine last evening. This
supply will last for some time, and it ie not
li kely that each a contingency will again
oecur.

It is occasionally stated by outsiders
that tbe deep workings in the Anaconda
mice proved that no pay ore existed at a
depth of 1.000 feet. Tbe construction of
the immense new works at Anaconda is
sufficient refutation of that statement.
Those works wers not built for fun, and
will con'inne to redaes Anaconda ores
until the workings get down to where the
beat kille ail but salamanders.
Captain J. C. Ks-r, of Flathsad Lake,
eaye a large number of coal seams have
been discovered during the fail, on the
varioue forks of Flathead river. 8oine of
the samples brought into the settlements
are of very floe quality, and the indications
are that some very valuable deposits of
bituminous coal will be opened up next
year. Several of the large eeame are
lignite, but there is a large area of country
underlaid with the coal, some of which, in
the mountainous régions, is subjected to
great pressure, and will prove of great
value to the surrounding mining regions.
Denver Republican: The typical old
time prospector ie becoming scarce in Colo
rado, and ie now rarely met with except in
tbe frontier camps. There was a time, and
not many years past, when all the large
towns in the State were filled at this time
of tbe year with returning prospectors,
who were driven in from the mountains by
tbe first heavy enow falls. Now, however,
few of thie character of people are to be
seen, even in the outlying towns of Deau
ville, Georgetown and Gunnison. The
business of prospecting has experienced an
evolution during tbe past few years tnat
is olten commented upon by tbe
pioneers of the State. In years past it was
customary for tbe restless and adventur
ous spirits to take to the mountains every
spring, ostensibly to prospect for veins or
auriferous placers. Those who could aot
supply themselves with the necessary pro
visions and pack burros were ''grab
staked," and it was indeed a luckless fe ow
who could not secure enough "grub to
take him to the nearest foot hills and
allow him to live a comfortable camp life
for a few months. It was in this way that
the remote sections were opened up and
the resources of the State discovered and
brought to notice.
Graduallv the entire country was pretty
thoroughly*gone over, and prospecting on
general principles, or wherever fancy might
suggest, bas been abandoned. The all
round prospector has been relegated, and
more systematic methods have been
adopted in the search for ore. It. ie no
longer expected that a man will penetrate
unknown regions and stumble upon bonau
cas unawares. To prospect now means to
go out to some defined spot, usually near
the railways, where the ore, if any be en
countered, can be shipped to market, and
there prospect a vein by digging into it, or
sinking a shaft in search of a deposit likdy
to be encountered, on account °J_ the ' a *
vorable geological formation. The cars
»-« used iu getting to the place, and the
days of the prospector are employed
in drilling and picking, instead of
aimlessly wandering over mountains and
through guti hes and parks with an eye to
the next good camping place, possibly be
fore the smoke of ;tbe last camp fire has
disappeared from view. Then, too, the
depth P of the shaft or lenath of the tunnei
must bear witness to the amount ol work
done, and not a meandering J n® d ™,wn
ov"r a soiled map, to show an aileged trav
eled route. No, the old-time prospectors
as a class are rapidly dying out in Colora
do, and those wbo follow it now should
be classed rather as miners than proa
uectors for as miners they have a fixed
purpose and a determinationto accoirn
plish something, which could not always
