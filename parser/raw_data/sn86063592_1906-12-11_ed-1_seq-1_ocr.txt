Pari. Dee 11 -This is a historic
day in Franc The struggle which
began In ! with the banishment of
tb Jesuit, ended today with the leg-)
at rapture of tfie bond which for;
practically a thousand years had unit
ed church and state by the refusal
to make a declaration under the pub
lic meetings law of ml. public Catho
lic worship, except under the sthls
nia'tie organization tomorrow becomes
illegal. The scenes In some churches
were extremely touching. Not In
fears bag there been such an attend
a nc at maws. The number of women
was especialy large, and was note
worthy as an Indication of the re
unions indifference of the male popu
lation. Although seven-eights of the
Inhabitants of the city are mostly
Catholics, in no part of the city mere
tho churches crowded. Even at Notre
Dame where solemn high mans was
celebrated, the edifice was only half
filled. The officiating clergy read the
regular offices without referring to
the Illegal status tomorrow. Never
theless the depression of the Catho
lics was manifest and many of the
women were moved to tears.
On the ending of the struggle It
Is becoming that both the govern
ment officials and the ecclesias
tics are resisting the advice of tho
Intemperate. Minister of Public Wor
ship Brian d announces tho govern
ment -'cannot be driven Into the trap
of cloaiug the churches.' and Cardin
al Richard, Archbishop of Paris, has
strongly censured the placarding of
appeals to the clergy to mtk violent
resistance, to tho officers." "No vkv
lance," he says, "but passive resist
ance to an unjust law. after exhaust
ing all protests at every step."
Repressive Measures
Paris, Dec. 11. After the meeting
of the cabinet ministers today It was
announced that on December 14 Pre
mier Clemenceati will ask parliament
to suppress pensions of the clergy, to
liquidate public property of Catholics
and distribute the presbyteries, sem
inaries, etc. It is also positively
stated that the government has de

Rapid Progress in Agricultural Pursuits and in Govern

Washington. U. C Dec 1L A
special message from President
Roosevelt on Porto Rico was scat to
tho senate and house of represent
Uvea this boob oa tho opening of
congress. Too message In full la at
follows:
To tho Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
On November St I visited tho Is
land of Porto Rico, landing at Pone.
crossing by the old Spanish road by
Cayey to San Juan, and returning
next morning over the new American
Toad from ArVclbo to Poncef; Jth
scenery was wonderfully benatiniu
especially among the mountains of
the Interior, which constitute a verit
able tropic Swltxerland. I could not
embark at San Juan because tho bar
bor haa not been dredged out and
can not receive an American battle
ship. 1 do not think this fact credit
able to us as a nation, and I earnest
ly hope that Immediate provision will
be made for dredging San Juan har
bor. I doubt whether our people as a
, whole realize the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico, and the progress that
has been made under Ita admirable
government We have Just cause for
pride In the character of our repre
sentatives who have administered the
tropic islands which came tf -dor oar
flas; as a result of tho ar with
Spain; and of no one of them la this
more true than of Porio Rico. It
would be 4ru passible tolwtsh a more
faithful, a more efficient and a more
disinterested public service than that
now being rendered In the Island of
Porto Rico by those Iti control of the
Insular government.
I stopt at a doxen towns all told,
and one of the notable features In
every town was the gathering of the
school children. The work that has
been done In Porto Rico for education
has been noteworthy. The main em
phasis, as is eminently wise and prop
er, has been put upon primary edu
cation; but In addition to this there
Is a normal school, an agricultural
school, three Indutftrlal and three
high schools. Every effort Is being
made to secure not only the benefits
of elementary education to all the
Porto Rlcans of the next generation.
but also as far as means will penult
I to train them so that the Industrial,!
agricultural and commercial oppor-
1 1 unities of the Inland can be utilised
I to tho best possible advantage. H
I was evident at a glance that the
! teachers, both Americans and native
i Porto Rlcans, were devoted to their
work, took the greatest pride in It
and were endeavoring to train their
pupils, not only in mind, but In what
counts far more than mind In citizen
ship, that Is. in character.
I was very much struck by the ex
cellent character both of the litsuliir
police and of the Porto Rlcan regi
ment. They are both of them bodies
that reflect credit upon the American
administration of the island. The In
sular police are under the local Por
to Rlcan government. The Porto
Rlcan regiment of troop must bo ap
propriated for by the congress. I
earnestly hope that this body will be
kept permanent There should cer
fnlniv ho irnona In the island, and !'
Is wise that theso troops should be
themselves native Porto Ricntu. V Rgin?t the management of the elec-
would be from every standpoint a'tkms, altho three contests are threat I

holder struck with the evident rapid
growth In the culture both of the
sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit
industry Is also growing. Last year
was the most prosperous year that
the Island has ever known before or
since the American occupation. The
total of export and Imports of the
island was firty-flve million of dol
lars as against eighteen millions In
1901. This Is the largest In the l
land's history. Prior to the Ameri
can occupation the greatest trade for
any one year waa that of 1898, when
It reached nearly twenty-three mil
lions of dollars. Ist year, therefore,
there was double the trade that there
was In the most prosperous year un
der the Spanish regime. There were
210.273 ton of faugar exported last
year, of the value or 13.18J!9: S3 -555,1

4Kl.lul t'nfortunately. what used to
be Porto Kloo's prime cropcoffee
has not shared this prosperity. It
has never recovered from the disaster
of the hurricane, and moreover, tit
benefit of throwing open our mar
ket to It his not compensated for the
toss Inflicted by the closing of the
markets to it abroad. I call your at
tention to the accompanying memor
ial on this subject, of the Board of
Trade of San Juan, and I earnestly
hone that some measure will be tak
en for the benefit of the excellent
and high grade Porto Rlcan coffee.
In addition to delegations from the
Board of Trade and Chamber of Com
merce of San Juan. I also received
delegations from the Porto Rlcan Fed '
eratkm of Iabor and from the Coffee
Growers' association.
There Is a matter to which I wish
to call your special attention, and that
la the desirability of conferring fall
American cltltensblp npon the people
of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope
that this will be done. I can not see
how any barm eaa possibly result
from It. and It seems to me a mat
ter of right and justice to the people
of Porto Rico. They are loyal, tbey
are glad to he under our flag, they
arc making rapid progress along the
path of orderly liberty. Surely we
should show our appreciation of them.

Under the wise administration of
the pit) em (governor and council.
marked progress has been made In
the difficult matter of granting to
the people of the Island the largest
measure of self-government that can
with safety be given at the present
time. It would have been a very seri
ous mistake to have gone any faster
than we have already gone In this di
rection. The Porto Rlrans have com
plete and absolute autonomy in all
their municipal governments, the
only power over them possessed by
the Insular government being that of
removing corrupt or Incompetent
municipal officials. This power has
never been exercised save on the
clearest proof of corruption or of In
competence such as to jwpardl.c
the Interests of the people of the is
land; and under such circumstances
It has been fearlessly used to the
inimenne bqnpflt of the puople. It
has not a power with which It would
j,,. gHf,., for the sake of tho Island it'
jaoif, to dispense at present The
lower house Is absolutely elective
while the upper house Is appointive
The scheme Is working well; no lu
justice of any kind results from It,,
and great benefit to the Island, and
It should certainly not be changed j
at this time. The machinery of the.
elections Is administered entirely by j
the Porto Rlcan people themselves,
the governor and council keeping on
ly such supervision as Is necessary In j
order to insure an orderly election. '
Any protest as to electoral frauds Is;
settled in the courts. Here again j
It would not be safe to make any !
change In the present jystem. The 1
elections this year were absolutely or
derly, unacconianled by any disturb-
ance; and no protest ha been nmde
ened where the majorities were very
'small and error wa claimed; the con-
tests, of course, to be settled In the!

in the principle of orderly liberty.
They are providing a government
based upon each citizen a self-respect,
and the mutual respect of all citi
zens; that Is, baaed upon a rigid ob
servance of the principle of Justice
and honesty. It has not been eaay to
instil Into the minds of people unac
customed to the exercise of freedom,
th two basic principle of our Ameri
can system; the principle that the
majority must rule, and the principle
that the minority haa rights which
must not b disregarded or trampled
on. Yet real progress haa been made
in having these principle accepted as
