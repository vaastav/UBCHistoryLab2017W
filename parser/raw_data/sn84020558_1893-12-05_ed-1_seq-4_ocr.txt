" THE MESSAGE
The president's message which has
Deen awaited with perhaps greater in
terest than any previous similar docu
ment was presented to congress yester
day. It had been announced from
inner circles that it would be volumin
ous and though were its author natur
ally less prolix there were still amnla
reasons why this document should be
one of extraordinary length.
Not within a quarter of a century
have so many and so grave questions
vexed an administration, and the vexa-
a: 1 .
nun dss Deen more intense in that the
questions tnemselves are the direct
products of the administration. Those
who had hoped that additional light
would be shed upon the national com.
plications or that some further forecast
of the government's plans would be
afforded have been doomed to disap
pointment. There is all through the messaee an
impression of that sense of painful re
sponsibility which is so characteristic
of Mr. Cleveland. But that is all that
and vociferation, succeeded in awaken
ing him. The drummer sleepily and
profanely begged to remain undis
turbed, but in answer to Mr. Groghan's !
importunities he explained that he had j
changed his mind. Thereupon, Mr. j
ruKuau xiCKea the door down. He
dragged the astonished drummer from
his bed, exclaiming at the same timp
"Yezshpalpeen, me instructions are
to moind yez don't miss the thrain
Mr. Cleveland is determined to hold
the country to its foolish wail of dis
content a year ago. '

ma.aauie state aocument. It contains
absolutely nothing new. The allusion to
the Hawaiian question is a condensa
tionof the already expressed views of
secretary Greaham. Mr. Cleveland's
financial utterances and his altitnri nn
the silver question are in nowise differ.
ent from those with which the country
was made acquainted at the opening of
thn extraordinary session. His sugges

heads of the various departments in
their recently published reports.
Even the tariff portion of the docu
ment ie a reiteration of that division of
the famous message to the Fiftieth con
gress and which sounded the keynote
of Democratic defeat in 1888. One
sentence of Mr. Cleveland's in this con
nection 19 significant. Says he: "After
a full discussion our countryman hr
spoken in favor of this reform and they
have confided the work of its accomp
lishment to the hands of those who are
solemnly pledged to it."
It may be asked, to which expression
of our countrymen does the Dresidpnt
allude? Was it to that given in 18!)2
or to that later spontaneous expression
a month ago? Is it not possible that
Mr. Cleveland has misinterpreted the
will of the people, and has failed to
recognize the possibility of a national
change of opinion, based on a later ac
quired experimental knowledze of th
subject? It is evident, thoneh. th.t

By his allusion to the will nf
people Mr. Cleveland is strongly re
mindful of the porter of . rural T,-

whose most valuable characteristic was
an unwavering faithfulness to instruc
tion from the office, as Tshown hv th.
following incident:
