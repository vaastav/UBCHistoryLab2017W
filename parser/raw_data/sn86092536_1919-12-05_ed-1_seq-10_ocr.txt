WASHING;'"" ?N. Dec. 4?Official an
nouncement h* s just been mail'- by Hon. !
John C. \Vhitsctl. mnvor of the * "it>- of
St. Joseph. Mo., chairman of the execu
tive board, of ?.h?- organization of a nat
ional association, which will have local
unit* in overy county of every state in
the United States, for ??effectively com
batting the dantfemus trend toward ex
treme radicalism, such as Bolshevism
and anarchy." The stated purposes of
the association *tc:
First: To prevent the forceful over
throw of constituted government (local,
state or national,) within the United
States of America.
Second: To urge ti higher standard In
the performance of the duties of citiz
enship in America.
Third: To strengthen the indepen
dence of our public officials and protect
them fro m.ntirnidation on the part of
revolutionaries.
Fourth: To promote greater harmony
and progress generally, through the sin
cere cooperation of all.
'The organization wilf be known as
th? National t'o-operative Re-adjust
ment Association. It was explained
that this association should not be con
fused with various co-operative enter
prises of a more or less private, or of a
political, nature; as the purposes arc
as enumerated above and it has no other
activities.
Effective methods for attaining the
purposes of it*- association are being
worked out sp-vliiy as circumstances
seem to warrant.
It is believed that the chief benefit
from tin- association will be derived by
local communities, especially industrial
communities, but inasmui h as local un
its will t? general in each state ami ter
r:'->ry and politU?l subdivisions thereof,
and these communities make up the nat
ion. then the great benefit to bo derived
?-hould materially affect our entire
nation.
LANSING ADMITS
(Continued rrom Pao On*.)
jittitud- against invasion of American
rights in tin- southern republic. Mr.
Imnsing was quoted as saiying. was
reached some months ago and row was
about to develop whether the Carranza
regime would accept or disregard it. He
was saul to :iave added?that the admin
istration was prepared to go whatever
length was necessary to enforce that
policy*.
Hltrhcock'* Suggestion
Neither the secretary nor the admin
istration senators, however, were rep
resented as expressing directly any op
position to the Kail resolution. Several
attempts to postpone, :o tion on it came
from the Jv-inocratie side .and Senator
Hitchcock, acting Democratic leader of
the senate, suggested a substitute by
which the senate no rt ly would endorse
the state department's course in the
matter and <lei hire in advance its sup
. port of the prt sid< tit. should he decide
t ? break off diplomatic relations.
During the day Henry I\ Fletcher,
American ambassador to Mexico, also
?vent la tore the committee and was sail
to have cover-d many of the same
points as did the secretary in reply to
questions about the attitude of the state
department. Dor some weeks he has
been stationed here and has assisted in
the diplomatic correspondence now in
progress regrading the case of William
O. Jenkins, the American consular agent
under arrest at l'uebla.
Await Caxranza Beply
A reply now is awmited from Car
ran *a to the latest American note re
questing m sharp terms that Jenkins
be released, and advices reaching lu re
today indicated that a commission
might be asked for by the Mexican
president to settle the dispute. It was
^^-spid. Mr. Lansing did not indicate what
course this government might take
should the reply prove unsatisfactory,
but was Very emphatic in hit? declar
ation that the I'nit'd States was ready
to shoulder any consequences which
might result from its demands for pro
tection of American rights.
Lansing'_? Disclosures.
Virtually all of Ambassador Fletch
er's statement to the committee related
to the Jenkins case, tut Secretary Lan
sing was drawn into a detailed dis
cussion of the whole general subject of
relations with Mexico and told the in
side story of the American govern
ment's attitude during recent years.
The great obstacle to a break with
Mexico before the I'nited States enter
ed the Kuropean war. Mr. Lansing is
understood to have said, was the fact
i
j that such a break might have had con
j sequences which would have destroyed
the president's hope of avoiding1 en
tanglement in the conflict overseas.
J Fear of that result, lie was quoted as
saying, was based on the large number
of European interests in Mexico ami
the suspected sympathy between Oar
ranza und the German government.
With the declaration of war with
Germany, it was said, the situation be
?ame even more embarrassing because
t was a part of Germany's war game to
?itir up trouble for the L'nited States on
.his continent. .Mr. lgtnsing was said
o have added that in these premises
he administration felt is should go a
long way in conserving its resources for
the struggle with its European enemy.
Endorsed By Wilson.
After peace negotiations had been
?ohcluded. however, it was pointed out
.1 note was sent to Carranza declaring
pointedly that unless more regard were
given American rights there would be
a radical change in the course of the
l'nited States government.
This step, Mr. Lansing is said to
have declared, was decided on with
great deliberation and constituted a
definite policy from which there had
been no deviation. The secretary is
understood to have added that in the
circumstances he saw no real urgency
for demanding the president's attention
to the Jenkins case, since in dealing
with it the department only had been
pursuing the course -Mr. Wilson had en
dorsed.
Opposed to Break.
In questioning the advisability of the
action suggested in the Fall resolution,
Mr. Lansing was quoted as saying that
the Jenkins correspondence seemed
j about to bring a real test whether Car
J ranza meant to heed the warning giver
.some months ago. and that it might be
' \v:s.-r to let this question be ??<?wercd
j before breaking off relations. Such a
I break, he is said also to have suggested,
? : might not only endanger the effort tc
?jobtain Jenkins' release, but also place
other American lives and interests ir
' jeopardy by the withdrawal of diplo
j rnatic representatives.
; ' In addition, doubt was said *n have
, been raised as to what ical advan
tage might tie gained by such a with
drawal.
Committee Named.
Both the secretary and Amnassadot
Fletcher went before the committee al
i its request and gave their statements
1 behind closed doors. Mr. Lansing was
' at the committ'-e table more than ar
1 hour and a half, and afterward th?
, members resumed consideration of thf
resolution, with the democrats asking
for delay. At first they proposed in
dcfln.re postponement, and th--n '
p--m m? nf until the next regular meet- j
nig to ho IhM Wednesday. Itutn mo- ?
lions wore voted down l.y the lb-publi
cans.
The motion t- appoint a committee of
'Wo to endi-iior to so.. tho pr.-sid-n!

was the determination of Ml?- tnajorit)

disregarded .and when the s? ti-.-'s ser
goant-at-nrriis eam>- to "art- st" ahsen

the committee closed its doors against

When the motion was brought to a ?

tfampshire, all Republicans. lim-d up mi

Tennessee, opposing it. Mthough Sen
ator Kali had suggested that Senator
Lodge, the comtnitt'o chairman and
! K--publican lead'-t; 4i the senate, be
named with Senator Hitchcock to go to
the White House, t'hnirman Lodge de
clined to take the place and named
Sera tor Kali instead.
I Tonight Senators Kill and Hitchcock
had net consulted White House of
ficials. and the Republican leaders said
that if n conference were denied con
gress would go ahead on Its own infer- j
tnutlon and probably would tin- |
Kali measure. The committee adjourn- |
od until Monday, however, so as to give j
ample time for the call on the president, j
I Senator Kail, who headed a conimit
| tee Investigating the entire Mexican
; situation, plans to la ysome of the re-.
, suits of his inquiry before the presi
dent if art lilt- rv ? -w is granted. He has I
! been one of the bitterest opponents of j
- the administration l"r its attitude to- J
ward- Mexico, though his resolution on- .
dorses the stand taken in th-- Jenkins j
. case.
Drslert by Bonliias.
I A recent charpe by Senator Fall that
I the Mexican ambassador. Tpnniii. r.onil
I las. had attempted to spread Uolshevls
I tic propaganda in this country drew a
denial tonight from the ambassador,
who Issued a formal statement tha,t he
had done nothing to encourage disturb
ing elements In the United States or
Mexico.
The notion of the committee 1y decid
ing to sord representatives to see the
president brought to a focus much !
elo.ul^ room speculation as to the extent :
to which Mr. Wilsons Illness has han
dleapped him In the discharge of his
I ofTicinl duties. Committee members!
j said they did not regard their action j
as in any way raising formally any '
nuestlrm as to his constitutional dis- {
i ability, but It was declared privately on ]
I all sides that the move might result In |
I clarifying the atmosphere as to his i
condition.
Mr. Wilsons Condition.
When Informed of the proposal late j
i this afternoon Dr. Cray son said ho j
| would rather not permit such a confer- ]
en< o to take place tonight. but fully j
expected the president would be able j
to see the two senators tomorrow. The
admiral expects to confer wtth them be
fore they nre admitted to the sick I
room, however, and Indicated he would
object to any nttempt to heckle the
president or Involve him in any sharp
discussion.
Karller In the day TV. Crayson had
announced that Mr. Wilsons improve
ment had become more marked and J
! that he was bc^np permitted to do an!
I increasinp amount of work. Tie said It
was not necessary for the patient to '
? use a wheel chair all of the time that
| he was out of bed. ami that during the
; mornlnp he had been able to po over
some official papers and slpn som#
nominations.
The physician baa been very Insist- 1
1 ent apalnst callers, fjowetve. and IV.
[ Wilson! has seen few since he re
turned to Washington 111 on September
28. Senator Hitchcock has Indicated
I his desire to see the president on sev
I eral occasions during the past two
weeks regarding the treaty tight. hut
? has been unable to arranpe a confer
I ence. It was said that Secretary I.ans
j inp told the committee today he not
only had not talked with the executive
about Mexico dm $ ? the recent n<>p>>tia
tions, but had not seen him on any
j subject.
HEROIC BATTLE
(Oontlnned From Page On*.)
upon the President. Mrs. Wilson has
1 chosen the course of stoical silence.
| Why doesn't someone say what is the
jinstter with the President?
Some of the most noted physicians in
i the country have issued statements. In
! timate details have from time to time
.been revealed oven to the extent of de
scribing troubles with the prostrato
elands and digestive weaknesses. Dr.
Dercum the noted neurologis has Issued
? a statement saying tint President was
so much improved that he didn't be
lieve ho would have to com.- hack to the
White House for regular visits tiny
more. Other statements of reassurance
? have been given. Yet the outcry for
j mere details, for more itif >rmalion con
, ? tinucs.
j At the White House, officials place
th? blame for this Intensified curiosity
in the country at large to the studied
campaign of doubt which the political
I'opponents of the President have been
ousting upon his acts ever since he took
sick. Instead ol' adopting a resolution
J of sympathy for the President?not un
.expression of that kind has been intr<>
I' ducvd in the House or Senate by tho
i' Republicans who tire In control?a ser
i J ies of speeches have been made ?1|
j tending to cast discredit upon those who
i j were speaking on behalf of tne Presi
? i dent as well as the President liirnS' lf.
i 1 First came a debate as to whether Mr.
I Wilson's signature was his own on a
I public document, the inference tiring
that It was forged by some of his sub
, I ordinate*. Then came the publication
'of a letter in which one senator spoke
of nceroral lesion of which tie heard
I j rumors and on which lie based Ills own
. I Judgment that the President would be
i ? in-capacitated for the remainder of bis
II term. Following closely upon this w? re
1 1 stories of how the President's office
t) could be declared vacant and should.
; The newspapers hostile to the president
j in this vicinity have latelx renewed this
. form of attack. On o p of it all has
, 1 corne a series of statements from Sen
. ! ators published broadcast saying they
didn't believe the President wrote his
. ! roeont message to Congress.
. , Officials at the White House point to
. j the fact that the President's opponents
j
are not flphtinsr fiir and that they for
