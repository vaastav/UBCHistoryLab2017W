Politics seem to engage the minds of
the people sooner than usual. The al
most unanimous sentiment seems to be
in favor of Gov. La Follette’s renomina-
Oon. This obtains singularly among
the rural population. Should he bo de
prived of a renomination, which we
trust will not be the case, there is good
reason to believe it would be a repeti
tion of New York in 1882, when Mr. Fol
ger was forced upon the people, and
which resulted in the election of Grover
Cleveland for governor by a great ma
jority- Paul G. Yolkman.

A CowardW Trick.
While standing in the kitchen of her
homo in Chicago, Julia Heinrich, nar
rowly escaped injury, a block of wood
hurled by some cowardly assailant,
crashed through the glass door and
whirled by her head, the servant girl
was the only other person in the house
and both were in the kitchen. Miss
Heinrich had time to dodge the piece of
wood, the crashing of the glass door
giving a warning. Miss Heinrich is the
daughter of Max Heinrich the well
known singer.
