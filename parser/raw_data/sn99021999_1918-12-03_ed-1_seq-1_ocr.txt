thousands of American troops
bound for war, heard today the first
cheers of homecoming men of the
victorious army more than 4,000 of
them from almost every state in
the union, who joined in a shout
that carried across the waters and
into the streets of downtown Man

Whistles Shriek Welcome.
With Mayor Ilylan and an of

the soldier-freighted liner steamed
up the bay between lines of harbor
craft with the flags of America and
the allies flying and with whistles
shrieking a welcome.
Battery park and piers on the
Manhattan and New Jersey shoes
were thronged with flag-waving,
cheering multitudes as the Maure
tania moved up to her pier on the
North river.
At the same time, without cheers
or an- official welcome of any sort,
1,000 wounded soldiers, returned by
way of hospitals in France from the
trenches, where they gripped with
the foe and helped to crush" him,
were being moved ashore from the

They were hurried to hospitals in

ESTIMATE
PROVIDES
FOR ARMY
0F500.000
Vast Reduction in Expenses
of Conducting Govern
ment During Coming
Year of Peace.
By Associated Press.
Washington, Dec. 2. A regular
army of approximately 500,000 men
is provided for specifically in esti
mates submitted to congress today
for the fiscal year 1920, beginning
next July. Detailed items on the
pay of the army show that in the
total of $1,922,000,000 asked for, ex
clusive of the fortification estimates,
provision is made for the payment
of only 21,259 officers and 382,667
men of the line and approximately
130,000 noncombatant troops with
the requisite staff officers.
The inclusion in the estimates,
however, of five items of pay with
a nominal appropriation of $100
each asked, shows that the whole
question of the strength of the
army after the conclusion of peace
has been deferred and that supple
mental estimates are to be ex
pected under these headings when
it is possible to present a completed
project. The items thus held in
suspension are those providing for
the pay of reserve and national
guard officers and men.
Navy Asks More Money.
The naval estimates are framed
on an exactly opposite theory.
Every provision is made for steady
and rapid increase of the fleet, a
total of approximately $434,000,000
being asked. Of that sum $200,000,
000 is he first increment of the
proposed , new three-year building
program providing for 10 additional
dreadnaughts, six battle cruisers
and 140 other fighting craft. The
remainder of the $434,000,000 would
go to complete ships of the first
three-year program.
Secretary Daniels has renewed,
also, the naval emergency fund
item, under which congress appro
priated $100,000,000 last year to pro
vide for the construction of addi
tional destroyers, submarine chas
ers and other special craft and to
expedite construction work. This
year, however, the department asks
for $175,000,000.
Army Reduction Large.
Cessation of war will result in a
reduction of government expenses
ofr the fiscal year 1920, starting next
July 1, to $7,443,415,838 from the
$24,599,000,000 appropriated for the
current year according to tentative
estimates submitted to congress
by Secretary McAdoo, transmitting
the reports of the various depart
ments. The principal reduction was for
the military establishment, which

Given Noticeably Cool Recep
tion by Lawmakers While
Delivering Address; Lacks
Old-Time Fire.
Washington Bureau of Omaha Bee
Washington, Dec. 2. (Special
Telegram.) President Wilson's re
ception at the hands of an American
congress today was frigid in the ex
treme. The lawmakers had assembled to
listen to a recital of the reasons
that prompted the president to leave
the shores of the United States to
participate in a peace conference in
a foreign land, but the motives were
not forthcoming and in consequence
the frost grew denser.
The president touched upon many
domestic questions that require so
lution but failed to take the legisla
tors into his confidence as to the
impelling cause for the historic jour
ney. 4
Feels Chill of Audience.
Then, too, there was lacking in
the president's voice its old-time
resource and he read his manuscript
as if he felt the chill about him and
yet was not able to dispel it, even
by the force of his own strong per
sonality.
The only real genuine applause
the president received was to his
splendid tribute to the soldiers,
sailors and marines, and their great
chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to
the youngest lieutenant, who went
forth to their terrible adventure
blithely and with the quick intelli
gence of those who know just what
it is they would accomplish.
"I am proud to be the fellow-countryman
of men of such stuff and
valor," said the nation's chief. With
the utterance of these words the
members of congress, representa
tives of the supreme court and pack
ed galleries gave Mr. Wilson heart
felt ovation, only to settle back
again waiting for the words that
would tatisfy the nation that his
going abroad was made necessary
by the European situation.
Senate Resents Neglect.
Still they never came. The silence
at times was oppressive, throughout
the chamber.
The old spontaneity was lacking
in the hearty handclapping, even on
the part of the democrats. At least
two-thirds of the senate made no
demonstration whatsoever through
out the reading of the message.
They showed by their action that
they resented the president's failure
ta appoint one or two of their num
mer peace conferees and when he
passed the "buck" so to speak, as to
government ownership of railroads,
admitting that he had no solution
to offer, the situation became al
most tragic. It seemed as if the
president had become a special
pleader.
Hitchcock as Escort.
Senator Hitchcock, who was
made a member of the committee to
escort the president to the rostrum,
was forced to fake a seat in the
space reserved for the supreme
court by reason of the crowded con
dition of the hall -of the house and
sat next to Mr. Justice McReyrfolds,
probably the nearest the senator
will ever come to occupying a seat
on the supreme bench. It was no
ticeable that the senator was al
most the last to arise when the
president left the hall.
All the members of the Nebraska

cause we were keyed up to ex
pect that he would tell us some
of his reasons for going abroad
and discuss the particular proj

peace conference.
"Instead of that, he gave us
generalities expressed in his
usual charming style."
CUMMINS WANTS
SENATORS SENT
TO CONFERENCE
Iowan Proposes Upper House
Dispatch Committee to
Peace Meet to Report

Washington, Dec. 2 Senator Cum
mins of Iowa, republican, introduced
today a resolution proposing that a
senate committee of four democrats
and four republicans be sent to
France for the peace conference, to
keep the senate informed on ques
tions arising there.
Senator Kellogg of Minnesota, re
publican, declared he would oppose
the resolution and hoped it would
be sent to the foreign affairs com
mittee and there killed.
On motion of Senator Hitchcock
of Nebraska, chairman of the foreign
relations committee, the resolution
was referred to that committee. Ex
cept for the statement of Senator
Kellogg there was no discussion of
the merits of the measure.
Text of Resolution.
The resolution proposes:
"It is resolved by the senate, that
there be created a committee to 1e
composed of eight senators one
half from the majority and one-half
from the minority which shall be

to be there present during the said
peace conference.
"The committee shall diligently
inquire with respect to all the facts
pertaining to or material for the
future consideration of the proposed
treaties by the senate and make
itself familiar with all the condi

which may exist for and against
the action to be taken. It shall
report to the senate upon all such
matters, as often as it may deem it
advisable to do so, and it shall make
a final report at or before the time
that the treaties growing out of the
conference are laid before the senate

"The committee shall be chosen

essary for the discharge of the

Charges Be Dismissed
Washington, Dec. 2. A formal
report recommending dismissal of
proceedings involving disloyalty
charges against Senator LaFollette
of Wisconsin on account of his
speech before the Nonpartisan
league at St. Paul in September, 1917,
was presented to th senate today
by Senator Dillingham of, Vermo"t
(republican), acting for the majority
of the privileges and elections committee.
Washington, Dec. 2. Congress, in joint session today,
heard President Wilson announce formally his purpose to at
tend the peace conference and give his views on the part the
government should play in dealing with after-the-war prob
lems. Democrats of the house received the announcement with
cheers, in which some senators joined; the republicans were
silent almost throughout the address except when the presi
dent referred to the valor and efficiency of America's sol
diers and mentioned the names of Pershing and Sims.
Threatened interruptions by members who disapprove
of the trip and of the president's failure to include a senator
among the peace delegates, however, did not materialize.
SENATORS FEEL SNUBBED.
During the first hour of the new session, Senator Cum
mins of Iowa (republican), introduced a resolution to send a
committee of eight senators to Paris, to keep the senate ad
vised of the progress of the peace conference and in the house
Representative Rodenburg of Illinois (republican), had offer
ed a resolution proposing that the vice president take over the
executive functions upon the departure of Mr. Wilson from
the country. Senator Sherman of Illinois (republican), an
nounced later that he would submit tomorrow a resolution
similar to that of Representative RodenBurg except that it
would declare the office of president vacant.
GREAT CROWD HEARS TALK.
The president's annual address was read before a
crowd that filled floors and gallaries. He reviewed at length
the country's accomplishments in the war, paying tribute to
the armed forces and to loyal workers7 at home. Among
other things, he disclosed that he thinks the problem of re
adjustment is taking care of itself without government aid.
RAILROADSUP TO CONGRESS.
Much of the address was devoted to the railroad prob
lem, for which the president said he now had no solution to)
offer. He recommended careful study by congress, saying it
would be a disservice to the country and to the railroads to
permit a return to old conditions under private management
without modifications.
The president declared he stood ready to release the rail
roads from government control whenever a satisfactory plan
of readjustment could be worked out.
The president said he hoped to see a formal declaration
of peace by treaty "by the time spring has come.''
ENDORSES BIG NAVY.
The new three-year naval building program was en
dorsed because the president said it would be unwise to at
tempt to adjust the American program to a future world pol
icy as yet undetermined.
,Paying tribute to the people's conduct in war, he spbke
particularly of the work of women and '.again appealed for
woman suffrage by federal amendment.
' Declaring he had no "private thought or purpose" in go
ing to France, but that he regarded it as his highest duty, the
president added:
"It is now my duty to play my full part in making good
what they (America's soldiers) offered their life's blood to
obtain." - ,
Wants Food For Starving.
No definite program of recon
struction can be outlined now, Mr.
Wilson said. He expressed the hope
that' congress would not object to
conferring upon the War Trade
board or some other agency the
right of fixing export priorities to
assure shipment of food to starving
people abroad.
As 'to taxation the president in
dorsed the plan for levying $6,000,
000,000 in 1919, and for notifying
the public in advance that the 1920
levy will be $4,000,000,000.
The president concluded after
speaking 42 minutes, and left the
chamber amidst applause limited to
the democratic side. Interruptions
of the address for questions which
had been threatened by some repub
lican members of the house did not
materialize.
No Debate on Message.
-There was no debate in either
house on the president's trip to
France. The only reference to it
in the house was made by. Represen
tative Mann of Illinois, the republi
can leader, after the president had
delivered his annual address at the
joint session in the house chamber.
"I am not objecting to the presi

gentleman on the majority side of
the house ought to be able to in

pursued when matters come before
