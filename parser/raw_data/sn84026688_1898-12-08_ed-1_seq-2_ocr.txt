Remarkable Rescue.
Mrs. Michael Curtain, Pain field. 111.,
makes the statement, that she caught
cold, which settled on her Jungs; she
was treated lor a month by her family
physician, but grew worse. He told her
she was a hopeless victim of consump
tion and that no medicine could cure
her. Her druggist suggested Dr. King’s
New Discovery for Consumption; she
bought a bottle and to her delight found
herself beaefitted from first dose. SShe
continued its use and after taking six
bottles, found herself sound and well;
now does her own housework, and is as
well as she ever was. Free trial bottlea
of this Great Discovery at Waters' Pha
rmacy. Large bottles 50 cents and sl.
WASHIWG?ON letter.
From our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, Dec. sth, 1898.
The importance of the subjects dealt
with is ample excuse for the unusual
length of President McKinley’s annual
message to Congress, the greater portion
of which is about the war, the events
leading up to it, connected with and
following it, up to the acceptance ol our
terms of Peace. The general tone of
the message is highly commended; also
the handling of the more or less deli
cate question connected with our ac
quirement of the Philippines. It is free
from rancor and bombast,although fully
recognizing the unprecedented achieve
ments of the country in the war with
Spain. Its dominant note is patriotism
of the highest order—patriotism, such
as every good American feels, regard
less of political affiliation and can en
dorse. If the sentiment in Congress ie
representative ot that of tbs country,
and it usually is, the message will be
generally commended.
While the legislation of the session
of Congress, which opened to day, will
have little direct connection with the
newly acquired territory of the country,
several of the regular appropriation bills
notably those for the army and for the
navy, as well as the bill for the increase
of the regular army, will furnish texts,
for many speeches on that subject, and
tho talk of Senators and Representa
tives indicates an intention to take full
advantage of those texts. Consequently
the debates of the present session are
expected to be unusually lively and in
teresting.
i There is a disposition among promi
nent republican Senators to fight shy of
committing themselves either for or
against holding an early Spring extra
session of Congress, fo consider finan- !
cittl legislation, regardless of whether
failure of the present session to pass all
the legislation actually necessary makes
an extra session imperative. Senator
Allison was asked plainly whether be
was in favor of an extra session to con
sider financial legislation, but he adro
itly declined to commit himsell and
answered the question by saying: "The
President must decide whether or not
ihe new Oongressball speedily assemble;
we have nothing to do with the ques
tion." He was also averse to express
ing on opinion, saying when asked to
do so; "So many things may happen in
the next three months that a prediction
at this time regarding an extra session,
must be necessarily based upon the mer
est speculation."
Secretary Alger says, in his annual
report, in favor of his recommendation
that it be provided in the legislation
for increasing the regular army to 100,
000 men, that natives of islands occu
pied by our troops may be enlisted:
"These men are acclimated, understand
the language and habits of their coun
trymen, and their enlistment will not
ouly give them employment, but also
have the tendency to enable the govern
ment to get into closer touch with their
people than it would otherwise be able
to do. This would also relieve our own
men from serving in those climates to a
large extent, and would, moreover, en
able the volunteers to be mustered out
of the service and return to the avoca
tions of civil life." That last sentence
will do more to hurry army legislation
than any other one thing. Every Sen
ator and Representative is besieged
with requests to get this or that regi
ment of volunteers mustered out, and
they all know that no considerable
number of the volunteers will be or
dered mustered out until Congress pro
vides for the enlistment of regulars to
take their places. It is believed that
this peculiar situation will keep men
quiet who otherwise would bitterly op
pose the bill providing for the increase
ot the regular army.
Senator Hale sees nothing but trouble
and expense in the annexation of the
Philippines, end declares his intention
to fight the ratification of the treaty of
peace to the full extent of his ability,
regardless of what other Senatois may
do. Mr, Hale's pictures of the calami
ties likely to follow the ratification of
the treaty of peace would be truly awful
if he could make everybody see through
his eyes. But it has not been forgotten
that Mr. Hale drew some very weird
pictures of what would happen to this
country if it dared to make war on
Spain, which were a long ways from
what actually did happen; therefore his
doleful talk isn't fetching any tears of
alarm.
The probability of Nicaragua Canal
legislation is going to be a good thing
for Washington hotel keepers, this win
tin, and it may be that some inpecuue
ous statesmen who will be dropped Irom
Uncle Sam’s pay roll at the close of the
present Congress, will also handle some
of the Panama Canal Company's money
which it is understood will be liberally
spent to block Nicaragua Canal legisla
tion. The house is the doubtful body;
the Senate is knowp to be overwhel
mingly favorable to the construction of
the Nicaragua Canal bv this govern
ment. There are signs that the admin
istration will use its influence upon the
House in favor of canal legislation.

A startling incident, ot which Mr.
John Oliver of Philadelphia, was the
subject, is narrated by him us follows;
"1 was in a most dreadful condition.
My skin was almost yellow, eyes sunken,
tongue coated, pain coutiually in back
and sides, no appetite—gradually grow
ing weaker day by day. Three physi
cians had given me up. Fortunately,
a friend advised trying 'Electric Bitters;'
and to my great joy and surprise, the
first bottle made a decided improve
ment. I continued their use for three
weeks,aud am now a well man. I know
they saved my life, and robbed the grave
of another victim." No one should fail
to try them. Only 50 cents per bottle
at Waters’ Pharmacy.

In military prisons an offender is some
times sentenced to carry cannon balls from
one place to another and pile them up all
day lons'. That is all. Perhaps it does not
seem very terrible but it soon wears his
life out. It is practically a death sentence,
and he knows it; he would rather be shot.
Many a sick man feels the same way about
the Durden of disease that he is fugging
back and forth from day to day. He would
as soon be down with a mortal disease. It
will come to that sooner or later.
A man’s life can be dragged out by
dyspepsia and liver complaint. The ex
perience of Mr. J. T. Cardwell, of Fall
Creek Depot, Pittsylvania Co., Va., shows
how Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discov
ery saves people from consumption by
waking up their nutritive organism and
giving it power to supply pure t healthy
blood, which drives out blood poisons and
dead tissues and builds up sound, whole
some flesh and muscle.
“ I feel it my duly,” writes Mr. Cardwell in a
letter to Dr, Pierce, ” to write you of the lasting
benefits derived from the use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery and little 1 Pellets.’
Seven years ago I contracted a severe cold,
which baffled the skill of one of the best phy
sicians in my State. It ran on and I continu
ally grew worse until I concluded to write to
the ‘World's Dispensary Medical Association.'
The answer to ray inquiry advised me to use
‘Golden Medical Discovery’ and ‘Pellets' for
indlgestiou and liver complaint; at this time
two months had passed. In two or three days
after I had commenced the use of your medi
cine my cough had entirely stopped, my diges
tion was better, my low spirits driven away and
I felt new life and vigor in my whole body.”
Thi marvelous “Discovery” makes
nerve force aud rugged power. It is far
better than oily emulsions ; it does not
make flabby fat, it does not increase the
weight of corpulent people.
