To Xpw Haven.
. In the Borough court Tuesday a
young -. man was before the judije
charged with being a common drunn
ard. He was before the court .No
vember 17. when under promise tliat
he would keep out of the place and
reform, Judge Hungerford gave him
another chance. This, we are told,
was the fifteenth time he had been
trailed upon to plead at the bar since
1895, commencing his career when he
was between seventeen and eighteen.
There Is in town three or four more
of the same sort, who have not only
been an annoyance, but a big bill of
expense to the borough. Judge Hun
gerford know all these boys and their
parents, and has dealt very gently
with them, so much so that they seem
to prefer to go to jail than to keep
sober. Some of our saloonkeepers
would refuse to sell to them under any
circumstances, but there are others,
At the Labratory.
James O. May, president of the Dia
mond Labratory Co, has his office
now at the labratory on Xorth Church
street. Mr McGuire, who was his
manager at the drug store, has go-ie
on the road to sell the goods manu
factured at the labratory. Miss Bing
ham is bookkeeper in Mr May's office
and Victor Anderson remains with Mr
Wood, who has also employed a sec
ond clerk, thus giving him two
licensed men for his prescription couu-j
ter. I

The Masquerade.
The committee having the matter in
charge of the,, masquerade dance of
Gavel lodge, K. of P., deserve consid
erable credit for the manner in which
the affair was handled. It passed off
pleasantly, about, fifty couples taking
part. On December 15 the Oddfellows
will have their masquerade at the hall
In lily's block. Terrill will furnish
music and. Prof Baxter will prompt.
A Filthy Spot.
. The open ditch running on the
south side of the coat shop is now the
receptacle of all the sewage from the
hill near Fairview avenue. We took
occasion to look in the ditch yester
day within four feet of the sidewalk,
and found it a very filthy spot. Now
that a. concrete walk is expected to be
Ja1d on that side of the street, there
should be a large tile laid across the
way from Church street to the rail
road track. It will be a plague spot
next summer if not taken care of.

THE JAMESON RAID.
On December 2i3, 1895. a manifesto
was issued by the Transvaal National
Union, in which -the demands of the
Ft.'anders were stated, savs Alljyne
Ire laud in the DecemDer Atlantic. Tho
principal demands were, the establish
ment of the republic as a true repuD-lic-
a constitution framed by the jcp
reseutatives of. the whole people,
which should be safeguarded against
hasty alteration; an equitable franchise
law, and . the independence of tu
courts of justice. If these demands
were not granted it was decided to at
tempt the overthrow of the government
by force of arms. Owing to Jjisnn
drrstanding. lr Jameson of the Brit
ish South Africa comuany. who wit'i
j.-i body of men' was on the frontier
trendy to give aid if fighting were re
I sorted to, entered the Transvaal, villi
liis force, before the time appointed
and thus entirely destroyed the pitas
ii-. uje national t moil, l ne sio-y ui
ihe Jameson raid' is too long to enter
into; but it may be remarked t!i't
every effort was made by the high
commissioner and by Cecil Rhodes to
recall Jameson before he met the Boers
that the raid was promptly condemned
by the British authorities and that Dr
Jameson and his officers were subse
qtu ntly tried, convicted and imprisoned
by a British court of justice fur viola
tion of the foreign enlistments act. Tho
most important fact-to be noted in con
nection with the proposed Johannes
burg rising and the raid is that they
were only planned and subscriber! to
after the most solemn assurance had
been given that there was to be no
attempt to bring the. Transvaal under
the British flag, and that if the plan
succeeded a true republic should De
formed.
The four Johannesburg leaders of
the National Union were' sentenced to
death, but this was subsequently al
tered to 15 years' imprisonment, and
finally to a fine of $100,000. Fifty-nhie
of the men who formed the reform
j committee were imprisoned for some
mouths, and had to pay a fine ol $10.

Prohibition In Georsrin.
ATLANTA, Dec. 7. The debute on
the Willingham bill, wSich provides for
state prohibition, was beuun in the Geor
gia senate yesterday. The measure has
passed the lower hour-e of the general as
sembly, where it received a good majori
ty. The opponents of tie bill claim they
hare 25 out of 44 vote in the senate and
that the hill will be defeated when the
vote is taken today. Great interest is
felt in the bill, and the advocates of pro
hibition are making a strong " fight to
have it become a law. The bill provides
for the abolition of all saloons, breweries
and legalized distilleries. Clubs or pri
vate organizations will not be allowed to
give intoxicating liquors to members or
other persons, but this does not apply to
private entertainments or banquets.
Thonslit Dead, not Was Alive.
MIDDLETOWN. N. Y., Dec. 7. Max
Hemeyer. an apprentice on the United
States ship Alliance,- surprised his pa
rents here yesterday when he appeared
before them after an absence of many
months. They had heard that he had
been washed overboard when his ship
was 900 miles off the island of St. Thom
as and mourned him .iis dead. He said
that he had been washed overboard at
night, but had attracted the attention of
the men on board fchip by continually
whistling until he was picked up.
TWO POINTED QUESTIONS AN
SWERED. What is the use of making a better
article than your competitor if you can
not get a better price for it?
Ans. As there is no difference in the
price the public will buy only the bet
ter, so that while our profits may be
smaller on a single sale the will be
much greater in the aggregate.
How can you get the public to know
your make is the best?
If both articles are brought promi
nently before the public both are cer
tain to be tried and the public will
very quickly pass judgment on them
and use only -the better one.

THE MESSAGE IN CUBA.
Tfce Press of tlie Island Resounds
With MeKinley'a Praise.
HAVANA, Dec. 7. President McKin
ley's message to congress has been re
ceived by Cubans of all classes with
much satisfaction. Even the leaders ot
the extreme party admit this, and the
announcement that there will be no
American . civil governor has cleared
away most of the clouds that had been
hanging over the Cuban political situa
tion. The Lucha alone among the papers
still favors a civil governorship. Genera)
Collazo soys:
"The message will pacify the country.
President McKinley's statements are not
very concrete, but if congress guarantees
the iudependence of Cuba we need not
ask for any specification as to time or
for the removal of the American troops,
although everybody would be glad to see
tho black troops go because of the ex
cesses they commit.
"Cubans fear the administration, but
Jbey do not fear congress. The adminis
tration represents the trusts. Although
Cubans are as good business men as
Americans they could not compete with
the enormous power of the trusts, which,
by creating monopolies, would eventually
enslave the workingman. We wish o
see each man owning some property, at
least enough to make it worth his while
to behave as a good citizen should, in
stead of going to the woods."
The Discusion says:
"President McKinley's message will
fill tho hearts of all lovers of Cuba with
joy. His words 'Whatever be the out
come, we must see to it that free Cuba
be a reality, not a name,' should be
written in letters of gold over 1he door
of the Cuban White House. The Cuban
republic will be bound to Lincoln and
McKinley by indissoluble bonds of
love."
The Fatria says:
"Hurrah for President McKinley. He
could not have spoken in clearer tones.
It is impossible for the giddiness of con
quest to overpower the deep, natural im
pulse of a noble and democratic people."
The Cubano says:
"The message ' contains the clearest
words yet spoken by President McKinley
and shows that justice is the guiding
principle at Washington. Our hearts,
hitherto bowed down by tremendous
skepticism, are now relieved, and we may
expect congress to speak still more clear-
iy." -

of I.mon.
MANILA, Dee. 7. Hope of ending the
insurrection and halting military opera
tions in the Philippines, which seemed
so bright a few days ago, has again fad
ed into the uncertain future.
M'ach has been accomplished. During
the last few weeks the campaigning has
been almost phenomenal. -
In dreadful weather, through a devas
tated country, . across swollen rivers,
Wong., roads that were impassable for
wagons, artillery and in some cases for
cavalry, the advances of the troops have
been so rapid and in so many directions
that they have often been beyond the
military telegraph lines, and operations
have necessarily been independently con
ducted by the field commanders. The ar
my is rightfully proud. . i
The insurgents have had a series of
routs and disasters. The slaughter has
been great. They have lost a large quan
tity of supplies and munitions of war,
and more than l,l00 of their armed men
have surrendered or been captured dur
ing their retreat in the last few weeks.
Their government has been scattered
or captured. What of it is at liberty is
in flight. A portion of Aguinaldo's fami
ly is in our lines. Aguinaldo himself is a
fugitive.
Still we hold less than one-third of the
area of Luzon, but. what we hrve is the
most desirable territory.
Indications are that Aguinaldo escaped
to the north with a much larger body of
troops than was at first supposed. This
force, reported at from 2.000 to 3,000
men, was originally recruited in the
northern provinces, ancT the men are re
puted to be good lighters.
