The Recent Railroad Record.
The Interstate Commerce Commission's
report shows more than the
inadequate earnings of the railroads
not only from the point of view of
making a reasonable return 011 investment
but from the prAnt of view
of commanding the means to maintain
the properties. It shows as well
that in spite of low earnings private
management is more careful than
Government operation about keeping
up essential equipment. All this has
a direct and important bearing upon
the railroad recommendations in
President Harding's strong message.
The carriers' earnings are and.
\ since the present railroad act went
into operation, have been "clearly an
inadequate income." Nevertheless
there have been downward rate adjustments
with the purp?se of >emoving
rate interference with the
free flow of commerce. AVhether for
this reason or for other reasons the
1922 tonnage movement of the roads
up to now lias steadily increased.
Nothing has yet developed, however,
to put the roads as a whole on anything
like the earning basis contemplated
by the law under which the
commission functions.
Nevertheless some of the greatest
of the transportation systems, like
the Pennsylvania in the Kast and the
In ion Pacific in the West, are making
voluntary wage increases. With
r shortage of day labor owing to the
suicidal restrictions of the immigration
act such roads must go into
the labor market under the law of
supply and demand and bid for wa?e
earners to keep their roadbeds in
condition and do the other maintenance
work upon which depend the
rery foundations of the carriers.
Their labor costs will be going up.
therefore, while their traffic receipts
fall off with the seasonal decline now
due in freight movements.
On the other hand, the roads, crippled
though they were by their financial
condition, have shown their ability
to handle a rising volume of
traffic. The car loadings, which in
January of this year were 3,060,167
and in May 3,446,946. were up to
3,765,764 in June and 3,930.161 in
August, notwithstanding coal strikes
and shopmen's strikes. In October
they were 4,301.487.
At the same time the locomotive
inspections by the commission for
the fiscal year ended June 30 last
revealed better conditions under
irlvate management, handicapped
though it was by low earnings and
other circumstances, than when the
roads were under Government control
or Just emerging from the effects
of Government control.
The locomotive defects found by
the inspectors, for example, were
*135.300 in 1919 (fiscal year), while
in 1921 they were 104.848. In 1922
they were 101,734.
The percentage of locomotives
found defective in 1918 (fiscal year)
was 53. It was 58 in 1919; 52 in
1920: 50 in 1921, while in 1922 it
was 48.
Everything about the railroad sec rd,
in fact, goes to prove that the
American iransporumon system a'irs
not thrive under Government operation.
The West Side Subway.
The figures gathered by the Tran?lt
Commission relative to ticket
aalea on the subways in the year that
nded .Tune 30 tell a story of greater
congestion.
It Is only necessary to take the
Increases on one line, the West Side
Intarborougb, to see what has been
happening.
The sales at Fourteenth street increased
2,400 a day; at Pennsylvania
' station. 3.600 a day: nt Times Square.
g,500 a day. All this pressure was
added to a line already so choked
with traffli' that it could bear no
wore trains. The Increases mean
fltat three stations, whose total traffic
bad been 172.000 passengers a day.
had to taka on nearly 15,000 more
paaaangers daily.
It was avident years ago that the
l?'eat Side subway had reached its
^ilt; that a great new trunk line
?lt be built. But to-day. at least
Vytara after the new line should
k
! have been started, nothing has been
' done. The Transit Commission's
great plan for a doable deck, eight
; track trunk line In Eighth avenue
; was held up in City Hall.
Truly the new administration at
Albany will have a grave problem
to face; particularly grave from a
political standpoint because a disappointed
public is losing patience.
Wheat for the .World.
The I'nited States to-day is the
; incomparable wheat growing country
of the world. Its great good fortune
in respect of its vast wheat crop,
however, is not the unsurpassed
quantity we have to sell to the rest
of the world. It is that we can supplv
all our own bread and then have
| wheat left over to help feed nations
that cannot supply their own bread.
As a matter of fact, out of our
crop of 810,000,000 bushels of wheat
this year we require for our own
consumption, for bread and for seeding,
about 600,000,000 bushels, That
leaves about 200,000,000 bushels for
sale abroad. But Canada, with a crop
of about 300,000,000 bushels, can sell
about 350,000,000 bushels because the
I other 40,000,000 bushels is more than
enough to provide the bread for
Canada's population.
; There is much the same story to
tell of Argentina with a crop of
j 1S0.000.000 bushels and Australia
with 132.000,000. There are rela\
tively few mouths to feed in both
j those wheat growing countries put
together. While only 25 per cent, of
iour wheat crop is in excess of our
home requirements, about 75 per
; cent of their wheat output is in excess
of their home requirements.
Canada's population of 9,000,000,
I good for 390,000,000 bushels of wheat;
' Argentina's 8,500.000 population, good
tor 180,000,000 bushelsT'and Australia's
5,500,00V population, good for
132,000.000 bushels?this means only
23,000,000 people to feed at home
with more than 700,000,000 bushels
of wheat at their own doors, as
against over 110,000,000 population
with 800,000,000 bushels of wheat.
That is why this country is not the
j source of the world's wheat export
I supply, because we don't sell ours for
the most part; we eat it.
And this is why Canada with her
I imports again held down and with
some 350,000,000 bushels of wheat
to sell abroad at better than a dollar
a bushel no longer has any problem
of a heavily depressed foreign exchange
to distract her industry and
business. Canada's currency, in
; iruin, even as measureu in uuhcu
! States gold, has been quoted in New
; York recently more often at a pre;
mium than at a discount.
When you sell the goods the other
fellow pays you?that's the exchange
I problem in a nutshell.
Cheap Heat From Electricity.
! Professor Rhoi.na.ld A. Fesbkndex,
whose achievements in electrical
engineering entitle him to be heard
with respect, offers to demonstrate
that houses in Boston can be heated
by electricity for what it would cost
to produce the same temperatures
| were coal selling at from $2.50 to $2
!a ton.
Without going into the elaborately
worked out technical details it may
i be said that there is predicated an
electric power station in the anthra|
cite regions from which the heating
effect of one ton of coal could he delivered
in Boston over a wire 252
miles long from, say, Scrantou for
$1. The freight rate for a ton of
coal is about $2.50.
With this as a starter other economics
are indicated which would reduce
heating costs to the low figure
mentioned. And this is saying nothing
of the benefit of getting rid of
i the smudge and dirt incident to
handling even the cleanest coal, and
I saying nothing also of the eliminated
eost of furnace care and ash dispot'.
ion. Professor Frssekdex proposes
to use Boston, and ultimately
all of Massachusetts, to demonstrate
the practicability of his plan. To
the Bay State the inventor offers the
free use of his devices accompanied
by his personal supervision of their
Installation.
Here surely is a matter carrying a
I strong appeal to the traditional New
England thrift. Discount the inventor's
forecast by, say, 50 per cent, and
there still remains a vast margin of
public benefit. But how is the project
going to affect the coal mining industry?
Professor FrsarxDEx's answer
| is simple: there isn't going to be any
coal mining industry. He believes
that long before the end of the pres
ent century coal mining will have
come to an end. except possibly for
some chemical manufactures.
"With the sun radiating over
4.000,000 horse-power on every square
mile of earth surface, of which more
than 10 per cent, can be obtained by
known methods of power storage by
which a horse-power hour can be
stored for a week at a. cost of onefifteenth
of a cent, and the fact that
generating stations where it is not
! cloudy can supply stations with
cloudy areas, what." asks Profeasor
KEK&Exnr.s. "are the probabilities
that we shall continue to hother
about mining coal or that 99 per
I cent, of the coal areas will ever
: bring their owners a single cent an
acre?" "
As for the talk about the necessity
j of our conserving fuel. that, says
Professor FEssrjtnr.r*. Is based on a
I mistake. "The fundamental reason
! why coal is so high." says Professor
i FESSEXttr.tr. "is that there is so much
! more of It than can ever he used."
United S|ates Geological Survey reports
are quoted to show that the
I United States has enough high grade
icoal actually located to last. 10.000
years at tbg present rate uf consuaip

tion. And this is taking no accou

And then there are the oil shale d
posits. The Government experts ai
j independent mining interests a
| quoted as 6aying these sources

! with all the gasoline and oil we slu
' need for the next 20,000 years.
! With coal at staggering prices, ai
hard to-get at that, these certain
i are interesting assurances. Will n

I Canada's Immigrant Campaig
Canada has again launched a cai
paign to attract American farmers

I advantages are minimized. As

are not marked enough to be a sei

the one now under way have be
conducted in the past. Th^y we

Some of them remained iu their n?
homes. Not a few returned to t
United States.
That Canada's situation as regar
population is unsatisfactory has lo
been evident. Latterly the subji
has been enraging the verv serio
attention of Dominion authorlti
and business Interests. In Octofc
last there was an important confe
ence on the subject. In response
i c. Government summons represenl
j tives of transportation companii
j leading immigrant officials afid hea
I of the newly organized Canadian C<
I onization Association assembled
j Ottawa.
The facts they laid before the Mi
j ister of Immigration were disturbir
j The Canadian Pacific and the Can
jdlan National railroads, the Canadii
j Pacific steamships and three gre
transatlantic steamship lines were j
! represented by a single spokesma
I At the outset he made the broi
statement tJiat in the decade 191
1921 Canada lost to the United Stat
every immigrant that came to h
i shores and nearly 300,000 perso
I,
j besides.
He estimated tne population
! Canada in 1911 at 7,206,643. By nj
j ural Increase this population in 19
should have been 9,043,050. To th
i figure should be added the 1,975,3
immigrants who arrived in the df
ade. With these additions Cana
in 1921 ought to have had a popul
tion of 11,018,443.
But the actual population
Canada in 1921 was 8,769,494, or 31:
572 less than the 1911 populath
plus the ten years total of immigra
arrivals, and 273,556 less than mlg
1 have been expected from natural i
i crease with immigration left entire
out of the calculation. In oth
words. Canada lost all of her near
2.000,000 immigrants and more thi
a quarter of a million populath
besides. These llgures moved t
Montreal .Star to remark that Cana<
was only Sam's sieve.
But it should be borne in mil
I that the particular decade in qu<
i tion was exceptional. It included t
1 war period, and during the oponi:
years of that period, when this cou

Canadian migration to the Unit

Stromboli in Eruption.
Cable dispatches report that Stroi

is unusually active in its eruptioi
As a matter of fact, Stromboli h

The crater of Stromboli is in t

To The New York Herald: Homo
m well known flat houses were in existW

jjj For instance, there was the Albany,
which Is in use to-day. It is a massive
building extending from Fifty-first to
m Fifty-second street on Broadway. At
one time it was the home of many well

with it In construction, al.though
never so well known, was the
Newport, on the south side of Fifty10

to Seventh avenue.
9- Many persons have told me that, the

building erected in New York. It ia
still in use. So is the Westmoreland, at

To The New York Herald: "In offerina

prise that The New York Herald
y should urge the temporary and perhaps
* misguided anger of the people as a reason
for urging an amendment to the

Fair child Hears Sym
Orchestra Gives American
Fly* Ballet Score?Mm
l?y W. J. HEJVUKRSOK. .
At tlie concert of the Symphony So- 4
ciety In Aeolian llall yesterday afier- ,
noon Walter Damrosch produced the |
music of Blair Palrohild's ballet pantomime
entitled "Dame Ubellule" *
(translated "Lady Dragon Fly"). M'".
Kairchild is an American who lives In
Paris, though he was here yesterday
and sat In a box listening to his own
score. lie studied music at Harvard ,
J and afterward in Florence, then de- j
j sorted melody for politics and served !
ds attache at the KmbaSsy In Constantinople,
and two years later re- /
turned to art. In Paris ho studied''
with Widor and Ganaye.
The ballet heard yesterday was first
performed at the Opera Comlque on
December 7, 1921, and will bo given ]
again this season. It has not yet ,
found its way to the stage on this side
| of the Atlantic, which is a pity, for
! the music distinctly calls for the
terpsichorean action to give it full !
| vitality. The story is fanciful. It I 1
i tells of the coquetry of a dragon fly
who excites the admiration of a toad '
and a beetle and is herself much in- \
terestcd in a green lizard until a
many colored butterfly floats Into i
view, whereupon she files off with 1
him into the sunset while the poor 1
toad dies and frogs sympathetically '
weep over him. J
Air. Fulrchild has not dwelt in Paris
for nothing, lie has learned how the (
Frenchmen write ballets, .and he has (
blithely followed them, but without 1
sacrificing his own identity. There is i
even a suggestion^1 of the good old i
canebrake of home in one of his,
melodies, and of this no boulevardier i"
could have thought. The thematic j
material or tno hunet. is cieariy arawn, j
and it furnishes subjects for a deal of (
clever musical descant in which poly- ,
phonic strands deftly woven into an i
Opulent web, ingeniously colored yet ;
perfectly sane harmonies and warmlytinted
orchestration all play their
parts. The composition has picturesque
ciuality and suggests a balletaction
which should bo highly effocti
ive if intrusted to good mimes. The
work was cordially applauded, and tho
composer acknowledged tho tribute
modestly. i
The other orchestral numbers on <
the list woro Weber's "Der Fret- ,
schuetz" overture, Brahms's "Chorale ,
| St. Anthony" variations and the over- i
i turo of Lalo's "T/O Ttol d'Ys." Of the <
first of these Mr. Dnmrosch gave a I i
"reading." It is a perfeetly romp#- , '
tent overture when let alone. It does '
not call for any "reading." All that (
is necessary is a good technical per- 1
formance. Give that to Weber and he ,
is quite able to take eara of himself. |
The technical features under the : f
reading were not flawless. The or- I
chestru sometimes plays with fewer 1

Of diamond dust upon her wings that K

And Santa Clans with bells and furs

The highway to the moon is strewn
with scores of broken things.

The blue silk dress you used to wear.
the flowers you tended, too.
The old piano that you loved before

I With roses and forget me nots and gilt ;

The highway to the moon Is made of

It's woven of the sheen of pearls, the (

the curse of all lands, of all time, of 1

while cases too flagrant to be hidden
by the mantle of old General Welfare r-'li
crop up, as i.n the Instance at hand. 1!r
An Illustration of even bolder, balder,
more impudent pretense is that of the J
Brio. Here it can be proved, indeed it
Is almost patent, that a ton of freight c
costs about those times more for car- 'do
riage than by rail. My computation In , f
the case, was made some time ago. It; '
included the cost of maintenance of the wi

by the ever paterna? State of New York. toi

First the request was for the canal. 1
Then when it was dug or nearly so It t'"c
was seen that there were no terminals W
worthy of the name. These were sup- j 8 '
piled, artd the latest Is that the State ; ^
shall go still deeper Into the_ pockets | tio
nf defenseless citlsens and buy boats 8 1
for the traffic. But I must call atten-j^
tlon to the outstanding fact that It Is nl"
a great and glorious thing for the fa- j f
vorito of government to got his freight j an
carried for 50 cents a ton when It aetu- J C
