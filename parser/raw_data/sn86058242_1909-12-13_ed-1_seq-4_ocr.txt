THE NEED OF HOMES.
And while the question of the need of homes and home builders Is being
discussed the fact might be pointed out that the city ordinances -which puts
a tax on progrssiveness by compelling the man -who is about to build a house
to pay from one dollar to five or ten for a permit is economically wrong.
A great many local men, who think along these lines, are of the opinion
that no improvements should be taxed. They say that the land alone should
be taxed and that a premium should be put on a man'B progressiveness by
exempting his improvements from taxation.
But there is no question that it discourages the building of homes to
make it necessary for a man to pay a fee for a building permit the instant
he begins work on the very Improvement that the business men are crying
for.
It would have been better If building
to the man whose home costs less than
made for permits in the case of buildings which cost more than $1,500.
But a better plan than that would
Inspector out of the city treasury and
cost of building inspection. Under
llshed as the owners of property would
burdens a much needed lift.
The Duluth-News-Tribune has the
"Some time cities will develop along the lines of sanity to the point
where they will consider it a good thing for the residents to build homes and
business houses. When that time comes they will encourage such invest
ments, and not begin taxing-them, with
"Then, when the buildings are erected, they will not make the owner
pay r.nt to the city for living in them. As it Is now, even in Duluth, it is at
least as cheap to rent as to own a home. The man who pays, say $35 a
month as rent, can save little or nothing in cash by building, and the reason
for this Is not the high rate of interest
if borrowed, but largely because of the
"This process begins with a building permit, which is, while first, almost
the crowning absurdity of them all. When a man decides to build, he must
take bis plans to the building inspector, who estimates the cost when com
pleted. Upon this is based a fee of $1.50, if it is the humble home of the
poor man who is trying to house himself and family in two or three clean
and decent rooms, to cost not over $500."
. "If the cost is over that sum, $1 is added for each additional $500 or
fraction thereof, so that the modest home of the worklngman, in which he
will invest $1,200 to $1,500, must pay the tribute of $3.50. The same increase
is made up to $10,000, and the man of moderate means, who wants a $4,000
or $5,000 home, must pay $8.50 or $9.50 for the privilege of building it."
"When the class of the rich is reached, that is, above the $10,000 mark,
the fee is cut to one-fourth and is 50 cents for each additional $1,000. This
is but the usual discrimination against justice, which would make the fee
start at the $10,000 house and produce revenue enough to leave the poor
man free of this tax."
"But could anything more repugnant to just ordinary common horse
sense be conceived than this initial tax on building, provided cities want
buildings and want their people to own their own homes? Under present
conditions each structure adds just so much to the assessment rolls and the
tax revenues. Why, then, discourage the increase of taxable property by
this fee?"
BECKER ON HAMMOND'S ALLEYS.
The TIMES has critized Mayor Becker severely for many of his offi
cial act3 but these criticisms have been made in the hope that by fearlessly
pointing out what this paper believes have ben the mistakes of the administration-some
of them may be avoided in the future.
But the TIMES is fair enough to also point out any good moves that
Mayor Becker may make and any act of his that will make Hammond a big
ger, better and more beautiful city, that will give it the reputation that Gary
has of doing big things, will be given the stamp of this paper's approval.
At the "Get Together and Bury the Hatchet" banquet, given at the
Masonic temple in Hammond, Mayor .Becker pointed out the deplorable con
dition of Hammond's alleys.
He showed only too plainly that the business men in the mercantile dis
trict of the city have discouraged any effor" on the part of the city to pave
the alleys and have remonstrated against such improvements even when the
need of them has been plainly apparent.
Mayor Becker said in the future the city administration expected to take
up the question of paving the alleys and if the property owners oppose this
improvement the city will . pave them any way.
It was just such determination that is responsible for the fact that
Hammond has cement walks all over town instead of the old wooden walks
that once were the shame of the city. The people were forced to see the
error of their ways and now there is no one who is not glad that Mayor
Knotts had the backbone to force the improvement.
Now if Mayor Becker forced the property owners in the business dis
trict of the city to pave the alleys, whether they are disposed to do so or not,
posterity will thank him and the TIMES will give him its support in his
plan to see the matter through.
It is a shame that property owners who have made fortunes out of
Hammond real estate should be so reluctant to do their share towards mak
ing Hammond a metropolis.
ON MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY.
Don't put off your plans for making Christmastide a happy time for some
one. Make them now, make them early. If you haven't children of your own
to make happy, see if there isn't some other little tots that you can make
happy. See if there isn't some poor family that you can single out and give
them the gladdest surprise they ever had in the world. Forget society and
business long enough to come into the life of some suffering soul with cheer
lness and optimism. Don't make light of the season of the year that should
be given over to deeds that will make your own heart glow with the know
ledge that everything in this world isn't sordid, that the pursuit of the
almighty dollar 13 not everything. There are those around you whose
hearts ache with the desperate pursuit of pennies that will hold body and
soul togther. They are the ones you should seek out and help. Now is
the time to look them up and get ready to make them remember Christmas
of 1909 for years to come. Don't wait until December 24. Do it now. You
'ill be amply repaid.

THE VILLAGE OF EOPE.
Over the hill to the poorhouse I can't
quite make it clear.
Over the bills to the poorhouse It seems
- so horrid and queer.
The poorhouse, often the dreariest
place in every countryside, was so
called in the old days, when paupers
were treated as little better than
beasts and all insane people were put
in irons.
It was a name that spelled terror to
the unfortunate.
Now there is being built at Oak For
est, about eighteen miles from Chi
cago, a real home for the poor of
Cook county. It stands on a high tract
of rolling land in a fine grove of oaks
and will cost when completed 52,000,
000. It is not named poorhouse.
It Is called the Village of Hope.
That strikes a new note in humani-
tarianism. It proposes to put hope
Into the hearts of the hopeless.
This new home is a real village of
streets, each cottage by Nitself. Old
married couples are not to be sepa
rated into wards, but will occupy the
rooms together, where they can help
and comfort one another.
Life will be made worth while by
broad, open porches, recreation rooms,
a chapel, an artificial iake and all sur
roundings of comfort.
But will it pay?
That is the question the taxpayer
asks the county commissioners.
The answer is: "Yes. It will pay.
even in dollars and cents."
There is a fine farm, with barns, Im
plements, tools. The people will be
glad to works best they can under
such conditions. Those who cannot
work on the farm can do housework or
go Into the shops. '
The people will be kept happy by
being kept busy and under conditions
that will pr6mote self respect. If they
work for their living they are not
paupers.
It 13 claimed that with pleasant
homes and cheerful surroundings the
workers will support not only them
selves, but will in time repay the
$2,000,000.
That is the experience at Cleveland,
O., where a similar experiment has
been made.
The world moves.
The time is coming when the grim,
prison-like, dreary quarters of the
county poorhouse will give way to vil
lages of hope.
Society owes its aged and unfortu
nate a chance to live out their lives
not only In peace, but In comfort.
Most of them have already done their
share of the world's work.

Saturday vetoed the ordinances pro

not change their positions.

Dear Santa Claus: I thought I would
write you a brief letter. As we thought
that Santa Claus wouldn't come to us
any more as our dear mother died one
year ago and we are now left orphans,
as Santa Claus you must know what a
home is without a mother. I hope that
this letter will not be throwed in the
waste basket.
