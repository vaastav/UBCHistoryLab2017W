SUSPECT GREEK
GIFTS IN SENATE
President's Friends Look Askance
Upon Sudden Conversions to
Bate Reform.
EASY TO CHANGE THE
EFFECT OF MEASURE
Senators Will Be Watched Closely
Lest Trick Make Rate
Bill Worthless.
By W. W. Jermane.
"Washington, Dec. 7.The belief,
which is gaming ground daily, that the
railroad opposition to the president's
program has in large pait subsided, and
that some of the railroad senators may
even support the administration bill,
has started a good manv people in
Washington to talking about the Greeks
bearing gifts. Already it is being said
that these men, former opponents of the
administration policy, should be
watched closely.
It is an old trick in legislation to
have alleged friends of a particular bill
nullifv its provisions bv some slight
amendment, sometimes of one word, a
preposition, a coniunction or an adiec
tive. It is believed here by many that
this is what the friends of the admin
istration will have to guard against
most carefully. People find it difficult
to believe that men who so recently
were openly and notoriously in opposi
tion to the Roosevelt policy are now
about to undergo a sincere change of
heart.
Alive to Situation.
The friends of the administration in
both houses are alive to the situation,
and of course there will be nothing
of this kind if it can be prevented.
In the meantime, things are still look
ing bright for the advocates of genuine
rate legislation, and their talk is su
premely optimistic. Obviously, there is
likely to be a slight reaction, and in a
week from now things may not look
as good as they do today. But "suf
ficient unto the day" is the evil, or
the good, thereof.
Every move thus far has strengthened
the president and worked to the undo
ing of his opponents, and this state of
affairs cannot long continue without
making^ genuine legislation certain.
The introduction of the much-talked
of Esch-Townsend* bill yesterday caused
a flutter of excitement, everybody be
ing anxious to see "just what its pro
visions were. It is apparent how
ever, that Esh and Townsend will not
occupy in this congress the favored po
sition they occupi^rl in the last. Then
they were practically the only friends
the president had, and in a session
which he expressely said was to be a
session of talk, they achieved a good
deal of fame.
Session of Action.
The present session is to be a session
of action, according to the president's
belief, and at its beginning he finds a
number of the leading men in both
houses anxious to stand, on the ground
which he stands on. As between all
these friends, he of course could not
afford to select one or two as admin
istration champions, discarding all
others. Therefore, there will be no ad
ministration bill this session, plainlv
tagged as sueh, as was the case with
the Esch-Townsend bill of a vear ago.
The house committee on interstate
and foreign commerce will itself pick
out a bill that will be reported to the
house, and that bill will be the admin
istration bill. The Esch-Townsend bill
will probablv not find favor in that
committee, but some other bill will
probably be_ reported for passage bv
the house, either the bill drawn by the
interstate commerce commission, at the
Teouest of Senator Elkins, or some
bill drawn along similar lines, perhaps
the bill whieh Chairman Hepburn of
that committpe is now writing.
The argument in favor of some such
a bill as this, which will re-enact the
major portion of the present interstate
commerce act,
witho
onlv such
as are necessar convo thadditions princi
ple which the president is fighting for,
was outlined in these dispatches last
Sunday morning in an interview with
Bepresentative Steenerson of Minne
sota.
Waiting on Speaker,
As soon as Speaker Cannon an
nounces the committee on interstate
and foreign commerce for this congress,
that committee will meet and take ^t*
the rate question, with a view to re
porting a bill at as earlv a date as pos
sible. Mr. Hepburn will continue to
be chairman of that committee, and
Mr. Stevens of Minnesota will be a
member of it, as he was" in the last
congress. There is good ground for
the statement that Mr. Fletcher of Min
nesota will not be able to regain a
place on this committee. The speaker
would give him a place on the nulitarv
committee, provided Mi. Stevens would
retire from that committee, but this
Mr. Stevens is disinclined to do, owiner
to the fact that the committee will
have before it this session several im
portant questions left over from the
last congress, with which Mr. Stevens
is familiar, and for the discussion of
which his presence on the committee
is highly important.

Woman Takes Vengeance on Russ
General, the Scourge of
Peasants.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 6, Wednesday
Night, via E\dtkuhnen, East Prussia,
Dec. 7.Public confidence in the gov
ernment's ability to weather the grow
ing storm is waning fasff. Premier
Witte seems powerless to cope with the
new elements of danger which the revo
lution is raising on every hand. New
mutinies among the troops are con
stantly reported, and the lawlessness
in the country is increasing.
Sakharoff Is Slain.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 5, via Eydt
kuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 6.Lieu-
tenant General Sakharoff, former min
ister of war, was assassinated today.
The government had deputed Gen
eral Sakharoff to visit the province of
Saratoff for the purpose uf quelling
the agrarian riots there.
A woman belonging to the so-called
"flying columns" of the revolutionary
movement called at the house of the
governor of Saratoff at noon and asked
to see General Sakharoff.
She fired three revolver shots at the
geneial, killing him on the spot.
The tidings reached St. Petersburg
tonight. Count Wjtte charged Lieu
tenant General Rudiger, minister of
war, with the task of breaking tho
news to Madame Sakharoff.
The event has created i profound
impression in St. Petersburg, owing to
fears that the 1 e\ olutioni3ts here will
follow the example thus pet.
Horrible Cruelties.
The news of the assassination was
preceded by the most horrible stories
of the manner in which Sakharoff had
been repressing the agraiian disorders.
He corralled peasants with Cossacks
and then had them beaten with the
soldiers' whips. In so doing Sakharoff
pursued the system adopted by Prince
John Obolensky, former governor gen
eral of Finland, in suppressing the
agrarians in the vicinity of Kharkoff
several years ago, when the prince
caused the peasants to be whipped by
relays of Cossacks and compelled them
in turn to beat their comrades.
The assassin of Sakharoff has not
been identified. When arrested the
woman who committed the crime de
clared that she had executed a decree
of the terrorists' section of the social
revolutionists.
How Sakharoff Came.
4^1
The following /is a description of
Sakharoff:'s arrival at Hovoanschina,
one of the villages of the province of
Saratoff:
"He came with Cossacks and artil
lery. The peasants were surrounded
by Cossacks and Sakharoff addressed.
them, demanding that they surrender
thpir leaders. The village elder replied
but gave the general no information.
The elder was immediately beaten until
he lost consciousness.
"Sakharoff then retired to the court
house, leaving the peasants at the mer
cies of the Cossacks, most of whom were
diunk, and they began torturi'itfg the
peasants, pulling out their hair and
beards, and even tearing pieces of flesh
from their faces. Thirty-three peas
ants weie thus maltreated."
Mutiny at Odessa.
It is rumored that the military engi
neers at Odessa are mutinously inclined.
Prices on the bourse today were very
weak. The offers, however, were o" a

Revolt in Capital.
London, Dec. 7.The correspondent
of the Times at St. Petersburg says:
I am informed on excellent author
ity that a revolt of the St. Petersburg
garrison is ceitam to occur."
The Daily Telegraph correspondent
says:
The specter of a military dictator
ship which has been looming on the hor
izon is slowly gaimug consistency and
sharpness of outline.
I am personally convinced that
Count Witte's faith in the good sense
and political tact of the Russian think
ing classes, which recently was as firm
as a rock, is gradually weakening, and
with it his hopes tor the carrying out of
the liberties promised in the emperor's
manifesto.
"There are signs of a collapse of the
post and telegraph strike. Two thirds
of the telegraph operators are daily of
fering to resume work but they are pre
\ented from so doing because the wires
have been cut or the stations fail to
answer signals.
Father Gapon has gone to Paris un

Poles in League of Leagues.
Warsaw. Russian Poland, Dec. 7.
Thirteen unions of civil engineers, law

have foimed a Polish league of leagues
as an annex of the Russian League of

The local police have petitioned the
chief of police for better pay, housing
and treatment. They require a favor
able answer during the week, otherwise
they threaten to strike. Advices from

that many merchants of these cities
are finding it impossible to transact
business ard are sacrificing their intei

Moscow, Wednesday, Dec. 6, via
Eydtkuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 7.The
elaborate measures taken by the police
and militaiy for the protection of men
who are willing to return to work have
failed to induce any of the striking
telegraphers to *resume their employ
ment. A meeting of 2,000 strikers to
day unanimously pronounced against
yielding. The Finnish delegates de
clared that all the telegraphers of Fin
land were ready to enter the union and
support the strike. Three hundred

under the decree of Interior Minister
Durnovo.

WILL OPEN ROAD
TO RECIPROCITY
Congress Likely to Pass Minimum
and Maximum Tariff Law
This Session.
Journal Bpeoial Service.
Washington, Dec. 7.Reciprocity by
means of a maximum and minimum tar
iff, on the basis of the suggestion made
in the president's message, is likely to
be the most notable piece of legisla
tion by the fifty-ninth congress, not
even excepting the railway-rate law,
which is expected to be on the statute
books before the end of this session.
President Roosevelt did not expatiate
on the desirability of the maximum and
minimum tariff in his message, because,
it is said, he had received assurances
from the leaders of both houses that
they favored the idea. Our foreign
relations are involved to such an extent
that it was not deemed wise to call
general attention to this subject thru
the medium of an extended discussion
in his word to congress.
Yet Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
the acknowledged spokesman of the ad
ministration, introduced a maximum
and minimum tariff bill in the senate.
At the same time, it is said, his col
leagues almost suiely will adopt a sim
ilar bill and urge its passage.
There is a vast significance in these
two statements, for if such a, bill is
passed, direct reciprocity with^any na
tion will be immediately possible, and
the great American commonwealth will
have in its' hands alreadv fashioned a
club with which to beat down the com
mercial hostility of Germany and other
nations.

Nineteen Persons Injured
Wreck of Overland Train

Omaha, Dec. 7.Nine persons were
killecl and eleven employees and eight
passengers were injured in a wreck of 'Z
Overland Limited passenger train No.
2 on the Union Pacific, five miles west
of Rock Springs, Wyo.f early today,
The limited was run into, head on, by a'
freight train and both engines were
demolished and the dynamo car, mail
car and dining car on the limited were
burned. Several of the1
bodies of the
dead were incinerated.
The dead were all train employees,
who lived in the west. The injuries to
the passengers were slight.
Orders Disobeyed.
An order was given an extra freight
train before it left Bock Springs to
meet four east-bound passenger trains,
of which the Overland Limited was the
last ore, at Ahsay, a siding five miles
west of Eock Springs. The freight took
the siding at Ahsay and waited until
three of the trains had passed east and
then pulled out. When a mile and a half
west of Ahsay the freight met the
Overland Limited and crashed into 't,
head on. oBth engines were demolished
and the three first cars of the Overland
Limited immediately caught fire and
were entirely destroyed.
Dead Man Is Blamed.
Engineer Brink of the freight train,
who, it is stated officially* was respon
sible for overrunning his orders, was
one of the killed. Several trains had
been badly delayed at Granger with the
result that the four passenger trains
were running close to each other. The
freight had received positive orders to
meet all four of these trains at Ahsay,
and the officials say that the orders
were either misunderstood or misread.
Relief trains with wrecking cars and a
large number of physicians were imme
diately dispatched from Rock Springs
and Granger.

DEAD COMPANY
PAYS DIVIDEND
Northern Securities Pays 5 Per
Cent on Its Undistributed
Assets.
The Northern Securities company to
day declared a dividend of 5 per cent
on its stubs.'' This is the first divi
dend since Feb. 2, 1904, when' 1% per
cent was declared.
As the result of the decision of the
United States supreme court declaring
the company illegal, the stockholders, on
April 21,1904, voted to reduce the capi
ital stock from $395,400,000 to $3,954,-
000, and each stockholder received, in
addition to his pro rata portion of Great
Northern and Northern Pacific stock, a
stub'' equal to 1 per cent of his orig
inal Northern' Securities holdings. These
stubs stood for cash remaining in the
treasury and other unknown assets that
could not be otherwise figured in "nor re
stored to the component companies.
Just what this amounts to no one
knows, except insiders, but besides cash
it is supposed to represent interests in
ore lands that are valuable. The North
ern Securities was, in fact, too huge a
combination to make it possible to wind
it up closely, and while it is legally non
existent, it will always have such legal
and financial recognition as it may re
quire while its affairs of liquidation are
stiH unsettled. 1
The little "stubs" will one day get
the last dollar left. They are selling
today for about $312 each.

NORTHWEST PASSAGE
FOUND BY AMUNDSEN
TRUE MAGNETIC
POLE IS LOCATED
Norwegian Is First Explorer in
History to Complete North

Special to The Journal,
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 7.Captain
Amundsen, commander of the Norwe
gian arctic exploration expedition, has
arrived, at Engle City, Alaska, after
having completed the Northwest pas
sage, the first explorer .j^aTlnstory to
have done so.
The only details of his expedition are
those contained in the following mes
sage, which he sent to Dr. Fridtiof
Nansen, the arctic explorer at Chris

"Roland Amundsen."
Left Norway in 1903.
Captain Amundsen left Norway at
midnight of June 1, 1903. and his first
stop was at God Haven, Greenland, for
dogs. The first base station was estab
lished in the vicinity of North Somer
set, in Leopold Harbor, 'where he made
absolute magnetic observations and op
erated his self-registering instruments
for a time. This was in 1904. From
the base station Amundsen made sledge
trips for magnetic observations.
Carrying out his plans to a nicety,
Captain Amundsen located his base sta
tion on King William's island in the
summer of this year and set up his self
registering instruments. He also lo
cated the true magnetic pole 'on King
William's island, and is 'believed to
have found the monument erected by
Sir John Franklin's expedition.
His Return Trip.
His return trip will be made by the
way of Bering strait, and he proposes
to stop at Sitka and make his final, ob
servations there at the United States
coast and geodetic survey magnetic ob
servatory for the determination of in
strumental constants.
Captain Amundsen is without money
and today a Seattle newspaper cabled
him $100 to supply his immediate needs.
Importance of Work.
The importance of Amundsen's work
may be judged from the fact that Co
lumbus found in 1492 that the needle
of the compass in one part of the At
lantic pointed to the west of north and
in another part of the Atlantic to the
east of north. This variation has been
noted in every compass for more than
four hundred years, and yet science
has never discovered why. If Amund
sen# has located exactly the north mag
netic pole, the variation in the compass
may be computed from a fixed basis and
the work of navigation and surveying
be greatly simplified.
Norway Congratulates.
Christiania. Dec. 7.The Norwegian
government is cabling its felicitations
to Captain Roland Amundson, the Nor
wegian explorer who has arrived at Fort
Egbert, Alaska, after making his way
thru the northwest passage and who
found the true magnetic pole on Kingline
William island. Dr. Fridjof Nansen
believes that the expedition1
a great success.
1%
has proved
Fort Egbert, from which Captain
Amundson telegraphs, is located at
Eagle City, 110 miles down the Yukon
river, almost due northeast of Dawson.
Eagle City is near the boundary line on
the Alaska side and Fort Egbert is a
small military post accommodating one
company of soldiers. Here is estab
lished the most "n'ortheriy station of the
signal service. It lies almost directly
under the sixtv-fifth degree of north lat
itude. Herschel island, from 'which
Captain Amundson made his overland
journey south to Fort Egbert, lies across
the continent ion almost a straight line
drawn from the North Cape of Norway,
north of Greenland, to the terminus or
the boundaiy between Alaska and Brit
ish America in the Arctic ocean. This
is new honor for the Norwegian explor
ers and the story of this perilous voyage
will certainly rival in interest the tale
which Nansen has told us in his "Farth
est North."

Crowd in City's History, f,
GETS POINTERS PROM
OFFICIALS AT DENVER
Gathering Is Declared of Greatest
Value as Advertisement for 3f!
City and State.
Secretary Wallace G. Nye of the put*
lie affairs committee of the Commercial
club returned today after a short trio
to Denver, where he went to study the
system employed in caring for the G.
A. R. encampment there last summer.
It was thought wise to confer with the
Denver officials that the benefit of their
experience might be secured, and the
trip was most profitable. Mr. Nye re
turns full of enthusiasm and urges the*
workers to get busy at once, that
everything may be ready when tne tim
comes. In speaking of the prospects I
and of his trip Mr. Nye said today:
"The people of Minneapolis should at
once understand that if arrangements.
are completed for holding the Grand
Army encampme'nt here next July, the*
city will have far more visitors at that
time than ever before in its history.
Only a small part of those who come
will be members of the G. A. B. The
rate of one cent a mile will prove an
attraction to thousands who will take
advantage of it to visit the northwest.
Minneapolis-Denver Club.
"Denver people have already organ
ized a Minneapolis-Denver club. 'I
now numbers 200 and will be largely in
creased. Monthly contributions are be- Ji
ing made by the club members on a' jf
basis which will create a fund to meet
all expenses of the trip. Cook's famous 2*
drum corps of eighty pieces will ac-'
company the club to Minneapolis and
will prove, as it always has, a great at
traction. No doubt the club plan will^
be adopted in many cities.
During the two days put in at Den-,
ver, I gathered information which will
prove of great value to our local or-
S[r.
anizations. Both General Cook and
Martin, chairman and secretary of
the Denver committee, were prompt to
tell me of their mistakes as well as
their successes, and this I appreciated
most highly, for it will enable us to
save a great deal of money which
otherwise we might have wasted in ex
perimenting. In addition to securing
information from the executive offifcers|v
of the committee, I talked with mer
chants bankers, hotel meri and otfc?**^
regarding the value of the
encampment
to the city.
Of Greatest Va*u. 'f^f*^
"Without exception, tnev proclaimed
the gathering of greatest value as an
advertisement for the city and state^
and stated emphatically* that thfe di
rect return in mdriey to the city wasf
not less than forty times the amount
expended in caring for it. The beat'
evidence that they believed this is
found in the fact that when" the com
mittee at the close of the encarapmesit
announced a shortage of about $10,000',
the amount was contributed within two
days. One mercantile firm. Which had
rather grudgingly given $500 at the
start, sent in an equal amount as soon
as it heard of the deficit, and the rec
ords disclose a number of instances
almost equally striking.
The bank clearings for the encamp
ment week showed an increase of
$2,500,000, without other Teason than
the presence of the visitors, and the
cashier of one of the banks told me
that at the close of the encampment
$1,500,000 in currency was shipped east.
At Denver and Colorado Springs, 98,000
tickets were validated for return" pas
sage, and at the end of the time limit
on tickets, 12,000 were uncalled for,
showing that that number of people
remained in Colorado or beyond.
Pleasure Resort Crowded.
"During the week, and, in fact thru
out the month that tickets were ood
for return passage, the resorts about
Denver had all they could ha"tfdleV The
Short Lines, a scenic railway from Col
orado Springs to Cripple Cieek, carried
50,000 passengers during the week at
$2.50 for the round trip, while the Loop
and the Moffatt road were taxed to
the extent of their equipment, altho
round-trip rates were $2 and $3 respect
ively. One day over 4,000 peoplepaid
50 cents each as toll into the Oney
enne canyon, many of them walking
thru the great gorge because all the bur
ros and carriages were inService.
These facts serve to show that those
who attended the encampment brought
money with them and left chunks of it
in and about Denver. I have nV) hesi
tation in saying that if the encampment
is held here next July, the attendance
will exceed 150,000 people, and it will be
up to us to provide for that number.
Denver planned for 75,000 and some a
noyance and inconvenience resulted
when their estimate was exceeded.
Must Be No Deficit.
"We must not make that mistake,
and we do not propose under any cir
cumstances to face a deficit. The
amount which the local organization
will need should be promptly subscribed"
and expenditures must be held within
that amount.
"The organization at Denver was
specially created about five months be
fore the encampment, and as a result
many things were done hurriedly and
at greater cost than they would have
entailed if time had permitted more
deliberate action. We have here, with
the Commercial club as the main or
ganization, a distinct advantage, and
we will be able to handle the affair
much more economically than it 'was
handled at Denver.
If the people of Denver placed $60,-
600 at the disposal of their committee,
and as has been stated, this amount was
exceeded $10,000. Much of this fund,
which was certainly large for a city
with only a little over one-half the
population of Minneapolis, came volun
tarily, notwithstanding the Epwortn
league and Eagles' conventions had en
tailed large expenditures earlier in th
summer.
Inspired by Sentiment.
A good many contribution were'in
spired by sentiment. One citizen who
could not have profited 1 cent thru the
convention, cabled a subscription of
$500 from Europe, while many ^otber
citizens sent in contributions without
solicitation. But enough did not come
that way, and the committee was
obliged to hire solicitors, thus expend
ing a goodly portion of the fund in
raising it. This must not be repeated
here. When our finance committee an
nounces its readiness to receive sub-
