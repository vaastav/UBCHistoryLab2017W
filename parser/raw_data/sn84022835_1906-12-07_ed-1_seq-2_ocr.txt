AFFIDAVIT IS REPUDIATED
Witness Declares He Never
Read
Paper Before Signing.
Omaha, Doc. 4. "I wish to explain
this allldavit by saying that I did not
take up the land In good faith, that
is, with the Intention of living on It."
This statement was mudu on re-direct
examination in the federal court
by William H. Campbell of Missouri
Valley, a witness in the big land trial.
Attorneys for the defense had submit
ted in evidence an affidavit signed by
the same Mr. Campbell, In which the
witness declared ho did enter the land
In good faith and with tho Intention
of living on it.
This allldavit was written with a
typewriter and on this point Mr.
Campbell said:
"The affidavit was presented to mo
already typewritten. I did not rend I
It before signing it. The paper was
brought to mo by a young man at
Missouri Valley. I do not know his
name."
The defense has entered moro vig
orously upon the general attempt of
discrediting the testimony of v.'lt
nesscs tor tho government and this
was one move in this general plan.

ness told practically the samo story
that has been repeated by all tho sol
diers who had been solicited to file
on tho lands by tho Hulls at the Iowa
end of the land and Huntington, Hoyt
and Comstock at tho Gordon end of
the lino. Tho same general procedure
of making a visit to the lands, ex
pense free, and nil filing fees paid
for by Huntington or Hoyt, were gone
over in detail.
INSURANCE POLICIES CANCELLED
Slight Chances of Convicting Tobacco
Trust Busters Who Used Torch.
Princeton, K, Dec. 4. All Insurance
policies covering buildings owned or
controlled by the tobacco trust in
western Kentucky wero cancelled as
a result of the burning of two stem
merles by a mob which entered Prince
ton last Friday night. The excitement
caused by the mob's action is still In
tense, interest being heightened by tho
Inquiry begun by Flro Marshal Ayres.
Several witnesses wero oxamlned,
among them being prominent citizens.
All had encountered members of tho
mob, but with one exception they tes
tified that they failed to recognize any
of tho raiders. The fact that ono wit
ness who had previously declared he
recognized members of the mob, tes
tified to the contrary, is taken as an
Indication that tho chances of secur
ing convictions nro slight.
