The adjourned session of the 51st Con
gress convened Monday. The members
have only bad sixty days of Tacatlon since
Dec. 1st 18.S9, but a majority of the mem
bers of both Houses were on band ready
for business.
Tbe proprietors of a number of tbe
leading cloak factories In Cleveland have
decided to remove tbeir plants to New
York. Cleveland is now rated the third
city in tbe Union In that line ol tiade,
but such a slate of afluirs will soon lower
her rating.
We have not at all times agreed with
Senator Ingalla, but we have no hesitation
In saying that it would be a national ca
lamity for the legislatuie ol Kansas to
allow a man of his wide experience and
brainy ability to be retired to private life.

Tni census enumerators are just receiv
ing tbeir pay for services rendered tbe
United States In June last. Some of tbe
enumerators supposed that they would re
ceive their pay just as soon as their re
turns reached Wasblngton.but they bad to
wait a little while this time. It will be a
good thing for hundreds of them, as they
will now have little money to keep
their lamillcs through tbe winter with,
otherwise it would have been disbursed
long ago an tt probably amount to notb.

Tub President's message appears in the
supplement of this psrw-r. It is a busi
ness document In every respect During
times of peace it is not expected that
any great issue will come to t!e sur
face to attract the atention ol a nation and
all that can be said by an executive Is to
rehearse the business matters in a con
densed lorm and refer the people lo the
annual reports of tbe beads of tbe depart
ments under him for an examination.
During the civil war a message from the
President was read with interest by every
loyal citizen, as all were anxious to know
what tbe condition of affairs were at the
front
Kei'reaentative M ills Is not only a
candidate for Speaker of the next Ilouse,
but be is also a candidate for tbe United
States Senate; and his method of making
the latter fact known was somewhat
unique. In a newspaper Interview be
stated that be had decided to retire from
public life with tbe close of tbe Fifty-sec
ond Congress, unless tbe legislature of
Texas should decide lo elect him to the
Untied States Senate. If that Is not an
original way of announcing one's candi
dacy we have never read one. Dut Mr,
Mills is a unique sort of a fellow anyway,
For Instance, he is asking to be elected
Speaker of a Democratic House of Repre
sentatives because he la a free trader,
while the other candidates, although
without exception they are free traders at
heart, are straddling tbe qui stion In order
to catch votes.
Waftliinjrton Letter.
From onr Regular Correspondent. J
Washington, D. C, Nov. 28, '00,
The President having- finished his
annual message to Congress is now devot
ing the greater part of his time to confer
ring with prominent republicans on tbe
legislation ol tbe session of Congress that
will open next Monday. Speaker Reed,
. Representatives McElnley and Cannon,
the republican members of tbe Ilouse
committee oo Rules, which has direct
charge of the business to come before the
House, are all here, and have taken con
splcuous yart In these conferences. They
think with tbe President that every re
publican Representative should be in his
eat next Monday and should remain here
until tbe end of tbe session in order that
the large amount of business mapped out
to be transacted shall not be obstructed
through lack of a quorum of republi
cans. So plain ia this duty tbat no special
methods have been thought necessary by
the party leaden to Impress It upon tbe
minds of tbe individual republican Rep
resentatives. Tbe republicans already here are loath
to believe that any member of the party
can to far forget his duty both to his
party and his constituents as to remain
away except in case of absolute necessity
during any part of what Is to be one of the
most important short sessions of Congress
ever held, and If any of them should
prove derelict they will never be forgiven
for it, and they shouldn't be, either.
If Mr. McKirley Is a trustwoitby
prophet, and I am inclined to think he is,
tbe lollowing In his own words, covers the
republican programme: "We will pass
the appropriation bills, the apportionment
bill, the circuit court bill, which relieves
tbe Supreme Court, and wbich has come
back to tbe House where It originated
after being amended by the Senate, and
a shipping bill. I have no information as
to what tbe Senate will do with the elec
tion bill, but I assume It will pass It. I
do not believe any general pension bills
will be passed, but the Union prisoners of
war bill, which is meritorious, and one or
two other measures for the benefit ol de
serving classes of pensioners may become
laws."
Senator Edmunds, who never speaks
lightly on any subject says the Senate
will pnss tbe Federal Election bill.
It is hardly probable that any silvci
legislation can be secured this wlntei,
notwithstanding the large number of in
fluential republicans that stand ready to
support a tree coinage bill If tbe oppor
tunity should present Itself. The majority
of the party leaders are of the opinion
that the silver law enacted at tbe last
session has not been sufficiently tned to
enable even thobe opposed to it to say that
it has not, or will not accomplish Its pur
pose. The silver men have not, however,
given up hopes ol securing free coinage.
Mr. Harrison yesterday enjoyed a quiet
family Thanksgiving dinner at tbe White
House, and to-night for the first time the
newly decorated Blue Room is to be
tbrownopen and a reception wbich will
Inaugurate the official social season, given
to the Brazilian Naval officers, who have
come to present this Government with a
magnificent gold medal lor Its early action
in recognizing the Brazilian republic.

Tbe court of common pleas waa called
again on Monday afternoon last week and
commenced to dispose of tbe criminal
docket. The first case to be tried was tbe
8tate of Ubio vs Bonsor Jacobs, charred
with murder In the second degree, by tbe
shooting of Clinton Hutchinson, from
which Hutchinson died a lew days after
wards. Tbe case was thoroughly tried
upon tbe part of tbe State, and tbe de
fendant was ably deiended. The trial oc
cupled some four days, and the Jury found
the defendant guilty of manslaughter-
Tbe court sentenced the defendant upon
the verdict to two years in the Ohio peni
tentiary at bard labor, but no solitary con
finement. It is thought that the sentence
ol two years lor maliciously shooting and
mortally wounding a man is a mild sen
tence. The criminal docket contains about
seventy cases. Those disposed ol lor tbe
term are as follows :

plea guilty; sentence a fine' of $10 and
costs.
