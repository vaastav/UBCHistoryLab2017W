A SARCASTIC MICHIGAN JUDGE.
"Serious as is your off ense, you need
not look upon the dark side of your
future because of the length of this
sentence. There is no prison in Mich
igan that will long hold an embezzling
banker who has wealthy and influen
tial friends."
With this statement Judge Smith of
the Circuit Court at Fontiac, Mich.,
startled the crowd that packed his
court room as he pronounced sentence
upon Ralph E. Joesman, defaulting
cashier of the Jossman State Bank at
Clarkston. Jossman pleaded guilty
to the embezzlement of $50,000 to
$200,000 of the bank's funds.
"There is no reason for you to de
spair." Judge Smith informed the
prisoner, in a voice bristling with sar
casm. "Three releases of statewide
notoriety within a few years prove
this. If a banker in a neighboring
village can wreck two banks, cripple a
third, embezzle the funds of his vil
lage as treasurer, add forgery to his
offense and then obtain an early re
lease as a Christmas present, -you
have nothing to fear."
The court evidently referred to the
pardoning of Mark Lee Hagle, late of
Oxford, Mich., convicted and sen
tenced for embezzlement.
"The fashionable and sugar-coated
name for your offense is that of bor
rowing the funds of your bank,"
Judge Smith continued. "The common
name for it is embezzlement, and
some of the depositors term it plain
stealing." (Kansas City Times.
THE REAL JORE LEFT OUT.
A majority of the London papers
give a curious and perhaps significant
misreport of the amusing personal ex
perience related by Ambassador Page
at the American Society's Thanksgiv
ing dinner. He described picturesque
ly how as he was sitting in a lovelv I
Engtlsh garden with an eminent Eng
lish peer exchanging genial after-
lunch confidences he came to ask the
peer, "What could America best learn
from England?"
The peer, hoping Mr. .Page would
not be offended, answered, "Modesty.
The" Thanksgiving company laughed
heartily, and there the London news
paper report of the anecdotes ended.
The real point was that the Ambassa
dor, when the laughter had ceased,
created a further outburst by saying,
"I see you see the humor of that re
mark coming from an Englishman." -

That the old saying concerning the
"keeping of the pig in the parlor" may'
have been founded on -fact Is not
doubted by Inspector James C, Grace
of the Department of Health follow
ing an experience on Gilmar street
the -past week. Neither does he doubt
birt that the criticism concerning the
i affection of some women for pets re
gardless of their children is Justified.
While poking about the corners and
crannies of the back yard he was sur
prised to see a pair of horns appear
in a rear window of the house follow
ed by a bearded wise-appearing face
of a goat Then came a salutation in
voice more noted for quantity than
quality.
Investigating he found that Mrs.
Goat and a family of kiddies were
being kept in the kitchen in which a
number of children were playing. The
woman explained . that the procedure
had been followed for some -time, that
the Children seemed to like it and,
anyway, the barn was too cold for the
kiddies. She thought nothing, appar
ently, as to whether it was good to
have the kiddies and Mrs-. Goat in the
same rooms with the children,' In
spector Grace informed her that the
procedure could not meet with the ap
proval of his department and that the
barn was good enough. Sorrowfully,
the woman complied.

A quick exit was made into the hall

then the new Water ous engine passed
in a test run up Coiirtland street hill

At the PbHce and Charities building
they ' are still "kidding" Chauffeur
Aubrey E. Burlison of the emergency
hospital ambulance concerning his ac
quaintance with Charities Commis
sioner J. MacLaren Richardson. It
was Monday afternoon. Just after
various appointments had been an
nounced, that "Commissioner Richard
son attended a meeting of the Chari
ties board. He received congratula
tions concerning his re-appointment.
Chauffeur Burlison was among those
shaking his hands and amazed the
other by predicting that the city's
legal work would now be well taken
care of. The others thought It was
pleasantry on Burlison' s -part until he
explained afterwards that Judge Wll
Ham H. Comley, newly appointed city
attorney," was some genial fellow. It
took some time to convince him that
he had mistaken his man.
Since then attention' has been di
verted from the time that Dr. J. H.

as if I know you but I can't place
you.' "You ought to, seeing that you

Then there was realization as to who
was making the request.
A good story is being told on a
Bridgeporter, who sometimes meand
ers about New Haven doing profes
sional duty. He has a friend, a New
Haven scribe, who has a telephone
operator as a friend. A few evenings
ago the New Haven writer decided
that It was a good night for a social
visit so called urp "Central." There
was no hitch excepting that his friend
would have a friend with her, an
other telephone operator, and felt that
three would be a crowd. No matter.
decided the New Haven scribe, and
told her that he had a - friend the
Bridge porter who would be glad to
come along. They waited outside of
the exchange until the two "Centrals'
appeared and approached. It was not
until the introductions came that the
Brldgeporter found that he was being
introduced to his own sister. He has
been trying to quiet the story every
day since.

BRIDGEPORT GETS
FIRST" TASTE OF
ARGENTINE BEEF
Carload of South American
Cattle Is Shipped Local
Packing Houses.
mportations Are So Small In
Comparison to Total Con
sumption That No Ef
fect On Market Is Ex
pected. '
The first shipment, of Argentine, beef
to reach Bridgeport, since the tariff
bill removed the impost on "beef from
South America, is expected to arrive
at the meat house of John- S. Wood-
hull, Water street, late today . or . to
morrow. A refrigerator car filled
with beef, thirty carcasses of steers
that not long since roved the plains
of Argentine, will be available for
the Bridgeport market with the arrival
of this shipment. .
John S. Woodhull said the market
prices of beef would not be affected
by the shipments of the Argentine
beef into this country, in his opin
ion, for the amount shipped from
South America, into this country , is
comparatively so little that it will
have ho perceptible effect on the. sup
ply: The shipment is : interesting.
however, for it marks the first time
that the Bridgeport butchers have had
an ; opportunity- to inspect the South !
American cattle. ; '
Mr. Woodhull said the beef In ap
pearance Is much like the native grown
Connecticut stock, which, of late years
is very little known . in . the eastern
market. As to the quality of the
meat, he was doubtful whether It was
any better than the western stock.
The meat looks like the Conec-
ticut grown . cattle," said Mr. Wood
hull "The fat is whiter than the
western stock. But I don't know that
it is any better than the western
grown product."
Dispatches from New York 'announc
ed the arrival Monday of the refriger
ator ship Zimal with 13,000 quarters
of beef . aboard. Thla is consumed
practically in, its entirety in New
York city, but one refrigerator car load
is shipped to the local packing
house... ;
New York packers say the Argen
tine shipments may have been some
what effective in preventing the up
ward - trend of beef prices, - but they
predicted, today, that :the Mexican
situation may result in an advance.
for the shipments of Mexican beef
have fallen off greatly. They say the
Argentine, beef is not high grade, be
