A Short Term of four
I.
Very little business was done at
Monday's term of court. Judge Win
Chester opened the court at two
o'clock p. m. and within three hours
the calendar was gone through and an
adjournment taken to the next regu
lar term. The jurymen were allowed
one day's pay and mileage for their
presence at the opening, as required
by law. In one instance, however, a
juryman drawn—L. Eager—was not
present, and the court ordered that a
bench warrant be served on said jury
man for his appearance at the next
regular term of court to show cause
if any for his non-appearance at this
term.
Our county commissioners have
been diligently trying for some time
to get all old delinquent tax matters
settled, and in the few cases which
were not closed up citations were is
sued and the matter came regularly
into court. Iu some instances parties
appeared and made a settlement or
had their case continued until the
next term of court and in all cases
where there was no appearance or
svtilenient, judgment. ineluilim i.t\

T111: county valuation and levy
figures, given in the PKF.SS last
week, were of interest to even
resident in Stark county. We are
indebted to Auditor Auld for the
same.
THE editor of the Kdgely Sen
tinel raises a question on the
legality of the late election, and
savs:
By what law, or what authority, The publishers advise us that they
is the vote given to One man nil- will send free sample copies to all of
der two positions, as was the case our readers, who are not already sub

ty are these two seperate totals
consolidated added together?
Suppose, for instance the totals
stand this way:
Burke, Republican, 150
Shorlridge, Democrat U5
Shortridge, Independent. 100
AT last the official returns are
all in -have been tabulated and
the footings appear in another
column. One fusion and two re
publican electors are successful.
Rondesvedt, who declared he'd
vote for Cleveland anyhow, if
elected as an independent, run
about 175 ahead of his ticket, and
has 164 majority over the highest
republican elector. Wamberg,
republican, has 25 majority over
Burnett, fusionist, and Clark, re
publican, has but three majority
over Williams, fusionist, Yeager,
republican, run about 40 behind
his ticket. Johnson, republican,
for congress has 6,674 plurality
over O'Brien, democrat, and lacks
only 760 of having as many votes
as both O'Brien and Foss, inde
pendent, combined. Dahl, repub
lican, for secretary of state has
723 majority over Pcabody, fusion

A Cold n.iy.
We do have some cold days in the
Northwest in winter. ut the ones we
have iu mind would make the worst,
blizzard til l! ever ldcw seem like a
tropical sum 111 by comparison.
Some few hundred 1 lions.tn or mil
lion years ago the whole of Ihitish
America and a large part of the I'nit
ed States were buried under a sea of
ice hundreds of feet thick. The bor
der line of his glacier si retched north
westerle from the coa.-t of New Jer
sey through l'eiiiisj Ivania to Ohio,
thence southwesterly through Indiir
11a to a line drawn cas* and west
across liiinoi about lil'ty miles south
of St. Louis. From thence the line
bore away northwesterly into the Mi
souri Valley. We know the limit by
the granite boulders that were home
along in the progress of the glacier,
and are not found south of the line
described. There was a long succes
sion of cold days then, lint as the
Northwest was not. inhabited there
was no tourist, travel to Ihe resorts of
the South. Things have changed.
People buy ice now—and in Southern
cities they make it. It is a desirable
thing. Cold days now make people
think of traveling South and in select
ii railro id remember that the P.iirling
ton Route has its own lines to Chica
go and St. Louis, offers choice of
routes, ami 111 ikes low rates. Apply

The Cause of ifhi'iimalisin.
An aci'l which exists in sour milk
and cider, called lactic acid.is believed
by physicians to be the cause of rheu
matism. Accumulating in the blood,
it attacks the librous tissues in the
joints, and causes agonizing pains.
What is needed is a remedy to neu
tralize the acid, and to so invigorate
the kidneys and liver that all waste
will be carried off. Hood's Sarsapa
rilla is heartily recommended by
many whom it has cured of rheuma
tism. It possesses just the desired
qualities, and so thoroughly purifies
the blood as to prevent occurrence of
rheumatic attacks. We suggest a
trial of Iloods Sarsaparilla by all who
suiter from rheumatism.

Clip the last thirty years or more from the cen

the unbounded popularity of Jlostetter's Stomach
1 itters. The openingof the year 189tt will be sig
nalized by the appearance of a fresh Almanac of
the UitterK, in which the uses, derivation and ac
tion of this worldfamous medicine will be lucidly
set forth. Everybody should read it. The calen
dar and astronomical calculations to be found in
thin brochuer are always astonishingly accurate,
and the statistics, illustrations, humor and other
reading matter rich in interest and full of protlt.
