MORRISVILLE AND HYDE PARK.
L. H. LEWIS, EDITOR
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1905.
Gov. Bell is spending a few days
in Chicago and Lieut.-Gov.Stearnsis
acting as Governor. What if Charlie
should grant Mrs. Rogers a reprieve?
We give elewhere a synopsis of
President Roosevelt's message read
in Congress yesterday. The message
in its entirety is a long one, but in
the condensed form we give it makes
pretty good reading. Our readers
will no doubt appreciate this oppor
tunity of getting the gist of the
message.
The Free Press savs that because
Gov. Bell endorsed W. W. Miles for a
judgeship when McCullough was
Governor, was reason enough forap-
nointinc him at this time. H that is
so, why did the Governor set a day
for hearing the friends of the various
other candidates? With the ap
pointments of Miles "up his sleeve''
it would seem that this latter
movement was hardly necessary.
In its issue of December 1st the
Enosburg Standard imparts the
news that Gov. Bell " was a guest of
honor at the christening of the new
battleship Vermont at Quincy, Mass.,
on Aug. 31st." Three months after
the event happened is hardly in keep
ing with these days of telephones,
wireless telegraphv, etc., as well as
the Standard's usual" promptness in
publishing the news. Where were
you at, Brer. Rose?
Congressman Foster will no doubt
be the recipient of a large number of
boquets from the school ma'ams of
1 he district of Washington for the in
troduction of the bill increasing their
salaries. A whole avalanche of
posies would also be tossed to Litn
if he could in some way do a like
service for the school mr.'ams in his
own Vermont, where the pay is de
cidedly small. Could the wages be
increased School Directors would
not have the great trouble they do in
finding competent persons for teach
ers. The eight hour plan is not popular
among the farmers, whose daily work
during a large part of the year. is
nearer double that period. At the
recent convention of the National
Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry
a resolution directed against the short
hour movement was adopted. It set
forth the belief of the organization
that "it is every man's privilege to
work as many hours as he will for
pay ; that energy, thrift and activity
are entitled to encouragement and
should command lightful compensa
tion for services rendered." Good
enough doctrine his for everybody,
no matter what their occupation
may be.
IN THE SECOND DISTRICT.
An interesting letter on Vermont
politics appeared in the Boston
Herald of Sunday last. Besides dis
cussing the Governor question the
matter of the next Congressman
from the 2d district was treated to a
large extent. The writer expressed
the opinicn that Gov. Bell might
play a prominent part therein much
to the discomfiture of Kittrulge
Haskins, the present incumbent, and
Hon. Frank Plumley, who has an
eye on the position. Gov. Bell is an
enigma to many of the politicans in
that district and that he is creating
some uneasiness among the friends
of the two gentlemen named aboveis
quite true. Whether he is after the
place, and could he win out, are
droblems not easily solved.
It is true that the Governor has
a strong following, and were both
Haskins and Plumley in the field, he
might win, but if one or the other
step aside the Governor might find
the contest a lively one, especially if
he measured swords with the gentle
man from NorthGeld.
The West Point-Annapolis football

"Abide With Me." '
' Abide with me, tint falls the even-tide.
The darkness deepen Lord with me a hide
When other helpers fail and coin torts Are,
Help of the helpless, O, abide with me."
Pure and clear at first rang the
tones of the old hymn of faith and
trust. A girl was dying on the white
iron operating table of a Chicago
hospital. She was singing. And then,
fainter and fainter, grew the voice,
until the songdied away in a whisper.
The girl was dead. She had chanted
her own requiem.
Beautiful and brave Clara Butler,
soprano of the Morgan Park Baptist
church at that city, had been thrown
by accident under the wheels of a
train and was hurried to thehospital
in the hope of saving her life Dy an
operation1 in vain.
Miss Butler knew that death was
closing down upon her life. She
whispered a messagefor her relatives,
who were in an adjoining room, and
said with a smile, " Tell them that I
am not afraid to die."
And then her glorious voice, a
voice that had wafted the souls of
devout worshippers above the things
of time and sense, floated through
the operating rooms. Surgeons and
nurses turned away to, the windows
as the dying girl sang over and over
again the one stanza of her favorite
song. Their eyes were wet. The
gii I's soul was in her voice that now
faltered and died avay in a whisper
as the dark waters closed about her.
" Abide with me,"
You don't believe as the girl be
lieved? Superstition ? Deception? Re
flex influence, etc., etc. But she was
brave! And something helped to
still the awful agony in the face of
death.
Disbeliever, agnostic, or what not,
are you not glad the girl gotstrength
from some source as the life ebbed
away from her poor mangled body ?
Sure. You would no more take
away such a nope ot dying iuitli
than you would knock the crutches
from beneath a cripple. "Help of
the helpless, 0 abide with me."
Are you quite prepared to say the
prayer was unanswered?
The proposition to -change inau
guration tlav from the fourth of
March to the last Thursday in April
is a sensible one and ought to be
adopted. March is one cf the most
trying, uncertain and disagreeable
months known to Washington cli
mate and the sickness and death
which always result from the ex
posure incident to inauguration day
calls loudly for a change. Give us
smiling, pleasant April instead of
raw, uncertain, blustering March.

rjiIIE above picture of the
man and fish is the trade
mark of Scott's Emulsion,
and is the synonym for
strength and purity. It is sold
in almost all the civilized coun
tries of the globe.
If the cod iish became extinct
it would be a world-wide calam
ity, because the oil that comes
from its liver surpasses all other
fats in nourishing mid life-giving
properties. Thirty years ago
the proprietors of Scott's Emul
sion found a way of preparing
cod liver oil so that everyone can
take it and get the full value of
the oil without the objectionable
taste. Scott's Emulsion is the
best thing in the world for weak,
backward children, thin, delicate
people, and all conditions of
wasting and lost strength.

Secretary Root's letter to the
American residents of the Isle of Pines
on the. subject of their attempted
revolt from the Cuban government
is conclusive. He shows that the is
land is lawfully subject to Cuban
control, and these residents are bound
to obey the laws of the Cuban Repub
lic as long as they remain in the
island. If they fail in that obedience,
they are liable to prosecution and
punishment. The treaty now pend
ing before the Senate, the Secretary
points out, only "accords to Cuba
what is hers in accordance with inter
national law and justice. " For cen
turies the island has been part of Cuba
and never been territory of the United
States. This country will not com
pel the transfer of the island to Ameri
can control.

Bladder troubles most always result from

It corrects inability to hold urine and scald

A COLLEGE EDUCATION FREE
12 Boston Globe tree Scholarships and
Other Awards Aggregating in Cash More
Than $10,000 for the Boys and Girls of
New Cnglar.d
A colleire education is the ambition of tbe
(treat majoiity of the boys and girls of New
KiiKlnud iu these days, however unattainable
it may seem to many of them. A university
or technical training is no loncer regarded as
the exclusive privilep of the few, but is looked
upon as the key to the advancement ol the
uuipy, their main chance to rise m the world.
A scholarship at, home or abroad, ainount-
me to $r00 a year iu cash for four years, or
fL'000, i to lie the hijrhrst, award. There
will be three scholarships carrying S2;0 a
year for four years, or $1000 each; four will
carry $150 a year for four years, or JtiOO for
each; four more n ill carry $100 a year, or
total of $400. Among other contestants the
Olohe will distribute more than $125 gavines
bank books, ranging troni deposits of ?u0
down to $5.
The Boston Globe, which has so long been
the favorite of the young people, always
studying tbeir needs and sympathizing with
their aspirations, has opened a free com
petition for all the pupils id al) the schools of
New England.
TheGlobe is confident that the distribution
of all these free scholarships among its youth
ful readers will prove a powerful seneral stim
ulus toward higher education throughout the
schools of New England, and that the more
than 125 savings bank books to be dis
tributed among the boys and girls at the
close of the contest may become positive in
centives to lives of thrift.
The polls are now open, and while only
pupils in New England schools may be candi
