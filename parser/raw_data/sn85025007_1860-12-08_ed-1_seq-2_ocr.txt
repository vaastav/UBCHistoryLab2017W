The New York Courier and Enquirer,
leading Republican journal, favors tho re
peal of the Northern Nullification laws,?
compensation for slaves which the people in
any county or State refuse to surrender?
restoration of the Missouri compromise, &c.
The New York Republican State Central
Committee have just adjourned at Albany
after a brief session. The important events
of the ciay occupied in part, tho committee.
Their resolutions recommend efforts at con
ciliation; but they do not advise any change
from the positions taken in the Chicago
Platform. The Albany Evening Journal,
the leading Republican paper in New Yrork,
in view of the political troubles which have
followed Lincoln's election, proposed recent
ly that the republican party ought to make
certain concessions to allay the excitement,
among others the restoration of the Mis
souri compromise. The republican electors
met at Albany, on Tuesday, and, it is said,
condemned the Journal, which paper receded
i'rom its proposition. Mr. Seward, it is said,
also disapproves of the Journal's suggestion.
The Washington correspondent of the Bal
timore American says that there are on the
House Committee on the Union, [the names
were published in yesterday's-Gazette in
Congress news,] moderate Republicans, 7;
i'ltra Republicans (some of them of the worst
stamp,) 8; Avowed Disunionists, 3; Conser
vative Democrats, 12; Conservative Ameri
cans, 3." This, at first sight, appears to
present but a gloomy prospect?but it is to
be remembered that concessions are to come,
if auj', from the Republican side. In the
mean time, it is proper to state, that the
worst fears are entertained in Washington?
and every body now knows that the Seces
sion of two or three of the Southern States,
South Carolina leading off, is certain, this
winter.
We have waited with some curiosity to
see what the President would say in his
message on the subject of our rupture with
Peru. The fact that we are now at serious
variance with that country, for the trifling
sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dol
lars, would certainly seem worthy of some
explanation by the Executive in his annual
communication to Congress. But, probably,
as negotiations are still requested by Peru,
the President has thought it most prudent
to wait for a time yet?before he brings the
matter before Congress.
The Norfolk Examiner says: "As we have
before stated, the prominent merchants of
New York and Philadelphia did everything
they possibly could to avert the calamity of
Lincoln's election. They expended thou
sands of dollars?made the most extensive
and self-sacrificing personal efforts, and
otherwise labored indefatigably to beat back
the tide of Black Republicanism from over
flooding the country. This being the case,
we regret that many of our coteraporaries
should, icithout any distinction, whatever,
class them with the enemies of the South."
The National Intelligencer, in an appeal
to the People of the Southern States, recom
mends "the assembling, at an early day, of a
Convention or Congress of Delegates, who
bhall he appointed by the several Slavehold
nig State?, in such number and in such a
way as shall be deemed most expedient, for
the purposes of mutual consultation in res
pect atiko to the dangers believed to be im
pending and the remedy deemed most ade
quate to avert them."
Large quantities of cotton are daily pass
ing over the Virginia and Tennessee and
S juthside roads, consigned to Norfolk from
parties in Memphis. This is a mo9t favora
ble indication, and the route being the most
direct to the Atlantic seaboard from the
Mississippi valley, it is predicted that it will
ere long be the great thoroughfare over which
<he immense products of that section will
seek a market.
Presideut Buchanan's message does not
.vein to please tho ultra politicians either at
the North or the South ; but tho conservative
people, who really wish to preserve the Uni
on and secure the Rightsof the States, appa
rently, judging from the comments in the
public press, regard it favorably, and give
its author credit for a patriotic endeavor to
bring about an adjustment of difficulties.
The New York World thinks Mr. Buchan
an's Message judicious, &c. It suys: "In a*
time of great public excitement and peril, like
the present, the assertion of doubtful auihori

crease the dangerous irritation. Mr. Buch
anan has, in this respect, wisely kept on the
cafe side/''

The action of the Breckinridge Electors
in Virginia is generally, appioved. The
Petersburg Intelligencer says: "The Elec
tor on the Breckinridge ticket, who were
declared elected by the Governor by reason
of the errors of the conductors ot the election,
resigned their places yesterday, so that the
whole vote of the State might be cast for
Bell and Everett, as the voters designed they
should be. Such magnanimous conduct was
worthy of the high-minded gentlemen who
composed that ticket. Their action does
them honor, and alike reflects it on the party
represented by them."
It has been announced through the me
dium of a dispatch that a white man and
fifteen slaves had been hanged atBurksville,
Cumberland county, Ky., upon conviction of
plotting an insurrection. A letter from
that place to the Louisvillo Journal, dated
the 29th ult., does not speak of the execu
tion, and the Journal is disposed to doubt
the entire correctness of the story. It is not
impossible, however, that the whole party
may have been hanged the day aiter the let
ter was written.
Plans for saving the Union are as plenty
in New York, as in Washington, and the
Republicans, as well as other folks, are try
ing their hands at the business. One pro
position is, to have Governor Morgan call
the Legislature together, in extra session, lor
the purpose of issuing an address to the
Southern States, assuring them that New
York is not unkindly disposed towards them,
and that she is as anxious to maintain their
righ's under the Constitution as the slave
holding States could desire.
Some four months ago a servant of Jacob |
W. Bird, Sr., of West River, Md., was taken
sick, and in a few days the physician pro
nounced it a case of typhoid fever. It soon
spread until nearly all the servants were
prostrate, (only two escaped,) and two died.
Four weeks ago Mr. Bird was seized with
the same disease, and about eight days after
Mrs. Bird also. They both continued ill up
to Saturday last, when Mrs. Bird died, and
in just two hours after, Mr. Bird finished a
life of nearly four score years.

The electors of Maryland being in Wash

Ex-Senator Borland said, in a recent
speech, in Memphis, "in regard to coercion,

Gov. Winston, of Alabama, in a private
letter recently published, advocates immedi

also written a letter, from which the following
is an extract: "Never have I in a singie speech

before or since that event. On the contrar}%
I havo everywhere, in .Richmond, Xew York,

The money question begins to force itself
upon South Carolina. The Mercury proposes
that the State issue bills receivable in pay
ment of dues to the State, in order to obtain
j funds to purchase arms. Only $000,000 are
j furnished by the State tax, and $400,000
more are required. It is riot clear either
where the weapons can bo best obtained. The
Mercury suggests loading a steamer with

Letter from Hon. J. B. Floyd.
AY e make the following cxlmcta from the
letter of Hon. J. B. Floyd, Secretary of War,
to the Richmond Enquiyen?
"For one, I am not for secession as long as
any honorable effort can be made to preserve
the Union on a Constitutional basis, guanine
teeing equality, justice and protection to the
negro property of the South. I sliall not un
dertake, in this place, to particularize all the
measures of reform and policy which should
be incorporated into a settlement of the pro
sent differences between the North and the
South. I cannot conceive how harmony can
be permanently secured as long as Congress
continues to be made a mere debating club
for agitation and incendiary appeal. The
acts of the several Northern States, nullify
ing the fugitive slave law, being subversive
of the Constitution, violative of the plighted
faith of confederates, and in confl ict with the
comity of States, ought to be repealed; and
an amendment to the Constitution must lor- j
ever prevent their re-enactment.
But even though the principles of a settle
ment of the present troubles could be agreed
upon, there would be very great difficulty in
procuring their early ratification by the peo
ple of the two sections. Tho Northern mas
ses cannot be brought at once to recede from
the extreme and aggressive positions they
have assumed towards the South; while the
South, tired of broken compromises, and
smarting from repeated and never ending in
sult, will be slow and loth to accede to now
compacts. Moreover, every manifestation
by the South of a willingness to accept terms
of reconciliation, is at once construed by the
North into a proof of timidity, and made the
occasion of new insult and injury.
I believe, however, that the great material
interests of the country demand a reconcilia
tion of the sections, and the preservation of
the Union; and I rely much upon the slow-,
but certain, the silent, but potential influence
of this great agency to bring about a settle
ment of our present troubles. The main j
study of all should be to prevent any colli
sion between the sections, and riiopt especial
ly the shedding of the first drop of blood. If
we can but succeed in averting these calam
ities, the great, practical, business interests
of the country may, perchance, sooner or la
ter, bring abouta re-construction of the Uniou
and a restoration of harmony between the
sections.
It is earnestl3r to be hoped that these great
interests, aided by the disinterested prompt
ings of a sincere patriotism, may rise in their
power and with potential authority require
of the fanaticism of the North to abandon an
agitation which must lead to certain and
swift destruction. If this shall be done, who
can doubt that a returning sense of confi
dence will be felt by the injured and exas
perated South, and that peace and the Union
will bo restored.
The American peoplo are emioently prac
tical in their temper and judgment, and also
in their action, when they can be brought to
deliberate. They must see that no interest
?not one in the whole extent of the Amer
ican continent?can fail to be materially in
jured, and some of them utterly annihilated
by a dissolution of the Union. * - *
Tho South should remember, that in dis
solving the Union she annihilates a mighty
army of true, unselfish and devoted friends
at the North, who battle forever for the con
stitutional rights of the slave States. "With
out this great and efficient aid, the power of
abolition fanaticism would be unbroken and
unchecked?would indeed "surround the
South with a wall of fire." It would do
more. New England would consort with
Old England in devising means by which
the cruel and inhuman philanthrophy prac
tised by the lattor in the West India Islands
should be repeated bore. * * * * *
Twenty-five years more of Union and har
mony will concentrate tho controlling com
mercial power of the world in the waters of
New York. Then, the decline of England
becomes as certain as was that of Alexan
dria and Venice, and for the same cause.?
Instead of the first, she becomes a third rate
European power. Hut let disunion take
place?let civil war and discord distract this
country, and England well knows that the
ships of the North must rot at their wharves,
and the busy hum of their manufactories
must cease forever. Then, indeed, would
England feel again that she was mistress of
the seas without a rival, secure in a com
merce that no power could ever shake.
It is a fatal error to suppose that the inter
est of England would prompt her to foster
the planting interests of the South. From
the Prince Consort, who sat silently by and
witnessed the ueliberato insult of an Amer
ican minister b}' a British peer before the
oongregated intelligence of all Christendom,
simply because slavery existed in the United
States, down to the wretched Cockney him
self, forty times the slavo to suffering, and
circumstances beyond what any negro is to
law?thero is not an Englishman who does
not in his own heart abhor slavery, if he does
not also abhor the country where it exists.?
England will have margin enough to supply
her wants for cotton, even with a large dim
inution of our present production?if the de
mand of the North for it is cut off, as it
would be by disunion and civil war. But
England, safe in her commercial ascendancy,
does not always follow that line of policy
which others might think conducive to her
interest. Sho sacrifices much and largely to
gratify a hatred, to vindicate a blunder, or
cater, to a sentiment. ******
The Sjuth can never count upon the friend
ship of England or upon her toleration of evils
not her own. Once within tho reach of her
power, she will fix upon us forever the very
badge of inferiority which we are now ready
to destroy the Union to escape; and will fos
ter our products so far, and so far only, as
may be absolutely necessary to supply her
wants. England would insist upon making
good her record upon the slavery question.
To sacrifice the interests of a class, or even
to starve to death a few hundred thousands
of her subjects in the laudabio task, would
constitute a very small obstacle to her policy.
But with all these oonsequences attending
the measure of disunion, and multitudinous
others, which readily occur to every mind,
no option is left uow but, eithor to choose to
encounter them or to secure those guaran
tees which must stop at once, and forever,
the aggressions aud agitation to which the
North has been so long addicted, on the sub
ject of slaver}r, With proper guarantees of
this sort, whioh oould bo given by amend
ments to the Constitution, we may go on in a
happy and cordial Union, made so from a
mutuality of pecuniary interests, and a con
sciousness which union will give us of power
to maintain all our rights aud command tho
rcspect of the world.
I am of opinion that the Legislature of
Virginia should immediately call a conven
tion of the people of the State with a view of
referring all these momentous questions to
the arbitrament of a convention of all the
States, such as is provided for in the Federal
Constitution, and that, in the meantimo,
Virginia should pseall her influence to calm
the exasperated feelings of the country and
to prevent, if possible, a hostilo collision in
any quarter or from any cause."

Methodist Convention at Baltimore.
On Thursday evening, Air. Carter, chair
man of the committee on business, reported
the following memorial and resolutions,
which vrere read by -Judge Bond, of the com
mittee:
Majority" Keport.?To the Baltimore An
nual Conference at Staunton assembled: ?
Fathers and Brethren:?At a convention of
the laity representing a large majority of
circuits and stations within the bounds of
your confcrence, held on the fifth day of
December, IbGO, to take intu consideration
the .state of the church within the territory
of the conference, the difficulties which meet
ua and calamities which threaten us wore
duty considered, and the convention resolved
to express to you by memorial their conclu
sions respecting the present condition of the
church in Maryland, Virginia, and the Dis
trict of Columbia. The great object had in
view in the call of the convention was peace.
An ardeut wish pervaded the whole conven
tion to free our preachers from the obliga
tion of perpetually defending our church
policy respecting slavery, and to leave them
at liberty to preach the gospel to which they
were called.
For a long series of years, from 1844, the
date of the unfortunate great division of the
church, till now, (our conference by that ne
paration having been rendered a border con
ference,) we have had over a large portion
of our .territory an incessant contest with
brethren of the Southern Conference, and
others, on the subjectof discipline respecting
slavery. Like all contests touching ecclesi
astical matters, the controversy has been
couducted with much warmth and bitterness
?out* preachers constantly on the defensive,
required to defend the action of our General
Conference on that subject, havo been tram
meled in the preaching of the Gospel, until
at last all hope of any material increase of
membership has been abandoned. Our
preachtirs and laity havo been happy, indeed
if the}' have been able to maintain the church
as she is, without expecting to increase her
strength by any important addition to her
membership.
.> At this juncture assembled the lute Gen
eral Conference, a body which little under
stood and seemingly, little cared for the inter
ests and condition of our church in tho
bounds of your conference, and which, in
stead of ameliorating our condition, has ren
dered it infinitely worse by substituting an
entirely new chapter on the subject of slave
holding, making non-slaveholding a test of
membership, and utterly closing all doors
of entrance to the people against the preach
ers of your conference, if they endorse or
submit to it.
Your whole duty, in the opinion of the
convention, is to preach the gospel, and that
to as many of the people within the bouuds
of your conference as is possible. It is use
less to state to you, for your body must be
aware that after the incessant efforts you
have made under the late discipline, you
have lost in the Baltimore Annual Confer
once territory and population represented by
somo twenty-one circuit and station appoint
ments in the Methodist Episcopal Church
South. With tho new chapter on slavery
you are^utterly precluded in the whole slave
holding territory of the conference from
preaching with any success, because the peo
ple will not willingly listen to men placed
under solemn obligations to maintain and
administer a church discipline contrary to
the sentiments of our poople and even ob
noxious to civil censure.
Aloug tho whole border you are brought
face to face with the preachers, your breth
ren, of the .Methodist Episcopal Church
South, and the only substantial difference
existing between you in point of church
ceremony, creed or discipline, is in this vex
ed slavery question, la the minds of the
masses, tho only reason for your antagonistic
relation to that church is your implied obli
gation, under the discipline, t<> inculcate a
doctrino on that subject which constitutes
the distinction between our church and that.
Your silence upon the chapter, your vari
ed explanations of it, and your repudiation
of it, avail nothing. The hearts of the peo
ple are closed to you. The church is in per
petual agitation. All church enterprise is
retarded. The building of church en and
parsonages has almost entirely ceased, and [
missionary collections are called for in vain, i
The pulpit ceases in a great measure to ad- i
dress the ungodly, and is of necessity com- i
pelled to light for the very existence of the j
ohureh itself. It was more than the church
could do, prior to the late general conference,
to maintain herself among us?with the new
chapter on slavery, it is impossible.
Under these circumstances, dear brethreu,
we look to you to provide some measure of
peace and quiet to our denomination here,
which shall preserve our unity.
Sixteen years of perpetual strife have
passed, and our people refuse longer to stay
with us if quiet be not restored, and our
preachers be.allowed, as we know you desire
to be, to preach a Gospel not of contention,
but peace. In the opinion of this convention,
your counection with the Northern Confer
ences implies the prolonging of strife and
bitter controversy, which must result in dis
astrous consequences. From that connec
tion you derive no strength or support.?
Every periodical published by our Church is
imbued with controversy on this subject;
some of them, indeed, it would be penal to
circulate in Maryland and Virginia.
No good reason can be given for the raain
tenance of tho connection, which we are of
opinion is not desired by a large majority of
our Northern brethren, except upon terms
which would prove our ruin.
The Baltimore Conference have, by unani
mous vote, again and again assured our peo
ple in the midst of strife engendered by this
agitation, that they would not hold connec
tion with any ecclesiastical body which made
non-slaveholding a test of membership. The
people now demand a fulfilment of those
pledges.
We do not pretend to conceal that what
over course you may take to ail ay the strife
and excitement among us will be involved in
some difficulty. It is certain that unless it
is distinctly understood by our people, after
your present session, that you acknowledge
no connection with or authority of the late
General Conference, aud refuse to adminis
ter the discipline it made, our Church in
Virginia and much of Maryland is gone for
ever.
After due deliberation, therefore, we have
determined to ask our preachers ot the Balti
more Conference that, for the sake of quiet
in our borders, for the sako of the preaching
ot the Gospel, that it may find ready en
trance among us, for the ending of contro
versy and to promote the best interests of
Methodism and religion, they redeem the
pledges given time after time to our people,
aud sunder a connection now merely nomi
nal, which is full of strife and positively
death to all hopes of peace or the advance
ment of Christianity in our midst.
Having settled the question of dissolution
of our Church connection, we do not deem it
necessary, nor do we desire to point out the
specific mode of subsequent conference action
as to the form or character of our future or
ganisation. We have described the well
known shite of the Church, suggested the
source of relief, nnd only desire to add that
whatever mode you may adopt for its accom
plishment, you may confidently expect the
hearty support of the laity of the conference.
We desire to submit to the conference tho
opinion of the convention more specifically
embodied in the following resolutions:
1st. Resolved, That the Baltimore Annual
Conference should at its next session declare
that by its recent unconstitutional and violent
action the JBuffalo General Conference has
sundered the ecclesiastical connection winch
has hitherto held ua together a* one church,
and that the Baltimore Conference does not
and cannot longer remain under its jurisdic
tion or submit to its authority, or those rep
resenting' that authority.
2-1. Resolved, That the Baltimore Annual
Conference should also assert and claim that
the said General Conference has, by its said
action, separated the several annual confer
ences represented therein, and concurring in
said action, from the Baltimore and other
non-concurring conferences, and that the
Baltimore and other non-concurring confer
ences constitute the Methodist Episcopal
Church proper, and may exercise all the
rights, duties, and powers appertaining pro
perly to their position as such.
3d. Resolved, That the position we shall
occupy after such action as has been indicat
ed has been taken?whether it shall be that
of independence or union with some other
branch of the Methodist family upon such
terms as might bo mutually satisfactory, is
a question which this convention is willing
10 leave to the sound discretion of the said
Annual Conference, in the light of all the
facts and circumstances surrounding it.
4th. Resolved, That a committco be ap
pointed by this convention to present the
| proceedings of the same to the next session
| of the Baltimore'Annual Conference, through
such members of conference as they may
elect, and that they be instructed so to do at
the earliest practicable moment.
Minority Report.?Mr. Joseph 0. Fow
ler submitted the following minority report:
"Being unable to agree with the majority
eftho committee on business in their report,
we submit the fallowing minority report,
expressing, as we believe it does, the wishes
of the people we represent.
"We agree with the majority in relation
to the cause of our present troubles in the
introduction of the new chapter into our
Book of Discipline. But we differ from the
majority, however, in the mer.ns they pro
pose for our relief.
"We are opposed to immediate secession
from the Methodist Episcopal Church, be
cause wo fear a prematuve effort to sunder
our relations would involve us in serious
and extensive litigation, and wholly |fail to
secure the.pcaee and unity we are seeking.
"We think it Tjeat to memoralize our con
ference at its next session to take a decided
stand in opposition to the new chapter, and
demand of the fJeneral Conference its re
moval from the Discipline?and if we fail to
receive at their hands redress, then we shall
be ready for separation.
"But let us do as Christians do?as some
of our best statesmen are advising the South
' now to do?exhaust every lawful means be
fore we have recourse to extraordinary means.
"Let uf; not, by any rash act, add to the
excitement which now agitates our once unit
ed and happy country, but let us, like Moses
on the seashore, stand still for a season, and
see the salvation of God.
"Joseph 0. Fowlbr."
An animated discussion ensued upon the
presentation of these reports, alter which
the report and resolutions proposed by the
majority of the Committee were adojded by
lb e Convention.

The Slave Trado.
Washington, Doc. 6.?The President sent
to die House to-day a very large mass of doc
uments, in response to a resolution adopted
at the former session. I'roni a cursory ex
amination of their contents it appears that
the cost per annum of tho African squadron
from the year 1843 to 1859, was $384,000.?
The cost for the present year is estimated at
about $800,000, owing to the employment of
war vessels, a majority of them being steam
Gl'H.
In his instructions to the Flag Officer, the
Secretary of the Isavy says the United Stages
does not claim that the mere hoisting of our
flag should give immunity to those who have
no right to wear it. Such a pretence would
subject it to degradation and dishonor, be
cause it would thus be made a cover tor pir
acy and other crimes of similar atrocity; but
our own citizens, who rightfully display it,
are entitled to absolute immunity and pro
tection. You will, therefore, he adds, be
prompt to prevent the search or detention of
vessels of rhe United States on the high seas,
in times of peace, by the armed vessels of any
other power. And, should vessels of the
United States falsely assume the flag of any
other nation, it would constitute no protec
tion.
Among the documents there is one itom
the State Department, a note from Lord
llussell to L >rd Lyons, which the latter, by
direction, read to Secretary Cass. It is dat
ted February last. . r , ,
Lord Russell says:? It is his painful duty
to call attention to the increasing activity
and success of the slave trade carried on be
tween the coasts of Africa and Cuba; ana that
it appears that the number of negroes intro
duced into Cuba last year was from 22,000
to 30,000. Also, that United States cap
ital has been more and more employed in
this traffic, the parties sailing under the Am
erican flag. The governments of Frauce,
United States, Portugal and Brazil, have co
operated with the Governments of Great
Britain, with a view to put an end to this de
testable traffic. The Government of Spain
has alone persisted in screening and favoring
this trade. _ #
The corruptness of the Spanish officials m
Cuba is notorious. They make their return
to Spain ta enjoy their ill-gotten treasure.
Ia a letter from Mr. Cass to Mr. Dallas,
dated March, 31st, 18G0, he says that there
is much in tho conflict of the British officers
of which this country may justly complain,
and that certain reports and various occur
rences warn us of the necessity of increased
vigilance whoa the safety of vast interests of
our citizens upon the ocean is brought in
question. Mr. Cass plainly says that the
President had read with surprise and dissat
isfaction certain British official representa
tions, which, in the judgment of the Execu
tive Department, are not supported^ by the
facts advanced; nor are they compatible with
the respect which is due from one indepen
dent nation to another.
It further appears from these documents
that the British Government has frequently
complained to our own about the increase of
the slave trade. So Mr. Cass writes to Mr.
Dallas in October last to assure Lord Russell
that the foreign office has been assured more
than once before that certain diplomatic sug
gestions are as unnecessary as they are un
acceptable, and to express the. hope that this
Government entertains that similar appeals
will not bo again repeated, fur this Govern
ment needs not such repeated representa
tions to stimulate its action or to teach it its
duty,
Counsel of Virginia not Wanted.?Some
person from Virginia sends a communica
tion to the Charleston Mercury, pledging the
Eastern part of Virginia to stand by South
Carolina in her secession movements, but
condemning the expressions of the Mercury,
that in the eyes of Carolina''Virginia is com
pletely demoralized," &c. To which the
Charleston Mercury replies as follows: "We
thank our correspondent for the above kind
assurance of the sympathy and support of
Eastern Virginia. lie will pardon us; how
ever, if wc still decline (so far as the counsel
of the Mercury is concerned) to enter at this
time into any Convention or council with
Virginia, or any other State. We ave now
acting for ourselves, and by ourselves, upon
our own sovereignty. Our correspondent
will also pardon us if we doubt tho ability,
at this time, of any border State to give us
good counsel, or to assise in forwarding our
action. We have need for no other counsel
or assistance, and will accept of oone other."
Banquet to the Bell and Everett Electors.
The Richmond Bell and Everett Club
gave a Banquet to the Electors of Virginia,
on Wednesday night, at the Exchange Ho
tel, Richmond. W. H. Macfarhnd, esq., pre
sided, and the banquet was luxurious.?
The regular toasts called forth many speech
es. Waller R. Staples, respondod to the
?
41 Virginia.?True to herself, nor ever false
to any." She was the Lode-Star of the Colo
nies cn their march to Independence, lne
Lode-Star of the Stntes on their path to Uni
on. Whether separate or conjoined, yet
fixed and self-sufficing. No baleful comet
on the one hand, nor shooting star on tne
other, shall drag or drive her from her lngn
place and poise in the political Heavens. ^
Mr. Staples made a conservative but im
pressive speech. He rejected the idea that
Virginia was to be dragged or^coerced ir"to
disunion. Rather than see "V irginia so de
graded as to follow where Suuth Carolina
might choose to lead, he would see her
standing solitary and alone with but a sin
gle star upon her flag. South Carolina bad a
right to go if she wished, and he would op
pose the march of the mercenaries of Mas
sachusetts or of the Federal Government to
arrest her progress. But he thoroughly op
posed the secession of Virginia as long as
she could consistently remain in the Union.
Non-intercourse and retaliation would bring
the North to its senses, the South would be
| built up, her commerce established, and her
I glory perpetuated.
j The next toast was: The Union?Founded
on equality, cemented by good will, covered
1 in by the Constitution. If either fall irre
j parablv, theedilice must fall, and ought to
tall. Northern fanaticism would deny the
first, has loosened the second and threatens
i the last. Will the conservatives repair the
wrong and restore the edifice?" (Music
| "Star Spangled Banner.")
By request, Hon. John M. Botts respond
ed. The Union was a subject upon which he
was always prepared to speak. lie referred
with gratification to their fact that thic
' toral vote of Virginia had been cast lor Bell
and Everett, and accorded honor to lhe live
Breckinridge Electors who set aside apre
i cedent that was pernicious and unexampled.
He was also gratified to see their frit inds ot
the Douglas party here, and bade the;ai wel
! come. He hoped that here the corner stone
i would be laid for building up a great Union
party in Virginia, which would crush under
I'its heci the disunion party. He was j.;iadto
hear so strong an expression of Union from
gentlemen present and agreed with thean ex
cept in one or two position. Ho unshed
I South Carolina could go out and stay' out,
for she has acted as a common brawinr lor
the last thirty years-?[Applause.] B ut he
opposed her right to do so. It was because
there was a compact?a free and voluntary
compact?between the States, binding them
selves to it, that it can be enforced. If the
compact had been forced upon them, then
they would have had the right to throw it
out. He did not despair of the Unicn.
South Carolina had declared herself out of
the Union before, but the Union was not dis
solved. There were conservative men at the
North, as well at the South. If moderate
counsels prevailed, he fully believed that the
obnoxious laws at the North would be -re
pealed. It could not be done in a moment,
but he believed it would be done.?He Ua#l
reliable intelligence, which would have bean
published loug ago if he had had a channel of
communication with the public,^ assuring
him that Mr. Lincoln was aD old line Whig,
and would administer the Government u p
on the principles of Henry Clay. .Chore
was power enough in Congress and in the
conservatism of the country to stop tha .im
pending storm, if it were properly exercised,
lie believed Congress could pass a law re
lieving the Fugitive Slave law of those ob
noxious features to which he had alludeciin
all his speeches, and making it a felony of
the highest grade to rescue a fugitive sr^ave
from the hands of officers?and Congresi as
suming the responsibility or paying for
every slave so rescued, and holding it as a
charge against the State in which such res
cue was effected?and it would satisfy all
the South except South Carolina. V-A-p
plause.] Mr. Botts commented with -some
severeity upon the President's Message. Le
thought it an absurdity for the President to
say that he could not execute the law in Sou th
Carolina, because there was no Judge and n o
Marshal. If the Constitution and tliolaw.s
could not be upheld without force, be was U'
favor of using force. If such a condition of
affairs existed in the North, force w-ouid be
used, and he was opposed to any discnmioa-,
tion between sections. He approved the
proposition for a Convention ot the border
States, but opposed, utterly, a Sou;\hern
Convention, where the door would be open- <
ed to such lire-eaters as would be sent from
the cotton States. He saw no great good to
result from a National Convention; ao d in
the present excited State of the public n line*
he was totally opposed to a State Convent ion,
.and it would be a Democratic Conventi on,
for it would not be safe to confide to such ? a
body the great interests involved. He it w
plored the Union men to set their fac es
against it, and against the assembling of a
Democratic National Convention.
B. II. Shackleford responded to the toast:
?"The Rights of the South."?Let her ef
forts to maintain them be in the right direc- \
Li U LI r
He said it gave him pleasure, always, to
respond to such a toast, und he might be ex
cuse for saying that he could not agree with
any gentleman who had spoken, except one.
It was the right of The ."South to oppose the
wrongs ID dieted by the North, and he hoped,
there would be a united South for such a.
purpose. If the rights of the South cannot
be preserved in the Union, let us go out. He
rejected the idea of coercion as advanced by
one of the speakers. Ilis blood boiled in op
position to it. It was u-jeless to talk of the
subjugation ol a Southern State upon such,
an issue as this. He favored a Convention
of the State of Virginia to decide the ques
tion. Where Virginia led we would follow.
She could take but one course, and that
course would be for the South. Mr. S. did
not favor tearing down this government, but
he thought the time had come for the South
to present a bold and defiant front to the
Northern power; to say that if they did not
repeal their obnoxious laws, thenceforward
we would be two people.
A number of letters in response to invita
tions were Tead, among them one from Gov
ernor Letcher accompanied by the following
toast:
Virginia?Her honor, her rights, her in
terests,, und her institutions are safe in the
hands of her sons, native and adopted?
whether Bell meu, Breckinridge men, or
Douglas inco. All will be equally faithful in
the hour of trial.
The banquet closed at a late hour.
South Cauolin'a Movements.?A favorite
scheme with the Governor of South Caro
lina, as dicloseu in his recent message, is
to prohibit the introduction of slaves into
that State from North Carolina aDd other
border States, so as to force these border
States to join South Carolina or emancipate
their slaves. So we go 6ays the Raleigh
Standard. The extremists ot the North wish
to pen us up. so as to compel us to emanci
pate our slaves, and the Governor of South
Carolina desires to do the same thing! If
the old Union cannot be preserved by force,
how are wo to be forced, on pain of losing our
slaves, to become contented membees of a
new Union? >Ve leave it to the wise a?d di?
passionate Jesters in "Carolina" JO answer

The Action of the Breckinridge Electori.
The Richmond Enquirer commenting 0u
tho action of the Democratic Electors in with
drawing from tbe Electoral College, and
thereby allowing the entire vote of the Stato
to be cast for Bell and Everett, fay?:
4< W e should do violence toour own feelings
did we omit an especial expression of hied
approbation for the conduct of the five Demo
cratic elector* on the occasion of the assem
blage of the Electoral College, on Wednesday
last. These gentlomen were placed in a pog.
tion of great difficulty and much delicacy
The difficulties presented to their mature
consideration were, indeed, much greater
than may appear to a careless observer. In
the first place, they; ?new that certificates of ~
election had been- issued to them, in conse
quence of executive decisions on points mere
ly technical; in other words, that the is
sue of such certificates was accidental. Oa
the other hand, they could not but know
from the unmistakable indications of the late
election, that a large majority of the voters
preferred their election to that either of the
Bell olectors, or of the Douglas ejectors, and
that, in fact, the popular will would be' Best
fulfilled by the casting of their votes for
Breckinridge and Lane; in other words, they
r know that the legal election of the Bell elec
tors wa?? as much an accident, as was the
legal issue of certificates of election to the
: Democratic electors. Again, they knew that
; the certificates issued to them, would enable
? them to cast a part only of the electoral yote
! of the State, actually less in proportion to
; the whole electoral vote, than the vote real
; ly cast for them showed in comparison with
! the whole popular vote of the State. These
considerations were backed not only by par
; ty attachments, but by patriotic feeling.
The wholo matter was made the subject of
' searching examination and serious consulta
1 tion. Ail endeavored loyally to unite io a
right decision. And that the decision in
which tbey did finally unite was tbe right
decision, we entertain no doubt whatever.?
The one fatfi; before them, that no plurality
of the popular vote had been actually and
intentionally cast in favor of their election,
was made the sole ground-work of their de
cision- However unmistakablo may have
been the indications of popular preference,
they knew that that prefencS, in their case,
had not been explicitly declared; and tbey
were unwilling to fulfil their own preference
upon any ground of mere presumption, how
ever strong, either of law or of fact. 'In a
word, their action was that of Virginia gen
tlemen, guided by the most delicate sense of
public responsibility and personal honor.?
It is to us a matter of the most sincere con
gratulation that distinguished citizens of
Virginia are found thus to rise to the full
dignity of tbeir highest duty, especially at a
moment when the trying exigencies of our
national affam demand that selfish inclioa
| tions and party preferences shall be cast
j aside, and our puby.*3 men shall be guided
I only by motives aT)Ove the possibility of
doubt."
Explanation-.?The National Intelligen
ces* thus explains the apparent contradiction
which the President commits in denying
tie right of secession and yet holding "that
Oongress has no right to use coercion to pre
vent secession. In effect Mr. Buchanan as
serts secession to be a Constitutional wrong
| and yet denies that Congress has the power
to prevent the perpetration of that wrong.
On this the Intelligencer says:
"If tho President's denial that our Feder
al Union is "a mere voluntary association of
States" may seem to any in conflict with the
opinion propounded in the sequel of his ar
gument on this topic, whoa he holds that
Congress has no power "to make war on a
State" or to "coerce a State into submis
sion," it is perhaps just to observe that this
apparent logical contradiction springs from a
failure to discriminate between the action of
States and of individuals under a Govern
ment like ours. The laws of the Cuited
States, within the sphere of their jurisdic
tion, are incumbent on the individual citi
zens of every State in the Union, and the
Chief Magistrate being bound "ro take care
I that the Jaws be faithfully executed/' it ob?
viously follows, as the Message affirms, that
"from this obligation he cannot be absolved
by any human authority." If tbe spirit of
disaffection and revolt in any State lias be
come so rife that to resist the contumacy of
individuals is to resist the entire State, it
may well be said that in such a case "coer
cion/' however clear, in point of "right,"
would be little likely to prove a remedy.?
The logic of events must doubtless be respec
ted as well as the logic of constitutional law,
but the latter is not required, for that reas
on, to lower itself in the form of argument."
Lotal Sons.?The Adjutant General of
this State has received several letters from
several Virginians living in other States,
tendering their services, in a military oapa
'city, in the event of disturbances. A cadet
?of the Lexington Institute, once adjutant of
the corps of cadets, but now a resident of
Mobile, Alabama, savs:
"In the event of Virginia's becoming in-,
j volved in war, either civil or otherwise, T
I am at your service. .Were I not ready I
j would_ be recreant to my duty as a man aod
as Virginian. My class motto was" Vocem
expixtain.ua," ("We await the call,"] and
whenever the tocsin of war is sounded, I
for one, will be with you."
Another, writing from Philadelphia, says:
"I am ready, should such a contingency
arise, to give up business and take my post
as a private. I am "willing to march to the
aid of gallant old South Carolina.
Thig iatter gentleman is a relative of tho
Adjutant General, and atone time command
ed a company of artillery in this city.
These are but a few of several letters of
like import.?jRickmondEnquirer.
Worse and Worse.?A correspondent of
the Columbus {53a.) Times advocates that the
proposed Southern Confederacy shall be or
ganized as a ''Constitutional Monarchy."?
Kepublicamsm he thinku has been tried and
found wanting, and the only safety of the
South is in a "strong government." A cor
respondent of the Enquirer, published at the
same place, thinks that if the South wants a
king, it should^ "get a descendant of George
the Third, as it would be difficult to uiake
one of American stuff, for the reason so many
aspirants Tvould consider their claims set
aside if not elected to the office, and might
rebel." Mr. Bartow, a secession leader in
Georgia, advocates a "strong, consolidated
government" and the abolition of all State
Governments in the Southern Confederacy.
