In his annual report Secretary Bonaparte of the navy department
points out that national safety depends upon the construe'- of more
battleships. The United States occupies a unique position as far as safety
from invasion is concerned. It is teparated by three thousand miles of
ocean on the east and by six thousand miles of ocean on the west from any
possible enemy. Given one of the strongest navies in the world we are
absolutely safe from Invasion, and are not under the necessity of main
Ulning a tremendous army as the European countries are compelled to
do. European countries have to keep not only large navies but also large
armies all tho time, not so much fcr the purpose of waging war as tc
guarantee peace. The United Stat'.s not having any powerful neighbors
bordering it, is not undor the necessity of providing for a large army dur
ing times of peace. And la time of war no foreign nation would bo able
to land a force in our country in the face of a large navy. The greatest
need of this country, as Secretary Bonaparte says, is more battleships
If it were as easy to build a battleship as it is to recruit a regiment, we
wouldn't have to bother so much about the question of strengthening our
navy. Unifortunately, however, it akes from two to three years to build
a first class battleship and if the time for building such a battleship is
put off until war has been declared the war would have been fought and
settled long before the ship was completed.
Just at the present time we her murmurings of trouble with Japan
Japan's naval strength is now the greatest it has ever been. She cap
tured battleships and armoured erasers from Russia during the late wai
which have been completely overhauled and put in first class condition.
Besides this she ha3 added several new battleships built In England. On
ly recently the largest battleship ever built was launched la Japan for her
nary. Japan 13 in tip top condition for a war with us, and it looks decld
edly as though she Is looking for one too. The San Francisco Bchool ques
tion Is only a trivial thing but the Japanese are magnifying it to propor
tions that will almost justify them In going to war with us.
If Japan can force a war on us during the next year or so, she will have
tleallv as much at her mercy as she had Russia. Almost all
our sea power Is located on the Atlantic ocean, and Japan, witn her pres
ent strength on the Pacific could easily wipe out our small naval force
there. To assure our country peace. Congress shouldtake steps to
build enough battleships and armoured cruisers for service in the Pa
clflc to completely out-class Japan. We should In fact have at least
twenty battleships on the Pacific and a similar number on th.3 Atlantic.
Upon the completion of the Panama canal the power of such a force
would be about doubled, so easy would it be for the two fleets to combine.
But for tho present wo have no Panama canal to render easy tho joining
of our Pacific and Atlantic fleets and won't have for many years. There
fore it Is up to Congress to provide enough warships to thoroughly pro
tect our Pacific coast line from the consequences of any probable war
with Japan just at present.

v Street Commissioner Ed Dye has a
perplexing problem on hand just now
with reference to clearing the alleys
of the city of the vertiable mountains
of ashes. Though the force now em
ployed In this work is working its full
time limit, there is apparently no re
lief In sight for the city as a whole
until more men and teams are added.
The condition now prevailing is a
natural and direct result of the shift
from natural gas to coal and wood.
Six or eight years ago when the home
that used coal or wood as a heating
fuel was an exception, there was lit
tle difficulty In keeping alleys clear
of ashes.
From that time until tho present
the change of fuel has been gradual
and now the home that does not use
coal or wood is an exception and a
very rare one at that. In consequence
alleys have been the 'dumping
grounds of tons and tons of the resi
due of coal and wood fires and work
as hard as it may, the force employed
Is not adequate to the demands upon
it. There are some alleys in Rich
mond which have not been visited
by the ash gatherers in .two weeks
and hc iscwlves who pride themselves
in having alleyways as neat as the
streets in front of their homes natur
ally complain. The season Is here
when the icemen's troubles are end
ed, but he has a worthy successor in
woes in the ash man. Street Com
missioner Dye said yesterday after
noon that ho realized fully what he
was up against in the ash-gathering
proposition and that he would be
compelled to have an additional force.

Washington, Dec. 7. Indiana now
ranks fourth among the States in the
canning of fruits and vegetables. The
five leading states, ranked according
to the value of all products canned,
are California, Maryland, New York,
Indiana and Illinois. The Census
Bureau today made public statistics
on the canning industry, as disclosed
by the census of manufactures taken
last year. Two thousand seven hun
dred and three establishments were
in operation when the census was
taken. Their total capital was $70,-
082,076, and they employed 53,862
persons, paid out $17,454,308 in wages
consumed materials costing $70,058,-
CS6, and manufactured products to
the value of $108,505,471. In all of
these items except that of the number
of persons employed, the industry
shows a marked increase since the
census of 1900. The decrease in the
number of persons employed was
slight, and was due to the increased
use of the contract system, under
which laborers are not reported as
employes.

and S. II. Tolles of Cleveland, and J.
C. Troup of Bowling Green, attorneys
Df the Standard Oil company of Ohio,
argued the motion to dismiss the peti
tion in error, because it Is claimed the
common pleas court has no jurisdic
tion to review the proceedings of the
probate court in criminal cases. The
petition in error raised the question
among others that the probate court
has no jurisdiction to try cases under
the Valentine anti-trust law. Other
questions are alleged errors of the
probate court. All of them are techni
cal. The outcome of the arguments
will determine whether John D. Rock

DECORATED BUILT BY MRS
JENNIE FI8KE.

Ithaca. X. Y., Dec. 7. The Chi Psi
fraternity house at Cornell university
caught fire, and soon the structure
was ablaze. Before firemen could ar
rive O. L. Schmuck of Hanover, Pa.,
Jumped from a third story window
and was so severely injured he died.
This makes the probable dead six, in
cluding three of Ithaca's volunteer
firemen, who were killed while fight
ing the flames. Four students lie In
the infirmary at the point of death.
The chapter house was built by
Mrs. Jennie McGraw Fiske on the
campus overlooking Cayuga Lake, but
never occupied by her because of her
premature death. The building was
a beautiful structure of sandstone.
The Interior was handsomely decorat
ed with marble and mahogany. The
walls were of double rubble and col
lapsed under fiames and high wind.
The volunteer firemen killed were
A. S. Robinson, a lawyer and a grad
uate of Cornell; Esty JLandon and
John Rumsey. They were manipulat
ing hose when a wall collapsed on
them and they slowly roasted under
the burning debris. When the fire
men arrived screams of two men ap
pearing in the windows of the south
east tower over the main entrance
were heard. For some reason the
men hesitated to jump. Before they
could be reached the tower collapsed
and they were buried under the ruins.
The fire started in the kitchen, in
the basement of the chapter house,
and the flames gained considerable
head way before students in the house
were awakened.
The chapter house burned rapidly
and the walls cracked apart in all di
rections. The fire was so hot the fire
men were driven from one side of the
building. They put up a hard fight,
but the wails were so hot attempt at
rescue was impossible.
Although Schmuck got out of the
building, ho went back for his room
mate, H. M. Nichols of Chicago, and
in the attempt to rescue his comrade
he was so seriously Injured he died.
Nichols is missing and is believed to
be one of the victims.
Among those who were taken from
the ruins was J.' M. McCutcheon of
Pittsburg, the football fullback substi
tute. He was in a pitiable condition,
bleeding from cuts caused by falling
timbers and bricks. He died of his
injuries.
C. J. Pope, a freshman of the fra
ternity, is missing and is supposed to
be under the ruins.
F. W. Greele of Orange, N.'J., a
freshman, is supposed to be dead.
W. W. Goets of Milwaukee, R. R.
Powers of Atlanta, and H. M. Curry,
Jr., of Pittsburg were Injured.
This is the most serious disaster
that ever occurred at Cornell, though
at the Delta Chi chapter house fire
some years ago several lives were lost

Two Freights in Head on Collision
Said to Have Been Due to a Misun

Demolished.
Publishers' Press.
Lewiston. Me., Dec. 7. Four people
were killed and three others seriously
injured in a head-on collision between
a special and regular freight train on
the Maine Central railroad near Anne
besoako. The wreck was said to be
due to a misunderstanding of orders.
Both trains were going so fast when
they met that eight of the 13 cars of
the special were hurled over the en
gine, and demolished with the greater
part of the contents. The track was
blocked for hours.
The dead are: Fireman Hodges of
the special. Engineer Fletcher of the
regular train. Engineer Harrlman of
the special. Brakeman Itowe of Lewis
ton. Fireman Charles of the regular
trains sustained a compound fracture
of arm, which may have to be ampu
tated at shoulder. Two brakeman
were badly cut about the head and
sustained f" c "!? and burns.
The work on the new Pennsylvania
lighting plant is progressing very
rapidly and although the machinery
has not yet arrived it is expected in
the course of the next few days. The
poles which will be used have been
put in place and the wires will be
connected so soon as the dynamos
arrive.
Supt. Neff stated yesterday that
he could not say as to the exact time
when the railroad company would
quit using, power from the city light
plant, but it would be within the six
month's limit set by the railroad com
pany and notice given to the Board
of Public Works.

Dean Fined.
Chicago, Dec. 7. "Walter M. Deane,
agent in this city of the Canton Rub
ber company, was fined $2,500 In the
United States district court. Dean,
with officers of the rubber company,
recently sentenced to serve one year
each in the house of correction, was
Indicted on a charge of conspiring to
violate the federal law governing in
terstate traffic in articles used for im
moral purpose
The natural gas situation locally Is
not Improved so that any of the
housewives notice It. Persistency
will accomplish many things and so
it comes about that water may be
made to boil if time is given it. The
time required varies in different parts
of the city, but generally speaking
the pressure of the gas Is so low that
often doubt arises as to whether gas
fires are really lighted. Ye; 3rday
cold weather increased the demands
made upon the supply and the deplet
ed pressure was perhaps more in evi
dence than ever before this winter.
The gas company has been making a
strenuous effort to get its "new
stack" of Henry county fuel piped in
to the homes of its Richmond patrons
and the company officers have said
from the beginning of the work that
there was every indication that this
winter's supply would probably be as
bountiful as last. There still is rea
son to believe that the situation will
be relieved to a considerable extent
within the next day or two, and in
the meantime the users of natural
gas are living hope on partially cook
ed food.

Ban Fru ., tc. 7.- n an intei-
vlew bearing on the recommendations
made in his message by President
Roosevelt on Japanese naturalization
and on ths segregation of their chil
dren in schools, K. Uyenpa, Japan's
consul here, says: "Sentiment is
practically universal among the 10,000
Japanese In San Francisco that tl
recommendations made by the presi
dent constitute the most rational so
lution of American-Japanese problems
yet attempted. The Japanese are not
only pleased with the message, but
they regard it as one of the most note
worthy documents of international
questions Issued from the White
House. There is no question but the
bonds between Japan and the United
States would be considerably strength
ened by conferring the privilege of
franchise cn the Japanese in Califor
nia. There are some ,50.000 Japanese
in the state, and while I am not in a
position to say how many of there
would take advartae, of naturaliza
tion privileges, I do think that the
number would be comparatively large.
I think this would be especially so in
the case of the" Japanese in San Fran
cisco. Many Japanese have family
and property interests here, and they
would naturally regard San Francisco
as their permanent home once they
believed they had the same privileges
as other aliens. Concerning the school
segregation question a fit is being
written and talked about It that is due
to misconception of the facts In the
case. I think the entire matter will
be solved satisfactorily, and that there
is no occasion for believing otherwise.
The Japanese are not striving for any
thing unreasonable, and are quite will
ing to let the facts in the dispute
guide whatever decision is to be nltl
