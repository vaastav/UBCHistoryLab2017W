SYBACU8E De 2AlL the developments In
the CAiteof tho wreck at Preblo lat night of the
New York and Philadelphia express on the
Delaware Lacknwanua and Western Railroad
RO 10 show that the wreck was not the result of
accident bnt was a diabolical and deliberate
plot on the part ot persona as yet unknown
The theory which was first advanced that
I was the work of boys who him
been led astray by reading dime novels
and the story of the wreck of 0 New York Cen
tral train by boy bandits Rome recently
not regarded as sound for It Is held by experi
enced railroad men that It could have been I
planned and carried out a It was only by men I
familiar with tho operation of switches like the I
one leading t the siding at Preble and with the
general workings of the road
This snitch which I on the southbound
track I what Is technically known A a camel
back switch and Is obscured from the view of
the engineer by the big water tank Just north of
the Prebla station It Is operated with a lever
at the end of which is a big Iron ball The lock
and chain of tho switch were broken and tho
switch plugged open with a bar of Iron about
four feet long with a fork at each end
which had been secured from a neighboring
hue of scrap Iron The switch lover was raised
ono of the forks of the bar planed under I and
a chart piece of plank braced behind the bar to
snake tliii work of the wreckers sur Seven
freight carr stood on the switch tracks
The first notification the passengers bad that
anything was wrong was the trembling of the
train A the air brakes were set hArd Two car
lengths further ahead tho collision occurred
The engine was completely wrecked beyond all
repair torn all to pieces and turned on Its left
side and Its nose ploughed a hole in the ground
five feet deep
Two freight cars were smashed to pieces and
several other were driven down the track The
express car turned off to tho let the body rest
ing on the engine tender the baggage car
turned to the right and was partly upset The
smoker and day coach were derailed but were
not overturned Tho sleeper did not leave tbo
rails
Fireman Webster Rofe40 year old ofSyrocuse
a mArIe man with four children was found
beside the engine under the wreckage
bide enllne Be badly
scalded tie was taken out alive after an hours
work but he died on the way to Cortland at 4
oclock this morning
morl
Engineer Dickey Mountt of Syracuse 35
year old unmarried could not b found until
630 oclock this morning when he was dis
covered at the mouth of the firebox His bead I
arms and one lee I had been burned off Tbo
flesh A still burning so that water had to b I
poured on the body to extinguish the fire before
It could b removed
Th engineers watch was found to hare
topped at 1105 oclock None or the forty
passengers was hurt but all were badly shaken
penier all got out of the train safely with
their hAd baggage The baggage and mall was
all saved from the baggage car and about half
if the scenery of the theatrical troupe was saved
AYhimrrck tqotflre fiwca the trup and every I
Mtof the woodwork of the eocme and four can
> er o burned up clean The sleeper had been
trtnched from the train and was backed from
the burning wreck ana saved A storehouse
tutalnlnc abut 400 barrels e apples which
I nod beside the track caught fire from the cars
tod was also burned
All day today Sheriff Hlllstnger of Cortland
with Detective Sevenoaks of the railroad nnd a
pse of deputies have been scouring the coun
try for miles around the scene of tho wreck In
the afternoon Detective OBrien of the Syracuse
police force was called to their assistance Im
portant clues have been developed and three
suspicious characters devolop
A short distance from the Preblo station runs
a creek which Is one of the tributaries of the
TloBbnloga River On tbe banks of this creek
about quarter of a mile from tbe station Is a
settlement of Italians who are employed as sec
tion hands on the road These Italians when
questioned by the detectives today said that
the lights were all out In tbe camp and every
body was asleep when the wreck occurred
They were awakened by tho crash on hearing
which ttiey were aware that a wreck bad taken
Place and hurried t the scene Villagers who
were about the station and at other points from
n hlch the settlement Is visible say that this is
not true and that Just before and at the time of
the wreck llehts were plainly seen at the settle
m nt as well as forms of men moving about
among the shanties in which the Italians lodge
It Is I not apparent whether the denial of the
Italians that any of them were about at the
time of the wreck was made through fear of be
mlo b
log Implicated In a crime of which they wero
rot cullty or whether the guilty parties were
prie
members of their gang Their denial Certainly
certinly
looks suspicious Inna
Uctectho Sevenoaks evidently has suspicions
Ji tit the guilty parties are known to the Italians
W though they are not known to hove had any
I grievance against the road or any of Its bands
Tho wreck was evidently the work of revenge
or wantonness as plunder would have been Im
practicable at a point so near tho station and
Tillage of Treble
At 3 1 oclock this afternoon Deputy Sheriff
William bherley of the village of Homer who
ha I been Investigating In the vicinity of Sum
mit station about ten miles north of Pre hie
went Into the station to send a message to De
tective Bevrnoaks at treble mesale t was
there an unknown man suddenly appeared on
the platform Where he had come from no one
knew The fellow a unknown nt hummlt
viously and had not been seen about the tummlt pr
Although I was raining hard outside the fel
lows clothing was quite dry and be had no ap
pearanco of having been out of doors Whether
lie had been concealed beneath the platform or
thr water tank was of course only conjectured
lint inking everything Into consideration the
circumstance was regarded suspicious enough
I A to warrant Investigation enoulb
J The man when approached claimed to be un
able to understand or spruk any English and
talked with a broken German dialect Ito was
cat under arrest by Sheriff Sherley and up to
this time has persistently refused to give his
name He Is I about 28 years old six feet tall hi
dark complexionnnd weighs about 100 pounds
He had hardly been put under arrest when
another stranger came Into the station This
fellow also refused t talk and acted suspicious
h His clothes were damp but not as wet as a
few minutes exposure to the rain then falling a
would warrant He It I about 22 years old fallna
6 feet and 8 Inches In height and weighs In the
b neighborhood of 1US pounds
He was arrested by Sheriff Sherley who then
I telegraphed to Detective HcvenoaKsat Ireble
The detective wont tn Summit and law the
men but could get nothlngoutof them They
were held however to await developments It
I Is tho belief nt Sheriff Sherley that these I
hod something to do with the wreck and wero
uniting around Summit to Jump freight and
come into Syracuse undetected anl
An Italian known as Mike was arrested
this afternoon by Detective OBrien Like the II
other turn arrested he claimed t speak no I
English and answered questions put to him
with a vacant stare Detective OBrien helloes
that Mike knows more than he will tell about
wi abut
lel
tho wreck and thinks he has a clue to incrimi
eating evidence
The bodies of EnglneerG Young and Fireman
Webster Roof were viewed by a Coroners Jury
at Treble this afternoon both tho bodies have

been brought t this city

RRAZIL AND FRENCH G VIA ft A
The Onlnep Star Take Arm to End the

OronotrrowN British Guiana Nov InThe
latest advices from the contested territory b
tween Brazil and French Guiana report tbat
Vlega Cabral the autocratic ruler of Connanl
Carsevenne nnd Inpn continues his hostilities
toward all French subjects and has now num
ber of them in captivity
It Is I now said that Mr Evariste who piloted
the French gunboat Bengali to Amapa and who
w ns reported to have been burned a tho stake
by order of Cabral did not die Cabral gave the
order for his execution He was tied to a stake
the wood was lighted and he became uncon
scious from his torture giving rise to the state
ment that he had perished I appears how
ever that when h lost consciousness Cabral
ordered the flrequenchcd aol efforts were made
to restore Evariste These efforts were success
ful and Evarbte was committed t prison Ho
Wl afterward subjected to further Inhuman
treatment after which ho a again locked up
The situation I most critical and tho belief is I
that the lives of French subject will be seri
ously Imperilled If the Government does not
take steps to occupy the whole of these regions
rlions
or at least to break the power of CabraL l
CabrU 1 TStl SKVfe up tb territory nor
abandon his claims without having recourse to
arms He ha required the inhabitant t con
struct entrenchments and camps and he has
procured a machine t launch torpedoes In
this way he hopes to secure tho river against
the passage of ships of war rver
Cabral could not obtain his Implementsof
war without outside assistance and It Is said ho I
readily obtains these from Para and for that
and oilier reasons it I not doubted that Cabral I
I acting with the assistance of the Government
of Paa It Is known that Cabral has recruited
men at Para in great numbers that he has
bought arms there has travelled to and from
Para unmolested and Is In the habit of Inter
viewing there men of local authority and officers
of high rank In the Brazilian army
It is now impossible for French colonists to
settle within the territory ruled by Cabral and

WOK established by philanthropic men just
eighteen months ago with 1 capital of 100000
autwcrlbed by alo Later that capital was in
creased 8100000 ly thu sale of bonds Interest
has been paid on these bonds but no dividend
ha ben paid on the original capital The ob
I ject of the establishment was to enable persons
who needed money to obtain it at a moderato interest
neee moerato
I wrest The regular pawn shops charged 10 per
cent The rate hero was fixed at one per
I rent n month Since the shop opened we have
accommodated 33000 people in loans In nmonntfl
less ttmn 8100 All toll we nine loaned S550
000 Of this about 8M0000 has been returned
with the Interest Tho average loan has been
about Slit The maximum period of each loan
hone year Lost May the year was up for the

deemed So in Jnne and July Early Irt August
we sent t each of the persons who had not re

them tbat tho time was up and the loan wu
called but xvould be renewed upon tho pay

stand until the fain Is I over As to what tho
profits of the business have been I cannot say
frolt al the loans we have mail were of sums

listened to n lone denunciation of his libertin
ism until ho was suddenly told that of the
charge before the Court ho was Droved Inno
cent
1
In the Unlit of yesterdays event time trial li
shown to have been a most remarkable one
Circumstances appeared to bo against tho ao
cased His life waa shown to have been a
shameful one From the first the jury wo Im
pressed unfavorably by him and favorably to
ward his accuser who told her story so straight
forwardly and stuck to It so unswervingly un
der croMexnmlnntlon Then came the Re
corders chare1 not the least remarkable tea
tune of the trial It was strongly against
the prisoner no strongly that It seemed to
many who heard It to be almost n direction to
convict It Is hardly conceivable that without
some such obvious guidance on the Judges part
a jury could determine In an hour n case where
in there was so much contradictory evidence as
In this one Vet the Lancerman Jury occupied
only otic hour In deciding the prisoner to bo
guilty That Recorder Goff felt the necessity of
some defence of the Jury was shown yesterday
for at the vary outset of his address to the pris
oner he declared that to any Impartial mind It u
must bo clear that the Jury were absolutely
warranted and Justified In finding ngalnst you
the verdict they found Later in what might
appear to come as a veiled attempt at Justifica
tion of till own course In the trial ho says
I doubt If there has occurred a case In ths >
history of criminal Jurisprudence In this or any
other country to equal this
The complaint briefly was that Miss Anb
went to Lnngermnns apartments as a book
agent on May 7 bearing a note from a Mrs no
Belle who knew Lancerman that Langermon
despite her struggles assaulted her and that
after determining to commit suicide ahBrecon
sidered and told of the assault to her friend
Miss Smedlcy who persuaded her to make a
complaint against Langrrman On being ar
rested he admitted his relations with the girl
bnt denied that he had used force Before the
case came to trial Dr Edward M Barnettewho
had made a physical examination of the girl
died and what was presented as his dying state
ment by the defetico wan ruled out by Recorder
Ooff In his charge tho Recorder dwelt at
length upon the evidence of the police surgeon
who also had examined Miss Aub and who tes
tified to bruises upon her person He dwelt
also upon Miss Aubs good character lie said
In the course of his charge
You have seen Barbara tub on the witness
stand for five hours undergoing a long and
severe cressexamination and yon have nb t
served her apparently unruffled demeanor and
I particularly chirgo you to consider her nets
her conduct and her motive What had the
woman to gain by making this charge and sub
jecting herself to the shame and humiliation of
telling tht story to the world for Instance In
suffering five hours agony on the witness
stand Why should she publish herself to time
world as being befouled and debauched 7 5
It Is also proper for the Jury tn ask and answer
this question If what the defendant says Is
true and Ilnrbarn Anb consented to his em
braces how did those briilws come upon her
body
The full text of the charge cannot be obtained
at present It has to bo written out for ice
Recorder and examined by him before It goes f
Into the records
hortoN FOB X NEW TIUAt DENIED
When Langcrman was convicted It wan gen
erally supposed In view of the attitude of thee
Recorder that his sentence would ben severe
one Ho was to have been sentenced on Friday
but Recorder Ooff postponed the sentencing un
til Monday Why ho did so was a matter of i
speculation then Now It Is known that In the
Interval ho was considering Barbara Aubs con
fession and endeavoring to determine upon his
own course The court room was crowded yes
terday with people who exoected to hear Lan >
german sentenced to fifteen or twenty years in
State prison It Is probable that be expected
this himself for he looked pale and shaken as
he was brought Into the court room Judge
Allison and Recorded Gift were on the bench
the Recorder sitting merely to Impose sentence
Bring Langerman up to tbe bar ordered
and the prisoner took his place facing the Re
corder
Walter L 8 Langerman said Clerk Penny
what have you to say why the sentence of the
court should not be pronounced upon you
Your Honor put In Lawyer flame stepping
forward I herewith submit in writing the
motions for a new trial and arrest of Judgment
which I made last Friday
I deny both motions said Recorder Ooff
Lawyer hairs then mode a brief speech telling
of his clients sufferings
He can suffer no greater humiliation than
he has already undergone said the lawyer
I believe the time will rome when not only ha
public but this honorable court will be con
vinced that this conviction was a mistake
Is that all P asked the Recorder
It Is sir except that I hnvo reason tobellev
F
that If this sentence Is deferred for two weeks I
will be able to present such evidence that your
Honor will grant a new trial I cannot say this
certainly but I believe It Is I so
Again the Recorder asked If that was all and
thlt time the lawyer answered In the affirm
tire Then Recorder Ooff turned to Langennan
jury MXTUMKH TUB IMIIMIKEII
At this time It Is mid nobody In court except
the Recorder mind the prisoner knew of the pris
oners Innocence of tho charge Langerman
stood there hit fare net to the ordeal he was to
go through Thrro words ly the Recorder
would have relieved the strain upon him but
thote nordi did not mint until the man at the
bar had Mood AS n target fur denunciations that
would havo been bitter even If directed at a
criminal Onilng after these word the
declaration of Unnrrnmnt Innocence fell upon
the court room like u thunder chin If the
Recorder designed imit speech for dramatlo
effect certainly achieved his end frtumph
astir Nothing more drtmatlo was ever dMs
