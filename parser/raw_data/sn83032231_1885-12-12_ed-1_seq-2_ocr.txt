There is an important piece of untln-
isueu Dimness Willi .Mexico, u., tne
legislation needed to carry into execu
tion the commercial treaty with that
country. Tho message recommends the
nassaito of tho necessary acts of Con
gress, but Congress Is fairly veil aware
that there Is not much of a concern on
the uubilc mind about that matter, and
therefore It need not bo in ony.,pe(jlfll

the subject of further negotiation, with
a iew to overcoming American objec
tions. A few little unpleasantnesses
exist with Tuikey. Theydonotthreatei

probably bring I hem to a satisfactory

foreign relation It Is to be regretted;
out tins part ot me message is too long
to go back to look.
The inadequacy of existing American
k-glilation touching the Important
matteis of naturalization, expatriation
and kindred subjects, Including the
rights of aliens domiciled in tho United
alalej, especially when the domiciled
alien lias declared his Intention to
become a citizen need further statutory
attention. Tho commercial relations of
tho United States with our immediate
neighbors, and with important areas of
rraiiic near our snores, suggest especially
liberal intcrcoitso between them and us;
but the President is manifestly not In
favor of making them so liberal as to
give them the free run of tho trade of
ntty-iivo millions of people, for a slim
chance at the trade of a few hundred
thousands or even a few millions, as in
tho case3 ot Cuba, Porto, Rico, Santo
Domingo, Ac. The diplomatic anil

President, ousht to bo recast. Ho sug
gests improvements also, and among
mest: uro inu appointment ot a numuer
of Secretaries of Legation at large, who
might be quite useful on occasion, and
a detail of ollicers from the army and
navy as attaches.
Speaking of the surplus revenue, the
message gets upon the tariff. In his
view of It the revision of the customs
reu'iiuo laws does not Involve the ques
tion of free trade, and then goos on to
say: "Justice and fairness dictate that,
In any modification of our present laws
and In which our citizens have largo In
vestments, should not b.- ruthlessly
injured or destroyed. Wo should also
deal w Ith the subject in such a manner
as to protect the interests of the Ameri
can labor, which is tho capital of our
working men; Its stability and proper
remuner.iton furnish the most justitla
blo pretext for a protective policy."
That Is reasonable and sound. He
then continues: "Within these limita
tions a certain reduction should be made
in our customs revenue;" and
l iiiniK tlic reduction should be made
in tho revenue derived from a tax on
the iuioortcd necessaries of life. Wo
tints directly lessen the cost of living In
every family In the laud, and release to
the people In every humble home a
larger measure of the rewards of frugal
Industry."
This would havo been clearer if tho
necessities referred to had been speci-
jiett. iis it, is we are leu to guess. Tliey
probably Include sugar and woollen
goods. Tho President seems to con
sider a reduction of duties as n sure
road to a reliction of revenue and sur
plus. That Is aMorrijonlau idea, which
everybody should regret to find stiiu'Sil
by the President. A reduction of duties
may bo a surer road to an Increase of
surplus. On the subject of stopplngtho
cmuaye ot tne jJiauil sliver dollar Mr.
Cleveland is very clear, strong and

.rfyhit rpiiotlSforccttahi evils In our
Indian itltalr.s tho President inakos this
recommendation, which we do best to
quote In his own language full and
veibatim: "I recommend the passage
of a law authorizing the appointment
of.slx commissioners, three ot whuin
shall bo detailed from the army, to
bo charged with tho duty of a careful
Itmieclton, from time to time, of all the
Indians upon our reservations or sub
ject to tho caro and control of the (5ov
erninetit, with a view of discovering
their cxafct condition and needs, nnd
determining what steps shall bo taken
on behalf of the Government toiluprovo
their situation in the direction of their
self-support and complete civilization;
that they ascertain from su;h Inspection
what, If any, of thorescivatlons may be
l educed iu area, and In such cases what
part not needed for Indian occupation
may be purchased by the (overnment
from tho Indians and disposed of for
their benefit; what, If any, Indians may,
with their consent, bo removed toother
reservations, with a view of their con
centration and tho sale on their behalf
of tltblr abandoned reservations; what
Indian lands now held In common
should bo allotted In severalty; Iu what
manner and to what extent tho Indians
upon tho reservations can bo placed
under the protection of our laws nnd
subjected to their penalties, and which,
If any, Indians should be Invested with
the light of citizenship."
This contemplates but n preliminary
step; but probably it is an essential step
before any material advance In the right
direction can be made.
The public lauds should be held faith
fully according to tho constitutional
prescription for ''the common benefit,"
and no longer squandered or permitted
to be plundered, and there should bo no
relaxation or let up In tno prosecution
and enforcement of tho present laws
against polygamy.
We havo now taken a reviewing glance,
wo believe, at every material recom
mendation in tho message except that
relating to the reform of tho civil ser
vice. The President's position upon
this interesting as well as important
subject can bo host understood by con
sulting that part of the document. We
must, say, however, that be stands
firmly by his past declaration of princi
ple In the matter; while he says that
civil service rules will not prevent tho
discharge of tho Indolent or incom
petent clerk, they will prevent the tilling
of his place bv the unlit party worker;
and ho ventures tho hope that wo shall
never again bo remitted to the system
which distributes public positions purely
as the rewards of party service. .

Special to the Caiiiio.vAdvocati:.
Wc aro now In tho height of tho fash

the consolations of this joyous season,is
tlio fact, that for a time at least: If not
forever, wo have got rid of that Insuffer

musical nuisance, Colonel Mapleson of
Her Majesty's Opera. Wc have had
many musical and dramatic aflllctlons,
but nothing that would compare with
this blatant braggart. Season after
season ho has been promising what he
wai going to do, and season after season
tbo public hayo been disappointed.
Nothing but the competition of Mr.
Abbey Induced Mapleson to engage
Pattl. Pattl who know her man, mid
who Is one of tho gteat singers that
never get left; tied -Mapleson up with
an iron-clad engagement compelling
h!m to put up $20,000 to remain as fc
curlty for her last four niahts ho pay
lug her $5000 a night for fifty night's
engagement. Tlio rivalry between the
Now Metropolitan Opera Uouso and tho
Old Academy of Music was exceedingly
bitter, and was ruinous to both. The
Academy's backci-3 were represented
among the Astors and Goelets, and half
the solid men of Wall Street. Tho
Metropolitan Opera House received aid
and comfort front tho Goulds, the Van-
tletbllts, and donty of other capitalists,
whose bank accounts aro good for mil
lions, and when they go In for their
pleasures, never stop (o count the cost.
It was a light of blue blood against
ducats, and ducats won though tlio blue
blood had plenty of gilded backing. The
Metropolitan Opeia House was fortun
ate lit its manager; ilr. Abbey was a
man who had a most sacred idea of en
gagements, and who as far as krown
had never knowingly broken one. He
had nerves of steel, and all the qualities

that both manacers wcn ruined, anil
the only persons who profiled by the
rivalry were tho costly singers, who
were engaged at exorbitant salaries
ranging irom siouu to $5000 a night.
Abbey paid every dollar of his debts,
but had sunk a clear hundred thousand
In tho venture; Mapleson had disbursed
a heap of other people's money, and
came out oulnc everybody, ami ftnnllv

manner of his Inglorious exit, that wo
had seen tlie last of hlin, but he turned
up this season, smlllngaud as impudent
a uver. lie had now no opposition in
Italian Opera, and suppofcd that he
like Robinson Crusoe was 11101101011 of
all he surveyed, but a new opera had
sprung up, the effect of which ho never
dreamed, and that was tho German
Opera. For tho last ten years Theo
dore Thomas lias been educating us In
Wagner. Die Walkure Taimenliauser,
Lohengrin and The Flying Dutchman,
havo bccji sapping the foundations of
Lucia de Latamermore, Norma, Trova
toro nnd Traviata. The late Doctor
Datnarosch was among the first to grasp
tlio situation, anil he persuaded tho
Metropolitan directors to allow 1dm to
organize a German Opera Coiujiany,
Tlie doctor besides being a great musi
cian was a perfect duvoteo of his art;
with a grant of unlimited" power no
vvouder that he brought together such a
company as this country had never seen
before. Wc havo had great Individual
artists hut no such ensemble, and our
people awakened to the fact that Ital

music of the world.
The esiierimont which lesttlted in the
successful transplanting to the Ameri

and tho result is perfectly satisfactory.
And wr. have got rid of Mapleson.
Kvcryliody Is delighted at tho prospect
of teeing him no more. We would
glory in nn Opera of Choctaw or Fegeo
rnthor than another doso of Italian
Opurn administered by Colonel Maple
son of Iter Majesty's.
A dreadful shock to Now York was
the arrt'st of General Alexander Shaler
for bribery. Gon. Shnlcr has been a
top-sawyer In tho National Guard for
twenty-five yean, and as ho walked the
streets ho looked right over tbo bends
of other men. The humbloRtouc-cutler
of thirty years ago was lost hlght of In
tho military hero who won his spurs on
the hardest battle-fields of the Rebellion,
and stood at tho head of tho National
Guard of a State that had given nearly
half a million of men to the defence of
the V11I011, Ho received the emolu
ments of a dozen offices, and It Is now
asserted that ho sold himself and his
high olllee for a paltry $0,000. The un
earthing of this matter is brought about
by a duel which Is now going on be
tween two factions of the Democratic
tmtty, each of which appears Intent on
destroying tho other. Mayor lidlsoir
helped to make Gen. Shaler President
of the Hoard of Ilenlth just previous to
his retirement. Gen. Shaler Is a Re
publican, and tho appointment gave
mortal offence to tlio Democrats, and to
no one more than the Incoming Mnyor
Grace, who wanted the place for one of
his own henchmen. Mayor Grace had
hardly got warm In his scat, when tho
war 011 Shaler commenced. Shaler's
friends retorted by calling attention to
Mayor Graco's connection witli Ferdi
nand Ward. The World threw Its tre
mendous Influence against Mayor Grace
and published the transcript of his pro
fits of $140,000. All this has resulted
In n deadly hatred and bitterness, which
will not bo satisfied short of tho des
truction of ono party or the other. Tho
position of General Shaler Is not an en
viable one. Ills rather overbearing
manner, and his tendency to look down
on cvoijbody he considered beneath
him (and that was about nineteen
twentieths of tlio community), has
caused him to bo heartily hated by most
of his subordinates, and there aie few to
grievo, outside of his own Immediate
family, and many to rejolcont hlsdown
fall. He was ono of a considerable
number of men In tlieso United Slates
who found It difficult to forget that the
war Is over; ho broujht tils military
habits back Into civil life, and seemed
to think that citizens who wero every
way his equal, and many of them his
superior, should pay hint tlio same def
erence that a private soldier would have
to pay him at tho head of his brigade.
For tlie honor of the city It is to be
hoped that Gen. Shaler may bo able to
clear his character of the charges made
by the. broker Wilson, For if it shall bo
proven that a man of such high charac
ter, and enjoy Ing such public trttsts.can
bo bought for such a paltry bribe, then
where can wc Iook for honesty".'
If the U'oi-W Is to bo believed, the
character of ourMayor Is not untainted.
It may be that another popular uprising
may bo necessary, like that which sent
Tweed to thcPenltcntiaiyand Connolly
and Sweeney in'o exile. Hew to the
line, 110 matter who is lilt, and where
the offence is, there let tho great axe
fall.
Our sister city, Hrooklyn, Is greatly
exercised about a wild man of the sea,
which, If tho story Is to bo believed,
would 3how that tho mermen of the sea
are not all dead. For ten days past a
man has been seen on Coney Island
beach, disporting himself in the briny
waves as If they were his native ele
ment. Tho hair on I1I3 head reaches to
his waist, and the yellow hair on his
body Is as long as a hotso's inane.
Many people have seen him at night
walking along the sand, but as soon as
he was approached ho dashed into tlio
breakers, and no one has seen hi m come
out. Hut lhat he does come out is evi
dent, for ho has been seen by many,
men and women. Towards night men
go armed with hatchets and clubs for
fear the wild man might grab lliein up
and carry them into tho sea. Women
and children keep close Indoors, and a
reign of terror of this submarine hairy
man lias shaken Now York's favorite

There is a rapid and remarkable
cliaugo going on in tlio two cities of
Now York and Hrooklyn. Ten years
ago the permits lo build were about a
thousand; iu 1885 they were nearly five
thousand, and the amount of money
employed in building about thirteen
millions of dollars. At that time I
wtoto that forty thousand people daily
crossed over tho different ferries. Now
one hundred and seventy thousand cross
daily on the bridge and ferry boats, and
tho street cars of Hrooklyn carried Iu
the year over fifty-six millions of peoplu
more people than there aro inhabi
tants of the United States. HtTorts are
made from time to time to have tlie two
cities under one municipality; but tho

Washington. D. C, Dec. 5, 'P5
Roth branches of Congress promise to
open next Monday and for the lust timo
for months the hotel corridors were
crowded last night with members of
Congress and strangers, and a little of
the usual excitement preceding the open
ing of Congress was apparent. There
Is manifested the greatest uncertainty
among members as to their attitude
with regard (0 the important matters
that will come up to be settled durin:
theseslon. All the doubt hangs around
the House. The Senate, It is thought,
.can bo depended on to take conservative
action upon most of the Important mat
ters. Jetubers generally appear to bo
at sea and aro reluctant to commit
themselves upon any proposition. There
are a hundred and thirty new members
ejected to tlio House, many of whom are
without experience. They arc just
starting out on very uncertain ground
and don't know just." what attitude lo
assume. The chief consideration before
many of them Is how they can conduct
themselves during their first term so as
to assure them of a second, and there Is
consequently much uncertainty and
hesitation 111 tltolr course, nicy will
be called iniou the first tlilnit lo discuss
and amend rules they have never seen
111 operation, and to act iiin mallei s
they have no exiierleuce with. TIihv
refrain irom expressing their opinion
ill m any 01 me leaning subjects, but
withuld their decision until they can
find something to guide them as to their
course ol ai lioil. lue two tlilis tlutt
lUcj stri.i to lia kotiin dnfhiitu idea
about are that the rules should be
changed iu some way, and that there

Is believed, will naturally be Inclined to
follow tho recommendations of tho
President and keep hi with the adminis

, Tho anfo-room of the White Howe
has been given a very Democratic look
by the display there of a new full-length
portrait of Thomas Jefferson. This Is
a picture by Mr. U. F. Andrews, the ar
tist who painted tho picture of Martha
Washington now hanging In the East
room of this same building, Mr. An
drews Is now In Ohio, engaged In paint
ing the portialt of Gov. lloadly. Tho
portrait of Jefferson, as ho is represent
ed in tills picture, Is a very striking one.
The father of the Democratic parly Is
dressed Iu a costume which must fairly
paralyze the stralglitout Hourbons from
the far West.
As an aid to his project of bringing
Into close relationship tlie Agricultural
Department and the various agricultur
al schools and colleges nnd Stato experi
ment stations, Commissioner Column
has commissioned Henry 11. Alvord, n
well-known agriculturist of Mottntaiu
vllle, N. , to mains a list of all tho ag
ricultural, experiment stations of the
country cast of tho Mississippi rlvcr.and
to investigate and report upon each
station. It Is expected that llio knowl
edge thus obtained of tlio work done at
each experiment Btation will be of great
help in formulating .1 plan by which tho
whole may bo united into a system by
which each may work in concert with
the others, and the results of their ex
periments bo so unified as to bo of much
mora value than at present. There Is
now no concerted action between these
State luslilutlous, and a half dozen may
be engaged iu the saiuo lino of Investi
gation at the same time. Commissioner
Colman t'.iinksthat a scheme might be
devised by whHi such duplications
would bo avoided and better results
reached In a shorter time. If each sta
tion worked In harmony with the others
nnd all were closely connected with the
Department of Agriculture.

The formation of an Anthracite Coal
