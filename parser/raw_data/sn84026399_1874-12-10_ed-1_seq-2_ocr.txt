THURSDAY. DECEMBER 10. 187-1.
The New York Herald, for a couple of
vtseks back, has been indu'simr considerably
. fi the crime, poverty, and suffering iu and
aroun i Sjr&cton and the coal regions general
ly, lis diatribes were most harrowing and
horrifying. Murders ware frequent, crime
f lesser decree ruu riot, and suffering even
t.) starvation and eonserjuent dath were
miitcra so common that t hoy had come to
i.3 tanked upon aj natters cf course. And
the arnica were so ?fraicht!y told that it was
almost impossible to disbelieve them, more
especially an a prominent newspaper of
that city of marvellous growth, gigantic
iiterpnzs and icajraiueent palaces rather
not only winked at the Heralds stone, but
. actually pronounced them true.
Having a little bunines.! in that locality,
took occasion on Thursday list to visit
the 'third City of the State,'-' and remained
there until Friday afternoon, and during the
time give the city and its adjuncts a pretty
thorough going over. Of the general pover
ty of the city th great amount cf suffering
spoken of we saw no particular evidence.
We visited the place early ia the spring and
summer, a ui of course, by comparison,
couM note any difference between then and
io. Then nearly ail the great interests
were idle, but vrc failed to find any reason
lor sutTerir g as a general thing. ludeed our
impression, from what we saw, was that
there was thrift in Scranton, even with its
lorccd idleness, and that the saving habits of
th? peoj ta had secured the means to enable
them to weather ever tlie panic pinch in coai
l'.rt and comparative plenty. JSTow we found
its rolling mi'ls and c-thcr great enterprizes
in partial, if not ia full blast, and everything
t-h jwing that there was really something
limg which would stop the leak ia the sav
ing?, and llnd the bread and comforts of each
day by means of the labors of each day. But
wre found too that there is S'juali.d poverty and
.sufferii: in Scranton. No one can doubt
-he fact who observingly passes through its
rtrects.
It cannot be otherwise in a city whose
$.ri5ripal thoroughfares and avenues are lined
wi:h gin-mi!!, beer shops and pestiferous
hell dives. These must be supported to live,
i-.rxl as they do live and receive their support
.from a class whose earnings are sadly circuru
s.vUei by tue depraved appetites, which
leads them to extend that support, it cannot
Lif. otherwise than that those who should be
i'Le fond ones at home too often suffer the
;pangs of Leglcct, disease, starvation and even
death itself, that beer and liquid damnation
l-iiv be cuzs'ed ad libitum. There must be
y cue thirty odd of these li juor selling vam
5n: ricst? on LacLawanna Avenue alone, and
ihfse are but a tithe of all that exist ia the
vify. Cypher up, in high rents and the
l:uit: of the keepers, the cost of maintaining
these white 1 sepulchres, and then thick that
the money ail comes from the one to three
l".!:ir laborers and mechanics, and if you can
i.-k for anything else than suffering and
:n.t among this particular branch of these
claves, you ir.!it be giflcd
with a marvel-
l:is credulity lulled.
rr ! cr r
i'crantoniau's poor i-j r.ot, then-fore, for want
'f w?rk for work h to be had, and a dollar
judiciously spent will go a great ways in the
purchase cf the means to sustain life but it
jies ia the sin of the beer and lienor drinker,
itud ia the greater sin of the almoners of the
l-iw the Courts, the Mayer, the Aldermen,
(the Police and the better to do citizens, who
permit these eoul destroying pest shops to
i-il't and thrive with impunity. But these
all wink at the evil, because the pest house
keepers are the politicians ef iuSuencc, and
t-o interfere with their nefarious trade would
fce to incur the loss of hope for advancement
in the questionable honor3 of municipal life.
And are these honor? questionable? One
cannot think otherwise when one comes to
think of Scran to a in its government, after
lor king at the cause cfthe suffering of its
por. We do not know but that after all its
u Soring estate is its best estate compared
with its municipal estate. It has industry,
it has thrift, it his enterprise and it has
wealth, but here the list of its virtues end.
According to the ?peoch of it3 city council
men it? policemen are but waiking beer bar
rels and whikey tubs mere protectors of
loons and frequenters of bagnios. Its Chief
of Police is under $5,000 bond3 on charge of
murder; its Mayor walk? the streets bonded
in $500 to appear at any time to answer the
t barge of perjury; its school beard is under
arrest and bond, or scudding around to avoid
sirrcst, on charge of conspiring to rob itself
and the tax-payers of some eight or nine thous
and dollars cf school money; its hightoned
specimens cf honesty and Christianity meet
to concoct measures to reform the city gen
t tally, and its papers charge even these with
crimes, ia the same direction, fully as black,
if not more so. 23 those which they attempt
to re.orm. irmy save in its magniucent
enterprises, and its outside show cf thrift,
inwardly Scranton must be a very Soddom
and Cromcrrah among the ckie3 of the earth.
In view of recent developments we cannot
ay that the Herald was cutofthe way when
it spoke of Scran ton's crimes and suffering.
It ha really proved to l a real picture
drawn from i;fo Our real therefore as a
defender is quenched by the startling eviden
ces of truth which meet U3 on all iides, and
it is but left us to cease a'ondering that earth
quake shocks are felt there, that mines settle
and houses are wrecked, that epidemics pre-
vsil and murders run riot, for the gins cf
theeityare enough to damn it a hundred
foid more greviously.
It is with more than a common feeling of
i y that we aspirate our tlvaukfulaess that

553 Our distinguished neighbor over the
way, did himself infinite credit last week, by
his terrible onslaught on vice and crime, in
t he shape of the rowdyism of the week be
fore. It is his first essay in that direction.
Heriously, and hence we feel that he deserves
heartfelt congratulations over the able man
uer in which he acquitted himself ; and, all
the more so, because the conduct which lie
condemned was but the actud, natural.
eff ervescent finale of the great Democratic
pole raising at Brodhcadsvillo. In this latter
view of the matter one cannot, well do other
wise than believe that the millenium is close
at hand. When a Democratic editor, even
so distinguished a character as our neighbor,
determines' to speak "right out in uieetin,"
in condemnation of the men and usuages of
his party, the millenium theory is the only
theory on which his conduct can be accoun
ted for.
TI5E PRESIDENTS xTIESSAGE.
The Presidents Message which was sent to
Congress on Monday, is a state paper with
which, we think, no man, no matter what
his polites, should find fault. If there is
partizan fault to bo found with it wo think
the Republicans have, by long odds, the best
right in that direction. It is true, that when
speaking of the inclination of the southern
negro to republicanism, there is aa apparent
leaning towards the party which elected him,
but the end of his suggestions, which seem
to be the animus of the whole, he outs with
the plain truth in the insinuation that a plain
square treatment of the situation must lead
to the aboliton of color, and even, to the
decision of our political couUsfc on principle
alone. We do not know, at this time of
writing, what view our distinguished neigh
bor over the way will take of the message;
but this we do know that if he treats it
squarely and fairly, he will speak of it as being
more in accord with the results of the reeeut
election, than with the resolves and labors of
Republican Convention for a year or two
baJk.
Unlike the messages of former Presidents,
and ualike President Grant himself, this
message leaves thaukfulness, and all that sort
of thing, to occupy a secondary place. The
present, and the financial dificuities under
which we suffer are the first consideration.
And here the President's ideas are whole
some and to the point. Much speculation,
aided by a fluctuating currency has left us in
debt, and the sooner we get out of this, by a
resumption of the gold and silver basis ia our
business transactions, the sooner we wi'i be
oa the right road to prosperity and happi
ness. There is no fighting around the bush
iu this respect, and the financial and business
precepts, in the good Jackson and Benton
times were not more, forcibly expressed than
are the views of Genera! Grant, in thesameline
to-d;
No da is named in which the re
supjption of specie payments shall take place,
but the idea, and at an early day, is enforced;
and we think, even Democracy thinks, that
the sooner the Presidents idea can be enforc
ed the better it will le all around. The
President doubtless sees that with an exclu
sive paper monetary basis we are always
liable to a sudden and unexpected change in
values, and where this is the case the one
grand corner stone cf prosperity, solidity, is
absent.
In o::r relation with foreign powers, the
President points for our view the situation just
as it is. Some nations, as with Venezuela owes
us, and Congress should see to it that we are
paid. Spain too, is our debtor and accord
ing to Grant she too should pay. It is well
he thinks to consider the situation of these
countries, but it is not wc!l to wait always
because of the slowness of their motions.
The Cuban question is one, too, which is de
serving of more than ordinary attention, and
to this question the President turns his eye.
A seven years struggle, in his estimation,
without success in the suppression of a love
for liberty and a determination to win it is
enough to call the attention of other nations
to the true situation of affairs. Eyes cannot
be shut to the fact that the commerce of all
nations, and especially that of the United
States, which is the largest consumer of
Cuban products, suffers from the futi!e ef
forts of the mother country, and it may be
come necessary for other nations to interfere
for the suppression of the unnatural and un
just contest. Besides, ia the duties which
she .pays the United States contributes to the
support of the efforts of Spain against the
liberty of her oppressed colony, and that is
neither in accordance with our custom nor
our traditions. If Cougress fails to take the
hint certainly the President will not be to
blame if the liberty loving and desiring
Cubans are not recognized with ail the rights
of belligerents, and that, too, rght speedily.
In the Presidents view of the Southern
troubles, he is open, above board and manly
r T 1 a
lie deprecates the necessities of his action
towards the Southern States, but he finds the
law of Congress on the statute bocks, and he
has no choice, in view of his oath, but to
enforce them. He has his opinion of the
merits of the case and does not hesitate to
express them, and his conclusion fairly and
legitimately arrived at is, that there is lying
cn all sides when the truth would more cer
tainly and speedily settle all difficulties.
On the Indian policy the President has
but a single view to advance, and that is that
the peace policy is the correct policy. It has
not Lad all of fairness of trial that it deserves
but he is satisfied that the eui will v indicate
it from the aspersions heaped upon it.
The President briefly reviews the reports
of thfl fseysr&l departments of the Govern
ment, and commends them to the considera
tion of Congress.
lie again recommends the establishment
of court for the adjudication of the claims
of aliens, and suggests the passage of a law
defining the American doctrine of expatria
tion. He also points out tho difficulties ex
rrieiv?d by our ministers abroad growing;
out of frauds upon the naturalization policy,
and asks for such provision of law as wili
secure the honest seeker after naturalization
in all the rights desirable, while, at the same
time it will work against the machinations
of those, who having no lovo for us or our
principles of liberty, yet, through fraud foist
themselves upon us in order to "avoid a duty
which they owe, and, under the circumstan
ces should be compelled to pay to the land of
their birth and real choice.
In conclusion, we would say that the mcs
suace is one of the best State papers we
have read for years, and reflects crcdict not
only upon its author, but also on the whole
country and people.

Musical. Our East Stroudsburg friends
are running over with music. After having
attended the musical convention held in this
place recently, conducted by Prof. Perkins,
and also the school under his charge now in
progress, they have concluded to get up an
entertainment on their own hook, and to this
end have secured the efficient services of
Prof. A. N. Johnson, of Ohio, who will con
duet a musical convention at their place
commencing on the 15th instant, continuing
four days. This will afford a good opportun
ity for our musical folks to air their talent in
that direction, which we trust they will em
brace with alacrity. We believe this will be
the third time Prof. Johnson will have con
ducted a musical conventional EastStrouds
burg. The Prof, is said to be a gentleman
in the best sense of the word, is president of
several musical colleges and a graduate of
music both in Germany and this country,
and has an original system of imparting a
knowledge of music, rendering it exceedingly
entertaining and successful. He is also an
author of several musical works, which are
more or less known to the musical world.
Let all interested in this matter be sure to
put in an appearance.
What We heard and Saw within
the Week.
By request we will let "Dead and Bcauti
ful" rest. "Tippy" says "shoot the
gallery." We say no, "Tippy," let the
doves bill and coo as much as they please 00
their lofty perch, only so they don't tumble
out of their nest. It is something nnusal
for a young man to bathe the doorsteps with
a copious How of tears when parting with his
dear dulcina at night, but why 6ho should
get angry at his sudden overflow cf grief,
for the life of us we cannot see. Our high
ly esteemed friend "S ." thinks "Oofty"
might think of some occurrences quito as
amusing as the "pig stye." She thinks the
"dump nurse," "buckwheat cakes" or riding
in a railroad car, seated beside a lay of high
scent might interest htm. "Oofty" can you
explain. Our frieud Ella had an apple seed
on one eye and a quince seed on the other to
see which would accept for "better or bad."
Old quicce won the prize. Vive la quince.
Of course our friend in Hoboken was happy.
Who would'nt be. There is a little "bru
nette" down town that can scrub like a Molly
McGuire. 1 hat is not all, she can play on
tho piano with the grace and skill of a pro
fessional. Our "devil" says she is a jewel
and sparlcs without a handsome setting.
Yes, our dear friend in Binghamton, with the
golden tresses, we will taketwo "sugar plums"
if you can make it convenient to send them.

Scranton City Government.
Mr. Chapin spoke on the matter ns fel
lows : Gentleman :
The police question deserves at this
time more than a passing glance. To say
that it is rotten is but speaking of it in a
phase of respectability.
The law and ordinances arc all that
one could wish, but arc trampled upon with
utter impunity. In this respect the coun
cils arc not free from neglect. Indifference
in management and gross carelessness in
the discharge of duty seems to be the most
prominent feature of the city government.
In fact, it has been pronounced a farce.
We might almost accept the term it
would be just, though, to say that the
"thing" runs itself. It is a shame, Mr.
President, to bo compelled to say that
w hisk' and beer propels the police depart
ment. This city actually pays salaries
ranging from $75 to SloU per month to
enhance the wealth of keepers of whisky,
ale and beer. It is a fact known to all that
a large number of our police, including the
chief, make their loafing places in saloons
and hanging around bars, while in section
14, ordinance No. 2. it reads, it shall be
their duty to caution strangers and others
from going into places where idlers and
tipplers congregate. In stead of being on
duty, as the law requires, they are robbing
the city of its revenue, enhancing its crimes
by their idleness, and bringing disgrace up
on it by a laziness that i3 simply too con
temptible to speak of. My opinion, gen
tlemen, is. that the time ha3 come when
"beer" no longer should be our chief of
Police. If we cannot make a change, noth
ing but crime will be tho record of the city
of Scranton. How long has it been since
the knocking down and almost murdering
of two citizens at the foot of Fcna avenue.
Two policemen arrived before any of the
party dispersed. They made no arrests ;
told the ruffians to go home. These two
policemen should be discharged at once.
It is certainly required that a policeman
should be a temperate man. Section 3-4,
says policemen shall bo immediately dis
charged from office for intoxication while
on duty or for violent, coarse or insolent
language ; yet in the face of this, the testi
mony in tho Kearney trial is- that chief
Ferber was either drock or intoxicated ;
also that the most profane language was
used by him ; beside that of treating the
colored man on Sunday morning. We
shall endeavor to firvl who tho parties were
that sold them theso drinks on Sunday.
Yet, gentlemen, if this police force had
been sober, and attentive tc duty, wc verily
believe this murder eroaM aever have oc
curred. When the testimony of the wit
nesses in this case is that this party were
at Noll's, on Lackawanna avenue -r at John
Zeidler's ; at Lorenz Zeidlcr's ; through
centre street, and the whole length of Penn
avenue to Dickson's works, and that police
officers, including the chief, was in a num
ber of these places, and the damning testi
mony of his conduct, what else cordd we
expect. It seems that the fumes of incar
cerated poisons, secreted in the brain by
the deposit of draughts taken from the
fountains of hell, found no other outlet but
in the life's blood of Kearney. This poor
man was a quiet, inoffensive citizen. He,
in common with our great human family,
had hi3 weakness, probably in drink, but
he in common with us, expected and de
manded protection from cur authorities.
But in the hour of his greatest need our
keepers of pesce were under the control
of an element that was an instigator:
of the crime. Those of us who have not
yet fell by the hand cf u:o assassin, cr
been waylaid in cur public thorough
fares, cannot contemplate the thougi of
the dying Kearney, pummelled and kicked
by brutes of the worst passions, gathered
up like a loathsome animal, taken through
the heart of the cit in the hour of mid
night, thrown down an embankment an
hundred feet high and left for dea l, prob
ably returned to consciousness before death,
but not to strength ; laying alone through
tne aart nours or night with no one to
commune with but his God, and no watch
man but the stars above him, no doubt he
thought of the rottenness of our police
force. We say gentlemen if our police
were not directly implicated in this murder
they were indirectly.
Section 15 says, each police must be in
his conduct quiet, civil and orderly. Thank
God some arc so ; but if others are noth
ing but walking barrels of beer, how can
they keep order.
Again, Section 27 says, any policeman
who shall willfully maltreat or use violence
toward a prisoner, shall, on complaint be
ing made, be immediately discharged.
I would recommend that the Common
Council, acting in concurrence with the Se
lect, proceed to the trial of every police
man salaried, who has been remiss in dutv
and intemperate in habits, and, if found
guilty, to immediately discharge them.
Further , I would move an investigation
be held by this council for one of its"mem
bers being intoxicated and incarcerated in
our city prison.
Gentlemen, this monster must be
robbed of his power as far as the city
government is concerned. The councils
have not searched and sifted the characters
and habits of these candidates for police as
1 1 lit -
tney snouid. .len of intemperate habits,
for these posts of life's protection should
never be called into service. I ask why
not probe the malady at his core, aud let
the putrifaction escape ? We will then
see life restored and vigilance udou everv
side. Gentlemen, I shall hereafter en
deavor to ferrit out the lurking places of
mese sentinels ot peace, and shall not give
my support iu confirming a man for these
important posts of trust who in anv wav
loves his whisky and beer better than the
honor of the city.

Look Oat for Worthless Registered
Bond3.
Special Correspondence of Pittsburgh Com.
New York, Demcember 1, 1S74.
Some time ago the United States Se
cret Service were informed that there were
some United States Five-twenty bonds
afloat, were either counterfeits or else
genuine stolen bonds altered to prevent de
tection. Benson's force of the Sccrect Ser
vice here, were immediately on tho track,
and finally arrested at Philadelphia, one
George F Hilt alias Batcheldcr, late secre
tary of the defunct Safeguard Insurance
Company, and found in his possession a
plate for the manufacture of fifty cent Uni
ted States fractional currency, and some
$12,000 of Five-twenty bonds.
These bonds, instead of being counter
feit, arc genuine registered bonds of the is
sue of March 3, lSb3, and altered by eras
ing the names of the registered payees, as
well as the numbers, and renumbered and
other payees subsituted, and these bonds
were used, as deposits for collaterals in the
insurance company of which Hilt was sec
retary. They were stolen at Braintree, Mass.,
on the 7th of July, 1871, and carafe en
tered in the Register's office of the United
States Treasury at the time. The sing
ularity in this case is that the bonds could
have been used as collaterals without the
Insurance Commissioner knowing their
worthlessncss, and it might be well for all
holding Government bonds to make a rigid
examination into the matter, since, even if
registered, they may prove utterly worth
less to the holder.
It is well to know that your bonds are
not only registered, but you should also
know that they have not been tampered
with.
Contested Elections.
In Northampton county they are to have
a contested electiou for Sheriff under the
new law.
The Democratic candidate for Sheriff in
Northampton county, Mr. Pearson, received
fifty-two majority over Mr. Yon?g, and the
usual specification of frauds and irregu
laris are made in behalf of Mr. Young
and signed by twenty electors and sworn to
by five of the number.
The following are some of the most im
portant irregularities alleged to have been,
committed :
A Justice of the Peace swearing the
Judsre of Election instead of the minoritv
inspector as required by law ; neglecting to
examine the registry to see whether the
name of each voter was oa it : not requiring
naturalized citizens to produce their pa
pers, who- have been voters for le3s than
five years ; keeping improperly the tally of
voters in couting them ; not making tripli
cate jetarns ; not publicly declaring the
vote of each candidate after the vote was
counted ; not returning a list of voters to
the Frothoaotary's office neglecting to
sign the tally list, and others of the same
character.
For District Attorney, Mr- Iliibnrn, the
Democratic candidate, was defeated by fifty
three majority for Mr. Merrill, and also
proposes to contest. Besides the usual
specifications the contestant alleges that
many ballots with simply "John." "J."
"Calvin," and "C." Merrill, were all
counted for "John C. Merrill," and there
fore illegally gave him a majority
Meeting of Congress,
VvASiiiNGTOif, Pec. 7
Without excitement cr confusion, Con
gress met and went quietly to work to-day.
There was a full attendance in both houses,
an J the galleries were crowded with visi
tors. There was considerable interest
manifested in the President's Message, al
though its contend 'cxq generally known.
There were some vrn? last week thought
that the President would .tc counsel of
the recent elections, and make tme con
cessions to the demand for some ineVise
of currency, and favor some of the inter na!
improvement sohemcs, either by direct
or indirect aid from the government. These
were all doomed to disappointment, and al
though the fact that ho is for specie re
sumption at once is gratifying to the hard
money men in both houses, who are mainly
Democrats, very few agree with him as to
the means of bringing it abcut.
So far as his message was expected by
any-one to aid in rallying the broken column
of tho Republican party it was a complete
faijurc. IH3 specie policy will be ignored
in both houses, and the probability is that
nothing will be done with the Currency
question this session, and time will be was
ted, as it was last winter, in fruitless en
deavors to harmonize conflicting views in
both parties. There will, however, be a
bill introduced, and pressed at once, to re
peal the provision of the last Bank bill re
quiring national banks to redeem their
notes at the Treasury hero. All the small
country banks are opposod to it, and are
demanding its repeal. It proves to be a
serious contraction and expense without
benefit to any one.

Republicans a clear majority of'lO. The
Houso of Representatives will consist of 90
