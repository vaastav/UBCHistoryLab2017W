THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE!.
Tbongh oar telegrams remained ob
stinately mate reapeeting the eontenta of
the President' message, we last night
received a copy in one of our exchanges,
and in another column publish a brie!
synopsis of lha subject discussed in that
document. It appears to be a plain business-like
statement of the condition of
the national - affairs, which,, though
length; bom the importance ol the mat
ters referred to, is a very interesting snd
readable document. The President takes
strong gronnds on the resumption of
specie payments, and very truly ssvs,
that the matter may be put off, bat that
such procrastination ia not only crim
inal but useless, for the day will come
when a return to cash payments must
be made, simply because from th de
cline of national and individual credit
nothing else will b taken in tha liquid'
ation of all obligations, whether public
or private. Tha faot is, that the Frew-
dent had to accept the formula of the
lamented. Greeley, and in effect says,
though he does sot use the words of his I
great rival: "That the way to resume
is to resume." Daring the last Presi
dential campaign, the great Journalist
was hooted by his enemies for his lack
of financial ability, and those wiseacres
said that if he were elected that national
bankruptcy would follow. Now we see,
that In two short years, bis competitor is
recommending the very conrse that
Greeley advised. But no matter where it
comes. or from whom, specie payments are
daily becoming more and more a necessi
ty , and the President shows his good sense
and foresight in sdvising that immediate
steps be taken to provide for the change.
On the condition of the (Southern States
the President does not take so satisfacto
ry a position, though his remarks appear
candid, with au evident endeavor to look
at those embarrassing questions coolly
and fairly without reference to party
bias. In this tha President's observa
tions appear In favorable contrast with
most of the officials and politicians who
support those villainous carpet baggers.
The former sction of the President in
tne Louisiana ense is what troubles him
and though he persistently defends hii
action, it is easy to sea that if he had ths
matter to manage over again, he would
never have taksn the coarse he did. The
President then takes up the subject of
foreign relations and makes a very satis
factory showing. In discussing the
tariff he appears to visibly lean to the
side of one for revenue and not for pro
tection. Referring to the Indian affairs,
he says that the policy has been success
ful. We suppose be meant successful in
causing the massacre of the settlers and
letting the murderers Joff soot free, we
know of nothing else in which it has
been successful. The President also ad
vocates the establishment of liberally
paid lines of mail steamers and other
means for the revival of American com
merce. Taking the messsge as a whole,
though totally void of all pretentious
language or hifalutin, and having but
few merits as a literary production, still
it is very creditable to its author, and
shows that after all, he does think about
something else besides smoking cigars,
trotting horses and receiving gifts.
Ts Chicago Tribune, now edited by
MerjJill, aays:
The return of tha Democratio part to
the control of th Government will ne
cessarily involve th pecuniary recogni
tion oi the rebellion, th complete com
pensation oi th people ol the Bonmern
States for all their losses and damages
caused by th Union armies, th assump
tion of the rebel States debts, and such a
general accumulation of debt as will
double th taxes and mortgage the Unit
ad States for ths next two eeoturie.
To all of which it may be safely re
plied, that if any inch idiotic folly is at
tempted by th Democratio or any other
party, that its leas of power will b so
remarkably short that they will b out
before they well know that they are in.
Ix the German Bsichstag Prince Bis
marck makes us of th following re
markable language as to ths osusos that
precipitated the Franco-German war:
I am in possession of conclusive evi
dence that the (Ecumenical Council was
cut short on account of the Franco-German
war. It would have been vary dif
ferent had the French been victorious,
I know from th very best sources that
Nanoleon was d reeded into th war. very
much against his will, by Jesuitical in
fluence. At the eleventh hour he de
termined on peace, and kept his resolu
tion half an hour. Ultimately he was
overpowered by persons representing the
Vatican. j
Yf gather from our telegrams pub
lished this morning that the Proctor.
Houlton libel suit has been compromised.
It is further said that Beecber is very in
dignant that he did not have an oppor
tunity to testify. That is too thin. We
have no idea that the man wants to go
near th witness box, and if be does, it
will be very little consequence, for under
existing circumstances he could expect
no on but his deluded congregation to
give any credence to his testimony.
In Washington it has been decided by
s full bench of judges, that the grand
jury who indicted the safe burglars were
illegally chosen, consequently the indict
ments against Harrington and Whitely
are nullities. Wa thought so. It will be
as difficult to punish th criminals in
that shameful business as it would be to
set fire to a block of ioe.

intro-
' Anothkb railroad robbery has oc
curred. This time it was at a place
called Muncie, in Kansas, where th ex
press car was entered and Wells-Fargo's
safe robbed ot 927,000 in dust, coin and
greenbacks. The Governor of Kansas
offers a reward of $2,000, the Railroad
Company $5,000, and Wells, Fargo &
Co. $10,000, for the robbers.
Thr New York Court of Appeals,
reversed the ruling of the lower court
refusing the motion made by Beecber'S
counsel for a bill of particulars. The
defendants in that suit never intend that
it shall come to trial if they can help it.
Jonathan Stcbobs, one of the oldest,
best known and most respeoted of New
Tork merchants, died last week at the
ripe old a&e of seventy-three. For forty
years he had been a leading member of
the merchants of New York.
HoroUTON, who pretends to represent
California in Congress, but is nothing
more or less than a Congressional rail
road attorney, is about to introduce a
bill to extend Government aid to the
Southern Pacific Railroad. The Cen
tral Pacific has already got its claws Into
th Southern Pacifio and wants another
road to be built by the people's money
and then presented to the company,
whioh would immediately consolidate
with the Central Pacifio, and then there
would be another instance, of tha people
being robbed and deprived of that prop
er competition which is the only means
of keeping these monster corporations in
anything like decent behavior. The
scheme very plainly shows the ear-marks
of that precious institution, the Contract
and Finanoe Company of the Central
Pacific.

Conference soon to take place at St.

expressly states its utter lack of faith in
the establishment of any rules or princi
ples by whioh it would consent to be
guided in tbe event of hostilities with
any other power.
Jcst as we thought, the riots at Yicks
burg had been precipitated by the oarpet
baggers and negroes. It appears that
ths sheriff was soting without bonds, the
supervisors would not take any action in
the matter and the usual amount of ras
cality was at work. ' Both parties be
came inflamed, tha negroes marched on
Vicksburg, tbe whites resisted and the
trouble commenced. That is tbe whole
affair in a nut shell.
A tebeible inundation occurred at St.
