Taylor deliberately murdorcd J.
D. "Smith, in cold blood, at Ft.

This was followed on Monday
by tho following card, dated San

ovoning Zackary Taylor, commonly
known as Jim Taylor, went to
tho house occupied by James D.
Smith in old Ft. Bowio. The

who was told by Taylor to stop
outside. Mr. Smith who was sitting
at a table and in tho act of
lighting his pipe called to Taylor
to "como in" but Taylor fired two
shots at him through tho open
door, both pistol balls entering his
left breast. Eising, Smith made
two or thrco stops forward and
grappled with Taj lor, both falling
flat on tho ground outside tho door.
With his left arm around Smith's

CLEVELAND'S LAST MESSAGE,
V Lengthy and Diplomatic Document Say
ing lluch About Cuba Devotes Much
of It to That Important Question but
Itecommends Nothing He
Touches on Many Other Mat
ters of Gi cat Importance
To the Congress of Iho United
States: As a repiosentativo of tho
peoplo in the legislative branch of
their government you havo assem
bled at a time when tho strength
nnd excellence of our free constitution
and tho fitness of our citi
zciis to enjoy popular rule havo
been again maif'usted. A political
contest involving momentous con
sequences; naught with feveiish
apprehension and incrcassing aggressiveness
and passion, has been
waged throughout our land and
determined bv tho decrease of a
free and independent suffrago without
tho disturbance of our tranquility
or tho leatsign of weakness
in our national suueture.
When wo consider these inci
dents and contemplate tho peaoefal
obedience and manly submission
which havo succeeded a heated
clash of political opinions we dis
cover abundant evidence of a determination
on tho part of our
countrymen to abide by every
verdict of the popular will and to
be controlled at all times by an
abiding faith in tho agencies established
for tho direction of the affairs
of their government. Thus
far our people exhibit a patriotic
disposition which entitles them to
demand of thoso who undortako to
make and execute their laws such
faithful and unselfish service in
their behalf as can only bo prompted
by a serious appreciation of
tho trust and confidence which the
acceptance of a public duty invites.
With this analysis of tho recent
election President Cleveland began
his annual message to Congress.
Tho document comprises more than
20.000 words It contains besides
a wealth of departmental information
and statistics a succinct review
of tho Cuban revolution without
committing the United Statos gov
eminent to an avowal of hostilities
either against tho soveriegnty of
Spain or tho Cuban insurgent.
President Cleveland begins that
pottion of his message devoted to
lorcign affairs by referring congress
to the report of tho secretary'
for all details in connection with
minor matters, lie then declares
that the disturbed condition in
has assumed a less
itdcousand bloody aspect during
tho past year owing to tho decisive
action on the part of tho great nations
and tho consequent awakening
of tho Turkish government to
the demand of human civilization. bo
So far as the United Slates government
is concerned it has left
nothing for tho protection of in
American missionaries and citizens
tho Ottoman empire.
Continuing tho President says:
"I do not believe the present
prospect in Turlcoy will bo
long permitted to offend tho sight
of Christendom. It so mars tho
humano and onlightcnod civilization
that belong to closo of tho At
nineteenth century that it sooms
hardly possible that tho earnest
demand of tho good peoplo throughout
the Chrislain world for its corrective on
treatment will remain unanswered.
President Cleveland in dealing
with the Cuban situation is unalterably ed
opposed to the recognition to
tho insurgonts as belligerents.
He belioves tho situation to bo too If,
delicate for any intervention on
the part of the United States at tho
present time, although his message
strongly hints that tho ultimato out
como may requiro an aggressive
stand on tho part of this govern
ment. With tho greatest delicacy
devotes a largo pbrtion jf his
message to a review of tho situation
and points as a solution of tho
problem tho offer to Cuba on tho
part of Spain genuine automy.
The insurrection ho declares still
continues with all its perplexities.
No decision has been reached in
tho trial at arms. "If Spain has
not yet her
neither havo tho insurgents yet
made good their titlo to bo regarded
as an independent state. The
pretext that civil government exists
on tho island except so far as
Spain is able to maintain it has
been practically abonded. But
that exception boing mado tho entire
country is oithcr given ovor to
anarchy or is subject to a military
occupation of ono or tho other of
party. It is roportod indeod on
reliable authority, that the domand
of tho of the
insurgant army that the putative
Cuban government has now given
up all attempts to exercise its
functions leaving that government
confessedly. But there is ovciy
reason for supposing it always to
havo been in fact a government
merely on paper."
Piesidcnt Cleveland is disposed
to acknowledge tho superiority of
tho Spanish arms and of tho Cuban
tactics. He says, however, unless in
speedy contest in tho open is
had tho policy of tho Spanish not
to interfere with the destruction of
property will ruin tho fertility,
prouuctivonccs and consequent
commercial value of tho island.
The message points out tho
many entangled interests of the
United States in Cuba. Almost
850,000 of American capital is invested
there; and tho trado before
tho revolution reached
000 annualv. Our concern in
Cuba is therefore neither continen
tal nor wholly philanthropic but
aro in many ways both
and to much cost involved in
the present contest. Ho points
out tho difficulties which wo are
siiojecicu to uy reason oi tho main
Cuban residents who aro nation
alized Americans and- who while
aiding the insurrection through
public meetings tho press, war
funds and other means requiro
tho constant vigilance of the authorities
at Washington. Besides
tho natural sympathy of tho peo
pie of this country with those who
struggle for a better and freer gov
ernment combined to tho adven
turous and reckless element in
Europo makes tho position of the
United States in its declared
most difficult to maintain
These inevitable entanglements and
tho consideration of philanthropy
and humanity in general have led
to a vehement demand in various
quarters for somo sort of posthe
interveution on tho part of the
United States.
President Cleveland declares
against according belligerent rights
anu does not think Spain desires
to sell and depreciates a war with
Spain as a settlement of tho ques
tion on tho ground of lnsutlieient
reason for this country to violate
its universal reputation as the
most pacific of tho powers and the
desiro of its people to live in amity
with all tho world. Tho United
States ho says has plenty of
tory and should continue to manifest
its l atient enduranco which is
no slight testimonal of tho icgard
for Spain on tho part of the Ameri
can peoplo. While remembering
tho part Spain has plaj'ed in the
western hemisphere neither the
people or tho government of tho
United States have shut their oyes
to tho course of Spam in this con ly
test.
After suming up the complications
of international law bear
ing on tho case the president says:
"It would seem that if Spain would
offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a
measure of homo rule which, while
preserving tho sovereignty of Spain
would satisfy all rational requirements
of her Cuban subjects. Theio of
should bo no just reason why the
pacification of the island might not
affected on that basis. It would
put the prosperity of tho island on
the fortunes of its inhabitants with
their own control without severing
tho ncutial and ancient ties
which bind them together as a
conntry."
It has been intimated to Spain, In
and that country does not seem
unwilling tcxadopt tho suggestion as
that tho United States act as mediator
in bringing about this result.
the same timo Spain demands
that tho insurgents lay down their
arms beforo a compromise will be
considered, and tho Cubans insist
something more definilo than a
promiso of autonomy beforo they
will consent to do so. In any
ovent tho president says tho Unit
States should make no attempt by
acquire the island and prevent
any other power from acquiring it.
however, tho ability of Spain to
demonstrate its sovereignty becomes the
manifest tho United States
should not hesitato to recognize
and discharge its duties without in
any way meanwhile stimulating a
disregard to duty or ill-timed expression
of felling. Briefly Ho
on tho Venezuelan boundary a
question and tho Bchring sea complications, on
the president then devotes
himself to internal affairs.
His messago takc3 up in detail the
various debts of tho national government. be
In tho treasury department
receipts for 1890 wcro 8409,-475,408.79;

Nov. 1, 189G, total money in tho
United Statos was 82,285,410,590,
and the amount in circulation exclusive of
of treasury holdings was of
1,027.055,011, or 822 61 per
capita on population of 81,902,000. is
The eoinago of these metals
throughout tho world tho same uso
year was 8232,802,438 in gold and
8121,980,129 in silver. On Oct. 0,
1896, there 3,079 national banks
operation, wiih 83,263,G05,000
resources.
Of tho liabilities 81,590,891,058-.03
was duo depositors and 210,-
000,000 was outstanding circulating
notes. Twenty-eight new
banks wero orarnized and thirty
surrendered their charters, while
lor twenty-seven others receivers
wero appointed. State banks to
the number of 5,708 wore in exist
ence during tho year.
Immigrants arrived, bringing to
this country 8500,000.
In reviewing tho war depart
ment tho president does not recom
mend an increased army, as ho
says the organized milita" numbers
112.S79 men and costs S3,200,000
annaually, which should suffice.
Ho believes both the reirular
army and milita should have more
monej' for equipments.
Ecgarding tho navy the president
recommends the expenditure
of money for coast defences, de
clares his beleif in tho ability of
trie government to build its own
vessels and equipments; is opposed
to paying any further speed premiums,
and recommends a plan
lor laying up snips in reserve so as
to reduce tho cost of maintaining
our veseles afloat. Eight new
cruisers and two gunboats have
been commissioned and the chief
executive says American ships aio
equal to any afloat.
Tho president thinks federal of
fenders should bo confined in tho
government prisons.
Tho postoflico department he
says is in good condition with a
deficit of S8.000.000, owing to tho
reduction of postal duties and tho
increaso without proportionate revenue
of low class mail matter.
Tho total Indian population is
177,235. Tho president believes
tho Indians show improvement un
der government management and
recommends that they be looked
alter by a commission, ono of
whom shall be an army officer.
President Cleveland hits the
pension grabbers a hard blow.
He shows that last year tho number
of pensioners materially increased
until the list is the largest over reported,
numbering 970,078. and
costing 8137,214,701.94.
President Cleveland 'demands
the settlement of the Pacific rail-
way loans and grants, and especial-
tho foreclosure of tho Union
Pacsfic mortgage Ho shows in the
agricultural department that a
valuo of farm products exported in
1896 amounted to 8570,000,000.
Ho is opposed to further gratuitous
distribution of seed.
The interstate commerce and
civil service laws aro highly commended.
While admitting a deficit
little more than 825,000,000, tho
president defends the Wilson tariff
bill as having opened up foreign
markets and stimulated trado with
other countries.
Tho present bill, ho sas, will &
yield sufficient rovenuo if given a
fair trial, but tho deficit was to be
cxpcuted in tho face of tho business
depression of the past two years.
this connection he defends the
drafts mado on tho reserve fund
ho says it is immeasurably to
appropriate our surplus to tho pay
inert of justifiable expenses than to
allow it to become an invitation to
clas i appropriation and extravagant
expenditures.
Tho president alludes to our financial
methods as weak and vicious
and asks prompt reform of the
system which is opposed to every at
rule of sound finance and shown
cxperienceto bo fraught with a
grievous peril and perplexity. He
refers to the lato contest as being a
greater menaco to property than
lato war.
Ho declaics financial peace cannot
bo secured until government
currency obligations upon which
may bo demaded aro withdrawn
from circulation and cancelled.
advocates their exchanging for
long term at low intciest bonds
their redemption with tho proceeds
of such bonds. If this is not
dono he thinks such currency obligations
when redeemed should
cancelled instead of being reissued.
National banks should redeem
their own notes. They should bo
allowed to issue circulation. Tho
should bo reduced to one-fourth
of ono per sent. Summing
the financial situation the president
says: "Tho entire caso may
presented by tho statement that
day of sensible and sound financial
methods will not dawn on 1,
until our government abandons
banking business and tho accumulation
of funds and confines
monetary operations to tho receipts
of money contributed by the all
people for its support and to the
expenditure of such money for the
people's benefit."
After denouncing tho tendency
tho times towards tho creation
trusts and monopolies, the tendency
ot which tho president said
to crush out industrial independence
and hamper or provent the
of hitman faculties and full development
of human character.
The president appeals to congress
to exerciso rigid economy. at
"Tho way of perplexing
is easy but a return to frugality
is difficult."
He then concludos as follows:
"When our differences
and our contest of political
opinions aro no longer
nothing in tho retorspect of onr
public service will be as fortunate
and comforting as tho
official duty well preformed an'd
a memory ot a constant devotion
to tho interests of our confiding'
fellow countrymen.
