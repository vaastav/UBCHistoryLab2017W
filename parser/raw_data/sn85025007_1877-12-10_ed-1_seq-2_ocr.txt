Albert Taylor Bledsoe, whoss death is
aDDouooed elsewhere io to-iay's Gazette, was
bora in Frankfort, Kentucky, November 9,
1809. When about twelve or fourteen years of
ago bis remarkable mechanical ingenuity, io
seeing through and imitating a puzzle, attracted
the attention of Governor Letcher, of Kentucky,
who said : "This boy shall have a cadet9hip
at West Point." In his sixteenth year
he went to the Military Academy through the
itflueDce of the Governor. He graduated there
in 1830, and for a year or two he seived io the
army as Secood Lieutenant, io the irregular
frontier warfare with tho Indians. At the expiration
of the time due from oadets to the
United Slates service, he began to read law,
wbioh was his chosen profession, io tho office
of his uncle, Mr, Samuel Taylor, of Richmond.
In 1834 ho took the Assistant Professorship of
Mathematics at Keoyoo College, Gambier, 0.,
where he also studied Theology, and io 1835
he was ordained to the ministry of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, He then took a parish
io Hamilton, Ohio, and at the same time the
Professorship of Mathematics in Miami University.
Io 1836 he was married, and in 1837 went to
Lexiogtoo, Ky., where he became the Assistaot
to tho present Senior Bishop of the Episcopal
nnoatinn * h Hiia f i m rt OrrtSiO

in bis mind, iu regard to the teachings of tbe
Prayer Book oo the subject of Baptismal lie
generation, which fioally ioduced him to resign
the ministry. Ho then offered himself to the
authorities of the Methodist Church, but was
refused admittance on account of somo views,
which did not quite acoord with the belief of
that denomination. Through his whole life
his views, though always iodepeodeot, were i
nearer those of the Methodist Church than of
any other. i
Leaving the ministry he began the practice
of law in Carrollton, III., and afterwards carried
it on in the Supremo Court of Illinois,at Spring- '
field, ood for a short time in tho Supreme
Court at Washington.
Io 1845 he published uAn Examination of (
President Edward's Inquiry into the Freedom
of the Will," which has been for many years
out of print. Iu J848 he applied for and ob- !
tained tbe Professorship of Mathematics io the
University of Mississippi. Ia 1853 ho published
bis "Theodicy,or Vindication of the Divine
Glory, os Manifested in tho Constitution
and Government of the Moral World," which,
after beiog rijscted as a Rife by several ot tho
most astute publishers in the United States on
account of the unpopularity of the subjeot, went
through three editious of 1,000 each, in four
months. Subsequently many other editions
were called for and printed.
Io 1854 he accepted tbe "Professorship of
Mathematics in tbe Uoiversity of Virginia.
Whilo there, io 1857, he wrote his "Liberty
nod Slavery." After tho completion of the
volume he was smitten with brain fever, and
lay for several weeks, hoveriog between life
aod death.
When the war broke out he entered the army .
as Colooe! iD the Confederate service, but Presi- <
dent Davis, sayiDg that be wanted the service
of his brain, rather than of his hand, appoint- i
ed him Assistant Secretary of War. He served
about eighteen months, bearing, for much of
tho time, the entire responsibility of the Department,
in consequeooo of tho ill health of
his superior officer. During this time ho retained
the possession of his mathematical pro 1
fessorship.
In 1863 he resigned on acoouut of impaired
health and wont to London in order to pursue i
his studies of the Constitution of tho United j
States. He returned in 1865, aod soon afterwards
published (in 1866) his book, "Is Davis
a Traitor, or was Secession a Constitutional
Right Previous to tho War of' 1861 ?" Io ,
1865 he wrote "Tho Philosophy of Mathemat- j
ics," completing it io the space of three weeks,
and 80oo after published it, and io tho same
year he began tho publication of "The Southern J
Review," Baltimore, Md., to the editorial du- (
ties of which ho has devoted himself since that '
time.
From the time that he loft tho ministry of
tho Episcopal Church he romaioea a lay mem
ber until 1871,when ho began occasional preaching
in tho Methodist Church, and soon after 1
wards became a member and then a preacher 1
of that denomination. In that samo year the x
Southern Review was accepted by tbe General :
Conference of the M. E. Church, South, as
its organ, though it always expressed the views 1
of tho editor himself, and was never subject to j
any supervision from outside. I
On the 7th of November he felt the oncom- j
ing of tbe illness, whioh soon prostrated him,
and his first wordson coming home were, "My j
timeisoome." Without a tremor at the thought a
of death, but with an unspeakable horror of ?
outliving his mental powers, ho lay dowo,
to die. In a very few days all care, anxiety a
and dread fell away from bim, and be lived on I
with only sweet thoughts and pleasant fancies v
flitting across his mental vision, till he sunk
into a calm and gentle sleep,whioh lasted almost w
uninterruptedly till he breathed his last at eleven 8]
o'clock Saturday night, December 8th.

Dr. Bledsoe was one of tho most vigorous (]
thinkers of the age, and being firmly oonvinoed u
of the oorreoiness of hie own opinions, was dis- h
tinguished for the boldness with which ho an- ^
oounoed and supported them. He possessed ^
great natural mental powers, whioh bad been p
assiduously cultivated, and was a rapid and
industrious writer. Ho was truly an able man, {c

Legislative.?lo the State Senate, on Sat |
urday, Messrs. Queseobeny and Johnson were
excused from serving upon corumi'lees?the
former from the Committee ou ll)ads aud Lu
teroal Navigation, and the latter from the Com
mittee on Courts of Justice. The Chair stated
that he did the best he could ia the appdut
mcot of the committees, and had the approval
of his owd conscience, and therefore would not
have aoy feeling at the ac'ioo of individual
Senators. A committee on re apportionment
was appointed, ana u number of unimportant
bills and resolutions presented a ad referred.

and resolution scornicg tbu repudiation of i
public debt, but providing for the appointment
of a jo'mt committee to eoider with the b^od
holders aod make a fair aud equitable rcjdju-tment
of the publio debt. The resolution, pro
posing a reduction of 20 per coot, io the salaries
of all offioers in the State, including members
of the Legislature, was debated, but laid
over till to day. Mr. Brooke's res lutiou for
the appointment of a j )iot commi t^; on rovi
sion of the criminal laws, to consist <f five on
the part of the Senate and uinc ou the part of
the House, was agreed to.
Io tho House of Delegates, a resolution was
adopted for the appointment of a j )iat commit
tee, to whom all propositions for amendments
to the Constitution aQ.l such measures as arc
referred to in the Governor's message be re
ferrcd. A committee on the part of the House
oo reapportionment was appointed. Mr. Mushbach,
of Alexandria, introduced a bill to amend
tho act of March 27, 1870, sess. acts 1S75?*76,
page ICS. The till iu relation to the use of
convicts iu the repair of the James lliver aod
Kanawha canal was discussed aud advauccd to
a second reading. The time for the use of the
convicts was limited to Deonmber 1, 1879.
Probabilities point more and more, as Prcsi*
dent Hayes's term is proceeding uninterruptedly
on its course, to General Grant as the radical
Domincc for the succession. Every act of the present
Cungress that may result disastrously to the
interests of the country, whether the democrats
be solely responsible for ic or not, will strengthen
this probably ; and, that there may bu some
such acts, the radical support certain democratic
measures receive, occasions forebodings
by no means unwarrantable. Then, too, notwithstanding
the denials to the contrary,
Cscsarism was Dot kided when Mr. Hayes was
nominated. There are thousands of people all
over the country who are tired of this form of
government?some who ore rien uuu want iu
secure their posscs.-ions, and think that end can
be accomplished by a mi;i:ary goveromoor, ai d
9ome who arc poor, whose condition may be
improved, but cannot be injured by any change
?and both will favor a third term to General
Grant, as a means of efTeoliog that change.
With such a lookout, the true lovers of the
country should be ou their guard, and democratic
legislators, State ut;d National, be careful
to do nothing that will Lend to still further low
er free institutions in public estimation. They
are low enough now in conscience ; any further
reduction would bring them to the condition of
absurdity.
The members of the Virginia Legislature
may have enjoyed their "sport" last Satutday
Dight, but they certainly could not have realized
I he fact that they were uiakiotr a foot ball
of the credit of the State, acd itjtiring the reputation
of the people they represent. If readjustment
be the sioe qua non of prolonged
State cxistcuce, let it at iea*t ho accomplished
decently and in order.
It will be seen that Mr. Eustis was, to-day,
admiitnd to his seat in the Senate by a vote of
49 to 8. This increases the democratic strength
in that body.

Virginia eh lcgauoo having, by letter, ds c-iacii [

give to its readers information obtained from
the most authoritative sources on the sulj;ct:
The first district, better known as the Fred
crieksburg district, is at present represented by
Major B verly B. D ueias, of Ajleits, King
William county. M-j. Douglas s.rved in liie
fburty-f'ourtb Congress, anil was re elected to
the present, lie is a man of undoubted ability,
and at one time ranked among the foremost debaters
in the State wheD her pubiie men equaled
t!io>e of uny in the country, lie lias failed
to take that position in the House that it was
thought ho would, and his Congressional career
has rather disappointed those who know his
powers of mind, llo wiil not, it is confidently
asserted, be Dominated as a candidate f ?r reelection,
and already Mealy, of Acejurae; (Mi
c'.or, Montague,Braxton and others are :ip? kvn
of for the stiCjessioD.
J oho Goode represents the second, or Mir
folk district. His seat in ihe last House was
ooutestcd by Piatt, a somiwhat noted em pi tbagm
r, but, by a close Vote, Mr. Goodc retained
his place. In the subsequent election lw
was opposed by Joseph Segar, who threatened
to coutt st Mr. G '9 right to a seat in this Hou-e,
hut failed to carry out his intention. Mr.
Goode is an able politician, an energetic repre
seotative, watchful of the interests of hi" ci?n
stiiuiuts, and a fiuc speaker, always command
iug the ear of the House. Permitting the us
of his name as an opponent ol Mr. ll?ndail for
Speaker was the gravest mistake of his Congressionaljoarcer,
indeed, about the only ot.c he
has made. Wis jaid ambition ?and Mr. (J.
must plead guilty to the soft impeachment?
spurred him on, added to the importunities of
Morrison, Sayle-r, Blackburn, and a few others,
but in this butane ambiiion overleaped itself
and fell on tother side, carrying wall it all save
one of his colleagues from Virginia. So fat no
opposition has developed itself, and Mr. G.
may have a walk over the course nix time.
The third, or Riohmond disiriet, was in the
last, and is iu this House, represented by (J 11bcrt
Carlton Walker, who, as above stated, declines
another term, though injustice to him it um-i
bo said that he has lost nothing of his great
popularity. He has somewhat disappointed
the t xpcctations of the public, who thought he
would have made a greater reputation and

ings of the House. His appearance never fails
to attract, but otherwise be has made do ma:k.
There will be maoy aspiraotsfor Gov. W.'s place,
those prominently mcDliontd, so fir. being
Mayor Keiley and Joho 8. Wise, of Richmond,
though it is said by those who profess to kuow
that a candidate will ho Si'leotod from the rural
portion ef* the district.
Joseph Jorgenson, of Pennsylvania, and
an assistant surgeon in the U. 8. Army
during the war, and who alighted in Prince Piward
county, represents the leurth or Black
district, io the House. lie is seldom seen, scl
dum heard of, and will no doubt be omitted
next time. Col. W. E. Hiotoo, Gen. iMahcne,
Mr. Berkeley aod others are mentioned a.J.hc
conservative candidate, and there is not much
doubt tbat a conservative will represent the district
io the next House.
George C. Cabell, of Danville, is the renre
seniative from the filth district in the present
House, as he was in the last. Col. Cabell is a
relative of the Breckeuridges, and presses a
strong family resemblance, hut apparently Pcks
the vigor if intellect so conspicuous iu his kns
ineD. lie la very jmuc uat in Pis attend .nee
upon the sittings ol the House, hut has, so far,
taken no part io the debates, and it is Dot known
that he i t a speaker. It is likely !r: will have
opposition uext time. Col. John H. Peon.
Maj. Suthiriin, A. Audersoo and other* arc
named, but Col. Peon is the most formidable
opponent yet mt ntioucd.
John Randolph Tucker, locked uj.oo as one
of the be?t Constitutional lawyers iu the State
or country, a strict constructionist of the st?ict
est sect, aod a man of uedoubod ability, represents
the sixth or Lexington district in the
iiousj. The 8cDate would be a more appropriate
f'oruoo for tbc display of bis talcnis.?
Notwithstanding bis legal lore aod scknoivlcrig
cd genius, he has not made the display autici
pated, and lately has been very quiet. Hiultra
State's rights views make him a target in
the House for the shafts of the republic ins.?
Mr. Tucker will have decided opposition for ro
election, aod the Hon. Thomas Whitehead will
most likely be pitted against him, the friends of
Mej. J. W. Daniel, his former competitor,
probably oooperaiing with Mr. W. O.her

The seventh district is represented by John
T. Harris, who is now serving his fourth consecutive
term. lie cciupies the position of
chairman of the Elections Committee, and is
the only member of the delegation who adhered
to Mr. llaodall in opposition to Mr. Goode.?
He is said to be the greatest electiooecrcr in Virginia,
never allowing his contests to puriurb
his personal rclatioos. Notwithsandirg he will,
it is said, have decided opposition, sjujo of the
most distinguished men in the district being
spoken of. Augusta, Shenandoah and Rockingham
counties will each present a oandidatc,
aDd Mr. H.'s reiuro is problematical.
The Alexandria district, the eighth, is represented,
for the third term in the House, by
Gen. Eppa Iiunton, who during the la>t session
acquired a deserved reputation by his > xpusure
of lilaioe. He also served upon the Electoral
Commission and opposed filiblistering in the
House. His posiiion on the Judiciary Committee
gave him a prominence ou the flior that
be will not agaio occupy. God. J I. is not a
brilliant man, but is looked upon in the Hou-e
as a safe counsellor. He is very seldom heard
in the House, and will Dot be likely to make
further mark. He will have opposition for reeleotiou,
the fact of his having served three
t-rms and his action iD reference to the elcctoial
count, disapproved by a portion of ids eoo
sti'Uenis, making a n nomination difficult.?
Gov. Kemper, Jus Williams, S J. C. Moore.

Richmond. Dae. S.?Senator Wood bas iu
troduced a bill in the Senate that is of interest
to lawyers and sheriffs throughout the State.
The bill provides lor the amendment of the
Code of'73 r.o that in a criminal case in a eir
ciiir, county, or corporation court, if qualified
jurors uot exempt Iroui serving cannot be coo

this hill will meet with tho approbation of criminal
lawyers, especially when they are for the

has i' in hand.
Hi-re was quiie an exciting scene io Ihe

in secret session in the old billiard room at the
Exchange Hotel. Mr. Fulkeison. of Washing
too, was elected permanent chairman, aud
Messrs. McCau'-l, of Pulaski, and liobio'-oo, of
Portsmouth, .secretaries As this latter wing
was the "Simon pure" readjustment element,
us Mr. HarrRoo called it. ihi-ir meeting ha-i
created somo excitement. Mr. Eu.kersou, in
l-is speech accepting the nomination of chair
mao, delivirod sentiments that eiioired ap
plausc. lie denounced the Funding bill, and
Slid that the State credit had already been dis
honored bv repeated promises to pay and noi
paying. What was demanded dow was tc
make our ricoipts pay the expenses, and without
increase of taxes. The session was secret,
and only in em h-.-rs of the legislature who were
vouchtd for by Messrs. Barbour, Muffett and
other well known ring leaders were admitted.
It, was decided by the caucus not to go into the
election of State offic-rs at pres-nt. This iodi
nates that other candidates will bo brought out.
The caii-us ?i I pmbibly held auothtr meeting

seventy five and eighty gentlemen in attendance
on this caucus, which included Messrs.

and are bold and resolute. When the time

fight against it.
The question of establishing a house restaurant
in the basement of the (J)pitol is being

Interest in political affairs both national and
State is fast dying out in tbis city. A promi

days since was readmit Gov. Kemper's annual
message. VVheu he liuished it he suddenly
flung the paper aside, and lucking eagerly, like
a wr.n who had some new and startling proposition
to advance, said: "Ua! by the way 1
this is Kemp r's last message. Here's another

As the counsel lor the defence always says in
his appeal 10 the jury, ''This is a f*ct, geutlcmen,
