MARINES FOR GUAM.
A Company to Be Sent' to Prenerve
'Order.
In respotee to a reqt.est from Capt.
Leary. navel govcrnor of the Island cf
Guam. the Navy Department has arrar:ged
to send a company of isarines, consisting
of five officers and eighty men, to that
island to preserve the place and execute
the orders of the naval governor. Gen.
Haywood, commandant of the Marine
Corps, has already issued the necessary
orders for the organization of this com
pany from the different marine commanis
in the east. and their assembling at San
Francisco for transportation to Guam on
the U. S. S. Scin'lia, now fitting out at that
post for an *xtended cruise in the Pacitle.
The large marine garrison established at
the Cavite, P. I., a-d the reinforcement of
the small marine guard at Guam leaves
very few marines In this country available
for foreign service. It is believed. how
ever, that the full requirements of the for
eign naval service have been met s far as
the Marine Corps is concerred by the ils
patch of this company to Guam.
THE TRINIDAD TREATY.
Why It Was Omitted From the List
Sent to the Senate.
A noticeable omission In the list of reci
procity treatIes transmitted to the Senate
by the President along with his ressage
yesterday wts the treaty concluded last
summer between Mr. Kasson, representing
the State Department, and a delegation
from the Islanl of Trinidad, B.W.I. This
particular treaty was framed generally ott
the lines of the arrangement made with
the other British West Indian colonies.
But at the last moment, and just before the
treaty was to be submitted to the Senate,
the Trinidad government' notified Mr. Kas
scn. the special plenipotentiary, that it was
obliged to withhold its final approval of the
treaty. Consequently this particular con
vention was not submitted along with the
others to the Senate. The reason assignel
by the Trinidad government for its action
was the probable inadequacy of the cus
toms receipts of the Island to maintain the
government, under the application of the
reciprocity treaty. Much of the trade of
the Island' Is with the United States, and
the duties on imports being already very
low, the further reduction proposed in the
reciprocity treaty would, it was estimated,
reduce the total receipts below the necessi
ties of the gosernment of Trinidad.
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURE.
Two Companies Formed With Wash
ington Men as Principals.
It is likely that the use of the automolile
will become more general in the near fu
ture in this city than Is the case at pres
ent. Two of the largest concerns in the
country engaged in the manufacture of
these vehicles have at their head Washing
ton men. Mr. A. L. Barber is the presi
dent of one of the companies and Mr. Fred
erick C. Stevens is the principal man in
another. An effort is being made to form
a local company. whicht will have the right
to dispose of all machines in this territory
turned out by the company at whose head
Is Mr. Barber. Some orders have already
been taken for vehicles of this descrIption
from some of the large mercantile estab
lishments. as well as from those engaged
In other lines of business, who use a large
number of horses.

TO MEET TOMORROW
First Committee Hearing on the
Roberts Case.
FORM OF PROCEDURE UNDECIDED
Likely That the Sessions Will Be
Public.
WHAT MR. TAYLER SAYS
The committee appointed to investigate
the Roberts cate has b-n called to meet
at 11 o'clock tomotnrrw. Mr. Tayler, the
chairman. said this morning that he had
not yet th.ught over the question of form
of procedure in the co mmit tee, the num
ber of wilesses to be examined ir how far
the committee would go inl taking, testi
mony. The committee. he said. would hold
an executive session tomorrow to consider
and decide ulon the course of procedure.
and until then nothing could be known a.
to the method and limits of the investiga
tion.
Lainug Out n Progran.
The committee will meet in the room of
elections committee No. I of the Houc.
The first meeting will ie devoted to lay
ing out a program of work.
It is probable that Mr. R.berts will be
present with counsel at the subsequent
sessions of the committee.
Demand for Public Hearings.
ile nothing has Ieen dlcirbd yet, it is
probable that the public pressure will be
so great for full reporti that the co-mmit
tee will feel constrained to have all the
sessions open t, the press.
Mr. Tayler thinks inat the committee will
act expeditiously and bring inl a report
upon tle case without tiaeessary Iljay.
May Appeal to the Courts.
It is said that v1r. Roberts, if deprived
of his seat without the form of expulsion,
will carry the case to the courts and at
tempt to get a judlicial decision on the
ground that his ermtit Utional right Is were
abridgd in that he was not verimitted to
take tie oath.
Not to Lene tht City.
There are a number ,f witnese-s in Wash
ington and some, in, Iltalh. hat it is probabl,
that the committe will ,ti1o leave Washing
ton, altliough th-re are son precedents for
extending ant inuiry to other plcnts.
Mr. Tay) -r said th1 isrgumeats inl election
cas s w<-re usualiy open to the tublie, but
he had s-m douit as to whether the
hearings, particuilarly such patts as inl
volvecl family matters, shouldt be (c)p.1n.
These details will hc, dlt.ermin l by th
committee, Mr Ta y-r savying tiat the es
snftial questin was tIo !ur a atm anl
unprejudici cl cc nsil rati n of the eligibiity
of the claimant.
Must Prove Innocence.
In spite of the protest of '%r. Roberts
against being required to prove his own in
nocence, this is exactly tih rccliremeni
that will be made of him.
Some of tihe best Iwers In Congress,
among them members of th- minority wIh.
are opposed to Rocherts leing detnied his
right to t;cke the oath, hIld t l Ea ite allga
tions against Roberts being ccf the char
acter they are, It is incunlent upon him
to disprove them. This apparent reversal
of the theory of law that a man accused is
innocent until eonvicted is based upon thi
principle of law that where by the nature
of the charges the knowledge of the fact
must of nseessity rest only with the ac
cused the accused may be made a witness
against himself.
The facts in the Roberts ease are so mtch
a matter of general understantding that it
Is anticipated that they will he assumed by
the -2ommittee, unless Mr. Roberts presents
evidence to disprove the allegation, or
himself declares under oath that ho is not
guilty of continuing the practice of polyg
amy.
The Fact to Be Ascertained.
The fact to be ascertained by the com
mitte- is a simple one of whether Roberts
has maintained his polygamous relations,
and he will Ir exr :' ted to answer as to
this faet under oath. If he denies it the
committee will have to extend the inquiry
so as to ascertain the truth or falsity of
the denial. If he admits the fact, how
ever ie may attempt to justify It, it is ex
peet'd 'that the committee will find it an
necssary to go further into the investiga
tion, and will make its report to tico
House acivers to his being seated. In this
event it is d< uhtful If there will be a minor
ity report. and there May not be one in any
event. If Itol-erts refuses to testify under
oath as to whether he is maintaining po
lygamous relations It Is believed that the
committee w-ill regard this as equivalent
under the circumstanie. of the case to a
confessiont ancd as sufficient hasis for a re
port adverse to his admission as a member
cif the House. Legal prcedents for the as
sumption will be presented to the commit
tee.
Mr. Roberts About the House.
Mr. Roberts was about the House dur
ing the day. There was no session, and
he was engaged most of the time in chat
ting with groups of members and visitors
who shawed c, friendly disposition toward
him. He said ie had no comment to make
on the course of the House. He will prob
ably look after his interests in person be
fore the gommittee of inquiry.
The Pay of Representative Roberts.
Whether the pay of Mr. Roberts of Utah
is stopped as a result of the action of the
House in refusing him a seat has not been
passed upon by the House officials, and
will not directly arise until the January
pay certificates are issued by Speaker Hen
derson, by which time it is expected that
tite case will be permtanently settled, Mr.
Roberts drew hIs pay up to December '3.
thte dacy before Congress assembled, on the
certificate of Clerk McDowell that he was
a member-elect, With the opening of Con
gress the isstuance of certificates devolves
ccn the Speaker, the monthly certificate
reading that there is due the member a
stated stum "as a member of the House of
Representatives of the Fifty-sixth Con
gress." Whether this certificate could he
issued to Mr. Roberts "as a member" is
open to dcubt. but it is believed that the
fincal action of the House in the Roberts
case wIll remove all docubt before January
ii, when the next certificates are issued,

SIEGE HAS ITS ILLS
Garrison at Ladysmith Suffering
From Many Inconveniences.
BOER FIRE BECOMING EFFECTIVE
Council of War to Consider Ques
tion of an Assault.
MILITIA FOR GEN. BULLER
LONDON. December 6I.-A budget of
news from Ladysmith. which arriv'd to
day, brings the history of the beleaguered
garrison up to November 29f. In sp!te of
the rumors of a retrograde movement upon
the part of the Boers, the stories just re
ceived show that the garrison. although
still strong. was suffering from confine
ment. restricted diet and the increasing
volume of the Boer artillery fire, especially
that of an additional heavy-caliber gun
placed in position i.000 yards from the
western defenses. The dispatches relate
that the Boers had discovered the most
vulnerable points of the garrison. and that
shelling was becoming disagreeably effee
t.ve. The rations had been reduced, ani
theta was a great deal of sickness. Never
thele's. The troops of the garrison were in
every way preparing to met the assault

Buller on Boer Louses.
The war office has received the following
from Gen. Buller:
"PIETERMARITZBURG, Tuesday, De
cember 5.-It is very difficult to make any
statement in regard to the enemy's loss.
For instance, at Belmont 81 of their dead
were accounted for. The enemy gave 15 as
the number of killed. There Is every rea
son to believe that the enemy's loss in the
tight at Ladysmith, November 9, was over
800 killed and wounded. Information from
a trustworthy Boer source shows that at
Hildyard's fight, November 23, the enemy
Icst W0 killed and 100 wounded. It is im
possible to say how far these numbers are
correct. but it is evident the enemy does
not admit a tenth of the losses suffered.
Intercepted dispatches to Joubert from a
commander show that even the official dis
patches contain decidedly inaccurate in
formation in this respect."

CONTEST AT FRANKFORT
Election Commissioners Hearing Argumentu
in Election Oase.
Democrats Anxious to Have Amended
Returns Received-Precedent in
Nelson County.
FRANKFORT. Ky.. December .--It is
likely that the state election commissioners
will consume the entire time tiday hearing
arguments In the contested election cases.
Arguments will be made on two proposl
tions. the chief subject being the right of
the commissioners to go behind the certified
election returns for governor and lieuten
ant governor when sitting as a contesting
board. and the right of the commissioners
to receive amended returns.
Yesterday the democrats allowed without
comment the vote of Nelson county to be
tabulated. but it was for the purpose of
making a hard fight upon it later. This Is
the county where the judges of election
certified to the casting of ballots for W. R
Taylor, instead of W. S. Taylor. They
filed a second certificate correcting the er
ror. And this has now been accepted by
the canvassing board. The democrats will
claim that this has established a precedent
under which amended returns may be re
ceived, and expect to bring in enough
amended certificates from other counties
to overcome the republican plurality.
The republicans will contend, however,
that the first return of Nelson county was
not a return at all as far as the republican
candidate was concerned. There was no
such candidate as W. P. Taylor. and a cer
tification of votes for each individual can
in no way, they will assert. prejudge the
certificate flied giving the votes to W. S.
Taylor. They will make a hard fight on
the proposition that the certificate for W.
S. Taylor was an original document, th
other amounting to nothing. In the fight
over the right to go behind the return.
the contest will be made upon th construe
tion of the election law. Judge Hargis will
make the leading argument for the demo
crats and A. P. Humphrey of Louisville for
the republicans. There will be three argu
ments on each sIde.
WANT EXTENSION OF TIME.
Railway Repreentatives Before the
Interstate Commission.
The interstate commerce commission to
day gave a hearing to the representatives
of the several railway companies asking
for a further extension of the time allowed
the railroads to equip their lines with
safety appliances, under the act of March
2, 1SM. Two years ago the commission
granted an extension until January 1, 1!**e.
The further extension asked for at the
present time is one year. The representa
tives of various labor organizations were
also present to offer their side of the case.
The representatives of abut i(10 roads
were In attendance.
John K. Cowen, president of the Balti
r,;ore and Ohio. representing as chairman
.-ighty-eight other roads having 0,(00) miles
of line, made the opening argument. He
said that Jtne 1, 18M9, 211,268 freight cars
out of 2,208 engaged in interstate commerce
were not equipped with safety appliances.
Since that time the number had been re
duced to between 150.000 and 175,000.
The argument of the railroads asking for
an extension, he said, was based ufron the
showing made by the roads since the last
application. The showing demonstrated
that the railroads had done as well as
could be expected.
Some of the other carm It equipped were
old and would go out of the service within
the coming year. The present withdrawal
of the 175.000 unequipped cars, he said,
would practically paralyze interstate com
-rce.
The roads of the country, he said, were
generally unequipped for the business they
were doing. Indeed, he did not believe it
an exaggeration to say that not one had
enough cars for its business. Beyond the
additional time now requested, he said, .he
roads would ask no further extension.
Wayne MacVeagh, representing the Penn
sylvania and affiliated lines, joined in ask
ing for the extension. They had equipped
148.000 out of 100,000. Mr. Hamlin, on be
half of the Boston and Maine. said that his
rcad would have complied with the law by
January L 1900, but it felt impelled to Join
in the application because other roads had
not complied.
President Knapp of the commission stat
ed for the benefit of those present thAt of
the roads petitioning for an extension over
0 per cent were fully equipped. He said
there was some misapprehension as to the
meaning of the law, which provided not
that all roads should equip their cars, but
that after a certain date no unequipped
cars should participate in interstate com
merce. Fully equipped roads could not.
therefore, haul unequipped cars after the
expiration of the limit.
At this juncture President Knapp an
nounced that the President had sent word
that he would be glad to receive the rep
resentatives of the railroads and labor or
ganizations present at the V1 lote House at
1 o'clock. The invitation was accepted.
After some further argument by represen
tatives of other roads the committee re
cessed until 2 o'clock.

TWO MEN HOLDINC. ONE OFFECE.
Cario s Tangle In Homotul Oner Mr.
Damonse Restignatio.
CHICAGO, December 6.-A special to the
Chicago Record from Honolulu. November
28 (via San Francisco. December t. says:
The news which arrived today that Pr'esi
dent McKinley had refused to accept the
resignation of Minister of Finance S. M.
Damon throws matters here into confusion.
There is a clause in the Hawaiian constitu
tion that a cabinet office becomes vacant
when a cabinet minister is absent from his
country sixty days. Under this clause
Theodore F. Lansing was appointed minis
ter of finance.
There was at the time no question abiut
the appointment, as it was known. that
Damon had sent his resignation toi Presi
dent McKinley. But as under the New
lands resolution Hawaiian officials hold
their appointments from the President,
McKinley's refusal to accept [ramn's
resignation would seem to have i'reated a
condition where there are two officers for
one office.
