Citizens Plan fcr Larger Navy Outlined.
Washington. Doc. 7.-Presldent Wilson
today delivered lila annual message al a
joint session of the two houses of con
Kress. He aald In part:
Since 1 lust had the privilege of ad
dressing you on the state of the Union
the war of nations on the other side of
the sea, which had then only begun to
disclose its portentous proportions, has
extended its threatening and sinister scope
until It has swept within Its flame some
portion of every quarter of the globe, not
excepting our hemisphere, has altered the
whole face of International affairs, and
now presents a prospect of reorganisa
tion and reconstruction such as states
men and peoples have never been called
upon to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neutral.
It was our manifest duty to do so. In
the day of readjustment and recupera
tion we earnestly hope and believe that
we can be of Infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which they were
bidden not only by their separate life and
their habitual detachment from the poli
tics of Europe but also by a clear per
ception of international duty, the states
of America have become conscious of a
new and more vital community of Inter
est and moral partnership In affairs, more
clearly conscious of the many common
sympathies and interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
We have been put to the test In the case
of Mexico, and we have stood the test.
Whether we have benefited Mexico by
the course we have pursued remains to
be seen. Her fortunes are In her own
hands. But we have at least proved that
we will not take advantage of her In her
distress and undertake to impose upon
tier an order and government of our own
choosing.
We will aid and befriend Mexico, but
we will not coerce her; and our course
with regard to her ought to be sufficient
proof to all America that we seek no po
litical suzerainty or selfish control.
Not Hostile Rivals.
The moral Is, that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their growing
sense of community of Interest, alike in
matters political and in matters econom
ic, is likely to give them a new signifi
cance as factors In international affairs
and In the political history of the world.
It presents them as In a very deep and
true sense a unit In world affairs, spir
itual partners, standing together because
thinking together, quick with common
sympathies and common Ideals. Separat
ed, they are subject to all the cross cur
rents of the confused politics of a world
of hostile rivalries: united In spirit and
purpose they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This Is Pan-Amerlcanlsm. It has none
of the spirit of empire In It. It is the em
bodiment, the effectual embodiment, of
the spirit of law and Independence and
liberty and mutual service.
There Is, I venture to point out. an espe
cial significance Just now attaching to
this whole matter of drawing the Amer
icas together In bonds of honorable part
nership and mutual advantage because of
the economic readjustments which the
world must Inevitably witness within the
next generation, when peace shall have
at last resumed Its healthful tasks. In
the performance of these tasks I believe
the Americas to be destined to play their
parts together. I am Interested to fix
your attention on this prospect now be
cause unless you take It within your
view and permit the full significance of
It to command your thought I cannot
find the right light In which to set forth
the particular matter that lies at the
very front of my whole thought as I ad
dress you today. I mean national de
fense. , Might to Maintain Right.
Out of such thoughts grow all our poli
cies. We regard war merely as a means
of asserting the rights of a people against
aggression. And we are as fiercely Jeal
ous of coercive or dictatorial power with
in our own nation as of aggression from
without. We will not maintain a stand
ing army except for uses which are as
necessary In times of peace as In times
of war; and we shall always sea to it
that our military peace establishment is
no longer than is actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of days In which
no enemies move against us. But we
do believe In a body of free citizens ready
and sufficient to take careof themselves
and of the governments which they have
set up to serve them. In our constitutions
themselves we have commanded that "the
right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be Infringed," and our
confidence has been that our safety In
times of danger would lie in the rising of
the nation to take care of Itself, as the
farmers rose at Lexington.
But war has never been a mere matter
of men and guns. It is a thing of disci
plined might. If our citizens are ever to
fight effectively upon a sudden summons,
they must know how modern fighting Is
done, and what to do when the summons
comes to render themselves Immediately
available and Immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant In
this matter, must supply them with the
training thev need to take care of them
selves ami of It. The military arm of their
government, which they will not allow to
direct them, they may properly use to
serve them and make their Independence
secure and not their own Independence
merely but the rights also of those with
whom they have made common cause,
should they also be put In Jeopardy.
They must be fitted to play the great
role In the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened ambi
tion to play.
It Is with these Ideals In mind that the
plans of the department of .war for more
adequate national defense were conceive!
which will be laid before you, and which
I urge you to sanction and put Into ef
fect as soon as they can be properly scru
tinized and discussed. They seem to me
the essential first steps, and they seem
to me for the present sufficient.
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army from
AFFECTION THAT NEVER DIES
Old Friends Have a Place In the Heart
From Which They Never Can '
Be Removed.
As to old friends, they are like old
shoes, an abiding comfort and a great
solace. If they have not been tried In
extremity they have been tested by
time and Its mutations, and by the
wear of years. There Is little more
beautiful in human experience than
Jong sustained friendship! between
Its present strength of S.P23 officers and
l02,Mli "iillsted men of all services to a
strength of 7. 1 3rt officers and 131,707 en
listed men, or 141.843, all told, all serv
ices, rank and file, by the addition of 52
companies of coast artillery. 15 com
panies of engineers, ten regiments of in
fantry, four regiments of field artillery,
and four aero squadrons, besides 750 offi
cers required for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all-Important duty
of training the citizen force of which I
shall presently speak, 792 non-commls-sloned
officers for service in drill, reorutt
Ing and the like, and the necessary quota
of enlisted men for the quartermaster
corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance
department and other similar auxiliary
services. These are the additions neces
sary to render the army adequate for Its
present duties, duties which it has to
perform not only upon our own conti
nental coasts and borders and at our In
terior army posts, but also In the Phil
ippines, in, the Hawaiian Islands, at the
Isthmus, and In Porto Rico.
Force of Trained Citizens.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale, should
occasion arise, the plan also contemplates
supplementing the army by a force of
400,000 disciplined citizens, raised In Incre
ments of 133,000 a year throughout a pe
riod of three years. This It Is proposed
to do by a process of enlistment under
which the serviceable men of the coun
try would be asked to bind themselves to
serve with the colors for purposes of
training for short periods throughout
three years, and to come to the colors
at cull at any time throughout an addi
tional "furlough" period of three years.
This force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutrements as fast
as enlisted and their equipment for the
field made ready to be supplied at any
time. They would be assembled for train
ing at stated Intervals at convenient
places In association with suitable units
of the regular army. Their period of
annual training would not necessarily ex
ceed two months In the year.
It would depend upon the patriotic feel
ing of the younger men of the country
whether they responded to such a call
to service or not. It would depend upon
the patriotic spirit of the employers of
the country whether they made it possi
ble for the younger men In their em
ploy to respond under favorable condi
tions or not. I, for one, do not doubt
the patriotic devotion either of our young
msn or of those who give them employ
mentthose for whose benefit and protec
tion they would In fact enlist. I would
look forward to the success of such an
experiment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely Imperative now. We cannot do
less.
Program for the Navy,
The program to be laid before you con
templates the construction within five
years of 10 battleships, 6 battle cruis
ers, 10 scout cruisers, 60 destroyers, 15
fleet submarines, 86 const submarines,
four gunboats, one hospital ship, two
ammunition ships, two fuel-oil ships and
one repnlr ship. It Is proposed that of
this number we shall the first year pro
vide for the construction of two battle
ships, two battle cruisers, three scout
cruisers, 15 destroyers, five fleet subma
rines, 25 coast submarines, two gunboats,
and one hospital ship; the second year,
two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten
deslroyers, four fleet submarines, 15 coast
submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel
oil ship: the third year, two battleships,
one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five
destroyers, two fleet submarines, and 15
coast submarines; the fourth year, two
battleships, two battle cruisers, two
bcoui cruisers, ten uestroyers, two neet
submarines. 15 coast submarines, one am
munition ship, and one fuel-oil ship; and
the fifth year, two battleships, one battle
cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroy
ers, two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma
rines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship
and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy la asking
also for the immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors,
2.50O apprentice seamen, and 1,600 marines.
This Increase would be sufficient to care
for the ships which are to be completed
within the fiscal year 1917 and also for
the number of men which must be put In
training to man the ships which will be
completed early In 1918. It Is also neces
sary that the number of midshipmen at
the naval academy at Annapolis Bhould
be Increased by at least 300 In order that
the force of officers Bhould be more rap
idly added to; and authority Is asked to
appoint for engineering duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
and for service In the aviation corps a
certain number of men taken from civil
life.
If this full program should be carried
out- we should have built or building In
1921, according to the estimates of surviv
al and standards of classification followed
by the general board of the department,
an effective navy consisting of 27 battle
ships of the first line, six battle cruisers,
26 battleships of the second line, ten ar
mored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, five
first-class cruisers, three second-class
cruisers, ten third-class cruisers, 108 de
frayers, 18 fleet submarines. 157 coast sub
marines, six monitors, 20 gunboats, four
supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four trans
ports, three tenders to torpedo vessels,
eight vessels of special types, and two
ammunition ships. This would be a navy
fitted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions
Trade and Shipping.
But armies and Instruments of war are
only part of what has to be considered
If we are to consider the supreme matter
of natlonul self-sufficiency and security
in all Its aspects. There are other great
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There
Is, for example, a very 'pressing question
of trade and shipping Involved in this
great problem of national adequacy. It
Is necessary for many weighty reasons of
women grown far Into the years, for
example, and yet who have maintained
their communion of dreams and con
fidences unbroken and unspoiled.
There Is little more refreshing to con
template than friendships between
middle-aged or old men that have ex
isted In strength and harmony from
boyhood days. Other friendships have
these folks of the passing generation,
some of them true, some of them
tried, but none of them as richly re
garded and highly treasured as th
old ones. For necessarily there are
national efficiency and development that
we should have a great merchant ma
rine. The great merchant fleet we once
used to make us rich, that great body of
sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag
Into every sea, and who were the pride
and often the bulwark of the nation, we
have almost driven out of existence by
Inexcusable neglect and Indifference and
by a hopelessly blind and provincial pol
icy of so-called economic protection. It
Is high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial Independence on
the seas.
For it Is a question of Independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce, our mer
chants, It seems, are at their mercy,
to do with as they please. We must use
their ships, and use them as they deter
mine. We have t.ot ships enough of our
own. We cannot handle our own com
merce on the seas. Our Independence Is
provincial, and Is only on land and with
in our own borders. We are not likely
to he permitted to use even the ships of
other nations In rivalry of their own
trade, and are without means to extend
our commerce even where the doors are
wide open and our goods desired. Such
a situation Is not to be endured. It Is
of capital Importance not only that the
United States should be Its own carrier
on the sens and enjoy the economic In
dependence which only an adequate mer
chant marine would give it, but also that
the American hemisphere as a whole
should enjoy a like Independence and self
sufficiency, If It Is not to be drawn Into
the tangle of Kuropean affairs. Without
such independence the whole question of
our political unity and self-determination
Is very seriously clouded and complicated
Indeed. .
Moreover, we can'develop no true or ef
fective American policy without ships of
our own nqt ships of war, but ships of
peace, carrying goods and carrying much
more: creating friendships and render
ing Indispensable services to all Interests
on this side of the water. They must
move constantly back and forth between
the Americas. They are the only shuttles
that can weave the delicate fabric of
sympathy, comprehension, confidence and
mutual dependence in which we clothe
our policy of America for Americans.
Ships Are Needed.
With a view to meeting these pressing
necessities of our commerce and availing
ourselves at the earliest possible moment
of the present unparalleled opportunity of
linking the two Americas together In
bonds of mutual Interest and service, an
opportunity which may never return
again if we miss It now, proposals will
be made to the present congress for the
purchase or construction of ships to be
owned and directed by the government
similar to those made to the last con
gress, but modified In some essential par
ticulars. I recommend these proposals
to you for your prompt acceptance with
the more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals wero made has made the necessity
for such action more and more mani
festly imperative.
Question of Finance. -'
The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which I have outlined, and for
the general policy of adequate prepara
tion for mobilization and defense. In
volve of course very large additional ex
penditures of money expenditures which
will considerably exceed the -estimated
revenues of the government. It Is made
my duty by law, whenever the estimates
of expenditure exceed the estimates of
revenue to call the attention of the con
gress to the fact and suggest any means
of meeting the deficiency that it may be
wise or possible" for' me to suggest. I am
ready to believe that It would be my duty
to do so In any case; and I feel particu
larly bound to speak of the matter when
It appears that the deficiency will arise
directly out of the adoption by the con
gress of measures which I myself urge
It to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to
speak briefly of the present state of the
treasury and of the fiscal ' problems
which the next year will probably dis
close. On the thirtieth of June last there was
an available balance In the general fund
of the treasury of $104,170,105.78. The to
tal estimated receipts for the year 1916,
on the assumption that the emergency
revenue measure passed by the last con
gress will not be extended beyond Its
present limit, the thirty-first of Decem
ber, 1915, and that the present duty of
one cent per. pound on sugar will be dis
continued after the first of May, 1916.
will be SC70,365,5OO. The balance of June
last and these estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of $774,535,(105.78.
The total estimated disbursements for the
present fiscal year, Including $25,000,000
for the Panama canal, $12,000,100 for probt.
able deficiency appropriations and $"0,
OOO for miscellaneous debt' redemptions,
will be $758,891,000; and the balance In the
general fund of the treasury will be re
duced to $20,644,605.78. The emergency
revenue, act. If continued beyond Its pres
ent time limitation, would produce, dur
ing the half year then remaining, about
forty-one millions. The duty of one cent
per pound on sugar, If continued, would
produce during the two months of the
fiscal year remaining after the first of
May, about fifteen millions. These two
sums, amounting together to $58,000,000,
If added to the revenues of the second
half of the fiscal year, would yjeld the
treasury at the end of the year an avail
able balance of $76,644,605.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have spok
en, would, as at present estimated, be
for the fiscal year 1917, $H3,800.0OO. Those
figures, taken with the figures for the
present fiscal year which I have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
the year 1917.
How shall we obtain the new revenue?
It seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that In what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled to
know Just what burdens of taxation they
are to carry, and to know from the outset,
now. The new bills should be paid by in
ternal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall we turn?
We would be following an almost uni
versal example of modern governments
If we were to draw the greater part Or
even the whole of the revenues we need
from the Income taxes. By somewhat
lowering-the present limits of exemption
and tile figure at which the surtax shall
begin to be Imposed, and by Increasing,
step by step throughout the present grad
uation, the surtax Itself, the Income taxes
as at present apportioned would yield
sums sufficient to balance the books of
the treasury at the end of the fiscal year
1917 without anywhere making the bur
den unreasonably or oppressively heavv.
The precise reckonings are fully and ac
curately set out In the report of the sec
retary of the treasury, which will be Im
mediately laid before you.
And there are many additional sources
many things that occur in a lifetime
which Jar or disturb us, which give a
different turn to our tastes and dispo
sition, which introduce changing ele
ments and predilections into the prob
lems of the day and times of the
present and future can never be the
same as In the long ago. Yet the old
friends remain, possibly not In the
same neighborhood or community
nor in the same part of the country.
But they are ever within the boun
daries of our spiritual vision and they
We enshrined in the sanctuary of the
of revenue which can Justly be teooiNid
to without hampering the Industries ot
the country or putting any too great
charge upon Individual expenditure. A
one per cent tax per gallon on gasoline
and naptha would yield, at the present
estimated production, $10,009,000; a tax of
EO cents per horsepower on automobiles
and Internal explosion engines, $16,000,000;
a stamp tax On bank checks, probably
$18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents per ton on
pig Iron, $10,000,000; a tax of 60 cents per
ton on fabricated iron and steel, proba
bly $10,000,000. In a country of great In
dustries like this It ought to be easy to
distribute the burdens of taxation with
out making them anywhere bear too
heavily or too exclusively upon any one
set of persons or undertakings. What la
clear Is, that the Industry of this gener
ation should pay the bills of this genera
tion. The Danger Within.
I have spoken to you today, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, the thorough' prep
aration of the - nation to care for its
own security and to make sure of entire
freedom to play the Impartial role In this
hemisphere and In the world which we
all believe to have been providentially
assigned to It 1 have had In mind no
thought of any Immediate or particular
danger arising out -of our relations with
other nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there la
reason to hope that no question In con
troversy between this and other govern
ments will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some differ
ences of attitude and policy have been
nnd may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
to say that the gravest threats against
our national peace and safety have been
uttered within our own borders. There are
citizens of the United States, I blush to
admit, born under other flags but welcomed
under our generous naturalization laws
to the full freedom and opportunity of
America, who have poured the poison of
disloyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life; who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our gov
ernment Into contempt, to destroy our In
dustries wherever they thought It effec
tive for their vindictive purposes to strike
at them, and to debase our politics to the
uses of foreign Intrigue. Their number
Is not great as compared with the whole
number of those sturdy hosts by which
our nation has been enriched In recent
generations out of virile foreign stocks;
but it Is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to ffave made
It necessary that we should promptly
make use of processes of law by which
we may be purged of their corrupt dis
tempers. - America never witnessed any
thing like this before. It never dreamed
It possible that men sworn into Its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great free
stocks such as supplied some of the best
and strongest elements of that little, but
how heroic, nation that In a high day of old
staked Its very life to free Itself from
every entanglement that had darkened
the fortunes of the older nations and set
up a new standard here that men of such
origins and such free cholcea ot allegi
ance would ever turn In malign reaction
against the government and people who
had welcomed and nurtured them and
seek to make this proud country once
more a hotbed of European passion. A
little while ago such a thing would have
seemed Incredible. Because It was In
credible we made no preparation for it.
We would have been almost ashamed to
prepare for It, as If we were suspicious
of ourselves, bur own comrades and
neighbors! But the ugly and Incredible
has actually come about and we are with
out adequate federal laws to deal with
It. I urge you to enact such laws at
the earliest possible moment and feel that
In so doing I am urging you to do noth
ing less than save the honor and self
respect of the nation.
Must Be Crushed Out.
Such creatures of passion, disloyalty
and anarchy must be crushed out. They
are not many, but they are Infinitely ma
lignant, and the hand of our power should
close over them at once. They have
formed plots to destroy property, they
have entered into conspiracies against the
neutrality of the government, they have
sought to pry Into every confidential
transaction of the government in order
to serve interests alien to our own. It Is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the terms
In which they may be dealt with,
I wish that it could be said that only a
few men, misled by mistaken sentiments
of allegiance to the governments under
which they were born, had been guilty of
disturbing the self-possession and misrep
resenting the temper and principles of
the country during these days of terrible
war, when It would seem that every man
who was truly an American would In
stinctively make It his duty and his pride
to keep the scales of Judgment even and
prove himself a partisan of no nation but
his own. But It cannot. There are some
men among us, and many resident abroad
who, though born and bred In the Unit
ed States and calling themselves Amer
icans, have so forgotten themselves and
their honor as citizens as to put their
passionate sympathy with one or the oth
er side In the great European conflict
above their regard for the peace and dig
nity of the United States. They also
preach and practice disloyalty. No laws,
t suppose, can reach corruptions of the
mind and heart; but I should not speak
of others without also speaking of these
and expressing the even deeper humilia
tion and scorn which every self-possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them and of the
discredit they are dally bringing upon us.
Transportation Problem. -
The transportation problem is an ex
ceedingly serious and pressing one In this
country. There has from time to time
of late been reason to fear that our rail
roads would not much longer be able to
cope with It successfully as at present
equipped and co-ordinated. I suggest
that it would be wise to provide for a
commission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole question
whether our laws as at present framed
and administered are as serviceable as
they might be In the solution of the prob
lem. It Is obviously a problem that Ilea
at the very foundation of our efficiency
as a people. Such an inquiry ought to
ilraw out every circumstance and opinion
worth , considering and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to
do anything in the field of federal legisla
tion. For what we are seeking now, what In
my mind Is the single thought of this
message. Is national efficiency and se
curity. We serve a great nation. We
should serve It In the spirit of its peculiar
genius. It Is the genius of common men
for self-government, Industry, Justice, lib
erty and peace. We should see to It that
It lacks no Instrument, no facility or vigor
of law, to make It sufficient to play Its
part with energy, safety, and assured
success. In this we are no partisans but
heralds and prophets of a new age.
heart. Without them we should be
lonesome In a crowd, and sometimes
should feel as if we had been aban
doned, though surrounded by our own
household and loved ones. Old
friends. In brief, have a niche all their
own, a position In our affections pe
culiar only to them, which no alien in
fluence may approach. Pittsburgh

WINTER FEEDING SEASON FOR DAIRY COW

.
Cows Are Easily Cared
(By W. MILTON KELLY.)
Oat . straw is not generally recog
nized as a valuable food for dairy
cows; yet if given in reasonable
amounts every two or three days they
will clean it up with a relish, whereas
if given them exclusively as a roughage
they will, push it over the manger and
become as thin as a string of shad.
We have seen the weak, emaciated,
straw-fed cow that had to be helped
on her feet each morning in the early
spring, and If grass growing was de
layed too long the only pay she could
give-' for her winter'tt feed was her
hide. Yet well-feu dairy cows relish
a light feeding of br6ht oat straw
after a big mess of corn sllagt) every
few days.
Feed experts tell us It Is too much
work for the cows to get the nour
ishment that Is in the straw, ar.d the
weak, emaciated condition of the
straw-fed cows in the spring substan
tiates the claim; but that Is not the
whole story.
Every observing feeder knows that,
except in rare cases, the roughage
grown on his farm Is the cheapest
part of the dairy cow's ration, and
also that the dairy cow 13 especially
built to handle large quantities of
roughage.
If the roughage part of a ration is
made up largely of clover or alfalfa
hay and ensilage, with a little oats
and pea hay, corn stover and other
roughage feeds, we may utilize rough
age to make up three-fourths of the
dry matter of the ration, and the cows
will come out in the best of condition
the next spring, and we will secure the
best profits In dollars.
Heavy grain feeding may make a
better showing on a milk sheet, but
not in the net profits, except with
those dairy farmers who live near by
desirable markets, where they can sell
their hay and dairy products for ex
tremely high prices. If the roughage
is tough and fibrous the proportion of
concentrates must be larger.
Just how much roughage a cow
should be given at a feeding depends
in a great measure upon her capacity
to handle it profitably. About twenty
pounds of dry matter may be derived
from a good variety of roughage, and
from six to ten pounds of the concen
trates. With these proportions in mind, and
with a table giving the digestible nu
trients of the various other materials
used In feeding, It should not be

What Kind Is Needed.
A difficult problem on the American
farm is to decide how much and what
kind of machinery should be pur
chased. Some farms are so overs
stocked with machinery that the de
preciation, interest and repairs eat
up much of the profits.
Assuming the average depreciation
on machinery at 10 per cent, and the
interest on the money Invested at 6
per cent, we have an average yearly
expense of approximately $13 on each
$100 invested in machinery. A man
who has $1,600 worth of machinery
would have $195 expense on this alone
in interest and depreciation. If his
work could be done with half this
amount, he could save $97.50. This
would be equivalent to the Interest on
$1,625 at 6 per cent
A farm of 80 acres cannot profita
bly use four-horse machinery because
three horses should do the work on
a farm of this size. In buying ma
chinery too large in proportion to the
size of the farm unnecessary expense
is added. This comes not only in the
increased cost of machinery but also
In the maintenance of any extra"
horses required. 77
Practice of Burning Straw,
The practice of burning straw is
far too common on farms. Many farm
ers do not realize the true value of
the straw stack. The fertilizing value
of the straw from a ten-acre wheat
field is from $25 to $40. If the straw

troublesome to make up rations that
will give good and profitable returns.
The various feeding tables are valu

suitable rations for our cows; but un
less we study the individual needs of
our cows and try to approximate
them, we are sure to be disappointed
in the results. A ration may be nearly

entiflc standpoint, but if it is not pal
atable the cows cannot give their best
returns.
The wide variety of commercial by
product dairy feeds on the market
makes it very important that dairy
farmers devote attention and study to
making up palatable and healthy ra
tions.
In all of our home-grown grain
feeds the proportion of pure food nu
triments is associated with the crude
fiber in such a way as to make them
healthy and palatable for our animals.
The manufacturer, on the other hand,
removes more or less of one or more
of these nutriments, which, therefore,
leaves the proportion of the constitu
ents and the resultant feed decidedly
unbalanced, and It must be fed care
fully and with other products,' if safe
or profitable returns are to be ob
tained. No man can formulate hard-and-fast
rules to govern dairymen in determin
ing how much purchased grain they
should feed. If he secures the best
profits from his cows, he should raise
nearly a balanced ration on his own
farm. If his farm needs fertilizer he
can usually increase his crop yields by
the feeding ot purchased grain feeds.
Of course he Is working at a losing
game if he feeds the purchased or
home-grown feed to poor cows.
I have found in my dairy practice
that by having plenty of corn silage,
clover and alfalfa', tfnd oats and peas,
I have done as much as possible to
supply my cows with a balanced ra
tion of home-grown foods.
Many dairy experts tell us to grow
various proteinaceous forage and fod
der crops, but my judgment is that it
seldom pays a dairy farmer to grow
other than a few of the standard feed
crops for his cows.
I have had very good success with,
soy beans, and find them an exceed
ingly valuable crop to grow on certain
portions of my farm; but I would not
give up growing clover, alfalfa and
corn and take chances with a crop of
soy beans.
TIME FOR CULLING
OF POULTRY FLOCK
Old Hens That Have Ceased to
Be Productive Should Be
Sent to City Markets.
Now that the old hens have ceased,
to be productive the farmer should be
gin a systematic culling of his poul
try flock. All hens not to be held over
for next year r" ould be sold. While
the cost of keeping hens is seldom
realized, they are eating valuable food.
This expense with no production is
cutting down the profits. Hens are
rarely profitable producers after they
are two years old according to H. L.
Kempster of the University of Mis
souri college of agriculture. All old
hens, especially those which bag down
or "crop" behind, should be sent to
the market. This year's young stock
should be marked with leg bands, toe
marks or otherwise so that next year
the age of the hen will be known.
Hens in laying condition will have
bright red combs and will show their
pin bones well spread apart. This test
is a sure indication. The pin bones
are located Just above the vent. If
three or four inches apart the hen is
probably laying. These points will
assist materially In culling out the un
profitable producers.
Roost and Nest Boxes.
The proper height for roosts are
about two feet from the ground. Th
dropping board platform should be
about six inches below the roosts. In
is better to have the nest boxes at an
other part of thepen, about a foot
or two above ground. Placing them
under the roosts gives biding place
for rats and mice back of the nests,
and besides the fowls while scratch

nests when the Utter Uf placed oa
