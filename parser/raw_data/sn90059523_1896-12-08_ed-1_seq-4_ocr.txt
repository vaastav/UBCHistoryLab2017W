THE MESSAGE.
President Cleveland's last communi
cation to congress is marked by the
strong patriotism which has grown
■with his services to his country. It has
breadth of view, strength of convic
tion and a wonderful earnestness of
purpose. It is marred by the habit
Into which all presidents have fallen
too easily of making their messages
mere summaries of information that
should be sought in department reports.
Its dramatic interest is somewhat les
sened by the publication a few weeks j
ago of the settlement of the Venezuelan
question and the preparations for a
general arbitration agreement, and by
the understanding that the Monroe
doctrine would be declared to extend
to Cuba, in as far as interference by
any power other than ourselves would
be concerned These would have been
sensational features if they had ap
peared first in such a state paper. Now,
they come as records of an achieve
ment which, though already past, will
make this administration the greatest
In our history as far as relates to the
conduct of our foreign affairs.
That portion of the message which
will be read with greatest interest deals
with the Cuban question. It appears
that the United States government
made overtures to Spain some time
ago to secure for Cuba such a degree of
local autonomy as would satisfy the de
mands of her people without requir
ing too great a sacrifice of dignity at
Madrid. It is hinted that this offer,
while not then accepted, is coming to
be regarded with more favor; and there
is also mention of the possibility of a
purchase by this country, in case Spain
should be found willing to sell. But
beyond this the administration has
found no way out of its embarrass
ments and is not able to indicate any
to congress. This rises from the fact,
■which Mr. Cleveland makes plainer
than it has ever been made before, that
there exists no government in Cuba
today of any party or faction or na
tionality. There is military rule in
the little area within the Spanish
camps. There is guerrilla rule in the
country occupied by the insurgents,
constantly on the move. But the last
vestige of civil authority has disap
peared, and both contestants are now
occupied in laying waste every living
thing on the island. To this we be
lieve that an end should be put. There
are duties to humanity which rise
paramount even to those which we owe
to the other nations of the world. We
recognize the immense difficulty of
dealing with this case and the caution
and wisdom of the administration; but
we believe that the time has come to
put an end to the bloody business go
ing forward in Cuba and to prevent the
future desolation which the message it
self shows to be inevitable, by any
measures that may be necessary. God
cave us from war, but God save us
first from dishonor is the right petition
for every nation.
We have no space to touch here upon
the portions of the message that deal
■with the condition o f the various
branch.es of the public service, the im
provements that have been made and
the recommendations that are laid be
fore congress. They are more or less
familiar, and are almost wholly rou
tine. When he reaches the questions of
revenue and currency, Mr. Cleveland
again assumes the high patriotic tone
*hat marks the man. That congress is
pure to plunge us into a new tariff agi
*Btion does not prevent him from point
ing out the superfluity and the cruelty
•f such a step. And that congress has
In the past refused to make a begin
ning of currency reform and has had
tils suggestions before It for the last
Sfour years, only emphasizes the earn-
Wtness with which he makes this last
fcppeal. The greenbacks should be re
tired; either by the issue of bonds or
p>y the more gradual process of refus
ing to reissue them when redeemed.
,(The Sherman notes could well be re
'Jleemed in silver dollars in that event,
'fchese financial changes would at least
relieve us from the most pressing dan
gers; and, as the president says, the
fear of currency contraction is* the
idlest of them all. With the progress
of commercial growth we need less
rather than more money; and the gain
to the country in importations of specie
would at least offset the loss.
With these important suggestions
Mr. Cleveland closes the message which
marks the end of eight years of such
loyal, intelligent and disinterested
service of the people as it is seldom
their good fortune to secure. It is a
document full of business and destitute
of politics; full of public concern and
silent as to private interest; breathing
from beginning to end the spirit of ]
fidelity to public duty which has made
this man so great and so dear to the
hearts of the American people. Like
Mr. Cleveland himself, the message
will rank not by its eloquence or the
qualities that strike the eye, but by
loyal and manly solicitude for this
mighty nation and the future welfare
of its people.
m
THE COUNTRY WILL NOT STAND IT.
In an authorized interview with Mr.
Hanna, sent out by the press the other
day, he is reported as using this lan
guage:
The truth is, our currency matters are in
pretty good shape. I think. There is nothing
alarming about the currency question. There
is no question about the Republicans of the
West wanting a conservative tariff bill passed
by congress.
This represents quite faithfullly, we
believe, the prevailing attitude of the
Republican party on the issues now be
fore the country. We want to say to
them right here and now that it will
not do; that they are taking the surest
course to offend and outrage those by
whose votes they were returned to
power; and that if the tariff question
is taken up and the currency question
let alone they will be beaten as badly
as they deserve. Before the 4th day of
last November we heard of nothing
but the money question. Since that we
have heard of nothing but the tariff
question. The most that the partisan
Republican asserted about election
time was that the tariff "also ran."
We cannot say that those who insist
now that the Republican majority has
a right to go over the tariff schedules
are illogical, however ill-advised and
outrageous we may consider their ac
tion to be. But we do say that when
they make tariff revision the sole end
and object of their victory, and pre
pare to send to the rear the all-im
portant question of currency revision,
they are traitors to their trust.
The one thing which the people of
this country decided a month ago is
that our currency affairs are not in
good shape. If they had been, if our
system were anything less than the
dangerous makeshift that it is, the re
cent campaign would have been fought
on far other lines. It is because the
greenbacks are outstanding that we
have had bond issues and runs upon
the treasury. It is because we have
no consistent principle and no sound
basis for our monetary system that the
free silver theory obtained so general
a hearing. Whatever the people may
have thought or intended to do about
the tariff at the last election, and what
ever warrant the Republican party
may feel in changing the duties, there
is and can be no question about the
command which it received from the
people to revise our currency system
and make it In harmony with sound
ideas. Yet here is Mr. Hanna, presum
ably representative of his party and
close to its president-elect, who seems
to confirm the fears felt of Mr. Mc-
Kinley's soundness and earnestness
long ago. Mr. Hanna says that we
may get along pretty well with the cur
rency as it is.
Neither the country nor the Republi
can party can afford to occupy that po
sition for one moment. If that Is to be
the financial policy of the new admin
istration, a policy of let-alone, a pol
icy of maintaining our wretched patch
work as it is, a policy of hoping that
another crisis will not come for four
years, a policy of delay and coward-
Ice, then we can say to Mr. McKinley
and to Mr. Hanna as the agitated man
in the congregation said to the revival
ist who pictured the torments of the
lake of fire and brimstone, that "the
American people will not stand it."
-^.
GAMBLING GOING ON.
The Globe is In receipt of a com
munication concerning the nickel-in
the-slot machines, from whose vitu
perative spirit and language it might
hazard a guess that the writer is one
of those who share in the "rake-off."
He contends that gambling machines
are not now in vogue here, and
that those referred to by the Globe
are instruments of commerce, whose
function it is to assist In the sale of
cigars and other commodities. In this
he is entirely mistaken. The Globe
was particularly careful in Its investi
gations to give the police force of St.
Paul something to go upon in their
Herculean efforts to cleanse the morals
of this city, to discriminate between
the nickel-in-the-slot machine of com
merce and its foster brother of the
gambling trade. There are hundreds
of these machines in different parts of
the city, where chewing gum and
sweetmeats and cigars and even per
fumery can be had by dropping the
designated coin in the slot. There Is
no objection to these, nor has anybody
thought of raising one. But a machine
in which, if the coin that you deposit
goes one way you win several cigars,
and if it goes another way you lose
your money and get nothing, is a
straight gambling device.
That is the obvious fact of the mat
ter, and it is not worth while to try
to disguise it. The description In the
G 1 o b c's article, which we commend
once more to our extremely vigilant
police department, covers only the ma
chines of this character. Not one of
those referred to is attached to com
mercial enterprise, but in every one
the element of chance predominates.
Whether you will get much for little, or
something for nothing, you cannot tell
until your money has been deposited
in the machine. We expected to call
down, by such exposure, the wrath of
those who profit from this petty, but
none the less vicious form of gambling,
and to have just this excuse offered for
the restoration here of the pernicious
HHK SAgEr PA^H, QIWI^: /fUESBXY, DECEMBER 8, 1808.
slot machine. That was guarded |
against carefully, and neither the I
mayor nor the persons who may be
engaged in this profitable transaction
nor those who have interests in these
machines can plead the baby act. It
is straight gambling and nothing less,
as far as the machines which we have
referred to are concerned, and to that
extent this administration tolerates and
shelters a form of this vice which has
not even the merit of boldness. It is
a particularly disgusting form of de
bauchery and well fitted to associate
with the collection of trifling financial
tributes from social outcasts. There are
men who are such strangers to any
form of greatness that even their
vices are sordid and mean,
NAILED AGAIN.
St. Paul, not being satisfied with an ap
propriation of a million dollars for a new
capitol building, will endeavor to have that
amount increased at the coming session of
the legislature. The Austin Transcript truly
says: "The first appropriation was voted on
the solemn pledge that no additional ap
propriation should be made," and this pledge
should be lived up to in every sense of the
word and every member voting to increase
the appropriation should be branded for future
remembrance. — Mapleton Enterprise.
We propose to nail this particular lie
every time that we catch it in print.
The time has now come when we can
not call it by any milder name. It was
reasonable to suppose for a while, after
a Minneapolis paper had scattered it
broadcast through the state, that local
newspapers might be imposed upon
and really believe that St. Paul had
some such project in mind. But there
is no excuse for such ignorance now,
and it is not easy to find any motive,
except the bald desire to abuse this
city, without regard to either truth or
justice, in circulating a statement
which has been repeatedly and official
ly denied.
We will say once more that nobody
has entertained an idea of adding one
dollar to the appropriation for capital
purposes. Whoever makes that state
ment from this time on simply brands
himself with the most unpleasant and
least bearable epithet known to the
English language.
m
AT THE THEATERS.
"A little more than kin and less than
kind." "The rest is silence." Between these
two speeches— the first and last that Hamlet
uttered — lies a world of poetry and philosophy,
"one entire and perfect chrysolite" of sub
lime mentality. An eminent Shakespearean
scholar has well said that Hamlet is the his
tory of a man's mind. A monologue rather
than a tragedy of action, a creation, for the
student rather than the playgoer seeking en
tertainment at the theater, nevertheless its
potent charm casts a spell over all brought
within its mystic atmosphere. Even the blase
theatergoer, who has ceased to attend perform
ances of Hamlet, remembers the time when
he yielded to the influence of the immortal
work, if he had the good fortune to see the
central figure interpreted by an actor who
breathed the spirit of the great poet's creation.
Thus it is that the assumption of this role
by any player capable of givng it a reason
ably acceptable portrayal is always fraught
with more than passing interest.
So the appearance of Walker Whiteslde in
the character of the melancholy Dane at the
Metropolitan opera house last night is an
event that all lovers of the histrionic art feel
an interest in, whether they admire the
player's interpretation or disapprove of it.
It is doubtful if any actor of good parts,
adapted, of course, to the serious Shake
spearean roles, can absolutely fail in Hamlet.
Hamlet is so many sided and his moods so
varying, that the character affords the broad
est scope for the revelation of traits of human
nature. The player who might fail to impart
to the passionate speeches the true ring
might deliver the reflective soliloquies with
classic finish or conduct the quiet colloquies
in a natural and spontaneous manner.
There is much to commend In Mr. White
side's Hamlet. Like the actor, it has ap
parently grown, since he appeared here in
the role some four years ago. There is less
of the elocutionist and more of the actor in
Mr. Whiteside, than was observed upon his
?previous visit. Further progress in the
same direction should be his watchword, for
at times the elocutionist still overshadows
the actor. Mr. Whiteside is an excellent
reader. His emphasis, the result of intelli
gent thought, is effective and nearly always
correct. An occasional oversight was notice
able, however, and in such cases the point of
a speech would be lost. The dissatisfying
quality of Mr. Whiteside's Prince of Den
mark is a lack of the manly dignity,
combined with the Introspective spirit, that
so distinguishes Hamlet and sets him apart
from ordinary men. It is a fault of person
ality, rather than a lack of sympathy with
or understanding of the character. Mr.
Whiteside's physique places limitations upon
him, which can scarcely be overcome or ef
faced. One is ever conscious of this. His is
a graceful figure though, and every action is
easy and responsive to the sentiment or emo
tion of the moment. His gestures are ex
pressive to a degree, and his countenance
mobile, though the features can scarcely be
recognized as those of an ideal Hamlet
Mr. Whiteside excelled in the delivery of
the soliloquies and in the closet scene. The
latter was marred by the introduction of in
cidental music by the orchestra, which ef
fectually obscured the words of Shakespaare,
a most unpardonable sacrilege. The "To be
or not to be" soliloquy would have proved
far more effective If spoken from a point
nearer the footlights. In the colloquy with
Polonius, Mr. Whiteside glided over some of
the subtler points, reading the short speeches
in a hard and too matter-of-fact style. His
scene with the ghost was more effective
than that of the recent Hamlets witnessed
here. And in this connection it should be
said that Charles Herman's delivery of the
ghost's lines far surpassed that of the players
who essayed this role with Alexander Salvinl
and Otis Skinner. Mr. Whiteside was not
impressive enough in the graveyard scene, and
rather slighted the "Alas, poor Yorick"
speech and those immediately following. His
death scene was effective. Throughout the
play, Mr. Whiteside demonstrated his orig
inality in introducing commendable bits of
business indicating that he is not a slave to
tradition in trifling details. Glancing at his
father's picture, as Hamlet exclaims, "What
a piece of work is man," seemed entirely
natural, even if it was not necessary. An
undoubted charm of Mr. Whiteside's Hamlet
is its youth.
The supporting company 1b uneven. Charles
Herman, who played the king as well as the
ghost, acquitted himself most creditably, ex
cellent actor that he is. The Laertes of Her
bert Pattee was likewise a commendable im
personation. J. L. Saphore was satisfactory
as the first gravedigger, but his Polonius was
far from pleasing.
Tonight Mr. Whiteside will present his
superb production of "Merchant of Venice."

WILL Bl'V TWE LASD.
County Comml M ioaen Know a Bur-
Khlb When They See It.
Mayor Domn treated- the county com
missioners to a little pyrotechnics yes
terday. When it was all over the mem
bers went right ahead with what they
had in mind, when the mayor exploded.
The- question was that of expending
$20,360 for tne purchase of 50.90 acres
of land for an acquisition to' Phalen
park.
The mayor was absent when the ses
sion began and a large amount of rou
tine business was disposed of with
Commissioner Kellerman in the chair.
Then the proposed purchase of land
came up and Mayor Doran was sent
for. - '
The recommendation for the pur
chase of the property was pursuant to
a request of the park board some time
ago, as it was needed to complete the
lake frontage of Phalan park. The
land Is outside the city limits and, as
it could not be acquired by the park
board, the county commissioners were
petitioned to buy it in. The matter
was referred to the committee on roads
and bridges, comprising the entire
beard, with the exception of the chair
man, and after Investigation it was de
cided to recommend favorably to the
purchase, though this action was de
ferred until yesterday, owing to the
tangle in which the board of public
works became involved, the meeting
being the first subsequent to the su
preme court decision effecting the
board of public works.
When the mayor put in appearance he
at once entered objections to the pur
chase, questioned the desirability of
the entire Phalan park plan and de
clared that he did not propose to sanc
tion the purchase and would stop it if
he could. There was a decided unan
imity among the members of the board
with regard to acquiring the land, and,
after listening patiently to the mayor's
arraignment, followed by an attempt
to argue him into their way of think
ing, they voted to make the purchase
regardless of Mayor Doran's refusal
to change his convictions. The mayor
was the only who voted against the
resolution on its passage.
The purchase of the land at $400 an
acre is regarded as a bargain. It ad
joins the city limits and is desirable
property to have. E. W. Bazille said
after the meeting very little property,
if any, that lay as close to the city as
that could be purchased for that
money.
In addition to auditing a number of
bills, the board appointed W. H. Hoyt
to attend the distribution of funds,
provided for tlhe burial of deceased
soldiers, in place of Capt, Stees. Au
thority was also given the county sur
veyor to purchase 100 stone blocks to
mark section and quarter-section cor
ners, to cost not more than 75 cents
each.
GAVE (iROVER A CHANCE.
Chamber of Commerce Deferred
Currency Commission Resolu
tions.
The committee of the cham
ber of commerce which has
had under consideration the
subject of the removal of the
Minnesota Packing and Provision com
pany to New Brighton made a brief
report disposing of tihe subject for the
present, as follows:
Your committee report that they, with a
committee ol the jobbers' union, had inter
views with the officials of nearly all the rail
roads interested in the transfer company,
and the situation was freely and fully dis
cussed. All the officials manifested a disposi
tion to take no steps that were in any way
inimical to St. Paul's interests, and the com
mittee were encouraged to believe that for the
present, at least, ho change would be made
in the existing arrangements. At the special
meeting of the transfer company, a proposi
tion for the purchase of the New Brighton
stock yards was submitted and was referred ,
to a committee of three directors, to examine
and report upon at a subsequent meeting to be
held on the 2d of February.
Kenneth Clark signed the report, as
chairman.
A communication from the Twin City
Guardian, touching the department
stores, was referred to the mercantile
committee.
The banking committee, to which had
been referred the monetary resolution
of Rose Clarke, made his resolution
their report on the subject of a curren
cy commission.
E. V. Smalley told of the Indianapolis
conferences.
W. B. Dean opposed the currency
commission idea. The president would
dictate its findings, and congress was
able to settle it. Action was deferred
until next week.
The committee on legislation re
ported in favor of the Frye bill for
the establishment of a federal depart
ment of commerce.
The chamber decided not to recom
mend any change in the presidential
term.
A report of the committee on streets,
roads and parks called attention to the
convention of wheelmen to be held at
the Ryan, Dec. 22, and recommended
that a delegation of five be appointed
to attend the convention. The report
was adopted. The convention will urge
among other things the appointment
of a state commissioner of roads.
LABOR'S BUSY NIGHT.
Several Committee Meetings Called
for This Evening:
The building trades' council of the trades
and labor assambly will meet this evening
to make preparations for carrying out the
recommendations suggested by it to the
trade's assembly at the "last meeting of that
body and which were concurred in. The chief
of these is to take such steps as are neces
sary to Induce architects and builders to insert
in specifications a proviso that union labor
only should be employed, and to this end a
communication will be addressed to them de
scribing the advantages of such a course.
Some needed legislation will be discussed,
with a view of securing through such means
a more satisfactory condition in the building
inspector's office, the board desiring that each
deputy be a practical and competent me
chanic. Selection of officers will also be
made.
The committee making arrangements to re
ceive the delegates to the state federation of
labor, the committee on instructions to the
trades and labor assembly's delegation, and
the free text book committee will also meet
this evening. The latter, which consists of
John F. Krieger, E. B. Lott. M. E. Murray,
Harry Franklin and James Morrow, will take
the necessary action to bring the free text
book proposition properly before the confer,
ence committee when it meets to prepare the
budget for next year.

BOERNER CHECKED THEM UP.
Aronnd Yesterday Noting the Nlclcel
in-the-Slot Machines.
Lieut. Boerner went around town yester
day with a little book and pencil in his pocket.
He was checking up; the O1 o b c's report
about the places where nickel-in-the-slot ma
chines were in use last Saturday. Some, of
the places he founff'had removed the ma
chines, but the 1 majority of them were still
within easy reach of anybody who desired to
try the game. Sunday night one of the of
ficers in citizen's ciothes, so it was quietly
told at the central station yesterday, received
instructions to drop into some of the places
and tell the proprietors to put the machines
out of sight for a few days. Whether he
did as ordered Is not known, but, as stated
heretofore, a number of them had disap
peared. It was not learned whether Lieut.
Boerner called at any of the other places
than those mentioned Sunday morning or not.
If he didn't, he overlooked some. It is pre
sumed that the lieutenant was gathering the
information for the mayor.
WASTED TO TRAVEL.
Mrs. Casey Went to Chicago Instead

and, having the price of a ticket to Chicago,
went there. Her husband telegraphed the

PURPI^E AND OLD GOL.D.
Royal Raiment o* a New Ice Carni
val Club.
The Twentieth Century club last night held
a special meeting and decided to put a hand
somely uniformed carnival' marching club
in the field at an early date. The uniform
of the club will be in old gold arid royal
purple and will be one of the handsomest
yet planned. It is thought the club will
be on parade about forty strong in a week
A meeting will be held Wednesday evening
in the club rooms in the Arrol block, East
Fourth street
The Aurora Carnival club was organized
Saturday night at Jarosz's hall with the fol
lowing officers: President, John Hints; first

White; assistant secretary. Frank Rosenthal;
treasurer, Joseph Jarosz. The club starts out
with a membership of forty. The next regu
lar meeting will be held Wednesday evening,
Dec. 9, at 8 o'clock, at Jarosz's hall.
A great deal of work is being done in ar
ranging for the parade of the carnival clubs
Thursday evening of this week. The inter
est, however, paints to a parade that will
fully compensate for all the labor spent
thereon.
Work will probably be begun on the foun
dation of the ice parthenon within a week.
Among the side features which have been
suggested for the carnival are horse and dog
shows.
A change has been made by the board of
directors In the entrance to the grounds,
which will probably be from the foot of
Jackson street, instead of Sibley street. Jack
son street passes directly in front of the west
end of the grounds, and there the main en
trance will be established, unless a change
la made in the order \t things. A stairway
will be built from the south end of the Robert
street bridge to the ice below to furnish ac
cess to the grounds for those living on that
side of the river. It may be that an elevator
will be built at the same point to take peo
ple from the ice to the street above. No one
will be allowed to go down on the elevator.
There are fifty-eight columns in the build
ing. These are six feet in diameter, nine
teen feet in circumference and about sixty
feet high. The Inside dimensions of the
Parthenon are 110 by 132; main skating rink
200 by 500; hockey rink, 60 by 200; polo and
foot ball rinks, 250 by 350.

PARK BOARD RBCBITSS PLANS FOR}
THE PROPOSED WEST SIDE
BOULEVARD.
COST ESTIMATED AT $25,000.
MATTER REtFSRRED TO THE COVTTm
CIL FOR TH-KIR. FURTHER
CONSIDERATION.
ESTIMATE* FOR 1807 SUBMITTED.
This Bra mli of the Government
"Will Aalt fop $57,000 for Next
Year— Its Proposed Use.
Plans were submitted at a meeting
of the park board last evening for a
pleasure drive or pathway to be laid
out on the bluff along the bank of tha
river in West St. Paul. The proposed
driveway will start at Terrace park at
the Intersection of Delos and Hall
avenue and follow Prospect street
along the edge of the bluff to Isabtl
and Ohio streets, thence to Cherokee
avenue and along that avenue and th 9
bluff to the Smith avenue bridge. Tha
driveway will be about one and one
fourth miles In length and at various
points along the route will be small
"parks. The pathway will be from 100
to 125 feet wide and the probable cost
is estimated at $25,000.
There were two plans submitted, ona
from the city engineer which brings
the driveway to an abrupt termination
at Isabel and Ohio streets. This is
owing to the fact that the Yoerg
Brewing company own a block ot
ground at Ohio street and the river,
and as the brewing plant* and other
improvements were considered so
valuable that the city engineer did
not prepare plans further than this
poirit.
Supt. Nussbaumer, however, had an
other plan which provided for tha
ravine at the brewery being bridged
and the driveway continued to the
higii bridge as mentioned above.
Supt. Nussbaumer was of the opinion
that the entire Improvement would be
made at a cost of about $25,000, but the
commissioners were of the opinion that
the plan of the superintendent would
involve the expenditure of at least
that sum to secure the block owned by
the Yoerg company. The improvement
if made would have to be paid for
by the property owners of the West
side, as there are no funds in the hands
of the park board which could be
drawn upon for any of the expense.
Supt Nuasbaumer, with the plans, BUb
mitted a report calling attention to
the fact that all the properties of the
city designated as parks were on this
side of the river, and pointing out the
natural and picturesque beauties of the
proposed parkway. He suggested in
his report that the proposed driveway
could be extended at some future time
along the river and form a system of
most beautiful drives.
The plans and report of the superin
tendent were accepted and accompa
nied by a resolution will be forwarded
to the council to be considered by that
body. If the council should think well
of the proposed improvement, the mat
ter will be referred to the board of
public works to make a report as to
the detailed cost of the parkway and
the amount necessary to be assessed
in order to carry out the plan.
The pay roll amounting to $821.59
was allowed and claims to the amouni
of $180 were ordered paid.
President Wheelock extended an In
vitation to the members to attend thq
meeting of the conference committeg
on Monday next. The estimate of tha
board for 1897 will be presented to th«
conference committee and as now madfl
up, will ask for $57,000. Of this amount,
$26,000 is to be used in park maintain
ance and the balance in improvements,
Of the sum to be used for improve
ments if the full amount asked for la
allowed, $8,000 will be used in dredging
at Lake Como, $4,000 for improving
parks In the Midway district, $5,000 fot
improving Indian Mound park and
a like amount for new pump and pump-
Ing station and extending water mama
In Como.
REPORT NOT CREDITED.
No Credence In Humor That Arch
bishop Ireland Had Failed.
A rumor was current in St. Paul yesterday
that Archbishop Ireland had made an assign
ment. Nothing in the shape of a deed of as
signment made its appearance in the dis
trict court clerk's office, and the report waa
generally discredited wherever it was men
tioned. A reporter tor the Globe called at
tha residence of the archbishop last even-
Ing, but that gentleman had retired. Hia
private secretary, however, said it waa prob
ably only a renewal of a similar report which
gained circulation some months ago but which,
of course, was untrue.
