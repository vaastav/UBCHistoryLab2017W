enterprise, with only such deduc
tions as may be his share toward
the careful and economical mainte

tect" him, it is plain that the exac
tion of more than this is indefensi
ble extortion, and a culpable betray
al of American fairness, and justice."

following the law in the expendi
ture of pub'io funds cling to him.

A Kentuckiaii in Trouble
.LoulsvilleljiAiiiuerolal. '
Col. Thos. D. Marcum, of Ken
tucky, who was recently appointed
an Indian Inspector, hits been at
tacked rather viciously by an ob
scure Kansas paper. He is alao
scored by Mr. Charles E. Kincaid, a
Washington correspondent. The
particulars of the charges that have
been filej ngajns-t him in the Inte
rior Department are not given. Mr.
Kincaid denounces him as "an illit
erate libertine," which would indi
cate that Col. Murcum's grammar
is bad, and th?(t tljere is a woman
in the case.
Col. Marcum was editor pftlje
Catlettsburg Democrat before his
appointment. For a number of
years he wus Register of the. Land
Office. No one ever accused Tom
Marcum of bpjng a brilliant man,
but he has his jrjends in this State
who believe that he ought tfl have
a hearing before he js condemned.
He has a wife and a fuiuily, and
thpy deserve tome consideration
even at the hands ol his political
enemies. What has he done? If
he '8 guilty of any heinous crime,
he ought to be removed from office,
If he is innocent, he is entitled to
have his say. Col. Marcum js
some distance from home, and it
is only fair (hat the puliljp verdict
be suspended until he can defend
himself from his assailants. .
