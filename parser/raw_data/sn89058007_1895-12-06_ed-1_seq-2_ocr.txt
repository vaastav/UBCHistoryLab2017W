If Thos. B. Heed's speech in ac
eetitinrr the position of speaker of
-1 1
the House is indicative of tne course
to be pursued by the republicans du
ring the present session of congress,
no business of any consequence will
be transacted. In the lower House
the republicans have 140 majority,
and if the do nothing policy is adop
ted, it will be as Col. Patterson sta
ted, an indorsement of democratic
legislation. The President in his
message has assured congress of his
willingness to cooperate with it in
any measure for the relief of the
country. If the republican party
is desirous of such legislation, it can
not expect an indorsement without
a
Meriting it.
The Fifty-fourth Congress con
vened last Monday at noon. The re
publicans organized the lower
A '
house by the election of Thos. B.
Heed, of Maine, speaker; McDow
ell, ot Pennsylvania, clerk; Glenn,
of New York, doorkeeper; Russell,
of Missouri, scrgcant-at-arms; Mc
Elroy, of Ohio, postmaster; Rev.
Mr. Couden, of Michigan, chaplain.
Something concerning the salaries
of these officials may be of interes
iust now. hence we copy the fol
0 '
lowing from a Springfield, Mass
paper:
The clerk of the National House
of Representatives has a salary of
15.000 a year, and has something
over forty subordinates for whom
he is responsible. His principal as
sistant has a salary of $3,000. The
sercreant-at-arms has a salary of
14,500 and is obliged to furnish
bond of 150,000, while the clerk's
bond is $20,000. The sergcant-at
arras is the disbursing ollicer of the
house, its peace officer and master
of ceremonies. He has assistants,
one of whom is paid $3,000, and ap
points a portion of the capital olice.
The doorkeeper is paid $3,500, and
has a large force under him, inclu
dine the elevator men, pages and
employes in the document room.
The postmaster has only $2,500,
and has an assistant and several em
ployes, while the chaplain only gets
5900, and has nothing to do but
make a prayer at the opening of
each session.
The history of the country proves
that democracy is not wedded to
any particular ratio. In 1792 the
ratio of 15 to 1 was fixed while
Thomas Jefferson was Secretary
of State, and the ratio of
10 to 1 Mas established in 1834,
while Jackson was president. Thus
it is shown that at each time when
the change was made the object in
view was to cause the legal ratio to
be on equality with the commercial
value of the two metals. No other
policy was ever advocated until the
assembling in convention ot repre
Bentatives oi tne peoples' party in
1892, when a platform was adopted
declaring for free coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1. Since then
the refrain has been taken up by the
new school of democrats who claim
to.be in unison with the policy ad
vocated by Jefferson in regard to
the financial question. But if the
establisher of the democratic party
had been an adherent of the princi
ple advocated by the 16 to 1 silver-
ites, he would not in 1792 agreed to
the ratio of 15 to 1, but instead de-

TnE President's
message
to the
in his
54th Congress was written
w - -
usual lucid and happy style, and
shows a breadth of information on
subjects treated. The message is
devoted principally to foreign rela
tions and the currency, though its
author did not fail to show that he
is as much opposed to the republi
can doctrine of protection as he has
always been. It is evident that no
attempt will be made to plunge this
country in a war without just
grounds for doing so, therefore the
predictions of his enemies that he
would attempt to bring about hos
tilities between this country and
England to secure a third term is
proven to be unfounded. As the
means of preventing drains on the
gold reserve, the President recom
mends the retirement of greenbacks
and Sherman notes, and in order to
prevent a contraction of the curren
cy, national banks be allowed to is
sue notes to the par value of bonds
deposited, and that the tax on the
circulating notes be placed at one-
fourth of one per cent. A part ot
the message is as follows:
Those who believe that our inde
pendent free coinage of silver at an
artificial ratio with gold of 10 to 1
would restore the parity between
the two metals and consequently
between the coins, oppose an unsur-
ported and improbable theory to the
general belief ana practice ot otner
nations, ana to tne teachings ot tne
wisest statesmen and economists of
the world, both in the past and
present, and what is far more con
clusive, they run counter to our
own actual experiences. Twice in
our earlier history, our law-makers,
in attempting to establish a bime-
talic currency, undertook free coin
age upon a ratio which accidents
varied from the actual relative val
ues of the two metals not more than
3 per cent. In both cases, notwith
standing greater difficulties and cost
of transportation than now exist,
the coins whose intrinsic worth was
undervalued in the ratio, gradually
and surely disappeared Irom our
circulation, and went to other coun
tries where their real value was bet
ter recognized. Acts of congress
were impotent to create an equality
where natural causes decreed even
a slight inequality. Twice in our
OA m
recent history have we signally fail
ed to raise by legislation the value
m-
of silver. Under an act of con
gress passed in 1877 the govern
ment was required for more than
twelve years to expend annually at
least $24,000,000 in the purchase of
silver bullion for coinage. The act
of July 14, 1890, in a still bolder
effort increased the amount cf sil-
ver tne government was compelled

duct of our mines. Under both
laws silver rapidly and steadily de-
clined in value. The prophecy and

In the light of these experiences,
which accord with the experiences
of other nations, there is eertainlv
no secure ground tor the belief that
an apt of ponorpss ronld nor bridorp
an inpnnalitv of 50 ner ppnt between
gold and silver at our present ratio,
i--
nor is there the least possibility that
our country, which has less than
one-seventh of the silver money in
the world, could by iu action alone

the Scimitar to say for itself what it
is that "commands its columns."
The information would not be de
sired if the Free Press were a real
newspaper and directed by a people
of intelligence, for such people
would know without being told,
For the benefit of the Free Press,
however, the Scimitar will state
that its advertising columns are
"commanded" by the business-man
ager and its editorial and news col
umns bv the editors. This may be
news to the Free Press; if so, it is
welcome to tne same. e

Editors Bulletin:
I was recently handed a copy of
the Hardeman Free Press by a;
friend and at the same time
my attention was directed to an ar
ticle concerning the mass meeting.
He said he was asked by a number
of citizens to request me to reply
through your valuable paper.
1 he h ree Press is a paper 1 do
not take, because I consider it a
waste of energy either to pay for it
or read it.
lie is like a kicking mule, he
kicks at every thing whether real
or imaginary if he is not the great
"1 am personality of it.
lhere were a number of citizens
that are as reliable as the great con
ceited egotistical bundle of impor
tance that manages the Free Press,
who expected to be there to assist in
conducting the meeting but by some
fatality they failed to be there, and
the managing of the meeting fell
upon me very unexpectedly.
Now this abdominal preponder
ance very contemptuously called me
a crank. If he did but know it, a
crank is the most important part of
an engine of reform, without which
nothing could be put in motion
no difference how much pressure
there was in the cylinder. If no
one was particularly benefited by
the meeting, I hope no one was ma
terially injured.
