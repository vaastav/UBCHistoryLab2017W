THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Congress has convened, the Presi
dent's Message has Massed Into history,
and still we are not happy. That Mr.
Cleveland has evolved an able docu
ment, his bitterest lualigners can
hardly deny. His views on reciprocity
must needs meet with thcapprobation
of ail who understand the funda
mental principles underlying that
branch of political economy, while no
advocate of Peace, with its attendant
blessings, ean take issue with his ex
pressions on the settlement of inter
national boundary disputes. Regard
ing the subject of the recent Chinese
atrocities, committed upon American
Missions, we enter a mild protest
against the conciliatory tone of our
Chief Executive's sentiments; still,
none can doubt the soundness of his
argument favoring tlrmncss tempered
with gentleness, as well attested by
the friendly attitude of that Power,
and their ready co-operation in the
punishment of the malefactors. Even
the most belligerent defenders of our
national rights will find solace in the
vigorous language that demands pro
tection for American fishermen in dis
puted waters; likewise, sticklers for
national precedents will derive much
comfort from that portion of the mes
sage which dwells in no uncertain
tones upon our position in the Venezu
elan Imbroglio. It will give pause to
the insatiate British lion, now licking
his chops in anticipation of the prom
ised feast, while lovers of liberty and
fair play the world over will applaud
our stand. Lack of time and space
forbids more than cursory allusion to
many Important topics touched upon
In this excellent Message; vide, the
Hawaiian uprising, the Alaskan boun
daries, the situation in the East, the
Cuban rebellion, etc., etc.
Ju treating of these all-absorbing
subjects, Mr. Cleveland has evinced a
masterly skill, and maintained hi
high reputation as the true type of
citizen, statesman and pati lot..
On the burning issue of tlnances,
yclept "the money question," the
President hits the nail squarely upon
the head at every stroke, and we find
it hard to realize that otherwise well
meaning Democrats can doubt the
soundness of his views. The fallacies
of the Silvcrites and Inflationists are
clearly exposed, and the strong light
of reason thrown upon their specious
arguments in a way to bewilder if not
convert their most ardent champions.
The catch-penny methods devised to
capture the unwary arc described in
all their hollowness, while the leaders
in this misguided and unlucky cause,
those who know the right and still
pursue the wrong, come in for a cast!
gation terrible to behold. To every
"Doubling Thomas'' in the land, those
animated by a sincere wish to absorb
the undeflled truth, we earnestly com
mend a prayerful and thoughtful
perusal of that section of the Message
relating to the financial question.
This laudable .ask well performed,
the ranks of the silver advocates will
melt away as snow Hakes before the
sun. Truly, we pity in our heart
every deluded wanderer from the
guiding-star of "Sound Money," so
steadfastly kept in view, and so nobly
defended by M r. Cleveland. Let them
make baste in returning to the Fold ;
grateful for the brevity of their alle
giance to false idols, and wishing to
expatiate the offence by future devo
tion to a righteous cause.
Col. P. K. Mayers, of the Pasca

who so wickedly behaved should be

"Before coming to qualify, which

the Jackson correspondent of the

tax receipts and ascertain if they
have paid all their taxes for two years
past before the 1st day of February.
Only qualified electors are eligible to
hold olllce in Mississippi, and to be a

all his taxes us above indicated."

The case of J. O. Williams vs. P. K.
Mayers of the Desiocuat-Stau, for

cording to the Standard Dictionary,

Editor Heritor rut-Star.
In July last while sitting in my
ofliee at New Venice, making 'haste
to settle with a troublesome employe,
I was assaulted by him with a loaded
pistol, the weapon being snapped at
my breast, and that without cause or
provocation - upon my part. The
would-be assassin and murderer
would have accomplished his diabol
ical purpose and have carried out his
declared purpose, alter navmg been
urged to it by his friends like himself,
of "going over there to kill the son of
a b h," had I not been a man of cour
age and strength sufficient to grapple
with, overcome and disarm nitu. 1
bad him arrested and tried before a
justice in legal form. Two reliable
witnesses besides my own testimony
declared him guilty of an attempt at
a loul, unprovoKcu, cowardly assault,
of premeditated murder; und that of
a man who had been providing film
with remunerative employment, and
paying him promptly whenever he de
manded money.
The testimony of the lower court,
iu all its details was, in evidence,
furnished the grand jury, and other
unquestionable evidence against the
prisoner, and other witnesses to be
had if more could have been desired.
With this sufllclent evidence no in
dictment was found, and the criminal,
the would-be murderer, the violator
of law in carrying concealed weapons,
was, so he states, told to go home,
"your offense was nothing; you only
had a slight difference with a man
whom we have heard some one say
was quick tempered a man whose
testimony don't amount to much ; he
is not in good standing ; he Is under a
cloud, and you need fear nothing from
him," etc.
Honorable men In high office.
Brutus was honorable, more honora
ble than some of the wirepullers in
our halls of justice, even if he did
stab his superior from behind, lie
ware! you may find your Anthony be
fore your race Is run. Spain, in' the
darker ages, had her inquisition for
the purposeof punishing the innocent
and freeing theguilty,Kileneingtruth,
and ruling the world with the triumph
of falsehood. America and Jackson
county has their modern forms of that
dread institution; and I would ask
the question, Is not our grand juries,
in part, can be subservient
to the ring-rulers In and about
our temple of justice in this catego
ry? I do not include all, but 1 have
good grounds for denouncing eome
whose wrong doings are apparent to
many lovers of justice honest men,
men of worth, and in all respects our
best citizens. 1 speak in their inter
est as well as for myself. I speak for
the general good, when I demand Jus
tice for myself. 1 advocate the rights
of men of solid worth, of moral char
acter, who are not afraid of Investiga
tion ; men who for years have lead
in the van of the progressive host;
men who have had the advancement
and best Interests of our good South
ern country at heart.
Why should it make a difference
from what section or country we come,
so long as we arc all that our judges iu
the light of truth could desire, and
only Ignorance, superstition and
vice disdains. Are those men, who
for a quarter of a century, lead in re
form movements, advanced every in
terest of his neighbor and fellow-citizen,

needy laborers, built homes for the
homeless, cared for their fellow-man
In poverty and sickness, sometimes at
the risk of their own lives; gives of
their substance to educate the igno
rant and erect temples of worship,
where their children and they, and the
stranger might worship God, not en
titled to some consideration of right
and protection from gross rings, foul,
false slanders and plots to murder.
The fair-minded citizen views with
regret the foul stain upon the charac
ter of some who swore to search dili
gently for crime and wrong-doing and
aitl iu bringing the guilty to justice.
Who was it ? we may never for a cer
tainty know,, out ean surmise, for
such, and to such, I will say, you are a

you aright In the sight of God or man.
