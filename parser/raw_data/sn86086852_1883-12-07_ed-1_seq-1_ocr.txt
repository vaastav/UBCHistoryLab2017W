all follow that national legislation is
to hr given over into the hands of
“the southern brigadiers. ’' Too many
republican and some disaffected dent
oe ratio editors who are already rais

ward the south. It will b-j time

The Milwaukee Sentinel is very
anxious to have the democratic house
of representatives waste the session in
fruitless efforts for tariff revision. It
is sorely disappointed because there is
conservatism in Carlisle. It wants
the people who believe the protective

such radical rashness as to
throw the business of the country
into a panic to the end
that political capital shall
thereby inure to the republican party.
The Sentinel will not lie gratified.
Tne stoutest opponents of protective

sudden changes iu fiscal laws as to
work injury to business interests.
There is plenty of work for congress
to do in revising and reforming the

unto a debating school to discuss
for months a tariff bill which would
speedily be slaughtered in the senate,
thus frittering away a session, is not
the first work in hand, nor the best
w ay for the lower house of congress
to make itself useful.

Bapid Chess Playing.
New York Sum
A noteworthy exhibition of Dr.
Zakertort'sskill in rapid chess play
ing was given on Friday at the rooms
of the Manhattan Chess Club in a
series of the class of simultaneous
games which Capt. Mackenzie has
made familiar to the club members
for the past two seasons. Twenty-four
chess tables were ranged in the club
chess parlors, and when the expert
began Lis pedestriansim, walking
along the inner circle of the tables,
lie had twenty-four opponents to en
counter. One of these, Mr. Fisher,
withdrew after a few moves, but the
others went through the light to the
end, the list of contestants including
Mr. W. Hill, the chess champion of
the New York Press Club, and his
father, Mr. Hill, and Messrs. Ryan,
Devissen, Kanban?,JDimock.{lsaacson, '
Simonson, the brothers Baird, Rolfe,
Wehle, Stone, Lipshutz, Frere, Rosen
baum, llolfe, C. Thoron, Spiegel,
Parnell. Aurback, Palmer and Piuk
ham. The games began at 7:30 p. M.,
and by 11:30 the last move of the
journey had been made, with the re
sult of eighteen victories for the Doc- |
tor and but three defeats, two games :
being drawn. The first victim of the 1
Doctor vvas'Mr. Thoron, who resigned
at 8:2(1 i>. m. , and the last to give up
was Mr. Devissen, who gave his for
midable opponent work to do to win.
The lirst to win a game from the
champion was Mr. W. Hill, the sec
ond being Mr. Hanham, and the third
Mr. E. W. Dimock of Wall street,
who played a very fine game. Mr.
Wehle secured a draw, ami Mr.
llolfe, after obliging the Doctor to
exchange his queen for a rock, finally ‘
had t# be content with a draw. Dur
ing the tourney Messrs. Delmar and
Davidson played a finely-contested
match in the back parlor of the club,
which resulted in a draw. On Fri
day next Dr. Zakertort will undertake
the difficult task of playing twenty
game* in one evening’s silting with
out seeing the men on the boards.
A High Handed Outrage.
Milwaukee, Dec. 4.—Through the
the intiuence of Gen. West, Dr. Hare
and other powerful friends, Isaac R.
Moulton, a veteran inmate of the
Soldiers’ Home, was released from the
insane asylum at Wauwatoso, where
he has been confined for 12 days ille
gally*, having quarreled with the head
nurse of the hospital at the Home.
He was seized by Provost Sergeant
Hall and committed to the asylum on
papers signed by Gen. Sharpe, com
mandant of the home, who entirely
ignored the legal requirement that a
person so committed must be exam
mad and pronounced insane
by two competent physicians.
General Sharpe did not see
Moulton at all. and it transpires that
the personal enmity of officials at
home was the only cause for commit
ment. Moulton is pronounced sane
and will bring suit against Dr. Mc-
Bride. of the asylum, for false im
prisonment. and will prefer charges
against Gen. Sharpe before the na
tional board.

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Delivered to Congress, December 4,
1 SB3.
To the Couyrexs <>f the United State*:
N FOREIGN AFFAIRS
At the threshold of your del derations I coa
gratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the
1 domestic and foreign affairs of this government.
< >ur relations with other nations continue to be on
a friendly footing: with the Argentine Republic,
Belgium! Austria, Brazil. Denmark. Hayti. Italy.
San I>omingo and Sweden and Norway. No inci
dent has occurred w hich calls for comment. The
recent opening of anew line of telegraphic com
munication with Central America and Brazil per
mitted the interchange of messages of friendship
with the governments of those countries. Dur
ing the year there have been perfected
and proclaimed a consular and commer
cial treaty with Servla and a consular
treaty with Roumauia thus extending
our intercourse with the Danubian countries,
while our eastern relations have been placed up
on a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Mada
gascar. The new boundary survey treaties with
Mexico, the trades mark convention and a
supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain,
and a convention extending the deration of the
Franco-American claims of commission have
also been proclaimed. Notice of the termination
I of tlte fisheries articles of the treaty of Wash
ington was duly given to the British government.
The privileges and exemptions of the British
government and the reciprocal privileges and
exemptions of the treaty will seemingly close on
1 July Ist, ]SbT>. The
FISHING INDUSTRY
pursued by a numerous class of our citizens of
the northern coasts both of the Atlantic and Pa
cific oceans, are worthy of the fostering care of
congress. Whenever brought into competion
; with like industries of other countries, our fisher
men, as well as our manufacturers of fishing ap
| pliances and preparers of fish products, have
; maintained a foremost place. 1 suggest that
congress create a commission to consider the
j question of our rights in the fisheries, and the
means of opening to our citizens, under just and
i enduring conditions, the richly stocked fish
i ing waters and sealing grounds of British
North America. The question has arisen
touching the deportation of the United States
from the British Islands by the government or
the municipal aid of jKTsons unable there to gain
a living and equally a burden on the community
here. Such of these persons as will come under
the paujier class as defined by the law, have been
sent back according to tin* provisions of our
statutes here. Her Majesty's government has
insisted that precaution should have been taken
; lief ore shipment It has, however, iu so
many cases proven ineffectual, i id especially
soin certain instances of needy emigrants reach- I
ing our territory through Canada, that a revision !
1 of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed
advisable Correspondence relative to the Clay- j
t n Bulwer treaty has been continued and will be ;
laid before congress.
Germany's prohibition.
The legislation of France against the iinporta- .
tation of swine produced from the United States, |
has been retracted. The result has been due no i
less to the friendly representation of this govern- 1
ment than to a grow ing conviction in France that :
the restriction is not demanded by danger to any j
real health, Germany still w ishes the introduc
tion of some products from America. 1
extended to the imperial government a j
friendly invitation to semi experts to the United i
States to inquire whether the use of these prod !
nets was dangerous to health. This invitation '
was declined. I have believed it of sucii impor
tance, however, that tlie exact facts should be \
ascertained and promulgated that I have ap- j
pointed
A COMPETENT COMMISSION
to make a thorough investigation of tin* subject.
Its hum ubers have shown their public spirit by !
accepting their trust without pledge of coni pen- i
sat ion. but I trust that congress will see Into the 1
national and inter-national bearings of the matter I
a sufficient motive of proceeding, at least for re- j
iiiihiirsement of such expenses as they may nec- j
essarily incur.
the: coronation of the czar
at Moscow, afforded to this government an occas
ion for test tying to its continued friendship by
sending a special envoy and a representative of
the navy to attend the ceremony. While there
have arisen during the year, no grave issues af
fecting tin* status in the Russian Empire of Am
erican citizens of other faith than that held by the
National Church; this government remains firm
in its convictions that the rights of its citizens
abroad should be in no way affected by their re
ligions belief.
it is understood that measures for the removal
of the restrictions which now burden our trade
with
CUBA AND PORTO RICA.
are under consideration by the Spanish govern
ment. The proximity of Cuba and the peculiar
method of administration which there prevail,
necessitate constant discussion and ap|eal on
our part from the preceding of the insular au
thorities. 1 regret to say that just protests of
(his government have not as yet produced a sat
isfactory result.
THE COMMISSION
appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens
against that government, after the recognition of
a satisfactory rule as to their validity
was admitted, has been without avail. Full rep
aration to our citizens should be no longer delay
ed. Some of the awards, though made more than
two years ago, have not yet been paid. The
specie payment is expected. Claims, to large
amounts, which w ere held hy the late Commis
sion to h* without its jurisdiction, have been
diplomatically promoted to the Spanish Govern
ment, as the addition of the Colonist authorities
whicli has given rise to those claims.
THE CASE OF THE MASONIC
has not reached a settlement The Manella court
has found that the proceedings of w hich this gov
ernment has complained wen* authorized, and it
is hoped that the governim.-nt of Spain will not
withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of
justice should impel it to offer for the unusual se
venty. and unjust action of its subordination of
colonial offict rs. In the easeof this vessel the
Helvetian confederation has proposed the inaug
uration of a class of international treaties for the
deferment to arbitration of grain questions be
tween nations, Tins government has assented to
the proposed arbitration of such already with
Switzerland.
UNDER THE TREATY OF BERLIN
liberty of conscience and civil rights are assured
to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States
have no distinct conventional relations with that
country, and are not a party to the treaty, they
should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic rep
resentation at Sofia for the improvement of in
terc mrse and the proper protection of tin* many
American citizens who resort to that country as
missionaries and teachers. I suggest that I be
given authority to establish an agency and con
sulate at the * Bulgarian capital. The United
States are now participating in a revision of the
tariff of the
ottoman empire.
They have assented to the application of a license
tax of foreigners doing business in Turkey, but
have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon
petroleum entering the ports of that country.
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KHEDIVE
has proposed that the authority of the mixed ju- l
dicial tribunal in Egypt I>e extended so as to cover I
citizens of the United States accused of crime,
who are now tried lefore consular courts. This
go\ i rnment is not indisposed to accept the change,
but believes that its terms should be submitted for
criticism to the commission appointed to revise
the whole subject. At no time in our national his
tory has there been more manifest need of close
and lasting relations with a neighboring state than
now exists
WITH RESPECT TO MEXICO.
The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into
that country, shows by what has already lieen ac- j
complished. tlie vast reciprocal advantages which
must attend the progress of its internal develop
ments The treaty of commerce and navigation
of 1848 has been terminated by the Mexican j
government. The absence of convention en
gagements, the rights of our citizens in Mexico ,
now depend upon the domestic status of tha
republic. There have been instances of harsh
enforcement of the laws against our vessels and
cit izens in Mexico, and of the denial of diplomatic
resort for their protection. The initial step to
ward a better understanding, has been taken in
the negotations by the commission authorized by
congress, of a treaty which is still before the sen
ate awaiting, its approval The provisi* *ns for the
reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops,
in pursuit of hostile Indians, have been prolonged
for another year. The operations of the forces of
both governments against the savages, have been
successful, and several of their most dangerous
w ere dispersed by the skill and vjilor of the Uni
ted States and Mexican soldiers fighting in
a common cause. The convention for the
RE-SURVEY OF THE BOUNDARY
from the Rio Grande to the I’acific having been
ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconsid
eration therein stipulated has l*eeu effected. It

Mexico, on July 13. providing: for the rehear
ing of the cast's of Benj. Weils and the
ABRA SVLOU MINING COMPANY
in whose favor awards were made by the late
American and Mexican claims commission; that
convention still awaits the action of the senate.
Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraudulent
awards which have leen made, anew commission
is necessary, and the executive has directed the
suspension of pay of the distribution quota re
ceived from Mexico.

the centennial celebration of the birth
of the Ulustrious Boli var. At the same time the
inauguration of the statue of Washington in the
Venzuelar capital testified to the veneration in
which his memory is held there. Congress, at its
last session, authorized the executive to propose
to the Venzuelar government* a reopening of the
awards of the mixed commission of Caraccas.
The departure from this country of the Venzuelar
minister had delayed the opening of negotiations
for reviving the com mission. Inis government
holds that until the re-establishment of a treaty
on this subjebt the Venzuelar government must

convention of 1886.
There is ground for believing that the dispute
growing out of the unpaid obligations due from
Venezuela and France will be satisfactorily ad
justed. The French Cabinet ka> proposed a basis
of settlement which meet., my approval, but as it
involves a recasting of the annual quotes of the

or i.odifymg the existing reciprocity Peaty with
HAWAII
is now before congress. lam convinced that the
charges of abuse ami frauds under that treaty
have been exaggerated, and I renew the sugges
tion of last year’s message that the treaty be mod
ified wherever its provisions have proved onerous
to legitimate trade between the two countries. I
am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of
the treaty relations which have fostered good will
tetween the countries and contributed to
ward the equality of Hawaii with other
nations, lu pursuance of this policy declared
by this government of extending our in*crests
with the eastern nations, legations have, during
the past year, been established in Persia. Siam
and Corea. It is probable that permanent mis
sions of those countries will, ere long, he main

from Siam is now on its way hither. Treaty re

change at Siam on the 19th of May last of the
ratifications of the lately concluded convention,
and envoys from the king of Tohihasur have
visited this country and received a cor
dial welcome. Corea, as yet unacquainted with
the methods of western civilization, now invites
the attention of those interested in the foreign
trades, as it needs the implements and products
which the Unileii States are ready to supply. We
seek no monopoly of its commerce, and no advan

in reaching for a higher civilization, have confid
ed In this republic, we cannot regard with indif
ference any t acvoachmentsou their rights. China,
by the payment of a money indemnity , has settled
certain of the long pending claims of our citizens,
and I have strong hopes that the remainder will
soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen touching
the rights of American and other foreign manu
facturers in China under the provisions of treaties
which permits aliens to exercise their industries
in that country. *>n this specific point our own
treaty is silent, but under the operation of the
most favored nation’s c ause, we have like privi
leges with those of other powers. While it is the
duty of the government to see that our citizens
have the full enjoyment of every benefit secured
by the treaty, I doubt if Hie movement to con
strain China to admit an interpretation which we
have only on** indirect right to exact. The trans
ference to Chi’ a of American capital for the em
ployment there of Chinese labor, would in effect
inaugurate a competition for the central markets
now supplied by our home indusf ies. There is
good reason to believe that the low restriction
and the immigration of the Chinese lias been vio
lated intentionally, or otherwise.by the officials of
China, upon whom is devolved the duty of cer
tifying that the immigrants belong to tile except
ed class. Measures have been taken to ascertain
the facts incident to this supposed infrac
tion, and it is believed that the government of
(’hina will co-operate with the United Stales in so
curing the faithful observance of the law. The
same considerations which promoted congress at
the last session to
RETURN TO JAPAN
the Simoneski indemnity, seems to me, to require
at its hands like action in respect to tin* Canton
indemnity fund, now amounting to $300,000. The
question to the general revision of thv foreign
treaties of Japan, has been considered in an inter
national conference, held at Lares, but without
definite result as yet. This government is dispos
ed to concede the requests of .Japan to determine
its own tariff duties, provided such proper judi
cial tribunals as may commend themselves to the
western powers for the trial of causes to which
foreigners and parties, and t> assimilate the terms
and duration or its treaties to those of other civ
ilized states. Through our ministers at London and
at Monrovia, this government has endeavored to
AID LIBERIA #
in its differences with Great Britain, touching the
northwestern boundaries of that republic. There
are prospects of the adjustment of the dispute by
the adoption of the Waunah river as the line. This
arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting
international claims and takes from Liberia some
territory. Hi vers have been opened an i steam
boats placed on the rivers and the nuclei of states
established at 22 stations, under one Hag at which
offers are made to freedom, to commerce and
prohibits t* e slave trade. The rich and popular
valley of the < on go is being opened to commerce
by a society called the
INTERNATIONAL AFRICAN ASSOCIATION
of which the king of the Belgians is president,
and a citizen of the United Slates the chief ex
ecutive officer, and large tracts of territory have
been ceded to the association by native chiefs.

FISCAL YEAR ISBS.
If he revenues for the fiscal year which will end
on June 80.1885. be estimated upon the basis of ex
isting laws, the secretary is of the opinion that for
that year the receipts will exceed StiO.ikXUXU The
ordinary expenditures including the amount de
voted to the sinking fund hitherto, and all surplus
as rapidly os it has accumulated.has been devoted
to the
REDUCTION OF THE NATIONAL DEBT.
Asa result the only bonds now outstanding which
ere redeemable at the pleasure of the government
are the 3 per cents amounting to $205,000,000; 4U>
per cents amounting to $50,000,000. and the 5:
000.0*** four per cents arc n it payable until 1891
and 1907 respectively.
If the surplus shall hereafter lie as large as the
treasury estimates now indicate, the three per
cent bon s may all be redeemed at least four
years before any of the four and one half j>er
cents can be called in. The latter at the same
rate of accumulation of surplus can be
PAID AT MATURITY.
and the monies requisite for the redemption of
the 4 per cents will be iu the treasury many rears
before these obligations become payable. There
are cogent reasons, however, why the national in
debtedness should not Ik* thus rapidly extinguish
ed. Chief among them is the fact that only
through excess of taxation is such rapidity at
tainable
In a communication to congress at its last ses
sion 1 recommended that ail excise taxes Ik*
abolished except those relating to distilled spirits,
and that substantial reduction also lx* made in
the revenues from customs. A statute has since
been enacted by which the annual tax and tariff
receipts of the government have been cut down to
the extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dol
lars. While 1 have no doubt that still farther re
ductions may be wisely made, 1 do not advise the
adoption at this session of any measures for large
diminution of national revenues. The results of
the legislation of the late session of congress have
not as yet become sufficiently apparent to justify
any radical revision or sweeping modifications of
existing law in the interval which must elapse be
fore the effects of the art of March 3d 1883 ran be
definitely ascertained.
A portion at least of this surplus revenue may
be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of
rehabitatiug our nation and providing first class
defenses for the protection of our hartiors. This
is a matter to which I shall again advert. Imme
diately associated with the financial subject just
discussed, is the important question? W hat leg
islation is needed regarding the National curren
cy. The aggregate amount of bonds now on de
posit in the Treasury to support the National
Hank circulation is about §330,000,1100. Nearly
$200,000,000 of this amount consists of 3 per cent. :
bonds which, as already stated, are payable at
the pleasure of the Government, and are likely to
be called in within less than four years, unless in :
the meantime, surplus revenues shall Ik* demand- I
ed.
The probable effect iff such an extensive retire
ment of the securities which are the basis of the j
national bank circulation, would In* such aeon- j
traction of the volume of currency as to produce ;
grave commercial embarrassments. Hof. can the ;
danger be obviated/ The most effectual plan and |
one whose adoption at the earliest practical on |
portunitv 1 shall heartny approve, has already i
oeen indicated, if the revenues of the next four
years shall be kept substantially commensurate ;
with the expenses. The volume of circulation
will not be likely to suffer any material disturb- .
ance, but if on the other baud there shall Ik* great I
delay in reducing taxation, it will become neces
sary either to substitute some other form of cur- j
re my in place of the national bank notes, or to j
make im|H>rtant changes in the law by which 1
their circulation is now controlled.
In my judgment the latter course is far prefer- ■
able. 1 commend to your attention the very in
teresting and thoughtful suggestions on this sub
ject which appear iu the secretary's report. The
objections which he urges against the acceptance
of any other securities than the obligations of the
government itself, as the foundation for national
bank circulation, seem to me insuperable. For i
advocating the threatened contraction, two ;
courses have been suggested, either of which is I
probably feasable. One is the ifs nance of new 1
bonds having many years to run, bearing a low I
rate of interest and exchangeable upon specified j
terms of those now outstanding.
The other course w hich presented itself to my
ow n judgment as the 1 tetter one, is the enactment
of a law repealing the tax on circulation, and
permitting the Dames to issue notes for you at an
amount equal to 9 per cent, of the market value,
instead iff as now the full value of the
dejKisited bonds. 1 agree with the secre
tary in the belief that the adoption of this plan
will afford the necessary relief.
THE TRADE DOLLAR
was coined for the purpose of traffic in countries
where silver passed at its value as cost ascer
tained by its w eight and fineness. It never had a
legai tender quality. A large number of those
coins entered, how ever, into the volume of our
currency. By common consent their circulation
has now ceased in the Un ted States
Because a disturbing element, they shoul not be
longer permitted toembarrass our currency sys
tem. I recommend that provison be ma le for
their reception bv the treasury and mints, as

market prices of silver of like fineness. The Sec
retary of the Treasury advises a consolidation of
certain of the customs districts of the country,
and suggests that the president be vested with
such power In relation thereto as is now given
him in Report of Collectors of Internal revenue.
Section 3111 of the revised statutes.
The statistics on the subject which are contained
in his report furnish of themselves a strong argu
ment in defense of his views. At the adjournment
of congress the numlier of
INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTION
districts was 126. By executive orders dated June
25.1883, 1 directed that certain of these districts
he consolidated. The result has been a reduction
of one third their number which at present is but
SI. From the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR
it will be seen that in only a single instance has
there been any disturbance of the quiet condition
of our Indian tribesa raid from Mexico into Arizo
na by a small party of Indians which was pursued
by Gea. Crook into the mountain regions from
which it hail come. It is confidently hoped that
serious outbreaks w ill not again occur, and that
the Indian tribes which have for so many years
disturbed the west w ill hereafter remain in peace
able submission.
I again call your attention to the present condi
tion of our extended sea coast, upon which are so
many large cities, whose wealth and Importance
to the country would, in time of war, invite at
tack from modern armored ships, against which
our existing defensive works could give no ade
quate protection. These works were built before
the introduction ff modem heavy rilled guns into
maritime warfare; and if they are not put in an
efficient condition, we may easily be subjected to
humiliation, by a hostile power greatly inferior
to ourselves. As german-* to this subject, 1 call
your attention to the importance of perfecting
our *
SUBMARINE TORPEDO DEFENSES.
The board authorized by tin* last congress to re
port on the method whicli should he adopted for
the manufacture of heavy ordnances adapted to
modern warfare has visted the principal iron and
steel works in this country and Europe. It is
hoped that its report w ill be soon made and that
congress will thereupon Iks disposed to provide
suitable facilities and plans for the manufacture
of such guns as are now imperatively needed.
On several occasions during the past year officers
of th army have, at the request of the state
authorities," visited their military encampments
for Inspection of the troops. From the reports
of these officers I am induced to lielieve that the
encouragement of state militia organization by
the national government would be followed by
verv gratifying results, and would afford it in
sudden emergencies the aid of a large body of i
volunteers educated in the performeuce ff mill- I
tary duties. The seer eta., oi
THE NAVY
reports that under the authority of the acts o f
August sth, 188*2. and March 3J, IH3, the work of
strengthening our navy by the construction of
modern vessels has been auspiciously begun.
Three cruisers are in progress ot construction:
the Chicago of 1.500 tons displacement, and the
Boston and Atlanta, each of 2.500 tons. They are
to be buiit of steel with the tensile strength and
the ductibility prescribed by law, and in combin
ation iff speed, endurance and armanent, are ex
pected to compare favorably with the best un
armed war vessels of other nations. A fourth
veasel, the "Dolphin.'' is to be constructed of sim
ilar materiri and is intended to serve as a fleet
dispatch boat.
The double turreted monitors, Puritan, Am pie
rate and Terror, have been launched on the Dela
ware river, and a contract has I**ea made for the
supply of their machinery. A similar one. the
Monadrosk. has been launched in California.
The naval advisory l*rd and the secretary re
commend the completion of the monitors, the
construction of four gun boats, and also of three
additional steel vessels like the Chicago. Boston,
and Dolphin, as an important measure of national
defense The secretary urges also the immediate
creation of an interior fast line of w afer ways
across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast
from Florida to Hampton Roads, between the
Cheseieake Bay and Delaware river, and through
Cape Cod.
I feoi bound to impress upon the attention of
congress the necessity of continued progress in
the const ruction of the navy. The condition of
the public treasury, as I have already intimated,
makes the present an auspicious time for putting
this branch of service in a state of efficiency. It
is no part of our policy to create and maintain a
navy able to cope with that of the other great
powers of the world.
We have no wish for foreign conquest; and the
peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seem
ing danger of interruption. But that our naval
strength should be made adequate for the defense
of our harbors, the protection of our commercial
interests, and tlie maintenance of our national
hon'w. is a proposition from which no patriotic
citizet, can withhold his awnL

RELATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE TELEGRAPH
Such reflection as I have been able (ogive to (be
I
subject since my last annual message has not led
me to change me view w hich 1 then expressed iu
dissenting from the recommendation of the Post
master General, that the government assume the
same control over tlie teiegra h which it has al
ways had over the mats. Admitting that its
authority in the premises is as ample as has over
been claimed tor it. it would not, in my judgment,
Ik* wise to purchase or assume the control of ex
is ting telegraph lines, or to construct others with
a view of entering into general competition w ith
private enterprise.
The objections which may be justly urged
against either of these projects, and" indeed
against any system which would require au
enormous increase in the civil service, do not how
ev*jr apply to some of the plans w hich have latc.v
provoked public comm nt and discussion. It has
been claimed, for example, that congress might
wisely authorize the post master to contract with
some private person or corporation for the trans
mission of messages, at specific! rates and under
government supervision Various schemes of
the same general nature, but w idely differing in
their special chactenslics, have l>een suggested in
the public prints, and the arguments bv which
they have been supported and op nosed have
doubtless attracted your attention
It is likely that the whole subject will be con
’ sidcred by ;.*ou at the present session. In the na
ture of things it involves so mauv questions of
detail that your deliberations would probably In*

however, that the government shouU. he "author

that for attaining that end some measure be adopt
ed which will receive your approval.

appeal’s that the persons by that act disqualified
numbered about 12,000. and that number were ex
cluded from the polls. This fact, however, af
fords but little cause for congratulation, and I
fear that is far from indicating any real
substantial progress towards the extirpa
tion of polygamy All t lie members of the legis
hit are art* mormons and there are good reasons
to believe that they are in sym.-athy with
practices that this government is
seeking to suppress. and that its
effort in that regard will be more likely to en
counter the opposition than receive their encour
agement and support. Even if this view should hap
pily be erroneous the law under which tin* commis
sioners have been acting should be made more
effective by the incorporation of some such
measures as they recommend.and as w ere in ,dud
I ed in bill No 2238 on the calendar of the Senate at
it> last session. I am convinced that polygamy
has become so strongly intrenched in the territory
of Utah, that it is profitless to attack w ith any but
the weapons which constitutional legislation can
provide for them. 1 favor therefore the report of
THE ACT ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT DEPENDS,
the assumption by the national legislation of tin*
entire political control of the territory, and the
establishment of a commission with such powers
and duties as shall l>e delegated to it by law.
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
is accomplishing much in the direction of agricul
tural developments of the eountrv, and the de
partmentof the commissioner riving the results
of his investigations and experiments will be
found interesting and valuable. At this instance
a convention of those interested in the cattle in
dustry of the country, was lately held atUhica
go. The prevalence of IMe tiro pneumonia and
other contagious diseases of animals was one of
tlie chief topics of discussion. The commissioner
invites your investigation into tlie causes of thesa
diseases, mid providing methods of their preven
tion and cure.
I tiust that congress will not fail at its pres
ent session, to put
ALASKA
under t e protection of our laws. Its people
have repeatedly demonstrated against our
neglect to afford them the maintenance and pre
lect ion expressly guaranteed by the terms of the
treaty, whereby the territory was ceded to the
United States." For sixteen years they have
pleaded in vain for that which they should have
received witnout asking. They have no law for
the collect ion of debt, the support of education,
the conveyance ot property, the administration
of sta es or tin* enforcement of contracts. None
indeed for the punishment of criminals except
such as are offered as against certain customs of
commerce and navigation acts.
The resources of Alaska, especially in fur
mines and lumber, are considerable in extent
and capable of large development, while its geo
graphical situation is one of political and com
mercial importance. The promptings of interest,
therefore, as well as considerations of honor and
good faith, demand the Immediate establishment
of civil government in that territory.
Complaints have lately been general and urgent
that certain corporations, controlling in whole or
in part the facilities for the inter state carriage
of persons and men handise over the great rail
roads of tlie country, have resorted, in their deal
ings with the people, to divers measures, unjust
and oppressive iu their character. In some iustan
ce.the state forts have attacked and suppressed
these evils, but in others they have been unable to
afford adequate relief because of the jurisdiction
al limitations which are imposed upon them by
jhe federal constitution. The question, how far
the national government should interfere in the
premises, and what, if any. sujervision of control
it ought to exercise, Is one which merits your
careful consideration. While we can't fail to
recognize the importance of the
VAST RAILWAY SYSTEMS
of the country, and their great help and benefit
to the development of our material wealth, we
should, on the other hand, rememb.r that no in
dividual and no corporation ought to he vested
with absolute power over the interest of any other !
citizens or class of citizens. Th** right of those
railway corporations to award any profitable re
turn upon their investments, and to reasonable
freedom • n their regulation, must be recognized,
but it seems only just that so far as its constitu
tional authority w ill permit, congr -ss should pro
tect .he people at large In th*ir inter-stab* traffic
against acts of injustice which the state govern
ment are powerless to prevent.
PROTECTION OF FORESTS.
In ray last annual message 1 called attention to
the ne- easily of protecting, by suitable legisla
tion. the forests situated on the public domains in
numerous portions of the west. Tlie pursuit of
general agriculture is only made practicable by
resort to irrigation. While successful irrigation
would be impossible without the aid afforded hy
forests in contributing to the regularity and cus
tomary supply of water, during the past year se
vere suffering and great loss of property have
occasioned by profuse floods, followed by
periods of unusually low w ater. In many of the
great rivers of the country these irrigations were
in a great measure caused by the removal from
about the sources of the streams in question the
timljer by which the water supply had been nour
: ished and protected. Th** preservation of such
I portion of the forests on the national domain as
essentially contribute to the flow of important
water courses, is of the highest consequence. Im
; portant tributariw of the Missouri, the Columbia
and Sa skate he wan rise in the mountains of Mon
tana, near the northern boundary of the United
States, between the Block Feet and Flat Head In
dian reservations. This region is unsuitable for
settlement, but upon the rivers whicli flow from it
depend the future agricultural development of a
! vast tract of country! The alter tion of congress
| is called to the necessity of withdraw ing from the
public sale this part of the public domain and es
tablLshing there a forest preser/e.
THE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS

M'DONALD ON CARLISLE.
McDonald's Opinion of Mr. Carlisle,
tiie Tariff, and the Coming Cam
paign.
Indian a I*ol. is, lud., Dec. 4, Mr.
McDonald was interviewed today.
Upon the election of Carlisle he saiil:
“I am greatly pleased over the elec
tion of Mr. Carlisle. He is a safe
conservative man who does not hold
extreme views.”
“What is his position on the tarill’
question?”
“He is in favor of a tariff for revs
nue and in favor of such protection
as that tariff gives to the industries
of the country. He is not in favor
of an immediate adoption of free
trade, but in favor of tariff reform,
the reform to be made without dam
aging the business of the country.
Tariff for revenue with incidental
protection expresses it. There is no
question but that in reforming *he
I tariff there must be an accommoda
tion to the business of the country so
that no disasters may follow.”
“Mr. Carlisle’s position is therefore
i in accord with your own ?”
“It is.”
“Is it the position of the Western
democracy?”
“It is.
“Is there any connection between
the election of Mr. Carlisle and the
democratic victories since 1882?”
“Mr. Carlisle's election is due to
the same causes that brought about
those victories.”
“Then, if the democrats in ISS4
should go into the presidential cam
paign upon a platform in harmony
with Mr. Carlisle’s position on the
tariff', do you think they will win?"
“I mostcertainly do.”
“What is Mr. Carlisle’s attitude on
the question of taxing liquor and
tobacco?”
“He is in favor of main tain ing the
taxes for the present,”
“What about the republican cry
that Mr. Carlisle is a southern man?”
“I lunik the lime is past for bring
ing into a consideration of a man's
worthiness for position the matter of
t ie section iu which he may chance to
reside, more particularly when the
man in question was a union man
during the war, as Mr. Carlisle was.”
“The democrats have then thrown
down the gage of battle to the repub
licans on Die tarill' question?”
“They have. That is to say,the dem
ocrats are opposed to protection for
the sole purpose of protection.”
SIZING UP THE NEW SPEAKER.
Chicago Democrats as a Role
Swearing by Carlisle.
Chicago, Dee. 4.- “What do yon
think of tiie choice of Carlisle as
speaker of the house?” asked a report
er yesterday of Mr. F. H. Winston.
“I am very much pleased with it,”
said Mr. Winston, “and I think it is
the best thing the country could do
under the circumstances. I know
that Mr. Carlisle is a very able man,
and be is a union man—not a seces
sionist or one of the rebel brigadiers.
“What stand do you think he will
take on the tariff?” asked the re
porter.
“He is not an ultra free-trade man,
and I think he will lie very conserva
tive on the tariff’ question.”
“It was the only thing the demo
cratic party could do to support its
old principles,” said Mr. S. Corning
Juda, when asked about the nomina
tion. “I tliinK Carlisle's nomination
is a good thing for the party and the
country.”
“How do you tfiink he will stand
on the tariff question?”
“He will be quite conservative.”
“I am delighted with Carlisle's
nomination,” said Mr. Melville W.
Fuller. On the tariff question he will
be conservative, but against protec
tion as such.”
“I am not so delighted.” said Judge
Shepard, who was standing near by.
“1 consider it a very wise choice,”
said Mr. W. C. Goudy. “I was for
Carlisle first and last. In my judg
ment, this means that the democratic
party intends to purify the govern
ment. By such wise actions, disre
garding party cries for ‘office, ’ ‘office’
for democrats and politicians, it can
hope to elect a president next time. I
believe in low taxes and good govern
ment.”

.New Y okk, Deo. 4. —Leading New
York bankers express themselves as
follows on the election of Speaker
Carlisle:
StSeT\ eUt rr; S v - of ,he Suited
~ „* ational bsni: “I have know
-nr. Carlisle fora number of years.
He is a very bright and an extremely
cautious man. W hile he has been
consideretl somewhat of a disturber,
yet he is a man to take on la rye re
sponsibilities and to appreciate them,
and from his sublime honesty of pur
pose he will draw an influence which
will outweigh any semi-political in
ti ueuce."
Vice-President Olcott, of the Cen
tral Trust company; “1 don’t think
the democratic party is likely to do
any radical thing.”
Y ice President Fahnest*ck. of the
First National bank “Carlisle’s
election is not a matter that will
affect commercial interests either
way.”
President t’ox, of the Mechanics’
bank: iam pleased with Mr Car
lisle s election to the speakership. 1
think it the best selection that could
have been made. His election will
have no bearing on the financial
question, “
President Hatch, of the Bfivk ex
change; “I don't think Mr Carlisle's
election will have an unfavorable
effect upon finances. So fat as his
personal influence g.vs 1 don’t think
he will furtlu r any very radical legis
lotion or any legislation which his
judgment could Do convinced was
calculated to be injurious to the
country."
President Baldwin, of the Fourth
National bank. “So far as 1 am
concerned I regard Mr. Carlisle us a
man of great ability, who will feel
the respousibilitiesof his position and
! act with a conservative regard to the
wants of the country."
President Pappan, of the Gallatin
National bank, said- “ 1 don't think
Mr Carlisle election will have any
effect ou the financial question. 1
think he will go slow and do nothing
radical. I see no cause for apjire
hension on that score "

iiis antagonist down one hundred and
ten times.

terrific blow on McCoy’s neck, felling
him like an ox.
He was picked up and carried to his
