A Rough Experleuc.
The crew of tke schooner Chandler J.
Wells ashore at Whisky island had a very
rough experience. As is well known af
ter the steambarge Keystone arrived
lere the tug Swain was sent to her as
sistance with a steam pump. Before the
pump could be worked a howling north
west gale sprung up. the temperature
fell forty degrees in a few hoars, and
the tug was compelled to run to Beaver
' Harbor for her own safety. The crew of
the stranded vessel determined to re
main aboard, and their suffering began
Sunday night. The freezing wild froze
every drop of water which struck her
and her cabin and foreeastle were soon
half full of slush, ice and water, extia
gtishing the galley and forecastle fires,
and leaving thi men without a dry
place to lav down, Some of the more
lardy members of the crew procured
toar.ls and succeeded after much toil in
rectiag a staging oa which they eould
lie and keep out of the water. The Tea
sel pounded heavily on the rocks, aad
threatened momentarily to go to pieces,
The only food the half-frozen crew had
at hand was a lot of water-soaked hard
tack, and they had to eat sparingly of
these in order to make the simply hold
out until they could be rescmed from
their pel ileus position. Weduesday
morning the life crew at the Beavers'
went to the Wells, and took the famish
ed men to the island, where thoy were
put on board the tug Swain and convey
ed to Cheboygan. Their condition was
yitiable in the extreme. Some of them
had their limbs frozeD, and all were
nearly famished. The Swain left again
Tnursday evening with two additional
steam pumps, having received orders
from the underwriters to rescue the res
sel if possible.
A Had Fall.
A sanous tccident happened last Wed
nesday eyening to a sailor named Fred
rick Peterson, employed on the schoon
er Sam Flint. The schooner had finished
loading Tuesday, but owing to the storm
was unable to leave. Wednesday after
noon PetersoDjind a companion earns
vp streot and in the evening were mak
ing their way to the vessel, which lay at
the lower end of the Cheboygan Lumber
Company's pier. They started up the
stairs at the south end of the mill to get
en the tramway, and when they got near
the top Peterson fell off the stairs on the
hard planks of tho dock, and was carried
to the schooner in an insensible condi
tion and remained so until tho next
morning. Dr. DuPaul was called and
found some of his ribs fractured, with
indications of internal injuries, Thurs
day forenoon the Injured man was re
moved to the Cheboygan Sanitarium
where a further examination was had,
mealing that his spine was injured and
ais body paralyzed from the hips down.
The man suffered a great deal, but was
rational, lie has a wife and five chil
dren living in Liverpool, England. He
has sailed on the lakes for fifteen sea
sons, but in winter sailed on the ocean.
He says he had determined to move his
family over and take up a homestead
near Duluth. He sailed on the Flint all
season, and Capt. naves speaks well of
. him as a seaman. He lays the accident
to a pair of rubber boots he was wearing.
There is butlittle hopes of his recovery.
A Military Company.
Early in the season of 1883 an effort
was made to organize a military com
pany in Cheboygan. A paper was eircu
latad for membership and in a short
time sixty names were obtained compos
ing many of our leading citizens. Feb
ruary 23, 1833, a preliminary organiza
tion was effected by the election of A. 0.
Boggs, captain; E. D. Sutherland, first
nontenant; and II. J. Miner, second lieu
tenant. For sometime after this the
company met regularly in the Town
Hall for drill and succeeded in obtain
ing considerable proficiency, but receiv
ing little encouragement of being re
ceived in any regiment of the state mil
itia, the boys got tired of drilling for
fun and began to lose interest in
the cause and soon the matter was drop
ped indefinitely. We are glad to hear
that an effort is being made to revive the
company, reorganize and make another
effort to secure admission into the state
troops. . The movement is receiving
every encouragement and all indications
show that a company could easily be
raised here, that would be a credit to
any place in the state Already some of
the names of the leading young men in
the village have been secured and the
petition for admission into one of the
state regiments of a company from this
place is being signed by all our promi
nent business men. We hope it will
prove more successful than the former
effort, for we are satisfied' that a com
pany could bo easily raised that would
fce a credit to Cheboygan. I

CONGRESS.
The President's Message.
The second session of the Forty-eighth
Congress convened last Monday, and
President Arthur presented the last mes
sage from a Republican for four years to
come. It contained many good sugges
tions, but wo fear few of them will be
acted upon by the Democratic House.
Among his suggestions are the providing
a more satisfactory method of counting
the electoral vote; approval of the Nicar
agua route for the Isthmns canal; reci
procity treaty with Central'and South
American governments; providing a
fund to be at the disposal of tho Presi
dent for sending representatives to for
eign international expositions; for au
thority for the President to treat dyna
miters as war makers; a change in nat
uralization laws compelling a natural
ized citizen who returns to his native
country to elect whether he will remain
an American or return to his. native al
legiance; to facilitate the circulation of
silver he recommends the withdrawal of
$1 and $2 notes. This is made necessary
by the accumulation of silver under con
tinual coinage, as provided by an act of
Congress; the removal of all internal
revenue taxes except on whisky; Increas
ing the merchant marine by paying sub
sidies; increased fortifications to protect
the groat cities of the seaboard; the
building of new steel cruisers for tho
navy and putting it on a footing to cor
respond with the position and import
ance of the United States in the govern
ments of the world; recommends the
abolishing of fees for U. S; Marshals and
Attorneys; commending civil service re
form and recommending a life pension
for General Grant, in consideration of
his valuable services to his country.
The message is a straightforward,
business like document and cannot fail
to add to President Arthur's reputation
as an able executive officer, and is one
that future chief magistrates may pat
tern after with credit to themselves. The
general impression is that the session
will be a short one and that not much
legislation will be accomplished outside
of passing the necessary appropria
tion bills. The Indications are that im
portant questions will be allowed to go
over tor the new Congress to wrestle
with.
