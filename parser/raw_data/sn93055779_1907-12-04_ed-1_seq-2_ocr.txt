! Washington, Pee. 4.-TI10 following la
the full text of President Roosevelt's sn
nual message to congress:
:. To the Snae anil House of Represent
ative: Js'o nation has greater resources
than. ours, and I think It can be truth
fully said that the citizens of no' nation
possess greater energy end industrial
ability. In no nation are the fundamental
business conditions sounder than In ours
at this very moment; and it Is foolish,
when such is the ease, for people to
hoard Dinner instead of keeping it in
ound banks; for it is such hoarding that
Is the, Immediate occasion of money
stringency. Moreover, an a rule, the busi
ness of our people is conducted with lion
tsy and probity, and this applies allke
to farms and factories, to railroads and
lignksc to nil our legitimate t'ominerriu!
enterprises. , ;
,. . In an,V large body of men. however,
there are certain to tie some who are dla-
, bo.icrl; and if the 'conditions are such
that those men prosper or commit thoir
misdeeds with Impunity, their example Is
n very evil thing for the community.
Where these men are business men of
great sagarlty nnd of temperament both
unscrupulous and reckless, and where the
conditions are such that they act wllh-
' out supart Is.lun or control and at first
without effective check from public opin
ion, they delude many Innocent people
into inuking investments or embarking in
kinds of business that are really unsound.
hon the misdeeds of these successfully
dishonest,' men'- are discovered, suffering
comes not only upon them, but upon the
Innocent Men 'whom they have misled. ".It
Is painful nw.ikening.' whenever it oc
curs; and,' 'naturally, when il does occur
those who suffer are apt to forget that
the longer It was deferred the more pain
ful it would he. In the effort to punish
the 'guilty. It is both wise and proper to
endeavor so far an possible to minimise
the distress of those who have been mis
led by the gulllv. Yet It Is riot, possible
tn refi.tn Italic of e'.teh distress from
i striving to put an end to the misdeeds
ilrit are the ultimate causes of the sufi
feeing,, and. as a .means to this end,
where possible to punish those responsible
for them. Tliero may be honest differ
ences of opinion as to many governmental
policies! but surelv there can bo no such
differences as 10 the nerd of unflinching
persevere pre In.tho war a gainst success
f 11I dishonesty. ; ...

would not be lasting. In the long run,
the one vital factor In the permanent

normally to the service of Iho public, by
their officers and directors. The cor
poration has come to stay, Just as the
trade union has come to stay. Kuch can
do and has Uims great good. K.'ich
should be favored so long as It dues good.
Hut each should be sharply checked
where It acts against liw and Justice.
" The milkers of our national
conBtlttrrnm provided especially that tin.
1 regulation of lutes:. itc ...mm' n e should
come within the sphere of the general
government. The arguments In favor of
thoir taking this stand were even then
overwhelming. Hut they are far strong
er to-day, In view of the enormous de
velopment of great business agencies,
usually corporate In form. Kx'perlenco
has shown conclusively that It Is useless
to try to get any adequate regulation
and supervision of these great corpora
tions by state action. Such regulation
and supervision ran only he effectively
exercised by a sovereign whose Jurisdic
tion Is coextensive with the field of work
of the eorporntlons-'-thtit In, by the na
tional government. I believe that Hits
regulation ami supervision can be ot- ,
tallied by the enactment of law by the
congress. Our steady aim should
he by legislation, cautiously and care
fully 'Undertaken, but resolutely perse- ;
vercd in. to assert the sovereignly of the
I national government by iifhi ruative ac
tion..
"This Is only In form tin Innovation.
In suhsDiuce It Is merely restoration:
for front the earliest time such regulation
of industrial activities has been recog
nized in the action ' of the lawmaking
bodies: and all that I propose is to meet
the changed renditions In such manurr
as will prevent the commonwealth abdi
cating the power It lias nlw.iys pusMed.
not only in this country, but also in Eng
land before and since litis country be
came a separate nation.
"It has been a misfortune that the na
tional laws on this subject hive hitherto
been of a n-g-itive or prohibitive rather
than an afhrmtttive kind, and still more
that they, have iu part sought to pro
hibit what could not lie effectually pro
hibited, and have In part in their pro
hibitions confounded what should be
allowed and what should not be allowed.
It is generally useless to try to prohibit
all restraint on comptJtln, wltet jier this
restraint be rensona'.itc or unreasonable;
and where it is pot useless it is gener
ally hurtful. The successful pros
ecution of one device to evade the law
Immediately develops another device, to
accomplish the same purpose. What is
needed Is not swecphtj: prohibition of.
every arrangement, good or led. w,!'b
may tend to restrict competition, but

In action the principles thus cxpies.-ird.
Federal Control ef
Railroads Is Favored.
No smalt part of the trouble that we
itsve comes fro::i carrying to an cj.tre"ie
the rational virtue of self-rellam e. of in
dependence In initiative and action. It is
wise to eoiurerve tliia virtue and to prn
vide,. for its fullest exercise, iwtuial bb
wltli seeing that liberty does not berime
n liberty to wrong others. I'nfortiitt.ttely.
this is the kind of liberty that the lack of
nil effective regulation Inevitable bre-jds.
The founders of the Constitution pro
vided that 'he National O overt! merit
should have coaiplete and sole control of
iHUtrstat"" commerce." There was then
practically no IntertttaUt business sive
such jis was conducted fW water, and
this the Natioral (Jovernment ' at once
proceeded to regulate in thoroughgoing
Slid effective fashion, fenditnns have new
so wholly changed that the interstate
commerce by 'water - is iiisi-siilficant. .com
pared w.ith the amount tint goes by land,
sad fllmoft all big Imslne- concerns are
cow engaged. In Interstate commerce. As
'res-tit, it can be but partiaPv and Im
perfertly controlled or rcgalaied by the
"rlt,ii of tt'ir one or f,r ever',! str'ten;
ut'h' action inevitably tending to be
either too drastic or rl?e too Vtx. nnd In
cither i-nee- ineftective for purposes of
justice. Only the X.vlntial 'invernment
can tn thotourhgolng fashion "exerclee the
needed control. This does cot mean that
there rhoidd be any extension of Kdernl
authority, for such authority already ex
ists under ihe CooMitution in amplest
snd most far-reaching form: but. it does
mean that there should be an extension
of Federal activity. This Is not advo
cating centralisation. U is merely look
ing facts In the face, nnd realizing that
cntraliJattion in business has already
tome and can not be avoided or undone,
and that the public at large can only
protect itself from certain evil effects
of this business centralization bv provid
ing better methods for the exercise of
control through the authovity already
centralized In the National 'lovernment
hy the Constitution itself. There must lie
no luilt In the henltliv constructive course
if action which this Nation has elected to
pinrtie. and has steadily pursued, during
the last sl;, years, as idioun both In the

Is unfortunate Huu our prrsettt Iilvs

sharply disrrlmituiting bctwicu tlftso

combinations which do evil. Oiitn
railroads would like to combine for ;ju
purpose of preventing .1 big shipper from
maintaining improper atlvantages at the
expense of small shippers and of the gon
eral piihllc. Such a combination. Instead
of being forbidden by law, should be fa
vored. It is a public evil to have
on the statute books a law incapable of
full enforcement, because both judges
and Juries realize that its full enforce
ment would destroy the business of the
country; for the result is to make decent
men violators of the law against their
will, and to put a premium on the be
havior of the willful wrongdoers. Such
a rPKUlt In turn tends to throw the decent
man and the willful wrongdoer Into close
association, and in the end to drag down
the former to the lattcr's level; for tha
man who becomes a lawbreaker in one
way unhappily tends to lose all respect
for law and lo be willing to break it in
many ways. No more scathing coti
demt'iit'oii could be visited upon a law
than is contained in the words of the In

snpervb'kn by the establishment of tho
bureau of corporations.
The antitrust law should not ptohlblt
combinations that do no ItiiutUce to tin
public, still lean tlu..H" the existence of
which Is on tho whole of benellt to Ihe
public, lint, even If this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
im an oipiully objectionable fe iturc the
difficulty nnd delay now Incident lo lui
, enforcement. The government must now
r.ubnilt to irksome and repeated del'tyu
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings instituted, ami
even a favorable decree may mean a:i
empty victory, Moreover, to attempt to
control tlii-wi corporations by laisalt:i
means to Impost upon hath the 'deparl-
. luent of jtt.'itlco and tin? courts an Im
possible burden; it Is not feasible to cany
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
mind of - course be fufniitil.'dored by tin
c.v.'enliv body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses Incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy anil Improper combina
tions, Instead of wniting until they tire
in exiKtetn-o. nnd then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings. A combination should not be tolerated
If it' nbttse the power aeijuired by com
btnatlan to the public detriment. No ;
corporation or ussocht tjett of any kittil
should be permitted to engage In for
eign or Interstate commerce that ij
formed for the purpose of. or whose op
erations create, a monopoly or general
control of the production, sale, or dis
tribution of any one or more of the pr.me.
necessities of life or articles of general
use and necessity. Such combinations arc
against public policy: they violate the
common law: tho doors of th'- coin-Is are
cln.Ked to those who are p:Mties to them,
and I believe the eomrrcss can close the "
channels of interstate commerce against
them for its protection. The law should
make Its prohibitions nod permissions as
clear and definite as possible, leaving
the least pos,:ibla room for arbitrary ac
tion or allegation of such action, on the
part of the executive, or nf divergent in
terpretations by the courts. Among the
points to be aimed at ehoultl be the pro
hibition of unhe'dllty competition, such
Cf hy rendering service at an actual loss
for the piiroosc of crushing out compe
tition, the prevention of iidlatlon of cap
ital, nnd the prohibit Ion of a corporation's

Income and Inheritance
Tax Is Favored.
AVben our tax laws are revised the
riucstioti of an income tax and 'an In
heritance tax should receive the care
ful attention of our legislators. In my
judgment both or theso taxes should bo
part of our system of federal taxation.
1 speak diffidently about tho income tax
because one scheme for nn Income tax
was- declared unconstitutional by tho
tomrcme court; while in addition It Is a
d illicit! t tax to administer In Its practi
cal working, and great care would have
to be exercised to see that It was not
evaded by the very men whom it was
most desirable to have taxed, for if so
evaded It would, of course, be worse
thnn no tax at ail; as the least desira
ble of all taxes is tho tug which bears
heavily upon the honest as compared
with the dishonest man. Nevertheless,
a prailuated income tax of the proper
typo would be a. desirable ' feature of
'federal taxation, niul it Is to be hoped
that one may be devised which the su
preme court will declare eoiu,titulion:il.
The inheritance tax, however, Is both
a far better method of taxation, and far
more important for the purpose of hav
ing Ihe fortunes of the country bear in
proportion to their increase in sine a
corresponding increase uml burden of
taxation. The government has ttie ub
Mdiilo right to decide as to the terms
upon which a man shall receive the be
qiiest or devise from another, and this
point In the devolution of property ts
especially appropriate for the imposi
tion of a tax. Laws imposing such
taxes have repeatedly been placed upon
the national statute books and as re
penteilly declared constitutional by the
courts:' and these law.i contained the
progressive principle, that is-, after a
certain amount is reached Die bequest
or Rift, in life or dalh. Is Increasingly
burdened and the rate of taxation Is
Increased in proportion to the remote
ness of blood of the man receiving the
bequest. These principles are recog
ni7.i d already in the leading civilized
to, lions of the world, "in Cre-it ISrituin
nil the estates worth $"..000 or less are
practically cMtupt front death duties:
while th" increase is such that wla-n an
cslat'. exec-ds live millions f dollars
I
in value and i.a:-; cs to a distant kins-
mill or slr.ing.t-r in b'.ooil t
rio ut i " all told en amount equiv

as exceeds S I il ium li"!) pay,-, over
a hfth I" the M ite If it passer, (o a dir.
tad relative. The Coi-man law i. i ;
neci.illv inlere: tint: to IIS bocatl.io it
mskiH the inheritance tax nn impi-ri a
measure while allotting to the in.it ei I
oil .-tales of the empire n portion o
tl,,- nro. -eeds and permitting; them tu
impo..e taxes In addition to those Im
posed bv the imperial crovemincnt"
Small inheritances are exempt, but I lie
lax is so sharply progressive that win
the inheritance is still not very Uirgt
provided H is not an agricultural or
forest hind, it is taxed at the rate of .
nor cent, if it Boes to distant relative.-

1 rt;it.s the national government should
i not Impose inheritance tax.-s m addi
! lion to those, imposed by the states, and
j when we last Itad an hiia-ri ta ne tax
..bout one-half of the states levied such
laves concurrently with tho national
rov; raiment, making a. combined ma'
mum rate, in some esses as high, as 2

i, h i. !.!. The progressive primuple is
ho applied that taili l.igbei vain is It
now. it onlv on tiie. excess above tiie

so that earn incrc.'ise of rate will upp.y
only to a certain amount above a cer
tain maximum. The tux should if pos
sible be made to bear mor heavily
upon those residing without the coun
try Ihiin within It. A heavy progres
sive tax upon a very large fortune is
in no way such a lax upon thrirt or lu
j dustry as a like lax would be on a
I small fortune. No itdvantawe enthes

the individuals Inheriting tho money by

not the slightest sympathy with that
socialistic idea which would try to put

not merely private property, but what
is far mine important, the home, liar

The two great evllu In the esecitllon of
our criminal laws to-day are sentimen
tality and technicality. For the latter
the remedy must come from the hands
of tho legislatures, the courts and ths
lawyers. The. other must depend for ltn
euro upon the gradual growth of a sound1
public opinion which shall Insist that re
gard for the law and thn demands of
reason shall enntit nil oilier Influences
and emotions In the Jury bog, Moth of
ineae evils must oe removeu or puniui
discontent with the criminal law will con
tinue. Attention Called to Ut
and Abusa of Injunctions.
Instances of abuse In the granting of
Injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment In the mlndsi
of those who feel that their rights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of Injunction is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of It there Is warrant. This ques
tion Is becoming mors and mors of prime
Importance, end unless the courts will
themselves deal with It In effective man
ner, It Is certain , ultimately . to . demsnol
somo form of legislative, action. It would
bo most unfortunate for our social wel
fare If we shoiiTd permit many honest
and " law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had Just, cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may b
devised which will limit, the abuse of in
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time it unwarrantably in
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with the use of the process of
injunction by the courts, not only In la
bor disputes, but where state laws are,
roneerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am Informed that it
will soon receive the consideration of tha
supremo court.
The federal courts must of course de
cide ultimately what nre the respective
spheres of state and nation 111 connec
tion with nny law, slato or national, ami
they must decide definitely and finally in
matters affecting Individual citizens, not
only as to the rights and wrongs of labor
but as to the rights and wrongs of cap
ital; and the national government must
always see that the decision of the court
Is put Into effeet. Tho process of In
junction Is an essential adjunct of the
court's doing its work well; and as pre
ventive measures are always better than
remedial, the wise use of this proems is
from every standpoint comniendalde.
Hut where It Is recklessly or unneces
sarily used, the abuse should be cen
sured, above (ill by the very men who
tire properly anxious to prevent, any ef
fort to shear the courts of this necessary
power. The court's decision must bo
ftnal: the protest is only against the i-on-.
duct of Individual judges In needlessly
fintteipntlng such final derision, or In the
tyrannical use of what Is nominally .
temporary Inlunction to acconipliilt what
is In fact a permanent decision.
Recommend Federal
Inspection of Railroads.
The loss nf life and llmh from railroad
neci, tents In this country has become ap
palling. It is a subject of which the na tional
government shouhl take supervi
sion. It might be well to l.cgih by pro
viding for n federal inspection of inter
state railroads somewhat along the lines
of federal inspection of steamboats, al
though not going so far: perhaps at Drt
f. II that It would be necessary to b.'ivc
would be some otlb-cr whose 'duty it
would be to investigate all accidents on
Intcrstaln railroads anil report tn detail
the entities thereof. Finch an ' officer
should make It his business to get into
close touch with railroad operating men
s i mi' to become thoroughly familiar with
every side of the question, the idea being
to work along the lines of the present
steamboat Inspection law.
Employers' Liability
Legislation Recommended,
The n.iilone.l government should be a
ir.u.l.. cmpiover. If jhouhl ibiuand tho
!;:;-! i- t rti'nl.l-. of .-erv-'e f-crn -ueb ef
iis crrployeR and if should care for a'! of
them properly In return. Congress should
adopt legislation providing limited but
definite compensation for accidents to all
workmen within the scope of tho Federal
power, Including employes nf navy yards
and arsenals. In other words, a model
employers' liability net. far reaching and
ttioioughgoiiig, should be enacted which
should apply to till positions, public and
private, over which the -,aiinti;il govern
ment has jurisdiction. The number of ac
cidents to wane-workers. Including those
hat ere preventable and those that are
not. has become appalling bt the mechan
ical, manufacturing, and transportation
operations of the !av. H works gr-m
hardship to the ordinary wage-worker
and his family to have the effect of sin Ii
an accident fall solely upon hlni: and, on
the other hand, there nre whole clus:t-s
nf attorneys who exit only by ineif'ng
men who ncky or may not have been
wronged to undertake suits for negli
gence. As a mattei of fact a suit for
negligence Is generally an Inadequate
temedy for tho person injured, while It
at-i! c;fciea, akogetly-p. disproportiona to
unnov ,-inee to the employer. Tiie law
should lie made such that the paym-t't
for accidents by the etupbiver would be
automatic Instead of being a matter for
lawsuits, Workmen should receive cer
tain and definite compensation for all ac
cidents In industry irrespective of negli
gence. The employer Is the agent of the
public ami on his own responsibility ami
for bis own protlt he serves the public.
When he starts in motion aKen, ies w hich
create r;sks for others, he should lake all
the ordinary end extraordinary risks In
volved, and the rtk be thus at the mo
ment assumes will ultimately be assumed,
as It ought to be, by the genera! public
Only In this way ran Ihe slunk of the
accident be diffused, Instead of falling
upon the man or woman least able to
bear It. as Is now- the case. The com
munity at large should share the bur
dens as w ell as I lie benefits or Industry.
Hy the proposed law. employers would
gain a desirable certainty of obligation
and get rid of litigation to determine It,
lille the workman and his family would
be relieved from S
