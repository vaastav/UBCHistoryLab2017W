NEW MEXICO STATE RECORD
ENGINEER CORPS
DROPS SHOVELS
PICKS UP RIFLES
PATHS OF DANGER
With the British Army in France,
Saturday, Dec. 1 (by the Associated
Press.) Large numbers of American
army engineers working on British
railways in the region of Gouzeau
court, caught in the German- turn
ing movement, escaped by lying in
shell holes and prone on the ground
while the British fired over them.
There they remained until the Brit
ish were near enough to enable the
Americans to join the ranks, when
they fought valiantly and played an
important part in replying to the
enemy. The British commanders
refer to their miliaut behavior with
the greatest enthusiasm.
Fighting All Around
Americans elsewhere took a busy
hand in the fighting and were under
hot German shelf fire. Numbers of
them volunteered for patrol work in
the danger zone and all acquitted
themselves finely.
A British general told the cor
respondent he could not praise them
too highly. It is reported that sev
eral Americans were captured but
escaped after a few hours and re
joined the British.
The engineers were mainly from
N'ew York.
Cirmati Attacks Formidable
The I lavas correspondent at the
British front, describing the formid
able German atta-ks before f'ambrai
on Friday, in which he asserts eleven
or perhaps twelve enemy divisions
tried to cncTclc the British, only
falling because of the vigor of the
connter-ai tacks, says:
Americans' Courage Notable
"The courageous conduct of a
number of American soldiers attract
ed much atttcnli in. They were pio
neers and specialists cngagedin ron
strt'etion and wnrkinir on field rail
roads. When the enemy appeared
Friday morning they CNchaiued their
shovels for rifles and cartridges and
fought alongside the Tommies. Sev
eral fell gloriously with arms in
their hands facing the foe. No man
who saw them at work but nraises
glowingly the coolness, discipline and
courage of these improvised fight
ers." Engineers On British Lines
For nearly four months American
enrineers have been laboring on the
roads behind the British b'nes. but
military requirements precluded the
mention of this fact until it was an
nounced that the Americans had
played an important part in the
drive, having taken a larcre hand in
the fighting alongside British troops.
The Russians seem to believe that
fightimr. like charity, begins at home.

An act costs ths lives of 369
American citizens, or the greater
part of a regiment or brigade of
American, British or French soldiers,
to say nothing of the destruction of
some millions of dollars' worth of
properly. Docs it help any to realize
that the act was committed by a
6tupid American, and not by a Ger
man agent? Ask the wives or moth
ers of the gallant boys who were
sacrificed!
Recent visits to cities in New
Mexico have been made by one of
the officials 'of the Woman's Na
tional party, the organization which
has been picketing tlio White House,
thj picfceters carrying banners which
wore filled with insults to the Pres
ident. The speaker who visited Santa Fe
and Albuquerque told a story of the
picketing, and of the "inhuman"
treatment of the offenders wno had
been airesltd. A few .women of
New k'icxico accepted as true .4he
statements which were mad. Muny
of the btatcmc-nls made are not sup
ported by the facts in the case. Ban
ners which had been used w-re dis
played, but not all of the banners,
'i'hero was no display of the banners
which lind contained the most flag
rant insults to the President. '
Acts of the pick: tors have tended
to divert and distract from the war
work tlio attention of the President,
thi members of the Cabinet and
other helpers. To this extent, at
least, the acta of the picketers have
been acts of disloyalty to America.
Whatever the motives of the pick
eters, their acts havi served to hlp
Germany subjugate America.' Aug cro-Gei-man
forces, advancing to battle
in Italy a few days ago, placed at
tho head of their columns great
masses of women and children and
men non-combatants. The Italian
armies were thus forced to sacrifice
their own nationals. This is the
Germany which the Woman's Na
tional party is aiding, whatever the
real motiv. of its members.
Women of New Mexico have an
important work to do in this war,
and they have been doing this work
with a singleness of purpose which
is truly commendable. It is unfor
tunate that any division of sentiment
or of energies should occur at this
time. It is hoped that differences
of opinion as to suffrage will not
be allowed to conflict with the work
that is necessary to win the war.
The War News calls upon every
patriotic woman of New P.i -xico to
stand by America and her Allies.
It is a dangerous thing to follow
an organization whose business late
ly has been to insult and to try
to hamper the President. Suffrage
is not a war measure and th rcfore
ought not to be crowded daily upon the
attention of the President and his
advisers.
Let's bury the hatchet in New Mex
ico and present a solid front to
Germany, the arch-enemy of civilization.
No sacrifice necessary to hlp
America and her Allies win
this war is too great for the
women of New Mexico. This
willingness to make great sac-
rifices was shown at a meet-
ing last we 2k of tho Woman's
Auxiliary of the New Mexico
Council of Defense. A resolu-
tion was introduced and pas-
sed without a dissenting vote,
which urged the use of ration
-cards, to insure the fair and
impartial distribution of all
fords. Thj recommendation of
these earnest women was that
ration cards be put into use
throughout all the states. They
are eager to begin now the
practice of this sclf-d nial. in
order that the greatest possible
conservation of food may be
effected.
Here's to the women of New
M:xico! They are striving to
render real service to the gal-
lant soldiers on the battle lines
and in the training camps.
La Follette, Gronna and Hardwick,
who represent Germany in the Unit
ed States, declined to comment on
Presid :nt Wilson's message to tho
new Congress. By the time 100,000
good American soldiers have been
killed in conf'ict with the Huns, the
American public will lose its patience
with thsse men.
Champ Clark, speaker of the House,
says he does not see why we should
fail to declare war on Turkey and
Bulgaria, as well as on Austria. It
would seem to be his opinion that
an enemy is an enemy, and there
fore not to be treated with friend
President Wilson in his message
to the new Congress urges a decla
ration of war against Austria. That
will simplify the work of putting a
curb on the activities of th9 Austrian
workers in the United States.
More than 425,000 men hava en
listed in the' army and the navy
since April 1. These figures have
considerable heft as an answer to
the German agents' lis that the heart
of America is not in this war.
Canning the credits is one means
by which the grocers in New Mex
ico will help to put the country in
readiness to can the kaiser.
Herr-Scnator La Follette has not
yet announced what he will do with

a great deal toward putting the
country on a sound ;r business basis.
