THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
TyASsnxGT03rIec 8- The session of
tke House was opened this morning with
almost every seat filled The gallery was
crowded there being great curiosity to
hear President Clevelands first official
message Tke message was a very long
docament The following is an abstract
jgiving his views on all importand points
It opeas with a tender allusion to the
Teccnt death of Vice President Hendricks
and a reference to his distinguished pub
lic services his integrity and devotion to
dntv
A general survey skows that our rela
tions with 11 foreign powers continue to
be friendlv There are so questions of
difficulty pending with any foregin gov
ernment An allusion is made to the
appointment of Mr Keiley as Minister
to Austria and his rejection by that
country The reasons advanced by Aus
Itria asking for the withdrawal of Keiley
were such as could sot be acquiesed in
by the President without violating his
oath of office He has made no new
soiuination and the interests of the Gov
ernment at Vienna are now in the care
of the Secretary of Legation
Concerning an Isthmian ship canal
-the President says the interest of -the
United States iu a practical transit for
ships across the Isthmus kas been repeat
edly manifested during the last half of
the century and whatever highway may
be constructed across the carrier must be
for the worlds benefit a trust for man
kind to be removed from the chance of
domination of any single power Nor
should it be a point for invitation for
hostilities or a prize for warlike ambition
Towards suck a realization the efforts of
his administration will be applied
The Chinese question in the Western
States despite the restrictive legislation
is far from satisfactory but all the pow
er of the Government should be exerted
to maintain the amplest good faith to
ward Chinain the treatment of emigrants
from that country
Oa the fishery question the President
recommends Conjess to provide for a
commission in which the Government
of the United States and Great Brittain
shall be represented charged with the
settlement of the entire question of the
fishery rights of the two countries
He urges legislation to make the re
cently concluded treaty with Mexico ef
fective
Of the international copyright he says
action is certainly desirable to bring
about the object in view
Inadequacies of legislation touching cit
izenship and naturalization is brought to
the attention of Congress It is import
ant that the right of alien domicile as
distinguished from federal naturalization
be defined
He urges a recast of the appropriations
for consular and diplomatic service on a
footing commensurate with the import
ance of our national interests and advo
cates a system of consular inspection
In reviewing the reports and recom
mendations of his Cabinet officers the
President first takes up the report of Sec
retary Manning and discusses the tariff
and currency and coinage question
OF THE TARIFF
he says The fact that our revenues are
jn excess of the actual needs of an eco
noesjcgl administration of the Govern
nent justices a reduction in the amount
received from the people for its support
iOur Government is but the means estab
jlkhed by the will of a free people by
which certain principles are applied
which they have adopted for their benefit
ind protection and it is never better ad
ministered its true spirit never better
observed than when the peopled taxa
tion for its support is scrupulously limit
jed to tke actual neeessitv of expenditure
and distributed according to a just and
-equitable plan The proposition with
which we Have to deal is a reduction of
tke revenue received by the Government
and indirectly paid by the people from
customs duties The question of free
trade is not involved nor is there now
any occasion for a general discussion of
the wisdom or expediency of a protective
system Justice and fairnes dictat sthat
in any modification of out present laws
relating to revenue the industries and
interests which have been encouraged by
such laws and in which our citizens have
Jarge investments should not be injured
CT ruthlessly destroyed Wehould also
deal wijh the subject in such a manner
as to protect the interest of American
labor which is the capital of our work
ingmen its stability and proper remu
neration furnish the most justifiable pre
text for a protective policy Within
these limitations a certain reduction
should be made in our customs revenue
The amount of such reductions having
been determined and inquiry follows as
to where it can be remitted and which
articles can best be released from duty in
tke interest of our citizens I think a
reduction should be made in the revenue
derived from a tax upon the imported
necessaries of life We thus directly les
sen tke cost of living in every family of
the land and release to the people in ev
ery husable home a larger measure of the
rewards of frugal industry
THE CJJRREXCY PROBLEM
Nothing more important he says than
the present condition of our currency and
coinage can claim the attention of Con
gress The very limited amount of cir
culating 2 Tational bank notes compared
with the amount the law permits them
a issue indicates that the volume of our
circulating medium -may be largely in
creased through this instrumentality
On tke silver question he takes strong
reua4sin favor of the suspension of the
cfiimayc uf mlyer dollars The authority
coi mosey giren to Congress by the
CwsCTtutioo if ft permits purchase of
kulliau er coinage is any event does not
7 HP to a extent beyond the
aasout seeded for a aaMdent circalating
edia The desire to utilize tbe silver
product of the country should not lead
to a misuse or perversion of this power
Tke aecessity for suck an addition to ail
r cnrrescY as is coiBpaliecl by tke i
vsr coinage act he savs is negatired by
tke fact tkat ud to tke nrssent tie onlr
stout 500060 of tke 210Q000 wlver
dollars oiaed siace 1878 kare found
their way into circulation leaving more
tbaa 165000000 ia the possession of the
Governaaeut the custody of which has
eatailed considerable expense for the
coBstmction of vaults for its deposit
Against this latter amount there are out
standing silver certificates amounting to
about y3000000 Every snonth 2000
000 of eold ia the public treasury is paid
out for two milliou orssore of silver
accumulated If continued long enough
this operation will result in the substitu
tion of silver for all the gold the Gov
ernment emu applicable to its general
purposes It will not do to rely upon
the customs receipts of the Government
to make good this drain of gold because
of the silver thus coined having been
made a legal tender for all debts and
dues public and private At times du
ring the last six months 58 per cent of
the receipts for duties have been in silver
or silver certificates while the average
within that period has been 20 per cent
The proportion of silver and its certifi
cates received by the Government will
probably in crease as time goes on for the
reason that the nearer the period reaches
when it will be obliged to offer silver m
payment of its obligation the greater in
ducement there will be to hoard gold
against the depreciation in the ralue of
silver or for the purpose of speculating
This hoarding of gold has already be
gun When the time comes that gold
has been withdrawn from circulation
there will be an apparent difference be
tween the real value of a silver dollar
and a dollar in gold and the two coins
will part company Gold still the stand
ard of value and necessary in our deal
ings with other countries will be at a
over silver the banks which
Eremium
ave substituted gold for the deposits of
their customers may pay them with sil
ver bought with such gold thus making
a hansbme profit Bich speculators will
sell their hoarded gold to their neigh
bors who need it to liquidate their for
eign debts at a runinous premium over
silver and the laboring men and women
the most defenseless will find that the
dollar received for the wage of their toil
has sadly shrunk in ita purchasing power
It may be said that the latter result
will be but temporary and that ultimate
Iy the price of labor will be adjusted to
tne change but even if this takes place
the wage worker can not possibly gain
but must inevitably lose since the price
he is compelled to pay for a living will
not only be measured in coin heavily
depreciated and fluctuating and uncer
tain in its value but this uncertainty
in the value of the purchasing medium
will be made a pretext for an advance
in prices beyond that justified by the act
ual depreciation
Those who do not fear the disastrous
consequences arising from the continued
compulsory coinage of silver and who
suppose that the addition to the currency
intended as ita result will be a public
benefaction are reminded by the Presi
dent that kistory demonstrates that the
point is easily reached in the attempt to
float at the same time two series of mon
ey of different excellence when the bet
ter will cease to be in general circulation
So if silver coinage be continued we
may reasonably expect that gold and its
equivalent will abandon the field of cir
culation to silver alone and this muBt
produce a severe contraction of currency
instead of adding to it The fact that
after special efforts by the Secretary of
the Treasury in payment of duties leads
to the belief that the people do not now
desire to keep it on hand and this with
the evident disposition to hoard gold
gives rise to the suspicion that there al
ready exists a lack of confidence among
the people touching our financiel process
es There is certainly not enough silver
now in circulation to cause uneasiness
and the whole amount coined and now
on hand might after a time be absorbed
by the people without apprehension but
it is the ceasless stream that threatens to
overflow tke land which causes fear and
uncertainty Leaving the considerations
of a home nature in the discussion of
this subject the President says the line
of action in regard to -our currency can
not be wisely settled or persisted in with
out considering the attitudeon the sub
ject of other countries with whom we
maintain commercial relations The at1
titnde of foreign powers remain substan
tially unchanged since the monetary con
ference of 1881 and the steps already
taken to secure the adoption of a com
mon international ratio between gold
and silver demonstrate the uselessness of
further attempts at present to arrive at
any agreement on the subject with other
nations In the meantime we are accu
mulating silver coin based on our own
peculiar ratio to such an extent as will
render us an undesirable party to any fu
ture monetary conference of the nations
Be turning to the discussion of the ques
tion at home the President says we have
now on hand all the silver necessary to
supply the present needs of the people
and to satisfy those who from sentiment
wish to see them in circulation If their
coinage is suspended they can be readily
obtained by all who desire them If the
need of more is at any time apparent
the coinage can be renewed
Look Hebe Bead this please We
have carried slow customers until we are
loaded down and it is impossible to con
tinue to credit those whose notes and ac
counts are past due We must have pay
from you and will take live stock at its
valueon notes and accounts Do not
call for credit even if you are good if
you are owing us and have not settled
We mean what we say J T F Day
The Coantxy 2wpKer and It Pay
Louisville Commercial
The editors of the country press are
an ill paid class considering tne value
of their work to the State Their work
is less easily measured than that of or
dinary dayrlaborers hence they are often
paid less A copy of a county paper
paid for by one subscriber may go
through the hands of a dozen other per
sons all of whom may be benefited with
out compensating the publisher If only
one man in a dozen who ate bread from a
bakery paid the baker for his loaf the
bread making business woujd soon de
cline The newspaper as in exchange of
local news of real importance to say
nothing of the personal gossip which is
equally interesting to most readers has
a substantial value It saves time for
those who otherwise would be obliged to
gather by personal efforts the facts con
tained in tne paper it saves some per
sons from pecuniary loss by keeping
them informed in cases where ignorance
of current or approaching events would
be injurious to business The just basis
of compensation for the newspaper man
if it were possible would be to compute
tke actual value of the information pub
lished dividing this by tke number of
persoas to be benefited to get the
amount of the anneal subscription every
one should pay A more practicable
method might be to estimate the cost of
collecting and printing the local news of
a town aud county the amount wkk
tkeadilss salary added to be assessd4
Upon tna so Dscn Dera oince no reaacr is
liatisfied to accept a poor paper for the
reason tkat the price paid is small it is
een that the price ana the value of a
newspaper do not always correspond as
nearly as with articles of food or apparel
The local editor is expected to furnish
all the news in his county regardless of
the cost for the very small sum which
the average reader of today insists is
enough for the price of the paper Yet
the same average reader does not go to
hk barer or butcher tender a small sum
lars to be added to the idle mass already of money and demand for it enough food
for his family regardless of the first
cost of that food The price of the
county newspaper is generally too small
and the publisher as a rule is unable to
increase it
The mistake many people make is in
demanding their county paper for the
low price charged by the city weekly
papers It snouid be unaerxtooa mat as
the circulation of a newspaper increases
the price may be lessened If a Louis
ville weekly publishes aa many thou
sands of copies as a Princeton paper pub
lishes hundreds it is impossible that the
latter shoud be both as good and as
cheap But the two papers belong to
two classes The people of Caldwell
county few in number need anewspaper
printed near their homes to furnish them
every week certain information which
can not be gven by the outside press
The Louisville psper gives a more gen
eral class of information suited equally
well to every county in the State and to
some other States Neither paper can
fill the place of the other and the price
of one should not be made the basis of
that of the other A man can not buy
as large a bulk of tea for a dollar as of
wheat It would be as reasonable for
him to demand this as to ask that his
country publisher give him as many
columns of print for a dollar as a city
publisher does The Kentucky news-
apers on an average are not excelled
E y the country press of any other State
but the editors are doing too much for
the money they get Their papers ought
to be smaller or their prices higher and
arguments such as are given here ought
to be instilled into the public mind un
til editing local newspapers is more
profitable

THE
Louisville Semi Weekly Post
PROSPECTUS
During the past few months the demand
for Thk Post has great v increased in the
country its popularity being particularly
marked in the interior of Kentuctny Ten
nessee and Indiana Some difficulty has
been presented however because it could
not reach remote sections as soon after pub
lication as was desired owing to the exist
ing regulating that control the movement
of trains while in other sections it has en
joyed advantages over the morning paper
in this respect and we have been enabled
to furuijh a portion of our subscribers with
the latest news from 12 to 15 hours in ad
vance of our cotemporaries In order to
meet the difficulty sugested we have deter
mined to issue a Semi Weekly edition
which will contain carefully selected news
matter foil and accurate reports of the
markets and other features which can not
fail to render it attractive and almost indis
pensable to the farmers merchants and to
the general reader of the interior We are
enabled too to furnish this interesting edi
tion to subscribers in any part of the coun
try for only
per annum The cheapness o the Semi
Weekly Post should cause no one to de
tract from its merits The day for high
priced newspapers has passed We have
found that the cheaper the more readers it
has and the more its columns are sought by
advertisers
