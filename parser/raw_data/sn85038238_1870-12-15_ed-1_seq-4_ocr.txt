Ought Civil Oaths to be Abol
ished? Rev. Dr. Samuel T. Spear thinks
they ought, and adduces the follow
in;; among cojrent leasons :
The ordinarj' plea for bwearing
men is that of practical utility. We
are told that it increases the certain
ty that witnesses will speak the
truth, and that public ollicers will
faithfully perforin their duties; and
hence that, as a means to this end,
it is both allowable and proper. This
is a question of fact ; and the fact is
that we have fcr the result, in multi
tudes of cases, perjured witnesses,
and in a much larger number of
cases perjured officers of law. As
a preventitive of falsehood the tivil
oath is a failure; and it may well
be doubted whether it has ever ad
ded any considerable influence in
favor of truth. If one has no fear
of God before his eyes, swearing
him that he will speak the truth or
discharge Lis official duties is not
likely to increase the certainty that
he will do so . rue oath is not a
process of reformation, but an ap
peal to moral sentiments alreadv
existing; and, if these sentiments
are not present, then the oath has no
power to secure the utterance of
truth. If, on the other band, one
be a mac of habitual veracity, he
will speak the truth, and discharge
his official duties, whether sworn or
not Either then the oath is useless
and for this reason it may well be
omitted ; or it is unnecessary, and
for this reason we should come to
the same conclusion. Those who
need to be sworn in order to make
them tiuthful will not be made so
thereby ; and those who are not al
ready truthful do not need to be
sworn. Sworn witnesses or sworn
officers are not regarded as any
more credible or reliable than those
wno simply affirm, but decline on
conscientious grounds-to take an
oath.
For these reasons we think that it
would be better for the State to
dispense with the oath altogether.
and require witnesses or officers of
law simply to affirm, making false
testimony a penal offense and offi
cial unfaithfulness a ground of im
peachment. This is enough for-the
state, without attempting to admin
ister a religious rite. Let it punish
false testimony as a crime against
the State, and impeach unfaithful
officers ; ana it will wield ;the only
motive which, it can successfully
wield in favor of truth. This we
regard as legitimate and proper. It
is just the sanction of truth which
falls within the province of the State.
The fact that the State permits per
sons to affirm without being sworn
is a virtual adxission that they need
not be sworn at all. .The excep
tional case provided for had better
be the general rule. Society would
not. in our judgment, lose anytuing
by suspending a nsage which an
swers no good end, and to which
there are certainly very serious ob
jections.
The New York Press on the
Message.
The Tribune thinks tbat the prom
inent features of his administration
had already commanded popular ap
probation, but the message will still
more endear the President to the
hearts of his countrymen. The
writer thinks that in reference to
San Domingo, the President is clear
ly right in his position, if not mis
informed as to the material facts
and submits that Congress will be
constrained by public sentiment to
admit San Domingo into our Union
unless it can be made to appear that
her people are preponderantly ad
verse to sucb a fusion. He thinks
the Presidentis patience almost ex
hausted by the Cuban outrages, and
regrets the silence of the message
in regard to the Alabama Claims and
esteems the President's suggestions
and recommendations with regard
to public lands and land grants as
wise and timely.
The Herald thinks the President's
message is a good state paper and a
staunch party platform, and that as
an exhibit of the management under
his supervision of the Government
in our foreign and domestic affairs
there is much in it that is good and
encouraging, and foreshadowing the
general policy of his administration,
there is nothing in it calculated to
disturb the general confidence of the
country .
The Timet saja the message is
the best answer to those who insist
that the mission of the Republican
party is ended, or impugn General
Grant's fitness for interpreting the
wishes and promoting the interests
of the people, and that the policy
set forth is at once positive and
practical. The writer thinks it is
clear that the President has no idea
of plunging the nation into war as a
means of manufacturing party capi
tal; j et that there is nevertheless a
rethcr striking suggestiveness in a
brief paragraph which is devoted to
the Alabama claims, and the mild
nesa of the President's reference to
that question renders more signifi
cant the firmness of his remark in
regard to the fisheries.
A pleasant slip of ths tongne is
recorded by a French Tjaragraphist
A lad' was enjoj ing the society of
her lover, wucn tne bell rang, and
the servant announced the doctor.
"Tell him I am ill, and cannot sec
him," was the madame's reply.
Dr. Hall tells this story of a man
who sang most piously the hymn :
'Were the whole realm of nature mine.
That were a present tar too small."
and all through ,'the singing was
fumbling In his pocket to mako snre
of the smallest piece of silver for
the contribution box.
An Indiana paper tells of a law
yer there who charged a client 810
for collecting $9 ; but said he would
not press him to pay the other dol
lar for a few days, if it would be
more convenient for him to let it
stand- . .
We notice our Democratic ex
changes quote the Chicago Repub
lican as Radical Republican author
ity. The Hepublican is not a Re
publican paper. It claims to be in
dependent now ; but its leading ed
itor is a Democrat, lately imported
