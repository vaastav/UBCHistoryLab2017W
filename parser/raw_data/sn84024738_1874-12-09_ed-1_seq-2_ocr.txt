WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 9, 2874.
The Message? Its Disfigurements.
W* gave yesterday a hurried fiance at toe
President's annual message. We propose
to refer to its repulsive features in a ?3ir
msnner. We look upon it as one of tbe
crudest and least dignified of all the mes
sages that ever emanated from a President
of tbe United States. It, is less like a paper
tbat should come from tbe chief ruler ot a
great nation tban any otber we ever read.
Its discussions of finance and of southern
affiirs are beneath the dignity of such a pa
per. The financial discussion is unworthy
of tbe editorial columns of a third-rate bard
money piper; while its comments on tbe
condition of the southern States and the
rights of the negro, so far from being wor
thy of the President of tbe United S'ates,
would be unworthy of a mere leader in the
Republican party. They sound more as if
they came from a man who supposed birn
M]f to be a mere guardian of tbe negroes,
and tbat in tbe performance of bisguardian
ship there were no local rights of the States
or of tbe white people which be is bound to
respect.
Besides these defects in the President's
views of bis obligations of a domestic na
ture, bis reference to Cuban affairs seems to
be an invitation to otber Powers to join in
interference for the establishment of peace
in Cuba. In spirit this is a complete sur
render of tbe priuciple of the Moxroe doc
trine, and an admission of our willingness
to ec Operate with European Powers in regu
lating tbe polities of this hemisphere. This
is a great ^bange truru other days, when the
bare intimation of an Intention on the part
of a European Government to take a hand
in the regulatiou of Cuban affairs would
have lighted tbe land with one fhrne of In
dignation.
With regard to tbe currency, we consider
most of tbe President's recommendations un
fortunate. It is very idle to suppose that
Congress can fix a day of resumption. We
should regard tbe deliberate act ot the Go
vernment in buting gold by tbe i>sue of
United States bonds, as a step to assist re
sumption, as one of the worst of measures.
It wouid be the best movement for tbe gold
gamblers. The importers, who have to pay
duties in gold, would be bled to a ruinous
degree, and the gamblers alone would be
benefited. The collections of gold through
dudes would be quite sufficient, without
making the Government a dealer in gold to
tbe serious injury of the classes who are en
riching the Treasury by their heavy pay
ments in tbe form of duties. The Govern
ment would become tbe persecutor of its
best friends.
Then, there is no good reason for repeal
ing the legal-tender act now. No serious
charge of tbe financial laws can be very
bentficial now.
Tbe recommendation of tbe President tbat
the people be allowed to establish banks
without lim't, under the present laws, for
tbe securing of the note-bolder, is good. We
see no objection to it. Tbat permission,
connected with the iutcrconvertibility
scheme, would do well for tbe present.
Leaving tbe time for resumption without
day, this plan will permit things to recover
in an easy and natural way, and resumption
will come along with the restoration of that
confider.ce without which it will be impos
sible to maiutain ft.
This financial question, and tbe views of
the message on the affairs of tbe South, con
stitute its main points of interest. We sin
cerely regret tbe wayward and indefinite
nature of the President's immature opinions
of the ".situation" at the South.
With regard to Louisiana he maintains bis
old position with persistence in tbe face of
all facts. He expresses emphatically bis be
lief that Kellcgg was tairly elected Governor
of that State, notwithstanding that leading
Be publicans and all those opposed to them
in politics have declared that it was a mock
ery to assert that be was so elected.
The President disposes of Arkansas in a
singular manner. He does not interfere
himself in bcr last trouble, but be describes
to Congress the circumstances of tbat trou
ble in a way tbat might suggest tbe pro
priety of interference. He tells Congress
tbat tbe late constitution provided tbat before
(l amendments proposed11 to thut Constitu
tion "shall become a part thereof they shall
?'be passed by two successive assemblies and
? then submitted to and ratified by a mu
"jority of the electors of the State voting
" thersou."
President Grant, evidently assuming tbat
the Constitution cau be in no otber way
changed, goes on to state that on the 11th of
May, 1474, the Governor (Baxter) convene*
an extra session of tbe Legislature, which
in the same month passed an act calling a
convention of the people to frame a new
constitution, which act was approved by
the people on tbe 30th June, '74, who at the
same time elected delegates to the conven
tion which met on the 14th July and framed
a new constitution, which was adopted by
the people by an immense majority on the
18th of October, 1874, at which time, accord
ing to the Constitution, State officers were
elected who were to fill offices vacated by
tie instrument# Baxter turned over the
Government accordingly to Gabland, the
Governor who was elected on tbel3tb. But
Smith, Lieutenant-Governor, elected with
) axter, claimed the Goyernment as sueces
s r to Baxter, assuming that there bad
l>.!en no lawful movement to dispossess Bax
TifR.
This statement, solemnly madein the mes
6 ge, is sent to Cocgress along with the re
ference or the whole matter to that body.
The whole constitutional provision quoted
by General Gkant relates to amendments to
the Constitution ; but the people of Arkan
sas called a convention and framed a consti ?
tution : a proceeding wholly different from
making amendments to an old constitution
The cases are different. Tbe people of
Arkansas met in convention and framed a
new constitution. That is a right we have
always contended the people can in no way
be deprived of as long as republican govern
ment lasts.
New, can it be possible that Congress will
dare to interfere In this matter because of tbe
President's statement? a statement not at all
applicable to tbe case? We imagine not. If
there might have been any disposition to in
terfere under other circumstances, in view of
ibe recent elections there is no probability
that Congress will do anything on tbe subject.
Tb.e President degrades his own dignity
by bis negro-talk. He leans to tbe stories of
southern outrages on tbe negro notwith
standing tbe ablest journals of tbe country
hive, through most reliable correspondents
ivbo have visited the localities of alleged out
rages, found these outrages in almost every
ciae either grossly misrepresented or mere

k President Grant gays: A4 In some places,

<*cra under threat* of dltcbarge If they acted

even It it were-troef Does not -every one
know that men arc crowded Into the navy
yards and custoin-Uoasea upon condition that
they wiil vote the Republican ticket? And
are not the office-holders atid laborers peri
odically assessed with their quotas if a sum
is required to piy party expenses? Were
not some 800 or' 1,000 laborers discharged
from the Portsmouth navy-yard alter voting
for Platt, showing that they were either
employed for the occasion, or retained until
tbe*election was over? Can anybody sup*
pose that General Grant has been ignorant
of all this ? How can he censure southern
people for what is the regular practice of
the Administration? The thing is mon
strous.
But look at the fact*. Nearly all negroes
are employed by whites; and see the hun
dreds of thousands {f them who blindly vote
the Republican ticket because, as General
Grant say?, in the spirit of a small partisan
rather than of President of the United States
the negro " knows that hi3 friends are of that
party ." Taking this example into account,
bow far does the alleged iutimidation of the
negro? in imitation of the Administration?
euceeed ? But a little way.
But the truth is the Republicias are only
friends of the negro for the use they make of
him. They reioh office and the stealings in
the South by getting on his back. They are
mere hypocrites. The true friends of the
negro are the southern people, who give him
employment. He begins to find this out, and
puts not so much faith ia freed men's banks
and freedmen's institutions as he formerly
did.
The message, in short, shows that General
Grant is in tbe deep rut of error in regard
to interference by tbe Federal Governmen1
in tbe South, and the reasons for it. He
speaks of tbe people and the States as entirely
at tbe mercy of the Federal Government
and unqualified to govern, and as though
they were animated by cruel impulses and
uncivilized prejudices; whereas be should
know that there are no more civilized, and
generous, and humane people on the face of
God'r earth than those he so unjustly
asperses. It has become a habit with him.
and it will bring him to grief.
President Grant's message is understood
to plea>e no section and no party. Congres?
itself is tired of Federal interference in the
Statos. It has done more to kill the Repub
liean party than any other e^use. Congress
will, it is understood, leave the subject to
take care of itself. General Gbant may be
wail tbe fate of tbe negro aad talk of tbe
"amendments" as aseless unless they pro
tect the negro and oppress the white people;
but Congress is tired of the whole thing ; its
mockery and its hypocrisy are too hideeous
to be endured.
Fish and Sheep.
Governor Kemper does the State a great
Ural of service in directiug the attention of
the Legislature to tbe importance of tbe
cultivation of fish and the protection of
sheep.
Each year proves I? the vrorld the great
wisdom of fish-culture. Fish is an article
of food whose importance all appreciate.
Tbe use which men in eavsge life make of
fish? their flocking to tbe streams at regular
seasons to catch and pack away fish
for future use? is a striking illustra
tion of that providential guardianship
which placed so valuable an article of
food, in reach of races so little acquainted
with the arts of clvilizition. Under the
progress of civilization, and the uses of water
courses that follow it, tbe supply of fish in tbe
rivers is greatly diminished. Tbe art of
fish-culture rapidly restocks them, and gives
to dense populations ample supplies of the
best food. The choiccst species are trans
lated to waters where they were never
known before. So great a blessing is rarely
conferred upon aoen, and we cannot over
estimate it.
Tbe Governor wisely brings it earnestly
before the Legislature. We can in no way
devote the same time and money that' this
measure may require with iqual benefii to
the people. It becomes especially incumbent
upon Virginia to contribute ber share to
wards the stocking of tbe waters with fish.
Many of tbe Statea arc doing all that can be
done in the work. The waters of tbe Union
are allied in oue great system, and tbe enter
prise must be genei al among tbe States, or it
will be imperfectly carried out.
There never wag an undertaking which
gave richer rewards for the labor devoted to
It. Tbe results every where are amazing.
Then, with regard to sheep, it may be said
that no domestic animal is more worthy of
protection. The sheep gives us cheap food,
and also tho invaluable clothing which pro
tects men against the weather. That such
an animal should be left to the slaughter by
dogs savors of barbarism. What do wc gain,
who have paid a liberal price for tbe woll's
scalp, when in lieu of the wolf we have tbe
more destructive dog, which we make a com
panion and a pet of P
We trust that the Legislature may this
year show a better appreciation of this sub*
jeer. Tbe Governor recommends a coun ty
dog-tax to raise a fond in tvery county out
of which to indemnify formers for sheep de
stroyed by dogs. This Is right and just.
The sheep, so great a source of support and
comfort to man, should not be left to tbe
mercy of tbe dog, which is in the long run
more of a pest than a benefit.
Southern Troubles.
The news of the attack on Vicksburg by
negroes, and the movements in South Caro
lina on account of the burniDg of gin-houses
and dwellings, are commentaries upon the
President's message that are most unfortu
nate for its logic and sympathies. When in
this Union before did a body of men march
upon a city and attack its people with the
weapons of war simply because a sheriff
elect was not allowed to eater upon bis office I
for the reason that he eould not give the re
quired security forthe faithful performance
I of its duties? Then, look at the terrible
evil of incendiarism, which bus driven the
responsible and property-holding people of
a State almost to madness. The philan
thropy of the message leans not to the true
sufferers. The Federal Government, like
the thieves on Gad's hill, has " burned the
true men."
Sunset Cox may make capital with a few
editors, but be will displease the people.
There are in Virginia about one hundred
editors. All the rest of the people will be
benefited by a continuaeceof the new postal
law. We trust that some member will offer
an amendment to Cox's bill providing for
the collection of the tariff from * the, parties

A Good Dog'Law.
The following article is taken from the
American Agriculturist, and was prepared
by a citizen of Connecticut. In many States
the dog-tax is devoted explosively to the
support of schools. One hundred thousand
dollars a year might easily be raised in Vir
ginia for that purpose by a tax of one dollar
on each dog :
DOG-LAW OF CONNECTICUT.
The following statute was passed by the
Legislature of Connecticut in 1867, and w
still in force:
Section 1. It shall be the duty of the as
sessors of tbe several towns [?'. e., townships]
of this State to cause all dogs three months
old and upwards which have not been
registered according to law previous to the
first meeting of the Board of Assessors to
be entered upon the asse33ment-list of per
sons owning such dog?, and such dogs shall
be presumed to be owned by the keeper or
occupier of the premises where 6uch dogs
are kept.
Section 2. The owner or owners of all
dogs not registered ass aforesaid sball pay an
annual tax into tbe treasury of the town
[township] where such dogs are kept, to be
levied and colluded with and in tbe same
manner as tbe ordinary town taxes, of three
dollars for every male dog and six dollars
for every female dog.
Another act, passed at the same session of
the Legislature, provides that any excess of
money in the dog-fund may be used for or
dinary town expeuses after all damages done
to sheep in previous years are paid lor.
In the general statutes of this State, in
section 113, it is provided that any two jus
tices of the peace may make such rules and
regulations against dogs as they think the
satety of'persons and property demand.
Section 114 provides that the inhabitants
of the several towns, in legal meeting assem
bled, may make necessary regulations and
offer bounty for the killing of dogs.
Section 116 requires the owner of a dog
over three months old to register and number
such dog in tbe town clerk's office on or be
fore September 1st in each year, and to pay
fifteen cents for registering.
Section 116 provides tbat he sball pay into
tbe treasury two dollars for every male dog.
five dollars tyr every female dog so register
ed, and that be shall put a collar upon bis
registered dog with bis name upon it, and
tbe No. of tbe dog ; and any person killing
said dog sball be liable for bis value; but
any one may kiil a dog found worrying
sheep, whether registered or not.
Section 117 provides that the town clerk
shall pay all moneys received for the privi
lege of keeping dogs into the treasury.
Secton 118. Tbe selectmen are to post no
tices in every school d^trict that dog-owners
must either kill their dogs or cause them to
be registered.
Section 119 inflicts $50 fine upon the se
lectmen who refuse 'to post such notices.
Section 120 fines whoever puts a false re
gister upon bis dog's collar $T.
Section 121 makts it the duty of tbe first
constable to prosecute all violations of tbe
dog-law.
Section 122. Those who suffer damage
In their flocks by death or maiming Irom
dogs are to give information of tbe fact to
one of the selectmen of the town, who is
to estimate the damuge and pay it from tbe
dog-fund, unless the owner of the dog can
be made to pay.
These laws, of which we have given the
outline, work well in Connecticut, and en
courage sheep-raising. They keep the dogs
in check, and make it easy for sbeep-owners
to recover damage done to flocks where any
Is suffered. It is our impression that dog
laws have passed in most of the older north
ern States, and that they are most stringent
in New York and New Enlgand, where wool
and mutton are most valuable.
It is exceedingly desirable that we should
have similar legislation in all the States, and
that sbeep-busbandrv should be made so
safe aod profitable that we have no occasion
to import wool. The census of 1870 report
ed 28,000,000 pounds of wool iu the coun
try, and 100,000,000 pounds of wool as the
annual product. And yet we import large
quantities of wool and woollen goods that
we ought to produce on our own farms and
in our own factories. We are glad to be
lieve that we are increasing our consump
tion of lamb and mutton. Give us stringent
dog-laws in all tbe States, and we might
make these the cheapest of all the meats in
the market.

Editors of the Dispatch,? I am sure I cor
rectly represent tbe sentiment of the com
munity in which I live in saying that Gov
ernor Kemper's recommendation in his mes
sage of the proposition of tbe bondholders
and English capitalists to arrange in tbe way
they propose our State indebtedness meets
with universal disapproval, and that your
disapproval and comments upon it in your
issue of tbe 3d of December are in complete
accord with the judgment and wishes of the
people of this section of country.
Since the good old fashion of primary
meetings of the people to direct and govern
public and legislative sentiments has come
into disuse, the country is more than ever
dependent upon a patriotic, wise, and dis
criminating public press to speak timeously
and boldly upon proposed public measures ;
and I am glad to believe tbe people have
such a representative iu the Dispatch.

hardly possible tbat a gentle and tractable
