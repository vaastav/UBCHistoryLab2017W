THE BANQUET
LAST NIGHT.
The pulse of the city?the busii
ness men?with many of their friends
including Congressmen Glass, Montague
and Carlin of the Virginia delegation,
participated in a banquet
last night at Westminster Building.
It was the get-together event of
Post F, Virginia Division of the
Travelers' Protective Association,
and was a decided success in every
detail of its conception. The menu
was of a most inviting nature. It
was prepared and served by the
members of the Aid Society of the
- ? ... m 1. j
Second fresoytenan u.nurui, cum bllC |
attention bestowed upon each guest
by the ladies was apparent, as is
always the case when this organization
prepares a feast.
The principal speeches were made
by Hon. Carter Glass and Hon. A.
*
J. Montague, and they were listened
to with close attention. Mr. Glass,
whc is the chairman of the House
committee on banking and currency, j
gave an , exhaustive history of the i
financial workings of the country
during the past half a century, in
which he showed that for many
years the bank deposits of the country
were really in charge of one man,
t.hp Cnmotroller of Treasury, who
had the power to concentrate them
whpve he would?generally in New
York, Chicago, or St. Louis?and
that danger of this was apparent^ i
as panics followed from the fact J
that the business and industrial por-'
tioas of the country were at times |
unable to secure the aid needed in
carrying on the affairs of the country.
He showed the practical workings
of he present reserve system
and the regional banks, and made tne
financial question of the country one
of interest to all his hearers, and not
problems which the rank and file are
generally unable to grasp. Mr. Glass
told of the fight the administration
had to put up in order to thwart the
attempts of interested men and sections
to continue the impractical and
illogical banking system of by-gone
years, and gave all tfhe credit to
President Woodrow Wilson, whose
wisdom had conceived and brought
about present conditions under which
there need be no fears of panics.
Under present laws the Comptroller
of the Currency has six associates,
and it is no longer in his power to
allow any one section of the country
lo corner all the capital.
ivir. Montague, who has so often
enthused Alexandria audiences, in his
speech made many interesting suggestions,
especially in reference to
the plans for a more equitable taxav
lion in Virginia., According to his j
convictions^ the segregation plan is j
the most logical, and ho gave his reasons
therefor^ Under it all would
ho rftade to bear their share of
the public burdens. Mr. Montague's
speech took a wide range. He referred
to his visits to Alexandria on
other occasions, showed the advisability
of the people living closer to
each other, referring especially to
President Wilson's procedures in
reading his messages to representatives
of the people, and among other
things predicted that the time would
come when the heads of departments
would have seats in Congress where
they could make suggestions concerning
what measures should be
adopted to perfect their respective
departments.
% The drafters of the constitution of
the late Southern Confederacy realised
the importance of this, as under
it the members of the cabinet had
seats upon the floor of Congress to
urue the needs of their departments.
THE PRESibiEr^T :'* ; "'i:
AM) THE AiAKMISTS.
Congressman Montague in his
speech last night at the banquet of
#'
the Travfelefs' Protective Associa-1
tion wisely suggested that the people i
of a country should study political
economy, as by so doing good men
would aid in forming good governments
instead of bad which is so
often the case when citizens refuse j
to vote or interest themselves in;
what is going- oh in the political |
world.
Since the war broke out in Eu- j
rope some people, like the A then- j
iaus of old, with their ears wide j
open to hear something new or to.
st&rt something new, have become j
delirious wilh the notion that the ;
Lnited States, from a military or
naval point of view, is as helpless
as China, and that many millions of j
dollars should be spent immediately
in armaments. And with such lavish j
expenditures military laws similar to ,
those which have so distressed Eu- j
ropean countries should be enacted j
in the United States in order that the
young men be made to spend a large
portion of their manhood drilling,
sleeping in barracks and playing soldiers.
Members of the Virginia delegation
in the Senate and House have
very properly termed all such delu-1
sons ''tommyrot," an<i their wise (
observations have been confirmed by j
President Wilson, who fortunately^ j
holds the ribbons at this time when j
some misguided spirits would met- [
amorphose the picture of 'Uncle Sam'I
i into a fierce son of Mars encased in !
arm or.
The President in his message to j
Congress yesterday said:
"Let there 'be no misconception; the |
country has been misinformed. We i
have not been negligent of national j
defense. We are not unmindful of i
the great responsibility resting upon !
us. We shall learn and profit by the :
lesson of every experience and every !
new circumstance; and what is need- i
' i
eu will be adequately done." (
He further calls attention to the j
fact that the country has never been ;
found unprepared for eventualities, j

ELKS MEMORIAL SERVIICE j
(Continued from page one)
fraternal activities to forget thejiv, j
! selves for an hour and follow to the j
| grave all that was mortal of their |
brother an<j to take steps to assure j
that his memory, too, will be kept I
green.
"The Elks is not a religious order," j
said Mr. Barrett. "Men of all creeds, j
Catholic. Protestant, Jew and Gentile ;
alike place their hands on the same >
| Bible and take the solemn pledges j
that make them brothers, all. i
"Atheism, the speaker pointed out. I
''has gone of fashion. There is no j
longer the man who defies a God, 1
but there are many who will say: |
Vps T ,hf?1ieve in God. but not aj [
personal God, who concerns himself j
with the small things in my life, j
Against this latter class, as well as
the former, the Elks stand as a bul- i
wark. They believe and they teach
that there is a personal God and
that he acts as a personal father. |
"To the question of Cain," the!
speaker said, "Elks answer: I am j
my brother's keeper." .
"And then, the speaker continued^ J
"the Elks is a social order. Social in- j
tercourse, he said, is good. It devel- j
ops the best there is in men and no-j
where will the quitter show his true I
character quicker than in his friend-:
ly dealings with men under close j
social condtions^
"Mr. Barrett led gracefully up to
a .pretty climax when he told of how^ j
in the midst of jovial festivities all;
is changed when the mystic hour J
of eleven arrives and every Elk pays j
tribute to the "absent brother."
"In concluding his address Mr. j
Barrett repeated the story of a
rnemDer 01 i\ew ionc i-.oage Jj ;
which hinges around a handless j|
clock of Elkdom. The story, retold
with feeling and delicate shading, j
is that a tot who designed to make
j with his own hands a clock with the ,
hands pointing to the hour of eleven !
i as a Christmas present to his
j father. *. I
"It was to be a burnt wood affair ;
j and he went with his mother to pur- ,
t chase the materials, later working j
j them into the desired form with a j
I great deal of patence and childish j
eagerness^ And then when the "mys-:
tic" figures had been guild ed and all j
was ready except thP hands, the lit- j
tie boy died.
The father- found the token laid 1
awav and handless and it is treas- j
urt*d as one of the precious memo- J
rics of his boy as well as a lasting! ;
symbol of the duty that every Elk ]
owes to absent brother, whether ab- j
sent in this world or gone to the i
hereafter.
"Mr. Barrett came to the city '
yesterday morning and during the j
day be was called upon by scores of ]
members of the local, lodge, to the!
majority-pf whom-'^.ii'not a stran- J
ger. ' Those'--who heard his "address
yesterday unhesitatingly pronounced ;
it one of the most graceful efforts
ever made on a similar* occasion
j here."

The tragedy occurred at the Cannon
home where the two Bayhams,
said to have been armed with shotguns,
had gone to discuss trouble
between the Cannon and Bayham

the tragedy, which he said he was 1
attempting to prevent.
The Bayjhams claim that when they \
reached the Cannon home the elder
Cannon met them at the front gate
with a loaded shotgun which missed
fire.
