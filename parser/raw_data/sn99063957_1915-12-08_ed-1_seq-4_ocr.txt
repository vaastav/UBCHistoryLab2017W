THE HOMER DAVENPORT MONUMENT
It is with considerable gratification that old time Ore
gonians remember that Homer Davenport living, erected
with his elnmifint nencil a monument to himself that re
quires nothing from us to add to its enduring beauty. It
is self-satisfying to know that he was an Oregon boy who
went out into the world and won laurels of which we are
all proud, and added to the glory of our great state. We
point with pride to his achievements and take every
occasion to ao mm nonor, proviueu we tuimeci, uumcivco
up with it. We held him in so high esteem that a society
was formed for the purpose of erecting a monument to
his memory at his boyhood's home, the pretty little city
of Silverton. The society very properly selected the
governor of the state as the custodian of the funds to be
collected. As a nucleus for the fund, which it was pro
posed to raise by small subscriptions, about $57 was sub
scribed. There the matter dropped and not a cent has
been added to the fund since.
It is a shame and a disgrace to the state and especial
ly to the'Willamette valley that this is so, and the quicker
we take steps to remedy this, the better for our repu
tation. This fund of $57 is now on deposit at the Ladd & Bush
bank in this city, and we suggest that someone take the
matter in hand and see if the money cannot be raised to
complete the monument. It would be asking too much to
put the matter into the hands of the bank to receive sub
scriptions, for banks are busy places, but the bank will
take care of the money, and do anything else to assist.
We do not know who was on the committee, or if there
is a member here, but if there is, we suggest that he get
busy and start the ball rolling. It is not because Oregon
people are stingy or unfeeling that this matter has been
neglected, but because they are careless and no oppor
tunity is given them to contribute their mite. It should
be an easy matter to secure the fund with subscriptions
of fifty cents, and indeed that is the way the fund should
be raised, so that we may all have the pleasure of aiding
in honoring one of the state's brightest sons.
THE REWARDS OF PEACE .
Gains to the United States because of the European
war continue to come tremendously, without our plan
ning and almost without our effort.
The greatest profit is in the growing balance of trade,
which is by far the largest in the history of the country.
During the year ending October Pl our foreign trade ex
ceeded five billions, and the exports were more than twice
the value of the imports, leaving a balance of $1,626,886,
C2:,5 in our favor.
During the year $:.26,528,779 in gold came to this
country to pay the debts of other peoples to ours. New
Vork is taking the place of London as the financial Clear
ing house of the world, and the gold dollar the place of
the pound sterling as the world standard of exchange.
American dyes are now being produced at the rate
of 9000 tons annually and are taking the place of German
dyes.
Certain high grades of steel, formerly made only at
the Krupp works, are now being produced in even better
quality here.
There are many other gains of great importance.
The certainty is that the war, even if it should end
tomorrow, has given to tho United States a sure position
of world leadership.
"Walla Walla" in the Oregonian asks: "In states
where capital punishment is in effect, please advise if it
applies to women as well as men." The Oregonian
answers yes, and most certainly is mistaken. The law
so applies, but the punishment does not, which is a dis
tinction with a vast difference.
The difference between Henry Ford, the king of
Innnin .. .1.., . A ....1 - C ll.. .T.
I'lucum- turn iuu iuuks ami run-is 01 um waning nations
is that Henry made his will before he started on his job
and they made their wonts.
One redeeming feature about President Wilson's
messages is the fact that they are correctly phrased and
that only good English is used to express his thoughts.
But at best the modern presidential message is a dreary,
affair, dealing with yards of statistics and reiterating the
political views, with arguments to sustain them, which
every newspaper reader already knows the author is
committed to. Jefferson and Lincoln, the nation's greatest
presidents wrote very brief messages dealing with the
paramount policies of the time, leaving statistical in
formation to be gathered and submitted to congress and
the country through the heads of departments. President
Roosevelt's messages averaged longest of any of the
occupants of the White House, Taft was verbose and
Wilson seems to be acquiring thehabit of his immediate
predecessor. His message o fyesterday might have been a
model for future presidents to copy had it been con
densed into two columns of average newspaper length.
Then it would have been more generally read and understood.
It might be inferred from the returns that the people
of Salem did not want the charter amended as proposed,
but the truth of the matter is that they did no care a cent
ab&ut it. Out of 5200 voters in the city 1246 cared enough
about it to go to the polls, and nearly four thousand cared
so little they did not go to the trouble of voting. As a
matter of fact there was not that many interested in the
charter; for in two precincts, the fifth and seventh, where
there were councilmen to elect the vote was m each above
"00, or more than double that of any other precinct ex-J
tcpu uic oialii. li it tu.e lu suy mm less man vw went 10
the polls on account of their interest in the charter amend'
ment.
The president told in his message what he thought of
hyphenated Americans, who were blowing up munition
factories and violating the laws of this country. It would
make interesting reading if he would now tell us what
he thought of the unhyphenated Englishmen who are
swiping American ships and violating the international
laws. - Some of those English crews could be punished
for piracy without stretching the laws very much.
As the republicans are generally in favor of "prepared
ness" or at least their leaders are, and as President Wilson
is also inclined that way; and as there seems to be about
half the citizens of the country against the movement, it
looks as though there would be a chance for a new party.
This would make a splendid opportunity for Teddy, only
he would have to do such a back-summersault that he
might not be able to make the race after it.
Marion county officials are peculiar in one respect at
least; they are carrying over into the coming year an un
expended balance of $60,000 in the treasury. A majority
of public officials see to it that all money raised by tax
ation is expended and then issue as many warrants
against the next year's increase as they can without draw
ing too much criticism.

As about everything else requires a license before any
thing can be done in a business way, why would not a
license to make laws fill a long felt want and serve as a
sort of a reminder to the legislators? A license of say
about $10 a law would prove highly beneficial to the peo
ple and cut down the expense in the state printing department.
None of the warring nations is proposing peace, but
each of them mentions the word occasionally, showing it
would not be distasteful to them. Their ideas of peace
though, are about like the small bov's definition of salt:
"That white stuff that makes your potatoes taste bad
wnen you cion t put any on."
The cloture rule will not be adopted by the senate. The
members of that body all have a desireto hear themselves
talk that is stronger than their inclination to transact
the public business with sensible consideration and
dispatch.
This is a queer old world. Here in Oregon we are pok
ing fun at Henry Ford and at the same time holding land
grant conferences, and trying to settle a row between the
government and the southern Tacific railroad.

Tho flax fibre produced at tho pen
itentiary plant bids fair to be of good
quality according to Sir Francis .Web
ster, of tho firm of FranciB Webster &
Sons, of Arbroath, Scotland, who was a
visitor at the pen yesterday afternoon
with Lady Webster and their son, W.
J. Webster. Sir Francis Webster is the
owner of three linen mills and two flax
plants In Scotland and the firm was
established in 1705. The Websters have
been visiting tho fair nt San Francisco
where a sample of tho Oregon flax was
shown and Sir Francis stopped off at
Salem to look over the situation here
on his return.
llo examined the flax now in the
process of retting and was shown that
which is tho blackest niul is pronounc
ed "rotten." Ho said this was good
fibre and of fair quality and was then
told that this was the worst grown
this year.
"If this is vour poorest quality,"
said Sir Francis, "tho best must be
exceptionally fine, indeed. '
Kven the blackest ho pronounced to
bo of good color which indicates that
there nro numerous tilings about the
production and manufacture of flax
which indicate that the causiml on
server 'is not always correct in his
judgment.
Asked about the indications for a
price for thin fibre this year tho visit
or answered that the crop conditions in
linssia and other flax countries iudi'
cated that a good price would be se
cured. Tho shortest fibre grown in
Oregon this year will probably be sold
for tow at a cheaper rate but in the
future only land that will produce a
good quality of fibre will be accepted
by tho board and it is hoped that tho
pen plant will be able to put out tho
best quality of manufactured flax in
future venrs.

Will Be "Bundle Day"
Mondny, December 13 has been des
ignated ly the Sulem Social Service
(enter as "Handle Day" when it is
hoped that every one iu the city hav
ing any clothing or shoes that 'can be
spared lor tho needy, will bundle and
send them to the commercial club, or
notify Ivan O. McDaniels at tho club,
in order that the donations may be
collected.
There is an urgent demand for cloth
ing and shoes for the poor, and espe
cially for school children. Perhaps
moro than ever before, school children
are staying out of school, not having
tho proper clothing or footwear.
The clothing sent to the commercial
club will be assorted by workers from
the Social Service Center and placed
with those most in need, and especially
in families where the men are out of
work, or where women are working to
support their children.
It is estimated that more men are
out of work this enrlv in the winter
than ever before and there is a greater
need of assistance. Tho Social Service
urges that its friends prepare their
bundles at once and seiul to tho com
mercial club, or telephone, in order
that the bundles inav oe collected next
