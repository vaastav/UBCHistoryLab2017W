What Alls
Farmers.
The action of tho Delaware State
Grange in annual session at Dover, re
ported elsewhere in this issuo,
k significant. The Grange criticised tho
Statcsenateforturningdown the Higgins
railroad commission bill; accepted an
executive committee report substantially
demanding the revocation of railroad
charters and adopted a resolution call
ing for tho opeuing of the markets
of the world to their products.
This action, taken in connection

to secure tho taxation of stocks, bonds

Last winter, when the farmers were

is a drastic remedy they propose—sub

in spite of all they could do, have been

blame ?
We think the farmers aro beginning
to find out that it is the tribute they are
paying to the "protected" interests of
tho country which is keeping them
down. They are helping to pay $ 225 ,

a conservative estimate, at leas

The Newark Ledger thinks that Wil
mington ought to pay
bridges," or words to that effect. Now
this is a contention that
all ; for the simple reason that Wilming
ton pays tho bulk of tho taxes of New
Castle county. Give Wilmington tho
♦.axes that she pays into the county
treasury and she will undoubtedly build
her own bridges. Hut it is a matter of
interest to the tax-payers of the whole
county, including Wilmington, whether
the county finances will justify the
pendituro of $100,000 for a new bridge
over tho Brandywine at this time, and,
if so, where shall that bridge be located
to servo tho best interests of Wilmington
and the county. Supposing the first
question to be answered in the affirma
tive, wo fail to understand how the
rural members of tho Levy Court will
explain to their constituents the selec
tion of Washington street ns the site.
To put tho bridge there, almost
within stone's throw of the present
bridge, will necessitate the erection of
another bridge farther up the creek in a
very few years and will bring no advan
tage worth mentioning to the people of
the rural hundreds. A bridge at Wash
ington street would no doubt be a great
convenience to pedestriaus strolling
through the park ; but a simple foot
bridge, somewhat like the one at Augus
tine mills, would meet this public need.
To the men who drive in and out of
Wilmington there would bo no object
in crossing the Brandywine at Wash
ington street. Most of them would as
lief go by way of Market street at once.
But a bridge at Broome street would
open up to public travel a large area of
both city und country. Broome Btreet
is the natural artery of West
Wilmington. It would connect the
regions east of the Brandywine
directly with tho turnpikes, and vice
versa; the Kennett, tho Lancaster and
tire Newport pikes, by
paved roads in this section,
t being macadamized through
a great part of its length. It is built up
largely with tine residences to the very
vergo of the Brandywine and is the
»st convenient outlet for the travel to
