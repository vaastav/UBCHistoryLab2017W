the sum of $1000 to that noble object.
It is reported that large quantities of
Mexican oranges are being imported
from Sonora to the United States, in
spite of the heavy duty of 65 cents a
box. The silver currency of Mexico
makes it possible for Americans to go
there and purchase oranges at $1 a box,
Mexican money, which is only equal to
45 cents per box in gold, and then make
a profit after paying duty and freight.
Mrs. Belle Owens was feeding her
chickens one day recently at Oceanside,
when a large blue sea gull which had
been flying near, alighted among the
fowls and began feeding with the flock.
Mrs. Owens,- much to her surprise, was

exhibits him to visitors, as he is tame
and apparently at home among the
chickens.

Owing to the rapid development of
the oil industry, at Summer land, in
Santa Barbara county, it has been found
necessary to undeertake the construc
tion of a dock at that place, so that the
product of the oil fields may be shipped
to San Francisco by water. Oil can be
delivered in San Francisco for 14 cents
per barrrel freight, against 51 cents, the
rate now charged by the railroad. A
company has been formedjinder the ti
tle of The Enterprise Oil and Mining

The municipal election at Ventura
resulted in a hot contest. Five candi
dates were in the field for the office of
marshal, and there was a hot .fight to
slaughter J. M. Kaiser, the successful
candidate. J. F. Kewby, for many
years town clerk, was re-elected. The
trustees were: Banker J.S. Collins, A.
Badgley, S. L. Shaw, R. C. Sudden and
T. L. Lewis. The proposition of reor
ganization for the adoption of a new
charter received the greatest vote, but
has doubtless been lost, owing to the
failure of many to vote on the question,
as it requires a majority of all the votes
cast.
Redlands is experiencing a veritable
building boom, the'operations embrac
ing many styles of edifices, from the
fine public library building, which is
being erected through the generosity of
Albert K. Smiley, to scores of modern
cottages. Work on the library was be
gun some weeks ago, and since Mr.
Smiley's recent return from the East it
has been pushed with renewed vigor.
The foundation walls are completed and
the floor joists laid. The building will
cost not less than $60,000, and will prob
ably be the finest of its kind west of the
Rockies. The site is a commanding one
at the intersection of Fourth and Vine
streets, overlooking the business section
of town and .surrounded by spacious
grounds. The architecture will be of
the Mission style, and the building will
be of brick, with trimmings of San Jose
stone, and a tile roof. It will be L
shaped, and at the intersection of the
two wings there will be a tower sur
mounted by a dome fifty feet high. The
interior will be fitted up with oak, pan
eled ceilings, etc., and the building will
be heated with steam and lighted by gas
and electricity. It will be called the
Smiley Library, and will prove a last
ing memorial to the Smiley family,
who have done so much for Redlands.

HIÑES AND MINING.
Ore that assays 12 ounces in gold and
70 ounces in silver haa been discovered

ore from the Rand inining,district.

trict. In the clean-up were two nug

The Fresno county oil district, near
Huron, on the west side, is developing
very satisfactorily. There are now eix
wells flowing good streams of petro
leum, and several carloads of crude oil
are being shipped out daily. Two com
panies, in which eastern capitalists are
largely interested, are boring wells, and
some big develompents are expected.
A correspondent writes from Danby,
San Bernardino county, regarding the
mining district south of that place. He
says that rich ore has been taken out
and is being taken out by mining men,
who have gone to work in a business
like way, but that the district has been
queered by speculators and inexperi
enced operators.
A corporation with millions of capital
behind it has been organized for the
development of mining properties in
tne United States and Territories and
in British North America. On this side
of the Atlantic John W. Mackay, Henry
L. Leiter and D. O. Mills are reported
to be among the heaviest stockholders,
while in Euroep the Rothscihlds, the
Duke of Teck and other nobles are
named.
A two-stamp mill has recently been
erected at the mine owned by T. J.
Harris & Bros, of San Emigdio. The
property is located on Frazier moun
tain, Ventura county. The first mill
run of twelve tons of ore was made
about a month ago, and the clean-up
produced over $300, making it more
than $25 per ton of ore. There is a large L
amount of ore in sight, which will prob
ably run higher than the first milling.
Several gold mines at Camp Todd, in
San Mateo canyon, a few miles from
Fallbrook, have been sold to a company
that has already begun trie construc
tion of a road right in and will at once
proceed to erect a smelter. The prices
obtained for the mines are considered
low. Four of them were sold for about
$8000, but as this involves the building
of a road and the erection of a smelter,
it is satisfactory, to the camp at least.
San Diego Union.
Within the last few weeks a very rich
strike of gold bearing ore has been made
within ten miles of San Bernardino.
Almost all of the prospecting done by
residents of this locality is done out on
the desert and little attention has been
paid to trying to locate mines close at
home. The rich strikes made in Lytle
Creek for the last 20 or 25 years has
demonstrated that the mountains north
and west of here contain gold and that
all that is needed to locate good claims
is a thorough prospecting.
The first active and efficient advertis
ing of the gold resources of California
since the beginning of the revival will
be that afforded by the great Golden
Jubilee and the fair to be started at .
about the same time, January 24 next.
California is the most inviting and
profitable region in the world, and thio
is so evident that men may easily be
convinced of it. Its record is so vast
and its legitimate production and pros
pertiy at the present time are so great
that it cannot suffer by being regarded
as a "boom" region out of which the
bottom may fall. The Klondike rush
of next spring is the thing which has
mainly impelled the mining and busi
ness men to get up the mining exposi
tion which is planned. Especial efforts
are to be made in many ways to draw
this travel and the trade accompanying
it to San Francisco as the point of out
fitting and departure. The San Fran
cisco Miners' Association proposes to
do for mining what the State Board of
Trade has been doing in its field.
FROM FOREIGN LANDS.
The Tope is suffering severely from
rheumatism.
The treaty of peace between Turkey
and Greece was signed Saturday.

Pliilimiine islands on October 6, wiping
out whole towns and leaving a long list
of dead in its wake. Two hundred and
fifty Europeans and as many natives
were killed.
The Mexican government has granted
concessions to a French syndicate, rep
resented by Pablo Leroll, for the build
ing of 300 miles of irrigating ditches in
the slate of Chiapas and a railroad
through the district to be irrigated.
The syndicate is required to expend 25,
000,000 francs.
