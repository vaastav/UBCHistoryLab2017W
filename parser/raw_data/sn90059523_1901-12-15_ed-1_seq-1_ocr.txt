SIGNOR MARCONI ANNOUNCES A
REALLY STARTLING ADVANCE
IN WIRELESS WORK
SIGNAL FROM CORNWALL
Often Repeated, It Is Distinctly
Heard?by the Inventor at a L.a.- ,
tion 1,700 Miles Away in
Newfoundland _
OTHER TESTS TO BE PLANNED
7 ST. .. JOHNS, N. F., Dec. l 14.—Sgr.
Marconi announced the most: wonderful
scientific discovery of modern times to
night in .stating that he had received
electric signals across the Atlantic ocean
from his station in Cornwall, England.
He explains that before leaving England
he made plans for accomplishing this* re
sult, for, while. his primary object was
to communicate with ocean liners in m'd
ocean, he hoped also to succeed- in at
taining the wonderful v achievement of
wireless telegraphy across the Atlantic.
Marconi's station in Cornwall is most
powerful. - l*r possesses an electric force,
generated there, 100 times greater than
at his ordinary stations. Before he let' _
England he arranged that the electrician
in charge of the station, which is located
at Poldhu, should begin sending signals
daily after a certain date which Marconi
would cable him after having perfected
his arrangements here.
Marconi arrived here a week ago Fri
day, selected Signal hill, at the entrance
to the harbor, as an experimenting sta
tion and moved his equipment, there.
East Monday he cabled to the Poldhu
startion to - begin sending signals at 3 p.
m. dally and to continue them until 6
p. m., these hours being respectively 11:30
a. m. to 2:30 p. m. St. Johns' time."AA Vj
- Heard Signals Wednesday.
During these hours Wednesday. Sgr.
Marconi elevated a kite with an aerial
wire by means of which signals are sent
or received. He remained at the record
er attached to the receiving apparatus,
and to his profound satisfaction signals
were received.by him at intervals, ac
cording to the programme arranged pre
viously with the operator at Poldhu. \
These signals consisted of repeating a I
intervals the letter "S," which in Mar
coni's code is made by three dots or
quick strokes. This signal was repeated
so frequently and so in accordance "with
the detailed plan arranged , to provide
safeguards against possibility of mistake
that Marconi was satisfied that It was
a genuine transmission from England.
Again on Thursday, during the same
hours, the kite was elevated and the
same signals were removed. This made
the assurance so complete that Marconi
cabled to his principals in England, and
also Informed the governor of Newfound
land, Sir Cavendish Boyle, who appraised
the British cabinet of the success of the
experiments. 7 j.22X.
More Complete Test Needed.
Marconi; though , satisfied of the
genuineness of the signals, . and that he
has succeeded in his attempts in estab
lishing communication across the At
lantic without the use of wires, em
phasizes the fact that the system is yet
only In an embryonic stage, and that the
possibility of its ultimate development Is
demonstrated by the success of the pres
ent experiments with incomplete and im
perfect apparatus, as the signals can only
be received by the most sensitively ad
justed ' apparatus. Marconi is working
under great difficulties owing to the con
ditions prevailing here. The . Cclnwall
coast is 1,700 miles from St.; Johns. * .
In view of the success attending these
trials, Sgr. Marconi will for the present
disregard the matter of. communicating
with transatlantic steamers. He will re
turn to England next week and conduct
the experiments from Poldhu himself. He
explains that the greater electrical power
there -will enable him to send more effec
tive signals. He will undertake this work
himself, leaving assistants here to erect
a mast and receive the signals as he for
wards them.
It is not possible to send return signals
from he>« until a powerful electric bat
tery shall have been installed.
fWill Bnild Better Station.
Marconi intends to build a large, fully
equipped experimental station near St.
Johns besides the Lloyd's station at Cap
Race. The former will have the same
equipment as the Poldhu station, and will
play the same part on this side of the
Atlantic as Poldhu does on the other side.
The St. Johns station will communicate
with New York on one side and Corn
wall on the other, being midway between
the two. This, establishment will prob
ably cost about $60,000, and will perform
the same work as the modern cable sta
tion. ~'--\ •.'---.
Marconi announces that he will remain
in England until after the coronation of
King Edward next summer, and that he
hopes to send the news of that event
across the Atlantic by the wireless
method so as to prove the capability of
the system for such purposes. He will
probably in the meantime equip all ves
sels of the leading lines of steamers with
his apparatus. y.
Knew It All the -Time. '? :,
NEW YORK, ? Dec. 14.-H. Cuthbert
Hall, manager of the Wireless Teleg
raphy company, said tonight:'- "I was
not at all surprised. We have been ex
pecting it and have been prepared for
such news. I got a cable from Marconi
himself this morning in which he stated
he had received messages from Cornwall
without wires. • Marconi has been experi
menting, and we felt-confident he would
accomplish the signaling. It is a magnif
icent discovery and a remarkable one.
We have been making preparations for
putting the discovery into active practice
and will now go ahead with our plans,
which are complete to almost the fullest
extent.";

Roosevelt will not accept the offer of
Andrew Carnegie of ? $10,000,000 of bonds
of the . United States Steel - corporation
for the. purpose of founding an institu
tion for higher education in this: city.
The views of prominent senators; and
representatives as they have" been given
to the president are practically unani
mous against the acceptance of the offer
in its present' shape. The provision at
tached to the offer that the govern
ment shall hold the bonds for a term

AUTONOMY REPORT A WONDER
Sop Thrown to Socialists, but the
Declaration Adopted \ls Most
- Distinctly Favorable to
y.'A??;A. 7 Trade Unionism
W^o£& ? DEBATE CUT ... OUT
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 14.—The Amer
ican Federation of Labor in ; the last min
utes of ?this? afternoon's session put it
self on record on ? two questions which
have been agitating the delegates since
the convention convened ? ten \ days ago—
namely, trade autonomy and 7 socialism.
The greater of the two in the minds' of
the most of the delegates was that of
autonomy. --
In brief, the ; special \ committee on - au
tonomy recommended that where there
are only a few craftsmen in a large in
dustrial concern the best interests of all
would be conserved by the? few joining
the paramount organization in such es
tablishment, and the promulgation 7 of
sub-divided crafts into districts and na
tional trade -councils where all disputes
should be settled. The ? recommenda
tions of the committee, to the surprise
of many, 7 were unanimously adopted
without a single remark being made -by
anyone. 7 yiyV '.'"*"" - ;,"
The recommendations are viewed dif
ferently by the delegates. . The miners,
who have favored ' industrial autonomy,
and who have put 7 that principle into
effect in the mines, looked upon it as a
victory, while the brewery workmen,
pressmen and 'longshoremen saw some
concessions in the report. Many were
displeased and declared that .the whole
report was no more than a "straddle,"
and .that the question will come up
again: - .''-77-... ~
Committee's Conclusions. • Jy.
The recommendations of the commit
tee's report are as follows: ;
First—As the magnificent growth of
the American Federation of Labor is
conceded by all students- of economic
thought to be the result !of organization
in trade lines, and believing it - neither
necessary nor expedient 7to - make y any
radical departure from this fundamental
principle,. we declare .that as a general
proposition the interests of 7 the work
ers will be best conserved by adhering
as closely to that doctrine .as the recent
great changes jj in methods of production
and employment make practicable. How
ever, owing to the isolation of some few
industries from thickly ? populated cen
ters,*? where" the overwhelming number
follow one branch thereof, owing to the
fact that in some industries compara
tively few workers are engaged and over
whelming separate '.- organizations claim
jurisdiction, we believe that jurisdiction
in such industries by the paramount or
ganization would yield the best; results
to .-the workers therein. Nothing con
tained in this declaration Is ' intended t>r
shall; be' construed to mean ; a reve-Jfal
of any decision rendered by former exec
utive councils or previous conventions
on questions of jurisdiction.
T Second—We hold that the interests of
the trade union movement will be pro
moted by closely allying the subdivided
craft, giving consideration to . amalgama
tion and to the organization of district
and national trade councils to which
should be referred questions in dispute,
and which should ■ be adjusted within al
lied craft - lines. ?■• 'A'S-AT
y Third— American , Federation of
Labor, being a voluntary association,
cannot direct and should not adopt meth
ods antagonistic to or in conflict with
established trade union-laws, and in or
der to carry the - above.;-. recommendation
into, effect, and in full recognition of its
logical position, the American Federa
tion of Labor pledges its officers to aid

. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—The secretary
of; the navy has ;' before y him for 'review
the report of ; the , court of inquiry ,in the I
Schley case. S The question has been rais
ed since the appearance of two reports
in print, how far Admiral -Dewey, the
president of the court, subscribed to th
opinion expressed. in the first' report and
in findings by appending his signature
that signature being required of,:him.ap
parently, by the. regulation above alluded
to,- regardless, of his individual opinion.
In response' to inquiry on this point, the
judge advocate of the navy says:
"According to naval practice,' Admiral
-Dewey, by affixing his signature to the
report" of the court of inquiry in the .case
of; Rear 7 Admiral 2 Schley, ; expresses j full
/concurrence in all I the findings of fact and
in : all the opinions 'reached by the court
except those with respect to which he has
in terms signified [dissent in his minority
opinion." - 'y

/-CHICAGO, -Dec." j : U.— The /^bankers T^bf A
Chicago were-, given a banquet by *7. the
-Marquette club tonight. In- addition to
speeches- by ex-Comptroller James AHy
'Eckels, president of the ■ Commercial - Na- *
tional bank, and President; 7 James B.
Forgan,'-of the First National bank, -
'■ there .was one by jA. ?B.'*. Stickney, presi
dent of the Chicago Great Western | Rail
way company, who was the principal 7
guest of the evening. ':'
Mr. Stickney's subject was "The Cen
tral Reserve Bank,*' and/he' contended
that a central reserve bank/, would /.not':
and could not become a-: monopoly, ex- T
tending its branches to every village and j
driving all other banks out of existences
The necessity of keeping 45 p*ar cent of
reserve [would j render .it incapable vrf
competing, except in the larger . transac- /
tions, with the other.banks,:wn:.*;ri..would -
carry no more than 5 to 8 per cent of?
reserve. The reserve, he said, Is '.they
regulator. of the banking business As f A..
--matter, of fact/he went on to say, the
banks of , England, Scotland: and Wales y
have 4,921 branches. The banking busi- .
ness outside of London is entirely in the
possession of the other bank:>. Some of
the other banks, both in and out. of Lon
don, in point of deposits, rival the Hank
of England, and. in. the matter of loans
outstrip; it. -..-,. ' 7 ''--7
AA" Would Abolish the Treasury. 7
"It is my conviction," .he said, "thaty
there is no safety, and can be no safety,'
to financial affairs in ' the United States 1
until the treasury is abolished;-; but at
the same time we must not close -ourj
eyes to the fact that it has become an ?
Integral part of the banking system, arid
cannot be safely destroyed until a central;
reserve bank has been developed.- Other*-;
wise the duty of protecting the^gold* re- •:
serve from exportation would- fall : upon £
4,064 national and 5,648 state banks y and - *
institutions. The impossibility of more I
than ' 9,000 separate banks protecting? the
gold I reserve against exportation would
of : itself * necessitate a central reserve
bank, to "which would be delegated -the.■•
sole? responsibility of protecting the re
serve. --ATT';
7 "It is my conviction that if the restrlc-
JlojoaTof. the American banking laws were
repealed and banking-made, free, thefd
I would;be;developed in the United States
j a banking system substantially on ; tho
lines. of the Scotch-English system. In
process of time * one of the systems sof
I branch banks would demonstrate itsi>flt** *'
ness, and solely by reason of Its superior
I fitness— -by - force of legislation—it
would be selected by the other banks as
''the' central j reserve bank. A bank /thus
evolved, it may be assumed, would be
fit— both in respect to financial . responsi
bility and in respect.to the character and
capacity of Its directors and , manager*^*
for the government to enter intoytno
ordinary relationship of customer ; and L|
bank. •; '*'"
Free From Partisan Legislation. . -
"Such is the central bank which .1 .ad-:
vocate—a bank produced by evolution and '•*
controlled by the natural laws of trade
.instead of a bank controlled by partisan,
ill-considered and compromise' legislation. y
Under free banking-laws many—and { per- ".;
haps. a majority—of the present banks,
would ? continue :to . conduct local," inde- :
pendent banks: for an indefinite | period.
Being free,- they could continue their in
dependent banks as long as they saw. fit. .
More than *14 per cent of the .banks of -
England have no branches. '. T "■-'XX
Candor compels me to admit: that there *
is, and has been ever since the destruc
tion of the old United States bank— which?
was an entirely different type from g the
modern central reserve bank—a strong
y prejudice in the American mind against
a central bank. But it is my-contention?
that this prejudice grows ; out of a mis
conception of the modern central reserve
: bank and ; its? functions and powers, and ;
I have that confidence in the Intelligence I
of the people which leads •me; to believe 7
that they are capable of rising above
these prejudices when they understand
the facts.
"The economic propositions in regard to [
the use of silver as the standard of value,
involved in ;.the politicalv campaign y of
1890,' were much more difficult of compre- 7
hension and ran counter to the -strongA
prejudices of probably a majority of the ;7
voters; but after the fallacies were ex- ;
plained the cause? of 7"sound - money was '..
easily triumphant.. It Is my : conviction ; ,
that another campaign :? of - education
.would make the.proposition of free bank
ing possible of realization.','
