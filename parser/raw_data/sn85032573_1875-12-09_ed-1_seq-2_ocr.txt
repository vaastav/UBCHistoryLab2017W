That Third Term Business.
In an editorial, a few days wnci-, the
Common wealth deprecated the "third
term" talk, taking grounds t-quiuely
against the nolicy its plausibility or
.possibility. The Lawrence Standard,
the next day commends the m.tiily po
sition of the State paper, declaring
that no other Republican paper of the
State h-icl been so outspoken. Follow
ing the latter tlio,iVtc1iioii Chnmpim
makes quotations and asserts that, uol
only a largo number of the State in
Republican Conventions .leseinblcd,
bad declared against a "third term,"
but that the Republican parly of Kuii
sas had formally done the same thing,
which action had been most .heartily
and uuaiilmnurly upheld and endorsed
by the Republican papers of Kansas.
Wc have mislaid the articles alluded
to and cannot, therefore, quote the
words, but the Champion U right.
The question arises in our mind
why, at this time, the Co.wii'inwealth's
article? The ' third term" business
was an invention of the New York
Democracy in the first place. Asa
proposition to startle, as an assertion
that Irom its nature was. hard to put
down or deny, it proved nn effective
weapon against our part for many
months. As a party, we knew that
such a political programme wa never
dreamed of, nor did we believe that
our patriotic I'rcsideul e, er contem
plated buch ti step, nevertheless, the
Democracy kept asserting, and the
Republicans, in convention, denjing.
until the "third term' scare had lost
all its force.
II the Commonwealth will permit us
we will venture a statement of the
reason for such an article at this time,
nud it is this : Notwithstanding its
Democraticauthorship and its continu
al spurning by the President and the
Republican party and its organs, the
"third term" idea is rapidly gaining
ground throughout the entire Nation !
And this "third term" sentiment is not
traceable to Fedeial ofliseholduieith
er, for the chances of a Republican
success ,with .ucli a foneeded load
arctoodespernto'for them to risk its
juWoCuc'y, but it comes from a convic
tionbased upon a thousand circum
stances and overt acts that Hie
country, its institutions and lately
gained liberties would be safer in tried
hands!
What answer?
Opening of tho XLIVth Concrees.
The opening of the Fort -Fourth
Congress at Monday noon, was marked
with the largest crowd that ever be
fore gathered at the capital of our
country upon a like occasion.
The House was called to order b
Mcl'herson, the clerk of the last House
and the hall was denied.
Lamar moved that the House pro
ceed to the election of Speaker.
Agreed to.
Lamar put in nomination for the of
fice of Speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives of the Forlx-lourth Con
gress, Michael C. Kerr, member elect
from the State of Indiana.
Wheeler, of New York, nominated
for the same position Ja?. G. Blainc,of
the State of Maine.
The clerk asked whether there wcic
any other nominations, and there being
no response he appointed as telleis
llolman, Clyuicr, Danforth and Banks-
The House then voted with the fol
lowing result :
Whole number of votes cist. 280;
necessary to a choice, 141 Michael C.
Kerr received 173 voles; J. G. Blaine
received OC; A. S. Williams, of Michi
gan, 1; Win. Anderson, of Illinois, 1.
The clerk appointed Randall and
Blaine to escort the Speaker elect to
the chair.
AsMr. Kerr wa conducted down tin
main aisle to the Speaker's chair then
was considerable clapping of hand
on the Democratic side of the lIotii.
which was stilled as Mr. Kerr began
a short speech, promising complete
fairness and impartiality to all.
Kelly, of Pennsylvania, the oldest
member of the Houe in continuous
scrvice, adiniiiisteied the oath of office
to the Speaker. The oath was then
administered by the Speaker to mem
bers, beginning with tlio-e from the
New England States. What is known
as the iron-clad oath was formerly ad
ministered to members generally, but
some of the Southern members being
unable to take that oath, the modified
oath was adminiterrd to them.
The Senate whs promptly called to
order at 12 m., by tho Hon. T. W. Fer
ry, of Michigan, President pro icm.
Tho Rev. T. D. Sundci land, chaplain
offered prayer, in which lie invited the
Divine blcsing on the President of the
United States, Congress, and upon the
whole Nation, and referred to deaths
occurring since the lat session.

" " 'fite'tnftfal resolutions to notify the
House and the President that a quorum
of the Senate had assembled and was
ready for bu-iu'ess, were adopted, and
at 12 m. took a recess for a half hour.
On reassembling, Mr. Boutwcll an
nounced the death of Vice President
Wilson, and said that at an early day
resolutions relating to his life, charac
ter aud public services would, be of-

The President's Message.
The President's message was not de
livered until Tuesday noon, so we learn
by a private telegram from Topcfca. It
is a very lengthy State paper, contain
ing nearly 18,000 words, and covers al
most two pages of matter. By bidd
ing back the Kaolr two or three hours
aud keeping our force up all night, we
ore enabled to present it toourrcadcrs
in tho form of a supplement.
The Champion Thief.
The papers of yesterday contain the
not unlookcd for announcement that
Boss Tweed had escaped from custody
and Is now at large. Tho old sinner
begged to be allowed to visit his wife's

Tlsat Apportionment Again.
Two weeks since we wrote a short
artirle on the State apportionment to
be made this winter. The. whv we
said anything, probably, wa. treatise,
the question was receiving considera
ble attention at the hands of the edit
ors throughout the State. What we
said was that newspaper articles
amounted to cry little, and that "af
"ter thi winter it will bo tho fault of
"the people of the interior if all the
"offices nro ;:iveii to a few tovn, if all
"the -latroungo is bestowed on men
"and places representing only a frac
linii of the population and wealth of
"State; the fault of the rural districts
"if each and every section the west
"and south as well as the cast are not
"honorably and fairly represented and
"carod for politically, commercially
"aud materially for all future time."
Of the effect of this squib we allude
in an article under editorial notes on
the first page. Since writing that the
Topeka Commonwealth comes to hand
containing not only our article in full
but the following sharp reply made by
that able, and ordinarily fair, journal
the Atchison Champion, which sa s :
"Our friend Murdoch docs avixy
unjust and mischievous thing in thus
attcnipliuir to create a prejudice be
tween different portion of ho State,
and wo regret very much to see this
lame spirit exhibited in papers in
Western d Southwestern Kansas. It
is not true that any injustice has been
done Southern or Western Kansas in
the apportiomcut If counties in that
region have a smaller leprcscntation
now than their population entitle
them to, it is due to theirrapid growth
and not to anything for Which the Leg
islature is responsible. Apportion
ment, are based on population returns,
as friend Murdock well knows-, ami wo
believe that the present apportionment
of tho was, if not entirely, very neail
his own work, while a member of the
State Senate.
Of course E.i-icrn Kansas had for a
long time, a majority of the Legisla
ture because it had" nearly all of the
population. As settlement extended
westward this difference in population
decreased, aud has now :diuost entirely
disappeared The representation ol
the west has increased with each suc
ceeding apportionment, and as the
number ol Representatives aud Sena
tors was limited the representation ol
the east has decreased. We outgrow
the apportionment in Kansas as rapid
ly as a boy does a suit of clothes; and
this growth is. very naturally, more
marked in the western than the eastern
counties, because there is more room
for growth in the west.
In one respect, however, Eastern
Kansas voluntarily gac the new and
sparsel settled counties the advantage
in appoitioiiiueuls. The constitution,
ailopted when all ot what is now
known as Western Kansas was unin
habited, provides that each organized
county should have at least one Rep
resentative. The con-equeiice of 'his
provision i, that while one Represent
ative in many ol the eastern counties
represents ti oin six to eight thousand
people, in many of the western coun
ties the Representatives represent not
more than from four hundred to a
tliousaud people.
But outside of all these thing', Kan
sas is Kansas, and whatever benefits
one section of the State benefits all
other sections. We arc just as proud
of the rapid growth and splendid de
velopment of the Arkansas Valley as
our friend Murdock can possibly be.
and uc believe that we can say with
perfect truth, that the Champion, here
uti the eastern border of the Slate, has
published as much concerning Western
Kausns, has done as much to direct ini
migratiou thither, ami has always man
ifested just as lively, active and help
ful an interest in the growth, develop
ment and prosperity ot that section of
the State as has the'Wichita Eacli:.
Eastern Kansas has never maiulc-t-cd
any jealousy of Western Kansas.
Tin! people of the eastern border and
central counties feel that they aie
identified with those of the west in
interest and in sentiment, and thai
wtiatever i elps one of them helps all
of thuin. Even dollar added to the
value of Sedgwick enmity helps to p-iv
the expenses of the State government,
aud takes something from theburdeu.
of Atchison county, and vice versa.
If this city had a hundred thousand
inhabitants and a taxable valuation of
a hundred million dolla-s, would not
every man in Sedgwick county be
tieuelited llierenv ( In unci, we are
all interested mutually in the prosperi
ty, growth and development of even,
piiitioii of the State, and there is no
cause or rea-ou for jealousy or bicker
ing between different localities.
If the Eacilr means to provoke a
sectional feeling that would lead to
tho uouiiusiiiou aud elect ion of un
worthy or inco.Mpotent men living in
one section, or to thedcleat of worth
and competent men bee me they hap
pen to live in another, it is doing a
very mischievous thing. Nobod)
knows better than the editor of the
Eaoi.i: that it would be prepoterous
1 absurd to preeut a man as a cindi
diitc for auv position simply becau-e
of his locally. If Sedgw.ck count
can present the best man in the State
tor Governor. orSenator, or Congress
man, he ought to be elected; but it
not, and she presents a candidate sim
ply because he lives within her bor
ders, he ought not to receive any con
sideration whatever in any part o." the
State. We do not mean to say, of
course, that the best men lnvc ahvas
been seicctcd in this State, because
niieh an assertion would be notorious
ly untrue. But we do mean to say
that the mere fact that a man lives in
SMiuthcrn, or Northern, or Eastern, or
Western Kansas, should not entitle
him to any support, nor should it pro
voke opposition to him.
T'-ie Eagi.h's article intimates that
Western Kansas will soon be in a po
sition to make war on Eastern Kansas
people, and seems to advie and en
courage vuch a war. Wo don't believe
that friend Murdock means any such
thing, and still less do wo believe that
he could induce any general co-operation
of the poople of Western Kansas
in such a war, if he did. Wo f Ivan
s;is arc one people, having common in
lercst, common associations and sym
pathies, and a common govcruuiciit.
We shall prosper or fail together. And
vc will continue, we hope, to appre
ciate this fact, to act together, and help
one another, knowing that whatever
helps one sectiun helps all the rest".
To all of the above wo briefly and
succinctly answer:
No attempt was made upon our part
to stir up local strife, or to create a
prejudice between different portions
of Kansas. The animus of our article
will admit of no such conclusion.
Colonel Martin does us infinitely too
much honor in speaking of the present
apportionment. At that time wo rep
resented a different portion ot the
State entirely. Ho must have been
thinking of tho Congressional appor
tionment. We were a member of both
committees, but to Sol. Miller, then
Senator, tho rural districts owe, more
than to any one else, what they did
Set.
That there is more room for im
provement in the western than in the
eastern counti.es we admit, in a material
sense, but in political generosity aud
fairness we can't see it. The history
of the Republican party in Kansas
docs violence to the presumption.
That the constitution gives the new
and sparsely settled counties an ad
vantage in apportionments, is a spe
cious humbug. Under this delightluli
advantage we, two years ago, tried to t
represent 60.OC0 people of a dozen '
counties in the State Senate.
ThafEustcrii Kansas has never man
ifested any jealously of Western Kan--
sas, is a proposition mat mignt no
swallowed bv a man who never was a
member of a Kansas Legislature, or a
Kausag State Cotrvcntion and,- rrurid-
iug, ho had uol read the article to
which wc aVe replying.
That the Eaqlk is provoking a sec
tional feeling which would lead to the
nomination and election of incompe
tent men we think is true, in the esti
mation of the Champion. Was not
Colonel Martin a member of the last
State Convention? Wo thou ask him
where Prof. Norton is to-day? aud
how felt the solid southwestern dele
gation that asked his nomination after
being snubbed by Eastern Kansas on
another small office?
In conclusion, for the sake of that
harmony so largely dwelt upon by the
Champion, and to make proper amends
for wounded feelings and fears caused
by our ill-advised words, wo will ac
knowledge that Southwestern Kansas
Congressmen or Governors; that it is
has no men fit forUtiitcd States Senators
presumption in us, because of our
newness, to even ask a representation
in tho Legislature, and. that rather
than provoko the opposition and feel
ing so soundly contemned, wo will
agree to let Northeastern Kansas go
on furnishing all the officers, only hop
ing that our people will not bo denied
tho humble privilege of voting for the
able men whom Eastern Kansas, in
her "common associations" and "sym
pathies" may present for our suffrage
and support.
Tho Democratic Beacon.
The Wichita Beacon, our cotempo
rary, becomes a Democratic headlight,
not only for Wichita but Southwest
ern Kansas, wc judge. In its issue of
yesterday morning i says, in conform
ity with the original design it declares
for Democratic principles. Well, we
don't know any reason why it should
not. One half of Congress the popu
lar half over one half of the State
Governors is of that stamp, and the
impending great National light will be
maintained on tho otic side by that
party. If tho Deacon but maintains
its present literary excellence ami local
enterprise, it will not onlv hold tho
same relation to the Democratic parly
in Southwestern Kansas that the Ea
gle has held to the Republican party,
but will be recognized by the Demo
cratic party of the State as a promi
nent organ and valuable auxiliary.
Regardless of the sigusof the times,
and notwithstanding anydesigns upon
the post office, we wish our neighbor
continued prosperity.
Tho Board of Directors of tho South
western Kansas Fair Asso

by Hon. John Kelly aud Col. T. D.
Font', of this county, to the same end.
Mr. II. W. Beck, o'f Butler, made a
shirt speech in which he s'ated that
Butler county would bo fully up with
her large and growing interests.
Upon motion an election of perma

At the meeting of tho Society next
day many matters of interest wcredis
euscd, a large number of citizens and
siockholdcis of the Sedgwick County
Fair Grounds being present and taking
an active pail. Among other plans,
all of which appeared feasible, it was
proposed to transfer the proper!,
grounds and improvements of the
county society to the district society,
the latter proposing to add three thou
sand dollars in improvements previous
to the fair of 187G. Culbertson, Kolm;
Matthewson, Balderstou, A. A. Moore,
W. B. Smith and others endorsed the
plan with much enthusiasm.
Col. Fouts was appointed to revise

A LETTER FROM WASHINGTON.
The Kansas Delegation, RobelLoaf
ora, and Things Generally.
Washington, Dr.c. 3, 1875.
iron. 21. 31. Murdock:
Editou Eagi.e : In compliance with
your request, I embrace this first op
portunity of jotting down a few ob
servations made- during my travels. 1
left home on the tenth ulttimo.arrivcd
in Washington on the 15'h. Tho lGlh
and 17th wa3 engaged in arguing con
test land cases ucforc tho General
Land flico. At that date but few
members of Congress had arrived, but
tho hotels were filled with Democratic
office seekers. Candidates for ivery
office, from chief clerk down to pages,
were here, each anxious to present his
claim first.
On tho morning of the 17th Hon.
John J. Ingalls, the United States
Senator from Kansas, arrived here
with his family. HiR residence is 939,
"K" street. As an index of the stand
ing of Senator lugalls in tho National
capital, it is but necessary to state thai
he had not been in the city more than
half an hour before the news wa
spread over the city and at tho De
partments, that Senator Ingalls, from
Kansas, had arrived. In him Kan-as
has a representative possessing abilin
aud influence.
The Farmer-Granger Senator, James
M. Harvey, has not yet arrived, at
least I havo not heard of his arrival.
Congressman, Win. A. PhiHips,froiu
the first district, is hero. He and Sena
tor Ingalls arc both busy looking aftei
the interest of their constituents.
Hon. John R. Goodin, fi'om tho sec
ond district, has not yet arrived, he
being detained in Ohio by the illnes
of his mother and sister, who I learn
are lying dangerously ill. His coming
is anxiously looked for by the domi
nant patty in the House, also by man
aspirants for office, all of whom con
cede that Mr. Goodin will be a leadei
among them.
Hon. W. R. Brown, who was elected
by tho Republicans of the third dis
irict to represent the people of said
district, is in tho citv, at least, Alex.
Banks says ho is here. Bythowa.v,
that prince of good fellows, Alex.
Banks, for years chief clerk of the
Kansas House of Representatives, i
now private secretary to Senator In
galls and chief clerk of the Committee
on Pensions, of which tho Senator is
chairman.
On tho ISth I went on to Philadel
phia. Remained there one week, ex
amining the various Centennial build
ings in course of erection. The Main
Exhibition, Agricultural and Memori
al halls are all approaching completion
rapidly. They are magnificent build
ings. The main hall covers 21.47 acres,
the agricultural hall, 10.15 acres, the
memorial buildiug,1.7o acres, machine
ry hall 13.94 acres. Ton to fifteen large
hotels have been erected near the
grounds, containing from one hundred
to fifteen hundred rooui3 each. Exten
sive arrangements are being made all
over the city for tho accommodation
of the legions that are expected to be
there during 1S76. Every man who
owns a business house, hotel or dwell
ing thinks he has a bonanza.
After eating a sumptuous thanks
giving dinner at thoGirard I took the
train for New York and spent Friday
and Saturday viewing the city, visit
ing all the places of interest. At iia
p. in. the body of Vice President Wil
son arrived 'ahtl'was escorted through
the city by the old Seventh and other
New York regiments. The mililar
display was grand in the extreme. On
Sunday morning, the 23th, I, in com
pany with Frank Shannon, formerly
of Wichita, who is now residing in
New York and engaged at tlicManhat
tan gas works, while his estimable
wile i3 keeping a first-class boarding
house at 79. McDougal street. Went
over to Brooklyn to hear Rev. Hour
Ward Beecher vrcach. Alter the usu
al prayer and singing he read for his
text the eighth chapter of Romans,
sixteenth ver-e, from which he preach
ed an eloquent and powerful sermon.
He is still alive, notwithstanding the
efforts ofTiltou aud Mrs. Moultou to
kill him. In the afternoon wc visited
Coutr.il Park and took a stroll up
'Fifth Avenue, which it is said con
tains a greater number of elegant resi
dences than any other one street in the
world. Chief among them is tho mar
ble palace of A. T. Stewart, the mil
lionaire. I returned to this city ycrterday to
find the excitement a fever head. Th
grcat fight is for the Speakership. The
contest at present is between Randall,
of Pennsylvania, and M. C. Kerr of
Indiana. 1 think R.iudall is the com
ing man. For the interest of the Re
publican parly ho is undoubtedly the
best take. Banks, of Mississippi, for
Chief Clerk and Thompson, of Ohio,
for Sergcant-at-Arin, will, in all prob
ability, cirry off the bets. But of all
the old fossils in tho world, tho old
rebel hunkers who have been dead for
tho last fifteen years, but who have
been rcsuriccted since tho last fall
elections and have come up here with
the moss still growing on their backs,
as seekers after office, beats thorn all.
The lame, the blind, the spavined and
tho string halt are all hero crving,
"give, give! for I am tho best rebel of
them all." They have been cursing
tho Government ever since 185S, but
now that they have a chance for a suck
at tho public tit they arc furious, con
stantly boasting of their chivalrous
deeds during the rebellion and of how
many d d niggers they have killed
since. 1 inquired -of a prominent Dem
ocrat, a former member of Congress,
to-day as to how the fight was going.
His reply was, "Colonel, I have partici
pated in all the political contests in
Washington for the last thirty years,
but this is the meanest and most dis
graceful one I have ever witnessed."
It has narrowed down to a personal
fight among the leading candidates.
They are charging each other with be
ing thieves, ring masters, robbers,
murderers, gamblers, ete. You may
look for an explosion in the caucus on
Saturday. John Morrisey is here bet
ting heavily on Randall, offeiing ten
to two. Pools are constantly selling,
with Randall first choice, Kerr second
aud Cox third.
Important changes havo just taken
place in the Indian Department.
Agent Gibson goes out and Cyrus
Beetle, now chief clerk for Superin
tendent Hoag, takes his place. Super
intendent Ilnag also goes nut aud Dr.
Nicholson, of Lawrence. Kansas, suc
ceeds him. This is good news for the
citizens of Southwestern Kansas.
But as this letter is already too long
I will stop. More anon.

awaiting trial.
Tho report shows the operations of
the various bureaus of the department
concerning which much information
ha already been published.
The money order department, the
annual transactions of which have
reached about eighty millions, shows
an apparent profit of $120,000, though
it is really in arrears more than that, if
the clerk hire and stationery required
for tho business were charged directly
lo its account. Tho increase of rates
on small orders, made by authority of
last Congress, will, it is believed, ena
ble tho the bureau to hereafter pay its
own expenses.
Tho tact that but one American
steamship line carries mails across the
Atlantic ocean and none to South
America is regarded humiliating to
American pride.
Mr. Jewell thinks that as a matter id
national pride, as an aid to a levivalof
American commerce, and as a moans
of supplying an efficient steam marine,
available tor immediate use by the
Government in case of war, provision
should bo madr for transportation of
our mails, on the important ocean
rotiii's, on steamers officered and
manned by our own citizens, and sail
ing under our own flag.
A moderate compensation in excess
if postage now allowed, would enable
ihe establishment and mafiiicuaucc of
American lines to Europe and South
America, and a moderate mail com
pensation for a lino to China and Jap
an, will doubtless continue tho mail
service to thoe countries in American
-hips after the termination of tho ex
isting subsidy contract, which will ex
pire on the 31st of December, 187G.
The fast mail service i praised, and
ihe opinion is expressed, that at no
distant day the business of the depart
ment will bo so great as to induce rail
road companies to run similar trains
iioiu New England to Ihe Gulf, and
horn the Atlantic to tho Pacific.
It is recommended that ani person
be permitted, without additional
eliarge, to write a form of presentation
in any book, pimphlct, or magazine. or
auv other matter of the third class;
.mil also that the sender of any pack
age be permitted, without additional
charge, to write his or her name and
address on the outside thereof, with
the word "from'" above or preceding
the same, so as to inform the person
addresed of the name of the sender,
and to write briefly on any package the
number and name of the articles en
closed. As to transient printed matter, the
Postmaster General says: "I recom
mend that the postage on transient
newspapers and periodicals, books,
printed matter of all sorts, lithograph
ing and maps.shectniusic.photographs
and manuscripts designed for publica
tion shall be reduced to one cent for
each two ounces or fraction thereof,
which was the rate before the enact
mniit .if the l-nr .idvnui'iiiif it during
the closing hours of tho last session of
Congress.
Concerning newspaper postage, ho
says: "The new law which went into
effect on the first day of January, 1875,
from present indications will realize
about one million dollars for the first
calendar year.
This is not a material variation from
the average results of the old law.
though dining the last year in which
this hitter wa. in operation the amount
was increased by the payment of post
age on newspapers circulating within
the conutv of publication a require
ment that "was discontinued at the end
of one year.
While there has been no increase in
the aggregate receipts, ihero has been
a largo net gain by saving tho commis
sions, on collections allowed by the old
law, as under tho present law ihcgre.it
bulk of postage is paid at th" large of
fices, where salaries aro not affected by
this item.
The new system has worked so ad
mirably, and " lias given such general
satisfaction that no change has been
deemed necessary.
It is recommended that the compen
sation of postmasters of ihe fourth
da's bo based upon the business ol
i heir respective offices as determined
by the cancellation of stamps, the
amount being duly sworn to for each
quarter and returned to the Sixth Au
ditor. There is a great want of equity in
the compensation of postmasters of the
first, second and Ihiid classes; it sala
ries of smaller offices aro not excessive
those of larger cities are certainly too
low.
I find postmasters, as a class, to be
efficient, capable ami attentive bevoud
my expectations, and their salaries
should be ptoportionatc to their du
ties. In estimating the expected revenues
for the year ending June 30ih; 1677,
wishing "to be on the snfesideeti:3ates
have been submitted which show an
expected deficiency of $3,181,602, but it
is believed the deficiency for that year
will be very much less than the esti
mates, basing tho estimates of the rev
enues at thcsmallest amount aud of the
expenditure! at the largest.
An increase is shown in tho percent
age of the deficiency of only nineteen
and toity-nine one-hiindredths against
twenty-four and sixty-five one liun
drcdtfis, which was the estimate of the
percentage of the deficiency of last
Cir over that of Its predecessor.
