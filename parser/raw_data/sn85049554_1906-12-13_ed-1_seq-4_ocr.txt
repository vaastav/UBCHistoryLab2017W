PRIMARY AS A PARTY MEASURE.
Thru the Vinton Eagle B. Murphy
has voiced the cry o^ his tribe that -the
primary election bill be made a caucus
measure this session.' The, trouble be
fore, according to this knowing brave,
was that being an individual's bill no
one waa bound to support it. Then, too,
both factions were "kow-towtog" to the
democrats too much, says Murphy, for
the success, of any movement.
Nobody will deny that "kow-towing"
to democrats ^111 endanger republican
success. Mr. Murphy's friends have
proved that. For further evidence re
fer to Major Lacey. Whether or mot
a primary bill should be made distinct
ly a party measure is a question. If
primary electiows are to be state-wide
and compulsory upon all parties the
democrats might think It unfair to be
disfranchised entirely, in the framing
of it, especially since their party organ
ization has indicated that all good dem
ocrats will favor a primary law.
Of vastly more importance than this
suggestion of Mr. Murphy's to make
the primary bill a party measure is
the determination, of what kind of a
primary Mr. Murphy and his friends
will support The republican party
platform declared for a primary elec
tion law "which will provide for the
nomination by direct vote of all can
didates for office" and' "an expression
of party preference in the selection of
United States senators." Mr. Murphy
as member of a committee uporn reso
lutions in the convention passed upon
this plank, accepted it and stood upon
a chair loudly exhorting his tribe to
abide by it. Will he now favor nom
inations of "all candidates" by "direct
vote" or will he advise his friends that
the primaries, shall elect delegates and
the delegates do the -nominating? If
Mr. Murphy and his friends would line
up with the progressives for a state
wide primary by "direct vote" with
majority nominations and delegate in
directions omitted, if the party plat
form be permitted to bind all repub
licans there will be little necessity of
a party caucus. The bill could be dis
cussed in the regular way in commit
tee and in open debate upon, the floor.
Where do Mr. Murphy's friends Stan a
on the real Issue?
A LITTLE INCIDENT IN TRADE.
A MarshalKown merchant relates a
little incident of his extended trade
which points a moral both for the seller
and the purchased of goods. A few
days ago, since "the roads got b&d,"
a farmer living, ten or twelve miles
from the city wrote the merchant ask
ing him to make prices o#i a bill of
footwear for winter, which waa en
closed with the communication. The
bill more the^tagmarks to show that
it had been* compiled from a mail or
der catalog. Figuring catalog house
goods and qualities the merchant sent
back an estimate of $9.75 for the bill.
Two days after the farmer came into
the store. "I believe I'll buy.my stuff
here," he said, "your bill ds 75 cents
under the prices Of any of the cata
logs." He bought his goods, but not
the articles listed. He was shown both
kinds, the goods that could be sold at
a proflltable percentage for $9.75 and
other grades that cost more money, but
afforded no better profit to the -seller.
With his eye on the articles he refused
•the cheap onee and bought the best.
His bill was considerably more than
the first figures for he selected (he best
in the store. When the cheap goods
and the real thing were side by aide
before him he had no difficulty in see
ing the difference. He was more anx
ious about the value than about the
price.
What he wanted to know was
•that the home merchant could and
would compete with the catalog house.
The merchant had his chance to show
that he could do It and to offer an
object lesson. In values. There Isn't
much difference between the home
merchant and the consumer when they
ii:
get together and take counsel over the
difference between buying a picture in
a catalog and the actual goods over
•the counter.
If every buyer would see his home
merchants' stock and prices before he
sends his money away the catalog
houses would not boast of a $15,000,
000 business from Iowa. If every mer
chant would give the mail order cata
log a place on his counters and the
mail orders, qualities a spot in his
stock bringing the catalog prices and
catalog qualities" together with his own
goods and prices for comparison, buy
ers would soon loam the difference be
tween. pictures and the real thing, be
tween circus poster descriptions and
plain eyesigtt. The merchant and the
farmer are not far apart. A step to
ward each other would bring them to
gether.
A BANKER ON CREDIT CURRENCY.
A. B. Hepburn, president of the
Chase National Bank, New York, is out
in a printed article in support of the
plan for a credit currency recently rec
ommended by the commission of the
American Bankers' Association, as the
most desirable one in order to relieve
the money stringency that keeps recur
ring in this country. The change of
the existing bank-note system ia the
principal part of this recommendation.
The operation of the plan, in Mr. Hep
burn's words, is a» follows:
"During crop-moving periods, the
banks outside of reserve cities would
first utilize their power to Issue notes
in order to satisfy the demand made
upon them, instead of calling, as now,
upon reserve cities for currency.. Their
power in that respect utilized, the re
serve cities might, in turn, elrcsuus
serye cities might, in turn, Issue cur
rency and, if the demand Increased, a
point might be reached where central
reserve cities would issue currency and
keep the tame in circulation until the
crop-moving period had passed, or oth
er demand, whatever Its occasion, had
•been satisfied. The benefit which would
accrue to New York, Chicago, St. Lou
is and other money centers would be
indirect, in removing or relieving the
demand upon their reserve money,
which every fall brings around. This
fact cannot be too strongly empha
sized, that ample redemption facilities,
with thg general redemption which
would follow, is a complete answer to
the charge that the proposed currency
would amount to inflation, and that In
terior banks would keep the maximum
out at all times. They could not keep
it out unless the business demand for
currency was pronounced and extreme,
and then it should be kept out in the
interest of the general welfare. When
ever the money rates relax and the
currency demand lessens, it would flow
in for redemption. This is proven by
experience Where credit currency has
been and is being used.

The
Grinding Hay.
[Wallace's Farmer.]
A northwestern Iowa subscriber
writes:
"I would like to know whether It
would be practical to grind alfalfa and
clover in a small way. 'Several years
ago I cut alfalfa with an ordinary
cornstalk cutter and fed it to 'brood
sows, after soaking it twelve hours,
heating It, and then mixing with a
little middlings. I never had hogrf
do so well. I cannot get it fine enough,
however, with a common cutter, and
would therefore like to know whether
I can igrind it successfully."
There is no trouble about grinding
alfalfa or clover, but the cost is too
gTeat to justify doing it in a small
way. In fact, several small factories
feslabl-lshect in the aifalifa country for
the purpose of grinding the hay Into
meal have 'failed. They could not
handle a sufficient volume to make It
profitable. The best way to prepare
hay or clover for feed to toe fed hogs
on the farm is to simply cut it into
as short lengths a« possible. This
cannot be fed as economically as
when the feed is ground, but the
process of grinding is too costly to
undertake to adopt on the average
farm or even on, a very iange farm.
Those who desire to feed ground
alfalfa can purchase it already ground
cheaper than -they can grind it them
selves. ...
Detasieling Corn.
For a number of years the depart
ment of agriculture has been con
ducting a series of experiments at
different stations in breeding and in
preventing the inbreeding- of corn.
The experiments have not been alto
gether successful, but are in -the
progress of reaching to a higher state
in the cultivation' of corn, both in the
quantity and quality of the grain.
As one method of preventing in
breeding or to entirely eliminate it,
detasseling has been resorted to, but
•the result is still an open question.
The detasseling process has been
more extensively tried at the Illinois
station than at any other, and the
conclusion has been reached that if
it is beneficial at all it is mostly likely
to be ore poor soil or in dry seasons.
It was also demonstrated that some
times detasseling results In a de
creased yield, at first. The detasseled
corn, owing to the absence of pollen,
had no Influenoe on the breeding of
tasseled com, but was crossbred it
self each year of the experiments.
It Is proposed to continue the ex
periments for several years yet -in the
hope that a successful system of
crossbreeding will be developed that
will increase the yield, and at the
same time improve the quality.
Shrinkage of Hay.
PC. Hay
D. Smith Before Michigan
Dealers' Association.]
With hay the percentage of Shrink
age, will, of course, vary with the per
centage of water In the hay when cured
jand put in the "barn. The Michigan
£xperlment station has performed mora
experiments along the line of shrinkage
&f h«y than any other station, and I
am
tolad
to Ibrlng ypur attention today
to some of our results. 1
On June 27, 1896, five tons of very dry
timothy hay were drawn from the
field, and, after weighing, were placed
In a separate mow. Just after harvest
it was covered with grain In the sheaf,
which was thrashed out In September.
On January 26 it was reiweighed and
found to have Host 684 pounds, or a
little less than 7 per cent. Remember
thsyt this hay was very dry at the
start.
'Two years later, 66,000 pounds of
timothy hay in fairly good condition
was hauled to the Ibarn and weighed
out again the* February following. It
had lost 776 pounds, or 13.8 per cent.
The early cut hay loses, other things
being equal,' more than late cut hay.
The Pennsylvania station has shown
that where the dry cut hay lost 29 per
cent in weight, the late cut hay lost
but 21.5 per cent.
Without wearying you with further
figures on this particular line, I have
related enough to show that no hard
and fast set of figures can be adopted,
as showing the per cent that timothy
haV may be expected to shrink. If it
is very dry it will shrjnk less.
The Utah station reports a case
where some very dry hay was stacked
in July and rewelghed in April, when
it actually had gained something over
1 per cent. On the other hand, where
the timothy hay, aitho not damp
enough to spoil, is stored1 full of juice,
the shrinkage is apt to be as high as
15 per cent, or even 20 per cent.
Normal hay or damper will shrink
more in the stack than in the barn,
while dry hay will shrink more in the
barn than in the stack. This matter
of shrinkage should ibe remembered by
the farmer when he is trying to de-

termine whether to hold the hay over
to sell in the fall.
Olover shrinks something over half
In going from the green state as stand
ing to the condition of fairly well cured
hay. In certain cases, at the Mich
igan station, the loss of weight from
the fresh mower swath to the load
going into the barn was 60 per cent.
Haw much clover hay shrinks from
the time of storing as cured hay until
the ^following spring depends, of
course, on its condition when put in.
At the Michigan station the shrinkage
has run all the way from 11 per cent
to 36 per cent. Where the clover hay
is fairly dry when stored the shrink
age may'be expected to toe albout 20
per cent.
No exiperiments have yet been tried
with alfalfa hay, altho enough work
has been done to show that the iflrst
crop will shrink more than either of the
other two where three crops are cut in
a season. It is Interesting to note also
that the composition of the alfalfa hay
varies (between successive crops.
Farmers Rise Against Sign Painters.
In Elkhart county, Ind., the farmers
have organized against a long-time
nuisance, writes J. A. Groff to the Prai
rie Farmer. It 'is the custom of town
merchants daubing their fences and
nailing sign boards on their trees, that
the Indiana soil tillers propose to get
after as with a sharp stick, and they
intend to keep at the work until it is.
stopped.
A town tradesman who is too stingy
of pocket and too narrow of mind to
buy a little space in the town or county
newspaper, goes about the county with
a wagon load of dry goods box tops and
sides cleated intd sign boards. He also
has a bucket of cheap black paint.
He Is too parsimonious even to buy
the lumber of his fellow townsman in
the lumber business, nor has he pat
ronized his druggist or paint man for
the decoction that he uses to deface the
fences along the highways.
Neither has this kind of an adver
tiser any compunction about climbing
the fence of a meadow and In climbing
a tree on private property to take up
a sign.
Over in Ohio there'ls a certain camp
meeting association that advertises the
way to Heaven by smearing on fence
boards a variety of Biblel quotations.
This Is mentioned to show that a good
many classes of people make unwar
ranted use of the fence and trees of
a farmer. It is this kind of thing that
the progressive soil tillers of this age
are trying to stop, and hope to make
It a costly piece of work to invade their
property and their rights to perform an
act of vandalism.
Some farmers are found who readily
give their consent to make such use
of their trees and fences. There are
some who will allow a patent nostrum
liend to decorate the gable end or even
the sid^ of his bam for some small
consideration.
Others allow the larger city adver
tisers to p\it up large sign boards In
their meadows, In most instances sad
ly marring the beauty that nature gave
the outlook. But today such privileges
are becoming more difficult to obtain,
and farmers are stopping other invas
ions of their propeirty.
The Indiana men who are leading in
this matter have determined to tear
down all signs that are nailed to their
trees and to prosecute the daubers who
string out advertisements on their
fences.
It is claimed that some of the finest
trees of the farms have been destroyed
by the repeated nailing of boards. The
farmers say they are in need of no law
to protect themselves from this in
fringement of their rights, common
laws now on the books will give them
the needed redress.
Swine Breeding.
I do not expect to end the contro
versy, but am sure some of the state
ments I will make will bear me oijt in
saying the male has no influence over
the size of the Utter. Careful breeders
do not lay the blame of a small litter
to the male, but rather to their lack of
care in selection of the female, or to
careless feeding. Sows mated to the
same male, that have been wisely se
lected, fed alike and in every wa'y pos
sible given the same care, farrow oc
casionally extreme litters, from 2 to 14,

gry breed them as near same time as
possible, to same male, and note re
sults. If the fat one conceives at all
she will not likely have over three
pigs, while the other may farrow 12
or 14. Why does a young sow have a
small number, and the next litter a
large one, as a rule, while again some
sows never have a large litter? Does
it stand to reason the male Influences
the size of the litter? Therefore, when
you buy a male and the sows bred to
him have but few pigs, is it just to
condemn the breeder of the male? If
your sows have been carefully selected
and handled right you will rarely have
cause of complaint.
The Poland China sow is receiving a
great deal of attention from breeders
of other swine, to the tune that she is
not prolific. The trouble is right here:
she is so easily fatted that the average
farmer breeds her when too fleshy if
kept in some flesh, as other breeds, she
will farrow and raise just as many, too
more nor less, as a rule. George Rom
mel, of Washington, D. C., examined
carefully the records of pure bred
swine, and found the Dune Jersey sow
adv. only of a pig more to her lit
ter than the Poland China sow. The
Poland China hog will keep In pork
bartel shape on the same feed that
some other breeds keep In race track
form. Nevertheless, I contend that if
from now on for two generations the
lard breeds start from the same qaulity
of stock, fed alike and handled the
same, will produce similar results in
other words, environment is the requi
site for success. I repeat that the
number of pigs in a litter depends en
tirely on the dam, and the quality more
on the male than the dam.

THEFT IN THE STORES.
[Fort Dodge Messenger.]
Every clferk is made a detective dur
ing the Christmas season. He must
be On the alert for any, piece of trick
ery exercised by the smooth customer.
His entire attention must be centered
on the shoppers who throng the store
and examine the different articles for
sale. Should he by chance discover
some innocent looking individual in the
act of concealing one of the articles, the
theft must be exposed to either floor
walker or proprietor.
In drug store, dry goods store, cloth
ing and jewelry store, the same pre
caution must be maintained, for there
is so much of the Christmas stuff
which can be carried away under the
coat or in the muff.
A story Is told by a young clerk In
a jewelry store who encountered one of
the smoothest shop lifters of the sea
son. She was looking at bracelets—
and another girl. Of course she looked
as if she were going to purchase one.
That Is the usual spirit. He brought
out the entire line of goods. With
splendid uncpncern! she clasped three
on her arm and admired them in true
girl style. When she started to leave,
promising to come again, she 'slipped
off two of the bracelets, but failed to
remember the 'third, which she had
covered with her sleeve. The boy,
who had been watching very sharply,
waited until she picked up her purse
to depart, when he said, "Don't you
think you'd better take off the other
one?" She hemmed and' hawed and
grew quite flustered, but with a great
many apologies found the missing ar
ticle and returned it to him.
