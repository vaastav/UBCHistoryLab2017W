IS THE COMBINE A SCHEME?
THE rumor persistently recurs in financial circles
in New York that the railroad combine is in
tended by its manipulators to lead to Govern
ment ownership of all the railways in the country.
It is pointed out that the leaders in the movement
are not without political influence and have the power
to control a considerable section of the press. The
process is declared to be simple. Let the Govern;
ment acquire the stocks of the lines at an appraised
valuation by direct purchase, and then guarantee the
interest on the bonded debt and it is done; the roads
pass to public ownership and administration.
A glance at the operations of the roads will il-,
luminate the rumored plan. In 1898 the gross earn
ings per mile of road in this country were $6771, and
the net earnings o\-er operating expenses were $2111
per mile. Nearly 18 per cent of the gross earnings
went for bond interest, and 2 l A per cent for taxes.
In that year the net resources of the roads from all
sources were $389,666,574. The present capitalization
of all American roads is about thirteen billions of
dollars; the total national wealth is put at 102 billions
of dollars. If the Government take over the entire
tystem by an issue of thirteen billions of dollars in
bonds at 3 per cent, the annual interest charge will
be $390,000,000. It will be seen that when the waste
of public ownership and administration is applied to
the operation of the roads, there is a prospect of an
annual deficit in ad<* : *ion to this annual interest
charge, which must out of the taxpayers.
That the owne of the roads would make a good
bargain on these conditions needs no further expo
sition. Their investment would be perfectly secure
under the guarantee of the Government, and the peo
ple would have the satisfaction of Government owner
ship, and paying for it As that experiment in Eu
rope has shown an invariable increase of 20 per cent
in cost of operation over the cost of private owner
ship, and at rates of transportation from three to five
times higher than here, it will be seen that such in
crease will add yearly $186,400,000 to the cost of
operation.
But the present owners, with their bonds in their
pockets, will b.e free from care. There will be no
more bankrupt roads, with bonded debts to be scaled
and bondholders to be ruined.
Between 1876 and 1899, 842 different railways were
foreclosed in court. Their total mileage was 106,510
miles, and their stocks and bonds amounted to six
and a half billions. Foreclosure wiped out 36 per
cent of the bonds and 37 per cent of the stocks.
There will be other hard times and more foreclos
ures, if the Government do not take over their prop
erties, and none are more interested in running to
cover than the enormous investors who will be ex
posed to the destruction of a slump.
Therefore, it is not improbable that the rumor has
justification, and that the fanatics who see in Gov
ernment ownership a panacea are their tools and
certain newspapers their paid allies.
Now that the American people have taken to rais
ing money for the relief of the women and children
in the British concentration camps in South Africa
it will net be long before they will begin to urge the
Government to interfere on behalf of the Boers.
When the American begins to put his money up fdr
a cause he is getting ready to talk business.
According to the census reports of the salt in
dustry there was produced in 1899 in this country
75,939.095 bushels of salt, and as that is considerably
in excess of one bushel per capita for the population
it will be seen that as a people we can hardly be ac
cused of keeping ourselves too fresh.
As might have been expected the longest biography
in the new Congressional directory is that of Chaun
cey Depew. It contains a list of his most famous
orations, but as it says nothing of his approaching
marriage there will probably be a sequel. •
If Miss Stone, the famous missionary, had a hun
dred lives she would have lost them all in the fer
tile brains of irresponsible correspondents, who let
hardly a day pass without a new report of the ven
turesome woman.
OUBAN DEMANDS.
MANY delegations are visiting" Washington
from Cuba to insist upon free trade with the
island in sugar and tobacco. This demand is
varied by propositions to abate the tariff so far be
low the Dingley rates, as to deprive domestic"pro
ducers of protection. > J'
The American sugar and tobacco growers, being
agriculturists and to a degree unorganized, are per
haps not fully aware that free sugar from Cuba means
the gift^f about $260 per acre to the island planters,
and that their demand has many American advo
cates in Congress and out. These advocates proceed
on the philanthropic line. They insist that when
we declared war against Spain "we guaranteed the
prosperity of Cuba." From that text a sermon is
preached that appeals to charity and honor. If we
accept the text the premise is admitted and the con
clusion must be accepted.
But did we make any such guarantee?'- An exam
ination of the resolution declaring war fails to find
anything that can be tortured into any obligation to
make the Cubans prosperous. To have undertaken
such a responsibility would have been what Senator
Sumner called "a piece of preposterosity." We de
clared Cuba to be of right ' a free and independent
state, and declared that we would not acquire sov
ereignty of the island and would abdicate occupancy
upon the institution of a stable government. That is
alL No state is free and independent when another
has guaranteed its prosperity.
The United States is concerned only with the pros
perity of its own people, and that only so far as it
can be secured by financial stability and their pro
tection against the lavish production or cheap labor
of other countries. Otherwise they are expected to
carve out their own fortunes and dictate their own
destiny. It goes without saying" that acceptance of
the Cuban pretensions will seriously violate the obli
gation of this Government to its own people. As
our population increases and its wants grow more
complex, the profit of supplying them should be kept
at home, to the end that the ever-increasing demand
for the profitable employment of land and labor may
be met. The production of rice, sugar and tobacco
is a much needed means of diversifying our agri
culture. Each requires the employment of labor in
converting the raw material to human use. l\ that
production is left undisturbed and its profit untouched
it will grow beyond the domestic consumption and
our agricultural and manufacturing labor will be in
creased to produce and convert the raw .material for
foreign markets, as has been the case in the metal,
fabric, wood and leather manufactures.
Why, then, is it not the part of wisdom for our
Government to retain unabated its power to carry
out the constitutional injunction that it shall "provide
for the general welfare"?
Our taxpayers have contributed hundreds of mil
lions to the Spanish war and its collateral results. If
any of the statesmen think that they did this for the
purpose of inviting lush production and cheap labor
into competition with them, to reduce their profits,
obsolete their industries and invade their prosperity,
they are making a mistake, the serious ' nature : of
which will appear when the results become known to
the people.
Mr. Lawson, the Boston millionaire, is said to have
lost more than $11,000,000 in -the copper deal, but
inasmuch as he owns all the stock he held at first
and has the same copper mines the loss isj nothing
more than a Wall-street calculation on the value
of the stock, and it may be that the street has calcu
lated wrong. At any rate Mr. Lawson has not yet
lost anything except a speculative idea.
UP TO JUSTICE BROWN.
SINCE the decision of the Supreme Court in the
so-called "diamond rings case" has followed the
precedent set by the court in the decision of
the Porto Rico cases last spring, it has occasioned
comparatively little comment. In fact it was in the
nature of a foregone conclusion. Such interest as
exists in the matter therefore turns rather upon what
was not decided than upon what was. It was decided
that duties cannot be collected upon goods imported
into this country from the Philippines as the law now
stands, but it was not decided whether or no duties
upon goods sent to the Philippines from the United
States may be collected at Philippine ports. That
and other questions arising from our relations to the
Philippines will have to come up sooner or later.
What decision will be pronounced upon them is
known only to Mr. Justice Brown. On all of these
cases he is virtually the Supreme Court. It is up
to him to decide.
The position of Justice Brown is unique. The re
maining Justices of the court are divided on the
question of the relation of our island possessions to
the rest of the country. Justice Brown holds the
balance of power, and he holds it impartially, for he
favors one side about as often as the other. He may
not be strictly consistent in his views, but he is un
questionably fair and gives everybody a chance.
In the Dc Lima case decided last spring Chief
Justice Fuller and Justices llarlan, Pcckham and
Brewer held that immediately upon the ratification
of the treaty of peace Porto Rico ceased to be for
eign territory and became domestic. Brown agreed
with them, and consequently Shiras, White, Gray and
McKcn'n.i were left in a minority. In the Downes
case it was held by Shiras, White, Gray and Peck
ham that Congress has power to impose customs
duties upon trade between this country and Porto
Rico, and Brown agreed with them, consequently that
time it was the Chief Justice and Harlan, McKenna
and Brewer, who made up the minority. In the Phil
ippine case the relative positions of the Justices re
turn to what they were in the De Lima case, and
once more it is Justice Brown who' makes the de
cision and determines the law of the land.
The situation is not" conducive to confidence in
the court. It is evident we are. facing problems in
which the highest tribunal in the country is so equal
ly divided there is no means of forecasting what de
cisions will be given upon such new issues as will
inevitably arise. Four Justices believe the islands
have become a part of the United States and must be
governed- by Congress in accord with the constitu
tion; that their people. must enjoy full' freedom of
trade with other portions of the country. Four other
Justices hold: that the islands are not a part of the
United States, or at least that they are not domestic
territory within the meaning of the tariff act. Justice
Brown holds an intermediate position and decides
that the islands became domestic as soon as the treaty
of peace was ratified, but that Congress can establish
a separate tariff for them 'if it pleases. .
It has been said by lawyers that the "decisions 'vir
tually give us three kinds of territory and three kinds
of citizens. First, the States whose citizens are
clothed with full powers of sovereignty* and -.self
government; second, incorporated Territories whose
. , - ■ ■. '.....■
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 10, 1901.
citizens are entitled to freedom of trade - with -the'
States but are not entitled to vote, for: Presidential
electors or to have representation in the United States
Senate;; and third, unincorporated territories held, as
"appurtenances" to the Union, and whose: citizens
have no rights except such as Congress may choose
to grant.
Out of that complexity there are certain to arise
many perplexing questions. At present no one can
foresee what they will' be. All that we kno"w is that
so long as the membership of the Supreme Court re
mains as it is there will be division, and the settle
ment of each issue will be up to Justice Brown, who*
in such matters exercises a one-man power of the
first magnitude.
The South American delegates to the Pan-Ameri
can" Congress seem to be of the opinion that.inter
national arbitration will be a a good ' thing provided
there is no attempt made to arbitrate anything that
gives promise of war and a chance to upset a Govern
ment.
LONDON dispatches of yesterday announce that
immediately upftithe assembling of Parliament
- the Ministry will bring forward a plan for abol
ishing the concentration camps in South Africa and
substituting a better method of caring for the Boer
prisoners and refugees.. No information from an of
ficial source has been given concerning the nature of
the new plan, but it is believed it' will consist of dis
tributing the refugees throughout the more settled
and pea'ceable districts of the Transvaal instead of
herding them together as is the practice now.
The movement on the part of the Ministry is. a
victory of the moral sentiment of mankind against
so-called military necessity. From every part of the
civilized world there has arisen a protest against the
cruel policy which Weyler introduced in Cuba and
Kitchener has followed in South Africa. It is but
just to the British to recognize : that they have
themselves furnished many of the foremost and most
earnest of those who denounce the system. The
most effective blow was delivered by Miss Hobhouse,
a British nurse who went to the seat of war not to
sympathize with the Boers but to serve wherever
needed in her professional capacity, and whose report
of what she saw in the concentration camps aroused
the indignation of humane people in Great Britain
as well as in other countries.
American sympathy has promptly followed the.dis
closures of the condition of the camps., . At the pres
ent time in the East no public gatherings are more
largely attended than those held for the purpose of
raising money for the Boer prisoners, nor is there any
cause for which money is more liberally, contributed.
This manifestation of sentiment in America may well
serve the Ministry as a warning, for on the whole
the people of this country have not been at all pre
judiced or antagonistic to the British in the war. If
there be a change of sentiment now it will be because
the change is justified.
A recent circular issued by the Chicago Branch of
the American Transvaal League presents statistics of
the death rate in the camps from June to September,,
inclusive, showing that in June the rate was equiva
lent to an annual death rate of 190 per thousand. It
continued to increase month after month until in
September it amounted to an annual rate of 264 per
thousand. The death rate among the children in Sep
tember is given at the equivalent of an annual rate
of 433 per thousand.
Statistics coming from the Boer side may be more
or less exaggerated, but information from British
sources goc,s far to confirm them. The significance
of a yearly death rate of 264 per thousand may be
estimated from the fact that the normal yearly, death
rate in England and Wales is but eighteen per thou
sand. The Boers are known to be a robust and
hardy race, and it can readily be seen that so large
a death rate among them implies a fearful condition in
the concentration camps. Clearly then it- is high
time for the Ministry to put an end* to them.
A report from Princeton says that a protest against
the proposed extension of a trolley line has been
signed by "Grover Cleveland and other prominent
business^ men," so it seems that to pass from the
Presidency- to the rank of a "prominent citizen" is
easy; but when did Cleveland go into business?
THE Democracy proves still unable to rule its
own spirit. Mr. Bryan has degenerated into the
party scold. He lets go one day at Gorman
and the next at Wattersbn. He deifies himself by re
ferring to Senator John P. Jones as Judas Iscariot,
who has betrayed him, and scarcely suspends his duty
on the watch tower. long enough to care for .his
anaemic, cczematous, ring-wormed political offspring,
free silver. Hill has left Croker to smoke the pipe of
peace alone, and the Jackson Club of Omaha has
taken up Croker's fight and refuses to invite Hill to
dine with it on January 8, >.\
In Missouri the State officers and committcemen of
the party are in court telling tales on each other and
digging up cashbooks showing large donations from
all the corporations, and the corporations remark that
as the Democratic platform threatened their undoing
by unfriendly legislation they were justified in seeking
safety by "cash. They say that the wise corporation
only buys 'peace of those that threaten war.
The minority in the House of Representatives held
its caucus and immediately proceeded to quarrel over
every issue in sight. The New York contingent
submitted a wordy programme, which omitted free
silver, and a Bryanite moved to substitute the Kansas
City platform, and then the men who desire to run
the Government showed that they could not run their
own caucus nor agree upon anything, and the anxious
and perspiring leader, Mr. Richardson, secured. ran
adjournment without coming to any decision. This
leaves the minority to indulge in a go-as-you-piease,
and its political course will be merely a guerrilla
warfare.
The people will not trust a party that is composed
of disagreements. It is united in only one thing and
that is. opposition to whatever Republicans propose.
But that is the policy of destruction.' . The people
want a constructive policy. It is a rule of law and
logic that he who comes to negative and destroy, a
proposition must come with one to take its place!
The country is as yet unaware of any feasible
Democratic policy not already rejected by the people
upon which it can be invited back to power. Its con
dition .now . is .worse than', ever in its/history. It ; has
received the weakening accessions of Patterson,
Heitfelt and Duboise, the. Populists, who .have;car
ried into its councils nothing but further discord; and
is .worse off than before those Senators •crossed ■ over.
Evidently the country must continue to look to -the
Republican party for affirmative and constructive' ieg
islatioh,. and : the ■ responsibility . of "that -party is" in
creased by the irresponsibility \ of its opponent.-;

ASKING TOO MUCH— A Reader, City.
The question "What country can claim the
best-looking and best-shaped woman?"
Is one that no one can answer, for the
reason that beauty of face and sym

opinion and as diversified as there aro
individuals. What Is beautiful to one is
not to another. The matter of female
beauty is best explained by the expression
of a Frenchman to the effect that every
woman is beautiful in the eyes of the
man who loves her.

POOR SINNER'S BELL— B. F. W.,
City. The poor sinner's bell Is a bell "in
the city of Breslau, In the province of
Silesia, Prussia, and hangs In the tower
of one of the city churches. According
to historic records, it was cast July 17,
13S6. It is said that a great bell founder
of the place had undertaken to make the
finest church bell he' had ever made.
When the metal was melted the founder
withdrew for a few moments, leaving a
boy to, watch the furnace and enjoining
him not to meddle with the catch that
held the molten metal, but the boy dis
obeyed the caution," and when he saw
the metal flowing into the mold he called
the founder. The latter; rushed in, and
seeing as he thought • hi3 • work of weeks
undone and his masterpiece ruined, struck
the boy a blow that caused his immediate
death. When the metal cooled and the
