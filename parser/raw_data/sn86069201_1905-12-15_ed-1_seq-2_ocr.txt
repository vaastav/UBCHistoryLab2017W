BLOOMLESS
The Lesson of the RosebushLet It
Be a Warning to Bloomless and
Fruitless Lives
It has served me right said tho
rose bush as it lay in a heap of rub
bish where it had been thrown be
cause of its long failure to put forth
any roses It seems like a hard fate
to one who has been as delicately nour
ished as I to be cast aside where I
must die without hope of even another
opportunity And yet I cannot com
plain For years my master has cared
for me He gave me the best of atten
tion He studied my nature my char
acter my needs and what he td
would be good for me he gave and yet
In all these years I gave him not one
blossom for his thoughtfulness and
care Several times I gave him to
understand that I would reward him
when I put forth the tiniest pink bud
fanti I remember how he looked at it
and said mere will be roses by the
garden path this year But I always
disappointed his expectation The burt
thenh I
have been a disappointment to the
great world that nourished mo I have
sent my roots into the earth and have
drawn freely from it I have spread
forth my leaves and have reveled in
I
tho luxury of sunbeams I have held
up my arms to the clouds and have not
wanted of the rains from heaven And
yet I have given no expression of my
gratitude for It all I have given to the
Ir which has fanned me no fra
prance to the clouds which gave mo
abundance to drink of the wine of
heaven no incenso to the luxuriant
earth which has fed me no return ex
cept the dead leaves of the autumn
which the gardener burned and to the
gardener himself I have not given the
poor satisfaction which he craved of a
esingle smile I have been both un
profitable and ungrateful It has
served me right It is a hard fate to
die without hope of another oppoitun
ity but I cannot complain It is the
fate of those who promise and never
fulfill of those upon whom great
blessings have been conferred and
have mlslmproved them who have
been endowed with fine talents yet
have been a disappointment to God
and man And as I heard the pitiful
confession I said1 If your life has
been wasted your deathbed confession
may prove a blessing for in the hope
that it maybe a warning to men who
are wasting their lives I shall publish
J
It to the world And when again I
passed by the rose bush was withered
and dead but there seemed to be about t
it the peace of one who has accom
plished more good by his death than
by his life United Presbyterian
