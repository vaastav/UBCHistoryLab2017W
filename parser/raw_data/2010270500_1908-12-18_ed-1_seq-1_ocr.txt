Members of congress who are In
clined to resent President Roosevelt's
criticism of the restriction It placed
on the government secret service at
the last session point out the fact that
the same bill. In which appears the
amendment that riled the president,
appropriates half a million dollars for
enforcement of the law against tim
ber and land frauds. The president's
message to congress charges that the
amendment restricting the secret serv
ice division to the treaury department
was of benefit to no one but the gov
ernment land and timber thieves or
other criminals. The sundry civil ap
propriation bill shows, however, that
congress voted $500,000 for the espe
cial purpose of protecting the govern
ment against such criminals and pros
ecuting them. V
This sum, now being used for the
detection and conviction of land and
timber grafters. Is, In fact, four times
the amount asked and voted to the
secret service division of the treasury
department about which the president
has become so agitated. Furthermore,
the appropriation to thus protect the
public lands and foreBts was doubled
at the last session of congress, being
Increased from $250,000 to $500,000,
every cent that was asked of congress
for that purpose. The increase alone
of the fund to prevent land frauds
was double the entire amount 'asked
and appropriated for the entire secret
service.
Representative Wafter I. Smith, of
Iowa, was a member of the subcom
mittee of the appropriations commit
tee that had In charge the - prepura-'
tlon of the sundry civil bill at the last
session and aided in Incorporating In
It this provision for fhe punishment
of land and timber grafters. In view
of the half million appropriated for
that special purpose he also upheld tho
amendment that the secret service di
vision of the treasury department
should be restricted from "loaning" or
"assigning" detectives to other depart
ments of the government, which
were provided with funds of their own
for whatever secret Inquiries they have
lawful right to make in the conduct of
citizens or officials.

"At the last session of the legisla
ture I recommended that provision
should be made for suitable Inquiry
Into the facts relating to speculation
In securities end commodities, with
the view of ascertaining the manner In
which Illegitimate transactions might
be prevented and -legitimate business
safeguarded. As I stated In accepting
a renomlnatlon, I had in mind In mak
ing this recommendation such an ex
pert inquiry as was made into banking
conditions, the result of which was
tho passage of highly beneficial meas
ures. "In this commonwealth the vast
commercial and financial transactions,
which represent the activities of the
entire country, It is of the utmost Im
portance that legislation affecting bus
iness and exchange should be the re
sult of deliberate, study, and that we
should neither threaten business sta
bility by ill considered measures or on
the other hand Invite agitation or Im
pair confidence by Ignoring abuses and
by falling to provide suitable correc

Franking Imvt Violated In ft Number

Secretary Wilson's department may
be put on the gridiron by the house
appropriations committee to find out
who Is responsible for mailing 20,000
copies of a political speech by Gen.
Sickles under a government frank
during the recent campaign. It Is ad
mitted at the department of agricul
ture that some of the campaign docu
ments "happened" to get Into Its en
velopes marked "Official Business.
Penalty for Private Use, $300," but
who put them there and how It came
about Is professed to be a profound
mystery that the house committee on
appropriations is anxious to solve.
The appropriations committee has
had Third Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Lawshe on the rack also to ex
plain how the country life commission,
of which Henry W. Wallace, of Deis
Moines, is a member, came to use the
government frank on the thousands ol
letters It has sent out to the farmers
of the United States. It Is contended
that the commission, which Is an un
official body appointed by the presi
dent, had no right to the free use ol
the mails.
In reply to an inquiry from the com
mittee Mr. Lawshe said:
"The question may have been raised
whether this commission oh countr
life could make use of the franking
privilege, or, rather, use the penaltj
envelope. If so, It was held that th
commission could not use it, but that
correspondence In regard to that com
mission could not use It, but that cor
respondence In regard to that commis
sion which related 'exclusively to th
business of the government of th
United States,' conducted by an of

that I shall Kike no part In contests
for offices In the legislature or the of

platform pledges are a contract made
with the voter and also because 1 be
lieve that the keeping of such prom

ty Is to maintain its position in the
