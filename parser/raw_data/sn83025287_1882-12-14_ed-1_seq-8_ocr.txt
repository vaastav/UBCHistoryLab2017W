The number of civil service reformers
in Congress is absolutely marvelous.
Every member of congress is a civil ser
vice reformer, and every one has a "plan,"
but wh."-t is most remarkable, also, is that
none of these schemes are, as a whole, of
, real, positive value. It is ominous to see
the tactics of congressmen whose heads
have been made dizzy by the late election.
It has been ascertained that bossism, after
all, is not so powerful a factor in politic.
as the people.
There is a pretty determined effort to
secure the removal of S. P. Rounds, the
superintendent of the government printing
office at Washington, because he held
Helm as an assistant. Helm will be re
membered.-is recently removed because he
wis connected with the Critic, a paper
which sustains the star route thieves, and
bitterly assails the administration. Ever
since then Mr. Round's enemies have been
endeavoring to mix him up
in the matter and demand his
removal because he appointed Helm as an
assistant. The Glove is pleased to an
nounce that the effort has proved futile.
Mr. Rounds is a most thoroughly com
petent man, and the best public printer
that we have ever had. He is the best be
cause he is practical in his-duties and not a
politician. Heretofore the position has
been held by politicians, pure and simple,
and now it is held, as it should be, by
a practical printer. Mr. Rounds
is the first public printer
who has been able to keep copies of the
President's message from being made
public prior to its delivery to Congress.
For a number of years the only way the
President has been able to keep his mes
sage secret has been to read it from man
uscript. Mr. Rounds put half the last mes
sage in type himsplf, and had the re
mainder set in his presence by two or three
trusty men. The type was then locked up
in a safe and no proof sheet escaped. This
feat is quite a laurel for Mr. Rounds,for it
is generally understood that an advance
copy of the President's message commands
a large cash figure and the average weak
ness of human nature makes it difficult for
it to pass through the government print
ing office without encountering some one
who cannot resist the temptation to secure
a surreptions copy.
CLOSE OP THE RA.ILROAD WAR.
The New York telegrams to this morn
ing's Globe record the termination of the
railroad war in the Northwest. Just what
the details may be, we are not advised, but
if the railroads are willing to be fair and
moderate in their "mutual" arrangement,
the public will be tho gainer by
the closing of the war. The temporary
advantage which some "mdividuals may
gain by such a contest of corporate capital
_? is more titan offset by the general financia
demoralization which must necessarily en
sue if the struggle is long prolonged. That
demoralization will be- far reaching and
affect every one, while only the few, at tie
best, derive any benefit from the ruinous
cut and slash policy.
It is reasonable to presume that one
good result will follow the short-lived rail
road war, and that is the permanent re
duction of freight and passenger rates on
the trunk lines. There is no doubt that
the capital invested will be handsomely
remunerative at very much lower rates than
those in vogue, and while the war
went to the other extreme,there is a happy
maan which it would be the part of wis
dom for the railroad managers to adopt.
For instance, while they cannot afford to
carry passengers from St. Paul to Chicago
for fifty cents or a dollar, they can afford
to make a considerable reduction from
fourteen dollars. The same applies to
freight rates. :
The cut rates of the past few weeks will
hive a tendency to invoke legislation rel
ative to railro id rates in general, and that
ii why th. Globe suggests to the railroad
managers that it will be the part of wis
dom to anticipate this by striking the hap
py mean. The people, in their legisla
tures or any other capacity, have no right
to oppress the railroads and make the
capital invested therein uuremunerative,
and the railroads, ou the other hand, have
no right to oppress the people and make
their labor and production unremunera
tive by excessive transportation tariffs.
Moderation ail wisdom on both sides is
demanded by bsth public and private in
terests.
A SECOXJX BRIDGE I>EHAXJJEP. \
The prosr/ect of any public improve
nent in S** Paul is sure to raise the ire of
he immaculate Pioneer Press. > It cannot
>ear to see tho prospect of a second j
iridg*. over the river at St. Paul, because
t wi)l have a tendency to advance the city.
diuneapolis has half a dozen bridges con
necting the two sides of the river and as .
(he . result, the old St. Anthony
>ide, which was; comparatively
lead, has sprung into life, and the strides -
t has made in two years past, eclipse'the
york of the previous twenty. The P. P.
shampioned the Minneapolis bridges, and
f more were projected it would champion
:hem also, [because it seeks, upon every '
possible occasion, to advance that city and
to correspondingly decry St. Paul.
The people having voted to issue bonds "
to build a second bridge, the city council
is very properly at work to locate and con
struct the thoroughfare. Because they are
doing this, because they are complying *"
with the public demand, they are bitterly
denounced by the Minneapolis P. P. and
held up as a band of robbers and as treach- _,
erous to the public interests.
It has long been apparent that tho inter
ests of the city demand another bridge. It
is not claimed that a- steady stream of
persons and vehicles will not pass the pop
ulation of the Sixth ward, as far as busi
ness demands to. and from this side of the
city, but it does not follow from this that ]
they should be confined to that single aye- '
nue. It does not follow that for all time :
all population on the West side above Wa- i
bashaw street should come down '
to that point to cross the river, and that
all the population below Wabashaw street
should come up the river to the same
point. The West side is a portion of the
city which can be readily developed, if
satisfactory communication is made with
the east bank of the river. It is the best
and most natural location for large manu
facturing, and it is far more accessible for
residences than any portion of the city
adapted to people with moderate means.
It is because the population of the Sixth
ward is composed of mechanics and, for
the most part, citizens of moderate means,
that the purse-proud Minneapolis P. P. so
bitterly denounces them and the proposi
tion to give them some business advan
tages.
It is not necessary to follow the notori
ous plunderers who conduct the P. P.
through the labyrinth of lies and
blackguardism with which they assail the
city council. These professional black
mailers, who rank no better than common
thieves, are certainly possessed of a vast
degree of assurance when they assume to
impugn the integrity of the city council,
or any other body of reputable citizens.
They assume for instance that Assistant
City Engineer Fuller is engaged
in a corner lot real estate specula
tion on the West side, and that his
relative, Aid. Gates A. Johnson, is a part
ner in the transaction. By accident the
Globe happens to know that Mr. Fuller's
entire real estate interests on the West
side flats consists in a one-fourth owner
ship of four lots, equivalent in the aggre
gate to one lot. Both he and Aid. Johnson
are denounced by this venal sheet, which
makes merchandise of its editorial columns,
as being engaged in a gigantic real estate
transaction and proposing to saddle a
"half million" debt upon the city to en
hance the value of one let!
The Globe has not taken the trouble to
inquire relative to the tissue of lies which
this Minneapolis sheet indulges in, but this
one, that we happen to be aware of, can
safely be set down as a sample brick of
the whole. It harps on a schema
of the city council to rob the
city of "half a million dollars"
while the lying scoundrels know that the
sum proposed is two hundred thousand
dollars, and that instead of being voted
away by the council, a popular vote of tho I
the city has authorized the issue of the
bonds and the aldermen are simply dele- j
gates to execute the popular will as de- j
clared at tha ballot box. j
As to ths exact location of the new
bridge the Globe has no positive opinion
to express; that must be determined by
engineering and navigation interests. It
should be so located and constructed as not
to interfere with navigation and made as
moderate in cost as possible and attain
the desired end. That there should
be another bridge below Waba
shaw street, we believe tho
majority of the citizens ad
mit. They have so voted, and it is
manifestly in the interest of the whole
city, on both sides of the river, to have a
second bridge. The billingsgate of con
fessed rascals, who always have and always
will, stand in the way of the march of im
provements in St. Paul, should have no
more effect than the idle wind. It
will be time enough to give heed to
the virtuous gasconade of the
Pioneer Press, when the only place afford
ed to find religions instruction is in a
warm corner of Satan's dominion. At
present the public look for both virtue and
religion in more reputable quarters.

Fatal Fall of a Bridge.
San Antonio, Tex., Dec. 13.—At 7a. m.
Tuesday the false work of the bridge across
Great Dry canon, four miles west of Pecos
river, on the Sunset road, and three-fourths
of a mile from the end of the Southern
Pacific track, fell in a solid mass, precipi
tating the hands a distance of seventy
five feet on the ' rocks below.
Seven men were killed outright,
one more has since died, and there is
. little hope for the recovery of three others.
The false work had been erected some
time, and ' the weight of the material
brought upon it for the permanent bridge
is supposed to have been too great to bear,
and it gave way over a deep gorge, having
almost perpendicular cliffs. The length of
the bridge is 200 feet. The dead have been
buried in an adjacent cave, and two phy
sicians are caring for the wounded. The
disaster will delay the completion of the
bridge perhaps sixty days.
The boot and shoe branch of the rubber
trade decided to continue the curtailment
of production, the price of raw material
being yet t_*o high. '

CHICAGO.
(Special Telegram to the Globe. ]
Chicago, Dec. 13. —Not ranch trading
has been done by the grain brokers to-day.
The laying of the corner stone of the mag
nificent new board of trade edifice has oc
cupied the greater part of their attention.
The condition of the markets, too, al
though .apposed to favor buyers, did not
seem to be conducive to very sharp com
petition. Nobody is doing anything in
wheat; oats keep stubbornly up; the future
of provisions is too problematic; and king
corn is altogether too unsettled to offer
any inducement to the operator outside
the small inside cliques in each mar
ket to invest very heavily. The
bulls who have had every
confidence, apparently, in their ability to
control com for the remainder of the year,
are becoming less prominent. Several ap
pear to be on the other side now, and the
army of little fellows are becoming tired
of putting up margin after margin, and
many of them hive dropped their deals and
pocketed their losses. Still there are others
who think the big fellows know what they
are about, and bide patiently their time.
It is too early yet to prophesy where corn
will end the yea.-.
In the wheat pit on the board trading
was again of a limited character
and tho feeling was weaker, with
prices ruling a shade lower all round. The
receipts were moderate and foreign news
more f ayorable, but there was not much
desire to purchase on the part of local
operators, and, with fair offerings, a weak
feeling was developed. The market closed
quiet and J^c lower for December, %c low
er for January, and %c lower for May than
the closing figures on 'change yesterday.
Winter is quiet and steady, and spring
dull, weak, and }_&■%£ lower for the spec
ulative grade.
Flour is uuiet and unchanged, with very
little doing.
While it lasted a very fair speculative
business was transacted in the corn
pit, and the feeling developed,
was unsettled and weaker, with
prices ruling lower all around. The clear,
cold weather, which was favorable for the
inspection of the new corn, had the effect
of bringing out free speculative offerings,
and prices declined lc for December and
j %c for January below the closing figures
on 'change yesterday, while May ruled
steady. Later.influenced by the falling olf
in the receipts and a better speculative de
mand, prices rallied, advanced Yi^J'Yuo
above inside figures, then fluctuated, and
nually closed about %c lower for year, '-}_c
lower for January and }_c lower for May
than the closing figures on 'change yes
terday. A
Oats are more active and a little stronger,
with a lively business in the futures and
cash firm, in good supply and demand,
steady in S'ora but a trifle shaky for sam
ple lots. Rye is in demand and firmer.
Barley quiet and dull.
The offerings of hog products wero free
early in the day, and prices ruled materi
ally lo.yer on all the leading articles. Dur
ing tha latter part of the session the feel
ing was stronger, and a good portion of
the decline was recovered. The shipping
demand was fairly active, but largely for
domestic cats of meats. Tho receipts of
products were moderate and shipments oi
all kinds quite liberal. Foreign advices
were less favorable to holders, and bacon
was quoted Is lower. Eastern markets with
out material change. The inquiry for pork
was active and the offerings free. Prices
ruled 10*/ 15c lower early, but rallied again
s@loc and closed steady. The offerings
of lard were free, and the demand was
active. Prices ruled 2j£@sc lower per
100 lbs. early in the day, but rallied again
and closed steady. Hogs sold 5 (if; 10c low
er, and 50,000 arrived. Owing to the
business of the day closing at noon, many
speculative orders were left over. More
than a day's business must be transacted
to-morrow, and this will have some effect
on the markets.
,
The Corner Stone.
Noon was the hour set for the
adjournment of the board end
the formation of the procession
for the corner stone laying, and all seemed
to be impressed with the fact that it was a
great historical event. It was bat natural
that not only the members of the board,
but citizens generally should take an inter
est in the occasion, which marked an era
in the commercial progress of the board
and the city. The board of trade started
in a very small way, and at first made very
slow progress, but to-day the institution is
one to boast of. Its membership embraces
some of the wealthiest and most influential
men of the city, and its new building will
rival any commercial ex
change in the world. In
1879 the first steps were taken toward the
erection of the structure, but it was not
until July 17, 1880, that it was resolved to
proceed with the work. Negotiations were
opened with the representative of the
Tracy estate. He agreed to sell 200 feet
front provided the board would get La
Salle street vacated and erect a building
on the* lot. The committee accepted the
term?, aud this act' was ratified by the
; board. But as soon as an effort was made '
jto close up the street there was trouble,
I and to save time Messrs. John It. Bensley,
P. D. Armour and S. E. Kent bought up the
whole . block and sold the board 2.0x173 '
feet, and after much litigation, got the
street closed.
The building will cost over $1,000,000.
The walls will be built of Fox Island gran
ite, costing $385,000 delivered and set in
the walls. The building will contain an
mmense exchange, or 'trading hall for the ! r
loard that will be over twice as large as the « t
present hall, and also 120 offices for rental, ; i
Chen there will be a call board, committee i
rooms, etc. It will be 170 feet, 0 inches, by : i
LOO feet in depth, with an office building ; 1
:o the south 170 feet, 9 inches, <
">y 63 feet in depth. The
vain facade will front LaSalle street, with *
i tower in the cenier32 feet wide, rising ]
240 feet. This tower, ornamented by vari
3us cornices, is capped by a pinacle 40 feet
in height, around the base of which runs a
aalcony, and is surmounted by a statue of
Mercury. The two' corners on LaSalle
?treot will be topped with pavilions 22 feet '
square. On each side of the new building '
will be a tablet 50 . feet ■ long by 28 feet
high. These will be of stone, and carved
upon them allegorical representations of
trade, commerce and the arts, nine. mam.
moth granite figures. The tablets are to
be crowned by statues of Ceres thirteen
feet high. These tablets will be each sup
ported by two brackets of stone twenty
five feet high, their base resting against
stone griffins. The two southern corners
will be double towers, raised slightly above
the roof. The sides and front between the
towers will be ornamented by colonades,
and the entre architecture gothic. The
main entrance is to front on LaSalle street,
passing through the tower, and a double
staircase will lead to the main hall eight
een feet above the sidewalk. This hall
is to be 155 feet by 100, with two
galleries. It is to be finished
in hard woods and marbles, and lighted
from above, the skylights 70x80 feet being
of stained glass. The second floor will
also contain the call board, 70x80 feet and
the offices and committee rooms. Above
this will be six stories for offices. The
total floor room will comprise 23,000
square feet. South of the main building
and joined to it will be a second building
for offices, 170>;C,"> feet and nine stories
high. The foundations of the building
havo been hud eighteen feet deep, and the
entire edifice will be fire proof. The
board of real estate man
agers expect to complete the
structure by May 1. 1881. y
At noon the board adjourned for the
day. Several bands then entered the
building and Lyon & Henley's want up on
the ileor of 'change, where i play ed several
lively airs for the bulls and bears to dance
to, after which the members fell in line,
four abreast. President Dunham and Sec
retary Randolph headed the line,'followed
i by the ex-presidents, board of directors,
and the members. On the street General
Joo Stock-Son and P. P. Oldershaw, the
marshals, arranged the procession as fol
lows:
Platoon of Police.
First Regiment Baud.
Company of the Eirst Regiment I. N. G.
President and Officers of the Board.
Members.
Members of the Open Board.
Chicago Stock Exchange.
Produce Exchange.
Detachment of Second Regiment.
Bands.
The procession was formed on LaSalle
street, and marched to Washington, thence
to Dearborn,' thence to Jackson,and thence
to the new building.
..." THE STOSE.
The corner stone was a fine piece of
granite, shaped somewhat like a carpen
ter's square. Its faces were highly pol
ished, and ; measured about 7x6 feet. It
weighed 12,442 pounds. A space was cut
into it for the reception ©f the box.
Tho stone was resting on blocks right
above its final resting place,
and was all ready to be put into
position. Tii3 derricks where decorated
with many large and small flags, and a
temporary platform was made out of the
adjoining masonry.
The streets above the corner stone were
crowded with people, and the Pacific hotel
windows were filled with ladies. Conspic
uous in one of the balconies was Clara
Louise Kellogg, who staid there - till the
stone was in place. When the crowd had
been wedged in about the center of attrac
tion, President Dunham introduced Lishop
Cheney, who made a prayer.
The band then struck up "America,"
and, after that, President Dunham mount
ed the stone, and briefly addressed those
present.
Secretary Randolph and Mayor Har
rison also spoke.
The bracing atmosphere acted like wine
upon the crowd, and they began to indulge
in various capers while the corner stone
was being lowered in position. A squad of
operators started to jump up end down,
keeping time to the music of the band,
and this spirit 'of agitation speedily dif
fused itself 'throughout the crowd. The
sight of hundreds of men bobbing up
and down in this fashion was quite ludri
cious, and vastly amused the spectators.
When the corner stone was being "tamped"
into place,' the jokers in the crowd
grunted in chorus eacitime the heavy
wooden implement came down. The pro
ceedings were also varied by load cries for
various members of the board and almost
constant calls for Mayor Harrison.
Trade Topics.
The arnuai report of the chief inspector
of grain at Chicago shows that the receipts
of grain during the year ending Nov. 1,
99.300,000 bushels, have been phenomenal
ly light, the lightest since 1877, being more
than 23,000,000 bushels less than those of
• the previous year. Prominent among the
causes which have combined to produce
this result are: First, the low
p.-icfis of grain prevaltnt
since the harvesting of the new crops ow
ing to the abundant yield in the European
countries which compete with us in sup
plying the markets of the world; second,the
unusually flourishing financial condition of
the Western farmers, which enables them
to hold their grain to a much greater ex
tent than formerly, for' remunerative
prices; and, third, the rapid increase ia the
milling capacity, and tho consequent tend
ency to ship wheat products to the seaboard,
instead of the wheat itself.
A Milwaukee broker interested
himself this morning in collecting the
opinions of leading members of the
chamber of commerce as to the probable
price of No. 2 spring wheat in this market
on May 10, 18S6. The prices set by differ
ent members ranged from 87c per bushel to
$1.50. The card containing the names of
the guesscrs and their respective guesses
wore sealed in an envelope, which will be
opened on 'change on the date named, and
will no doubt causa much amusement.
Two or three years c!go, a similar colit-ction
of opinions was obtained in December
and laid away until the following May. On
being opened an average of dif
ferent predicted prices was struck
and the ■ result was found to
be within a quarter of a cent of the actual
price. On another occasion, when the'
thing was tried, the difference between the
•eal price and the average predicted pri
:es was half a cent. By analogy with the
ibovo prices, wheat should sell next May
n the neighborhood of $1.02V£, for adding ,
ill to-day's guesses together, and dividing
;he amount by the number of guesses, pro
luces that result.
The investigation into the matter of di- *
riding commissions has been postponed.
It will quite likely be dropped.
NEW YOKE.
[Special Telegram to tho Globe.
New Yoke, Dec. 13.—The bulls scored
another success in Wall street to-day. It
seemed to be pretty generally understood
the differences regarding the percentages
among the roads would be adjusted, that
peace would follow and old rates be re
sumed. The activity has not been con
fined to a few properties as heretofore, but
became more general, the Omahas being
the leaders. During the afternoon the
preferred sold at TIG, -while the common
touched 57%, St. Paul rose to lOS1^;
Canada Southern was purchased by Van
derbilt brokers, the demand carrying it
above 70. One of the firm bought
10,000 shares of Western Union.
The coalers shared in the advance.
Lackawanna going about 2 per cent, over
yesterday's figures. The temptation to
realize has been great, and many have im
proved the occasion, causing sharp re
actions during the afternoon. The remark
able rise of 16 per cent in three weeks in
the Omaha stock would certainly warrant
the securing of profits.
The Western Union declared its usual I}.
per cent, quarterly dividend.
Money continues easy, and there seemed
to be a fair demand for stocks at the end
The effect cf the railroad war, or rather
of the negotiations of the men who are >e
sponsible for it, has been felt quite
as mach to-day in Wall afreet
as at any time since the
war began. What fluctuations the street
has experienced have been due to these ne
gotiations. The strength of the strong
opening, the activity and sharp advance of
the first hour, followed rumors thai the
conferring magnates were on the point of
a settlement. Th? announcement that
arrangements had been completed caused
a further advance.
"All the noon traders were buyers of the
grangers to-day,"said a prominent broker.
"The real advance, however, was caused
by Vanderbilt brokers, who had large buy
ing orders, especially in St. Paul. This
afternoon there has been a considerable
realizing by the Vanderbilt following,
and Mr. Briton was credited with selling.
Perhaps the sport is over for the present,
as far as the Vanderbilt interest is con
cerned. Short lines in some of the gran
gers, notably St. Paul, were put out by
brokers representing large bear operators.
The general feeling is that Omaha is high
enough, even if the war is settled. There
has been good realization and some short
selling on this idea. St. Paul has been
well bought by insiders yesterday and
to-dsy.
The Vanderbilt stocks have been bought
by parties having early information on
the Omaha deal. Points have been given
this afternoon for the purchase of the
Gould stock*.
The executive committee of Western
Union received a very good quarterly state
ment to-day. There is a great deal of cu
riosity as to whether the attorney general
will or will not consent to proceedings to
annul the charter of the company. The
general impression is that such permission
will be given.
Points are given to buy Missouri Pacific
on reactions. St. Louis houses usually
having early information on the South
westerns arc advised to buy Missouri Pa
cific for 108. Insiders advise
doing nothing in Wabash. Negotia
tions are pending ,which, it is said,
will affect the stock very favorably or very
unfavorably, as they happen to turn. An

boom the stock,. and that it is a purchase.
"It looks very much as if Mr. Vanderbilt
would finally be obliged to buy every rail
road in this country to keep up prices,"
said a broker. "Ho now has the Nickel
Plate, is negotiating for the West Shore,

some other road will be offered him or else
a bloody war will ensue. That pile of

Chicago. Dec. 13.— Allen, who was
to have been at '"Parson" Davies' place on
Randolph street between 10 and 11 o'clock
this morning had not made his appear
ance at 1 o'clock this afternoon at the
place designated. It is rumored that Allen
was somewhat intoxicated last evening and
his failure to appear may perhaps be
attributable to that cause. In a conver
sation with Elliot this morning he said that
Allen did not look nearly a*, healthy now
as he did the last time he saw him, about
fourteen years ago, at which time Allen
■ seconded Elliot in the Gallagher fight.
I Allen said last night that he had been
| twenty-four hours upon the road between
Pittsburgh and Chicago. Elliot this morn
ing took his customary run to Union park
before breakfast, after which he went to
Hyde park and back. If his fight with
Sillivan takes place at Pittsburgh, as it is
now thought probable, Elliot, Davis and
Plaisted. Elliot's trainer, leave for that
| point Monday next, returning here Christ
i mas day. The definite location of the
I fight will not bo known till to-morrow.
j However, Parson T)avies, Elliot's business
» manager, will give Richard K. Fox . until
, Saturday next to cover the money. Should
■ Fox not do so Davies will then take his
( money down.
Cincinnati's Commerce.
CixoixNxari, Dec. —The forthcoming
, annual report of Superintendent Maxwell,
;of the chamber of commerce, shows a
' marked increase of grain business the past
• year. The increase in receipts of all kinds
of grain is 1,780,000. The bulk of this
was in wheat. A peculiarity of the wheat
receipts is, that more than' half of the
year's receipts came daring tho last ten
weeks of the year. Through shipments
for the year have decreased. The im
proved facilities for storing grain and in
creased consumption by mills are the
causes of the growth of local business.

Washington, Dec. 13. c
Mextoh, 0., Aug. 23,1880.— My Deab (
Hubbell: Yours of the 19 th inst. received. «
Please say to Brady I hope will he give us t
all the assistance possible. I think he can *
help effectively. Please tell me how the ■,
departments generally are doing. As ever 1
yours, (Signed) J. A. Gabfielb.
This letter, the original of which is in
this city, has a secret history never before .
explained. One day Jay Hubbell, who now -,
has a national reputation as tax gatherer j
of blood money, called on Gen. Tom •
Brady, in his office in the postoffice depart
ment, in a state bordering on desperation, .
He explained that the congressional com- .
mittee had raised all the money it was ,
possible to get out of the clerks in the ex- ;
ecutive department; that they were $50,- ,
000 short, and unless it was raised Garfield
would be defeated. To this Brady replied: ,
"I have nothing to do with that. My
candidate at Chicago was Blame. Ho was
defeated. I was among a number of Re
publicans who felt sorely disappointed be
cause Blame was not nominated, and Gai
iield was. Way do you come to me with
your troubles ?"
Thereupon Hubbell sat down and labored
with Brady. He dwelt with emphasis upon
th:? great probability that iT the money
needed was not raised the Democrats would
-.rtainly elect Hancock. "I have exhausted
every other resource." said ho, "and I now
come to you."
"And you want me to raise $60,000," said
Brady with that peculiar nonchalance of
the man.
"Yes, and as soon as possible," said
Hubbell, nervously.
"Well," said Brady, "I can raise this
money. I will raise it if you will agiee to
my terms. You, of course, know from
whom I shall raise it. Before I do any
thing in the matter, however, I want a let
ter from Gen. Garfield which, will convey
to me the assured fact that he knows I am
to raise it. Garfield knows Ido not favor
his administration."
Hubbell then and there declared he
would write the letter requested to Gen.
Garfield, and on the same day he did
address a letter which called forth the
reply at the beginning of the dispatch. On
the day that Hubbell's letter reached Men
tor, Stephen W\;JDorsey, ex-senator from
Arkansas, also arrived there. He sat with
Gen. Garfield as he opened his mail. When
Hubbell's letter was reached he handed it
to Dorsy, who also read it. The first im
pulse of the general was to answer it at
once, indeed, he was about to proceed to do
so when Dorsey said:
"Areyou going to answer this letter?"
"Yes," said Garfield. "I was just about
to do it."
"Well, if I were you" said Dorsey "I
would not write to Brady, as Hubbell sug
gests, but write to Hubbell instead."
General Garfield did as Dorsey
suggested, and penned the "My Dear Hat
bell" letter. The motive Dorsey had in
constraining the subsequently elected j
president not to write to Brady was be
cause of Lis own personal hatred to
Brady. During the entire presidential
campaign Dorsey and Brady did not speak
to each other, and when thrown together
scarcely tolerated recognition. Dorsey did
not want Gen. Garfield to write to Brady,
because he wanted Brady to remain under
the impression that ho was to be over
shadowed in case of Garfield's election.
Until the star route prosecutions began
they did not resume their friendly rela
tions. Upon the receipt of the "My Dear
Hubbell" letter, it was taken at once to
Brady. .At first he was not disposed
to do anything because the letter had not
been directed to him in person. A condi
tion of action on his part was that he
should retain the letter. This was com
plied with and Brady now has it. Touch
ing the $50,000, Brady did raise the money
from the star route contractors, and turned
it over to Jay Hubbell. As Garfield was
elected, this $50,000 no doubt contributed
largely to a Republican victory.
JAY HUBBELL
was in his seat in the house to-day. He
expressed himself vigorously in regard to
Ferry's fight or the Michigan senator
ship, saying all kinds of wicked things
against Ferry himself. In an interview
to-night Hubbel charges that Ferry made
a corrupt use of federal patronage and
money in securing votes in the legislatnre.
He says Ferry is a moral
imbecile, who, under a cloak
of temperance principles, indulges
freely in intoxicints. "If," says Hubbel!,
'this man should be re-elected to tho sen
ate, it will rost.lt in the disruption of the
Republican party in Michigan. He de
nies Ferry's assertion that he issued his
notorious asses -sraent circular against the
wish of the administration, and says that
he simply followed out the instructions of
the party leaders. Hubbell indulges in a
good deal of strong language, and says
while he has no hopes of being elected
himself, he will give odds that Ferry is de
feated. Ferry, however, feels confidant
that he will be successful, and says
tlytf ha is already sure of more
votes in the caucus thai will be necessary
for his election. Hubbell's opposition, he
says, amounts to nothing.
A REMINISCENCE OF THE VIBGINIUS.
Mr. Springer this morning procured the
passage of a resolution in the house direct
ing the payment of $25,000 from the Vir
ginia indemnity fund to Mrs. Eliza Dunn,
of Chicago, mother of Gen. W. SA. C. Ryan,
of the Virginius crew, slaughtered at San
tiago de Cuba, Nov. 4, 1873. ' The | resolu
tion has already passed the senate, and it

Senator Mitchell held a long and earnest
conversation with him. The younger
Cameron came forward and put in a word.

BOTES AND HABBOB APPSOPBIATIONS.
At the cabinet meeting yesterday it was
leciJtd that the question of submit
ing any river or harbor estimates

o the discretion of the secretary of war.
dr. Lincoln will be waited upon by a sub

nerce to-morrow on the same subject. It
s also understood that the president indi
cated his intention of appointing a dem
>crat to the position of commissioner of

would exactly balance the political com
plexion of the board.
