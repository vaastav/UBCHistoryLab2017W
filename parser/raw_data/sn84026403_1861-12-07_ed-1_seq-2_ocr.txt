In tba midst af unprecedented nolitical

A disloyal porting of the American people

in an attempt li divide and destroy the

A ualion which endures factious domestic
division is exposedlo disrespect abroad, and
one party, if not both, is sore sooner or later
to invite foreign intervention. Nations thus
tempted to inlerler, ate not always able to
resist t he counsels ol seeming expediency end
ungenerous ambition, although measures a
dopled under acelffi'Rrl'uviices seldom fail to
b" unloitiiuate and injurious to those adopt

The dielnyni c't;Zns of the United States,'
who have ollered the ruin of our couulry in
return for' the aid and comfort which they
have invoked abroad, have received less pa
Iroiiauu aud encouragement than tbey prohn-
