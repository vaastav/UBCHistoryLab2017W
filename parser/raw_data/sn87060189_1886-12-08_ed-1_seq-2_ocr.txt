For tho week ondlng Decomber 4th,
there were 581,011 standard silver dollars
issued from tho mints, against 099,393 for
the corresponding period last year.
Amonq the political plums that fell to
Kontuckians last week was a $1,000

Congressman Laffoon says Colonol
John Young Brown, of Hendorson, wants
to succeed Senator Bock, and will shortly
mnke his wants known to tho peoplo of
the State.
The ordinary expenditures of tho Government
for the flfical year ending June
30, 1880, amounted to a littio moro than
$287,000,000. Of this sum $03,500,000
wero paid out for pensions.
O. P. Huntinoton will gain control of
the Louisvillo. New Albany and Chicago
Railroad within ninoty days, if a report
from New Yor is true. This great railway
king is gradually enlarging his vast
system of roads.
It seems the Snow King lias been having
a big time down South in the past
few days. Throughout Tennessee tho
fall is the heaviest ever known averaging
from two to four feet in depth. At other
places tho fall was unprecedented.
The Montgomeroy Circuit Court is in
sesion at Mt. Sterling with an unusually
large docket tho largest, in fact, sinco
the war. It consists of 127 criminal, 258
equity and 133 ordinary cases. Tho lawyers
of that section ought to bo happy.
Thk United 8tutes Circuit Court is in
Beasion at Covington, with Judgo Barr
presiding, Between one and two hundred
moonshiners from the mountain
countios are in attendance. Sixty indictments
wero reported by the grand jury
yesterday.

Kou the year ending June 30, 1880, tho
revenue of the Government amounted to
$12,700,000 more than tho previous year,
while tho expenditures wero $17,700,000
less than 1885. Under Democratic rule,
the government is being economically administered.
A saving in one year of
nearly J18.000.000 is something tho Republicans
would hardly have eUccted.
At a teceiit suasion of the Circuit Court
iu Laurel County about two hundred indictments
wero reported by the grand
jury. Of tho number, were
for soiling votes at the lato election.
Claims amounting to about $4,000 wore
allowed against tho State, and the sum
would have been larger had the Judge
anil Attorney failed to exercise the closest
precaution.
Labor has beon more abundantly
durini; tho past four months than
over in the history of the country. Tho
percentage of idle to employed labor is
lower at this time than since the boom of
1832. The cost of living is estimated at
20 per rent, less than then, and the purchasing
power of monoy is put at 20 per
ct?nt. greater by Bomo authorities. These
conditions account largely for the unprecedented
activity in house and shop
building. Philadelphia Star.
A boy was found on the
street in Cincinnati tho other day too
drunk to tell his namo. A short time
previous to this tho Work-house Directorn
released a who was nerving
a sentence for selling liquor to miners.
'Comment is hardly necessary. The best
way to compel obedience of the law is to
enforce it to the letter. We have tho
law. What is needed is a certainty of
tho execution.
Skykkm. parties have been indicted at
London, Laurel County, this State, for
Belling their votes at tho last -election,
which brings ifoith the following pointed
remarks from the Leader:
Thoro entirely too much of this tinffip In
votes Iu till county. Tho floating element
bold the balance ut power, aud auy mnn, regardless
ot his qnallilcitioiiK to hold oTlcc,
can boetcoted If he will put up sufficient cash.
It would he better for all concerned If theso
peoplo wore disfranchised. A man who will
uM his prerogative as a cltlr.en Is not worthy
or QlllKsnNhlp, and wo hope these canon will
hf vigorously prosecuted.
The truth of tho above remarks Ih
by all, and tho day is not far
when such "citizens" will meet with
a punMiment tlint will lit tho case.
OplnionB of the Pfessl
Tho Louisvillo Commercial Bays: " Tho
message is dovoid of rhetorical flourish. It
is carefully written, and is not lacking in
interest for tho general reader."
Speaking of tho President's message,
tho Cincinnati Enquirer says: Altogether
it Is a paper which will not simply
challongo attontion, hut command it.
At tho same time we aro impelled to tho
suggestion that nono of tho measures
Biiggested therein will meet tho approval
of tho present Congress."
Tho President's messago is a torse,
strong, manly document, and will mako
a good model for all future Democratic
Presidents. Seldom have public measures
boon bo capably handled or boon
brought into so complete a harmony with
the ascertained needs of the peoplo of tho
whole country. Louisville Post.
The Standard, of London, Eng., says :
" President Cleveland's message is a Ben-
siblo and statesmanlike production and
eminently pacific. A note of menaco is
not heard. Although in describing tho
fisheries quontion ho throws unduo blamo
upon tho Canadian fisheries, yot not a
word is spoken to oxcito hostility or
kindloetrifo."
The message is, on tho whole, an excellent,
documont, giving ample
ovidonco of conscientious and painstaking
work, and furnishing abundant
testimony, if it wero needed, to tho
patriotism and public spirit of its author.
Mr. Tildon, doscribing Mr. Cleveland,
onco said of him, " he is a man who would
rather write a bad paper for himself than
havo a frlond write him a good ono."
Tho present paper is not a bad, but a
good ono, and it is obviously tho product
of the President's own genius. It marks
progress and betrayB improvement in
many ways; notably in an oasly familiarity
with prevailing ideas and less of a
certain crudo pragmatism which hns
sometimes shown itself in Mr. Cleveland's
writing. Its tono is that of an
honest man, and, whether wo agrco with
all Us conclusions or not, wo aro bound
to respect its intelligence and candor.
Louisvillo Courier-Journal.
Major M. O. Johnson, ono of tho most
prominent attorneys of Lexington, died
last night. He was eighty years of age.
We have heard of two instances thia
week that illustrate tho good results being
brought about by the new Revonuo
law. Ono citizen who has heretofore
been assessed at about $20,000 or $25,000
voluntarily gave In his property for taxation
at $50,000. Another who was assessed
last year at a little over 52,000, reported
$8,000 this year for taxation. And
yet there are some people who want this
law repealed.
Mkkifke County has about an even
dozen candidates iu tho field for the
Legislature, and the mountaineers arc
promised an exciting contest. Tho
main quostion at issue is the election of
a Unitod States Senator to succeed Senator
Beck. Some of the candidates lutve
linked their political fate with that of the
wily and distinguished ex-Scotchman,
while others favor Kentucky's honored
son, Speaker Carlisle.

Timely Warning.
Huntington's SouUiBide railroad, from
the Big Sandy to the Licking, is being
bnilt by convicts, and more convicts are
being planted along the line of tho Louisville
Southern to do tho work on that
line. This is bud enough, but it ia not bo
bad as using this felon labor to break up
established mining communities. When
the branch prison is completed, if tho
Democratic party doesn't put a stop to
ttw working of convicts all over the State
and confine this striped labor within
walls, there will be no Democratic party
led in Kentucky. Louisvillo Times.
CommunlcHted.
Pithy Points From Washington.
What excuse can men offer for being
engaged in tho disreputable business of
making drunkards of their neighbors,
other than that there is money in the
trade?
What do whisky sellers give a man in
exchange for his hard-earned money,
other than red eves, a shining nose,
breath, bud credit, a diseused mind,
a freo pass to the penitentiary or gallows,
and lastly, loss of body and Bonl?
A man must certainly be void of conscience
who can, day in and day out,
serve to his neighbors ond ottnrs that
which foments airifo and discord, incites
to crime and murder, ond winch will
cause a man to do what nothing else
will strike down his mother or father.
How can any man who has sons look
with complaisance upon a business which
is lying in wait to entrap them, and onco
it has woven its deadly coils about them,
forever claims them as itH nwn offspring
of vice and iufamy V "
How can any man who cares anything
for the fnturo of his soiih view with other
than distrust and suspicion, a business
which is almost certain to be the downfall
and ruin of some of them ?
Howls it possible font man who looks to
his sons for his honor and support, to
entertain for tho whisky trade in any of
its branches anything but loathing, and
for the men ongaged in it the eamo consideration
that ho would for a murderer?
Tho drunkard 1b incomparably the superior
in everything that goes to make a
mnn to tho ono that sells tho liquor,
whether It bte by tho barrel, jug or glasa.
Tho man who deals in tho article which
makes drunkards, no matter whothor in
large or small quantities, is tho sworn
enemy to innocence, to virtue, to manhood
and to all olso which makes life
worth living. ,
There Is no man of ordinary Intelligence
but knows that tho whisky business,
besides being a fou to all that is of any
value in life ia tho sworn ally of crime and
murders; of anarchy and rioters; of jails
penitentiaries.
That tho men who aro engaged In tho
busiueBB of making drunkards should bo
viewed lu their light, as tho diro enemies
of tho household and State, and to bo
shunned as they would a pestilenco.
