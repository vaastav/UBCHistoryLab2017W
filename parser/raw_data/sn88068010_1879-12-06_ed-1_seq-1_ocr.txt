THE MESSAGE.
Feliow-Clttsen of the Senate and House of
Kepresentattve
The member of the Fortv-slxth Conirress
have assembled In their first res-ular session
under circumstance calling for mutual con
gratulations and grateful acknowledgment to
the Giver of all good for tho largo and un
usual measure of National prosperity which
we now enjoy. The most interesting event
which have occurred in our publio affairs
since my last annual messatre to Conirress sra
connected with tho financial operation of the
Government directly affecting the busi
ness Interest of the country. I con
gratulate Congress on the successful execu
tion of the Resumption act. Atthetime fixed,
and In the manner contemplated by law. United
States notes began to bo redeemed In coin.
Sinoe the 1st of January hut they have been
firomptly redeemed on predentin ion, and in all
lusiness transact if ins, public and private. In all
parts of the country, they are received and
paid out a tho equivalent of coin.' Tbo de
mand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in
exchange for United States notes has been
comparatively small, and tho voluntary do
posit of coin and bullion in exchange for note
has been very largo. The excess of the pre
cious metals deposited or exchanged forlTnftcd
State rv4m over the amount of I'nited State
notes redeemed is uuout 4t).0Ci).iKU.
The resumption of specie pay moots has been
followed by a very wrest revival of business.
With a currency equivalent in value to the
money 01 tne commercial womu, we are ena-
uiea to enter upon an equal competition wlto
other nations in trndo and production. The
increasing foreign demand for our manufac
tures ami agricultural products bas caused a
large balance of trndo in our favor, which has
been paid in gold, Jnun the 1st of July last to
Novemlier 15, to the amouut of about M!,UUu,
nuo. since the resumption of specie psymcnts
there has been a marked and gratifying im
provement of the public credit. The bowls of
the Government bearingonly 4 per cent, inter
est have sold at or aliove nar. suttioient in
mount to pay off all of toe National debt
wfaloh was redeemable under -the present
law. The amount of interest saved aiiuually
by the process of refunding the debt since
March 1, 1S77, 1 14.'.'7,177. The bonds .sold
were latwelx m small sum, and the number
of our citizens jiow holding the publio securi
ties is much greator than ever before. The
amount of the Natlonul del, which matunw
in leas than two years, is fTic.U!l,70u, of which
iO,0il0,U bear interest-at. tho rate of five
per cent., and the balance is In bonds tiearing f
per ceni, interest, it is oeueveu tnat tnts pun
of' tho public i -debt can be refunded
by tho. Issue of . four per cent, bonds and
by the reduction of Interest whlob will thus
be effected aliout XIKOOM-OJ can be annually
saved to the Treasury. '! secure this impor
tant mliirition of Interest to be paid by tho
United States further legislation is required,
which It is hoped will be provided by Congress
duriiur It- present session. The ooiuiuro of
gold by fhemint of tho United State during
tne last nscai year was tu,wo,tix.

wkich the great body cf citizens tuko In tbe
progress of tbo ootintry toward a mora gen
eral and complete establishment, at what
ever oost, of -universal security and free
dom la the exercise of the elective franchise.1
While many topics of political concern demand
great attention from our people, both in the
spher ef National and State authority, I flud
no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed
In mv last annual mossnge, that no temporary
or administrative interests- of -Government,
however urgent or weighty, will ever destroy
th seat of our people la defense of the
primary rights of cttizonshlp, and that tha
power of publio opinion will override all
political prejudice and all' sectional aud
State sttabnenta in demanding that all over
our wide twritory the name and character of
citiseu of tho I'nited States shall mean one
and the same thing, ud carry with them un
challenged seen rtt v and respect. I earnest ly
appeal to the iutelllgenoe and patriotism of
all good citiseni of every part of the country,
however much they may oe divided In opin
ion on other political subjects, to unite in
eompelllngobttiilonoe to existing law aimed
t toe pmtechiat of the . right of suffrage.
I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply
any defect In these law which experience
has shown, and ahlch it la within Its power to
remedy. I agat invoke the oo-operatioa of
ihe Executive and Legislative authorities of
the States in this great purpose. I am fully
convinced that if -in public mind oan be set
t rest on thl paramount question of
popular right, no mou nbstiicle will thwart

full of the- Parliamentary patronage, nnd of

The completion or tno report, owing to the
extent of the labor Involved- in its prepara

any provision cither for the compensation
or tho expenses of tho Commission, has been
postponed until the present time. It is here

t is In tbe power of the Executive to do much

people themselves, far more than their othcer
in public station, are Interested in a pure, eco
nomical and vigorous Aiunlnlstratlon.. . By
law enacted In lKi and nnd now in stiu-
stunee incorporated In th itcvised Statutes,
tho practice of arbitrary appointment to tbsid
several subordinate grades la tbe great lie 1 -
part men ts was condemned, and exnmina- 4
tionsastn rapacity, to bo conducted ny me
Itrpartmentol Boards of Examiners, wore
pn !v Id i-d for and made conditions of admission
to tho public serrloe. These statutes are a de
cision br Congress that examinations of some
sort a to attainments and capacity are essen
tial to the well-being of the publio service.
Tbe Important. questions since tbe enactment
of these laws have been as to tbo character of
these examinations, and whether official favor
and partisan influence, or commurr right and
merit were to oontroi tn access to tne exami
nations. In practice these .- examina
tions have not always been open
worthy peraeiia generally who might wisn
- be examined. Official favoritism and
partisan Imluenoe, as a rule, appear to have
designated those who alone were permitted to
go before tbe Exnmlning Boards, subjecting
even the Examiner to a pressure from the
mends of tbe candidates very difficult to re
sist. As a consequence, tho standard of ad
mission fell lielow that which the publio In
terest deafnndod. - It was almost lnevitnblo
.thtysteni which provided for various
separate Hoards of Examiners, with no com
mon suxrvllon or uniform method of pn
ccdure, rhould result In confusion, tnoonoisf
"ney, and inndi-qusto tests of oapnclty highly
detrimental to tho publio luterest. A f urthur
BIM' "lore radical change was obviously re
quired, in the annual message of Decem

there Is no duty which so lunch embar
rasses the Exeoutlv and beads of Depart

I recoin mended in my annual message of

the excellent qualifications of those admit tod

The nppi-unriatlon for Judicial expenscs,
hcretofoio made for the ' liemirtmcnt of
Justice in gross, wassuhdlvidcd at tbe last ses
sion of Congress, and no appropriation what
ever was made for tho payment of tho fees of
Marshals nnd tbelr deputies, cither iu the ser
vice of processor forthe discharge of other
duties, and since June 30 these officers have
continued the performnnce of their duties
without compensation from the Government,
taking upon themselves tho necessary inci
dental outlays, as welt as rendering
heir . own ervlees, - In onty a row
unavoidable - instance has the proper
execution' of - the process of the United
States failed by reason of the-absence of Ihe
rcnuisitR aiiuronrliitlous. This course of offi
cial conduct on the part of tbo officors, highly
cnilitablc tn their fidelity, was advised by tho
Attorney-Genoral, who Informed them, how
ever, that they would necessarily have to rely
for Ibolr compensation upon tne prospect oj
future legislation by Congress. I therefor
rsts-clallv recommend thot immediate approi
pnntion bo mailo by Congress for this pur
pose. Tbo act making tho principal appropi ia,
tlon forthelepartmdnt of Justice at previous
sessions has uniformly oontnlned- the follow
ing clause: "And for defraying tho expense,
which may be Incurred in the enforcement oi
the net approved Feb. 2H, 1B7D, entitled -An net
to amend an act approved May HO, 1870." cu
nt lint -An act to enforce me right oi cifizons
of vho United States to- vote In the several
Stains of the United States, and for other pur-
pom-t,' or any nets amendatory ttieieor or
supplementary thereto. No appropriation
was luude for Ibis ' purpose for' the
current year. As no general elec
tion for mem tiers of Congress -osourred,
tbe omission was a matter of little prac
tical importnncn. Such election' will,
however, lake place during the ensuing year.
nnd tho appropriation made fur tho pay of
Marshals and Deputies should be sufficient to
embrace compensation for tbo services tbey
may be required to perform at such election.
The business of tbe Supremo Court is at pres
ent largely In arrears. It cannot be expected
that mure causes can be decided
than are now disposed of In Its annual
session, br - that hy any assiduity the
distinguished Magistrates who compose the
Court can accomplish more than is ,nw done.
Iu the courts of many of tho circuits also ths
business has increased to such an extent that .
tho delay of justice will call 'the attention of
Congress to an appropriate rtmiedy. It is be
lieved that all is done in each circuit whieh
can fairly be expected from its Judicial force.
The evil nrislnn from delay are loss heavily felt
by the United States than by private suitors, as
Us causes arc advanced by tho eourts when it
is seen that they involve the discussions of
questions of a publio character. The remedy
suggested by too Attorney-General is tho. up
poititmcntof additional Circuit Judges, nnd
the creatton of nn Intcrmcdiiite Court of Errors-
and Appeals, which shall relieve the
Supreme Court of a part of Its jurisdiction,
while a larger force is also obtained forthe
performance of circuit duties. 1 recommend
tbis suggestion to tho consideration of Con
gress. It would seem to afford a complete
remedy.and would involve, if ten additional
Circuit Judges are appointed, nn expenditure
at the present rate of salaries of not more than
Stiu.OuJa year, which would certainly be small
lu comparison with the objects, to be attained.
THK post-oi'i--k;is.
Tho report of the Post iiiiutor-Goncrnl bear
testimony to the general revival of business
throughout tbo country. Tho receipts of the

establishment of an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected

Arrangements are also made for tho educa
tion of a number of Indian boys and girls be-
v.ngtng to tnoes on tne rasinc slope in a simi

Institutions will commend themselves to the
litierality of Congress and to the philanthropic

bast spring information was received of tbe
organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, the object of which wb the
occupation by unauthorized persona of cer
tain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by
the Cherokecs to the Government for the pur
peso of settlement by -other Indian tribe.'
Un the nh of April I issued a proclamation
warning nil persons against participation in
sin h on attempt, and by the co-operation of
a military force the invasion was promptly
chocked. It 1 my purpose to -protect tho
right of the Indian Inhabitants of that Territo
ry to tbe full extent of the Executive; but I
wiaild be unwise to ignore the fact tbat a
Tivritory so large and so fertile, with popu
lation so sparse, nnd so a-reat a wealth or un
turned resources, will bo found more exposed
to ,the repetition of such attemps as hap
pened this year when the surrounding States
were most densely settled, and the westward
movement of our population looked still more
eatji-rly for fresh land to- occupy. Under
siusi circumstance the difficulty of main
taining the Indian Territory in its present
tun to will greatly increase, and the Indian
trila-s Inhabiting it would do well to' prepare
for such a contingency.' I, therefore,' fully
approve of tbe advice given to there by
the Secretary of the Interior on a recent oo
cftsit.n to divide among themselves, lu sever
alty! as large a quantity of theirlonds as they
can cultivate- to acquire Individual title in
fee. Instead of their present tribal ownership
la oommon, and consider o what- Banner the
biilnhce of heir lands may be disposed nf by
tho Government for their benefit. By adopt
ing sjuch a policy they would more certainly
secure for themselves the value of their pos
sessions, and at the same time promote their
progress in civilization and prosperity than
by endeavoring' to perpetuate tho... present
Bl'ntoiof things in tho Territory. - - -.
Th question whether a change In tho oon--trol
of tho Indian service should be made was,
in th Forty-fifth Congress, referred to s Joint
Comihittee of both Houses for inquiry and re-
fsirt.Tln my last annual message 1 expressed
be hope that the decision of that question,
then hi prospect, would arrest further agita
tion of this subject, euch agitation being apt
to pnsluco a disturbing effect upon the service
as wcU as the Indians themselves. Since then,
the Committee having reported, the question
has been decided in the negative by a vote In the
Houso of Bcpresentativcs. For the reason
here stated, and in view of the fact that f ur
thor ujieertninty on this point will bo calcu
lated to obstruct other niuch-ncedod legisla
tion, to weaken tho discipline of tho service
and to unsettle salutary measures now In
progress for tho government nnd improve
ment of the Indians, I respectfully recom
mend that the decision arrived at by Congress
at its lst session be permitted to stand. -

The offorts made by the Department of tho
Interiig- to nrrest the depredations on tho timber-lands
of tho United States have been con
tiuuod.innd have met with considerable suo
cess. A large number of oases of trespass
havo len prosecuted In tho courts of the
United States. Others have bcensottlcd, tha
trespassers offering to make payment to the
Governoient for the value of tho timber
taken i by them. Tbo proceeds ot
theso prosecutions nnd settlements turned
liitothoiTreosury far exooed in amount the
sums uismipriiited by Congress for this pur
pose. A. inoro important resuu, ninrt-i er,
consists In the fact that the destruction of our
public forests by depredation, although such
cases st Ul occur, has been greatly reduced in
extent, And ft is probable that if the present
policy it vigorously pursued; and sufficient
provision to that end made by Congress, suob
trespassrs at least those on a liirge senle can
be entirdly suppressed, except In the Torribv
ries, where timber for tho daily requirements;
of the population cannot, under tho present
state oil the law, be otherwise obtained.
