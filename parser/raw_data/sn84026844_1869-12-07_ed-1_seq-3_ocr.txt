UKCONSTKUCTtON. jj
Emerging from n rebellion of gigantic j
magnitude, aided as it was by tho sympn- o
thy and assistance of nations witli which li
wo were at pence, eleven States of the d
I Yum'were four years ago left without ?
legal Stato governments; a debt had o
been contracted; American coinmcrco ^
was almost driven from tho sens; the in- [|
liiMtry of one-half of tho country had '
been taken from the control of the capi- ^
tali.st and placed where labor rightfully f,
belongs?in tho keeping of the laborer. a
The work of restoring State'governments y
loyal to tho Union, of protecting and fos- c
teriug frco lnbor, and providing means
for paying tho interest on the public debt,
hits received ample attention from Con- ?|
gress, though your ollbrUt have not met (
with tho success in these particulars that J
might have beeu desireu. Vet, on the e
whole, they bavo been more successful i
than could have been reasonably anticipa- ?
ted.' fl

Seven States which passed ordinances {]
of Hece8sio? have been fully restored e
to their places in tho Union. The II
eighth (Georgia) held an election at v
which she ratified her Constitution, re- b
publican in form, elected a Governor, c
members of Congress, n State Legisla- l'
lure, and the other officers required. The *
Governor was duly installed, and the tj
Legislature met and performed all tho w
acta therein required ol them by the re- n
construction nets of Congress. Subse- 1
quently, however, in violation of the tl
Constitution which they had just ratified, o
as since decided by the Supreme Court C
of the State, they unseated tho colored
members of tho Legislature, and admit- J
ti'd to seats somo members who nre dis- "
qualified by tho third clause of the four- J
toenth amendment to tho Constitution; t(
an article which they themselves bad
ontributed to nitify. ti
lender theso circumstances I would t!
submit to you whether it would not be t
wise without delay to enact a law autboriz- I
ing the Governor of Georgia to convene 0
tlit! members originally elected to tho J
legislature, requirii/fc each member to
take the oath prescribed by the recon- f]
struction act, ami nono to bo admitted fl

DECLINE OP COMMKItCE.
The loss of oar commerce is tlio only
result of tho lato-robellion which has not
received sufficient attention from you.
To this subiect 1 call your earliest attention.
1 will not now suggest plans by
which this object may bo effected, hut
will, if necessary, inako it tho subject of
a special message during tho session of
Congress.
Mississirri and tkxas.
At the March term, Congress, by joint
resolution, authorized tho Executivo to
order clectioua in tho States of Virginin,
Mississippi and Texas, to submit to them
the constitutions which euch had previously,
in'convention, framed, and submit
tho constitutions, cither entiro or in
separate parta, to bo voted upon at tho
discretion of tho Executive. Under this
authority elections were called.
In Virginia tho election took place on
the(Jth ot July, 1801). Tho Governor and
Lieut. Gov. electcd have been installed.
Tho Legislature met and did all required
by this resolution, and by all the reconstruction
acta of Congress, and abstained
from all of doubtful authority. 1 recommend
that her Senators and lleprcaontalives
be admitted, and that tho State bo
fully restored to its place in the family of
States.

nets of tho Legislatures of these .States,
when they moot, will bo such as to meet
your approvalj and thus close tho work
of reconstruction.
FINANCES.
Among tho evils growing out of tho
rebellion and not yet referred to; is that
of an irredeemable curroncy. it is an
evil that 1 hope will receivo your most
earnest attention. It is a duty, and one
of the highe8t;dutios of Governments to
Hecuro to tho citizens a medium of exehange
of fixed, unvarying value. This
implies a return to a specio basis, and no
substitute for it can bo devised. It should
ho commenced now, and reafched at the
earliest practical momont consistent with
a fair regard lor tho interests of tho i
debtor class. Immediate resumption, if I

would compel tho debtor class to pay l)eyond
their contracts tho promium ou gold
at tho dato of their purchaao, and would
' ring bankruptcy ana ruin to thousands, j
Kluctuatious, however, in tho paper valuo j
of tho measure of all values (gold) is dotri* i
mental to tho interests of trado. It makes
tho man of business an involuntary >
gambler, for in all sales where tho futuro i
payment is to bo mado both parties j
Hpcculato as to what will bo tho yuluo of
tho currency to bo paid and received. 1
earnestly recommond to you then such
legislation as will itiHUro a gradual return
to specie payment, and put an immediate
Htop to fluctuation in tlio valuo of currency.
Tho methods to nccuro these
results aro numerous, as aro tho speculators
on political ocouoiny. To Hucuro tho
latter, 1 soo but ono way, and that
Ih to authorize tho Treasury to redeem
Uh own paper at n fixed prion whenever
presented, to withhold from clrou*
liitIon all Huch currency redeemed until
told ngaln for gold. Tho vast resource* ot
Hie nxllon,both developed and nudevel
oped, ought to make onr orndtt (lie baa
on earth. Willi a leea harden of Inta
tlon than the cltlren lias endured foi
alx yoara p??t, the entire publlo deb
oould be paid lu ten yeara; but It la no
desirable tbal the people should tx
taxed to pay It In that time. Year In
year th? ability to pay lnorea.ua In i
rapid ratio, but the burden or Inlerwi
ought to Im reduced an rapidly as car
be done without tlio violation of tin
uontraot,
FUNDING TIIKDKnr.
The publlo debt la represented ill
srirnt part by bonds having from live
10 twenty and from ten to forty veart
it? run, ueariug luiereat al the rale at I
nor cent, ami 6 par oent. retpectlvely,
[( Ih optional with the Government to
pay these bond* ut auy period after Iht
sx pi ration of the llrat time mentioned
upon their face, The time has already
sxplred when a great part of them may
Do taken up. The time Ih rapidly approaching
wlien all may be. It la beloved
that all which are now duo may
jo replaced by bonds bearing a rate of
n teres I not eiceedlng 4K per oent; and
ih rapidly an the remainder bocomes
luo that they may bo replaced lu the

5e necesaary to authorize the interest to

nouey centre? of Knrope, or bv any
tanlstant Treasurer of the United
Kates, at the option of the holder of

TARIFF TAXATION.
The subject of tariff and Internal taxlion
will necessarily receive your atenlion.
The revenues of the country
ire greater than the requirements, and
auywlth safely bo reduced; but aa the
undlug of the debt In a four or a four
ind a half per cent bond would reduce
he aunusl current expense largely,
bus utter funding Justifying a greater
eduction of taxation than would be
tow expedient, I suggest a postpone'
nent of this question until the next
neeting of Congress. It may be advls*
ble to modify taxation and the tarilfin
Balances where unjust or burdensome
Incriminations are made by the presut
laws, but? general rovlaion of the

TIIB ALABAMA CLAIM*.
Toward* the close of the last administration
a convention was signed at
London for the settlement of outside
claims between Great Britain and the
United states, which fallal to recslvo
the advice and consent of the Senate to
its ratlllcatlon. The time and the circumstances
attending the negotiation
of the treaty were not favorable to Its
acceptance by the people of (he United
Slates, and Its provisions were wholly
Inadequate-for the settlement of the
grave wrongs that had been sustained
by this government as well as by its
citizen*. The Injuries resulting to the
United States by reason of the oourse
adopted by Great Britain during our
late civil war, In the increased rtUes of
anil import* iind In other obstructions
to domestic industry and production; in
Its Direct upon the foreign commerce of
the country; in the decrease and transfer
to Oreat Britain of onr commercial
marine; in the prolongation of war
and Increased cost both in treasure
and in lives, of Its suppression could
not bo adjusted and sntislled as ordinary
commercial olalras which continually
arisQ between commercial
nations, Aud yet the Convention
treated them Himplyns such ordinary
claims, from which they differ more
widely in the gravity of thoir character
thnn in the magnitude of their amount,
great oven us in that difference. Not a
word was found lu the treaty and not
nn inferonce could be drawn from U to
remove the senae'or the unfriendliness
of the oourse or Great
Britain in our Htruggle for existence
which had so deeply and
universally ImpresNed itarlf upon the
peoplnof this country. Believing that
a convention t'hiw misconceived in ita
Hoope, and made inadequate in its pro
visions, wonld not have produced the
hearty, cordial settlement of the pendlug
questions which aloue la consistent
with the relations wmoh I iiesirato nave
established between tho United States
unci Ureal Britain, I regarded the notion
of lite Senate In rejecting tho treaty
to have boeu wisnly taken, in the
Interest of peaoe anil an h necessary
step in the dlreotlon ol a perfeot and
cordial friendship between tho two
countriefl.
A sensitive people condfclouH of their
power are more at ease under a great
wrong wholly unatoned for, limn under
the restraint of n settlement wliiuh eatleties
neither their ideas of jaBlloe nor
tholrgravo senReof thegrlevunco th??y
have sustained. The rejection of the
treaty was iollowod by a state of public
feeling on both sides which I thought
not favorablo to an Immediate attempt
at renewed negotiations. 1 accordingly
so Instructed the Minister of tho United
States to Groat Britain, and fonnd that
my views in this rogard wero shared
by Her' Majesty's Ministers. 1 hope
that tho time may soon arrive when tho
two governments can approach tho solution
of this momentous quoatlon will)
an assurance of-what is due to tbo
rights, dignity and honor of eHch, and
with the determination not only to re*
move the manses of complaint in the
Cast, bat to lay the foundation of a
road principle of public* law, whlob
will prevent future differences snd tend
to Arm and continued peacoaud friend*
ship ] This is now the only gravo question
which the United States have with
any forolgn nation. The queatlon of a
Ufctily for reciprocity betweon the United
States auil the British provinces ou this
continent has not been favorably considered
by tho admlnlHtralion. Tho advantages
of such a treaty would be
Wholly In favor of the British producor,
except possibly a few eugaged
In the trade between tho two seotloua,
no oltiaeu of .the Uultod Stales would
be benefitted by reciprocity. Our in
ternal taxation would prove a protection
for thft British producer almost
equal to tho prbtectlon which our manufacturer
now receives from the tariff.
Sotne arrangement, however, for the
regulation of commercial Interoonrae
betweeu tbo United Slates and the Dominion
of Canada may bo desirable.

It having oome to my knowledge thai

there a sub marine oablo noder a
concession from Ilia Miijeoty the Km1

French and British legations at Wash1

prohablo policy of Uongretia on the
subject, itH foreshadowed by the bill

on thulr part not to oppose the establishment
of any anoh cable. In conslderatlon
of tUla agreement 1 direct*! the
withdrawal of all opposition by the
United States authorities to the landing
of the cable and to the working of It
until the meeting of Congress. I regret
to eay that there baa been no modliloa*
Hon made in the company's oonceeslon,
nor so far an I can learn have they attempted
lo secure one. Their ooncesalons
exclude the capital and the clil/.unsofthe

of the nation against such an assumption.

Your attention la respectfully called
to tbe law regulating the tariff on

whether to tlx the charges on Kussian

On my Hamming the responsibilities
of Chief Magistrate of Hie United]

tlireo things wore essential to 11h peaoe,

First, anionic these Is strict Integrity
In fulfilling onr obligations.
Second. To secure protection to (he

PAYING OUR DWJW,
To secure the llrst of these, Congress
has taken two essential Ntepn: first, In
' declaring by Joint resolution that the
public debt should bo paid, principal
and Interest; second, by providing
I means for paying. Providing the
L means, however, could not secure the
I object desired without proper Rdmlula.j
(ration of the laws for the collection of
tlie revenue* unci sconnralnal dlnburHnroent
of them. To thl< utijeot the Administration
bu in oil earnestly aililrewed
Itself with Rood reeults, and, I
Imllevp, satisfaction to the oountry.
There baa been no hesitation tu changing
ofUolala In order to seonre eOlolont
execution of the laws; sometimes, too,
where In mere party view undesirable
political results ware likely to follow
any bssltatloo In sustaining efficient
officials sgalnst remosslranoos

A M.ART AT TINtJM OF OPTICS,
It may be well to mention hore embarrassments
possible to a rile from
leaving on the statute booka ttu.'eo-ealled
Tenure of Omoe aot, anil to earnostly

whom he baa smpenaod for reasonsT
How oan such oniolata be likely to serve

For the second requisite to our
growth and prosperity ttmo and a firm 1
but humane administration of existing 1
laws, amended from time to time aa <
they may prove Ineffective or provo 1
harsh aud unnecessary, are probably
all that are required. <

The third cannot be attained by ,
special legislation, but must bo regarded

TH? INDIANS.
From tho foundation of the Government
to tbe preseut, the management I
of the aboriginal Inhabitant* of this (
continent, bas been a subject, of em* 2
barrassment and expense, anil lias been <
attended with continuous robberies, )
murders and wars. From my own ex? 1
perlenoe upon the frontiers and in tho !
Indian countries, I do not hold either i
legislation or the oonduot of tho whites <
who come moat In contact with the 1
Indians blameless for those hos- 1
tllltlee. Tho past, however, cannot '
be undone, aud the question must be 1
inet as we find It. I have attempted a <
new policy towards these wards of the i
nation. They cannot be regarded In
any other light than as wards with fair
results so far as tried, and wbioh I hope
will bo nttouded ultimately with great
success. The society of Friends Is well
known aa having Bucoeodefefn living
in peaCe with the Indians iirthe early
settlement of Penua. while thalr whito
nuiKlibors of other sects in other hoctiou
were constantly einbrolliKi. They
are aUo known for ihelr opposition
to all strife, violence unci war, and
are generally noted for their strict Integrity
and fair dealings. These considerations
Induced tne to glvo the
management of a few reservations of
Indiaua to them, and to throw the but*
den of selection of the agents upon the
Society ltaelf. The result Laa proved
most satisfactory. It will be found
moro hilly set forth In the report of the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. For
the auperlolendenoy of Indiana not ou
reservation*, nftloors of the army were
selected. The reaaona for this are numerous.
Whore Indian agents are sent,
there, or near there, troops must be
sent also. The agenta and the oomuiandertt
of troopa are Independent of
each other, and are subject to orders
from different departments of the gov*
eminent. The army officer holds a
position for life; the agent one at the
will of the President. The former is
personally Interested iu living In harmony
with the Indian and in theestabllshntent
of a permanent peace, to the
end that Home portion of hla life may
be spent within the llmiinor civilization
The latter has no such personal intercut.
Aiiuiuwr rwHHou ih an economic one *
ami mill anothor bold whloli the Goveminent
Iihh upon the lifeofllcer lose*

out a humane policy. Tho building

matter what ought to bo tbe relatloua
between such Betilemenla and the lndlnuH,
the fact Ih thoy do not harmonize
well, and one or the other lias to give

A ayHteui which looks to tho extermination
of tho race la too horrible for a
nation to adopt without entailing upon
ItHoif tbe wrath of all obrlatondom and
engendering iu tho olllxen a disregard
for hutuan life and the rights of others
dangerous to soolety. 1 Bee no substitute
for anoh a aystem except in placing
all the Indiana on large reservations
as rapidly as can be done, and
giving them absolute proteotlon there. .
Ah soon aa they lire tilted for it ihey

DKl'ARTMKNT Olf WAR, 1
The report of the Secretary or War ,

123,8812,310 wan disbursed In tho payment
or debts aontraoted during the
war and la not chargeable to the ourrent
army expenses. The estimate or $34,531,031

Strenuous efforts have beeu made to

herefrom, leaving at its olose one hun*

i&ld to pensioners. including the corn* 8
sensation of disbursing agents, was ,
f28,422,834, nn inorease of 9-111,11)2 on J
hut or the previous year. The tnunltt* j

>ualy manifested in Its legislation for fi
,he soldiers and ssilors who surren- J
lered their llvea In the recent struggle *
;o maintain that unity of government .
whloh makes us one people. The addi- ?
ions to the pension rolls of each sue- tl
5e?nlve year, since the conolusiou of a

'rout the repeated sin ndmenta of the
