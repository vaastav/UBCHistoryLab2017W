Beaumont. Tex.. Dec. 12. Judge J. D.
Martin of the Fifty-eighth District Court
Is determined that Splndletop shall be pro
tected from Jlre. as far a3 the laws of the
State will permit. Representatives of the
Safety Committee went before Judge Mar
tin this mi .mine, and informed him that
many of the companies having wells on the
hill had refused to pay tne assessments
made against them by the committee, for
the protection of the hill. Secretary Chil
dress of the Beaumont O.l Exchange was
the spokesman of the delegation that vis
ited Judge Martin, and he Informed the
Judge that it was the desire of the com
mittee that the owners of each well be re
quired to Keep a watchman at such well.
and that it be part of the duty of such
watchman to see that no other well Is en
dangered from the one he may be watch
ing. The matter was discussed at some
length, and Judge Lipscomb of the com
muiee reid an amendment offered to the
injunction v.hich was granted to George W.
Carroll some months 00 against all com
panies on the hill. The amendment re
uuires that each comoanv owning a well
shall guard that well at all times, and
that the guards shall do such work as shall
protect surrounding property also. It fur
ther provides that If a. company prefers to
contribute to the payment of the Safety
Committer's employes, it shall be relieved
from maintaining a private watchman.
Judge JIartin announced that the Safety
Committee should not be disbanded, and
that he would make the amendment a part
cf the Injunction.

GossiP of doin2s in tte terary world. New
Australia as a field for the writer of
fiction should te fertile In local color, stir
ring Incident, and the novelty that comes
from general Ignorance as to actual condi
tions In that far-off country. Strange to
say. there have been few books written
with Australia as the scene. Perhaps this
charge can be laid against any compara
tively new country.
Edward Dyson Is perhaps best known for
hN work dealing with Australia. Hi1?
"Rhymes From the 3Iines" and "Below and
on Top" show that he confine himself to
writing about that with which he Is
acquainted. In his last bcok, "The Gold
Stealers, a Story of Wnddy," hr has not de
parted from his own b-aten track, but has
further fstablished himclf as the deplcter
of Australian characters and life.
And he has done thH so successfully In
Tho Gold Stealers" that he justilies hi
choice. There are types en this antipodal
continent that are interesting to even the
casual reader. The thoroughness with
which 3Ir. Dyson tells of their life, while
at the same time sotting forth the mest en
livening and thrilling tale. Instructs the
reader by entertaining him.
Waddy Is a small mining town In Vic
toria. The population Is cosmopolitan. If
nothing else. There Is the pure-bred Eng
lishmen, the hearty Irishman, the bro.ul
speken Scotchman, the bushranger, the
Chinaman, and the score or more other
types. Ia bringing these people Into his
GILBERT P.VRKER.
Author of "The Right of Way."
story the author has used a consummate
art that preserves the characteristics of
each nationality In its primitive form.
The book opens with an Introduction to
two of the chief characters Dick Haddon
and Joel Ham. Dick Is the hero of the ex
citing adventures that have him as the
center. He la the only son of a widowed
mother. It must be confessed that he is a
most provoking youngster for a 12-j ear
old. He is the leader of the "gang." re
sourceful, imaginative to a degree, not al
ways conforming to strict ideas of right
and wrong, but alwavs managing to keep
In the limelight of publicity.
Joel Ham is the schoolmaster of Yt'addy.
In describing the characteristics of this
most surprising Individual, the author
grows almost to tho Dickens standard.
"Hamlet," as his pupils called him. is the
smartest man In Waddy, as he should be.
So necessary is he to the mental equipment
of the place that the school trustees in hir
Irg him permit him a limited quantity of
liquor without which he is unable to pursue
his dally vocation. During school hours
he has his bottle at hand. Tho pupils see
nothing strange In the fact that he should
stop recitations long enough to refresh him
self behind the raised lid of his desk. There
is comment only at the amount that he
takes.
For many years the gold mines In Waddy
had been robbed In a, mysterious manner.
One man had been sent to the prison on
circumstantial evidence. Still the robbing
continued. And as it chanced, the dishon
est "searcher' of the mines the man who
had sent an Innocent man to prison Is
the father of the girl whom the harum
scarum Dick Haddon looked upon as little
less than a heavenly being.
Around this characteristic of every 13-year-old
boy this predilection for worship
ping some young woman the author weaves
a story that does not lag in interest at any
stage. The schemes of young Dick are
wonderful. He It i3 who has taken charge
of an abandoned mine where he directs his
playmates in digging for a "strike." The
fantastic names that he bestows upon his
comrades are worthy the imagination of
an older man but Dick is no ordinary boy.
In the course of Dick's adventures he
devises a scheme for stealing the goats of
a neighboring mining village. Au-tralia
revels in goats.. no less so than Ireland.
With a bond of five companions, ho de
scends upon the back yards- of his ene
mies In Cow Flat at midnight. With
tricks and calls, which only a boy knows,
he drives all tho goats to Waddy.
Then follows tho famous battle between
the elders of Waddy and Cow Flat. It ii
a battle royal. The blocd of the two min
ing camps Is at fever heat. From a prank
cf the boys the elders have entered into
a serious agreement to disagree. The au
thor teils of the battle on the outskirts
of Waddy with rare skilL The native
humor which is flashed in every lino of
the description of this scene Is alono worth
the writing of the book.
English authors have a habit of making
their boy heroes do most wonderful things.
Kipling. In "Stalky and Company," is per
haps an exaggeration of the English ten
dency. Xo boy ever acted as does 31r. Kip
ling's Stalky. Mr. Dyson, in one way, has
followed along the same line, but with a
greater degree of appreciation of boy char
acter. Dick Haddon Is a human creation
with characteristics common to every hap
py and Independent youth of his age.
No reader will regret the time spent In
reading "The Gold-Stealers." The unrav
eling of the plot Is done with skill, the
mystery being sustained to the end. Mr.
Dyson has reason to command the atten
tion of the public to his work in his chosen
field.

Perhaps no American 13 so distinguished
ps no American is so aisunguisneu
above vll the competitors in his profession
as Chief Arthur, of the Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Engineers. For a quarter of a
century he has been a leader of organized
labor, and during all this time he has
never lost his griff upon his organiza
tion. Compare this with the careers of
Debs, of Shaffer, even of Gompers. Beside
It, the record of every labor leader in this
country looks either trivial or a failure. It
seems extraordinary to-day that Chief Ar
thur began his career ns a "radical" amid
universal demands from conservative news
papers for his offlcial exUrpatlon. The in

never before appeared in c tenso. Is printed

The Saturday Evening Post of Philadel

which will challenge the interest of young
men and women throughout the country.
"A Home College Course," as one of them
is called, has been designed to meet the
wants of ambitious young people who have
not had the advantages of a university
training. This course wiU be conducted by
a special faculty, compesed of professors
In the leading colleges. The studies have
been most carefully chosen. Each will be
treated in an interesting way. and helpful
hints for outsido reading freely given.
"To the Young Man Beginning Business"
Is the second of these new departments. In
It the most successful men in a dozen occu
pations will write about what helped them
to the front in their own business, and
give a list of books and magazines bear
ing upon It. Their purpose will be to tell
tho beginner bow he can make himself
more valuable to his employers.
Theso new departments will begin early
In January, and will be made a permanent
feature of The Saturday Evening Post.

self into it In the most unreserved way.
When I decided to quit newspaper work, I
turned to this work, and when I began It,
I determined to write It In my own way,
without regard to models, standards or
formalism of any kind. I determined to
write something to please myself. The re
sult Is what you have. It Is mine; It Is
me. I do not say this on account of any
pride I have in the work; It is perhapi
faulty, but even the faults are mine. I
mean by this that I surrendered myself

tho idea of art simply never occurred to
me until the thing was complete."
The personal note which Mr. Harris so

with which his story will be looked for,
and it Is safe to say that the abandon
with which he has thrown himself into this
