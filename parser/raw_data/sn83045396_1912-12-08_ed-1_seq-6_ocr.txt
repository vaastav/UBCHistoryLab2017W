" The complaint of ill treatment of
'.'binose students in this country i3 one
phat is a shame to us if true. Tho
'presence of thoso students in our col

o grateful for that act of magua
uimity that she gave uotico that the
niouey so returned would be used to
send Chinese students of higb class to ,
W leading schools. And common de- i
ccucy requires fair treatment for these
students.
'Brooklyn. Times: "With tho death
of the Rev. Dr. Robert Collyor passes
one of tho most notable and picturesque
characters of modern church life. It
k merely incidental that Robert Col
lyor was cradled in Methodism, and
spent his mature yenr6 in. preaching tho
IJpitariau faith. The main thing was
tho man broad minded and generous
fouled, aifd always ns pjjnplo as a child
Ho was beloved by everybody who
knew- him. His career began as a
blacksmith, and ouded as pastor omori
tus of n great Now York church. A
self-mado man that he was, ho nover
ropudlatod tho murky atmosphere of
tho smithy whoro he dreamed dToanas.
But his lifo was a constant ocho of tho
ring, tho stability and simplicity of tho
anvil."
SOME NATIONAL INTERESTS.
President Taft, in his latest message
to Congress, points out that we aro Hko
ly to face a treasury deficit for tho cur
rent fiscal year, which ends Juno 30th
next, and also for the succeeding fiscal
year. But there is ample money avail
able to meet any oxpoctod deficit; and
on tho wholo the condition of tho treas
ury is satisfactorj'.
The President makes a hopeless rec
ommendation when ho asks that tho
banking and currency system proposed
by tho Aldrich commission should bo
approved by Congress and tho necessary
legislation enacted to carry it into ef
fect. That is somothing that Congress
will never do, becauso tho schomo has
so many radical dofeots that its advo
cacy is hopeless.
Vory naturally tho President declinos
to make any recommendation with re
spoct to revising tho tariff, cither as a
whole, or schedule by schedule aa lie has
recommended hcrotofore. -Sinco the vot
ers of tho United States expressed an
emphatic purpose at tho, recent election,
to havo the tariff revised on lines other
than protective, and took tho matter
ontiroly out of tho hando of the Repub
lican party, and expressed themsolvos as
hostile to protection, the President de
clines to recommend furthor on thin
quostion. The wholo matter will bo
treated by the succeeding administra
tion in the light of tho eloction and of
tho verdict of tho pooplo. This is tho
common-senso, practical way to look at
tho matter, and tho President thu3 at
onoo does tho right thing and relieves
hlmsolf of a great deal of trouble and
responsibility.
As to tho navy, the Prosidcnt recom
mends that tho programmo of two bat
tleships a year, with tho corresponding
auxiliary cruisers and vessels, bo persist
ed in, and sinoo but ono battleship was
authorized last year, he rocommonds
that tho prosont Congress mako up tho
deficioncy by recommending thrco of the
highest class battleships. W0 beliovo
that tho country at large will approve
this recommendation, and trust that
Congress may relent and follow tho
President's lead.
With rospeot to the Philippines, the
President points out that to promise a
recognition' of tho indopendonce of tho
archipelago and agrco to turn its gov
ernment over to the nativos at the ex
piration of eight ycara, or any other
soou-comincr given time, would be pre
mature. Wo do not bcliove that- tho
Democratic party will on a test vote
make itself responsible for,.;lho lack, of
vigor and tho lowering of our prestige
that would appear upon the carrying out
of the anti-Imperialist programme for
turning over the Philippines to tho "Fili
pinos. Tt would bo a shame to na to do
this, since it is abundantly evident that
the natives there arc not well enough
advanced nor united enough to assumo
national responsibility.
Tho President commits himself fairly
and fully to tho now system of handling
nnvigablo waters through dams and con
sequent slack water navigation which
they create By a succession of dams
and deep backwaters the rivers of this
country could be made immensely moro
serviceable to navigation than they
have over been, and tho President is so
fully convinced of this that ho recom
mends that as a national policy in deal
ing with our navigablo streams.
The President directs atlontion to the
Panama Canal legislation of tho special
session of Congress, and his proclama
tion in accordance therewith. He speaks
of tho protest which the British gov
ernment has given notice of, and says
that when that is received it will bo
promptly considered "and an offort
made to reach a satisfactory adjust
ment of any differences there may bo
between tho two governments." In
connoction with the Panama Canal, tho
President recommends that Colonel
Goethals, tho executive head of that
gTeat work, be promoted to bo a Major
General In tho rogular army, "and that
tho law authorizing such appointment
bo accompanied with a provision per
mitting his designation as chief of en
gineers upon the retirement of tho pres
eut incumbent of that office." That is
good so far as it goes, but something
more permanent and satisfactory than
that ought to be provided for Colonel
Goethals. Tho distinguished service
that he has rondered at Panama puts
him in a class by himself, and it would
bo entirely fitting to provido that in
case of his promotion there should be
no compulsory retirement for him at the
ago of sixty-four or any other ago, but
that ho should romain on full pay and
on tho activo liBt of the army a3 long as
he lives, or until ho himself wishes to
retire.
Tho Prcsidont reviews the work of
the Department of. Justice, and praises
its nctivitios in the enforcement of the
law and especially in tho prosecution of
trusts. H0 hopes for tho most valuable
results to come from this activity.
With regard to tho reform of court
proccduro by inakine litigation less
j costly and moro speedy, tho President
j calls attention vrith satisfaction to the
order of tho U. S. Supremo Court radi
cally altering tho equity rules as to pro
cedure in th0 Pcdernl courts, and he
expresses a desiro to see thiB reform
pushed also into the law side of courts.
Tho President recommends that the
workmen's compensation act, reported
by tho special commission appointed by
Congress and tho executive, which
passed the Sonato aud is now pending in
the House, be concurred in by the lower
branfli 0f f'ongross Hp thinks that op
position to this law grows out of tho
misapprehonsion of its effect rather than
opposition to its principles.
Tho recommendations mado by the
President as a wholo aro excellent, and
CongreaB could do no bettor sorvice to
the country than to give offcot to all of
them by legislation.
REPUBLICAN REORGANIZATION.
Tho reorganization of tbo Ropublican
party is attracting tho attention of
politicians, now that so many public
men and party leaders havo assembled
in Washington. Tho gonoral under
standing eooms to bo that tho party
will havo to be reorganized, and that
this reorganization must bo upon pro
gressive lines. Of course, tho head
ship of Colonel Roosevolt for this re
organization is out of tho question,
sinco ho has not only left tho party,
but has denounced it furiously and bo
yond rotraction; but that tho reorgani
zation will bo along safe and advanced
lines, laid down cautiously and with
out radicalism, (hero sooms to bo little
doubt.
Tho fact that not ono of tho Pro
gressive Senators or Representatives in
Congress has asked to havo his politi
cal affiliations changed from Republi
can to Progressive in tho make-up of
tho Congressional Direetory, but that
all are hold to bo Republicans, and
this by thoir own procurement, is proof
that tho Republican split is in good
progress of being inendod. But it will
not bo mondod by tho Bovoridges, tho
Plnchoto, and others who desortod tho
Ropublican party and who organized a
now party of thoir own undor tho lead
ership of Colonel Roosevolt; but, aa ex
pressed by tho San Prancisco Argonaut,
tho leadership of tho party will bo in
the hands of men who havo hitherto
boou mombcr3 of tho progrossivo soc
tion of tho party, but who "did not
in tho lato campaign abaudon tho xarty
to follow tho Bull Mooso." Such men
as Borah, La Pollotto, Cummins, Kou-
yon, Hadloy, Clapp, and othoro of tho
Progressive leaders will be tho moving
spirits in tho new, roorganizod Repub
lican party. Thoso men refused to
leave tho party; they stayed with it,
with tho avowed object of lifting it out
of tho slandpat rut into which bo many
of the loss intolligont aud reckless of
tho old leadership led it and kept it.
Ropublican reorganization appears to
bo certain, as it ought to bo cortain;
but the old standpat olomont will no
longer bo in control, for that cloment
cannot bo trusted. 3t Jias been tried
and found wnnting. It wrecked- the
party, and will havo no claim what
ever for party leadership in tho roor-gauisation;
DEATH OF J. W. HOUSTON.
Tho death of Mr. J. W. Houston will
strike this community with a shock of
Biirpriso, and its sympathy will go out
thereupon in a warm degree. . Mr.
Houston has boon a prominent, business
man in this city for tho past twenty
thrco 3'cars. His voice has always been
for progress and improvement, and for
tho industrial and commercial develop
ment of all this region. Ho has been
extremely activo, devoting all of his
timo and attention to tho upbuilding
of tho city and its surroundings. Ho
has been untiring in tho good work,
and has spared neither timo nor money
iu pushing this city to tho front and
making it tho groat commercial metro
polis of tho wh.olo basin and mountain
country.
Mr. Houston canto hero from Texas,
whore ho bore an honored name, and
he was- gladly received hero and aided
by progressive citizons in pushing on
tho good work which ho had in baud
and which ho originated. Ho has been
ill for a long timo, but no ono supposed
until tho last few days that his end was
near. In his doparturo tho city loses
an energetic and enthusiastic citizen,
and will mourn his loss accordingly. To
his immodioto rolatives and friends The
Tribune tenders in bohalf of tho whole
community a universal sympathy, and
sorrows with thorn in their great losa. j
RAILWAY MAIL PAY.
The mail-carrying railroads are mak
iug a strenuous offort to havo tho pay
for their postal service advanced be
yond the prosont figures. A committee
of railwaj' mail carriers, representing
214,275 miles of railway in tho United
States, has issued a brief showing tho
insufficiency of tho present pay. We
have a copy of that brief, and it really
seemg. to bo conclusive on tho point.
Still, thero is a measure of relief that
might satisfy tho railroads without ma
terially disturbing tho present rates of
pay. The facts and figures proseuted in
tho report referred to arc all based upon
tho tonnago of mail as now carried, but
this tonnago could bo largely Toduccd
by limiting tho frauking privileges of
Congressmen and officials in Washing
ton. It was shown that during tho lat
ter part of tho last fiscal year, ending
Juno 30, 1912, there were thousands of
tons of political campaign matter
franked from Washington, loading
down tho mails beyond all reason, at an
enormous expense to tho government,
forcing a deficit in tho Postoflico De
partment, and requiring the railroads
to provido enormous and unusual facil
ities for carrying th0 mails, these facili
ties being provided at a loss to tho rail
roads. Undoubtedly the portion of the
prosont fiscal year beginning July 1st
and ending with October, four months,
showed even a greater amount of polit
ical campaign matter franked through
the mails than tho volume sent in tho
closing months of tbo previous fiscal
yoar. It will bo remembered that -Congress
was in session a larro portion of
tho time, from July 1st onward, and
that both parties were extremely activo
in flooding tho country with franked
matter during tho Presidential cam
paign, Now, if that sort of thing could bo
slopped, and the frnnkini: prhilogo lim
itod to letters And reasonable communi
cations, without loading up tho malls
with thousands of tons of useloss re
ports and moro partisan stuff, all car
ried froo under official franks, then tho
Postoffico Dopartmont could be easily
roliovod of its deficit, and tho imposi
tion upon railroads vory much light
ened. But undor tho prosent franking
system which it is an imposition upon
all concerned, tho railroadti havo just
complaint; and ou0 thing or the other
should bo dono for the railroads; eithor
tho bulk of franked stuff should bo cut
down, or tho pay for carrying tho mail
should be inercasod.
BUSINESS AND TRADE.
The coming of real winter weather
during tho past week has stimulated
general business. Tho banking clear
ances in this city show a gain of 1-1.3
por cent ovor tho clearances of tho
corresponding week last year, which
is a substantial increase.
Tho merchants report that holiday
shopping lias bogun on a largo scale,
and that tho early shopping movement
is resulting more successfully this yoar
than heretofore. Tho Keith-O'Brion
Company oponed on Monday in its new
storo comer of Stato and Broadway
and enjoyed a splendid wook's trade
in tho new rotnil center. All storos
report increased trade, and auticipato
a heavy business for tho rest of the
year. Christmas departments show
largo holiday stocks on display. Cash
sales have been heavy during. the wook,
and collections improved in porcentago,
indicating a healthy condition.
Tho bids for tho constructiou of tho
new Stato capitol woro oponod during
tho wook, aud will bo awarded at as
early a day as practicable. Generally
speaking, the building year has about
como ty a close, oxeopt; for tho com
pletion of work already in band. The
Walker ekyocraper is about finished,
aud tho bank is being movod acros3 tho
street and will bo open in itq now
11 il3 UY
quarters to-morrow morning.
Tho improvements iu hand by the
Denver & Ri0 Grando at Soldier Sum
mit and other points in Utah aro bo
ing pushed with such celerity as is
possible
Puuds aro boing rapidly raised in
Deuvor for the completion of tho Mof
fat road by putting tho tuunol through
tho Continental Divido for tho uso of
that compauy and other companies that
may find it practical for thorn. A con
tract wag lot during the week for the
oxtension of this road fifty miles this
way from Steamboat Springs.
Tho dissolution by tho U. S. Supreme
Court during tho week of tho Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific merger
was generally anticipated so far aa it
went, and there will bo practically
no difference in the public relations
to either or both roads. Tho Harri
inan operating and traffic officials con
ferred in Salt Lake City on Thursday
and Friday on freight and passenger
schedules. :
Tho stock markets have afforded the
principal material for discussion in
mining circles during tho past week,
and thero has been a docided down
ward tendency in practical all tho
industrial issues as a rosult, it is bo
licved, of tho expected tariff revision
policy of tho now administration. Tho
wholo market towards tho closo of the
wock reflected this condition, tho cop
per issues especially suffered from tho
execssivo liquidation, tight money and
general timidity of investors and bank
ing circlos. The good bank statement
had tho effect to stem the tide slight
ly on Saturday, and while tho closo
was somewhat firmer, stock market
conditions still aro unsettled.
It is anticipated that this rather
drastic liquidation and short activity
will be followed by a roaction upward
during tho now week; but the better
informed authorities aro discouraging
any extensive committments on tho
long side, and uniformly agrco in
taking profits on all strong spots for
tho timo boing.
Tho local mining share market is
holding its strength and activity very
well, public buying not being confined
entirely to tho higher priced, dividend- r
paying issues as at first, but tho lower j
priced speculative issues havo como in
for a generous sharo of attention, j
nolida' dividends havo been declared I
during the past few days by the Silver
King Coalition Mine company, for
twenty-fivo conts a sharo, and by the S
Daly Judge company, tho latter com- C
pany declaring fiftcon cents extra in
addition to the regular quarterly (lis- gj
bursement, and there arc sovcral other j
companies which are cxpocted to take
similar action beforo tho holiday sea-
son. The high prices of metals dur- E
iug tho year havo enabled the Utah j
producer to reap very largo profits. j
Tho local mining conditions aro very
good, although the scarcity of labor is j
boing felt and the development of new ,
properties is being hold back by scv-
oral adverse causes. i
All metals except lead are holding j
satisfactory market ranges, lead suffer- 9
ing entirely from tho possibility of '
tariff revision. Speller is being held
ip splendidly, also silver, whilo cop- !
per holds its high raugc without a sin- g
glo indication of weakness. 3
The general conimerical Toports say j
that trade still displaj's great vigor, j
aud that orders for futuro delivery con- 1
tiuue on an extensive scale, while I
holiday distribution probably exceeds j
that of any previous season. J
In tho dry goods lino scarcity of !
various makes is noteworthy, and whilo J
tho demand shows no appreciable let- W
up, there is a tendency to discourago H
buyers from rushing in and bidding I
up on a markot that is cloarly short
of supplies. a
In iron and Bteol, pig iron is loss
active, aud bujng of Btcol has S
abated somewhat, but that industry I
is so well filled up with orders, some jg
companies being bookod for tho first
half of noxt' year and others for a
longor period, that a lull will havo no
effoct. Collections aro good.
Tho cotton goods markot continues
strong, but conservatism is growing bo
causo of high prices, and buying at
first hand is less active. Jobbers re
port a fair trado for tho season, with
good demand for many domostic
staples.
The Boston wool markot showo mod
erate movement, with values general
ly maintained on n firm basis, but with
scoured wool slightly lower aud special
sales at shaded prices on certain groasc
wools. Thero is no approhonsion, how
ever, in the minds of any of thoso iu
tho trado as to tho futuro vnluo of
wool. On tho contrary, every indica
tion is boliovcd to point to higher
wool values, and that in the near fu
ture. Tho stock markot shows its ups and
downs, without much regard to tho gen
eral strength of the business situation
in tho country.
Gold imports iu considerable quantity
havo bogun from Europe. On Satur
day of last week Nov York secured
$4,000,000 out of .$5,000,000 of. South
African gold In tho opon market, and
on Monday New York obtained most
of tho gold offered in tho open markot
in London, somo $5,000,000. Tho con
ditions aro such as to favor imports of
gold in considerable quantities.
Tho yoar is closing on brisk busi
ness and active industry and trado in
ovcry direction, and doubtless, if uot
altogothcr tho record, tho Gumming up
of tho year will press very closo to
tbo top notch.
TAPT AND THE SUPREME COURT.
Tho question of utilizing our fomior
Presidents iK fairly solved ho far as
our only liviug ox-l5rcsident. is con
cornod. Colonel Roosevelt is talcing
caro of himself, and io managing to
fill a largo portion of f.ho public notico
in a way peculiarly his own, and cer
tainly immensely pTofitablo to himsolf.
And if tho kindly expressions of a
largo number of Democratic newspapers
count for anything, Prcsidont Taft is
likely upon his retirement from office,
if a vacancy occurs in tho Supremo
Court of tho United States,' to bo well
provided for by -appointment to that
great tribunal.
Tt is pointed out that President Taft
has been absolutely non-partisan, and
has wholly ignored not only party lines
but geographical conditions, in- his Up
pointments to tho Supremo Court. Pivo
of tho members of that court, being a
clear majority, aro of his appolntmont,
and Chief Justico White, a Southern
Democrat, was mado Chief Justico by
appointment of Prcsidont Tnft. If thero
should bo a vacancy in tho court dur
ing President Wilson's term, it looks
now as though thero would bo a unani
mous popular demand which President
Wilson would bo quito likoly to acccod
to, for tho appointment of President
Taft to whatever vacancy might arise
in that court.
MORE ON EX-PRESIDENTS.
The quostion of caring for cx-Presidents-
has como to tho front more
strongly than cvor sinco tho meeting
of Congress. Mr. Carnegio'a proposi
tion to pension tho ox-Prosidonts is
universally condomnod, but his proposi
tion served tho purposo of bringing
tho need of doiug something for our
ex-Presidents beforo tho country in a
positive uud direct form. It is gcnnraUy.
concodod that it is beneath tho dignity
of this country to allow a man who
has beoa its ohiof oxecutivo to go out
and enter into tho struggle of broad
winning at an ago when ho would bo
so sovoroly handicapped. And yot, tho
problem is what form tho troatment
of ox-Prosidents ought to tako to be
both dignified, and worthy of tbo sclf
respect of tho republic.
Representative Burleson ..of. Texasi
proposos to pay ox-P residents a sal
ary of $17,000 a yoar aud to givo them
what amounts to a Delogateship in tho
House of RoprcBo'ntativcs; that is, talk
ing privilege but no vote.
Another plan is to make tho ox-Prcsi-dents
Sonators for life, with both de
bating and voting po'wor.
Both, of theso plans, however, seem
to dqrogato from tho dignity of tho
Presidential officoj for noithor quito
mcamii on up to tha standard of what
ought to bo tho official function of an
ex-President, providod ho has any of
ficial function at all.
Sonator McCumbor proposes to tc
tiro the ox-Presidents oh commnndcrs-in-chiof
of tho army, at a salary of
$10,000 a yoar. But as tho command
of tho army by tho President is merely
ex officio and riot actual, thoro would
bo inconsistencies in this, aud also an
assumption of military compotenco,
which most Presidents woulajRt
tiroly unablo to justify. BRfl
On tho wholo, wo have seen 'Bli
gc3tion for dealing with ex-Ir(P
thnt is quito as satisfactory a9
posnl mado in thoso columns so dBfr
ago, to mako thorn National niBl''
ora, similar to the "Elder StatSMf
of Japan, and having thoia ox'Sfl
Cabinet Ministers, attending tMl
sions of tho Cabinot and givt

general, and with tho practical 91
ness obtained from oxperionce. m
TARIFF REVISION MrjSl
It is curious to seo tho anxi0nj"Sf
of Speaker Clark, and Mr. Br-fl
got at tariff revision, ia 3pi(0R
far.t that President-elect "VilJBi
declared that he would not favdBI
.sudden or drastic action with rJBr
the tariff. B
Another reason why thero 8hoTB
no great stress about tli0 taiiffjK
now, is that, the preseut CounJBi
not likely to havo timo to deaiSBV
Tho short session, will bcgjn a(aHt
day, and) must end with tho aifrl'l
March, or' at tho latest at &nr
the 4th. Tho trcEs of thsp
priatlon bills and of tho IcriJHj
which Is urgently demanded
vent tho wasting of any tha4 K
tariff mcamircs; for it Is a foreTa-1
elusion that any DemocraUc twP
of tho tariff, even if tho PropB
in the Senato would help tho '"
crats thoro to pass House mK
would be vetoed by PrcsideatBi
Tho President made this plain 'biff
vetoes of tho Democratic tariff ,9;
urcs at. tho special session.
So wo Imngino that thoro wlll'M
11 q timo epeut in an effort to tB'
