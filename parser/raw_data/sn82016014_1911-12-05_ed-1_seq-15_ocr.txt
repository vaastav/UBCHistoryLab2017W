"When we take Berger and McKen

"one is shackled to myself, while the

a guard,
n this manner I do not consider that
there is any danger of escape. At any
rate, I am" responsible and have no
fears.
"I allow the prisoners in my charge
these liberties because 1 recognize that
they are human and should be accord

the congress was addressed to Isham
Randolph, a waterway engineer, and is
as follows:
"I have your letter of November 2 0.
Though I shall have to be in Wash
ington at the time the 19th national
irrigation congress is in session in Chi
cago, I am very glad to take this means I
of assuring the friends of irrigation
of my continued interest in the subject
and my belief in the importance of go
ing forward without a halt in the work
of bringing under cultivation and j
making habitable by .man the arid re
gions of the United States. I am
strongly in sympathy with the general
purpose of the irrigation congress and
earnestly hope that its session this year
may be fruitful of great good for the
cause of irrigation.
'With cordial greetings to the dele
gates who will be assembled, believe
me, sinoerely yours,
"WILLIAM H. TAFT."
STUBBS IS SILENT
Governor Says He Hasn't Made l'p
Mind About Special Session.
Governor Stubbs was asked point
blank today if he would call a special
session of the lecismture nnrl bo r.
i plied that he had not yet made up his
I
mind in the matter. He was informed
that it had been reported that he had
decided to issue the call for the special
session about December 15. His reply!
was characteristic. "This is the first
I have heard of it," he said.
But it is the general opinion that a I
special session will be called this win
ter. The idea is to pass a presidential
primary law in the hope of taking the
state away from Taft. The progres
sives, many or mem, view the move
with doubt and distrust. But, strange
to relate, the regulars, who are sup
posed to be for Taft and therefore I
against a special session, are delighted
with the idea. Regular members of
the legislature look and act like men
who carried spades and were making!
ready to dig a grave. One of these
is getting ready to come clear back
here from California to help at the
last obsequies. They promise a forty-
day session, lots of fighting and more
expense and little done and then the
failing of a political star. "It would
be worth all the trouble and expense,
said a member of the legislature today.
HE BEAT HIMSELF.
Hyde's Lawyers Oppose Introduction
of His Former Testimony.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 5. Whether
Dr. B. Clarke Hyde, charged with mur
dering Colonel Thomas H. Swope, will
take the stand in his own behalf at
this trial of the case was the absorbing
topic of comment at the hearing to
day. A vigorous protest of the defense
yesterday against the introduction of
testimony given by the physician at the
former trial brought up the discussion.
Attorneys for Dr. Hyde refuse to say
w hether he will stand by his constitu
tional rights and refuse to testify.
It is said on good authority that Dr.
Hyue testified at his first trial against
the wishes of his counsel. He was not
permitted to take the stand until after
his attorneys had tried -in vain in a
conference that lasted practically
throughout one night to dissuade him
from his course. Jurors said after the
former hearing that the accused phy
sician convicted himself by his de
meanor on the stand. He was very
nervous and it was generally thought
he failed in his effort to explain his
cyanide purchases.
Miss Elizabeth Gordon, a nurse, was
on the stand when court convened to
day. She occupied the chair practi
cally all day.
NOW IT'S MALT CREEK.
Four Carloads of Beer Poured Into
Cow Creek Today.
Pittsburg, Kan., Dec. 5. Under the
direction of W. E. Montgomery, as
sistant attorney general of Kansas,
four carloads of beer were destroyed
here today. The liquar represented
the confiscation from illegal selling
places during the last three months. A
crowd gathered in a pasture north of
the city to watch the pouring of the
liquor into Cow creek.

at Cary. 111., September ., last, in jail
here; his brother-in-law who aleo had
admitted his part in the crime locked
up with him and one other man, who
is implicated by the confessions of these
two under lock and key nearby. States
Attorney David R. Joslyn of McHenry
country laid his plans to arrest three
men who are still at liberty but whose
names are known.
According to the confessions, there
were originally seven men in the gang
when Wennerstrom was murdered, but
one of rhese was slain by his bandit
friends a few days later in a quarrel
over the division of money taken in
safeblowing expeditions.
Forrest Knapp Of Battle Creek, Mich.,
ie the man who has confessed that he
killed Wennerstrom. David Mawhood,
a patroled convict and a brother-in-law
of Knapp, has admitted he helped
weight the body and throw it into Fox
river. Edward Allen, a cousin of
Mawhood. who was drawn into the case
by the confession, is locked up at Wood
stock, 111.
George Birch, John Lynch and James
Menzer, all of Coldwater, Mich., are the
other three sought and the scene of
activity in the case shifted to that
town today. Detectives Van Natta and
O'Sullivan of the Chicago detective
bureau, have gone to Coldwater and
they expect to arrest the three today.
Frank Hunter is the member of the
gang who was slain. According to
States Attorney Joslyn his body was
weighted and thrown into Lake Michi
gan after he had died in a shack near
Hammond, Ind. He was taken there
by two members of the gang who shot
him two days after the murder of Wen
nerstrom. He lived only three days and
after disposing of the body the bandits
resumed horse stealing in McHenry
county. According to the confession of
Knapp Wennerstrom was murdered
when he refused to drive the thugs to
Madison. Wis., where they intended en
gaging in horse stealing.
COSTS A BIG SUM.
For ITncle Sam to Take Private Land
for Public Use.
Washington, Dec. 5. Holding that it
would be shocking to every principle of
law and justice to maintain the doctrine
that lands can be invaded and taken to
change stream flows without compen
sating the owner the United States court
of claims gave judgment for $47,000 in
favor of George F. Archer and Kate C.
Archer in their claim against the United
States.
The government took about 31 acres of
land of the plaintiffs situated along the
Mississippi river and by the construction
of a dike caused a sediment to render
unfit for use approximately 2,300 acres.

Des Moines, Dec. 5. Omaha and
Des Moines teams were scheduled to
day to make an attempt to beat the
high score of the middle west bowl
ing tournament of 2,770, now held by
the Old Lynch Ryes of St. Louis. With

ONLY ONE WEEK
Christmas Vacation of Schools Will Be
Shorter.
All hope that the school children
might have entertained that they
would enjoy a two weeks' Christmas
vacation is chilled by the action taken
by the board of education Monday
night at the regular December meet
ing, deciding that the vacation shall
begin December 2 2 and extend to
January 2.
The opening date of school was
put off until after the state fair was
a thing of the past, and it was the
general understanding among the
board members at the time that if
the opening date were put off a week
the vacation at Christmas time would
necessarily have to be limited to one
week.
Mrs. Margaret Hill McCarter took
a decided stand in favor of allowing
the full two weeks' vacation time,
but Superintendent Starr felt that an
other week off would interfere with
the proper completion of the courses',
so the motion prevailed.
According to the report of the treas
urer, J. M. Wright, the outstanding
warrants total $87,447.94 -$32,208.31
in the general fund and $55,239.63 in
the building fund. December 1 there
was S7.570.9S in the treasury, which
would offset some of this indebtedness.
It will be possible to pay off a por
tion of the warrants by the first of the
year, when some of the 1911 tax money
will be available.
The bills for November aggregated
$29,263.15, of which amount $23,153.36
went to pay the salaries of teachers,
officers and janitors. One item was
$1,801.25 for taxes assessed particu
larly for improvements in the way of
paving adjacent to school property.
The water bill for the year was
$777.40. Through the recent towel
edict of Dr. S. J. Crumbine it was
necessary to expend $12.50 for paper
towels
Dr. C. B. Van Horn stated that he
understood that for 14 years the board
has been trying to have presented to
the individual members each month
by the treasurer a statement of the
financial standing of the board made
out in such a manner as to be easily
understood by individuals who do not
pretend to be expert accountants. The
board decided to request the treasurer
to make out such a statement.
The addition to the State street school
has not been satisfactorily completed in
the estimation of the board. Conse
quently the last estimate presented by
the contractors, Moore & Vickland, was
held up by the board. M. E. Moore
appeared before the board for the pur
pose of showing that he had comple
ted the w-ork strictly according to plans
and specifications. He laid the blame
entirely on L. M. Wood, the architect,
whose plans he insinuated were not
what they should have been.
"Things went on at that building,"
said he, "that shouldn't have gone
on."
"What, for instance?" asked a
board member.
"Your heating system isn't com
plete. Tour superintendent, Allen,
was there twice a day. He should
have been there all of the time."
The question - was turned over to
the building committee with power to
act.
