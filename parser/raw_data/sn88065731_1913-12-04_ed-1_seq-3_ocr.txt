this is so. Misrepresentations make
people skeptics. Now-a-days the
public ask for better evidence than
the testimony of strangers. Here
is proof which should convince ev

over the kidney secretions. I tried
everything in this ease that I thou

little success, until Doan’s Kidney
Pills were used. They acted like
magic, and in three weeks brought
a cure.”
During a personal interview on
March 12, 1912, Mrs. Frazier said:
"The praise 1 gave Doan’s Kidney
Pills a Tear ago, holds good. The
’cure they made in my child’s case
has been permanent."

Democratic Party Made Legislative
Reform a Campaign Issue.
. >. ‘ I
The action of the Democratic
t party in placing in its State plat- \
form a plank declaring strongly for
legislative reform, has removed the
struggle for this reform from indi
viduals and made It a party mea
- sore.
‘ Senator J. Frank Harper,of Queen
Anne’s county, who led the “econo
my fight" in the Senate two
years ago, which resulted in re
ducing the total expenses of that
body more than $21,000, or con
siderably over 26 per cent., as com
pared with the session of 1910, is
strongly urging that reform in.
legislative procedure and methods
lie-taken up by the Democratic par
ty ae a party measure.
He says that he is willing to con
tinue his efforts individually, but
inasmuch as the party has a plank
in ita platform declaring in general
. terms for legislative reform.,. .he
thinks the wise thing would be ac
tion by the party caucus sufficient
ly broad to meet all the ‘demand®
of the situation.
Senator Harper thinks the move
ment for reform in procedure should
• be along the lines advocated. v by .
United States Senator-elect Blair
Lee and embodied in what is known
a* the “Lee plen.” ‘This provides
that committees shall be named by
a committee or committees, Instead
of by the presiding officers, as at

mßtees may require the chairman!

that the votes of individual mem

PREDICTS WAR
WITH MEXICO
Congress Mann Beieves It is
Inevitable.
PREPARING FOR TROUBLE
Juse Passes Bill Authorizing Presi-
to Raise Volunteers In “Time
-‘of Actual or Threatened War.”
Washington, De;. 4. James R.
Maun, the Republican leader of the
house, declared iu tae course of de
bate that war be. ween the United
States and Mexico is iuev.table and
that the president is making arrange
ments accoidingly.
The fact that the Democrats allowed
this statement to go unchallenged has
added to its significance. Mr. Mann’s
prophecy of war with Mexico came as
a surprise and created a deep impres
sion in the house. It added to the im
portance of a bill called up by Repre
sentative Hay, of Virginia, and later
passed, authorizing the president to
raise volun esr forces “in time of act
ual or threatened war.”
Mr. Mann said solemnly that the Hay
bill was part of the plan of the gov
ernment to get itself in readiness lor
war with Mexico. From the moment
that Mr. Mann took part in the debate
interest in the proceedings were enliv
ened and the “voluntary army” bill
was passed by a unanimous vote.
Predicting war with Mexico, Mr.
Mann said; "1 should greatly regret
such a war. I do no, see any escape
from chaos and anarch, in Mexico un
der the plan which we are now pursu
ing. Of course, if that runs very long
it means war.”
Mr. Maun told of the situation that
obtained in congress just before the
war with Spain and suggested that
the appearance of the Hay bill on the
day following President Wilson’s pub
lic discussion of the Mexican situa
tion in his me sage was significant.
The Hay bill, which provides lor a
voluntary. army to be raised in the
discretion of the president, now goes
to the senate. It was said that body
will take - immediate action upon the
measure.
Color is given to the statement of
Mr. Mann that the administration is
preparing for trouble by the haste that
marked the passage of the Hay bill.
The measure was ordered reported at
a special meeting of the military af
fairs committee on Tuesday and given
the right of way in the house imme
diately after the transaction of some
routine business.
Further evidence in support of Mr.
Mann’s belief that the administration
is preparing for trouble was found in
an annouheement made by Democratic
leaders that early next week the house
will pass the naval military bill. This
bill proposes to enlarge and render
the naval militia more efficient, plac
ing it >on a foundation somewhat simi
lar to that upon the land militia rests.
I That la, the naval military will be pro
vided with more me nand more ade
quate equipment.

27 BURNED IN
LODGING HOUSE
Many Leap to Street When Fire
Drives Them to Windows.
Boston, Dec. 4, —Twenty-seven per
sons were burned to death in a fire
which destroyed the Arcadia lodging
house at 1202 Washington street, this
being the heaviest death toll ever re
corded in a fire in Boston.
Two persons were fatally injured
and more than a score were slightly
hurt or overcome by smoke.
There were 179 men asleep in the
lodging house when the fire started
The flames spread swiftly through the
flimsy building and several men caught
on the upper floors leaped from the
windows.
All of the victims were poverty
stricken men, the lodging house being
a 15-cents-a night affair. Many of them
were homeless wanderers, and for this
reason the authorities believe that the
names of all the victims will never be
learned.
The coniagration was attended by
many thrilling escapes. The firemen
spread nets, and into these many ol
the panic-sfricken lodgers leaped. One
man wrapped a mattress around his
body and jumped from the fifth floor,
the mattress saving his life.
Patrolmen lined along the fire es
capes were forced to beat the fugitives
with their clubs to start them on their
way to the street and clear the Are
eSftapes 'to makfe~rosnrTtJr "othfiVa ftSW-
Ing from the building.
The patrolmen stuck to their task
until the flames burst from all the
upper windows and forced them to
abandon their position.
The streets for blocks in three di
rections were scenes of the wildest
excitement while the fire was in pro
gress. The dead, dying and injured
were distributed about the sidewalks
while the first arrivals were striving
to rescue others from the ames.

Grand Haven, Mich., Dec. 4. —Hazel
Paine, seventeen years old, who was
found bound hand and foot on the

here, is rapdly recovering, and the po
lice say she will soon be able to assist
them in seeking the guilty person or
persons.
Although a man was taken into cus
tody In connection with the case no
warrant has been sworn out against
him. He asserts that he was never

he will have no difficulty In clearing
himself.

ed by all the Spanish newspapers.
Only vague impressions of the actual
contents of the message were con
veyed by the brief extracts published.
The general conclusion was that Pres
ident Wilson intends to keep his
hands off and to leave Provisional
President Huerta to the mercy of Ms
enemies.
The news that General Mercado,
commander of the Federal forces in
northern Mexico, had sent a military
peace commission from Chihuahua to
Juarez to treat with the rebels, while
vigorously denied in official circles.
Is regarded as the most serious blow
yet struck at Federal prestige.
In view of Provisional President
Huerta’s statements that he never
would treat with the rebels, it Is con
sidered impossible that the peace com
mission has been sanctioned by Mm.
At the same time, however, it is point
ed out that the appointment of the
commission is in line with the recent
suggestion made by Dr. Aureliano Ur
rutla, when at the head of the minis
try of the interior, that overtures
might be made to the rebels without
governmental sanction.

ner in the City of Mexico, Pancho
Villa left Juarez for Chihuahua City,
accompanied by three train loads of
rebel cavalry and artillery and pre
ceded by 3500 other rebel troops en
trained during the past week.
General Villa was calm and not a
bit boastful. He aided his men to
load their horses and war munitions
and munched a sandwich when he got
hungry. As the last train was ready
to leave he swung on and stood bow
ing from the rear platform of his
train.
General Villa, known as the bandit
of bloodthristy habits, who has boast
ed of his executions of Federals. is
becoming magnanimous. The messen
ger who brought him an invitation
from the people of Chihuahua to come
to the state capital, asked mercy for
the 200 Federal soldiers left by Gen*

in the city. Villa sent word that not a
hair on their heads would tie harmed.
