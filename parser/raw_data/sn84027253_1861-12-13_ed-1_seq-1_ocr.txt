The several arms of the service are estima
ted as follows:
Yolunteers. Regulars. Aggregate.
It has become a grave question lor deter
minaton, what shall be done with the slaves
abondoned by their owners on the advance of
our trocps into the Southern territory, as in
the Beaufort district of South Carolina. The
whole white population therein is six thous
and, while the number of negroes exceeds
thirty-two thousand. The panic which drove
their masters in wild confusion from their
homes, leaves them in undisputed possession
of the soil. Shall they, armed by their mas
ters, be placed in the field to fight against us,
or shall their labors be continually employed
is reproducing the means for supporting the
SCmies of the rebellion
The war into which this government has
been forced by rebellious traitors, is carried
on for the purpose of repossessing the prop
erty violently and treacherously seized upon
by the enemies of the Government, and to re
establish the authority and laws of the Uni
ted States in places where it is opposed or
overthrown by armed insurrection and re
bellion. Its purpose is to recover and de
fend what is justly its own.
War, even between independent nations, is
made to subdue the enemy, and all that be
long to that enemy, by occupying the hostile
country, and exercising dominion over all the
men and things within its territory. This
being true in respect to independent nations
at war with each other, it follows that rebels
who are laboring by force of arms to over
throw a government, justly bring upon them
selves all the consequences of war, and pro
voke ie destruction merited by the worst of
crimcs. That Government would be false to
national trust, md would justly excite the rid
iculc of the civilized world, that would ab
stain from the use of any efficient means to
preserve its own existence, or to overcome a
rebellious and traitorous enemy, by sparing
or protecting the property of those who are
waging war against it.
The principal wealth and power of the reb
el States is a peculiar species of property, con
sisting of the service or labor of African slaves,
or the descendants of Africans. This proper
ty has been variously estimated at the value
of $700,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.
Why should this property be exempt from
the hazards and consequences of a rebellious
war
It was the boast of the leader of the rebel
lion, while he yet had a seat in the Senate of
the United States, that the Southern States
would be comparatively safe and free from
the burdens of war, if it should be brought
on by the contemplated rebellion, and that
boast was accompanied by the savage threat
that 'northern cities and towns would become
the victims of rapine and military spoils,"
and that "Northern men sh uld smell South
ern gunpowder and feel Southern steel." No
one doubts the disposition of the rebels to
.carry that threat into execution. The wealth
of Northern towns and cities, the produce of
Northern farms, Northern workshops and
manufactories, would certainly be seized, des
troj ed, or appropriated as military spoil. No
propertv in the o orth would be spared from
the hands of the rebels, and their rapine
would be defended under the laws of war.—-
While the loyal States thus have all their
•property and posession at stake, are the in
surgent rebels to carry on warfare against
the Government in peace and security
their own property
Reason and justice and
self-preservation
forbid that such should be the policy of this
Government, but demand, on the contrary,
that, being forced by traitors and rebels to the
extremity of war, all the rights and powers
of war should be exercised to bring it to
speedy end.
Those who make war against the Govern
ment justly forfeit all rights of property, priv
ilege, or security, derived from the Constitu
tion and laws, against which they are ir
armed rebellion and as the labor and service
of their slaves constitute the chief property
of the Tebels, such property should share the
common fate of war to which they have de
voted the property of loyal citizens.
While it is plain that the Slave property
of the. South is justly subjected to all the con-
S'ii
sequences of this rebellious war, and that the
Government would be untrue to its trust in
not employing all its rights and powers of
war to bring it to a speedy close, the details
of the plan for doing so, like all other military
measures, must, in a great degree, be left to
be determined by particular exigencies. The
disposition of other property belonging to the
rebels that become subjects to our arms is
governed by the circumstances of the case.
The Government has no power to hold slaves
none to restrain a slave of his liberty, or to
exact his service. It has a right, however, to
use the voluntary servicc of slaves liberated
by war from their rebel masters, like any
other property of the rebels, in whatever
mode may be most eflieient for the defence of
the Government, the prosecution of the war,
and the suppression of the rebellion. It is
clearly a right of the Government to arm
slaves, when it may become necessary, as it
is to use gunpowder taken from the enemy.—
Whether it is expedient to do so is purely a
military question. The right is unquestion
able by laws of war. The expediency must
be determined by circumstances, keeping in
I view the great object nf overcoming the reb
els, re-establishing the laws, and restoring
peace to the nation.
It is vain ami idle for the Government to
carry on this war, or hope to maintain exist
ence against rebellious force, without employ
ing nil the rights and powers of war. As has
been said, the right to deprive the rebels of
their property in slaves and sla ,e labor, is as
clear and absolute, as the right to take for
age from the licid, or cotton from the ware
house, or powder and arms from the maga
zine. To leave the enemv in the possession
16*007 °t" such property as lbrage and cotton and
military stores, and the means of constantly
reproducing them, would be madness. It is,
therefore, equal madness to leave them in
peaceful and securc possession of slave proper
ty, more valuable and efficient to them for
war, than forage, cotton, or military stores
Such policy would be national suicide. What
to do with that species of proptrty, is a ques
tion that time and circumstances must solve
and need not be anticipated further than to
repeat that they cannot be held by the Gov
ernment as slaves. It would be useless to
ke (p them as prisoners of war, and self-pre
servation, the highest duty of a Government
or of individuals, demands that they should
be disposed of or employed in the most effect
ive manner that will tend most speedily to
suppress the insurrection and restore the
authority of the Government. If it shall be
found that the men who have beer, held by
the rebels as slaves, are capable of bearing
arms and performing efficient military service,
it is the right, and may become the duty, of
the Government to arm and equip thein, and
employ their services against the rebels, un-

An item of very heavy expense is Ihe large
mounted force which has been organized,
equipped and made available since the called
session of Congress, and which was not com
puted for in the estimate. While an increase
of cavalry was undoubtedly necessary, it has
reached a numerical strength more than ade
quate to the wants of tlic service. A s it can
only be maintained at a great cost, measures
will be taken for its gradual reduction.
Bat in whatever manner they may bo used
610,637 20,334 660,971 by the Government, it is plain that, once 1.fa­
ille appropriations asked for the service of crated^ by the rebellious acts^of their mas
the next tiscal year are computed for a force
of 500,000 men. They have been reduced to
the lowest possible amount cons U nt with
the public interests, and are based upon a
Strictly economical administration of tl.j va
rious oranches of this department.
1
he appropriations to cover deficiencies are
rendered necessary by the excess of the force
in the field over that upon which the esti
mates were founded, and by extraordinary ex
penditures connected with the employment
and discharge of the Three Months' C'ontin
gent.

ters, they should never again be restored to
bondage. By the master's treason and rebel
lion he forfeits all right to the labor and serv
ice of his slave and the slave ftf the rebel
lious it aster, by his servicc to the Govern
ment., becomes justly entitled to freedom and
protection.
The disposition to be made of the slaves of
rebels, after the close of the war, can be
safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of
Congress. The Representatives of the Peo
ple will unquestionably secure to the loyal
slavehold rs every right to which'they are en
titled under the Constitution of the country.
"FORWAKD !"—One sentence in the Secre
tary of War's Report is significant, namely,
that the army of tha Potomac would soon
make such a demonstration as will break up
the rebellion in every part of the Union.
NEGROES AS SOLDIERS.—Alexander Hamil
ton in 1789 wrote a letter to John Jay in
which he earnestly recommended the em
ployment cf negroes as soldiers. It is well
known that they were thus employed to a con
siderable extent during the revolution*
BUND ASYLUM.—At a recent meeting of
the Blind Asylum Trustees at Iowa City,
Hon. Oran Faville, ex-Lieutenant Governor,
was elected Principal. He will assume the
duties of the position in July. Mrs. Faville
will be Matron of the institution.
gg^St. Helena Inlet, which has been tak
en possession of by our troops under Gen.
Sherman, is about as far to the northeast of
Port Royal as Tybee Island is to the south
west. Its seizure gives us the command of
another entnncc to the inland chain of wa
ter communication in that vicinity.
RIGHT—The New York Times says: "It is
stated from a perfectly authentic source, that
bill has already been prepared, and will soon
be introduced into the Legislature of Ken
tucky confiscating the slave property of
Kentucky rebels, and that it will undoubtedly
become a law. A similar bill will be put up
on its passage in the Legislature of the new
State of Virginia, west of the mountains, now
in session.
PROGRESS.—Two orders emanating respec
tively from the Departments of State and
Treasury, issued on the 5th inst., give unmis-
takeable signs of progress in the right direc
tion. One is that a fugitive from a rebel
master is no more to be arrested on the Po
tomac. He is to be set at work, or he isjree.
Rules are specifically and clearly laid
down by
Secretary Chase for the cmploymentof means
to convert rebel property and crops to the use
of the government,and at this the slaves of reb
el masters are to be set to work,under special
government agents. This is right.
BRIG. GEN. MCKEAN.—The Marion Regis
ter says Gen. T. J. McKean, who has recently
been promoted to a Brigadier Generalship, has
been a resident of Marion for nearly 22
y,?ars. He graduated at \V est Point in 1834,
nd in 1836 found himself a captain in the
regular army, in active servicc in the Florida
war. Afterwards he resigned his commission
and took a position as chief eng neer of a
railroad which was to be built from New Or
leans, through the swamps of Mississippi and
Florida to the eastern coast of the latter
State. The bubble burst in 1839, and the
company as well as the railroad suffered fir an
cial ruin. He then, poor in purse, but not in
spirit, took his way northward, and after a
brief sojourn in Illinois, came to Iowa, and
settled in Marion in 1840. His career in the
Mexican war is known to the whole country
He voluuteercd with the first, and, we be
lieve, the only company which went from
Iowa, and was with Gen. Scott in every bat
tle from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico, and
was wounded in several engagements. At
the storming of Chcpultepec he greatly dis
tinguished himself, and was one of the first
to scale tho walls of that celebrated castle.—
He was especially complimented in nearly all
the reports to the War Department of the
battles in which he was engaged, and near
the close of the war was tendered a higher
commission by President Polk, whidi he de
clined.
OUR ARMY CORRESPONDENCE.
FORT SCOTT, KANSAS, Nov. 19.
DEAR JOURNAL: After a silence of several
weeks I will attempt to giveyou some account
of our wanderings to and fro. Wo arrived at
this meanest cf all mean places last Friday
morning at 10 o'clock, after one of the hardest
marches on record.
Since my last communication we have trav
eled over 400 miles, passing through portions
of the countus of Jackson, Cass, Johnson,
Ilenry, St. Clair, Polk, Cedar, Dade, Green
a: Barton, and encountering every variety
of people from the full blood fire eating "se
cesh" to the pretended Union man, whining
over his misfoi tunes like a hound, as he gen
erally is.
Seveial times we encamped upon the ground
where Price had built his fires before us, on
his retreat from Lexington, and that is just
about as near as we could get to them they
being ten days ahead of us. We crossed the
Osage at Osceola, or rather Ihe place where
Osceola was, for it was then only a mass of
of ruins—the result of a former visit. Thirty
kegs of powder, two hundred pigs of lead
and other items were found I uried in
vine near the town, and it was said that $9,
000 in gold was found among the ruins of the
banking house.
From Osceola our march was toward Spring
field to Hummiuisville, a small village twenty
five miles distant, llere our command was
overtaken by that of Gen. Sturgis, who had
followed in our rear from Kansas City. Some
misunderstanding had existed between Lane
and Sturgis previous to our leaving that place
and in consequence Lane was ordered to move
toward Kansas, which he did, and after two
days march reached Montevillo, in Cedar
county where we were overtaken by dis
patches from Fremont, and our course was
again turned toward Springfield. We were
now in the region of the Ozark Mountains,
wild and uninhabited wa.-te (12^ cent lands,
perhaps.)
One morning, while passing a cabin squat
ted on the only level spot we had seen for
hours, our column was attacked by "secesh."
The forces consisted of a squad of lop -eared
dogs, led on by a woman with a squalling baby
in her arms with tho old man posted behind
the half open door of the ibin, in reserve.
The old lady commenced the attack by a
loud ''hurrah Jell'. Davis, and the dogs
yelped and the reserve hid under the bed.
One of our valiant corporals advanced to
the charge, but was finally driven back by
the enemy's shouts of n old Abe Lincoln
and his "nigger equality," and his "nigger"
Vice President.
All attempts to bring our forces to the
"scratch" were useless, and the old lady con
tinued her yelling until we fell off the edge of
their plantation into the next ravine.
FromMontevilta to Greenfield was our next
move, where we found Sturgis again, and
where we had the promise of a day or two oi
rest, and our mp was being comfortably ar
ranged with that expectation, when suddenly
at 4 o'clock, while everything was in full
headway for a good supper and a good nights
slecf), 'strike tents'' and prepare for a night
march, was the order, and just as the sun
went down we moved out for Springfield,
distant forty miles.
At midnight we halted to allow the train
to come up with us. We had made a most
miserable march tumbling over rocks and
falling into ditches, h. If a dozen deep. We
scrambled our way for fourteen miles without
halting.
At the first streak of day we were off
again traveled five miles to wood and water
got breakfast, and were moving again at ten
o'clock, and that evening at sunset, weary,
foot-sore, and covered with dust, wo entered
Springfield, where already several divisions
of the Grand Army of the West were as
sembled.
For several days division after di
vision came in, until every nook and
corner about the town was occupied as a
camping ground, and along every roadway
troops of horse and parties of men were con
tinually passing, llet e was a splendid op
portunity for a display of the "pomp and cir
cumstance of war." Behold yonder group of
officers, in all the gloiy of blue coats, gilt
buttons and Hashing sabres. They go dash
ing by, with rowels buried in the flanks of
spavined horses, and bear ng upon their bur
dened shoulders the ensignia of thi-ir rank.—
Here we see a son of Italy, whose broken
English, irreproachable mustache, and excel
lent judgment in the matter of brandy
smashes, have rendered him a fit object for
promotion to the staff. His organ and mon
key are exchanged for the sword and spurs.
Yonder is a person of more humble rank, an
American by birth. His blue coat, fastened
by a single row of brass buttons, brass plates
upon his shoulders, and along, straight sword
swinging'gracefully from a buckskin belt,
proclaim his rank to be "Sergeant of the
Guard." Serge?nt of the Guard: About
face• Your sentimental nonsense in regard
to the poetry of war may well vanish, as you
discover that his immaculate blue coat, with
its buttons of brass, is not of sufficient length
in its nether extremity to coneeal the fact
that our Sergeant is also a color hearer, if a
bearer of a flag of truce can be so called.—
Alas fur the pomp and circumstance of war
Why we did not fight at Springfield is a
question that puzzles many a man who
thought he was going there for no other pur
pose. Every division had come in on a forced
march—some 30, some 40, and one even 50
miles, in 24 hours. The enemy occupied the
field where Lyon fell. Fremont was no long
er in the way, and Ms blunders could no long
er hinder our onward match. We had plenty
of men and plenty of guns, and the men
were ready for the work but we did not
fight. Eight days were lost in idleness—the
enemy were then gone—and the grand army
was divided.
Our brigade commenced its march for Kan
sas on the 9th instant, passing through
Greenfield to Tamar, Benton ccunty, from
which place about 1300 men, detailed from
the 3d and 9th cavalry, and accompanied by
Robb's battery of Indiana artillery (which
joined us at Springfield) made a march of 25
miles to the southeast, with the intention of
surprising a rebel camp at Bower's Mills.—
The infantry were placed in wagons, and a
night mat ch was made, but the bird had flown
before we reachcd him. Our horses and
mules were fed on secession corn, and at day
break we turned toward our camp, which we
found deserted, Line having left orders for
the other regiments to move on toward Fort
Scott. Nothing was left but for us to follow
on, and it was 10 o'clock at night before we
got into camp, having traveled about 65 miles
in 32 hours, on one meal. Our tents having
been stowed into the baggage wagons of the
4th, we were obliged to bunk down on our
blankets.
I had made my bed, and was lying in it,
sound asleep, my h0ad resting upon a cart
ridge box, when I was aroused by a vigorous
shaking, and a loud voice proclaimed, "Let
ters for company ." A couple of letters
from home, and a copy of the Journal, were
thrust into my hands, and straightway I re
turned to the arms of Morphey, or some other
fellow. Who wouldn't be a soldier!
A march of a day and a half brought us to
our present locality, where we will probably
remain some weeks.
An expedition to be Indian Territory is
talked of. E H. G.
COL. MOOBE AT LANCASTER, Mo.—The de
feat of the rebel horde at Lancaster, Mo., on
Sunday, the 24th ult., by Col. Moore, has
ended "the "bushwhacking" in Northeast Mis
souri. During several days following, the
rebels came swarming into Moore's camp,
barefooted, naked arid destitute, appealing to
be received as penitents. They were requir
ed to surrender thejr arms, take the oath of
allegiance, and large numbers of them did
so.
MUSCATINE, FRIDAY, DECEMBER
BENTON BARRACKS.
St. Louis, Nov. 29, 1861.
DEAR JOURNAL: To-day I take up the pen
to return a two-weeks' old promise to write in
"a day or two," and to plead as an excuse for
delaying to write to many anxious friends who
exacted of me a promise to write often, that 1
have had more to do than will, for common
fall to me in the same length of time.
i When we left Camp McClellan wo had not
received our great coats, and when we arrived
here the weather was quite cool, and the great
coats began to be anxiously and enquiringly
looked for. In a lew days after coming to
camp, great boxes of coats were handed in
and by some curious contriving it was laid
out that companies A, and were to have
grey coats—all, the other companies getting
the regular army article—a light blue, felt
cloth coat with wide capes but when the offi
cersof the above companies saw the grey
coats, they positively refused to receive them,
After a few days',delay, during which we le
solved to stand the cold rather than accept
them, we were furnished with a first rate
black coat made after the army pattern. The
grey ones were made of a very inferior article
of cloth, were light, rotten anu poorly made,
but the ones we have are made very substan
tially, are of heavy felt cloth, aud will not
wet through in a whole day's rain.
Yesterday we received our tenfs. The bal
ance of our camp equipage was issued to-day,
and now we are all fixed up and-daily expect
ing that we will have a call to penetrate the
"land of cotton."
Nothing is known for certain about when
we will leave here, but if we judge by the
signs of the times, all point to an early move.
The whole force for this division of the grand
army is fast coming together, and you may
rest assured it augurs good to the Union.
The health of the 11th regiment is very
ood at present. Our company has but four
on the sii k list, none of whom are serious.—
Two of .our men—James II. Downing and
\. B. Gilbert—were left in Iowa on account
of sickness, but will probably join us soon.
There have been some cases of small-pox in
camp, and I understand the whole regiment
is to be inoculated to prevent its spreading.
While I am writing, Col. Ilare is on the
parade grounds putting the 11th through the
battalion exerci.-es. Our Iowa boys are ad
mired and observed by all who visit"the camp,
and it only needs a little notice in the Demo
crat that the Iowa 11th is to have a review or
dress parade, this evening, to call out a crowd
of visitors to the camp.
The boys came into the city under very ad
verse circumstances, but their song of' Hap
py Land o' Canaan," sung as they marched
through the mud to camp, touched the hearts
of the people, and makes them remember the
"Iowa 11th" :,s a household word.
The Colonel is growing quite popular, not
withstanding his modesty and studied desire
to avoid show. The n of his regiment,
too, are every day becoming note attached to
him.
Our fare here is very much the same as at
Camp McClell n. The barracks are tight—
otherwise they arc not as good as our old
place. The bu.iks are too narrow for the men
to lay in with comfort, and they are cramped
in other ways.
The parade ground is beautiful when it is
dry, and even when it rains the water is soon
drained off, as the grounds are all under
drained. The soil is a stiff, mucky clay kind,
and does not dry up like our Muscatine
land.
Our plan of cooking is nearly the same as I
wrote you about in a previous letter.
We are abundantly supplied with water
from the river. There is a hydrant to every
three or four companies. Our bread is better
than we had in the other camp, and is baked
harder.
The camp is said to contain now about 18,
000 men, and additions arc coming in almost
every day. The other camps around St. Lou
is contain many more men, but the exact
number, or names of camps, I cannot give
you.
Since I sent you our roll the following men
have enlisted with us, and been properly
mustered in
Henry Madden, Age 43 Nat. Pcnn.
David Witmeoyer, 25
G. F. Boyer, 43 Germany.
Chas. Entsler, 18 Virginia.
J. W. Richards, 22 Indiana.
C. P. Kings'and, 22 NewY.
Chester Wi ed and J. B. Dougherty were
in camp yesterday to see us. You may
be sure the boys are glad to see any one
from Muscatine, for now when we are away
it is almost as pleasant to sec a man (or wo
man, either from Muscatine county as to
see a brother. It is astonishing how the af
fections deepen around home when we are
separated from it. Any little keepsake—
a picture of a friend, or dearer one—a book
or token trom a loved hand—all little pres
ents, insignificant of themselves, are almost
idolized when the name of "HOME" is linked
with them. Soldiers do become rough to all
around them when in an enemy's land, but
none need say they have not warm hearts
and clinging affections.
The Journal comes regularly, and if you
could see how the boys spring around me to
get one, when I go into the quarters and cry
out "Muscatine Journal," you would feel a
thrill of pleasure which you do not feel every
day, if compelled to sit all day in your arm
chair and supply the wants- of your own
"family" when they call for "copy."
I think have taken up enough of your
time in looking over thus far, and so until
next week adieu. O. A. A. G.
pre
and
(|^"Thc camps around Washington
sent a very different aspect on a dark
wintry day, and under the cheerful light of a
mellow sky. The other evening I went out
to the camp of the Berdan Rifles. For two
days it had been cold and rainy, and the
damp ground, chilling wind and sombre sky,

FEED OF AN AKMT OF HALF A MILLION.—
The following figures show the amount of
commissary stores which will be consumed in
one month by the U. S. Army when brought
up to the standard authorized by Congress,
viz: 500,000 men. It will be seen that the labors
of the commissary department are anything
but trivial, and that the cost of feeding an
army is a somewhat serious item:

pean powers in brraking it up. On the oth

mongers at London, says that the Confeder
ate States, "though cut off by blockade from
all foreign trade,have been able from their inter
nal resources alone, to equip and maintain in
the field, an army of over 250,000 troops."—

Mr. Sumner presented n petition from the
cit'zens of Haverhill, Mass., that the slaves of
rebels be liberated unconditionally, and the
slaves of Union men alter payment.
Mr. Chandler offered a resolution to appoint
a committee of three, to inquire into the dis
asters of Bull Bun and Edwards' Ferry.
Mr. Lane, of Kansas, mjyed to amend by
inserting Springfield, Wilson's Creek and
Lexington.
Mr. Chandler said he hoped- the resolution
wouldn't be amended.
Mr. Lane said the man most entitled to
honor had been punished at Wilson's Creek,
lie perished, and was sacrificed because he
was not relieved when he could have been.—
The people want to know whether the gallant
General Lyon was sacrificed. They want to
kr.ow why regunents were sent to Cairo in
stead of to his'relief, and why the army mov
ed at a snail's pace to reinforce Col. Mulligan,
at Lexington. The people wanted to know
V
the names of those who permitted these
things, and in his (Lane's) opinion they
would not have to lo jk far for the man who per
mitted the sacrifice of Gen. Lyon.
Mr. Lane's amendment was" disagreed to,
Mr. Grimes offered a substitute,"to appoint
a committee of two members uf the Senate
and three members of tht House, to investi
gate the causes of the disasrers to our army.
On motion of Mr. Fessenden, the subject
was postponed until to-m rrovv.
Mr. Wilson gave notice that he should, to
morrow, introduce a bill to abolish sUttler's
in the volunteer forces.
Mr. Grimes moved to take up tho resolu
tion to investigate the case of Col. Miles. He
said a Court of Enquiry had found that Col.
Miles was intoxicated to a certain extent,
enough to justify ('ol. Richardson in applying
epithets to him, but not enough to remove
him from commmd. lie wanted all the facts
of the case to go before the people.
The re-olution was agreed to.
Mr. Trumbull introduced his bill for con
fiscating the property and giving freedom to
the slaves of rebels. He said it provides for
the absolute and complete forfeiture forever
to the use of every species of property, real
and personal, wherever situated, with the use
belonging to persons beyond trie jurisdiction
or beyond the reach of civil process, in the
ordinary mede of judicial proceedings, in con
sequence of the present rebellion, who,during
its existence, shall take up arms against the
United States or in any way aid or abet the
rebellion. This forfeiture to be enforced
against property in the rebellious districts
through the military power, and all property
of other persons of the United States where
the judiciate power is not obstructed by the
rebellion, through the oui ts, that the pro
ceeds of the property of each individual seiz
ed and forfeited be subject to the legal claims
of just creditors, and to be held for the bene
fit of loyal citizens despoiled of property by
the rebellion, and to'defray the expenses in
curred in its suppression. The bill also for
feits the claims of all rebels and those who
give them aid and comfoit, to the persons
they hold in slavery. The bill declares that
s'aves thus forfeited shall be free, and makes
it the duty of the President to provido for the
colonization of such as may be willing to go to
some tropical country, where they may have
the protection of the government and be se
cured in all the rights and privileges of free

Mr. Gurley ofilred a resolution, which was
adopted, requesting the committee on Judici
ary to enquire if a telegraphic censorship of
the press has been established in this city,
and if so, by whose authority, and by whom
it is now controlled to report whether such
censorship has not been used to restrain
wholesome political criticism and discussion,
while its professed and laudable object has
been to withhold from the enemy information
in relation to the movements of the anny.
Mr. Stevens submitted a series of resolu
tions, referring the various portions of the
President's Message to the appropriate com
mittees.
Mr. Arnold moved that that part relating
to the defenses and fortifications of the great
lakes and harbors, be referred to a select
committee of nine members of the House.
Mr. Gurley said it was contended on one
side that the great West and South-West
should not be ignored, and on the other that
the subject of defenses concerned not a section
but the entire country.
The question was referred to a select com
mittee.
The resolutious, as thus anv-nded, were
adopted, together with one introduced by Mr.
Blair, of Mo., which refers that portion of the
message in relation to the colonization of
slaves taken from armed rebels to a select
committee of seven.
