RESUMK OF TBS
WEEK'S PKOCXBDINGS.
"V
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4.—Not for
many years have the members of the
house listened with such rapt atten
tion to the annual message of the
president of the United States, as they
did yesterday to the reading of the
first message of Piesident Roosevelt.
Every word was followed intently, from
the announcement of "the tragic death
of President McKinley, in the opening
sentence, to the expression of the clos
ing wish that our relations with the
world would continue peaceful. The
reading occupied two hours, but not
over a dozen members left their seats
until it was concluded. Severdl times
there was applause, and at the conclu
sion there was an enthusiastic demon
stration on the Republican si Je. On
motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, that
portion of the message relating to the
deat.h of the late president was refer
red to a committee consisting of one
member from each state, to join a sim
lar committee of the senate, to consider
and report by what token of respect
and affection it may be proper for con
gress to express the deep sensibility of
the nation to the tragic death of tlie
late president. The speaker appointed
a committee, headed by Mr. Grosvenor,
and then, as a further mark of respect,
the house adjourned.
In the Senate.
The senate listened to the first mes
sage of President Roosevelt yesterday,
and adopted a resolution directing the
appointment of a committee, to co-op
erate with a like committee from the
house, to consider by what token of re
spect and affection congress might ex
press the sorrow of the nation upon the
tragic death of the late President Mc
Kinley. The message was delivered
soon after the senate met. The read
ing occupied nearly two and a half
hours, and was,listened to with marked
respect by the senators. The first por
tion, dealing witfc the Buffalo tragedy,
excited the most profound interest in
the senate. At the "conclusion of the
reading of the message Mr. Poraker,
senior senator from Ohio, presented the
McKinley resolution, and, as a further
mark of respect, the senate adjourned.
III the Senate,
Washington, Dec. 5.—Practically the
entire time of the senate yesterday was
devoted to the introduction of bills and
resolutions. Two of these measures,
relating to the suppression of anarchy
and tho dealing with anarchists, were
allowed to lie on the table so that their
authors, Mr. McComas of Maryland
anil, Mr. Vest of Missouri, may bring
tlum to the early attention of the sen
ate. The Isthmian canal report was
transmitted to the senate by the pres
ident and several bills providing for
the construction of the waterway,' one
of them by Mr. Morgan of Alabama,
who has led the movement for the ca
nal in the past, were presented.
Washington, Dec. 6. Senator Mc
Comas of Maryland made an extended
and carefully prepared speech in the
senate yesterday with anarchy as his
theme, and was followed by some brief
remarks by Mr. Hoar of Massachu
setts on the difficulties in the way of
dealing with anarchist assassins. Mr.
McComas' remarks showed careful ex
amination of the legal authorities. He
maintained that congress had full pow
under the constitution to enact a
law punishing with death any person
killing a president or assaulting iha
president with intent to kill, or aiding.
Inciting or'procuring such an act. He
favored-rigid provisions in the Immi
gration laws for the deportation of
alien anarchists. Much of the speech
was devoted to an explanation of the
dr.tigerous doctrines of anarchy, and
the extent to which these doctrines had
been propagated -within recent years.
Senator Hoar's remarks were interest
ing, coming from the venerable chair
Man of the-judiciary committee, which
will have much to do with the framing
of any legislation on this subject. Ha
said that the difficulty was that assas
sins of-kings and rulers always gloried
In their crimes and were in no wise de
terred by the fear of punishment. For
this reason he thought was almost
useless to multiply punishments. The
most effective remedy' he suggested
wculd be to have the civilized nations
of the world agree upon some desolate
spot on the earth's surface, to which
all anarchists who uphold assassina
tion'or the gverthrow of government
should be transported^ In such a com
munity the anarchist could ca'rry^out
his theories of living without a gov
ernment and the world would be rid of
his presence.
The senate passed a bill extending
the life of the industrial commission
until Feb. 15, next to complete the
work it,now has in hand. The commit
tee which will consider an appropriate
tribute to the late president McKinley
was announced. The senate adjourned
until next Monday.

case of Kidney Disease in this county.
Mr. Byron O. Leslie of Northport has
for years been a victim of kidney de
rangements, with all the consequent
pain and annoyance. He was gradual
ly growing worse, and as tho disease
advanced he became very despondent,
often wondering if he would have to
endiire this suffering all his lifetime.
But at last he found a remedy that
cured him In Dodd's Kidney Pills. He
was much pleased, but did not say
much about it, lest the good effect he
experienced would not last. Now, how
ever, after nine months of continued
good health he has concluded that lie is
permanently cured, and his announce
ment of this has caused a profound
sensation among the physicians and the
people who knew of his apparently
hopeless condition.

Syrup of Figs appeals to the cultured and the
well-informed and to the healthy, because its com
ponent parts are simple and wholesome and be
cause it acts without disturbing the natural func
tions, as it is wholly free from every objectionable
quality or substance. In the process of
manufacturing figs are used, as they are
pleasant to the taste, but the medicinal
virtues of Syrup of Figs are obtained
from an excellent combination of plants
known to be medicinally laxative and to
act most beneficially.
