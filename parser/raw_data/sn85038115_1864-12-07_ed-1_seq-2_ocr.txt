The leading Abolition papers are giv
ing out strong indications that as soon as
the crusade against slavery is terminated
one against Catholicism is to be corn
tneneed. The New York Timet, Lincoln's,
personal organ has commenced agitating
the question, and John W. Forney, wide
ly known as "Lincoln's dog " follows in
the same direction. It was predicted
seme time since that a war abeut religion
would immediately follow the war about
slavery. Speaking of the Catholic church
Forney says, "its plots and eabals may
be consigned to the same hated obscurity
in which human slavery is forever se
pulchred."

Presidents message in full next week.
Notwithstanding it emanates from a very
weak hea'ded author, it will be important
as indicating the future poliey of Mr.
Lincoln's advisers.
Proclaiming Hypocrisy,
Any unsophisticated person reading
the thanksgiving proclamations ef our
President and Governors would suppose
the authors to be eminent for exalted
piety. He would hardly conclude that
en was so boorish in his manners and
obscene in his language as te he barely
tolerated, en account of bis position, in
good society. That another engineered
electron- frauds ea a scale that makes all
farmer frauds insignificant: Thatanother
was driven from his hotel by the landlord
Car his abominable vices.
These, ear chief rulers, write devontly
pious proclamations for prayer and thanks
giving te God, whose name never passes
heir lips except in blasphemy.
Hypocrisy can go no further; its utmost
limits have been compassed.
It sees that the general corruption
prevalent under this administration has
infested the Sanitary Fairs. In the few
instances where an exhibit of the receipts
and expenditures has been published, it
appears that less than one-filth of the
proceeds has ever reached the soldiers,
for whom it was contributed. Over four
fifths has been absorbed by officials, and
squandered in various ways. It is charg
ed by responsible parties that a consid
erable amount of the funds thus raised
was invested in the publication aud cir
culation of documents to aid in re-electing
Lincoln.
There is no appropriation of money so
sacred as to proteet it from the fingers of
shoddyites. From the head of this ad
ministration, down through all its rami
fications, to its lowest limits, it is reeking
with foul corruption.
Taxes are piled en taxes to satisfy
these greedy vampires, and yet they de
vour the voluntary contributions of a
generous people to their wounded and
languishing soldiers.
We stated in an editorial on the 23rd.
that the conntry would have felt safer ii
McClellan had been elected, and that the
Abolitionists themselves wore annoyed by
grave apprehensions that they have ruin
ed the country by electing Lincoln.
Fully confirmatory of this is tho fol
lowing from the Boston Gtnimonwtalth
Senator Summer's organ, written by
Agate," the Administration correspon
dent of the Administration Commercial,
of Cincinnati:
We have gained the battle. Must the
historian, in recounting hereafter our
triumph, declare that we have thereby-
lost the campnigu?
Mr. Lincoln has undergone no change
since the last of July, when good men of
all parties were uniting in the opinion
that his election was an impossible u:il;Mi
ity. Shall we hope that it will now Le
jeit lor inose good men to enauge men
opinions?
With the most earnest wishes that here
after Mr. Lincoln's administration may
exhibit fewer of those fault against which
Radical Republicans have felt forced to
testify, I confess that I am not sanguine.
The same men retain their influence over
him; the same kind of advUers surround
him; the same counsels are still likely to
have weight.
The fact which the whole country sees
is precisely the one which Mr. Lincoln
does not see; the fact, namely, that an
overpowering sense of the duty of defeat
in"' the Chicago Platform, and not the
confidence of the people in Mr. Lincoln
re-elected him. There never was a can
vass in which personal enthusiasm was so
small an element. All our speakers bear
the same testimony. Through large pot
tions of the country, especially in the
West, men voted for Mr. Lincoln as they
take calomel: it was a bitter pill, but the
political doctors thought it necessary.

obtaining decided successes aad over
whelming victories. We shall not at
present dissent from this theory, but in
the meat loyal manner possible would ask
a-few explanations, in order that these
leyal telegraphic despatches may better
adapt themselves to coppehead credulity.
The despatches of the 30th stated that
Thomaa was not falling back, that he was
imply maneuvering for position. The
despatches of tha 1st show that he is
farther from Atlanta than Sherman is.
Two or three hundred miles is a consid
erable manoaver for a small army.
Thomas gained a glorious victory on
tho 29ih, yet on that night he fell back,
end in the morning Hood was confront
ing him. The victors were pursued by
tbe vanquished.
The despatches state that Thomas in
flicted a loss of five thousand on the ene
my, and that his own loss was but five
hundred, and add that Themas fell back
fcir a better position. Men, not Aboli
tionists, would suppose he already had a
yretty good position it he could destroy
five rhoasand ef the enemy, himself losing
hut five hundred. v
Thoiuai bus placed Jn the entrench
ments all the employees of the Quarter
master's and Commissary's departments.
This sorely does not indicate a very de
cisive victory.
We are willing to believe that Thomas
ihfiiiited. a gteatttc loas than he suffered,
But we pretest agaiaas such absurdities
nd falsefaeium a these despatches being
snt to the people for news.
The effect of such extraordinary efforts
to make good news, immediately creates
the apprehension that there is bad news
to eouceal. Better, a thousand times bet
ter let the people know the truth at ence.
If Thomas gained some' advantages, let
them tell us so and we will rejoice at it;
hut when they tell us he did not retreat
but manoevered two or three hundred
miles in three weeks; that the vanquished
pursued the viotors; that ha left a posi
tion bote he could destroy ten for one,
fer a better position, we believe it is an
attempt to deceive.

to be 1000. Why cant they tell us the
truth at ence? the election is ever. Be

Remarkable Incendiarism
In -cw York.
On the eight of the 25th sift,, simul
taneous attempts were made to burn nearly
all the principal hotels .in New York, to
gether with Barnum's Museum and other
large buildings. The fire in every ta
stanoe was quenched before any consid
erable damage was done. It was evident
ly a preeoaceited plot, and is charged
upon Southerners who are sojourning in

made, aad strict orders in regard to South

the price, and take the land; if not, they
forfeit the money down, if any, aad pay

This trick gives the speculator the ad

be able to raise ia the vicinity; it pre
vents the seller from disposing of his
land, by sale or lease, to other parties, for

Hood's Design.
The Times Washington special says:
Hood's movements in Tennessee seem to
reveal the intention of making his way
into East Tennessee. The line in which
he is moving would indicate an attempt to
turn Nashville on the east side, and make
his way to form a junction with Breckin
ridge. It is believed he will then essay
the capture of Knoxville which will give
him railroad communication via East
Tennessee and the Valley with Lynch
burg and Richmond. The successful is
sue of Sherman's move will have severed
communications between the twe rebel
armies. Hood's present campaign seems
to be directed towards securing such com
munications by the line mentioned.
Hood's army in this case would be in a
position to join Lee's should this move
become advisable.
