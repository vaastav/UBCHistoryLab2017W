ter had obtained a rifle and on Sun
day when the men were gathered in
a bath house, he opened fire on the
guards outside. He killed Bliss, Ad
kisson, a trusty guard and wounded
other guards. f inally he was forced
to surrender when a guard in hiding
took him unawares.
. Slaughter often boasted he would
never go to the electric chair. At
Hot Springs, his cell was searched
daily for weapons. After a Jury re
turned a -verdict of life imprison

handful of hack saws, remarking
that if the sentence bad been death
he would not have stayed in jail
overnight.
The state guard wa called out on
another occasion Just about a year
ago to guard the penitentiary here
when a plot which he had instigated
for a wholesale delivery of prisoners
was uncovered.

Secretary Fall leaned over and

Director Arthur P. Davis, of the
reclamation service, declared that the

is completed and a comprehensive
plan for the whole development of
the river system submitted to con

he said. "It is planned to reserve a
certain part of any reservoir on the
lower Colorado as a flood control. In
order to intercept floods a reservoir
is necessary on the lower river.
Director Davis Indicated that the
Boulder canyon dam is the most fea
sible project and probably would be
the first unit constructed in the de
velopment system. Ha said, how
ever, that although it was close to
market and therefore Justified eco

developed later today when Judge

states deem it inadvisable to partici

derstood Arizona was prepared to
join in such a move.
The statement said ' that these
states were not withdrawing from
the league, but would not participate
in any matters of policy until each

"We feel that no fair expression of
the purposes or policies of the league
can be given when the views of these
states can be nullified by the votes of
one state," the statement said.
This move leaves California as the
only state in the league that can vote

in a recess taken for this purpose
during the afternoon.
In answer to the interrogatories
made by Attorney Flynn with the
hypothetical question as a basis, Dr.
Haines declared that Gardner was
able to distinguish right from wrong
on Nov. 3; that he did not commit the
acts charged against him in the in
dictment because of any insane de
lusions, and that he did not commit
the acts because of irresistible im
pulses caused by an impaired brain.
Carl A. Davis, attorney for Gard
ner, then began his cross-examination
of the witness, In reply to the ques
tions of Davis, the physician said that
he had gone thoroughly into. Gard
ner's motives and his belief in spiri
tualism. He testified that when he
told Gardner in the county jail who
he was, the defendant said:
'"Are yon here ' to spread ' reports
that I am -nutty'?"
When the physician told him that
he was not' there to spread any re
ports, but to get the facts in his case.
and that he would probably be called
upon to testify, Gardner asked:
Gardner Tells Life Story
T want to know if you believe that
those who believe in spiritualism are
nutty' 7"
"I told him," said Dr. Haines, "that
I did not believe this, and I men
tioned William James to him as as
example, and he mentioned James
Hervey Hyslop, the phychologist.
Gardner then told me the story of his
life."
In making an examination of the
defendant in an effort to uncover his
delusions, the witness said that Gard
ner repeated emphatically his belief
that man-made laws are not worth
a snap of his finger if they stand in
the way of Jiis spiritual development.
He mentioned his controls to the phy
sicians, calling them good and evil.
The expert testified then that what
Gardner said sounded very much as
if he were subject to auditory hallu
cinations, but that this could be de
termined only in a hospital where ar
rangements for the necessary tests
can be made.
"However," Dr. Haines said, "we do
not like, in examining patients, to
take their word that they hear some
thing. I have no evidence of au
ditory hallucinations on the part of
Gardner, nor or visual hallucination
and in the light of my entire exami
nation I am extremely skeptical of the
presence of any hallucinations. 1 am
also extremely skeptical of the belief
of the defendant in what he asserts
are his religious convictions."
Not a Paranoiac
Davis then asked Dr. Haines if he
had examined Gardner as one pos
sibly afflicted with paranoia, and the
physician replied that he had made
such examinations. A discussion of
paranoia then followed between the
witness and the attorney, at the close
of which Dr. Haines said:
But you understand, Mr. Davis,
that I never seriously thought of
paranoia and Gardner together after
my examination, for he is not a para
noiac."
The expert then; In answering
Davis' question concerning the reason
why he thought that Gardner could
distinguish right from wrong, said
that no man who could not distin
guish right from wrong and who was
firm in his belief that he must follow
his spiritual guides without question
could have written to President
Harding asking for a pardon for his
past offenses and drawing in the
letter a pitiful word picture of his
suffering wife and baby.
Davis then asked the physician if
it is possible for one so minded to
stimulate various forms of mental
derangement, to which the witness
replied:
"Simulators can simulate any form
of abnormality they desire."
"Could they simulate mental de
rangement as as to deceive alien
ists?" "It would be possible for one to
carry on a simulation that would de
ceive examiners for weeks. een in
such a poor simulation as some of us
have in mind'."
The witness then repeated his as
sertion that he had not considered
paranoia as having anything to do
with the present caae, whereupon he
was asked what form of mental de
rangement he might consider the de
fendant to be suffering.
Calls Him "Trouble Maker"
"He is a 'psychopathic personal
ity.'" Dr. JIainea replied. "A psy
chopathic personality in one whoe

oped from childhood. Persons of this1
type are trouble makers wherever
they are. The prisons and jails the
world over are tilled with them. The
wardens and Jailers know them well.
There are not many in the hospitals
because they cannot be called In
sane." .
At this point' court was adjourned
until this morning at 9:30 o'clock.
Before permitting the audience, which
was one of the largest to attend the
trial, to leave the room. Judge Wil
liam Hi. Sawtelle warned them that
anyone expressing any opinion of the
case before members of the Jury will
be liable to a jail sentence.
The fifth day of the bandit's trial
opened in the morning with the'tea
timony of Edwin M. Allen, manager
o the Western Union Telegraph of
fice here, who appeared for the gov
ernment and who identified a tele
gram which had been sent by Gard
ner to George I North, assistant
managing editor of the San Francis
co Bulletin, the day after his arrest.
Following this, Mrs. B. O. Hender
son, residing at Seventh and Fill
more streets' in a house in which
Gardner had testified he had lived
between Oct. 22 and Nov. 1. testified
that he had never lived there and that
she had never seen him until she
entered the court room yesterday
morning.
The next witness was George L.
North of the Bulletin. Ha testified
that he had interviewed Gardner in
the federal penitentiary at McNeil
Island, Puget Bound, on June 13, 1921,
when Gardner told him the story of
his life from his childhood to that
date. North said that he and Gard
ner expected to syndicate the story
and sell it lo various newspapers,
but that these hopes were not real
ized as only two papers accepted it.
One was the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
which paid $150 for it and the Los
Angeles Express which paid $150.
The money received from the two
papers was given to Mrs. Gardner.
North then identified the telegram
sent by Gardner to him after his ar
rest, saying it was sent in resnonse
to a wire from himself asking ior
uaraner s story or his escape from
the penitentiary, his telegram, which
was introuueed by the government
to show that Gardner had a motive
ror his robberies different from that
given by him tu the examining alien
ists, in which be declared that he
was trying to make himself inde
president:
"I have spent many sleepless
nights in and out of jail trying to
- undo the things I have done. I
hava broken the heart of the dear
est little woman that evtr livsd,
my wife and my littls baby, Jean
is growing up with the stigma of
her father's sname upon her. tlr,
Harding, am going to ask you
to grant me ens chance by sus
pending th sentsncsa now await
ing ma."
North said after the trial that he
ha d received an answer to this let
ter from Attorney General Daugb
erty. who said that he could not
promise any pardon to Gardner.
F. E. Jarvli, chief postal Inspector
at Fan Diego, who was in charge ot
the investigations of Gardner arls
ing out of his robbery of a truck
there on Apr 1 20, 1920, repeated
Gardner's story of the crime as told
by the bandit to him at the time. In
this confession Gardner told Jarvls,
the witness testified, that he had sto
len a mall pouch at Kern, Calif, and
had buried It. He told Jarvis where
it was and It was afterward found.
