Here is what the New York Station,

will be disappointed.
We have often wondered why some

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
We had hoped to giro President
Grant's message 'a es'.erday morning's
issue, and tku hsTe laid it before oar
rcbderi one d . if advance of any other
paper, but tl nge and unexpected
action of th ' graphic company, In
refusing to gri- u the report at the
price for which the Associated Press
had contracted to furnish it to us, fro
t rated this hope, and we must now be
content to give merely a synopsis of this
admirable State document.
The President after congratulating
the Country in the usual manner npon
the blessings of peace- and prosperity
that have been vouchsafed to us, de-
votes a considerable portion of his mes-
sage to questions that naturally grow
out 0f the present War in Europe, and
nizing the French Republic, while main-
uining a sU-ict adherence to the laws of
neutrality. The United States Govern-
ment as soon as it learned that a Eepub-
a m a f . w .
lic had been proclaimed at Paris, and
that the people of France were acquies
cing in a change of Government, direct
ed our Minister, by telegraph, to recog
nize It, and to tender the President's
congratulations, as well aa those of the
people of the whole Country. The
President says that while we should not
intrude our institutions upon the inhab
itants ot other countries, it is neverthe
less but natural and right to manifest a
lively interest in the spread of Ameri
can political ideas, and to be especially
rejoiced to see them adopted by so great
and highly civilized a country as France,
The President has a good deal to say
about the War in Cuba, and explains
that in he negotiations which he found
necessary to open with the Government
of Spain, in order to adopt measures for
restraining injuries to citizens of the
United States, for which the Spanish
Government in Cuba were responsible,
the United States simply claimed that
in the future the rights secured to their
citizens by treaty should be respected
in Cuba. He hopes that this moderate
and reasonable demand may be acceded
to by Spain without further delay,
The San Domingo scheme is discuss
ed exhaustlngly by the President. He
believes it to have been a great mistake
made by the Senate in refusing to rati
fy the treaty for the annexation of the
island of San Domingo. So soon as it
becomes known that this Government
has abandoned the project of annexa
tion, a free port will be negotiated for
by European Nations, in the bay, and a
large commercial city will spring up, to
which we will be tributary, without re
ceivlug corresponding benefits. The
people of San Domingo are anxious for
annexation. They are a weak people,
but inhabit one of the richest localities
in the world. In regard to that very
interesting and important question, the
Alabama Claims, the President very
pointedly expresses bis regret that uo
adjustment, or any approach to an ad
justment, has yet been made. For this
state of the case England is chiefly re
sponsible, for she has yet manifested no
Krcat concern for a settlement of our
claims. Canada and the British Gov
ernment are also responsible for the en
gendering of an unfriendly feeling be-
tweeu the United States and Great Brit
ain, in relation to the fisheries, and the
President recommends that, if this un
just and un-neighborly conduct be per
sisted in, non-intercourse with Canada
be proclaimed, and that Canandian ves
sels be forbidden to enter the waters of
the Uniled States.
On the financial question the Presi
dent shows that the currency of the
country has appreciated fully one-fourth
during tho last twelve months. He
thinks, however, that the evils or a
depreciated and fluctuating currency
are very great and that it would be
well by wise and prudent legisla
tion to look to a policy which shall
place our currency at par with gold
at no distant day. The tax collect
ed from the people has been reduced
more than eighty millions per an
num. By steadily pursuing the pres
ent wise course there is no reason why
the tax gatherers may not disappear en
tirely.
With reference to Revenue Reform,
the President says :
"Revenue reform if it means this, has
my hearty support; if it involves a col
lection of all the revenue for the sup
port of government, for the payment
of principal and interest or the public
debt, pensions, &c, by directly taxing
the people, then I am against revenue
reform, and confidently believe thepeo
pie are with me. If it means a failure
to provide the necessary means to de
fray all expenses of the government.
and thereby the repudiation of the pub
lic debt and pensions, then I am still
more opposed to such kind of refenue
reform Revenue reform has not been
defined by any of its advocates to my
knowledge, but seems to be accepted as
something which is to supply every
man's wants without any costs or ef
fort on his part. A true revenue re
form cannot be made in a day, bnt
must be the work of national legislation
and of time.
The President has a good deal to say
on the land question, explaining the
original operation of the homestead and
pre-emption laws. He takes the sensi
ble ground that the residuary of the ua
tionai domain should be disposed of to
actual settlers only, and to enterprises
of actual and acknowledged Impor
tance.
Of the Civil Service Reform the Pres
ident wisely says
I rcspectfuM - ra'l vour attention to an
abuce which l be remedied by this
Congress ; it -. . form in the civil ser
vice of the co -airy. I would advise
that it co beyojd the clerks and em
ployees who do not require the advice
and consent of the seuato to make their
appointmen s complete. I would have
it govern not the tenure but the manner
of mak'ng all appointments. There is
no duty which to much embarrasses the
executive as that of appointments, nor
is there any such arduous and thankless
labor imposed upon senators and repre
sentatives as that of finding places for
constituents. The elevation aud purin
cation of the civil service or the gov
ernmont will be hailed with approval
by the whole people.
The message taken all in all is a very
able and wise state document. . The fol
lowing is the concluding passage in the
message :
"In conclusion, I would ram up
the policy of the administration to
be, a thorough enforcement of every
law : a faithful collection of the reven
ne and econemy fn the disbursement of
the same ; reduction or taxes as rapidly
as the requirements of the country will
admit ; reduction of taxation and tariff
to be so arranged aa to afford the great
est relief to the greatest number; hon
est and fair dealings with ail other peo-
le, to the end that war, with all its
lighting consequences, may be avoid
ed, but without surrendering any right
or obligation due the United States ; a
reform in the treatment of the Indiana
and in the whole civil service of the
couutry ; and, finally, in securing a pure
and nntrammeled ballot, where every
man entitled to cast a vote may do so
just once at each election, without fear
of molestation or proscription on ac
count of his political faith, nativity or
color. (Signed) U. S. Grant.

OFPICAL REPORTS
OF THE
STATE IlilM SCHOOL
I. PItI5CIPALS REPORT.
(Concluded from our Jlr$t page.)
CUAXGES IS THE FACCLTY.
At the close of the first term, Miss
Ellen Plumb, Principal of the Model
School, resigned her position, for the
purpose of opening a book store in Em
poria. Tho vacancy caused by this res
ignation was filled by the appointment
of Miss Mary E. Baker, of Decatur, Illi
nois, a teacher in the High School of
that city. Miss Baker brought to her
aid in the work of the Model School, a
successful experience of some eight
year's duration, first as Principal of the
primary department of the Model School
conuected with the State Normal Uni
versity of Illinois, and subsequently,
for the last five years, a teacher in the
Decatur High School. Under her skill
ful management the Model School has
been led to occupy a high place in the
estimation of the community. It gives
me pleasure to add my own testimony
in favor of the general excellence of this
Department of the school.
At the close of the quarter of the fis
cal year, H. B. Norton, Associate Prin-
ipal, resigned his place in the school,
111 health, coupled with a desire for an
active, out-door life, constituted the mo
tives inducing the resignation. Prof. R
B. Dilwortb, of Leavenworth, accepting
the invitation of the Board of Directors,
has been performing the duties of the
vacant position during the present,
third term. Mr. Dilwortb, a graduate
of Princeton College, N. J., is well
known to the teachers of the State by
reason of his successful labors in con
nection with the Normal District Insti
tutes, held for. the last two seasons by
State Superintendent McVicar. He
brings to his work in the Normal School
a large amount of professional enthusi
asm, broad and comprehensive scholar
ship, an energy and willingness to work
bounded onlv by the limitations of
physical strength. I take the liberty to
suggest that such arrangements be made
as will insure to the institution the per
manent services of Prof. Dilwortb.
HISTORICAL SKETCH.
Hon. C. V. Eskridge, in the winter of
1863, then a member of the House of
Representatives, secured, by an act of
tho Legislature, the location of tho State
Normal School at Emporia, with an en
dowment of about thirty-seven thou
sand acres of land. The following ses
sion he procured the passage of an act
for the organization of the institution,
and another, making an appropriation
of one thousand dollars to open the
school for the reception of students. A
competent Board of Directors was ap
pointed by the Governor. This Board
appointed a meeting in the fall of 1864,
but at the time it was to convene, came
the imperative call for all able-bodied
citizens to march to the border. It was
not until January, 1865, that this or
ganization was fully effected and the
nlachincry put in motion. An Execu
tive Committee, President, Secretary
and Treasurer, were appointed. Rev.
G. C. Morse, acting for, and by the au
thority of, tho Board, started for the
east in quest of a suitable person to take
the position of Principal. After many
difficulties and not a few discourage
ments, Prof. L. B. Kellogg, a graduate
of the Illinois Normal University, was
Induced to take the place.
On the 15th day of February, 1865,
eighteen students fifteen more than
were greeted by Father Pearce in Lex
ington, when the first Normal School
of Massachusetts was opened, and one
less than President Hovey had at the
beginning of the Illinois Normal Uni
versity were gathered in a room be
longing to the district school of Empor
ia. With them was one teacher. Out
of doors were all sorts of rumors con
cerning an expected rebel invasion from
Texas, and another ot Indians from the
Territory. In doors, the eighteen stu
dents had settees, borrowed from a
neighboring church ; the teacher's seat
was a chair borrowed from the county
treasurer's offioe. There were two
stoves in the room, no teacher's desk or
other furniture, no text-books, maps, or
other appliances. The parable of the
sower was read, the Lord's Prayer re
peated and so the Normal school of
Kansas was opened. All were hopeful,
and ere long, hard at work. Very soon
the school room was well seated, and
reasonably well furnished. The nam
ber of students increased day by day,
until there were forty-two ; and all were
earnest, faithful and enthusiastic. The
discipline was all that could be wished,
and little said about it. The school was
much visited and much talked about, at
home and in the newspapers.
The first term closed in J une, after a
session of nineteen weeks. The Board
of Visitors appointed by law to report
their views with regard to the "condi
tion, success and usefulness" of the in
stitution, was in attendance throughout
the examination, which lasted two days.
Its discriminating and able report, pre
sented to the legislature, did much to
ward confirming public opinion in favor
of the school. Judge L. D. Bailey, of
the supreme court, was chairman of this
board. Hon. I. T. Goodnow, State Su
perintendent of public instruction, at
this time favored the students with an
address. Tho anniversary oration was
pronounced by his honor Judge Brewer,
of Leavenworth. The attendance of
the educational men of the state was
large, and the harvest of good words
not small.
The summer a vacation was spent in
planning the next year's work. A more
extended circular was issued, and quite
generally distributed. Notices of the
school appeared in mo6t of the state pa
pers. Prof. H. B. Norton, graduate of
the Illinois Normal University, accept
ed the position of Associate Principal.
The State Teachers' Association, under
the presidency of U. D. McCarty, of
Leavenworth, granted to the Normal
School a kindly recognition, by a reso
lution expressing their sense of its im
portance, and recommending it to the
confidence of friends of education
throughont the state.
The first term's work was regarded
but as a trial of the machinery. Mr.
Goodnow, the state superintendent, re
ported to the -legislature concerning it :
"The school opened as an experiment,
And is demonstrated a success." The
second term began about the middle of
September, 18G5. The same students
were present as during the first term,
with an addition to their number, mak
ing in all, sixty. Nothing occurred
during the year to interrupt the har
mony of the school, or prevent the suc
cessful working of all connected with
it. The number of students for the
year was eighty-five. There were three
terms, the last closing in June. The an
niversary oration at this term was giv
en by Mr. Norton, Mr. Goodnow again
addressed the students. The closing
exercises were reported in all the prin
cipal state papers.
By reason of the increasing number
of students, making the apartments
then in use entirely inadequate to the
wants of the school, it was decided to
ask the state for an appriation to con
struct a building, which, answering the
purposes of a school for a few yearst
might then be set apart for the use of
the Model School department, without
loss to the state. - This was in the win
ter of 18C5-6. The legislature, through
the influence of Hon. C V. EsEridge,
slate senator, and Hon. Jacob Stotler
member of the House, very willinglv
acceded to the request, and authorized
the board of directors to construct a
suitable edifice at the state's expense.
This was done. The building; was ar
ranged with special reference to the
wants of a teachers' school, and has
proved well adapted to the purpose for
which it was designed. Utility and
economy of construction were before
the minds of the board of directors,
rather than beauty and architectural fin
ish ; still the latter were not ignored.
The architect's plan and specifications,
were made out by T. II. Lescher, Esq.,
of Lawrence ; Mr. John Hammond, of
Emporia, was the builder.
From the Principal's report for 1866,
is taken the following passage, as a brief
exposition of the essential eharacteris
tics of the school : "In the Normal
School the same means are employ
ea in tne education or its students, as
in other Institutions of learning. The
same kinds of text-books are used,
classes are formed in the same way, and
recitations conducted as is usual. There
is this important difference, however :
in other schools the end to be attained in
each recitation is a knowledge, on the
part of the student, of the principles
under consideration. In the Normal
School this thorough understanding of
the lesson is but the means ; the end is
the ability to teach the same principles
to others. In the Normal class-room
the student is required to analyize each
mental process by which ho arrives at
conclusions ; and the question is ever
before him, how can the demonstration
be divided into parts, so that each shall
be within reach of the child's mind ; and
then what is the logical order of ar
rangement by which these may be put
together so that the pupil may be able
to grasp the whole, and also be able to
trace the relations of the parts, each to
the others. The art of teaching every
branch of study pursued, may therefore,
be mentioned as a distinctive feature of
the teachers' school."
Extracts are also presented from the
report of II. I. Fisher, of Lawrence ;
Judge Aiken, of Council Grove ; and S.
S. Prouty, of the Burlington Patriot,
Board of Visitors for 1866, to show the
man agement and condition of the school
at the time of the official visit, which
was in December of that year, during
one of the ordinary working days of
the term : "One of your committee has
visited the school on previous occasions,
and can speak from actual observation
when asserting that It is in better condi
tion now than at any former time. The
number of pupils enrolled for the pres
ent term is seventy-five. Now, as here
tofore, the order and discipline of the
school is above all criticism. The ut
most quiet and decorum prevailed
throughout. Teachers aud pupils ap
peared thoroughly in earnest. All things
moved with absolute, mechanical pre
cieion. There was no trace of the spirit
ot mischief, disorder and indolence,
which so mars and belittles the great
majority of our educational institutions,
Regarded merely as a model for other
schools of the State, a means for incit
ing otner teaciiers to like triumphs in
order and educational exelleuce, our
Normal School is worth, ten times over,
all it has cost us. It is now approach
ing the close of its second year. Many
pupils have been in attendance during
this period. The effect of these years
of training is shown in the steady de
velopment of the elements of scholarly
excellence. There was a greater free
dom of speech than formerly ; a keener
and subtler appreciation of obscure and
difficult topics ; more vigorous and orig
iual thoughts ; a better mastery of eye
and hand in all the departments of
graphical illustration."
Another extract from the same report,
will show something of the conduct,
recitations, and the class drill so charac
teristic of Normal Schools, and so nec
essary to the teacher. The instructor
must learn to talk, and to illustrate.
"One of the most immediately notice
able points, was tho rigid persistence
with which the topical system of recita
tion wa enforced. The old stereotyped
system of questions and answers was
utterly discarded. Topics, a ft en con
sisting of a single word, were assigned
to pupils ; and each, without the slight
est reference to text book or raemor
anda, was required to rise, and develop
the leading points of it in his own lan
guage, and in proper consecutive order,
with constant and copious blackboard
illustrations. For example, the topic
assigned to the pupil might be The
Andes.' He was required to sketch
upon the board a complete map of that
system of mountains, with all their ira
portant ramifications, the valleys, plat
eaus and lakes they enclose, and rivers
flowing from them; to describe the
height of all the different chains, and
principal peaks, to give the local names,
latitude and longitude, altitude, climate
and special characteristics of all the dif-
ferent points of the map. When all
this has been done, the topography of
th rpcrinn in nniai!nn i, UraA in hnii
and indelible relief unon the mind of
the pupil."
The dedication of the Normal School
building, was on the 2d day of January,
1867, at the opening of the second term
01 mat scnoot year. $id,bou.uu was
the entire cost of the building to the
State. One paragraph is quoted from
the address of President Horner, of
Baker University, at the dedication :
"in the erection or these massive
walls, iu the completion of this fair fab
ric, this ornate temple of learning, the
intelligence of our people, and the wis
dom of our legislators have forged
another, and the brightest, link in our
educational system. Intimately con
nected as it is, with the welfare
and success of our common schools,
the grand basis upon which rests
the superstructure of onr education
al system, and the crowning glory
of our civilization, it is, and most
ever continue to be, the pride and glory
of our people. Already it is infusing
into our common schools the healthful,
invigorating influence of its teaching,
It will elevate the teacher's humble call
ing to its proper place In the ranks of
the learned professions. Its mission is
to supply skillful, trained, disciplined,
professional teachers for the thousand
schools of the State. We only need
these to develop in our State a system
of education that will reflect immortal
honors upon its founders."
The Institution was now upon firm
footing. From that time is growth has
been steady and constant. Step by step,
it has kept pace with the advancement
of our young State. At the close of the
year 1S67 a class of two ladies was
graduated. On the opening of the
school in September of that year, the
increased attendance rendering it neces
sary, another teacher was added to the
Faculty Sirs. J. H. Gorham, of the Illi
nois Normal University. At the same
time the organization of the school was
completed by the establishing of the
Model Department. The nnmber of
pupils was limited to thirty, as only
that number could be accommodated in
the room fitted np for that purpose, in
the second story of the Normal bui'd
Ing. At tbs eloM of the year, as shown
by the Principal's Report, there were in
the Normal Department one hundred
and twenty-five students, and ia both
departments one hundred and fifty-two.
A class of four young ladies graduated
this year. President Edwards, of the
Illinois Normal University, was present
at the Commencement Exercises, and
gave the Anniversary Address. School
closed late in J nne of 1868, to give the
teachers from the Agricultural College
at Manhattan, the State University at
Lawrence, and representatives of other
prominent educational institutions
throughout the State an opportunity to
visit, insnpt-t. and strwlv its wnrlrintrs
an opportunity of which they were not I
slow to avail themselves. AH express
ed their appreciation of the school and
its rosults, in the highest terms.
In the fall of 1868, it became neces
sary to increase the r acuity, and Miss
M. J. Watson, a member of the first
graduating class, accepted the position.
Miss Ellen Plumb, the other member of
the same class, now took charge of the
Model Department, and the School
moved on. At the close of the year, in
June. 1SC9. a class of nine was srradua,
ted. Hon. T. D. Thacher, delivered the
Anniversary Address.

CONCLUSION.-
I conclude this report by assuring
you, Uentlemen or the Board of L)i
rectors, of my high appreciation of the
unwearied efforts put forth by the Ex
ecutive Committee of your Honorable
Body, for the advancement of the best
interests of the Normal School. To
them much of the credit for the unpre
cedented prosperity which has attended
the institution throughout the year, is
certainly due.
Thanking you iu the name of the
Faculty for the uniform courtesy ex
tended to all the teachers, I beg leave to
subscribe myself.
Your obedient servant,
L. B. KELLOGG, Principal
From our Traveling Correspondent.
BUTLER COUJJTT TROUBLES.
Having just arrived from Butler Co.,
we teel that it 13 due to the people of
that part of Kansas, for ns to give a fair,
impartial account 01 uie situatiuu uivre
at present. We learn with regret that
the opinion prevails throughout the
country that intense excitement and
anarchy reigns not only in Butler, bat
also in Sedgwick and Cowley counties.
Immigrants are being turned away from
that locality, under the impression that
their lives and property will be taken
by the mob as soon as they arrive.
The operations of the vigilance com
mittee have been confined strictly to
one little neighborhood in and around
the village of Douglass, and all is quiet
there at present. It is generally sup
posed that Augusta has taken an actiye
part in this affair; such is not the case.
We never saw a more quiet orderly town
anywhere. Only once was there any
excitement, and then it lasted only a
few hours, caused by some reports, by
irresponsible persons purporting to have
come from Douglass. The more recent
excitement has been confined to Eldora
do, aud was caused by the flying rumors
that the town, and lives and property of
iome of the most prominent citizens of
the place, were threatened. It was ira
possible to trace this report to any reli
able source. Eldorado alone knew of
the excitement, (last Sunday night.)
Augusta and Douglass heard of it the
following day. After conversing with
such men as Judge Aiken, Capt Shan
non, Col. Baker, C. N. James and oth
ers, of the best citizens of Butler coun
ty, we are satisfied that any ene wish
iug to visit that locality can do so with
as much safety as they would visit a
church in any eastern State.
We noticed that the farther we trav-
eled from the neighborhood of Doug-1
lass, the more rumors we heard about
the country being in arms. This is false,
as are most of the rumors now circulat
ing in Empora. J. A. II.

Tocbs, Dec. 6. Gen. Paladines has
retreated from Orleans with a force be
lieved to be 200,000 strong. lie had 500
cannon. The government authorities
wished him to remain at Orleans and
receive the Prussian attack, but they
gave way to the General's opinion that
the city was untenable. Subsequently
the General fought to the utmost, bnt
was powerless to effect anythine. At
half-past 11 o'clock the Germans de-
manded the evacuation of the city,
threatening to bombard it in case of re
fusal. The Prussians captured but few
prisoners and no ammunition.
Tours. Dec. 5. A dispatch says the
German forces engaged in battle yester
day embraced the united armies of
Frederick Charles, third, ninth and
tenth corps, two infantry and two cav
alry divisions, lu all I;jU,0UU men. Tr.c
French force consisted of six corps, ag
irreiratinsr 160.000. but was deficient in
cavalry. The combat ended with a re
pulse on Sunday. The battle commenc
ed on Thursday and continued with va
rying success during Friday and Satur
day, but bunday the success or tne uer-
mans was great tuougn purcnasea at
great cost.
Communication with Tours, partly by
carriers has been re-established, sun-
later Washburn's Secretary writes from
Paris that according to his information
the French have been beaten at all
points bnt one, and the end is apparent
