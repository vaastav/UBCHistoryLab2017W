much counsel as to the plans that
and which we have yet to shape and
determine.
A year ago we had sent 145.918
men overseas. Since then we have
sent 1,950,513, an average of 162,542
each month, the number in fact rising
in May last to 245,951; in June to
278,760; in July to 307.1S2, and con
tinuing to reach similar figures in
August and Septembei in August
289,670, and in September 257,438.
No such movement of troops ever
took place before, across three thou
sand miles of sea, followed by ade
quate equipment and supplies and
carried safely through extraordinary
dangers of attack dangers which
were alike strange and infinitely dif
ficult to guard against. In all this
movement only 758 men were lost by
enemy attacks 630 of whom were
upon a single English transport,
which was sunk near the Odkney
islands.
I need not tell you what lay back
of this great movement of men and
material.
It is invidious to say that back of
it lay a supporting organization of the
industries of the country and all its
productive activities more complete,
more thorough in method, and effec
tive in results, more spirited and
unanimous in purpose and effort than
any other great bellgerent had ever
been able to effect.. We profited
greatly by the experience of the na
tions which had already been engaged
for nearly three years in the exigent
and exacting business, their every re
source and every executive profici
ency taxed to the utmost. We were
the pupils. But we learned quickly
and acted with a promptness nnd a
readiness of co-operation that justify
our great pride that we were able to
serve the world with. ;unparalelled
energy and quick accomplishment.
Metal of Soldiers lraiHl.
Hut it is not the physical scale and
executive efficiency of preparation,
supply, equipment and despatch that
I would dwell upon, but the mettle
and quality of the officers and men
we sent over and of the sailors who
kept- the seas, and the spirit of the
nation that stood behind them. No
soldiers or sailors ever proved them
selves more quickly ready for the test
of batt'le of acquitted themselves with
morer splendid courage- and achieve
ment when put to the test. Those of
us who played some part in directing
the" great processes by which the war
was pushed irresistibly forward to the
- final triumph may now forget all that
and delight our thoughts with the
Rtory of what our men did,. Their
officers understood the grim and ex-
- acting task they had undertaken and
performed with audacity, efficiency
and unhesitating courage that touch
the story of convoy nnd- battle witn
imperishable distinction at every turn,
whether the enterprise were groat or
small from their chiefs.. Pershing
and Sims, down to the youngest lieu

Just what it is they would accom
plish! I am proud to be the fellow
countryman of men of such stuff and
valour. Those of us who stayed at
home did our duty; the war could not
"' have been won or the gallant men
who fought it given their opportunity
to win it otherwise; but for many a
- long day we shall think ourselves
i "accursed we', were not there, and

- those days of triumphant battle will

' graves; and each will have his favor

! shall he forgot, but tie'll remember
with, advantages, what feats he, did

What we all thank God for with
- deepest gratitude Is that our men

labors day after day. month after J .S2
month, have made thein fit mates and
comrades of the men in the trenches
and on the sea. And not the men
here in Washington only. They have
but directed the vast achievement.
Throughout innumerable factories,
upon innumerable farms, in the
depths of coal mines and Iron mines
nnd copper mines, wherever the stuffs
of industries were to be obtained and
prepared, in the shipyards, on the
railways, at the docks, on the sea, in
every labor that was needed to sus
tain the battle lines, men have vied
with each other to do their part and
do it well. 1
lVaises Women.
They can look anv man-at-arms In
the face and say: "We also- strove j
to win una gave the best tnav was in
us to make our fleets and armies
sure of their triumph." And what
shall we sav of the women of their
instant intelligence, quickening every
task that they touched; their capacity
for . organization and co-operation
which gave their action discipline and
enhanced the effectiveness of every
thing they attempted; their aptitude
at tasks to which they had never be
fore set their hands; their utter self
sacrifice alike in what they did and
in what they gave. Their contribu
tion to the great result is beyond ap
praisal. They have added a new
lustre to the annals of . American
womanhood.
The least tribute we can pay them
is to make them the equals of men
in political rights as they have
proved themselves their equals in
every field or practical worn tney
have entered, whether for themselves
or for their country. These great
days of completed achievement would
be sadly marred were we to omit
that act of Justice. Besides the Im
mense practical services they have
rendered, the women of the country
have been the moving spirits in the
systematic economies by which our
people have voluntarily assisted to
supply the suffering peoples of the
world , and the armies upon every
front with food and everything .else
that we had that . might . serve the
common cause. The details of such
a story can never be fully written,
but we carry them at our hearts and
thank God that we can say that we
are the kinsmen of such. - '
And now we are sure of the great
triumph for which every sacrifice
was male. -.. It has come, come in Its
completeness and with the pride and
inspiration of these days of achieve
ment quick within us we turn to the
tasks of peace again a peace sure
against the violence of irresponsible
monarchs and ambitious military co
teriesand make ready for a new
order, for now foundations of justice
and fair dniling. .
We are about to givo order and or
ganization to this peace not only for
ourselves, but for the other peoples
of the world as well, so far. as they
will suffer us to serve them. It is in
ternational Justice that we seek, not
domestic, safety merely. Our" thoughts
have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon
Asia, upon the near and the far east.
very little upon the acts of peace and
accommodation that wait to be per
formed at our own doors. While we
are adjusting our relations with the
rest of the. world Is it not of capital
importance that we should clear away
all grounds of misunderstanding with
our ' immediate neighbors and give
proof of the friendship we really feel
t hope that the members, of the sen
ate will permit, me to speak once
more of the unratified .-. treaty of
friendship and adjustment with the
republic of Colombia.-. I very earnest
ly urge upon them an early and fa
vorable action upon that vital matter.
I believe that they will feel, with, me,
that the stage of affairs is now set
for such action as will be not only
Just, but generous and in the spirit of
many agencies by which to direct the
Industries of the country in the serv
ices it was necessary for them to ren
der, by which to make sure of an
abundant supply of the materials
needed, by which to check undertak
ing that could for the time be dis
pensed with and stimulate those that
were most serviceable in war, by
which to gain for the purchasing de
partments of the government a cer
tain control over the prices of essen
tial articles and materials, by which
to restrain trade with alien enemies,
make the most of the available ship
ping and systematize financial tran
sactions, both public and private, so
that there would be no unnecessary
conflict or confusion by which, ; in
short, to put every material energy
of the country in harness to draw the
common loud and make of us one
team in the accomplishment of a
great task, But , the moment we
knew the armistice to have been
signed we took the harness off. Haw
materials upon .which the govern
ment had kept Its hand for fear there
should not be enough for the indus
tries that supplie! the armies have
heen released and put into the gen
eral market again. Oreat industrial
plants whose whole output and ma
chinery had heen taken over for the
uses of the government have been set
free to return to the uses to which
they were put before the war. It has
not been possible to remove so read
ily or so quickly the control of food
stuffs and of shipping, because the
world has still to be fed from our
granaries and the ships are still need
ed to send supplies to our men over
seas and to bring the men back as fast
as the disturbed conditions on the
other side of the water permit: but
even there restraints are being re
laxed as much as pofsible and niore
and more as the weeks go by, ,
Never before have there been
agencies in existence in this country
which, knew so much of the field of
supply, of labor and of industry as
the war industries board the war
trade board,.- the labor department,
the food administration and the fuel
administration have . known since
their labors became thoroughly sys
tematiised; and they have not been
Isolated agencies; they have been di
rected by men w!i represented, the
permanent . departments of the gov
ernment and so have been the centers
of unified and cooperative' action. It
has been the theory of the executive
therefore,, since the armistice, wan as
sured, (which is in effect a complete
submission of the enemy), to put the
knowledge of these bodies at the dis
posal of the business men of the
country and to offer their intelligent
mediation at every point and In every
matter where it was desired. It is
surprising how fast the process of re
turn to a peace footing has moved In
the, three weeks since the fighting
stopped. It promises to outrun anv
Inquiry that may be instituted anl
any aid that may be offered. It will
not he easy to direct It any better
than it will direct itself. The Ameri
can business man is of quick initia
tive.
Th ordinarv and normal processes
of private Initiative will not, however,
provide immediate, employment for
all the men of our returning armies.
Those who, are of trained capacity,
those who are skilled workmen, thne
who Jiave acquired , familiarity with

ready and willing to go to the farms,
all thne whose aptitudes are known
or will be sought out ty employers
will find ni difficulty, It Is safe to say,
in.findinrr nlace and employment. But
there will be others who will be at a
loss where to gain a livelihood unless
pains are taken to guide them and p"t

If the war had continued It would
have been necessary to raise at least
eight billion dollars by taxation, pay
able in the year 1919, but the war
has ended and I agree with the sec
retary of the treasury - that it will
be eafe to reduce the amount to six
billions:- An Immediate rapid decline

their immediate nquiaauon win rua

tenance of our forces on the other
side of the sea is still necessary,
considerable proportion of. these
forces must remain in Europe dur
ing the period of occupation and
those which are brought home will
be transported and demobilized at
heavy expense for months to come.
The interest on our war debt must,
of course, be paid and provision

will, of course, fall ninch. below what
a continuation of military operations

addition to the four billions provided
by existing law be obtained from the
profits which have accrued and shall
accrue from war contracts and dis
tinctively war business, but that these

accruing In 191S or In 1919 from
business originating in war contracts.

will' carry out the naval program
which was undertaken before we en

the program which covers the build

These plans have been prepared
along the lines and In accordance
with the policy which the congress
established, not under the exception

intention of adhering to a definite
method of development for the navy.
