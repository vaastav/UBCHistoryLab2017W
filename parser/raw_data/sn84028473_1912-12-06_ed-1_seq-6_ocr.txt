Greece the dispatch adds did not sign
the paper As far as the signers to
the armistice are concerned Greece is
left to continue the war against Tur

London Dec 4 An open rupture
between Bulgaria and Greece has
again postponed the signing of the

there is an unconfirmed report ema
nating from semi ofHcial sources in
Sofia that Bulgaria will sign the pro

If she so desires
The Greeks are unalterably opposed
to granting Turkey permission to

has agreed as one of the concessions
she Is willing to make The Greek
cabinet held a long session at Ath

messenger to Constantinople bearing
despatches to the Greek representa

Chinese In United States
There appears to be no authentic
record of the first arrival of Chinese
In the United States although there
is reason to suppose that the earliest
of them landed on the Pacific coast
some time in the forties The discov
ery of gold in California was the pio
neer Incentive for the coming of
Chinese It is estimated that no
less than 10000 of them landed in
California between 1849 and 1852
One authority estimates that prior
of 1851 there were pot more than 773
Chinese in the United States The
same writer thinks they first began
coming to this country in about 1844
all landing on the Pacific coast It
is estimated that there are now 100
000 of them in this country
