THOUSANDS OF BILLS INTRODUCED
Cove--" Almost Every Phase of Public
Apairs Which Has Attracted Public
Attention—Matters Which Will
Come Before the Session.
Washington, Dec. 2.—Both houses
of congress were called to order at
noon and the fifty-seventh session was
begun most auspiciously. A large
crowd was in attendance and the usu
al scenes attendant upon the open-
ing of a session were re-enacted. Both
chambers have been redecorated and
refurnished during the recess, making
the changes made for the convenience
and comfort of the members.
The Senate.
In the senate Dietrich and Millard,
of Nebraska Gibson, of Montana, and
Kittredge, of South Dakota, were
sworn in as senators. After the usu
al resolutions and appointment of a
committee to notify the President
that the senate was in session a re
cess of thirty minutes was taken.
The senate took a further recess un
til 2 o'clock to await the organization
of the house and the appointment of a
committee to wait upon the President.
Senate Adjourns,
a* Washington, Dec. 2.—At 2 o'clock
the senate reassembled and Senator
Galble announced the death of the
late Senator Kyle, after which the
senate adjourned.
The .House.
Clerk McDowell called the House to
order at the conclusion of the roll call,
showing 318 members present. Can
non, of Illinois, nominated David B.
Henderson, of lowa, and Hay, of Vir
ginia, nominated Mr. Richardson, of
Tennessee, for speaker. The roll call
for election then followed. The vote
resulted in Henderson, 190 Richard
son. 149 Stark, of Nebraska, 1 Cum
mings, of New York, 1. Henderson
was declared elected and escorted to
the chair by the other three men vot
ed for. He made a brief speech and
thanked the house for its expression
of confidence and asked the support
of all the members. The oath was
then administered by Representative
Bingham, of Pennsylvania, the speak
er administered the oath to the mem
bers-elect.
Thousands of Bills.
Several thousand bills have already
•been introduced in the House, cover
ing nearly every phase of public affairs
that has attracted interest in the coun
try. They include the Pacific cable,
oleomargarine, amending me tariff
law, repeal of the bankruptcy law, for
a reciprocity commission, the admis
sion of states, the establishing of a
department of commerce, amending
the currency laws, and amending the
immigration law. etc.
COMING LEGISLATION.
Main Subjects to Be Considered Are
Generally Known.
The main subjects of probable legis
lative action at the coming session arc
generally known. The trusts, internal
revenue reduction, river and harbor
improvement, construction of public
buildings, pensions, revision of the
currency and banking laws, irrigation
and insular affairs and labor legisla
tion will occupy a great deal of atten
tion.
Three other subjects, somewhat al
lied in general tenor, will also be urg
ed upon the notice of congress—pro
vision for an isthmian canal, subsidies
for the rehabilitation of the American
merchant marine and the construction
by "the government or authorization
for private laying of a Pacific cable.
The Canal.
-The canal question will certainly
prove a long and probably bitter light.
The same opposition that has met the
efforts in the pa3t to build an inter
oceanic canal will undoubtedly be ac
tively at work this session. The inter
jection of the Panama canal scheme
into the situation will not in the esti
mation of well-posted people, accom
plish the purpose for which it is al
leged to •afas«a^ate-ed. It is now
thought that congress will brush aside
the Panama schemes at once and get
down to the main question of whether
a canal shall or shall not be buiii via
tlie Nicaragua route, and upon this
the bill will be fought.
Pacific Cable.
The demand for a .Pacific cable
probably cannot longer.1 be ignored.

MISS STONE STILL LIVES.
Washington. Dec. 2.—Secretary
Hay this afternoon received a ca
blegram from Spencer Eddy, at
Constantinople, saying he received
information on what he regarded
as good authority to the effect that
Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka
are still alive.
gress upon whether the government
should build and own the cable or
whether a private corporation should
be authorized to land it. This differ
ence in opinion resulted in failure to
act. Hawaii and the Philippines are
demanding the cable, and the mercan
tile interests of the country will prob
ably bring pressure to bear upon con
gress sufficiently to force action.
Ship Subsidy.
Senator Frye of Maine and Senator
Hanna of Ohio have repeatedly de
clared during the recess that this con
gress would pass a ship subsidy bill.
The bill of last session has been modi
fled. but it cannot be told until it is
introduced and its provisions scanned
whether the modified measure meets
the objections raised against the old
law, and a member of the banking I
committee, has prepared a bill the1
a!U,.an
purpose of which is to require the sec
retarv of the treasury to exchange on'
demand gold coin for standard silver!
Reduction of War Revenue.
Tlie question whether or not the
war revenue taxes should be reduced
may lead to a lively fight among the
republican members of the house ways
and means committee. Chairman
Payne favors a material reduction and
intends to introduce a bill providing
for the cut. On the other hand, an
important faction of the committee,
led by such influential members as
Representative Hopkins of Illinois
and Representative Tawney of Minne-
sota,
the revenues until, all the govern
ment's financial necessities ahe-assert
ed and provided for.
Just _v.iiat course President Roose
velt will take respecting these many
matters will, naturally, not be known
until his message is submitted to con
gress. His intention to follow out. the
policy mapped out by President Mc
Kiniey will probably be followed,
though many republicans, as well as
democrats, seem 1o be of the opinion
that he will go a little further.
MESSAGE HAS NO SURPRISES.
Talks Over Points Freely With His
Callers.
President Roosevelt's first message
to congress will contain few or no sur
prises. He is not a man to deal in
mysteries. He talks over the points
in his message with great freedom,
and many portions have been read and
reread to his callers entirely aside
from the formal reading to his cabi
net. Most of the older senators and
representatives are entirely familiar
not only with the treatment but with
the actual working of the message in
those parts in which they are especial
ly interested.
There is no secret of the fact that
the message is already in type and in
possession of the press associations. It.
would be a breach of confidence to
forecast the message at length, except
for the fact that, the contents of the
document have been freely discussed
before. President Roosevelt will not
hesitate to say that some trusts may
be exceedingly dangerous. He will
not attack all combinations of capital
by any means, but he will strongly
urge that the nation insist on the right
to supervise the trusts as it does the
national banks and see that t'.ie inter
ests of the stockholders and customers
are both safe.
The President will tell congress in
so many words that, ordinary courtesy
to foreign nations requires that the
reciprocity treaties negotiated with
them in good faith should either be
ratified or rejected without delay. He
will make his position on this point
«t.
both pointed and public. Tie will fa
vor the general principle of reciprocity
without hesitation, and will specifical
ly urge the granting of concessions to
Cuba. Congress will be told that the
Niearaguan canal negotiations have
been entirely successful, ana the Pres
ident will announce the completion of
the report of the canal commission, an
outline of which was sent to congress
a year ago.
The President will favor Chinese ex
clusion, a revision of the immigration
laws, government aid for the irriga
tion of arid lands, and the creation of
a new government, department of com
merce and industry. The message
will formally announce that a new na
tion is about to be born, and that the
republic of Cuba, if all goes well, will
begin its independent existence before
congress is likely to adjourn.
