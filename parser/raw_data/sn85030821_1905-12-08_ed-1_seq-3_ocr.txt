PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO THE
' NATIONAL CONGRESS.
WOULD FIX R. R. SATES
Goes at the Abuses Against the Law
of the Land in a Bare-list
"Fashion.
RAILWAY RATES.
" I propose, not a commUsion
.with power to initiate or orijri-
nate rates generally, but to reg- --
ulate a rate already fixed or ori- ---
ginated by tlie roads, upon com-
plaint and after Investigation."
INSURANCE.
"Tlie United States should fol--
low the policy of other nations
by providing adequate national
supervision of commercial inter-
ests which are clearly national in --
character."
Washington, Dec. 5. President
Roosevelt, in his annual message, sent
to congress today, comes out squarely
for a commission with power to es
tablish maximum railway rates.
This is the most important point in
the message. Second only to it is a
recommendation for federal control of
life Insurance.
The president leads up to these two
points by a geneial discussion of cor
porations and corporate rights, in
which he recommends federal control
If necessary, by constitutional amend
ment. The message says:
"The fortunes amassed through cor
porate organization are now so large,
and vest such power in those that
wield them, as to make it a matter of
necessity to give to the sovereign that
is, to the government, which repre
sents the people as a whole some ef
fective power of supervision over their
corporate use,
"Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac
tion. I believe that thi3 regulation
and a supervision can be obtained by
the enactment of law by the congress.
If this proves impossible, it will cer
tainly be necessary ultimately to con
fer in fullest form such power upon
the national government by a proper
amendment of the constitution.
Practical Problem.
"The department of justice has for
the last four years devoted more at
tention to the enforcement of the anti
trust legislation than to anything else.
Much has been accomplished; parti
cularly marked has been the moral
effect of2the prosecutions; but it is in
" creasingly evident that there will be a
very insufficient beneficial result in the
waji of economic change.
"Until the national government ob
tains in some manner which the wis
dom of the congress may suggest,
proper control over the big corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
that i3 over the great majority of the
big corporations it will be impossible
to deal adequately with these evils."
Rates and Rebates.
Coming directly to the question of
railway rates and rebates, the message
says:
"The most pressing need, so far as
legislation i3 concerned, is the enact
ment Into law of some scheme to se
cure to the agents of the government
iuch supervision and regulation of the
rates charged by the railroads of the
country engaged in interstate traffic
as shall summarily and effectively
prevent the imposition of unjust or
unreasonable rates. It must include
putting a complete stop to rebates in
every shape and form.
Maximum Rates.
"The first consideration to be kept
in mind is that the power should be
affirmative and should b given to
some administrative body created by
the congress. If given to the present
Interstate commerce commission or to
a reorganized interstate commerce
commission, such commission should
be made unequivocally administrative.
It is not mj province to indicate the
exact terms of the law which should be
enacted, but in my Judgment the most
important provision which such law
should contain is that conferring some
competent, administrative body the
power to decide, upon the case being
brought before it, whether a given
rate prescribed by a railroad Is rea
sonable and just, and if it is found to
be unreasonable and unjust, then aft
er full investigation of the complaint,
to prescribe the limit of rate beyond
which it shall not be lawful to go
the maximum reasonable rate, as It
is commonly caled this decision to
go Into effect within a reasonable
time and to obtain from thence on
ward, subject to review by the courts.
"It sometimes happens at present,
not that a rate is too high, but that a
favored shipper is given too low a
rate. In such case the commission
would have the right to fix this al
ready established minimum rate as
the maximum, and it would need only
one or two such decisions by the com
mission to cure railroad companies of
the practice of giving improper mini
mum rates.
" "All private car lines, industrial
roads, refrigerator charges and the
like, should be expressly put under
the supervision of the interstate com
merce commission or some similar
body so far as rates, and agreeements
practically affecting rates, are con
cerned." Insurance Regulation.
The question of the regulation of
insurance companies is handled by the
president in his usual bare-fist fash
ion. He says:
"It has been clearly shown that
certain of the men at the head of the
large corporations take but small note
of the ethical distinction between hon
esty and dishonesty; they draw the
line only this side of what may be
called law-honesty, the kind of hon
esty necessary In order to avoid fall
ing into the clutches of the law.
"As a remedy for conflicting. Inef
fective and yet burdensome state re
gulations there has been for many
years a widespread demand for fed
eral supervision. As the insurance
business has outgrown in magnitude
the possibility of adequate state super
vision, the congress should carefully
consider whether further legislation
can be had.
Toil and. Toilers.
One of the largest sections of the
president's message Is devoted to la
bor. As to the power of injunction,
t . . -r ni f-r- .-'- T
ing courts of the power to issue In
junctions in labor disputes. Such spe
cial limitation of the equity powers of
our courts would be most unwise. The
remedy is to regulate the procedure
by requiring the judge to give due no
tice to the adverse parties before
granting the writ, the hearing to be
ex parte if the adverse party does
not apppear at the time and place or
dered.' Women Workers.
The message also recommends an
investigation of child and woman la
bor in the several states and adds:
"The introduction of women into in
dustry is working change and disturb
ance in the domestic and social life
of the nation. The decrease in mar
riage, and especially in the birth rate,
has been coincident with it. This
whole matter in reality forms one of
the greatest sociological phenomena of
our time: it is a social question of
the first importance, of far greater
importance than any merely political
or economic question can be; and to
solve it we need ample data."
Tariff and Money.
The tariff problem is discussed un
der the head of Revenue.
The message says:
"Last year there was a deficit. Un
less our expenditures can be kept with
in the revenues then our revenue laws
must be readjusted. It is as yet too
early to attempt to outline what shape
-uch a readjustment should take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
:here will be need for it. It would, in
my judgment, be well to endeavor to
: i ng about closer commercial connec
: on-; w th the other peoples of this
'ntisient."
Currency.
"Every consideration of prudence
demands the addition of the element
of elasticity to our currency system.
The evil does not consist In an inade
quate volume of money, but in the
rigidity of this volume, which does
not respond as it should to the vary
ing needs of communities and of sea
sons. Inflation must be avoided; but
.some provision should be made; so
that the currency will contract against
speculation, and will expand for the
needs of legitimate business."
Points in Brief.
Other salient points of the presi
dent's message follow:
Corruption.
I recommend the enactment of a
law directed against bribery and cor
ruption in federal elections.
Alaska.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be
given an elective delegate. Some per
son should be chosen who can speak
with authority of the needs of the territory-Capital
in Islands.
In the proper desire to prevent the
islands being exploited by speculators
and to have them developed in the In
terest of their own people an error has
been made in refusing to grant suf
ficient liberal terms to induce the In
vestment of American capital in the
Philippines and in Porto Rico.
Consular Force.
Our consular force should be classi
fied and appointments should be made
to the several classes, with authority
to the executive to assign the mem
bers of each class to duty at such
posts as the interests of'the service
require.
Porto Rico.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
Hawaii.
In my judgment immediate steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Hawaii.
Pure Food.
I recommend that a law be enacted
to regulate intersetate commmerce in
misbranded and adulterated foods,
drinks and drugs.
Ship Subsidies.
Even on the Pacific, where our ships
have held their own better than on
the Atlantic, our merchant flag is now
threatened through the liberal aid be
stowed by other governments on their
own steam lines.
Peace Conference.
I most earnestly urge that this na
tion do all in its power to try to fur
ther the movement and to make the
result of the decisions of The Hague
peace conference effective. If possi
ble, there should be a general arbitra
tion treaty negotiated among all the
nations represented at the conference.
Army.
No local interests should be allowed
to stand in the way of assembling the
greater part of the troops which
would at need form our field armies
in stations of such size as will permit
the best training to be given to the
personnel of all grades, including the
high officers and staff officers.
Public Lands.
The honest disposal and right use
of the remaining public lands is of
fundamental importance. The iniqui
tous methods by which the monopo
lizing of the public lands is being
brought about under the present laws
are becoming more generally known,
but the existing laws do not furnish
effective remedies.
Navy.
It does not seem to me necessary
that the navy should at least in the
immediate future be Increased be
yond the present number of units.
What is now clearly necessary is to
substitute efficient for Inefficient units.
Probably the result would be attained
by adding a single battleship to our
navy each year.
National Parks.
In my judgment the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado should be made into
a national park. Nothing should be
allowed to interfere with the preserva
tion of Niagara Falls in all their beau
ty and majesty.
Panama Canal.
The American people is pledged to
the speediest possible construction of
a canal adequate to meet the demands
which the commerce of the world will
make upon it, and I appeal most earn
estly to the congress to aid in the ful
fillment of the pledge. Gratifying pro
gress has been made during the past
year, and especially during the past
four months. The greater part of the
necessary preliminary work has been
done.
I all delivery lias been mad5
with a fine stock of Trees.
Now give your order early for
spring season.
