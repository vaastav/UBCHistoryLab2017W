PROCLAMATION TO SGHOOL
TEACHERS
This year's work of tho rural school
teacher Is now drawing to a close.
As special frlonds of tho rural teach
er wo are glad to send a fow words
of good chocr and congratulations and
suggestion.
First of all, wo suggest that every
teacher should tako a quiet hour to
think over and perhaps to put down
on paper tho successes and failures of
this term's work thus far. Bome of
your moro thoughtful pupils and pa
trons are doing this, no doubt, and
each ono of you ought to "alio up"
your own work and put an estimate
upon 1L How docs my work comparo
with that of last yearT How does my
work comparo with that of other
tcachors? And there Is a much moro
Important question than cither of
these How docs my work compare
with tho highest standards of excel
lence! When you havo mado these compari
sons we suggest that you doublo up
your fist and pound on tho desk and
inako a stout resolution that you will
bring up tho average of your work
by extra diligence, wUdom and skill
during tho closing weeks. You will
havo extra difficulties theso last
weeks, but do not surrender to them.
Make a new canvass of your district
and urgo the parents to provide such
clothing that tho children can continue
In school. And then get Prof. DIna
more's book on "TVachlng a District
School" and read tho chapter on
'Keeping up tho Interest."
You ought to bo now well started
In plaiiB for your closing exhibition.
Iiy no means think .of such a thing
as cudlng tho school without an
exhibition. Don't "flzzlo out" but
end your work In a cloud of glory.
Nothing will hold tho Interest so
well as an exhibition. Don't let any
body discourage- you. People will say
'"It Is dangerous to hold an exhibition,
rude men and boys will break it up."
Don't you bcllovo thorn. There are
plenty of good law and order people
your district and it will do them
to show their power to keep
order, I'coplo will tell you that tho

PRESIDENT'S LETTER TO PARENTS
I have been disappointed in my
hope of making a trip through Ken
tucky this fall. I greatly desired to
do this, especially for tho purposo of
holding conferences with tho fathers
and mothers who aro interested In
tho education of their children. I
shull hope to do It next summer.
Hut meanwhile what about sending
our sons and daughters to school this
wlntcrT
Let mo try In a briof letter to say
soino of Uio things which I would
say If I could sit at your flrcsldo and
answer your questions.
To begin with, we wish you to thor
oughly understand that Berca College
Is tho friend of parents. This Insti
tution Is carried on for the ono pur
poso of holplng fathers and mothers
bring up their children to bo good
men and women. Wo do not succeed
with all tho young peoplo who come
to us, but wo aro proud of tho great
majority of our students who show
how much they havo been Improved
in mind and heart by their longer or
shorter stay In Dcrea.
Our first care and desire Is to
mako them good. Wo havo careful
rules to shield them from temptation
and reproach. Young men and young
wumcn are not allowed to moot or
visit In any prlvnto place. They aro
not allowed to bo out lato at night.
Thoy aro not allowed to uso liquor
or tobacco or to carry fire nrras or
to visit restaurants or places of
amusement except thoso which aro
provided by tho College.
But our great reliance Is not in
keeping them awny from bad tilings
but In getting them Interested In good
things. Our teachers are all people
of unusunl ability In this lino. We
have so many students that wo can
classify them carefully, putting each
ono with a group of others llko him
self where ho can study to tho best
advantage and keep up and be encour
aged and mako tho most rapid pro
gress. And wo have different courses to
moet tho Ustcs and talents and life
plans of different students. You will
bco theso different departments de
scribed ou pago seven, and I wish you
would read that full description of
Urrca's organization.
And then wo havo countless devices
for making good things attractive.
There Is tho music of our col lego
brass band, and Instruction In sing
ing froo for ovcry student. There aro
the groat exhibitions of stcroptlcon
views and moving plcturse In the
chapel, besides lectures and socials
and ontortalnnicnts. Thoro aro the,
gymnasium and tho athlotlo field,
tho walking parties, tho reading
rooms, tho gamo room In tho at
tic of Ladles' Hall. All these things
mako life pleasant to tho young peo
plo who como to Dcrea, and they are
so full of their school duties and their
Innocent and elovatlng pleasures that
thoy aro for tho most part delivered
from toniptatlons to things harmful.
A lady In Frankfort who had como
from Owsley county said to a group
of gentlemen thoro: "I don't know
what thoy do to mako boys good at
Horca, but I know that heaps of our
boys that went to Uerca with revolv
ers catno back with testaments."
And this leads mo to speak about
tho religious llfo at Dcrea. Wo teach
tho Dlblo to all our students. Wo
don't say anything horo about tho
matters on which Christian peoplo
differ. Wo get tho most spiritual men
wo can find from tho dlfforent church-

LAST MONTH OF COUNTRY SCHOOL
Tho country schools aro for tho most part entering on tho last
month, and everybody should tako hold and make that Inst month
tho best of the season. Trustees should -see to it thnt the school
house is comfortable and fuel provided, Parents should Ben to it
that pupils hnve sufficient clothing and are kept 'faithful in attend
ance. Do not let your boy or girl miss the best part of tho term of
schooling for this year just for tho lack of shoeB or mittens. And
above nil, the teachers must redouble their efforts to make tho school
so interesting that no boy or girl will stay awny. A good teacher is
known by the iuterest that is kept up through tho Inst month of
school.
GETREADY FOR WINTER
The farmers' summer campaign in over. All in all, it hns been n
success good crops nnd good prices. Now comes the winter siege.
We are nil of us attacked in our homes and houses by the forces of
cold, disease, nnd isolation. Sunday Schools dwindle or stop and
visits aro hard to 'make. Too often the winter is a time of misery
nnd backsliding. Here are some things which will help to make the
winter the best part of the year for each botihehold.
First, subscribe for The Citizen so you will have one fnitliful
visitor bringing nil the news nnd cheer from the great world, np mat
ter what winds may blow.
Second, get n supply of dry firewood in a dry place, so that wife
and daughter will not be exposed in stormy times.
Third, provide good shelter for the stock and farm implements.
Shelter is cheaper than fodder nnd repnirs.
Fourth, send one sou or dnuuhter to Beren for the winter term.
Such an investment will at oncu lift the whole family towards'all bet
ter things. K
Fifth, mend the rond, the church house nnd the winter over
coats so thnt you can go out with the whole family to every Sunday
School or preaching service that is maintained in your neighborhood.
Sixth, get tho loom set up in n good place so that there shull be
some fireside industries going on all winter.
Seventh, make a plan for the farmer himself to hnve some work
on hand during the winter, something every day beyond just feeding
the stock nnd getting the firewood. There is enough idle time
wasted in the winter to build all our fences, repair all our tools and
harness and make a lot of good money by shaving shingles, whittling
ax handles and other thitigs which a thrifty farmer knoushow to plan.
The Citizen woidd like to have suggestions from all its readers
as to other points in this matter of getting ready for the winter.
Roosevelt is out in h powerful article on lynching nnd the miscar
riage of justice. So far as the lynching of Negroes is concerned there
can be no excuse for a Negro offender is absolutely defenceless before
the law which is executed from first to last by the white men. Hut
In the case of white offenders lynchers are often incited by the fact that
the criminal is likely to escape justice if leftto the ordinary course of
law.

BEREA GIRLS WHO
FAMILY RECORDS
Tho above picture shows but a few
of tho Berea girls who aro descended
from men who sorved under Washing
ton In tho revolutionary war.
Tho valuo of a family record Is very
great A few years ago, in defend
ing tho character of the mountain
peoplo from calumniators In tho oth?r
parts of tho stato, Presldont Frost
took occasion to Investigate tho Ques
tion of ancestry and found that a
largo proportion of tho people of the
mountain counties of Kentucky may
claim descent from Revolutionary
soldiers. Soma years ago The Citizen
published the namo of over four hun
dred families that wero drawing pen
sions on account of Revolutionary uer-
vlco as lato as 1831.
A family record often helps to
traco property; and It always helps
towards things moro precious than
property, llko affection, a good namo
and tho famo of public service.
Tho record jo f each family ought to
bo Inscribed in tho blank leaves of
tho family Bible, tho namo of tho
husband, with tho date and jdaeo of
his birth and tho namo and rcsldcnco
of his father, and tho maiden name
and early homo of his mother. Then
should follow tho samo facts regard
ing tho wife, and then a list of
tho names of their children, with tho
placo and dato of each birth, and
later, somo account of tho mar

these records bo mado out while the

Tho Citizen has prepared a con-
venlcnt sheet for recording one's an-
cestry nnd keeping track of ono's rel-

Small Accounts
There are many persons in this county who feel, pos
sibly, that their business does not warrant the
keeping of a bank account, but who would, in real
ity, be greatly benefitted thereby.
This is a mistaken idea. A bank account is valuable
to every person who transacts business.
You 'are enabled to keep your money where it is safe
yet it is available in part or whole at any time.
You can pay all bills by chtck. This gives you a re
ceipt for every dollar paid, for all checks are re
turned to you after having been paid by your bank.
The fact that you possess a bank account gives you a
better standing among businessmen and enables
you to establish a credit with your bank when you
have need of it.
We welcome small accounts at this bank.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Taft sent a six thousand
word message to Congress at its
first sossion. It Is entirely concerned
with the trust question. Tho message,
has been rocclvcd kindly by both
houses and parties. He has late
ly traveled fifteen thousand miles
and addressed fivo million people, but
in this terse message ho will reach
a much larger audience.
DYNAMITERS SENTENCED
James B. McNamara, charged
with tho dynamiting of the Los
Angeles Times Building, killing 1
persons, has been brought to time,
lie has confessed and received a
life sentence, and his brother, J. J.,
guilty of a similar crime, gets'
fifteen years. Murder is murder, and
that they aro prominent labor lead

sentence. California and the Feder

PERSIA IN TROUBLE
In 1907 Russia and Great Britain
agreed that their sphere of influence
in Persia should be, for Russia the
north, and for England the south.
I-ast May Mr. Morgan Shuster, an
American citizen, accepted the call
of Persia to become Its Treasurer
General. Persia has already estab
lished a Mojllss or Parliament and
this financial reform was Its second
great step forward. Mr. Shuster has
