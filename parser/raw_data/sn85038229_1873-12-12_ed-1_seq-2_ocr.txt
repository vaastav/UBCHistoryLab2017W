FRIDAY, December 1?, 1873.
The Independence of Cuba is
among the possibilities.
f The inauguration of Governor
Allen will take place on the 12th of
January.
Hon. Chas. Iostek, occupies a
position on the Committee on Ways
and Means.
Pjendleton, of Maine, has return
ed the ewag. He only found out be
didn't want it on the 2Cth nit, II
wanted to keep Thanksgiving tlay
and couldn't keep both, so he return
ed the hack pay.
Dawis, Kelliy, Gabfielu, bco
field, retain their old places on the
Standing Committees of the House.
Blaino has considered their services
of too much importance to the coun
try, to yield to the pressure for their
removal.
Hon. Martin Wklker has been
chosen to fill the position made va
cant by resignation of Judge Sher
man, The appointment is a fitting
one, and no one need fear that the
judicial ermine will be soiled while
worn by Judge Sherman s successor,
The lessees of the Ohio Canals
report that the years business oa the
canals of the State has resulted in
actual loss of many thousands ol
douars, and that they will have to
borrow money to make necessary
repairs to be ready for spring navi
gation.
lu Board of rablic WorKs in
making their report to the Govern
or, say that a new bridge is needed
over the Sandusky river, at FremoDt,
on the W. R. & M. R. Yes, badly
needed, and if the State will do its
duty to its people, anew one will
be built, the coming year.
The Secretary of the Treasury's
repot gives the total net expendi
tures, exclusive of the public debt,
at 1290,345,245. This is the appar
ent expenditure of the government.
The actual disbursements for the
year, which are found by the deduc
tion of repayments to appropriations
in excess of expenditures, appear by
the figures made up at the Treasury
to be about $20,000,000 less, or $270,
633,327. Thk Virginius has not yet been
surrendered, and the Spanish gov
ernment now claims it is not obliged
to surrender her before the 18th. An
effort has been made by Spanish au
thority to have the delivery changed
bo that the vessel might remain in
neutral hands until the matter of
ownership could be determined. Our
government insisted on the original
agreement, and hence the claim that
Spain was not obliged to make the
delivery before the 18th.
Thb House has passed a bill de
claring general amnesty. The salary
grabber Wood, who ,was the Demo
cratic candidate for speaker of the
House, voted aginst the bill. De
xnocracy has all along been clamor
ing for general amnesty, and when
it was offered, their representative
man voted against it. It 5s pretty
hard work generally to find a Demo
crat stick to anything but spoils,
though they did stick pretty well to
the rebel side of the question during
the war.
The strongest evidenc that the
panic has spent 'itself, and reaction
has set in, is given in the fact that
mills in Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts which suspended operations
under the influence of the shock are
resuming operations. The New
Tork Times has reports from all the
manufacturing districts of Pennsyi
vania, and the Lowell Courier from
points in Massachsetts, which main
tain that such is the case. In the
main, work has been resumed at a
light reduction in the wages of la
bor.
The Constitutional Convention
met on the 3d, but did nothing but
get ready. On the 4th, the Judic
iary article was considered and some
progress made. On the 3tb, muoh
time was spent on tbe subject of the
official printing, which some mem
bers wished to have done in Cincin
nati. The free pass system, gift3,
&c, from railroads consumed the bal
ance of the day. The subject ot
mileage, and county and township
organizations occupied Monday, but
the amount of progress made was
insignificant.
The New York World says, and it
ought to be authority with Demo
crats, that "No Salary Grabber is a
Democrat." And yet every Demo
crat in the House, except four, vot
ed for Fernando Wood for speaker.
Two of these only voted for Cox, who
had repudiated the steal, while 77
voted for Fernando, who not only
took but kept the grab, the increase
salary, and still takes all he can get.
The World's enunciation is Demo
cratic in theory; Fernando's course,
and the course of those voting for
him, is Democracy in practice. The
people will recognize a slight differ
ence. Notwithstanding the strong back
ing which Mr. Creswell has obtained
for his postal telegraph and saving
bank schemes, public sentiment is
trongly set sgainst them. The Cin
cinnati Gazette ma,kes this tellintr
hit: b
Th business of the public mails is verv
large. A good business man can find a treat
field for the excise of his talents in improvine
its details. It lacks the energy, reliability
mud adaption to the popular wants, -which id
seen in the management of the teleprapb and
express. If Itx. Creswell oould devote his am
buion to doing well the work which the (rov
nuaant ha already it hands, instead of loos:
ing abroad to grasp business which is now
much better done than his own, and if he
could be content to be a Postmaster General
instead of aspiring to be a financier, he would
fee a valuable government officer.
to
The Presidents message has met
with very geaeral commendation!
Its recommendations are all that
could be desired upon financial t.nd
legislative questions, and if Con
gress puts a few, of them in good
Bhape, it will but do a duty which
the people expect. In regard to the
Virginius and Cuba, his announce
ment of the settlement of the difficul
ty between our goverment anil Spain,
was hailed with pleasure, although
doubts of the ability of Spain to en
force obedience to its mandates ob
tained, especially as the Cubans
manifested a warlike disposition, and
determination to resist the surrender
of the Virginius. Latest report?,
however, indicate that the Cuhars
have about spent their energy and
will not oppose the delivery.
The Cincinnati Qnzelte makes the
following reference to a precedent
which may possibly be followed bv
Spain in hor treatment of the Virgin
ius, for if accidents happen in the
bes', regulated Government,why not
under Spanish rule?
Tb Republic of Spain has screed to delivr
np the filibuster steamer f'irpiniu. This re
calls providential accident that happened in
a similar case. The rebel iteamer Florida had
committed very exasperating depredation! on
oor merchant ships with Ion impanitj: To
oar naval officer! it wu aggravating to see her
lying safely and defiantly in neutral ports.
Finally ous of oor ships seized her in a port
of Brazil, and brought her to Hampton Roads.
Of course it was a violation of ths jurisdiction
ot Brazil, and of course npon the requirements
of Brazil our government ogreed to deliver her
up. But during thep'rdingof this sgr.erocnt,
somehow, through awkward mannjjemc.it, or
something, one oi ur government transports
collided with the Florida and sunk her. As
our apolopy nd agreement to give her up had
satisfied te dignity of Brazil, and a tbe sink
ing of the Florida made it impossible to deliv
er her until we had fiiied her up ay in, the
natter ended there. Such a provideiiUat acci
dent may happen again.
Congress On the 3d the House
admited Geo. L. Smith, of Louisiana,
o a seat On the 4th appointed a
committee to report a bill to repeal
the salary bill, and all bills present
ed on the subject were referred.
Cox and Ncgley had a little "set to"
on the subject. Various important
bills were introduced. On the 5th
the standing committees were ap
pointed, and numerous bills referred
On the 8th a bill to remove all disa
bilities from persons who had been
engaged ia the rebellion passed, 141
to 29. The resolution of Cox to re
cognize Cuban belligerency Was re
jected 44 to 153. Committee reported
bill to repeal the Salary law, made
special order for the next day. On
the 9th bill to redeem the loan of
1858 in coin was passed, and a
spicy debate took place on the Sala
ry repeal bill.
In the Senate on the 3d but little
was done aside from introducing bills
On the 4th bill to redeem the loan of
1858 was passed, and the standing
committees were elected, when an
adjournment till Monday took place.
The 8th was taken up in introduc
ing and referring bills." On the 9th,
Morrill, of Vermont, introduced an
important bill for the resumption of
specie payment, and free banking,
and Buckingham called up his bill
for a similar purpose.
Wi take great pleasure in exhaust
ing the reports from Spain and Cuba
and the prospective war, and the na
val preparations and coast .defences
fcc., for they are so deliclously clear
that we have no trouble whatever in
making out just exactly what is to
be done and what is to be expected
There is just one little trouble about
it, however, and that lie3 in the fact
that while each day's report is clear
and lucid, each day's repoit differs
from its predecessor, and no matter
how well you may understand the
matter, it is stil' kind of muddlesome
Just for instance: Havana and th
rest of Cuba was in a blaze of war
valor, her merchants were going to
buy war vessels and fight it out on
their own hook, with the United
States and the home Government, if
necessary. That an intense war
spirit was developing in Spain, where
the President's message waa regard
ed as too much "sarse for the gan
der," and that there was to be
crises in the Spanish Cabinet be
cause Castelar was too servile; and
to mix the matter more, Sickles was
going to resign because Fish "cu
him out" and seUled matters with
Castelar through the Spanish minis
ter, without as much as "by your
leave, sir?" Then, just as we are look
ing for more blood and thunder,
along comes tbe assurance that the
Cuban blood had gone down several
degress, and because they have dls
covered that President Grant's mes
sage smelled sulphurous, they were
willing to give up the Virginius,
Then Spain would have the Virgini
us taken to that country, deliver her
over to our authorities, and put in
claims for damages to vessels. Then
againg we are assured that Captain
General Joveller cannot or will not
deliver over the Virginius, as agreed,
and Spain indicates her inability in-
ferentlly to compel obedience. And
so tue reports go, definite and yet
uncertain, clear yet unreliable.
Sumner's Bill to supply the Place of
Legal Tenders.
give below the text of Sum
ner's bill to replace the legal tender
circulation with compound interest
notes. The intention may be well
enough, and for a time the plan may
work well enough, but 'f adopted, it
cannot help but operate as a means
of contraction whenever the interest
due npon them amounts to sufficient
to justify holding, unless the public
should be obliged to estimate interest
whenever the notes pass from hand
to hand. Such a plan might work, if
provided as a means of promoting
the elasticity of our currency, by al
lowing an exchange for compound
interest notes when currency is abun
dant, and an exchange for currency,
when the supply is not ample. That,
however, we think, would be better
provided for under the suggestion of
the President in regard to the issue
and redemption of bonds :
Beit enacted, etc. That the Secretary of the
Treasury is hereby authorized and directed
prepare for circulation compound interest
notes, equal in a mount to th rtnviitnnHinCT ls ,
gal Under note and fractional currency of the I
United States, and in all respect similar to
those heretofore issued wider the act approv
ed March 3d, 183:i,entit!ed. "An act to provide
ways aud means for the support of the Gov
ernment." Bee 2. That these notes of different denom
inations, to the amount of ? '20,000,000, shall be
dated oa the first day of each month, commen
cing with the first day of July next ensuring,
when the amount named shall be ready for is
sue, and then afterward on tbe first day of
each month until the requisite amount has
been furnished.
See. 3, That the notes thus provided shall
be naid out for ail disbursements of the Trsu-
ury, except those due in coin, so long as they
are sufficient for the purpose, and if the whole
monthly instalment is not thus disposed of, it
shall be the duty el the Secretary of the Trea
sury to exchange the surplus for the present
legal tender notes.so far as practicable, that the
full sum of 20,000,000 may be put into circula
tion each month.
Sec 4. That it shall be the duty of the Sec
retary of the Treasury to cause the destruction
each month of legal tender note to an extent
equal to ths notes issued under this act.
Seo. 5. That the notes issued nnder this act
act shall, at the option of the holder, be
convertible at the end of two years, in sums of
$100 or it multiple, into bonds of the United
States not havemg less than 10 nor mora thsn
40 years to run, aud bearing interest at the
rati of fiv per centum; and the Secretary of
the Treasury is now hereby authorized to issue
such bonds.
Sec. 6. That whenever these notes, or the
bonds into which they may be converted, can
be sold at par in gold, the Secretary of the
Treasury may sell tliem in such sums as may
be called for, and apply the proceeds in gold
to cancel legal tender notes as they are paid
into the Treasury.
Sec 7. That the notes issued under this act
shall constitute no part of the legal currency
reserve required of the National banks.

As a precedent for the guidance
of our Government should Spain
prove unable to comply with her
agreement, a similar case is cited in
which Great Britain and Spain were
the parties interested. It occured in
the days of the Inquisition, when
England made & demand on Spain
for the release or some of her sub
jects. Spain replied that they were
held by the Inquisition, and she
could, not control that body. "Then
we will make war on the Inquisition,"
said John Bull. In commenting np
on the President's Message,the Lon
don Times takes the position that
Spam must show real as well as nom
inal control over Cuba, and that
England will unreservedly support
any policy calculated to require the
exercise of such power or the aban
donment of all pretense of authority
over the Island.
mere is a nice state ol anairs in
Butler county in this State. It be
ing suspected by the County Com
missioners that there might be some
irregularties in the county finances,
they employed General Godman, ex
Auditor of the State, to examine in
to the books, and lo! it appears that
the present county auditor has drawn
from the treasury for three and a half
years service $19,400 more than he
is entitled to, and that all the other
county officrs have been doing the
same thing, the total over-draft
amounting to about $30,000. Mr.
Godman is now investigating the ac
counts ten years back, which makes
a great fluttering among the ex-au
ditors, treasurers and other officials
of Butler county. Butler is a high
toned old Democratic county, giving
a Bourbon majority of about two
thousand at each election. This
must, therefore, be another case of
seduction.
Ye Olden Times.
Recently, while on a visit to Elmore, A. . Rice,
of this city, came a cross a quantity of old paper
belonging to Moses Boggs, which he has permitted
ua to examine. They are mostly papers of Ezekiel
Lamed, and as they cover a great portion of his
life, and a period embraced between 1778 and 1810,
commencing when the corntry was a dependency
or England, and closiug filer Ohio had been admit
ted to the Union, we make extracts, which we have
no doubt wi'l be read with pleasure.
The first is a bond given to secme the payment
of a sum of money, dated Oct. 17, 1772, and of even
date therewith is a mortgage, given as collateral
security, upon a tract of land in Rindge, County of
Cheshire and Province of New Hampshire. . It is
given by Ezekiel Lamed 'o George Jeffrey. The
bond is quite old and worn, bat legible, while the
mortgage, though torn and yellow vt 1th age, can be
easily read, and is written in a beautiful hand.
The next paper is one which exhibits a slight dif
ferent e In the method of doing business from what
prevail at the present. It is as follows, verbatnm:
December ye 6 i 779, t hen received a Cow of Eze-
k'el Larned, for which I promise to return the same
cow or a nother as good at the end of one year aDd
thirty wait ot good Du-tcr tor tbe nee ot said cow.
Yf said Cow dves by sickness or any acsadent I
promise t do what ia customary yn such case, as
witnes my nana, ienjamm itouiu.
On the back of that paper Is this endorsement:
Rockingham 1760 then reckned with Benjamin
Oould and fonud due me from Mr. Gould XI. 10
aud M. The use of tbe Cow ys reckned til last fall,
the time Mr Gould tuck ber.
Uext follows, in 178S, a certificate showing that
Ezekiel Larned and John Train had purchased
original right to land
The above evidently transpired while Ezekiel
was a young man, but the next shows that an in
teresting crisis In his affairs had arrived. It is dated
Claridon, September ye 6, 1783, thiB maysarttiy
that Ezekiel Larned aud Joannah Meant was .Law
ful cried by me, Stephen Arnold, 'i own L lem.
A few days later Is an order from Mr. Lamed tor a
deed necessary for the settlement of some business
entrusted to him by a friend before dying. But the
next paper is one which would be regarded as rath
er singular now-a-days:
Claridon Oct S 1788 I
For value reed Mr Zeacal Larned be pleased to
50
pay unto Judcdlah Clark seven sailings and six
pence in money, unless Mr Clark is a mind to take
it in anything else And this order is your dis
charge from yooc bumble Servant Win Rice
Soon aftor the above Mr. Larned must have
"moved West," for In Jan. 1788, we find by a paper
dated at Portsmouth (evidently Ohio) that he de
posits 27 pounds, in New York currency, to secure
the payment of 7 pounds, 1 shillings and 6 pence.
Horses, in those days were not as valuable as
they are now, as we find by the following:
I hsve sold to Ezskial Lamed a bar hone, fifteen
hands high, eleven years old, and a gray mare
fourteen and a half hands high, both marked W.
D., for thirty-five bushels com to be delivered in
Cincinnati by the 19th Inst Matt Ernst for
isov, , 17 i. wm Dean
Thirty-five bushels com would not go a great
way toward purchasing a single horse now.
In February 1797, a frisnd of his seems to have
been effected a little like people have been since
the panic set in, and makes afi earnest demand for
money.

Taxes in those day were not so much of an item
as they are in these days, s witness the following:
Rec'd Cincinnati 4th Dec 1797, of Mr Ezekiel
Larned forty three cents, and twenty-five cents for

On the Id day of April 1810, (Mr. Lamed having
deceased) Deriah Lamed was appointed Adminis
trator of his estate.
There are other papers, but what we have given
cover a period of 88 years, commencing at a time
when what i now known as Ohio was an almost
unbroken wilderness, ere the straggle for independ
ence had commenced. During that period the wai
had passed and the British grasp had been forced
from the throats of the Colonies. The Colonial
Government had sprung into existence and pasted
away, and the present government had been instl
tnted. Washington and Adam and Jefferson bad
served their respective term a President, and
Madison was in the second year of his first term.
Mighty changes had taken place between th date
of the first and last named documents, but nothing
to what has since occurred. Ohio has grown to be
the third State in the Union, and what remained of
the "Territory North-west of the Ohio," has blos
somed into populous State. Where the Indian
trail was the only connecting liok between import
ant posts, pikes have succeeded, forests have dis
appeared and cities and towns sprung into being,
roads and railways traverse the country in all direc
tions, and communications are made in a day which
at that time consumed months. The change ue
mulJtudinons, and conraaing when viewed in the
light of the past, and these old papers naturally
cal's np the contrast.
CONSUMPTION,
th scourge of th human family, may in it
arly stages be promptly arrested and perman
