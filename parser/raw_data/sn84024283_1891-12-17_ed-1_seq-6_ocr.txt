MISSOURI STATE NEWS.
St. Louis District TV. C. T. V.
The seveuth annual convention of the
St. Louis district W. C. T. U. was held
a few days since.
In Mrs. A. K. Wilson's paper on Sunday-school
work she advocated a more systematic course of
temperance teaching in the Sunday-schools.
Mrs. M. J. Gorin suggested that the secretaries
of the different unions be instructed to address
a letter every week to Mayor Noonan of St.
Louis, insisting on the enforcement of Sabbath
observance. A paper on equal suffrage was
read by Mrs. N. J. Tweed. Unlimited suffrage,
she said, meant as much for the women as for
the men, and the possession of the ballot by
the women would be a step toward the final
triumph of temperance. Mrs. Ella Wood, of
Carondelet, who read a paper on the attitude of
the church toward temperance work, criticised
-hurch people for their connection with
the saloon element. She scored those who rent
buildings for saloon purposes. A letter from a
minister who refused to join in the crusade
against tobacco brought forth hisses and cries
of '"Shame from the women present. The sub
ject of using unfermented wine in the churches
was brought np by Mrs. J. T. Field. Mrs. Field
desires that the W. C. T. U. furnish the wine for
use in the St. Louis churches. All the churches
represented at the convention now use unfer-
mented wine, and while the matter was dis-
enssed no action was taken. Mrs. Alice Will
iams, of Cameron, state lecturer for the Mis
souri W. C. T. U-, addressed the convention
She appealed to men to enlist in the temperance
cause. She presented an array of figures and
statistics regarding the liquor traffic If the tax
imposed upon liquor should be placed upon any
necessity it would incite revolution, she said.
She thinks prohibition is the watchward of the
hour.
Missouri Archaeological Relics.
Stephen D. Peet, editor of American
Antiquarian, has this to say about Mis
souri in article on exhibition of archje-
ological relics at the World's fair:
There are, perhaps, more archjpological relics
in Missouri than in any other state in the union
that is to say, relics gathered in the state or by
citizens of the state. The Historical Society of
Missouri has a splended collection. Europeans
are interested in these subjects. They have not
seen the relics of Missouri, though they may
have heard of them, for there are ways which
quiet men have of ascertaining what other quiet
men nave accompiisned. I am satisned that if
the Missouri exhibit is not large in other re
spects, the prehistoric exhibit will attract great
attention. Gentlemen of the Historical society
could secure the loan of private collections.
Possibly the Academy of Science would com
bine with the Historical society and with the
private collections make the exhibit complete.
It does not require much money to bring these
articles together and place them where they will
be seen. They would constitute a unique feature
of the Missouri exhibit.
The Influenza Epidemic.
The prevalence of la grippe around
and in St. Louis is unprecedented in its
ravages,' and the afflicted may be num
bered by thousands. Scores of clerks
in the government and city offices, real
estate men, policemen, business, finan
cial and professional men, including
doctors and many women, are victims.
In many manufactories at the present
rate the working force will be tem
porarily crippled." Many physicians in
speaking of the grip say that while the
disease is not serious, its tendency to
impair t.ie constitution makes it un
pleasant. '
An Evidence of Wonderful Growth,
A few years ago it was computed by
the St. Louis water department that it
would not be necessary to extend the
water mains beyond King's highway.
and the system was planned according
ly, but developments have shown that
the calculations were at fault. The
suburbs of the city have grown won
derfully of late, and the thousands who
have removed far beyond King's high
way are now demanding water. The
citv has now about 400 miles of water-
mains in use.
Commission Men Disappear.
The members of the St. Louis com
mission nrm of Armour fc lay lor have
disappeared, and are wanted on a charge
of fraud. They are said to have had
many victims, whose losses will aggre
gate S10.000. They received many con
signments, made no remittances, re
mained open a month, sold everything,
paid for nothing, and skipped with the
proceeds.

CHILI IS RUFFLED.
The President's Treatment of the Balti
more Incident Cause Comment In Chill
The Little Republic Seem to Have
Her Hands Fall, She Also Has m Row
On Hand with Spain, '
Valparaiso, Dec 10. The substance
of President Harrison's statement of
Chilian affairs was received yesterday,:
and is a subject of universal comment.
It is regarded by the Chilians as decid-
edlj menacing a rupture between the
two countries, as it is not believed that
the Chilian government will consent
either to apologize or to offer any ma
terial indemnity. The majority in
congress -is- Known to oe oppose a
to any concession, and the Chilian
government, although possessed of
great influence, would find it difli-
cult to carry the necessary support
for any humiliating measures. It is
now no secret that the government is
proceeding actively with warlike pre
parations, and that artillery of the lat
est manufacture has been ordered from
Germany in anticipation of hostilities
possibly with other powers and proba
bly with the United States. The situa
tion is complicated by Spain's demand
for a large indemnity. The Chilians
have always detested the Spaniards,
and the hatred is quickened by
this demand, which the Chilians
say is presented now in order
to take advantage of existing
difficulties. The general sentiment in
dicates that they would challenge
Spain, if they had not the United States
to deal with, and an American official
expressed the opinion yesterday that
the Chilians might conclude to settle
with America in order to defy the
Spaniards.
Capt Schley last evening declined
to express any opinion for the public as
to the president's message, but it was
evident that he was pleased with it.
A BAD SON.
He Attempts to Rob His Mother She
Escapes, He is Arrested and is Now in
Jail.
Newtox, Mass., Dec 10. An atro
:ious attempt at robbery was made in
this place Tuesday night, in which a
son. devoid of all hual respect and af
fection, was the principal. Mrs.
Bridget Carney keeps a small store in
River street, and at 7 o'clock Tuesday
night, while alone in the place two men
entered, one of whom, in a disguised
but brutal tone, demanded her money.
The men had their hats down over their
faces and the woman did not recognize
them at the first glance. She refused to
comply with the demand, whereupon
the spokesman threatened to kill her.
Suiting his action to his words, the ruf
fian sprang forward and forced the
woman to a lounge in the store, at the
same time calling upon his companion
to strap her. During the scuffle the
hat of the man who had grasped Mrs.
Carney fell to the ground, and the poor
woman, . though " half dead with
fright, was still more horrified to
recognize in her chief assailant her own
son Joseph, who had been in New York
for some time, and who had returned
unknown to her. Mrs Carney said she
would give her son the money if he
would allow her to go in a back room
where it was kept to fetch it. JS did
so, ana sue toon: tne opportmty vj es

The Percentage ot Alloy In Our Standard
Coins.
The weight of pure silver in our
silver dollar has never been decreased
a particle; it always has contained
three hundred and seventy-one and
one -quarter grains of pure silver. In
1837, in order to adopt the handy
French decimal system of alloy, we
put exactly one pound less copper in
two thousand dollars. Thus, when yon
hear anyone speak of the debasement
of the United States silver dollar, re
member that all we have to ask for
giveness for is this trifle, which is al
lowed by the constitution of the United
States. The sin of debasement, if one
can call it a debasement, was commit
ted in 1834 on our gold coins, bv reduc
ing them about six ancfone-'quarter per
cent. Had they reduced the gold coin
only half as much it would have been
an act strongly indorsed to-day, but
now unwise to adopt. In 1837. a min
ute fraction of gold was added to the
weight of the coin for convenience in
mint calculations. These two, the
gold dollar of twenty-five and eight
tenths and the silver dollar of 413.5
grains of standard metal, meaning
that each thousand parts of coin were
alloyed with one hundred parts of cop
per, were tne basis dollars on which
the government was conducted from
1S37 to 1873. The issue of greenbacks
did not disturb these coined dollars.
These were the legal coins our laws
referred to in the issue of all national
bonds sold during our war of secession.
These were the coined dollars which
we promised to pay in the redemption
of our greenbacks. In 1869. in an act
passed to strengthen our public credit,
we find this clause: "The United
States solemnly pledges its faith to
make provision at the earliest prac
ticable period for the redemption of
United States notes in coin." In all
these laws the word gold is not used,
but it is always coin. We kept coin
ing these silver dollars, to a limited
extent, all through the war, although.
the silver in them was worth nearly
four per cent, more than the gold in
the gold dollar. In 1871-73 we coined
more than two and a half millions of
these silver dollars, each of which con
siderably exceeded the gold dollar in
value. John A. Grier, in Lippincott's.
TRAIN THE EYE.
No Two Persons See the Same Object In
the Same Light.
It is considered now to be an almost
essential part of the education of the
daughter of a well-to-do American that
she should spend a season in foreign
travel. The result of the large outlay
of money and trouble in these tours
are often painfully insignificant.
One young girl remembers nothing
of her journeyings but her chance
glimpses of princes and princesses.
Another comes back with a definite
knowledge of but one place the shops
in Paris. To this girl the whole conti
nent of Europe, with its history, its
vast treasures of art, architecture and
records of antiquity means only pret
ty gowns; to that one bargains.
"Each eye," says a Spanish proverb,
"makes its own harvest."
The same difference in eyes is found
among those who never travel. A
book which won fame for its writer
throughout the English-speaking world
was Richard Jefferies' "Walks About
an Old Farm," in which he described
the beauty and mystery in the weeds
and insects, the common sights and
sounds inclosed within a few acres.
One boy goes out in the .city streets,
and comes back full of interest and de
light in the histories hinted in a thou
sand faces which he has met, the
glimpses of comedy and tragedy which
he has found at every crossing or m
every street car. Another sees nothing
but the muddy streets. The first feels
his whole nature warmed and elevated;
the other is conscious only of the con
dition of his shoes
The -important part of education is
not so much the things to be seen as
the eye to see them. How many intel
ligent readers would be ashamed to
own that they had not read the last
popular novel, while they have never
spelled out a page of the great books of
nature and human life? Youth's Com
panion. A Telephone Keglster.
The present system of charges foi
the use of telephones by annual sub
scription is by many considered unjust,
inasmuch as some subscribers speak
often and much, whereas others use
the telephone only occasionally. In
some German telephone offices an elec
trically driven clock is attached to each
telephone, which will work as long as
the telephone is off the hook, and stops
diractly it is replaced; the service is
charged for according to the time re
corded. It is claimed for this system
that unnecessary conversations are
prevented, that those that take place
are limited to reasonable length, and
the useful efficiericy of tho whole in
stallation is increased. Electricity.

Iloliday Trade Increases the Volume of.
Business While Favorable Monetary
Prospects Strengthen the Market tof
Securities. J
New York. Dec. 12. R. O. Dun &
Co. '6 weekly review of trade says: !
As the holidays draw near all signs indicate
large volume of business at the present, with
growing confidence of improvement in the
future, except in parts of the south, where the
unusual accumulation of cotton and its iovr
rrioe have a depressing influence. Reports from
a!l parts of the country show a very fair activ
ity in the distribution of merchandise. Build
ing for the year about suffices to meet the re quired
increase In population. At Chicago the
usual great increase is seen In breadstuff s, but -lack
of transportation through the- country
causes embarrassment, and perhaps part of the
decline in receipts of cattle, butter ana
cheese. 'At Omaha the car famine retards busi
ness, and at Kansas City it is quieter thanwa
expected. The southern cities all report some
embarrassment, and at Little Rock trade is dull,
at.Bashville money is close; at Montgomery
large stocks of cotton held cause a strong demand
for money; at Savannah trade is slack and pros
pects called dubious; at New Orleans, though,
receipts of cotton are heavy and of sugjer
liberal, and the demand for all the great star m
is good, collections are slow and the delajrih
payment of sugar bounties is especially notkied. .
The expected reduction in prices of carpets has
come, from 10 cents on body brussels to 5 cents
on ingrains which are now said to be cheapen
here than in England. Amour clothiers the bet
ter class of goods are in excellent demand, trade -in
knit goods is quiet and in dress goods satis
factory, bnt some concessions are noted in flan--nels.
Print cloths show some improvement and!
prints are more active. The boot and shoe
business clearly increases. The iron business is
more active. The rail mills go into next year
with orders for 600,000 tons. Lake copper is
lower at 10.8 cento, Itin and lead are very dull
and coal weak. The monthly crop report gave
little help to speculation. It showed a yield of
wheat, corn and oats which aggregate 36 per
cent more than last year's, and fifty-two bush
els for every inhabitant, agaiast thirty-nine-bushels
in 1890. Cotton is unchanged. Pork
products are slighUy stronger, coffee a quarter
of a cent and oil 18 cents higher, without great ;
activity in any branch of speculative trade. Ex
ports of domestic products continue unchecked,
and for the last week were 44 per cent. more,
than for the first week of December
last year. Yet preparations for yearly set
tlements abroad cause such remittances
that imports of specie are stopped by the de
cline in foreign exchange. The Bank of En
gland has lowered its rate of discount to 8a per
cent., and is gaming, while the German and.
French banks are losing gold. The treasury
has takes in more money than it has paid cut
by $1,300,000, bnt added to circulation $600,000 1
new treasury notes, and has drawn down bal
ances in banks $2,700,000. Favorable monetary
prospects strengthen the market for securities,,
especially as it is evident that disbursements in
dividends, interest and profits about January 1
will be lanre. and will seek new investments..
' With a better tone, some securities have ad
vanced, and there is no feeling of apprehension?
1 regarding the monetary future.
The business failures during the last sever
days number, for the United States 280, and foi
Canada 40, or a total of 320, as compared with -.
totals of 330 last week, and 295 the week previous
to the last. For the corresponding week of last,
year the figures were 374, representing 347 fail--ures
in the United States and 27 in Canada.
CLAIMS AGAINST CHILI.
The Report of Foreign Minister Matta to
the Chilian Congress.
New York, Dec 12. A special cable
dispatch to the Herald from Valparaiso
says Foreign Minister Matta has made
a report to congress relative to ine'
claims made against Chili by foreigners,,
in which he says the government is not
bound in duty to administer strict,
justice. The Chilian ministry, how
ever, he adds, rejects all attempts
to formulate claims which at times
have been allowed in America,
owing to the circumstances un
der which the government against
whom such claims were preferred, were-placed-toward
those in whose favor they
were formulated. To countenance the
present attempts would be to create inr.
favor of foreigners privileges that are
allowed neither by state nor interna
tional law. While there is no doubt,he
concludes, that the claims of prominent
British merchants are in several cases
greatly exaggerated, still, in the end.,
the Chilian government can not refuse
to pay a large portion of the claims
made for the sacking and looting oi
Valparaiso, Vina Del Mar and Santiago,
as well as for damages as to the nation
al railroad and the detention of steam
ers.
ANOTHER LIE NAILED.
The London Times Correspondent In ChlL.
Caught at It Again.
Valparaiso. Dec. 12, via Galveston
The statement recently sent to the'
London Times by its correspondent to .
the effect that United States Minister
Egan had, during the recent corre
spondence between the United States
and the government at Santiago,,
sent , several insulting notes to
Minister of Foreign Affairs Matta,.
which had caused a proposition
to be presented to the Chilian
congress looking to the suppression of
Chilian legation at Washington, whichi
proposition had only been defeated by
the government exerting its influence
to the utmost, is unqualifiedly false.
The matter has not even been discussed
by the government or by congress, and.
all indications point to a desire on the
part of congress to keep up the amicable,
relations which have existed for so lougj
a time with the United States.

The I'nidentlued Head.
New York, Dec. ,12. --Although a,.
week has passed since the crank ex
ploded the bomb in the office of Rus .
snll Sage, no one has yet identified the?
head. There were only a few visitors
to the morgue yesterday to view the
ghastly relic The features are becom
ing more and more indistinct every
day, and if the head is not identified:
soon the identity of the mysterious per
son may never be known. The officials
at the morgue are confident that. :
among the visitors who veiwed the
head there were some that identified it
but were afraid to speak out.
Treatment of Slaves In Morocco.
Madrid, Dec 12. Much indignation.
is felt here at the news of the atrocious
treatment of slaves in Morocco and es.
pecially of the children capturcd in re
cent raids by the sultan. It is saii
that the sultan is preparing for a simi
lar raid early in 1833 apon tribes that -have
not complied with his orders.
Advices from Fez state that of hun
dreds of children sold at Fez since the-
return of the sultan from his recent ex
pedition, all had been subjected to ban
barous treatment The Spanish minis
ter will probably be Instructed to f .
morstrate with the sultan.
