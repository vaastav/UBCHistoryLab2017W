"But you In Chicago are too slow
to realize the faults of the Russian

*
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Calling
attention to the fact that the United
States is the "sample democracy of
the world," and as such is constantly
under world scrutiny, President Wil
son in his last campaign message to
day urged upoh, congress the duty of
making tills' nation the champion of
right and justice In world affairs.,
Only by rectifying wrongs within our
own borders and championing the
right wherever it is in danger, the
president pointed out, can the United
States fulfill its destiny and keep
faith with the fathers of the re
public.
The president's message made no
mention of the league of nations nor
any international aspect in particu
lar. It was a short mesage and more
than half of it was devoted to do
mestic afTairs.
At the last moment, President Wil
son yielded to the wishes of his phy
sican and did not attempt to go to
the capital and deliver the message
in person before a joint session of
the two houses.
Instead, a fe,w minutes before noon
the message was transmitted to each
house separately and there was read
to the members.
President Wilson began his mes
sage with a quotation from Lincoln :
"Let us have faith that right makes
might and in that faith let us dare
to do our duty as we understand it."
The simple faith expressed in
Lincoln's words formed the gist of
the entire document. There was no
reference to the tumultous closing
days of his own administration rfor
AMERICAN FALLS
PROJECT NEEDS
BEFORE CONGRESS
Reclamation
Service
Asks for $2,335,000
Will be Granted
is Belief
WASHINGTON.—Unusually heavy
appropriations for government re
clamation work during the fiscal year
beginning July 1 next, were asked of
congress Monday, due to the fact that
a large lump sum, representing
revenues from oil leases, will be di
verted to the reclamation field before
appropriations become available, and
the probabilities are these appropria
tions will be authorized, inasmuch as
the money as segregated for a
specific purpose and can be used for
nothing else.
The undertaking of a new unit of
the Minidoka project is contemplated
as evidenced by the fact that the
total appropriation asked is $2,335,
000 as against an appropriation of
$317,000 for the current year. Build
ing of the American Falls reservoir
is to be the first work undertaken if
this large appropriation Is made, for
in submitting the estimate the recla
mation service asks that the follow
ing proviso be attached:
Tha# authority be granted in con
nection .with construction of the
American Fails reservoir to pur
chase or condemn and to improve
suitable land for a new townsite, to
replace the portion of the town of
American Falls which will be flooded
by the reservoir, and to provide for
the removal of the buildings to such
new site, and to plat and provide for
appraisal of lots in such new town
site and to'exchange and convey such
lots in full or in part payment for
property to be flooded by the reser
voir, and co sell for not less than
the appraised valuation any lots not
used for such exchange.
Fort Hall irrigation project, $76,
000; support of Fort Hall Indians,
$29,000; Bannock Indians, $4500;
Coeur d'Alene Indians, $3000.
Tribal funds of Idaho Indians are
to be appropriated as follows, for the
benefit of the respective tribes:
Coeur d'Alenes, $15,058; Fort Hall,
$25,580; Fort Lapwai, $15,000.

tion on March 4.
This one phrase, the president
said, marks out America's duty in
both foreign and domestic affairs, by
this faith alone, he said can the
world be lifted out of its present
state of "confusion and despair."
The president himself summed up
his message in its final paragraph:
"I bMe not so much laid before you
a series of recommendations," he
said, "as I have sought to utter a con
fession of faith, of the faith in which
I was bound and solemnly propose
to stand by until my last fighting dav.
I believe this to be the faith of
America, the faith of the future, and
of all the victories which awaits
tional action in days to come whether
in America or elsewhere."
he first half of the presidential
message was devoted to the expres
sions of his faitn aid the urging
upon congress its duty to make
America indeed the triumphal force
for right and j istice. Then, turning
to domestic affairs, the president
recommended to congress the follow
ing:
na
_
The passage of a budget bill to
stabilize the government's finances.
Stricter economy in governmental
expenditures in order that the burden
of taxation be lightened and the na
tional debt decreased.
Revision and simplification of the
taxation system, which he declared
has become an immediate necessity.
The granting of a loan to the
"struggling government of Armenia."
Granting to the Philippines their
independence, as they have succeeded
in maintaining a stable government.
MEASURE TO STOP
IMMIGRATION TWO
YEARS BE RUSHED
I
Plan to Rush Johnson
Bill Through House
Under Special
Rules
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Acting
under the belief that the country
is demanding a temporary cessation
of the flood of immigration, Repub
lican leaders in the House planned
this morning to jam through late to
day under a special rule limiting de
bate, the Johnson bill suspending all
immigration for a period of two
years.
Efforts to effect an organized fight
against the legislation were made to
day by Representative Siegel, New
York and Representative Sabath.
Each represents a district with a
large foreign population. They want
more drastic exclusion regulations to
keep out the undesirables but free
admission of all immigrants who are
likely to make good citizens.
The report of the house immigra
tion committees supporting the John
son bill calls attention to the great
rush of European Jews into the coun
try. It points to the fact that all
these immigrants are destined to the
large industrial centers now over
crowded and without adequate hous
ing accommodations for their pres
ent residents. None of the immigrants
of the class now coming in are agri
culturalists. The committee has been
Informed that millions of Jews from
Poland and Germany are seeking
passports, from their governments to
come to the United States and that
all of them are without funds. Siegel
and Sabath claim that the proposed
legislation Is aimed at exclusion of
the Jews.
Pacific coast members are disap
pointed that the bill does not provide
specifically for exclusion of Japanese
immigration. They will try to have
a provision to this effect Inserted in
the bill.

United Mine Workers
To Assist Striking
Coal Miners of South
INDIANAPOLIS, Incl., Dec. 5.—
Mine workers on strike in Alabama
and West Virginia were promised
"the full moral and financial assis
tance ' of the United Mine Workers
of America at a meeting of the In
ternational executive board,
board met yesterday and its decis
ion was announced tonight.
"The international executive hoard
is impressed with the spirit of self
sacrifice by the mine workers of Al
abama," said the statement. "The
42,000 men, women and children who
are engaged in this struggle are suf
fering from the most intense prosecu
tion heaped, upon them by the arro
gant coal operators of that state."
It is charged the militia Is
ployed without justification, that the
miners are misrepresented by the
press and are being thrown from
their homes and starved by the mili
tia and civil authorities.
"It is indeed questionable whether
the people of Armenia, whose suffer
ings have shocked the world, are In
any worse circumstances than the
oppressed mine workers of Alabama"
says the statement. >
A struggle of equal importance Is
being waged in Mingo county, West
Virginia, according to the executive
board.
"The miners of that territory were
locked out because of their desire
to organize and their request for
recognition of the principles of col
lective bargaining," says the state
ment. "They have made a remark
able struggle against overwhelming
odds, despite the numerous crimes
Inflicted by the army of hired gun
men employed by the coal operators
of that region. Many men have been
shot In cold blood by these modern
Hessians, while in a multicity of In
stances, others have suffered from
brutal assaults."
After pointing out the alleged
abuse of the strikers, the board de
clares for a fight to a finish.
The international executive board
declares that these industrial strug
gles in Albama and West Virginia
must be continued until the coal op
erators recognize the representatives
of their employes, says the statement.
"The full moral and financial as
sistance of the International Union
representing Its membership of one
half million mine workers, will be
placed behind the mine workers of
Alabama and West Virginia."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Not only
will the United States refuse to en
ter a league of nations, no matter
what concessions are made, but sen
ate irreconcilables headed by Sen
ators Borah of Idaho and ■ Reed of
Missouri, are equally determined that
it shall not participate in an associa
tion of nations of any kind whatso
ever. :
The suggestion accredited to for
mer President Taft that an Ameri
can commission should be sent to
Geneva for a conference on amend
ments to the league covenant Is par
ticularly obnoxious to them. This is
shown conclusively In the following
article:
By the Hon. James A. Reed, Unit
ed States senator from Missouri:
The American people by the most
decisive vote ever given by any great
nation have repudiated the league
of nations, lock stock and barrel.
Nobody but a man who Is blind, deaf
and intellecually paralyzed can fall
to understand the result of this elec
tion. The people are in favor of pre
serving the ancient policies of the
government,
that we shall keep free from the
crooked diplomacies and crooked
plottings of Europe and Asiatic mon
archs.
The politican as he proceeded with
his campaign said that the people
were not "reservists," they were "re
pudiationists; '' that they were not
Internationalists, but nationalists,
and they wrote the word in capital
letters.
The people have cdmmon sense,
an attribute not possessed to any
marked degree by those who follow
dreams and see visions. The people
have sense enough to know that if
we intermeddle in the controversies
that we will incur the ill will of one
or all of the parties participants at
any moment we may be called upon
to back our decisions with force.
Cannot Regulate World
The people have sensq enough to
know that we cannot sit down at a
council table and undertake to regu
late the affairs of the world without
assuming our share of the responsi
bility. They know that the responsi
bility thus assumed must lie backed
in a manner commensurate with the
nation's pride, honor and dignity.
They know that we are either going
