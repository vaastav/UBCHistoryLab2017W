Cutting Affray at Cuidsville
lOupnviH.to I
At CurdsMllo nlsitit :i o'clock yesterday
afternoon, Oeorge Wimsett was
dangerously nnd perhaps fatally cut by
a mau mimed Stevens. 'Iho dilliculty
was the result of a contention over 11
voter. Wimsttt finally struck ut Stevens,
when the latter drew his pocket
knife and cut him once under the right
shoulder nud again in the back jnVtover
the kidneys. Roth cuts were long and
deep, and either of them it is thought
would proio fatal. Wunsctt was taken
to the residence of his brother, John
Wimsett. He has the reputation of a
disagreeable, overbearing man, and was
in tho aggressive in this instance. Stevens
escaped by crossing Oreen river.

Tho leport of the exhaust Ion of tho
It lku oil supply, which has lately been
extensively cliculated, uppears to have
arisen from the fact that n "shut now n
of a large tiumbei of wells was ordeied,
for tho purpose of checking tho over-
piiHlticttoii w hleh has liecn going on. It
is no uncommon tiling for n native of
ItaKu to tap n supply of S.I.ODO.OOO
of oil, nnd waste ID.OoO.OOO out of
It, simpl) for want of fouUht in
u erp for tho well, or tiv
lo nrrange for surface storage.
Tho authorities have now tnl.cn the
matter In hand, and passed laws which
regulate the supply. In view of theiaptd
Increase in tho tlemnml for petroleum, it
Is satisfactory to know that Il.iL.ii Is as
prolille of oil as ever. Tho oil trade Is
rapidly assuming such gigantic
that for many years there will prolc
nhly tie ample room for America, ltussla
anil Hannah, as well ns for tho minor
IU hi that will Iu tlmo furnish a supply
for the world's market. Hut, In any
c.ic it will bo n gooil thing for KiiKsIn
when the more careful nml economical
methods of America are adopted In the

"It is well known," said Joe

When tho stylo changed from tho low-
collar to the high one it was a sweeping
change, so that but few people rauM la)

rinnlly tho choker was modified Into a
collar with the ends turned down, a good
ileal of spaeo being left open to the

The Listener vvns told the other day
about a curious old custom w hlch a good
many citizens may recall. In tho old
dajs in Huston, it there were
tailors who ntndoti practice of clothing
customers by the vinr for n fixed price,
taking kick the old suits as fast ns new
ones were supplied That is to say, the
tailor agreed for (say) the sum of $.W 11
year to furnish the customer with three
suits of clothes annually. Uon the arrival
of tho second new-Milt the customer
sent hack the first, nnd Umiii tho receipt
of tho third he sent back the second,
and in each caso the tailor furbished up
the suit nnd sold It through his oncK
door, so to speak, to soino dealer In
second band clothing, or to soino one
who wanted a cheap suit.
Probably the tailor made n good deal
more money through this nrmugcmeiil
than he would If he had sold the goods
outright, nnd the customer, with a verj
moderate exiendilure, not only had the
reputation of lieing a very well dressed
man, but enjoyed the luxury of wealing
his best clothes all the time. Out of this
custom, it is supposed, the business
of the manufacture of misfits, which his
since grown to such Immenso proui
tlons. Probably these second hand suits
of clothes, not badly worn nnd neatly
refurbished, came to bu known as misfits
and nlso to lie much sought nf ter 011 ne
count of their couipiriitlve cheapness
And the next step iu the profession was
to make tho "misfits" outright. Ho-ton
