Professor Monelli, in a recent work
on the subject of suicide, submits sonio
onriims facta. The Virginia City Enter¬
prise learns that in H Europe tall per¬
sona aro niore likely to take their own
lives than sliort ones though why this
should be is not explained. Another
striking fact is that in countries where
unities oi iitoou prevail, suicides are rare;
the people appease their thirst for blood
by taking the lives of others instead of
their own. The greatest numbs r of sui¬
cides is usually found in those socioties
where crimes against property predomin¬
ate, llobrewu rarely die by their own
hands; tliey "exhibit an habitrml reaist-
ance to suicide" possibly because their
marvrlous wimval of centuries of piti¬
less persecution impresses them thnt
tli ore must be something good in Btorc
for them. Xegroe, particularly women,
are credited with au extraordinary pro-
j permit- to it, which isalittlo remarkable j
j when we remember the negro's sereno
eontentednoss with almost anv lot he
aasy phioed in. Saxony is called
tho groat pointof irradintion of sui
oiae in Jnropc iliore ara
more suicides to the thousand pop¬
ulation there than in any other Eu¬
ropean country aad what in singular
attain, the suicidal habit is transmitted
with tlie Saxon blood, since it is found
that the more of Saxon element a conn
try lias in it, the more it is addicted to
suicides. Religion seems to hare some¬
thing to do with it Amouc the Protest¬
ant communities of the Continent the
proportion of suicides is 102.7 to the
million of inhabitants; in the Catholic
communities G2.3. In England the pro¬
portion is G7 ; In Ireland it is only 16.
There is something Li the nature of an
Irishman which, in the worst of troubles,
restrains Lint from reporting to suicide
aa a relief. The tender '.7 to take out's
own lifo increases wi-N years. It is
highest in the month of u inenud lowest
in Deeeml)er, showing that pleasant
natural environments have little, if any¬
thing, to do with it. 'lite first ten days
of the month are more fatal than the
B j others, ami the first two days appear to
nave a sort 01 rascmutioti in them, as
thay comparatively abound in suicide..
Hanging is the favorite method of sui¬
cides; drowning comes imxt, anil after
shooting.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
As yet wo novo only rocoired a brief
telegraphic summary of President Ar-
umrs mesttnge to Vngross. Thai is
innch too meagre tolform an intelligent
opinion of the full merits of the docu-
metit.
He considers a number of topics of
great lmjiortance to the Routhwost and
makes some practical suggestions.
His proposition to extend the civil
law of the States or Territories in which
reservations are located so as to cover
such reservations is one which should be
speedily adopted by Congroas. One of
the quickest ways to civilize the Indinn
will be to make him amenable to the
civil law. Place him ou the hanie foot¬
ings in the courts as hi white neighbor,
afford him the same protection and ad¬
minister the sumo punishments for vio¬
lations of la iv. There is no reason why an
Indian should not be treated aa an indi¬
vidual, and no great progress towards
civilization can be hopsd for while the
tribal relation is maintained. Asatmtlmr
itep towards individualizing the Indian
the President also recommends the al¬
lotment of land in severalty.
The cowboy question seems to be a
puzzle to tho President. Ho confesses
that the subject is an embarrassing one.
The general government is hampered by
restrictions which render it powerless to
act unless the Territorial authorities
make a requisition, and then tho bill
which was passed by our Democratic
friends who wore afraid of soldiers at
the polls permits the use of troops as a
posse comitatua. The only ground upon
troops can bo used against the cowboys
is when their depredations on tho bor-
dor destroy the friendly relations exist¬
ing botween this country and Mexico.
That, the Presido t seems to think, can
bo treated as an offense againnt the gen
eral Govomment, and warrants tho use
of troops.
The President adopts the view of the
monometalistt and recommends the re
peal of the law providing for the coin¬
age of a fixed amount of silver, and re¬
strict the coinage to the demand. The
last clause of tho recommendation
means nothing. Tlie result of following
the President's suggestion would be to
btop the coinage entirely.
No law should loave a matter of such
importance optional with any officer or
set of officers. The coinage of silver
should bo maintained. Our good times
dates from the remonetization of silver,
and it has been the greatest enemy of
corners in the money market.
We forego further comments upon tho
message until wo get the full text of the
document.

KEIFER TOE SPEAKEIl.
General Keifer, of Ohio, lias beennom-
inated by the Republicans for Speaker
of the House of Representatives. A ma¬
jority of th whole House is 174 votes.
Tlie Republicans hnvo 14G votes. Tlie
Democrats have 136. To seenre the one
additional vote necessary to a choice,
the Republican have to draw from
Groenbackers, P.apublican. 4: Groen-
backers, Deniocrate, 4; Readjusters, 2;
Indeindents, 1. The lteadjusterti will
vole with the Republicans, which will
give the Republicans 149 votos, or
two more than is necessary to elect, and
they will probably receive three or four
more votes from Green backers and In¬
dependents. Keifer may, therefore,
safely count on a majority of from six to
ten whn a vote is reached in the House.

Thk Loudon correspondent of the New
York Tribune ays: Evidences mttltiply
thai the Conservatives are bent on turn-1
iug the Irish trouble to party advant-!
age. The attacks on tlie Government
are more bitter than ever. Lord Ran¬
dolph Churchill's speech anriwssed in
violence all hi previous performances.
He tkcribes the Land Court as a star-
chamber of spoliation, its mem'xrs as
highwaymen, the proceedings as shame¬
less plnnder, and the Irish jiolicy of tho
Government as Quaker quackery.
Churchill says openly what an increasing
number of Tories aay privately. The
Standard, which is often moderate, and
sometimes almost impartial, berates the
Government for indifference and Irish
diiturtwncee, and enmrnons Gladstone's
colleagues to show some sign of inde¬
pendence. It complains that the coun¬
try is governed by Ha ward en, and asks
why thero are no Cabinet Councils, and
what their dictatorship of efficiency will
resnlt in. It offers the Tory support to
grttnt further powers, if necessary, to
keep order. A disposition is seen in
more than one quarter to make the most
of the Irish outrages so as to inflate
Englishffieling. ITnbappily, the truth
is bad enougnr"G)rtKg83 nYulViply rapiu-
ly enough, and the Government docs not
increase proportionately. Mcannhile,
O'Donnell's announcement of tho sub¬
stantial identity of Tory and the Home
Rule party, as regards Ireland, is neither
denied nor confirmed by the Tories.
WOSK.
OUR RAILROADS.
It is of interest to note the keenness
with which English lnwyers aro watch'
ing tlie Guiteau trial. The English law
as to insanity is like ours, but the Scotch
Courts differ in not permitting any tes¬
timony as to hereditary insanity, the de¬
fense being limited in their ovidoncc to
the prisoner's own actions. English his¬
tory has a case which applies somowhai
curiously to that of Guiteau. At the
trial of Oxford for shooting at Queen
Victoriii, Lord Penman said: "But, al¬
though lie labored under a delusion, if
ho fired the loaded pilstol at tho Queen
knowing the result which would follow
his conduct, and although forcotl by hid
morbid desiro for not orioty to tho act, ho
would ho responsible for his conduct and
liablo to criminal punishment" These
words apply with peculiar aptness to
Guiteau.
Thu Sarveyor-General's full opinion
and recommendation in the Sopori Mex¬
ican land case apiears in this day's Crr-
izkt. We are informed the proceedings
it i
in tlie case covers aeany u uiuusauu
pages of transoript paper. The Survey¬
or-General appears to have thoroughly
exposed a fraudulent and invalid title
covering about 20(1 square miles of land,
extending from San Xavier to lubac.
Our Delegate in Congress will surely
prevent the confirmation of this enor-

mous irauu. j.o-uays vyiTizti- buu.uu
bo preserved and its contents made
known to every one who has the power
and will to assist in defeating this Sopori
fraud. .
To prevent national banks attempt
ing to noiu tuc uireni oi rewiuK ''
circulation over Congress, to control
legislation, as they did whon tho last
funding bill wns passed, the President
rcoouiHieuds that the banks be required
to give notice of intention to retire for a
certain length of time beforehand, in
ordor to enable the people to provide
against any serious contraction or tne
currency.
This seems to be a favored locality, a
contra! point to which railroads natural¬
ly convcrgoand diverge. Thero is scarce¬
ly a railroad project of any importance
in the Southwestern country which does
not huve Tucton on their profile as one
of the important points on the line of
their road. But n few days ago we no¬
ticed in these columns that the prelimi¬
nary stops had been taken for tho build¬
ing of an important railroad from Port
Loboft, ea iks Gulf of California; via.
Altar, and Tucson, and thence north to
Nevada. The road to Calabasas, to con¬
nect with tho Guaymns, is sure to be
built, and we have good reasons for be¬
lieving that in a very short time, a nar¬
row-gauge road will bo extended from
New Mexico a branch of tho Denver
and Rio Grande to Tucson. This rood
is already completed to a point in New
Mexico north of Albuquerque, and the
management are now looking to tho
Southwest for an outlet. By building
to Tucson, and to a connection with
Port Loboa, they would tap the finest
mining country in the world, and open
up a grazing country that cannot be ex¬
celled; besides it would reach tide water
400 miles nearer thau by any other route.
This lino would cross tho Rio Grande
about 75 miles north of Albuquerque
and striko south via old Fort Wingate,
thence down through tho fine timbered
region of tho "White Mountains, passing
through or near Globe and on to Tucson.
A branch road from this lino of a few
miles would also tap the valuable coal
fields near the San Carlos reservation,
open them up to Tucson and at once
mako them valnable. A narrow-gauge
road from here to Salines, ou tho Gulf,
with a branch to the Gunsight mines,
JVIcvers District, is by no means im-
probabJe7"AlTlutffri
at worK, and renuor every possioie am
and encouragement to every legitimate
enterprise of this kind to secure their
ultimate success.
The Boston Economist, in answering
a question as to what laws niiuere have
the privilege of making for themselves,
the Commissioner of the Goncral Land
Office says: "In reply to tout communi¬
cation, I have to state that the United
States mining laws provide, that the lo¬
cator of a lode or mining claim mast
make the annual expenditures necessary
for the maintenance of the porneisory
title at any time within one year from
the 1st of January next succeeding to
the date of location, and the minors of a
mining district have no authority to
make any rules conflicting with this law.
If the mining laws of yr.ur District re¬
quire that S50 shall be expended within
0) days after the location, such provis¬
ion is wholly without force. Suppose a
location to have been made July 1, 1S60,
the S100 worth of expenditure is required
by the United States laws to be made
between the 1st of January, 1SS1, and tho
31st of December, 1S81, and tho expendi¬
tures made prior to this period, viz:
within GO days after location, would not
be in conformity with the provisions of
this law."
WATER.
Tho correspondence published elsi-
whore, from a St. Louis banking honso
to parties interested in snpplying Tpe-
son with a system of water supply, dii-
poses of the only formidable obstacle in
tho way of a speedy accomplishment of
that important project. With proper
guarantees, the money for completing
tho system can be procured, and tho
work of construction begun in a very
short time, and it only remains for the
City Council to grant tho desired fran¬
chise to have a good supply of watur
through our streets before the heat of j
another Summer is upon us.
Water must bo had, and that, too,
without unnecessary or prolonged de¬
lay, and tho plan proposed, which has
already an nssurauce of adequate finan¬
cial backing, seems to be the only avail¬
able one for a speedy determination of
tho matter.
The annual report of (omptrolIer of
tlie Currency, Knox, shows that there
are National banks located in every
State and in every Territory except Ari¬
zona. The total number ol .National
banks in operation on October 1st last
was 1232, the greatest number ever in
operation at any one time. The total
number of National lianks organized
from the establishment of the National
banking system February 2G, 1PC3, to
November 1st, of the present year, is
2581. From the establishment of the
system to November 1st last, 310 banks
havo gone into voluntary liquidation by
a vote of tho shareliolders, nud KG been
placed in the hauu3 of Receivers for the
purpose of closing up their affairs. The
total amount of claims proved by the
creditors of these insolvent banks was
S25,'.tGG,G02, and the amonnt of dividends
paid to creditors wan $1,SG1,G9S. Tho
estimated losses to creditors from the
failure of National banks during the
eighteen years since the passage of tho
Act, isG,210,000, an average annual loss
of about $310,000 in tho business of the
corporations having an aggregate capi¬
tal of about-$450,000,000, and doposits
averaging about SSOO.COOrOOO. '
COAST NEWS.
Tim Alta California has the following
in relation to the new transcontinental
railroad: "The connection of the South¬
ern Pacific and Texas Pacific roads, at a
point nearly a hundred miles east of El
Paso, gives us a through line to New
Orleans. The route will be open in a
few days clear through. This should be
of benefit to California, affording, as it
does, a line of transcontinental travel
below the snow belt Tho legal difficul¬
ties between the two couijianies appear
to be at an end. They will be run prac¬
tically as ono rood, for the present at
least The Southern Pacihe, however,
is not likoly to patiso in tho completion
of its own line to New Orleans. Whethor
the Texas Pacific will continue on to this
coast is not known." It is thought that
thi3 arrangement will make no change
in the relations of the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific,
but they will continue to exchange
freight and passongcrs at Deming as
heretofore.
BarsLir Shot.
Sax Francisco, December 5. About

United States Marshal "Wilcox of Denver
arrived at the House of Correction last
night, having in charge a life prisoner,
Henry "W. "White, a desperado lately con¬
victed of robbing n stago coach near Del
Norte, New Mexico, about five months
ago, and sentenced to imprisonment in
tho Detroit House of Correction for life.
About three miles east of Pokagcn, Cass
county, on the Michigan Central Rail¬
road, the convict picked tho lock of his
handcuffs with a toothpick and ferocious¬
ly attacked tho Marshal. He first struck
him on the head with his handcuffs, and
when Wilcox grappled with him in a
dazod way "White struck him again and
brought liim to his knees. There were
seventeen men in the car who saw tho
whole affair, but they left the officer to
struggle with tho desperate man. In
the fight White seized Marshal Wilcox's
revolver and tried to shoot him, when
Mrs. Smitii3on, the wife of a Denver en¬
gineer, on her way to New York, and the
only woman in tho car, sprang upon the
seat behind the struggling men, seized
the convict around the neck and dis¬
abled him, to a sufficient extent to en¬
able the Marshal to once more secure
control of him. White says if ho could
havo got a bullet through Wilcox he
would have covered the passengers with
the revolver in ono hand while he un¬
tied his ankles with the other, and then
"gone through" every of those infernal
cowards in tho cars. The Marshal says
that Mrs. Smithson declined a reward,
but ho was going to send to her New
York address $500 bofore he is forty
hours older.

Bob Whiteside, nnder sheriff, left for
Stockton, Cal., Tuesday, with S. O. Gor-
ham, who was adjudged insane. A few
years ago this poor unfortunate stood
high as an accountant and business
man, and nt one time filled the position
of head book-keeper in the mercantile
honse of Lord fc Williams, Tucson.
That his mental faculties should have
become so seriously impaired is a mat¬
ter of surprise and regret Wo hope the
medical treatment at the Stockton
asylum may restore him.

He congratulates tho Government on
the fact that the recent treaty with China
has been duly gratified on both sides;
the friendly spirit evinced by the Chi-
ucse Government in conceding the modi¬
fications should secure a careful regard
for the interests and susceptibilities of

Referring to the cow-boy nuisance
nnd incursions into Mexico he confesses
the subject un embarrassing one, owing
to the fact of the jurisdiction of the gen¬

the Territory applies for United States
protection, but thinks acts likely to em¬
broil us with a friendly country might
perhaps be considered on offense against
the United States, or thut the army

practical infringement of recent law for¬
bidding it to bo so used.

lawlessness that prevails along the Mex¬

intervention to suppress the same. It
also congratulates the country on the
peaceable relations between tie United
States and the South American States;
suggests that the rights and interests of
the American Government lie carefnlly

3Ir. Huntington's Plans.
Mr. C. V. Huntington, President of the
Chesapeake and Ohio, who was in Louis¬
ville a day or two ago, was interviewed
by a Courier-Journal reporter regarding
his plaa, ami the following interesting
facts were elicited:
"I have come," said he, " to see what
facilities fordoing business I ean obtain
here. My original intention was to strike
tho Ohio at Louisville. Just how much
business we will do hero will depend ou
how much it will t-ost to do that bust,
ness. If it costs twoor three cents store
to do husinefcrf here than elsewhere, we
will be forced to do what we can else¬
where. Wo will within a few days be
running through ear. from Louisville
and from Cincinnati to Newport News.
The Means Tunnel is finished, and the
Inst rail will b laid within a short time.
By April 1st we will bo running care
from Memphis to New,ort News, its the
lease f the Cecilia Branch lias been
agreed on. and wo will chango the gauge
from ho.ro to .Memphis within the next
four weeks to four feet eight inches. We
will have free two of the lino from here
U Lexington. We hope to build a line
between Louisville and Lexington be¬
fore long. Within twelve months the
transcontinental line from San Francis¬
co to Newport News will be finished.
"The tendency of rates is continuously
to a lower level; overy obstacle that en¬
hances the coot of transportation is a
misfortune, and overy means will be
iihed tp avoid it. At Cincinnati we have
made arrangements with the Louisville
A: Nashville to cross on the bridge they
use, paying our portion of the rental.
Between New York and San Francisco
last year we carried thousands ot tons
ot grapes at the rate of four-tenths of a
cent a mile; we expect to carry grain
from California to New Orleans, and will
..jeo-n-ao get lialf-a-cent .-mile. It
in tiiese figures how nec-
rmiual charges should
be reduced to the lowest poeaiblo point.
I am told the bridge toll here is some¬
where between $3 and $5 a car, while
grain has been carried from Chicago to
New York for $13. Such terminal
charges mean binkrnptcy. Commerce
cannot pay such a tax tiermanently, ami

trary' by giving exclusive privileges to a

wish to be cut

Barrett in New York and asked him
what his company intended to do with
their franchise. Yon don't intend,' said I,
to build any road bat for these few
squares? ' No," said he. You do not
intend to t-pend your money in rolling-
stock? No.' ' Thcu yon only intend
to stand there levying tribute on ovory
carload of freight that passes through
gates?' ' Yes, said he, but we will
treat every one alike.' No doubt of
that,' said I, ' I do not suppose you will
allow a single pound to pass on which
tl.i- extra saritflias not been paid." This
is an equality against which I protest
It is equal privilege, not equal disabil¬
ities which we ask."
Mr. Huntington further said he would
soon begin the laying of the rood in
Texae, an he was certain he bad the best
grant in that country. As to the profits
of railroad building in that country, he
was not sanguine; he would willingly
agree to take three percent for the next
ten years n the money invested ia Mex¬
ico, looking to the future for their
profits. When asked if he had secured
a connectiett with St Louis?, be said he
bad not yet but lie thought to scours

departure of Mr. Frank B. Wightman,
for Fort Rice, Texas, which occurred last
Sunday morning. Frank may almost be

fortune. He takes charge of Season,
Wallace & Co.'a business at the above
place. We wish him well in whatever
sphere he may bo placed.
