NEW HAVEN MORNING JOtKNAL AND COURIER. TUESDAY DECEMBER 4 19uu
CLOSING SCENES ARE BITTER
(Continued from First Page.)
thoUe five doctors, reputable men of
Herkimer county, and your friends
who enter your homes perhaps every
day, are Hars and burglars, he says
that which is not true. He doesn't ex
pect by that address to reach the in
telligent men on this jury. He thinks
that there may be a rogue among you.
Tou know some times men get on jur
ied who have debts of gratitude to pay
from away back years ago and they
pay them by violating the rules and
rendering a verdict not in accordance
with the evidence. That is what is
called a rogue of a jury, and he hoped
there might be a rogue among you.
Then they also seek to get a weak and
unintelligent man on the Jury who
wont be able to put an act in one town
with an act in another town and so
connect the evidence. They hope there
might be a man of this kind in this
Jury and they would try to reach him
and thua effect a miscarriage of jus
tice." In this strain, so excited at timels
that the big audience fairly gasped,
Mr. Ward brought to a spectacular
close a day of steady speech malting
with here and there a dramatic periud.
Senator Mills contended that Grace
Brown committed suicide and that his
client had been unfairly dealt with.
Gillette had, he said, been pitted
.against the united powers of a persist
ent district attorneySs department, an
unscrupulous sheriff's department and
'a biased and unfair public press. The
district attorney had failed to 1,-how
any plausible motive for the terrible
murder laid at Gillette's duor; he had
failed to produce the eye witness he
was expected to produce on the
strungth of his opening address and
he' failed to prove that Gillette had
any sweetheart other than Grace
Brown, as he promised to do.
Mr. Mills declared that every bit of
evidence introduced by the district at
torney wan overdrawn and that noth
ing authentic had been presented to
the Jury that was consistent with the
course a young man and a young
woman in similar trouble would have
taken in seeking relief and secrecy to
shield their reputations. He said the
district attorney might as well have
said that Grace Brown was utruek by
a ibushel basket, as with a frail tennis
racquet and that the girl's head had
struck the keel of the overturning
'boat as she went overboard, if there
were such Injuries as the doctors had
sworn to. Mr. Mills averred that
IGrace 'Brown followed the wish writ
ten by her in'one of the letters to Gil
lette that she drowned herself hoping
to be 'burled with her secret unknown
by the mother whose love and respect
she valued more than her own life.
He ctosed with the attack on the phy
sicians, whom he claimed distorted the
report of their autopsy, that brought
the district attorney to his feet.
After declaring that counsel for the
defense had sought to find a rogue dn
tno jury, Mr. Ward continued:
1 hey say this young man should
have been represented at that autopsy,
How could he be represented when the
officers were in the Adirondacks look
ing for him at the time the autopsy
as performed? The district attorney
- himself was not there. And then be
cause he was not represented Mr. Mills
attempts to discredit the word of the
five reputable doctors brought here,
and he attempts to make a doctor of
himself. He makes himself out a doc
tor and tries to tell you what consti
tutes drowning. He (this 'doctor') says
he has studied nights and learned med
icine in the past five weeks. Why,
igentlemen, he couldn't learn as much
about anatomy this man who never
saw a lung In his life by reading
nights as these doctors could learn of
law by reading his books nights.
"Why weren't they represented?
Why, gentlemen, nobody knew but
what the girl had been drowned until
they found that wound under the hair
and followed It to the brain. And when
they found that blood-clot they knew
in a minute what caused her death it
was a blow on the head.
"There was nothing In this post
mortem to mislead or deceive anybody,
and it revealed the fact that murder
had been committed; that the girl had
not died from drowning; that no water
entered into the mouth; that no water
entered into the lungs; the lungs were
normal and natural.
"Who does the counsel want to reach
when he speaks of the doctors' testi
mony? He had a learned doctor who
sat by him there; it would have been
competent for him to have put that
doctor on the stand and sworn to things
Mr. Mills testified to in summing up.
He wasn't under oath. Mr. Mills told
you what constitutes drowning. He
would bear evidence to that, but he
wasn't himself sworn. He knew if that
doctor got on the stand he would tes
tify as the other doctors, but Instead
of taking that course he says, 'I will
get up before that jury and will testify
that all the other doctors are wrong.'
Wasn't that nonsense?
"Now, what insidious thing did he
mean when he told you about graft
that existed? Was there any graft
when that poor girl was brought up
into the woods to be murdered? Did
graft cause that? What did he mean?
"I charge here and now Hint that lit
tle falsehood was put into the case for
the purpose of prejudicing a poor, fool
ish juror and to keep him from giving
proper consideration to the evidence in
the oase.
"Then he made a great splurge on
those medical notes. It was amusing
to hear him say, 'I haven't got the orig
inal notes.' No, of course not; there
were five" doctors and only one set ot
original notes, and each of them could
not have it.
POOR EYESIGHT
may come from the use of cof
fee. Before getting glasses,
quit coffee and use well-made
POSTU
"There's a Reason"
"A doctor went to a stenographer.
Where there were matters that he re
garded as immaterial he left them out
and sent each of the physicians a copy.
He (Mills) would say, 'Was there some
thing left out?' 'Yes.'
' 'Was it left out on purpose?' 'Yes.'
He wouldn't ask these doctors what it
was.
'Now, just to contradict one state
ment he has made. These doctors all
agreed that the girl didn't drown.
When the doctors found where that
blow had been made, and found what
the condition of the lungs were, they
needed to seek no further for the cause
of death.
"This learned doctor says, 'No, it was
caused by drowning.' He finds differ
ently than those other five doctors, but
it Isn't under oath. He says those doc
tors get pay from the county. So does
he, so do I, so do all the judges. There
was the ruptured blood vessel, the scalp
shows discoloration, the skull was
open. He thought he could make peo
ple believe because they didn't call it a
clot, because they called it ecchymoses,
that therefore they had done something
wrong.
"I want you to decide this case on the
evidence. That means the sworn evi
dence, and not this misquoted and fal
sified evidence as you heard it from the
learned counsel. You are sworn to
take the evidence of these physicians."
At this point the prosecutor stopped
abruptly and court adjourned until to
morrow, when the district attorney will
resume his argument, occupying the
forenoon session.
It is expected that the case will go
to the jury to-morrow afternoon.
ATTORNEY CUMMINGS RETURNS.
Attorney Alexander Cummings has
returned after several days' visit with
friends in Springfield, Mass.

ithe board. There seems no question
but what the contract will be awarded j
to the local company. I
After many attempts at amendment '
the orders concerning the muzzling and
leashing of dogs, as proposed by the
mayor in a communication to the
board, were passed essentially as pro- I
posed by the mayor. The only change
is that the dog must be held in leash
or muzzled when on the streets. The :
order as proposed required that the do'g
be both in leash and muzzled. j
The report of the board of finance on j
the estimates for the year 1907 was pre- ;
sented to the board, and on motion of .
Alderman Collins It was voted that ;
they be considered by the committee of
the whole at a meeting to be held next
Friday night. A recapitulation of the
estimates is as follows: I
Public Works Asked for, 1297,103.50; 1

Total asked for, $2,042,139.46; total al

Among the things which the boara
of finance found it necessary to refuse
are the automobile asked for by the
chief of the fire department and the
full increase of salary which was asked
for by Dr. Wright, of the. health board.
Dr. Wright's salary Is increased to $2,
000 Instead of to $2,500.
By request of the .board, (Mayor Stud
ley occupied the floor for a few min
utes, and explained the nature of the
request of the board of health that that
board be allowed to make a bargain
for the collection of garbage, without
calling for competitive bids. The mayor
said that there had been only one good
garbage collection in several years, and
that was four years ago, when the con
tract was made with Messrs. Farnham
and Daley for $S,600. This is consider
ably in excess of the price paid last
year. The board of health proposes to
give the work to thesS men this year,
and Messrs. , Farnham and Daley have
guaranteed to give good service for one
year for '$11,000. The mayor slated that
'the investigation of the board of finance
showed that it would be Impossible to
establish an incinerating plant this
year, even if it were advisable. On his
suggestion a committee of five was ap
pointed to consider the question and re
p rt to the board. This committee con
sists of Aldermen 'McKerness, Nathan
son, Johnson, Collins and Burke.
With regard to the mayor's commun
ication concerning the salary of ithe
seaier of weights and measures, it was
voted that a special committee of five
members investigate. This committee
are Aldermen Loos, Hamilton, Wood
Jord and Devine.
The report of ithe library committee
in favor of the Bristol site was read.
It will come up for final action at the
next meeting, and if passed will give
the library board the power to dispose
of the present property by sealed bids.
The money thus obtained will be used
in the purchase of the Bristol site, the
present property to he turned over as
soon as the new library is ready for
occupancy. .
The milk ordinanaces, which were
framed at the request of the board of
health were passed. The report of the
committee on the purchase of land at
Lighthouse Point for park purposes was
unfavorable, and the petition is thus
dead.
The resolutions placed before the
board at their last meeting, instruct
ing the corporation counsel to prepare

Washington, Dec. 3. Seven cabinet
changes and one appointment to the su
preme court bench were sent to the
senate to-day by President Roosevelt,
but they were not confirmed immediate
ly, in accordance with general custom
concerning such important nominations.
It, is said that there is no opposition to
the 'appointments for the cabinet, and
to the nomination of Attorney General
William. H. Moody. to be assocate jus
tice of the supreme court, despite the
fact that . it was determined to refer
these nominations to committees for

president, and therefore it would not

KENT. CLUB DEBATE.
Animated Discussion Concerning Labor
' i' Union.
The most interesting and dramatic de
bate of -the year tcok place last night
at an especially well attended meeting
of the Yale Kent club of the Law
school. The speaking by the regular de
baters was exceptionally good, and so
much interest was aroused in the ques
tion that many of the members pres
ent Joined in the general debate from
the floor, after the regular debate was
ove.
The question for the evening was
"Resolved, That labor unions are a
menace to both labor and capital, and
should -be abolished.
Affirmative: Alexander Cummings,
Srad., of New Haven; Henry J. Calnan,
1909, of Hartford.
Negative: Cheney C. Jones, 1909, of
Crete, Neb.; William J. Fogarty, 190S,
of Hartford.
Alexander Cumming, grad., as the
first speaker for the affirmative,
brought out the historical origin of the
labor union in the guilds of the middle
agti.
In the Dark Ages feudalism and
guilds disappeared in the general dis
integration of the social and economic
world. With the discovery of America,
the invention of printing, steam and
electricity, and the adoption of the con
stitution of the United States, there
was inaugurated the fundamental prin
ciple of American civilization, of liberty
and equality of opportunity to all. In
America there is great freedom in the
transmission of intelligence and in the
transportation and sale of raw and
manufactured products as between the
states of the Union, which has been the
direct cause of our commercial suprem
acy. There should be the same sale of
labor.
Unions are divided into two classes
first, the legitimate, law-abiding trade
unions, which have come to stay and
are an important and essential part of
the economic world of to-day, and, sec
ond,' the labor unions that have been
hastily organized, that have very little
experience, and resort to lawless and
violent methods. The second class are
a menace to both labor and capital, and
should be disciplined and reorganized,
or abolished.
Cheney C. Jones, 1909, for the nega
tive, pointed out that labor unions are
a necessary outcome of modern indus
trial conditions, and especially of the
factory system. . He contended that
unions are a benefit in that they short
en the hours of labor and increase the
pay of the workman
while they avoid
severe crises and make definite the cost
of labor to the employer.
Henry J. Calnari, 1909, contended for
the affirmative that labor uniona, as
distinguished from trade unions, ore a
menace to the workingman, in that he
is not master of his own services, his
individuality is destroyed, his means of
obtaining higher wages are handicap
ped by his being placed in the same
