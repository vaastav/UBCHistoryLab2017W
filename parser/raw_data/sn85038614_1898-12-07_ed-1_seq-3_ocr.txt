If expansion, which Is In the sir, Is to

GLAD TO SEE THE WOMEN.
"I am delighted to see that we have
Jewish women as delegates, for I am sure
that every cause Is strengthened by th-lr
ureseneo and their sincere, unselfish work.
Tho friends of the present union do not
lav claim to superhuman attainments.
They know their limitation, but they can
not see tho wisdom of the spirit mani
fested by those who constantly snarl and
never do anything. This Is ? crucial mo
ment In the history of Judaism. Tbs
dangers that confront It are not ?oonfln? d
to other countries; our own beloved conn
trv .-hares therein. We have advanced,
but when suffrage was given to the negro
sa a war measure, it did not necessarily
give thi-m Intelligence or discretion, so
win n reform was adopted. It did n't ? ur?
all tho Ills that the Jew is h??ir to, nor
the orthodox proven hlms.-lf clear
Horn th" swirl of th.- tempestuous ??? m
of doubt and Indifferent*?. we, as ?tatlaens
of the t "nit? ?l ?State?, are held responsible
for the acts of our co-rellgionlsts, be they
?n ??r American, if the ?congested
districts of the seaboard cities are a social
and moi ! menace. We should bring
about a ?revolution, ev.-n at th?? expense
of ?the Individual Jew. mir liberty as
in? tl. OUr Standing as <i?,/;. ns, is en
dangered ?by ?ths conditions in which these
un-An. rl n Jen ?are placed. ?Sentiment

mplete union of all ??ur forces can
bring th?-? about. Ws mm t bave s Jew
rival; one that will bring out nil of
the Intellectual and financial resources of
