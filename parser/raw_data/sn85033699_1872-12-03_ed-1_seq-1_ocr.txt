To the Behate and Houso of itepresentatlTea:
In transmitting to you my fourth annual mes
sage, it is wall thanknilness to the Giver of aU
good, that aa a nation wo havo been blessed lot
the lust year with peace at homo and abroad and
a general prosperity vouchsafed to but low peo
ple. With the exception of the devastating llro
which swept from the earth with a breath us It
wcrc.miiiions accumulated In the city of Boston
there has been no overshadowing calamities
within a year to record. It 6 gratifying
to note- how, llko their fellow
citizens of the city of Chicago under
Eimlllar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens
of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes,
and the prosncct Is that their enertrv and t)urs-
rerance will overcome all obstacles and how tho.
same prosperity soon that thev would have, had
no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we havo
been free from pestilence, war and the calami

human Judgment can penetrate tha future, no
cause seems to exist to threaten our present
leace.

tion had beeu raised by Great Britain and was
men pending, wmcn tora lime seriously imperil

and that of HcrUntanloSIaJesty, which by the

bunal of arbitration, which had mat at Geneva.
The arbitrators howevtr disposed of the ques
tion which had feonardlzed the whole of tho
treaty and threatened to involve tho nations in
most unhappy relitlons toward each other, in a
manner entirely satisfactory to this Gov;rnment
ana in sccoraanco wuu tne views and the polic
which it bad maintained. Tho tribunal whici
had convened in Geneva, in December
concluded its laborious session on tho
Hth day or September last, on which
day bavins availed itnelf of the dlscretlonarr
-power given to it by tho treaty to award n sum
in cross, maae its decision, whereby It awarded
tho sum or $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity
to be paid by Great Britain to tho United States
mi iuo MfcusiauLiuii ui uu iuc claims rexrrrcu to
its consideration. This declsida happily dis
posed of a long standing difference between the
two governments and in connection with an
other award made by tho Garnnu Emperor, un
der a reference to him by tho same treaty, leaves
the two governments without a shadow upon
theirTrlendly relations, which it is my sincere
hope may forever remaiu equally unclouded.
The report of the agent of the United States ap
pointed to attend the Geneva Tribunal, accom
panied by the protocols of tho proceedings of
the Arbitrators, tho arguments of the counsel of
both governments, the award of tho tribunal,
and the opinions Kiven by the several arbitra
tors, la transmitted herewith. I have caused to
be communicated O the heads of the three
friendly powers, who complied with the joint
request mde to them under the treaty, the
thanks of this Government for the appointment of
arbitrators made by them respectively and also
my thanks to the eminent personages named by
them, and my appreciation or the dignity, p
tience, impartiality and ereat abilitv with whl
they discharged their arduous and high func
tions. HerMajesty's Government has commu
nicated to me tue appreclitiou by Her Jtaje'ty
of tho ability and indefatigable industry dis
played by Sir. Adams, the arbitrator named on
the part of this Government, during the pro
tracted inquiries and discussions of the triBun
aL I cordially anito with ller Majesty in tills
appreciation. It is due to the p gent of tho
United States before the tribunal to record my
high appreciation of tho marked ability, un
wearied patience and discretion with which he
has conducted the very responsible and delicate
duties committed to him, as It is also duo to the
learned and eminent counsel who attended the
tribunal on the p-trtof this Government to ex
prens my t-ense of the talents and wisdom which
they brought to bear In the argument. Of a re
sult so happily r ached it will be the province
of CjnreKS to provide for tho distribution
amun those who may be entitled to it of their
respective hhares of the money to be paid.
Although tho sum awarded is not pavable
until a ear from the date of the award, 'it is
deemed advh-able that no time be lost in making
a proper examination of the several cases in
which indeninilication may be dne. Oonfc
qucntly I recommend the creation of a Board of
Commissioners for the purpose.
San Juan.
By tho third and fourth articles of the Treaty
of Washington, tho respective claims of the
United States and Great Britain in then- con
struction of the treaty of the 15th June, 1S16,
defining the boundary line between their respec
tive territories, whero submitted to the arbitra
tion and award of hU Majesty the Emperor of
Germany, to decide -which of thosa claims is
most in accordance with the true interpretation
of the treaty of 181S. His Majesty, the Emper
or of Germany, having been pleaded to under
take tho arbitration has the earnest thanks of
the government and of the people of the United
States for the labor, pains and care which he has
devoted to the consideration of this Ion? pending
difference. I havo caufed an expression of my
thanks to be communicat.d to his Majesty. Mr.
Bancrolt, tho repre-entative of this government
at Berlin, conducted the case and prepared the
statement on the part of tho Uirited States with
the sbillty that his past service justified the pub
lic In expecting at his hands; as a member of the
cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given
rise to the dlscus.-iou between the two govern
ments, as the minister to Great Britain when
t'ue construction now pronounced unfonnded was
lira, advanced, and as agent and representative
of the government to present the c&to and to re
ceive the award, he has been associated with
tho question in all of its phacs, and in every
stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earn
v.tnesa in the maintenance of the claim of the
United States. He is cctltled to much
credit for the success which has attended
tho submission. After patient investigation of
the case and of (he statements of each party, His
Maiestv. the Emneror. on the 2lst of October
last, signed his awarl in writing, decreeing that
the claim of the covernment of the United S tatty
that the boundary line between the territories of
Her Britannic Majesty and the United States
should bo dr.'.wn through the O'Hara Channel,
is most in accordance with a true interpretation
of tho treaty concluded on the 15th of Juno,
1846. between the auehtsofller Britannic Ma-
jetty and the United States. Copies of the case
presented on oeuan or cacn government and of
the statement in reply of each, and a translation
of the award are transmitted herewith. Thih
awafd conlirms the United States in their claim
in the important archipelago of islands muz be
tween tho Continent and Vancouver's Is'.and,
which for 20 years since tho rat!hVaicn of
the treaty Great Britain has contested, anil
leaves ns for thelirst time In the his'oryofthe
United States as a nation without a question of
disputed iHiundary between our territo
ry and tho possessions of Great Brit
ain on this continent It Is a grate
ful duty to acknowb dge the prompt.spontaneoufi
action uf Her Majesty's government in giving
eflect to the award. In anticipation of any re
quest from this government, and before the rtr
ception in the United States of the award sijne J
by theEmperor, Her Maj4 ty had given instruc
tions for iho removal of her troops which had
been stationed there and for the essation of nil
exercise or claim of Jurisdiction, so as to leave
the UnltedStates In exclusive possession of the
Htely disputed territory. 1 am gratified to bo
able to announce that the orders lor tha removal
of the troops have betn'executed snd the mili
tary Joint occupation ot San i.uan has ceased.
The islands ate now In the exc usivo possession
of the United States, it now bec -mes neces'iiry
to complete th6 .surv.e-y and determination of
that portl-m of the' Boundary line through the
O'Hara channel, ufidn which tho Commission
which d-termimfdttb remaining part of tho line.
faded to agree. I recommend the appointment
of 8 commission fo act jointlv with one which
may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose.
1 he AInsKiSI.tne.
Emerlenro f the difficulties attending the de
termination ot our admitted line of boundary af
ter tho occupation of the territory and Hs settle
ment by those owing allegiance to the respect! vo
governments, points to the importance of estab
lishing by natural objects or other monuments
the actual lino between the territory acnulrcd
by purchase from BusRla and the adjoining pos
sessions of her Brittanic Majesty. Tho region Li
now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting In
terests of individuals or of Jurisdiction arc likely
to interfere to tho delay or cmbassmcnt of tho
actual loeat'on (if tho line. If deferred until
population shall entr and occupy the territory,
some trivial contest of colghbors may again ar
ray the two governments in antagonism. I Ihcro
foro recommend the appointment of a commission
to act Jointly jvith one that may be appointed on
thepartof Greit Britain to determino tho line
between our territory of Alaska and tho con
tiguous possessions of Great Britain.
The Fisheries.
In my lat annual messaee I recommended the
legislation necfssary on the part of the United
States to bring into oni ra inn the articles of the
treaty of Wa-hinntiin, of May, 1871, relating to
the fisheri s, and to other matters touching tin
relations of the United btites toward the British
Nurth Amcrlcatip srssions to become ope.utlve
as soon as t e projx;r legislation should be had on
the part of Groat Britain and its posRe-slone.
1 hat legislation on t-c part of Grsat Britain and
its -ossesslois had not th-n been had, and dur
ing the fOFien ot Congre-s a question was raised
which for tho time raied a dubt whether any
action by Congress in the direction Indicated
would become important. This question has
since been disposed of and I have received no
tice that the imperial i'arliamtntan'l the legis
lature of the Provincial Government hav- pasd
laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the
matters re'erred to into operation. I therefore,
recommend your early adoption of the legislation

The Joint Commission for determining the
boundary lino between the United States and the
British possessions between the Lake of the
Woods and the Kocky Mountains has organized
and entered upon its work. It Is desirable that
the force be increased In order that the comple
tion of the survey nnd the determination of the
line may lie the sooner atti'ned. To Hils end I
recommend that a iulllciej.t appropriation be
maae.

Since my last mcsfage the exchange lias been

Congress at its last session having made an
appropriation to defray the expense ot Commis
sioners on the part of thn United States 'to the
International Statistical Congress at St. Peters
burg, the persons appointed in that character
proceeded to their destination and attended the
sessions of the Congress. Tho report shall in
due season bo laid before you. This Congress
meets at intervals of about three years and has
held its sessions in several of the countries of
Europe. I submit to your consideration tho
propriety of extending an invitation to tha Con
gress' to hold its next meeting In the United
States. The centennial celebration to be held
in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for
such meeting.
ilie Vlcmiii Exposition.
Preparations are making fur .the International
Exposition to he heiu during ino next year in
Vienna on a scale, of very great magnitude
The tendency or these expositions is in tne di
rection of advancing civilization and the elevn
tion of industry, of labor and of the increao of

eourso and good will between the. nations. Aa

the presentation of their productions, if encour-

At tho last " session of Congress
authority was given for the appointment of
one or more agents to represent tnis government
at the Exposition. The authority thus given has
been exerciseu, out in tne ausence ot any appro
crlation. there is dancer that the important ben
efit which the occasion offers' will, in a largo de

I commend the subject strongly to your Tnsld

aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Expos!

Sroprlation of moneys that the Secretary of tho

ism and wisdom, which It Is believed will be con.
firmed by the results of his administration. It is
particularly desirable that nothing should be left
undone Dy tno government ot cither republic to
strengthen their relations as neighbors and
friend. It is much to be recre'ted that manv
lawless acts continue to disturb too quiet or tue
settlements on the border between our territory
and that of Mexico, an d that complaints of wrong
to American citizens in various parts ot tne
country are made. The revolutionary condition
in which tho neighboring republic has so long
been involved, has in some degree contributed to
this disturbance. It is to be hotted that with a
more settled rule of order through the republic.
whici may be expected from tho present govern
ment, the acts of which just complaint is made
win cease.
The proceedings ot the commission under the
convention with Mexico of the tth of July, 18C3,
on the subject of claims have unfortunately been
cherlrpd hv nn nhstacliv for tlio rmoval of which
measures have been taken by tho two govern
ments, which it is believed will prove successful.
Outrages on Tux u n Border.
The Commissioners appointed pursuant to the
toint resolutions oi congress ot me unot Jiay
ast. to inauire into depredations on the Texas
frontier have diligently made investigations In
that quarter. Their report upon the subiect will
d commumcaiea 10 you. xueir researcnes were
necessarily incomplete, partly on account of tho
llnllted appropriation taaJe by Congress. Mexico
on tne pan i t tneir government nas appointed a
similar commissioner to mvesugato these out
rages. It is not announced officially, but the
pressof that country states that thefullest Inves
tigation is desired, and that the co-operation of
all parties concerned is invited to secure that
end. I therefore recommend that a special ap
propriation be mads at the earliest day practlca
bl to enable tha Commissioner, on the part of
the United Stats, to return to their labors
without delay.
Condition of Cnbo.
It is with regret that I have again to announce
a continuance cf the disturbed condition of the
Island of Cuba. Xo advance toward pacifica
tion of the dijeont-nted part of the population

gained no advantages and exhibits no more of
tue eiemeniB ot power or ot tne prospect oi uui

Spain on tho other hand has not succeeded in its
repression, and the parties stand apparently in
the Fame relative attitude which they havo oc
cupied for a longtime past This contest has
lasted now lor more than lour years, were it
seen at a distance from our neighborhood, we
might be indifferent to its results, although hu

nucd maintenance of slavery In Cuba is among
tho strongest inducements to the continuance of
this strife. A terrible wi ong is the natural cause
of a terrible evil. Tho abolition of slavery and
the introduction of other reforms In the adminis
tration of the government in Cuba could not faU
to advance the restoration of peaco and ord.T.
It is especially to be honed that tho pre-ient lib
eral government of Spain will voluntarily adopt
this view. The law of emancipation which was
passed more than two years since has
remained unexecuted, and In the absence cf reg
ulations lor its m'orceraent it was but a lcoi
step toward emancipation, but it was the recog
nition of the riirht and was hailed as such, ami
exhibited Spain In harmony with the srntiments
of humanity and ol justice, ana in sympathy
with the other powers of the Christian and civil
ized world. "Within the past few wesks the reg
ulations for carrying out the laws of em ncipa
tlouhave been announced, giving cvidce of
the. sincerity of intention of tne present govern
ment to carry into ofi't-Ct th law of 1870. I have
not failed to urge the consideration of tha wis
dom of the policy and the Justice of a more ef-
lective system lor tue aooimonoi tne great evil
which oppressed a race and continues a bloody
and destructive contest close to our border, as
well as the expediency and the Justice of con
ceding reforms of which the propriety Is not
questioned.
Anicrica.u StnvciioMera.
Deenlv impressed with the conviction that the
continuance of slavery is one of the most active
causes ot the continua-ice of the unhappy con
dition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens
of the United States, or those claiming to be
such, are large holders In Cuba of what is there
claimed as property, but which is forbidden and
denounced by the laws of the United Elates.
Thev are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our
own laws, contributing to mo continuance oi
th s distressing and sickening coniest In my
last annual messago I referred to this subject,
and I again recommend such legislation as miy
bo proper to denounce, and if not prevent, at
least to discourage American citizens lrom hold
ing or dealing in slaves.
Ho u tli America.
It Is gratifying to announce that the ratifica
tion of the convention concluded under the aus
pices of .his Government, between Spain on the
one part, an i the allied Itepublics of the Pacific
oa the other, providing for an armistice, have
been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is
herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may
be followed by a permanent peace between the
same parties.
The uitlerenccs which atone time threatened
the malntainance of peace between Brazil and
the Argentine Itcpublic are, it Is hoped on tho
way ot satlslactory adjustment, with these
States as with the Republics of Central and South
America we continue to maintain the most
friendly relations.
Oar Venezuelan Minim.
It is with regret, however. I announce that
tho Government of Venezuela has made no
.further rayments on account of the awards un
der the convention ot the 2oth of April, 1SC6.
That Republic Is understood to be almost If not
quite tranquilized. It is hoped therelore that
it will lose no time in providing for the unpaid
debt to the United Stati s, which, having origi
nated in injuries to its citizens by the Venezuclau
authortics and having been acknowledged per
suant to a treaty in the most solemn fvrm known
among nations, would seem to deserve a prefer
ence over debts of ft different origin and contract
ed in a difii rent manner. This subject U again
recommended to the attention of Congress for
such action as may be decided proper.
Our Japanese CouslnK.
Our treaty relations with .Tanan remain un
changed. An imposing embassy fro-n that in
teresting and progressive nation visited this
country during the vcar that i3 nsslnc. but be-
ing"unptoviried with powers for the signing of a
convention In this country, no conclusion in that
direction was reached, ,'t Is nuped however,
that the Interchange of opinion which took place
during their slay in this country -lias led to a
mutual appreciation of tho Interests which may
be promoted when the revision of the existing
treaty shall be undertaken. In this connection
I renew my recommendation of a year ago that,
to give iraiortancc and to add to the elficiencv

Inflow between these nations and the balance of
the commercial world, an appropriation he made
to support at least four American youths in ca. h
of thews countries to serve asa part of the ollicial

The Innocents Abroad.
Congress from the beginning of tho govern
ment has wisely made provision.for the relief of
d stressed seamen in foreign countries. Ko sim
ilar provision, however, has hitherto beeu made
lor tee relief ol citizens in distress abroad other
than seamen. It is understood to be cuMomary
with other governmenls to authorize Consuls to
extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in
certain case?. AsimiWr autooriry and an ap
propriation to carry it into effect are commended
m caso ot citizens of the United States sick. Un
der such circumstances It is well known that
such citizens resort to foreign countries in great
numbers. Though homo of them are able to
bear the exnenso incident to locomotion, there,
arc some who. through accident or otherwise,
become penniless pud-have no friends at home
aide to succor them, persons 4n this situitlon
must cither perish, cat themselves upon the

all times aud of inestimable value In case of a

Our Decrepit! Navy.
The report of the Secretary of the Nary, here
with accompanying, explains fully the condition
of that branch of tho public service, its wants
and deficiencies, the expenses incurred (luring
the7past year and appropriatiocs for the same.
It also gives a complets history of the servlcesof
tho Navy for tha past year in addition to Its regu
lar rvlces. It is evident unless steps are tafen
to preserve our Navy that in a very few years
the United StaUs will bo tho weakest nation ui
on the ocean of a'l the great powers. With an
enrgetlc, progressive, business peopla like
ours, pcu-trating and terming business relations
yvitli every part of tbo world, a navy strong
eirugu to command tbo respect of our Hag
abroad is necessary for the pro-ection of their
rights. I recommend a careful consideration by
Congress of the recommendations madu by the

Tho Frr.isltluar Privilege.
I have heretofore recommended the abolition
of the franking privilege, aud sec no reason now
for changing my viewa on that subject. It not
havinir been favorably regarded by Con-
-gress, however, I now suggest a modflcation or
me privilege 10 correct its glaring anu cosuy
abuse.
Postal Telegraph.
I would recommend, also, the appointment ol
a committee or commission to take into consi-t-eraticn
the bet method, equitublo to private
coriorations who have invested th;ir time and
capital in the establishment of telegraph lines',
ot acquiring the title to all telegraph lines now
in operation, and of connecting this service with
tha postal teivice of the nation. It Is not prob
able tuat mis subject couiu receive tue proper
consideration daring the limits of the short ses
sian of Congres?. but it may be initiated so that
farther action may bo fair to the Government
aud to the private parties concerned.
Jloro Pap for a Prostrate Commerce.
There are but three lines of ocean steamers,
namely: The Pacific Mail Steam'hip Co., be
tween San Francisco, China and Japan, witii
provision made for emi-montb.ly service after
Oct. 1. 1872; the United Stat sand Brazil line,
monthly, and tho California. Ncrf Zialand and
Australia line, monthly, plying between the
United States and foreign ports, and owned and
operated under our flag. I earnestly recommend
that such liberal contracts fur carrying the mails
be authorized with these lines as will insure
their continuance. If the expediency of extend
ing tho sid of the Government to lines of steam
ers which hhheito have not received it, should
be deemed worthy of the consideration of Con
gress, political and commercial objects make It
advisable to bestow such aid on a 11. c
under our flag between Panama and the
Western Sonth American jiorts. By this
mjans much trade now diverted to other coun
tries might be brought to us to the mutual ad
vantage of this country and those lying in that
quarter of tho continent of America. The re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury will show
an alarming falling off in our carrying trade lor
the last ten ortwelve years and even for the past
year. 1 do not bellove that the public treasure
can oe ueiier cApeuueu m uio mierest ui me
whole people than In trying to recover this trade.
An expenditure of S5.000.000 per annum for the
next five years If it would restore tons our pro
portion ot tne carrying trace ot me world, would
be profitably expended. The price of labor iu'
Europe has been sj much exhausted within the
last few years that the cost of building and
operating ocean steamers In the United States Is
not so mucli greater than In Europe that 1 be
lieve the time has arrived for Congress to take
this subject into serious consideration.
The Department of Justice Kn-IIIux
A detailed statement of tho disbursements
through the Department of Justice will be fur
nished bythe report of the Attornoy General; and
though these havo been somewhat Increased by
the recent acta of Congress to enforcothe rights
of citizens of the United States to vote In the
several States ol the Union, and to enforce the
provisions of the -fourteenth amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, vet thev are
Justified by their necessity and by the salutary ef.
tectot tnese enraiment'. itcciuess aim lawless
men.'I recret to sav. have associated themselves
together in some localities to deprivcother citizens
of the rights guaranteed to them by tho Consti
tution of the United States, and to that end have
committed deeds of violence. But the
prevention and punishment of many
of these persons have tended greatly to
the lepression of such disorders. I do not doubt
that a great majority of the people lu alf parts of
the country favui thefull enjovmcnt by all class
es of persons ot thoe rights to which they are
entitled under Constitution and the laws, and I
invoke the aid and influence of all good citizens
to prevent organizations whoso objects are bv
unlawful means to lntefere witli those rights. I
look with confidence to the time not far distant
when tho obvious advantages of good order and
peace will induce an abandonment ol all combi
nations iirohlbitod bv the acts referred to. and
when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecu
tions or iiuiict punishments to protect citizens
Jrom the lawless doings of such combinations.
Tho Policy ori'ordous.
Applications have been mado to'me to pardou
persons convicted of a violation of said acts,
upon the ground that clemency in such cases
would tend to trauquilize the public mind, and
to test the vlrtu-s of that policy, I am disposed,
as ray sense of justice will permit, to give to
-these persons a favorable consideration, itut my
action mereon is not to be construed as indica
ting any change in my determination to enforce
with vigor such laws so lonir a3 the conspiracies
and combinations therein named disturb the
peace ofthe country. It is much to be regretted,
and Is regretted by no one more than myself.that
a necessity has ever existed to execute the en
forcement act. No one can desire more than I
that the necessity of applying it would never
again be demanded.

of government, is one of great Importance a the
complement of tho existing Indian policy. The
question of removal to the territory, within the
las: year has been presented ttr many or the
tribes resident upon other and less desirable por
tions of the public domain, and has generally
been received by them with favor. As a prelim
inary step fj tho organization or such a territo
ry, it will bo necessary to confine tho Indians
now" resident therein to farms or proper size,
wiilch should be secured to them in fee, the resi
due to be used for tho settlement of other friend
ly Indians. Efforts will be made la tho Imme
diate future to induce the removal of as many
peaceably djsposid Indians to the Indian terri
tory as can bo settled properly without disturb
ing iho harmony cf those already there. There
U no other location now available where a peo
ple whj are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge
of pastoral aud agricultural pursuits can bo as
well accommodated as upon the unoccupied
lands In tha Indian territory. A territorial gov
ernment should, however, protect the Indians
lrom the Inroads of the whites for a term of
jears,tintil thoy become sufficiently advanced in
tho arti and civilization to guard their own
rights, and rom the disposal of lands held by
them for the same period.
Tho Piihllc Lands.
During the last fiscal yerr there were disposed
of out of the public lands H,t6175 acres, a
quantity Creater by 1,099,270 acres than were
disposed ot the previous year, of this amoun t
1,370,320 acres were sold for cash; 369,400 acres
located with military warrants; 4,671,332 acres
were taken for horn-steads: 093,013 acres located
with college scrip; 3,554.887 acres granted to rail
roads; 405,37 acres granted to wagon roads; 711,
235 acres given to State as swamp land, and H,"
760 acres located by Indian rcrlp. Tho cash re
ceipts from all sources In tho land office amount
ed to $3,218,100.
During the same perlod22.0ie,009 acres of the
pupllc land were sarveved whlo- added to the
qtiautity before snrveved amounts to 583,364,780
acres, leaving l,227,6j3,62i acres of the public
lauus suit unsurveyea.
Tho reports from the subordinates of the Land
Office contain interesting Information in regard
to their respective districts. They uniformly
mention the frultfulnt83 of the son during tho
past season and the increased yield of all kinds
ot produce. Even in those States where mining
is the principal business, agricultural products
havo exceeded the local demand and liberal slsy
ments have been'made to distant points.
Tho Patent tlfilcci.
During the year ending Sept 30, 1872, there
were Issued from thoPatent Office 13,026 patents,
233 extensions and 556 certificates aid registers
of trado marks. During the same time 18.5J7
applications for patents, Including re-Issues and
designs have been received and 3.10J caveats
filed. The fees received during the same prl(.l
amounted to 5700,959.86, and the total expendi
tures to J623.553.90, making the net receipts over
tha expenditures 577,400.56. Since 1836 20O.(riO
applications for patents have been filed and
about 134,000 patents issued.
The offices being conducted under the same
laws and general organization as were adopted
at the original inauguration when only from 1)0
to 500 applications were made per annum, the
commissioner shows that the office has outgrown
the original plan, and that a few Improvements
have become necessarry. This subject was pre
sented to Congress in a special communicate a
In February last with my approval and the ai
proval of the Secretary of the Interior, and the
suggestions contained In 6ald communication
were embraced in a bill that was reported to the
House by the Committee on Patents at the la-tt
session. The subject of the reorganization r
tho Patent office as contemplated by the bill n
ferredisof such importance to the industrial
luterests of tho country that I commend it to the
attention c-' Congress.
The Commissioner also treats the subject "jf
the separation of the Patent Office from tne De
partment of the interior. This subject Is also
embraced in tha bill heretofore referred to. The
Commissioner complains of the watt of room
for the model gallery, nnd for the working foreh
and necessary" tiles ot the office. It Is impo&it le
to transact tho business ofthe office properly
without more room In which to arrange flies ai-d
drawings that must be consulted hourly In ti e
transaction of business. The whole ofthe Patent
Office building wlIlKonbo needed. If It is nut
already, for the accommodation of the built
of the Patent OfHcei
Pension.
Tha amount paid for pensions in the last Cecal
yparwasS30,r9,340, an amount larger by Sa,
708,431 than was paid during the preceding
year. Of this amount ?2,313,4( were paid under
the act of Congress of reb. 17, 1871, to survivor
of the war of 1312. The annual Increase of j! -biousbythe
legislation of Congress has more
than kept pace with the natural yearly losses
from the rolls. The act of June 8, 1672, has added
an estimated amount of 55750,000 per annum to
the rolls without Increasing the number of pen
sions. Vo cannot, therefore look for anv snli-
stantial decrease In the expenditures of this dj
partment for some time to come, or so Ions as
Congress continues to so change the dates of
pcuaions.

tho beginning of the year was 91,609. Tho num-
bcrrecelved during the year was 20,574. The
number disposed ot was 35,173, making a t
gam or 1204. The number of claims now on
file Is 79,035 On the 13th of June, 1872, there
were on the rolls the names of 95,405 invalid mil
itary pensioners, and 113,513 widows, orphans
and Uejendeiit relatives, making an aggregate
of 208,923 army pensioners. At the same tsme
there were on the rolls thu names of 1,449 navy
pensioner and 1,730 widows, orphans and depen
dent relatives, making the whole number of
naval jitustoners 3,179. There have been receiv
ed since tue pass-age ot the act to provide
ltndons for the euivivorS or the war of 1812,
36,551 applications prior to Jnne 30, ls72. Cl
these there were allowed during the last fiicat
year 2.oi j claims. 4.S46 were rejected during the
year, leaving 11,580 claims pending at that date.
Tho number of pensions of all classes granted
duridg the last fiscal year was 33,830. During
that jierlod there were dropped from the rolls for
various causes 9,101 names, leaving a grand b
talor.233,2 pen-dons on the rolls on the 30th f
June, ls72. it is thought that the claim ft.r
pensions on account of the war of 1S12 will all ta
disjiosed of the first of May, 1873. It Is estimated
that 830,4SO OuO will be required for the pension
service during the next fiscal year.
The Census.
The ninth census Is about completed. Its
completion is a e abject of congratulation, Inas
much as the use to bo made of tho statistics be
in contained depends very greatly on the
promptitude of publication. The Secretary of
the lntjrijr recommends that a census be taken
in 1S75. which recommendation should receive
the ready attention of Congress. The Interval at
present established between the Federal censuses
is so long that the information obtained atthf
decimal periods as to tho material condition,
wants aud resources of the nation Is of llttl
practical value alter the expiration of the first
l-alf of that period. It would probably obviate
the constitutional provision regarding the deci
mal census if a census taken in 1875 should be
divested of all political character and no re-ai-portionnientof
Congressional representation bs
mado ULd.r it. Such a census, coming asit
would In the last year of the first century of our
national existence, would rumlsha noble mon
umcrt of the progress of the United States dur
lug that century
Education.
Tho rapidly Increasing interest In education i
a most encouraging feature in the current his
tory ot me country, anu it is no doubt true ma t
this is due in a creat measure to the efforts ofthe
bureau of education. That office is continually
receiving evidence which abundantly proves its
efficiency from tho Various institutions of lean.
mg and education of all kinds throughout tin
country. Tho report of the commissioner con
tains a vastramount of educational details ot
great interest. The bill now pending before
congress providing for the appropriation of a
part of the proceeds of the sales of public land
for educational purposes to aid the States in the
general education of their rising generation, is a
measure of such great Importance to our rial
progress and is so unanimously approved uy ih
leading friends of education that 1 recommend
it the lavorable attention of Congress.
Territorial AlTalrs Utah.
Affairs in the Territories are genSrally satis
factory. The energy and business capacity of
the pioneers who are settling up the vast domin
ion not yet Incorporated into States are keeping
pace in internal improvements and civil govern
ment with the older communities. In but one
of them, Utah, is the condition of affairs unsatis
factory, except so lar as me quiet or mo citizen
may be disturbed by real or Imaginary danger of
Indian hostilities. It has seemed to bo the policy
ofthe Legislature of Utah to evade all resionsi-
bility to tho government of the United Mates,
and even to hold a positi n in hostility to it. I
recommend a careful revision of the present
laws ot the Territory by concres. and tue enact
ment of such a law as the one proposed in Con
gress at its last session for instance, or something
similar to it as will secure peace, the equality of
all citizens before the law, and the ulttmate e
tiuguishment cf polygamy.
