Another Big Flurry in Grain
Caused by Heavy Specula
tion of Countrymen.
May Wheat Opens With a Whirl
oi Excitement—New High
Records.
Price Reaches 83 Cents and
Closes Near Top-Corn
Follows Wheat.
Chicago, Dec. 7.—Speculation on the
board of trade was on a rampage again
today, record prices in all grains \vero
topped an*d bull enthusiasm ran from pi
to pit, setting all traders in a fever of
excitement. The conditions back of tho
upward whirl of
prices
were almost iden­
tical with those that started the bull
movement Wednesday .and Thursday
Country orders, especially for wheat,
deluged the commission, houses before
trade Opened. Added to this big demand,
however, was a pew and powerful bull
incentive, that of capitalistic specula
tion. Prominent brokers say the coun
try has gone speculation mad and men
who usually dabble in fitocks are turn
ing to grain. The news today was bull
ish. Both Liverpool and the Englis'a
country markets were strong, outside
American markets were bullish and re
ceipts reported rapidly falling off. Wheat
opened of a cent to 1% cents higher
and prices were well maintained. De
cember ranged between 7696 and 78%,
and May between 80?i and 83.
Corn and oats, tho both excelling the
records for many years, followed largely
after the lead of wheat. The cash situs
lion in both of these cereals was very
strong and the supply limited.
Chicago, Dec. 7.—A whirlwind of ex
citement struck the grain pits today
and sent all cereals again above record
prices. After yesterday's early dullneia
and late reviving strength shorts were
panicky. The conditions were the san
that started the big bull movement of
Wednesday and Thursday. Buying or
ders are coming in on till sides. Wheat
had a greater part of the attention of
trader?. Commission houses bought
heavily and offerings were very light.
December opened %®7A. of a cent to ltt
@1% cents higher at 77:& to 76%. Proflt
taking by the big professionals was
popular and prices sagged to 76%. The
big country demand, however, kept the
tone very strong. May opened %@l to
1%@1% cents higher at 80% to 81%, tx
ceeding the record price for this crop
by of a cent. Profit taking in this op
tion also brought a sag to 80%, but the
reaction was quick and at the end of the
first hour it was holding strongly at 81.
General conditions had little effect on
the pit, speculation ruling. Cables snd
English country markets were strong,
as were outside markets here.
Small primary receipts, Wall street
buying and the generaL rush to get hold
of wheat, brought prizes upward after
a small sag with a rush. December
closed 2%@2% higher at 78% May
jumped excitedly to 83 and closed strong
2% up at 82%@82%.
Trade in corn was not very large.
Commission houses had good buying or
ders, cable* were strong and there 'vas
very little for sale.
Sympathy with wheat was the strong
est factor, tho outsicle markets vere
much higher than Chicago. Cash de
mand was 6trong. Unsettled' weaiher
also was so'me influence. December
opened to 1@1% up at 65%@6596 to
65H. but eased on liquidation to it4%.
May struck its new record price at the
start, opening to 1 up at 68% to (8%.
There was a slight wag here also, but
holdings were firm at 6S%.
Corn felt the onward rush in wheat
and followed It in a measure. December
closed higher at 64%, strong but
somewhat less so than at the opening.
May jumped up to a saill higher record
and closed there strong, 1% higher at
69.
Oats opened strong at record break
ing prices, more in sympathy with other
grains. There was a fair commission
house trade, which developed strongly.
May opened to 1 higher at 46 to 46%
There was a range oif rapid fluctuations,
but the option held very strong at 46%.
Cash demand was good and acceptance
short.
Provisions opened somewhat dull at
lower prices all arcund on the weaker
hog market.

COUGHS AND COLD8 IN CHILDREN
Recommendation of a Well Known Chi
cago Physician.
I use and prescribe Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy for almost all obstinate,
restricted coughs, with direct results. I
prescribe it to children of all ages. Am
glad to recommend it to all in need and
seeking relief from colds and coughs and
bronchial afflictions. It is non-narcotic
and safe in #ie hands of the most un
professional. A universal panacea for
all mandkind.—Mrs. Mary R. Melendy,
M. D., Ph. D., Chicago, 111. This remedy
lc for sale by druggists.
Overcoming the Difficulty.
"I see that the question of reaching
the north pole is now largely one of food
supplies. Without food the most daring
nnd endearing explorer is fatally handi
capped."
"Then wo can't commence too soon."
"To do what?"
"To train up lot of explorers to exist
on snowball muffins and ice fritters."—

Annual Crop Summary of Dl
rector Sage Given to the
Public.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 6.—The Iowa crops
in this year 1901 are worth millions to
the Iowa people. The cold figures for it
are furnished by the Iowa weather and
crop service. In four of the years of
the past decade Iowa actually had a
smaller crop than this year, so that in
quantity the crop is not as poor as sup
posed. But never is the history of the
state have the products of the soil been
as valuable as now. The crop sum
mary as made out by John, R. Sage, of
the weather and crop bureau, shows
that despite the extreme heat arid
drouth of the midsummer period, the
harvests have amply rewarded tho far
mers of this state.
Wheat—The area of winter wheat was
49,068 acres, and the total yield 865,770
bushels, or an average of 17.6 bushels
per acre. Spring wheat yield is I7,42i?
230 bushels-^an average of 15.3 bushels
per acre. Total wheat product 18,295,
000 bushels—a loss of 2,983,350 bushels
compared with last year on account of
decreased acreage. The average farm
price is about 60 cents per bushel.
Corn—The reports show unusual var
iableness in the averages of the corn
crop, in the different counties, ranging
from 18 to 38 bushels per acre, as the
result of unequal distribution of rain
fall in the critical stage of growth. The
general state average is 26.2 bushels per
acre, and the total product 227,908,850
bushels, harvested from 8,687,480 acres.
The total output of 1901 Is about 65
per cent, compared with the crop cf 1900
and about 85 per cent compared with
the average product of the past twelve
seasons. The average farm price of
corn for the state is about 50 cents per
bushel, as against 27 cents on Decem
ber 1, 1900. The cash value of the crop
In the markets is about $113,000,000, or
$20,000,000 in excess of the value cf the
crop last year on the basis of prices ob
tainable December 1. In this estimate
no account is made of the Increment in
value resulting from feeding corn on the
farms where it is produced.
Oats—The area of oats harvested this
year was 3,799,229 acres, which Is 192,-
Crops.
From the above conservative estimate
it appears that the soil products of this
state, at current farm prices, in this
droughty season, are worth over $27'4,
000,000, which sum is about $44,000,000 In

His Eighty-sixth Anniversary.
Denmark, la., Dec. 7.—Deacon Theron
Trowbridge celebrated his eighty-sixth
birthday yesterday, and his many
friends gave him a surprise In the
evening by gathering at the Congrega
tional church and bringing with thern
many tokens of their love and respect
for his faithfulness as a Christian citi
zen for the many years he has lived in
the community. For more than' fifty
years Mr. Trowbridge has been the
faithful sexton of the Congregational
church.
Rev. J. M. Cummings, in a few well
chosen words, presented the gifts to Mr.
Trowbridge, who was so overcome with
surprise and joy that words failed him
to express his gratitude to his friends
for their love and generosity.
Altho Mr. Trowbridge is eighty-six
years old, he is hale and hearty, and
only a few weeks ago walked out from
Ft. Madison, a distance of eight and
one-half miles, in two hours. \.,••$.

Where Cranberries Are Grown.
Four hundred thousand bushels of
cranberries will be utilized this year in
celebrating Thanksgiving day in the
United States. That means that the
national feast day will dispose of almost
half the cranberry crop of 1901—one mil
lion bushels. The cranberries of the
east come from Cape Cod, New Jersey
and Long Island, the proportion of pro
duction of each locality in order nam
ed. About three-fourths the total
cranberry crop is grown in these sec
tions, the balance being grown in the
middle and western states.
Raising cralberries has nearly become
an Industry. The berrle are grown on
bogs and marshes. Often a salt marsh
is selected for cultivating the cranber
ry. but the very best place Is the bot
tom of a pond. In thel atter case the
water i9 drawn off, and' several inches of
clean, sharp sand leveled over the
peaty earth. In this the cuttings—what
the house plant grower calls slips—are
set out, and grow famously. Sand is
as necessary to a good cranberry bog
as water. In three year's time the lit
tle bushes and. vines begin to bear, and
in five years a bog becomes productive.
The plan of giving the bog the vaBt
quantities they need is the system of Ir
rigation in vogue in the west. The har
ries are picked in September and Octo
ber. Jack Frost Is their enemy, sp
when the grower thinksa frosty night
is at hand he lets the water run over
the berries until It stands from eight
een to twenty-four inches deep. The
next day the water is drawn off and In
a little while afterwards the pickers can
go to work.

The cranberry pickers average from
two to seven bushels a day, a bushel
consisting of three palls. For each of
the latter the picker receives 12 cents.
The berries are sold by the grower at
an average of $5 a barrel, and thlf
means that the gross fncome of the
cranberry growers of the country for
1901 will be $1,500,000.—New York Mail

United States and Denmark Un
able to Reach Agreement
on Conditions.
The American Government Not
Able to Accept Certain Re
strictions Imposed.
Price Demanded by the Danish
Government Said to Be
Satisiactory.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Satisfactory
conditions can not be reached in the
effort of the United States government
to acquire to the Danish West Indies.
The fact became known at the state
department shortly after the departure
of Mr. Constantine Bruns, the Danish
minister, who visited the department.
As the purchase negotiations are still
on it would be manifestly discourteous
to make public all of the details of the
negotiation^ up to this time. It can be
said, however, that the dissatisfaction
with the teams is on the part of the
United States and not of Denmark.
While many reasons have been given as
to the value to the United States of
acquiring title to the little islands, it
appears now that the obstacle is one
which can not be overcome unless a
concession is made by Denmark, of
which there is little prospect at this
time.
The condition which Denmark places
upon the cession proposition is. that
the people shall be given the rights of
citizenship in the United States and the
free and unrestricted advantages of
free trade and commercial relations,
such as are not now enjoyed by any but
our own states and a few of our terri
tories. The secretary of state would
like to close the negotiation for the
Islands. He would do so if the restric
tions indicated could be removed.
Nine-tenths of the population are of an
ignorant, semi-barbarous class. The
state department realizes that no treaty
which it negotiated with such pro
visions would be ratified by the United
States senate.
Mr. Bruns has not been in Washing
ton 'more than a fortnight, but during
his visits to the state department he
has given to this government the clear
est idea of the requirements and in
tentions of his country toward the pro
posed cession that has yet been se
cured. All negotiations have been
transferred from Copenhagen to Wash
ington. The price is right from the
standpoint of the United States, and
efforts will be made to get Denmark
to trust to the American people to giye
the people of the islands a desirable
form of government.

"Why, dear, whut's the matter with

"Oh, worse than that. He writes me

'Yes, but I find I put mother's photo

from the flames, the

And yet if that
woman had perished
in the flames it is pos
sible that she would
have suffered less
than she suffers al
most-daily from the
inflammation which
disease has lighted in
the delicate womanly
organism.
That fire of inflam
mation can be put
out. The gnawing

received your reply very soon and then dis
missed my physician and began taking Dr.
Pierce's medicines. I took eight bottles of his
Favorite Prescription' and Golden Medical

two months I could sit up in a chair, and kept
getting better. In four months could do all my
house work, including washing and sewing."
