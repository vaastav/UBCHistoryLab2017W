A DELICATE TASK.
Congress Not Ready for
Business Yet.
The Committees Must First Be
Appointed.!
Some Speculation as to the Princi
pal Chairmanships.
Mills or Springer to Be at the Head of
tbe Committee on Ways and
Means—Congressional
Proceedings.
Associated Ftesa Dispatches.
Washington, Dec. 9.—Notwitstand
ing the fact that the organization of
both branches of congress has been
perfected in the main details, it still
remains for the managers of each end
of the capitol to supply committees be
fore the fifty-second congress can begin
the discharge of its proper functions.
Already the managers of both branches
are struggling with the problem how to
accommodate each aspirant for com
mittee appointment with his personal
preference withoat causing discontent,
and with due regard to public policy.
In the senate the only contest likely
to be expected is one relative to a com
mittee of minor importance—that on
library, where at least three senators —
Stock bridge of Mississippi, Dixon; of
Rhode Island, and Wolcott of Colo
rado it iv anxious to succeed the
late chairman, Mr. Evarts. A '
struggle is possible, however, over the
vacancy on the appropriation commit
tee, caused by Farwell's retirement.
Mitchell, who has been chairman of the
railway commission for two terms, ex
pects to fill Spoonor'a place as chairman
of the committee on claims. Casey of
North Dakota is as good as booked for
Mitchell's present position of chairman
of the committee on railways. Pos
sibly Wilson of lowa, though a member
of several hard-worked committees, may
be induced to accept the chairmanship
of the committee on education, vacated
by Blair, but this rather undesirable
place may be handed over to a new
senator. Hoar goes by order and prefer
ence to the head of the judiciary com
mission, vice Edmunds, resigned. Teller
takes his place as chairman of the com
mittee of privileges and elections. There
is some talk of giving Pefl'er a place on
the agricultural commission. Some
politics are involved in this, and
it may be that the Alliance
senator will secure a more desirable
place, as the result of the efforts of the
Republicans and Democratic managers
to keep bim on their respective sides.
Nobody has undertaken yet to place
Kyle, the South Dakota Alliance senator,
but the expressed views of Irby, the
South Carolina Alliance senator, has
caused him to be assigned to the mi
nority representation.
It 'is said on good authority that
Speaker Crisp had not up to today of
fered a single committee chairmanship
to any member of the house, and for
that reason reports as to his intentions
are purely speculative. The speaker has
to a few friends outlined the policy
which will govern him, as far as the in
dividual characteristics of the members
will permit, in the make-up of the com
mittees. He will, it is learned, endeavor
togive the west and the north prominence
and avoid, so far as possible, charges of
sectionalism. Mills is expected to be
tendered the chairmanship of the ways
and means committee, ou account of his
identification with the tariff reform
movement, hut personal considerations
may induce hitn to decline thiß honor
and preter a place as simply a member
of tiie committee. Ex-speaker Reed
and Mr. Barrows of Michigan are named
as tbe next Republican members of the
rules committee. There is reason to be
lieve that Springer is almost certain of
being a member of the ways and means
committee, if not chairman. Hol
man of Indiana is the most prom
inently mentioned representative for
the chairmanship of the appro
priations committee, but the name
of McMillin of Tennessee was today
also suggested. Hatch and Bland of
Missouri are stated for the chairmanship
of the agricultural and coinage, weights
and measures committee, and Amos
Cummings of New York is the probable
chief of the committee on merchant
marine and fisheries; the poatoffio -s
will go to Blount of Georgia, its chair
man in the fiftieth congress. Herbert
of Alabama has a sort of a prospective
rght to tbe naval affairs committee,
through being its former chairman, in
which position he had an influential
part in upbuilding the new navy. Outh
waite of Ohio is the probable chairman
i of the Pacific railways, unless he should
prefer the elections committee.

lands embraced iv the so called Norway
survey around Tulaie lake, California,
embracing about 108,000 acres, be certi

factory explanation.
BBITIBH COMMKNT*
How the President's Message Is Viewed
In England.
London, Dec. S.—Commenting on the
preaident'a message, the Post notices
with aatisfactiou the absence of signs of
bluater towards foreign nations, and
saya if the message meeta the ideas of
the president's party Blame's chances
are seriously diminished.
The Daily Newa saya: "The presi
dent's message leaves nothing desired
either in tone or temper. Harrison
is lesa exasperating than Blame, and
consequently more statesmanlike. He
would not speak ao tendeny of reciproc
ity if hia protection policy waa a buc
cesa."
The Standard saya : "Harrison's mes
sage is noticeable for its large devotion
to foreign affaire. Thiß showing is due
to Blame's fidgety activity. The presi
dent glides with his customary bland
optimisms over several mntiers hardly
doing credit to American diplomats. It
must be admitted that the figures be
quotes, although justifyingthe sangnine
hopes of the authors of the McKinley
law, are sufficient, to cause some sur
prise to adverse critics, both at home
and abroad."
A SCKNK IN COURT.
A Sensational Day lv the Kansas City
Embezzlement Trial.
Kansas City, Dec. 9.—The trial of
William Peake,ex-city treasurer, charged
with the embezzlement of $25,000, was
very sensational today. Prosecuting
Attorney Brown asked that evidence
might be introduced to prove the good
character of Horace McKim. Peake's
attorney, William Wallace, objected,
and becoming excited, declared that
McKim stole all of the money. Brown
denied thia and Wallace sprung at him,
striking him twice with hia hand before
the deputy marshal could separate
them. No damage was done. The
judge informed Wallace that he would
have to answer for contempt of court,
McKim stated that he would bring a
civil suit for damages against Wallace.

A LUNATIC AT LARGE.
A Mother Secures a Warrant For Her
Son's Arrest.
New York, Dec. 9.—Mrs. Francis V.
Stokes today secured a warrant for the
arrest of her aon, George Stokes, a luna
tic who is at large. He waa at one time
a lawyer, but was forced to flee the atate
on account of trouble he got into with a
man named Snilfen, the latter accusing
Stokes with alienating his wife's affec
tions. Stokes went to California, shot a
man, and was incarcerated in the in
sane asylum, from which he obtained a
release by legal proceedings. Since his
return to New York hia mother has
been in constant terror of her life, hence
she obtained a warrant for Die arreat.

CHILE WILL FIGHT.
The President's Message Has
Created Alarm,
But the Little Republic Will
Not Back Down.
Active Preparations for War-Guns
Ordered from Germany.
The Situation Complicated by Spain's
Demand for a Large Indem
nity—Two Foes to
Deal With.
Associated Press Dispatches.
New York, Dec. 9. —Under Valparaiso
date, the World prints thia: The sub
stance of President Harrison's state
ment on Chilean affairs was received
today, and i 8 a subject of universal
comment. It ia regarded by the Chile
ana as a decidedly threatening rupture,
aa it is not believed the Chilean govern
ment will consent either to an apology
or material indemnity. The majority
in congress is known to be opposed to
any concession, and the Chilean gov
ernment would find it difficult
to carry the necessary support for
any humiliating meaaurea. It ia now do
secret that the government is proceed
ing actively with warlike preparations,
and artillery of the latest manufacture
has been ordered from Germany. The
situation is complicated by Spain's de
mand for a large indemnity. The
Chileans have alwaya detested the
Spaniards and the hatred ia quickened
by this demand. They would challenge
Spain if they had not the United States
to deal with. Captain Schley refused
to express any opinion as to the preai
dent'a message, but waa evidently
pleased.
London, Dec. 9. —The Times today
publishes a dispatch from ita Santiago
de Chile correspondent, stating that in-
Buiting notes written to the government
by United States "Minister Egan and hia
telegrams to hiß government, caused the
proposition to be made that Chile aup
prees her legation at Waahington.
Thia proposition waa discussed at a
meeting of the finance committee of the
house of representatives last night, but
the government declined to Bupport the
proposal.
REBELS AGAIN DEFEATED.
Chinese Imperial Troops Following Up
Their Victories.
London, Dec. 9. —A dispatch was re
ceived today at the Chinese legation,
stating that the rebels in Northern
China had another engagement with
the imperial troops, and the insurgents
sustained a most crushing defeat. The
government forcea are following up
their victories, and the complete anni
hilation of the rebels ia expected in a
few days.
London, Dec. 9.—The Chronicle this
morning published a letter from its
Shanghai correspondent, in which he
repeats his previous assertion that the
present crisis in the Chinese empire is
not religious. He says a revolutionary
spirit fills the land. It is a species of
nihilism that haa seized the army, mem
bers of the official classes, even to the
oldest families of China, and servants in
the houses of Europeans. The pro-con
suls of the governors-general hold that
no revolution is possible, certainly not
successful, without them. Their pres
ent interest is against rebellion, because
they live by corruption. But if they
could be convinced that a revolution
would operate in their favor, the co
operation of all of them might be relied
on.
A dispatch to the Times from Tien Tsin
says some Christiana have been mas
sacred near Pekouscibe by banditti and
an undisciplined mob. The commander,
who connived at the massacre, haa com
mitted suicide. A magistrate impli
cated in the affair has been arrested
and committed for trial.
Advices are received here from Ran
goon, a town of India and the capital of
British Burmah, stating that serious
trouble is apprehended, as the Chinese
across the river are strengthening their
posts. The authorities have dispatched
reinforcements.
New York, Dec. 9.—The North China
Herald of October 10th received here,
reports of the Manchu rioters at Chian
kiang, that seventeen in all were taken
in a gunboat to Mankin, where they
were tried. Five men had banded
together and committed numerous
crimes. The viceroy and the Tartar
general sent memorials praying for per
mission to have the culprits beheaded.
DOM PEDRO'S FUNERAL,
Impressive Services Held for the Dead
Monarch in Paris.
Paws, Dec. 9. —The French govern
ment having determined to give to the
ex-emperor of Brazil a funeral, the
Place de la Madelaine waa today lined
with soldiers. A great crowd of people
was permitted to pass by the coffin
until the hour set for the funeral cere
monies. The church where the ser
vices were held was densely packed.
The mourning decorations were beauti
ful and elaborate.
Princess Isabella, Dom Pedro's daugh
ter and ex-princess imperial of Brazil,
and her husband, Count D'Eu, sat at
the right of the bier. They were accom
panied by their three sons.
Close by sat the members of
tbe royal family of France.
All the diplomats in Paris were in at
tendance. President Carnot was repre
sented by Genera! Brugere. To the left
oi the bier were seated ex-Queen Isa
bella of Spain, the Duchess de Ghatrea,
Countess Trapeni and the infanta Eu
lalie of Spain. The minister of Brazil
and a number of other dignitaries of
that country surrounded the catafalque.
The archbishop of Paris presided at
tbe religious ceremony, which was sol
emn and magnificent. When high mass
was concluded the coffin was carried to
the car waiting for it at the entrance of
the church. As it emerged from the
building the vast concourse uncovered
their heads. The troops presented arms
and the bands began playing the mourn
ful strains of the "Dead March in Saul."
The funeral car was drawn by eight
horses caparisoned in black, each led by
a servant. Bixteen noted Brazilians
acted aa pall-bearers. Following the
hearse came a number of officers bearing
tbe decorations and orders of the dead
ex-emperor. Then came ten coaches,
conveying the mourning relativea
of Dom Pedro, and these in turn
were followed by a large number
of Brazilians on foot. Following were
eight regimenta of cavalry and infantry
and a battery of artillerj, which accom
panied the remaina from the church to
the railway station. The whole route
followed by the funeral procession was
lined with thousands of people.
EUBOPEAN ZOLLVEBEIN.
The Debate on Germany's Commercial
Treaties About to Begin.
Berlin, Dec. 9.—The reichstag, today,
after a lively debate, carried by a large
majority a motion fixing tomorrow aa
the time for the debate on the queation
of the ratification of the new commer
cial treaties between Germany and Aus
tria, Germany and Italy, and Germany
and Belgium. Caprivi expects to secure
the ratification of the treaty before
Christmas. Caprivi will open
tbe discussion of the treaty. Ratifica
tion is being opposed by "thirty mem
bers, led by Herr Birbach, a Conserva
tive. The Hamburger Crichten advised
an exhaustive examination of the
treaties in committees. Bismarck haa
definitely atated that he will not attend
the debate.
In a speech tonight, Yon Caprivi, re
ferring to the French attacks on the
jurUverein, said they were only aerving
to cement "the league of peace." He
averred that negotiations were pending
for a reciprocity agreement with the
United States, but conveyed the impres
sion that he thought the favored nation
clause under tbe Clay treaty was not
valid without a fresh agreement, baaed
on mutual concessions.
Vienna, Dec. 9.—The reicbrath today
referred the zollverein treaties to a com
mittee of thirty-six.
.NOT USED FOR FILLERS.
Fraudulent Importation of Sumatra To
bacco by a San Francisco Firm.
New York, Dec. 9.—The New York
Leaf Tobacco board of trade held a
meeting today to take action regarding
Liebeß & Co.'s importation of Sumatra
tabacco, which has been the object of
much gossip among leaf tobacco dealers
in this country. Liebes & Co. of San
Francisco imported in separate importa
tions since the passage of the McKinley
bill 500 balea of Sumatra tobacco
from Amsterdam. The tobacco was
landed at New Orleans and shipped to
San Francisco, where it was entered as
Sumatra filler and passed by the local
apDraiaei. After reviewing the case the
board passed strong resolutious, aver
ring that no case was ever known where
Sumatra tobacco waa ever imported with
j intent to be used aa fillers. Any at
tempt to import Sumatra under the
class of fillers waa regarded with sus
picion as having been made with sin
ister motives; the duties on 500 balea
involve a difference to the government
of $150,000.
THE BOMB THRO WEB.
The Head of Basaell Sage's Assailant on
Exhibition.
New York, Dec. 9.—The head of the
dead bomb thrower was viewed by hun
dreds this morning. A plaster cast haa
been made of the head. Experts will
make another examination of the brain
tomorrow. Mra. Catherine Stumpf called
to Bee the head. She had a picture
of "Prof." A. A. Denton, which bore a
striking resemblance to the head. South
worth bad little to say today. Among
his effects has been found a ribbon like
that found Monday in Sage's wrecked
office. Russell Sage ia not expected at
his office thia week, but ia directing
business from home. Mesara. Osborne,
Robertson and Laidlaw, who * were
severely injured by the explosion, are
still confined to the hospital, but are
progressing towards recovery. The re
port that Sage positively identified the
man Phillips as his assailant appears to
be wholly unfounded.
OPERATORS WALK OUT.
Thirty Southern Paclflo Telegraphers Go
on a Strike.
San Francisco, Dec. 9.—Thirty tele
graph operators employed on the lines
of the Southern Pacific in Arizona and
New Mexico, went out on a strike today
