It will bo remembered that the Chron
icle strongly suggested the feasibility
last summer of some of our rich and
enterprising citieen taking hold of Col.
Carter's mill and erecting it at Bozeuian.
We did not succeed in inducing any one
to do so. In the meanwhile Helena
capital has tuken hold of a similar plant
at lied Bluff that was originally intend
ed for Davey & Son, and in two weeks
we confidently expect to see the Red
Bluff ores easily and profitably worked,
and nt no distant day the camp of Red
Bluff become one of the liveliest and
richest in the west. Only one drawback
can possibly returd its growth, and that
is the absence of coal in that vicinity!
but as teams can be procured, there need
be no grave apprehensions on tliat score.
However, how beneficial to tho town of
Bozeman it would have been, had the
mill been put up here, where coal is so
easily and so cheaply procured. It may
not yet be too late to procure a mill and
the right to use it in this county, as the
other, we understand, is in Madison; if
so, as a paying investment and as a sub
stantial aid to the upbuilding of the
town, the Chronicle hopes that no time
will be lost, after the practicability of
the Red Bluft mill is demonstrated, in
getting one located in Bozeman.
i TIIK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The President's message is the longest
he ever wrote, so long in fact tliat very
few newspapers will tackle it in its en
tirety. Ere this issue of the Chronicle
reaches all of its readers the message
will have been made public, as it. was, in
all probability, delivered to Congress
yesterday (Tuesday), aff Monday was
taken up for the organization. All pre
tended abstracts of the message publish
ed last week are simply speculation, as
the president allowed only tour of his
• trusted friends to see the message, and
placed it in the hands of the public
printer, informing him tliat if any of
it" prematurely Id&ked out he would
hold him personally responsible. Tho
public printer in turn gave it to a few
selected printers and informed them
that if any part of the message was made
public he would discharge every last
one of them. It will not bs revealed un
til after eongnss has heard it.
OUR POSITION.
Last week the Avant Courier contain
ed an article alluding to the unsavory
matter of Forschler & Mack.
As far as the uncalled-for allusions and
Chronicle arc ed ' tor
ing to say. The Chronicle never so far
forgets itself as to reply in kind to such
personalities.
But when the Courier undertakes to
assert that we will not sustain the posi
tion we have taken iu this Forschler &
Mack case, it makes a mistake.
Tho bribe of a three-dollar-a-month
advertisement will have no effect with
In short the Avant Courier may, if it
desires to do so, uphold those who
knowingly and willimrlv sold diseased
meat; but as for us we will protect , as
far as lays in our power, the public from
purchasing it.
With fifteen new Senators and one
hundred new Representatives in the
Fiftieth Congress, there will necessarily
be a re-organization of the committees
that will bo likely to have a very per
ceptible effect upon the business effici
ency of that body, for many of the most
vigorous workers—men like Logan,
Maxey, and Conger, of the Senate, and
Morrison, Warner, and Willborn, of the
House—have disappeared from the halla
of legislation, and their places are most
ly filled by inexperienced men. It may
seem strange to many that sagacious
Democratic leaders are really congratu
„ lating themselves upon the fact that the
party majority has been reduced from
about fifty to a baker's dozen. During
the last Congress, wheu tho Democratic
majority was large, there was so many
stray sheep from the fold, that it was
often difficult to muster the partv
strength when sorely needed; but in the
Fiftieth Congress, with a meager ma
jority for Democracy, all of our members
will realize their personal responsibility,
and be more attentive to duty. Thus,
this fact will inure to the benefit of tho
country, as well as the party.

It has longaeen a custom in the Fedei
al Departments, when the quota of a
state was full, to appoint Boum favorite
from such a state, and charge the ap
pointment to another state—a shameful
practice of the spoils system that has
crept into the civil service system. The
District of Columbia long ago secured
its full share of the Government officers,
yet its aspiring citizens are not satisfied
for it has come to the knowledge of the
Civil Service Commissioners that a num
ber of these people have procured a]>
pointmems by falsely representing them
selves as residents of the states. Upon
identification, these persons will be dis
missed from tl>e service, and new regu
lations have been adopted that will
prevent such shameless deception iu the
future.
The gr at value and importance of a
single vote is shown by the balance of
power now held by Senator Riddleber
ger, for the erratic Virginian is in a posi- 1
tion to almost decide the political com
plexion of the United States Senate by
his vote on the contests from Indiana, i
West Virginia, and California. Mr. Rid 1
dlebergerdeclares he will divest himself
of partisan bias, and endeavor to act pure- 1
ly in a judicial capacity. •
For the benefit of our somewhat mud- i
died e. c., we will inform it that the I
judge of this district decided the old
printing law and Yerkes' contract to be i
legal and binding. The jury merely had e
to determine how much the damages for e
breach of contract should be. That sev- i
en of theui were in favor of giving only s
one dollar, is nothing particulatly flat
t< Jing to their judgment or good sense. \
The President has had so many tariff s
inferences with prominent leaders of a
le Democracy, that it is not a difficult b
latter to anticipate the position he will j
ssume on this question in his message d
:> Congress. Encouraged by the verdict a
f New York, where victory was won on c
platform demanding a reduction of one \
Kindred millions in the revenue, Presi- t
lent Cleveland will uree the reduction (
»f the revenue to the above amount, t
vhich result it is proposed to secure by 1
tdding to the free list of imports and <
Hitting down the duties on the neces- ]
laries of life in such a way as not to i
increase the revenue, and also by the l
repeal of the tax on raw tobacco. (
Our esteemed cotemporarv, the Avant
Courier, has reached the seventeenth
mile post of its journey. And, although
the Chronicle has not been requested to (
refer to the fact, none are more willing
to wish the Courier seventeen more .
years of lif.-, under the management of
Hon. W. W. Alderson, than us. He is a ,
concise and pointed writer, and has
made his name known throughout the
length and breadth of Montana.

The citizens of Billings are protesting
with their wonted vigor against the re
moval of the Northern Indians to the
Crow reservation. We do not believe
that there is any danger of such a con*
tingency ; but a protest will do no harm
and may succeed in having the Crows
removed to the northern agencies, which
would decidedly be the moet proper
thing to do.
Now that the government and the
Park association are at war it is sugest
ed that the Northern Pacifis Railroad be
allowed to run the hotels in the Park.
The railroad campauy would certainly
see to it that all guests were well fed,
especially if said guests came to tho
Park via the N. P. railroad.
The Chronicle builded better than it
knew. When it said our "Bull pup fs
Victorious'' it did not suppose that the
Courier would devote quite as much
Bpace to a reply. One whole page is
more than we expected. By the way
the Courier has done much to advertise
tho Chronicle and make its merits
known.

Democratic Senators Iii I'aucufl.
Washington, Dec. ".—A fully attended
caucus of democratic senators convened
this afternoon to hear the final report of
the committee appointed to outline a
plan of action with regard to the admis
sion of new democratic senators, against
whose title some question had been
raised. The committee, consisting of
Senators Pugh, Blackburn, Harris and
Vest, reported that it had carefully con
sidered all the facts in the ease of Sena
tors Turpie, of Indiana, Faulkner, of
West Wirginia, and all other new demo
cratic senators, and reached the conclu
sion that all were fully entitled to their
seats, and so far as the democrats could
influence the matter they should be
Bworn in on Monday.
The unanimous opinion of the caucus
was that no departure from precedent
lould be made, and no obstacle to the
Jmission or all the senators elect should
e anticipated. The committee also re
orted they had examined all the cre
entials of the republican senators elect
nd found several upon which objections
ould legitimately ue based. The facts
rere laid before the caucus and discuss

al it was determined to make no objec

A Protest.
At a mass mating of tho citizens of
Billings last Tuesday night, the following
preamble and resolution protesting
against the transfer of any of the north
ern Montana Indians to the Crow reser
vation, were adopted by a unanimous
Whereas, We are informed that efforts
are being made to effect the removal of
the Indians of northern Montana from
their present homes to the reservation of
the Crow tribe, and.
Whereas, In the portion of Montana,
contiguous to tho Crow reserve, cities,
towns and villages are being built and
the wilderness transformed into pro
ductive farms by a sturdy and patriotic
people, who have settled and invested
their all here, believing that in the
natural course of events in the near
futtiae the Crow tribe would in the main
be settled upon lands in severalty, and
lands of their reserve not needed by
them, would be thrown open and settled
upon by an industrious white population,
which event would materially advance
the interests of the country at lanre and
the Indian question as to the Crow be
forever at rest; and,
Whereas, The Crow Indians are be
coming more and more disposed to settle
upon lands in severalty and adopted the
ways of white man (many of them having
irtmfsslccx'i;.;«'Sv'te
tribes would ere long with proper treat
ment becomes a self-supporting, pros
perous and happy people, and,
Whereas, If the northern tribes were
to be located on the Crow reserve as
contemplated, Uiobo of the Crows who
have not settled on land, but are disposed
to do so, would most assuredly abandon
all thought of it; and those who are
settled would bedisturbed, unsettled and
checked in theirprogrcss towards civiliza
tion for years to come by reason of
crowding together of the many turbulent
spirits of the predatory tribes alluded to,
and the white people instead of having
civilized Indians and white men for
neighbors as tliey anticipated, would
have for neighbors horde of untaimcd
savages.
Therefore, bo it resolved, That we,
the people of Yellowstone county in
mass meeting assembled do, in the in
tei«st of ourselves, our families and the
Crow Indians, most earnest ly and solemn ■
ly protest against tho locating of the
tribes mentioned or any other tribe of
Indians on the Crow reserve as Iteing
impolitic, unwise and unjust. All of
which is most respectfully submitted.
Butte atirt Bozeman.
It is now well understood that the
Northern Pacific will extend its Helena
& Boulder Valley branch to Butte, and
those who ought to know say that it will
be in operation to this camp by the time
Montana Central is completed, if not
sooner, the work on its line between
Calvin's and Butte being generally light.
Before the branches is well in operation
arrangements will be made to complete
the loop by building the direct line from
Pipestone Pass to Gallatin. This road
will be of greater value to Butte than
any other ot the short lines in contem
plation, as it will bring her nearer to
Eastern terminals than Helena now is,
shortening the distance as comjiared
with present routes by about 125 miles.
It will open shorter and direct com
munication with all the best coal de
posits in Montana, at Timherlinc, Trail
Creek, Livingston and Rocky Fork, and
the consequent reduction in the cost of
coal and coke will be worth millions of
dollars annually to the industries of this
camp. This line will not stop in Butte,
but it will be pushed to a connection
with the main line at some point farther
West, and will bocomo the main lino
itself. It is quite natural to conclude that
the through passenger trains will bo run
on the shortest and most direct line,
where there is the greatest passenger
traffic, and Butte will of course continue
to furnish her best outlets with the
heaviest passenger traffic, as she does iu
freights. In building this short line the
Northern Pacific will simply rectify a
grave mistake, that has cost it many
millions of dollars and entailed great
loss to this camp. A few weeks ago The
Miner referred to the fact that the Ore
gon Transcontinental would devote its
newly acquired funds to the construc
tion of a system of branches, the most
important of which was the branch from
Lewiston on Snake River, to Butte. This
road would give Bntte direct connection
with Portland, making a saving of about
1 7 5 miles as compared with present
routes, and would open up a series of

Live Stock Movement.
The widely circulated reports of tho
loss of cattle in Montana last winter
were such as to convey the idea that
there would be a heavy falling off in the
live stock traffic this fall. The conclusion
however, ib not warranted by the facts
as the figures will show. The Northern
Pacific has hauled east from Montana
and western Dakota this season 72,450
head of beef cattle against 80,930 in 1886,
a decrease of only 8,480 head, hast year
2,280 head of cattle were shipped east
from Washington territory, but on ac
count of the coast demand being greater
this year more were shipped, so that the
shortage from Montana and western Da
kota is only 0.200 head. The number
of sheep brought to market this year by
the Northern Pacific road was 99,033
head, against 110,525 head last year, a
decrease of 10,892 These figures show
a decrease in thestock movement of only
ten per cent., whereas conservative
judges had estimated ot least fifty per
cent, as whole flocks of sheep were lit"
erally wiped out last winter. In spite of
the losses of last winter and the decline
in the market stockmen are now plan
ning to replenish their ranges, and next
year will see large numbers of cattle
driven into Montana and western Dakota.
Tho officers of the Northern Pacific road
are v<yy much pleased with the showing

The census of the Crow Indians for
warded on June 30th exhibits the facts,

year from records of a census take sever
al years previous. In future there will
be but little trouble iu keeping a correct
count.as the reservation is divided into
agricultural districts, each in charge of
a farmer who is instructed to keep an
account of the births aud deaths, re
porting tho same at the office monthly,
thereby preventing any fraud on the
part of the Ihdians regarding the actual

There was a train collision Tuesday ,

leavy freight, was also on the road from

inductor rushed into the passenger car
ind shouted to those en board to jump
vhich they did. The freight locomo
;ive crushed half way through the pas
lenger coach, raising it on top of tho

>ut matters another train came along
ind wrecked the caboose of the first

•lightly injured. Conductor Minty be
ing the worst hurt, getting his nose
broked and bad bruises about the head
ind shoulders. Hon. Sam Word, was
ibroad the train run into and a consequ
ence bears a pair of lustrous black eyes.

"While congress is agitating the sub
ject of a disposition of the treasury sui

ly solicitor general under President Lin
coln's administration, "it would bo well
worth its while to investigate the needs
of the west, and; incidentally, the con
dition of the Yellowstone park. Here
is a prouerty that we point out to
tourists as the national park, for which
last year an appropriation of a paltry
$20,000 was made for improvements
which urgently require, at the lowest
estimate, $500,000 for roads alone. -Under
existing circumstances visitors do not
see more than half of thiB park, and
principally for the reason that there are
no roads deserving such a title in the
whole of this vast domain, the greatest
natural curioBity in the world. "Expend
ing money in improving the park would
attract thousands of visitors who are now
deterred from such a trip by the stories
that are related as to the disgrac ifi.l
condition of what Bhould be the high
ways of the government." "An effort
has been made to make it appear that
the hotels should be held responsible
for this, whereas, as a matter of fact, the
hotels have no voice in the matter, and
cinuot even cut down a tree or improve
a road in the neighborhood. I remem
ber on one occasion the park association
which now controls the hotels, wanted
to cut a road through a portion of tho
park, and agreeded to do it at their own
expense, but the government would not
entertain tho proposition. The cut
would have been of great advantage in
point of accessibility to one of the large
hotels, and when, after numerous and
vexations delays, the road was made
along the line proposed by tho associa
tion, the hotel, which had just been
erected, was destroyed by fire.

HOW SHE "WARBLED.
£2 She was taking a
Sjvr* toip on the railroad,
and the day was a
y\ ^ \WA perfect charm. She
■Odft Wil rc Bt ed her head
TT n \ 'gainst the window
looked far away to the meadows, far
away to the changing whirl, and the draft
thronghacrack of the window lifted each
pendant curl. Was it a dream or a vision
or a scene in the green fur off? For she
sighed with a gentle murmur and then
was convulsed with a cougli. Just then
came a friend to her elbow, a companion
who came to rejoice, aud she turned with a
smile to greet her, but lo! she had lost her
voice. Yes; just in that little second, as
her eyes on the landscape gloat, that draft
through tho open crevice had closed up
her delicate throat. And alas! in a Hear
ing city she was to sing on the stage tl at
night. What could she do so voiceless
but to weep at her pitiful plight? Now
the friend who had watched her dilemma
drew forth from her satchel a cure. St.
Jacobs Oil it was labeled; a remedy
famous and sure. An external use on the
throttle, well rubbed to remove the cause,
she will always carry a bottle, for she
sang that night with applause. "New York,
N.Y., July 6,1887.—Yon may rely on what I
told you about the positive cure by St.
Jacobs Oil, which remedy I used on my
wife (professionally known as Patti Rosa).
In Hartford, after doctors stating she
could not recover before four weeks, St.
Jacobs Oil cured her in three days, and
she has not had a pain since. Iler complaint
at that time was nerve neuralgic rheuma
tism, and I can assure you she was a great
sufferer. I have never failed in advising
all whom I have met that were complain
ing to use St. Jacobs Oil. If this letter is
of any value you are entirely welcome.
Very resp'y, R. L. Scott, 239 E. 14tli St."

drafts and exposure, it is indispensable.
