-In the Senate a bill has been intro
duoed to pension soldiers of the Mexican
"and other wars." Jeff. Davis will un
doubtedly renew his claims, notwithstand
ing Mrs. Dorsey's kindness, now that
Chandler is out of the way.
-Boecher has been moralizing again.
This time it was over Gilman th pardoned
forger. One of the sentences, however,
is to the point. He said: " Men that be
lieve in and are protected by the law find
it the most difficult thing in the world to
giye sympathy to the man that has broken
the law."
-From the,reference to "Timber Depre
dations" in the President's Message, it ap
pears the administration realize the timber
situation in the Territories and will inter
pose no more suits against those necessarily
cutting timber on the public domain here
-at least until a law is enacted enabling
the purchase of timber for actual and
necessary use in the Territory.
-Deacon McKee, of St. Louis, is credit
ed with having originated the "Third
Term Boom." As Grant has not been in
vited to visit the future great, it looks as
though the converts to the Deacon's faith
are but few in that section of the country,
if we are to believe that the invitation has
not been extended on account of a split in
Republican ranks there. But give some
other reason. Grant's receptions have
not been political meetings.
-The present term of Court, involving
the summoning of so many jurors, is sug
gestive of many amendments that might
be made to the laws for the public good.
As it is now, a man is required to be a tax
payer and a full citizen before he can serve
as a juror on a criminal case, but by taking
out his "first papers" he is endowed with
almost all the rights, privileges and bene
fits of a citizen without being enacmbered
with many of the responsibilities and
duties of a citizen. There is something
unfair about this. If action should go no
further the assessor should at least be re
quired in making his assessment to swear
each person as to their citizenship and thus
relieve the counties of the expense attend
ant upon summoning persons to attend as
jurors who cannot serve, and who are
called from their business at heavy expense
to themselves and the county. This defect
could be eabily remedied by the method
suggested.
-We publish in this issue a letter signed
F' Fair Play," relating to a paragraph in
last weeks paper and other circumstances
relating to the Drouillard murder. We ob
tained and published Mrs. Drouillard's
testimony as being the first authentio
statement of the circumstances attending
the killing of Moses Drouillard. After the
testimony was in type, on the day of the
issue of the paper, a statement of Mrs.
Droollard's retraction was made to us by
a gentleman whose word we deemed en
tirely reliable. We took a memorandum
of the remarks and read them to our in
formant for verification, and have them yet.
The evidence of Mrs. Dronillard against
MoKay was very strong, although the jury
a.uaitted him, and we believed if Mrs.
Diallard had retracted her sworn evi
dioce as stated, it was right to give McKay
ibenefit of it. We think so yet. If she
Snoet make the statement that is a dif- i
- .-let matter.
p. -Seeretary 8churs has sent the follow
Â¢'inag telegram to General Hatch, of the Ute
Commission, at Los Pinos Agency. "Re.
osive surrender of Indians designated by
your commission, with the understanding
that they will be guaranteed a fair trial by
a mihltary commission outside of Colorado I
and New Mexico. Inform Ouray that he
will be received here with four or five Un
compahgre and three Southern Utes. Take
eare that great and influential men be
selected, espeeially from White River Utes.
It will probably be desirable to have Jack
here. Take possession of prisoners with
military guard and convey them in the first 1
place to Fort Leavenworth." It is diffi
uonlt to foretell what punishment, if any, I
will be meted to the onwardly Uteassassine.
Banishment to the Indian Territory is not
punishment; and even this method of dis
posing of unruly hostles is to be abandon
ed. A bill has been introdcoed in Congress
looking to this end. But the murderers,
thieves and demons of Indian tribes send
representatives to Washington. This is
well enough in the case of Ouray whose
friendship to the whites is true as steel,
aod will doubtless be lasting as life itself.
He and his friends should be rewarded; the
murderers and their allies should be legally
tried and, if proven guilty, legally hung.
The remainder would retarn to their reser
vation imbued with new ideas of oivilisa
tion of right and wrong, and be content
to forbear a repetition of suck blood-shed
ding atrocities as that by which Meeker
and his gallant men met their doom.

THE LO03 CASU.
The finding of the jury in the Lobb oase
after sa boar's deliberation was a surprise
to many who recollected the disagreement
of a former jury on the question, of man
slaughter and the apparently credible to
port that the jury stood nine to three for
acquittal. We believe; however, ti A"d
iag to be absolutely jna, amd do not see
what othe verdict could have been return
ed under the evidencemad the law govern.
Slg the ease. And it was a very -ecullar
ease. In brief, Lobb was a nbght v.toh
man at Batt and evdently believed be
bhad a right to make .arrests. On the eve

Sllver Bow Saloon to sappreis a row . n

privileges of an officer in making an arrest
for a misdemeanor. There is no warrant
of law for an officer shooting down a per
son committing a simple misdemeanor if
he is somewhat unruly and boisterous and
ugly to handle. The law prescribes penal
ties for such resistance and the officer is
authorized to summon assistance. When
the resistance results in assault upon the
officer, he has a right to repel it to such an
extent as he may reasonably consider nec
essary to protect himself and accomplish
his purpose; but it does not follow that he
shall shoot or kill recklessly or upon slight
provocation. The law governing this .ase
and the case as proven were presented very
ably by District Attorney Mayhew, and the
instructions of Judge Galbraith were am
ple and clear. The case involved an im
portant and delicate point of law. No
other verdict could be returned under the
testimony and law than that rendered. al
though popular sympathy was largely
with the prisoner,and we think that he was
right except as to the extreme act, the
better judgment is that justice has been
subserved by the verdict. It is necessary
in Montana that violent offenses against
the law shall be rigidly investigated, fair
verdicts rendered and infractions punished.
In an era of crime like the present the laws
of the land must be impartially adminis.
tered and justice meted out to all. The
threatening shadows of anarchy that are
projected from horrid deels and violent
minds can only thus be dispelled and Law
and Order maintained in integrity.and
sacredness. It behooves every good citi
zen to realize the importance of the issue;
to obey and sustain the law ; to be stead
fast in that faith; to realize that in the
Courts the accused and the accuser have
their rights; that judicial determinations
are in the full light of facts under the so
lemnity of oath controlled by just laws,and
that these determinations are worthier of
confidence and respect than can be the
opinions of individuals or the hasty conclu
sions of irresponsible judgment. We have
held and hold that the laws, the courts and
the officers of Montana are adequate for
the administration of even and equal jus
tice in this Territory, and the finding in
the Lobb case is in vindication of that
faith.,

THE BIG HOLE BATTLE FIELD.
Leunt.James A. Bradley's Grave Robbed of the
Body.
Special Correspondence New North-West.
TERMINUS U. & N. R. R., Nov. 30.-At
the close of our brief interview' on the 18th
inst. I took the coach from Deer Lodge
and up the Bitter Root yalley via Stevens
ville and Corvallis to Skalkaho. Thence,
mainly on horseback and alone, I pressed
up the Bitter Root and Ross' Fork to Big
Hole Pass and the battlefield ; from thence
to the plain, Bannack and Horse Prairie to
the stage line fifty miles from here. I
found three to six inches of snow between
Deer Lodge and Missoula, very little in
the Bitter Root valley, at least a foot in
Big Hole Pass and on the battlefield, less
toward Bannack apd none south of it. The
weather, save a terrible mountain storm at
the Hot Springs in Grasshopper Pass, was
clear but intensely cold--said to have been
150 below zero at Bannack. The streams,
especially Ross' Fork, were badly frozen
and dangerously gorged.
THE BATTLE FIELD.
I readily found the Big Hole Battle field,
and also found and brought away the small
bead board and tin camp plate rudely in
scribed with the name of Lient. James A.
Bradley; but the fragment of horse hide
mentioned by those gentlemen in Deer
Lodge as being on his grave was
some 20 feet from it, and the grave was
Merta4nly empty, as deep excavation in the
grave and long and and anxious searchb in
the snow nearly knee deep around it re
realed neither fragments of bone nor cloth
ig, nor do I believe they will ever be
rotnd by those who can identify them.
the fragment of horse bide near his grave
bad been dragged and gnawed during the
sight by a paeek of coyotes, and the count.
oes trails of them and of foxes sad wol
rerines upon all portions of the field are
proof positive that they still hold nightly
-arnivals in visiting, unearthing, upturn
ag and gnawing the fragments of bones, I
slankets and clothing still profusely scat
siel over the willow dotted and bordered
sttlefield.
A BUOGBTION.
These ghostly sones only sustain my
long-cherished oonviotion of the propries),
if not, indeed, the positive duty, of our
government to, at the earliest practicable
moment, ousbe the bones of the fallen,
ofiers and soldiers, upon each of our In
dan battle fields, to be carefully removed
to some prominent point upon or near it,
marking as well as possible for ident.fca
tion and removal of each, if desired, and
erecting a fttlng memorial over those who
remain, so that future generations may re- I
member and revere those who on gory
battlefields perished to protect the pioneers
of civilization along our vast and ever im
perilled frontier.
In Interesting conversations with both
military men and oitizeas of Bitter Root
valley who participated in the battle sad
the buralof the falln, I never beard the
opinion expressed that the mmauis of
Liet,. Bradley had ever bean removed amve
by wild animals, but at Bamnnek I did ear
a rumor that they had been romoved-to

TU LOBB TRIAL.
Lo0mayraDo ~OtM tIRSm PA'a.)
Elmas Lytle swer Am Deputy Sheriff amd was also
Feb. 16.1987, night watchman is Butte. Went to
Butte in December, '8; Lobb was acting as night
watchman and remained in that position. He made
arrests with me and many without me. Prisoners
were treated the same as If I had arrested them. Was
in Butte when Overeon was shot Had been in bed
and as I came along by Nissler's saloon saw a crowd
around the door. Heard some one say "Look out,
some one will get shot." Heard men quarrelling.
Pushed my way through the crowd at the door and
heard Lobo say, "You are my prisoner." Knew Lobb's
voice. Heard another yoice say, "You are a s- of a
b- if you think I mun." Did not know who said this.
I stepped up and put my hand on Nisaler and another
man-did not know him as he had his back to me.
Just then a shot was fired. Overson (the other mao)
swung around and half fell, catching on his hands.
Did not see any blows struck. The two men had hold
of Lobb when the [hot was fired. There were more
men around. A number were under the Influence of
liquor. The whole house seemed to be in an uproar.
Saw a little blood on Lobb's face. When I caught
Nlasler Lobb said "All right." Never knew Lobb to
take a drink of liquor. Knew his personal habits in
timately when I was there. Think the Slver)Bow sa
loon had paid Lobb for watching. Lobb gencrally
collected for us. On cross examination said "Would
not swear the man shot was Overson. The man had
his hand on or hold of Lobb's lappel. Lobb had hold
of Niesler with his right hand and Nissler hold of
Lcbb with his left. If Lobb fired it must have been
with his left hand. Lobb did not have hold of Over
son, Lobb was acting in capacity of night watchman.
Think the night watchman should preserve the peace
as well as look out for fires.
Re-direct-Night Watchmen are usually called upon
to, and do, make arrests in Butte and take prisoners
before the court.
Comm Examination-Night watchmen there were
generally Deputy Sheriffs.
Irvine Sandy sworn: This witness gave a great
deal of testimony. The main points were, that after
McGreggor was taken out Lobb cameout of the saloon
and said, "Where is that fellow 7" Somebody said,
"Come In here Jack; some one has a knife." Fol.
lowed Lobb in; saw one man choking another over
the bar. Lobb went up, put his hand on one and said
"You are my prisoner." Nisaler said "No; you can't
arrest any man in my house." Lobb let-go the first
man and seized Nissler. The latter strucK Lobb as
Lobb started toward the door with Nisaler. Lobb
called for help in the name of the Territory to arrest
that man. Witness seized the smaller man, threw
him away and told him to stay there until he was
wanted. Stride then ran up and grabbed Lobb [wit
ness afterward said he did not get to Lobb] when wit
nas pushed him away and told some one to take him
away. Saw Overson striko at Lobb past Nissler.
Just then the crowd swung around and I heard a shot.
Then saw Overson go out of door in stooping posi
tion. Thought it was Overson because he had canvas
coat on and looked like him. The men around Lobb
were ' full" and excited. When shot was fired Lobb
was right up against the side of the house and Niasler
had hold of him. Overson struck at Lobb twice; hit
himoa the-head once Thinkthere were 60 or 70 men
in the house. Saw no weapons. Corroborated lan
guage of Nisaler. Heard Lobb command the peace
and tell the men he wouljl arrest them. Am satisfied
the man struck Lobb was the man who went out
shot.
Oncross-examination said: Was standlng by th e
bar, about 8 or 10feet from Nissler and Lobb. I step.
ped away as they came near me. Al. Buell was with
them. Recognized Overson by his canvas coat. Oth
era had canvas coats on. Saw Stride go to get at
them when they were back by the wall. J stopped
Stride. Was taking hold of Overson when the shot
was fired. Saw three men trying to strike Lobb.
When Stride started he said, " Let me get at the a
-" Heard Stride and half dozen others say Over
son had no business there.
This witness was subjected to a rigid cross-exami
nation and one point in his former evidence he did
not again testify to.
On conclusion Court adjoarned ntil 9 a. inm., Mo n
day.
Michael Gallagher sworn: Was in Silver Bow sa
loon at time of shooting. House was fall and men
drinking freely. Two men were quarrellng at bar.
Lobb came in and told them to behave or he would
arrest them. One said, "No son of a - can ar
rest me. Lobb laughed, It was McGregor and
Ryan who were quarrelling, Lobb seized one,and he
got Lobb over toward the wall. Lobb called.me to
help arrest the man. Just then I saw a man going up
with a knife; caught him and mnade him put up the
knife. [Testimony as to Lobb sesinga NIssler cor
roborate.], After Nisler struck Lsbb; 6 or 8 men
ruahed up and commenoed striking at Labh. Heard
the shot but did not see it fred. They were near the
stove when shot was r.d. There wes airnskae row.
Nissler and several other men struck Lobb. Baw
Overson strike Lobb. Was about four feet from Lobb
when shot was Bred. Lobb said he was an officer.
Lobb semea to be over agalst the table when shot
was fired; he had stumbled just a moment before.
Croes Examined-Was in the saloon a half hour
before therow. Two men were quarrelling. They
seemed full of whisky. Lobb told them to keep still.
McGrggor told Ryan,wlth whom he was quarrelling,
he could lick any--Canadian-----in Butte. Lobb
told him to keep still or he would arresathm. He did
arrest him. McGreggor pushed Lebb over by the
wall. Ryan had the knife-a large jack-knife. Mc
lreggor got away while 1 was with Ryan. Lobb
then caught Nissler. Nialer kept striking at Lobb
until shot was fired. Saw Nlisler strike Lobb once
and then keep punching at him. Don't know he
struck him any more. Jim Danson was one of the
men who was striking at Lobb. Saw Overson going
oat. He said he was shot. Saw Overson in the
crowd around Lobb. Knew Overson by sight. He
had on a light-colored suit. By" light"I mean "not
black." Sew Overson strike or 8 times at Lobb.
Lobb said to me, " Gallagher, come here and help me
arrestthis man." When Igot to him he said "Take
him o," or "Take him away." When I took hold of
Ryan I said, "Put that away." He put his knfe up:
put it in his right hand pocket. Saw the knife plain
ly. Before Lobb fired I said to him, "Look out; a
man has a knife out." Saw or 7 striking at Lobb.
Ryan was calling McGreggor hard names. Think
Lytle came in after the shot was red. Lytle said,
" What's the matter " Think he went up toward
the door.
About mntes after the shot was itd I sawa
man pull a pistol out of his coat pocket and say, "1
abeeled; if any a- of a b- wants to arrest me now
let him do it." The man was Jim Denson. Think
thib was just after Lytle came in. It was a pccket
yllnder pistol. He pat it back in his pocket. He
was one of the men around Lobb. It might have
beaen ten minutes after shot was fred.
Dennis Simpson sworn: My shop adjeins Silver
Bow Saloon. Heard fuss in saloon Feb. 16, 189.
Went todeor of saloon. Met Billy Pasoe taking Mc
Greggor away; they took him up street, Lobb came
across the street. Stood in door. Saw a man in
there with a knife in his hand.. Some one told Lobb,
and said, "Go in and arrest him," and pushed Lobb
in. Matt Ryan he the knife. As Lobb wentin Ryan
shboved e knife in his pocke opn. Next saw Niss

toward the door. .i.ler had Leb with hishhands

from the table at thetime. There were 5 or 60 or
75 men in the hoasetm the time. The men striking
at defendant were apparently intoxieated.
Cros Examined-I went with defendant across the
street; was about or 8 feetfnom and behind him.Did
not hear him say anythng about shooting fay one.
Think I would recollect it he had done so. Did not
see Sandy with us. Think Hoses Fisher was in front
of saloon as we went over. Saw I to 6 men stilking
at defendant. Saw Overeon strike two blows at de
fendant; he hit defendant once about the face. Some
of the men had hold of defendant. I aas trying to
helpJack [Lobb]. Do not recollect of seeing Sandy
or Gallagher there. I intended to help defendant ..t
of the crowd. Overson struck defendant over my
right shoulder. Saw his hand come down on Jack's
face. Seemed to strike him hard enough to make his
face bleed.
Charlas Cole sworn-Went in saloon; heard defend.
ant command the peace. He said if there was any
more trouble he would make an arrest. Nies.er
ordered him out; if he wanted him, would send for
him. The quarrell continued, [Witness corroborated
arrest]. Nissler got hold of defendant and struck
him 4 or 5 times. [Described melee.] Heard shot
fired. Defendant's face was bleeding. Men in the
saloon generally appeared to be drunk.
Cross Examined-Followed defendant into saloon.
Heard him command the peace. Defendant then
went out and returned. Defendant then tried to ar
rest two men at the bar. Atter Nissler strcek defea.
dan; the whole crowd seemed to interfere. Did not
assist defendant. Saw Overson striking toward de
fendantjust about the time shot was fired. Never
saw Overson before. He had canvas clotheson.
When shot was fired Overson half fell, and caught on
his hands. Nismler struck defendant on top of head.
Knew Buell, Sandy and Gallagher. Did not see either
render assistance to defendant.
John W. Howell sworn-Corroborated the quarrel,
defendant commanding peace, arrest' and assault of
Nissler. Heard some one say, " Arrest that man; he
has a knife." Don't remember seeing Overson. The
parties were near the stove when the shot was fired;
there were 4 or 5 men around defendant at the timhe.
Cross Examined-When defendant came in he4riqd
to make an arrest. The persons resisted byrefoa g
to be arrested and striking at him. Saw'ose uafu
strike him. Saw no weapons drawn. The man mqk
ing demonstrations against defendant seemed to .be
intoxicated. Was a stranger in Butte. Did not
know any of the parties.
Manson T. Lobb aworn-Am defendant In this case.
Was in Butte Feb. 16, 1879; [was acting at that time
as Deputy Sheriff], oblected to and ruled out; made
several arrests in Butte. Went into Silver Bow sa
loon, Matt Ryan and hMcreggor were at the bar.
The latter struck the former between the shoulders.
Told them they must keep quiet, MicGreggor called
me rough names. I stepped back, He said he could
lick any - I arrested him. He struggled with
me and we got over against the wall. I had a pair of
hand cuffs in my pocket and tried to get them out.
Pascoe eame up and said he would take hMcGreggor
off to bed. I stepped out of the door. Some one
said there was a man had a knife out in the house.
Saw a man haves knife. Nissler saw me then. Saw
two men quarrelling at the bar. Left Niesler and went
to them, Told one he was my prisoner, when Niss
ler came up, called me-- and struck me on the
nose. Then Overson came up with the crowd, and
thcy-rewded me. Orerson struckme once and then
caught my head with both hands from behind and
pulled me back and then came in front and struck at
me. I thought they might get me down and beat me
to death. I pulled my pistol and fired. Was about
eight feet from the stove then.
Cross Examined-Was night watchman from the
7th of Nov. '78 to 16th of Feb., '79. Never had a
written appointment as Deputy Sheriff. Niesler
struck me. Overson struck me in the mouth and
knocked a tooth loose. Stride and Boyd wanted me
to pull off my coat and fight them after the shooting.
Told theml was an oficer and could not do 't. Over
son was striking at me when I shot. Saw Itallagbar
present at the first quarrel. He told me a man had a
knife. Didn't see Sandy. Fired the pistol with my
left hand. I shot Overson.
Here the defense closed.
RZBUTTAL.
James S. MeAndrews, Sheriff, called and swern,bat
no evidence elicited.
Fred Overson-My brother had only one eye. His
left eye was goneand he kept it closed all the time.
Never saw it opened. Think it was very noticeable.
James Stride-Was in Silver Bow saloon Feb. 16th.
Went up and inquired what the trouble was. Did not
resiset defendant. He seized me by the collar and told
me I was his prisoner. Baid "All right, if I have
done anything wrong arrest me." He then pulled me
down on my knees. Never saw a man named Sandy.
Had no trouble with him or any one else. Didn't see
Overson there. Didn't see defendant at the time of
shooting.
C' issxEzamined-Had been in the saloon quite a
while. Was oft When defendant came in; was there
two hours. Had taken a glass of beer or so of and
on-probably 8 or 4 glasses. Didn't see auy knife or
hear bard names clld. Just went up to see t
they were talking about; am liable to do that drunk or
sober. Knew several men m the saloon. Didn't
pull of my coat and offer to fight defendant after the
slabotti. I was not drank; didn't offer to ight any
body. Didn't see much fuss. A good many came in
after the shooting. Didn't go up to defendant or
Nlssler when they were scuffling: was not having any
difficulty when defendant came up to arrest me.
Simon P. Grim recalled-Was l13or 15 feet from de
fendant when shooting occurred. Did not see any
one have hold of Overson. Knew him; think he had
hold of defendant. Did not see Overson strike de
fendant. Think if he had done so before the shot I
would have seen him. A very short time before the
shot was fired he might have done so but I did not see
it.
Here the testimony closed. As will be seen it was
very conflicting, not only as related to immaterial but
essential facts. The testimony of several witnesses,
especially for the defense, difered materially from
that given by them before the Justice's Court at Butte 1
and the District Court in April. The cross examina
tio, which was principally conducted by Mr. Polbls,
seemed chiefly directed to exposing the discrepancies
between former and present testimony and thus de
prediating the credibility of witnesses. When, how
ever, the testimony closed the ijury could have no dft- 1
fculty in compreheading.all the essential facts of the
affair.
THWO AnRUxNTs AND VEDICT.
Thursday, Dec. 9.--The testimony having dosed
Mr. Forbis for the prosecution addressed the jury for
twenty minutes, briesy reviewing and referring to the
disrepant testimony of the defense. His speech e elic
ited marked attention and was a worthy effort. Mr.
Napton followed in an able speech of forty minutes,
dwelling on the testimony relattng to Lobb's presence
in the saloon as a conservator of the peace, his ac
tions in that capacity and the violence he was sub
jeted to in the discharge of his duty, and arguing
therefrom his intent and justlfcation in using his
pistol. Mr. Stapleton followed in a somewhat longer
aruament, aralvying the evidence and presenting a.
strung plea for the defendant. He will occupy an ea
inent position at the Deer Lodge bar. District Atter
ney Mayhew closed the argument in an address of an
hour sad a half, in which he sifted the evidence,cl ted
the laws governing the case, presenting the tullent
features of one and the bearing of the other in a coin.

EXTRACTS FROM
THE PRESIDENT'S IESSAGE
AM#rNed to gonius Dec. 1; 879.
THE SUPPRESSION OF POLYGAMY.
The centinued deliberate violation by a
large number of the prominent and influ
ential citizens of the Territory o: Utah of
the laws of the United States for the prose
cution and punishment of polygamy, de
mands the attention of every department
of the government. This Territory has a
population sufficient to entitle it to admis
sion as a State, and the general interest of
the nation, as well as tue welfare of the
eitizens of the Territory, require its ad
vance from a Territorial form of Govern
ment to the responsibilities and privileges
of a State. This important change will
however (not) be approved by the country
while the citizens of Utah, in very con
siderable number, uphold a practice which
is condemned as a crime by the laws of all
civilized communities throughout the
world. The law for the suppression ot
this offense was enacted with great unani
mity by Congress more than 17 years ago,
but has remained until recently a dead
letter in the Territory of Utah, because of
the pecuhliar difficulties attending its en
forcement. The opinion widely prevailed
among the citizens of Utah that the law
was in contravention of the Constitutional
g.arantee of religious freedom. This ob
jection is now removed. The Supreme
Court of the United States has decided the
law to be within the legislative power of
Congress, and binding, as a rule of action,
for all who resided within the territories.
There is no longer any reason for, delay or
hesitation in its enforcement. It should be
firmly and effectively executed. If not
euflciently stringent in its provisions, it
sb~qJd be amended, and, in aid of the pur
1ics in view, I recommend that more com
prehensive and more searching methods
for preventing, as well as punishing this
crime be provided. If necessary to secure
obedience to the law, the enjoyment and
the exercise of the rights and privileges of
citizenship in the territories of the United.
States may be withheld or withdrawn from .
those who violate or oppose the enforce
ment of the law on this subject.
POPULAR RIG.HTS.
The elections of the past year, though
occupied only with state officers, has not
failed to elicit, in the political discussions
which attended them all over the country,
new and decisive evidence of the deep in
terest which the great body of citizens
take in the progress of the country towards
a more general and complete establish
ment, at whatever cost, of universal securi
ty and freedom in the exercise of the elec
tive franchise. While many topics of po
litical concern demand great attention from
our people both in the sphere of national
and state authority, I find no reason to
qualify the opinion I- expressed in my ast
annual message that no temporary or ad
ministrative interests of the Government,
however urgent or weighty, will ever dis
pel the zeal of our people in defense of the
primary rights of citizenship, and that the
power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices and all sectional and
state attachments, in the demand that all
over our wide territory the name and
character of a citizen of the United States
shall mean one and the same thing and
carry with them unchallenged security and
respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelli
gence and patriotism of all good citizens
of every part of the country, however
much they may be divided in opinions on
other political subjects, to unite in com
pelling obedience to existing laws aimed at
the protection of the right of suffrage. I
respectfully urge upon Congress to supply
any defects in these laws which experience
has shown, and which it is in its power to
remedy. I again invoke the co-operation
of the executive and legislative authorities
of the States in this great purpose. I am
fully convinced that if the public mind can
be set at rest on this paramount question
of popular rights, no serious object will
thwart or delay the complete pacification
of the country, or retard the general diffu-t
sion of prosperity.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
re Our relations with forfignl cointries have
4 continued peaceful.' With Great Britain
u theie are still unsettled questions growing
!t out of the local laws of the maritime pro
, vinoces and the action of provincial authori
't tits deemed to be in derogation of rights
e secured by the treaty to American fisher
men. The United States minister in Lon
a don has been instructed to present a de
r mand for $105,805.02, in view ofsthe dam
y ages received by American citizens at For
tune Bay on the 7th day of January, 1878.
The subject has been taken Into considers
y tion by the British government and an
d early reply is anticipated. Upon the comrn
pletion of the necessary preliminary exami
I nation, he subject of our participation in
e the provincial fisheries, as regulated by
e treaty, will at once be brought to the at
tention of the British government, with a
s view to an early and permanent settlement
of the whole question, which was only tem
4 porarily adjusted by the treaty or Wash
u ington. Efforts have been made to obtain
e the removal of restrictions found injurious
to the exportation of cattle to the United
Kingdom. Some correspondence has also
e occurred with regard to the rescue and
saving of life and property upon the lakes,
which has resulted in important modifica
tions of the previous regulations of the
Dominion government on the subject, in
the interest of humanity and commerce.
. THE INTER-OCANIC CANAaL.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is
again fully restored by the arrival of a min
ister from that country t the United States.
This is especially fortunate in view of the
fact that the question of an inter-oceanic
canal has recently assumed a new and im
portant aspect and is now under discussion
with the Central American countries
through whobe territory the canal by the
lNicaragua goute would have to pass. It is
trusted that enlightened statesmanship on
their part will see that the early prosecu
tion of such a work wil largely inure to the
benefit not only of their own litizees and
those of the United States, but of the com
merce of -the civilized world. It is not
doubted that should the work be underta
ken under the protective auspices of the
Uited States and upon satisfactory con
desions for the rlght of way and its seen
m nty by the Central American governments,
the capital for its completion would read
ily be furnished from this country and Eu.
rope, which might, failing such guaran
tees, prove inaecseible.

Mexico troeblbs and the recommendations
of the amretaqF of the Interior, the Presi
dent says:
I therefore earestly recommend the en
aetment of a law enabling the governmnent
to give Indiaas a title in fee inalienable for
25 years to the farm lands assigned to
them by allottment, and also repeat the
recommendation made in my first sannual
message that a law be passed admitting In
dians who can give satisfactory proof of
having by their own labor supported their
families for a number of years, and who
are willing to detach themselves from their
tribal relations, to the benefit of the home
stead eact, and to grant them patents con
taining the same provision of inalienabilty
for a certain period. The experiment of
sending a number of Indian children of
both sexes to the Hampton Normal and
Agricultural Institute in Virginia to re
ceive an elementary English education and
practical Instruction in farming and other
useful industries has led to results so prom
ising that it was thought expedient to turn
over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, Pa.,
to the Interior Department for the estab
lishment of an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has now 153 pupils, so
lected from various tribes, and is in full
operation. Arrangements are also made
for the education of a number of Indian
boys and girls belonging to tribes on the
Pacific Slope in a similar manner at Forest
Grove, in Oregon. These institutions com
mend themselves to the liberality of Con
gress and to the philanthropic munificence
of the American people.
The question whether a change in the
control of the Indian service should be
made was, in the Forty-Fifth Congress, re
ferred to a joint committee of both Houses
for inquiry and report. In p y last annual
message I expressed the hope that the de
cision of that question, then in prospect,
would arrest further agitation on this sub
ject, such agitation being apt to produce a
disturbing effect upon the service as well
as the Indians themselves.. Since
then, the' committe having reported,
the question has been decided by a vote in
the House of Representatives for reasons
here stated, and in view of the fact that
,further uncertainty on this point will be
calculated to obstruct other much-needed
legislation, to weaken the discipline of the
service, and to unsettle the salutary mess.
ure now in progress for the government
and improvement of the Indians, I respect
fully recommend that the decision arrived
at by Congress at its last session will be
permitted to stand.
TIMBER DEPREDATIONS.
Efforts made by the Department of the
Interior to arrest the depredations on the
timber lands of the United States have
been continued and have met with consid
erable success. A large number of cases of
trespass have been prosecuted is the Courts
of the United States, others have been set
tled, the trespassers offering to make pay
ment to the government for the value of
thetimbertaken by them The--proceeds
of these prosecutions and settlements
turned into the Treasury far exceed in
amount the sums appropriated by Congress
for this purpose. A more important re
sult, however, consists in the fact that the
destruction of our public forests by depre
dation, although such cases still ocur, has
been greatly reduced in extent, and it is
probable that if the present policy is vig
)rously prosecuted and sufficient provision
to that end is made by Congress, such
trespasses, at least those on a large scale,
can be entirely suppressed, except in the
Territories, where timber for the daily re
luirement of the population cannot, under
the present state of the law, be otherwise
)btained. I therefore earnestly invite the
attention of Congress to the ecoommenda
Hion made by the Secretary of the Interior,
hat a law be enacted enabling the govern
nent to sell timber from the public land
without conveying the fee where such land
a principally valuable for the timber there
in, such sales to be so regulated as to con
'orm to domestic wants 'and business re
lnirements. while at the same time guarding
Igainst a sweeping destruction of the for
sts. The enactment of such a law appears
o become a more pressing necessity every
lay.
Fiendish Attempt on the Czar's Life.
Moscow, Nov. 8.-After the arrival of
the Emperor last night, whilst the secopd
train containing the baggage was on its
way hither, an explosion occurred. One
luggage van was blown to pieces and seven
carriages were thrown off the rails, but
nobody was injured. The explosives which
destroyed the Imperial baggage train are
stated to have been on Monday evening
under the rails at a point over which the
Imperial train would pass just before enter
ing the Moscow railway station. The Czar
arrived safely, however, at 11 o'clock Mon
day night and the explosion occurred on
the passage of the baggage train half an
hour afterwards. The house where the
mine was exploded from has been diaoover
ed and search is being made for thb per
petrators of the outrage.
To day a deputation proceeded to the
Kremlin to congratulate His Majesty upon
his visit to Moscow. Previous to the Em
peror's arrival in the hall of the audience,
the Lord Marshal gave deputation news of
the catastrophe of the previous evening.
His hearers appeared for a moment thun
terstruck, but immediately afterwards,
broke into loud ohees rat the Emperor's
escape.
The Emperor appeared in St. George's
hall at noon and was plesented by the mu
nicipal authorities with bread and salt,
when he spoke as fdllows:
Gentlemen: I- am very glad to see you
again, remembering the loyal attachment
which you evinced on the occasion of the
sad event of April 14th. Similar assar
anes then reached .me from all parts.
You are already acquainted with the
events of yesterday. God preserved me as
well as those travelin; with me. Anxions
only for the welfare of Russia, I have
paced myself in the hands of Providence,
but sedition must be extirpated. I sppeal
therefore to you and all right minded peo

THE UTE INVESTIGA'TION.
A Special Graphic Account of a Dramatic
Scene. "Come on Macduff."
) DENVER, Col. Dec. 8.--pecials to the
Denver Tribunt from Los Pinos, represent
that Saturday was decidedly lively at that
pei$. After Jak -had -declinedtoinform
the commission what Indians were con
cerned in the massacre, all the Indians re.
tired to Ouray's house, where they had
wild dances and made brief speeches. Sac.
urday at 12 o'clock they returned to the
agency and took seats. Gen. Hatch ad
dressed the Indians. "To.day," he said,
"is your last chance; we will wait no
longer." The names of the guilty were
then read, and Hatch again put the ques.
tion, but received an evasive answer. The
third time Ouray replied without consult
ing the other Utes: "How do we know
that these Indians yon name were at White
river at the time of the massacre? Or,
even if they were there, we do not know
that they were concerned in it. These
women mentioned names which first came
to their lips, whether they knew them to
be the ones or not. We cannot depend on
what they say." "That is what we de
pend on," said Hatch. Adams then ad.
dressed the Indians, making a speech of
over an hour's duration saying, among
other things, that the commissioners did
not want to punish Colorow, Jack and
others that took part in the Thornbarg
fight, but the cowardly dogs who partici.
pated in the massacre of the unarmed men
at the agency, and cleailEby serai l " We
want those Utes and we will have them!"
The Indians held a consultatieon in a low
tone of voice among themselves, but did
not seem inclined to reply at all. Then
Hatch again rose and asked if the guilty
Indians were to be surrendered, saying
that he had made the last appeal, no one
moved or spoke for a few minutes, when
Colorow lighted a big pipe-" the pipe d(
peace." Each Indian present drew his
knife and laid it on his knees. The que*
tion of peace or war being the one pending,
Colorow passed the pipe to the next man
without smoking, and it went round. When
the circle was finished he jumped to his
feet, straightened up to his full height,
pulled his belt around until the knife sheath
was in front, pulled his knife out, threw it
with force on the floor, quivering and
wringing. Instantly every Indian present
dropped his hand to his belt and laid his
hand on his knife or his pistol. The whites
did the same, and the two parties stood
fronting and defying each other for some
mnoaatss; each waiting for the other 10o
make a forward move. There were sil
white men, while there were twenty-five
Indians in the room and fifteen soldiers in
the adjoining room.
Finally Ouray said: We can't deliver up
to you those Indians unless they are tried
in Washington; they mast not be tried in
Colorado. The Colorado people are all oar
enemies, and to give them up to be tried
in this State wotld be to surrender them
to be hanged. We wall bring those 12 men
here for you to see and those whom yoe
idcid, sary shall be taken to Washington
and the-Ptesident shall determine their
guilt or inuoteeae. Douglass will have to
go. We know he was in the White river
troublis, and you shall' decide who ele.
Upopt his,ooadltion apiwto other will we
surrender the guilty Ind'ans.
This was said with great arrogance snd
boldnese. Oaray said it would take abonu
W. iabu'u^ the men in. Hatch said
he would ,@ept the proposal so far as
bringing in the massacre men was coon
osa-eds .& f*lr t3,. Wash
ingtop he would have to telegraph for per
mislaon to Sehurs. Colorow and Jack
