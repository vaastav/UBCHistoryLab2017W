Talbot's Christmas
BY FRANCIS HART.

J AMES," said (Jerry Talbot sudden
ly, looking up from the letter he
had just received, "you needn't
mind about the rest. The dinner
will not come off, after all."
The decorated end of the big, sumptu
ous studio looked oddly distasteful to
Gerry Talbot since tlie reading of Miss
Wakefield's telegram, which had shat
tered his enthusiastic plans. He had in
vited lier —and her brother and his wife
—to a Christinas studio dinner which he
meant to make as festive as possible. Of
course, her rejection at the last hour
had been a gentle invention prepared to
• vert a greater disappointment, for he
had let her know unmistakably how it
w as with him, and he had been so hope
ful of success that he had selected a
ring for her Christmas gift—a little gold
en circlet set with a clear white soli
taire.
• ••••••
The streets were thronged with bust
ling Christmas shoppers, glad of heart,
with merry, expectant faces, and here
and there a wistful one, too, looking on
but not buying. Talbot noticed two lit
tie girls gazing wistfully into a confec
tioner's window.
"Yes, Min, l would. I'd do It fust
thing." said the taller of the two. "Oh
my, wouldn't it lie nice to lie rich an
invite all your friends to a big turkey
an' ice cream dinner!"
They were very poorly clad, thin
featured and ill-nourished, hut not
pleasant to look at. Talbot was con
scious, all at once, of an inexplicable
impulse to gratify the child's wish.
''So you would really like to
your friends a Christmas dinner!" said
he, smiling down at her astonished eyes.
"1 have a great mind to let you have
your wish."
"Oh, dear me, Min!" gasped Lon. "I
can't hardly believe it, can you? It
sounds just like a make-believe thing.
Won't Mis' Posey he s'prised! An'
Jonas an' Meg an' Tom. Oh, won't they
he jest too pleased!"
"How many shall you invite?" Talbot
asked gravely, taking out his notebook.
"Well, there's Aunt Katie nn' Uncle
Tim an' the baby. Mis' Posey, Jonas
Boggs, Meg an' Pat Fooley—Min, can
you think of anyone else?"
"Lame Betsy an' Moll."
"How many's that?" asked Lou.
"Twelve, counting us three."
"Don't you think it would be nice
to have a little present beside each
plate?" asked Talbot.
Both girls gasped, hut looked immense
ly pleased.
"Suppose you two go round with me
and pick out what you consider suitable
for each of your guests, because 1 should
not know what to select."
When Lou appeared at the studio on
the following morning she was a very
different looking girl, and any one would
have known by the pure joy of her
voice that some great and festive event
was at hand. Talbot had finished the
decorations which had been so harshly
interrupted by Miss Wakefield's mes
sage. and the result was extremely grat
ifying, especially after Lou's rapturous
acclamations.
At precisely 12 o'clock the bell rang
for the first time to announce the ar
rival of Aunt Katie and Tint and the
baby, all polished and prinked to the
verge of painfulness. Next eatne Mis
Posey, a little, faded, bowed, ancient
woman in rusty black, with long gold
loops in her wrinkled ears. Lame Betty
thumped in on her crutches, closely fol
lowed by Moll, in borrowed finery, of va
rious sizes. Meg brought blind Jonas,
and a merry little wraith of a man called
Tom Doom.
Talbot shook hands all around with
a "Merry Christmas!" after which they
all took their places at the beautiful
tab!«, the like of -which none of that j
humble party had ever looked upon. But ;
was a kindly madness that possessed ,
the host of that bountiful dinner, for
his stories were of the pleasantest and]
his watchful care was unflagging. Ilia '
guests rewarded his efforts by a sponta- j
neous enjoyment of all that was set be- j
fore them. It was good to see them
wait upon blind Jonas, who could not
help himself, and upon lame Betty,
whose crippled hands made difficult the
use of knife and fork.
Talbot rose to replenish a half-emptied
plate as the hall bell thrilled merrily.
There was a pause; then James' quiet,
well-trained voice said: "Yes, madam;
he is at dinner in the studio."
The door swung inward. Talbot knew
that he was not dreaming when she
came toward
hands and a
him with outstretched
ripple of explanation of
which he heard not one word. Indeed,
to him one isolated fact filled the world
—that she was smiling up at him with a
great promise in her eyes.
"A little friend of mine wanted to
give her friends a Christmas dinner, and
persuaded her to let me share it," he
explained jauntily. "It has been a great
treat to me."
Miss Wakefield read the whole truth
smiling.
for herself ns she looked into the good,
homely faces that reflected their host's
praises in every glance. She said noth
ing. hut her eyes told what Talbot would
have given nil he possessed to hear from
her lips. Then Mr. Wakefield and his
wife ventured in, and Talbot bethought
himself to ask if they had dined, which
they had not.
Lou and Talbot made room for three
plates here and there, and as there was
plenty of crullers and turkey and icet
cream, all went well to the very end of
the function, when the eleven originally
invited gzuests rose and made their
adieus with glad hearts and beaming
faces.
Miss Wakefield stood before the grate
while her brother and his wife examined
a row of pictures half hidden behind the
holly wreaths.
"I was so sorry to disappoint you yes
terday," she said, "hut poor Ted's tele
grnm was so urgent that we were afraid
he was worse, and hadn't the heart to
refuse him. When I discovered that we
could take an early train home I made
up my mind to run in and wish you a
Merry Christmas, anyway, and so we
came, you see."
Talbot thought of the ring. lie had
taken it from its hiding place. "For
long while I have wanted to ask you to
accept this—and what goes with it," he
said simply, holding the glittering bauble
toward her.
A red glow crept into her face.
She
made no audible answer, but when the
young couple at the other end of the
room sauntered toward them they were

Several accidents on Christmas eve

precaution to equip himself with asbes

of fires are recorded in the country each
year as a result of the inflammable na

Although the people of Norway hate
' decided to cut away from Sweden, they
j have little against King Oscar as a
j democratic Individual. He Is a tall,
erect, handsome old gentleman, court
ly and kind in manner, and is, perhaps,
the most approachable monarch. Sev
eral years ago, while aboard his yacht
"Drott," in northern waters, a party
on a passing steamer asked permis
sion to go aboard. It was courteously
granted.
King Oscar, In greeting his visitors,
said, "I fear I can not show r you such
a yacht as you have shown me tills
morning, but she is comfortable enough
for an old gentleman, and I have spent
twenty-two happy summers on her."
To a Journalist In the party the King
granted a few minutes' conversation.

Not long ago King Oscar was sitting
in the smoking room of a Wiesbaden

were discussing the questions of the

the revolutionary tendencies of the
time, etc. One of the party, expatiat
ing upon his pet theories with consid
erable vehemence, wouud up with the
remark, "The days of monarchies are
numbered."
King Oscar looked up and smiled.
"Evidently you don't agree with
me," resumed the speaker, "but can
you give me any good reasons for
Blinking otherwise?"
"Only one, I am the King of Swe

The name of this worthy—the med

of Khoresan. He lived and wrote in
the early period of the ninth century.
He Is "the father of modern arithme

"blunder" of the old Arabian goes

Dlsorder attending the presidential
campaign in Cuba has led thoughtful
people to a consideration of the power
of the United States to prevent a re
newal of the conditions of anarchy
that prevailed in the island during the
last years of Spanish rule. It is re
called that this country interfered in
the affairs of Cuba seven years ago
In order to put a stop to disorder and
misrule, which produced such condi
tions as brought Infectious disease to
our Southern ports and required the
constant vigilance of the navy to pre
vent those ports from being used as
the base for filibustering operations.
Cuba was occupied by American
troops, and Congress ordered that they
should not withdraw till a government
had been established under a constitu
tion which should give to the United
States the right to "intervene for the
maintenance of a government ade
quate for the protection of life, prop
erty and individual liberty." The Cu
ban constitution gives this right to the
United States, and it is still further
secured by a treaty duly ratified and
proclaimed. The certainty that this
government would intervene in case of
grafe and widespread disorder has
had a salutary effect on the Cuban
politicians trained in the methods of
the old revolutionists. If they succeed
in holding themselves in check during
the political canvass which closes with
the presidential election on Dec. 1 they
will have advanced far in the arts of
self-government. But. says the Youth's
Companion, if the United States is
compelled to Intervene to put an end to
the annoyances caused by a disorderly
neighbor, the Cubans will have only
themselves to blame for the outcome.
The President's forthcoming message
is a matter of concern to those Inter
ests that have reason to believe they
will be dealt with. Among those who
show greatest concern are the railroad
corporations of the country, because of
the President's known attitude toward
rates and rebates. Already these cor
porations have begun to assemble a
strong lobby. Among other interested
parties are the great trusts of ths
country whose concern extends in two
directions: First, toward the Presi
dent's enforcement of existing law;
and second, toward his possible recom
mendation of tariff revision. The pro
tected interests, alarmed by the stand
taken by the Massachusetts Republi
cans, fear that recommendations will
be made which will bring up the whole
tariff question. Then there are the in
surance companies, which fear som#
suggestion of Federal regulation and
control. Other interests may be cited
as being extremely anxious regarding
the President's forthcoming message,
but these are the more important
One reason why all such Interests are
more anxious than they would other
wise be is because President Roosevelt
has no further political ambitions.
This idea regarding the matters above
cited leads to the conclusion that
whatever recommendations are mad#
in his forthcoming message will look
radical legislation; that Is, radical
ln the estimation of those Interested.
When the Senators and Representa
tives return to Washington to attend
the approaching session of Congress
they will be astonished at the transfor
mation In the capitol. All the flues
have been equipped with exhaust fans
and other apparatus to prevent tha
smoke from the fireplaces going th#
wrong way. The entire upper portion
of the rotunda has been cleaned and
painted, and tue "steamboat paint" of
the sandstone walls has been complete
ly scraped away, revealing the beauti
ful red-brown color and stratification
of the walls. The rotunda now reminds
one of the Interior of a Greek temple.
The color of the walls, the graining oi
stratification of the stone harmonize
with the historical paintings above,
while ln place of the old gas jets there
have been Installed 1,900 incandescent
electric lights. Old and obsolete plumb
ing has been replaced with an up-to
date system and the whole building
has received a thorough washing and
scrubbing from top to bottom.
A singular state of things has come
about in Alabama. Senator Morgan's
term expires in 1907. He will be tuen
(if living) 83 years old. Senator Pet
tits' term expires in 1909. He will be
then (if living) nearly 88 years old.
Alabama Is on the quadrennial plan;
after next year's legislature there
won't he another until 1910. Next
year's legislature, therefore, will have
the electing of two United States Sen
ators. As far ns known General Mor
gan and General Pettus desire and ex
pect re-election. Suppose they are re
elected. At the end of their new terms
(if they live that long) General Mor
gan will be 89 and General Pettus 94.
Electricity Is to be put to a novel
test by the Department of Agricul
ture. A laboratory is being fitted ln
the division of pathology for the pur
pose of conducting experiments in the
growing of plants by the aid of an
electrical appliance. The experiments
are based on the theory that the
growth of vegetable matter, which
ceases at sundown, will continue
through the night if proper artificial
light is supplied to stimulate the nat
1 oral developing powers of the planta.
