TXM BEY.
Zanzibar, Doc, C After enduring
tho hardships of many years' roiidonco
in Cedtral Africa and the fatigues
and dangora of his journoy to tho sea, it
has heen tho fata of Emin Bey to recoivo
an injury which is likely to result in hia
death. Tho pasha is very near-sighted
and habitually wears glasses. Yester
day he attempted to go about his room
without them, and unconsciously walked
out of a window, falling somo distance
to tho ground.
Ho was immediately picked up and
conveyed into tho house, where it was
found that ho had sustained a fracture of
the skull, which all of the doctors at
Bagamoyo, except Stanley's own physi
cian pronounces fatal. Stanloy's doctor
shares tho opinion of his colleagues that
Emin is in a very critical condition but
expresses hope that ho may bo able to
save his life. As it is tho pasha cannot
under tho most favorable circumstances
bo removed from Bagamoyo for at least
ten days.
A later dispatch from Zanzibar says
that Emin misjudged tho height of a
balcony parapet, ovor-Silancod himself
and fell a distance of twenty feet. "When
found his right oyo was closed nnd blood
was issuing from his ears. His body is
terribly bruised.
Hon. Captnln Wissmann Met Stanley.
Berlin, Dec. C. Capt. Wissmann re
ports his meeting with Stanley as fol
lows: On Tuesday, Dec. 3, Stanley,
Emin Casati and Wissman mot at Atoni,
on the Kinghani river, and drank ono
another 8 health, and proposed and re
sponded to loyal toasts in bumpers of
champagne. Cant. Wissmann provided
horses for Stanley and Emin, and the
whole party made their triumphal entry
into Bagamoyo at 11 o'clock Wednesday
morning. Bagamoyo was profusely dec
orated with bunting, and green arches
and palms wore waving from every win
dow. Wissmann's force and tho German
man-of-war Speerber fired salutes, and
all tho vessels in tho roadstead woro
dressed with ilags. Capt. Wissmann en
tertained the party at luncheon, and tho
captain of tho Spoerber formally wel
comed Stanley. Then Emin, on behalf
of tho Emperor of Germany and a largo
number of Europeans arrived to greet
Stanley, and in tho evening there was a
grand banquet at which a perfect flood
of champagne was serveft
Tho German consul proposed a toast to
Queen Victoria, and Capt. Wissmann
toasted Stanley, alluding to him as his
master in African exploration, Stanley
made an eloquent speech in reply, thank
ing God that no had done his duty. Ho
referred with emotion to tho soldiors,
whose bones were bleaching in tho
forest, and remarked that his motto had
always been, "Onward." Ho also testified-to
tho divine influence which liad
guided him in his work.
Emin then toasted tho kaiser, and
Lieut. Stairs responded for Stanloy's
officers.
Lieut. Brockenburg proposed a toast
to Capt. Wissmann, wliich was respond
ed to with tremendous cheers, tho whole
company joining in tho song, "For Ho 's
a Jolly Good Fellow."
Stanley is expected to arrive in Zanzi
bar on Thursday on board tho German
warship Speerber. Einin's people aro on
board a British man-o f-war.
Father Schnyzo, of tho Gorman
African mission, who returned with
Stanley, declares that half-way measures
in Germany's dealings with the Arabs is
impossible. Germany must either con
sent to tho continuance of slavery or
maintain her position in Africa by forco
until the Arabs submit Tho complete
suppression of Blavo trading in Africa, ho
believes will require tho constant work
of centuries.
