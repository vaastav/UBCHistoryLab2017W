II1S OPPORTUNITY
Presidentelect Jlurrison is credited
with an ambition to eliminate sectional
issues from the pTJlUies of tho countjy
n nO to builtl u r a Republican party in
the W u tjW3 j
Tho achievement of such purcosea
WJ > a
would undoubtedly give him an historic
position second to that of no other mem
ber of his party except Abraham
Lincoln It must be obvious to
General Harrison that ho can
accomplish neither of these things if he
adopt the counsels of those radical mem
bers of his party who would place a bit
in the mouth of thejSouth and rein it in
as if it were an insurrectionary precinct
Were all that they have said of the South
true the fact still remains that coercion
never deflected the course of a free
proud and independent people They ill
deserve their political inheritance if they
could be frightened or intimidated by any
threats or measures that might be
directed at them no matter from wha
source they came Yet there is a way
an easy way by which General Harrison
may partially at least succeed in his de
signs
He can remove the impression that ex
ists in the South that the Republican par
ty entertains none but hostile intent to
wards this section and that it de
sires negro domination of the
South to gratify its revengeful
feelings Rightfully or wrongfully that
is a too general belief in the South So
long as that belief exists the Republican
party can never gain white following in
the South sufficient to make it formid
able
General Harrison can do much to allay
this feeling it is possible for him to re
move it entirely The administration
of Grover Cleveland was a long step
toward sectional reconciliation Benja
min Harrison can make his a longer step
As a Republican he can do what Grover
Cleveland as a Democrat could not do
The South needs men and money to as
sist in its development It needs manu
factures mills and railroads and it in
vites Northern men and Northern
capital to supply them ITere
there is a broader and more promising
field for investment than in any of the
foreign countries which Yankeo enter
priseand capital aro helping to develop
Every dollar of Northern money that
comes here and every addition to South
ern citizenship from the North
brings the two sections closer
together In truth all the advance that
has been mado toward the establish
ment of amicable relations between tho
two sections must be credited to the busi
ness interests or the country the poli
ticians will never declare peace until they
are forced to do so by the tradesmen the
capitalists and the investors who will
tire of constant agitation that endangers
their interests
If General narrisou should take coun
sel of this class if he should encourago
rather than retard Northern investments
in tho South if lie should seek to estab
lish such relations between the people of
the North and the South as would induco
them to mingle freely with each other
without thought of unwelcome reception
tho South will afford no cause for liim to
regret his course his administration will
be national and his fame universal
FORT KORTH AS A CATTLE MARKET
With a deep water harbor on the Texas
coast which would open tho markets of
the world to Texas cattle products with
facilities equal to thoso enjoyed on the
Atlantic seaboard Fort Worth by rea
son of its location in tho heart of tho
feeding belt of Texas and with railroad
connections with the Indian Territory on
the north Colorado and New Mexico on
tho northwest and the great ranges of
Western Texas and Mexico on the west
and southwest Fort Worth would bo
come a cattle center as great as Kansas
City is today This statement may
seem extravagant but a deep water har
bor on the Texas coast would be nearer
to all points iu the entire range country
from Montana to Texas than any port
on the Atlantic seaboard and Fort Worth
as a point for distribution sale and feed
ing would have u greater territory to
draw from than Kansas City has at this
time The day will certainly come when
Texas will secure a deep water harbor
and when Fort Worth will become one of
the great cattle centers of the United
States This tesult would forever break
up the beef monopoly of Chicago which
has had a depressing and injurious effect
on the cattle business of the entire coun
try The Chicago packers are men of
keen husineis foresight and they aro
supposed to use the money that they have
wrung from the cattle producers of the
West to still further strengthen the hold
they have on the meat business of tho
nation If the Chicago packers realized
that there was an immediate prospect of
Texas securing a deep water harbor on
our coast it is reasonable to believe
that they would be active in
efforts to oppose this measure because
its success would mean the destruction of
the monopoly they now have That they
are quiet on this subject while they are
up in arms usingall influence at their com
mand in opposition to state live stock in
spection laws which will prevent the ship
ment of dressed beef across state linesin
dicates that they have no immediate fear
of a deep water harbor being secured
and that they have a wholesome fear of
the success of the measures to reestablish
competitive markets which were in
augurated by the conference of cattle
men and butchers recently held in St
Louis While Fort Worth will not reach
the zenith as a cattle market until a deep
water harbor is established on the Texas
coast at the same time with facilities
such as will be supplied by the new
stock yards soon to be built here and
under natural conditions the beef trade
of Fort Worth would be sufficient to
double the present population of
our city Under these conditions
with proper stockyard facilities
cattle from the corn belt tributary to
Fort Worth and the great ranges of the
West buyers will always be found in the
stockyards who would come herofrom
New Orleans Shreveport Little Rock
> >
Memphis Birmingham Ala and other
points in the South as well as from the
North As long however as the markets
of the towns and Cities of the South and of
tho sections of country naturally tributary
to Fort Worth aro supplied with icebox
meat by the Chicago packers Fort Worth
will only be a feeding station for the cat
tle to pass through 6h their way to the
toll gates of tho Big 4 of Chicago While
it is well for the citizens of Fort Worth to
build stockyards here at the same time
in order to make investments in stock
yards at Fort Worth profitable to
the greatest possible extent and
in order to insure beyond all
question Fort Worths position as a great
cattle market tho influence of our citi
zens as well as of tho cattlemen of Tex
as should be exerted to successfully car
ry out the measures inaugurated by the
Association of Beef Producers andButeh
ers of which Colonel C C Slaughter of
Dallas is president The success of tlieso
measures will restore natural conditions
of trade reestablish competitive cattle
markets and determine prices for both
producers and consumers based on the
laws of supply and demand

Cincinnati Enquirer The press is
widely discussing a curious question of
presidential succession to wit If after
being chosen president and vicepresi

rison and Morton should die before the
4th of March would Mr Bayard
through his positiou as secretary of state
become presidont on the expiration of
Clevelands term Tho Philadelphia
Press says no The New York Herald
says yes The bulk of opinion appears
to be with the former The purpose
of the present succession law the
reason of its being was to vest
the succession with the same party that
should have elected the president and
vicepresident So the cabinet was sub
stituted for the president pro tern of the
senate and the1 speaker of the house It
would bo overriding the spirit of that law
to have a Democratic successer to it Re
publican president The fact is and was
well understood at the time that the law
did not make provision for such accidental
vacancies as those suggested The de
fect should be speedily repaired
New York Times Whatever may be
tho exceptions to bo taken to tho form of
sopio parts of the presidents message it
will be just as well for senators of the
majority not to be too conspicuous in call
iugattontion to them Tho very grave
evils in our legislation to which the pres
ident has directed attention owe tiieir
existence almost wholly to the conduct of
thp Republican party It is that1 party
that has levied taxes on the materials of
manufacture aud tho necessaries of
life with the avowed purpose of enrich
ing monopolies that are already too
wealthy for the public good It is that
pat ty that has used a part of the wealth
thus conferred iu tho most extensivo and
most shameless corruption of the suffrage
that this country has ever known It is
that party that profeses to care for the
workingmen by increasing at their ex
pense tho profits of a small band of
employers who pockets tho profits
and import foroign labor to keep
down wages It is that party that
taxes home industry by closing the mar
kets of the world to its products and in
creases the cost of living by the same
measures that reduce the demand and
compensation for labor These things
done by a combination of privileged cap
italists it may be a mistake to call
communism but tho correct name
would be quite as severe and just as of
