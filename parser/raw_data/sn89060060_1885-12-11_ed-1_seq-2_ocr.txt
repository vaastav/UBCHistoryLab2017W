PORT TOBACCO:
Friday Moraine December 11, 1885.
For Speaker of the next House of Delegates:
Hon. Andrew G-. Chaptnan,
—op
en ARLES COUNTY.
The President's .Message.
The message sent to Congress Tuesday
by President Cleveland is somewhat of a
novelty, in that it is the first document of
the kind emanating from a Democratic
executive since the year 1860. It is quite
a full and comprehensive paper, covering
every important topic of public interest
which now engages the attention of ou r
government. It is strong and forcible in
its arguments and presentation of points,
and in this respect, as well as in literary
execution, will rank well with any previ
ous document* of its character.
The affairs of the government are pre
sented from a Democratic standpoint, and
all the views advanced by the President
are in conformity with the platform of
principles adopted by the Democratic con
vention that nominated Mr. Cleveland.
After referring with feeling to the un
timely decease of the late Vice-President
Hendricks, the President alludes with sat
isfaction to the peaceful character of our
present international relations. Our rela
tions with Great Britain and Mexico are
referred to as especially amicable and
pleasant.
On the question of the tariff, the mes
sage conforms with the Democratic plat
form. While pointing to the 870.000,000
excess of revenue in the last fiscal year a*
imperatively demanding a marked reduc
tion in customs duties, the President coun
sels that in making these reductions, due
regard should be had to industries built
up by protection and to the interests of
American labor, in so far ns they are con
cerned in the tariff. The President sensi
b’y remarks that the question of free trade
is not involved and that there is not now
any necessity for a discussion of the wis
dom or expediency of a protective system.
It is observable that the message very dis
tinctly repudiate* Mr. Randal’s tariff idea
embodied in the Pennsylvania platform
to make the chief reductions in the inter
nal revenue on whiskey and tobacco. It
counsels that the chief reductions shou’d
be made upon the imported necessaries of
life, thereby cheapening tbe cost of living
and lessening tbe burdens of the poor.
The silver problem is discussed at some
length, and with great clearness. The
right of Congress to purchase si ver to
coin into dollars is questioned; but grant
ing the right, the necessity of making
further purchases to add to the 215.749,-
431 silver debars in existence to-day is as
sumed to be negatived by the fact that up
to the present time but 50,000,000 of sil
ver dollars have been gotten into circula
tion, leaving over 165,000,000 of them in
the custody of the government, ‘-Every
jnontU” says the President, putting the
the Bland act in "a strong
light, “‘two millions of gold in the public
treasury are paid out for two millions or
more of silver dollars, to be added to the
idle mass already sccumu'ated.’* From
many points of view the continued coin
age of tbe standard dollar is shown to be
not only useless, but inexpedient and
dangerous. The President’s very able
discussion of the matter is closed with a
a recommendation that “the compu’sory
coinage of silver dollars,” directed by the
act of February, 1878, be suspended.
Some criticisms are made upon the coast
and geoletic survey and it is recommend
ed that its work be limited by statute to
definite objects and that it be placed un
der the supervision of the Navy Depart
ment. The large number of trials by
courts martial which have taken place in
the array, seem to the President to indi
cate a loose sys'em of discipline and mor
n's and not a very high standard of honor
iu the military service. Of the route o!
inter-oceanic communication thus far dis
cussed the President prefers the Tehaun
tepec, but whatever route may be opened
be thinks it should be subjected to the
common use of mankind.
The President strong’y endorses Secre
tary Whitney’s recommendations in res
pect to the thorough reorganization of the
navy and urges Congress to take effective
steps to that end. He says that ‘ war ves
sels, though new, are use'ess unless they
combine all that the ingenuity of man has
up to this day brought forth relating to
their construction.” The pension rolls are
declared to be in need of cleansing, being
encumbered with hundreds of thousands
of names placed on them by fraud. The
civil-service law receive* the commenda
tion at the hands of the President that his
known devotion to its principle* had led
the public to expect. “Experience in its
administration will,” be says, “probably
suggest amendment of the methods of i's
execution, but I venture to hope that we
shall never again be remitted to the sys
tem which distributes pub'ic positions
purely as rewards for partisan service.”
The message concludes with a recom
mendation that the Presidential succes
sion be more judicious'y and effectively
regulated.
Although the Maryland Legislature will
not meet until January, already specula
tion is rife and canvassing active for posts
of honor in the coming body. Probabil
ities point to Gen. Joseph B. Seth, of Tal
hot, as the Speaker of the House of Dele
gates, although General Andrew G. Chap
man of Charles’county, if he concludes to
make a contest, will have many friends.—
In the Senate, the Contes' will probably
be between Senator Warfield of Howard
county and Senator Hayes of Baltimore
city, though Senator Peter of Montgomery
and Senator Bowlus of Frederick may each
have a support that may prove dangerous
in certain contingencies. In respect to
minor offices, the situation in the House
at present is remarkab’e. Mr. Moore, tbe
chief clerk, died a few months ago, and
Dr. Cole, the reading clerk, has been elect
ed to Congress, new material will have to
be utilized for the places they recent’y so
ably filled, and there is nothing publicly
known to indicate who will be called to
the work. The Senate will probably find
its old officers on band ready to respond
to the call if extended.— Cecil Democrat, j
The Constitutional Convention.
I j
| The demands of the people of the State for a J
1 Constitutional Convention will certainly he
carried out by the next Legislature. In ail;
probability the vote on the question of the
'• convention will take place in .May, 1886, and
- and at the same election delegates to the con-1
; vention will be voted For. The convention
will assemble most likely in the fall of 1886
The judiciary will receive careful consideration
at the hands of the convention. Many sow
features have already been discussed. The
present judiciary system, it is thought, will he
very mate hilly altered. The n-w convention
will he disposed to order a new .-lection for
county officers, which fact will not he the most
pleasing intelligence to the newly "elected
j county officials, it would seem that we are
never to escape the worry and excitement of
4 elections. Freiltri k Citizen.
The Citizen, in common with several of
c our State contemporaries, se- ins to be un
e der a misapprehension with regard to the
- powers of the Genera! Ass- ml ly in regard
• to a constitutional convention. Nearly all
r ,
the comments we have see n upon 'lie matter
1 seem to regard it as discretionary with the
• Assembly whether or not to cal! a consti
1 tutional convention, and some of our cmf
temporaries are suggesting that an em.-n.l
ment, reorganizing the judiciary system
should be proposed insti .u! of calling a
I . *
cons'itutional convention.
1 The fact of the matter is, h nvever, that
the General Assembv has no discretion at
all in the premises; as will be seen by sec
tion 2 of Art. 14 of the present constitu
"jtion which reads as follows:
t ' Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the General
. Assembly to provide by L-iw for I.king. at the
general election to he held in the ye.r eighteen
r I hundred and eighty-seven, and every twenty
- years thereafter, the sense of the People in re
? pard to calling a Convention for altering Hii-
Constitution; and it a tuaj Hit of voters it
• such e'cction or elections shall va-e for a Con
vention, the General Assembly, at i's nex- s*-s
sion, shall provide by Law for the .isaml>liag
of such Convention, and for the ele -li.-n o!
- Delegates thereto. Each County, and L-gi,-
1 lative District of the city of Baltimore. sh.U
have in such Convention, a number of Dele
8 galesequ.al to its representation in both Ib.-.i-es
- at the time at which the Convention is calk'd.
But anv Constitution, or change, or amend
ment of the existing Constitution, win h m \
? be adopted by such Convention, sha 1 b* uh-
I milted to the voters *>f this Slate, and shal
. have no etfect unless the same shall bar be-n
adopted by a tit.j-rily of the vole s v. ting
- thereon.
It will thus be seen that the next Gen
“ eral Assembly is specifically required by
r the present constitution to provide by law
- for the taking of the sense of the people
. at tlia gentrs! election in 1 "-7 ia regard
- to calling a constitutional convention, tod
i that it will be its constitutional duty to
i do so; no ds retion being left in ‘he pre*
mises. It wi iaso be seen that no further
action in the matter can be taken in t 1 e
1 year 1886, and that no electi >n of delegates
can take place until some time in the year
’ l s -S. The approaching I .egisla' urc w ill
merely provide by 1 .w f r the t king of
tiie sense of the people at lie g-ner*’ elec
tion ia 1 s B7, and if it be Cen dtcid-- Iby
the people to hive a constitutional con
vention, it will become th* dutv >f the
Legislature of 1883 to provide f-r the elec
tion of delegates and the holding of a con
vention, which will probably tike place
sometime in the ve.ar
appear that the present constitu ion will
probably c tutinue iu opera ion at least
until the year 1889.
The tenor of all the comments wo have
seen upon the question seems to indicate
a general dissatisfaction throughout the
S’.ve with the present jid < i try srs'em
and there seems t i Ic a genera! concur
rence in the opinion that the ] ns-nt t n
stitution should be so fir rein .deled ■ ' •
effect a complet* reorganization of toe 1 t
dietary, so as to have the < ourt > f Appeals
and tbe county courts entire y separate
and distinct tribunals. Further than this,
however, there does not seem to be any
serious dissatisfic vm with the pr.s'nt
constitution.
If this be the extent to which it is de
sirable to alter the present constit ;!i a. it
may fairly be questioned whether it will
be necessary or justifyable to run the Mite
to the expense of s cons'itutional conven
tion for thi* single purpos*. And i-i this
connection the question arises would it
no! be wise f-.r the coming Legislature to
submit an amendment to the people, to be
voted on at the next election, providing
for the reorganization of the judiciary
system ? Such an amendment wan'd pro
bably be prompt y ad >pted and can J go
into operation by the beginning of the
year 1887. Then, assuming that tiie ju li
> ciary system is the chief source of dissat
isfaction with the pnsent constitution, it
is probable that, with his objectionab'c
. feature already lopped -fT by amendment)
: the people wou’d decide at the election in
i 1887 not to have any cons'itutinna! con
vention, and that large expense would bc
thus saved to the State This matter is
j worthy of the seriou: cocsidcrati n of the
, next Legis'ature.
A prominent physician of Bridgep rt.
’ 111., who was Mr. Hendricks’ friend and
attendant for a longer period than any
other physician, says that Mr. Hendrick*
’ did not die of heart paralysis. Several
t years ago Mr. Hendricks was stricken with
I paralysis, from which he never fu ly re
covered, and as is usual in cases of partial
paralysis, a clot formed that eventually
reached the brain and caused death.
