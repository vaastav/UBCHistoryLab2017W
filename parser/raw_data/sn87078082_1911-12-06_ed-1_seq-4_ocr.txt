AVEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1011.
President Taft's message to Congress will bo found in to-day's Citizen.
It contains many good points. Read It.
What is your attitude toward dividing Honesdale into election wards?
Tho columns of The Citizen are open for criticism.
'In tho opinion of State Health Commissioner Dixon the shopper's
judgment s clearer in the morning and better able to make decisions In
volving matters of taste and economy.
There is no reason why able-bodied men should not shovel or hire
their sidewalks shoveled after a fall of snow. We know of instances where
the snow lies unmolested, save for being trod upon, from tho time it falls
until nature removes It. This is a violation of the borough ordinance and
the violator should be fined.
AS TO AMERICAN POTASH,
Farmers in this country will be much Interested In the report that
comes from Washington to the effect that rich potash deposits, said to be
great enough to supply the needs of the United States, havo been discover
ed in the West by scientists of the Department of Agriculture. This dis
covery will mean a saving of $12,000,000 a year to this country, as horeto
1 fore the United States has been spending about that sum annually to buy
its potash from Germany.
GLOBE YARN STOCK SELLING FAST.
Tho Greater Honesdale Board of Trade Is elated over the sale of stock
of the Globe Yarn company, an advertisement of which appeared In last
Friday's Citizen. Tho Board announced that thirteen thousand shares of
slock, par value $10, non-assessable, were for sale. Four hundred and
fifty shares have been disposed of, leaving twelve thousand, five hundred
and fifty shares to be sold. Many havo signified their willingness to take
stock and we hope that soon we will be able to announce that all the
shares will have been sold.
The business is already established and Is past Its experimental stage.
It is, however, "up to the people." The Board of Trade has accomplished
Its part it now remains with the townsfolk and Wayne counteans to do
their share. This can be done by subscribing for tho stock. A share of
stock ought to bo taken by everybody In Honesdale
Do not delay In your subscriptions. If the sale continues as rapidly
as it commenced it will not be on the market many days. Take advantage
of your opportunity.
ACTION OF McNAMARAS UNPRECEDENTED.
The confession of the McNamara brothers is unprecedented. James
B. McNamara pleaded guilty to the murder in tho first degree, Friday, and
his brother, John J. McNamara, secretary of the International Association
of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers also entered a plea of guilty to hav
ing dynamited the Llwellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles on Christmas Day,
1910.
J am os B. McNamara's confession clears up absolutely the tragedy of
tho explosion and fire which wrecked the plant of the Los Angeles Times
and caused tho death of twenty-ono persons. 'For nineteen of these deaths
tho McNamara brothers were Indicted and J. B. McNamara was on trial
specifically for th6 murder of Charles J. Haggerty, whose ibody was found
nearer than that of any other to the spot where the dynamite was suppos
ed to have been placed.
The example set by the McNamaras is disgraceful. They were honored
by and looked upon as men of reason and Intelligence, but have since fall
en to the lowest possible depths much to the chagrin of Union leaders.
The action of the McNamara brothers has left a blot upon the pages of
unionism that will take a long time to erase.
How To Prepare Iloltdny Pncknges
to Send TliroiiKli Malls.
Already Christmas packages for
foreign lands are being received at
tho Honesdale postofllco. When
sondlng articles through tho mail a
few simple rules should bo remem
bered. Here they are:
First 'Wrap your article In paper
strong enough to admit of several
handlings with ink in tho lower
right 'hand corner, or if ink is not
available, use a good pencil and
write plainly. Put your name and
address In the upper left hand corner
so your package may be returned if
tho address Is rendered Illegible.
Do not put writing in with other
matter unless you wish to pay letter
postage. You are permitted to use
"Merry Christmas," and "Happy
New Year" but no communications
of any sort.
When articles are to be registered
you must have your name and ad
dress, (street number will not suf
fice) and the name, street number
or rural number, town and state of
the person to whom you wish to send
tho register. Take your package to
tho stamp window, have it weighed,
affix the stamps and always wait for
your receipts from tho registry clerk.
If you wish a return receipt you must
endorse it fee in any case is 10
cents in addition to the regular post
age which Is as follows:
First class All written matter
with ink or typewriter, 2 cents for
each ounce or fraction.
Second class Includes all news
papers, periodicals and magazines, 1
cent for each four ounces or frac
tion.
Third class Printed matter of all
kinds books, pamphlets and pict
ures i cent for each ounce or frac
tion. The government has affixed a pen
alty of ?10 for1 each offense where
articles of a higher class are in
cluded with those of lower class and
an attempt made to send them
through tho mails at the lower rate.
A word about post cards may give
you the reason why your last card
did not reach your friend. Cards
with tinsel or like substance must
be enclosed in an envelope and se
curely sealed and 2 cent postage
affixed, otherwise they are sent to
the dead letter office. On the ad-
drss side you are permitted to use
one-half the space and no more, for
correspondence. If this rule Is not
observed the card Is held for post
age, which Is 2 cents.
When using the transparent en
velopes alllx the stamp to the envoi
ope and not to the enclosed card.
Every week post cards as well as
other articles addressed to children
aro sent to the dead letter office be
cause no street or rural route or
parents' name is given. The best
plan in sending mall to children is
to address it in care of the parents
or persons with whom they aro staying.
COSTUMES AND SCENERY.
DESERVES SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY.
The Woman's Auxiliary to the Wayne County Hospital Association de
serves tho united support of the community in its effort to raise the de
sired funds for a hospital. It not only needs the support, but should be
given tho hearty co-operation of the public. Tho movoment Is a com
mendable one and the officers are to be congratulated for the zealous man
ner in which they are conducting tho campaign for raising money. To
those in authority we would suggest to keep persistently and everlastingly
at It. Exemplify to tho residents of Honesdale and Wayno county that
sufficient money can bo raised for a hospital. 'By this exemplification you
will olearly demonstrate that great character force stick-to-lt-ivo-ness
which has never failed if given sufficient latitude.
Wo admit that the 'ladles have undertaken a grand project, but under
their supervision wo feel that It will be a success. Women have accom
plished great things In tho annuals of history. The Ladles' Improvement
association is an illustration of what can be done In our own community
by concentrated effort. It Is an example of all work together for the im
provement and betterment of conditions. Many of the members of the
Hospital Auxiliary are associated with tho Improvement Association.
That the hospital movement will be a success is evinced by this fact. Tho
Citizen is In favor of the hospital agitation and will do all in Its power to
encourage and help those prominently Identified In attaining the necessary
capital that a hospital may bo built In Honesdale. Success to the project.
MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE.
At this time of the year our thoughts are diverted from the usual
business cares to the Joys and pleasures of the holiday season and how we
may best enjoy ourselves. We have experienced Thanksgiving's blessings
and now look forward to Christmas. In our happiness, however, we do
not want to forget those who are less fortunate than ourselves. All
homes, for one reason or another, will not be as happy this year as thoy
were upon former occasions, consequently it remains with us to do our
part, humblo though It may be, to help make some of tho less favored ones
happy.
It is true that there are a number of people living 1n Honesdale and
vicinity who aro in dire need of help. Old age has overtaken them and
their physical conditions are impaired. Rheumatism, palsy and other
maladies have fastened their grip upon them and incapacitated them for
work. While tears were in their eyes our hearts went out in profound
sympathy for them as they recently related their afflictions to us.
Somo might say this is an Inopportune time, now that Christmas Is
so near. Not so. The giver of charity would be blest and his blessing
could bo used to better advantage now. The churches, Individuals and
other organizations are doing much for charity, hut there Is no special so
ciety devoted exclusively to that kind of work. To this end we claim
Jionosuaio needs an organization of this character. An Associated Chari
ties, organized for this specific purpose, is necessary.
We have in mind tho heads of two families, who by unfortunate cir
cumstances aro unable to work and we take this means of presenting their
worthy and pitiable conditions before the public. We speak In words of
highest praise for them and hopo that our readers will substantial the
evidence by liberally remembering within the next two weeks these acred
people. Let us lay aside a little of our Christmas money and establish a
iuna ior sweet unaruys sane, rememDering mat it is more blessed to
give than to receive." Wo will be happier and richer on Christmas morn
for our donation. Money orders or checks may be made payable toCItlzen
Publishing Company, Honesdale, Pa. Tho Citizen will act as trustee to re
ceive and present the offerings to the needy families.' Money in any de
nomination will be acceptable. Contributions may also be loft at 953 Main
street. All monies received will bo presented to the cause for which it is
solicited. Tne names or the contributors will be printed In The Citizen
ana an account snowing tne disposition of the funds will bo made.
