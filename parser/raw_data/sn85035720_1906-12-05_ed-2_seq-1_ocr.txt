$1,300 by Water Bflard.
DEDUCT FOR CEMENT BOTTOM.,
The Climax Company Sent a Bill for
$1,(100 Recently, Hut Tliat Did Not

?by the Company An Expected.
The difficulty between the Wale.'
Hoard and the Climax Construction i
Company has been settled, and the I
latter has been given a pdyment of j
about $1,300.
As told in the NEWS, the Climax
Company's representative was pres
ent at a recent meeting: of the Water
Board and claimed that $1,600 was
due them for building the suction
well at Tiunyon* The board left the j
matter in the hands of Engineer Ma- !
son, and he was authorized to effect
a settlement. When the well was
completed by the Climax Company,
Engineer Mason found that the bot
tom was not strong enough, so he
communicated with the concern and
they said he could have the change
made, and charge it to their account.
Mr. Mason did so at a cost of about
$300. When the Climax Company's
representative asked for the money
due them, the bill for the new co
ntent bottom in the well was not con
sidered, but the difficulty is now set
tled, .and the money has beeijj-puld.

?Assembly Caucus.
SENATOR ELECT SILZER THERE
JERSEY CITY, Dec-. 5.?Assem
blyman-elect Henry J. Earle, of Pas
saic, was the only democratic mem
ber of next year's lower house who |
did not attend the democratic assem- 1
bly caucus, which was held last night
at the headquarters of the Robert
Davis Association, in Mercer street,
Jersey City. He was confined to his
home by illness. Solid delegations
were present as follows: Hudson, 12:
Essex, 11; Hunterdon, 1; Sussex, t: j
Warren, 1, and Passaic was repre- ;
sented by four of its five men.
The caucus was preceded by a din
ner, which began at nine o'clock. Be
sides the thirty assemblymen-elect
who enjoyed the good things were
State Senator James F. Minturn, of
Hudson, who presided ^ Senators John
Hinchliffe, of Passaic: Jacob C. Price,
of Sussex; Johnston Cornish, of War
ren, and George S.' Silzer, of Middle

the democratic leader of Hudson, was
not in evidence.
Senator Minturn made a speech at
the dinner in which he outlined the j
legislation which he believed the i
democrats in the house and senate 1
should work for with a will. He said I
among other things:
"We must, bring about equality of I
taxation by assessing corporation pro
perty and individual property by the '
same method and at the same rate.
We must destroy the money power in
elections by passing a corrupt prac
tice act which will jail the briber and
the bribed."

the appointment of a commission to i
regulate steam railroads and trolley
seryice in the interests of the people; i
a bill for the appointment of a com
mission to regulate the price and
quality of light and gas; a bill to deal
with mondpolies and corporations or
ganized under the laws of New Jer
sey and providing that the attorney
general snould be directed to forfeit
their charters by quo warranto pro
ceedings or' by injunctions in case j
they violate their conditions. He also
urged a measure for the .election of*
United States senators by a direct
vote of the people.
At the conclusion of the dinner the j
guests left and the thirty assembly- |
men went into caucus.

\\ ASHING TON, Dec. 5:?In his]

le" 'snored the immigration ques-i
lion completely, and the advocates I
the restriction of immigration i
hardly know how to construe tt. This
followed by the appointment of Oscar
S. Strauss to be secretary of com-1

pression that even if the present re-1

enforcement might be nullified large-j
ly by the liberal construction that
would be put upon It by Mr. Strauss.
As a Hebrew and a philanthropist he
would be disposed to admit the op
pressed from all countries without
any discrimination, It is thought.
Representative Eoudenslager, when
asked his opinion of the message of

WANT ANOTHER
$25,OIM PUMP
Water Board in Committer Meet
ing Last Night Discussed Mat
ter-Put it Up to Aldermen.
NEEDEO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.
New 8,000,000 Gallon Pump Is Now
Doing All the Work, and If It
Should Break Down the Old I*unips
at Runyon Could Not Draw Water
From the Storage Wells?Increase
in Consumption Demand Facilities.
?
At the meeting of the water board
tonight it Is understood that Engineer
Mason and Superintendent Burns will
recommend that a new 10,000,000
gallon pump be purchased for the
pumping station at Runyon. At the
committee meeting of the board last
night the pump question was thor
oughly discussed and It was decided
to take action in the malter at once.
The reason for the installation of the
pump, as learned from good author
ity, is in case of the present 8,000,000
I gallon pump should break down the
I city would practically experience a
water famine, as the two small pumps
! at Runyon cannot be used on the
ground storago system, and in that
! event the little water that coulcb he
: pumped to this city would be artesian
| well and pond water. If the board
: officially receives the recommenda
i tions, they will probably submit them
| to the council at once for considera
tion.
Installing a new pump means a
cost of about $25,000, but those who
know say that the pump is needed as
an auxiliary in case the 8,000,000
gallon Worthlngton pump now in use
should break down.
The pumping records show that
this city is now consuming an aver
age of 5,300,000 galipns daily, and
at this rate, in a few years, the pump
now in use at the pumping station
would be insufficient to supply the de
mand, as the increase yearly is about
1,100,000 gallons a day.
Wheit the 8,000,000 Worthlngton
pump was installed at Runyon last
year at a cost of about $22,000, it
was thought that It was largo enough,
but the commissioners had decided
that a large pump will be needed in
the near future and by purchasing
one now to act as an auxiliary, when
the daily consumption increases both
pumps could be run in unison.
Engineer Mason and the commis
sioners refused to discuss the pump
question when seen by a NEWS re
porter today, hut that the question
will be brought up at tonight's meet
ing is regarded as authentic.

President Main Says That Members

Whether Then- Is Much Business

I Likens the Failure to Have Quorum
Present to Chamber of Commerce.
The Board of Health did not hold

The board has held no meeting

likely to take place until the Janu

a special meeting was called, and
j again no quorum was present. Last

President Main said last night that
the Health Board is dying as fast as

the meetings now are not of a great

1 "But that is no reason," said the
