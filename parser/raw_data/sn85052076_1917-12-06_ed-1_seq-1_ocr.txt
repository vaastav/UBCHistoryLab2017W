To Beat the Germans
We are finding that war is a serious matter.
The Germans are not goirig to be beaten by shout
ing or the waving of flags.
We have reason to hate the Germans for their false
hood, treachery, and cruelty, but in spite of these things
they' will win the war unless we can match them in in
dustry, frugality, self-denial and careful head work.
Like a wild animal the German nation is thoroughly
set upon doinglis damage. Germany is fighting with all
its might while the Allies are. not fighting as yet with
more than one hand.
But Germany is not like a wild animal when itconjes
to head work. They think and plan, and itwill take think
ing and planning to beat them.
We are sending our young men and many of them
will never come back. If we want to save as many lives
as we can it is time for us to make up our minds to do
everything possible to win this war.
Are we willing to go without sugar and fine clothes?
Are we willing to be saving of our coal and breadcrumbs?
Are we willing to have the United States unite so closely
with the ether nations as to put all the armies under one
commander ? Are we willing as Christian people in differ
ent churches to come closer together, stop fighting and
. act li e i)rjths?is?
v And are we w illing to stop cheating the Government,
and to put down strikes and lock-outs, and suppress
the greed and cheating that is rampant in many lines ?
May we not reverently say that God may intend this
war as a school in w hich w e shall be taught some virtues ?

Hurricane of Fire.
London, Dec. 3.--A German descrip
tion of a British bombardment, smoke
screen, attacks with gas, flame-throwers
and tanks, followed by a charge
of Canadians and Scots, published by
the Berlin Post, is entitled "In the
Flanders Hell."
"For weeks, day and night," says the
writer, "the British kept our position
under Are. Ever fiercer burned the
glowing stream that poured crackling
down upon us. Every day this fire
grew hotter. Our artillery replied
powerfully. The army communique
spoke of a concentration of enemy ar
tillery fire on Individual sectors. Even
we cannot describe what that means.
The history of the world has never
seen anything more awful. All cali
bers were brought Into action, and a
crater of unprecedented extent opened
beside the others, was excavated
afresh, swallowed up the old ones,
spread out beyond the lime trees and
threw up the hinterland. Nothing re
mained Intact of all that nlghta of
hard labor under the enemy's fire had
easattd.
Smoke Shells Hide All.
"The destroying fire did Ita work
with depressing thoroughness, seeming
to extinguish all life, and now came
the turn of the smoke shells. Thick
smoke lay before our eyes, so that we
could see nothing, ami yet ever further
forward must we push our death-defying
posts. A real fug Is mere patch
work compared with this artificial fog
which the British send out In order to
veil their dispositions.
"When this appeared Inadequate the
enemy employed gus, and the evil
mists came rolling toward our lines
and' passed over them ; only our gas
masks prevented every living thing
from being destroyed. The gas had a
singular effect on our weapons; all
Iron was covered with thick rust.
"The British now Judged that they
had done enough preparatory work,
for suddenly drumfire started with the
most terrifying effect. Shells of the
heaviest caliber thundered across with
mines, machine gun volleys and hand
grenades all uniting in a blood-curdling,
hellish pandemonium such as
even a Dante would never be able to
describe.
Hurricane of Fire Qomes.
"German nerves held out with he
utmost resolution, constantly awaiting
the moment when the hurricane of fire
would break loose. And the storm
came. In the neighboring sector flume
throwers were turned on. Against this
murderous engine, no measures avail.
There Is nothing for It but to get back
Into the rearward positions.
"And Jhen the enemy was on us.
Tank after tank loomed forward. These
monsters appeared Invincible, and If
one of them was hit by a heavy shell
the guns and machine guns Inside were
kept going unremittingly, until finally
their Iron hall reached our lines. And
behind the tanks came Scots and Cana
dians. We see nothing but endless
rows oP enemies,
"At last our reserves deliver a
counter-attack. Murder breaks ont
afresh. The field of dead becomes once
mo.-e a battle ground."
Germans Try Turning Movement
British Headquarters In France,
Dee. 8. In their operations In tbo
Cambrifl region the Germans began a
turning movement, but the British
were able to pull back most of their
troops and guns at the first attack and
save them from being caught. The
British blew up a certain number of
guns. As far as could be ascertained,
no British guns were captured by the
Germans. The German casualties wero
exceedingly large. Tbe British prob
ably lost a considerable number of
men.

In spite of the heavy attacks of

the Germans in all of the important
positions. The loss of life on both
sides lias been very heavy.
The Italians continue to hold
their position on the Piave River '
and are now receiving aid from the
Allies. Confidence is returning and
fear of a general overrunning of
Italy grows less. Rumors are ap

and Russian envoys have enterejL
the German lines blindfolded on mis
sions connected with the peace.
Meanwhile the sentiment of Russia
seems to be crystallizing against
the radical rulers.
Two recent acts of Germany are
significant. Krupp gun factories
have been opened in Switzerland
and an organization has been form
ed to buy land in Alsace-I.oraln as
rapidly as possible and hold it for
German soldiers in order that thee
provinces may be colonized by Ger
mans. The three northern nations, Nor-
Way, Sweden, and Denmark, after
a conference of tholr kings, have de
cided to remain neutral. They are
seeking to m&ke light of the German
threat to occupy Denmark and the
latter stale shows much indignation

country..
England has been much annoyed

A letter from Lord Lansdowneof
England is receiving much atten
tion during the week. In connection
with other matters, he comments on
the possible effects of a peace be
tween Russia and Germany in which
j England is not a partner. Germany
ihas seized on the incident and is
seeking to take advantage of it.
The council of the Allies recently
held in Paris has made some no
table decisions for more united ac
tion. They derided, however, not to
follow the suggestion of the United
States and make a clear cut state

the present. . ,
Bulgaria is striving to make
peace with Russia and wants to ab
sorb Roumnjiia as one of the tho
conditions. Roumania on the other
hand is .feeling for a peace with
Germany which will enable her to
retain her identity as a nation. In
the meantime Germany is looking
out for her own interests and a
controlling hand in. the Balkans.
It has come to light that Ameri

engaged with railroad construction
in tho Cambrai section. They se
