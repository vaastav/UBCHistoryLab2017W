Interviews with a number of Washing
t m s most prominent bankers j esterday
eli Ited the opinion that the outlook for
Itl- is ery bright, and that not even
the present tendencj on the part of the
political parties to hamper business en

nothcr Important factor In the shap
g of the outlook for the new business
j ear, according to a Washington finan
cier is the attitude of capital toward
labor and vice ersa This question,
wl loh has been assuming a more serious
aspect everj J ear, has Anally arrived at
a point where tho financial and business
c ncerns regard it yvith the gravest mis
givings Instead of relations between
capital and labor becoming more cordial
as the ears go bj, they seem to grow
more acute and unfriendly, and it is this
state of affairs which makes capital still
more afraid and keeps it locked up In
the aults and strong boxes of banks"
It is the opinion of all those who were
interviewed on this point that both cap
ital and labor should realize that
their hostility to each other pro
duces great unrest ev er w here and
causes great injury to business and
withholds that prosperity and happiness
from the people to which they are other
wise so fully entitled, when the great
wealth of the country and the countless
opportunities which It offers are taken
into consideration
It Is suggested that a more friendly
and conciliatory spirit between employer
and employe should take tha place of
that of pertinacity and determination
not to -yield Each rhould take a step in
the direction of meeting the other's con

London, Dec IT W T Stead has writ
ten an article In which he calls attention
to a sentence In President Taft's recent
message on foreign relations. In which
It was stated that "the European situa
tion has thus far been without political
concern for the United States "
Mr Stead denies this, and sajs that If
Mr Taft would dream less about peace
and do more ne might accomplish some
thing He asserts that Mr Taft failed
to do his dut as a real peacemaker when
he did not invoke The Hague convention
in the war between Italy and Turkej
Mr Stead continues.
Shonld Hare Suggested Arbitration
"The facts are simple and Indisputable

and strictly limited obligation to perform
this duty in case of certain circumstances
I arising set forth In the convention. The
circumstances aros twice in the couiWe

not do his dutj on either occasion The
duty to yyhlch I refer is that set forth
In article 27 of the 1S99 convention and
article 4S of 1907 It runs as follows
" 'The signatory powers consider It their
duty. If a stIous dispute threatens to
break out between two or more of them
to remind these latter that the Perma

quently they declare that the act of re
minding the conflicting parties of the

"Neither when Germany and England
were on the eve of war, nor when Italy
forced Turkey into war, did President
Taft do his duty under this article

referring all disputes to arbitration.
"It is aa well that President Taft and
his Secretary of State should be brought
up with a sharp Imperative question If
treaties can be violated without the

William F Gude. and a mighty wave of
sound swept over the concourse and ter
minated by the assemblage rising to Its
feet and shouting for several minutes,
furnishing tho climax to one of the most
enthusiastic meetings ever held in "Wash

making was unabated for four hours

House passed his resolution looking to
tne aDrogatlon of the treaty with Russia.

In Its simplicity and force, and so brim
ful of patriotic sentiment and national
pride that time and again he lifted the ,
audience from Its chairs, causing them 1
to cheer so long and lustily that he had
to ahandon his discourse until the tumult
subsided

Senator Polndexter. of the State of Wash

Representative Murray, of Massachu

applause with their tributes to Repre

of the House, and hopes that the Senate
will annex Itself to the popular opinion
and follow the suit of the lower branch
of Congress
When Representative Sulzer was pre
sented bj Chairman Gude as "one yyho
needs no introduction to this audience,"
the gathering applauded with hand-clap-pmg,
cheers, and shouts of welcome and
praise The demonstration lasted nearly
two minutes, and showed no sign of

of Mr. Sulzer.
He opened his address with the state
ment that the time for oratory is past
and the time for action come He com
pared Russia to a member of Congress

Speaker, I deny the facts," after he had
been proen guilty of the charge Mr.
Sulzer said Russia Is denying the facts,

He continued:

TAFT MAY NOTIFY
RUSSIA AND THEN
INFORM SENATE
Cabinet Members Hurriedly Called to White
House for Conference on Acute Situa
tion Adjourn After Midnight,
CULLOM .OUTLINES PROCEDURE
Other Members of Foreign Relations Committee, How
ever, Urge President to Merely Recommend Termi
nation of Treaty in Message To-day Conflict
ing Advice Prompts Call of Counselors.
As exclusively stated in The Washington Herald esterday, the
President of the United States has decided to terminate the Russian
treaty of 1832. Confirmation was given The Herald early this morn
ing, following the adjournment of a hurriedly called meeting of the
Cabinet, which lasted until ten minutes after midnight. The Presi
dent to-day will either send a special message to Congress informing
both Houses that he lias notified Russia or will urge the Senate to pass
a resolution to that effect.
Should the President on his own initiathe inform Russia pi his
action, the procedure will not be without fi--tcedetit. Mr. Taft will hae
the indorsement of some eminent authorities on international law; but
on the other hand there are many who advocate letting the Senate act
I first.
' The meeting of the Cabinet which was called at the White House
last night at 10 o'clock was a most extraordinary one. All members of
the Cabinet were present, except Postmaster General Hitchcock and
1 Secretaries Fisher and Stimson. The whole Russian imbroglio was
gone over at length, and although Charles D. Hilles, secretary to the
President, announced after the session that nothmg regarding delibera
tions would be gicn out, it was learned on reliable authority that the
President may not await the action of the upper House. 1
It was also said that if the Sulzer resolution is adopted by the Sen
ate unamended the President will veto it. This came in the ' 1 of
notice sen ed on members of the Senate by the President himse
VIIGES TAFT Til CT.
Senator CuIIom. of Illinois, chairman
of the Senate Committee on Foreign Re
lations, has been urging the President
to notify Russia of the desire of the
United States government to terminate
the treaty, and then to send a message
to the Senate, Informing that body of his
action Senator CuIIom has contended
that that would be the proper and most
satisfactory course for the President to
pursue
It woufd afford the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations an opportunity to
sidetrack the Sulzer resolution passed by
the House of Representatives, which Rus
sia regards as offensive, and would make
It easier for the Senate committee to re
port favorably a diplomatic resolution
which would accomplish the termination
of the treaty, but would save the feelings
of the Czar and the St. Petersburg gov
ernment. Other members of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee haye been advising the
President to send a message to Congress
to-day merely recommending the termin
natton of the treaty and waiting for
authorization by Congress before actually
notifying Russia of the intention of this
government to cancel the convention.
Others of Mr. Taft's advisers have
counseled him not to send any communi
cation to Congress at present, but to
await the passage of a suitable resolu
tion at least by the Senate
Up to the Senate.
All of these proposed courses take It
for granted that the termination of the
treaty will be authorized by the Senate
to-day or to-morrow. There Is no longer
any doubt that the treaty will be de
nounced. In fact, a member of the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations had
In his possession last night a resolution
of this character supposed to have the
backing of the administration, which will
be presented at to-day's meeting Of
the Senate. It will be offered probably
as a substitute for the offensive Sulzer
resolution, and will provide merely for
the termination of the treaty with Rus
sia, without going Into reasons In a way
that would unnecessarily offend the Czar's
waa after receiving all this conflict
ing advice that Mr. Taft assembled the
members of his Cabinet at the White
House last night. Those who attended
the meeting were Secretary of State
Knox. Attorney General Wlckersham,
Secretary of the Navy Meyer, Secretary
of- Commerce and Labor Nagel. Secretary
of the Treasury MacVeagh. and Secre
tary of Agriculture Wilson. The three re
maining members of the Cabinet. .Secre
taries Samson and Fisner, ana f ostmas
ter General Hitchcock were out of town.
The impression prevailed late last,
night among persons who had talked
with Mr. Taft and his advisers that
the President will send a communication
to the Senate to-day, recommending
that the treaty be terminated. Accom-i-
panying,thla message to the senate wiu
also probably be a. letter to Senator
CuIIom. Chairman fit the Committee on
Foreign Relations, pointing out that the
treaty Is obsolete, but urging the im
portance of terminating it in a way that
wUI give the least possible offense to
Russia.
T& Prejdnt hi hU Jtttsr, preaM7,
will point out the extremely friendly
relations that hae existed between this
country and Russia and the importance
of preserving them
Tfot to Accuse Russia.
There Is no chance of the President
in any of his communications to the Sen
ate accusing Russia of a -violation of the
treaties, which Is the point chiefly ob
noxious to the Czar's government In the
Sulzer resolution. Russia's attitude Is
that she has not violated the treaty, but
that the misunderstanding has grown
out of a difference of construction be
tween this country and Russia.
Russia holds that passports under the
treaty are to be granted only to Ameri
can merchants entering Russia on busi
ness, while the United States has con
tended that the terms of the treaty ap
ply to all citizens It Is on the basis of
this misunderstanding, which has existed
for years, that President Taft in hn
communications will probably hold that
the treaty Is obsolete.
There was a strong impression last
night that the President's communica
tions to the Senate may contain the
statement that he has already notified
the Russian government, at least in
formally, of this country's desire to ter
minate the treaty. There is no longer
any doubt that the President has in
formed the Russian Ambassador that
thero is no chance of preventing the
termination of the treaty within a few
days, but whether this communication
was in the nature of a formal notification
to Russia Is uncertain.
The members of the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations are practically
unanimous for modifying the Sulzer reso
lution, or substituting one for it that will
not give offense to the Russian govern
ment. The Democrats on the Foreign
Relations Committee seem averse to
bringing politics into the situation in any
way. In fact. Senators Stone and Bacon
declared yesterday that the question was
one entirely outside of partisan consider
ation. Sentiment in the Senate, however.
Is not so entirely solidified against the
Sulzer resolution as to free the Republi
can leaders from some fear aa to the
outcome.
Kearful of Politics. '
Members of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee are fearful that when the ques
tion gets on the floor of the Senate,
politics may enter the situation and
speeches be delivered which wUI add to
the resentment that Russia already feela
over the incident.
The developments of Saturday ap
