Still Harping on the Old Instrument.
The Democratic papers have
in quest of consolation under difficul
ties. The late overwhelming defeat
of their hybrid party came upon them
witu such chocking force as to cause
their whole line to recoil UDder the
blow and fall back from their pie
tended liberal advance to the old negro-hating
line of Democratic sub
mergence. At this point they eject
tbeir heads like a legion of frogs eman
cipated from the ice of spring, and
croak dolorously. And this is the
burden of their song: ''Grant has
been elected by nigger votes ! " "Gree
ley received a majority of all the white
votescast!" "Tine is no longer a white
man's government," etc. Xow, con
sidering the special and laborious ef
forts made by these same Democrats
at the outset of the campaign to se
cure the colored vote for their candi
dates, thia assault upon the colored
voters, and insult to the American
people, is supremely audacious. Mr.
Charles Sumner and Gen. N. P Banks
were detailed by the Dem-Liberal
leaders to write a tearful ad-lress to
the unsoi hislicated colored voter,
explaining and expatiating upon, in
swelling rhetoric, the great things tin
candidate of the Cincinnati and Bal
tlmore conventions had done for the
colored race. But their demagogue-
ical appeals fell upon the ears of the
colored voters like the unmeaning
sounds of " tinkling cymbal and
sounding brass," and, as the vote oi
the States revealed, they were not de
ceived by the pretended friendship o
their hereditary political enemies.
The colored vote was cast for Grant
and Republicanism. This fact lia
aroused the old demon of hate in tht
Democratic heart, and it is breaking
out in Impotent rage through their
party press, probably indulged in a
the only possible palliative congenial
to the temper of the disconsolate, un
consolable, unconscionable, betrayed,
beaten, bursted "anything to beat
Grant-ites." The fact is that when a
Democrat discovers that he cannot
with Impunity ride roughshod over a
colored man, be immediately proceedi
to fan his hate into a consuming fire,
and frantically curses the government
as a " foul and foetid despotism." As
far as heard from in the renewed war.

On last Saturday morning, an on
knovn man entered the passcDger sta
tion-house of the A. A G. W. depot ai
Cleveland, and lying down on one of th
setteea, fell asleep. In a short time br
fell onto the floor. Two men were prea
ent, bat for rm reason gave the mat
no attention. A policeman came ii
shortly, and supposing the man war
drunk or asleep tried to arouse him,
and discovered that he was dead A cor
oner's jury was called and returned th
verdict : " Died from unknown causes."
The deceased was believed to be a labor

drinking and exposure had caused bi
death.
The Nashville Banner is one of the
several Southern papers that have accept
ed the result of the election with good
heart. It is now employing itself in
reading lectures to some of its brethren
on the folly of eternal hate, and it i
doing good service. But what will tbi
Greeley journals say when they find thai
this Southern piper declares that tin
men who need to lay aside theit bate,
and enmities are Southerners, and not
Northerner!? This eon firm al.on ortue
views expressed by Republican papen-
during the Frssidsntial canvass come-
late, but it is, nevertheless, worth re
cording.
We regret to learn from the Delaware
(0.) Gazette, of last week, of the wiih
drawal from that paper, as one of the

Axfekd E. Lee. Captain Lee is indu -trious,
painstaking and discriminatin-. ,
and has exhibited super.or talent In tin
editorial capacity. We are not advised
as to tke pursuit he may have de terra Id
d upon for the future, but whatever ii
may be, we shall expect him to prosper
and shall ever be glad to learn of his
success.
The suggestion or ths IT. T. 2Vf6n
and a Nashville paper that the elector
in those Slate which gave Greeley a
majority, should cast tbeir electoral
votes for Grant, and there bv give pra. ti
eal evidence of their desire to cairy out
Mr. Greeley's reconciliation theory, ha
in no instance been complied wiih.
Some voted for Hendricks, of Indi
ana, he being the only specimen of
Democracy and hybridism that was not
wallowed op in the October and No
vember political earthquakes and some
voted for Greeley others for B. Grata
Brown ; all showing the sentiment to be,

Tribune states that the Misses Gree

for their personal benefit should be
adhered to. It will be a work of time
to determine the condition of Mr.
Greeley's estate ; but. however it msy
have been impaired by liberality per
haps too great, by loan of bis own
credit to those who proved unwoithy
of it, or by an overweening confidence
of men's promises, there is probably
enough remaining to quiet all these

The Comptroller of the currency bas

the fact that since the organization of
'he National bans system, in 1S63, only
11 National banks have failed of their
Kttreaate circulation s2,942,793. The
treasury bas reduced 12,44 1,430, and
stands ready to redeem the balance as
own as presented. Tho holders of these
lutes, owever, are in no hurry. Very
likely but few of them are aware that
.he bauks have failed. Not oue man in
hundred looks at the name of the bank
issuing the note. Everybody knows
hat there is provided a fund ample for
the redemption. When we compare the
present stability of our circulating me
Jiuui with the wild cat eras of the past,
Ae realize something of the mairnilioent
character of Republican statesmanship,
t he first t:ret point of stabi ity bas been
reached. Within the true limits of the
-ystem it is now proposed to introduce
leal u res which will give greater elastici
ty to the currency aud enable It to adapt
itself more readn'v to the changing wants
of business. Tuese are points to which
ibe Comptroller invites the special at
tention of Congress.
There are two ways resorted to by
money leaders in Washington to get
usurious rates ol interest out of the tin
fortunate (distressed) oorrower. The
nrst, perhaps the lew, objeciionanle way,
it Irom the hanks which generally have
.oiifi.leiilial agents who are generally
.lenominated "Keal estate aeon's or bro
kers," who also inform the public that
claims are coliecud, and money loaned
on good collateral at lu per cent, per
Annum, (as p. r act of Congress some
wo years ago, allowing utiui a rale in
special contra'-t.) These agents are
rfiCftht alter oy nunareus ueeaitig money
who are politely iuformed that they
nave money to loan ou desirable proper-
but require an abstract title made oy
certain party to whom the borrower is
respectfully referred. From Jio to c25
is charged for an examination. He
pays it with hope then on the proaenta
tioii of bis abstract to the asent, the
money will be foitbcomiug. But to his
disappointment he is told, "I am out of
uouey to -dav, call again in a da or two
and I'll accommodate you." He ca Is
again aud again, and at last is told that
the money market is very tibt and that
ue can only act a agent for which be
shall be compelled to charge him from
5 to 10 per cent, (according to the amount
loaued) for procuring it for him. Gen
erally this offer is accepted as the only
alternative, and the bank, tb-reby,
doubtless receives not only the 10 per
ceat-, but a portion of the agent's feo.
Your correspondent will entuie to say
that one-third of the real estate in Wash
ington is under similar loans, paying iu-
directly 20 per cent per annum.
The second way is practiced by parties
who openly make money-broking a
speciality, making short loans, and re
quiring uo real estate security, but to
those outsioe of Government employ,
good endorsers are required, and these
uotesare what is kuown as made note,
L e , the note is made to a outilideutial
third party, who w inks for the sake ol a
division of the spoils, to a discount of
from a to lu per cent, per mon i n. l nere

ers playing upon the distressed of this
city and who have amassed fortunes iu

No insurance. Loss $3,000. The origin

The loss falls heavily on the proprietors ;

they respectfully solicit a liberal share of

A Grate Charge. One evening soon
after Mr. Greeley's death, we knocked
at the door of the Pastor or the Dis
ciple church. As he opened to us, with
out scarcely waiting to pass the usual
salutation, he said : "Did you know that
Horace Greeley was doad T " Being an
swered in the affirmative, be continued:
Yea; and you helped kill him.'" We
hastened to our home, meditating on the
criminal charge brought against. After
looking the matter over with all the cool
ness and candor that we could command,
we arrived at the following conclusions :
1st If Mr. Greeley's death was caused
by his defeat, as intimated by our frimid.
we see more clearly than before the
great wisdom of the Republicans in with
holding from him their suffrage, and iu
sustaining Mr. Grant.
2d It reveals most clearly the extreme
folly of our clerical friend and his asso
ciates in sustaining him; for it is most
obvious that if he died in consequence
of his defeat, his mind had become ton
much impaired to be able to discharge
the important duties of President.
3d If bis death resulted from causes
wholly independent of h a defeat, then
be would have died all the same had he
been elected ; and in that case the office
would have bad to be filled by tbe Vice
President, Brown, which, I think, would
not have been gratifying to our reverend
friend, and which would have placed the
nation in s most perilous condition. If,
however, his death was in consequence
of his defeat, as is confidently expressed
by our clerical friend, we most positively
refuse to accept the charge so unceremo
niously brought against us, but insist
that our reverend friend and bis associ
ates are the guilty parties ; for bad they
admonished Mr. Greeley at tbe outset,
and given him plainly to understand, as
true friends should have done, that he
was not equal to the responsibilities that
would rest upon hi'ii, the disappoint
ment would have been far less, and ue
doubtless would have been able to with
stand the presjure. But flattering his
vanity, as they did, nrging him on and
assuring h'm of victory, when tbe intel
ligence reached of his overwhelming de
feat, it was more than his shattered
nerves and disordered brain could en
dure, and he sank under the pressure.
We .therefore hurl back the charge
brought against us by our clerical friend
upon himself and bis associates, nnd in
sist thst he and his party were the ones
who " helped kill him." Of Mr. Greeley's
improprieties we feel no disposition to
speak. If be had faults we will bury
them with the ashes of tbe dead ; and
will but remember his virtues, which
were many. As a journalist he bad no
superiors, and as such we shall treasure
his memory.

lively interest in it on the part of every
man, woman and child wi,o knows how
to resd.
Tbe volume Is a complete and consrc

piessly for this book. It includes a large
number oi thrilling incidents never be

credited i un. or. has hsen afloat for

"We are informed on the best au

the TriUune has been tendered to
Vice President Colfax, who bus the
matter under Consideration. It is
probable that Mr Colfax will feel it to
be his duty to accept the position, the
most teniptiuir pecutiiary oiler now
made. It is proper, iu this connection
to say that Mr. Colfax, for some time
past, has been preparing to retire en

pleusaut home at South Bend. His
income in tiie future would have been
comparatively small, yei with bis ac
customed economy and rigid princi

would have pnajeeded very comforta

oilers made to him rtceutiy, but has
declined them all. The sudden and

suddenly and unexpectedly opened
his new and inviting field to him.

commenting upon the proposition of
the national Board of Trade for the
establishment of a national Depart

word ' national" aud wishes the

drift of things toward a consolidated
nation instead of that disjointed and
feeble confederacy, ill hicli a ower

i.rauic basis of slavery, to dictate the
policy of the whole. The increase in
national power; tbe promotion of the
