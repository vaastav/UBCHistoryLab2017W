Los Angeles, Cal.. Dec. 5. James B.

Judge Walter Brodwell, Who Sentenced
today by Judge Walter Bordwell. His
brother, John J. McXamara, secretary
of the International Association of
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers,
who confes ed to the dynamiting of
the- Llewellyn Iron works, was sen
tenced to 15 years In the penitentiary.
.- Twentv-one Dersons lost their lives in
the Times disaster. Xo one was killed
in th Llewellyn Iron works affair.

tin -penitentiary
'Hear ye, hear ye. hear ye!" cried
the baitiff at 10:23 o'clock, opening
court, and as he spoke Judge Bordwell
mounted the bench. A moment later
Attorney Clarence S. Darrow, chief of
counsel for the defense, followed by
Lecompte Davis and Joseph Scott en
tered. Behind them trailed the Mc
Xamcras. "Are you ready to proceed?" asked
Judge Bordwell.
"The state is." said Fredericks, and
read J. B. McXamara's' confession
amid absolute silence. This is the
confession sent out in the morning
dispatches.
Murder in First Degree.
"Is thru statement correct?" said the
court.
"It is." said McNamara,
"Then the court finds." said the judge,
"that the degree of guilt of the defend
ant is murder in the first degree.
-James B. McXamara. you may stand
up," 'ie said.
"What is your full name?"
"Jtimes Boyd McXamara," said the
prisoner.
The court then began a formal state
ment reciting the indictment for mur
der of Charles J. Haggerty upon which
McXamara pleaded guilty and asked
MiXamura if he had any statement to
make.
"I have not," he said.
"Have you anything to say?" he ask
ed Fredericks.
"There has been no dickering or bar
gaining in this matter, ne saia.

Vware of the usual custom of granting ;
clemency to persons pieaanis gum.;.
This defendant by so pleading has set
tled for all time a question which oth
erwise would always have been in
doubt. He saves the state great ex
pense and served the state- in other
ways."
The Court's Comment.
"The defendant will arise." said Judge
Bordwell and commented upon Mc
Xamara's declaration that he did not
intend to destroy life.
Th. rlrnimstances are against that
statement," he said. "A man who will j
place 3 6 sticks of dynamite in a place)
where you, as a printer, knew gas was j
burning in many places and knew
many were toiling, must have had no
rerard for life: must nave been a mur
derer at heart and undeserving of,
clemency." I
For reasons other than such a plea
of nonintent. Judge Bordwell declared, ,
he would impose the penalty of im
prisonment for life. ,,.'
John J McXamara came next. The
Llewellyn Iron works indictment was
read to him by the judge. He said
he had nothing to say. District At-,
rnev Fredericks, nowevei. swu urn

permitted consideration, but pleaded
that the defendant. John J. McXamara,
be given "a few years of freedom at,
th. end of his life." i

strictures against James B. McNamara j
would also apply to him.
Clemency, he declared, was not be
cause of merit as to intent. He then
Imposed sentence of 15 years in San

Quentiu prison, one more year than
had been predicted.
The McNamaras were taken from
the court room back to the jail. Their
counsel left the room with them and
the crowd filed out, laughing and chat
ting. Judge Bordwell also left at once,
returning to his chambers.
Early Incidents.
Two hours before court opened 500
curious men and women assembled
about the corridors of the hall of rec
ords to catch a last glimpse of the
prisoners. One hundred men detailed
from the sheriff's force of deputies
marshaled the throng into line along
the several flights of stairs leading
from the basement of .the hall of rec
ords to the eighth floor, where Judge
Bord well's court is located.
The McXamara brothers faced the
prospect of sentence with more than
equanimity. They rose in good spirits
and made rapid work of a big break
fast of ham and eggs, coffee and coun
try sausage. James B. McNamara
smilingly met the greetings of his
guards, while John J. appeared to be
the McXamara Brothers Today.
more concerned about his personal ap
pearance than usual. He worried con
siderably because his trousers had not
been pressed with the proper creases.
Both men joked with Jailer Gallag
her. They told him they expected to
be his guests for some time longer, or
until the federal grand jury finished
gleaning from them the information
which it is believed the United States
authorities are seeking regarding the
"inner ring."
Lawlor Is Appointed.
Oscar Lawlor, formerly assistant
United States attorney general and a
prominent figure in the Ballinger-Pin-chot
investigation, today received word
of his appointment by Attorney Gen
eral Wickersham as special prosecutor
in the inquiry into the alleged dyna
miting conspiracy. Mr. Lawlor has
been assisting District Attorney Fred
ericks for the last two months and is
familiar with the evidence which the
state gathered against the McXamara
brothers.
"I am convinced." said Mr. Lawlor
today, "that the investigation will re
veal one of the most dastardly con
spiracies in the history of the country.
I think the government owes it not
only to those concerned directly, but
to the working people as a whole, to
put an end to things of this kind."
Much Uncertainty Prevailed.
Judge Walter Bordwell summoned a
neu-fpaper man and told him to tell the
others to go to department 12 of the
superior court which is in the hall of
justice, a building adjoining the jail
and connected with it by a covered
bridge.
This was taken as absolute confirma
tion that the sentence would be pro
nounced there.
As the hours drew on. the crowd on
the eighth floor of the hall of records
.augmented steadily but was quiet and
orderly. Z. T. Nelson, a talesman in
the case, excused some weeks ago. ap
peared with his wife and was allowed
to enter the court room and select a
teat for himself. Rumor persisted, how
ever, that the sentences would be pro
nounced in a court room in the hall of
justice. This hall adjoins the jail and
is connected with it by a covered bridge.
To reach the hall of records on the
other hand it is necessary to cross a
street, climb a winding flight of steps
into the court house yard, go through
a long, poorly lighted corridor, across
ano'ther open srace and up six stories in
an elevator.
Under Sheriff 'Robert F. Brain de
clared his orders were to take the Mc
Xnmaras to the hall of records.
Samuel L. Browne, chief investigator
for the state, the various assistant dis
trict attorneys and practically all offi
cials connected with the case were un
informed as to the contemplated move.
Court House Door Barred.
At half past 9 the lock on the court
room door was reinforced by a great
bar of oak, six inches across, fitted
into heavy brass sockets on the door
jamb and extending clear across the
double doors. -This was taken down
from time to time to admit persons
who could show special permission to
enter the room.
Presently Assistant District Attor
ney G. Ray Horton. District Attorney
Fredericks's chief trial deputy, ap
peared and Clerk George Monroe came
with a batch of papers under his arm.
Every available space in the room
was filled with chairs and the water
pitchers and glasses on the desks of
court and counsel shone from burnish-inp-s
of porters.
The court room windows fronting
east were shaded by awnings and most
of the light of the room came from a

job when discovered on Broadway by
detectives.

German Chancellor Makes a Statement
of the Case,
Berlin, Dec. 5. The Morocco question
came up today at the final session of the
reichstag. Imperial Chancellor Von
Betlvmann-Hollweg gave a calm and dis

NO BLACKLIST
Lumber Dealers Deny the Allegations
of the Government.
Denver, Dec. 5. The Colorado and
Wyoming Lumber Dealers' association
hag filed in the federal court an answer
to the government's suit charging viola
tion of the Sherman anti-trust law. Ad
mitting the truth of many of the conten
tions set up in the complaint, the an
swer denies that the defendants' asso
ciation Is engaged in restraint of trade in
any way and that its principal duty Is the
dissemination of information of the lum
ber business among its members.
The association contends that by the
natural law of trade retailers object to
wholesalers selling direct to consumers
and that such sales are made clandes
tinely. The answer declares there Is no
blacklist and that each member acts as
he sees fit when informed of the names
of wholesalers who sell direct to con
sumers. FINDS DRIVER DEAD

CLARK HEADQUARTERS.

Mo., to further the movement to se
cure for the Missourian the Demo
cratic nomination for the presidency
in 1912.
An open letter, subscribed to by a
local committee of ten leading Demo
crats and a like number from as many
cities and towns in the state, recites,
in part, as follows, what they believe
to be Speaker Clark's chief qualifi
cations as a claimant to the nomina
tion: "The speaker's record Invites scru
tiny. He is conservative yet progres
sive. He would make a vigorous and
popular canvass of the country. He
would carry his home state by an
overwhelming vote. He would satisfy
each 'wing of the Democratic party.
He would not alarm any honest busi
ness." ARE OFFICERS "FIT"?

TO THE CONGRESS
President Taft Submits His An
nual Message.
He Says There Are Several
Others to Follow.
DEALS WITH TRUSTS.
Only One Subject Mentioned in
the Communication.
Renews His Recommendation for
Federal Incorporation.
Washington, Dec. 5. President
Taft's third annual message to con
gress, devoted exclusively to the Sher
man anti-trust act and the trust ques
tion in general was read in congress
Who Was Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Destroying the Tos Angeles
Times Building and Causing the Death of Twenty-One Men.
today.
The president defended the Sherman
act as Interpreted by the supreme
court of the United States, indicated
plainly his opposition to the repeal of
the amendment of this statute, but
suggested that congress pass a federal
incorporation law and supplemental
legislation that "would describe and
denounce methods of competition that
are unfair."
To supervise corporations chartered
under federal law. President Taft pro
posed the creation of an executive bu
reau, or commission, with powers akin
to those of the interstate commerce
commission. ,
Speaking of the much discussed
dissolution of the Tobacco trust, the
president declared that in his opinion
"not in the history of American law
has a decree more effective for such a
purpose been entered by a court."
Portions of his message of January,
1910, proposing federal incorporation
were referred to in this message.
"I renew," continued the president,
"the recommendations of the enact
ment of a general law providing for
the voluntary formation of corpora
tions to engage in trade and com
merce among the states and with for
eign nations. It is even more mani
fest now than it was then that the
denunciation of conspiracies in re
straint of trade should not, and does
not, mean the denial of organizations
large enough to be entrusted with our
interstate or foreign trade. It has
been made more clear now than it
was then that a purely negative
statute like the anti-trust law may
well be. supplemented by specific pro
visions for the building up and reg
ulation of legitimate national and for
eign commerce."
The supplemental legislation the
president desires, is explained in a
paragraph, "The attempt and purpose
to suppress a competitor by undersell
ing him at a price so unprofitable as
to drive him out of business, or the
making of exclusive contracts with
customers under which they are re
quired to give up associations with
other manufacturers and numerous
kindred methods for stifling competi
tion and effecting monopoly, should
be described with sufficient accuracy
in a criminal statute, on the one hand
to enable the government to shorten
its task by prosecuting single misde
meanors instead of an entire conspir
acy, and, on the other hand, to serve
the purpose of pointing out more in
detail to the business community what
must be avoided."
Mr. Taft did not attempt to set
forth the details of the federal incor
poration act he recommended, but
suggested that combinations of capi
tal allowed to become federal corpor
ations should be subject to rigid rules
as to organization and procedure, in
cluding effective publicity, and to the
"closest supervision" as to stock and
bond issues by the proposed executive
bureau or commission in the com
merce and labor departmert.
Federal incorporation, the president
declared, would not exempt any con
cern or its officers from prosecution
under the Sherman act for illegal acts.
Such an act could be framed so as to
prevent "vexatious and unnecessary

J. B. McXamara Writes Brief
Confession of Guilt
In the Blowing Up of the Los
Angeles Time.
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE
Willingly, to Bring Back the
Victims of His Work.
Declares He Had No Intention ol
Killing Anyone.
Los Angles, Dec 5. James B. Mc
Xamara's brief confession, penned by
his own hand late yesterday and bear
ing many evidences of a man little
skilled in letters, was made public to-
day. It is as follows:
"I, James B. McNamara, defendant
in the case of the people, having here
tofore pleaded guilty to the crime of
murder, desire to muke this statement
of facta:
"And this is the truth:
"On the night of September 30,
1910, at 5:45 p. m., I placed in Ink
Alley, a portion of the Times building,
a suit case containing 16 sticks of SO
per cent dynamite set to explode at 1
o'clock the next morning. It was my
intention to injure the building and
scare the owner.
"I did not intend to take the life of
anyone. I sincerely regret that these
unfortunate men lost their lives. If
the giving of my lire would bring
them back I would gladly give It. It
fact in pleading guilty to murder In
the first degree I have placed my life
in the hands of the state.
"james b. McXamara."
The confession covers one side of
an ordinary sheet of paper and waa
written with a fountain pen supplied
by one of the attorneys. It probably ia
the only written statement of the case,
that ever will be made by the writer
or his brother. John J. McXamara,
who pleaded guilty to dynamiting the
Llewellyn Iron works.
SAVKD BVO I'AH DK.
Times Building Was Marked for a Sec
ond Explosion.
Ixs Angeles. Cal.. Dec. 5. "If another
dose of dynamite doesn't unionise Loa
Angeles we will blow up the waterworks
and explode enough mines to burn the
city. We can give them until 191E, and
If they haven't mended their ways by
then we will make that .Mace an ex
ample the world will always remember."
This, according to a heretofore unpub
lished portion of Ortle McManlgala con
fession, waa the substance of a threat
made by the Mc-Namaraa after they had
blown up the Los Angeles Times and
killed twenty-one of Its employees.
The plan was discussed. McManlgal
said. In connection with his trip to Loa
Angeles last Christmas when he blew up
the Llewellyn Iron Works, the crime to
which John J. McNamara pleaded guilty
of being the Instigator.
McManlgal. who was J. B. McNamara'a
chief assistant In more than a score of
dynamite outrage, was sent to "give
the Times a second dose." Undeterred
by the appalling loss of life In the Tlmaa
dlaaster, the McNamaras determined to
break the defiant spirit of Oen. Harrison
Gray Otis, owner of the Times, by placing
a bomb against thr auxiliary plant hi
which the paper was published after lta
main building was destroyed. McManl
gal confessed that he came fully Intend
ing to blow up the auxiliary plant.
"But when I got hre," explained Mc
Manlgal. when retelling Ma story, "I
found the place so closely guarded that
I couldn't do anything without taking
some lives. So far as I am aware ray
stuff never killed anybody. I waa always
careful to set my clocks to go off when
there would be nobody on the job.
And I wasn't going to be a murderer
even to 'get the Times.' so I took tho
suitcase bomb which I had brought on a
paasenger train from Chicago and laft it
at the Llewellyn Iron Works."
