ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
I again recommend to Conerrss the psRsnfe of
a law m parsnano of the provision, of the coij-
, Mltution, appointing a day certain, pravioaa to
the 4th of March , iu each year of an odd number,
' for the election of represeutat Ives throughout all
the Mates. A similar power baa already been
exercised, with general approbation, iu tb p
polntmentof the same day throughout the Union
for holdiug the election of electors tor President
and Vtoe fresMent of tha United Mates. My
attention waa earuosUy directed ta this subject
from the fact that tbe 3oth Congress terminated
on the id ot March. 1839, without making the
necessary expropriation tor the servlcs of the
Post Othce Department. 1 wua then toroed to
consider ths best remedy lor this omission, aud
an immediate call of the present Congress was
tha natural resort. Upon Inquiry, however. I as.
eertained that fifteen out ot the thirty-tares
States composing the C'onleileracy were without
representatives, and that, cniavquentiy. these Hi",
teen btatee would be dt. anclu.ed by such a
call. These ill teen btatee wiU tie in the same

power of lb President to assemble a iuU Con

yet her wool revenue from linooil at tbe present

between ranee and England, one of the article
provides that the ad valorem duties wbicb it Im
poses shell be converted Into specidc duties with
in six months from it date, and these are to be
ascertained by making an anvetage of the prices
for six months previous to that tune. Ths reverss
of tbe proposition would be nearer to the truth
because a much larxer amount of revenue would
bs collected by merely convening the ad valorem

Thanksgiving.
Tbe New York Timet sayt on of tbe moat
interesting events connecttd with the, cele
bration of Thanksgiving in Brooklyn, occur
red At tbe Elm place Congregational Church,
Key. M. Bartlett, pastor. In lieu of a sermou
tbe society prepared a dinner in lbs body ot
tbe Oburch for the poor, and hundreds par
took of a better dinner than tbey ever saw
before. The main floor of the building wot
filled with tables, upon which wat placed a
variety of edibles, including one hundred and
twenty-five turkeja,roast beet, puddingt, pas
try of all kinds, sauces, celery, vegetables,
and all the condiments of a well tiippliel ta
ble. Tbe doors were opened at eleven o'clock
and the tablet were full all the time from
twelve until three o'clock, during which time
not lee than 2,000 persons obtained a good
dinner. The proceedings were opened by
prayer and tinging, bud a' gbort address by
the pastor, and at the close the Doxology was
sung by all present Nearly all who joined
In the feast were women and children. Tbe
wbole management was carried out in an
admirable manner, and reflects much credit
upon the Society more especially the ladiet
thereof, who tor the nonce acted at waitbrs,
while their male frlendt executed the more
arduous doty of carving. Tbe soens wau one
that will long be remembered by those who
participated, and those who bad the pleasure

Hado New Jsbsivi -One terribly rtormy

A Railroad to Eden.
Many, In all afres, bare beea- th specula
tions as to where KJen was, and, among oth
ers, tome remarkably wise men -there It no
telling how many centuries ago pitched
upon the month of the Ked Boa as the verita
ble reality. It it a imall town and seaporQ
Well inpplicd with wstef, and rather a pleas;
ant and heulty tituation, with a lofty peak of
rook called Cap Aden, rising tome seventeen
hundred feet out of the water, ln tact, it it
tbe last place it the world to realize the tl
socipUan of fcdenct Oeneait. f xiiu he matter,
an Urientnl imagination Can find Eden any
where, and the most interesting information
lu regard to it, by tbs last mail, ia that tha
Kgyptain Uovernment, finding tbe railroad
from Alexandria to Suet to profitable, have
resolved to extend It down southward along
the African thore of the Red Sea to within a
short distance of Aden. Thit will save five
dayt' steaming or) the rocky and ever dan
gerous Ited Sea, and no doubt prove profita
ble ennngh to the Pasha, who construct! it,
especially if it Bads favor In the eyet of the
British Government. It Will' bave to pass
Within tight on tbt other tide, however, of
the Red Sea of the Mountain of Sinai,
where the law was given to Moses. ' Sues it
the tpot in all probability, where tbe Israel
ites crossed the Red Sea, wandering thence
down tho coast on the Asiatic tide to Ho
reb.' What a'tlngnlnr change railroads make,
after all, In people's Ideas, In their fortunes,
and In their live. Had tuch a railway only
existed in the times ot Moses, half a dtty't
joirney wdttld have enabled tbe Egyptian!
to overtake the refractory Hebrews, by sim
ply crossi.ig the Red Sea a little lower down.
What is more eingnlnr, It that the Egyptaint
did actually have railroads of a certain kind
then, and had tbem for ages, on which they
used to transport tbe blocks on which tbe
pyramids were built.
But only let ut attempt to fancy a journey
to Kden, the veritable and brigiutd home of
the race, by railroad, with locomotives, and
ttenm puffing, and steam whistles blowing
off their ttenm. Who ever expected Para
dise to ,be thus easily regained, at least on
earth? But tuch a Paradise, tuch an Kden
at the Arnbi'in Aden, never yet entered Into
the heart of man. It it now a tyal ttalion,
nominally and primarily, for the British
steameri navigating the Red Sea. From
twenty-four to thirty thousand tons of ship
ping annually visit that port, mostly steam
ers. The population bat risen from two
thousand to twenty or thirty thousand, in
the last twenty years. Men of all races are
there, and men of all religions and all tongues.
It is more like Babel than Paradise. The
mosques of tbe Mussclmnn attest its former
greatness, when Solymnn the Great made it
hrst the key of India. Frowning battle
ments crown itt flights, and tbe booming
cannon stretches its arm ot iron across the
entrance to that inland tea. Its islands are
studded with fortifications, under the pre
text of defending tbe light-bouse, and tbe
sciirlet uniform of the British soldier is seen
pacing to and fro upon its ramparts. 'When
the railroad train comes pulling and panting
along tbe shores of that Red Sea, to the land
ing opposite Aden, the contrast with all the
old idea of Paradise will be still more com
plete. Indeed, tbe English, in finding new
wayt to India, teem bound to lay a rail
road to Paradise, be it where It will; for all
the country between the Tigris and the Eu
phrates is being pretty accurately scanned
with its railway possibilities. Philadelphia
The Prince of Wales at Home.
.The London Newt thus speaks of the
return of the Prince to England :
The Prince of Wales brings home, we are
persuaded, a heart thrilling with affection
lor the mighty offspring ot England, and a
deep resiei;t tor that energetic freedom and
expanding power. He brings borne, too an in
tellect sharpened and strengthened by contract
with the vitality of anew civilization. He hat
tasted the life and destiny of the New World.

without ao army, cival order without a police

an aristorrsrv. He bas learned to mingle with
bt buy crowd of men without tbe intervention
oi cuautueiiiu and courtiers: be bas found
respect without ceremony, and honour with
out adulation. He bas dwelt, too, in England
at tea; and nowhere can he have belter learn
ed the secret of England's greatness that, in
bit experiences on board the Hero in the At

to gay that the Prince has been singularly for
tunate in tbe selection of a Secretary of State
to attend him on his travels. It teems a hap
py concidence that at tbe hour when the royal
squadron was making the English land on
Wednesday night the Prime Minister was
eloquently acknowledging the hotpitalitiet
wnich tbe frince of Wales bod enjoyed in the
United Slates.
. The London Times eayt ; '; '. "''
It isnot everybody who can best do that
which It bis most natural part, for it is tbe
highest merit tn be jtitt that which a man
ought to be. The commonest form of error
it to attempt a part notone't own, or to com
bine two in one. The Prince of Wales has
only shown himself in his own proper charac
ter as the bead of the young British gentry,
the future sovereign of a constitutional conn try
and the representative of an empire whose
best interests are to be at peace with all tbe
world, and which neither hopes for aggrand
izement nor fears any foe. He has expressed
to the Americans the real sentiment of every
British heart to that great cognate nation.
There it none in which we are all so interes
ted ; none the successes and glories of which
we all hear with such unmixed satisfaction;
none with which we to identify ourselves.
The Prince of Wales, while showing tbe feel
ings of a true-born Englishman, bas elicited
the feelingi ot all true-born Americans, and
so brought the two face to face and made
them feel they are brothers.

The Kansas Troubles.
- A CTrweprmdent of the Leavenworth Timet
Write the following letter, which givet tome
light upon the civil war ln Kansas' ,
TRADING Port, K. T, Nov. 11, 1860.
Manias. Jditom Vou are probably aware
that this fair country has been infested by a
set of fiendt front M httmurl, and tome from
thit Territory. Tbey bave been endeavoring
to kidnap several of our citizens, and to at
tntsinate others. The tree State settlers'
lives are in jeopardy as long at this hellish
business It allowed or tolerated.
During the last three weeltt there have
been several companies of armed pro-s!wry
rutflane from Missouri and Kansas, proffitalr
around our part of the - Territory, making
their threat and cursing the "Abolitionist,"
and swearing eternal vengenoe on all wbo
sympathise with them. Tbey bave uade
two attempt to kidnap tiegroety but bave
tailed in both. - They bave made different
attempit to assassinate our most honored cit
ileus, and ordered off others continually ln
laot, they have had tbe set tiers in a general
state of excitement tor the last three weeks.
Tbey say that Missouri is ready to back them.
There was a company of these fellows wbo
met at Jordon a, about two miles from this
place, and held a meeting, and there they
agieed to continue tbe business until they
caught and captured the negro who is at or
near Mound City, and one also at Montgom
ery'! ; but I think tbey will fail in both cas
es. They proceeded to Capt Montgomery's,
but. the Captain't dog frightened them. So
that they thought they would not make xbo
attack; to they returned without accom
plishing anything. ,
. On baturday last, the citisent met and de
termined to put thit thing down.. Tbey or
ganised and appointed Dr. O. R. Jamison to
act as tx mmander in tbe case. By hit order
they proceeded to the residence! of those
wbo reside, in the Territory, thai bad been
engaged in that business, and took them all
prisoners that were at bome,wme being atvay.
Tbey then proceeded to the bouse of U. Hinds,
one who bad bet n the foremost of all, and bas
made it hit business to continually barrast
tbe Free State tettlert tince the year ot '58,
and they also arrested him. Tbit man Hinds
was driven out of thit country in the spring
of '18, by the free State settlers, but has re
turned again. ' He resided one-quarter of a
mile from the State line, so handy that he
could make his escape into the State upon
committing any depredation, and 30 protected
by tbem. , i
The citizens, after arresting them all, ap
pointed a gang of twelve men, and proceed
ed to try them according to vigilance court
order. Alter Bwearing the jury, tbey pro
ceeded to trial, in the presence of all. . Tbe
evidence was all taken, and, after hearing all
the facts made public, tbe jury retired and
returned , the following verdict: ''We, the
jury, alter considering all the testimony, and
consulting together, agree that all the per
sons, with tbe exception of Mr. Russell
Hinds, shall be discharged from custody, on
condition that they leave the Territory with
in seven days; that this being their first of
fense as kidnappers, they will be discharged
on the above conditions; further,- as -clear
proof, and also bis confessions, tbow that he
has at different timet been engaged in this
unhallowed business since he was driven
from the Territory, that tbe said Russell
Hinds merits death, and that he shall be bung
by the neck until he is dead I dead II dead III
The assembly then proceeded to execute the
criminal according to the verdict, which was
done by an unexcited but determined people.
The execution took place at 9 o'clock A. M.,
on tbe 11th of November, on the premises ol
Mr. Campbell, one of the criminals that was
discharged. Notice was also eiren on the
ground thall all who engaged in that kind of
business would be dealt with likewise.
. Tbe company then disban led and then re
turned home to attend to their business. .
Dr. Hayes' Expedition Among the Icebergs.
Surgeon Longthaw, of the Hayes Arctic
Expedition, but at present in 'Boston, fur
nishes to tbe Journal of that city an inter
esting account vf the expedition. Of tbeir
cruising among the Icebergs, we clip tbt fol
lowing: Wednesday, August 1, wat a fine day
with no lack of sensation lor tbe ship's com
pany. At ten in tbe morning the thore of
Disco I.-laud was abont fire miles oil, and
visible for the length of thirty miles north
and south. Tbe high mountain peaks, their
topi bidden iu tli clouds, and seemingly
reaching to the sky above; the mountain
tides covered with snow, and the dazzling
glaciers, constituted a glorious scene; and
still more so was it in the gorgeous li hts
and shades of tunset. .At noou, forty-tcven
iceberg! were counted on tbe port side of tbn
vessel. One monster resembled a Mississippi
steamboat loaded with cotton, only much
magnified; another looked like a house, the
gable end toward tbe spectator; another bore
a very striking resemblance to the col life urn
at Rome; another was like a quadrangular
fort with its cannon mounted end its sentries
on duty; another sailed majestically on like a
square-rigged ship; and others tn which t e
imagination discovered animals, buildings,
castles, cathedrals, and a thousand vagaries
of form.
When off Omenak Fiord, at 7 P. M.., 80
icebergs were counted across the mouth of
that sound, and there were 140 in sight to
the westward. These came from a mcr de
glace in tbe Interior, though some of the
young gentlemen averred that there was a
steam factory constantly engaged in their
manufacture, which ttatement was favored
by the fact that on the borders of the " fiord"
was a large coal mine.
On Saturday, August 4, the tun did not set
upon the expedition. Thit was tbe first
night in' which they bad entire sunlight.
The sky being cloudless, tbe tun was seen the
entire night, first to pass slowly in a circle to
the northward, and then eastward, till it began
to rise again.
The expedition wag becalmed several days
Off " Svorte Hook," but at length reached a
point within tight of the low inlands, beneath
Sanderson's Hope, . a great landmark for
for Arctic navigators. At this time a ice ne
of sublimity was witnessed. The coast, for
miles on either band to tbe north and south,
was plainly visible. Cliffs, high or low land,
mountains and Inlets, were teen in the dis
tance, while around tbe vessel floated thou
sands of icebergs. In tbe interval! between
the heavy report and roar of tailing or turn
ing icebergs, the noise of tbe surf or tea beat
ing against each of the many bergs was dis
tinctly heard, sounding as a distant Niagara
or a near small water-fall, to continuous was
the noise. Tbe greater part of the time the
crushing and crumbling of tbe bergs, in
turning over and coming in collision with each
other, or of detached pieces falling, or a glacier
parting from its mer de glactmi rolling down
a thousand feet into the sea, kept up a terrific
cannonade.

Joe Lane it some on tlcmegoguism. In thit
department ef fine artt be it tirst withoutany

were nobody to him. Indeed, if you took the
demagoguisn out uf Joe, you would leave
him like a balloon w ills tbe gas out of itt body.
a very mall and shriveled concern. Joe
bad a trick of knowing everybody, and every
body Joe knew was hit most intimate friend.
He would meet an acquaintance at another
man would meet a brother he thought bad
been lost at tea. He extends both bands and
makes hit countenance as expressive as na
tu:e would allow of affectionate sympathy.
Coming back from Washington City to Ore
gon, Joe full in with a countryman (Mr.Jones)
near whose bouse he happened to be travel
ing, before tbe election. Jo recognized bim
at once.
"Old fellow," taid Joe, "God blest yon,
how are you and the wife and tbe children?
D n my eyes, I'm glad tosee you. I haven't
fell in with anybody 1 was so glad to tee. I
have been thinking of you and tbe boys ever
since I have been to Congurt, (that's the way
Joe spells it.) Washington It a dull place
hate to stay there lively timet here want
to come back and live with tbe boys, whar I
can hare a good time. Old lellow, I tell you
I'm glad t j tee you again."
After some words, the man, a plain farmer,
invited Joe in, saying:
'General, you will stay to dinner, won't
yon?"
"Certainly, of course," said Joe. "I came
on purpose. I want some vituals lean eat.
This city vituals don't suit me. Your wile
can rook to suit me. I told Buchanan I
wouldn't give a d n for all their fcrrin gim
cracks. A good Oregon dinner of pork and
beans was worth all tbe French restaurants
conld get up and more too."
After a while dinner was put on tbe table.
It was, sure enough, Joe t favorite dish, pork
and beans. The pork was only tolerable; the
beans were very fine; at least, Joe taid se.
He crammed himself talked of the Mexican
war politics Joe Lane was very atten
tive to the women and children praised tbe
cooking took tome more pork and beans-
cooked to suit him exactly wanted the wife
of tbe house to give him some for need
wanted to take tome to Washington for Bu
chanan wanted to show them fellows what
good living was. He got a package put in
his saddle-bag? talked some more about the
Mexican war shook hands kissed the ba
bies took off his hat to madame took an
other horn of whisky and left.
He got to the next house; was just as glad
to see that man, and was Just as polite to that
woman juntas attentive to them children
took a little of that wbnky talked ot that
same Mexican war, and them tarn politics,
and tbut tame Joe Lane; bad thought of thit
man much and often at Washington; wanted
to get hack to tee tbem nil. Come on pur-
purpose to see tbit one, , Got Buchanan to
give him a package of a rare kind of beans
the unfit ever seen; brought them all the way
out especially for the mau'i wife to plant and
grow in the garden; then took tbem out; of
bis saddle-bags (the identical beans be got at
tlie last bouse;) the landlady was rejoiced; Joe
took auefher drink and left ,
' Unfortunately, Mrs. Smith cameover to tee
Mra. Jones the next day; talked of the newp;

The Coming Compromise.
' Suppose the North had, in the agony of
tne tA-compton struggle, wnen every aonora
lilii mind revolted at the monstrous Iniquity
of forcing a frandulcnt Constitution on a
protesting, struggling people a bill that
SenatorHammond (who voted for it through
out) bas tince said ought to be kicked out of
Congress declared that, if that bill were put
through, she would secede from the Union
does not everybody know that the threat
would have been nailed with a borse-langh
of dorision from the unanimous South? Why
should it always be hers to threaten, ourt to
concede?
Tne North has just won a tignal victory.
She made her issues fairly, presented tbem
clearly, went before the whole People upon
them, and, after a canvass ot unparalleled
earnestness and assiduity, elected her candi
dates. Tbe division ot her adversaries doubt
less aided to produce this result, but that is
not our business. We did not distract tbem
they distracted themselves. They fully
understood that their divisions gave us tho
election unless tbey healed tbem, and they
refused to heal thera. They practically con
spired to let us win; anfi now tbey propose
to break up tbe Union because we did win.
For Lincoln'! election in the immediate im
pulse to the threats of secession. The clamor
atiout Personal Liberty acts does not deceive
one of those who raise it Those acts have
existed for years, and bave amounted prac
tically to no more than to much waste paper.
The South bas laid little aud cared lest about
them. But Lincoln it choted President, and
all at once the cry it raised " Repeal your
Personal Liberty acta, or we will break np
the Union."
Vainly do we urge that these acts, If un
constitutional, can at any moment be upset
and dissipated by the Supreme Court, over
which tbe South bas absolute control; while,
if they be constitutional, tbe demand that
they be repealed It utterly unwarranted.
Tbe object is not so mnch to have them re
pealed, as to raise an Issue on wbicb the
North can be made to humiliate herself in
the eyet of the world. Jf. Y. Triiutu.
Is the Fugitive Stave Law Constitutional?
The best legal minds of the North believe
the Fugitive Slav Law to be unconstitution
al, First, because it violatei tbe right ot trial
by jury, and "luspendt" the privileges of the
writ of habeas eorpus, both common law and
constitutional rights; and secondly, because
it empowers United State Commissioner to
decide upon tbe liberty or tlavery of alleged
fugitives. Thit It a judicial question, and all
tuch questions are vested in the Courts by the
Constitution. They alone bave tbe right to
arbitrate and decide them. Tbe constitution
ality of the Fugitive Slave Law haa never
been judicially decided, and until it be, the
Northern people have a right to their doubt
upon th tubject Mr. Crittenden, it It true,
gav an opinion while Attorney General, in
favor ot its constitutionality. But tbit ba
no blndiug foroe. It doe not satisfy the pub

Letter from Springfield, Illinois.
We make the following extract Irom a let
ter from a correspondent at Springfield,
Illinois:
It seems that imaginative editors and cor
respondents are still saddling fanciful com
binations, purporting to reflect tbe complex
ion of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet opon the public
Let your own reudert be assured once more,
that, although the President is doubtlessly
already considering the names of persons in .

ha-e been brought to bear npon Mr. Lincoln
in tavor of the claims of sever.tl prominent
Western politicians to seats in tbe Cabinet
Edward Bates and Schuyler Colfax the let
ter for the Postmaster Generalship have
tcca preiecd with marked fervor. But tb
President remains altogether non-committal.
Mr. Lincoln,' like all of his friends, felt
greatly annoyed by the news of the alleged
renewal of civil war in Kansas. Tbe writer,
beiug personally acquainted with the charaos
ter of the originator of this stupendous impoj .
lition upon the publio Judge Williams
always contended that the trouble bad been
greatly exaggerated. Since tuch has turned
out to he the c ure, tbe President's fears have
given way to indignation at the audaciotti
falsifier. That old liar, William'i head will
