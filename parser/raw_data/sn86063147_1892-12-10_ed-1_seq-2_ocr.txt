Interesting people aro the rarest
in the world. Beople of intelligence,
morality, goodness—all manner of
admirable qualities—abound. but
those who have the magnetic spar*
of interest and charm be
counted on the fingers of one hand.
A well-known agricultural writer
estimates that good roads would save
the farmers of toe l uited Suites
SSOO. 000. 000 per year in the cost of
getting their produce to market, or
nearly $8 to each inhabitant of the
country, which is a fairer estimate
than to suppose the whole sum will
be divided among the farmers nlono.
Mmf. Adam, the Paris editress, says
that there is an emancipation of the
young women of France, caused by
their intercourse with English and
American visitors. They aro no longer
chaperoned on evory occasioa their
manners and customs have undergone
great changes, and they are Angli
cized and Amoricanlzed to a great
extent
The old saying that a man who is
h s own lawyer has a fool for a client
may boa little too sweeping. NN o
would not state the truth which it
contains in quite so harsh a form.
But is is ontirely within the bounds to
say that the claimant who tries to
look after his own claim instead of
having it prosecuted by a competent
attorney does not understand his owu
interesta
A resident of (hicago being dis
charged by his employer, was advised
at the samo timo to drown himself.
Ho promptly did this, his habit of
obedience having been too firmly
fixed to be swervod by a mere dis
charge. Now the widow thus created
sues the ex-employer for SSO. 000. for
being the promulgator of fatal advice.
This set of facts will afford justice an
opportunity to U6e her finest scales.
The growth Ot ipternational arbi
tration has hot been as rapid a3 tho
friends q[ peace were at one time
lyd lo hope. In spite of arguments
and practical examples tho l nited
States and Great Britain are almo-t
alone in their ndhosion to the princi
ple. The other nations still hold to
the stern and tested policy of getting
what they can by Individual bargain
ing. and lighting wliou they cannot
agree.
The state of luaho is acquiring a
reputation very rapidly. W ithin a
few weeks it has yielded up from Its
interior an opal field, a giant glacier,
a forest of petrified redwoods and
bones of extinct races of man and
beast. Meanwhile a party of prospect
has returned after three years in its
remote fastnesses laden to the point
of exhaustion with gold dust. A lit
tle further exploration it is hoped,
will disclose a race of plgmiea the
missing link and a lake of milk em
banked with honey.
Tin. advantages of arbitration are
easy to be understood, 'lo say
nothing of avoiding tho slaughter of
good productive citizens, the finan
cial advantages aro almost wholly on
the side of peace. Napoleon was a
master hand at robbery and believed
fully in the maxim of living off tho
enemy, yet in spite of all the money
raised by taxation in France and the
countries appropriated by Franco the
debt had increased from 714.000,000
francs to 1.272.000.000 francs at the
end of the fifteen years of Napoleon’s
government.
Mich wisdom has been expended
over the reported achievement of
Hannibal in making his way over tho
Alps by means of vinegar. It now
appears that the word vinegar was
wrong, the name properly at tho
present day applying to a sharp kind
of pickaxe that cuts something as
metaphorically very sharp vinegur is
sometimes said to do. But from this
ancient mistake in a word has grown
a common modern error. That is tho
idea that vinegar, heated or other
wise. will destroy rocks better than
water will da If the rock be partly
composed of lima the vinegar might
combine with the lime, and so dis
solve it. But when a fire is mode on
a rock to heat it. vinegar is no better
than water to turn or break it. Each
acts by tho expansive power of steam,
which moderns understand much bet
ter than was possible for the old
writers who have diseussed this cub
ject
