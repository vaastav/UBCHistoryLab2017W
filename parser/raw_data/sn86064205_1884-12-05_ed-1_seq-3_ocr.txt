Thero Is no surplus gold in the treas

upon Thero is no plethora of nnv

After giving tho subject careful con

conclusion that unless both tho coin

Is danger that silver and not gold

Tho treasury would bo relieved in a
measure from tho burden of tho silver

Regarding th quarantine of neat

Tho act making an appropriation for
the current year to establish and main
tain quaianttno stations and provide
proper shelter for and caro of neatcat
tlo Imported provides that tho same
be expended by tho commissioner of
agriculture under the general uper
vision of tho secretary of tho treasury
Heretoforo tho establishment aud
maintenance of such quarantine sta
tions was exclusively in obargo of this
department but under the foregoing
provision tho department of agricul
ture has entire control of tho whole
matter Including tho expenditure of
tbe appropriation subject only to tlie
supervision of this department as to
approving tho details of expenditure
and making general regulations gov
erning tho importation It Ib presumed
that the commissioner of agriculture

The proceedings of tho return of such
