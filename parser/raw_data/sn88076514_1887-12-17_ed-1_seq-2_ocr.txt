WASHINGTON.
The Late Message—Some Dakota
Items.
Spccial Correspondence of the
:8J,
Ister-Oceax.
Washington, Dec. 13.—The secoud
week of congress opens with a hopeful
ness on the part of the members, as well
as of their friends, that at least a portion
of the much needed legislation may be
•enacted. The fact cauuot be denied that
the Democratic party has lost a large
bag fall of harmony somewhere between
the white house and Philadelphia.
Cleveland seems glad of the loss, and
Randall declares that he don't care a
continental. Hon. P. H. Kelly, of Min
nesota, says: "The message of Cleve
land will iorce the nomination of
Blaine." The gentleman means to say
that Cleveland has deliberately taken
the free trade stand which his message
breathes for tho purpose of compelling
the Republicans to nominate Blaine,
who is the incarnation of all there is in
tho doctrine of protection. Republicans
generally will be willing to accept the
challenge. If Mr. Cleveland believes
that he can beat Blaine, let liim try it.
The Republican party has been query
ing whether or not the nomination of
Blaine would be a wise thing but, if wo
are challenged to a contest with Blaine
as our leader, orery Republican will say,
"Lay on, Mac Dull', and damned bo ho
who first cries, hold, enough." Col.
Plummer, of Dakota, tho eloquent ora
tor who accompanied Blaine on his trip
in
says: "Mr. Conkling will sup­
port the nominee of the Republican
party in '88,110 matter whether it shall
bo Blaine or not. Mr. Conkling would
have supported Jilaiiio in '81 but for
Hiking." That is about tho whole truth
of the matter, anyway. But to return
to the message. It is yet tho talk of the
town. The Democratic party cannot
harmonize on tho tariff—free trade idea.
The two wings cannot tlop together.
Hence, the Democrats of tho house and
sounto are all torn up uud disorganized.
The Republicans arc unanimous' and
harmonious in their approbation of the
message. .Nothing better could have
been written, for the benelil of tho Re
publican party. Mr. Carlisle, an ultra
free trader, has expressed regret for tho
open avowal of the doctrine by tho pres
ident. All sensible Democrats think
that it would have been better to have
handled the matter more gingerly.
Cleveland, alone, of all his party, has
the nerve to speak his true sentiments.
Wrong though he be, yet ho deserves
orortit for honest sincerity. He plays
fair.
First Assistant Postmaster (ienoral
Stevenson emphatically denies that ho
lias tried to secure tho defeat of Don.
Dickinson in tho sonato. On the con
trary, although the Illinois Democrats
felt outraged by the treatment accorded
to Stevenson, they were urged by that
gentleman to stand by tho president's
nomination. There is but littlo room to
doubt that Cleveland has repeated the
blunder of Arthur. In 18S3 when Post
master General IIowo died, it, was ex
pectod that Arthur would give tho posi
tion to First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Frank Hat ton. But instead of doing
tliat, he gave it to Gresliam and ever
afterwards regretted it. Ilatton was not
a boomer lor liimsolf. Ho had 110 presi
dential bee in his bonnet, and never will
have. He would have been loyal to
Arthur, and aided him in the matter of
re-nomination. But, Gresham started a
presidential boom for himself as soon as
ha got well under way in the department,
lie tried to fix Indiana for himself in
the national convention instead of work
ing it for Arthur. Consequently, the
state went for Ben Harrison, and finally
for Blaine. Jfow, Mr. Cleveland will
soon find that Don. Dickinson will be
trying to start a little boom for himself.
Instead of helping Cle veland, he will in
jure him. But, if Bicvenson had been
nominated, it would liavo cncouraged
the Democracy of Illinois and stimu
lated to greater activity. Since t!i"
death of Logan, some of the best politi
cal judges consider Illinois a doubtful
state, fcitovonson's advancement to tho
postmaster generalship would have
strengthened tho faithful out tliero.
However, it is done, and Cleveland's
mistake will appoar as the days go bv.
Hon. P. IT. Kelly, of Minnesota, says
that Phil Armour has doclared himself
to bo for Cleveland. Mr. Kelly believes
that Illinois i* a Democratic state and
should be carried for the administration.
I tut, Mr. Cleveland has an insane idea
that he can carry Michigan and Wiscon
sin. Heuce, he is coddling Vilas and
Dickinson. Ho can no moro carry a
uorthwostern state than the deyll can
carry his soul to heaven and succeod in
entering the securely tiled gates which
are guarded by Saint Peter and his sleep
less assistants.
Probably the gonllemen who live in
Pierre, well nigh two thousand ratios
from Washington, could dcscribo the
doings of tho Dakota contingent better
than I can, although right here on the
ground. Tho two faithful "Macs, of
Pierre'' who worked together for two
years for the passage of the Dawes bill,
know all the ins and outs of tho way
things are done in such matters. Dele
gate Gilford, Hon. John J, Kloiner, Hon.
John II. King, Judge Offonbaclier and
ex-Governor Orilway are working for
the opening of the Sioux reservation.
They are accomplishing only this at
present thoy are presenting their case
before the new members of congress,
That unique and sui generis cuss, "John
Smith," has bnsiness which takos him
to tho capltol daily, and he, too, is talk
ing to the-fresh solons about the matter.
John knows something ot it, and carries
a map with him which he displays and
compels the fellows to look at. Some of
them seem to have a vague idea that
there is a territory somewhere out west,
called Dakota, and they are willing to
give the woolly country a littlo consider
ation, if they have time. Before congress
has been here a full month tho members
will all have heard of the territory and,
moreover, they will have reached the
conclusion that she is the biggest thing
out of doors. and that they must take
time to consider liar rights and her needs.
They will be compelled to hear Dakota
talk daily, and nightly, too, until action
is talten. This is all that is really being
accomplished, to date. It is preliminary
talk but absolutely necessary talk. I
believe that it is safe to say that allot the
members from Minnesota, of both par
ties, are now ready to take a hand in the
matter and assist us in spreading the
story of Dakota's wrongs before the peo
ple's representatives. Ex-Representa
tive Kleiner makes a strong point, and
does it eloquently, when he relates his
experiences in traveling from Pierre to
Deadwood. He delineates all of the
details of the journey ofa thousand miles
east, south and then west when, with an
open reservation he could have gone 120
miles, accomplishing the journey in a
few hours. He also tells of the coal in the
Hills, almost at the doors of the people
along the river and the fact that they
are obliged to sell two bushels of wheat
to buy oue bushel of coal, to keey them
from freezing in the winter when, if the
reservation were open coal would be
cheaper than wheat. Those are but out
lines of the many things which are lw
ing said by gentlemen who are working
for the bill. Let it bo understood, to
his credit, that X. G. Ordway is doing
good work for this measure, too. I do
not oxpect toboablo to give you any defi
nite, good news,until after tho holidays,
but you shall know what is going on, all
the time.
Daisy.
Ho stood in
the field one
morning, away
from tho broad
high road, and
he camo in
search of dai­
sies for 11 bouquet 1 la mode,. He had
promised a youthful maiden to gather
them sweet and full, and perchance lie
might have done so except for a farmer's
bull, which suddenly camo upon him
whilo lie warblod a lovelone lay, and
without so much as a single thought he
made for the broad highway ho did his
best as a runner, and jumped with a
quicken'd sense, but in spite of sneed or
agility, lie was hoisted over tho fence.
He was torn by briar and bramble,he was

St. Jacobs Oil was well rubbed on, and
his former self regained. Ho betook
himself to his lady fair to offer a ready

said, "You're daisy onougli for me."

Qrondel King Here.
A Braiuerd dispatch says: A singular
incident is revealed concerning one of
the parties of engineers that the Mani
toba company have just disbanded here,
and tho identities of two certain mem
bers of the party. Those are Mr. Qron
del, the transit tnau, and the head chain
man, Harold Ve Greuse, pronounced
FeeGreeso. The two joined tho party
as companions, and are Swedes. They
were inseperable companions, and yet
would be hardly two minutes together
until into a war of words. Yet they
seemed to roally think everything of
each other. It became apparent after
awhile that tho friction invariably arose
at one or the other giving anything like
an order to the other. Harold was the
younger, and Groudel was his superior,
by virtue of his position as transit man
If the engineer, who seemed confirmed
in tho haaitof eating large heaps of sugar
011 his Boston beans, said to Harold
"Pass the sugar," the latter wouldn't do
it. Being questioned, Harold said that
"(inly poasants ate sugar on greasy fond
and "Groudel in tho old country would
not daro to coniiniuut 1110 at all." Then
both asjrecd to the following explana
tion: The father of Harold Vo Greuse
was of royal descent, and in tho emer
gency of a certain numbor of deaths
would iiayo become king of Sweden.
Groudel is of subordinate extraction. At
home Vo Greuse would bo master and
Grondol servant. ltutGrondel, by push
ing at school, educated himself and be
came an engineer, while his possible
king and master is not yot so far ad
vanced. And thus very naturally every
thing like a command from the peasant
fell harshly on tho ears of "tho king."

A Huge Fraud.
Turtle Maintain Tiinci.
The Democratic obstructionist politi
cians who arc responsible for the calling
of the Aberdeen convention to ask for
statehood for tkota have perpetrated
a most damnable fraud upon the peo
ple in the manner of the "call." It ii
publicly announced that the call is the
result of a spontaneous uprising of the
people, and it is given out cold that it is
signed by the leading men of every
county in the territory. The call—with
the names of the signers attached—was
sent out only to the faithful in this part
of the country, but the Times saw
one of them this week, Curious to see
who were Rolette county's "leading
tnen," we found them to be "II. Ellek
son, M. Munson, J. L. Harvey, John
Johnson and S. A. Nye." The latter is
the editor of the Churchs Ferry Sun, a
strong divisionist, a resident of Ramsey
county, nnd repudiates this outrage in
the-strongest terms the others ure not
only not residents of Rnlette, but the
names are palpably fictitious. In Bot
tineau the names of J. W. Bennett, V.
B. Noble, with three fictitious ones ap
pear on tho call and so it goes all over
the territory. It is a fitting illustration
of the political tactics of the managers
of the one-state convention, and stamps
FRAUD in glaring colors all over the
movement. It is conceived simply to
counteract the movement for diyision,
and, like the reputations of its inceptors,
fairly stinks with corruption. It may
aid in the temporary defeat of the
division movement, but in the years to
come it will be remembered, and an in
dignant and outraged public sentiment
will administer justice.

If you were unable to wash your own
face and comb your own hair, and were
obliged to depend on your wife or your
hired man to attend to these matters
for you, and should they, in doing it,
take pleasure in splashing the soapsuds
into your eyes and bearing down with a
vengeance on the comb, do you for a
moment thins that such work would
have the effect of making you more
gentle in your manners and give you a
better temper? Do you think you would
love them more tenderly for a half
hour's torture of this kind? Would you
want them to use the sharpest comb they
could find in order to irritate the scalp
and invigorate the hair? Your answer
to all the above questions may be in
the negative, und yet you may be one
among the many of our farmers who
•ubject their horses to similar treat
ment every day, and imagine that they
are doing their duty. The cause of vici
ous dispositions in horses can be traced
to rough treatment in grooming. The
sharper the currycomb the better, is the
idea of many, and the harder you bear
on the better the result, no matter how
the poor horse kicks and squirms and
tries to evade it. A few groomings of
this kind, if grooming it can be called,
and horses dread the operation as they
do a whipping. If they have good
horse sense they soon learn to repel such
treatment, and in so doing form vicious
and unplesant habits that make them
unplesant to handle and detract from
their value.

THE IJSTTEROCEAJST.
THE CITY OF NANTES.
PEOPLE WHOSE COSTUMES ARE
OF ECCENTRIC DESCRIPTION.
Hefuge from the Artificial Life at the
French Capital—A Homelike Meal at a
Hotel—Principal Business Street—A
Royalist's Opinion of the City
Nantes takes a certain character from
the sea, from the fishermen and from all
the queer types of humanity who dwell
along the coast of this department and of
Morbihan well on up toward Brest. The
costumes of these people are of the most
occentric description, so much so that it is
said that nowhere else in France can there
be seen such a variety. Some are strik
ingly picturesque. There is the peasant
woman, for instance, whose business it is
to cultivate early potatoes in the sand
near Noirmoutier and bring them to mar
ket. She wears a skirt coming just below
the knees, a small cap, some sort of apron,
checked cr otherwise, and has the
foot, ankle and calf entirely exposed, or
shoes or sabots neatly polished and stock
ings closely fitting and often of intricate
puttern. The shoes and hosiery are their
special weakness, and it is not rare to see
among them a well made foot and ankle.
The entire costume is commonly in sober
colors and neatly kept. On the contrary,
yon see little girls with long skirts com
ing to the soles of the shoe, wlioJpok as if
they had just stepped from on™of Van
dyke's portraits.
As a specimen of the male costume of
Morbihan, we have the low crowned,
round topped hat of velvet, or of straw or
felt bound with velvet, very jaunty, or,
as the French would say, chic. The
Jacket is something like the voluminous
exterior garment of our ancestors of the
Seventeenth century, but a jacket all the
same, and gay with rows of buttons so
thickly set that they overlap one an
other. The collar of the shirt is as broad
a ship's mainsail. It is open in front
and rises stiffly up behind the head, serv
ing as a background to a face that is tho
picture of innocence and as quaint as the
costume itself.
It is a pleasant relief to get away from
the highly artificial life and the highly ar
tificial articles of food and drink at Paris
even to a stupid and not over cleanly place
like Nantes. The country offers its treas
ures more generously than the city. It is
pleasant to know that the wines, if they
are not Clos Vougeot, Pomard, Chateau
Leflte or Chateau Yquen, are at least all
they pretend to be that you are near the
place where people produce their own but
ter and lay their own eggs where they
even put the butter on the table and sell
their milk at four cents a quart from the
wagons in the street and at the corner
groceries. It is really with a homelike
feeling that you sit down to breakfast or
dinner in a hotel in a town in Anjou, or
at the hotel at Nantes on which I be
stowed my humble patronage. The still
ness that pervades tho dining room is sol
emn. You hear two or three flies buzzing
behind the laco curtains that drape the
windows. You look up to the ceiling not
painted by Michael Angelo, but by some
unimraortalized local fresco painter, in
imitation of tlie sky. You don't remem
ber ever to have seen exactly such shades
of blue in the firmament before. But no
matter. The chandeliers are attached to
the ceiling with blue ribbons painted fiat
thereon, the ends drawn out sideways and
held in the beaks of doves, the species
and the school of art being alike unfa
miliar.
Into the room steal furtively from timo
to time representatives of tho Nantals
bourgeoise—solid, solemn, funereal—who
tranquilly partake of the several courses
and then steal away as stealthily as they
entered. Perhaps tliero enters a whole
Breton family father, mother, sons,
daughters and bonne—all of whom make
the sign of the cross before taking their
places. Their dress is quiet and tlieir
manners almost as reverential as if they
were in church. The repast is served by
the mature garcons—one gray haired
whom you seem faintly to recollect as
having seen in the opera of "Tho Hugue
nots." Their duty is performeddecorously
and entirely in keeping with the sur
roundings. There is none of bewardage
so often seen at French tables. The
cuisine is rather remarkable for its pro
fusion than its fine quality, thus reversing
the Parisian rule. Some dishes are even
left on the table where persons can help
themselves. Nothing could be moro
un-Parisian. The butter is of a char
acter to attract attention. There are
perhaps twenty persons at table (com
paratively few persons come to Nantes)
and thero are four rolls of golden
butter distributed along tho table,
each weighing at least a pound, and, like
everything else offered you, it is "a discre
tion." Then you drink, if you are dis
posed, a whole bottle of white or red wine.
The hotel is, I believe, the best in Nantes,
and your breakfast and dinner cost you
together only five francs a day, while a
good room costs only three francs more.
In coming from Cholet to Nantes I made
tho acquaintance of a young lawyer of
Poitiers, a royalist by birth aud political
preference and a most charming and in
telligent traveling companion. Ho said to
me, "Nantes is a villo de luxe." As I
have already remarked, this is not inti
mated to the stranger. There is nothing
in the houses or shops that would indicate
it. Then as I met him in the evening he
conducted me through what he said was
the principal business street—tlie only
business street in fact—a thoroughfare
narrow and crooked like the rest., half a
mile in length and having on either side
commonplace shops, badly lighted and
with poor displays of goods in the win
dows. There were no carriages, but it
was filled with a crowd of promenaders
walking purposely to and fro nnd look
ing listlessly into tho uninteresting
windows, as I have seen them in
the smaller towns of Italy or else
where in Europe. Thero was nowhere
else to go, theatres being closed and sum
mer amusements conspicuous by their
absence. The rich were at the watering
places the poor were amusing themselves
in low drinking houses, such as are seen
in the pictures of Temers and Steen, of
types that are universal and have been for
800 years.
There are, however, at Nantes things
that are solid, substantial and elegant in
the way of art and architecture. The
cathedral and other churches arc among
the finest in France, and there are statues
of kings and other celebrities in them, or
here nnd there in avenues and streets
about the city. There is a library of 100,
000 volumes, and the museum of paint
ings and statuary, the finest in Franco
outside of Paris and Versailles. It is well
worth a visit. I went to the castle, which
is not so massive and interesting as that
at Angers, and better preserved, and from
the top of the dungeon tower the concierge
pointed out to me that great place of the
famous noyades, oneot the most infamous
reminiscences of the revolution.—Albert
Satliffo in San Francisco Chronicle.

An Ast nialied Senator.
Chicago News Washington Special.
Two carloads of twenty-one fresh re
porters were sent here this morning
from New York to interview all the
members of congress on the president's
message for the New York World. Af
ter breakfast tliey started for the capitol,
with note-books and pencils in their
hands and a number of set questions
which had been prepared for their guid
ance, and attacked every man they met.
One young fellow met Senator Gorman
in the capitol corridor, and taking him
to be a man of prominence addressed
him. The following unique conversa
tion then took place:
"What is your name, please?"
The senator calmly replied: "Arthur
P. Gorman."
"Are you a member of congress?"
For once in his life the senator was
taken by surprise, but calmly answered:
'Yes, sir."
"Do you belong to the senate or the
house of representatives?"
"To the senate," was tlie reply.
"What state are you from
Mr. Gorman leaned against a pillar
for support and gasped: "Maryland."
"What are your politics?"
Then Mr. Gorman's knees began to
tremble. "I am a Democrat," he man
aged to murmur.
Are you in favor of the administra
tion?"
This remarkable inquiry had a brac
ing effect on the senator. Straighten
ing himself up to lus full height he
asked: "Young mail, what

are you asking me those questions
for?"
"I am Interviewing you," was the re

Good Reasons.
The Caudo Tribune objects to the
Aberdeen scheme on the following
grounds: First, that it is anonymous
second, the manner in which the 500
names appended to the call were ob
tained. For instance, those from Tow
ner are: A. B. McDonald. J. W. Hardy,
J. Church, 12. F. Sibley, P. A. Giinsritli.
J. Church and P. A. Gunseith are un
known to the oldest inhabitant. "Hardy
don't spell his name in that way Sib
ley' has never signed any such call.
These names were probably picked up
from some directory, and appended
without the knowledge or the consent of
the parties. Tlie most, if not all of the
other 500 names were undoubtedly ob

The president having taken «o pro
nounced a stand upon the tariff ques
tion, especially in reference to the du
ties on wool, very vigorous criticism of
his attitude has naturally been looked
for. Such criticism has already come
from the wool-growers, who, at the ses
sion of their national conference, heklat
Washington on Wednesday last, adopted
unanimously a declaration strongly con
demning the president's recommenda
tions affecting their interests. These
recommendations, thoy declare, amount
to a direct attack upon their industry.
They declare themselves greatly alarmed
at the president's action. Undoubtedly
the wool interest will be heard from in
the debates upon the tariff question
which the present session *f congress
seems to promise.
