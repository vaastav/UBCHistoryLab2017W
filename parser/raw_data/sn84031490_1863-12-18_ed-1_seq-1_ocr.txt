FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18,1883.
TOG KEWS.
Although one of the minor items of the
■war in iUelf considered, still from all at
tendant circumstance the public will bail
with large satisfaction, tbe news of tbe re
■capture of tbe steamer Cbespcake, of the
New York and Portland line, recently cap
tured with atrocious piracy and murder by
a squad of rebels who went on board at
New Yoik, as passengers. She has bad a
short run in her evil cruises, and las been
captured in a harbor of Nova Scotia, the
"Provincial Government giving the buccan
eers neither countenance nor safe retreat
If these pirates have fallen into our hands
let them meet a pirate’s doom, and string
at tbe yard arm.
The news from "Wariiington is interest
ing. Tbe President has sent in a message
pressing tbe chums of the great, suffering
army of freedmen upon Congress. These
poor people must he succored, and that
without delay.
In the Senate, yesterday, Mr. Hole, in a
■case of personal explanation, called up
an interesting and important matter, as
to how far the relations of a Sen
ator to the pnblic trammed and restrict
the exercise of his private fan Cliins
as a lawyer. The answer is easy. The of
fices of the lawyer may be hired, those of
the Senator cannothonorably be. To fix the
line of demarcation between the two rela
tions is the question. If the lawyer is
worth more to his client heeauee he tea Sen
ator, and is employed in a case where the
Government is concerned, it will depend
much upon the nicety of Senatorial delica
cy to know where to decline rendering
si cli service. Uit was the htdp of Senator
Dale that was desired by tbe parties in tbe
Old Capitol Prison, the gentleman from
New Hampshire was indiscreet in hiyacL
If it was the plain lawyer that was requir
ed, and no other functions exercised, who
shall deny to Senators the right to exercise
their vocations?
We regret if any reader of the Tm
duke was misled by an error of tbe types
yesterday, and really believed as stated
in our Washington dispatch, - that Hr.
Blair of Missouri addressed the Union
League, and made an out and out Imme
diate Emancipation, anti-Gamble, anti-
Schofield speech. It was Hon. Henry T.
Blow of SL Louis, who made the address
referred to.. But if it is ever given to
Prank Bluir to confess his political sins,
end cast up his political errors, that is
sibout the way be will talk. But to expect
it of bim now, is to forget be is a Blair, and
Frai k Blair at that
Gen. Hurlbut, at Memphis, has issued
an erder which will send pallor and tremb
ling*through the ranks of the money chan
gers, and put an end to the flux of gold
southward.
From Tennessee we give an interesting
variety of news. Tbe Chattanooga letter
copied from the Cincinnati Commercials
gives late and saddening news from our
hospitals, wiili a lengthy list of recent
deaths.
The rebel Treasurer, Memmlngcr, raps
a doleful tune on lias empty cash box. We
irivo liig doleful balance ohcct filcowhcrn.
And here is what the great rebel note man
ufacturer gives in conclusion of the whole
matter;
The continuance of the notes as a circulating
medium to their present extent involves the rain
of public and private credit, and will deprive the
Government of the means of defending the lives
and propci tycf Us citizens. If the currency re
mains in the present expanded state, no measure
of relief can be made effectual. Prices must ad
vance, and (be means of the Government to pay
prices mast daily lose efficiency. TVtx&fc
<cmt ft ulfft-f#, by reaeon of the depredation of the
money. The army can neither lepaid, dottednor
fed; artr.e ord tr.tmitlone (f tear eon no longer be
jntjgAied ; the oficere of the Government cannotM
n/ppcrlsd j an n the countrt otst success.
"Well, let her succumb, and turn her lank
face to the wall and die, unwept, unhoa
ored and unsung, save in such notes as
TCcjr.minger’s,
SuEiJiiE Impudence.— As the fortunes of
the btccfch organ wane at the South, it has li
ken upon itself the regulation of the tele
graph lines at the North, and is constantly
pouring out the vials of Us wrath upon Mr.
Sweet because he would not become a party
*o its base conspiracy to deprive the other
city impere, and therefore the community, of
ibe President's message. Now, we ask, by
wl.at tight these infamous hounds dictate to
the Western telegraph linos what shall and
what shall not pass over their wires? The
Western line did only and precisely what the
Eastern lines were about to do when legally
required to do it. The message would have
been sent us from Cleveland had It not com
menced coming from Springfield. Had both
lines refused to scud it, wc should have im
mediately sued them for summary damages,
;uul the managers knew that the courts would
Lave awarded them. The organ may blurt
out its venom till dooms-day before Judge
Cuton will remove a man for simply doing
his duty Again, we ask, why don’t the
ir. ilor organ abuic Cobh because his line
promptly absented ? The public begin to be
Interested in tht why? Wc can ask another
fci smith ant question, but for the present for
bear. «

[Correspondence Cincinnati Commercial.]
Chattakoooa, Dec. 10,1355.'
The rain that for two days has dclngcd the
town and swollen the river, has ceased, and
to-day the finn is shining.
The work on the defenses of the “ Valley
City," which received a temporary chock, has
been renewed, and details from all the regi
ments have been formed into “pick” and
“shovel” brigades. Already the change in
the appearance of the town is quite visible,
and when all has been completed that has
been laid out, I question whether tbe natives
of the place will be able to see any resem
blance between the quiet little Chattanooga
of 18G0, as it nestled between the grey bluffs
of Lookout, and the Chattanooga of to-dar,
with its dilapidated booses, well-beaten
streets and gardens, uprooted trees, and blue
coated inhabitants, smoky atmosphere, and
bristling fortifications. ; -
MOSTAXJTT TS THE HOSPITALS.
Tbe mortality in the hospitals ia the town
!s very large. Ido not know the exact num
ber of the wounded and.eisk in the hospitals,
bnt I find, on examining the register, that
since the opening of tbe hospital cemetery,
November 23, there have been interred 247
who have died of wounds and diseases in the
last seventeen days. The total number in
terred, including those killed in action, is 405.
This docs not include those killed at Chatta
nooga, and buried on the field, and in other
hospitals. Nearly all of these, or fully 235 of
the 247, have died of wounds received in the
lute battle. When wc add to thesethoso who
have died in Sherman's and Hooker's com
mands, the number of deaths will be largely
increased.
Physicians tell me that there ore a largo
number of cases of gangrene in the hospitals,
from which disease many of the above num
ber have died. . Tbe Smgcons, I observe, arc
doingfaUin their power Tor the wounded and
sick. Below Is a list of all who have died in
hospital since November 33, as registered in
Ibc books of the post Quartermaster. The
bodies of eleven have been sent north; the
balance arc buried here.

DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING TO THE FRONT.
Until a few days ago passenger cars were
run between Nashville and Stevenson, Ala.;
bat so great is ihe tax upon the transporting
facilities of the rood, that the Government
has found it absolutely necessary to take off
the passenger care, and passengers are now
compelled to ride on the outside of freight
cars. No females are permitted to visit the
front under any circumstances. This is a sc#
rious annoyance to the wives of sick soldiers,
. who wish to comfort and cheer their brave
husbands, bat the necessities of the service
demand it. An exception, however, is made
in Ihe case of Mrs. Harris, agent of the Phil
adelphia ladies’ Aid Society, and Mrs. Wil
kinson, agent of the Milwaukee Aid Society,
both, of whom arc here doing all in their
power for the sick and wounded. They are
noble women, performing a noble work.
The following are the principal clauses of
“General Orders, No. 7,” issued by order of
General Grant:
M l. It being the design of the General command
Ing the Department to occupy Chattanooga exdn
duslvcly for military purposes, no encouragement
will be given to traders, cranny followers who

this class of persons will met be tolerated at this
post. v
*‘i No permits will be granted at these head*
quarters, and none will be recognized, unless ap
proved br the chief of stag; of the General com
manding the Department.
“5. All resident citizens who desire to remain in
Ohattanoaga are required to register their names
with the post Provost Marshal, and to swear alls-’
glance to the Government of the United States,
end, if required by the Provost Marshal, to enter
into bonds with approved sureties. In the penal
sum of <?10,U0O) ten thousand dollars, conditioned
for the faithful keeping of the oath of allegiance,
under any and all circumstances.
**6. All able-bodied male citizens not already
employed by the government, or who hare not per
mits from department headquarters to follow their
accustomed business, arc required to report them
selves to the post quartermaster, *who is author
ized tocivc them employment at reasonable wages.
“7. After ten days from the date of the luanfrm
of this order, the Provost Marshal will cause all
citizens who nave not complied with the two* pre
ceding parasraphs to be removed to finch point as
the General commanding the Department may
direct, 11
Sutlers arc restricted to the districts to
which they arc assigned. Citizens visiting
Chattanooga have to report to headquarters,
state nj>on whose authority and why they
come, and how long it will take them to
transact their business. Soldiers and officers
ore not permitted In the city without posses
and the city counlcrelgn.

Undoubtedly tfther accidents have occurred,
as no vessel however staunch could ride such
a gale.

Washington. Dec. 17.—The bill reported
back from the senate's Committee on Mili
tary Affairs, with amendments, reduces the
proposed bounty for enlistment of veterans
to SIOO, and of others to $lO, and Includes
those only who arc not now In tbe service.
Senator 'Wilson's amendment to the Con
scription bill exempts the following persons:
Such as are mentally and physically unfit for
service; the Vice President of the United
States; tbe Judges of the various Courts of’
the United States; the heads of the various
Executive Departments of the United States;
the Governors of the several States; the only
ton, liable to military duty, of a widow
wholly dependent on his labor for support;
the only son #f an aged or infirm parent or.
parents wholly dependent on bis labor for
support; and in case there arc several sous,
all drafted, such parent or parents may elect
which son shall be exempt; the only brother
of orphan children under twelve years old,

is abolished. A person enrolled, moving to
another "locality, may have his name taken
from the list and placed upon the enrollment
in the place of his residence. Any person
enrolled who shall procure a substitute shall
be exempt.
The probabilities decidedly are that Con
gress will repeal the S3OO clause of the En
rt limcnl tot. The ililitary Committee of the
Senate are believed to be in favor of doing
so,*and it Is not unlikely they will attach a
section to that effect,' amendatory to the bill
introduced by Senator Wilson.

FROM CLEVELAND,
(Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
Cleveland, Ohio, Dec. 17,1862.
The National Convention of United States
Assessors held its second session to-day, the
time being entirely engrossed in the hearing
and discussing of reports of standing com
mittees. Four reports were finally acted
upon, relating to the following schemes: In
come railroads, steamboats, &c.; equaliza
tion of assessments; inspectors of spirits,
and compensation of Assessors. These re
ports are too elaborate for telegraphing.
The committee , upon that portion of the
law including spirits, ale and porter, will
recommend thefoUomng amendments in re
lation thereto: A tax on hops of five cents
per pound; a tax on malt liquors of sixty
cents per barrel, conditioned that the tax on
malt be thirty cents per bushel, and that the
use of substitutes for malt, in the production
of liquors sold as pure malt liquors, shall be
made, a penal o{Tense; that the tax on dis
tilled spirits be sixty cents per gallon from
March Ist to July Ist, 18C4; from July Ist to
November Ist, 18W, a tax of seventy-five
cents per gallon, and from and after the latter
date one dollar per gallon.
The report on auction soles, slaughtered
hogs, cattle, ifcc., will be of great interest, as
well also as. that upon manufactures.
. The committee will hardly conclude its
business before noon to-morrow, though it
is in session to-night with a view to finishing
np. The members had a merry-making at
the Angler this evening. The greatest har
mony has so far prevailed, and business has
been pushed with all possible dispatch.

We have Information that a detachment of

■Washington, Dec. 17.—0n Monday night,
Moscby, with a gang of ninety guerillas, made
a descent on the picket lines outside of tho
defenses south of the Potomac, but without
effecting any serious damage. Our cavalry
were sent in pursuit, , .
An absurd rumor Is circulating throughout
the dty that Moscby was in town on Tuesday
afternoon. The military authorities have
been on a sharp lookout for the guerilla, but
without success.
It is reported at the navy yard that the
rebels, a tew dayc since, opened with field
pieces on our gunboats in the mouth of the
Rappahannock, ond after firing
a few shots in return, hauled otf Into the

FROM THE SOUTH.
Fortress Monroe, Dec. 16.—The Rich
mond Whin, in an editorial, says:
The Atlanta Confederacy. asserts that ohr
cavalry advanced on the 10th above Ringgold,
finding it clear of the enemy. They proceed
ed thence to Lookout Mountain and Mission
ary Ridge. Here they found nothing but
dicria of the enemy’s enrop. The position
seemed to have been deserted on Saturday
last. In the town of Chattanooga aud be
below (he enemy Lad visibly decreased his
force. The presumption is that a heavy col
umn Ims gone aflcrLongstrcci, and that .an
expedition lias started into West Tennessee to
look after Forrest, who has taken advantage
of the absence of Sherman’s Corps.
The Whig also rays: Although there ap

AvcriH from the Kanhawa,in the direction of
East Tennessee and Virginia, iho War De

PROCEEDINGS CF COHQRESS.
Mr.ITAJ.E,of Kcwlininphire.rosc to a privi
leged question. He desired to send to the
Clerk's desk, to be read, a new ajmper-para
graph, charging ■with bijbcry a Senator from
New England, in securing the release for the
sum of £;'’,OCO ottwo jmfoners from the old
capUcl. Yrom information received from a
Senator, he was l?d to believe that he (Hale)
was the person Minded to. He wished to make
a statement of facts on which the charge
was based. Mr. Hale then at some length
explained that he had acted as counsel "for
these persons, and that previous to doing so
he had asked the advice of Hon. Reverdy
Johnson, and others, if te could consistently
with his position as U, S. Senator, act as the
legal adviser of the above mentioned parties.
He was assured, he could, and that there ex
isted no reason why he should not. Hon.
.Hcverfly .Johnson stated to him that he was
himself engaged in such eases almost daily.
Under these circumstances he had acted for
the prisoners. He (Hate) then stated the
facts of the ease, md concluded by saying, if
there was bribery, or even indelicacy, it was
not done inadvertently but advisedly* and with
cautions deliberation.
Mr. JOHNSON of MJ., remarked that he
recollected distinctly that Mri Hale called on
him as stated, and reported .the conversation
materially as stated In answer to his (Hale's)
inquiry whether a Senator was precluded
from acting as counsel for a person charged
before a cohrtmartial with fraud. He (Jonn
sou) said be eatr-no legal impediments in
the way, or even' indelicacy. What he
(Bale! had done was no donbt‘done in conse
quence of this opinion. Senators do not
cease to be lawyers if called upon for pro
fessional services. He saw ho difficulty in
eomplyirg unless the services involved the
neglect cf public duties. He(Johnson) hadre
rcatedlyactcd himself upon thisassuraptica.
The only question that can arise Is, Is there
any law prohibiting- it? There was a law
prohibiting Senators fromproseenting claims
against the Government before the Court of
Claims. ! He believed that some law express-,
ly excepted eases pending before the Courts.
One ha-* a right to go before any other Court
in the Unlteu States. It was. not the inten
tion of.the law to prevent a lawyer prac
ticing in his -profession. If a case of fraud
in contracts is brought before a militair
Court, a lawyer, whoso services.are desired,
has no right, because he is a member of Con
gress, to refuse his services any more than
He would in a capital case in the civil Court
Mr. HALE'snbmitted the following resolu
tion, which was agreed to:
That .the Committee on Judiciary be

Uanlr*’ Return—Aspects** of
A fisiirs*—Unionism In Texas,
&«?., Ace.
Gtn. Banks’ return to this city, though ex
pected in military circles, took outsiders by
surprise. At the left, and as soon as
it was announced tlmthe was 'on the Texas
coast, there was that he would
remain there and finish np the campaign in
person. The object of the campaign was
really the seizure of the mouth of t£o
Rio Grande, and the occupation of Browns
ville. That being accomplished there was
no occasion for the General-in-Chief to re
main there, and he returned to the principal
point of his Department. His subordinates
that be left behind have carried out ths work
by the capture of Corpus Christ!, and more
of Fort Espcranza. These two
points give us control of the Texas coast
from the Rio Grande to the Colorado River.
The region thus fallen into our hands Is of
more importance than- would at first bo im
agined.' The control of Matagorda Bay
gives, us, a .region that is one of the
richest portions of Texas and the most
productive* of cotton. It is reported
tb?t the rebels hare recently gathered large
quantities ornohnn nn the..shores of .Mata
gorda, being in anlicipatloffbf the udvcnt~of
some light draught, blockade runners from
Nassau. Our approach to that region was’
so sudden that they could nut have had time
to remove iti and the whole lot has probably
fallen into our hands. Being gathered there
with u design of running the blockade, its
owners will be unable to save it from con
fiscation. It will go far towards defraying
the expenses of the Texas Expedition, as well
as striking a severe blow at the Illicit trade
alongthc Texas coast. The rebel army in the
Southwest will find itself sadly straitened for
wont of everything that is not indigenous to
the soil. Thu route through the’Rio Grande,
as well as the points on the coast,
have hitherto been available for all
their wants. • Nearly all the ammunition
. used by the rebels in the Southwest comes
from abroad. There arc no manufactories
of arms in the country west of the Mississip
pi, and but two or three points where ammu
nition is prepared. For this all the powder
must bo imported, as there Is no manufacto
ry of that precious article. Saltpetre is lack
ing and cannot be procured.
Matagorda Bay is second only to Galves
ton In importance, and on some accounts is
superior to it. The occupation of Galveston
would admit us at once into the railway sys
tem of Texas; but this, is by. no means of
great extent Unless the signs fail, Galves
ton and Austin will soon our hands,and
it will not be long after their capture, before
Sabine Pass comes Into onr possession.
When these things arc accomplished,
wo shall have Texas pretty
thoroughly in onr control. The interior
portion is not very valuable to us, except in
so far as the population is concerned. We
shall probably send a small command through
the northern or central portion, os a nucleus
‘lor the loyal .people of that locality to rally
around. It is in,that section that a consider
able number of German emigrants settled,
several years ago, and had built up quite a
prosperous community. When the wap
broke out they at flrJt refused to take pari in
it, and held ont as long as possible.
I am told by an officer of Gen. Banks’ staff,
that there are now two or three thousand
Germans at a point of considerable distance
up the Rio Grande. When the war broke ont
they, fled thither to escape the persecution of
the rebel leaders. They determined that
they would not be dragged Into the war under
any consideration'except to fight for them
selves if too much oppressed. Theygathered
whatever arms they could, and formed a mil
itary organization. Halting on the bank of
the Rio Grande, they formed a settlement and
prepared to defend themselves. In case of
attack, they were determined to fight as long
as possible, and in the event of a defeat, to
crqss the stream into Mexican territory,
where they could not be pursued. The reb
els have not thought proper to send a force
to attack* them, and the Germans arc
said to be there at the present time,
in security. Before this date they have been
reached by a detachment that went thither
from Gen. Banks’ command at Brownsville.
I am informed that these men have expressed
a desire to fall in under onr flag in an organi
zation for service in Texas. Many - parties
are. confident that wo can raise enough men
In this way to take care of the State agains
everything but the regular forces of Kirby
Smith.

rTHE TRIBUN'E FOB 1864.
A PHOSPECTUS.
THE HEW YORK TRIBUNE, flrst Issued April !•.
IWI, has to-day a larger aggregate circulation than
any other newspaper published In America, or (we
believt) Id the world. Compelled a year since to in
crease the price of Its sorer*! issue?, or submit to the
pecuniary min of Its proprietors from the rcry mag*
aitnde of its circulation. It haa probably since parted
with some patrons to whom its remarkable cheapness
was a controlling recommendation; bnt others hare
taken their places; and It boa. now more than Two
Hundred Thousand subscribers and regular pur*
chasers—an excess of at least Fifty Thousand orer
these of any rival. And this unprecedented currency
Ithasachlered byrery liberal expenditures In pro*
curing early and authentic intelligence, by the fear*
less expression of convictions, by the free employ*
mentofabQltyand Industry wherever Itmlghtcon
tribute to excellence in any department of our enter*
prise, and by unshrinking fidelity to the dictates of
Justice, Humanity, and Freedom.
By rery large outlays for early and authentic ad
▼ices by telegraph and otherwise from Us own cor*
respondents with the warious armies of the Union,
and by special efforts to furnish such information re*
spec ting Markets, Crops, new discoveries or Improve
ments In Agriculture, Ac> as must specially interest
fanners, we have assiduously labored to make a Jour*
nal calculated to meet the wants and subserve the
IntcrestsefCheProducingClaases. That end wo have
at least measurably attained; for no other newspaper
exists In America or Europe which is habitually read
by nearly so many farmers and their families as la
Tnx Tnnnrcrz - to-day* ‘Wo shall labor to Increase
both the number and the satisfaction of this by far
the most numet’bua class of its patrons.
During tho existence of_ the‘Whig party, this paper
supported that'party, though always sympathising
with the more liberal, progressive, Antl-31avery
*' wing** thereof. When new issues dissolved or train
formed old org«Dtuu«M through the spontaneous
uprising of the people of the Free States against the
repudiation of tbeMlssonrl Restriction, Tbs Tsxbtcx
heartily participated In <that movement, and was
Known as Republican. "When the long smouldering
conspiracy to divide and destroy oar country or re
duce it entire to complete abasement to the Slave
Power cylxnlnated in overt treason and rebellion, it
naturally, necessarily regarded resistance to this con
spiracy aa paramount to all other considerations, and
devoted all its energies and eiTortsto the malnten*
tcnance of our Union. In every great controversy
which bos divided our country. It has been found on
that side which naturally commands the sympathy
and support of the large majority of school houses
and the decided minority of grog-shops, and so doubt
less will be to the last. *
Ardently desiring and suiting for the early and en
during abutment of on? National distractions, Tint
Tiultoe leaves the time, tbo nature and tbe condi
tions of that adjustment Implicitly to thosa lawfully
m authority, confiding In their wisdom and patriot l
Ism, anxious to aid them to the utmost la their ardu
oiftresponslblilties.aadnot to embarrass them even
by possibility. Firmly believing in the Apostolle
rule—“ First pure, inxir peaceable”—holding that
tbe Anal extirpation of Slavery Is *hc true and only
absolute enre'for our National Ills—that any expe
dient that stops short of this can have bat a transient
and Illusory success—we yet propound no theory ol
1 reconstruction” and Indorse none that hasbecn pro
pounded by another—neither Samncr’snor'WhltlDs’B,
nor any of tbe various Copperhead devices for achiev
ing “Peace” by surrendering tbe Bepubllo Into the
power of ,Its tmUori?U4X9C3-but, exhorting the Amer
ican people to have fciih in their Government, to re
Inforce tbelr armies, and replenish their ireasttry, wd
believe that, if they bat do tbelr duty, a benign Provi
dence will In dne time bring this fearful straggle to
such a close as will bcsfcanbservo the true greatness
of our country and the permanent well being of man
kind.
