SCENES AND INCIDENTS.
WASHINGTON , December 4. The
Chronicle ( special Bays : The re-assem
blage of congress to-day was attended
by some aconoa that were not usual.
In the senate , of course , there are no
changes. There nr no changes in
the house save three or four members
who were seleoto'd to servo put terms
occasioned by deaths and resignation ! ) ,
but there was much interest taken in
the scenes that transpired in the
house. O no-half the members have
Ijt jn defeated ; congratulation ! ) ovur
successes and expressions of aympathy
over defeats were numerous. It was
noticed that those members who have
been ro-oloated to the next congress
were tory jubilant , while those who
have not had that good luck wcro
rathor.dopressod. 01 the entire dele-
gation'from California , Bosocrans is
the only one who waa congratulated.
Page had but little to say to any one.
It was evident that ho was unhappy.
Iloaecrans got in bis bills in regard to
merchant nurlno and Page put in a
couple of bills on tbo aaaie subject , as
also a petition asking for passage. In
addition , Euaecrana introduced a bill
to aid in the construction of the Yol-
lowatono Park railroad.
Major Conger , who is ouporinten-
dent of the Yellowstone park , is in
the Oity. He says there were ten
thousand visitors there during the
past season and the prospects for next
season are oven brighter. He says
that a branch of the Northern Pacific
railroad now runs within G5 miloa of
vtho park and that by next season it
ll be within five miles of the park.
Mr. Berry was the only member nb-
wmt. Gov. Pacheoo , though present
ay , was granted an indefinite
leave of absence. He has been or
dered by his physicians to take bis
wife to Florida for the winter. . Mra.
Pacheco is suffering from inflamma
tory rhenmttism and cannot get per
manent relief unless she goes to a
milder climate. He says ho expects
to start for the south to-morrow with
her. His return depends entirely
npon the Improvement of his wife.
Mr. Pacheco said this evening that ho
\ did not think much business other
than general appropriation bills would
bo done until nfter the Christmas
holidays , by which time ho expects to
bo back. Ho says his committee on
private land claims will devote
their entire services towards
securing the passrj ) of
a bill to organiza a coinmi-aiuii to ex
amine into , adjudicate and report up
on all the various land claims in Cali
fornia , Oregon , Nevada and Now
Mexico , which are nonr pending before -
fore congress and which have boon
struggling for settlement for BO many
years , This commission , ho think ; ,
can dispose of moat of the claims in
a couple of years , and that the inter-
cats of the claimants , as well as the
government , can bo best secured by
nuoh a measure. Ho says that the
sentiment among the eastern mem
bers is BO strong against giving land
to claimants of this kind thut : xll
bills , just and unjust , are staved off
and innocent claimants made to
suffer.
There were a largo number of bills
introduced to-day to do away en
tirely as well as to reduce internal
revenue taxes. They were referred
to the waya and moans committee.
TJ. T9port of the tariff commission
was 'given the name reference , thus
giving that commission iu less than
an honr enough to occupy it for Rev-
oral months. Among its members of
both political parlies there is a desire -
sire that this ahull be a business ses
sion. There is no doubt but there is
plenty of business to ba done ; but it
remains to bo seen what will bo done.
Bontimout ia against lengthy holiday
recess and avoreu to indulgence in
political talk.
Klizi Allen , minister to the Hawai-
an lehmls , is ahoady on hfiid , flt'p-
ported by several active assistants , for
the purpose keeping up Spreckle's
Sandwich Island uugar monopoly , if
possible. Ho will remain the ontiio
winter.
The wlfo of Senator Jones , of Ne
vada , is now entertaining as horgupsts
Mrs. and Mlsa Gratton , and Mus
Sterling , of California. Miss Sterling
will spend the entire season with Mm ,
Jones , and other guests will add to
the attractions cf the iransion duiing
the winter.
It is rumored that the wedding of
Ernest Dlchman. late minister to
Columbia , and MHB Qratton , of Cali
fornia , will occur before the holidays.
The ceremony will ba held either at
the residence of Senator Jones , r at
Bt. John's church , where Pre iUout
Arthur attends.
The secretory of the treasury , in his
estimates , recommends that the salary
of cashier for the assistant treasurer
at San Francisco bo increased from
$3,000 to $3COO per annum. He also
rosommenda an appropriation of $03-

THE ATTORNEY OKNERAt's REPORT.
WASHINGTON , D. 0. , December 4.
The report of the attorney general
calls attention to the necessity for
speedy legislation in the direction of
affording effectual relief from the delays -
lays which now obstruct the adminis
tration of justice in the supreme court
and to sotno extent the circuit and dis
trict courts of the United States. In
civil suits 099 cases terminated favor
ably to the United States and 974 were
either nol prosed , dismissed or con
tinued. For expenses of the courts of
the United States for the last fiscal
year $2,710,912 were paid , nnd the
amount naked for the expenses for the
next fiscalyear Ia $3,260OCO The at
torney general recommends n revision
of the present marshals' fco bill , on
increase ot appropriation enabling the
attorney general to properly investigate
the accoun's ot the dutrict a torncys ,
marshals , clerks , nnd ether cilicialc ,
and ro enactment of u section provid
ing that United Slates attorneys may
appoint substitute attorneys to attend
to the duties of the oflico when they
cannqt attend to them themselves.
The attorney general calls attention
to the refusal of the legislature of
Utah to appropriate funds for the ex
ecution of territorial laws under the
congressional legislature , and says , "If
this legislature is to be maintained a
special appropriation must therefore
be made necessary to moot the de
mands of justice. The legislature has
been persistent for several years in
this particular , and thus has escaped
the charges berne by all
ether territories. This amounts
to about $20,000 annually. "
POSTAL FACTS.
The report of Pouonater General
D wo for the fiscal year ended June
30 , 1882 , shows the total disburse
ments of the poatal service during the
year $40 482,012 ; ordinary receipts
$41 515,642 ; receipts from money or
ders $300,767 : excess of receipts $1-
394,388. For the first time in thirty-
one years the postal service is not a
burden upon the treasury.t Some
part this great improvomoet is due to
the wonderful growth .and prosperity
of the country bat the larger part ia
due to the Improved methods in ad
ministration of the service. ' The
heaviest item , of expenditure is for
transportation of malls on railways.
The next heaviest Is that for pay of
postmasters. These two items must
swell with the volume of bneinoar ,
since the rate of compensation Is pro
portioned to the amount of business
done. The expenditure next in rank
is for what is known as the star sor-
vloa ; that includes all mail transporta
tion not on railways nor on steam
boats.
Congress is invoked to make one
more effort to engraft upon poatal
service a syatnma of deposits for small
auras , and a recommendation is made
that postage or second-class matter bo
abolished. "After the fullest con
sideration I have boon able to give
the subject of telegraph , I am forced
to the conclusion that the tlmo has
fully come when the telegraph and
postal aorvico should be embraced
under one management. "
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the
navy recommends the promotion by
selection to grade of roar admiral , and
thu construction of two second-rate
steel cruisers , one stool ram and an
iron dispttch boat all to cost not to
exceed $3,500,000. The reports rec
ommends the transfer of the light-
hooso service to the coast surrey and
revenue marine to the nrwy depart
ment , UB the first two are not proper
ly pait of the treasuiy and are largely
operated by the navy employes at
present and properly come within its
scope of operations. Ao a measure of
economy , the union of the naval and
marine hospital ) is suggested. The
report comments at length upon
the decline of American shipping
and eays the present evils must
be remedied , or American shipping
will bo entirely wiped out , It recom
mends the adoption of a protective
system1 and largo compensation for
carrying mails in American shine , nnd
the establishment of a mercantile raa-
rino in the navy department. The
report concludes as follows ; "If the
naval establishment is not made ofleo-
tivo , it should bu discontinued , iind
015,000,000 annually expended be
reserved to procure assistance In
national emergencies of foreign ships
and guns. If governmental measures
are not soon adopted to promote the
carrying trade and arrest the disap
pearance of American ships from the
ocean , wo shall soon cease to be a sea >
faring people , and will not need to
maintain a navy of our own. "
THE NEBRASKA SBNATOlttHir
Senator Van Wyck nays there is no
doubt whatever of the election of a
republican to succeed Senator Maun
ders ; that most of the members
elected to the legislature as antt-
monopollsts are republicans.
A RETIRING ADMIRAL.
Orders were received to-day for the
relief of Rear Admiral Batch from the
command of the Pacific station by
Rear Admiral Hughes. Batch will
retire January 3.
THE COLLINS LETTER.

NOTKS.
The house committee to-day further
reduced the Indian appropriation bill ,
making the total amount $5,208,955 ,
n decrease of $274,200 from the appro
priations of the current year.
Owing to _ land frauds of startling
magnitude in connection with the
Ossgo Indian lands in Kansas , the
commissioner of the general land office
has issued an order suspending nil
cash entries made by single men
since Juno 23 , 1881 , whore lands lie

WASHINGTON , D. 0 , December 4
To tuo Scnatn and Houto of Repre
sentatives of the United States : It
in provided by the constitution that
the president shall from time to time
ijivii to the congress Information of
t .e stuto of the Uijion nnd recom
mend to their consideration auch
mouBUree us ho shall judge necessary
and expedient in reviewing the
events ot thu year which has elapsed
alnca the commencement of your ses
sion.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
ARREST OF AMERICANS INIREIAND.
I first call your attontlou to the
gratifjiug condition of our foreign
affairs. Our intercourse with
other poirera has continued to
bo of the moat friendly charac
ter. Such Blight differences as have
orison during the year have' boon al
ready settled or are likely tn reach an
early adjustment. The arrest of cltl-
iibna of the United States in Ireland
under rcoent laws which ewe their
origin to the disturbed condition of
that country , has led to a somewhat
extended correspond en co with the gov
ernment of Great Britain. A dis
position to.rcspeot our rights has boon
practically manifested by the release
of the arrested parties.
1IIK ISTHMUS CANAL.
The claim of this nation in regard
to the supervision and control of the
intor-ocounio canal across the Ameri
can isthmus has continued to be the
subject of conference. It is likely
that time will bo more powerful than
iiscussion in removing the divergence
between the two nations , whoso friend
ship is so closely cemented by the in
timacy of their relations and the com
munity.
RUSSIAN JEWS.
Oar long established friendliness
with llusaia has remained unbroken ,
It has prompted mo to proffer the
earnest councils of this government
that measures bo adopted for suppress
ing prescription which the Hebrew
race in that country has lately suffered.
It has not transpired that any Amur !
can citizen has been subjected to ar
rest or injury , but our courteous re-
moimtrancu has novortholcis boon
courteously received , and there is rea *
son to boiiovo the thru ) is not far dis
tant when Russia will bo able to secure
toleration to all faiths within her
borders.
or TIUDK MAIIKH ,
At an international convention hold
at Paris in 1880 , and attontod by rep
resentatives of the United States , nit
jgrcemont was reached in regard to
the protection of trudo marks , patented
urticloH , and the rights of manufac
turers and corporations. The formu
lating into treaties of the recommen
dations thus adopted is receiving the
attention which it merits.
pin Trvnax or SUBJUBINK CABLES
is a subject now under consideration
by an international conference ut
Purls. Bolioviiitf thill It is clearly the
true policy of this government to favor
the nuutraliV.it ion of this moans of in
tercourse , I requested our minister to
Franco to attend the convention as a
delegate , I ulso delegated two of our
eminent scientists to attend as our
representatives at the meeting of on
international convention at Paris for
considering the adoption of a common
unit to measure electric forco.
In view of the frequent occurrence
of conferences' for the consideration
of important matters of common in
terest to the civilized nations , I re
spectfully suggest that the uxooutivo
bo invested by congress with discre
tionary power to send delegated tn
ouch conventions and that provision
bo made to defray thu expenses Inci
dent thereto.
SPAIN AND HEll OQIONIK8 ?
The difference between the United
States and Spain as to the effect of a
judgment and certificate of naturuliza
tion has not yet been adjusted , but It
is hoped and believed that negotia
tions now in progress will result in
the establishment of the position
which seems to thin government reasonable -
sonablo and just. I have already
called the attention of congress to the
Fact that in exports of Spain nnd its
colonies onerous fines have latolv boon
imposed upon vessels of the United
States for trivial , technical offences
gainst local regulations Efforts fcr
the abatement of theto exactions have
thus far proved unsuccessful I re
gret to Inform you also that the foes
demanded by Spanish consuls in
American ports are in some casiw no
largo , when compared with the value
of the cargo , as to amount in effect tea
a considerable export duty , nnd that
ivory remonstrance in this regard
ifts not as yet received the atten
tion which they seem to deserve.
THR HAMnimn EXIIIIUTION.
The Gorman government has invited -
vitod the United States to participate
n an international exhibition of do-
nestle cattle , to bo hold in Hamburg
u July , 1883. If this country is to
> o represented , it is important that in
.ho early days of this session congress
should make a suitable appropriation
'or ' that purpose.
TUB DKATH OF Mil MARHU ,
our late minister to Italy , has evoked
rom that government expressionsof
profound respect for his exalted char-
utor and for his honorable care > r in
.ho diplomatic service of his country.
The Italian government has raised a
question ns to the propriety of rocog-
lining in his dual capacity the repre
sentative of this country recently ac
credited both as soototary of the le
gation nnd as consul general at Rome.
Lie has boon received as secretary ,
jut his excquatus as consul general

eration since 1874 , has boon lately sup

1MMIORATION OP PAUPERS AND CRIM
INALS
'rom certain of the cantons of Swltznr-
and has substantially ceased end -is
10 longer sanctioned by the authoii-
lies. The consideration of the sub-
cot prompts the BURuestion that the
lot of August 3d , 1882 , which has
! or its object the return of foreign
ionvicto to their own country , should
30 so modified as not to bo open to
.ho interpretation that it effects the
extradition of criminals on preferred
ohargoa of crime.
THE OTTAMAN VORTE.
baa not yet assorted to the Interpola
tion which this government has put
upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its
jurisdiotional rights in Turkey. It
may be well , hownvor , that this differ
ence bo adjusted by a general revision
of the oyatem of jurisdiction of the
United States in the countries of the
ixutsubject to which your attention
has already boon called by the secre
tary of the state.
CHILI AND JAPAN.
In the interest of justice toward
Ohill and Japan , I trust the question
of return of the indemnity fund to
the governments of those countries
will reach at the present session a
satisfactory solution , which I have al
ready recommended , and which has
been recently foreshadowed by con
gressional discussion. The treaty
atoly concluded with Ooroa awaits
action of the senate.
TJIB EGYPTIAN HOW.
During the late disturbances In
Egypt the timely presence of Amort-
can vcsaols received as n protection
the parsons and property of many
of our own citizens , and of citizens of
other countries , whoso governments
expressed their thanks for this assist
ance.
UHJNKHE IMMIC1RATION.
The recent legislation restricting
mmigration of laborers from China
ma given rise to the question whether
Chinese proceeding to or from another
country may lawfully pass through our
own. In construing the act of May
i , 1882 , in connection with the treaty
of November 1 , 1870 , the restriction
would Boom to bo limited to Chinese
inmlgrjnts coming to the United
States as laborers , and should not for-
jld a man transit across our country.
[ auk the attention of cont'ro a to the
mbjuot , for euch notion , it uny , us may
jo ileomod advisable.
THE RIU'UBUU 01' LIUKHIA.
This government has recently had
occasion to manifest Interest in the ro-
lublla of Liberia , by soaking to aid
; ho amicable settlement of the boun
dary dispute now pending between
that republic and the British posses
aion of Sierra Loon ,
T/IK HAWAIIAN TJIEATY ,
The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii
will become terminable after Septem
ber 0 , 1883 , on two months' notice by
jithor party , While certain provis
ions of that compact may have proved
onerous , its existence has fostered
commercial relations which it is im
portant to preserve. I suggest ,
: horefore , that early consideration bo
ivon to such modifications of the
inuty QH seem to bo demanded by the
interests of our people.
UAYTl AND HAN DOUINOO.
In view of an increasing trade with
both Hayti and San Domingo , I ad
vise that provision bo made for
diplomatic intercourse with the latter
by enlarging the ecopo of the mission
at Au-prlncu. I regret it hat a certait
class of American claims against the
government of llayti have thus fai
boon urged unavailingly.
TKNKKUEtA AND BOLIVIA ,
No change has occurred in our rcla
tions with Venezuela. I again invok
your action on the matter of thu pending
ing awards against that republic t
which reference was made by a apecia
mostago from the executive at you
last session. An invitation has beer
received from the government o
YonezuoU to send ropruioutatlves I
July 1883 to Oaraocas for
, , particlpa-
Ion in the centennial celebration of
ho birth of Bolivar , the founder of
ho South American independence ,
'n connection with- this event it is : de
igned to commence- the erection at
} i raccaa of a statue of Washington ,
nd to conduct an industrial oxhlbi-
ion which will bo open to American
rodncIs. I request that the United
Itittos bo represented , and that suit-
bio provision bo made therefor '
CHILI.
The elevation of the grade of one
itsslon in Central America to the
lonlpotontiary rank'which waa au-
liorieod by congress at its late scs-
iob , has been olnco effected. The
war between Peru and Bolivia on the
no side , and Chili on the other , be
an more than three yearn ago on the
wpupation by Chili , in 1880 , of all the
toral territory of Bolivia. Negotla-
lena for peaoo were conducted under
lie direction of the United States.
? ho allies refused to concede any tor-
itory , but Chili has since booomo
master of the whole coast of both
ountrtos , and of the capital of Poru. '
V year since , as yon have already
con advised by correspond-
nco transmittsd to yon in
anuary last , this government
ont a special mcstago to the bolliger-
nt powers to express the hope that
Chill would bo disposed to accept &
lonoy indemnity for the expenses of
tie war , and to relinquish her demander
or a portion of the territory ot her
ntagoniat. This recommendation ,
hloh Ohill declined to follow , this
oyornmont did not assume to enforce ,
t ia not to bo enforced wlthput resort to
measures which would bo in keeping ,
either with the temper of purpooplo
or with the spirit of our inslitutions.
The power of Peru no longer extends
vor UB whole territory , and In the i
vent of our interference to secure * \ *
icaco , would need to bo supplemented
y the armies and navies of the Tint *
ed Slates , Such interference would
Imost inevitably load to the
stabllshmont of a protectorate ,
result utterly at odds with our past
policy , Injurious to our present Inter- \
nts and full of orabarassmonts for the
nturo , For effecting the termination
t hostilities upon towns at once , just
o the victorious nations and generous
o ita adversaries , this government
ias spaired no efforts , s va such ax
might involve the complications which
have indicated. It It greatly to bo
deplored that Ohill seems resolved to
ixact such rigorods conditions of peaoo
nd Indiiposod to anbmit to arbitra-
ion the terms of an amicable settle-
nont. No peace Is likely to bo last-
np that is not Buflioiontly equitable
and just to command the approval of
) thpr natioVis. About a year slnco
nvitations were extended to the na-
ions of this continent to Bond repro-
ontatives teA
A I'KAOE OONCIRESS
o assomblb at Washington In Novom-
ior , 1882 , the time of mooting waa
ixod at a period then remote In the
lope as the invitation itself declared
hat in the meantime the disturbance
aotwoeri the South American republic *
would ha _ adjusted. 4As , , that expwtk-
tion eoemed unlikgly to be"realized ) ' !
asked in April last for an expression
of opinion from the two houses of
congress as to the advisability of hold-
"ng the proposed convention at the
imo mentioned. This action waa
prompted in part by doubts which
natcro reflection had suggested
whether the diplomatic usage and tra
ditions of the government did not
make it fitting that the executive
ihoold consult the representatives of
.ho people before pursuing a line of
> olioy somewhat novel in ita charao-
or and far reaching in its possible
conscquoncos. In view of the fact
hat no action waa taken by congress
n the promises and that no provision
md boon made for necessary ex-
lonsca , I subsequently decided to
loatpono the convention and BO noli-
iod the several governments which
md boon invited to attend. I am un
willing to dismiss this subject without
assuring you of my support of any
moaaaros the wisdom of congress may
loviso for the promotion of peace on
his continent and throughout the
world and I trust that the time is
nigh that when with the universal
lonsont of the civilized people all in-
emotional difloronces shall bo deter
mined without resort to arms to the
> onignant processes of arbitration.

UNIKOKM TIME.
I renew my recommendation of such \
legislation as will place the United
states in harmony with ether mari-
titio powers with respect to the inter
national rules for the prevention of
colllBiona at tea. In conformity with
youi joint resolution of the 3d of Au.

tary of state to address foreign gov
ernments in respect to a proposed
conference for considering the subject
of the universal adoption of a com
mon prime meridian to bo used in
the reckoning of longitude and iu the
regulation of time throughout the
civilized world. Their replies will in
