3 ' THE FRESIDTNT'S MESSAGE.
A Larger Army Needed An Anti-Trust Law
Becoaoended The Chinese Problem Re
duction in War Tax-Other Matters. .
President McKinleyV message to
Coni.TC,-ss was read in both , houses
last M"ndayQ Beginning with a ref
erence to the country's prosperity,
he next takes up the' history of the
Chinee troubles and pays a splendid
tribute to the heroism of American
0jiers, sailors and marines who
rescued the band in the legation.
In all the stirring chapters," he
sars." which record the heroism of
the devoted band, clinging to hope
in the face of despir, and the un
daunted spirit that led their reliev
ers through battle and suffering to
the goal, it is a memory of which
any country may be justly proud
that the honor of our flag was main
tained alike in the siege and tho res
cue, and that stout American hearts
have again set high, in fervent emu
lation with true men of other races
and languages, the indominatable
courage that ever strives for the
cause of right and justice."
TTIK MATTER OF INDEMNITY. '
The President looks upon the mat
ter of indemnity for our citizens who
have suffered by the Boxer outrages
as a matter of grave concern.
Compensation in part will come,
he thinks, in benefits derived from
tho opening of China to the equal
commerce of the world. He expresses
the hope that the powers will not
attempt to force demands from Chi
na the Imperial government will be
unable to meet.
Our success at Paris Exposition is
a mutter for gratification. We cap
tured more prizes than any other
competing nation.
DENOUNCES LYNCIIING. .
Lynching he denounces in strong
terms, repeating his tormer declara
tion that it is a reproach to our
civilization.
NICARAGUA CANAL.
Regarding the Nicaniguan Canal,
he commends the "early attention of
the Senate to the convention with
Great Britain to facilitate the con
struction of such a canal and to
remove any objection which might
arise out of the convention com
monly called the. Clayton Bulwer
treaty."
NATIONAL REVENUES.
The surplus revenues for the last
fiscal year were $79,527,080.18.. The
ix preceding years show only deti
cits, the aggregate of which amounted
to more tiian two hundred million
dollars.
FOREIGN TRADE.
Our foreign trade shows a re
markable records of industrial and
commercial progress, the President
says, and on account of this wonder
ful pr.-spesity he advocates cutting
down the war revenue taxes to the
amount of thirty millions annually.
Those taxes which are most bunlen
omo to the people should be lopped
off.
AS TO TRUSTS.
"In my last annual message to the
Congress I called attention to the
necessity for early action to remedy
nidi evils as might be found to ex
M in connection with combinations
't uMtal organized into trusts and
again invite attention to my discus
sion of the subject at that time,
which concluded with the-e words :

SOVEREIGNTY IN THE PHILIPPINES.
He reiterates his former determi
nation to uphold the sovereignty of
the United States in the Philippines
as in all other places where our flag
rightfully floats; but. advocates fair
dealing. "Tho fortune of war has
thrown upon this nation an unsought
trust which should bo unselfishly
discharged, and devolved upon this
government a moral as well as ma
terial responsibility toward these
millions whom we have freed from
an oppressive yoke.
"I have on another occasion
called tho Filipinos 'the wards of the
nation.' Our obligation as guardian
was not lightly assumed; it must
not be otherwise than honestly ful
filled. Aiming first of all to benefit
those who have come under our fos
tering care, it is our duty so to treat
them that bur flag may be no less
beloved in the mountains of Luzon
and the fertile zones of Mindanao
and Negros than it is at home, that
there as here it shall be the revered
symbol of liberty, enlightenment,
and progress in every avenue of de
velopment. The Filipinos are a race quick to
learn and to profit by knowledge.
He would be rash who, with the
teachings of contemporaneous his
tory in view would fix a limit to
tho degree of culture and advance
ment yet within the reach of these
people if our duty toward them bo
faithfully performed."
AN ARMY OF 100,000 MEN URGED.
"The present strength of the army
is 100,000 men 65,000 regulars and
35,000 volunteers. Under the act of
March 2, 1899, on the 30th of June
next the present volunteer force
will be discharged and the regular
army will be reduced to 2,447 offi
cers imd 29,025 enlisted men.
"There aje fifty eight or more mil
itary posts in the United States
other than the eoast-defense fortifi
cations. 4 'The number of these posts is being
constantly increased by the Congress.
More than $22,000,000 have been ex
pended in building and equipment,
and they can only be cared for by
the regular army. The posts now
in existence and others to be built
provide for accommodations for,
and it lulJy garrisoned, require
20,000 troops. Many of these posts
are-along our frontier or at impor
tant strategic points, the occupation
of which is necessary.
,4Ve have in Cuba between 5,000
and 6,000 troops. For the present
our troops in that island cannot be
withdrawn or materially diminished,
and certainly not until tho conclu
sion of the labors of the constitu
tiomil convention now in session iind
a government provided by the new
constitution shall have been estab
lished and its stability assured.
"In Porto Rico we have reduced
the gtrrisons to l,(3u, which in
eludes 879 native troops. There i-
no room for further reduction here
"We will be required to keep a
considerable force in the Philippines
for some time to come. From the
best information obtainable we win
need there for the immediate future
from 45,000 to 60,000 men. I am
sure the number may be reduced as
the insurgents shall come to acknowl-.
edge the authority of the United
States, of which there are assuring
indications.
"It must be apparent that we will
require an army ot about 60,000. and
that during present conditions in
Cuba and the Philippines the Presi
dent should have authority to in
crease the force to the present mini
her of 100,000. Included in this num
ber authority should be given to
raise native troops in the Philip
pine3 up to 15,000, which the Talt
commission believe will be more
effective in detecting and suppress
ing guerrillas, assassins, and ladrones
than our own soldiers.
THE SUCCESS OF RURAL FREE DELIVERY.
-Tne continued and rapid growth
of the postal service is a sure index
of the great and increasing business
Me.tivifv of the countrv. Its most
striking new development is the ex
tension of rural free delivery. This
has come almost wholly within the
lat year At the beginning of the
fiscal year 1899-1900 the number of
routes in operation was only 391, and
most of these had been running less
than twelve months. On the 15th of
Novemer. 1900, the number had in
creased to 2,614, reaching into forty
four States and Territories, and
serving ..population of 1,801,524.
The number of applications now
pending and awaiting action nearly
equals all those granted up to the
Sharpies Cream Separators Profit
able Dairying.
present time, and by the close of the
current fiscal year about 4,000 routes
will have been established, providing
for the daily delivery of mails at the
scattered homes of about three and
a half millions of rural population.
"This service ameliorates the isola
tion of farm life, conduces good roads,
and quickens and extends the dis
semination of general information.
Experience thus far has tended to
allay the apprehension that it would
be so expensive as to forbid its gen
eral adoption or make it a serious
burden. Its actual application has
shown that it increases postal re
ceipts, and can be accompanied by
reductions in other branches of the
service, so that the augmented reve
nues and the accomplished savings
together materially reduce the net
cost The evidences which point to
these conclusions are presented in
detail in the annual Report of the
Postmaster-General, which with its
recommendations is commended to
the consideration of the Congress.
The full development of this special
service, however, requires such a
large outlay of money that it should
be undertaken -only after a careful
and thorough understanding of all
that it involves."
ECONOMY URGED.
The President pays a high compli
ment to the efficiency of both the
land and sea service, praises the ad
ministration in Porto Rico, says the
new census bureau has accomplished
gratifying results and concludes his
message with the following timely
warning against extravagance :
"In our great prosperity we must
guard against the danger it invites
of extravagance in government ex
penditures and appropriations ; and
the chosen representatives of the
people will, I doubt not, furnish an
example in their legislation of that
wise economy which in a season of
plenty husbands for the future. In
this era of great business activity
and opportunity caution is not un
timely. It will not abate, but
strengthen, confidence. It will not
retard, but promote, legitimate in
dustrial.and commercial expansion.
Our growing power brings with it
temptations and perils requiring con
stant vigilance to avoid. It must
not be used to invite conflicts, not
for oppression, but for the more
effective maintenance of those prin
ciples of equality and justice upon
which ourinstitu tions and happiness
depend. Let us keep always in mind
that tho foundation of our govern
ment is liberty; its superstructure
peace."
Business Notices.
SEEDS THAT SURELY GROW.
' The cost of seeds compared with
th value of the crop is so small that
t few cents saved by buying second
rate seeds will amount t manv dol
lars lost when the harvest is gathered.
Farmers have found put by many
costly failures what a risky thing it
is to buy so nis without being pretty
sure that they are reliable and true
to name. The latest catalogue of the
seed house of D. M. Ferry & Co., of
Detroit, Mich., is a reminder that
thousands of farmers in the United
States and Canada have pinned their
raith to the reputation of this great
firm. During a business career ap
proaching half a century in time
Ferry's seeds have won an annual
increase in popularity, which is per
haps the best Evidence that they
grow and give satisfaction. Ferry's

The above singular combination is the trade-mark adopted by the Paris Medicine
" mpany of St. Tcui and is used in their advertisements of Grove's Tasteless Chill Tonic.
t-ba many people who may be interested to know the origin of this odd trade-mark, the
towing information is yiveu:
In tho sjfriiitf of 1893, the little two year old son of Mr. E. W. Grove was taken quite sick
,,i malaria.. Mr. Grove, knowing the virtue of his own medicine, commenced giving him
! rrovo'a Tjiitalrsa Chill Tonic. He had taken this prescription only a few days until quite.
. . favorable cliang was noted, in fact, he grew so rosyj healthy and plump, that Mrs. Grove
j.i describing iiis condition to her husband, remarked "Grove's Tonic makes our baby as fat
: h . i ig ". Th's led Mr. Grove to thinking that the expression "as fat as pigs" used in con-ue-tion
with bi.bies, was a very common one, and suggested to him the idea of combining a
child's face with a pijf's body, with wording as above, " Grove's Tonic makes children as fat
us pi.rs". It is aj; attractive trade-mark, and the remedy it represents Grove's Tonic--is
regard sd by the public as being the very best prescripti6n for Malaria, Chills and Fever,
s'he record of the Paris .Medicine Company shows that Nine Thousand gross Ninety car
