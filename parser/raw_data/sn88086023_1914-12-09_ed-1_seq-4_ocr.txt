BABY.
The sun rose- up In the
morning
Through his door in the
Eastern sky;,
And he flung back his curtains
of purple and red
To look out on the world, and
he laughed as he said,
"There's nothing so bright
as IV
Hut he never had seen my
baby's smile,
That is brighter than sun-
shine ull the while.
The moon stole out In the
evening
From the cloud; and up, up
she rolled
Through the wonderful blue of
the Autumn night,
And phe said, "Ah, the sun may
be never so bright,
Still there's nothing to match
my gold!"
Well, the moon, she's gold-
en and soft and fair,
F.ut she couldn't have seen
my baby's hair.
The stars peeped after tlje
twilight:
And when they were sure It
was gone,
They all flocked forth in a glit-
terlng show,
Singing. "No one can dance like
this below,
Though we've nothing to
dance upon!"
So they twinkled In mazes
light and fleet,
Eut they never had watched
my baby's feet

were willing to pay fifty million, and
did pay that amount, to the defunct
and corrupt French company that
had previously worked on the canal.
So this country became the chief

Govcmnunt Is vanced the theory
Nol Business, thnt "a constitutional
government is a cor
poration organized to carry on public
business" and that "the managers of
a public corporation have much the
same kind of business problems as
the managers of private corporations."
There could be no greater error.
Government is not business, and
business is not government. If busi
ness were managed the way govern
ment has to be managea, It would be
in the hands of a receiver. If gov
ernment were managed the way bus
iness is managed, there would be a
revoution.
There are certain technical busi
ness problems In government; but,
curiously enough, the men who are
most successful In solving them are
not business men. The business man
is usually a failure in government
because he treats government as a
business. And for a similar reason,
the successful statesman Is rarely a
competent business man. The great
secretaries of the treasury, for ev
ample Hamilton, Gallatin, Chase and
McCulloch were notably deficient in
so-called business ability, and with
very few exceptions millionaire busi
ness men who reach the United States
senate found themselves fully out of
their element. Lincoln could savehe
Union, but the Illinois Central rail
road regarded his legal services as
practically worthless.
The business of business is to show
a profit; but the business of govern
ment is to promote the general wel
fare, and the general welfare cannot
be reduced to dollars and cents or to
any tangible matter of bookkeeping.

CURRENT THINKING
TWO KINDS OF POOR RELIEF.
(Chicago Newa)
A question aa to whether charity
work should be carried on by public
or by private agencies has arisen
through the recent report of a sur
vey committee of the Cleveland Foun
dation. The issue involves a sharp
controversy between that organiza
tion and the Sage Foundation. The
latter, which has been in existence
for several years and which has al
ready published numerous reports,
discourages the giving of relief by
governmental ageneles at the expense
of the taxpayers. It takes the ground
that relief work should be carried on
by private agencies supported by vol-1

Getting Dealer Enthusiasm
i
Rube Marquanl.
Walter Johnson, the highest paid
baseball pitcher, and Rube Marquard
who draws a top notch salary, have
Jumped to the Federal League. John
son, who has been the mainstay of
the Washington club of the American
league for feveral seasons, has been
Crawlng $12,000 a year. Marquard
got $8000 a year from the New York
Giants.
Johnson la said to have been sign
ed for the Chicago Federal league
club by Joe Tinker, manager, for at
least $16,000 a year, while Marquard
went to the Brooklyn club of the same
league.
Johnson may be considered the
most valuable pitcher in baseball. It
Is probable that he would sell for a
higher price than any other man
pitching. Marquard was . bought
from Indianapolis by the Giants for
$11,000. He did not show well in
the first season, but he made up lat
er and was rated the greatest pitcher
in the country for one season.
The signing of these contracts Is
the answer of the Federal league to
the charge of organized baseball, that
the Federals were on the rocks and
would not open the season of 1915.
The Federals have signed many oth
er players from both big leagues and
the minors of organized baseball.
Clark Griffith, manager of the Wash
ington club, insists Johnson has no
legal right to Jump to the Federal
league nnd that he will sue for dam
ages. The New York club declares
that there are Iron-clad contracts
with Marquard and suits will follow
his signing with the Federals ot
Brooklyn. , i

enthusiasm
Half of the battle
goods is getting the
of the sales force.
The same rule applies to goods
sold over the retailer's counter.
When the retailer is pushing an
article with vim it usually sells.
National manufacturers are
finding that the surest way to
create dealer enthusiasm is
through newspaper advertising.
When a nationally made article
of merit is advertised in the news
papers, the dealers know the de
mand will be immediate and
definite.
They get behind the goods
and increased sales follow.
