SCHLEY'S LETTER
Asks Secretary Long to Delay Ap
proval of Court's Find ings.
COUNSEL TO SUBMIT OBJEflONS
Admiral Dewey Refuses to Say
Anything.
VIEWS OF LAW OFFICERS
Admiral SchIy was in consultation all
this forenoon with his counsel. Isador
Rayner and Mr. A. Teague; also Gen. Fe
lix Agnus of Baltimore and Representative
Schirm of Maryland. After the conference
Admiral Schley authorized Mr. Teague to
make the following statement:
"We have been in consultation as to
what further proceedings shall be taken.
Nothing definite has been determined
upon so far as civil or criminal action of
any kind against Maclay and his spon
sors is concerned. Maclay's claim that the
findings of the court are a vindication for
himself and his book is absolutely spuri
ous.
"There are no less than half a dozen in
stances in the book in which. even if he
were to accept the findings of the court
and incorporate them in the volume and
change it to suit the findings, the book
would still be criminal libel."
Mr. Teague. during the afternoon, pre
scnted the following letter to Secretary
Long:
"WASHINGTON, D. C.,
"December 16. 1901.
"Sir: I have the honor to most respect
fully request that you withhold your ap
proval from the findings of the court of in
quiry recently held at the navy yard in the
city of Washington, of which Admiral
George Dewey was president, until sucn
time as I may have an opportunity to file a
statement of objections thereto, and I there
fore request that you do not dissolve the
court until action shall have been taken on
such objections. Very respectfully,
"W. S. SCHLEY.
"Rear Admiral, U. S. N."
"ISADORE RAYNER.
Counsel for the Applicant Before Said
Court of Inquiry.
"To the Hon. Secretary of the Navy."
He asked the Secretary to Indicate his
probable action in the premises.
Request to Be Granted.
The Secretary replied that the request
would be granted and his action in the
findings and the dissolution of the court
withheld until the objections were received,
and he had had an opportunity to consider
them. He stated that he would communi
cate with Admiral Schley in writing and
asked how long a time counsel desired to
present their objections.
Mr. Teague replied that they would be
ready for presentation by Thursday or Fri
day of this week.
"We will except to the findings of the
court." said Mr. Teague. "and make a de
mand that the majority opinion be disap
proved by the Secretary as contrary to the
evidence and the pertinent facts in the
case which the court has not considered
nor acted upon."
While Mr. Teague would not say that
su:ch action would be taken, he pointed out
the fact that they could appeal from the
Secretary's action to the President of the
United States.
Admiral Schley has been relieved fro3m
further duty In connection with the court
of inquiry.
This Morulngs Conference.
By agreement with Admiral Schley, Mr.
Rayner and Mr. M. A. Teague, one of the
latter's assistants before the court of in
quiry, came to Washington from Baltimore
at about 10 o'clock this morning. They
went at once to the apartments at the Ho
tel Richmond occupied by Admiral and
Mrs. Schley and remained behind closed
doors until abouf 1 o'clock.
The conference was resumed after lunch
eon, and It expected to continue until late
this afternoon. Mr. Rayner and Mr. Teague
will spend the greater part of every day
with Admiral Schley until the statement to
the Secretary of the Navy is ready. They
will then consider the desirability of filing
suit against Mr. Maclay on the basis of his
averments as to Admiral Schley In his his
tory.
No date was assigned by any one con
nected with the conference when a decision
might be expected, but It is thought some
announcement on the subject may be looked
for by Monday next. Secretary Long wi~l
require at least a day for deliberating on
the statement made by Mr. Rayner. and in
that time Admiral Scbey's counsel is ex
pected to have reached some conclusion.
ACTION iN CONGRESS.
Seater Jones Introdueen Resolution
for Thanks to Schbley.
Mr. Jones (Ark.) introduced in the Sen
ate today a joint resolution, as follows:
"That the thanks of Congress and tile
American peolie are hereby tendered to
Rear Admiral Winfield S. Schley and the
officers and men under his command for
highly distinguished conduct in conflict
with the enemy. as displayed by them in
the destruction of the Spanish fleet off the
harbor of Santiago. Cuba, July 3, 1808.
"That the President of the United States
be requested to cause this resolution to be
communicated to Rear Admiral Schley, andl
through him to the officers and men under
his command."
Without comment the resolution was re
ferred to the committee on naval affairs.
A meeting of the Maryland delegation in
Congress will be held tomorrow or the next
day, at which resolutions, will be consid
ered for a eongressonal -iuvestigtion of
the naval controversy. The resolutions, it
is understood, will be presented by Repre
sentative Pearre from the district in which
Schley lIves.
in speaking on the subject today to a
Star reporter Mr. Pearre said that from
conversation he had had with the mem
bers from Maryland he was convinced that
they were practically of the same opinion
as himself, and that was that the findings
in the Schley court of Inquiry were very
unsatisfactory-. The resolutions for an In
Vestigation will be based on this fact.
In giving an Illustration of what he
meant. Mr. Pearre said that in the findings
of the court the reference to the loop of
the Brooklyn stated that the turn was
made to avoid proximity to the Spanish
squadron. That, he said, could be Inter
preted in no other way than that the turn
was ordered through a feeling of cow
ardice. At the same time the court, he
said, vindicated Schiey from that charge
in the last sentence of the opinion, by say
bmg that his conduct was such as to prop
erly inspire his men in battle.
Mr. Pearre said that so far as public
epinion was concerned there was no needJ
for a further investigatIon of the case. It
was the ocial record which It was desired
to correct.
"For instance. he said, If Admiral Schley
ahould bring legal proceedings against the
pubishers of the Maecay history people
might at once may that he only sought
ground through the investi ntln- to gain a
mometary recompmpee.t his honor

Askhed what wouta he *ti pesi tarn.
1asa Jsw I= the sum sameame
a heeta raceSi t mate.n Aetm
might also be taken placing Admiral Schley
on the retired list at full pay, .which would
be a complete vindication for his conduct.
This matter, however, he said, was too
far In the future to receive specific con
sideration at this time, but the work for
the present was that of getting congres
sional action.
Mr. Pearre realized that this might be
difficult of accomplishment, and he also
realized, he said, that there was danger of
the Investigation partaking of politics, but
there was no alternative, as the finding of.
the court was such as to make it necessary
that further steps be taken to right the in
justice which has been done to Admiral
Schley, who, though he might have had
lapses on minor matters during the cam
paign, the result was such. that the Amer
ean people could not afford to let his eficial
record go down in history as that of a
coward.
The resolutions which Mr. Pearre will
present to the Maryland delegation have
not been definitely decided upon. He said
that their specific form would depend upon
the conference which Is to be held; that it
was desired that the delegation act as a
unit in the matter, and the recommenda
tions made at the conference would be
acted upon in the matter of the resolutions.
Impression at Navy Department.
So far as is known the Navy Department
has not yet been informed as to the line of
action to be followed by Admiral'Schley in
this matter beyond the fact, as disclosed
this morning, that he would file formal
objections to the approval of the report of.
the court. There is an Impression at the:
Navy Depart.nent that today's action !s
preliminary to an effort to obtain either a
reconsideration of the case by the present
court or an entirely new hearing by a new
court composed of other members.
Secretary Long Somewhat Perplexed.
There is naturally great curiosity to know
what action Secretary Long will take with
the reports submitted by the Dewey court,
provided he decides against another inves
tigation. It is known that he is somewhat
perplexed in the matter, in view of the un
certainty as to the position of Admiral
Dewey, especially with reference to the
question of his concurrence with all the
findings of the court, except those to which
he demurred in his individual report.
An embarrassing feature of the situation'
is that while the Secretary might be willing
to approve the main report and the recom
mendation that no further proceedings be
had. it is felt that he could not consistently
approve the individual report of Admiral
Dewey without completely reversing him
self on the main point of contention as to
what officer was In command of the squad
ron at the battle of Santiago bay. As a
lawyer, it Is said that Secretary Long
agrees with the view taken by Judge Ad
vocate General Lemly and other military
lawyers, that in signing the main report
Admiral Dewey subscribed to all its con
elosions to which he did not dissent In
his separate report.
Dewey's Special Report.
It Is contended that if Secretary Long
failed to make any indorsement on the spe
cial report of Admiral Dewey It would
practically amount to a disapproval of that
report and place the Secretary of the Navy
in apparent antagonism with the admiral
of the navy on the vital question as to
whether Admiral Sampson or Admiral
Schley was entitled to the credit of the
naval victory at Santiago. It is regarded
as unfortunate that the report of the court
is not of such a nature that it can be
acted upon finally as a whole by the See
retary of the Navy as the final reviewing
authority. In case the Secretary disap
proves of Admiral Dewey's supplemental
report it is said there would be no necessity
for returning the report to the court for
elimination, as has been suggested as a
necessary preliminary 'to such action.
It is explained that the Secretary's ap
proval or disapproval of the main report
would effectually close the Incident. so far
as the official records of the Navy Depart
ment are concerned. Action -on the major
ity report alone. it 's said, would clearly
disclose the position of the Navy Depart
ment, without regard to the supplemental or
minority report. In view of the new com
plication which has arisen, it is not regard
eu as likely Secretary Long will be able to
act in the matter for several days. .
Dewey Has Nothing to Say.
Admiral Dewey, president of the court,
today was asked for a statement as to the
extent to which he indorsed the findings of
the majority of the court. "I have not a
word to say," he replied, "not a word."
View of Law Omeers.
Law officers of the army and navy, while
not willing to be quoted in the matter, are
practically unanimous in the opinion that
Admiral Dewey in signing the main report
of the Schley court of Inquiry gave his
personal indorsement to every statement
of fact and expression of opinion contained
therein, with the exception only of sucli
conclusions as are contained in the so
called minority report expressing his indi
vidual opinion and findings.
These officers say that their conclusion on
this particular point is in conformity with
the Invariable practice of courts of law
with regard to all documents or 'papers
signed by an individual as the representa
tive of himself and others.
It is said at the Navy Department that in
the absence of any statement by Admiral
Dewey to the contrary it will be officially
consIdered that he indorsed all the state
menits of facts, findings and the recom
mendation, signed by him as president of
the court. except where he specifically ex
pressed contrary views or findings in his
short individual report.
From Secretary Long down all the of
ficials of the Navy Department decline to
comment on the Schley report in any man
ner or form, except that Captain Lemly
and one or two others expressed their
views briefly as to Admiral Dewey's in
dorsement of the court's findings.
The Conrt's Reeommendation.
The brief "recommendlation" is accepted
as the action of the full court, inasmuch
as it explicitly states that "the court rec
ommends no further proceedings be had in
the premises." Thereupon a question arises,
if that is the unanimous recommendation of
the court, why was it separated from the
main report if that document also was the
unanimonus lurgment of the court;, except'
in so far as the separate report of Admiral
Dewey is concerned.
Another point that is made against the
separation of'the reports into three parts
is that while Admiral Dewey personally
says that Admiral Schley "was In absolute
command (at Santiago) and is entitled to
the credit due to such commanding officer
for the glorious victory, which resulted
in the total destruction of the Spanish
ships," he, inferentially, at least, joined
with his colleagues In the recomme'ndation.
The phraseology of the recommendation, as
understood by some naval officers, means
practically that the court would have rec
ommended further proceedings, but for "the
length of time which has elapsed sInce
the occurrence of the events of the Santi
ago campaign." In other words, that the
court might have recommended Admiral
Schley's trial by court-martial, but for
the statute of limitations which Cona
against offenses occurring more than two
years ago.

RESTRAINT OF ANARCHISTS
At the opening of today's session of the
Senate, the chaplain, in his invocation,
made a fervent plea for the restoration tp
health of Senator Sewell, who is critically
iII at his home in New Jersey.
A resolution offered by Mr. Clay (Ga.) di
recting- the Secretary of War to make a
survey of Plantation and Clubb creeks, Ga.,
with a view of making them navigable for
river steamers was agreed to.
Another resolution offered by Mr. Clay.
directing the Postmaster General to send
to the Senate a complete statement of the
amounts paid by the -United States govern-:
-ment to various steamship lines for mail
service, together with copies of the con-:
tract in each case, also was agreed to.
A resolution offered by Mr. Nelson (Minn.).
requc::th-g the President to send to the Sen
ate a copy of the report of Ambassador
Choate relative to certain charges imposed
by "London dock companies upon American
flour and other Amerikan products shipped
to that port" was adopted.
Congress and Anarchists.
Mr. Vest (Mo.) called up his resolution
offered ten days ago instructing the ju
diciary committee to inquire into and re
port to the Senate, by bill or otherwise,
as to the proper action by Congress upon
the subject of anarchy and anarchists. He
said he did not desire at this time to enter
upon a discussion of the subject. Indeed
he did not feel qualified to discuss it until
he had heard from tly judiciary committee.,
The resolution raised these questions:
"Has Congress the 'constitutional power
to legislate for the punishment of an
aichists who assassinate or attempt to as
sassinate the President of the United
States, and if not, whether it is expedient
to amend the federal Constitution to en
able Congress so to legislate?
"Whether it is necessary to empower
Congress to prevent the teaching of an
archists that' all governments should be de
stroyed, and the chief rulers of such gov
ernments assassinated?
"Whether it is necessary that - Congress
shall have power to puni-h persons belong
ing to anarchical associations?
"What amendments, if any, are neces
sary, to the naturalization laws to prevent
anarchists from becoming citizens of the
United States, and whether such anarchists
should, after trial and conviction be im
prisoned or deported from the United
States?
"Whether it is necessary to confer upon
Congress the power to establish a penal
colony where persons convicted of anarchy
shall be confined during life?"
Without discussion or comment the reso
lution was adopted.
Open Diseussion Advocated.
Mr. .Clapp (Minn.) called up his resolution
providing that further discussion of the
pending Hay-Pauncefote treaty should be
had In open session.
Addressing the Senate briefly, he said
that while the resolution was not introduced
as a joke, the country regarded the execu
tive sessions of the Senate as a farce. He
did not think there was any occasion, under
ordinary conditions, for secret sessions of
the Senate. Despite every effort of the
Senate the American people did obtain re
ports of- secret sessions. While his resolu
tion, he believed, would be shelved, he was
of opinion that the executive sessions "will
become a part of the tradition and rubbish
of this great people of ours."
Mr.- Mason (111.) coincided with the views
expreSsed by Mr. Clapp and declared' that
the Senate's executive sessions were an
"ancient barnacle" which ought to be
swept away.
Mr. Mason was interrupted by Mr. Money
(Miss.), who raised a point of order against
discussion of the subject in open sessicn,
but finally the resolution was referred. on
motion of Mr. Spooner (Wis.), to the com
mittee on rules.
In Exective Session.
Then, at 12:12 p.m., the Senate went into
executive session to consider the Hay
Pauncifote treaty.
Mr. Teller Addresses the Senate.
When the resolution providing for the
ratification of the treaty was laid before
the Senate Mr. Teller (Col.) addressed the
Senate. He expressed confidence that the
resolution would be adopted, and said that
while he had no purpose to attempt to pre
vent that result he was convinced that
there are very few senators who are really
satisfied with the treaty. With Great
Britain In her present mood he believed, he
said, that it would have been possible to
secure a treaty which would give entire
satisfaction, and he sharply criticised the
State Department for failing to do so. He
took the position that it would have been
sufficient to abrogate the Clayton-Buiwer
treaty, and said that Erngland knew well
enough that with that result accomplished
she could very well trust the United States
to maintain the neutrality of the canal as
this country had been prepared to do so
for many years.

AT THE WHITE HOUSE
Considering Charges Fikd Against
Recorder Cheatham
IRF. JERIS DPENDS HER HSBIND
Conferences on Officeholders in
Southern States.
SOME OF TODAY'S CALLERS
President Roosevelt spent some time to
day in considering charges that have been
formally filed at the White' House against
Henry P. Cheatham, recorder of deeds of
the District of Columbia. This investiga
tion is being conducted in the same manner
as in all cases where charges have been
filed, and the object of the investigation is
either to find the charges untrue, so that a
renomination may be made, or see if they
are of sufficient importance to warrant the
withholdlng of another term from the re
corder. The consideration of the charges
was by the President and Attorney General
Knox, and with them was Senator PriLch
ard, the personal friend of Cheatham. As
intimated heretofore in The Star. the
charges are partly the result of personal
feeling engendered in the recorder's office.
Some years ago a 'son of Bishop Arnett
of the colored M. E. Church was made a
head clerk in the effice.' According to the
friends of - Cheatham. young Arnett soon
grew. to regard himself as of importance
in.the office. and in the course of time, it
is alleged that he laid- plans to succeed
Cheatham himself or have some one else
do so. Several months ago young Arnett
desired to succeed Col. Geo-tre F. Schayer.
the assistant recorder, who has been in
the office for many years, but the story is
that Recorded Cheatham refused to make
this change, declaring that Col. Schayer
was efficient and ought not to be chaiged.
Young Arnett then went to the White
House and made complaints against Cheat.
ham. Shortly afterward he resigned his
office. He and his friends, backed by
Bishop Arnett, promptly began a fight on
Cheatham, charging that he has ignored
the negro race in his appointments. and
making other charges affecting his charac
ter. The hearing today is the result of
these.
The matter was not definitely considered
and went over until.another time. Cheat
ham's friends have exerted no effort in his
behalf. but will do so, it is said, if there is
any likelihood of the charges making trou
ble for him.
A Talk With Mrs. Jenkins.
Mrs. Jennie Smith, the ra-Iroad evangelist,
went to the White House today with Mrs.
Jenkins. wife of Gov. Jenkins of Oklahoma,
who was recently removed from his posi
tion because of charges: preferred against
him here. The President made a statement

FLOOD IS RECEDING
Beached Its Crest at Pittsburg Early
This Morning.
THE COLD ip Wks OPPORTUI
But for That Much Damage
Wou!d Have Been Done
HIGH WATER ELSEWHERE
PITTSBURG. Pa.. December 1.--The
crest of the flood and the lowest point
touched this winter by the mercury were
both registered at the same hour. A a.m..
when the Smithfield street brkige marks
showed 25 feet 8 Inches of water in the
Monongahela river, and the government
thermometer indicated 7 degrees above
zero.
The rivers are now falling here, and at
the headwaters. and the temperature is
steadily rising.
A flood and cold wave at the same time
is almost unprecedented. and only the sud
den drop in the temperature averted one of
the greatest floods in the history of Pitts
burg.
As it was, the lower parts of the Point
district and Duquesne way and lowlands
along the Monongahela river. south side.
were submerged. In Allegheny the river
front was entirely under water. iluding
Pittsburg and Western railroad, Lacock,
Robinson. Hope. Balkan, Walnt. Cherry.
Madison and River avenues. The cellars
in many houses were flooded amid people
were compelled to move.
For the rivermen and dweller. along the
river banks of Pittsburg and Allegheny it
was the most fearful night experienced In
many years. Similar conditions have been
Practically unknown to this generation.
Suffering Ans RIves- Mem.
Hundreds of men tolled all night, with gt
gantic coal tows. tied up to the land
ings on both sides of all three rivers, in the
face of a bitterly cold wind. Drenched at
times with the splashes of foam, their
clothes froze on them immediately. and the
suffering was awful.
Never in the history of Pittsburg was
there such a flood on such a night. The
rains and snow of the past three days
caused the upper tributaries of the local
rivers to swell, and the result was a rise
almost unknown at this season of the year.
Warning was sent out from the weatl'.'r
bureau that a flood stage was possible. and
even probable, but the suddenness with
which the cold air descended on Saturday
night influenced the minds of the men who
were guarding the big coal fleet., and - he
rise came as almost a complete surprise
to them. Usually a cold snap takes all the
life and danges out of a Rood. It failed to
do so yesterday. and as a result the fresh.'t
will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars
that might have been saved.
The damage to ge ln tt!e -wmes. In
warehouses. 'tores and private houses in
the two cities will never be known. It wiu
probably reach $.lO. In addition to this,
many mills and factories along both rive--s
were forced to close down temporarily, and
thousands of men and women will be out
of work from one to three days. and much
damage done to machinery and finished
stoch
Dasmage at other Pwient.
At all points along the rivers reports of
damage from the high water have been
received. For a distance of half a mile
along the river at Brinton the cellar* (f
houses were completely filled with water
last night, and in some instances covered
floors of the buildings. Water stood two
and one-half feet deep in the pits of the
American Steel and Wift Company's plant
at Braddock, and.the floors were partly in
undated. The plant of the Monongahela
IAght and Power Conpany, at Rankin,
were also flooded.
At Mckee's Rocks. in all the cellars west
of Chartiers avenue, the water stood three
feet deep.
In Esplen many cellars were flooded.
About six hundred feet of the newly-built
northbound track of the Pittsburg and Lake
Erie railroad went down. An army of
Italians was at once set to work to repair
the damage. The tracks of the Southern
Traction Company were covered with water,
but the cars were not prevented from run
ning.
Herr's Island was partly submerged. but
it was not necessary to remove the cattle
from the stock yards. At Sharpsburg cel
lars were flooded, and in many houses the
water was on the Arst foors.
As a result of the flood several plants
along Penn avenue and in the West En!
are closed today, throwing thousands of
employes idle.
Plants Whieh Were Emmndated.
Among the more important of these are
the United States steel plant. ;3id streetl
Carbon steel plant, 32i street ; Bailey-Brown
puddling works, 16th street; American steel
and wire plant, 37th street; Diamond steel
plant and Zug's sable Iron works, 13th
stret.
Between 2Dth and 38d streets all the cel
tars of the houses are flooded, in most In
stances the water rising to the height of
three feet.
In the West End several departmsents of
the Singer-Namrnic Plant of the Crucible
Steel Company were closed and Painter's
No. 0 cotton tie mill of the Amnerican Steel
Hoop Company was idle.
