THE i'KKSHJKN r » MESSAGE.
The Postt-1 ntell igenccr furnish, s its
readers this morning the full text of
President Me Kin ley's message deliv
ered to congress at noon yesterday. A
very accurate outline «'f Us principal
features from tin Washington corre
. spondent of the liigencer, Mr.
Allan B. Slauson, was pubis: hej«l Sun
day morning. The message is neces
sarily of considerable length. It is In
teresting. but it is not on the who!**
anything more than a detailed review
of the state of the nation. The public
will look with the moat eagerness for a
disclosure of the president's plans for
the government of the newly acquired
territory, but it will be disappointed.
Peace negotiations not being completed.
It would be manifestly improper for the
president to discuss plans for governing
territory that has not >et been formally
ceded, or the conditions of the cession
ratified by the senate. In this connec
tion the president sa\s:
"I do rot dis< u;> at thi* time the govern
ment or the futurt of the n.-w po*s«-**i ns
whlrh will come to u.- - « a:- the result of the
war with Spain. Sue t a >1 i H isslon will be

gress has legislab .1 oth< 1 wis. . It will be my
g.duty to continue the military gov-mment
which has existed e our i« upatlon and
give- its people security In life and proper y
and encotiraKeinvnt un.l. i a Ju.-t and ben
eficent rule."
With this the country will have to be
content until the matter conv properly
before congress f.>r discussion.

In his annual report Commodore En
dicott objects to the present location
of the Puget sound naval station be
cause it has no raiiroad connections. It
is well known that several proposed
lines have been surveyed down the Kit
sap peninsula, any one of whinh can be
built at very moderate expense. That
•ome one of these lines will be con
structed in the near future is certain.
The government need not hesitate to g )
ahead with any desired developments
b#" ause of lack of raiiroad facilities, for
they will be ready when needed. Arid,
wh'-n constructed, the government will
have the choice of at least four indepen
dent transcontinental railroads over
which to ship men and freight, thus in
suring reasonable rates always.
At San Francisco the entire transcon-
tinental business is in the firm grasp
of one gigantic corporation,whose motto
is to charge "a'l that the traffic will
bear." This fact accounts in measure
for the wonderfully rapid increase of
commerce on Puget sound.
The commodore inveighs against wa
ter transportation, and yet barges of
freight cars can be seen by hundreds
in New York harbor and many other
places All the freight of the Central
and California Pacific railroads crosses
the Sacramento river ar.d bay of San
Francisco on transfer boats. In the
quiet waters of Puget sound it would be
just as easy to have a transfer boat for
loaded cars from Seattle to Port Or
chard as It is from Oakland to San
Francisco, or from Benicia to Port
Costa.
I'uic<*t sound I» several hundred
miles nmrer J«|ian and Northern
China than san Francisco and
Southern California. The Empress
line of steamers from \ ictoria
makes the trip nerons the Pacific
In one-fourth less time than the
Pacific Sfnil front San Francisco.
As Japan, Korea and Northern
Chi mi will prohahl y he the locality
off naval demonstrations ffor years
to come. It will he wise to have one
■a*y yard as near the scene off
operations as possible.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCES TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1898.
is so much in love that she will sacri
fice her life rather than suffer depriva
tion of the object. It cannot be defend
ed upon moral grounds, yet there is a
sort of heroism in it. It is the same
spirit which animated the Christian
martyr. There, no doubt, the motive
was hfgher, but it could not be more
pure or more disinterested. There cer
tainly could not be a more decided
proof of fidelity; and if the spirits are
to travel the road to the hereafter, sure
ly these two may travel together to the
throne where she may plead that in her
sin, if suicide be sin. she wronged no
one and had helped to carry out her
idea of the Creator that man and
woman were created for each other;
that she loved this man, and that with
out love her marriage to another would
be a worse offense against her own
soul.
Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, is vio
lently opposed to the annexation of the
Philippines, and recently said in effect that
if we permanently occupy the Philippines
the downfall of the American republic will
date from the aiiartnit'tration of "William
McKinley. Nearly eighty-eight years ago
another learned and distinguished states
man from Boston made almost identically
the san:e prediction concerning the effect of
the annexation of the territory of Louis
tana. January 14, 1811, Josiah Qulncy, of
Massachusetts, speaking in the national
house of representatives in opposition to
the bill for the admission of Louisiana,
said:
"1 am compelled to declare It as my de
liberate opinion that if th.s bill passes the
bonds of this union are virtually dissolved;
tiiat the states which compose it are frea
frcrn their moral obligations, and that, as
It will be the rigiit of all, so It will be the
duty of some to prepare definitely for a
separation, amicubiy if they can, violently
if they must."
Mr. Quincy further said:
"This constitution never was and never
can be strained to lap over all the wilder
ness of the West without affecting both the
rights and tiie conveniences of the real pro
prietor.-. It was never constructed to form
a cover for the inhabitants of the Mis
souri and tie Red river country, ar.d when
ever It is attempted to be stretched over
them it wiil be rent asunder."
Mr. Quincy also spoke of the residents
of those sections in the same way that the
opponents of permanent occupation cf the
Philippines are now talking of the inhab
itants of these Spanish colonies A century
hence the citizen of the Greater United
States of that time will read the gloomy
predictions of Senator Hoar with the same
curious interest with which we read the
predictions of Josiah Quincy, made nearly
a century ago, and with the same com
ment: "Pessimism Is old, very old."
Tt Is surprising how little enthusiasm is
manifested in Germany with regard to the
return of the Imperial pilgrims from the
Holy Land. An attempt to concert meas
ures for a public welcome in Berlin fell flat,
tt veral of the newspapers calling attention
to the fact that of the eight members of
the committee five were court tradesmen,
and two of them high police officials. An
other paper explained the singular lack of
public enthusiasm by the fact that the
kaiser was not returning home from a cru
sade, but merely from a cook's tour.

The Port-Intelligencer on Sunday morn
ing made a omment upon President Hill
which he very soon after justified. It said
that while he was reticent as to what he
intended to do, he was usually very frank

did not mince words when he denounced
the absurd story that he was going to ex
tend the Great Northern to Taeoma.

to a messmate, "I've dropped my hat in
the crick." The "crick" was the Atlantic
ocean.
Now that the mar is practically over,

A REPLY TO CUMEGIB.
Senator Poraker replies to the tirade of
Mr. Carnegie a trains! the annexation of the
Philippines and to the allegation of that
gentleman that the constitution absolutely
prohibits the "open dsor" policy, in an in
terview recently, as follows:
"Mr. Carnegie is a strong, vigorous and
forceful man. whose opinions are entitled
to the highest respect, but he is manifestly
greater in commerce ani manufacture than
as a constitutional lawyer. He rails at ihe
open door policy in the Philippines, not
only because he thinks It tt a had business
policy, but also, and particularly, because,
as he asserts, it is in violation of the con
stitution. As to whether it is good or bad
business policy, men may differ, but as to
the constitutional question, that is another
matter, and one about which there is no
room for controversy, as Mr. Carnegie will
quickly leßrn when he takes the question
into the courts, as he threatens to do."
Senator Fbraker then quotes the language
of the constitution applicable to the case
as follows:
"But all duties, imposts and excises shall
he uniform throughout the United States."
(Art. 3, Sec. S, United States constitution),
and comments as follows: "Thus it is seen
that the language employed by the consti
tution is, that ail such duties shall be uni
form throughout the United States, not the
United Stares and the territories. Section
3. Article 4. provides that congress shall
have power to make all needful rules and
regulations respecting the territoiies and
other property belonging to the United
States. This clause confers on the congress
plenary power to deal with each territory
according to its position and condition and
requirements, and is another illustration of
the wisdom and foresight of the men who
framed and established our government.
The constitution further provides, in Arti
cle S, 'that all treaties made, and which
shall he made under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of
the land.' Under this clause, if the treaty
about to be entered into should so provide
and be ratified, the open door policy of the
Philippines could be established beyond
peril of Mr. Carnegie's lawsuit."

Whut She Thought of.
Little Marjorie is by no means fond of
going to church. She his to sit too still
and "the man" talks about things she can
not understand.
"What's it for, mamma?" she asked one
day. "What do we go to church for?"
.Mamma tried to. tell her the reasons, and
concluded by saying:
"And when you cannot understand what
the minister means you must remember he
is talking about good and beautiful things;
and you must make up your mind to think
of something good yourself."
That day Marjorie was very quiet in
f'hiirch and her mother praised her for it
on the way home.
"I did as you told me," said the wee
maid- "I thought of something good."
"Wnat was it. dearie?"
"Appio pie."—Cincinnati Enquirer.
