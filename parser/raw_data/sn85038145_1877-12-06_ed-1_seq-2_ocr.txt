The Secretary of the Treasury, John
Sherman, recommends the issuing of sil

best resumption act Congress could pass.

U. S. Senator are accumulating. After
the organization of the legislature, noth-
ing of interest to the people will be trans
acted until the Senatorial question is set
tled, that will for the time being, absorb
everything else.
It is not true, as claimed, by the repeal
of the date clause of the resumption act,
that it3 friends are in favor of greenback
inflation, or that the repeal -of the date
clause means Inflation or repudiation of
specie payments; it simply means no con
traction of the circulating medium to a
degree that wrll injuriously effect the1 le
gitimate business of the country. The
, friends of the repeal are in favor of the
reruonetization of silver coin, and mak
ing a silver dollar worth as much as a
gold dollar, thus furnishing the means
with which to redeem paper money when
the holder desires to make the exchange.
Specie Resumption
The only difference that we know of
between Republicans on the question of
resumption of specie payments is, as to
the time when to resume. All, we be
lieveare in favor of resumption some
in 1879, and others at any time when it
can be done without contracting the cir
culating medium to a degree that will In
jure the business interests of the country
We know that a portion of the Republi
cans claim that the near approach to the
game value of the paper currency and
gold is owing to the ettects of the specie
resumption law of 1875. If that law has
resulted in the contraction of the paper
currency, it has, to that extent, had its
lufluence in bringing the two mediums
to their present relative value; but, if it
, has not contracted the circulation of the
paper currency, we fail to see how that
. law has produced the Tesults claimed for
it. But, while this may have been the re-
suit, to some extent, we are inclined to
the opinion that the near approach of the
two mediums of currency to the same
value has its origin in the fact that, in
eluding the nresent year, there has
for three years, been a large bal
ance of trade, between this and foreign
countries in favor of the United States
. There has been no demand for large
amounts of gold made upon us with which
to pay balances of trade against us, and,
as long as we can keep a large balance on
the credit side of our accounts with our
neighbors, and demand from them the
., coin with which to balance the accounts,
we will be in a healthy financial condi
tion, and the margin between the value
of our National paper and gold will be re
duced to a trifling figure.
.Now, 11 Congress will remonetize sil
ver coin and make a silver dollar as good
as any other dollar, and be prepared to
leave a silver dollar or a gold dollar in
the place of every paper dollar that may
be
retired, won't our doors be onen to
redemption ; won't we be in a condition to
resume specie payment for all the paper
money the holders of that currency may
desire to exchange? But, the greatest
fear to be apprehended is that we may be
come Improvident, and over-reaching in
: our anxiety to extend our trade and com
merce with our Atlantic cousins, and per
mit them, in the settlement of accounts,
' to figure up a balance of trade against us,
for which they will make heavy drafts
upon us for gold with which to meet these
balances. In that case, those who fatten
upon gold corners, will be able to prac
tice their "tricks in trade" upon us to an
extent that will drain from us our precious
metals, and demand a high rate of per
centage for the coin with which to meet
balances on our accounts; but, with the
balance of trade on our side, silver re
monetized, and its volume judiciously in
. creased, and made equal to the payment
- of all debts, public and private, where
contracts are not differently made, there
- will not, in our view, be any difficulty in
. resuming specie payment, at no distant
day; for, whenever the facilities are at
hand with which to resume, the holder of
our National bank currency, or the Na
tional greenback currency, will not be
anxious to exchange his paper currency
for coin ; he will not be like we used - to,
in the days of local banking institutions,
afraid of loseing his money by the
failure of the bank, because he knows
that ever dollar's worth of property be
longing to the people of this Government
is pledged for the redemption of this class
of paper currency. We used to exchange
' our local bank paper for coin, because we
were afraid it would die in our pockets
within 24 hours; we used to exchange it
lor other currency, or for coin, when we
wanted to travel beyond the limits of our
owri State It was not current out of ir.a
own neighborhood; but the kind of paper
" .currency we now have is worth as much
in San Francisco as it is in. Boston. Good
all over the Union, and nobody fears to
hold it, because it is a sound, healthy me
dium. .,,
PRESIBEXT H41F.V nESUGE.
The annual message of the President
has been received. It makes more than
six columns of fine print in the Cincin
nati Gazette. We have not time nor room
to give it in this week's Herald, but the
reader will get a good understanding of
it from the following summary, which
we take from the Cincinnati Gazette:
Several things combine to interest ex
pectancy of the first annual message of
President Hayes. First, it is the first oc
casion he has had to speak to the country
on that which is called the Southern pol
icy, with regard to which it would be
vain to try to conceal that there is widely
prevalent among those who have consti
tuted the backbone of the Republican
party a feeling of discontent, or discour
agement, or outspoken condemnation,
with but little of the diversity of hearty
commendation. This we state as a fact,
without affirming its justice. The message
affirms with confidence that the policy
was best for sectional fraternization, was
in harmony with the Constitution, was
best under the circumstances, that its be
neficent results are apparent, that it is
not an experiment, that all danger from
remitting the lately revolted States to lo
cal self-government is now removed, and
that the fruits have already justified this
course, as time will vindicate it in the
public mind.
As to resumption, the message i3decid
edly against any wavering of purpose, or
any backward step. As to the silver ques
tion, the message holds that the bonds are
all in good faith payable in gold coin or
its equivalent, and also that more can be
gained by good faith, by reducing the
rate of interest, than by impairing our
credit by declaring them payable in sil
ver. It is for the monetization of silver
to such an extent as can he with an equal
ity in the value of gold and silver coins,
but regards it impracticable to so adjust
their values as that they can be kept equiv
alent if silver shall be unlimited in coin
age and legal tender. We suppose this
is the view of all rational and honest men.
But there are some who are captivated by
the idea of cheating the public creditor,
and in this aim they would cheat our
selves. The President declares his intention to
adhere to the principles of reform of the
civil service, by reforming the manner of
appointments and removals, and observ
ing the plan of the Constitution, which
imposes upon the Executive the sole duty
responsibility of selecting officers;
also, to make all nominations as nearly
as possible impersonal, in the sense of
being free from caprice or favor in these
directions, and to have such a rule for
tenure, of office as shall induce persons
of proper qualifications to become pro
ficients in their duties. To this end he
asks the co-operation of the Senate and
House, and he also recommends an appro
priation to renew the work of the Civil
Service Commission, which, it appears, is
still in existence.
This makes the four topics concerning
which tfiere was most interest. In our
foreign relations- there are few subjects
of interest. We have withheld recogni
tion from thede lacto government of Hex
ico, President Diaz, because of depreda
tion? on the Rio Grande border, and we
have undertaken to discipline the bandits
by pursuing them in Mexican territory
This makes our relations with that coun
try rather precarious. Spain has not yet
put down the insurgents in Cuba, and the
effort causes much annoyance to our ship
ping, but Spain promptly makes repara
tion for injuries, when a case is made
From foreign relations the President
passes to the finances. The revenue has
a surplus large enough to make the regu
lar addition to the sinking fund that
childish contrivance of finance by which
a debt is to seem to pay itself. He joins
Mr. Sherman in recommending a tax on
tea and coffee, by which a multitude of
little annoying taxes can be taken off.
This is a sensible revenue policy, but the
demagogue humhug of a "free breakfast
table" catches the ignorant, who know
not that everything they eat," drink, wear,
or think of, is taxed. Besides, we have
hardly got settled from the disturbance
of the repeal of these "taxes, and to lay
them again will take a very large sura
from the people, in the higher price of
stocks on hand before the Treasury can
get any revenue. All changes in duties
are a temporary evil, even if an ultimate
good. .V '
He also recommends such a policy as
shall make it convenient and attractive
to the people to invest their savings in
the government bonds. That We have
had sixteen years of tremendous finan
ciering which has carefully avoided this
is one of the disgraces of our finance.
The message touches upon the army, na
vy, Postoffice, Indian affairs, District of
Columbia, foreign commerce,' shipping,
and a number of other business affairs.
It also recommends the creation of a na
tional.university at Washington.
The message deals plainly with the
questions of administrative conduct that
have disturbed the Republican party, and
beyond this is a plain business document.
As to that which is called the polipy,
the cessation of military intervention
was a necessity. It was an act, not an
experiment nor a policy, and it is fin
ished, and the inhabitants are at least no
worse off without than they were with it,
as it existed when Hayes came in. The
principle of civil service reform is sound,
and is comjjatible with the rational course
of choosing qualified men from the ac
tive friends of the administration, and
with proper counsel with representatives.
The position on the silver issue is the
only one that can give us both gold and
silver In the circulation, and is not only
that of good faith, but that which is most
profitable to our country. As to the re
sumption act, the President evidently
sees that it needs the aid of practical
measures, but these can not be expected
from this Congress, and he is opposed to
any backward steps. So are we, but we
want practicable' forward steps."
; A correspondent to the Cincinnati Ga
zette, from Hillsboro, of Nov. 29th, says :
"The untiring efforts of Mr. Jas. W. Dog
gett, our old and efficient Deputy U, S.
Marshal, to unravel the Hollowtown sui
cide or murder mystery have been, re
warded with complete success. . The re
maining link required to ; determine
whether the man Ramsey came to. his
death by his own hand, or was murdered,
has been found by the recovery of the val
uable mare ridden away from home by
Ramsey. She was found in the posses
sion of Daniel Fearnow, five miles north
east of Greenfield. - Mr. Fearnow states
that the animal was abandoned in the
road near his house by a person answer
ing to the description of Ramsey. nmi
who, by his strange actions, was evident
ly insane. As it was heard that he -had
sold the mare and been murdered for the
money, this solves the twolmonths
tery."
