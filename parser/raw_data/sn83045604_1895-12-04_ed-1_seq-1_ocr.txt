Tii» new complaint against the repre

it fa led. M ; h that ha# alrvady been pub
lished regarding the financial commit'* ■'*
arrang»m- n:» with Present W. B Ail-n
whereby the hank wa* given a year's time
to pay up. is included in Mr. Rnv#' charge*.
This compact between the city and the
hank was made September 1. I*o4, and by
its terms the city was barred from com
mencing suit against the hank or taking
any steps to close j; until the expiration
of a year. In con.* deration of Ih * agree
ment, the hank turned over to City Treas
urer J. VV. M Cauley, as trustee, flSl.flrt®
* A rth of securit es to I held as collateral
for the deposit, and executed a bond signed
hv 'he directors and stockholders of the
bank Two weeks before ?he expiration of
the year 'he h*nk assigned to K S. Alex
ander, wi! h asfsnmen* v. -:ihsfquenH
lv set aside and A. R. Titlow appointed re
ceiver.
Mr Roys' complaint alleges, after recit
ing !he above facts: ' That W R. Allen,
represent!ng the Rank of Tatoma. entered
Into this agreement with the finance com
mittee of the city upon the distinct under
standing and further agreement that the
< oilateral which was to tie turned over by
the bank to the city should be Inspected
and its contents known only to Cavender
and the city treasurer. If was furtt*-r un
derstood and agreed that after the colla
teral had lcen so lnsperted by Cavender
and McCauley. that if should be put in an
envelope, sealed up. placed in the vault of
the city and there remain intact unt.l the
expiration of the year t'avender never
theless. contrary to the distinct under
standing and agreement had beiween the
fin«rice committee and the Rank of Taoo
tna in relation to the collateral, permitted,
sanctioned and aided' the hank to secure
from the city treasurer a certain portion
of the collateral which had ben deposited
with the city as aforesaid, amounting to
many thousands of dollars, without any
consideration being given to the ity for
the relinquishment of the collateral secur
ity to the hank; tfcat he also aided and
a.-sis!T 'hTlWfi k Tffi.roc'iring certain oth
er of the collateral from the city treasurer
and substituting in lieu thereof entirely
new and different collateral from that
which was originally taken: that some of
the collateral taken by the bank was real
ized upon by the bunk and the money col
lected went to the use and benefit of the
bank. That among the collateral turned
over by the bank to the city was certain
collateral which the firm of Cavender \-
Fowler had given to the bank as collateral
security for loans; that Cavender permit
ted. aided and assisted the bank in pro< ur
ine the Cavender & Fowler collateral from
the city treasurer, and permitted said
bank to substitute other collateral in lieu
thereof; that K. V. Renhapi. city comp
troller. frequently requested Cavender to
permit htm to examine such collateral se
curities in the performance of his duty, in
order that he might have a Hear under
standing of the financial condition of the
city, but that Cavender wholly failed, ne
glected and refused to allow the comp
troller or any other officer save the treas
urer of the city to pee the collateral or to
know the contents thereof "

? rne time ago Mr. Poorer s :bm tted a
plan, of which the details are gtven above,
to VM- W. H Phippe. general land com
rrissioner of the Northern Pacific. Mr.
Phipps rerenHy wrote Mr. Cooper, giv
ing his proportion his approval, wi.h the
exception of 'he emigrant rate from the
E«at. whtch the commissioner said would
have to be settled by the traffic depart*
ment. Mr. O-ofer *jj asked to ad<lreea
the trustees of the Thamber of Commerce
at a special ifleeting called today, and
give them the benefit of his views on the
of promoting immigration. The
trustees met In room 115 of the Chamber
of Commerce b»f!lding at 5 o'clock this af
tPrnnon. Tr» sident W. C. Wheeler ; resid
ed and introduced the subject to be dis
cnsited.
After stating the steps he
hail taken in Mr Phlpps' approv
al of his plan, Mr. Cooper said:
"I propose that WE shall MV to Pierce
county, represented by the ("h»miwr of
Commf-re, you employ capable, trust
worthy and well Informed men to solicit
Immigration among Eastern farmer*, we
to furnish them transportation and maps
show.ng land "F" 'or settlement. The
lnf v n will he selected with care, and as
many as you are willing to pay or the
clrcuTpranc'^ s warrant. They must not
run down other prtrtions of the state, nor
will they he allowed to traffle in town lota
or encourage real esta'e booms The rail
road company will make a low rate from
the Ea«t ava lable only to bona fide set
tlers I believe this can be placed at S.O.
We shall ask no odds tn the sale of lands,
but shall offer what- we have as any one
else ha vine land to dispose of.
"The effe t of such a plan would be to
place .Washington on a footing equal to
states closer to th« center of population in
the Kast. To my mind lowa offers a most
invitee field for this work. Care should
be taken to g*t only Industrious farmers
of sufficient means to enable them to get
a start in the West. If new people <*cm:nsr
to Washing-ton will buy nart of the hold
ing* of those who are land poor, the great
est good will be accomplished It is a
big mistake for a man to tackle t«8 acr«a
of our Washington land. Kortv acres an
swers ail purposes. By increasing the
number of small farm*. there will be more
people to btrild roais art support school
houses, and much of the isolation of set
tlers w ill be done |*»y with."
r Cooper cave as his opinion that
iren fullv qualified fcr the work planned
could be secured for *ls" per month, which
would include thilr expenses. ,
The matter was taken under considera
tion bv the trustees, who will report to the
chamber, and advise what action shall be
taken.

London. Dec. 3 - The newspapers tomor
row will very generally <"ntain editorial
comments on President Cleveland s mcs
' sage to congress.
The Telegraph say>: "The crudities ana
Indiscretions of President < levels nd s
' present pronunclamento on foreign affairs
might have been evolved by the late Mr.

be more absurd than the proposal that
t'.ie Schomburgk line in Yersinia shoijld
b> submitted to arbitration? The refer
ence to Cuba is Infinitely more mjpdlclous.
It I* virtually an expression of sympathy
with filibusters."
The Times editorially says: President
, Cleveland has drawn a startling picture
i of the difficulties created by the vicious
currency svsfem. and we should be gr«at
lv surprised if the plans he suggested are
not warmly welcomed by business men
throughout the states. But. flushed by
electoral victories, it is probable enough
that the Republicans will refuse
to allow anything to be done
1n the direction Indicated. Mean
while the remainder of the message,
especially as to foreign relations, will
k've the Impression that he is marking
time. Nothing he says commits him to a
; new or acgre«slv-> policy, while it will
t.»-k the Ingenuity of his opponents to
make out that he has In any way com
promised «h» dignity or been careless of
i the Interests o f his " eonntry."
The i>ally News, the Liberal organ, will
say: "President Cleveland kno*s h*"er

is very doubtful if congress will accept
President Cleveland's currency plan. The
messaae sounds cautious, but there i* a
■welcome note tn the direction of free tr«<ie.
The reference to Armenia must be » *.ht 1-
ed as the deftnite adherence of the I'nited
States to Euroj>ean concert. Few hon-st
critics can say anvthing against
Cleveland's reference to Yenenuri« N\'e
agree with him that the boundary dispute
is eminently suite*} to arbitration, and un
doubtedly our government » il tak<* the
same view. It must be remembered that
this question is quite distinct from that •»f
the reparation due us by Veneruela for in
juries. When such reparation is made,
every Liberal In this country will acqul
<»<•<-<» m President Cleveland's doctrine,
our bands are fttll enough without in
creasing our bur lens In America, but •'so
cially at the risk of creating a serious
strain 'between ourselves and the one great
power whose friendship is- more valuable
to us than all of the others put together."
The Chronicle concludes its editorial by
asking whether America s ready to under
take the responsibility thus incurred for
the faithful discharge of their obligations
by the American republics.
