arisjec 9Senor MOntero Rios
resident 1 of the Spanish peace com
mission and Senor Ojedo secretary of
that commission are still confined to
their beds The il ness of Senor Ojeda
delays engrossing the treaty and it is
doubtful whether it will be signed be
fore Monday The Americans held their
usual session this morning
The Spaniards continue making bit
ter comments concerning President
McKinleys reference to the Maine
The Spaniards made a last contribu
tion in a recent assembling of the com
missions Senor Montero Rios thel pre
sented a vigorously worded protest in
which the Spaniards declared they had
yielded to force but that they invoked
the conscience of the nations against
the abuse of the rights of nations of
yhich they were the victims The pro
V test was for the purpose of record and
consisted of an argument in support of
every concession demanded by the
Spaniards and which the Americans re
fused some of them peremptorily and
without an opportunity of discussion
The protest concluded But these
concessions which we were obliged to
make touch us less than the insult
which has been inflicted on our nation
by President McKinley in his message
We again protest against the accusa
tion hurled against us in regar to the
Maine and we intend to again submit
the matter to an international tribunal
composed of England France and Ger
S many to determine who shall bear the
responsibility of the catastrophe
DETAILS OF THE TREATY
A correspondent of the Associated
Press approached Senor Garnica of the
Spanish commission for further details
of the treaty He said
5 The fact that you represent all the
American and English papers is really
a reason why I should say nothing But
what you show me as having been ca
bled is substantially correct The ex
act number of articles is still undeter
mined It depends upon how Secreta
ries Ojedo and Moore divide the treaty
It may be twelve or twenty articles
The Americans are to pay the indem
nity within three months of the ratifi
catron We shall appoint consuls in
Cuba Puerto Rico and the Philippine
islands without delay The Cuban
consul will be accredited to the powers
that be
Asked why the Spaniards refused to
grint tfe United State a coaling sta
tion ill the Carolinas Senor Garnica
saidThe
The Americans could hardly expect
that WE > shouldagree to discuss matters
outside of the protocol after the lea
lrLs we have had from them on this
oint When we wished to discuss the
Cuban debt they alJsolutel refused to
consider it and then they ask us for
whatever they want
Que el toupe what cheek Yet the
Cuban debt remains an important ques
tion far settlement
In regard to the Spaniards final pro
test on the subject of the Maine Senor
S
Gal11ica remarked That protest now
becomes history as it is embodied in
thE protocol We do not wish to roe
maIn under an imputation which would
perpetuate nimosity and hatred
against lIS and which would be a source
of constant irritation in Spain It is
neither loyal nor just that this thing
should hang over the reputation of
Spain We cannot submit to it It
must be cleared up in justice to our
selves There are many other causes
to bring hatred between the two na
tions without the addition of such a
one as this
0
As to the future relations of the two
countries that is one of the things
histoty alone can determine Many
nations which have been deadly ene
mies are speedily reconciled
Senor Garnica was questioned as to
the future of the Philippine islands and II
he said
The United States hM inaugur ted I
a policy which wlll bring it JDuch
trouble and many responsibilities The
Americans are not prepared for the
work tiey are about to undertake
Your democratic system must inaugu
rate an imperialistic and bureaucratic
system and you must increase your
army and navy with the result that
there will be constant friction between
yourselves and the European powers
I The AmerIcans preserve secrecy re
garding the terms of the treaty This
is partly through the influence of the
three senators on the body who rep
resent that it would be discourtesy to
the senate to publish the terms before
the treaty is presented to that body by
the president
TheprotocoI of the treaty will almost
reach the dimensions of a volume as it
will contain every written statement
presented on both sides during the con
ferences
In spite of the secrecy observed by
the Americans it is learned that the
treaty in substance consists of thir
teen or fourteen articles TIH principal
articles provide for the cession and
evacuation of Cuba Puerto Rico and
the Philippine islands and the political
administrative and financial results
thereof the acquirement by the Unit
ed States of public property aud the
I relinquishment of archives The ant
des of s econdary Importance determine
the status of Spanish subjects residing
in the ceded territories and unfinished
law suits and contracts guarantees of
the same terms to Spanish shipping and
merchandise as imposed upon American
shipping and merchandise in thc Phil
ippine islands for ten years and leav
Ing the status of Spanish commerce in
the West Indies to be settled later
An important provision is the guar
antee religious freedom in the ceded
territo in the same terms as the
Florida treaty the Americans having
steadfastly refused to incorporate an
guarantee of the United States deter
mination to favor the property of the
Catholic church leaving it subject to
the general laws as private property
Senator Gray though well known to
be radically opposed to the policy of
annexation or imperialism will vote
in the senate to ratify the treatycon
idering that his signing that docu
ment binds him to support it
Proposed Tariff Reductions
Washington Dec 9The = discussion
of the details of the administration of
government affairs in Cuba Puerto
Rico and the Philippines under the
treaty of peace which is about to be
signed In Paris occupied a large part of
the time at todays cabinet meeting
The cabinet also talked over an elab
orate tariff measure which is now in
preparation here to go into force as
now planned contemporaneously with
I the entire relinquishment of the island
I by the Spanish on Jan 1 This tariff
measure it is said will show an aver
age reduction all along the line of 50
per cent from the Spanish tariff rates
The understanding now is that there
will be no export duties and that in
other ways the burden of taxation will
be reduc
MILITARY COLLEGES I
Furnished Many Officers For the War
With Spain
Washington Dec 9The mual re
port of the inspector general of the
army made public tonight is some
what unique the exigencies of the val
hiving scattered the officers of the bu
reau from their regular duties to the
command of troops in the field and re
duced the number of inspections con
siderably
One of the interesting features of the
report is that on military olleges Fif
teen thOusand students are being annu
ally trained in practical and theoret
ical military service in private and
pUblic schools and colleges The presi
dent of fortysix of these colleges
I whose military departments numbered I
7100 students reported that twenty
nine of their regular students and fifty
nine alumni had been commissioned in
I the regular army and 157 students and I
296 alumni in the volunteer army a to
tal of 541 officers or enough for about
twelve regiments Further 1084 stu
dents and exstudents joined the army I
I I as noncommissioned officers or pri
v tes Accepting these statistics as a I
fair average it would appear says the I
I report that the regular and volunteer
armies secured from the students an
I nually instructed by regular army om
cers at the various colleges enough offi
I cers for twentyfour regiments In
conclusion on this subject the inspec
tor general says that some substantiJ
recognition should be accorded the stu
dents who spend a large part of their
school life in military study and he
recommends the selection of some of
I the best of these students for appoint
I ment annually In the army Such a
policy he says would benefit both the
I students he cOlleges and the govern
I ment

New York Dec 9R G Dun Cos
weekly review of trade will say to
morrow The most significant thing
this week WM the entire absence of
the customary nervous fright before I
or after the meeting of congress the i
presidents message and the tre3mrers
report No one showed the least alarm
and nobody could find occasion for any
Money and stock and grain makes
moved on exactly as if the government
were automatic certain to Jo or say
no more than the people had alinady
decided and expected There is a
larger demand for products in nearly all
the great ndustries larger expo t de
mand for foreign needs a more healthy
domestic demand since seasonable
weather arrived anda comfnciig con
viction that November bUSlllSS the
biggest ever done in this couniy in
any month was but a step tow ard
something better
Exports last year in December were
marvelops but this year are starting
far ahead The Atlantic wheat fX
ports flour included have leen for the
week 5636767 bushels against 4312137
last year and Pacific exports 556523
bushels against 793083 last year and
prices have declined 2c for cash but
western receipts of 10135109 bushels
against 63134 from last years great I
crop stops argument The wheat does
not come out at low prices or the peo
ple have less to sell than last year at
20 cents more per bushel
Woolen goods have been in much bet
ter demand and many of the smaller
mills have been buying after conces
sions secured by the larger The much
broader market is more healthy and
promises far more for the industry and I
sales of 10655200 pounds in two weeks
pat at the three chief markets against
10852700 pounds in the same weeks of
1892 are quite in line with the demand
in prosperous years Prices yielded I
about half a cent in November accord
ing to 100 quotations by Coates Bros5
and from Philadelphia dispatches I
appear to be about a cent lower this
week
The rupture of the inchoate rail
combination it appears resulted in
lower prices and larger sales in the
first week of sharp competition than
were realized a week ago Prices were
made in some transactions much lower
than were then or are nm quoted and
while 17 at Pittsburg is now named
special orders are said to command
lower figures The purchase of 150000
tons Bessemer pig at 10 at valley
furnaces and 100000 tons billets for
Pittsburg works at 1550 of which 40
000 tons went to a hoop mill with 11
000 tons rods at Chicago at 22 and 22
000 tons plates for one concern at Pitts
burg besides enormous orders for bars
and plates in car and shipbuilding
steam contract on the Delaware and a
contract for 5000 tons for bridges at
Chicago give some idea of the heavy
business coming forvard ji1ist when the
works usually expect a period of idle
ness and waiting Pig iron has risen at
the east to 1150 and quotations for
pig throughout the country a shade
higher than at any time this year
though prices for finished products
have recently been declining and are
lower than in the early months of the
year I
This weeks failures have been 248 in
the United States against 312 last year I
i and 22 in Canada against 29 last year
REVIEW SPECULATION
Stock Market Was Strong But
Showed Some Irregularity
New York Dec 9Bradstreets
financial review will say tomorrow
Transactions in both stocks and bonds
I
this week have been active and the
market shows a broadening tendency
Influenced by Investll1ent purchasing
Drices in the bond list have advanced
while dividendvaying stocks or those
I which are expected to take that Dosi
tim are also being absorbed to some
extent by permanent holders Public
and foreign participation on the bull
side renders the market as a whole
less susceptible to professional manipu
lation but in spite of its generally
strong tone the movement of prices
during the week leaves the im1ression
of irregularity The securities which
ordinarily lead the market are jess
prominent and most of the features
were supplied by specialties and stocks
which have held a subordinate post
tion The speculative undertone has
been very strong however and any
slight depressions seem to develop re
newed buying Dower London shows
increasing favJl for American stocls
and its purchasing has been sufficiently
steadr to give material aid to the bull
side The ease of the money market
here facilitates buying by the public
althou2h the fact that stocks are be
ing carried to an unusual extent on
call loans docs not escape attention It
I may be added that the activity and
advances in so maiiy lowDriced and
hitherto inactive stocks increases the
I proportion of such securities carried On
margin or in loans but as yet no dan
ger is apparently aDorehendci from
that source The market at lamge is
impressed only with the favrahle fin
ejgn trade situation the encouraging
business outlook the abuntaiie of tap
ital seeking investment and the excel
lent earnings which railroads are gan
orally reorting Actual and p05siIJJe
dividend payments by aHroa1 anti in
dustrial companies also playa part ill
sustaining the decidedly bullish feeling
I of the market and the nore prominpllt
operators are generally active on hat
side of the account or if they tak
Drofits in one Dart if tlH list do ic
to transfer their attention to other
stocks
The meeting of congnss seemed to
produce little effect the nrivaitnt idea
betag that its time would be taken up
with war and colonial litBstions min
imizing the possibility of measures bp
lag considered which mi1tt have an
unfavorable effect On busines and
financial sentiment The presidents
message was favorably received and
the exnected speedy signing of the
treaty of peace with Spli was a fac
tor in causing the very strong tone at
the end Ol the week
