embracing many leading business men.
After the Chairman had pronounced the

and a few others manifested some resist
ance to the police, and were ejected from
the platform and b&lL.
During the uproar, ReT. J. Stelli Martin
announeed that a meeting would be held in
his church in the evening. In response to
this announcement, the Baptist Church
(colored) on Jay street, wag filled at an
early hoar. The edifice was small, and a
Urge proportion of the audience were black.
Here Wendell Phillips, John Brown, Jr.,
Fred.Dortglas and otherleading John Brown
sympathizers, ventilated their opinions
freely, with little interrup'ion. A woman
named Chapman appeareo to preside. Sev
eral policemen were stationed in the church.
Outside there was an immense crowd and
strong force of police. The disturbance
was confined to noisy demonstrations,
though the crowd seemed very anxious te
get hold of Kedpath. The meeting broke
up about 10 o'clock, and the audience dis
persed quietly. Some of the leading spirits
were hooted at While passing through the
outside crowd, but no violence was cemro it
ted. Frank B. Sanborn was aoting Presi
dent or tne meeting.
In anticipation of a riot, the second bat-
tallionof infantly was held in readiness at

SYNOPSIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
feAUK.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
After alluding to the great ootnmercial. agri
cultural and fiber material protperitit of the
country, the l'reaideuu alu why it la then, that
dwoontant now ao exteiuively prevails, and tiia
uuiou of the btatea which hi the tourae of all theaa
hl iug la threatened with d etraction, llie
loug ouutiBued and ititemiwrata interference of
the uorturen people with the question of slavery
iu the Southern Mates, haa at U-uKth produced ita
natural fttecu. The dincreut etauof the Union
are now arrayed aguiu.l each other, aud the time
has arrived, ao much dreaded by the lathers ol
the country, when hostile geographical partie
hare been formed. 1 hi. doe not proceed Milrly
from the claim on the part ot .'or.grwts or tin ter
ritorial legislatures to exclude slavery 1'rem the
territories, nor lroul the edurt of the dltlerent
Mate the execution ol the ui:!tive blare Law,
but the immediate peril ari trom IneeMant and
violent egttatiouo! theslavcrv question through
out uie North tor the last quarter of a century,
has produced iu malign lncueuce on the slaves,
and iwpires them with vague notions of freedom,
hience a sense ot security no louder exists aroaud
the xiuuily altar. This fveiiug of peace at hoiua
has giveu place to appreheuRluns ol servile inur
reciious. Many a matron throughout the boutb
retires at niffht in dread of what may befall her
self and children before the morning. Should
his apprehension of domesl 10 dnuirer exist and
intenvify iuteelf until It shall pervade the mantes
of Southern people, then disunion will become in
ev liable, belt preservation is the first law of na
ture, and no political uuion however fraught with
blessings and beuenut in all otlier reepeota, can
longer conliuue, aud tha neceesary ooaiejuence
be to render tha homes and nreeidea of nearly
half of the parties to U are habitnally and hope
lessly insecure, aeenre. booner or later the bonds
of such a Union must be aevered. It la my con
viction that this fatal period has not yet arrived.
After reierriug to the incessant agitation against
slavery at the North for the last twenty. live years,
both by preea and the people, and asserting that
Congress at occupied with violent speeches on
this neverending subject, he Veinarka how
easy it would b lor the American peo
pie to settle this slavery queetiou, aud restore
peace and harmony to tins distracted country,
which can be done by letting them alone aud
permitting them to manage their own State af
fairs, as tuey only only are responsible before
God for slavery existing among them, and with
which the North has no more right to Interfere
than with tha similar institulioiie in Russia or
brazil, aud the President still relies on the good
sense and forbearance of tbe people, alleging
it is out of the power of any President to accom
plish. But little which leads him to observe that
the election of any oue -of our fellow-citizens to
til omce of President docs not of itself allbrd
Just cause tor dissolving tbe Union.
The late election having been held in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Constitu
tion, does not Justify a resolution to destroy this
very Constitution. Reason, justice, and a regard
for the Constitution, all reouire that we shall
wait for some overt and dangarous act on the
part ot the President elect, belore resorting to
such a remedy.
Mr Buchanan refers to the fact that the Presi
dent's province is not to make but to execute the
laws. It is alleged as one cause for immediate
secession, that the bouthern States are denied
equal rights with the other States iu the common
territory. But by what euthfrity are these de
nied? Not by Congress; which baa never passed,
and I believe never will pass any act to exclude
slavery from these territoriea, and certainly not
by the Supreme Court, which has solemnly de
cided that slaves are property, and. like all other
property, their owners have a rifht to take them
tuto the common territories and hold them there
under the protection of the Constitution. Tlte
anticipation that Congress may pass some law
obnoxious is no good reason for dissolution.
Tbe President re-asserts the power of Congress
over property in the Territories, and the sacred
rights of property are secured by the Constitu
tion. The most palpable violations of coostitu
it i:.tial duty which hss yet been committed, con
sist in the acta of different State Legislatures to
defeat tha execution of the Fugitive Slave Law.
It ought to be remembered, however, that for
these acts neither CoDgreaj or any President can
justly be held responsible. Having been passed
in violation of the Federal Constitution, they
are. therefore, null and void. It will be the duty
of tbe next President, as it has been my own, to
act with vigor iu executing the Fugitive Slave
Law against conflicting enactments of State Leg
islatures. We are not to presume in advauce
that be will violate his duty, which would be at
war with every principle of justice. Let ns wait
for the overt act. The Fugitive Slave law has
been carried into execution in every contested
case since the commencement of the present Ad
ministration. Let us trust that the State Legis
latures will repeal their unconstitutional and ob
noxious enactments. Unless this shall be done
without unnecessary delay, it is impossible for
any human power to save the Union, and the
Southern States have a right to demand this act
of justice from tbe Northern States.
Should this be refused, tbe injured State, after
having first used all peaceful means to obtain
redress, would be justihed in revolutionary resis
tance to the Government of tbe Union. The al
leged principle that as each Stale became a party
to the Union, by tbe vote of its own people, as
sembled in convention, so any one of them may
retire from the Union in a similar manner, by
tbe vote of such a constitution, is wholly incon
sistent with tha history as well as the character
of tbe Federal Constitution.
He then rehearses a portion of Gen. Jackson's
message of 1333, relative to the nullifying ordi
nance of South Carolina, and says this Govern
ment was intended by its founders to be perpetual
and not to be annulled at tlte pleasure ol ay oue
of the contracting parties.
Tbe President then enumerates the powers con
ferred on Congress by the Federal Government,
and that these powers may be effectual, it also
preserves exclusive right to lay and collect all
import duties and other taxes, and has adapted
effectual mean to restrain the States from inter
fering. But the distinction must ever be observed
that this is a revolution against an estab
lished government and not a voluntary se
cession from it by virtue of an inherent
constitutional right. In short, let ns look
the danger fairly in the face. Secession is
neither more nor less than revolution. It
may or it may not be a justifiable revolu
tion, but still it is a revolution. What, in
the mean time, is the responsibility! and
trae position of the Executive? He is
bound to take care that the laws are faith
fully executed, and from this obligation he
cannot be absolved by any human power.
But what if the performance of this duty in
whole or in part has been rendered imprac
ticable by events over which he could have
exercised ao control T Such at the present
moment is the case throughout the State of
South Carolina, so far as the laws of the
United States to secure the administration
of justice by means of the Federal judi
ciary are concerned. All tbe Federa loffi-
oers within its limits, through whose
agency alone these laws can be car
ried 'into execution, have already re
signed. We no longer have a District
Judge, Distrust Attorney or a Marshal in
oouLh Carolina. In fact, the whole ma
chinery of the federal government necessa
ry for the distribution of remedial Justice
among the people has been demolished, and
wonld be difficult, if not impossible, to
replace it. The only acts or Congress on
the statute book bearing on this subject are
those or the win or February, 17U5, and 8d
or March, IcHlZ. These authorize the Free
dent, after he shall ' have ascertained
that the Marshal with his posse comitatus
unable te execute civil or criminal pro
cess in any particular ease, to call forth the
military and employ the army and navy to
aid mm in performing this service, having
first by proclamation commanded the in
surgents to disperse and retire peacably
their respective abodes within a limited
time. This duty cannot by any possibility
performed in a State where no Judicial
authority exists to issue process, and where
there is no Marshal to execute it, and where
even if there were such an officer, the en
tire population would constitute one solid
combination to resist him. Congress alone
has power to decide whether the present
can or can not be amended so as to
carry out iiore effectually the objects of the
vansiuution. - -
The revenue still continues to be collected
heretofer at the custom house at
Charleston, and should the collector unfor.
tunately resign, a eolleotor may be appoint

any attempt will be made to expel the

umiu ovBten irom us pioperty there by

mistakes, the officers in command of the
forts have receive! orders to act atriotly
the defensive. Ia such a eoatingency
responsibility for consequences would
rightfully rest upon the heads of the as
sailants. In reference to recognising a
seceding State as an Independent Govern
ment, by (he President, he says it would
a naked a et of usurpation on his part
it is his duty to submit to Congress the
whole question in all its bearings. Tbe
probability of an emergency scon arising
when Congress will be called on to decide

compel a Stat to remain in the Union,
authorizes him to exrree the opinion that I

Federal Government. It is manifest that
this Is not among tbe specifio and enumer
ated powers granted to Congress, and It is
equally apparent that Its exercise is not
neooessary and proper for carrying into
execution any one of these powers.
Th President declares that to make war
upon a State Is at varlanoe with the spirit
of tbs Constitution, and after having con
quered a State how are we to govern it?
We oould not govern it by despotlo power
nor eould we by physical foroe oompel ita
people toelect Senators and Representatives
and perform ail the duties appertaining to
an independent State. The fact Is that our
Union rests upon publio opinion and oan
never be cemented by the blood of its citi
sens shed In civil war. It it cannot live in
the affections of-the people it must one dsy
perish. Congress possesses many means of
preserving it by ooooiilation, but the sword
is not placed in their hands to preserve it
by foroe. But may I be permitted solemn
ly to invoke my ooontrymen to pause and
deliberate before they determine to destroy
this, the grandest temple whioh has ever
been dedicated to human freedom sinoe the
world began. It has been consecrated by
the blood of our fathers, by the glories of
the past, by tbs hopes of the future I
The Union has already made us the
most prosperous, and - ere long will,
If, preserved, render us the most
powerful nation on tha face of the earth ' In ev
ery region of the globe, thetttle of American cit
izen is held In the hiffhest respect, aud when pro-
bounced in a foreign land, it causes the hearts of
our countrymen to swell wltn honest priae.- sure
ly .when we reach tbe brink of the yawing abyss,
we should recoil with horror from the fatal
plunge. By such a dread calastrophy the bojtes
of the friends ot freedom throughout the world,
would be destroyed, and a long night of despot
ism would enshroud the nation. Our example
for more than eighty years would not only be
lost, but would be quoted as a conclusive proof
that man is unlit for sell government.
The slavery question like everything will have
its day. 1 ttrmiy believe that it has already reach
ed and passed the culminating point, but if In th
midst of the existing excitement tha Union
shall perish, the soil may then become insupera
ble Congress oan do much to avert it by propo
sing and recommending to the legislatures of the
several States the remedy for existing evils which
the Constitution haa itself provided for its own
preservation.
The President proposes that his explanation
amendment to tne Constitution be adopted by
Congress for the final settlement of the true con
struction of the Constitution on three special
points. An express recognition of the right of
firoperty in slaves in the States where it now ex
sts, or may hereafter exist The duty f protec
ting this right in all tba common territories tliro -out
their territorial existence and until they
snail be admitted as States inte the Uion, with
or without slavery as IhelrCoustilutlonsmay pro
scribe. A iike lecognition ot tiia right of the
master to have his slave who haa escaped from
one State to another, restored anal delivered up
to him. and of the validity of tha F'ugitive biave
Law, enacted for this purpose, together with a
declaration that all State laws Impairing or de
feating this right, are Violations of the Constitu
tion, aud are consequently null and void.
Such an explanatory amendment would, it is
believed, forever terminate the existing disten
tions, and restore peace and harmony among the
States.
The President then discusses our foreign rela
tions. Our relations with Spain have been com
pticated by tbe refusal of the Senate to ratify the
Convention for the adjustment of the Cuban
claim, so called. He reiterates his recommenda
tion for the acquisition of Cuba by a lair pur
chase. With the exception of .Vexico our relations
are generally of a satisfactory character
In relation to Kansas, he says the desperate
band recently assembled under a notorious out
law in tha southern portion of the Territory to
resist tbe execution of the laws, aud to plunder
the peaceable citizens will. I doubt, not be speed
ily subdued and brought to justice.
He recommends a Pacitic Railroad: congratu
lates the country upon the apparent and diminu
tion of the slave trade, and the extinction ol the
filibustering excitement; and in view of the
destitution in Kausas, recommends to Congress
that if any constitutional measure of relief can
be devised the subject should be duly considered.

Mr. MoClelland offered an amendment
