MESSAGE SENT

ffl PRESIDENT
Foreign Relations Are Dealt
with by Taft in Detail in
Document Read at the
Opening of Session
MEXICO SITUATION
TO BE DEPLORED
Communication Is the First
of Several to Be Written
That Will Take Subjects
Up One at Time.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. A note of
warning to Kuropean iwers which
by direct means continue to dlscrlm
innto against American trade: a
fctrong appeal to the congress to up
lift lh0 great foreign policies of
America above mere questions ot par
tisanship; a triumphant vindication
of the diplomacy of the administra
tion, which characterized as that of
"dollars versus bullets;" a master
ful pride in the enormous expansion
of American trade as a result of the
foreign policies of his administration,
and an earnest appeal lor Joint ac
ttnn by congress and the executive
to open new markets for American
industries there are the more strik
ing features of President Taft's fourth
message sent to congress todar. .
One Subject Treated.
The message is the first of a ser
ies or such communications which be
will make to congress in the early
dajs of the session, and deals entire
ly with, the foreign relations of the
United States. Beginning with the
usual reference to the existing good
relations with foreign rowers, the
president adds that these have been
strengthened by "a greater insistence
jipon justice to American citizens, or
Interests, wherever it may have been
denied, and a stronger emphasis of
the need or mutuality in commercial
and ether relations."
For the first time in its historj
p-ivs the president the state depart
ment has obtained substantially tho
most favored nation treatment from
all of tho countries of the world.
' Therefore, he says, that it is only
natural that competitive countrie"
should view with some concern the
' e-cpanslon ot our commerce. Hence
the warning. "If Ir some instances
the incisures taken by them to meet
it are not entirely equitable, a rem
edy should be found "
To this end. the president strong
ly recommends the enactment of the
bill recommended by Secretary Knox
iast December, permlttlJg the gov
ernment, instead of imposing the full
maximum rates of duty against dls
criminating countries, to apply a
graduated scale of duties, up to that
maximum of 23 per cent.
"Flat tariffs are out ot date," ray
the president. "Nations no longer
accord equal tariff treatment to a'l
other nations. Irrespective of the
treatment from them received. It Is
very necessary that the American
government should be equipped with
weapons of negotiation and adapted
to modern economic conditions"
sa DeDartment Bettered.
Th state department: "an archaic

and Inadequate machine, at the be-
dnnlnc of this administration

president says, has become a new or
sanitation, with highly specialized bu.
reaus and experts dealing with every
phase ot American trade and diplom
acy. Holding that the espence of this
recognized service Is found In tho
merit system, which President Cleve
land Is credited with having Intro
duced. President Taft makes a strona
appeal to congress t omake this ma
chine permanent, by giving the force
of statutory law to the executive or
dors governing admission to and pro
motion in the diplomatic and consular

president points to the fact that three
cf the present ambassadors are holu
over: that of tho ten he hn
pointed, five were oy promotion freu
e rank of minister; that of the thlr-
ministers appointed, eleven
Amotions; and that In the cowutar
service no less than oo per cent 61
tbTconsuIs appointed by him were
from the southern states.
On Dollar Diplomacy.
-The diplomacy ot the present ao
nlnliuatloa has sought to respond
modern Ideas of corneal Inte
course," say President Taft. Tn
Sy has been characterised as sub
irttutlne dollars tor bullets. It U one
that appeal alike to Idealistic hw
nunltKsentlment.. to the dictate
o sound policy and sptegy. and to

diplomacy of the I'nlted States can

He mentions the arbitration irea

which failed of confirmation in the

necine strlle In Honduras, the adjust
ment of the celebrated Taona-Arica
dispute between Peru and Chile, and
tho adjustment of the Peruvlan-Ecua
aorlan boundary issue.
In consequence of these things.
says the president, there has been a
general casing of international ten
tlon on the west coast of South
America. Ho also adds that the di
plomacy of the United States Is ac
tive in seeking to assuage the re
maining III feeling between this
country and Colombia
Taking up soipe of the ear's diplo

President Taft makes the direct
charge that the terrible events re-

principal cities, the killings and the
tortures and suffering1 "might havo

convention by the senate, been per.
mltted to curry out Its now welt de

"In Central America the aim has
been to help such countries as Nica

selves," says President Taft.
While ttey are the immediate bene
ficiaries, tho profit to the UnlteS

The financial rehabilitation of these
countries by American bankers and
the protection of their customs houses
from being the prey of would-be dic
tators, says the president, would re
move the menace of foreign creoi

CHICKEN DINNER
CHICAGO, Dec 3. Jack Johnson,
the negro pugilist, was married thU
afternoon to M.ss Luciie Cameron,
nineteen jears old, a Mlnneaj.olls
girl, who recently returned Indict
ments charging him with violations
of the Mann act.
The ceremony was performed at
the home "of Johnson's aged mother,
on the south side, by II. A. Roberts,
a negro preacher in the presence of
a few persons, including several news
paper reporters.
The girl woro a tailor-made gray
suit of shepherd plaid and a large
black picture hat ornamented with
purple plumes. Johnson had a suit
of the same material, especially made
for the occasion.
A curious crowd of nearly a thou
sand men and women gathered out
side the house and a squad of police
was kept busy maintaining order.
The plan of having a moving pic
tur film made of the wedding cere
mony, for which Johnson was offered
$r..ooo was abandoned at the last mo
ment because Chief of Police Mc
Weeney prohibited it.
A woman newspaper writer was or
dered from the house before the cere
mony because she offended Johnson
by asking too many questions.
After the wedding an elaborate
chicken dinner was served - to the
guests. A la'rse wedding cake ana
numerous floral pieces were tno
features of the table decorations.

Other factors that may Influence

fact that Turkey recently sought to
