TBI Secretary of the Navy has made the
following changes in the regulations of the

of all cadets will commence on the 16th of
J une, instead of the 20th of May. The effect
of this is to give the classes more time to get
through the course. The academic year will
begin on the 20th ot September, instead of
the 1st October. The examination of candi
dates for admission as cadet midshipmen,
will take place on the 25th of June, instead of
between the 6th and 15th of June, and on
the 13th of September, instead of between
the 20th and the 90th of September. The

spirators was illegally chosen, and therefore

affect a large class of claims. The case is

count of the permanent loss of health from
excessive prostration of the nervous system
and suffering of mind and body by the .cap
ture on high seas by pirates. Five dollars
per day is claimed from tht date of capture.
The claim amounts to over $15,000.

the District Court in regard to the illegality
of the Grand Jury by which all the indict
ments against the safe burglars were set
aside, was virtually made by a single Judge
Chief Justice Cartter, Jndge Humphreys
having no part in the decision, Judge
McArthnr dissenting, and Jndge Olin being
physically incapable of serious attention to
the subject -
Attobxxt-Genesal Williams has sent
a communication to the Jndge of the Crim

Crimes, Fires and Casualties.
A terrible accident occurred a few days
ago, at Fall River, Mass., where the Old
Colony Railroad Company are constructing
a bridge across Taunton River. While work
men were engaged in sinking a pneumatic
cylinder which is to form a portion of a pier,
the upper flange of an air lock, to which the'
lower was secured, together with the cover,
was blown off by the pressure of air in the
cylinder. Eight men were on the cylinder
at the time of the explosion, three of whom
were killed outright, one was fatally injured,
one seriously, and three escaped uninjured.
A Scraktov, Pennsylvania, dispatch, says
that a .man named Ludwig, his wife and an
infant child, were found in bed, yesterday,

say by whom. The child is still living, but

At the final conference between the iron
manufacturers and the puddlers at Pittsburg,
the proposition made by the manufacturers
of five dollars per ton for boiling iron was
rejected by the puddlers. The result is that
a general suspension of the mills took place
on Monday, with the exception of one or two
mills, which will continue to pay present
prices, six dollars per ton, until their con
tracts are filled. A large amount of muck,
bar and finished iron is held in stock by the
various firms in the city, doubtless sufficient
to meet the demand for some time to come.
The result of a continued lock-out will be
somewhat discouraging, as the failure of the
two parties to come to an agreement will
throw out of employment about forty thou
sand men, and seriously affect the iron and
coal-mining interests of the State.
A few weeks ago a disastrous fire occured
at Uniontown, Kentucky. A pork-house,

Dawes, Phelps, and Smith discussed the
question at length.
Dec. 11. House Bills: For the appoint
ment of Mr. George Bancroft to fill the va
cancy in the Board of Regents of the Smith
sonian Institute, passed; for allowing home
stead and pre-emption settlersin Iowa, Minn
esota, A ebrasKa, ana Kansas, whose crops
were destroyed or injured by the grasshop
pers in 1S(4, to leave and be abbent from
their lands till May, 187b, without preiudice
to then-rights. Passed. Mr. Garfield denied
there was any foundation whatever for the
article in the New York Tribune yesterday,
entitled " Half Million Steal," charging the
Committee on Appropriations with having
inserted an item in the Post-office appropria
tion bill for an additional subsidy to the
Pacific Mail SteamshiD ComDanv. The bill
had not been reported nor even considered,
by the committee. Mr. Dawes, rising to a
question ol privilege, saia that the Ways and
Means Committee had taken up investigation
into a former mail subsidy, but the committee
had trouble in securing the attendance of
Richard B. Irwin, agent of the -company, who
was the only person who could give informa
tion sought for, and who had left for Europe,
while President of the company, because
temporarily insane, or else pretended in
sanity. This Irwin had recently returned
from Europe, and the company had caused
his arrest, and brought suit against him for
the recovery of $750,000 obtained by bim
Irom the company, lie haa then given bail
and had again gone to Em-ope, but had since
returned; and now represented himself as
too sick to leave New York for Washington
before Tuesday. A resolution was adopted
directing the arrest of Irwin for contempt,
in failing to ooey the summons ot the com
mittee, Mr. Dawes explaining, however, that
the chief object Was to guard against Irwin
again leaving the country before giving his
testimony.
War at Vicksburg.
A " war of the races " has begun in Mis
sissippi. I here has been for some time, at
Vicksburg, trouble between citizens and the
county officials. The story, by telegraph, is,
that the Sheriff was acting without legal
bonds, and the Board of Supervisors refused
to order a new one, though the time for pay
ing taxes had arrived. Two or three other
officials were under indictment for forgery
and embezzlement, and the citizens despair
ing of any relief from the courts held a
meeting, and in a body proceeded to the
court-house to demand the resignation of
the Sheriff, Chancery Clerk, Treasurer, and
Coroner. All fled, except Sheriff Crosby,
negro, and he signed his resignation. A
card appeared on the streets signed by
Crosby, calling on all the citizens of Warren
county, Republicans, white and black, to
come to his aid, and support hyn in his posi
tion. Crosby publicly, and through the
papers, denied the authorship of the card,
yet, Monday morning, the 7th, armed bodies
of negroes appeared, advancing on the city
from six different loads. The alarm was
Bounded about nine o'clock, and the citizens
gathered en matte, armed immediately, and
advanced to meet the negroes on Baldwin's
Ferry road. The negroes were met just out
side the city, on Grove street, about two
hundred strong, and Immediately firing com
menced on both sides. The negroes retreated
about a mile, and again made a stand in the
old breastworks and a house, but were soon
routed. The loss in this engagement was
one citizen, Oliver Brown, killed, and about
twelve or fifteen negroes killed, several
wounded, and about tweity prisoners.
On Hall's Ferry road about two hundred
and fifty negroes were found and reuted
after a short engagement, with several killed
and wounded. Andrew Owens, negro, who
commanded the negroes on Baldwin's Ferry
road, was captured and committed to jail.
In this engagement the loss of the negroes
is reported at seventy, and the whites one.
About fifty prisoners were taken, and placed
in the Vicksburg jail. The militia were out
in force. Quiet was at last comparatively
restored, and business, which had been sus
pended, was resumed; the white's having
full possession of the city, with the prison
ers under safe guard, "closely watched to
prevent lynching."
Lieutenant-Colonel O. S. Lee, Aicl-de-Camp
to Adjutant General Packer, and a com
mittee of citizens, met in the court-room to
determine what course to pursue. In a
private interview between Packer, Lee, and
Crosby, Crosby expressed a desire to tender
his retaliation as Sheriff. Generul Packer
prepared his resignation, to take effect
mediately, which he signed, and it was wit"
nessed by Lee and Packer. Governor Ames
has issued a proclamation calling an extra
session of the Legislature, to take action on
the situation.
Crosby, colored Sheriff, and leader of the
negroes, is still he! but the other prisoners
have been released on promise of good be
havior. No violence was offered. Crosby
says that Governor Ames and Attorney
General Harris told him to organize men
and attack the eity. The negroes say they
got orders from Crosby. The Timet) Repub
lican, says the attack on the city was as im
practicable as it was atrocious, and the
leaders ought to be punished. Crosby is as
big a fool as the other negroes, and intimates
that white men were at the bottom of it
OHIO.
The Governor's Message.
To Ik General Auemtly:
Since yeur adjournment, the late Consti
tutional Con vencion, then in session, brought
its labors to a conclusion, and submitted the
result for the ratification of the people. Such
ratification was not obtained. You ars as
sembled, therefore, under the pre-existing
Constitution.
Among the many wise and salutary pro
visions in this Constitution, there is one
which I deem of very special importance at
tha present time. It is the provision that
makes it not discretionary but imperative
under the General Assembly, to establish a
Sinking Fund for the gradual but certain
ultimate payment of the State debt. The
Convention which adopted the Constitution
fully realized the necessity of providing for
ever against the creation of a public debt
of indefinite duration, so far as the payment
of the principal of such debt is concerned.
It is for this reason that I desire to call your
attention to the condition of the Sinking
Fund.
Section 5 of Article XII of the Constitution
provides, that " No tax shall be levied, ex
cept in pursuance of law; and every law im
posing a tax shall state distinc Jy the object
of the same,. to which only it shall be ap
plied." In contravention of this provision
of the Constitution, the General Assembly,
at the sessions of 1872 and 1873, passed acts
authorizing the temporary transfer ef money
from one fund to another ; and in pursuance
of the laws, large sums were transferred from
the Sinking and Common School Funds to
the Revenue and Asylum Funds. There
still remain of these transferred funds which
have not been returned, the sum of $58,000
due the Sinking Fund, and the sum of $21
000 due the Common School Fund. Last
winter the Attoruev-General in response to
a resolutioi of the House of Representatives,
gave an elaborate opinion respecting the
matter of these transfers, and declared the
laws authorizing them to be unconstitu
tional. Since then, the public funds have
been held sacred for the purpose for which
they were collected. These unconstitutional
acts are still npon the statute book, and
should fee immediately repealed.
It will be necessary for the General As
sembly, at the present session, to make
provisions for the return of the transferred
funds te the Sinking Fund; and to make
further provisions for the payment of the
interest on, and the principal of, our State
debt, which falls due in January and July,
1875, and in January, 1876. On the first of
January 1876, there will be due, on the
principal of our debt, payable at the pleas
ure of the State, the sum of $1,494,865.
There will be due interest upon the debt,
including interest on the irreducible debt,
in January and July, 1875, and in January,
1876, the sum of about $1,100,000, making a
total of $2,694,865, of principal and interest
To meet this, there is a present surplus in
the Trersury, of $450,569.82. The collections
for 1875, which will be applied to the Sink
ing Fund, as estimated, on the present levy,
will be about $1 262,000, making a total of
$1,712,589.82, which would leave a deficiency
to be provided for of $982,296.
The principal falling due is payable at the
Sleasure of the State ; and it is for you to
etermine whether it shall be met when due,
or paid as the accumulations in the Sinking
Fund shall warrant But I would suggest
that the credit of a great State, like that of
an individual, is better preserved by being
ready to pay its debts prompt at maturity.
The following is a brief summary of the
present financial condition of the State :
On the 15th of November, 1873, the
public funded debt of the State was- $8,211,66$ !0

Of the amount outstanding on the 15th of
November, the sum of $22,365 had ceased to
draw interest, the holders thereof having
been notified to surrender their stock for re
demption, so that the interest-bearing funded
debt of the State is $7,965,840 30.

Considering the general stagnation of
business during the past year, this exhibit is
a remarkable indication of the rapid devel
opment of the material resources of the
State.
The.opening of this adjourned session of
the General Assembly occurring but sixteen
days after the close of the fiscal year, it has
been impossible for the various departments
and public institutions to complete and
submit their annual reports in time for me
to give them such examination as would en
able me to present my views and make sug
gestions herein concerning them. I must,
therefore, refer you to the reports them
selves, when they shall have been printed
and laid before you.
I have given personal attention to the
working of the penal, reformatory, and be
nevolent institutions of the State, having
visited them since the close of your last ses
sion. In the main they are working well,
and are fulfilling, in an eminent degree, the
design of their creation.
The reorganization of the last session has
been productive of good results. Especially
is this true respecting the Ohio Penitentiary
and the Central Ohio Hospital for tbe In
sane. The Penitentiary has been managed with
ability and financial success. Its report
shows that it has netted the State, during
the year, over nnd above the salaries of the
officers and expenses of maintenance, the
sum of $23,41'r..r)9 ; and over all expenses,
including manufacture of gas for State
buildings, repairs, etc., the sum of $7,412.02.
This is a good showing for a year of financial
distress and diminished demand for convict
labor.
The act abolishing the Board of Trustees
of the Central Ohio Lunatic Asvlum (now
known as the Central Ohio Hospital for the
Insane) and creating the Board of Commis
sioners for the construction of the institu
tion, has produced results hardly anticipated
by the most sanguine friends of the measure.
Three gentlemen of eminent worth and pe
culiar adaptability to the wants of the situ
ation were appointed and confirmed. This
new Board found the unfinished walls of the
building much injured by exposure during
the preceding winter. There was, also, an
absence of such working drawings in the
architect's office as were necessary to the
progress of the work. This condition of
things delayed work on the building until
after the middle of April. At the present
time, the entire edifice (except the water
tower in the rear central wing, which was
taken down and is being rebuilt) is not only
ready for the roof, but more than one-half of
it is now covered, and workmen are engaged
in roofing the remainder of it An immense
amount of work has been done during the
season, the number of bricks laid upon the
walls being more than thirteen millions,
with the material and labor of other trade
corresponding thereto.
The amount of the estimates for work done
by contractors and for all other puipeses
connected with the building, during the fis
cal year ending November 15, 1874, is $334,
068.58. The retained percentage upon the
same is $28,746.04. The unexpended balance
of fo.-mer appropriations in the Tresurv on
November 15, 1874, was $69,417.70. In addi
tion to this sum the Board asked for an ap
propriation for all purposes for the current
year of $450,000.
The act creating the Board of Commission
ers limits their term of office to one year,
which will expire on the first day of April,
1875. I respectfully recommend that the
provisions of the act be extended for one
year from that time.
We have reasons for congratulation that
our State institutions have escaped serious
calamity during tbe year. A slight fire oc
curred at the Reform Farm School, on the
7th day of last month, which destroyed the
large workshop f the institution. It was
necessary that it should be rebuilt at once,
to prevent idleness of the inmates, which
would breed all manner of evil in such an
institution. The Board of Commissioners
immediately proceeded with the work; and
they call for a small appropriation to com
plete it, which I hope will be made.
The reorganization of the Board of Trus
tees of the Agricultural and Mechanical
College has been productive of good results.
The old Board was too unwieldyjor success
ful management, while thediminshed size of
the new Board has enabled it to harmonize
ideas and views, and work with a singleness
of purpose that has been beneficial to the
college. I invite you to consider the fact that
this admirable institution of learning has not
yet received the public attention that its
merits entitle it to. It is the college of the
people, and it should have their good will
and encouragement If has an efficient
Faculty, a handsome endowment, with the
accessories common to the best colleges in
the country, and should have a much larger
attendance of students. I respecteully sug
gest that the General Assembly may devise
ways and means to aid the Board of Trustees
in bringing about this desirable result
In pursuance of the act of February 18,
1874, creating a State Board of Centennial
Managers, five eminent citizens of Ohio
were appointed to constitute the Commission.
Thev have cnmnleted their organization, and
entered upon the discharge of the duties as
signed them.
In the execution of tbe several laws pro
viding for the reorganization of the various
Public Institutions, passed at your last ses
sion, the appointments made by the execu
tive have, in every instance, proved to be
satisfactory such appointments having been
made solely with a view to promote the
pnblic interest, without regard to other con
siderations, the officers appointed seeming
to be influenced in their action by the same
motives which determined their appoint
ment
During the summer, the irritation of feel
ing in the mining districts arising out of the
disagreement between the mine owners and
miners assumed, in one instance, a form of
intensity which seriously imperilled the
public peace. At the critical moment, the
prompt interposition of the moral authority
ol tne elate was iouna sumcieui ui mmy
the exasperation of passions, and to reassure
peace and harmony, without a resort to the
material power of the State.
An earnest effort has been made by the
Adjutant General to collect the Ohio war
claims against the General Government
He has succeeded in collecting and placing
in the State Treasury the sum of $35,781.98.
A balance remains uncollected of $275,988.84,
but little of which will be collected, unless
further legislation be had by Congress. For
the details respecting these claims, you are
referred to the report of the Adjutant Gen
eral." At the close of the fiscal year 1873, there
were thirtv-two military companies in the
State, of all branches of the service. There
are now forty-one companies two battalions
of three companies each; one battalion of
two companies ; twenty-five unattached com
panies of infantry; one battery of artillery
of four guns, and two batteries of two guns
each. This increase evinces a revival of in
terest in our volunteer military organizations.
The security of every community is enhan
ced by a well organized militia ; and I trust
that bur military companies, in which we
feel a just pride, will receive the fostering
care of the State.
The general financial depression has been
felt by the railroad interest of the State more
than any other interest But few new lines
have been projected, and several roads that
would have been built under more favorable
circumstances have been temporarily aban
doned. The Baltimore, Pittsburg and Chicago
Company has completed one hundred and
ten miles of new track during the year; the
Painesville and Youngstown Company has
enmnletpd thirtv-nine miles of narrow craupe
track; the Marietta, Pittsburg and Cleve
land Company has completed nineteen miles
t . ,., -r , . , - i t ; :n
Ol new iracK, tne IjSkc cne sou jjuuisvuic
Company has completed eight miles; the
Toledo and Maumee Company has completed
seven miles; the Mansfield, Cold water and
Lake Michigan Company has completed
twenty-seven miles; the Baltimore Short
Line Company has completed thirty miles;
and the Cincinnati and Whitewater Valley
Company has completed nearly two miles.
This makes a total of nearly two hundred
and ferty-five miles of new track.
Railroads are not only of great utility, but
have become a necessity to the country.
They should not be hampered by vindictive
ana vexatious legislation ; but, as the ser
vants of the people, eniovinir necnliAr fran
chises, they should be held strictly amenable
to judicious legislation that will prevent
the a from becoming the masters of the peo
ple. Their rights should be fully protected
by law, and the rights of the people should
be protected against such encroachments as
tend to make them the victims of monopoly.
At your, former session, you performed
an act of justice and mercy for the men who
delve in our mines, by enacting the law " To
regulate mines and mining, and to provide
for a State Inspector of Mines." A practi
cal miner of intelligence and education was
appointed, who has displayed great energy
in the enforcement of the act He has per
sonally visited and inspected twe-thirds of
the mines in the State ; and the good effects
of the law are recognized already, in im
proved ventilation and other changes which
have conduced greatly to the comfort of the
miners. The General Assembly should fol
low up its recent action by such further leg
islation as maybe found necessary to the ac
complishment of the beneficial objects sought
to be attained.
In the Inaugural Address which I had the
honor to deliver before the General Assem
bly, I strongly urged a teduction of the ex
penditures of the State Government down to
the very last dollar compatible with the
maintenance of the public credit and the ef
ficient working of the several departments
of the Government; and I insisted that it
should not be that vague and mere verbal
economy which, public men are so ready to
profess with regard to public expenditures,
but that earnest and inexorable economy
which proclaims its existence by accom
plished facts. In the midst of the existing
financial distress, with so many of our fel-fow-citizens
out of employment, and wages
everywhere reduced, I most earnestly renew
the recommendation I then made. The State
should not embark in new building enter
prises until the public buildings now iu pro
cess of construction shall have been com
pleted; new offices should not be created;
and your present session should be brought
to a close at the earliest moment, when, in
your judgment, the public business will
allow. The evidence you gave at your last
session of a determination to retrench by re
ducing the tax levy $44,000, and by other acts
of legislation, has encouraged the people of
the State to believe that economy and pru
dence will govern all your actions in the
matter of public expenditures.
It is a question for your serious considera
tion, whether the compensation of our county
officers is not disproportionate to the salaries
of other public officers, and persons in pri
vate life. Public servants should be reason
ably compensated ; but salaries and fees
should not be so high as to make the getting
of office a profession, and to enable candi
dates and applicants to buy their way to pub
lic places.
I conclude by expressing the hope that
your session may be pleasant and harmoni
ous, and that it may be productive of great

GRANGE MATTERS.
A Granger's Serenade.
Oh, come, my love, and live with me,
And keep my cottage in the gen
As patient as an humble bee.
And busy as a setting hen.
Oh, rest Veneath my fragrant bower,
Where sweet stramonium doth entwine;
Come, smell the gentle cauliflower
And cull tbe mangel-wunie vine.
Ah, listen to the rural songs I
Tbe pea shall wind his magic shell
As echo plaintively prolongs
Tbe warble of the pimpernel.
Beyond the vermicelli row
1 bear the buil-frogs sigh again
The cackle of the Durham ewe
The bellow of the Berkshire hen.
Oh, come, love, come! the morn is fair,
I'U celebrate the day with thee ;
I'll merrily dig the Bartlett pear,
And shake the rata bags tree.
Oh, hump yourself, my lovely Poll,
And in the cause of anti-monop
We'll mulch the turkeys in tbe fail.
And graft the long-clam on the hop.
My sweetest 1 I am fond of mush.
And thoa wilt eet some ou t for me;
We'll early sow the currant bush,
- And tap the cranberry -jelly tree.
We'll pull the wool from off the calf,
The Cottonwood its fleece shall shed ;
So at the winter will we laugh,
And gaily weed the oyster bed.
We'll blithely hoe the winter wheat,
We'll chase the eggs the squirrels lay ;
And when the bantam hog shall bleat,
We'll feed him with some clover hay.
All savory game to thee I'll bring;
The burdock knows my spear is sharp;
I'll shoot the dolphin on the wing.
And hit him in the pericarp. .
Then eome, my love, and live with me,
Ana beautify my lonely den
As patient as an huirsMe bee,
And busy as a setting hen.
Tbe total number of granges organized
in Kentucky, up to November 1, is one
thousand hve hundred and twenty.
The AVinconsin Patrons have already
forty-one co-op arative associations for
selling goods ard manufacturing, and
twenty-nine insvance companies.
It is estimated that the present cotton
crop of Texas belonging to Patrons will
be handled for one-third less than last
year, and the business n.en who propose
to sell at these prices are among the best
in the State.
The general sentiment of Grangers in

during the first year only ten granges

It would add greatly to grange meet

subject for discussion, which would be
participated in by members. - Let a
standing committee be appointed to re
port at each meeting a subject for dis
cussion at the next. Then let several
members of the grange be appointed to
discuss it. After those appointed have
concluded their remarks, let the subject
be open for general discussion. We sug
gest the following pertinent subjects: 1.
Advantage of education. 2. Deep plow

Fencing. 5. The stock law. 6. Farm
machinery. 7. Farm labor : how tohire
it. 8. Our pork, beef.wheat and cott on ;
how shall we market them to secure the
greatest profit to the" farmer, mechanic

profitable. 11. The geese? 12. Immi

practice must be combined. Ex.
The white population of Mississippi is
not far from 30,000; estimating each
family at six would give 50,000 families.
Suppose each family used four brooms a
year, this would give 200,000 ; at fifty
cents each, would make $100,000. Proba
bly no set of people dislike fleecing more
than we do, or talk more boisterously
against it, and still we persistently and
unnecessarily expose ourselves to it in
many small things. There is no soil or
climate in the world better adapted to
broom-corn than ours. If every granger
in Mississippi would plant one pint of
broom-corn seed next spring, it would
supply the State with brooms for two
years, and thus save the farmers alone
probably not less than $75,000. It is
difficult to obtain seed in some places.
Let each grange request the Secretary to
order one-half bushel or less, and pay
with funds into the treasury, and then
say, " brethern, come and take without
further money or price." Before the
war we could not afford to be troubled
with broom-corn, now we can not afford
to have a broom charged to us at fifty
cents with twenty-five per cent added
for good measure. Cor. Farmer' $ Vindi

others. But they made one point which
we have so far overlooked. A member
of a trade guild waa in all cases compelled
to serve a regular apprenticeship, to pass
an honorable examination, ana then to
travel from one great city to another for
a number of years, practicing his trade
all the time, and thugby skill and in
dustry forming a character, which gen
erally was bis capital when he settled
down. - The present generation of farm
ers is composed of a few who learned the
trade regularly, and of many who only
became farmers from necessity or force
of circumstances. The consequence is.
that we have but few who could stand
any examination, or could receive a
diploma from the grange if demanded.
This state of things is unavoidable now,
but it need not be in the future. Each
fanner, no matter how much care he has
heretofore applied in his operations,
should resolve to double it at least for
the future. It is- not so much the know
ledge which a farmer possesses that car
ries him through (though an important
quality), as it is the care with which he
conducts all his plans. Care, it is said,
killed the cat, but I believe it has a con
trary effect on human beings. To reap
all the advantages arising from co-operative
measures, every farmer should strive
to excel in the quality as well as quan
tity of his products. Improvements in
these two points is not incompatible, and
will advance the whole community. Let
us trim our sails to catch all the breezes.

Caught in His Own Trap.
[From the Virginia (Nevada) Chronicle.]
A party of hunters from this city, who
have just returned from an expedition
into the Sierra Nevada, about forty miles
from town, relates the following remark
able incident : On last Thursday after
noon, about three o'clock, two of the
party were on the trail of a deer, which
led them into a remote ravine in the fast
neaeeBof the mountains, into which thev
had not before ventured. The snow be
ing about two feet deep, and the walking
verv heaw. thev became rlisamnrworprr
and losing all hope of overtaking the
aeer, wnicn tney cad wounded, they
abandoned the pursuit. On their return.
one of them discharged his gun at a hare,
and soon after a faint halloo was heard at
some distance to the right, as if from
some one in distress. Uncertain whether
they were mistaken, and had not been
deceived by the whistling of the wind,
they shouted aloud, when the cry was re
peated. As night would soon come on,
they held a consultation, and were about
proceeding to their camp, three or four
milesaway, concluding that the noise was
made by wandering -Indians, or came
from a party of woodchoppers. They
started on, out soon a prolonged and
mournful howl was borne down the wind
and again reached their ears. They
stared a( each other a moment, and then
by a simultaneous impulse turned in the
direction from which the sound pro
ceeded. They went on for some dis
tance, floundering through the snow
down a precipitous descent which led
them into a gloomy canyon. As they
drew near the voice of a human being
could be distinctly heard calling for re
lief. They answered that aid was ap
proaching. The man's yells of misery
changed to cries of joy, and they could
hear him at intervals shouting, "For
God's sake don't go away and leave me !"
" Come and get me ont !" " I am caught
and starving!" Still they could see
nothing, but guided by the man's cries
and cheering him with hopeful answers
as they advanced, they pushed forward
and at last discerned what seemed to be
a small cabin built of logs, without win
dows or doors. The snow had drifted
against one side of the hut nearly as high
as the roof, and as they could see no en
trance they went around to the other
side.
As soon as the occupant saw them he
uttered exclamations of the greatest joy,
and explained his situation by stating
that he had built a bear-trap and had
caught himself in it five days before. The
door was made of heavy logs and was so
arranged as to slip down into its place
from above. They tried to lift it up, but
failed. Finally, by means of a stick of
timber, which lay near by, they pried it
up sufficiently for the prisoner to crawl
beneath. He appeared more dead, than
alive, but by the judicious use of a flask
of brandy they were able to get him to
their camp about dark, where their com
panions had a blazing fire awaiting their
return. The half famished man ate
ravenously. He was supplied with plenty
of hot coffee and smoked a pipe, after
which his strength somewhat revived,
and he gave the following account of how
he got into the situation in which he was
found. He said his name was Thomas
Way, and that he had been engaged in
chopping wood in the mountains during
last summer. Since the first snowfall,
about a month ago, he had frequently
noticed tracks of bears among the pine
trees, and had often tried to get a shot at
them, but without success. At last the
idea struck him to build a pen such as he
had often sees grizzly bears caught in,
iri Lake county .California, where he used
to live. He explained that a bear trap
is made by building a small square house
of heavy hewed logs, and covering it with
a strong roof. The door is of heavy logs
also, and slides up and down in grooves.
When it is up there is an open entrance
about five high and four feet wide. A
sheep is killed and hung up inside of the
pen attached to a rope, which is connected
with a trigger, so that when the bear en
ters and seizes the mutton the door falls
and he is caged. Way went to work and
completed his trap to his satisfaction,
and intended to bait it the same night.
Having a curiosity to see how it would
work, he went in and pulled the rope
slightly, when the door tell down.
He attempted to raise it, but was horror-stricken
and his hair stood on end
when he found that he was unable to
budee it an inch. He worked and strug
gled, but the heavy weight refused to
move. The pen worked only too suc
cessfully, and he was caught in his own
trap. He yelled, shouted, called for help,
but knowing that he was miles from a
human habitation, and in a savage lo
cality where few persons ever ventured,
he sat down in blank despair. He spent
that night in agony and got but little
sleep. It commenced to snow, but fortu-
.. a 1 1 1 i . a.
nately he had a neavy Dianxei overcoat
which kept him comparatively comfor
table. The next morning he commenced
shouting again until his throat was sore,
but was only answered by the howling
nf the tern d test. He had set his gun
against a stump outside and longed to
get at it, that he might fire it off and at
tract somebody's attention. He soon be-cran-
to get hungry. His thirst he
auenched bv thrusting his hand through
the chinks between the logs and raking
up snow and eating it. Thus day after
day elapsed, during which his mental
sufferings were terrible. "I tell you
men," said he, " I thought of everything
I had ever done in all my life, from the
time I was a boy six years old." At last
a brilliant idea struck him. He had
matches, and would burn his way out.
With the heel of his boot he would kick
and grind a log until he had accumulated
a quantity of dust and splinters, which
he would light with a match and then
blow the fire with his hat until he had
burned a hole large enough to crawl out.
All the day previous to that on which he
was found he was thus employed, but
upon trial the scheme would not work.
The wood refused to burn, and he again
lay down to die. That day passed and
the next he had abandoned all hope and
was calculating how long it would take
a strong healthy man to die of starvation.
He was in a state of abject stupor, when
he heard the report of a gun. He was in
doubt whether it was not the effect of his
own maddened imagination, but he
hallooed with all his might and kept on
shouting. When his cries were answered
he was almost delirious with joy. As the
voices approached his visions of ap
proaching death fled away and the
realities of life came back like a flood.
He was profuse in his gratitude to his de
livers, but declared his intention of get
ting out of the Sierra Nevadas as soon as
possible and abandon bear hunting."
Delaware is peculiar at all times.
This year she has a lull Legislature, thirty
men, with not a lawyer among the num
ber. There are farmers and merchants,
philosophers, and no, not any fools, we
hope but not a member of the legal-profession.
