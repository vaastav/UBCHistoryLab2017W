i' or Rheumatism STrS
Omega Oil for Rheumatism, they ought to drink two or
three glasses of water at night
and two or three more glasses in
the morning. The Oil goes in
through the pores, destroys the
acids which cause Rheumatism,
and the blood carries
the destroyed acid to the
kidneys, where it is fil
tered out. By drink
ing plenty of water,
the kidneys are well
washed out, and in this
manner the rheumatic
poisons are removed
from the. system. You
have probably noted that
in all sickness the sim
plest treatments do the
most good. Nothing is
simpler than
drinking pure
water, and rub
bing the body
and muscles,
and tendons,
and joints with
Omega Oil.

FRANCE APPROVES.
Newspapers Praise Roosevelt's Stand
on Japanese Question.
Paris, Dec. 6. All the French news
papers today published editorials on
President Roosevelt's message unani
mously selecting for comment his re
marks upon the Japanese situation as
"being most characteristic of the man,"
and praising the president's courage
The general opinion can be summed up
In the ivorda of the Petite Hepubliqua
as follows:
"His presentation of the Japanese
question was an eloquent feature of
the address. It constitutes a lesson in
international politeness and shows that
in order for a nation to have the right
to Insist on the proper treatment of
its own subjects abroad, it is necessary
to begin according simibir treatment
to foreigners at home. The president
has spoken with courage, regardless of
popularity. He has performed his
duty as an American and as chief of
state."

KNOCKS OUT-TO
Kansas Grain Inspection Depart
ment Invalidated by Court.
Derision Announced by Judge
K. S. Peters, Master.
KADFOKD IS ENJOINED.
Inspector Will lie Unable to
Enforce Honest Weights.
Likely That Legislature Will
Take Action in Matter.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 6. The Kan
sas grain Inspection and weighing law
has been declared void by Judge S. R.
Peters, special master appointed by
Judge Pollock of the United States
court. Judge Peters recommends that
a decree be issued enjoining John Rad
ford, chief Kansas inspector, and his as
sistants from weighing any grain in or
out of elevators in Kansas City. Kan.
The case has been argued four times in
the past two years.
The decision of the United States
courts above referred to means that
the Kansas grain inspection depart
ment is put out of business, and that
the Kansas farmers having grain to
sell will have to rely for their
weights and grading upon the com
mission man or elevator to whom the
grain is consigned.
The law was enacted for the pur
pose of protecting- the farmers from
unfair treatment by elevator men, and
It gave to the Kansas grain inspector
and his deputies- the right to go into
grain elevators above a certain size
and require those elevators to permit
an inspection and weighing of all
grain received by them. The fact
that the law did not apply to all ele
vators was the ground upon which it
was attacked.
It is likely that the coming session,
of the legislature will be called upon
to act, and pass a law which will
remedy the delects in the old law, and
re-establish the department in some
form for the protection of Kansas
farmers.

Convention at Dcs Moines to Secure
Popular FJection of Senators.
Des Moines, la., Dec. 6. The resolu
tions committee of United States sena
torial convention was in session till af
ter midnight and for tr.ree hours today
finally making its report to the conven
tion this afternoon.
An attempt was made on the part of
Piatt Hubbell, a delegates from Mis
souri, at the session of the resolutions
committee today to get the committee
to report a resolution favoring the elec
tion of United States judges by vote of
the people also, but the committee voted
against the proposal.
Cheshire of Iowa reported at the fore
noon session for the commlt-tee Wl per
manent organization recommending that
the convention be recognized as the
United States senatorial convention; that
the committee on credentials be in
structed to report a complete roll of the
names of all the delegates for whom
credentials were filed, whether present
or not and that these constitute the
organization: that when the convention
adjourn it be at the call of the presi
dent on request or advice of the execu
tive committee, which committee shall
consist of one delegate from each state
that appointed delegates, the committee
to be selected by the president of the
convention.
The organization of the convention
will be continued before the adjourn
ment of the present meeting and the
committee will favor the calling of a
constitutional convention only be
cause it believes it impossible to get
the senate to act with the house in pro
posing an amendment for the direct
election of the senators by the people.
The resolutions presented by the reso
lutions committee follow:
Resolved, That while this convention
would much prefer that congress should
submit to the several states a proposed
amendment to the constitution for the
election of senators by direct vote of
the people, so that the states might pass
upon it as a single question, yet inas
much as the senate persistently refuses
to submit such amendment, it therefore
earnestly recommends that the legisla
tures of the several states do in pur
suance of article 4. of the constitution
of the United States make application
to the congress to call a convention for
the purpose of proposing amendments
to the constitution of the United States.
Resolved. That the president and
secretary of this convention be, and
they are hereby instructed to transmii
duly certified copies of these resolu
tions to the chairmen of the nationa.
committee and of the several state
committees of the two leading politi
cal parties, also to the governors of the
rMn'prtive states, to each member of
congress, and to the president.
That in transmitting the copies to
the governors of the states, the presi
dent and secretary of this convention
hall enclose a letter, urging each of
them to lay these resolutions oerore
the legislature of his state.
