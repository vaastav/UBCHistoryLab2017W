Robbing tbe Revennc.
For some tim* pn?t (he Custom-house
authorities hnvft hern nwflrc that large
quantities of silks anil Lyons velvets were
being smuggled across the channel from
France to Ireland, maiulv to Belfast and
the northern port', 't he goods were there
safelv stored until emigrants could he
tound bv whom to send the cloth to rsew
Yol k. The mode of operation was av fol
lows : A large trunk manufacturer, whose
i name is suld to he Downs, furnished boxes
t\ u* emigrants at reduced priors. Thes<' boxes
or chest* were of the most substantial
j manufacture, and contained fal?e bottom*. ,
| Between the false and r^nl bottoms tl?o
: silks and > el vet* were bidden anil smug
; pled into New York. The emigrants were
recommended to go to certain hoarding
; houses on West street, and when they ar
j rived there with their boxes if was a simple
matter to remove the smuggled goods and
i replace the false bottom*. The goods were
then removed to two wholesale houses on
j Broadway, who were thus enabled to sell
j tine silk^ and velvets at a low figure, very
much under the market prices. So common
had this mode of evading the Custom author
ities become that it Is probable that hardlv
a vessel left the northern parts of Ireland
without some of the inceniouslv constructed
chests aboard. Tt. is estimated that the loss
to the United State* Government by this
fraudulent evasion of custom* will nggrepate
nearly $".150,000 In gold. By some means
the secret leaked out and came to the ears
of tbe authorities, who immediately Insti
tuted a vigorous examination of emigrants'
boxes on all voxels arriving at Castle Oar
den. The search ha? been successful. This
morning three of the attaches of the Cus
tom-house found a chest containing silks
and velvets, valued at $(>.000, at a boarding
house on West street. So neatly had trie
box been constructed that it passed the.
ollicers at Castle Garden without suspicion
as to its contents. Many hoxe? "Imilfir to
I he one seized have been cent to Baltimore
by the smuggler*, and the custom-house
authorities in th:it city have been notified
of the fact bv the New York officials. The
*iiks and velvets ?seized in West street have
hem removed to the seizure department. ?

of obstructing United States mails at the

were ordered in that position by Kucker.

ibis morning :
'?in view of the threatened adoption by
President Giant of ButleiJ$ non-intercom
mercial policy toward Canada, including
the withdrawing of the bonding system, it
is li'tercaiinx to"know the immense accorn
modation which Canada lias afforded to the
United States by permitting that country
the free use of the Weiland canal, lu the
year ending June 30, 1870, no less than
2,884 American steam and sailing vessels,
with a tonnage ot 765,742 tons, passed
through the canal. The withdrawing of
the bonded privilege would, it is currently
believed, neee^-ai i!* eutul a like withdrawal
of the u*e of '.he Weiland canal to Ameri
can vessels, whi'-h, of course, would affect
most disastrously t be cities of Chicago, Os
wego, and Ogdensburg."

Rome of the phawea of military reconstruct
tton in Georgia is about to be presented to
Congrcpo by Hon. lienry S. Wetmore, who
states that ho was elected bv tho Republi
can* .hidire of the Court of Ordinary, and
on the 10th of April. 1870, released' a man
on habeas corpus, because of informality 1n <
the warrant. On the 20th of the same ?
month General Terrv Issued an order re-!
moving him from office, hut assigning- no j
o? use. 'I his order the judpe refused to I
obey, and was put off the bench at the j
point of the bayonet. The reason for!
i " tlii< exhibition of brute force, and the
1 spectacle of a civic judge driven from his ?
bench bv soldiery, was because General
, Terrv differed in opinion on the law govern- I
ing the habeas corpus case." Ah proof of'
'this, he cites the fact that. General Terry
i wrote to Gen. Sherman tdving that as the
reason. lie cites the acts of Congress to
show that Gen. Terry's action was Illegal,
' and adds that he is confirmed In that opin
ion by Representatives Bingham, Logan,
j and Farn?worth, and yet he declares that
he is still deprived of his office, which is
tilled by a military appointee, who was a
prisoner held by the United States Govern
ment in Fort Lafayette as the President of
a block>de-runniug company. He con
! eludes his statement as follows : " I re
'spectfully ask Congress to investicate this
1 matter, and if substantiated, to request that
the Secretary of War order General Terry
before a court-martial to answer for his
despotic and illegal conduct, as a disgrace
to the uniform he wears, an insult to the
judiciary of the country, an invasion of the
rights and property of a citizen, and a re
proach to our republican form of govern
ment."

Butler's Book on Grant.? Ju?t now
General Butler is growing uneasy lest he
be brought into sljnilar relations to the
President as those sustained by Admiral
Porter. Within a few days the real char
acter of Butler's book on* General Grant,
prepared soon after the close of the war
with a view of defeating the latter for the
Presidency, has been eomimr out through
parties now in the city, who at the time
nad access to the sheets. The work reached
the staire where certicisms were prepared
lor several journals, and the whole thing
win ready to appear when Butler, for some
reason, changed his purpose, adroitly muu
aged to get the reviews already written
back into his hands again, and from that j
time to this the book has disappeared from j
sight. There is now said to be danger that 1
one of these reviews, prepared under But
ler's own eye and directions, has passed
beyond his control, and is likely to he pub
lic' property before long. There isno doubt
but that the book, as a whole, was a very
t?itter attack upon Grant, gotten up in
Butler's most malignant *tyle.? Washing'

EUROPEAN WAR NEWS
THE FIGHTING AROUND PARIS.
Reported Repalne of the French.
&c., &oM &o.
SUMMARY OP REPORTS.
Washington, Dcc. 12.? The Dnke of
Mecklenburg has defeated tbe Third army
cor pa of the French, capturing six guns
and a thousand prisoners.
A squadron of French gunboats are pro
tecting the shipping at the mouth of the
Lo're.
A Herald special from Berlin, on the 9th,
savs: " Bismarck denies any opposition to
the bombardment of Paris, "and that it has
been determined at a reported council at
Versailles that the bombardment shallcoin
xnence."
A Tribune special from London, on t.hc
9th, says: "G.imbetta asks an armistice,
that Fnrre mar pass the lines and confer
with his colleagues. The army of the Loire
having been defeated in detail, Gambetta
prefers to make an effort for peace before
continuing the contest. The National As
semblv, however, he says, must decide."
At Berlin an anti-war riot was caused by
resistance to the draft by the married men,
and, the police being unable to quell it, se
vere measure were used by the military.
GERMAN REPORT OP FIGHTING AROUND PARIS.
Versailles. Dec. 10. ? The Duke of Meck
lenburg telegraphs, on the morning of the
10th: '? The enemy violently attacked us
yesterday, but we're victoriously repulsed
by the 17th and 22d divisions, notwithstand
ing superior force?. Beangence was occu
pied by the Germans on the 8th instant,
and Vexsou to-day."
FRENCH REPORTS.
London, Dee. 10. ? A report from General
Chausy, dated Thursday evening, says :
"Prince Charles again attacked us to-day
along the whole front. We held our posi
tion throughout the day. All this corps
were engaged from St. Laurient to Bean
gence. We camped on our positions of the
morning."
FOREIQN NEWS VIA ENGLAND.
London, Dec. 10. ? The Pall Mall Go
zcttc , in an ably-written leader, argues
against the declaration of Paris of 185G, be
cause it may transfer the carrying trade
almost entirely to the United States.
Three Russian vessels are being built,
and nearly completed, at Saunder^s ship
yard on the Thame?. The statement is that
they are to be mercantile, and not naval
ships.
It is now considered impossible for Paris
to receive assistance from the provinae*.
With the failure and retreat of the army of
the Loire, all hopes in that direction "are
lo>-t. 1 he Gcrmaus look upon the capitula
tion of that city as a question of time, and
it is announced that King William only
awaits that event, to return to Berlin. The
garrison of Belfort continues a vigorous
defence, and their patriotism excites uni
versal admiration.
FRANCE.
Bordeacx, Dec. 10.? The people of this
city are very patriotic, and are sending
large numbers of recruits to the front, ana
equipping and drilliuer more.
Gambetta, in a telegraphic circular from
the headquarters of Gen. Chanzy to the
Prefects of the Departments, says that
Chanzy continues to resist all tbe attacks
of Prince Frederick Charles and is taking
many prisoners. F rom this you may judge
how false are the German dispatches', which
st:ite tlmt the army of the Loire is crushed.
Gen. Chanzy. with half the number of that
army, successfully resists German advances.
THE GERMAN ADVANCE IN FRANCE.
London, December 10 ? The German ad
vance on Havre has turned aside to Dieppe,
wliich was probably occupied to-day.
Nntiuiiai JBoard of Trade.
Buffalo. N. y1. Dec. 12. ? 1 The National
Board of Trade passed resolutions in favor
of tbe resumption of specie values and
payment.
[SECOND DISPATCH.]
Buffalo, N. V., Dec. 12.? In the Na
tional Board of Trade to-day the subject of
land and wuter communication, after fur
ther discussion, was referred to the Execu
tive Committee, who will report at the
next meeting the resolution adopted asking
Congress to complete the works now in
progress for the improvement of the navi
gation rf the western and southern rivers,
and so prevent their obstruction by bridges,
which should be located or built under the
direction of the United States engineers :
that the railroad bridges should be located
as publi't highways, open to all railroads
on the payment of suitable tolls.
Resolutions were also adopted urging a
convention with Great Britain relative to
postal service, whereby no further sub
sidles shall be paid steam lines, but a uni
form compensation be given out of the
postage carried by the steamers of both
flags ; that until such convention is con
cluded on an equal tooting with regard to
any encouragement Congress may deem
best to give to the establishment of new
lines to Europe, and that the Government
by subsidies in lines to the West Indie*,
Central America, Australia, and the Ea<-t
Indies, to which it would not otherwise be
drawn ; and that tbe navigation laws be
modified so as to permit the' registration of
foreign-built vessels, to which ena the early
attention of Congress is requested.
The following provision from the Cin
cinnati Board ot Trade was adopted by an
overv\helmlng majority: In reference to
the revision of the taritf the desirableness
of efforts to secure such a revision of the
existing tariff laws of the United States as
shall result : 1st, in making them more
simple and more uniform ; 2d, in making
them the production of the largest reve
nue ; 3d, in making them in the 'east de
gree hiudersome to the whole people; and,
4th, in making such protection as may re
sult purely incidental, without discrimina
tion in favor of any interest.
A proposition relative to subsidies to the
Pacini railroad were referred to the execu
tive council, with instructions to memorial
ize Congress to grant liberal subsidies, and
to give such other needed legislation as will
secure the earliest construction of a more
national central Pacific railroad to Califor
nia. Several matters were laid over for con
sideration next year.
