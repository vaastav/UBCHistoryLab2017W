The Experiment Slaton.
In behalf of the people of the west
end of the county. 1). C. Hrowncll of
Umutllla, presented the subject of the
proposed experiment station for the
Umatilla project
Through the agency of President
Kerr of the Oregon agricultural col
lege the department of the Interior
and the agricultural department have
agreed to establish an experiment sta
tion upon the project. The govern
ment now offers to provide the land,
provide the water and meet one-half
the maintenance cost of the station
provided the state will meet the re
maining half.
That the state should cooperate
with the government In this matter
Mr. Brownell vigorously urged and he
gave many reasons why the station
will be of benefit to the people of that
section. I
According to Senator C. J. Smith, he J
has been Informed by Prsldent Kerr
that a sum ranging from $3000 to $1.
000 will be needed annually from the
state.

the experiment station, was the sub
ject of the branch asylum. Senator
C J. Smith was first called upon re

In response, the doctor said that
within a few years the establishment
of a branch asylum will be absolutely
necessary. Furthermore, under the
terms of an amendment passed last
June, such Institutions mny now bo
located elsewhere than nt the state
capital. The present superintendent of
the asylum Is favorable to the estab
lishment of an asylum In this section
of the state.
According to Senator Smith a bill
providing for a branch asylum will
have to he passed by the legislature
and then npproved by the people. This
will require at least two years time

San Francisco, Dec. 11. Guilty as
chargitl was the verdict brought in
by the Jury at 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon in the case of the state
against Abraham Rucf, the formei
political boss of San Francisco. Thv
Jury had been deliberating for 24
hours.
Despite the fact that the feeling was
intense and that the verdict met with
the approval of the crowd which
thronged the courtroom, the Judgft
and a score or more of detectives
succeeded In repressing any outburst.
Men were thrust into their seats how.
ever by the minions of the law. :
Ruef was visibly affected by the
verdict though his first thought seem,
ed to be of his aged father by whosv
side he sat as the verdict was read.
The maximum penalty for the crime
of which the former political boss has
been found guilty Is 14 years in thk

He declared that the real purposes
of the prosecution should be tint
merely to punish these persons and
st.nd grafters to Jail, but to purge the
government so as to establish th
equality of men In the eyes of the
law.
Langdon said this. conviction Is only
a forerunner of others. "The arch
criminal of San Francisco Is now on
his way to the penitentiary."
Detective Burns declared that it
was plainly a peoples victory and that
the people had been vindicated.
Heney made the following state,
ment: "It is" needless to say that I am
deeply gratified with the result, but
I fully expected a conviction if none
of the Jurors were reached by Ruef's
agents. It is evident that all are hon.
est."
Johnson's statement was: "We have
disproved that our law Is a shame,
our administration of justice a trav
esty. Ruef's race Is run. His con
vlction sounds the death knell of his
system and of his accomplices, the
Public Service corporations and the
system by which the political bos
sells to an equally guilty corporation
boss privileges and lights which be
long to the people. Henceforth
Ruef Is personally eliminated from
this city."
Langdon said: "The public is faN
mlllnr with the evidence, which made
It apparent that no honest jury could
do other than convict. The graft
prosecution will continue until it l
demonstrated that San Francisco h
capable of enforcing laws, that the
courts and Juries are not a mockery
and a shame."
