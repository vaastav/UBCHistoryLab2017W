Chicago, Dec. 14. A dU patch to I

'says:
A. special message cn the Japanese
question and the California school
problem, supplementary to his treat
ment of the same by President Roose
velt in lis regular message last week,
will be sent to congress from the
White House next Tuesday. It is
stated authoritively that this special
message will be more vigorous In
tone than the former communication
and -will not bo calculated to cool tne
Indignation of Californians.
The special message, moreover,
aside from its local application will
be one of the most notable and im
portant communications in tho entire
list of those sent to congress by the
present executive. It will bring to
a direct lsaiK- the centralization
scheme of the government, which is
Hkely to form tho climax of an en
deavor on the part of the administrate
tlon. The administration Is about to
. take advaacod ground regarding the
doctrine of federal supremacy over
state sovereignty. 1
The Japanese question, raised in
connection with the school system of
California, has supplied the opportun
ity to give forcible expression to the
mighty scheme of centralization that'
is to be -perfected if possible. Them
Is no possiblo forecast of the detail
of what the president will say in his
second message on th Japanese ques
tion. Accompanying his message, - which
It is understood will fee an explana

Regardless of the nature of this re
port, the president will adhere vigor
ously to the position taken by him
in his regular message. As to Met
calf's report it has been learned that
its author found much to condemn in
the matter of treatment of Japanese
outside of the school question. It will
show, it is understood, the labor
union tyranny over the Japanese,
which affects the rights h-tld to be
theirs by treaty, in even a more pro
nounced manner than anything con
nected with the school embrogllo.
Matters of this nature in Metcalf's
report will furnish a key for many

DEMOCRATS TAKEALARM AT
ROOT'S LATE PREACHMENT
New York, Dec. 14. Edward M.
Shepard declares that the democratic
party should accept the issue of cen
tralization of power in the federal
government made by Secretary Root
in his address Wednesday night.
"I think the existence of the demo
cratic party la. more necessary day af
ter day," Shepard said, '"aad especial
ly do I think so after considering this
speech of the man who may truthfully
be called a trained statesman,, al
though' his idea of what our govern
"ment should be is abhorrent to me.
He proposes as policy what we may
call the destruction of the states and
the complete and final subordination
of state power to federal power in
Washington. The fight of the demo
cratic party against this idea goes
back to days preceding the adoption
of the federal constitution, aad to
that we owe the fact that the federal
and consolidated- republic was estab
lished.

150 Horse Power Engine
Runs Away with Disas-.
' trous Results
VERY EXPENSIVE DAMAGES
All Street Cars Will Be Tied Up
Until Tomorrow
Morning.
Because its governor stopped, a
150- horso power Ideal englae, owned
by the Albuquerque Gas, Electric
I.laht and Power company, ran away
with lUelf it the Albuquerque Elec
tric Power company's ptant at the
lumber mills at 11:30 o'clock last
night and broke all to pieces.
The engine- was one employed In
pullias two generators, which fur
nished electricity for the Albuquerque
Traction company, and as a result of
the catastrophe. Albuquerque is with
out street car service today,
Tho actual - damage in dollars and
cents could not be estimated today,
but it will amount to several -thousand
dollars.
At noon Manager Frank 8tortz, of
the Traction company, thought that
he could have cars running by tomor
row morning. The generators, which
were hitched to -th destroyed engine,
escaped Injury and are being moved
Ecross the big power room of the Al
buquerque Electric Power company t"
another engine of 350 horse power,
and ag soon an this is done, the cars
will be started going.
Wreck Was Complete.
So complete was the wreck that
there Is scarcely a part of the de
stroyed entrine that can be used again.
The fly wheels, six feet la diameter
snd weighing 3,500 pounds each, were
broken into pieces, no one of which
would weigh more than fifty pounds.
The spokes of the wheels, several
Inches in thickness aad of cast iron
were stripped from the hnbbs as
though they were tooth picks. One
piece, probably weighing fifty pounds,
knocked a hole In the top of the en
gine room fifty feet alove the dis
mantled englae. Another struck the
steel frame of the building forty feet
above, bending It as though It were a
mere lattice work of wood. The cylin
der and guide of the engine, a solid
piece weighing probably 8,000 pounds
was wrenched from Its moorlags on
a foundation of cement and steed, and
hurled ten feet to the pit of the en
gine room. The loltg which held tnis
pltce were snapped square off. The
belts were torn lato shreds.
Cause of the Wreck.
The engine was one which did six
years service iu the city plant of the
Albuquerque Gas, Electric Light snd
Power company, near tho Santa Ke
freight depot, and was only moved to
the plaat of the Albuquerque Electric
rower, company about a month ago.
It was in very good condition, with
the exception that the main shaft was
slightly bent and that it was a little
the worse for wear. But these fault
are not considered tne immediate!
cause of the wreck. No one was la
tho Immediate vicinity of It at the
time, and the exsel cause is not
kiiowu. Engineer Hleks, who Is on
duty at night, had retired this morn
ing sd a statement from him could
not lie secured. A. D. Coleman, an
eleetrii lan for the Traction company,
surveyed the wreck this morn'ng and
srid that bis theory was that the en
gine actually ran away with' itself.
Tho Kovenior probably became sta- I
tionary from dirt or some other!
cause. The normal speed of the en
gine, which is 300 revolutions, to the
minute, then increased to 600 or 600
revolutions or until the metal In the
wheels could ' not withstand the in
crease of centrifugal force.' Both
fly Wheels went at once and the en
gine went with thorn. : The pieces
are strewn all over the west end of
the engine room and were thrown
with such Violence thiit had any one
been struck by them, death would
have most likely been lh Result. '
