The President's Message
President Wilson's message to Congress is a
disappointment to those who were expecting a
masterly solution of after-the-war problems.
The only big problem discussed is that of the
railroads, and on this topic the president merely
advocates that they revert back to private owner
ship, and that Congress at once take up a study
"of the question. The'nation expected an exhaust
jve discussion of the many factors involved in
trying to restore the carriers to private owner
ship after months of federal control. The presi
dent says: "I frankly turn to you for counsel
upon it. I have no confident judgment of my
qwn."
His tribute to the American soldiers and non
combatants for their whole-hearted co-operation
in fighting and in producing the weapons of war
is a sincere expression of the president. It is
worded in the masterly style of the chief execut
ive. This high sentiment is weakened considerably
by his explanation of why it is necessary for him
to attend the peace conference. He offers no
reason why the senate was completely ignored
and why he, single-handed and alone, must shoul
der the whole responsibility of the momentous
factors involved in drawing up the final terms
of the treaty.
If the American people, on his own admission,
unflinchingly supported him during the war per
iod, it would seem appropriate and fitting that
the president would consult their wishes regard
ing the peace terms, or at least show them the
courtesy of respecting the body to which the
'founders of the republic entrusted treaty mak
ing authority.
Public Ownership No Panacea
Under this caption the Indianapolis Star dis
cusses government ownership of railroads, re
citing the experience of European governments
with railroads, and concluding with the proposi
tion that private ownership of railroads in Amer
ica with sensible regulation is preferable to fed
eral control. The editorial follows :
Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking before the
Institute of Arts at Columbia University, sound
ed a note of warning against government owner
ship and control. He explained that government
ownership tends toward inefficiency and char
acterized as enemies of liberty those "whose in
terests lie simply in extending the activities of
government so as to embrace all industry." The
problems he discussed are not untried and should
be viewed in the light of experience elsewhere.
Canada, our next door neighbor, has had bit
ter experience with government ownership. It
recently has been forced, as a war emergency
measure, to extend its railway holdings, but that
was not from preference on the part of the people.
The government lent its credit to the promoters
of some of the great lines that were extended
into the unsettled Northwest. Then the war
came and killed the business those roads planned
to get and the government had to step in to pro
tect the tens of millions it already had invested.
Canada years ago spent millions of dollars in
the construction of lines into the maritime pro
vinces and later leased those lines to private cor
porations to operate. Manitoba became so ob
sessed with the public ownership idea a decade
or more ago that the government took over the
elevators for the farmers and took over the tele
phones in the province. The experiment was a
failure in each case and both the elevators and
the telephones were turned over to private op
eration. .The experience of European nations that have
tried government ownership of railways has been
almost uniformly disappointing. The govern
some years before the war took over the Western
Railway of France and at the end of four years
the net revenue had fallen to $5,350,000. The
lowest any year under private ownership was
$13,750,000. Belgium had under discussion in
1914 the proposal to turn its state railways over
to private corporations in the interest of effi
ciency. The government railways in Russia, in Scan
dinavia and in other parts of Europe never were
conducted as effectively as similar roads under
private ownership. American advocates of gov
ernment ownership cite the low fares on some
lines in congested areas. Those are third-class
fares. First-class costs as much or more than in
this country. Americans would not stand for
third-class nor the quality of service that is given
on the governmental railways of Europe.
This country has the greatest network of
railways in the world. We have enjoyed rates
and service that are marvels to strangers from
abroad. All that was developed under competi
tion and by business rivalry. Much of the pro
gress our railways made was in the face of ham
pering legislation from states and nation. The
railways should not be permitted to do as they
please, but if they are given a square deal, as
business institutions, they will provide better ser
vice and at less cost than the public can hope to
get from the numbing influence of bureaucratic
government ownership.

As a rule the big man that I go to for information is the
very soul of kindness. Sometimes I have asked very
simple Questions of clerks and office boys and have been
insulted for my pains, but I have seldom been rebuffed
by a clerk's employer, even when I have asked apparent
ly embarrassing questions. I do not think this is because
clerks and office boys are at heart any worse than their
employers, but it is probably because the latter, having
had more experience, have learned that it is good busi
ness as well as a source of great satisfaction to be polite."

"Shut that door!" yelled the rough
man. "Where were you raised, In a
barn?" The man addressed meekly and
silently complied, but the speaker
looking at him a moment later observ
ed that he was in tears. Going rver
to his victim he apologized. "Oh,

not take It to heart because I asked if
you were raised in a barn."
"That's it, that's it." sobbed the
other man. "I was raised in a barn

"Yes, I do. I am surprised that you

"Well, I came to say I need another.
That was insufficient to pay my lodg

Raphael handed out the other florin
somewhat ruefully, saying:
"I know what business your de

"What?" asked the impecunious one.
"Retouching old masters."
The scientist was giving a lecture,

"Pardon me," said a man in the
audience, nervously, "how long did
you say it would be before this ter

"Why, about seventy million years,"
repeated the scientist.
"Thank heaven!" exclaimed the
questioner, wifh a sigh of relief. "I
thought you said seven million." .
