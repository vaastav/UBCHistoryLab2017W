ing with many of our tubscriberi, at their re-
JWSOMB very religioui individual, who
eeki to aid the editor of the Gazette ia his
orusade against Christianity and the church
es, furnished that paper last week with an
attack upon the churches of St. Cluirwilie,
in doggeral rhyme.
It is a little remarkable that these Con
perhcad church goers (?) are so ready to
construe every referenoe by a Minister of
the Gospel to the country, the officers of
toe bovernment, or the officers and koldiers
of the army, either in prayer or sermon.
into "political preaching" and equally so
that they should manifest ciich a persistent
uuiui.uiuai.iwu iu loroe tuo ministry to quit
braying "for those in authority," as di
rected by Paul, or, if they cannot do this,
to break up the oharches.
They claim to be gooi tlmon men. but
cannot tolerate a prayer for t'he success of
the Union cause. They profess te be in
favor of the overthrow of the Rebellion,
but think it wrong for a minister to ask the
Gad of Battles to hasten that event Thoy
declare themselves in- laror of sustaining
the Government, but the preachers should
wot ak the Infinite to give wiadoui to these
whose duty it is to administer it. They pro
j'ess to be the friends of the soldier j but if
minister, in his discourse on charity or
benevolence, asks his oongrega'tion to con
tribute of their substanoe to the Christian
or Sanitary Commissions, they declare him
apolitical preacher, and will not' go to hear
btih.
To such a remarkable erterrt have these
Anti-Polnicar Christians Carried' their pre
judiees upon this subject that they have de
prived themselves almost entirely of ohurch
privileges for, tVanfc Ged,' the churohes
are loyal U the Gavommcnf, and the niin
inters, true to her cause, and pruy for her
success and the welfare of hei brave armies.
The following Occurrence, we think, very
fairly represents the extent td which these
saints have carried their morbid sonnibili
ties upon the subjuct of political preaching,
and at the same time shows how ridiculous
a position they sometimes take upon this
subjeet: Two neighbors, in at. adjoining
town in this eounty, belonging to different
churches, met, and, their convention turn
in g upon church, mattery one of them,
whom we shall name Coppef, said :
"I have quit going to ohurch, for the!
preacher dot's nothing but pre.toh politics."
The ether whom we will call Loyalty, .-aid:'
' Does your preacher preach ptilitios? "
Copper" Yos; he can scareely .preach
anything elre. " . '.:.''
Loy dty " Well, just do you come over
next S.ibbath and hear our preacher. H.
never mentions politics in the pulpit. "
Copper " Well, 1 will coma and hear
him, for I am thoroughly disgusted with
political preaching, and would like to hear
a sermon that had none ol It in it. "
The nest Sabbath, true to his agreement,
'Copper, in oompany with Loyalty, went to
liear the preacher who never preached poli
tics. The minister took his text, 1 Peter,'
A, 18: "If the righteous soaroely be saved,
'where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?"
and preached a regular orthodox sermon.
After service Loyalty said :
' Well, how did you like that sermon? "
' 'Copper" Pid n't like it at all j too uiuoh
Ptobm in it. "
Zyd!lg,i1vn muoh politiosl Why
t.Vere was no politio in it at all I "
CoAy "Yes tber.; was. Did n't he
akleV.Vtxt: If the rhteous Repub
licans soaioely be saved, whet taaIl the un
godly DemociSU and sinners appear? and
Uii n't he talk all' the way throug.h bout
b' angodly Democrats? I '11 never B
liea another sermon preaohod until mjniu

. Siooe that time Copper has kept out of
Vhe Church, but he'i a" very regular attend

On Iast8abbath week the new M. E. Church
was dedicated, Rev. Ma. Davideon, P. E.,
conducting the exeroises, in the absence of
Bishop Clark, who did not got there, in
consequence of railroads failing to connect.
At the close of the dedication sermon, it
was announced that the church was 11,300
in debt Contributions were solicited, and
at the olose of the evening services it was
ascertained that ,360 had been raited

The church is beautifully frescoed, and ia
finished in the most modern an 1 annroved
style. It is heated by flues, well carpeted,
is furnished with a chandelier, sofa, pulnit
stand. &c, and will seat 500 persons. The
choir is seated to the right of the pulpit,
facing the congregation, which, we think, is
a deoided improvement. Two or three of
the ladies of the town presented the ohurch

Everything is complete, thev are out of
