ALEXANDRIA, VA.
FRIDAY, DECEMBERS.
The defalcation in'the Treasury Depart uieut,
iu the ease of .Marden, mentioned it) yesterday's
Gazette, has developed other frauds of heavy
sums of money, aud the books show that hy
meaoa of abstraction at different periods, within
about two years, an amount of over $50,000
has been stolen from the government in tho
cash room of the Treasury, the offenders being
Marden and Seth Johnson, interest teller.
The discovery of Mardeu's guilt led the way to
the discovery ot Johnson's crime. The latter,
it is said, has beeu dealiug in gold aud stock
speculations,and has beeu losing for some time.
There docs not seem to have beeu any roll union
between the two, and it appears that neither
knew of the crime of the other. Mardoti and
Johnson hare both beeu arrested.
it is uow sajd that "Senator Trumbull states
that he knows nothing whatever of the account
of an alleged interview with him on the presidential
question, as published in the Louisville
fYmrior-Journal. and widely copied in the papers.
Nothiug of the kind, according to his
recollection, ever took plaiv. The account
represented him as giviug his adhesion to
Grant for re-election." Most of the aecouuts
of "interviews" with prominent meu. are now
generally considered as "lying bulletins.

The Republican' meetings tu England have
recently boeu disturbed by confusion and disorder
by many of those present at them. But

government would not have permitted these
meetiugs.

Agriculture in tup. south.?The Colli mi:
sioner of Agriculture, in his report accouipuu)
ing the President's message, speaking of t h
needs of southern agriculture, says:
"It must be conceded that the course of ap
riculture in the southern States has not bee
conducted with that care, skill, and regard fu
ultimate results, which have characterize. 1 (h
operations of fanners in other States. Whil
their lands are continuously devoted to cot. to
and tobacco until they have arrived at a stat
of exhaustion, those of the North are eontii;
ually improving by rotation of crops, which i
absolutely essential to the life of the soil itself
and without which farming and planting liu.
belter be abandoned.''
lie says that the southern States sufl'e
greatly in their interests for want of grasses, i
the use of which their productions would b
greatly increased by rendering a rotation o
crops necessary. Clover,with its deep roots, am
rye grass?a strong grower? will well endnr

Malarious Casks. ?An invention that, ma;

the same as common glass, into a hull), and thi
"gasophener" is rcadv for use. When firsi
mailt' this bulb is perfectly dear, but on bciiif
brought iutOTOutari with carbouic acid gas, i
becomes clouded with a light blue film, giving
au opal lustre. Ry gentle reheating, the filn
passes away. St great is the. delicacy of tin
gasopheticr. that the breath of a child or i
healthy person breathed ou the bulb cau bt

Lvnchburf Renublican relates the following in
u cideut as having occurred in the Corporation
d Court of ihut city Monday, during the trial oi
if X. T. William?. charged with malicious assault
tv on policeman Henry B Mosbv
)f| rl hree witnesses were examined, Mosby, the
policeman, and two colored men, when the
e Coin's. Attorney acknowledged that he had failr
cd to make out a case, and declared that he
i- would not further prosecute. The Judge at
is this point took exception at the position assumed
by the Corn's. Attorney, and expressed
.. a denre to hear argument, but as far as the
j (.'om'n. Attorney was concerned he declined to
take any further steps in the prosecution.?
Messrs. Goggin and Williams, counsel for the
accused, then briefly renewed the evidence,
which thc-y claimed failed to sustain the in
A dictment. and the caso being submitted to the
" jury they promptly rendered a verdict that the
accused was not guilty as charged iu the intr
dictincnt. The Judge then took occasion to
. say that while the verdict of the jury was a correct
one, in vie.v of the position of the Corn's.
Attorney, he nevertheless thought a verdict
i- should have been rendered for unlawful assault
il and battery, and that as a conservator of the
e peace he should require tin- acquitted paity to

nestly supported by (Jen. < I rant, was most ear'
nestly opposed at the opening of the present

to refer it to a select committee. Mr. 1 Ian Jail
objected to the whole project; said that the first

e thirty-live millions of dollars, and that, apart
e from the evil of exposing the whole business of

e it would have the further evil of increasing the
i- patronage of the (jovernment by the addition
s of twenty-five thousand offices. Mr. Xiblack

d out what an immense field would be tlirowu
open to political partisans, and how every delr
