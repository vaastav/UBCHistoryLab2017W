*'Hugh! Ido not know that name.
Z like it. It sounds strong.” Then,
with a vivid blush, but a certain
steadiness, as if she had made up her
mind, she said. “Good night, dear
Hugh.”
Glynn clasped her in his arms and
kissing her tenderly, implored her to
take courage.
Lambert, having determined to de
clare himself to Deering, was less
nervously anxious to keep in hiding,
and even drove with Glynn and Elsie
as far as Lady Gethin’s the morning
of the day the latter were to start for
the Continent. He wanted, he said,
to see the last of his child.
“The last for the next few weeks,”
Corrected Glynn.
“May be so, may be so,” said Lam
bert, with a sad ring in his voice.
Lambert and Elsie had retired to
have a few words in private in Lady
Gethln’s boudoir. Thither she and
Glynn followed them, the latter draw
ing Elsie into the conservatory ad
joining.
“The next fortnight will be awfully
blank,” he exlaimed, when they were
out of earshot. “By that time I
trust all difficulties will be surmount
ed, and I shall be able to start with
your father for Lausanne: than I
trust there will only be peace and
love for you both in the future.”
“Would to God this terrible inter
val were over!” said Elsie, with a
sigh.
"I Intend to insist on your father’s
staying with me in my chambers until
he is free to join you! Trust him to
me, dearest,” replied Glynn.
“How good you are! How can I j
ever thank you enough?” cried Elsie,
and carried away by tenderness and j
gratitude her arms stole round his j
neck, and she kissed him repeatedly ■
In all the simple sincerity of unhesi- j
tating affection.
Soon after, as it was growing late,
Lambert purposed returning to his
lodgings. He had said good-bye to
Lady Gethin, and tenderly embraced
Elsie. He had even gone half-way
down stairs when he suddenly
paused, and turning back exclaimed:
*‘l must take one more look at her,”
and ascending to the drawing room,
took her hand in both his own. “My
own jewel! Have I made you happy? j
Will you pardon me any wrong I may
have done you?”
“Wrong!—you have done me noth
ing but good. No father ever made a
daughter happier than you have made
me.”
“Then give ms a loving thought
how and again. God bless you, my
darling. Good-bye, good-bye.”
*‘Only for a little while, dearest,
best!” she exclaimed. “Be careful,
and come to me soon!”
There was little or no difficulty in
persuading Lambert to accept his
future son-in-law’s invitation.
In Glynn’s chambers he revived
Considerably.
Glynn carefully avoided any ap
pearance of change in his habits, and
Went out to dinners and parties as
usual. At one of these he en
countered Deering, and took the in
itiative by asking if he had been all
this time in the country, as he had
not seen him anywhere lately.
“I stayed longer than I intended
at Denham. But you have been
rather scarce lately. I haven’t seen
you in the haunts of men.”
“I think I have been as much about
as usual. By the way, is your Amer
ican friend Vincent in town? I fan
cied I saw him the other day in Bond
street.”
“Vincent! yes; at least he was last
week. He will not give up the chass
after Lambert and his daughter. My
own belief is that Lambert never
quitted England."
“I go down to Denham on Wednes
day for a few days. lam making al- |
terations there and want to look after
them.”
“Well, good night."
Glynn returned with so much infor- ,
mation for Lambert, who was evi- j
dently stirred by it. “I am better and i
stronger,” he said, rising and stretch- |
Ing himself; “I’ll take heart, and go I
talk to him in the midst of his iil- |
gotten property: maybe he’ll reason.
“Anyway, I’ll not bear this state of
misery any longer. I’ll find freedom
somehow!” cried Lambert, with an
air of determination.
CHAPTER XL
Paid in Full.
“I feel like myself,” said Lambert
to his host, a few days after the en
counter above recorded. "I’ll go
down to Denham to-morrow, and get
my interview with Deering over.”
“ r am not at all sure you are equal
to it, Lambert: you are feverish and i
excited. Why not wait till he comes I
up to town?” j
“Because I’d feel safer in the coun- i
try. Constables are not so near at
band In the country.
“I’ll go and sleep at my own place
to-night; and I’ll start off to-morrow
morning. Maybe I’ll be lucky, hey?
He pulled out Elsie’s last letter and j
read it through in si!nce -
happy, anyway, but
for her old dad! God bless her!
God bless her. and watch over her!”
k—wdth a burst of feeling
•Til not write to you, Glynn,'
were his last words at starting. 1 H
just come straight back and tell you
everything.”
“Do; and remember that the bolder
front you can show, the greater the
chance of his yielding. Speak as if
you bad a cloud of witnesses to back
you.” .
“Ay, that’s the plan! I’ll try it, if
only my nerves beep as steady as they
feel to-day.”
The chief inn of Earlshall. a small
on the borders of Norths’uire.
Sljc 'pfinjfc fEnqtiifff.
! was full and busy one morning in
May, more than twelve months from
the opening of this true story. It
; was market day.
The stables were full of strong,
i serviceable nags, worthy of the shire
j which bred them, and the busy host
i lers had scarce time to attend to the
! demand of a stranger, who had been
staying for the last two days at the
: inn, that one or other of them should
saddle the horse he Lad ridden each
| day since he arrived.
1 “Hand it over to me, and I’ll sad
-1 die him myself,” he said at length.
! “I am no fool about a horse, and can
! generally manage all I want with my
1 own nanas.” so saying, he proceeded
: to saddle the steed he had selected,
! and soon trotted out of the yard.
I A stranger was a novelty at Earls
[ hall, and several inquiries were ad
| dressed to “mine host,” who mixed on
pleasant, easy terms with his guests,
j “The visitor was from ‘Lunnon’ or
! from furrin parts.” But he knew a
horse when he saw one; he had been
over to Denham all day long; the
landlord’s opinion was that likely he
came from a newspaper, and he
hoped as how he would write up the
“Black Horse.” There was a letter
for him that morning from Denham.
“I know the paper and the crest
stamped outside.” added the host;
“I dare say he’s an electioneering
chap.”
Unconscious of these comments
Lambert rode on with a grey, set
face, and firmly closed mouth. The
letter he had received that morning
had been brief—“l will hear what
you have to say, but I do not wish a
criminal to cross my threshold. You
j must meet me by the Deer’s Barn in
j the Beech Wood, about a mile from
the village. Any one will direct you.”
: This had no signature and was ad
-1 dressed to “Mr. Smith.” Lambert
j took it out and read It. gnashing his
teeth as he did so.
“The insolent, daring villain.” he
muttered: “can I do nothing to turn
his flank? If he had a gleam of con- j
science he would be less daringly un
scrupulous, but he hasn’t enough to ;
make a coward of him. Glynn is my |
best card, but Deering knows his
strength; he has only to lie boldly,
and I am at his mercy.
“I must keep my brain clear,” he
muttered. “I wish I could get quit of
I this mad desire to shoot Deering—it I
wouldn’t do —it wouldn’t do. I could
never stroll through cool country
lanes with my Elsie again; I never
could stroke her bright hair with this
right hand if it had committed mur
der. That I have never done. No,
Deering, you infernal liar!—only in
fair fight have I killed my man.”
When he reached the very humble
little hostelry distinguished by the
sign of the “Saracen’s Head,” the
crest of the Deerings, which stood be- |
side the village green of Denham, 1
Lambert was cool and collected |
enough. He dismounted, and desired j
that his horse should be given a feed |
of oats, that the girths should be !
loosened, but the saddle was not to |
be removed, “for,” said he very de
liberately, “I want to finish a sketch
of the Deer’s Barn, and get back to
catch the up-train at Earlshall about
6, so I may want the horse all in a
hurry."
So saying, he walked quietly
through the great old wrought-iron
gates, and up the stately avenue for j
a few hundred yards. Then striking j
to the left, he quickened his pace, j
and plunged into the beautiful woods. !
And all these grand woods, this i
beautiful sweep of hills, these groups !
of dappled deer, that murmuring j
brown stream, the solemn, stately
beeches that clustered round the barn
which stood at the verge of the deer
park—all these were Elsie’s; an. as
he thought, Travers Deering came
out from the shadow of the rough,
picturesque edifice and advanced to
meet him.
The two men came face to face a
little !n the rear of the barn, and
stood in silence for a few seconds,
eyeing each otherwith deadly hatred: j
nor was the gaze of the unscrupulous
villain a shade less steady or un
flinching than that of the man he in
tended to make his victim.
“Pray, why have you taken the
trouble to come down here, when you
might have seen me in town next
week?” asked Deering coolly.
“For various reasons, chiefly be
cause I could not wait.”
“Then you have something im
portant, something favorable for
yourself to propose. First, wher- is
Elsie? You know?”
“I do."
“Is she in England?”
“No.”
“Will you tell me where she is?”
“I will further cn."
“Very good; let ms hear what you
! have to say,” taking out a cigar, and
1 striking a fusee he lit it with elab
-1 orate composure.
“i succeeded in hiding myself and
my child from you and your devilish
designs," began Lambert in a voice
that vibrated with th anger he could
hardly control. “However, I couldn’t
j carry out my plans, and I know one
- - ? : ght forever, so
, miuj to see if we can t
come to an agreement. Hot us go,
and I’ll never say a word against you,
or meddle in any way.”
“Is that all you have to say for
yourself?" returned Deering. con
temptuously. “I tiiough* you had
something new.”
“So I have! I have found a man
who believes my story, and he is a
backer not to be despised.”
"And he is?” asked Deering, with
out taking hia cigar from his lips.
“Glynn! You know him.”
“Ha! and he believes your little
romance?” —a look of concentrated
fury contracting his brow. “Satisfac
tory to you; but unfortunately men’s
beliefs are. not evidence. Now 1 have

positive evidence.”
“Deering!—you are the most ac
cursed scoundrel that ever disgraced
God’s earth! Were It not for my
child, I’d gladly pay forfeit with my
life for the pleasure of killing you.”
“Knowing my man, I am not such
a blockhead as to come here un
armed,” and he made a motion with
his hand to his breast pocket.
“Good,” cried Lambert, and he
laughed a peculiar wild laugh. “But
this is nonsense,” he resumed; “let
us talk like reasonable beings. Just
see what folly it is to throw away
fortune and all this” —waving his
hand towards the trees and upland—
“for what?—a whim, a bit of re
venge! When you have destroyed
me, and planted a thorn in Elsie’s
heart, that’ll pierce her through her
life long—how will you like to turn
out of this grand place, and count
every penny in your pocket?”
“I don’t intend to do either; I shall
be rewarded for my disinterested
honesty by keeping the estate for my
life. My son, a mere helpless cripple,
can exist on a trifle; my lady wife is
only half alive as it is, and probably
may resign the frail half she pos
sesses before long, then I may marry
my sweet cousin, and all will go well
and happily when we have hung you,
you blundering blackguard”—with a
sudden flash of rage and hatred.
“Gently,” said Lambert, thinking
the moment was come to play hia
trump card. “You’ll not be able to
carry out your neat little scheme.
My Elsie is engaged to Glynn and
will be his wife before three weeks
are over. She is staying with Lady
Gethin until the wedding takes
place!”
Deering was moved at last, and
started back.
“What! has Glynn known your se
cret during ”
“The last month and more,” inter
rupted Lambert.
“And Lady Gethin?—is she equally
well informed?”
“She is.”

Power From the Tides.
Attention is once more called to
this subject by the proposed estab
lishment of a power plant based on
the use of the tides to compress air
at Rockland, Me. At that place there
exists a natural tidal basin covering
an area of about one square mile.
The average rise and fall of the tide
is twelve feet. It has been calculated
by the engineers in charge of the pro
ject that 5000 horse power can be de
veloped. assuming an efficiency of
; seventy per cent, for the air com-
I pressing apparatus. It has been
| shown that compressed air can be
j transmitted long distances through
pipes with very little loss of power,
and it is proposed to supply such air
to stone quarries situated within a
radius of twenty miles from the tidal
basin. It is pointed out that many
similar tidal basins exist elsewhere
along the seacoast. —Youth’s Com

If there he any noticeable falling
off in the cat population hereabouts it
may without doubt be attributed to

ished to make the coat heavy and

Austria Catching the Fever
By HOMER EDMISTON.
In April, Austria’s new naval pro
gram was published, which calls for
three, and maybe four. Dreadnoughts
to be ready in 1912, besides the
three new battleships that will soon
be finished. Of course, every in
crease of Austrian naval force in the
Mediterranean tends to alienate Italy
from the Triple Alliance. England
and France are, and must continue
to be, the great naval powers of the
Mediterranean, and Austria might
easily become a third. And it is pre
cisely with these three powers that
Italy’s relations are now the most
cordial. Austria’s program means
that the two great Germanic powers
of Central Europe, which are now
working completely in harmony, will
soon have a strong naval base in the
Mediterranean. What-England thinks
about it is plainly to be seen in the
recent establishment of a combined
military and naval department of the
Mediterranean, with Malta as its |
headquarters and Lord Kitchener in |
command. That Italy, with her long j
coast line and few defensible harbors, j
and with her many important cities
on or near the sea, has reason for
alarm, is out of all question. Her
policy of maintaining a fleet twice as
strong as that of any other power
whose coast line is exclusively Medi
terranean, announced by Admiral
Mirabello in 1907, has been seriously
menaced. —The Atlantic.

President Toft Sends to Con
gress His Review of Gov
ernmental Affairs and His
Recommendations
. Based Thereon.
HIGH COST OF LIVING DISCUSSED
Washington, D. C. President
Taft’s first annual message to the
Congress is, in part, as follows:
To the Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives:
The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have
continued upon the normal basis of
amity and good understanding and
are very generally satisfactory.
Pursuant to the provisions of the
general treaty of arbitration conclud
ed between the United States and
Great Britain, April 4, 1908, a special
agreement was entered into between
the two countries on January 27,
1909, for th© submission of questions
relating to the fisheries on the North
Atlantic coast to a tribuna 1 . to be
formed from members of the perma
nent court of arbitration at The
Hague.
In accordance with the provisions
of the special agreement the printed
case of each government was, on Oc
tober 4 last, submitted to the other
and to the arbitral tribunal at The
Hague, and the counter case of the
United States Is now in course of
preparation.
This, adds, the President, is the
first case involving'such great inter
national questions which has been
submitted to the permanent court of.
arbitration at The Hague.
The President states that the treaty
between the United States and Great
Britain for the marking and defining
of the boundary line between this
country and Canada in the waters of
Passamaquoddy Bay makes it neces
sary to submit the question to arbi
tration.
The regulations for the protection
of food fishes in international bound
ary waters of the United States and
Canada compiled by the commission
under the convention of April 11,
1908, will be duly subfttted to Con
gress with a view to the enactment
of such legislation as will be neces
sary under the convention to put
them into operation.
Negotiations for an international
conference to reach an arrangement
providing for the preservation and
protection of the fur seals in the
North Pacific are in progress satis
factorily with the governments of
Great Britain, Japan and Russia.
The President then devotes a para
graph to the second peace conference
at The Hague and the question of an
international prize court. He speaks
of the conference held in London
from December 2, 1908, to February
26, 1909, as having resulted in an
eminently satisfactory codification of
the international maritime law.
Reference is then made to. the sub
ject of reforms in the Congo. The
President says the attitude of the
United States is one of benevolent
encouragement.
Announcement is made that a satis
factory patent convention with Ger
many is now in force and that efforts
for the making of similar treaties
with other European governments are
now in progress.
The report of our commissioners
who went on a friendly mission to
Liberia has just been completed and
ianow under examination by the De
partment of State. It is hoped, re
marks the Message, that there may
result some helpful measures, in
which case it may he my duty again
to Invite your attention to this sub
ject.
After felicitating Turkey on her
quick transition of the government
from one of retrograde tendencies
to a constitutional government, the
Message turns to a discussion of
Latin American affairs, observing
that one of the happiest events in
recent pan-American diplomacy was
the pacific, independent settlement
by the governments of Bolivia and
Peru of a boundary difference be
tween them, which for some weeks
threatened to cause war.
The President continues:
The pan-American policy of this
Government has long been fixed in its
principles and remains unchanged.
With the changed circumstances of
the United States and of the repub
lics to the south of us, most of which
have great natural resources, stable
government and progressive ideals,
the apprehension which gave rise to
the Monroe doctrine may be said to
have nearly disappeared, and neither
the doctrine as it exists nor any other
doctrine of American policy should
be permitted to operate for the per
petuation of Irresponsible govern
ment, the escape of just obligations
or the isidious allegation of dominat
ing ambitions on the part of the Uni
ted States.
Mr. Taft expresses his pleasure at
meeting President Diaz of Mexico, and
then remarks that all but one of the
cases which for so long vexed our re
lations with Venezuela have been set
tled and provision has been made for
arbitration of the remaining cases be
fore The Hague tribunal.
The Panama government has
agreed to indemnify the relatives of
American officers and sailors who

The President gives a glowing ac
count of our relations with Cuba, and
says the collection of the customs of

in accordance with the convention of
February 8, 1907, has proceeded in

Edward VII.
The Message does not dwell at
great length on the complications
caused by the methods -of the Zelaya
Government of Nicaragua. On this
subject it says:
At the date when this Message is
printed this Government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya Government for reasons made
public in a communication to the
former Nicaraguan Charge d’Af
faires and is intending to take such
future steps as may be found most
consistent with its dignity, its duty
to American interests and its moral
obligations to Central America and to
civilization. It may later be neces
sary for me to bring this subject to
the attention of the Congress in a
special message.
In the far east, writes the Presi
dent, this Government preserves un
changed its policy of supporting the
principle of equality of opportunity
and scrupulous respect for the integ
rity of the Chinese Empire, to which
policy are pledged the interested
powers of both east and west. When
it appeared that Chinese llkin rev
enues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project it was obvious
.that the governments whose nation
als held this loan would have a cer
tain direct Interest In the question
of the carrying out by China of the
reforms in question. After months
of negotiation the equal participation
of Americans seems at last assured.
China is making admirable efforts
toward the eradication of the opium
evil, and Mr. Taft recommends that
the manufacture, sale and use of
opium and its derivatives In the
United States should be so far as
possible more vigorously controlled
by legislation.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese Empire continue cordial, as
usual. The matter of a revision of
the existing treaty between the
United States and Japan which is
terminable in 1912 is already receiv
ing the study of both countries.
The Department of State is con
sidering also the revision in whole or
in part of the existing treaty with
Siam.
Continuing, the President writes;
I earnestly recommend to the fa
vorable action of the Congress the
estimates submitted by the Depart
ment of State and most especially
the legislation suggested in the Sec
retary of State’s letter of this date
whereby it will be possible to develop
and make permanent the reorganiza
tion of the department upon modern
lines in a manner to make it a thor
oughly efficient instrument in the
furtherance of our foreign trade and
of American interests abroad.
The Message then turns to the
consideration of the subject of rev
enues and expenditures, as follows:
Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented to this administration
is that of economy in expenditures
and sufficiency of revenue.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury shows that the ordinary ex
penditures for the current fiscal year
ending June 30, 1910, will exceed
the estimated receipts by $34,075,-
620. If to this deficit he added the
sum to be disbursed for the Panama
Canal, amounting to $38,000,000,
and $1,000,000 to be paid on the pub
lic debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will be in
creased to a total deficit of $73,075,-
620. This deficit the Secretary pro
poses to meet by the proceeds of
bonds issued to pay the cost of con
structing the Panama Canal. I ap
prove this proposal.
The policy of paying for the con
struction of the Panama Canal not
out of current revenue, but by bond
issue, was adopted in the Spooner
act of 1902, and there seems to be
no good reason for departing from
the principle by which a part at
least of the burden of the cost of
the canal shall fall upon our poster
ity, who are to enjoy it, and there
is all the more reason for this view
because the actual cost to date of
the canal, which is now half done
and which will be completed January
1, 1915, shows that the cost of engi
neering and construction will be
$297,766,000 instead of $139,705,-
200, as originally estimated. In ad
dition to engineering and construc
tion, the other expenses, including
sanitation and government and the
amount paid for the properties, the
franchise and the privilege of build
ing the canal, increase the cost by
$75,435,000 to a total of $375,-
201,000.
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments in the prepar
ation of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with
imperative Governmental necessity.
The result has been, as I am advised
by the Secretary of the Treasury,
that the estimates of the expenses of
the Government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1911—that is, for
the next fiscal year—are less by $55,-
663,000 than the total of appropria
tions for the current fiscal year and
less by $94,000,000 than the esti
mates for that year.

his efforts to reduce the cost of per

The President adds;
“I am strongly convinced that no
other practical solution of the diffi
culties presented by the superannua
tion of civil servants can be found
than that of a system of civil pen
sions. ”
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of the Customs revenue at
New York City, in which a number of
the subordinate employes in the
weighing and other departments
were directly concerned and in which
the beneficiaries were the American
Sugar Refining Company and others.
The frauds consisted in the payment
of duty on underweights of sugar.
The Government has recovered from
the American Sugar Refining Com
pany all that it is shown to have
been defrauded of. It would seem
to me that an investigation of the
frauds by Congress at present, pend
ing the probing by the Treasury De
partment and the Department of Jus
tice, as proposed, might be giving
immunity and otherwise prove an
embarrassment in securing conviction
of the guilty parties.
By reason of what is known in the
recent Tariff bill as the “maximum
and minimum” clause, the President
says, “fear has been expressed that
this power conferred and duty im
posed on the executive are likely to
lead to a tariff war. I beg to express
the hope and belief that no such re
sult need he anticipated.”
Continuing this subject, he re
marks;
The new tariff law enables me to
appoint a new tariff hoard to assist
me in connection with the Depart
ment of State in the administration of
the minimum and maximum clause
of the act and also to assist officers
of the Government in the administra
tion of the entire law.
I have therefore appointed a tariff
hoard consisting of three members
and have directed them to perform
all the duties above described. This
work will perhaps take two or three
years.
Nothing, however, halts business
and interferes with the course of
prosperity so much as the threatened
revision of the tariff, and until the
facts are at hand, after careful and
deliberate investigation, upon which
such revision ca.’ properly be under
taken, it seems to me unwise to at
tempt it. -
In the interest of immediate econ
omy and because of the prospect of a
deficit I have required a reduction in
the estimates of the War Department
for the coming fiscal year which
brings the total estimates down to an
amount forty-five millions less than
the corresponding estimates for last
year.
The coast defenses of the United
States proper are generally all that
could be desired.
There is, however, one place where
additional defense is badly needed,
and that is at the mouth of Chesa
peake Bay, where It is proposed to
make an artificial island for a fort
which shall prevent an enemy’s fleet
from entering this most important
strategical base of operations on.the
whole Atlantic and Gulf coasts. I
hope that appropriate legislation will
be adopted to secure the construction
of this defense.
The return of the battleship fleet
from its voyage around the world in
more efficient condition than when
it started was a noteworthy event of
interest alike to our citizens and the
naval authorities of the world.
Owing to the necessity for economy
in expenditures, I have directed the
curtailment of recommendations for
naval appropriations so that they are
thirty-eight millions less than the
corresponding estimates of last year,
and the request for new naval con
struction is llmted to two first-xilass
battleships and one repair vessel.
The generosity of Congress having
provided in the present naval ob
servatory the most magnificent and
expensive astronomical establishment
in the world, the President urges a
provision by law for the appointment
of an eminent astronomer as the offi
cial head of the observatory.
The deplorable delays in the ad
ministration of civil and criminal law
have received the attention of com
mittees of the American Bar associa
tion and of many State bar associa
tions, as well as the considered
thought of judges and jurists. In
my judgment, a change in judicial
procedure, with a view to reducing
its expense to private litigants in civil
cases and facilitating the dispatch of
business and final decision in both
civil and criminal cases, constitutes
the greatest need in our American
constitutions.
I therefore recommend legislation
providing for the appointment by the
President of a commission with au
thority to examine the law and equity
procedure of the Federal courts of
first instance, the law of appeals from
those courts to the courts of appeals
and to the Supreme Court and the
costs imposed in such procedure upon
the private litigants and upon the
public treasury and make recom
mendation with a view to simplifying
and expediting the procedure as far
as possible and making it as inex
pensive as may be to the litigant of
little means.
The President also recommends
that, in compliance with the Repub
lican Party’s platform promise on the
subject of legislating against the
practice of issuing injunctions with
out previous notice, an appropriate
law to that end be adopted.

Among the Workers.
A new bricklayers’ union has been
organized in Aberdeen, S. D.
The official labor paper in Vancou
ver, B. C., is said to be proving a suc
cess iu every way.
A new union, composed of chauf

Since the organization of the Cloak
and Skirt Makers’ Union, No. 56, at

has led to the passage of the so-called
“Sherman Anti-Trust law” and the
“Interstate Commerce law” and its
amendments. The developments in
the operation of those laws, as shown
by indictments, trials, judicial deci
sions and other sources of informa
tion, call for a discussion and some
suggestions as to amendments. These
I prefer to embody in a special mes
sage instead of including them in the
present communication.
After earnestly recommending the
passage of a sufficient appropriation
to enable a thorough remodeling o£
the jail in the District of Columbia,
postal matters are reviewed.
The deficit every year in the Post
office Department is largely caused,
avers the President, by the low rate
of postage of one cent a pound
charged on second class mail matter,
A great saving might be made,
amounting to much more than half
of the loss, by Imposing upon maga
zines and periodicals a higher rate of
postage.
The second subject worthy of men
tion in the Postofflce Department is
the real necessity and entire practica
bility of establishing postal savings
banks. The successful party at the
last election declared in favor of
postal savings banks, and, although
the proposition finds opponents in
many parts of the country, I am con
vinced that the people desire such
banks and am sure that when the
hanks are furnished they will be pro
ductive of the utmost good.
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor, I earnestly rec
ommend to Congress the considera
tion and passage of a ship subsidy bill
looking to the establishment of lines
between out Atlantic seaboard and
the eastern coast of South America
as well as lines from the west coast
of the United States to South Amer
ica. China, Japan and the Philip
pines.
The successful party in the last
election in its national platform de
clared in favor of the admission as
separate States of New Mexico and
Arizona, and I recommend that legis
lation appropriate to this end be
adopted.
With respect to the Territory of
Alaska, I recommend legislation
which shall provide for the appoint
ment by the President of a Governor
and also of an executive council, which
shall have legislative powers sufficient
to enable it to give to the Territory
local laws adapted to Its present
growth.
In several departments there is pre
sented the necessity for legislation
looking to the further conservation of
our national resources, and the sub
ject Is one of such importance as to
require a more detailed and extended
discussion than can be entered upon
in this communication.
Mr. Taft also makes the following
suggestions and recommendations:
•The transfer of control over the
lighthouses to a suitable civilian
bureau.
The passage of a law to enable the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor to
unite the Bureaus of Manufactures
and Statistics.
Additional legislation to help sup
press th© “white slave trade.”
That all the bureaus and offices in
the general Government which have
to do with the public health or sub
jects akin thereto be united in a bu
reau to be called the “bureau of pub
lic health.”
That a law bo passed requiring that
candidates In elections of members of
the House of Representatives file in
a proper office of the United States
Government a statement of the con
tributions received and of the ex
penditures incurred in the campaign.
That Congress appropriate a suf
ficient sum to pay the balance—about
thirty-eight per cent. —of the
’ amounts due depositors In the Freed
-1 man’s Savings and Trust Company.
The year 1913 will make the
fiftieth anniversary of the issuance of
i the emancipation proclamation grant
’ ing freedom to the negroes. It seems
■ fitting that this ©vent should be prop
• erly celebrated. It is suggested that
, a proper form of celebration would
■ be an exposition to show the progress
i the negroes have made.
President Taft concludes as fol
; lows:
I have thus, in a Message com
-1 pressed as much as the subjects will
. permit, referred to many of the legls
• lative needs of the country, with the
; exceptions already noted. Speaking
■ generally, the country Is in a high
state of prosperity. There is every
• reason to believe that we are on the
r eve of a substantial business expan
• sion, and we have just garnered a
• harvest unexampled in the market
- value of our agricultural products.
The high prices which such products
i bring mean great prosperity for the
I farming community; but, on the
; other hand, they mean a very con
-1 siderably increased burden upon
I those classes in the community whose
i yearly compensation does not expand
s with the improvement in business
i and the general prosperity. Various
reasons are given for the high prices,
i The proportionate increase in the
! output of gold, which to-day is the
■ chief medium of exchange and is in
• some respects a measure of value, fur
! nishes a substantial explanation of at
I least part of the increase in prices,
i The increase in population and the
• more expensive mode of living of the
people, which have not been accom
i panied by a proportionate increase in
■ acreage production, may furnish a
; further reason. It is well to note that
the increase in the cost of living is
■ not confined to this country, but pre
! vails the world over, and that those
who would charge increases in prices
i to the existing protective tariff must
■ meet the fact that the rise in prices
i has taken place almost wholly in
; those products of the factory and
• farm in respect to which there has
: been either no increase in the tariff
or in many instances a very consider
able reduction.

Unusual Relationship.
A most unusual combination of
family ties exists between two fam
ilies who were reared in Larue Coun
ty, near Oak Hill Church, about five
miles west of Buffalo. On adjoining
farms lived William Heath and John
Hornbeck, two prosperous farmers,
and the family of each consisted of
only two boys and two girls. These
children were playmates from child
hood and their intimate association
resulted in the verification of the
expression, “Me and my folks love you
and your folks.” The two Heath
brothers married the two Hornbeck
sisters, all of whom settled in that
community, where they reared fami
lies of children who are now happy
in .their rare relationship.—Taylor
