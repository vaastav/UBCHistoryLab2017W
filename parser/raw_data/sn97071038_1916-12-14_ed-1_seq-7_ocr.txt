NEW DANGER SIGNS WILL SERVE 10 REDUCE
ACCIDENTS AT ALL RAILROAD CROSSINGS
In 1915 there were 1086 deaths resulting from acci
dents at railroad crossings In this country. Most of
them were caused by auto-train collisions. The rail
roads over the entire nation are striving to cut down
this enormous death toll each year. With this in view,
many of the roads are installing prominent warning
signs at every crossing. In this respect, the Oregon
Washington Railroad & Navigation Company Is tak
ing a Btrong lead. All their lines are being supplied
with cautionary highway signs.
The accompanying cut shows the type of new signs
which this company Is putting up. A large number of
them have already been placed along the Heppner
branch line.
After several months of Btudy and experiment, the
words, "Railroad Crossing Danger" were adopted. This
notice displayed In bold black letters on a white circular
target should prove a most effective warning to approach
ing vecliiles both by day and night. The local branch
has been fortunate In the small number of accidents, but
the Increasing number of cars and the consequent in
crease in travel over the roads will be added argument
for a thorough application of the "Safety First" move
ment. . '

THE RAILROAD QUESTIOM
President Wilson in his message to
Congress on December 7 of last year,
suggested the wisdom ot "taking a
new assessment" of the railroads and
their relations to the public. As a
result, the Newlands' Committee,
made up from members of both hous
es of Congress, was created.
Alfred P. Thorn, who made the
opening statement to the Newlands'
Joint Committee on Interstate Com
merce at the beginning of its sessions
in prefacing an analysis of the condi
tions that are hampering railroad de
velopment admitted on behalf of the
railroads that the principle of public
regulation is recognized as a per
manent of Government. He said that
public regulation of railroads became
a fact twenty-nine years age and that
Jie fight against the railroads since
hen lias proceeded to a large degree
along the lines of "a system of cor
rection." In comparing the super
vision of banks and railroads, he as
serted that the Government's treat
ment ot the banks was in the nature
of a constructive program; that the
supervision of railroads. was "part of
a destructive program."
For a dozen years "The Railroad
Question" has been constantly before
the American people. The difficulty
has been that as soon as one phase
of the problem began to be under
stood by the part of the people that
might be described as "our thought
ful citizenship," some violent twist
of conditions has completely changed
the entire situation, and "the rail
road question" suddenly presented it
self into a new form. LaFollette and
Cummins fought the old regime that
manipulated the railroads. They
early realized that .constructive leg
islation to properly deal with the
jreat "railroad question" should be
enacted by the federal government:
and both of them became ardent ad
vocates of regulation by the national
government, acknowledging the futi
lity of forty-six or forty-eight states
attempting to govern interstate com
merce. ,
Congress has now assumed control
of the railroad question and promises
to rectify the indiscriminate legisla
tion fostered at the Instance of poli
ticians who have ridden into public'
office through the prejudices they
created against public service cor
porations. There has been a merry
havoc of a time in railroad affairs,
running over the course of a num
ber of years. Reorganization plans,
receiverships and bankruptcy have
menaced the county's great transpor
tation interests.
Congressman Adams, vice chair
man of the Joint Committee of Con
gress, which is charged with Investi
gating the entire railroad problem,
has declared that the "railways must
be protected." Mr. Adamson is
author of the eight-hour law, and this
piece of government policy may fall
within the scope of the investigation.
Senator Cummins, who is also on the
Committee, is expectant of real re
sults at last for the forms he has so
long advocated. Congressman Esch,
early identified with the Wisconsin
movement, is a member of the com
mittee. Senator Newlands, one of
the earliest advocates of Federal in
corporation of railroad companies, Is
chairman. Other members are Sena
tors Underwood, of Alabama; Robin
son of Arkansas; Brandegee, of Con
necticut; and Representatives Sims,
of Tennessee; Sullop, of Indiana; and
Hamilton' of Michigan.
Stripped of "whereases" and "re
solves" the entire situation brings it
self down to the point where the gov
ernment is convinced that the rail
roads have suffered enough from hap
hazard legislation, and the opinion
is general that the railroads at this
time, are as a rule, efficiently and
honestly managed. At any rate, they
represent such an enormous property
value, and are so vital to the indus
trial and social existence of the coun
try, as to demand that the responsi
bility to the public regardless of
capital invested in the properties,
calls for a permanent "show down,'
and a business like adjustment of the
relations between the people's gov
ernment and the railroad Interests.
"Government ownership" is one of
the angles to the problem that will
be taken up.
Government control, of the most
far-reaching kind, is certain to fol
low as a result of the investigation
Rates, securities, and possibly even
the question of wages, and the hours
of a day's labor, are among the mat
ters sought to be regulated. How
ever, there is no disposition to In
terfere with the valuation and taxa
tlon of physical property within the
recognized powers of the states.
The present temper of Administra
tion leaders and Congress, is to dis
countenance a continuance of the ex
isting dual system of State and Fede-
ral railroad control and to remedy
the evil by assuming full authority
on behalf of the Federal Government.
As one of the results of the pre
sent inquiry it is probable that the
Interstate Commerce Commission
will be enlarged and Its power ex-
tended to cover all carrier of in
terstate commerce. It is suggest
ed that districts for the hearing of
cases and the settling of disputes may
be established, somewhat along the
plan of the federal judicial system
where district judges try local causes
of action. If this plan prevails, the
right if appeal to the Interstate Com
merce Commission, as now estab
lished in the National Capital, will
doubtless be provided for. It is also
suggested that regional divisions of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
may be established, as has been done
in the control of the banking system
of the country.
Perhaps, after all, it is true that
the United States is entering upon
a new era in its industrial affairs.
In any event, Congress and the Ad
ministration never undertook a big
ger or more important task than
that of "settling the railroad ques
tion" which is now seems to be at
tacking in earnest.

MUTT RANCH SELLS
FOR 13 THOUSAND
Dan Hanshew of Black Horse spent
Monday in the city transacting busi-
Wes Marlatt sold ins combination
stock and wheat ranch at the head ot
Black Horse Canyon last week to
Roy and Bert Misslldine. The con
sideration was $13,000 cash. The
ranch consists of 673 acres and ow
ing to the fact that the farm land
and pasture is in two separate par
cels, is is considered an excellent
stock and wheat ranch combined.
Mr. Marlatt is a pioneer stockman
of this county and the ranch which
he sold was orgtnally the homestead
of his brother, the late Thos. Mar
latt. The Misslldine boys are sons
of Amos Misslldine of this city and
they have been farming in the Black
Horse section for a number of years
and have met with success. They
have already taken possession of
their new property and Mr. Marlatt
has moved to this city, where he ex
pects to reside.
Much Fruit Still Remains In Valley.
Although some dozen of vacant
business houses and the casements
of stores have been filled with the
overflow from the storage plants of
local shipping agencies, the total ca
pacity of which is around 600,000
boxes, scores of loaded apple wa
gons are continuing daily to bring in
fruit from the valley. Sara. E. Camp
bell, chief inspector for the Associa
tion stated Saturday that he thought
there were at least 200,000 boxes of
apples In inadequate warehouses and
sheds remaining unprotected.
"If the weather remains moderat
for another week," said Mr. Camp
bell, "I think we will be able to get
all of this fruit under cover and will
be well protected against the ele
ments. We are using all means now
to assist those growers whose ap
ples have no protection, in getting
their fruit in."
Shippers whose storage plants are
located on the line of the Mount
Hood Railroad Co., are making ur
gent appeals for cars. While this
fruit Is well protected, in case of
heavy snows such as prevailed last
winter, when the valley road was
tied up for a month, it may be impos
sible to get the fruit to market in
time to take advantage of the best
markets. Hood River Glacier.
