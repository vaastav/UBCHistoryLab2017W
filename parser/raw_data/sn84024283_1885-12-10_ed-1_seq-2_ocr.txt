over the Union Pacific. It is understood
that all-the remaining troops at Fort
Omaha, consisting of ten companies of
infantry and one of cavalry, have been pat
under orders to be ready to move
at a . moment's notice. Inquiry at
Union Pacific headquarters reveals the
fact that the company has received
instructions to have in immediate
readiness additional special trains for the
movement of those troops westward.
General Howard has persistently refused
to answer questions regarding the des
tination of these troops. "My orders are
strictly confidential," said General How
ard to your correspondent, "ana I can
not possibly even intimate where these
troops are going. It is of the utmost
importance that the people of the com-
mnnitv to which they are destined shall
not be apprised of their coming." It is
evident that serious trouble is anticipated
somewhere. General Howard intimated
as much.
The general conclusion is that - the
troops of the department are all to be
rapidly concentrated at Salt Lake, in an.
ticipation of an attack upon the Gentiles
by the Mormons. Trouble of serious
nature has been brewing there for the last
few days. The arrest, conviction and
imprisoment of Mormon leaders for
polygamy have not only aroused the Mor
mons to great indignation ana revengeiui
bitterness, but have caused them to re
taliate by importing prostitutes from San
Francisco and Denver and using these
women to entrap Federal officials and
prominent Gentiles. In this they have
been partly successful, having caused a
few arrests of the officials and Gentiles.
One Deputy United States Mar
shal was arrested for fornication
with one of these women, , under
the city charter. He was taken
by a writ of habeas corpus by the United
States authorities, who declared the city
ordinance invalid, because it exceeded
the authority granted by the Legislature.
The other night another Deputy Marshal
was assaulted by what he called four
Mormon assassins, one of whom he dan
gerously shot. The Mormons and their
papers denounce this shooting as the act
of an assassin,who made the first assault,
and the Mormon press is calling for blood
atonement. These are the causes that
make Salt Lake a volcano to-day, liable
to break forth at any moment. Threats
have been made that the entire Gentile
population will be cleaned out and excite
ment and fears are increasing from day to
day.
A dispatch received in Omaha from
Salt Lake, in response to a telegram of
Inquiry, says: "The inflamed condition
of the public mind here is causing most
serious apprehensions, and the move
ment of the military is designed to pre
vent the possibility of an outbreak and
secure in advance the preservation of life
and property. Troops cannot, be concen
trated here any too quick to "allay the
alarm and excitement."
Owing to General Howard's reticence
regarding the destination of troops there
is considerable speculation as to where
they are really going, but the great ma
jority believe Salt Lake is the place with
out doubt. Their destination is alleged
by the officer to be Fort Fred Steele, in
Wyoming, on the Union Pacific. Others
intimate that it is Fort Lewis, in South
ern Colorado, where there have been some
disturbances among the Indians, and also
among Apaches some distance from that
post. General Sheridan it is stated, de
sired to concentrate a large number oi
troops at that point to handle any serious
outbreak which might take place in the
Southwestern country.
Another guess is that troops are needed
for labor troubles at Rawlins, Rock
Springs and Evanston on the Union Pa-'
ciflc, but railroad officials deny anything
of the kind. . It is also hinted that the
troops are to go to the Pacific coast on
account of Chinese troubles. So far as
Indian troubles are concerned it is not at
all likely that artillery would be forward
ed. The sending out of the artillery con
firms the general belief that Salt Lake is
the destination or place of concentration.
The troops at Fort Robinson, Neb., have
been ordered to move to the West, and
orders of similar character have been is
sued to other posts in this department.
Later. It is a sure thing now that the
troops from this department are going to
Salt Lake, and it is understood from
eood authority that trouble is looked for
here.
Vnnnal Report of United States Treagurei
Jordan.
Washington, D. C, December 7.
The annual report of Mr. C.'N. Jordan,
Treasurer of the United States, shows
that during the last fiscal year, there was
an increase of $33,4G3,833 in gold assets;
of $22,059,016 in the silver assets; $6,776,
423 in the legal tender assets; $171,234 in
National bank assets and $147,157 in
National bank deposits. Called bonds of
the United States amounting to $45,968,
600 were redeemed, of which amount
$45,388,150 was for the sinking fund.
The Treasurer says that he should
have authoiity to make frequent
examinations of sub-Treasuries and
mints to enable him to know that the
funds with which he is charged are held
as represented, and to hold the officers to
a more strict accountability than has
heretofore prevailed. He recommends
an appropriation sufficient to cover the
expense of such examinations, ne aiso
favors a scheme for the reorganization of
the sob-Treasury of the United States, the
officers of which have had their duties
and responsibilities largely increased

departments. The estimates for the next
fiscal year call for $816,390. .The amount
of work, he says, which it is proposed to

London, December 8. The , report
coming by way of Belgrade yesterday af
ternoon that Bulgaria has renewed hos
tilities proves to , have t been, like - so
many statements emanating from Servian
sources, a complete misrepresentation Of
Prince Alexander's attitude. The armis
tice has been observed with good faith.
Late dispatches show that 'negotiations
for a settlement by Servia and Bulgaria
without the intervention i of the
larger States are ' proceeding " satis
factorily, and that - the outlook for a
peaceful solution of the difficulty is more
favorable than at anytime since the out
break of the war. The Servian proposals
handed to Prince Alexander by special
envoy, are that upon the withdrawal of
the Bulgarian army f torn : Servian terri
tory, the Servian troops operating in the;
direction of Widin shall retire. The de
cision as to indemnity or the acquisition
of territory on either side Is then
to be left nndereservedly with
the conference of the powers. 'The
. Porte has forwarded two important mes
sages to Prince Alexander. One warns
him that the armistice must be continued
until the powers decide otherwise, and
that he has no power to conclude final'
terms of peace Irrespective of the pow
ers, though he may arrange with King
Milan , the basis of a complete ces
sation of hostilities. The other prom
ises to carefully consider Bulgaria's re
quest to refrain from sending the Govern
mental Commission into Ronmelia, and to
withdraw the commission already sent to
Philippopolis. The popular animosity in
Roumclla against these Turkish agents
increases every day and threatens to re
sult in another revolt against an attempt
to restore the Ottoman yoke. Mass
meetings are held daily, at which popular
orators exhort the people not to let their
liberty, so nearly realized, be snatched
from their grasp by the wily Turk. ... : .

SHOCKING ACCIDENT.
Four Men Instantly Killed and One Fatall
Injured By a Falling- Ream in the Croton
Aqueduct Shaft A Sickening- Slg-ht Pre

of Eight Men Killed Within Two Weeks.
Mkrritt's Corner's Westchester
County, N. Y., December 7 Another
accident is added to the long list that' has
already occurred at the works of the new
Croton Aqueduct It occurred early this
morning at Shaft No. 3, and resulted in
the death of four men and probable fatal
injury of the fifth. " The men were de
scending to work in one of the backet ;
used for lowering them into the shaft;
The start was made all right, but before
the bucket had descended many feet a
cross beam or "Billy," as it is called by
miners, used to steady the bucket, caught
in the shaft, and remained fast until the
bucket had almost reached the bottom Of
the shaft, when it shook loose and dame j
crashing down a distance of overs one
hundred feet on the heads of the unfor
tunate man. The following were in
stantly killed : V .: -:, -i i ;

John Boardman, the other unfortunate
man, will probably die of his injuries.
When the cross-beam struck the buck
et he was knocked out, but in his descent
fell on a shelving constructed near the
bottom and on the side of the shaft.
This, in all probability, saved him from
instant death. When found he was tin a
semi-comatose state, but soon revived
enough to be able to speak. The extent
of his injuries has not as yet been ascer
ained. ." ','7.V 'T ""',""; ; -
The dead men presented a shocking
sight. Three of them have their heads
crushed out of all semblance tp human
beings and but for their clothing their
recognition would be wholly impossible.'
They are Dobbins, Dresser and Moran.
Of the four, however, Francis ; Carrs'
death, was the most horrible When
struck by the falling beam, he was
knocked from the car and fell headlong to
the bottom of the shaft repeatedly strik
ing the sides in his descent. His body
was mutilated beyond description, having
been cut into little pieces. : . , . -, ' :
News of the accident spread rapidly
throughout the little village, and created
the utmost consternation. Hundreds of
villagers gathered around the shaft and
viewed the ghastly spectacle of the 'four
mangled bodies, which were placed ; side
by side as the remains were collected by
horror-stricken comrades of the unfortu
nate men. The Coroner has been notified .
and will hold an inquest at once. . . .
This makes a total of eight men j who'
have been killed at the works here within
the past two weeks. . ;
