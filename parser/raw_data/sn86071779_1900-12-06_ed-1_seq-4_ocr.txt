THURSDAY, DEC. 6, 1000.
MR. EAST PERFORMS AGAIN.
On Tuesday evening Mr, J. Frank
East, President of Common Councils,
rend before tlutt body a must, venomous
attack upon the Virginian-Pilot, Its
management and members of its staff,
because of criticisms this newspaper,
as a public journal, lias made of Mr,
least's vote as a public official. At Hip
same time. Mr. East sent t-> tho man?
aging editor of the Vlrginlan-Pllot a
letter, which is given In the Forum, to
be found on another page Of this issue.
Although addressed .simply to Mr. A,
II. Grandy, ihe context of tho letter
shows very plainly Hint It was written
to him as the managing editor of the
Vlrginlan-Pllot, and, therefore; we pub?
lish it In our Forum column.
Observe the gelid assurance of Mr.
.1. Prank East! Ho gets up in councils
and amiably remarks, from volumi?
nous manuscript, that the Virginian
Pilot and its stuff are base catiffs, who
are trying to injure his pure und lovely
character by disseminating falsehoods;
and then dispatches a letter to the
paper's managing editor running
thusly: "I will hold you personally re?
sponsible for anything appearing in the
columns of the Vlrginlan-Pllot which
reflects upon me In any respect what?
ever." Decidedly, Mr. 3. Frank East,
on a rampage, is a foe to gloom and a
dispenser of melancholy.
Now, as to Mr. Fast, personally, the
Vlrginlan-Pllot is not at all InteresteiI
or concerned. If it cared to go Info
personalities Mr. East would be n par?
ticularly easy mark; but it is only con?
cerned with Mr. Enst us a councilman
of the city, and hot as a former police
justice; Mr. Bast's action, as a public
servant, it will criticise at any lime ii
thinks the public interests demand It.
Wc shall certainly not ask for Mr.
East's permission or wait for It.
At Mr. East's abuse, the Virginian
Pilot is not at all worried. It '
relieved Mr. East and did the Virgin
Ian-Pilot rip sort of harm. Hut as a
public official; and in ills capacity i
such, Mr. East has seen lit to raise
question of fact with the Virginian
Pilot. He said thart ho did not give to
the City Editor of the Virginian-Pilot,
in the Virglnian-pilpt's business office,
on October 9th nh Interview which ap?
peared in these columns, and to tie
nuthenclty of which the City Editor
has made affidavit. That afudavll Mr.
East'says "bore falsehood on Its face."
lie declared that ho did pot even sco
the City Editor of the Virginian-Pilot
nt that time. Elsewhere the Vlrgln
fnn-Pilot gives aflidavjts from two
others, who were in the office ail Ihe
time Mr. East gavp the interview, sub
Blnntlatlng the affidavit of its pity Ed?
itor,
How does the ease stand 'then? Mr
East SAYS before the Common Coup
ell that he did not go into the Virgin
Ian-Pilot office, ami while there givi
an Interview to its city Editor, oh Oc
?tobcr 9th. The City Editor of the Vir
glnlan-Pilot and two other members
of its staff, who were in the office a;
the time, moire affidavit that Air. Basil
did come into tho office ami give the
Interview in question. LET IT HE
NOTED THAT Ml:. EAST HAS
NEVER, AT ANY TIME, MADE AF?
FIDAVIT THAT THE INTERVIEW
IN QUESTION "WAS NOT AUTHEN?
TIC. "WHY. Mit. EAST. DID YOU
NOT MAKE AFFIDAVIT AS To
FACTS. INSTEAD OF LAUNCHING
INTO MERE PUERILE ABUSE? Mr.
East, In going before the Common
.Council of this city and dellbcuuCciy
reading typewritten assertions. Is the
victim of the most remarkable lapse of
memory on record.
TWO TIMELY UTTERANCES.
Tho Blackstone Courier and the
Fanm illo Herald each has a timely ut?
terance upon a most Important matter
?the necessity for good roads In Vir?
ginia. The Courier, remarking that tho
Han. Iilse question Is not tho only one
of importance to come before the con?
stitutional convention, says:
''Another matter which should receive
attention, and which would go a long
ways inward the reduction of criminal
expunges, would he i<> make some pro?
vision whereby criminals sentenced to
terms in the county jails would, ln
atei i. bo reit it I red to work out that
term upon the public roads. This would
bo both a sitvinn to the State and a
saving to tho counties. The State
would hot have to pay for their keep?
ing ami the counties would save in the
emplnyn enl Of labor t<> work the roads.
It would also, to some extent, relieve
Lhe t r< nr. in the penitentiary. Many
?>f the ..lie-year men In the penitentiary
would then receive sentences on the
public leads."
The ll. raid thinks the construction of
proper highways is both a State and
Federal problem, and is inclined to a
system of government post roads. It
says:
"The army of lOO.OOO men now em?
ployed to shool civilization Into brown
brother ni6n ought to be armed with
spade and pick to make smooth our
abominably rough highways. Where
over the government sends a mall boy
it ought to nsslst In furnishing a de?
cent rand Why. Wherever a State has
founded a capital city Ii ought to aid
in making the roads leading to it pas?
sable, winter and summer.
"The county .with market town:-,
ought to contribute to the comfort of
man and beast as they go along the
roads leading Into them.
"The roads from home to churches,
to mills, to iKtstoffices and to other
homes should be the pride of all lhe
neighbors who use them."
Next to good schools, good roads are
the greatest civilizers. They are to*the
agricultural population what railroads
are to the eitle?--. The benefits that fol?
low the construction, of good roads^
while slower to appear, are not less
great, and are much more evenly dis?
tributed than the benefits that follow
from the const ruction of railroads.
There Is much, therefore. In what
each of our contemporaries say^s. lt
Would be Infinitely hotter from every
polnl of view for the government to
put 100.000 men to building post roads
than to put them to shooting Filipinos.
Hut the government Is not going to do
it, because rond-bulldlng is less spec?
tacular than war. nnd the men who are
anxious to cut a figure in the Philip?
pines would not care to he road over?
seers. There Is no reason, however,
why the Slate should not give more at?
tention lo road-bullding, and the sug- ;
gestlon of the Courier is eminently
practical. Indeed, the problems that j
the constitutional convention should
consider are. In the order of their Im- I
portance, about as follows: -
To Induce tho development of the
Slate's resources by Immigration and
Invest ment.
To provide a more efTictent public
school system.
To lay the foundation for systematic
rond-bulldlng, leaving details to the
General Assembly.
The lopping off of useless offices In
Stale and county government.
A sensible and conservative limita?
tion of the suffrage.
The Virginian-Pilot Is aware that the
last will he first when tho convention
meets, but that will not make It most
important.
If the weekly press of tho Slato would
take up this matter of good roads?and
it Is one lu which the clientele of the
weekly press is vitally interested--it
might, by insistence, have ?lue, consid?
eration given it by the constitutional
Convention nnd the General Assembly,
particularly in the matter of the em?
ployment of able-bodied convlots in
rond-bulldlng,
FACTS AND FAULT FINDING.
Referring to a lengthy Interview of
K\-Secretary of tin- Navy Hilary A.
Herber! in the Montgomery Advertiser,
'.he Richmond Times says:
"II--, therefore, calls upon all who
have the true Interest of Democracy
at heart to put aside 'their prejudices
and their past differences and heartily
unite in bringing the party back into
the wny front which It has so sadly
dopnrtcd. We hfedrtily concur In thni
? ntlment, and we say that there ought
noi l>e any bickering or contention
as to leadership. Let us llrst return lo
our principles, purge the party of Pop
iilh: and then it will be a simple
matter to find leaders."
The country has heard a groat deal
in lhe past month about "our princi?
ples" and getting back to them. To
consummation of this latter there
are two things absolutely necessary:
1. 'I'., know wln't those principles are.
2. To know how to pet back to them.
It Mem.: to us singular indeed that,
in all the discussion of reorganization.
&C, since lhe election, nobdy, so far as
wc have soon, has either staled the
principles to which Democrats are to
i fluni or outlined any feasible way to
n to thorn, la :'ll seriousness, will
the Times state what those principles
are an ! l ow Hie Democratic party Is
i'1 return to them at this time? v
There has likewise been a Hood of
criticism of ihe Kansas City platform,
before an.] after the election. Demo.
on have been told over nnd over
agnin thai the platform was all a mis?
take; that -elress was laid on tho
wrong issues; thai with the right is?
sues the Democratic party could have
wop. wc do !-,.-t i?is mat anybody
has said what Issues should have
been in order to Insure victory.
Will the Times, or any other, name
the issues -taking lhe situation as It
existed at the time-of the Kansas City
convention?upon which the Demo
Oratio parly should have gone before
the country? Suppose that at Kansas
City the party, In the language of the
Times, had elected to return to "the
way from which It has so sadly de?
parted." discarding Mr. Brynn and the
Chicago platform, what ought to have
been the Issues of Its platform?
This Is no idle query. Men and par?
ties learn by experience, it is just as
necessary, in order to profit by a mis- j
take, to know what should have been i
done as what should have been avoid?
ed, Democrats have heard a great
deal about what they ought not to
have done at Kansas City: they have
been told that Mr. Bryan should not !
have been nominated; that 1G to 1
should have been left out of the plat?
form: that Imperialism should, not have
been made the paramount issue: that
the plank against trusts was all wrong.
If these be the things Democrats ought
not to have done, what are the things
they ought to have done:'
The Virginian-Pilot does not nee how,
in decency, anybody who has nothing
better to offer can criticise Democratic
principles and Issues OS embodied In
tho Kansas City platform. Nothing Is
easier and nothing more futile than
more growling. Nothing can come of
it save irritation within the party.
What is wanted to insure harmony
among all Democrats is not mere fnull
finding on the part or one faction or
the other, but a dispassionate demon?
stration of error, if error there has
been, and a clear statement of grounds
upon which unity of action and pur?
pose will be possible.
MORE BARK. THAN BITE.
Prance might perhaps be able to
overmatch England's channel squad?
ron and effect a landing Oil the Eng?
lish coast. There is a wide difference
of opinion on that point, ami nothing
but tIn" actual tug of war could decide
It: just as the experts were shown to
he all at Bea by the battles of Manila
bay and Santiago, so they would prob?
ably Und themselves wide of the murk
In their conclusions as to the relative
strength of the English ami French
navies, If the test should be made.
Cue point upon which there does not
seem to b? much doubt is that there Is
more bark than bite in He- current
ant 1-English outbreaks in France. It
is difficult to Imagine anything more
ridiculous than the hubbub raised over
the vaporing.-- of the degenerate Mer?
rier In the Senate, lie is the same
Srcrclcr \vho wus so disgracefully mixed
tip in the Dreyfus affair, it will he re?
membered, lie rises solemnly in the
upper chamber, with representatives of
the press of tho world present, und
proceeds to tell how easily he can
smash England, and t<> even outline
his plans, until all the members trem?
ble In their seats at the terrible spec?
tacle; finally with great difficulty the
president of the Senate Induces Gene?
ral Mercler to desis't and let prostrate
Albion rise, and so order is restored.
Nothing could be more superlatively
nonsensical than all ibis gasconade.
1? France were to take up the quarrel
of the Boers She would have the sym?
pathy of a majority of civilized man?
kind, but the drivel of ler Mercters
only serves to bring her into derision
and contempt. The world despises a
blow-bard, and that is about the pass
to which I.a Helle France seems to
have come. As cordially as England Is
disliked by every nation In Europe, Hie
perpetual nagging of the Frenchman
\vou|d bring the laugh upon him if he
should get his ears soundly boxed for
his pains. Frenchmen should remem?
ber that ol" all men they can bast
afford to brag and bluster; the world
still remembers how much of that, sort
of thing was done before Sedan.
France should either tight or shut up.
When it becomes possible to force
' through Congress n measure so palpa?
bly iniquitous as the ship subsidy bill
il is difficult to take a very optimistic
j view of tin- morality of our national
legislators. We seem to have reached
a stage in our national development
when any sort of job can be put upon
the country by the simple expedient of
buying the good will of the Republican
party by contributing to its campaign
fund.

THE PRESS AND THE MESSAGE.
A CONDENSED HISTORY.
(Washington Post, Intl.)
President McKinley"? fourth annual
message meets the assumed desire of
congress and the people for a con?
densed history of tho operations of the
government during the past year, as
well as for appropriate reflections on
existing conditions and suggestions as
to the future. Our republic is so young
that only one of President McKinleys
predecessors bus addressed congress at
the close of a century, and that was In
the early infancy of the "more perfect
union." it Was natural, therefore,
that this message should begin With
a brief luti comprehensive summary of
the growth of the republic during the
century in population, in the number
of states, and In area.
IN A Gl ?OD HUMOR.
? (Richmond Dispatch, Dem.)
The President's message to congress
is a long one. We Und In it no hing
very stunning; nor. indeed, any thin:;
very striking. He may be pardoned for j
its length because he had a great mini
bcr of subjects with which to deal. He
writes In a calm and self-satisfied
style. Having just been elected for a
second term, and seeing his parly in
power in every branch of the federal
government, he seems to be In a good
humor.
THE EXPECTED.
(Now York World. Ind.)
Altogether the message is commend
ably frank and is precisely what the
country had a right to expect, and ho
doubt did expect, as lhe consequence of
President McKinlcy's re-election and
of his interpretation of that result as
an Indorsement of his policy in all its
length and breadth;
NOT DECISIVE.
(Chicago Record, lud.)
On the whole the message will com?
mand warm approval for- Its expres?
sions as to ?'liiua. As to some of the
other vital issues of the hour Its lack
of grasp and decisiveness Is disappoint?
ing.
BENEVOLENT STILL.
(Baltimore .News, Rep.)
That Mr. McKinlcy's purposes to- I
ward the Filipinos, as conveyed by his
message, are of the utmost benevolence
need*liardly be mentioned. More than
thai, tt should be granted by the most
ardent ahil-imporlalist that his real
desires In reference to them are as
kindly as the sentiments he professes.
PROLIX AND TEDIOUS.
(Louisville Courier-Journal. Dem.)
Presidential messages to congress
are usually dull reading, and Presi?
dent McKinlcy's fourth annual produc?
tion Is unusually dull, even for a Presi?
dential message. it is prolix and
tedious, it touches upon almost every
topic conceivable, and most of them,
if introduced at ail. could advantage?
ously have been treated In half the
words, it would i"> a refreshing revo?
lution if we i otil.I one- ;ret a Presi?
dent who knew how to write like a
good newspaper man. Instead of labor?
iously cultivating lhe tiresome and
solemn verbosity of the "statesman." i
Ti m LONG.
(Chattanooga Times. Rep.)
It Ii? too long to justify discussion of
it as n whole in the Issues of a week, j
and besides, the mass of Us facts have i
been anticipated by the press and most
of the President's recommendations
have been discounti.il.
HOW Tu GET P.irir.
(Omaha World-Herald.)
It Is easy to get rich, if you know
how. And the World-1 bra Id is willing
to give the needed information. Buy \
esgs. There's nothing like it. Last
summer eggs were selling at eight
cents n dozen in Omaha. To-day they
are si lling at twenty-thrt e cents a
dozen and the pipe promise", to go slill ?
higher. Every summer .-i;;s are down ,
to eight or nine cents, and every winter ]
they go to nineteen or twenty cents.
It fellows, therefore, that if you buy
enough eggs in the summer and hold
the in over until you can net a good
nrlco in winter, your fortune Is made.
There is a packing firm in South Oma?
ha that bought r...,000 dozen eggs last
summer nl eight and nine cents a
dozen. The rcu.s are now being sold at
twenty-two and twenty-three cents a
dozen. When bought tiny were put
into cold storage and after being held
for three or four months hnd their way
to the market as "strictly fresh" eggs
just from the country, .lust think Of
the protlt on 60,000.000 dozen eggs at
elghl cents and sold at twenty-three
cents! Talk about lhe difficulty of get?
ting rich! It's as easy as falling off a
log.
CiOOD ADVICE.
IN. Y. Sun. Pep.)
Finally, and by way of gtfneral ex?
hortation rather than of formal re?
commendation, a reminder to Congress
of the peculiar dangers of the present
session resulting from abundant pros?
perity, a fun irerjsury and a Republi?
can majority with no check, save its
own self-control, upon its natural dis?
position to go ahead at high pressure
and full speed. I :,? cautious, says Mr.
McKinley to house and senate; be not
extravagant.
Wiser op more timely advice was
never offered by any President to any
congress. It is a good message.
BOILING DOWN NEEDED.
(1ST. Y. Journal, Dern.)
The annual message of a President
of the United Stales is a thing of abso?
lutely Unique importance. A foreign
"Speech from the throne" is simply a
successful attempt to:"say nothing in
the fewest possible words. A Presi?
dent's message is an exhaustive trea?
tise upon the recent history and the
futuii- policy of the greatest country
In the world.
lt is a pity that President McKinley
COUld not have taken a few lessons In
the art of "boiling down." The writing
habit lias been growing upon him until
his latest message has reached such a
portentous length that a few win read
It except those whore business i; i.- to
keep inform ?! on such matters. This
Is*unfortunate, for there are many
things In tic document worth alien ion.
especially from the million or so of
comfortable people who can share .Mr.
MoKinley's amiable satisfaction with
things as they are.
NICE AND LONG.
(Washington Times, Dem.)
Like Mr. McKinlcy's previous contri?
butions to the IiP.-rutore of his country,
his annual message to ? congress, read
In tlie senate and house yesterday, is
very nice and very long.
NOT ABSORBING.
(Savannah News, Dom.)
The message gives a comprehensive
idea of the foreign and domestic af?
fairs of the government, but It is not
such a deeply Interesting document
that it will be generally read.
