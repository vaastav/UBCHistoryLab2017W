> WHAT ANGERED CONGRESS.
I>a?t year ail amendment was In|
corporated itr the measure provid,
ing fot the secret service, which
(provided that there should he no J
detail from the secret service anil
J no transfer therefrom.
It is not too much to say that
this amendment has been of benefit
only, and rould he of benefit
only, to the criminal classes.
If deliberately introduced for the
purpose of diminishing the effectiveness
of war against crime it could
not have been hotter devised to this
end
It forbade the practices that had
been followed to a greater or less
extent by the executive heads of
the various departments for twen- J
tv \*-ars. To these practices we j|
i n*c the securing of the evidence
| w r i i?*li enabled us to drive the
i sr*at lotteries out of existence ami
j secure a quarter of a million dollar.-'in
titles front their promoters.
These practices have enabled us to
j discover some of the most out- '
| rageous frauds in connection with i
theft of government land and government
timber by great corpora- j j
tions and l>v ndividtials. These
practices have enabled us to get
some of the evidence indispensable <
in order to secure the conviction of
the wealthiest and most formidable
criminals with whom the govorn!
ment has to deal, both those opI
crating in violation of the anti-trust '
' law and others. |
The amendment in question was
of benefit to no one excepting to
these criminals, and it seriously*
hampers the government in the de|
teetion of < rinte and the securing | i(
j of justice. Moreover, it not only ( ! (
I affects the departments outside of j i"
l the Treasury, but it tends- to ,
hamper the Secretary of the Treasury
himself in the effort to utilize j "
t he employes of his department so
as to best inert lite requirements
of the public service.
It forbids hint from preventing
frauds upon the customs service,
from investigating irregularities '
in branch mints and a.-say offices i
and has seriously '-rippled him. It
prevents the promotion of employes j ?
in the secret service, and this fur- | i
titer discourages good effort. <
In its present form the restriction I
operates only to the advantage of j
the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The ,
chief aigtiment in favor of the pro- t
vision was that the congressmen i
did not themselves wish to be investigated
by secret service men. ]
Very little of such investigation has ;
been done in the past; but it is
true that the work of the secret I
service agents was partly responsible
for the indictment and convh-- i
tion of a senator and a congress- <
man for land frauds iti Oregon. j
i do not believe that it is in the
i public interest to protect criminals
! in any branch of the public service.
and exactly as we have again and j ,
-----
agajn during 11 ?#? past seven years j ,
prowiiK'd .m<l convicted such
< rimlnals lvim were ;n tlie executive
branch of tin* government, so in my
j belief w? should lie given ample
means to prosecute tlieni if found '
in the legislative hraneh.
Knt if 'his is not considered do- '
I sir able a special exception could he j
made in the law prohibiting the use j
Of the secret service force in invesiisatinc
members of the Congress. ;
pi would he far better to do this '
than to do what actually was done,
and strive to prevent or at least '
to hamper effective a'-tion against 1
criminal* by the executive branch
of the government.? FROM THE

body should not be punctiliously Insist- '
ed upon, but should be properly guarded. '
Statements made by the President of the
l nited States cannot be lightly disregarded.
It might be interpreted by the
people to lessen the dignity and impair
the usefulness of the Congress ot" the
United States. |
"I think It may be justly said that the
expressions of the President were?

Mr. Perkins paui?:d for a moment and I
' glanced around the House. There wasn't
a sound. Every face was turned toward
him and was grave and interested and
expectant.
"Were unfortunate." Mr. Perkins resumed,
and the sigh of relief of?of what
not?that followed his expression seemed l
toprove that the spectators in the gal- '
leries and the newspaper men looking
?>n already felt?the dramatic intensity of
the moment. ^
Discretion Is Advised.
"Whether it is sufficient to say this or
whether some more formal action is necessary.
it is for the Congress, exercising
wide and discreet action, to determine.
"We are chosen representatives of
ninety millions of people: the legislative
body of the government. I am sure
there is no man who has the honor
of being a member of tbis Congress that
would not do what might be required by
a proper regard for the dignity of the
body to which lie belongs ami the dignity
of the people whose representatives we
are.
'This resolution provides for the appointment
of a committee which shall
leport to the House. On the coming in
of the report there will be full opportunity
for discussion. 1 should be gratified
if the resolution is adopted without
debate or dissent."
Then Mr. IVrkins took his seat. The
Sneaker put the question on the adoption
of the resolution. The chorus of yeas
was unanimous?not loud or strenuous, or
ribald or personal?but just full-throated
and unanimous1. <
And the Speaker announced the membership
of the committee.
Mr. Perkins has called a meeting of the
committee for tomorrow atteruoon. lie
said that lie expects to be able to bring
in a report before the holiday recess of
Congress.
Senate Is Ready to Follow
Example Set by the House
The news that the House had passed
the resolution today authorizing the appointment
of a committee to investigate
and report upon the disparaging observations
of prerident Roosevelt concerning
the action of Congress in limiting the uses
of the government secret service was
received with great Interest at the Senate
end of the Capitol.
While there was no session of the Senate
today, a number of senators were at
the Capitol. There were many informal
conferences on the subject of what the
Senate will do nevt week.
A prominent senator said this afternoon.
"The Senate has been waiting until the
House acted upon this unfortunate matter.
believing that since the legislation referred
to by the President originated in
the House, that body should first take
cognizance of the President's statements.
'Willie 1 do not believe there is at this
time an absolutely detinlte plan of action
in the minds of the republican senators. I.
nevertheless, feel certain that the Senate
will by no means throw cold water on
what the House has done today.
J'The President has made a great mistnlf

Expected to Act Monday.
The Senate will convene again Monday.
11 seems assured that upon that day a
resolution will be passed similar to that
passed by the House, calling for the appointment
of a committee to look Into the
matter and report a few days later.
It developed today that some of the
President's strong supporters in the Senate.
such as Senator Lodge, the President's
mouthpiece, are planning to raise
a big disturbance when the matter is)
brought up. In other words, it looks as 1f
the Senate, if it passes the resolution in,
question, will not do so quite as easily as
did the House.
As far as the democratic senators are
concerned they are not disposed to object
in any way to censuring the President
either by expunging from the record
the objectionable portion of his message
or by any other method that may
be suggested by the republicans.
On the C?ther hand the democratic resolution
on the subject lias already been
drawn up and may be presented as a substitute
to'm that prepared by the repub
lieans. There won't bo any scrap
