Chinese Girls and Matrimony.

com mil suicide through disappointment at
not getting married; but It w ill surprise them
to learn that tha Chinese young ladles have
such a dread of the matrimonial chain that
tbey frequently prefer death to marriage.

the moat difficult to manage. If you are fa

If you keep them at a distance tliev become

going into Buddhist or Tauiat nunneries, or
even committing suicide, to trusting their
future to men ef whom tliey can know notn

event of tbe opening of congress always has
a packed am lienor, and yesterday was no ex
oeptiou to the rule. Long before the doors
of the galleries were opeu the corridors of
tbe capital building in tbe vicinity of the
chamber of the representatives were Jammed
so full of people that movement In any direc
tion was iinpoasihle. The Democrats were
holding a caucus in tlie chamher, and the
doors were close.! for some time, but when
they were oiwued a few minutes before 12
noun it did not take a moment for the crowd
outside to rush in and occupy every
available foot of sace, aome of
the sight-sfsTs even appropriating
members' aenta. The gall.srios, except this
devoted to tlie use of the executive and tha
diplomats, ware erowdisi with cpjal prompt
ness, and the view from tbe front of the
rpeaker'a stand was that of a sea of faces,
the sombre apparel of tbe men lighted up in
many pln.-eM hy the m.e-e notK-eable cos
tumea of women. In the meantime tbe
members were scattered about the
Boor chatting, welcoming friends, and
making new acquaintance among their nu
merous brother tut-uuen who wore tbe leg
islative mantle for the first time, or again
after a period of retirement.
The Business of Organisation.
After all. It was the same old svue. There
were no episndm worthy of ess-ial note,
rtefore the sound of tbe gavel called tlie house
to order the executive and diplomatic galler
ies were full, but tbe former contained no
men. her of t be prmii lent s household. As tbe
clock marked the hour of 12, Clerk Clark, of
tbe house, stepped to dek, and the shurp rap
of the gavel informed tbe chatting members
and the buiuing audience that tune was up
for that sort of thing and at hand for the or

Whitt borne ot Tennewee. Long before tbe
roll was completed the buzz of conversation
was resumed and the uoiy ones were re
peatedly reminded of their breach of court
esy by the full of the gavel. The clerk then
announced that election of officer was in
order and in a moment Henderson of Illinois
was on bis feet nominating Reed, of Maine,
for speaker. The nomination was received
with applause on the P.epublican ni.le, dur

Tellers were duly appointed, and as the
names of tbe members were called tbey an

''Reed," or "Carlisle," as the case might be.
Some amusement was afforded by tbe man
ner in w Inch some of the members expressed
their preferencea. ne member on the Re
publican side shouted Reed:"' with tbe full
force of bis lungs, w hile one of Mr. Car

that showed that the member was for tbe ex
speaker first, last and all tbe ti me. Tlie call
Is-iug completed the teller announced that
tbe vote stood: Reed, lisj; Carlisle, 1M;
Cumming. (of New York), 1 Cow lew, of
North Carolina. The announcement of the
election of Reed was received with more ap
plause, and Carlisle and McKinlev were ap
pointed to escort tbe new sjesaker to hi post,
where the oath of offliss was administered by
telley ot I'eiui-ylvatua, the 'father of the
house.'
Speaker Read's Remark.
Reed's address upon assuming tbe chair
was brief. He said :
"Gentlemk-v or thx Hocsi of Rkprs

they may be r formed with a projssr annul

"To tbe end that I may be successful in
carrying out your wishee, I invoke the con

A resolution was agreed to providing that

There was a small audiuuee in the senate

conferences and a number of ladies occupied
seats in tbe diplomatic gallery. Mir Julian

they were ready to meet tbe seusational
evidence presented by the two knives found

August Lowetisteln, a tailor. He swore
that on April 37th last Dan Coughlin bought
a pair of trousers from him, which
had to be lengthened ; that Coughlin waited

trousers recorded in his book, but Coughltn't
name was not in the entry. However, hs
knew it was Coughlin who tsjugbt tha
trousers that day.

ner on tbe detective forcsx He said the
knives were similar to two Coughlin carried,
and positively identified one of them by ths
shape of tbe polut of one blade, which was
blunted by a habit Coughlin bad ot rubbing
It on the aaudstoue In any wall be might be
standing near. Jacob said he was as sure ft
wat Cougbliu's knife as be was that one ha

AN OHIO MAN'S KICK

EE DECLARES IT A GREAT FAROE.
With a Parked Caat of rerformers and
Cut-and-Drfed Programme The Ohio
Idea Ruthlessly and Cnishlngly Sat
I'pon by a Combine Which Was En
amored of Silver The Uuvkeye Plan
of (settling the Question.
Columbus. Ohio, Dec 3. Hon. W. H.
West, of Bellefontaine, who headed Ohio't
delegation to tbe National silver convention
at St Louis, yesterday submitted his report
of that event to Governor Koi akar. The re
port characterizes the conveution as a farce
so far as beiug conducive to any general
beuellt, and states that, tbe entire affair was
manipulated as a machine in the interest of a
ring or combination.
Much Try and Little Wool.
Referring to the composition of the con
vention Judge West says: "Kqtially unin
formed with yourself in regard to the move
ment, and iniiixviitly supiiosiug the conven
tion to have been called for the interchange
of view s ou a quest ion of national' interest, I,
with much relcutauce, and at some personal
inconvenience, accepted under a sense of
courtesy, and accordingly reached St. Louis
on the morning of the '.Jtiih, where I expected
to meet witb'the 8,tu) delegates, the atten
dance of which the daily aiersof the pre
ceding day ostentatiously heralded. Instead,
in the great Exposition ball, ample to accom
moiiate 4,lW or 5,000, uot excelling l.V) dele
gates, aud a like uimilier of Kjxs-tutors, were
welcomed by the governor of Missouri. Of
these delegates but four resMind.sl from east
of tbe Ohio river, and not to exceed tliirty
from east and south of the Mississippi river,
fcverythina; Cut and llried.
"Tlie oteniig addrei of the chairman .lis
closed that the meeting was under the man
agement of the Tniou stock exchange of St.
1-ouis, aud holders of milling investments
The management reserved tbe right to select
100 delegate at large, aud tinder this rule
many silver men were admitted How
many delegates appeared umb-r apioiut
ment by the several governors aud how
mauy under the reserve.1 right to apsiint
100 at large was not disclose! Bland of
Missouri formulated the resolutions without
awaiting the submission of propositions or
any interchange of views."
Judge West says that the convention was
packed with men in the interests of tbe west
ern silver syndicates, who could not see any
good in anything Imt silver money, and that
the Ohio men and their views were not al
lowed a hearing. He said he felt "liken
bound boy at a husking" in the presence of
the wild westerners, who ran the whole
matter to please the big silver cliques.
The Ohio Idea That Didn't io.
He concludes as follows: "Perhaps I
should not omit to state the jwrt I attempt
ed, which was to bring before the convention
the propositions following:
"L That the further coinage of silver dol
lars should be suspended.
"A That further purchases of silver
bullion should be at tbe market value, and
paid for by the issuing of treasury certifi
cates for like amount.
"3. That such certificates should be made
payable in coin, and be receivable in pay
ment of all public dues, state and national.
4. "That tlie holder of.a.'io f uch certifi
cates or any multiple therf, should have
tbe right to exchange them for bullion in the
treasury at the highest market value it
might attain at any time after the (lassage of
tbe the act.
5. "That all purchases of bullion should be
restricted to tue production of our own
mines, thus securing to our own citizens
whatever increased demand and market
measure might afford. ")
Mr. West closus his report by stating that
the s-iuciples above set forth by him would
provide against auy injustice to the producer
of silver and against punics or depreciation
which might lw caused by ss-ulalive rings
or combinations.
