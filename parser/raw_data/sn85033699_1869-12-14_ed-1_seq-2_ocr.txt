A. G. MoDocoal, Esq., has been
nominated to represent McNalry county
in th6 'Constitutional Convention. The
Jackson Tribune claims that Mr. Mc
Doug.il is opposed to negro suffrage.
The New j-York" I'ost, a Republican
journal, notes tho fact that the President's
message, has nothing about any further
acquisition of territory, and adds: "Let
us hope, therefore, that the rumors ubout
the 'acquisition' of San Domingo are
false. Wc do not need any more unedu

'iEflE 'Washington correspondent if the
Cincinnati Gazelle thinks some dissatis
fied Republicans in the House of Repre
sentatives will oppose the repeal of the
tenurc-of-oDice law, still he thinks the
repealing bill will pass, but adds, "What
its fate will "be when it reaches the Senate
five or sis weeks hence, , no one can yet
teH."
The "Washington correspondent of the
Cincinnati Gazelle says the indications
are that Secretary Boutwell's recommen
dation for contraction at the rate of two
millions per month, will not find many sup
porters. The demand from the West and
South ;for more money is so strong that
Congress will not undertake to contract
the currency.
Me. Sr.MSEJt introduced a bill in the
Senate last week jproviding for a national
free banking syjslem, and yesterday a bill
for a like purpose "was introduced in the
House of Representatives. The feeling
in favor of such a system is said to lc in
creasing in Congress, and the indications
ajpJhaUt'Willbe established. If wc are
to have a paper currency, why cannot
the government give it to us v ithout the
aid of these shaving shops?
Me. S. P. Rowan is a-caudid.Htc in
Blount county for delegate to the Consti
tutional Convention. He is in favor of
extending the franchise to every male
citizen, without regard to color, and not
convicted of crime; favors negroes paying
a poll tax as mil as white people; but is
opposed to vesting the appointment of
Judges and . Attorneys General in the
Governor or IheXcgislature.
Tn Ens are two candidates in Madison
county for delegate 1o the Constitutional
Convention, Gen. A. W. Campbell and
Hon. Milton Brbwiii In a speech at
Jackson on the Cth inst, the former took
ground against negro suffrage. The po
sition tf the latter is Sated by the Jack
son Whig aa follows :
"On the quo-lion of negro Mill rage
Judge Brown thought the convention
should not take final action, but should
provide for its settlement by the first
Legislature that assembles after the adop
tion or rejection of the amended constitu
tion; and that in the election of members
to the Legislature the question of suffrage
should be voted for fceparateby.''

Tns Judiciary Committee of the United
States Senate lias agreed upon a bill pro
viding for the reassembling of the Georgia
Legislature, the exclusion of the members
of that body ineligible under the fourteenth
amendment, and the reseating of the
negro members who were expelled be
cause the constitution adopted by a Radi
cal Constitutional Convention and formally
ratified by such of the people of Georgia,
White and black, as were allowed to vote,
W1dth1 them inducible. The bill further
declares the Legislature to be provisional,
cntil the Senators and Representatives
loom Georgia are admitted to Congress.
The telegraph docs not inform us what
the Judiciary Committee propose to do
with the acta of the Legislature since the
State was formally admitted to Congress.
This biclnhanded usurpation will prob
ably bo ratified "by the Radical majority
in Congress, and we shall then present to
the world the spectacle of Congress dis
mantling a Slate because the people have
dared to oppose the party in power in
that body. Should the Radicals tucceed
in reducing Georgia to a provisional exist
once, we presume Tennessee will be the
next State attacked.
A mix passed the House of Represen
tatives at the last session of Congress and
the Senate a few days ago, removing tho
disabilities of several hundred citizens of
the Southern States, among whom are
the following Tcnncsseeans :

to marshal up his assets, to gather up the
odds and ends of business, and prepare
for a fair and square settlement. When
he docs that, all is well. He begins busi

society. Contributes his energy, his business
capacity to the commercial community.
He continues a live member of the busi
ness circle. He contributes to the health,
wealth and prosperity of the Slate, and
to the general good.
Why may not this be so, between States
or between States and individual debtors
and creditors ? To come directly to the
case in point : Tennessee, by the fortunes,
or misfortunes, of war, is overwhelmingly
in debt; primarilyorsccondarily. Noparade
of figures, no torturing of reports can
conceal that fact, either from ourselves or
from our creditors. It is best for us to
look facts in the face. "We have a large
amount of our bonds out. "We have en
dorsed largely, and upon these endorse
ments we are, in the estimation of the
commercial world, primarily responsible.
We have borrowed money and pledged
still other bonds as collaterals
to secure the payment of the
money thus borrowed. The day of
maturity has arrived and still no funds
to redeem our collaterals, and they arc
liable to be sacrificed. Wc have not
paid our July interest. We cannot pay
our January interest. To add still further
to our difficulties and embarrassment,
the Supreme Court of the United States
has decided that the tax collectors
and all other public officers shall receive
Bank of Tennessee notes (old issue) for
all taxes and other moneys due the State.
Under all these circumstances, terrible in
the extreme, what shall we do? We
confess a diffidence in our own judgment.
We have sought the company
and asked the views of both
bond holders and tax-payers, railroad
men and anti-railroad men. Still
wc find doubt and uncertainty in every
thing about us, growing more, perhaps,
out of the combativeness of human nature
than the unreasonableness of any of the
positions assumed. Wc have hesitated to
take position directly on any of the
many propositions before the Legis
lature. But something must be done
to relieve us. We respectfully sug
gest that the best thing which
can be done for the tax-payer, the bond
holder, the railroad and the State, is,
First: Repeal the law requiring the rail
roads to pay into the Treasury of the State
the Sinking Fund. If not, the la.it
remaining one will "O into the hands of a
Receiver, from which "deliver us."
Secondly. Fund the interest which has
not and it is evident cannot be met when
due.
Thirdly. Permit the railroads to retire
their indebtedness with State liabilities of
any order or series, dollar for dollar, and
issue, if necessary, first mortgage bonds
to enable them to do so. This will bring
in the bonds and coupons, etc., upon
w hich wc are liable, enable the State
grapple with its debt, save us from repu
diation and place us once more on the
high road to prosperity.

The movement in the Senate yesterday,
under the bill of Senator Cooper, of Bed
ford, gives promise that the Penitentiary
question may reach an early solution.
Our reporter furnishes a summary of its
main features. When this important bill
shall (as it will be by order) printed, we
mav take occasion to review it. For the
present, we can ouly say that its general
provisions appear to be judicious.
The seventh section seems to deal with
the rights or the lonner lessees some
what abruptly, as the matters involved
are now the subject of litigation, or, at
least, in a condition to become so. Ten
dayV notice to remove machinery whicl
it required monthsto erect, with power to
condemn and enter on possession in case
of failure or refusal, is applying tho legis
lative sword to the Gordian knot. How
ever, it is not to be presumed that tho bill
is intended to Wish matters to a settle
ment by measures of oppression.
We hope to see the affairs of this in
stitution for the past few years adjusted
and settled .fairly to all parties, and in a
manner fully to secure the interests of the
State ; and to sec it also placed upon a
basis for the future which shall make it
self-sustaining, and, in the language of
ilm bill, cause it to cease to be "a drain
on the State Treasury."
It seems that the internal revenue offi
cers all over the country have been lining
their pockets. Supervisor Dutdier, of
New York, writes to Commissioner Delano
that a practice prevails to a conuuieraoie
extent in his district by the revenue offl
cersof ckargingforthcirscrviccsinmaking
out papers that the law requires the tax
mvers to furnish, and asks if such offi
cers have a right to do it. Mr. Delano
replies that the practice cannot be sanc
tioned by the revenue office and must not
be permitted to prevail, and that all inter
nal reenuc officers who have taken money
for such purposes and who refuse to
refund the same at once, will w dis
missed from the service.

THE ISAIW OF TENNESSEE ANI
TAXES.
Mr. D. N. Kennedy, candidate in
Montgomery county for delegate to the
Constitutional Convention, publishes a
card in the Clarksville Chronicle, in
which he says :
"The Supreme Court of the United
Stales has decided that the State of Ten
nessee is bound to receive the notes of the
Bank of Tennessee for taxes; hence the
necessity of making some provision for
their redemption. As these notes have
generally passed out of the hands of the
peoplo, tho original holders; and at very
low rates, and aro now hdd by specula
tore mostly persons living out. of the
State who pay no taxes here, I am in
favor .of their redemption at the lowest
possible cost to the people.
I would, therefore, in levying the Stale
tax, provide that it may be discharged by
the payment in United States or National
Bank currency, of one-half the amount
levied ; thus make it the interest of the
tax-payers to pay in this currency, and
leave the Bank of Tennessee notes in the
hands of the present holders to be taken
up by the bank, from its debtors, in pay
ment of debts due and in train of collec
tion, and for real estate now owned and
held by the bank, which will absorb the
larger part of the circulation. The
amount not redeemed in one of the ways
suggested, should be provided for by an
issue of the bonds of the State at par.
Under no circumstances would I favor the
sale of the bonds to redeem the notes of
the Bank of Tennessee, or the receiving
of said note3 for taxes on the same basis
as United States currency."
THE CI1 INESE.
There is quite a furious newspaper
warfare going on among the native Amer
icans of California, upon the subject of
Chinese immigration. One party strong
ly favoring; the other as strongly oppos
ing. We are too far off to judge cor
rectly of the merits of the question. But
we find in the recent annnal report of the
Coroner of San Francisco the subjoined
extract, which, if true, relieves us of any
distress because of the absence of John
Chinaman from our midst. Speaking of
the Chinese, the Coroner says :
" I beg leave to call your attention to
these people: the filth of most of their
hab'tations cannot be described. I have
sec j a family of a woman and six children
living in a room not larger than six by
ten feet, with a child dead from small
pox w rapped in rags and placed under a
bench to get it out of the way.
" I respectfully invite your attention to
the condition of these people. It is well
worthy of your serious consideration, not
only from the filthy condition in which
they live, the neglect they undergo from
their own people when they are sick and
no longer able to work, but because they
are accumulating in our almshouses and
lunatic asylums. While they are able to
work, they are looked after by the com
panies which have imported them ; but
when they become sick, imbecile or dan
gerously insane, they are left to them
selves to lie on a piece of matting and
diej or are discarded by their own coun
trymen, taken up by the authorities and
sent to the almshouse or lunatic asylum.
The companies who bring these people
here should be compelled to take care of
them when they are unable to take care
of themselves.

The election for delegates to the Con
stitutional Convention occurs next Satur
day, and the people throughout the State
should bear in mind that by the act of
Dec. 1, 18G9, every voter is required to
vote in the civil district or ward in which
he resides. The following is the first scc
tion of the law :
"Be it enacted by the General As
sembly of the Stale of Tennessee,
That all voters in this State shall be
required to vote in the civil district
or ward in which they may reside.
Any person violating this act shall
he guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined not less
than twenty nor more than fifty dollar?,
provided, that Sheriffs and other officers
holding i lections shall be permitted to
vote in any ward or precinct in which
they may hold an election: and provided,
that if from any cause there should be a
failure to hold an election in any civil dis
trict or ward, then nothing in this uct
shall be so construed as to pi event any
voter fiom voting in an- other civil dis
trict or ward in his county or town, for
State or county olhcers at tlie tune pre
scribed by law."
The appointment by the President of
Geo. II. Yeaman, of Kentucky, as
United States Circuit Judge for this cir.
cuit, has created quite a flutter in Radical
circles. The Cincinnati Commercial
of the 11th inst. says:
"A good deal of surprise has been ex
pressed regarding the appointment of Mr.
Gcorce H. Yeaman to the United States
Judgeship of this Circuit, and some per
sons have presumed that Mr. Jesse R
Grant, the President's father, must have
had something to do with it. A reporter
visited the old gentleman last evening, to
ascertain whether he had special informa
tion upon the merits of Mr. Yeaman, and
was informed that Mr. Grant, sr., and
Mr. Yeaman were not personally ac
quainted; and the President's father seems
to have shared to some extent in tne
general surprise at the appointment, and
expresses himself on the subject with
great propriety. "
It is refreshing to find Grant disap
pointing the Radicals occasionally.

places where no one is selling; and so sure are we
they will bo liked, that we agree to refund the
money, if any one wishes to return the machines
free of freight, after a month's trial, according to
directions.
No husband, father, or brother should permit
the drudgery of washing with the hands fifty-two
