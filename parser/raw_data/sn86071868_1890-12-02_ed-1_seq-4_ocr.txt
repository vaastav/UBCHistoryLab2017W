THE rilKSIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho most remarkable thing about the
President's message, road in Congress
yesterday, is tho unusual vigor with
whioh the Chief Executive advocates
tho passage of the Federal election bill.
The President expected a re-election,
hut ho has no chanoo for even a renomi
nation, for nothing could kill his
chances more effectively.
Tho people not only do not favor
tho election bill, but strongly oppose it.
When >rr. Harrison talks of crime and
?violence being sectional, he either has no
desiro to stato tho truth or is laboring
under ignorance that is simply incom?
prehensible.
Tho Federal election bill is dead.
Tho last election killed it.

Captain Kino's novel "Between the
Lines" has won high praise from the
formest military authorities in Croat
Britain. Lord Wolsoley, Lord William
Boresford and General Fit/.wygram, all
assert that "'the description, in that
novel, of the cavalry fight, in Gettysburg
is tho most perfect picture of a battle In
tho English language.
THE ORPHANAGE AT MALKM.
An Important Meeting to be Ilebl in
Salem, Tuesday, December Otlt.
The Baptist General Asscoiation of
Virginir, at its regular annual session
in November, held in the city of Rich?
mond, determined to lecate their State
orphanage in or near tho city of Salem.
There was sharp competition among
dozen or more localities for the nrjac,
Tho superior advantages of Salem, the
liberal offer made, the character of her
pbpulatation, the characteristic influ?
ences, the abundant water supply
offered, the admirable church and edu?
cation.-! facilit ies, added to the fact that
the denomination had no lnstituion of
any kind west of tho Blue Ridgo to
which tho whole Baptist population of
tho State was pledged, decided the
question.
First, by an almost unanimous vote,
the trusts ?:?. in which body there werf
present only four men from all thai i c
iion ly',;.B' ft'fBt of the mountain:,, Saloin
wan sob is ted,
ilh:\ dc-Cibior, uj lne tru8icCa Was c.m
nTi"f"'..jy an unanimous vote of the
genera! association itself, largely com?
posed of d< li gates from Eastern Vir?
ginia. So tl at the inevitable conclu?
sion is that all Virginia pcrferrcd Salem
?to all the other plaocs competing for the
institution. T;.js orphanage ,n to 1*
made, a very comploto establishment
H for tho object ? contemplated, it will
ho opeu to orphans of fche iv'uitc race
without distinction as to sectional, s? <?
taria a or denominational pr.rentago.
No doubt, an years roll eu, i: will i?row
into very large proportions. Wo hope
therefore, thai the citizens gen ralb

Ina letter just received from tho 11* y
l?r. Hatcher, pte:dd< nt oT the trustees,
be ;:???.-! he following language: "Wr
will be in Salem Until \$'ertnewday, and
I would bo much gratified if wo could
have a puhllo mooting on Tuesday night,
in order that wo may explain to tho
citizens tho plans and purposes of tho
orphanage.
"There nro somo things that I would
be glad to say, and 1 am sure that, oth?
ers, especially Dr. Taylor, of Lexing?
ton, and Hro. .1. T. Kllyson. of Rich?
mond, would be ready to speak. Indeed,
all the members of tho committeo would
cheerfully appear in advecacy of tho
excellent enterprise if it should prove
desirable for them to do so."
Dr. Hatcher is a most entertaining
and impressive speaker. Dr. Taylor
has already impressed the Salem people
by his advocacy of this institution before
a large audience in tho city last sum?
mer.
Tho lion. .1. Taylor ' Ellyson, at
present tho distinguished mayor of
Richmond, and widely known from his
prominence in civil and political life,
will, no doubt, speak words of w isdom
worthy of the object and of the occa?
sion.
The meeting will be open to both
ladies and gentlemen, and wo hope
there will bo a full house.
It will be held in the City Hall, open?

S.vlkm, Dec. 1.?[Special]?Mr. E. S.
Strayer. president of the Glenmoro band !
Company, has gone on a business trip
to his old home down the valley.
A gentleman was in Salem to-day
prospecting for a wire nail plant which
iio wishes to locate here.
There is a very hopeful feeling in
Salem now. Letters are reooived every
mail asking about houses, both for rent
and to purchase. If bouses could be
obtained Salem*s population would ha
doubled soon.
The Improvement Company arc re?
ceiving a large number of letters asking
for information in regard to their sale.
The company is advertising exten?
sively North and Northeast. Every?
thing is stir and business in this olllce.
They are sending out, quite a number of
maps; these maps are very handsomely
engraved in colors by (Jr. Win. Unist, of
Philadelphia.
Tuk Timkr is commended by a num?
ber of prominent men. "Tuk Times,"
says one, "i* conducted in a gentlemanly
way that does not olfend by blank oaths

should follow The Timkh that way, as
they do in news and other matter."
THE NKW^SCIIOOL BUILDING.
It Will lie Opened on the l'lrnt of Next
Junnary.
As Tue TlMRS has before mentioned, the
new sohool building in the First ward,
northwest section, was, according to tho
terms of contract, to be completed by
the first of December. As noticed in
Sunday morning's issue, Superintendent
Dorr stated that the school would bo
opened on next New Year's day.
A reporter of Tue Times yesterday
called on Mr. Dcrr to ascertain the rea?
son of the postponement of the opening
of the new school until the first of the
year, and the reply was that tho Christ?
mas holidays are at hand and it would
scarcely bo good policy to open the
school one day and close it almost the
next for tho holidays.
"I have been authorized." Mr, Dorr
said, "by the finance committee of the
City Council to rent the building and
have the papers drawn up in tho proper
form.
??I want to call your attention to one
fact." tIn; superintendent said, "you
know there has been a good deal of un?
easiness felt in Roanoko in regard to
the s curity and safeness of ibis north
I west section building.
"It was exposed to a severe wind some
I timo ago. while only tho frame work
j was up. and Ulis framing was injured to
some extent, which caused a general ;
! feeling of uneasiness. 1 myself, in com
i puny with Mr. Stevens, visit* d the build
ing tho other day. and we found every- j
thing to our satisfaction, but to he alto- |
gether on the sale side. 1 bad the city
engineer to go around and examine t in *
building, and ho pronounces it absolute?
ly safe with the bracing it has.
"Hut, to runder security doubly secure,
wo had put in additional bracing, and a
small building has been placed on the
oast side of the school-hou.se. .so that
there need not bo the slightest appro
honsion concerning tho safety of this
building.
"Hy tho way," said Mr. Dorr, "J. C.
Graves, one of tho members of the
finance committee, des< rvos commenda?
tion for the manner iu which bo has
been exerting himself in behalf of the
schools. Ho has been doing a gri at
deal, even though having to Contend
with that harassing drawback the lack
of funds. Mr. Graves' activity i9 all tho
more conspicuous because of tho little
interest manifested on tho part of somo
others." _
Irish Electing* la Chicago.
Chicago, Dec. 1.?[Special]?It is
estimated that tho collections at tho
two Irish meetings in this city .Satur?
day night will foot up between $18,000
and $20,000, although tho final result
will not bo known tor several days yet.
O'Connor said that New York gave
$:i7,0t)0, but there were not such tremen?
dous obstacles as in Chicago. In reply
to a remark that their manifesto would
