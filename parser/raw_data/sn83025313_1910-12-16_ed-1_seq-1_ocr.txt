AND FINED $660
I*, G. Apple and J. S. Sigler, who
were arrested Sept. 7 charged with
appropriating several sheep belong*
ing to the Winnecook Haneh com
pany, plead guilty to the charge pre
ferred against them at the trial Wed
nesday before tue district court at
White Sulphur Springs, and Judge E.
K. Cheadle imposed a tine, which
with the costs amounted to smmh).
It seems that on or about the 7th of
September, Apple, assisted by Sigler,
corralled a bunch of sheep on Apple's
place, and notified the owners to get
tiieir property and pay damages, as
the sheep had destroyed twelve acres
of oats, so the defendants claimed.
When the owners of the sheep came
after their property they found two
sheep hides with tlieicompany's brand
tacked on Apple's barn. Apple has a
receipt showing that he purchased
several sheep about the first of Sep
tember from William Xickols, who
had purchased four sheep of the Win
necook Hauch company.
The witnesses called on the case
were: HermanPieske, William Nick
els, W. A. Harkley, Mrs. I*. G. Ap
ple, A. C. Ullman, and Mrs. Ilulda
Mayberry.
FARMER HAS
A GREAT COW
(i. Winsack, a well known Haynes
ford farmer, has a cow, says the
Great Falls Leader. Many farmers
have cows, but Mr. Winsak's cow is
a cow "as is a cow"—an extraordin
ary, remarkable bovine is this one.
The lirst remarkable fact about this
cow is that she is 22 years old. Mr.
Winsack has owned the animal for It)
years. Hut behold its remarkable
record for 22 years of life. That cow

is the mother of 22 calves, which are
about evenly divided as to sex. An
other calf is expected to arrive short
ly after Christmas—making a grand
total at the close of the year of 2:t
calves to the credit of this one beast.
Hess, if that is lier name, is of an
unknown breed, if she is of any breed
at all. It is probable that she is of
the common strain—just cow. Her
color is an artistic and pleasing
scheme in white and red and roan.
She nas horns like a Texas steer and
breath like the new-mown hay.
During the Id years of her alleg
iance to Mr. Winsack she has earned
him tMi.iNS) net, and there are now 40
head of stock, all descended from her,
roaming in Mr. Winsack's pastures.
She is a good milker, giving good,
rich, creamy milk, and will apparent
ly live for many years longer.
This is the remarkable record of
one cow. Hail, O champion ntirser
of the tinman race, quiet chewer of
nutritious cud, hail! Hail, brown
eyed Hess, of the sweet and motherly
disposition, you inspire us to say
with the poet:
"I think I could turn and live with
animals, they are so placid and so
self-contained.
I stand and look at them long and
long.
They do not sweat and whine about
their condition.
They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins.
They do not make me sick discussing
their duty to God.
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is de
mented with the mania of owning
things.
Not one kne»ls to another, nor to his
kind that lived thousands of years
ago.
Not one is respectable or unhappy
over the whole earth."
Hoy Shuler, the youngest son of the
Shuler family, arrived in the city
Saturday from his ranch near Lavi
nu. and will remain here until after
the holidays.

Tribute to Brother Van.
Fergus County Democrat: An old
timer who lias beard Brother A'au
preach in this section for the past
twenty-live years, banded in the fol
lowing:
Brother Van Orsdel, one of the pi
oneer ministers of the Methodis
clinch in Montana, preached from the
pulpit of the First Methodist church
in this city last Sunday. Brother
Van preaches as vigorously and with
the same earnest simplicity and ef
fectiveness as when the writer tirst
heard him, now nearly a quarter of a
century ago. Brother A'an knows
more people by name, has carried the
gospel into more hearts and done
more genuine good for the Master in
Montana than all the clergymen put
together that the writer knows of.
Brother A'an radiates goodness wher
ever he goes and he can't help it. llis
periodical visits among the people
with his glad smile and his hearty
hand-shake, does more to "keep ev
erybody sweet" than anything ever
invented. There is nothing to dis
count in Brother A'an's religion; he
believes w hat lie preaches and every
body knows it. When lie stands up
to he measured he is "all-wool and a
yard wide." May his days he multi
plied in the land, and bis shadow mav
it never grow less.

THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE IS READ
Congress gave respectfill attention
to President Taft's message delivered
last week, but there were compara
tively few members who were will
ing to concede the probability of fav
orable action at the preseiit session on
many of the recommendations con
tinued therein. This was in view of
the fact that the session will close
March 4.
Following is a brief summary of
the message:
Reciprocity treaty with Canada ap
parently will soon be concluded.
Urges prompt action for establish
ment of an American merchant mar
ine before completion of Panama can
al by granting of mail subsidy.
Economy lias been practised by
each oepaiihient chief and estimates
the year have been cut to the limit.
The final estimates for the year end
ing June 8u, m 12, amount to #tl80,4t)4,
»18, or s*.V2,W4,KS7 less than those for
the year ending June so, nut. These
e timates do not include tiie appro
priations tor the Panama canal.
Dec ares there are too many cus
toms districts and that mliuy of them
should lie abolished.
Alain body of criticism of tariff is
based on charge that ntteinpt to con
form to the policy of protection was
not honestly adhered to.
Complete review of all schedules of
tariff would not repeat evil from
which business of country has suffer
ed in times past. Halt in business
will lie prevented by treating scued
ules one by one as larnff boaul is able
to make its report.
HecommenUs passage of bills now
before congress to do with reducing
burden or litigation courts.
Urges passage of bill regulating is
suing of injunctions.
Thinks a would be wise to put into
'Continued an Third Hase.)
