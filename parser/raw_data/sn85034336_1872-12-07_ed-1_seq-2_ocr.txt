THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
WAlrHZNGToN, Dec. 2.-The Presi
dent's message was at 1:40p. m. receiv
.el and read. It commences with a rec
ognition of the blessings which the
Amerclean people have enjoyed within
the past year. The only' exception b
ing the great fire In Boston. It refers
to the Geneva arbitration and its satis
factorylresults, which left the Govern
ments, American and English, without
a shadow on their friendly relations,
which it sincerely hoped may forever
remain equally unclouded. It recom
mends the immediate creation of a
Board of Commissioners to decide on
the amounts to be paid to individuals.
It compliments Mr. Adams and Mr.
Bancroft for their eminent services in
the matter of the Geneva and San Juan
arbitrations. The decision in thelatter
leaving the United States" for the first
time without any question as to dis
puted boundaries. In regard to the
fisheries and to our relations with the
British North American provinces,
the President says that lie has received
notice that the Imperial Parliament
and the Dominican Government have
passed laws to carry the provisions of
the treaty of Washington into opera
tion, and he therefore recommends the
legislation of Congress in the sanme di
rection. He speaks of the friendly ro
lations of the United States with all
the governments of Europe. IIe refers
to the Vienna International Exposi
-tlon, and recommends the fitting up of
two national vessels to convey the
goods of exhibitors to Trieste, and sug
gests that a proposition be lmade to
have the next great exposition in this
country in 1876, at the time of the Con
tennial Celebration in Philadelphia.
He refers to the disturbed condition of
Caba, and says that no advance to
wards pacification in that Island has
been made, while the insurrection'had
gained no advantages and exhibited no
more of the elements of power or pros
pective success than a year ago. Neith
er had Spain succeeded in repressing
the Insurrection. The parties to the
strife were standing the same as for a
along time past. The continuation of
slavery in that Island lihe regards as
among the strongest causes of the con
tinuance of strife, and he thinks that
the abolition of slavery anil the insti
tution of other reforms could not fail to
advance the restoration of peace and
order. It was greatly to be hoped that
the present liberal government offpain
will voluntarily adopt that view.
Referring to our relations with Chi
na and Japan, the President recom
mends provisions for maintaining four
American youths in such of thosecoun
tfies as part of tile diplomatic llhnily of
Ministers.
He gives details of the revenue re
ceived in the past year, and of the re
duction to the amount of'over one hun
dred million dollars of the public debt.
He expresses a doubt whether any
other reduction in taxation is practica
ble for the present, and le recommends
that no more legislation be had on that
subject except to correct such erriors of
omission and commission inl the pres
eant laws, until sullicient time shall
have elapsed to prove that it t..: eo
done and still leave suoficient revoej '
to meet current expenses, pay the in
terest on the public debl,t, and provide
for the sinking fund, atnd suggests also
that the currency shall be, as soon as
possible, brought to a par with gold.
IHe says that various enterprises will bei
brought to the attention of Congrtnss for
the cheapening of transportations of
produce from the west to the Atluitic·
coast, and suggests that steps, slhoulld Ib
taken to gain all available information
to insure equitable and judicious: legis-'
lation in this connec"tionl. I It* rifrs
favorably to the proposed route t, con
nect the Mississippi Valley with the
Atlantic at Charleston and S.t\'ainnI,
by way of the Ohio :and Tc'tenl.use

Referring to Knu-Klut outrages, thel]
President expresses the convictjou t hut 1

obvious advantages ef ootl ordter aln. I

protect citizens from the lawless doings
of such combination. Hle makes sug
gestions in regard to the Indians that
they should all be confined to the ter
ritory south of Kansas, and that farms
be secured to them in fee and severally.
He recommends a further census be
taken in 1875, but that no reappoint
ment of members of Congress be made
under it in only one of the territories.
Utah is in the.econdition of affairs
regarded by thi President as unsatisfac
tory. It had seemed to be the policy
of the Utah Legislature to evade all
responsibility to the United States
Govern ment, and even to hold a posi
tion hostile to it. He recommends a
careful revision of the present laws,
and tle enactment of Jlaws that will
secure peace and the equality of citizens
there before the law, and thd ultimate
extinguishment of polygamy.
lie recommends an appropriation to
reimburse the city of Washington for
work done in front of the public reser
vations, and for the embellishment of
the public buildings and grounds. Ile
favors the action to give greater eclat
and success to the observance of the
conteunial atnivcr.3ary of American
independence.
In regard to Civil Service he says he
will carry out the rules during his
term of ollice, but suggests that there
be direct action of Congress to make
the system binding on his successors,
so as to require for the public service
a practical method of obtaining faith
ful and eflicient oflicers and employ
The reading of thle mcrnsagc was
conpleted at 2:50 o'clock, having occu
pied one hour and ten minutes.
THE ALAIIAAI ANARlCItiSTS.
The New York IlHrald says:
The unfortunate character of the re
construction policy applied tothe South
by the Rlepublican majority in Congress
is maniftisted in the political disturban
ces which have followed the elections
in Louisiana, Alabama and other cx
rebel States. Under our system of gov
emrinent it has b.'en our boast, justified
by the experience of nearly a century,
that our constantly recurring popular
elections serve us a safety-valve to po
litical excitement, and that with the
result of the appeal to the people all
our troubles terminiate. Thei defeated
party, however :strong, generally ac
cepts the verdict of thle najority, and
goes peacelully to work to repair its ill
fortune. In tihe States we have named
the election has only 1been a farce, and
t disgraceful conflicit hIas arisen between
the rival parlties in dcliance of the pop
ular will. In seine inst:lnces serious
consllequences are said to be threatened.
The politicians elsewhere take sides in
accordance with their aitilimations, and
help to aggravate the evil insteald of
endeavoring to relnive' it. The spec
tacile is ono11 disl(gracful to the nation,
:ant it illustrates the disordered condi
tion of the country, anti the pressing
necessity of a clhanllie in ouar Southern
pol icy.
In Alabanma, two Legislatures are in

speedy road out of the difficulty. They
will not long suffer contending factions
and ambitious politicians to plunge
them into anarchy and to destroy their
business and property. When Presi
dent Grant makes it evident that lie is
resolved to trust the Southern States as
they have trusted him, and to leave
them as free from Federal interference
and special laws as are the other States
of the Union, we shall soon have an
end of the present disgraceful scenes,
and the verdict of the people at the
polls will be accepted at the South as
peacefully as at the North. It is only
to be hoped that the President will be
backed up by Congress in his new
Southern policy. Nothing is more
certain than that the past efforts at re
construction have been a failure. For
this Republicans and Liberals,who are
now in the opposition, are equally re
sponsible, and hence they should unite
in repairing the mischief themy have
jointly done.
AN IRON ISLAND.
Tihe London Daily Telegraph lhao tilhe
following of the new war-ship, DI)vas
tation:
That the Dovastation is a st:ccess, so
far as she has been tried, is now admit
ted. The ponderous monster, which
squats upon the astonished waters with
a dead weight of 10,000 tons, takes any
ordinary waves with stolid indifflerence,
whether she receives thenm end-on or
upon bow, beam or quarter. The pro
digious hill of foam which her stem
piles up when under weigh, washes, as
was expected, clean over her forward
deck, and she is often submerged aft; i
but her massive mid -section rides,
quietly enough, and those on board her
when anchored in the rolling tide-way
at Spithead say that she wats "steadier
than the houses ashore." She turns
with great readiness, and itn a small
circle, and her speed, as proved in six
trials along the measured mile, is not
only equal to the promise of her de
signers, but it exceeds expectation. The
mighty engines driving this island of
iron with an indicated power of G,Gl00
horses, with seventy-seven revolutions
to the minute, got fifteen knots and a
half out of the ship, and her mean rate
at full steam is thirteen knots and three
quarters. Here, therefore, is a craft
vulnerable only to a very Sew guns, has
the swiftness of a mail packet, and the
handiness-thanks to her twin screws
-of a tug, while she could utitlze these
qualities to hurl upon the saitls of an
opponent the awful force of all her
10,000 tons moving with the velocity of
a spear. On board this remarkable
man-of-war there are no less thian thir
ty-four distinct and separate engines,
and, indeed the value which she rep
resents is as serious as her flghting ca
pacity. What remains to he learned is
tile behavior of tle ugly giant in a real
lBiscay gale; and whether or no tihe
coll-de-sac which she carries aft will or
will not prove a mistake in a heavy
following sea. With stability assured
to 55', with no top-gear to set her over,
and with decks which can be lmermeti
cally sealed, she would be satf enough;
but whenever she (does roll, or pitch, or
send, the rivets and fittings in her huge
. body will be shrewdly tried. Except
the Rlussian monitor, Peter the (rent,
Snothing floating could resist or even
" challenge such it ve'ssel, at one, so
Sstrong and -swift. The torpedo, no
doubt, may yet b. so developed asj to
r make the Devastation and all her t em
i rible sisters impotent against a dlefencd
Sed coast. On the high sells at present
rshei hias no superior, though we suppollls
ithe day will come when even this
'amnzing construction will he us iobso
lete as the three-deckers of Ne'lsen.
