Japanese Invasion.
There is to he a Japanese invasion
fnto the United States. This declaration
at first startles many who
have entertained the idea for some,
time that Japan was preparing to en- j
gage in a war with the United States.
But. luckily, though there would
not be the long-drawn-out trouble |
Russia had with the Japs, that is not j
the sort of Invasion announced. !
There is nothing military about it. I
Instead, colonies of these energetic. |
thrifty, intelligent people are to be |
established In the Mississippi valley. (
if news dispatches are correct.. "This {
invasion Is proceeding already ai a
surprising rate, hut so quietly that
it Is scarcely observed, and Is being
done without objection or protest by j
those who are so situated as to ob- \
serve Its progress and realize its sig- |
n I flea nee.
At present Bay City. Wis., a small I
town on the Mississippi river about
ninety miles below St. Paul. Is the I
rallying place of the Japanese. There '
a small colony has lioutrhr several j
hundred acres of land on a lake |
shore, including practically all of the ,
beach and the point making out in- i
to the river, and locally famous as
one of the best fishing places on the
upper Mississippi. A score of Japanese
have been at work for several
weeks cleaning this land and the
beach, and In the spring a landscape
gardener will arrive from Japan and
lay out the property in true Japanese
style, making of it a beautiful
and unusual summer resort. ,
But the Japanese are not to be .
content with an Industry that is
profitable only in the summer. They ,
have bought the Bay City roller mill. ]
and are negotiating for other prop- ,
ertlos |n and near the town, evident- s
!y with the purpose of establishing j
a manufacturing centre. It is likely
that the first buildings put tip will .
be a canning factory and a pickling ,
house. These )vill be some distance' ,
froDi the resort. f?
? T- ...i.- ... i),.v ntv ;
Ur. 1 . rvuuicl. ? II>? m <11 . J
wit hhis wife and children, is direct- _
lug the work. He is a well-educated j
Japanese of middle ago and en gag- f
!ng manners. Last September he
went to Bay City to deliver an ad- j
dress in a lecture course, and re- ,
muinod several days, ostensibly for
no other reason than that he enjoyed ,
the r *st. But a few weeks later he r,
returned, began negotiations for r
property, and made several parch as- v
es. Then several young Japanese x
came and took up their homes in (
houses Dr. Kama had bought. Now
there are more than a score of ehar<
acteristicallv industrious and reti- ^
cent Japanese in the town. Evident- \ t
ly they are well-educated men, of , .
good families, and the Americans In |
the town have received them cor- 1
dially. Among the newcomers are I
several Japanese who had worked as f
bellboys in Minneapolis and St. Paul .
hotels for many months, learning to f
speak English, and some of them ^
studying in the schools or colleges. ^
It is understood that the Bay City
colony will number at least 2 00 next ,
.summer and that Dr. Kunia intends
to establish other colonies a favorable
points in the upper Mississippi
valley when this one is well under
way. He appears to have good fi- j
nancial backing.
its infnpmiifinn of :i most in
v
teres ting nature t.o most all the people
of the United States. rt seems
not at all strange that, the Japanese
question under the circumstances
1s somewhat under agitation. '
Perhaps, it Is well it is. that the ad- ''
visability of permitting such an invasion
may l?o intelligently determined
and he met with the proper <>
action. h

It is generally understood the |
Japanese as a race and nation are i
superior to the Chinese. ajjd. of
course, the same immigration re.xjrictions
will hardly apply to them,
and yet even as to the Chinese there
is a rapidly growing sentiment favoring
the repeal of the Chinese exclusion
act.
What the final outcome of this invasion
on the part of the Japanese j
may be cannot be forseen. but, if ;
i? i? in lrnrtd faiih. as the inclination i
of these colonies to permanent in- 1
d us try and possession of property j
seems to Indicate, their coming will
not prove a.t all objectionable, provided
they respect and obey American
law. habits and customs.
.Marriage and Divorce f>uw8.
One of the very Important matters
which President Roosevelt In his annual
message to Congress urges the
national legislature to give attention 1
to 1s the question of marriage and .<
divorce. It. is a question of vital
importance to the nation because it
relates to the home, the vital spark t
of a nation's life. j
The President believes that the ^
whole question of marriage und di- j
vorce should be relegated to the au- t
tliority of the national congress be- ^
cause "the wide difference in the j
laws of the different States on the (
subject result in scandals and
abuses." "There Is no thing so
vitally essential to the welfare of the
nation." he says, "nothing around 1
which the nation should so bend it- f
;clf to throw every safeguard as the ^
iome life of the average citizen." 1
This is true. When the safe- 1
guards of the home become weaken- ^
<1 permitting the home to dlsinteg- ^
-ate. disaster confronts the nation. 11
r\> 11?*?- :?k tip rh^ home would mean :s
h? death of the nation. Willful 1
t**rflity nn ;<ns race suicide and that
>espeaks decay and demoralization j
or our government. Laxness of the j t
nnrriago and divorce laws tends to j \>
?reak up homes and deprive not only i
nan and woman of their pleasures i
iml privileges afforded l>y i he home p
>tzt also blights the lives of the o
hildreu by raking away from thoni p
he privileges and the advantages e
vhich the home gives them and E
vhich they should have. The fate w
>f government depends upon the
ducat ion of the youth. This eduation
in the broad sense means ^
11 oral as well as mental developnent
of the young, they who will ^
ottie day take their part In the op.- ^
ration of the government. ^
There should be stricter marriage ^
ml divorce laws. And there should
>? a uniformity in those of the var- ^
ous States to prevent the abuses of
hem. Federal regulation of the
?rimary principles of these laws
vould bring this about and surely 11
Congress should give attention to 1
his all important and vital subject. s<

spelling in the President's message
says the improvement is not perceptible
to the naked eye. We in/er
from this that the"'Register had Its
eye dressed (clothed), when It read
the message, and. if so with what?
An ordinary glass or something that j
magnifies? And does that paper :
mean to say that Its readers had to j
dress their eyes to read the message
as printed in the Begister? If so, is j
not. i he Register very hard on the j
eyes? ,
A grapevine dispatch from Grape- I
vine fork of Fourpole to Huntington
has it that a man drilling a posthole
struck a milky fluid In the nature
of oil and that the denizens are
burning the stuff in their lamps.
The dispatch falls to say whether
they are using it in their coffee. The
mere fact that it burns does not
necessarily classify it as oil. as all
know, who have gotten hold of hotel
soup sometimes.
The Parkersburg Dispatch-News,
he puper with a double name at 1
east thinks there is something up in j
eference to the postmastership in
ts city. Of course, there is somehing
and something up, else Gibbens 1
vould hold the job. This, however, i
s not meant to be a reflection on
jibbens. nor the other fellows either. I
If the j>ersonnel of the representaion
this State has at the Rivers and
iarbors Congress, now in session at
.Vashington. is a criterion no State 1
s more capably represented. Among
he delegates attending from West
Mrginia are Senator S .B. Elkins. G. t
l Northcott and ex-Governor W. A.
lacCorkle. The representation is "
ssuredly a credit to any State in the
"nlon.
1
While prosperity is one of the j
hings that counts in the increase of jg
'ages that is being granted all over |
lie country, there is every reason lo | j
elieve that labor and capital begin j
r? more keenly appreciate one an- j ^
ther than ever before and that em- !
lovers are recognizing the fact that ^
very man is worthy of his hire. ^
tetter wages usually means better
'ork. i r|
Harry Woodynrd will dictate the n
ppoint.tnent of a postmaster at Par- c
ersburg, notwithstanding the >
atement that the Dispatch-News F
ays there is something up. We are S
i I ling to wager?not beyond our b
leans, however?that the name of
le next postmaster there will be

A Parkersburg paper imputes to

ALL READY TO WEAR
At any rate the Parkersburg papers
admit that they are not going
to name the next postmaster of their
city.
Congressman Harry Woodyard
will name the man. and not the
newspapers, except one or two which
are on the inside. They have already
named him.
Perhaps, the Parkersburg NewsDispatch
ought to have been Gifrbenized
before the campaign for Congressman
opened. We wonder what
the effect would have been.
We never saw it written or printed
da-da before, though It has often
been ma. Maybe the Parkersburg
News-Dispatch has introduced a
simple way of hyphenating.
Even the express companfes are
increasing wages and keeping up
with these prosperous times by doing
it.
Tom and Jerry are to spend the
holidays in Parkersburg. One paper
there rejoices, but says not why.
