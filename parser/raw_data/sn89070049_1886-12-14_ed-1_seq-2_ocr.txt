The Iiulgarian delegates to Uussia have

The rumor of great loss by death from

The disease is confined to a few importeil

The rumor is out again that Secretary
Mnnnintr, of the Treasury, will soon re

statement this time by the announce
ment that Attorney Cencral (iarland will
also retire from the Cabinet. The Presi
dent says he knows nothing atiout the
matter, and as far ar as he is concerned,
the resignations are not likely to take
place.
An evidence of the condition of the
money market may lie had by referer.ee
to the raid on a railroad train in Texas on
the 11th inst. Two men boarded a train
near IVlleview, and after searching the
p:.senger-. succeeded in getting only
$liM). Hither the traveling public in
Texas have no money, or a haipy way
of keeping it out of the clutches of the
robbers.
We hoe the news is not true as re

Under the heading

others so recklessly that a word of ex
pl.ination is necessary. If we read the
Palatka Nrivvss eoirectly it favors the

we take pride and pleasure in l-einp the
very iod frienil of our distinguished

Although, in our opinion the Senate is
a Itotly of nioneytiI inonooli3Ta, and a

A great aruiy, w hich had cotjiiuere-l
in a series of battles tint finest troops of
the age, was disorganized and ruined by
the luxury an 1 leisure won by its own
victories. So the Democratic party of
the South stands in danger of destruc;-.
tion by its overthrow of the Republican
opposition. Kvery where the house is
becoming divided against itself, ami
when that is an accomplished fact it re
quires no prophet to predict the result.
To us who U-lieve that the principles of
Democratic policy are essential to the
well-being of our government, such a
future seems full of danger to the whole
country, anil the thoughtful Democrat
looks earnestly for shelter from the com
ing storm. In Virginia it has already
burst. In Tennessee and (Jeorgia the
clouds are plainly visible; in Mississippi
anil Alabama the rumble f the thunder
is in the ears of a people divided and
Jismayed; in Florida we see no cloud
and we hear no thunder as yet, but the
air is full of electricity. Despite the im
mediate and immense benefits which
have accrued to the State, the Dis?ton
sale is stilt condemned; the railroads
which were lately hailed as saviors, are
reproached as tyrants; the destruction
of the enemy has invited to u? the camp
followers whose fingers only itch for
spoils, and the disgust felt for these
strangi companions are learning many,
who nto:l staunchly during ditliculty
and danger, to look elsew here for deliv
erance than to the iclitical gods of the
past.
It is vain to preach unity to u-, as the
cry ot "peace, jieacc" was vain in the
ears of Patrick Henry. There can lie
no unity based solely on n !f interest.
tlie preservation u jMiwer or tin suc
cessful manipulation of convention and
elections. A great party must have a
common tie touching the constant faith
and daily practice of all, or it becomes a
mercenary army like that of Hannibal,
and, like it, liable to disorganization and
destruction at the llrst moment of leiri
ure or immediately on the removal of a
pleasing dang r. i'nlike that army, we
jiossc-s no great leader whose ability we
can trust, who is easily lirst in our con
fidence and airection, in whose rise or
fall we can lake an abiding interest : s
partisans. In the South the common in ed
of help against a common enemy has
lieen removed by the departure of the
earjiet-lMggcr and the elimination of the
negro vote. Something must take the
place of this common tie or the party
will fall to pieces as a ImmIv decays when
the principle of life departs. What
shall touch the heart f each Democrat,
with tnc vivifying truth essential to
party life, bind him to his fellow- and
separate him from h:senemv'r
Some of our contemporaries U iieve
that this e immon ground for all Demo
crats is marked out in the President's
message. I'.ut we m ed much more than
this. Within the lines there laid down
Mr. Cleveland may conduct a siicces- fill
administration, lb can improve the
business methods of the dilIVret:t do
pai tmeiits, lift us from the sl ugh of ex
travagance into which the Republicans
had fallen, secure the modification and
reduction of the tai'll'. and probably
command a re-nomination. I hit even
all this and much mote of the a un
kind, will only insure the building up of
one man's jMiwerand usefulness, rot the
growth of the IVmocratie party nor the
rehabilitation of parly l iu s. Mr. Cleve
land may le tin Moses who has led us
from the wilderness and g"ve us rules
for jxditical molality, but he is surely
not the Joshua who can lead us to new
conquest and blow down the walls of
the enemy's strongholds. When he
leaves us on the hound try of the land of
promise, . n , we stand where we
did liefore. and must tlu u make t he light
if we would not wander yet again in the
desert.
If tlf j'ntf is ih .ni m'.t-j if '., its
existence is based on the supjei t of some

If sup rstition were as prevalent to
day as it was in the dark ages, when it
was generally beliived that coming
events could in a very great measure be
foretold by changes in the moon, or the
action of tin- elements, it is probable that
the severe storm which prevailed upon
the opening day of the present session of
Congress would be looked upon as an j
evil omen, and an indication that the

how dull and stupid the procei ding-. ;
Aside from the tisu-tl formalities inciiletit 1
to tie opening ibiy id the session, the '
usual handshakings and pleasant vrcet :

opening day of the si s-ion w as marl ed
hy no incident of sjH i-ial interest. The '
desks of several of the S tut tors and!
MetnU-rs were ornamented with Moral
tributes from admiring friends. In the
allotment of seats in the House Mr. Cox
si cured a des:rnble seat in the fronl row.
He was kept busy most of the time in
nceivipg the congratulations of his
former associates, and his countenance
woie a look of contentment which clear- '
ly indicated that he w as pleased to find
himself once m re upon the lloor of the
