President's Message.
Congress re-assembled on Monday, Dec.
4th, and President Grant delivered tlie fol
lowing Message :
To the Senate and II mm of lli-presentaticesr.
In addressing my third annual message
to the law-making branch of the Govern
ment it is gratifying to be able to state
that during the past year success has gen
erally attended the ell'iit to execute all laws
found upon the statute books. The policy
has been, not to inquire into the wisdom of
the laws already enacted, but to learn their
spirit and intent, and to enlorce them ac
cordingly. The past year has, under a wise Provi
dence, been one of general prosperity ' to
the nation. It has, however, been attended
with more than usual chastisements in the
loss of life and property by storm and fire.
These disasters have served to call forth the
Lest elements of human nature in our
country, and to develope a friendship for
lis on the part of foreign nations, which
goes far toward alleviating thy distresses
occassional by these calamities. The be
nevolent who have so generously shared their
means with the victims of these misfortunes
will reap their reward in the consciousness
of having performed a noble act, and in re
ceiving the grateful thanks of men, women,
and children wlios; sufferings they have
relieved.
The relations of the United .States with
foreign Powers continue to be friendly.
The year has oven an eventful one in wit
nessing two great nations, speaking one
Janguage, and Having one lineage, settling
)y peaceful arbitration disputes of long
standing, and liable at any time to bring
those-nations into bloody and costly con
flict. An example has thus been set which,
if successful in us issue, may be followed
ly other civilized nations, and finally be
4the means of returning to productive indus
try millions of men now maintained to set
tle the disputes of nations by the bayonet
and the broadside.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty
alluded to which has been concluded since
t .adjournment of Congress with her
jUritanmc Majesty, and a copy of the proto
cols or the conferences of th-j Commission
ers by whom it was negotiated. This treaty
provides methods for adjusting the ques
tions pending between ' the two nations.
Various questions are to be adjusted by
arbitration. 1 recommend Congress at an
early day to make the necessary provision
for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the sev
eral commissions on the j art of the L'n'.led
jSta,tes, called for by the treaty.
His Majesty the King of Italy, the Presi
dent of the fcwiss Confederation, and his
Majesty the Emperor of lirazil, have each
consented, on the joint request of the two
Powers, to name an arbitrator for the tri
bunal at Gene vi. I have caused my thanks
lo be suitably expressed for the readiness
with which toe joint request has been com
plied with, by the appointment of
gentlemen of eminence and learning to these
important positions.
llis Majesty the Emperor of Germany
iias been pleased to comply with tin; joint
request of the two Governments, and has
consented to art as the arbitrator of the
disputed water boundary between the
X' nited States and Great Britain. The con
tracting parties in the treaty have under
taken to regard as between themselves cer
tain principles of public law, for which the
1J nited Mates have contended from the
commencement of this history. They have
jdso agreed to bring these principles to the
knowledge of the oilier maritime Powers,
and to invite tliem to acceed to them. Ne
gotiations are ironic; on as to the form of
the note by which the invitation is to be ex
pended to the other Powers.
I recommend the legislation necessary on
the part of the United States lo bring into
operation the articles of the treaty relating
to the fisheries, and to the other matters
pouching the relations of the United States
towards the British North American posses
sions, to become, operative so soon !is the
proper legislation shall be had on the part
of Great Britian and its possessions. ' It is
much to be desired that this legislation mav
become operative before the lishermen of
the United States bein to make their ar
raugements for the coming season.
1 have addressed a eoniumiucation to the
Governors of New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, an 1 Wis
consin, urging upon the governments of
those States, respectively, tl:e necessary a r
turn on their part lo carry into effect the
object of the article of the treaty which con
templates the use of the canals on either
fide, connecting with the navigations of the ;
Lakes and rivers forming the boutidarv, on j
terms of equality by the inhabitants of both !
countries, it is hoped that the importance
of the object and the benefits to flow there- j
from will secure the speedy approval and
legislative sanction of the States concerned.
1 renew the recommendation for an appro-j
priation for determining the true position of;
the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, where it j
form, the boundary between the United j
States and British North American posses- j
fions between the lake of the Woods ami j
the summit of the liocky Mountains. The
early action of Congress on this recommen
dation would put in the power of the War
Department to place a force in the field dur
ing the next summer.
The resumption of the diplomatic rela
tions between France and Germany has en
abled me to give directions for the with
drawal of the protection exte.ided to Ger
mans in Franco by the diplomatic and con
sular representatives of the United States
in that country. It is just to add that the
delicate duty " of this projection has been
performed by the Minister and Council
General at Paris, and the various consuls in
France under the supervision of the latter,
with great kindness as well as with pru
dence and tact. Their course has received
the commendation of the German Govern
ment, and has wounded no susceptibility of
the French.
The Government of tlw Emperor of Ger
many continues to manifest a 'friendly feel
ing towards the United States, and a de
sire to harmonize with the moderate and
j iSt policy which this Government main
tains in its r 1 tiious with Asiatic Powers,
as well as with the South American
Kepublics. have given assurances that
the friend I j' feelings of that Government
are fully shared bv the United States.
Kc
J have been officially informed of the annex
ation p.f the State of the Church to the
JCimrdom of Italy, and the removal of the
capital of the Kingdom to Rome. In con
formity with the established policy of the
United States, I have recognized this change.
The ratifications of the new treaty of com
merce between the United States and Italy
have been exchanged. The two Powers
have agreed in this treaty that private pro
perty at sea shall be exempt from capture
in case of war between the two Powers.
The United States have. spared no oppor
tunity of incorporating this rule into the
obligation of nations.
It has been made the agreeable duty of
the United States to preside over a confer
ence at Washington between the Plenipo
tentiaries of Spain and the allied South
American Republics, which has resulted in
an armistice, with the reasonable assurance
of a permanent peace.
The intimate friendly relations which
have so long existed between the United
States and Russia continue undisturbed.
The visit of the third son of the Emperor is
a proof that there is no desire on the part of
his Government to diminish the cordiality
of those relations. The hospitable recep
tion which has been jriven to the Grand
Duke is a proof that on our side we share
the wishes of that Government. The inex
cusable course of the -Russian Minister at
Washington rendered it necessary to ask
his recall, and to decline longer to receive
that functionary as a diplomatic representa
tive. It was impossible, with self-respect,
or with a just regard to the dignity of the
country, to permit Mr. Cataeazy to con
tinue to hold intercourse with this Govern
ment after his personal abuse of Govern
ment officials, ami during his persistent in
terference, through various means, with the
relations between the United States and
other Powers. In accordance with my wish
es this Government has been relieved of
further intercourse with Mr. Cataeazy, and
the management of the affairs of the Impe
rial Legation has passed into the hands of a
gentleman entirely unobjectionable.
With Japan we continue to maintain inti
mate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado
has, since the close of the last session of
Congress, selected citizens of the United
States to serve in oilices of importance in
several departments of government. I have
reason to think that this selectiou is due to
an appreciation of the disinterestedness of
the policy which the United States have
pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to
continue to maintain this disinterested and
just policy with China as well as Jaj a '.
The correspondence transmitted herewith
shows that there is no disposition on the
part of this Government to swerve from its
established course.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to
the barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked
sailors on the Corean coast, 1 instructed our
Minister at Peking to endeavor to conclude
a convention with Corea for securing the
safety ami humane treatment of such mari
ners. Admiral Rodgers was instructed to
accompany him with sufficient force to pro
tect him in case of need. A small survey
ing party sent out, on reaching the coast,
was treacherously attacked at a disadvan
tage. Ample opportunity was given for
explanation and apology for the insult.
Neither came. A force was then landed.
After an arduous march over a rugged and
diflicult country the forts from which the
outrages hail been committed were reduced
by a gallant assault, and were destroyed,
llaviug thus punished the criminals, and
having vindicated the honor of the Hag, the
expedition returned, finding it impract icable,
under the circumstances, to conclude the
desired convention. I respectfully refer to
the correspondence relating thereto here
with submitted, and leave the subject for
such action as Congress may see tit to take.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet re
pealed the very objectionable laws estab
lishing what is known as the "Free Zone"
on the frontier of the United States. It is
hoped that this may yet be done, and also
that more stringent measures may be taken
by that Republic for restraining lawless
persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico
by its own action willSrjron relieve this Gov
ernment of the difficulties experienced from
these causes.
Our relations with the various republics
of Central and South America continue,
with one exception, to be cordial and
friendly.
It is a subject for congratulation that the
great Empire, of lirazil lias taken the initia
tory step toward the abolition of slavery.
Our relations with that Empire, always cor
dial, will naturally be made more so by this
act. It is not too much to hope that the
Government of Brazil may hereafter find it
tor its interest, as well as intrinsically right,
to advance toward entire emancipation more
rapidly than the present act contemplates.
1 desire to direct your attention to the
fact that citizens oftne United States, or
persons claiming to be citizens of the United
States, are large holders in foreign lands of
this species ol property forbidden by the
fundamental law of their alleged country.
1 recommend to Congress to provide, by
stringent legislation, a suitable remedy
against the holding, owning, or dealing in
slaves, or being interested m slave property
in foreign lands, either as owners, heirs, or
mortgagers, by citizens of the United
States.
It is to be regretted that the disturbed
condition of the island of Cuba continues to
be a source of annoyance and of anxiety.
The existence of a protracted struggle in
such close proximity to our own territory,
without apparent prospect of an early ter
mination, cannot be other than an object of
concern to a people who, while abstaining
from interference in the affairs of other Pow
ers, naturally desire to see every country in
the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty,
ami the blessings of free institutions. Our
naval commanders in Cuban waters have
been instructed, in case it should be
come necessary, to spare no effort to pro
tect the lives and property of bona file
American citizens, and to maintain the dig
nity of the tlair.
it is hoped mat all pending questions with
Spain growing oU: of the affairs in Cuba
may be adjusted in the spirit of nonce and '
conciliation which has hi herto Guided the

! To give impoitance, and to add to the
; eSiciency of our diplomatic relations with
. Japan and China, and to further aid in re-
hrfoii? cmocvaL, (hctr(olfc,
taining the good opinion of those peoples,
ancj to secure to the United States its share
of ilui commerce destined to flow bet tree n
those nations and the balance of the com
mercial world, I earnestly recommend that
an appropriation be made to support at least
four Ameiican youths in each of those coun
tries to serve as a part of the official family
of our Ministers there. Our representa
tives would not even then be placed upon
an equality with the representatives of
Great Britain and of some other Powers.
As now situated, our representatives in
Japan and China have to depend for inter
preters and translators upon natives of those
countries who know our language imper
fectly, or procure for the occasion the ser
vices of employees in foreign business hous
es, or the interpreters to other foreign Min
isters. The national debt has been reduced to the
extent of yO,057,12G 80 during the year;
ami by the negotiation of national bonds, at
a lower r::te of interest, the interest on the
public debt has been so far diminished that
now the sum to be raised for the interest
account is nearly $17,000,000 less than on
the 1st of March, 18d9. It was highh
desirable that this rapid diminution should
take place, both to strengthen the credit of
the country and to convince its citizens of
their entire ability to meet every dollar of
liability without bankrupting them. But,
in view of the accomplishment of thesd de
sirable ends ; of the rapid development of
the resources of the country ; its increasing
ability to meet large demands, and the
amount already paid, it is not desirable that
the present resources of the country should
continue to be taxed in order to continue
this rapid payment. I therefore recommend
a modification of both the tariff and internal
tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from
internal sources be abolished, except those
collected from spirituous, vinous, and malt
liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and
from stamps.
In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a
careful estimate be made of the amount of
surplus revenue collected under the present
laws, after providing for the current expen
ses of the Government, the interest account,
ami a sinking fund, and that this surplus be
reduced in such a manner as to afford the
greatest relief to the greatest number.
There are many articles not produced at
home, but which enter largely into general
consumption through articles which are
manufactured at home, such as medicines
compounded, fcc, fce., from which very lit
tle revenue is derived, but which enter into
general use. All such articles I recommend
to be placed on the free list. Should a
further reduction prove advisable I would
then recommend that it be made upon those
articles which can best bear it without dis
turbing home production or reducing the
wages of American labor.
1 have not entered into figures, because to
do so would be to repeat what will be laid
before you in the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury. The present laws for collect
ing the revenue pay collectors of customs
small salaries, but provide for moieties,
(shares in all seizures,) which, at principal
ports of entry particularly, raise the com
pensation of those officials to a large sum.
It lias always seemed to me as if this sys
tem must, at times, work perniciously. It
holds out an inducement to dishonest men,
should such get possession of those offices,
to be lax in their scrutiny of goods lo enable
them finally to make larger seizures. Your
attention is respectfully invited to this sub
ject. Continued fluctuations in the value of
gold, as compared with the national curren
cy, have a most damaging effect upon the
increase and development of the country in
keeping up prices of all articles necessary in
everyday life. It fosters a spirit of gam
bling prejudicial alike to national morals
and the national finances. If the question
can be met as to how to give a fixed value
to our currency, that value constantly and
uniformly approaching par with specie, a
very desirable object will be gained.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy show? an
Improvement iu the number and efficiency of the
naval force without material increase in the ex
pense of supporting it. This is due to the policy
which has been adopted, and is being extended as
fast as our material will admit, of using smaller
vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By this
means we have heen enabled to occupy at once a
larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more fre
quently the posts where the presence of our flag is
desirable, and generally to discharge more efficient
ly tlie appropriate duties of the navy in time of
peace, without exceeding the number of men or the
expenditure authorized by law.
The suggestions of the report ns to the necessity
of increasing and improving the material of the
navy, and the plan recouui iiuled for reducing the
pcrt'jiinel of the service to a peace standard by the
gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the
reduction of others, and the employment of some in
the service of the commercial marine, are well con
sidered, and deserve the thoughtful attention of
Congress.
The suggestions of the Postmaster General for
improvements in the Department presided over by
him are earnestly recommended to your special at
tention. Especially do 1 recommend favorable con
sideration of the plan for uniting the telegraphic
system of the United State with the postal system.
It is believed that by such a course the cost of tele
graphing could be much reduced and the service as
well, if not better rendered. It would secure the
further advantage of extending tlia telegraph through
portions of the country where private enterprise
will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above'
all, the efforts to bring a people widely separat?d
into a community of interest, are always benefitted
by a rapid intercommunication. Education, the
groundwork of republican institutions, is encour
aged by increasing the facilities to gather speedy
news from all parts of the country. The desire to
reap tiie benefit of such improvements will stimu
late education.
There has been imposed upon the Executive
branch of the Government the execution of theaci
of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonly
known as the Kuklux law, iu a portion of tin State
of South Caroiiua. The necessity of the course
pursued wiil be demonstrated by the report of the
Committee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Ua
der the provisions of the above act, I iss'icda pro
clamation calling the attention of the people of the
United States to the sums, and declaring niv reluc
tance to exercise any of the extraordinary "powers
thereby conferred upon me, except in case of im
perative necessity, but making known my purpose
to exercise such powers whenever it should become
neeosary to do so for the purpose of securing to all
citizens of the United States t lie peaceful enjovment
of Vac rights guaranteed to them bv the Constitu
tion and the laws." After the passage of this law,
information was received from time to time that
combinations of th. character referred to in this law
existed, ami were powerful in many parts of the
Southern Sra.es, particularly in certain counties in
me htat'J ot Nlilth Carolina. Careful investigation
T f; nU WT :l'trLil,Re.! that'in llin" CO!!a-
ties of that State sich com!);natim3 were active and
powerful, embracing a sufficient nrt;s.n nfti.,.:
z:-ns to control the local authority and having among
other things the object of depriving the emancipated
class of tlie substantial lcnelit3 of fncdom, and of
preventing the free political action of those citizens
who did not sympathize with their own views.
Among their operations were frequent scourgings
and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated
at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost
all cases being citizens of different political senti
ments from their own, or freed persons who had
shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other
citizens. Thousands cf inoffensive and well-disposed
citizens were the sufferers bv this lawless violence.
Thereupon, on the 13th of October, 1871, a procla
mation was issued, in terms of the law, calling upon
the members of those combinations to disperse with
in five days, and to deliver to the marshal or mili
tary officers of the United Suites all arms, ammuni
tion, uniforms, disguises, and other means and im
plements used by them for carrying out their unlaw
ful purposes. This warning not having been heeded,
on the 17th of October another proclamation was
issued suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus in nine counties in that State. Direction was
gh en that within the counties so designated per
sons supposed, upon creditable information, to be
members of such unlawful combinations should be
arrested by the military forces of the United States,
and delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with ac
cording to law. In two of said counties, York and
Spartanburg, many arrests have been made. At the
last account, the number of persons thus arrested
was one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred,
whose criminality was ascertained to be of an in
ferior degree, were released for the present. These
have generally made confessions of their guilt.
Great caution has been exercised in making these
arrests, and notwithstanding the large number, it is
believed that no innocent person is now in custody.
The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the
judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as
it appeared that the authorities of the United States
were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the
law, many persons absconded, and there is good
ground for supposing that all of such persons have
violated the law. A full report of what has been
done under this law will be submitted to Congress
by the Attorney General.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar
ism, repugnant to civilization, to decency and to the
laws of the United States. Territorial officers, how
ever, have been found who are willing to perform
their duty in a spirit of equity and with a due sense
of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither po
lygamy nor any other violation of existing statutes
will be permitted.within the territory of the United
States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled
saints that we are now dealing, but with their prac
tices. They will be protected in the worship of
God according to tlie dictates of their consciences,
but they wiil not be permitted to violate the laws
under the cloak of religion.
It ma3r be advisable for Congress to consider what,
hi the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to
be the status of plural wives and their oltspring.
Tlie propriety of Congress passing an enabling act
authorizing the Territorial Legislature of Utah to
legitimize all children born prior to a time fixed in
the act might be justified by its humanity to these
innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and
not a recommendation.
The policy pursued towards the Indians lias re
sulted favorably so far as can be judged from the
limited time during which it has been in operation.
Through the exertions of . the various societies of
Christians to whom has been entrusted the execu
tion of the policy, and the Board of Commissioners
authorized by the law of April 10, 18G9, many tribes
of Indians have been induced to settle upon reserva
tions, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive
labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civili
zation. They are being cared for in such a way, it
is hoped, to induce those still pursuing their old
habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which
is left them to avoid extermination.
I renew my recommendation that the public lands
be regarded as a heritage to our children, to be dis
posed of only as required for occupation and to
actual settlers. Those already granted have been in
great part disposed of in such a way as to secure ac
cess to the balance by the hardy settler who may
wish to avail himself of them. But caution should
be exercised even in attaining so desirable an object.
Educational interest may well be served by the
grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to
settlers. I do not wish to be understood as recom
mending in the least degree a curtailment of what
is being done by the General Government for the
encouragement of education.
The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
gives the operations of his department for the year.
As agriculture is the groundwork of our prosperity,
too much importance cannot be attached to the
labors of this Department. It is in the hands of an
able head, with able assistants, all zealously devoted
to introducing into the agricultural productions of
the nation ail useful products adapted to any of the
various climates ami soils of our vast territory, and
to giving all useful information as to the method of
cultivation, the plants, cereals and other products
adapted to particular localities. Quietly, but sure!-,
the Agricultural Bureau is working a great national
good, and if liberally supported, the more widely
its influence will be extended and the less dependent
we shall be upon t'ae products of foreign countries.
I have not given the estimates for the support of
the Government for the ensuing year, nor the com
parative statement between the expenditures for the
year just passed and the one just preceding, because
all these figures are contained in the accompanying
reports or in those presented directly to Congress.
These estimates have my approval.
More than six years having elapsed since the last
hostile gun was fired between the armies then ar-raj-cd
against each other, one for the perpetuation,
the other for the destruction of the Union; it may
well be considered whether it is now lime that the
disabilities imposed by the fourteenth amendment
should be removed. That amendment does not ex
clude the ballot, but only imposes the disability to
hold offices upon certain classes. 'When the purity
of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect
officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do
not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men
from office merely because they were, before the. re
bellion, of standing and character sufficient to be
elected to positions requiring them to take oaths to
support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility
those entertaining precisely the same views but of
less standing in their communities. It may be said
that the former violated an oath, while the latter
did not. The latter did not have it in their jKwer
to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be
doubted they would have broken it as did the former
class. If there are any great criminals, distinguished
above all others for the part they took in opposition
to the Government, they might," in the judgment of
Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty. This
subject is submitted for your careful consideration.
The condition of the Southern States is, unhap
pily, not such as all true, patriotic citizens would
like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake, per
sonal violence or threats toward persons entertain
ing political views opposed to those entertained by
the majority of the old citizens, prevent immigra
tion and tiie flow of much needed capital into the
States lately in rebellion. It wiil be a happy con
dition of the country when the old citizens of these
States will take an" interest in public affairs, pro
mulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men
representing their views, and tolerate the same free
dom of expression and ballot in those entertaining
different political convictions.
The number of immigrants, ignorant of our laws,
habits, &c, coming into our country annually has
become so great, and the impositions practiced ujhui
them so numerous and flagrant, that I suggest Con
gressional action for their protection. It seems to
inc a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I can
not now state as fully as I desire the nature of the
complaints mad" by immigrants of the treatment
they receive, but will endeavor to do so during the
sesdon of Congress, particularly if the subject should
receive your attention.
It has been the aim of the Administration to en
force honesty and effickney in all public officer.
Every public servant who has violated the trust
placed in him has been proceeded against with all
the rigor of the law. If bid ma havj secured
places it has been the fault of the system establish
ed by law and custom for making appropriations,
or tiie fault of thus; who recommend for Govern
ment positions persons not sufficiently well known
to them personalty, or who give letters indorsing
the characters of office-seekers without a proper
sense of the grave responsibility which sach a course
devolves upon them. A civil 'service reform which
can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercan
tile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of
recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain
creuitlrom a stranger is regarded as morally respon
sible for the integrity of his friend and his ability
to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which
would enforce tuis principle against all in iorsers of
persons for public place would insure great caution
ia making recommendations. A salutary lesson
ha been taught the careless and the dishonest pa'-
L.
lie servant in the great number of prosecutions and
convictions oi me las i jmio.
It is gratifying to notice the favorable change
which is taking place throughout the country in
bringing to punishment those who have proven re
creant to the trusts confided to them, and in ele
vating to public office none but those who possess
the confidence of the honest and the virtuous, who,
it will always be found, comprise the majority of the
community in which they live.
In my message to Congress one year ago I urgent
ly recommended a reform in the civil service of the
country. In conformity with that recommendation
Congress, ia the ninth section of "an act making ap
propriations for sundry civil expenses of the Gov
ernment and for other purposes," approved March
3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Execu
tive to inaugurate a civil service reform, and placed
upon him tlie responsibility of doing so. Under the
authority of said act I convened a board of gentle
men eminently qualified for tlie work, to devise
rules and regulations to effect the needed reform.
Their labors are not j-et complete, but it is believed
that they will succeed in devising a plan which can
be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the
heads of Departments, and members of Congress,
and which will redound to the true interest of the
public service. At all events the experiment shall
have a fair trial.
I have thus hastily summed up the operations of
the Government during the last year, and made such
suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your
consideration. I submit them with a confidence
that your combined action will be wise, statesman
like, "and ia the best interests of the whole country.
