The War with Spain Officially
Brought to a Close by the
Peace Commissioners.
THE CLOSE WAS A SCENE FOR A PAINTER.
TkS DocanMnt Wll Signed at 8:45 p. m., oa
the Nltbt of the 10th It Constats of
Seventeen Articles, Making 7,500 Words
The Spaniards were Badly Depressed
Over the Final Action.
Paris, Dec. 11. There were two
joint sessions of the peace commis
sion Saturday, one lasting from
3: SO p. m., to 5:15 p. m., and
the other opening at 7 p. in. The long
session in the afternoon and the sub
sequent recess were due only to the
iact that each article of the treaty had
to be carefully read and compared in
Spanish and English, and to the fact
that the engrossing of the last article
in Spanish was incomplete. During
the wait the commissioners were pho
tographed. The treaty was signed at 8:45 p. m.
A SCENE FOR A PAINTIXG.
1 The signing of the treaty would have
afforded a subject for a great historic
painting. The group gathered about
the table in the stately chamber of the
foreign office was impressive in itself,
while the fact that the sense of the
momentounness of the issues which
the act decided was deeply felt by all
the participants gave an impressive
and solemn tone to the scene. Around
the great mahogany table sat the ten
arbiters of the destinies of an old and
a young nation. Ranged, standing be
hind them, were numerous attaches of
the American commission. The jets
from the crystal chandeliers above the
heads of those present magnified the
brilliant green and scarlet of the up
holstering in their gaudiness. There
was the attraction of a contrast be
tween the black clothed actors and the
scenery.
i To the Americans it was a happy
ending of the epilogue of war; for the
Spaniards it was plainly a bitter trage
dy, none the less painful because long
foreseen. They sat silently, as though
almost crushed, and none could with
hold sympathy for Senor Montero
Jtios, the president of the Spanish com
mission, who, coming from his bed,
was bundled in a great overcoat,
though logs were burning in the fire
place near by. The spirits of the two
bodies were symbolized by the clothes
,worn by the members of the commis
sion, for the Americans were attired
In evening dress for the dinner given
them immediately after the meeting
by the Due d'Loubat, and the Span
iards wore black frock coats.
Although the commissions met at
3:30 o'clock, expecting to finish their
work in half an hour, the engrossing
of the treaty on parchment was found
to be so troublesome that it delayed
the signing of the document until
8:20 o'clock. Clerk Martin, of the
American commission, worked all day
without even stopping to eat. When
he came into the chamber at 7:30
with the document he found the com
missioners waiting. The Spanish
copy had arrived a half hour earlier.
ORDER OF SIGNATURES.
Mr. Arthur Ferguson then proceed
ed to read first the English, and after
that the Spanish, version of the
treaty. This finished, two copies
were passed around the table, the
commissioners signing them in the
order of their rank William R. Day,
Senator Cushman K. Davis, Senator
William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid and
Senator George Gray; Senor Montero
Rios, Senor Abarzuza, Senor Garnica,
Senor Villaurutia and Gen. Cerero y
Saons, each commission signing its
opponent's treaty, lioth were tied
with the Spanish and American col
ors. When the seals were affixed, at
tendants were sent scurrying for rib
bons of the French tri-color, with
which the documents were sealed, in
compliment to the French hosts of the
commission.
Many officials interested watched
every detail of the proceeding. The
last seal being impressed, the com
missioners rose, and, without formali
ty, each member shook the hands of
all his antagonists, and each gave as
surances of sincere personal esteem.
The Spaniards afterward comment
ed acridly upon what they termed the
bad taste of the Americans in muster
ing a crowd of attaches to gloat over
the consummation of their downfall
and to scramble for relics.
The signing was finished nt 8:45.
At that time the door of the chamber
opened.and Senor Villaurutia appeared
and exclaimed to a group of corre
spondents who were waiting in the
corridor: "C'Est FIni." The other
members of the Spanish commission
followed Senor Villaurutia and passed
silently through the vestibule to their
waiting carriages. The American com
mission strolled out, chatted compla
cently, and as the descended the"
steps the lights in the chamber were
darkened.
Bonus to Leave Ban Franetaco for Hong

Washington, Dec. 11. Naval Con
structor Hobson has been at the de
partment in connection with orders to
proceed to Hong Kong, to supervise
the reconstruction of the cruisers Don
Juan De Austria, Isla De Cuba and
Isla De Luzon. He desired a short
leave, but the department was com
pelled to refuse the request because of
the necessity of getting him to Hong
Kong as soon as possible. Mr. Hobson

The Pottery Syndicate Secure an Exten

Trenton. N. J.. Dec. 12. The ontion
secured by a syndicate of capitalists
on a large number of general ware
potteries in the United States, notablv
those of East Liverpool, O., and Tren
ton, baa been extended to April 1.
Trenton manufacturers are confident
the syndicate will succeed, and expect
the deal to be closed within a few
weeks. It is intimated that the ab

THE TIDE OF TRADE.
Soaad Money an I Good Crops Bare
Broag-ht an Era of Great
Prosperity.
Tha enormous orders which railroads
have placed for steel rails .are the
most significant illustrations of the
great revival In business in this coun
try since the election. The Iron Age,
the standard authority in the trade,
says in its current issue that no less
than 700,000 tons have been tiken this
week, which means prosperity for the
mills next year. This represents only a
part of the immense business that will
be done, for many roads have not yet
placed their orders, but are preparing
to do so. From excellent information
at hand the Age concludes that the
production will reach 2,000,000 tons in
1699. Three western railroads alone
have ordered 180,000 tons, one taking
75,000. Their orders for new cars are
on a similar scale, and altogether it
seems that the heavy purchasing which
the mills have been expecting from the
roads since the 1600 election has at last
begun.
The railroads are making the start in
the outlays which have been required
for a general revival of business. Soon
the other lines cf trade and manufac
tures will follow. Confidence that was
first restored in our currency and
financial institutions is now returning
in every direction. Railroads did not
buy rails heavily, though they needed
them, until they could be assured that
the return of good times would not be
checked by the danger of further sil
ver legislation, and they could tell that
the results of two good crops had given
the country a basis upon which it could
depend for freights outside of grain.
The same thing has been true in prac
tically nearly every other great line
of trade. Money was plenty atd credit
good, but the wheels of progress were
clogged until the road was cleared far
ahead. Last year thcreAvere fine crops,
high prices and a general winding up
of old debts, but people had not that
confidence in the future necessary to
buying operations which make not a
few lines of trade but a vhole country
busy and prosperous.
At last the swelling of the tide is
general, and it is so recognized in Eti-
rope as well as in America. Every line
of business Is becoming buoyant, with
few exceptions. The demand for labor
Is such that few men are unemployed
if they want work. Advertisements for
all sorts of help appear in the newspa
pers, to whose columns sucn announce
ments have long been strangers. Even
cotton manufacturing, to long oe
pressed, is now rallying, and soon will
be prosperous. It will follow the up
heaval in iron and steel, of which the
strongest indication is given in the im
mense railroad orders.
The country never was so rich, and
Its currency system has not for 0
years been so free from danger of at
tack. The first result of abundant funds
and the assurance that no revolution
was to be attempted in the monetary
standard has been a wild rush to place
Investments in bonds and fixed se
curities. What is coming now is the
withdrawal of money from bonds and
its employment in active trade. In
short, we are upon the eve of another
great era of development which will
discount that of 1S80-1890. Louisville
Courier-Journal (Dem.).
A GREAT TIME AHEAD.
nch a Season of Prosperity as
the World Sever Has
Known.
Never In the history of the American
people were their business affairs in
such promising condition as they are at
the present time. Wherever we look
the evidence of prosperity is found.
Our exports are phenomenally large
and there is every indication that they
will grow to even greater dimensions.
There was a time when we sold only
raw materials, but now our manufac
tured products are finding such favor in
the eyes of the world that our Eu
ropean rivals in trade have reason for
alarm. In a letter to the New York
World George Rutledge Gibson, refer
ring to this aspect of the question, says:
"As a result, we have at our command
an enormous international trade bal
ance which we can convert into gold at
any time, but we have what is more im
portant than that, a relief from the
gold drain to Europe, which for several
years threatened gold payments in this
country. While free silver men were
egitating their policy gold was fleeing
away and the very underpinning of our
gold standard was being withdrawn.
This process went on for some time in
conjunction with a treasury situation
which was weakened by monthly defi
cits. The whole economic drift has now
changed. We have so far this year im
ported $130,000,000 more gold than we
have exported, we have produced and
put into monetary circulation more
gold thau any year within 30 years, and
wc have at our beck and call millions of
European gold in the form of bills of
exchange carried by our bankers."
We continue to be the granary of the
world; populism, it is believed, is dis
appearing; the silver question no longer
excites serious alarm, though it will
continue to be agitated; this country
will not engage in war again for many
years. So everything is promising for
i uch a reason of prosperity as the world
never has known. Albany Journal.
The West on Sliver.
There is much of hopeful promise in
the views of Senator McBride, of Ore
gon, set forth through an interview
to wit: "The result in the west marks
the return to the raciflc coast states to
the republican column. Washington
and California have only followed the
excellent example that was set by Ore
gon last June, and I think are both
permanently with the republican party.
The west has been sharing splendidly
in the prosperity of President McKin
ley's administration and in the bene
fits of a protective tariff. This is one
of the causes of the revolt in the politi
cal views of Pacific coast voters. But
the farmers have been receiving excel
lent prices for their agricultural prod
ucts. Wheat, wool, hops and other
farm products have brought high
prices, and there has been a constant
demand. The farmers of Washington,
like those of Oregon, raise diversified
crops, and all these farmers have shared
in the good times. The election has
demonstrated that these farmers have
returned to the republican party, and
that others, impregnated with free sil
ver ideas, are disposed - to abandon
them." Washington Post.
HIS PLEDGES HOLD GOOD.
President McKinley Will Keep Kvrry
Promise Made at Bis
Election.
President McKInley's message to the
people of the west, delivered by H. H.
Hanna at the meeting of the New York
chamber of commerce a few days ago
Is an emphatic reiteration of his mes
sage to congress last year. "What
word," said Mr. Hanna on parting with
the president, "can I take back to the
people of the west regarding the cur
rency?" The president replied:
"Tell them 1 stand firmly for monetary
legislation, and that I am determined that
every pledge the republican party mada
along this line shall be kept."
Why is this message sent especially to
the west? Simply because, to the honor
of the west, it is here that the demand
for the fulfillment of the republican
pledges of 1S90 are most insistent. The
president has been reading the return!
from the west. He interprets correctly
the magnificent majority in Ohio to
mean an indorsement alike of the per
formances and promises of his adminis
tration. So, too, of the round plurality
of 69,000 in Illinois, 25,000 in Indiana,
74,000 in Michigan, 63,000 in Iowa, 30,000
In Wisconsin, and sound money gains
everywhere west to the Golden Gate
that opem outward to our island em
pire. The president makes no new prom
ises. Nor does he give any intimation
of favoring any of the currency reform
measures before the present congress.
He knows that no relief is possible in
that quarter. But from his message of
December 6, 1S97, we know that Presi
dent McKinley is committed to mone
tary measures that shall
-"1. Place the currency and obligations of
the United States on the gold basis by
statute.
"2. Impound redeemed greenbacks so that
they shall not be reissued except for gold.
thereby breaking the 'endless chain.
"3. Grant to national banks the right to
Issue notes to the face value of the bonds
which they deposit for circulation and re
duce the tax on such circulation to one-half
of one per cent."
There need be no caucusing of repub
lican leaders during the coming session
to unite upon these propositions. There
are not differences of opinion to be
reconciled about them. There is no
novelty or intricacy of system involved
in them. They stand forth as the ob
vious and self-evident means to secure
the gold standard, break the "endless
chain" of repeated redemption and give
greater elasticity to our currency.
No preliminary conference of party
leaders was necessary to the calling of
the extra session of 1897 for tariff re
form, and none is needed to adjust dif
ferences as to monetary reform before
the extra session. The divergence of
views as to national banking and cur
rency that cannot be brought together
in the discussion of the extra session
can be relegated to the regular session.
The people of the west send greeting
to Presidnt McKinley and beg to ex
press their confidence in his determina
tion to call an extra session of the Fifty
sixth congress in March that the re
publican party at the first opportunity
may keep its pledges of 189G and 1S98
in regard to monetary legislation.

WORK OF THE DINGLEY BILL.
Treasury Figures Show It Is
ntistakably a Revenue
Italser.
So nicely is the Dingley tariff work
ing that the author, or the man whose
name it bears, has no reason to hang
his head for shame, nor to feel hurt by
the jibes of mugwump and demo
cratic detractors. To make it clear,
note a few figures lately given out by
the treasury authorities.
In the first four months of the cur
rent fiscal year, which lxgan July 1,
the customs receipts have been by
months as follows:
July. 1F9S $lS.lR9.f
August l';.24!).t.iS
September K.'te.'JH
October la,uoo,2.(4
Total fC3,734,13
Average per month 35,u23,5il2
In these receipts are included te.i,
which may be called a war tax, but it
is so easily raised and produces rev
enue, the burden of which is justly and
lightly distributed, that it will in all
likelihood be long continued.
It will be seen that the averpge for
these four months is but a trifle less
than $16,000,000 a month, an average
which, if it holds out, will produce from
customs a s-um but a trifle short of
$200,000,000 per annum.
Now for a fair comparison. Under
the last straight fiscal year of the Wil
son tariff, ended .Tune 3D. 1S0G. the re
ceipts amounted to $100,021,751, and last
3ear, owing to anticipatory importa
tions to escape the new taxes, the re
ceipts were but $150.078, 75S.
All in all, republicans have no occa
sion to be ashamed of the work of their
hands. There may be crudities here
and there in the bill and slight changes
may be necessary, but taken as a whole
the bill will prove to be a revenue
raiser, with burdens justly and proper
ly distributed. Cincinnati Commercial
Tribune.

BUSINESS OF OCEAN DIVING.
Dangers of Descending Into the Dee
Are Lessened In These Me
chanical Days.
One of the best known of the divert
around New York harbor is Louis F,
Tiemmen. Although comparatively
young, he has had much experience be
neath the surface of salt waters. Mr.
Tiemmen said to a reporter:
"Much of the romance of the diving
business has been removed since I have
been in it. It used tw be thought that
the work under water had a tendency
to shorten a man's life. I suppose that
if a man had weak lungs the pressure
on the chest would cause him more or
less suffering and sooner or later com
pel him to give up the business alto
gether, but properly regulated and
carefully managed there is no more
danger in working under the water
than there is in working above it. In
fact, I do not think there is so much.
"The only danger lies in the men at
the ropes and the pumps and the possi
bilities of slipping down the hatchway
of a ship and drowning before you can
be pulled up. Getting out a cargo ia
one of the meanest jobs a diver has.
Generally two of them are sent down
together, and they have to work with
a great deal of care so that their pipes
and lines do not get mixed up and make
confusion above. Before the days ol
the electric light the diving business
was considerably more difficult than
now. When we went into the hold oi
a ship then we had to do practically
everything by feeling. It used to giv
one a bad shock, too, to grope around in
the water in the hold of a ship and sud
denly run across the body of some
poor devil of a sailor or a stowaway
who had been caught under the cargo.
Then, too, every communication had tc
be by signals. If a man at the rope, on
the raft or scow, misunderstood the sig
nal or forgot his code serious resulta
to the diver below might follow.
"Now, however, the diver has a lighl
with which to see what he is doing. He
need not fear the shock of running un
awares upon some human body. The
electric light will show at a consider
able distance through almost any kind
of water. The diver either can carry
it In his hand, just as a man who is
exploring in u cave woulu carry a light,
or he can wear it on the top of his hel
met as miners do their lamps. All that
he must look out for is that the wires
do not get tangled up with the ropes
and chains used in hoisting the various
objects found below to the surfac.
The diver nowadays also can have a
telephone attachment to his helmet
snd be at all times in constant com
munication with those who are run
ning the machinery, and, of course, enn
more readily direct them in their work
than he could in the old days when sig
nals had to be depended upon.
"Formerly, too, there was something
mysterious about the occupation of a
diver, but that has disappeared in a
great measure, owing, I suppose, to the
frequency with which they are em
ployed. There are a dozen men now
at work as divers where formerly only
one could be had. All the big wrecking
companies have a number of profes
sional divers In their employ. The na
vies of the United States and Great
Britain have their own divers, so, afte?
all, they are getting to be a rather com
mon class of employes. ' s ' a
FROM CHURCH TO CLOTHES.
There Is a Certain ( linrm In the Way
a Spanish AVomnn Pats on
Her Slantilln.
When a senora or senorita turns het
mind from the church it is to think of
clothes; in fact, the two thoughts often
ruu together, as there is much church
going in Spain.
The mantilla (pronounced as though
spelled marn-tealya), although a crown
ing distinction and distincthe mark of
1 Spanish women, is worn by ultra-fash-
ionable ladies only to the bull fights,
! theaters, annual fairs, to early mass
! and on summer evenings; not when
calling or shopping. Only old ladies
and unfashionable persons do not wear
bonnets.
The mantilla is an oblong piece of
lace measuring a yard and a half in
length and two-thirds of a yard in
width. The front and sides have a bor
der finish, while the bottom is trimmed
with a flounce a quarter of a yard deep,
which rounds up the side edges about
seven inches.
In order to hold this graceful lace the
hair must be piled high on the top of
the head. Place the front edge of the
XQantllla along the upper line of the
forehead, fasten to the hair with a pin.
lifter making sure that the ends are ex
actly even in length. With a hand a lit
tle above each ear, pinch the lace and
draw it back to the crown of the head,
where it is very slightly lapped and
fastened by another pin. The flounce,
which falls naturally about the shoul
ders, is caught in by the front ends and
pinned at the breast.'
If American ladies would only learn
how to arrange a mantilla it would cer
tainly become fashionable for the the
ater, as it Is so becoming. Spanish
women are traditionally fascinating.
Let any other woman who knows how
towenra passably becoming hat and has
only been considered "neat looking" or
"pleasant looking" wear a mantilla for
a trial, and people will change their
criticism to "charming," "lovely," etc.
It softens the face wonderfully. Doubt
all who protest that "only a Spanish
woman could arrange the thing" or
that "it is becoming to a certain style
alone;" believe that it only takes three
movements of the hands and three pins
to put on a mantilla. Harper's Bazar.
Too Much So.

"That's what he did," said Clarence;

Railroad Trains to Ran SioWaft
Railroad official claim that it is very ex
pensive to run their lightning express trains,
and are talking about reducing the speed. It
is likewise expensive to the health t rush
and straggle and compete in business affairs
as men do nowaday. The brain, the nerves,
the muscles, the whole svsteta Elves out. For
restoring strength after business worries,
uostetter s stomacn miters is me prujr
remedy. It is an ideal tonic for the tired, the
run-down and the weak.

DO YOU KNOW

Te L Randolphs
Cameron, Texas
wrote to Dr. Hayes in 1897 :
" I have rtot had Asthma sir.ee Hkirg
your treatment for six weeks in 1 893,
r.or have 1 had any symptoms of it."
Now here is a case of the most severe
type of
Asthma
which Dr. Hayes cured by the use of con
stitutional alteratives and tonics, and Mr.
Randolph has stayed cured for six years.
The idea that Asthma Is incurable because
physicians generally can do no more than
give temporary relief, is a most deplorable
error. The use of symptom drugs is so
universal, and their failure so inevitable,
that people are slow to believe that the dis
ease can be cured at all. But Dr. P. Harold
Hayes, of Buffalo, N. Y., quotes hundreds
and even thousands of cases from his prac
tice similar to the above.

this : it prevents their formation.
It has still other properties:
it will restore color to gray hair
in just ten times out of every
ten cases.
And it does even more: it
feeds and nourishes the roots
of the hair. Thin hair becomes
thick hair; and short hair be
comes long hair.
