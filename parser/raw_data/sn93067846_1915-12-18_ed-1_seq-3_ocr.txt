"And If I were a man. what woul:

"I reckon"?his words came with ar
icy coldness?"I d bo pretty liable tc
tell ye to eternally go to hell."
"And if 1 were a man," she promptly
retorted. "I'd endeavor with ever;,
ounce of manhood I had in me to see
that you and the others like you did
KO there. I'd try to see that you went
the appropriate way?through the
trap of the gallows."
She saw his attitude stiffen and his
face flush brick-red to the cheekbones.
But after a few teconds she heard him
speak with a fair counterfeit of amu .??
ment.
"Wall, it 'pears like we've both got
to be right smart disappointed?on ac?
count of your beln' a woman."
And this time it was she who
flushed.
"I don't hardly know why I'm tak?
ln' the trouble to mako any statement
to ye." Havey went on. "It ain't hard
ly worth While. Ye came up here with
your mind filed. Ye've read a lot of

"Before your own Judge and your
own Jury?" she naively asked him.
'That's tho way you usually have your
day in court, isn't it. Mr. Havey? '
"It's you that's'settln* as the court
Just now," he reminded her. "I red:
on ye ean judge for yerself how much
1 owns ye."
la spite of herself she smiled.
"I rather think I can," she admit?
ted. "Approdmntely, at least."
"I think I understand ye better
than ye do me," he went on slowly. "1
think ye're plumb honest in all the
notions ye fotched up here, despite
the fsct that most of 'em are wrong.
Ye've done come wltfi a heap of money
to teach folks what you 'low they'd
ought to know. Yo didn't know that
they'd ruther have Ignorance thai,

mighty Qod have gone in partners fer
the regeneration of theso mountains,
where no woman has ever been in

against thievery; where all we ask is
to bo left alone. I reckon every day
ye're wonderin' 'Is my halo on
straight?' It's nat'ral enough that ye
?hould be right scornful of a man that
some newspaper reporter has called a
murderer."
His voice fell away, and Juanita
heard again the beating of the ham?
mers out In the barn.
"Is that all?" she asked, but tho
man shook his head and stood there
looking down on her until under the
spill of his unusual eyes she f* It like
screaming out: "Talk if you Want to,
but for heaven's sake don't look at
me. I can't stand it'"
"Mebby ef yo'd stopped to think
shout things." he resumed, "yo'd have
seen that 1 didn't have no qua-rel wttS

have been able to help ye. I could

AUSTRIAN ADMIRALTY WILL NOT
DISAVOW SINKING OF
AN CON A.
N?V?I Authorities Approve Act of
Submarine Captain?Reply to
American Note to De Announced
Wednesday.
Vienna, Dee. 14 (Courier to Berlin,
Via London, Dee. 15).?The Austro
Hungarlan admiralty Ii entirely op?
posed to any disavowal of the course
of the submarine commander who was
responsible for sinking of the Italian
steamer Ancona. On the contrary, it
approves of his conduct fully and
declared that ho would have been'
considered as having failed to perform
his duty If he had allowed the Ancona
to escape.
The reply to the American note, it
is understood, will be delivered soon,
possibly Wednesday.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press has not been able to secure a
forecast of the terms of the reply,
but all indications are thar a pessi?
mistic view of the situation is jus?
tified.
The admiralty today stated its case
and attitude of the naval authorities
as follows:
"It Is a submarine commander's
duty* to make a report to the desig?
nated base B| soon as possible, and
the commander who sank the Ancona
did this as soon as he was within
wireless distance of land. He made a
supplementary report at Pola and ac?
companied it wih his log. No exam?
ination of the crew was held, because
the commander's report was consid?
ered complete and there was no rea?
son to suppose that the crew could
add anything thereto.
"So fur as th* commander is con?
cerned his course is clear. If the ad?
miralty had found that the command?
er has done anything contrary to his
instructions it would spontaneously
institute an investigation against him
without waiting for any 'emand to,
come from some foreign government,
It can happen that a commander in
heat of battle deals contrary to in?
struction, but nothing of the kind
has occurred in this case.
"It appears clearly from his re?
port that his ship was in danger, In?
deed, in double danger, first from the
fact that an enemy was approaching
on a line that threatened to cut off
his retreat and the enemy ship and
the Ancona could have escaped his
radius of action and could set a tor?
pedo boat flotilla on him, and, second,
there was danger of the Ancona es?
caping, which, according to his In?
structions, was to be prevented In all
circumstances. Hence the conduct of
the commander, much as the loss of
innocent lives must be regretted and
deplored, can not be disapproved.
"On the contrary, if he had de?
parted without destroying the An?
cona It would have been failure In
his duty since the Ancona could have
notified other ships of his where?
abouts. The loss of American lives
is regrettable, as well as that Ameri?
cans used a vessel belonging to a na?
tion at war with Austria-Hungary."
A naval writer and expert said to
the Associated Press correspondent
in a discussion on the demands of
tiie American note:
"It should be remembered that
Austria's fleet is her favorite child.
Its honor and prestige are treasured
to the highest degree. The govern?
ment might possibly yield points in
a matter affecting (he army, but dis?
avowal of an act of tin Austrian naval
oflicer is-* Jiu.rtlly tliinVci\>>lo in any out
extrem? case, Indeed, which could
justify In the eyes of all Austrians
any humiliation of a naval officer at
the behest Of a foreign power."
The American note relating to the
Ancona has not yet been published
by tiio Austrian newspapers, henee
i he contents of the note are known to
only a few of the most prominent otfi
Cials. One Of the leading men in
Vienna has summed up the situation
for the Associated Press as follows:
"My position requires me to keep
in close touch With public affairs.
There is no doubl whul r that sen?
timent is with us. Whether the
United States breaks oft relations
with Austria-Hungary rests entirely
with her.
"America could not injure us much
I
I more as an open enemy than she al
rcudy has done, she hau supplied mu?
nitions of war to our enemies and be?
yond doubt has prolonged the war,
which otherwise would be over long
since. < Mir diplomatic and consular
officers tnere have been shamelessly
harried and persecuted and have been
un ly Insulted by the press, The en
lente has recruited soldiers on Amer?
ican soil; submarines arc constructed
in American ship yards, it is true
111;11 only iarts arc mole ami taken
into Canada for assembling, but the
rcsull Is th" same. A great number
of Americans are fighting with the
Prench and British armies.
"We t*avc not been able to commu?
nicate with our nmbassador in cipher
because America forbids it, although
the American ambassador can cipher.
Our? side of. the case has not been
heard and distorted reports from our
enemies receive full credence.
"Now we have received a note
couched in terms never bfore ad?
dressed by one nation to another, a
note couched in terms of open insult.
America considers us bound by a
former warning delivered to Germany
regarding submarine warfare. That
note was hot communicated to u? and
can not be considered binding on us.
"Austria-Hungary is not an appen?
dix of Germany but a sovereign
state."
VIFAV OF ADMIRALTY FAILS TO
KXCITK.
Washington, Dec. 15.?While the
gravity of the situation existing be?
tween the United States and Austria
Hungary is emphasized by the state?
ment of the Austrian admiralty on
the action of the submarine com?
mander who sank the Ancona, offi?
cials said here tonight they were not
surprised at the admiralty supporting
its otlicer. It was pointed out that
the admiralty vigorously defended
the torpedoing of the Lusitania and
that the concessions made by Ger?
many to the United States in the
matter of her conduct of submarine
warfare were the work of the Berlin
foreign office.
Officials observed that the state?
ment reveals that the submarine
commander supplemented his first
report on the destruction of the An?
cona and turned in his log, thus ap?
parently disposing of reports that the
Vienna government was handicapped
in preparing an answer to the Amer?
ican note by inability to communicate
with the commander.
A reply from Austria is expected
before the end of the week, but no
word had been received tonight to
indicate just when it would arrive.
News and Views of Pisgah.
Pisgah, Dec, 1J.?Winter has come.
The fine and pretty Indian summer
that we had is a thing of the past.
No doubt it will be many years before
we see such another.
Very good stands of wheat and
oats are seen. The rain Saturday
night will bring up the late plantings.
During the rain Saturday night the
lightning Hashed and the thunder
roared something not often seen in a
cold December night.
I have heard it thunder In Jan?
uary when it was warm, but not in
December when it is cold.
Mr. Leon Stuckey of Statcburg has
purchased Rsv. T. L. Cole's place at
Pisgah church and has moved up.
He is* making improvements to his
house. We gladly welcome them to
our midst. Mrs. Stuckey is again on
her native heath.
Pisgah church has called a Mr.
Roton for next year. If he accepts he
will probably live at Mizpah church
and supply Mt. Olivet, Pisgah and
Mizpah churches as his field of la?
bor.
Rev. A. E. Fulman of Westville,
Kershaw county, has accepted Swift
Creek church and preaches there on
the 2nd and 4th Sundays in the after?
noon.
The many friends of Rev. J. P.
Attaway are pleased that he will re?
main another year in his present field
of labor. He is a fine man and preach?
er.
Christmas is nearly here and the
prospect is for a dull one.
Those who predicted that Germany
would plead for peace before Christ?
mas are up against it. If she has, I
have never heard of it, the wish was
father to the thought. Hope she will
wipe tlio Allies up.

Camden, Dec. 13.?Mrs. P. M.
Zemp died in a sanitarium near
Washington Saturday. She had been
in ill health for two years, but her
friends did not think that the end
was so near. Mrs. Zemp was Miss
Catherine DeLoache, only child of
James I. DeLoache of this city. She
was born July 2'J, 1 SO3, and spent a
happy girlhood in Camden. In Oc?
tober, 18S4, she was married to
Frank M. Zemp and they reared their
family in this their native town. A
lovely Chlrstlan character, she was
beloved by all who knew her. The,
remains were brought home for
burial and the funeral services were
held at the Methodist chureh Monday
morning, conducted by the Rev. C.
U. Smith. The floral offerings were
many and beautiful. She is survived

embassy received today from London
authorization to issue safe conduct
to ('apt. IJoy-Ed and ('apt. von Papon,
the withdrawn German naval and mil?
itary attaches. The sale. conducts
will be unconditional, it having been
decided by the allies not to require
the officers to give assurances that
they will refrain from participation
in the war aftfar reaching Germany.
GOIVS ACRE CLUB.
Hebron Church Has Successful Plan
for H?lsing Money for Missions.
Thirteen members of Hebron
church (Presbyterian) this year or?
ganized a club known as "The God's
Acre Club," the purpose of which was
to raise money for foreign missions.
The plan adopted by the club was to
set aside one acre each and on it grow
a crop for the mission fund. A ma?
jority of the members planted cotton
I on their acres, but other crops were
grown by others. On December 10th
a meeting was held at the church to
receive the reports of the club mem?
bers. The meeting was largely at?
tended, for there was great interest
manifested In the operations of the
club throughout the community, and
everyone was eager to learn the re?
sults of this novel method of raising
funds for the foreign mission work.
When the reports of the thirteen club
members had been tabulated it was
shown that $700 had been raised
from the sale of crops produced on
the thirteen acres. Some of the club
members turned in the gross receipts
from their acres, while others turned
in the net proceeds, deducting the ac?
tual cost of fertilizer and cultivation.
The results of the first year's oper?
ation of the club were so satisfactory
that the club was reorganized with an
increased membership for next year
and the proceeds from next year's
"God's Acres" will be devoted to the
foreign and home mission causes. Miss
Gertrude Dick was elected president
of the club.
The meeting was addressed by Itev.
L. L. Legters of Bishopville and Rev.
J. P. Marlon of Sumter.

caped with slight loss.
HIGH COTTON SEED.
Writing from Columbia, December
10, a special correspondent of Cotton
and Cotton Oil News (Dallas) says:
"Within the past two weeks I have
covered practically all the cotton mill
points in the Carolinas. Last week I
reported the cotton mills running full
time, some of them overtime and a
few of them night and day, with good
demand for their output at profitable
prices, while the oil mills all over the
belt were having a very bad year, be?
cause of the very high price of seed
this season.
I "Many of them told me they could
not possibly figure a profit on the seed
they were crushing, while some of the
smaller mills bad shut down and were
selling the seed they hud on hand to
tile fc>it? comi>;inies. The same condi
tliis week.
?'Well posted men figure South Car?
olina crop at probably 1,250,000. it
is practically all gathered. North Car?
olina's crop about same as last year."

ALLEGE CROOKED BUSINESS.
CONGRESSMAN TAVENNER SAYS
NAVY' LEAGUE AND NICKLE
TRUST ARE ALLIED.
Safs President of Defense Organiza?
tion is Cliairmaii of Trust and Con?
nected with Munition Manufactur?
ing Planta?Calls for Government
Control of Manufacture of Muni?
tions.
Washington, Dec. 15.?Allegations
connecting the Navy League and its
preparedness program with the In?
ternational Nickle Company and
other corporations manufacturing mu?
nitions were made in the house by
Congressman Tavenner, of Illinois.
He asserted that Col. Robert Thomp?
son, president of the Navy League, is
chairman of the directorate of the
Nickel company and that the direc?
torate of the United States Steel cor?
poration, the Utdvale Steel Company
an;*" other munition manufacturing
plants are interlocked with the direc?
torate of Thompson's company.
Among the directors of these allied
corporations are some of the most
liberal contributors to the Navy
League, declared Tavenner, whose
funds are used in "entertaining the
secretary of the navy and other offi?
cials." Tavenner urged the govern?
ment to control all munition manu?
facture.
CROPS GATHERED AT DALZELL.
Dalzell," Dec. 14.:?The crop is about
all gathered and a short one it is.
Cotton should bring a good price, if
supply has anv controlling influence.
With an eleven million bale crop, with
the surplus b. ought over from last
year, we have not anything extraor?
dinary and the world is bound to be
scarce of cotton before there is anoth?
er crop made.
The oat crop, which is a great es?
sential in farming, is about all in.
There is some yet to be sdwed, but not
very muoh. There is also a good deal
of wheat planted, which is an indica?
tion that so much flour will not have
to come from the west to supply the
demand next year.
Farmers are talking about the high
price of fertilizer and a good many
are somewhat at sea as to whether
they wit! buy the amount used hereto?
fore. Another short crop of cotton
will be a blessing to the South and
the prices now asked for fertilizers Is
another blessing in disguise. Some,
who claim to be informed, tell us that
the belligerent nations need cotton
and must have it for manufacturing
explosives and various other purposes,
so it looks to the average observer
that if the war continues for another
year or two and the South continues
to make short crops of cotton and
plenty of foodstuffs for man and1
beast, we will soor recover some of
our losses, which wt have sustained in
the past. Plenty of hog and hominy.,
winter cover crops and less commer?
cial fertilizer, with less land, time and
attention devoted to cotton spells a
mot e prosperous people. Such a pol?
icy should be the slogan of the South.
Germany now seems to be ready to
consider terms of peace, but the en?
tente Allies don't seem to be ready.
The sacrifices of life, money and prop?
erty has been astounding, and one
hundred thousand square miles Of ter?
ritory has been lost by the quadruple
entente, and it does seem reckless on
their part to want to keep up ?mch a
bloody strife. Servia is practically
lost and the invasion of Montenegro
m??ns that it soon will toe subjugated
?>y ? l,.^ ?-?.-,. ?..-.-. l Alimos. S.o. con?iaoi
ir?e these facts, and all other territory
the Gorman factions have With pow?
er to levy an extortionate tax lipon, to
be appropriated in prosecuting the
war, the outlook for the entente does
not appear particularly bright.
President Wilson's message to con?
gress the other day Is worthy of study
by every man of average intelligence.
Not only congress should ponder and
weigh it well, but the whole American
people should give It profound con?
sideration. Un pre pa redness, in case
of an attempt by some of the ereat
powers of Europe, to invade our coun?
try would put us in a helpless plight
and self-preservation being the first
law of nature, we should by all means
do all In our power to bo ready for
such an event, notwithstanding we
are a peace-loving people. A com?
mercial marine is another important
factor that this country needs as bad
as anything else in building up her
interest as a progressive nation. The
president said the other day that it
had been shamefully neglected. That
is no new Information to the Ameri?
can people. When this country reach?
es that stage, where she can do her
own shipping, or a greater per cent,
of it. new fields of trade will open up,
and rates of transportation will bo
less, which, of course, will be a valu?
able asset tt) the shippers of this
country, and the producer having to
bear all burdens of freight on his
product, will share in the reduction.
Stich improvement in conditions is
what this country sorely needs.
