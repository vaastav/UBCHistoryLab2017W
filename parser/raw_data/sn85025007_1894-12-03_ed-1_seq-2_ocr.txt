MONDAY EVENING, DEC. 3, 1894.
What will Archbishop Ireland,
who sees no danger to his church or
the members thereof in the A. P. A.,
say when he reads that a Protestant,
who had previously filled an office sat?
isfactorily in Allegheny City, Pennsyl?
vania, has been defeated for re-election
by the A. P. A., for the avowed reason
that his wife, to whom he was recently
married, is a member of the Catholic
Church? The more Archbishop Ireland
talks the worse for him. He now says
he did not come East to make republi?
can speeches and get money. Mr. De
pew agrees with him about the speeches
?though he did make them, as every
body knows?but acknowledges that he
got money, nearly half a million, and
other people say the most of it came
from the New York syndicate to whom
the whole of the recent profitable gold
bond issue was awarded. Politics, like
pots, blacken those who handle them ;
therefore the least preachers have to
do with them, the better for the
churches to which they belong. If this
be true of all preachers, especially is it
so of those high in authority in their
respective churches.
A Georgia judge last week, in sen?
tencing to death a negro man convict?
ed of outraging a white woman, said,
"If the judges of the courts would call
special sessions and give speedy trials
to persons accused of suebjerimes, there
would be fewer lynchings. The slow?
ness of the courts in administering jus?
tice is largely responsible for the people
taking the law into their own hands."
The judge spoke the truth, and if bis
wise advice be taken, and such crimi?
nals as ho referred to be tried, convict?
ed and hanged ou the day of their ar?
rest, lynching would soon be a lost art
in the South.
The equality of race and sex, in the
effort to promote which some people in
this country are now employed, isglari
iugly exhibited by show bills, in some of
the Northern cities.representiog a negro
man and a white woman in the cos?
tume of the "ring" and just about to
engage in a prize fight. Yes, "we are
are coming, Father Abraham, a hun?
dred thousand strong." But in a coun?
try in which negro men must be ap?
pointed to office on account of their
color, and white women, on account of
their sex, objection to their having
prize fights with each other is absurd.
as the election law is all right, and
as the jury system for trying petty of?
fenses has been in operation for many
years, and can therefore be submitted
to another year without as much ex?
pense as would be incurred by an ex?
tra session of the Legislature, the State
cau well afford to wait until the regular
session of that body, which will com?
mence next December, and the Gov?
ernor would do himself no good by
convening one any earlier.
A Baltimore paper says ex-Govern?
or Bowie, who was stricken with pa?
ralysis some days ago, is kept alive by
his "will power." This is as wise as
the assertion of some other newspapers
in respect of ill people, that they are
"fighting with death." Illness renders
"will power" as inaffective as a "fight,"
and nature effectually prevents a re?
sort to either. When a man is really
sick he lies still and waits for what fate
has in store for him.
Threatened governments, like
threatened men, live long. Revolu?
tion nearly always comes suddenly.
Captain Kolb has been threatening the
government of Alabama for the last
three months, but when the appointed
day came, he was as mild mannered as
uny right thinking man could desire,
and when ordered ofl the Capitol
grounds by the Governor, he obeyed and
withdrew at once, and without a mur?
mur. _
The fact, as previously stated in the
Gazette, that a large number of the
members of the present Congress tried
to rob the government by attempting
to draw their mileage,, though intend?
ing to remain at home, tends neither to
prove that the voice of the men who
elected them was the voice of God, or
that reliance can be placed upon popu?
lar government. This may be seditious,
but it is true.
Now that the moral busy body wom?
en have stopped the exhibition of "liv?
ing pictures" ou the stage at theatres,
their next attempt will be to have the
gowns of there sex among the audi
ence cut to suit their ideas, and not
those of the wearers. Having no
charms of their own to expose they are
keen set upon preventing those to
whom nature has been kiuder from
showing theirs.
As the republicans will have control
of the lower branch of the next Con?
gress they are clamoring for a change
in the Constitution by which congress?
men elected in November shall take
their seats in the following December,
and not, as now, a year later. If vox !
populi be vox Doi their proposed change j
should unquestionably be made; but it
is characteristic of them that they
never saw the wisdom of iL until now.
The "reformers" of New York are
having a regular monkey and parrot
time of it. Rev. Dr. Parkhurst is de?
nouncing Mr. Plait, and Rev. Dr. Dix
on is denouncing Dr. Parkhursi; and so
it goes, as was expected. Political re?
form is utterly impracticable where
every body has the privilege of voting.
Where all have a right 10 pie. every
man wants some of it, and will light or
do worse for his share.
The North Carolina republicans now
propose to grab both the U. S. Senators
from that State, ?nd tell their allies,
the populists, to whistle for theirs.
This would not only gee with Rob
Roy's idea, according to Wordsworth,
that might makes right, but would
serve the populists exactly right, as they
have all the bad qualities of the repub?
licans, without the lalter's moral cour?
age. _____________
The session of Congress that com?
menced to-day, leaving out Sundays,
can only last seventy-seven days, after
which there will be a surcease of con?
gressional legislation for nine months.
In view of the benefits of the long re?
cess, the sufl'crirjg people can all'ord to
bear the evils of the short session.
FROM WASHINGTON.
[Correspondence of tho Alexandria Gazette.]
Washington, Dec. 3, 1S94.
The last session of the 53.1 Congress
convened at noon to-dn}'. There was
a pretty full attendance of members in
both bodies, and while the number of
spectators was large, it was not as
large as usual. Several foreign govern?
ments had representatives in the diplo?
matic galleries, but the President was
so little interested in the proceedings
that ihe White House pews in neither
house bad a siugle occupant. The
desks of many of the members of both
houses were ornamented with flowers,
the most conspicuous in the House be
n; thatof Mr. Linton of Michigan,upon
which was a large flower representa?
tion of a school house, the preseut of
the A. P. A. of this city, for tho Ameri?
can Protective Association speech he
made at the la3t session; and in the
Senate, that of Mr. Smith, a shield of
11 >wers, for his protective speech last
summer. The desk of ex- aud to be
Speaker Reed had upon it a flower
ship, like that presented to the late
Senator Reu Hill of Georgia by the la?
dies of Alexandria, a miuiature ?. S.
flag flying from every mast. On the
desk of Representative Swauson of Yii
c,ioia lay a large and beautiful bunch < f
red roses, aud on that of Mr. Meredith,
some grateful women for whom be had
obtained a poorly paid place in the
government printing oflice had placed
as h t offeriug a few yellow ro^es that
had cost her more than a whole day's
wages. When Mr. Reed entered the
chamber he was received with loud ap
plause, as was Mr. Speaker Crisp ai:d
Chairman Wilson. Of the Virginia
delegation, both the Senators were
present, and Representatives Jones.
Tyler, Swanson, Turner, Meredith and
Marshall. The litter said General
Walker's majority in his district was
the result of stay-at-home democrats
and the combination of tue republican
and populist vote, which was 700 less
than the separate vote of those parties
last year. Mr. Marshall, when his
hand was shaken by one of those saved
f-om the general wreck, said,'These
are those that have come up through
great tribulations."
Commonwealth's Attorney Marbury
and Corporation Court Clerk Beach, of
Alexandria, called on Congressman
Meredith at the Capitol to-day in the
interest of some Alexandrians who are
applicants for places in the govern
ment printing office. About a hundred
other people from the Sth Virginia dis?
trict met Mr. Meredith at the depot on
his arrival, all of whom besought him
to get them places. Mr. Meredith will
return to Manassas every evening until
the first of January.
Mr. McCaull, the defeated candidate
for Congress in the Alexandria district,
says it is absurd to tell him that Fau
quier county gave Mr. Meredith nine
hundred majority, that in the town of
Culpeper, where the election was fair,
be got a majority; but in the county
districts of that county, where the re?
verse was the case, he was swamped.
In Alexandria, he says, with a fair elec?
tion, he knows he would get a majority.
Ho says, however, that .unless he can
prove that he was fairly elected he will
not make a contest, and will give Mr.
Meredith the benefit of the doubt.
Mr. Bartlett introduced the first bill
of the session in the House to-day.
It provided simply for the repeal of
the income tax.
The President spent to-day at the
White House, but he will not give up
Woodley as a residence for several days
yet.
As a result of the arrest of the offi
cials of the Fidelity Building, Loan and
Investment Association at Pittsburg re?
cently, a bill in equity was filed in the
District Supreme Court to-day by Isa?
bel Smith, et al., stockholders of the
association, praying for the appoint?
ment of a receiver, and an injunction to |
restrain tho officers of the association 1
from disposing of any of its" effects!
before the court has decided upon the
matter. The petitioners recite that the
association was incorporated under the
laws of Virginia, aud has its main office
in Washington, D. C, with branch of- i
fices in Maryland, Virginia, West Vir- j
ginia and Pennsylvania.
The most noticeable parts of the j
President's message are bis recommen?
dation of ibe extension of the civil ser?
vice reform humbug; for the removal of
the duty on coal and iron, but only
that on such sugar as is imported from
countries payingfa bounty on its export;
for free ships; his determination to con?
tinue the issue of bonds to keep up the
gold supply, unless prohibited; and his }
endorsement of the proposition, to re?
move the tax from State bank circula?
tion.
The Supreme Court to-dav announced its
unanimous belief that as between an Associ?
ate Justice of that bench and the judge of a
district court of the United States, the former
ii the ranking official.
Judge Wilkerson, of the Birmingham
(Ala) City Court, bas dissolved the in?
junction obtained by certain stock?
holders in the Alabama Great Southern
Railroad favorable to the incorporation
of the road into the Southern system.
The decision is regarded as a victory
for the interest favorable to control of
the road by Cincinnati, Hamilton and
Dayton Company.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland sent his annual
message to Congress to-day. The fol?
lowing are the salient points:
The history of our recent dealings
with other uatious, aud our peaceful
relatious with them at this time, ad?
ditionally demonstrate the advantage
of consistently cdherinn to a iirui but
just foreign policy, free from envious or
ambitious schemes and characterized by
entire honesty and sincerity.
Although the war between China and
Japan endangers uo policy of the United
S.ates, I felt constrained at the begin?
ning of the controversy to tender our
good offices to induce amicable arrange?
ment of the initial difficulty growing
out ot the Japanese demands for ad?
ministrative reforms in Korea; but tho
uuhappy precipitation of actual hostil?
ities defeated this kindly purpose.
Auxious that our commercial interests
in those countries may be preserved
aud that the safety of our citizens there
shall not be jeopardized, I would not
hesitate to heed any intimation that
our friendly aid for the honorable ter?
mination of hostilities would be accept?
able to both belligerents.
In recognition of the long and dis?
tinguished military services and faith?
ful discbarge of delicate aud responsible
civil duties by Major-General John M.
Schofield, now the general commanding
the army, it is suggested to Congress
that the temporary revival of the grade
of lieutenant general in his behalf would
be a just and gracious act.
The stagnation of promotion in the
navy is so great as to seriously impair
its efficiency. I consider it of the ut?
most importance that the young and
middle aged officers should, before the
eve of retirement, be permitted to
reach a grade entitliug them to active
aud important duty.
The system adopted a few years ago
regulating the employment of labor at
the navy yards is rigidly upheld aud
has fully demonstrated its usefulness
and expediency. It is within the do?
main of civil service reform inasmuch
as workmen are employed through a
board of labor selected at each navy
yard, and are given worlr. without ref?
erence to politics and in the order of
th-ir application, preference, however,
oeing given to army and navy veterans
and those having former navy yard ex?
perience.
Through the operation of this
rule, the work at our navy yards has
b^eu vastly improvod iu efficiency.
It is hoped that if this system continues
to be strictly adhered to there will
soon be as a natural consequence such
an equalization of party benefit as will
remove all temptation to relax or aban
don it.
The barefaced and extensive pension
frauds exposed under the direction ol
the courageous and generous veteran
soldier now at the head of the bureau
leave no room for the claim that no
purgation of our pension rolls was
needed, or that continued vigilance
and prompt action are not necessary to
the samp end.
Tb? : . untages to the public service
of mi adherence to tho principles of
civil service reform are constantly
more apparent; and nothing is so en?
couraging to those in official life who
honestly desire good government as
the increasing appreciation by our peo
pie of these advantages. A vast ma?
jority of the voters of the land are
ready to insist that the time and atten?
tion of those they select to perform for
them important public duties should
not be distracted by doling out minor
offices, arid they are growing to be
unanimous regarding party organiza?
tion as something that should be used
iu establishing party principles instead
of dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards of partisan activity.
Numerous additional offices and places
have lately been brought within "civil ser
vice rules and regulations and some
others will probably soon be iucludcd.
I earnestly recommend the inaugura?
tion of a national board of health or
similar national instrumentality, be?
lieving the same to bo a needed pre?
caution against contagious disease and
in the interest of the safety and health
of our people.
Such ameliorations of present con?
ditions of what is called the Indian
problem ought not to be neglected. I
am satisfied there should be a federal
court established for the territory and
that, this court shouid have the same
jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as is
now vested in the federal courts sitting
in Arkansis and Texas.
A sul ject of pressing moment refen ed
to by the attorney-general is the re?
organization of the Union Pacific rail?
way company on a basis equitable as
regards all private interests and as
favorable to the government as exist?
ing conditions will permit. The opera?
tion of a railroad by a court through a
receiver is an anomalous state of things
which should bo terminated on all
grounds, public and private, at the
earliest possible moment.
I concur in the opinion of the Secre?
tary of the Interior that the commis?
sioner of the general land office should
be relieved from the duty of deciding
litigated land cases; that a non-partisan
court should be created to pass on such
cases and that the decisions of this
court should be final, at least so far as
the decisions of the department are now
final;
J ? The tariff act passed at the last ses?
sion of the Congress needs important
amendments if it is to be executed ef?
fectively and with certainty. In addi?
tion to such necessary amendments es
will not change rates of duty, I am still
very decidedly in favor of putting coal
and iron upon the free list. So far as
the sugar schedule is concerned, I would
be glad.under existing aggravations, to
see every particle of diuerential duty
in favor of refined sugar stricken out of
our tariff law. If with all the favor
now accorded the sugar refining inter?
est in our tariff laws it still languishes
to the extent of closed refineries
and thousands of discharged workmen,
it would seem to present a hopeless case
for reasonable legislative aid. What?
ever else is done or omitted I earnestly
recommend that the additional duty of
one-tenth of a cent per pound,laid upon
sugar imported from countries paying a
bounty on its export, be abrogated. It
seems to me that exceedingly important
considerations point to the propriety of
this amendment.
With the advent of a new tariff poli
? cy not only calculated to relieve the
consumers of our land in the cost of
their daily life, but to invite a better
development of American thrift and
create for us closer and moro profitable
commercial relations with the rest of the
world.it follows as a logical and impera?
tive o< -essity that we should at once
remove the chief, if not the only, obsta?
cle which has so long prevented our
participation in the foreign carrying
trade of the sea. Our new tariff policy,
built upon the theory that it is well to
encourage such importations as our
j ptople need, and that our produc s an<l
; manufactures should Hud markets in
j every part of the habitable globe is
j consistently supplement ed by the great
j est possible libeity to our citizeus
i in the owoership and navigation of
j ships in which our products and
manufactures may be transported.
The ancient provision of our law deny?
ing American registry to ships built
abioad and owned by Americans ap
I pears in the light of present conditions
j not only to be a failure for good at
I every point, but to be nearer a relic of
! barbarism thau any thing that exists
I under the permission of a statute of the
j United States. I earnestly recommend
; its prompt repeal.
: During the last month the gold re
j served in the Treasury for the purpose
i of redeeming the notes of the govern -
j ment circulating as money in the hauds
of the people became so reduced, and
its further depletion in the near future
seemed so certain, that in the exercise
of proper care for the public welfare it
became necessary to replenish this re?
serve and thus maintain popular faith
in the ability and determination of the
government to meet, as agreed, its pe?
cuniary obligations. It would have
been well if in this emergency authority
had existed to issue the bonds of the
government bearing a low rate of inter?
est and maturing within a short period.
But the Congress having failed to con?
fer such authority resort was necessarily
had to the resumption act of l$7?, and
i pursuant to its provisions bonds were
issued drawing interest at the rate of o
per cent, per annum and maturing teu
years alter their issue, thai being the
shortest time authorized by the act. I
am glad to say, however, that on the
sale of these bonds the premium re?
ceived operated to reduce the rate of
interest to be paid by the government
I to less than three per cent.
Nothing could be worse or further
j removed from sensible finance than the
j relations existing between the currency
I the government has issued, the gold
j held for its redemption and the means
which must be resorted to for the pur?
pose of replenishing such redemption
fund, when impaired. Even if the
claims upon this fund were confined to
the obligations originally intended, and
if the redemption of these obligations
meant their cancellation, the fund
would be very small. But these obli
gations when received and redeemed in
gold are not cancelled but are re-issued
and may do duty many times by way
of drawing gold from the Treasury.
Tints wo have an endless chain in ope
ration constantly depleting the Treas?
ury's gold aud never near a final rest.
As if this were not bad enough w<
have by a statutory declaration that
it is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between gold
and silver, aided the force aud momen
tum of this exhausting process, and
added largely to the currency obliga?
tions claiming this peculiar gold re?
demption. Our small gold reserve is
thus subject to drain from every side.
The demands that increase our dauger
:iI=o increase the necessity ol protecting
this reserve against depletion, and it is
most unsatisfactory to know that the
protection afforded is only a temporary
palliation. It is perfectly and palpabh
plain that the only way under present
conditions by which this reserve when
dangerously dep'e'.ed on be replenish?
ed is through the issue and sale of the
bonds of the government for gold : and
yet Congress has not only thus far de?
clined to authorize the issue of bonds
best suited to such a purpose, but there
seems a disposition in some quarters to
deny both the necessity and power for
the issue of bonds at all. As long
therefore as no provision is made for
the final redemption or the putting
aside of the currency obligation now
used to repeatedly and constantly draw
from the government its gold, and as
long as no better authority for bond is?
sues is allowed than at present exists,
such authority will be utilized when?
ever and as often as it becomes neces?
sary to maintain a sufficient gold re?
serve and in abundent time to save the
credit of our country aud make good
the financial declarations of our gov?
ernment.
Questions relating to our banks and
currency arc closely connected with
the subject just referred to aud they
also present some unsatisfactory fea?
tures. The Secretary of the Treasury
presents in his report a scheme
modifying present banking laws
and providing for the issue of
circulating notes by State banks free
from taxation uuder certain limitations.?
The secretary explains his plan so
plainly that I shall content myself with
an unqualified endorsement of the sec?
retary's' proposed changes in the law
and a brief and imnerfect statement
of their prominent features: It is
proposed to repeal all laws provid?
ing for the deposit of U. S. bonds as
security for circulation; to permit
national banks to issue circulating notes
not exceeding in amount 75 per cent,
of their paid up and unimpaired capital
provided they deposit with the govern?
ment, as a guarantee fund, in U. S.
legal tender notes, including treasury
notes of 1S0O, a sum equal in amount to
30 per cent, of the notes they desire to
issue, this deposit to be maintained at
all times, but whenever any bank re?
tires any part of its circulation
a proportional part of its guar?
antee fund sh: II be returned to
it; to permit the secretary of
the treasury to preparo and keep on
hand ready for issue in cu?e an increas)
in circulation is desired blank national
bank notes for each bank having cir?
culation and to repeal the provisions
of the present law imposing limitations
and restrictions upon banks desiring to'
reduce or increase their circulation?
thus permitting such increase or reduc?
tion within the limit of seventy-five per
cent, of capital to be quickly made as
emergencies arise. In addition to the
guarantee fuud required, it is proposed
to provide a safety fund for the im?
mediate redemption of the circulating
notes of failed banks, by imposing
a small annual tax, say one-half
of one per cent, upon the average circu?
lation of each bank until the fund
amounts to five per cent, of the total cir?
culation outstanding. When a bank fails
its guarantee fund is to be paid into this
safety fund, aud its notes are to be re?
deemed in the first instance from such
safety fund thus augmented,?any im?
pairment of such fund caused thereby
to be made good from the immediately
available cash assets of said bank, and.
if these should be insufficient such im?
pairment to he made good by pro rata
assessments among other banks, their
contributions constituting a first lien
upon the assets of the failed bank in
favor of the contributing banks.. As a
further security it is contemplated that
the existing provision fixing the i jdivid
ual liability of stockholders is to be
retained and the bank's indebtedness on
account of its circulating notes is to be !
made a first lien on all its assets. For I
the purpose of meeting the expense of \
printing notes, official supervision, can-1
; collation *nd other charges, there shall
i be imposed a i ax of s?y one half of one
j per cent, pir annum upon the average
j amount of notes in circulation. It is
i further provided tha', there shall be no
; national bank notes issued of
loss denomination than ten dollais;
that eacn national bank, except in cas<_
of a failed bank, shall redeem or retire
its notes in the first instance at its own
ollice, or at agencies to be designated
by it, and that no fixed reserve need
be maintained on account of deposits.
Another very important feature of
this plan is the exemption of State
banks from taxation by tho United
States, in cases where it is shown to the
satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury and Comptroller of the Cur?
rency by banks claiming such exemp?
tion" that they have not had out?
standing their circulating notes exceed?
ing 75 per cent, of their paid up and
unimpaired capital; that their stock?
holders are individually liable for the
redemption of their circulating notes to
the lull extent of their owner?
ship of stock; that the liabilitv
of said lanks upon their circu
lating notes constitutes under their
State law a first lien upon their
assets; that such banks have kept and
maintained a guarantee fund in United
States legal tender notes including
treasury notes of ISSN) equal to thirty
per cent, of their outstanding circulat?
ing notes when presented at their prin?
cipal or branch offices. It is quite
likely that this scheme may be usefully
amended in some of its details, but I
am satisfied it furnishes a basis for a
very threat improvement in our present
banking and currency system.
I conclude this communicition fully
appreciating that the responsibility for
all legislation affecting the people of the
United States rests upon their repre?
sentatives in the Congress, and assur?
ing them that, whether iu accordauce
with recommendations I have made
or not, I shall be glad to co-operate in
perfecting any legislation that tends to
the prosperity and welfare of our coun?
try. _ _
FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 3.
senate.
The proceedings were opened by
p nyer from the blind chaplain^Mr
M Iburn. He returned thanks to the
Amvghty that through tho recess the
angel of death had not touched any
Senators and that the homes of Sena?
tors had beeu safe from that angel's
presence. Aud he especially commend
ed to the Divine goodness the Vice
President and the members of his fam?
ily. He gave thanks that that home
had been saved, and prayed that the
beloved daughter of the house should
be speedily restored to health and
soundness.
The usual resolutions fixing the hour?
ly meeting at noon, directing the secre?
tary to inform the House of Represen?
tatives that a quorum of the Senate had
assembled and for the appointment of a
committee of two to join a like commit?
tee on the part of the House to wait
upon the President aud inform him that
Congress was ready to receive any com
munication he might be pleased to
make, were offered and agreed to, and
Senators Harris and Mandersou were
appointed such committee on the part
of the Senate. Then the roll of Sena?
tors was called and sixty-nine Senators
answered to their names. After the
roll call a brief recess was taken. There
was some delay in the receipt of the
message from the House announcing
the appointment of a committee to wait
upon the President, and after it was
received, a further recess was taken
till 1-30 p. m..
After t he long recess a report was
n ade by Mr. Harris, from the commit?
tee to wait on the President, and im?
mediately thereafter, one of the Presi?
dent's secretaries delivered the Presi?
dent's annual message, which was
thereupon read by the secretary of the
Senate,
house.
There were many absentees, but not
so many as to cause any doubt about
the presence of a quorum.
There was quiet while the chaplain
delivered his opening prayer, but only
I for that short period. When he bad
finished the hum of voices was resum?
ed, and it rose to a height that made it
exceedingly difficult to hear the calling
of the roll, which followed the prayer.
It was during the progress of tho roll
call that the man entered who divided
with the leaders the interest of the
spectators. He was not greeted with
applause, but a fluttering in the gal?
leries told that he was a personage to
be noticed. People leaned forward
from their elevated seats as Mr. Breck
inridge, of Kentucky, came in. He
looked as debonaire as ever. His
silvery beard was closer trimmed than
usual and bis long locks had been
shorn. He walked down the aisle lead?
ing to bis seat, smiling and bowing and
shaking hands with the members on
each side of the passageway.
At 12:22 the roll call was completed
and Speaker Crisp reported that 210
members?more than a quorum?were
present. Many more members appear?
ed and increased the total. Messrs.
Wilson, of We3t Virginia; Holman, of
Indiana, and Reed, of Maine, were ap?
pointed a committee on behalf of the
House, to wait upon the President and
notify him that the House had assem?
bled and was ready to receive any mes?
sage he might send. The committee
immediately left the House to join Sen?
ators Harris and Manderson, the Sen?
ate committee.
At 11:33 p. m., on motion of Mr. Say
ers the House took a recess until one
o'clock.
It was 1:37 before one of the Presi?
dent's secretaries appeared and deliv?
ered the President's annual message,
aod instantly the House was stilled.1
As Clerk Kerr began the reading of the '
document nearly all the members were !
in their seats and the attention given ;
was something remarkable.
