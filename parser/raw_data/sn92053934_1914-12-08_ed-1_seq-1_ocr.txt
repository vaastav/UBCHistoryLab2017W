ODD FELLOWS TO

Churches Each Sunday
Beginning Dec. 27.
The Odd Fellows of the city have
originated a plan whereby the various
churches of Rock Island are to be vis

will start Sunday. Dec. 27. whea the
members of the great secret order will

that a closer relationship between the
two will naturally result.

Legislative Program Has
Been About Completed,
He Tells Congress.
HONESTY IS DEMANDED
President Applauded as He Re
iterates His Stand for
Peace-Loving Nation.
(The full text of President Wilson's
message, personally read before a
joint meeting of both branches of con
gress today, is printed on page three
of this issue. Editor The Argus).
Washington, D. C, Dec. S. Presi
dent Wilson departed from the pre
pared text of his annual address to
congress today, which was devoted
principally to answering those who
contend that the United States is un
prepared for national defense, to give
notice to the business world that the
legislative program of the administra
tion, as it affects the regulation of
business, was practically completed.
He said it had resulted in a clear road
to "unclouded success."
Honest business men, the president
declared, need to have nothing to fear
in treading the way outlined in the
trust and currency bills. His words
were interpreted to mean no further
important business legislation was
contemplated.
The galleries were packed. The
president entered the chamber at
12:30. A moment later he began read
ing his address. His voice was a trifle
husky.
The democratic side of the chamber
applauded loudly when the president,
discussing national defense, declared
the country would ever be ready, in
time of peace, to put in the field a
nation of men trained to arms." An
other outburst greeted a declaration
against compulsory military servicer"
"We are champions of peace and
concord," said the president. Again
the democratic side applauded, and
clapping frequently interrupted the
president's argument that the United
States should preserve its reputation
as a peace-loving nation and his con
clusion that it should never "have a
large standing army." Applause from
both sides of the chamber greeted the
president's announcement for national
defense, "a citizenry trained to arms,"
when he declared: "We will not
change our attitude toward national
defense because some among us are
nervous and excited." Outbursts of
applause and laughter interrupted him
nearly every minute. He concluded
his address at 1:10.
Military Lobby on Job.
President Wilson told callers today
he favored disclosure of all facts con
nected with the preparedness of the
United States for national defense and
believed while the subject should be
discussed as fully as possible, the
whole question hinged on the method
cf investigation. The commission
plan proposed by Representative Gard
ner he disapproves. The president
said he had no especial knowledge of
the existence of any lobby for stirring
up military discussion at this time,
but intimated he believed there was
such an organized effort. He declares
his correspondence shows widespread
opposition to any efforts to involve
the United States in a militarist move
ment. The president refused to say
whether he believed partisanship en
tered into efforts to investigate- the
question.
Laugh on Senator Smith.
The president said he did not expect
the administration legislative program
would necessitate an extra session cf
congress after March 4. The presi
dent laughed when a report was
brought to his attention that Senator
Smith of Michigan had said the evac
uation of Vera Cruz was caused by an
ultimatum from Carranza giving the
United States 24 hours to withdraw
troops. The president said it was use
less to comment on the report.

C F. ("Barney") Bertsche Uop) and
State's Attorney Hoyne.
Chicago, Dec. 8. Stories of police
graft told here before a grand jury
by C. F. ("Barney") Bertsche, king
of the clairvoyant trust, and some ot
his associates probably will result in
the indictment of 30 members ot
Chicago's police force. Among those
who have already been indicted as a
result of the clairvoyants' disclosure
are Captain John J. Halpin, Lieuten
and John H. Tobin and Detectives
William Egan and John Dempsey.
"Bertsche's story is the most as
tounding thing I have heard in
years," said District Attorney Mac
lay Hoyne, who is in charge of the
grand jury investigation. " He has
been dealing with the police for
years and what he told the present
grand jury is only a small part of all
he has to say. The next grand Jury
wiRhear more,' and I expect further
indictments." " -Bertsche
in hi3 story to the grand
Jury told of an agreement he had en
tered into with Captain Halpin and.
Lieutenant Tobin, both recently of the
detective bureau, by which a -certain
sum was to be paid each month for
the protection of Frank Ryan, who
last week it le a statement concern
ing the payment of protection money
to the police In order that he and
his brother might go along with
their clairvoyant business, without
molestation by the police.
Bertsche talked freely when he let
the grand jury room, and said that
even the members of the panel listen
ed to him in awe-stricken silence.
"They tried to make a Rosenthal out
of me and that's why I'm here."
Bertsche continued. "They thought
I was in so bad with the state's at
torney that they would get a gold
medal if they killed me. They lured
me down town where they could bhoo
me down and murder me in cold
blood."
Bertsche was not the only "inside
man" of the crime fraternity who
talked. Jimmy Ryan, master hand o
the "seer trust," who was convicted
with Barney in the clairvoyant trials,
also "came across." He followed the
course before the grand jury of his
brother, Frank Ryan, the brains of the
combination of swindlers, whose re
cent confession opened the way for a
string of indictments against police
men and police officials.
GERMAN PROTEST

Washington, D. C, Dec 8. The Ger

attention of the state department new
charges of violation by British troops
of the rules of international law. With'
the ncte the ambassador filed photo
graphs of wcuuds caused by their

PRESIDENT IS FACTOR
Executive Board Adopts Sug
gestion From White House
Has Been Costly Fight.
Denver. Col., Dec. 8. A recommend
ation to terminate the Colorado coal
miners' strike, which had its incep
tion in the northern Colorado coal
fields in April, 1910, and which for 14
months involved nearly the entire coal
mining industry of Colorado, is con
tained in a communication from the
international executive board.
The order to end the conflict was
contained in a communication from
the international executive board of
the United Mine Workers of America
presented by Vice President Hayes to
the union miners of Colorado In con
vention here.
"We recognize no surrender and
shall continue to propagate the prin
ciples of our humanitarium movement
throughout the coal fields of Color
ado," says the communication.
After reviewing efforts of the feder
al government to effect a settlement
of the controversy and quoting corre
spondence which passed between
President Wilson and the United
Mine Workers of America, the com
munication says that in view of recent
action of the president in appointing
a federal mediation commission, "We
deem it the part of wisdom to accept
his (president's) suggestion and ter
minate the strike."
Enormous Sum Spent.
"We have spent an enormous am
ount ofj money In waging this struggle
for justice and fair-play In. the min-.
ing fields of Colorado," the communi
cation continues, "but we feel it was
spent in -as a noble cause as was ever
given men to espouse. It is with feel
ings of pain and sorrow that we re
call the massacre of our men, women
and children at Ludlow. Sacrifices
were made and privations endured
that are without a parallell in the his
tory of labor struggles In America."
Discussion of the report from the in
ternational executive board's represen
tatives will follow the recommenda
tions of the convention's committee..
It seemed probable definite action
could not be taken before late today
or tomorrow. "
