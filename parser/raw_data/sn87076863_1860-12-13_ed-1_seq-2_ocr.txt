"flORTUEIlJI TRAITORS.
---The Southern mad caps wlo Jiave de
termined to "bundle their traps" and step
,mt of ? the Uqiou ia a. few days, thus
leaving us poor northerners out in the
cold, are not , the only traitors we have
40 our country. Northern editors who
1 r tow engaged in patting the disunion
ists on the back by intimating that they
bare good cause for complaint against the
people of tha free Stales, are equally
' guilt "with the traitors of the South, and
' should be just a severely dealt with.
Had it not been for their falsehoods and
, ,
Misrepresentations the ptesent lamentable
' state of things would not now exist; and
L jet, instead of exerting their influence to
'remedy the evil they hare created, they
are chuckling over it and wishing in their
hearts that the South will commit some
' vert act out of which political capital
' toay be manufactured ai d upon which
they will be' able to unite their now dis
7 traded and 'disorganized party.
T -"These men are even more guilty than
-Southerners can be, for they are sinning
Ywirh their eyes open, while men in the
South lave been duped and deceived by
their misrepresentations. In the event that
'civil war should come upon us, these
1 Northern Locofoco editors would proba
; bly be found mustering under the flag of
the Southern confederacy! They are cer
rtainly now engaged in extending aid and
eomfort to them in their treasonable de-

( That parVof the President's message
' in reference to secession was referred to a
' special committee of thirty-three, or one
from each State, by the House of Repre
' sentatives on the 4th inst. Tom Corwin,
' of this State, ia the Chairman. The de
mands of the South are so very unreason
'able that we are afraid the Committee will
fail to present any compromise that will
satisfy her in fact, we.believe that the
'Cotton States bave made up their minds
not to be satisfied with anything short of
dissolution. They have long been brood
ing over the destruction of this govern
.mentand eagerly seized upon the election
of a Republican to the Presidency as a
.'pretext for the consummation of their
cjiellish designs.' :-.!' -..'
TThe message was playfully but hap
pily hit off by Mr. Seward just after the
reading, when some friends of the Presi
dent eked bim what he thought of it.
f'l think," said the New York Senator,
Mbe President has conclusively proved
,two things: ' 1st, That no State has a
-right to secede unless it wishes to; and 2d,
'That it is the' President's duty to en
force the laws, unless somebody opposes
him." .-"-i-.,:;.
Democratic Money.
The depreciated currency of the West
ern and Southern States, is now denomin
ated "Democratic Money." The depre
ciation in value of this currency first
commenced by the Democratic politicians
and cotton merchants in .New York city
in their endeavors to get up a "panic" to
.defeat the election of Lincoln. Since
.then the .brokers, and. "bears," of the
Democratic persuasion,' finding it to their
interest(have kept crying it down.until all
J hose banks which are secured by stocks
ot the Democratic States, have greatly
depreciated, in value; thus it is that this
currency is called "Democratic money."
'And as a natural consequence, currency
!n good j repute, is now beginning to be
termed 'Lincoln Money." If you want
to make a Democrat mad, just ask him
io he likes ''Democratic money?", .,

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. .
As we gave the Message to our readers
m an extra last week, the document will
not appear in o.ur regular issue. . Our
sentiments in regard to this last produc
tion of the old Public Functionary are so
fully expressed in the columns of the
Cleveland Herald that we cannot refrain
from making use of its own language
instead of attempting to improve on it.
That paper says, "it is what we expected,
but not what we hoped. The wny was
open to Mr. Buchanan to retrieve his hon
or, in part at least, from the oul stains
which have polluted it for the last four
years. The profligacies end the corrup
tions of the Federal Government, during
his Administration, are passed, though
not forgotten. No act of the President
could cleanse his political robes of the
record which a searching investigation
has laid before the world, but it was left
for him, had he been possessed of the
spirit of patriotism and moral courage, to
make his last official days his best
days, and to retire with some degree
of credit. He saw a portion of the coun
try convulsed with a revolution against
a constitutional act, and heard open
threats of treason and rebellion agains'
t hat Government of which he is the head.
He felt the confederated fabric tremble
under the hurried rushing to and fro of
armed men, banded together with no
other purpose under heaven but the de
struction of the Union. He saw, on the
other hand, a myriad of peaceable citi
zens, who, having committed no unlawful
act, waited patiently for their executive
Head to plant himself in the path of the
hordes who were arrayed against law arid
order. Here was a field for the exercise
of statesmanship and decision that wo'd
bave given to James Buchanan, spite of
all his infamous antecedents, the credit
of being still possessed of one remaining
spark of national respect and political
honor. Had he now stepped boldly for
ward, and met the rebellious' seceders
with the edict,'Thus far have ye'gone.but,
by the Eternal, no farther .shall ye go,"
he would have retired to the shades of
Wheatland with the consciousness that
he had done one act to entitle him to a
place among those who have served their
country.
And Mr. Buchanan . could not fail to
see this, and know that he bad,in a mea
sure, his future srood name in bis hands!
as he penned his Message. But with the
Message before us, where do wc find bim?!
Weak, vacPating, cowardly; shirking the
responsibility upon the people North, and
the people South, upon Northern legis
lation, and most of all upon Congress.
He dares to do nothing bimse'.f, and flics
from one cover and another,like a fright
ened hare when the dogs in the kenue 1
howl. In the endeavor to stand be
tween the North and South, he is consis
tent to the position of neither. It is a
violation of the Constitution for any State
to secede, but if .any -Slate does secede,
no power in Congress nor out of it can
prevent it. He acknowledges it the du
ty of the Executive to enforce the laws
"and from this obligation, he cannot be
absolved by any buman power," and yet
because it would be difficult, if not ini
possible, to replace the machinery of the
Federal Government in South Carolina,
he is powerless to interfere and chooses
to wait nntil Congress shall pass laws so
as to more effectually carry out the de
signs of the Constitution, hoping, doubt
less, that from their dissensions, no such
laws will be passed until he has lett
the responsible' seat that he now holds.
l be Message will do no good at the
South. Indeed, the secession press has
repeatedly declared that, let the docu
ment be what it would, it would have no
effect upon their movements. The ques
tion is still open.
The President reviews the history of
the Constitution; entreats his fellow
countrymen to pause before they destroy
the Confederation; refers to the unsatis
factory aspect of foreign . and domestic
affairs when he took the Presidential
chair; and returns thanks for present pros
perity.
Summary of Washington Gossip.
The treasury is so hard up that it is
feared that the $1,5110,000 interest due
January 1st. in coin, will have to he drawn
directly from the Mint. The country now
gathers nothing but the bitterest fruits
for its blind adherence to bogus Demo
cracy. It is understood at Washington that a
volunteer force of 3000 men stand ready
to capture Fort Moultrie in case the Gen
eral Government signifies its intention to
use force against South Carolina.
Prominent Southern men continue their
protestations that the election of Lincoln
is not the cause of the secession move
ment. They substantially allege that
Cotton must rule either in the Union or
in a separate confederacy. It is intima
ted that the only compromise that could
be possibly acceptable to the South would
be an amendment of the Constitution,
providing for two Counsellors, to be cho
sen by the North, and South respeiclve-
1.. u...u r ...i . F. .
j, uum ui wuosc signatures shall be ne
cessary to all measures of legislation in
addition to that of the President.
It is thought Secretarv Cobb wi 11
ly resign not, however, for reasons con
nected with his disunion views but be
cause he has run the Treasury into the
ground, ana cannot get it out. He will
be succeeded, it is believed, by PoKtaas
ter-General Holt. Cobb's resignation will
probably be followed by the resignation
of benator Hunter, as Chairman of the
finance Committee, of the Senate. Hun
tar would in all likelihood be succeeded
by ressenden.
Mr. Powell's resolution in the Senate
to raise a committee to enquire into the
national troubled, lies over under the rule
It is thought many of the Republican
Senators will vote fo it, without necessa
rily committing themselves to any partic
ular line of policy.
Old Buck has actually mustered up
courage enough to say he will colU'ct the
revenues of all ports of seceding States,
at all hazards. We will see when the test
comes, if it ever does.
The California Senators assert that
under no circumstances will that State
leave the Union. - '
There is an encouraging display of Re
publiean back-bone at Washington. Re
publicans say that all they can consistent
ly concede will not satisfy the d is union -ist;
and that they will not yield to those
who expect and threaten to leave the
Union at all hazards.
Every effort will be made bv the se
cesiooists to carry the border States oul
of the Union with (he Cotton States. It
Maryland can be drawn into the secession
movement, the disunionists will attempt
to make Washington the Capital of the
new confederacy 1
The constant complaints of the English
Government that American citizens con-,
stanlly violate all laws and treaties pro
hibiting the African slave trade, are re
garded at Washington as indications that
British sympathy will be with the North
em States against the Southern in case of
disunion.
It is understood that as Chairman of
the committee of thirty-three, on condi
tion of the country, Mr. Corwin will pro
pose as a compromise an amendment to
section third of article second of the Con
stitution, by striking out that portion
which authorizes Congress to make all
needful rules and regulations for the ter
ritories hereafter to be organized the
people to elect their own officers, Ssc. O

Scene in the Senate.
The Cin. Commercial's telegraph cor
respondent gives a scene in the Senate as
follows:
Washington, Dec.5.
On motion concerning the reference of
the President's message, Lane, of Ore
gon, made an apology for the dissolution
of the Union, saying it must dissolve unless
the rights of the South are further guar
anteed. !
Hale, of New Hampshire, said the
logic of this controversy wis war or sub
mission. 1 he m'nonty must submit to
the majority. He made no threats, and
spoke without having consulted anybody;
ne spoke lor nimseit only, and one little
State. 'We must look this matter straight
in the face."
brown, of Miss., desired to know if
Hale presented the issue of war or sub
mission.
Hale said it must lead to that
He
made
no threat.
Brown replied sternly: "We will not
submit.and il it is war let it come aud Gcd
show the right."
Iverson ot Ga., was qniet at first, bat
haughty in the end. He accepted the
President's declaration that secession is
revolmion. "The States undersianj
they do it at the peril of consequence."
tie did not believe H would lead to war,
but if it dues the South is preparing to
receive its enemies with.blaodly hands
and hospitable graves. He hoped there
would be no war; that we would live in
peace.
1 lie boutli would regard the North a-
mong thr most favored of nations, and
so treat with her, but to remain in the
Union she would not. No power on
earth could prevent her withdrawal,
The repeal of all the personal liberty bills
of the North would be vain. "True.
they are obnoxious, but we care nothing
for their practical operation. But we
know their existence shows the feeling
of the people. They indicate two dis
tinct civilizations. The hatred of the
North for the South is deep as bell, and
I tell my brethren on the other side of
the floor no love is lost between us.
Two hostile nations occupy this floor.
We are enemies. They did not come a
cross this floor to extend us ordinary
civilities, yesterday, nor did we go to
them.
We are hostile. The State I repre
sent accepts the issue of war or submis
sion. We will not submit. I tell the gen
tleman South Carolina will not go alone.
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Geor
gia, will all be out by January loth, nev
er to return: and in less than twelve
months after our Government will be in
operation, Arkansas and Louisiana will
follow. One thing only prevents Texas
that is her Governor, and if he does
not yield to overwhelming public senti
ment some Texan Brutus will reach his
heart, and rid the world of a vile and
hoary-beaded traitor."
Mr. Iverson discarded all shams, say
ng inat tne election ot .Lincoln was no
cause for secession, but the South would
not be governed by the North, and
intended to go out while she had the
strength, not to wait until she was too
weak. .
Douglas sat scowling
in his sent;
The North-
Southern men looked cool.
ern men were calm and collected. Crit
tenden was profoundly moved, and the
galleries were astounded. Jeff. Davis, in
quick decisive way, said he came as
a Senator of the Uniied States. While
there is yet no declaration of war against
the States of which wc are the mere
embassadors, he wo'd discharge his duty
as Senator, and wo'd say nothing on the
subject.
Wigfall talked Senators out of their
seats, but he said one thing. He said
that he disagreed with Hale. That S-n-
ator said the President's messnge was
neither one thing nor the other. Wig-
fall thought it both one thing and the
other.
Saulbury, of Delaware, made an ear
nest and tloquent plea lor the Union,
which was received with thunders ol
applause from the calleries. He said
Delaware was the 6rst to go into the
Union and would be the last to go out.
She would use all her power to preserve
the Uo'on. The disunion speeches were
received in profound silence.
JtSTTke census of Cincinnati, has been
retaken by Mr. C. S. Williams under tbe
direction of the municipal authorities.
His enumeration brings the population up
to 171,293; about 10,000 more than the
figures of the government census. Mr.W
states that the school census affords the
most unreliable basis for calculating the
aggregate population.
The Kansas War Humbug Completely
' ; Exposed. : s
'Gen. J. F. Snyder, Division Inspec
tor of the Sixth Military District of the
Missouri Mi'itia, writes from Boliver,
Mo., under date of December 3, to the
St. Louis Republican, a letter which
leaves the sensation reporters of civil
war in Kansas not a foot of ground to
. . . ... -i i
stand on. wequote-ihe essential por-1
tion of the communication:
Ma. Editor: Before this reaches you
the majority of your readers . will have
ascertained that the "invasion" of the
State by Montgomery, which caused so
much excitement, was, so lar as the "in
vasion" is concerned, the merest piece ol
M unchausenism. without any lounda-
lion in truth. How the yarn that James
Montgomery and his gang of horse
thieves had "taken Fort Scott, could
cause any excitement in the estate oi
Missouri, is a mystery; for every one
knows that he has had Fort Scott and all
of Southern Kansas for the last three
years. You have, perhaps, learned by
this time that the "three hundred arm-
i i i ... II .1 crt. .,
ed outlaws wno invauea tne oiaie
"took Fort Scott," and "broke up the
United States District Court," have
dwindled down to certain threats of
Montgomery's and Jennison's, and a
bout six'een vagabond Abolitionists who
lurked about Fort Scott but a few days
before the Court was to have been held.
It is true that Montgomery is an anti-
slavery fanatic, of the Jonn Brown
chool, and that he has been to the North,
recently, and returned with arms of dif
ferent kinds. It is true that he has dis
tributed those arms to about two hun
dred of hi ragged followers, who scat
ter to their dens at the approach of dan
ger, and are whistled together again like
a flock of quails. It is true that Mont
gomery is harboring a few fugitive slaves,
and that Jennison has made certain dec
larations of waging war "upon the curse
of slavery in Missouri;" and it is true
that Jennison, Montgomery & Co., have
recently shot Moore and Bishop, and
hung Harrison, Hines and Sam Scott.
And that is all of it. Bad enough to be
sure; but all these outrages concern the
Territory of Kansas, nd not Missouri.
Miy is it mat the federal Government
has not heretofore enforced the fugitive
slave law in Kansas, and checked the
course of the outlaws there, are mat
ters which I do not now propose to dis
cuss. The prompt action of our Executive, in
taking steps to protect our Western fron
tier, cannot be too highly applauded or
appreciated: but the idea of marching
the gallant St. Louis Brigade to the South
west, is, to one familiar with the state of
affairs on the border, very amusing. We
want no St. Louis so'diery to protect us.
I feel great sati.-faction in stating that the
militia of my district is fully adequate to
the defense of our State against all the
ragged, nigger steal ng outlaws that Jim
Montgomery ma' be able to march against
us. All we ask of the Governor is to
furnish us with arms and other munitions
of war.

is a growing tendency in thiiage to appropri
ate the mo expicssire words of other lan
guages, and after a while to incorporate them
nto our own , thus the word Cephalic, which
is from the Greek, signifing "for the head,
is now becoming popularized in connection
with Mr Spalding's great Headache remedy,
but it will soon be used in a more general

irrlteadache is the favorite sign by which:
nature makes known any deviation whatever
from the natural state of the brain, and view
ed in this light it may be looked on as a safe
guard intended lo give notice oi a uiarnse
which might otherwise escape attention, till
too late to be remedied ; and its indications
should never be neglected. Headaches may
be classified under two names, viz: sympto
matic and Idiopathic. St mtomatic.Headacbv
is exceedingly common and is the precursor
of a great variety of diseases, among whicb
are Apoplexy, Uout, Kbenmatism ana mil rav
brile diseases. In its nervous form it is sym

tion and other disorders ol the bowels,as well
as renal and uterine aff. clions, . Diseases of
the heart are very frequently a tended witk
ncaoaciics; Anaemia and plethora are als
affections which frequently occasion headache.
laiopainic Headache is also very common r
being usually distinguished by the name of
nervous headache, sometimes coming on sudV
denly in a state of apparently sound health,
and prostrating at once the mental and Dhva.
ical energies, and in other instances it comn
on slow li, heralded by depression of spirit
or acerbity of temper. In most instances the-
pa o is iu tne iron i ot tne neaa, over one or
both eyes, and sometimes provoking vomit

No one of the "many ills flesh is heir to" is
so prevalent , so little understood, and so much
neglected as Costiveness. Often originating;
in carelessness, or sedentary habits; it is re
garded as a alight disorder of too little conse
quence to excite auxiety, while in reality it is
the precursor and companion of many of the
most, fatal and dangerous diseases, and unless
early eradicated it wil. bring the sufferer t
an untimely grave. Among the lighter evile
of which costiveness is the usual attendant
are Headache, Colic, Rheumatism, . Fool

Malignant Fevers, Abcesses, Dysentary, Di'
arrhoea, Dyspepsia, Apoplexy, Epilepsy .Par
alysis, Hysteria. Hypocendriasis, Melancholy
and Insanity, first indicate their presence ia
the system by this alarming symptom. JMot
unfrequer.tly the diseases named originate,
in Coustipation, but take on an independent,
existence unless the cause is eradicated in an.
early stace. Froia.all these considerations itf
follows that the disorder should receive imme
diate attention whenever it occurs, and no
person should neglect o get a box of Cephal
ic Pills on the first appearance of the-cosa
plaint, as their timely use will expel the in
siduous approaches of disease and destroy
thhi dangerous foe to human life. , ;
