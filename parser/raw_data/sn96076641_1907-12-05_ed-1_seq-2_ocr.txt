MESSAGE SENT
TO CONGRESS
President's Recommen
dations on National
Legislation.
AS TO CURRENCY QUESTION
Many Defects of Present System
Are Pointed Out by Chief
Executive.
NOT TIME FOR TARIFF
Postponement of Discussion of Re
vision cf Schedules Until After
Presidential Election Urged Ne
cessity for Improving Waterways of
the Country. ,
Washington, Doe. 3. President Roose
velt In his annual message deals vigor
ously with matters of national impor
tance. Referring" tq the rictnt disturb
ance In financial circles he points out
that the hftanlinj? of money by the peo
ple, Instead of keeping It In sound banks,
was the first cause of financial stringency
and a tcrave error. He pays a tribute to
the general honesty of the men engaged
in the banking business.
After quotations from his last annual
message which dealt with the necessity
of governmental regulations, the presi
dent asserts that his views have in no
way changed and declares It Is the duty
of the national government to embody
In action the principles he then expressed.
Disclaiming any idea of advocating cen
tralization the president insists upon the
necessity for federal control of the rail
roads of the country through the inter
state commerce commission, and also
urges legislation looking to the proper
control of the great business concerns en
gaged in interstate business, this control
to be exercised for their own benefit and
prosperity no less than for the protection
of investors and of the general public.
Want Federal Control.
Declaring that modern industrial con
ditions are such that combination Is nut
only necessary but inevitable, the presi
dent refers to his messy ;.e of a year a?o
concerning necessary changes in the
nntitruft laws, lie goes on: "I ask for
full power to be given Vhe federal
government, because no single state
can by legislation effectually cope
with these powerful corporations en
gaged Jn Interstate commerce, and. while
doing them full Justice, exact from them
in return full Justice to others. The con
ditions of railroad activity, the condi
tion:! of our Immense interstate com
merce, , are such as to mike the central
government alone competent to exercise
full supervision and control.
"The antitrust law nhoul.l be made both
more efficient and mere in harmony with
actual conditions.,' It lUueild be, so a-nnd-ed
as to forbid ony the Kind of combina
tion which doe3 lyrni krjw he pnerdl pub
Ik) such amendment to 'be accompanied
by. or to be an incident of, a grant of su
pervlr.ory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged in inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the inspec
tion of the government ofllelals. A be
ginning has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment of th
bureau of corporations.
"Among the points to be aimed at
should be the prohibition of unhealthy
competition, such as by rendering service
at an actual los3 for the purpose of crush
ing out competition, t lie prevention of in
flation of capita), and the prohibition of
a corporation's making exclusive trade
with itself a condition of having any
trade with itself. Reasonable agreements
between, or combinations of, corporations
r.hould be permitted, provided they are
first submitted to and approved by some
appropriate government body.
I.Ike JVntlonal Hank Supervision.
"The congress ha a the power to charter
corporations to engage in interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted tinder the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and nnv federal corpora
tions could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. The supervision established
might be analogous to that now exercised
over national banks. At least, the anti
trust act should be supplemented by spe
cific prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has hown have leen of most
service in enabling monopolistic combina
tions to e rnr.li out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do luiHinops In their own name.
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tions should hereafter be denied to inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government official, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the lifting with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by th
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporation in which such stock is
owned."
The Currency Question.
On the oufi-.tlon of the currency the
president calls attention to his last an
nual message wherein he pointed out
that our present system is defective and
showing the need of a change. In that
message he said:
"National banks should be permitted to
Issue a specified proportion of their cap
ital In notes of a given kind, the Issue to
be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the
notes back when not wanted In legiti
mate trade. This plan would not per
mit the issue of currency to give banks
additional profits, but to meet the emer
gency presented by times of trlngeney.
I do not say that this is the right sys
tem. 1 only advance It to emphasize
my belief that there Is need for the adop
tlon of some system which shall be au
tomatic and open to all sound banks,
so as to avoid all possibility of discrim
ination and favoritism. Such a plan
would tend to prevent the spasms of high
money and rpeeulatlon which now ob
tain In the New York market: for at
present there Is too much currency at
certain seasons of the yenr. and Its ac
cumulation at New York tempts bankers
to lend It at low rates for speruliMve
purposes; whereas at other times when
the crops are being moved there Is ur
gent need for n large but temporary In
crease in the currency swpplv. It must
never be forgotten t lint this question
concerns business men generally quite
as much as bankers: especially is this
true of stockmen, farmers and business
men In the west: for nt present at certain
reasons of the yenr the difference In In
terest rales between the eat and west
Is from six to ten per cent., whereas in
Canada the corresponding difference Is
but two per cent. Any plaa must, of
course, guard the Interests of western
und routhern bankers as carefully as it
guards the Interests of New York or
Chleayo bankers, and must be drawn
from the standpoints of the farmer and
the merchant no less than from the
standpoints of the city banker and the
country banker."
Itepentn Keeoinniendatlona.
The president continues:
"I again urge on the congress the
need of Immediate attention to this
matter. We need a greater elasticity
In our currency; provided, of course,
that we recognlro the even greater
need of a safe and secure currency.
There must always be th most rigid
examination by the national authori
ties. Provision should be made for an
emergency currency. The emergency
issue should, of "course, be made with
an effectlvo guaranty, and upon condi
tions carefully prescribed by the gov
ernment. Such emergency Issue must
be based on udreiuate securities ap
proved by the government, and must
be issued under a heavy tax. This
would permit currency being issued
when the demand for it was urgent,
while securing Its retirement as the
demand fell off, It is worth investi
gating to determine whether officers
and directors of national banks should
ever be allowed to loan to themselves.
Trust companies should be subject to
the same supervision as banks; legisla
tion to this effect should be enacted for
the District of Columbia and the terri
tories." JVot Time for Tariff Dlncttislon.
On the subject of the tariff the presi
dent declares himself In favor of post
poning all consideration of the ques
tion until after the presidential elec
tion. He says:
"This country Is definitely committed
to the protective system and any effort
to uproot It could not but cause wide
spread industrial disaster. In other
words, the principle of the present tar
iff law could not with wisdom bo
changed. Rut in a country of such
phenomenal growth as enars it Is prob
ably well that every dozen years or so
the tirlff laws should be carefully
scrutinized so as to see that no ex
cessive or Improper benefits are con
ferred thereby, that proper revenue, Is
provided, and that our foreign trade is
encouraged. There must always be as
a minimum a tariff which will not only
allow for the collection of an amplo
revenue but which will at least make
good the difference In cost of produc
tion here and abroad; that is, the dif
ference in the labor cost here and
abroad, for the well-being of the wage
worker must ever be a cardinal point
of American policy. The sole consider
ation should be to see that the sum
total of changes represent the public
good. Thla means that the subject can
not with wisdom be dealt with in the
year preceding a presidential election,
because as a matter of fact experience
baa conclusively shown that at such a
time it Is impossible to get men to
treat it from the standpoint of the
public good. In my judgment the wlao
time to deal with the matter la immedi
ately after such t lection."
Income nod Inheritance Tax.
There lias been no change in the
mind of the president concerning the
advisability of an Income tax and nn
Inheritance tax. In the message he
says:
"When our tax taws are revised the
question of an Income tax and nn In
heritance tax should receive the care
ful attention of our legislators. In my
Judgment both of these taxes should be
part of our system of federal taxation.
I speak diffidently about the income tax
because one scheme for an income tax
Whs declared unconstitutional by the
supreme court: vihile in addition it is
a difficult tax to administer in Its prac
tical working. Nevertheless, a grad
uated Income tax of the proper type
would be a desirable feature of federal
taxation, and It Is to be hoped that one
may be devised which the supreme
court will declare constitutional. The
Inheritance tax. however, is both a far
better method of taxation, and far more
important for the purpose of having
the fortunes of the country bear in
proportion to their Increase in size a
corresponding Increase and burden of
taxation. The government has the ab
solute rl?ht to decide as to the terms
upon which a man shall receive the be
quest or devise from another, and this
point in the devolution of property Is
especially appropriate for the Imposi
tion of a tax."
Due Enforcement of Lbtt.
On the matter of the Impartial en
forcement of the laws the message
says:
. "A few years ago there was loud
complaint that the law could not be in
voked against wealthy offenders. There
is no such complaint now. The course
of the department of Justice during the
last few years has been such as to
make it evident that no man stands
above the law. that no corporation is
so wealthy that it cannot be held to
account. Everything that can no done
under the existing law. and with tho
existing state of public opinion, which
so profoundly Influences both the
courts and Juries, has been done. Rut
the laws themselves need strengthen
ing In more than one Important point;
they should be made more definite, so
that no honest man can be led unwit
tingly to break them, and so that the
real wrongdoer can be readily punished.
"The two great evils in the execution
of our criminal laws to-day are sintl
mentally and technically. For the lat
ter the remedy must come from the
hands of the legislatures, the courts
and the lawyers. The other must de
pend for its cure upon the gradual
growth of a sound public opinion which
shall Inelst that regard for the law and
the demands of reason shall control all
other Influences nnd emotions In the
Jury box. Roth of these evils must.be
removed or public discontent with the
criminal law will continue."
I'se of Injunctions.
Referring to the question of the use and
abuse of injunctions the president de
clares: "Instances of abuse in the granting of
Injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment in the minds
of those who feel that their rights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the iue of the process of Injunction Is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
ao'me of it there U warrant. This ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime.
Importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with It In effective man
ner. It Is certain ultimately to demand
some sort of legislative action. I earnest
ly commend to the attention of the con
gress this matter, so that aome way may
b devised which will limit the abuse of
Injunctions and protect those tights which
from time to time it unwarrantably In
vades." Among the recommendations made In
the message are for federal inspection of
railroads, the establishment cf an em
ployers' I'nbllity act. and for the exten
sion of the present eight-hour law by the
government.
In Industrial Disputes.
The president favors compulsory In
vestigation by the national government
of Industrial dlrputes.Vsaylng:
"Strikes and lockouts, with their at
tendant loss and suffering, continue to
Increase. Tor the live years ending De
cember 31. iy5, tli number of strikes
was greater than thoce In any previous
to vi'ttv and was double th nutui-r
in tho preceding live years. These Inj
ures Indicate tho Increasing need of
providing some machinery to deal with
this class of disturbances In ithe Inter-
ett alike of the employer, the employe
and the general public. I renew my
previous recommendation that the con
gress favorably consider the matter of
creating the machinery for compulaory
Investigation of such Industrial contro
versies aa are of sufficient magnitude
and of sufficient concern to the people
of the country aa a whole to warrant
the federal government In taking action.
The recent atrlke of the telegraphers la
ted as an Instance where such power
might profitably have been uced.
CbU4 Labor Kvil.
The necessity of checking the evil of
child labor Is pointed out with much di
rectness. On the relation between capital
and labor the president asserts that pub
lic opinion must be aroused in condemna
tion of evil practices on both aides. The
work of the department of agriculture Is
given high praise and the importance of
the department pointed out. Cooperation
with farmers' associations is urged. The
necerpity of a national syctem of inspec
tion and grading of grain, to correct evils
complained of, is also pointed out.
.National Wafer Highways.
Showing the necet-jlty for the develop
ment of the national water highways the
me.xrnge says: "Our greut river systems
Ehould be developed as national water
highways; the Mississippi, with Its trib
utaries standing first In importance, and
the. (Vlumbla second, although there are
many othe rs of Importance on the Pacific,
the Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The na
tional government should undertake this
work, and I hope a beginning will be
made In the present congress: and the
greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should reeive especial uttentlon. From
the great lakes to the mouth of the Mis
sissippi there rhould be a deep waterway,
with deep waterways leading from it to
the east and west. Such a waterway
would practically mean the extension of
our coast line into the very heart of our
country. It would be of incalculable ben
efit to our people.
"As an Incident to creating the deep
venterway down the Mississippi, the gov
ernment should build along Its whole
lower length levees which, taken to
gether with the control of the head
waters, will at once and forever put a
complete stop to all threat of floods in
the Immensely fertile Delta region. The
territory lying adjacent to the Missis
sippi along its lower course will there
by become one of the most prosperous
and populous, as it already is one of
the most fertile, farming regions in all
the world."
Public Lands.
Extension of the work of irrigation and
the reclamation of waste lands Is advo
cated, together with a revision of the
present land laws in the interest of the
actual home-maker. The unlawiui renc
ing of public lands for private grazing,
the president says, must be stopped, but
at the same time the necessity which oc
casioned It must be provided for. Several
plans are recommended.
Conservatism of the mineral wealth of
the country, and the necessity for the
preservation of the forests to prevent a
timber famine, are dwelt upon. Drastic
action by the congress Is urged.
Would Repeal Duty on Wood I'ulp.
The president declares In favor of the
repeal of the duty em wood pulp, at the
same time declaring that it should if
possible be nccompanled by an agreement
with Canada that there should be no ex
port duty on Canadian pulp wood.
That the government should own and
lease mineral and oil lands Is the bellej
of the president.
Work on the Panama canal Is declared
to be proceeding in a satisfactory man
ner, and figures given to substantiate the
statement. M
? For I'ostiil Killing Hanks.
On the questions of postal savings
banks and the establishment of a parcels
port system the message aays:
"I commend to the favorable considera
tion of the congress a postal savings
bank system as recommended by the
postmaster general.
"I further commend to the congress the
consideration of the postmaster general's
recommendation for an extension of the
parcel post, especially on the rural
routes. These recommendations have
been drawn up to benefit the farmer and
the country storekeeper; otherwise I
should not favor them, for I believe that
it Is good policy for our government to do
everything possible to aid the small town
and the country district. It is desirable
that the country merchant should not be
crushed out."
Rome form of local self-government
for Alaska Is asked of the congress,
and that the rights of citizenship be
conferred upon the people of Porto
Rico.
Campaign Contributions.
The president says: "It Is well to
provide that corporations shall not con
tribute to presidential or national cam
paigns, and furthermore to provide for
the publlrtalon of both contributions
and expenditures. The need for col
lecting large campaign funds would
vanish if congress provided an appro
priation for the proper and legitimate
expenses of each of the great national
parties, an appropriation ample enough
to meet the necessity for thorough or
ganization and machinery, which re
quires a large expenditure of money.
Then the stipulation should be made
that no party receiving campaign funds
from the treasury should accept more
than a fixeil amount from any Indi
vidual subscriber or donor: anl the
necessary publicity for rectlpts and ex
penditures could without difficulty be
provided."
The extension of the Ocean Mall act
of 1891 is recommended as nn aid to
American shipping. A subsidy for
Pacific steamers, the president thinks,
Is necessary.
That the army In the past has been
niggardly provided for and should be
more generously dealt with is dwelt
upon at length, together with recom
mendations for future legislation.
Yearly additions to the navy are
recommended and In the president's
Judgment the country should build four
battleships this year.
Itcnnoa for Pacific Cruise.
Concerning the dispatch of the fleet
to the Pacific, .fhe president believes it
should be shifted between the two
oceans every year or two as n means of
teaching officers and men how to handle
the vessels In a time of war.
Although the results of The Hague
conference are declared not to have
beeti up to expectations, a degree of
good Is said to have resulted, notably a
provision by which the powers taking
part In the conference agreed not to
have recourse to armed force for the
collection of debts owed to their citi
zens by foreign countries.
The expectation of the government
Is declared to be to turn over Cuba to
a government chosen by the people of
the Island within the coming year,
(itrmii Tariff Agreement.
Concerning the tariff agreement en
tered Into with Oermany. Its object Is
declared to have been the prevention of
a tariff war between the United States
and that country. The work of the
commission which made the agreement
- Is prals'd.
The president asks for authority to
remit China all Indemnity In excess
of the 111m ef Jll.Cr.i.492.6 and inter
est at four per cent.
In conclusion the message congratu
lates the country on Its present cor
dial relations with all countries, par
ticularly the sitter republics to the
south.
CONUKKSS.
Both Houses Open and Adjourn Out
of Respect to the Dead. .
Doth houses of congress opened at
noon Monday for the sixtieth session.
As usual there were great crowds on
hand, but a noticeable feature lacking
was the floral display. This got to be
so lavish that both the senate and
house last year decided to do away
with flowers entirely on opening days.
Iloth houses adjourned shortly after
organizing, out of respect for mem
bers who died during the vacation.
Before adjournment each notified the
president that it was in session.
The house was called to order on
the stroke of 12 by Clerk McDowell.
Chaplain Couden offered prayer. The
roll was called and then Uep. Hepburn
of Iowa placed Joseph G. Cannon in
nomination for speaker. Hep. Clay
ton, Virginia, nominated John Sharp
Williams. Doth names were applaud
ed generously by the galleries and by
both sides on the floor of the house.
The vote resulted: Cannon, 207;
Williams, 154. The house? then ad
jonrncd. The senate was called to c-dcr by
Vice-President Fairbanks. Senator
La Toilette was the first senator recog
nized. Ho presented the credentials
of Isaac R. Stophenscn,. lm new col
league from Wisconsin. There are VI
new senators and all wero sworn In
except Senators Johnston and Dank
head, of Alabama, who had to await
the announcement of the deaths of
Senators Morgan nnd Pettus. As
soon as these deaths were announced
the senate adjourned out of respect, eo
the new Alabama senators were not
sworn in with the others..
Faraker Wants It.
Joseph Dienson Foraker. of Cincin
nati, U. S. senator fjrom Ohio, has de
clared himself in the race for the
Republican nomination for president.
He has declared openly that he will
contest with William Howard Taft, of
Cincinnati, secretary of war, for the
Ohio delegation. Foraker's announce
ment is contained In a letter to Con
rad J. Mattern, of Dayton, vice-president
of the Ohio Republican league.
Hope Gone.
The number of men entombed In
the Naomi mine of the United Coal
Co., located one and one-half miles
back of Monongahela City, is now said
to be 50. Hope that the men will be
rescued alive Is gradually dwindling
away.
Thaw Must Wait.
The second trial of Harry K. Thaw
on the charge of killing Stanford
White has been postponed until Jan. 0.
The court ordered that a special y,ar.o

THE HUGH
EARTHQUAKE
THE MOST APPALLING NATURAL
CATASTROPHE YET ON
RECORD.
SCENES INDESCRIBABLE.
Twelve Thousand People Perished Ir
the Awful Disaster Amidst the Ter
rible Shocks and Furious Storrr
Bursts.
Now that the first full account, com
ing from Tashkend, via St. Peters
burg, has arrived, there can be nc
doubt that the Karatagh earthquake
was one of the most appalling natural
catastrophes on record. "It is difll
cult," writes the reporter, "to describe
the Ecer.es which meet the eyes at
Karatugh today. What was a short
while ago a llouirshing township, Is
now the grave of 1.000 dead. Um the
scenes which accompanied the catas
trophe are even more difficult of ade
quate description. A group of surviv
ors, still shaken by their experiences
related a terrible story, to which no
written narrative can do justice. On
the eve of the disaster, October 20, n
terrific storm burst over Karatagh
and Its environments, striking n dfad
Iy fear into the hearts of the Inhabit
ants. The animal world seemed to.
have an uncanny foreknowledge. Dog
howled, horses stampeded, cattl-:
lowed with fright.
Early In the morning the whe'le
town seemed to shudder. The earth
tremors were frequent, but few ol
the townspeople were sufficiently dis
turbed by them to leave their houses
Fifteen minutes later a terrific shock
set the entire place swaying, the ait
resounding with weird noises. Then
the town seemed to be repeateilly lift
ed high in the air and set down heav
ily by mighty hands. Buildings were
crumbling and crashing to ruins every
moment or two. In scores of places
the ground burst open and boiling wa
ter spouted upward.
"Huge fragments of rock became
dislodged from the surrounding moun
tiins and added the thunder of theii
fall to the subterranean rumblings ami
roarings which continued all the time
Numerous houses were battered down
by the failing rocks. Others, with
their cccupant3, sank bodily Into great
fissures in the earth. "The populace,
or such of them as had escaped in
stant death, appeared to be mad with
tfrrcr. From every side arose awful
shrieks. Thcso who 1W for r.afety had
to blind their eyes to many ghastly
sights. The storm had come on again
with renewed force and a veritable
pandemonium rejsned. Maddened ani
mals tore aimlessly hithw and thith
er, continuous peals of thunder and
Hashes of Mindirg lightning adding to
the freruy. Many fugitives perished
under the hcofs cf animals.
"In the me-U'tiir.e similar scenes
were being enacted in th? surrounding
country, twelve large villages being
destroyed on this same terrible morn
ing. So died In all some 12,000 per
.sons. In Karatagh alone 2,000 bodies
were recovered. As many more still re
main in the ruins of 1,200 houses,
while 25,000 animals, on a rough esti
mate, were destroyed."
Important Bills.
In the matter of legislation Michi
gan is to take a more than usually
prominent part In this congress. All
the measures to be offered by Michi
gan men have not as yet been perfect
ed, but several of them will introduce
bills of national Importance, some of
which are sure to pass if the attitude
of the leaders Indicates anything.
Townsend has some big ones. He
will reintroduce his bill providing for
arbitration of labor troubles, and an
other placing express companies on
the same footing as railroads under
the rate law, so that their rates will
be subject to supervision by tho Inter
state commerce commission and to
modification on justified complaint.
Among ethers, Denby will Introduce
a bill to compel tho return of railroad
cars promptly when borrowed by one
road from another, and to permit In
surance adjusters to ride free on rail
road trains while looking up claims in
which a railroad employe or his widow
or family are Interested.
Smith will not confine himself to
District of Columbia affairs. He has
pepared a bill for the reduction of
telegraph rates, to grant all war
widows a $12 pension, and to compel
telegraph companies to ncto on all
dispatches the time of both receipt
and delivery.
Russia's Hope.
The visit to St. Petersburg of Sec
retary Taft has become the event of
the day In the Russian capital. The
news-papers publish long Illustrated
scotches of tht distinguished visitor
and dwell on the Importance of his
visit, which is considered to be an at
tempt to prepare t'ie way for a Itusstv
Amcrlcan vndcrstandlng regarding
affairs In the far east.
Roosevelt Positive.
The Inter-Ocean's Washington cor
respondent says: President Roosevelt
will make another declaration that he
will not again accept a nomination as
the standard bearer cf his party, If
such a course becomes necessafy. It
will be done If any of tho state con
ventions olect delegates to the Repub
lican national convention Instructed to
vot for hlrn.
Czar No Autocrat.
The duma has decreed that the title
"autocrat." which has been borne hy
the emperors of Russia for centuries,
is no longer tenable within the Rus
sian state and is Incompatible with
the regime Inaugurated by Emperor
Nicholas October 30. 1903. At the close
of a treat constitutional debate the
Russian duma. by a vote of 112 to 24f..
rejected the wcrd "autocrat" and then
adopted a reply to the address from
the throne unanimously, amid scenes
of Immense excitement, prolonged
cheering and tho tinging of the na
tional icihem.
The
General "Demand
of the Well-informed of the WoiM hai
always been for a simple, pleasant and
efficient liquid laxative remedy of known
value; a laxative which physicians could
banction for family use because its com
ponent parts arc known to them to bo
wholesome and truly beneficial in effect,
acceptable to tho system and gentle, yet
prompt, in action.
In supplying that demand with its ex
cellent combination of Syrup of Figs and
Elixir of Senna, the California Fig Syrup
Co. proceeds alonj ethical lines and relics
on the merits of tho laxative for its remark
able success.
That is one of many reasons why
Syrup of Fii ami Elixir of Senna is given
the preference by the Weil-Informed.
To get it: beneficial effects always buy
tho genuine manufactured by the Cali
fornia Fig Syrup Co., only, and fur ealo
by all leading druggists. Price fifty cent

A Sensitive Scul.
Owen Mudge was a very sensitlvo
man. More than once at a harsh word
he had forsaken profitable work and
gone home for sympathy to hl3 wife.
One morning Owen started out to help
Glenn llutler, who had bought a new
stump-pulling machine and wa3 pre
paring to clear n field.
Toward noon Owen came back. Mrs.
Mudge sighed and waited sympathetic
ally for the explanation.
"I just couldn't stand It," said Owen,
rubbing his jaw. "When I see that
Btump-puller twist them roots out, it
reminded mo so of the times I went
to the dentist to get back teeth ex
tracted. The first thing I knew 1 was
limp as a rag, and I , just ached all
over and had to quit." Youth's Com
panion. Best He Could Do.
It wa3 his first circuit, and, more
over, he had to defend his first client,
who was a better known than re
spected burglar In an interval he
approached a veteran member of the
bar and sought for advice.
"And how long do you think I
ought to make, my speech to the jury,,
sir?" he finished up.
"I should say about an hour," said
the old hand.
"An hour! Why, I thought ten
minutes would be ample! Why so
long?"
"Well," said his adviser, "you see,
they can't sentence him till you're
finished, and the longer you talk tho
longer he'll bo out cf jail!" Stray
Stories.
Going to Be Fined.
When George Ade was a newspaper
reporter he was sent to "write up" aa
Irish laborer who had fallen from a
building. When Mr. Ade arrived on
the scene, several officers and others
were helping the Injured man into the
ambulance. Mr. Ado pulled out his
pad and pencil. "What's his name?"
he asked one of the policemen.
The Injured man, who had heard
Ade and who mistook him for tho
timekeeper employed by the con
tractor, rolled his eyes in a disgusted
way.
"What d'ye think o that?" he mut
tered. "I'm goin' to be docked for
the few minutes I lose, goin' to tho
hospital ! " Success.
Experience.
"Experience is the best teacher,"
remarked the man who Indulges In.
trite sayings.
"Yes," answered the skeptic; "but
occasionally, as In distinguishing be
tween mushrooms and toadstools,
your education comes too late to be
of any service."
Chance to Get Even.
The poet and the editor were play
ing tennis, and the latter was beaten.
"You serve well, but you cannot
return," said the poet.
"Can't I?" asked tho editor. "Send
rno a poem, and see." Stray Stories.
It sometimes happens that a man
stops work after securing a political
job.
BEGAN YOUNG.
Had "Coffee Nerves" from Youth.
"When very young I began using;
coffee and continued up to the past
six months," writes a Texas girl.
"I had been exceedingly nervous,
thin and very sallow." After quitting;
coffee and drinking Postum Food Cof
fee about a month my nervousness
disappeared and has never returned.
This Is the more remarkable as I am
t Prlmnrv t.irhpr nnel hnvn kpnt
right on with my work.
"My complexion now Is clear and
rosy, my skin soft and smooth. As a
good complexion was something I had
greatly desired, I feel amply repaid
even tho this were the only benefit
derived from drinking Postura.
"Ileforo beginning Its use 1 had
suffered greatly from indigestion and
headache; these troubles are now un
known. "
"Rest of all, I changed from coffee
to Postum without the slightest Incon
venience, did not even have a head
ache. Have known coffee drinkers
who were visiting me, to use Tostum
a week without being awaro that they
were not drinking coffee.
"I h.ivr known spvpral to lir-rrhi lhr

they did not boll it properly. After
explaining how It should be prepared
they have tried It again and pro
