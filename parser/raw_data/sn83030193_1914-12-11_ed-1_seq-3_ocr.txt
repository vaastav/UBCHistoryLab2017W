THE NEW MEDICAMENT.
"In eighty-four out of 11 cases

Frtnch physician and his associate
tho mothers Buffered absolutely no

so slight that the mothers refused to
'bother with a second injection.
Every child lived, and three out of
tho 112 mothers brought twins into
tho world.
"The tremendous advantage of
this treatment is that it requires
no special, elaborat watching
by doctor or nurss. In nearly
very esse ons Injection is suf
ficient to sot properly upon ths
nerves and reduce ths pattsnt to
smiling drowsiness. Ths French
Government thinks so highly of
ths trsstment that when ths war

Thompson added, with nne scorn
"They forget that it's tho laity who
must nave tne cniidreni"
WHERE NATURE MAY BOW TO
8CIENCE.
"Men physicians are sufficiently
keen in the Investigation of tubercu
losis, cancer and other fluttering which
fails on a man as often as on a worn
an," I observed, "It's easy to dismiss
as 'natural' tho torturo you yourself
need never endure."
"Of course," nodded Mr. Thompson.
"Htlll, you must do men tho Jusllca to
bdmlt that they have ut length worked
out tho problem of painless mother-
hood.
"Suppose it Is 'natural for
women to suffsr when they bring
ohlldren Into the world. Is that
any rssson why the suffering
should never end? Doubtltit it
has served Its purpose as a etsge
in our evolution, but that stsge is
past Civilization advances by
conquering nature. It's perfectly
'natural' for a man to suffsr psin
when he hss a tooth pulled, but I
notice he's uiually ready to 1st
science mitigate nature. An earth
quake is a 'natural' phenomenon,
but we gat out of the way whan

"And Isn't It true," I suggested,

causes to-day Is not even natural, In
