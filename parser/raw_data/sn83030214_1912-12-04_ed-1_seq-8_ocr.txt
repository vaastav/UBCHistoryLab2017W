REORGANIZATION OF
STATE DEPARTMENT.
At ti.e beginnlng of the present admin
istratlon the- United Btatea, havlng fully
entered uj?on its position as a world pow?
er, with the rrspon.ibllltles thrust upon
lt hy the results of the Spanlsh-Amerlcan
?VVar. and already engaged ln laylng the
groundwork of a vast foreign trade upon
whleh it should one day become more and
more dependent. found itself without the
machlnery for giving thorough attentton \
to and taklng effectivc actlon upon a
niass of intricate business vital to Amer?
ican interests in every eountry ln the
world.
The Department of State was an archalc
and inadequate machlne, laeklng most of
the attributes of the foreign offlce of any
great modern power. With an approprla?
tion made upon my recommendation by
the Congress on August % 1909. the De?
partment of State was completely rcor
ganlsed. There were created dlvlslons of
I.atln-American Affairs and of Far Eaat
?rn, Near Easterr. und Weatern European
Affairs. To these divls'.ons were ealled
from the foreign service dlplomatle and
conaular officers possesslng experience and
knowledge gained by aetual service ln
different parts of the world, and thus
famlllar with polltlcal and commerclal
condltions ln the reglons concerned. The
work waa hlghly speclallzed. The result
is that where prevlously this government
from tlme to time would emphaslze ln Us
foreign relations one or another policy.
now American Interests ln every quarter
of the globe are beinB culUvat*d with
equal as?ldulty. Thls prtnclple of polltico
jeographlcal dlvlslon poaaeaaea also the
good feature of ir.akine; possible rotatlon
between the officers of the departmental.
the dlplomatle and the consular branches
of the foreign service. and thus keeps
the whole dlplomatle and consular estab
llshments under the Department of State
ln close touch and equally lnsplred with
the aims and policy of the government.
Through the newly ereated Dlvlslon of
Information the foreign service ls kept
fully lnformed of what transplrcs from
day to day ln the internatlonal relations
of the e6untry. and contemporary foreign
at-mment affcctlng American interests la
promptly brought to the attentlon of the
department. The law offlres of the de?
partment were great Iy stremrthened.
There were odded foreign trade advlsers
to co-operate wlth the dlptomattC Bat
consular bureaus and the polltlco-geo
grnphlral dlvlsions in the tamuaerable
mattera where c-ommerrial dlplomncy or
coi.sular work call" for flttfll flPfldfll
knowledge. The same oftlcers. tocether
wlth the rest of the new orcanlzatlon.
are aMe at al! tlmes to glve to American
OttlflflOfl accurate Information as to flon*
dltlons in foreign countries with whi-h
they have business, and UkOfrlflfl tO 00*

this reorcanir.ation Without .1 trulned

LARGER PROVISION FOR
EMBASSIES AND LEGATIONS.
In connectlon with legislation for the
amelloratlon of the forflfljn service I ariah
to Invlte attention to the advlsability of
piacing the BflJary approprlationfl npoo .?
better bflfllfl. I bflUflTfl that the bflfll n
pults would be obtalned by a modernte
scale of flaJuiflfl, with ndflojontfl f'.n.is for
the orpflnocn of proper ropreflontatlon,
bflflfld la ea. ii c.'ise upon the flcalfl and cost
of llving at each post, controllcd by a sys?
tem of accountlng and under the general
direction of tlie ix-partm. nt of State.
In Une wlth the ofajoct Wbleb I have
Kought of piacing our foreign service on h
basla of permanency, I have at vaiious
tlrnea udvocated provusinn by Congrcss for
the acqulsltlon of government owr..-d
bulldlngs for the rt.ldenee and offlces of
our diplomatic olficers, so as to place thern
more nearly on an equallty wlth aimllar
officers of other natlons and to do MTfljr
wlth thfl dlscrimlnatloo whlch otherwlse
must necessailly be made in some Cflflflfl
ln favor of men havln* large private
fortunes. The act of Congrcss whlch I
approved on February 17, 1911, was a
right Btep ln this direction. The tflCM tary
of State has already made the llmited
recommendations permltted by the act for
any one year, and It Is my bOpfl that the
bill lntroduced in the House of Repre
aentatlvea to carry out these recommen?
dations will be favorably acted on by the
j OflBflJaTflflfl during Its present si-sslon.
In some Lntin-Amcri. an countries the
expense of government owned legations
?wlll be less than elsew hetc. and lt is cer
tainly very urgent that ln such countries
aa aome of the republlcs of Central Amer?
lca and the Caribbein, where lt ls pecul
iarly dtffkult to rent auitable ouarters, the
representatlves of the Unlted States ibooM
be Justly and adequately provided with
dismlfled end suitable offldal resldences.
Indeed, lt Is hlgh time that the dignity and
power of this great natlon should 1?- tlt
tlngly signallzed by proper bulldlr.gs for
the occupancy of the nation's tepresenta
tives i-veryw here iii.ioad.
DIPLOMACY AND COMMERCIAL
INTERCOURSE AND PEACE.
The dlplomary of the present admlnis
tratioa haa aought to respond to modern
Ideaa of commerclal lntercourse. This
poliey has been characterlzed as substi
tuting dolhr.i for bullets. It ls one that
?ppaala allke fi Idealirtic humanitarlan
sentlmentaj. to the dlctates of aound policy
an.l BlratQT and to le-ltlmate commerclal
alma. it ls an effort frankly dlncted to
tha llICmaa Sl Amerie_n trade upon the
axlornatle prlnelple that the go'.ernment of
the I'nlted States shall extend all proper
aapport to every lat-tfaaata and benericiai
American enterpri-e abroad. Ifow great
have been the results of this diplomacy,
coupled wiih the maximum and mlnlmum
provision of the tariff luw, will be seen
by some conslderatlon of the wonderful
lncrease in the export trade of the Unlted
States. Because BaOdern diplomacy la
cornmerelnl there has been a disposition
In aoOM quarters to attrlbute to it non**
but mat'ilalisti'- aims. How strlklnglv
erroneous ls such an lmpresslon may b?
seen from a study of the results by whlc'i
the diplomacy of the I'nited States <_n be
judired.

NECESSITY FOR

achl. v.-.l m rcmovlng prcvlously cxistlng

this feature of the law ahould be amend
ed ln such a way as to provlde a fully
effectlve means of meeting the varylng
degrees of discrlminatory treatment of
American commerce ln foreign couutrletj
atlll encountered, as well as to protect
against Injurious treatment on the part
of foreign governments, through either
leglslatlve or admlntatrative MMWeA
! the linanclal Interests abroad of American
I citlxens whose entcrprlses enlarge the
] market for American commodities.
i I cannot too strongly recommend to the
| Congress the passage of some such en
| abling measure aa the bill which was
i recommended by the Secretary of Sute
I ln his letter of Deeaaaber lt, 1911. The ob
! ject of the proposed leglslation is, ln
brlef. to enable the Executlve to apply.
' aa the case may require, to any *r all
I commodities, whether or not on the free
! list, from a eountry which dlscrliniuatc*
against the I'nlted States, a graduated
seaie of duties up to the maxlmum of 23
per cent ad valorem provided ln the pres?
ent law. Flat tarlffs are out of date. Na
tlona no longer accord equal tarlff treat?
ment to all other natlons Irrespectlve of
the treatment from them recelved. Such
a fiexlble power at the comrnand of the
L"_ecutive would serve to moderate any
unfavorable tendendes on the part of
those countrles from which the Importa
tlons into the Unlted States are substan
tlally conflned to artleles on the free 11st,
as well as of the countrles which flnd a
lucratlve market ln the I'nlted States f >r
their products under exlstlng eustoms
rates. It is very necessary that the
American jtovernment should b?? equlpped
with weapons of negotlatlon adapted to
modern economlc condltions, In order that
we may at all times be ln a position to
gain not enly technlcally Just but aetaalty
equltable treatment for our trade. and
also for American enterprlse and vested
Interests abroad.
