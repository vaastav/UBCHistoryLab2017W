Sure! High Heels
Cause Corns But
Who Cares Now
t
t
Because etyln decrees that women
crowd nnd hurklo u their tender toe a
in high heel footwear they -mffer from
corns, then they cut aid trim at. theso
painful pests which merely makes tho
' corn EIW hard. This suicidal habit
' tiay cause lockjaw end women are
', warned to stop it.
A few drops of a. drug called trw.-
one applied directly upon a aoro corn
1 gives quick relief and soon tho entiro
. corn, root and all.. lifts out. without
I pain. Ask the drug wtoro man for a
i quarter of an ounre of freo.onc, which,
j coats very little but la sufiielont to nv
j move every bard or soft corn or callua
I from one's feet.
This dm; is an ether compound and
I dries in a moment and simply shrivels
up the corn without liiltsmiiij- or even
irritating the surrounding tissue or
skin. Clip this out and pin ou your
wif.-' tircsaer.
