The opinion still prevails that at

be a rising trend to values later. This
feeling' is based upon the fact that
neither Great Britain nor France have

has made no provision whatever tor

Secretary of the Navy Josephus Dani

Hawaii and inspect the naval drydock
at Peart Harbor next March or April
following the official opening of the
Panama' canal and the expositions at
San Diego and San Francisco.
Secretary Daniels anticipates being
accompanied by a delegation of offi

made In one of the battleships of the
fleet that will carry the congressional
party and President Wilson through
the canal.
C. S. ALBERT.

"Made In Hawaii," and made by the

of this paper is off the press today.
I As a newspaper achievement, this
special supplement sets what expert
printers and engravers throughout
Honolulu agree Is a new standard of
Workmanship. Illustrated with a num
ber of pages in four-color engraving,
the printing representing the most ad
vanced methods, full of interesting
and timely reading matter, the special
edition is the worthy result of more
than nine months of labor and cooper
ation by every department of the Star-
Bulletin.
; v And it is a special edition with
purpose.
A main Dart of that purpose is to
carry a vast volume of fact and pic
ture concerning industrial Hawaii as
a striking and conclusive argument
that this territory is justifiably en
titled to an adequate protective sugar
tariff.
Never before has any publication
attempted to portray so completely
the Industrial life of Hawaii with par
ticular emphasis on the sugar indus
try. Careful staff writers have gath
ered the facts on each plantation and
in their articles show Just where
hardship and economic disaster will
be inevitable if "free sugar" comes to

Bringing full details of the plan for
reconstructing the Pearl Harbor dry-
dock, and rushing it to completion,
Walter P. Dillingham, general manager
and treasurer of the Hawaiian Dredg
ing Company, was an arrival on the
Manchuria this morning. Dillingham
has been away for more than a year,
spent for the most part in Washing
ton. D. C. on negotiations connected
with the drydock contract.
On February 17, 1913, a completed
section of the drydock "blew up
owing to upward . pressure when the
water was pumped out. From that
time until the 1st of this month work
on the great ship basin has been at a
standstill, while boards of investiga
tion and expert engineers have wrea
tied with the peculiar problems which
confront the contractors, and while ne
gotiations have been in progress 'be
tween the contractors and the federal
government as to the financial respon
sibility.
According to - Dillingham, the con
structlon scheme finally adopted has
never before been used In building dry
docks. It is the plan of the late Al

That Hawailans in San Francteco

Mr. Potter says that the Hawaiian

just before he left the coast city, and
calls attention to the fact that it had
to be constructed 'td fit Into a cerain
amount of space, and that it will be
sufficiently typical-of Hawaii as 'soon

"When I left Gordon Usborne was

"C. W. Dickey, the architect, was very
courteous and attended to many mat
ters of detail for me. The exposition
certainly Is going to be a tremendous
affair. All the work which the expo
