THE WAR IN FRANCE.
Some very severe Halting has
Leen done south cast of Paris, :::!
the Prussians have met with several
defeats, but ti.ey .tiu Lv iu cttv
verv eilectually invested; and the
f iege is likely to be continued until
fbP iVcnch vltulate. Gambetta
has annonnccd, by proclamation,
that the armv of Paladincs has been
compelled to ceasa its forward move
ment. Genernl Mjinteuffe! has beer
ordered from the north to re-inforce
the German army in front of Paris
The situation remains, practically,
the same, and the following, which
wc cMp from the Cincinnati Chroni
r will give a more correct idea of
the positions of the contending ar
mies than wo could possibly do:
The number of fortresses taken by the
Germans during tuts war amounts Already
to thirteen, t"i: Strasnourgh, Toul, Weis
aenbenr, Lutzenberg, Vitrv, La. n. Schlets
tndt, boissons. Sedan, Metz, Tnionville,
Verdun and ISew Dreisach. Six other
fortresses, including Paris, Belfort, liit
che, ttiatebnrg. Montmedy and .Mezicro.
are more or less invested. The principal
stronghholds iu the north, the rednction
of which has not yet oeen attempted, arc
Arras. Konay. Lille and Dunkirk. The
latter three places are, on the approach
of tike enemy, to be put under water, or
inundated a desperate mode of defense,
no doubt, and equally efficacious. But
considering the great potent fact that
almost all the places now in the posses
sion cf the Germans have fallen from
want of bread and powder, the different
methods of defense now attempted can
prove but little use. Ia fact the famons
systems of fortifications on the north
eastern frontier, callrd into existence in
the days of Louis XIV., and which was
so long vaunted is a masterpiece of stra
tegy, has to prove in lias war a dire
calamity for France.
Should tlie present concerted moye
r ent of the Germans toward Loire suc-
eed, there is po doabt but they will di
rect their attention to Boorges. the
principal r)ice d arme or arseual left
to France."

"This tin 'box contains the key to
this safe. If any gentleman desires
to examine the contents of the safe I
request thai he lock it up after satis

pBoM, makiug a total of 14,100 gallons
per month, or 160.200 gallons per year,
before the People's Drug Store was
opened, it was a notorious fact that ev
ery g:dlon of this vast amount of Coal
Oil was sold at from 50c. to 60?. per
gallon, and until we caroo there was no
indication of any intention to sell it any
cheaper. All dealers arc compelled to
sell at our price or retire from the mar-
Our price is JOc. per gallon.
160,200 gallons of coal oil at 50c. per
gallon would cost the peplo 884,600.
169;200 gallons of coal oil at 30c. per
gallon will cost the people $50,760.
Not amount saved to the people of
Marshall county in one year, on one ar
ticle, is 833,840. To the knowledge of!
all, there is as much of a saving to the
people un Quinine as we have above
demonstrated in Coal Oil. Twelve anil
fifteen grains of Quinine were given, in
stead of thirty grain.t, for 25c. Indigo
is another article which is largely used.
It was sold at 20c. per ounce. We sell
the best for 10 cents. These are only
samples of the inroads which we have
made upon ezhorbitant prices that were
in vogue nhen we opened. We do not
come bofove the People with vague
promises of goods cheaper than others.
We sell our goods at a tair and honest
price, and upon the facts v have ad
duced we base a claim for liberal pat-ron-g.
We know that others can,
and perhaps they will, sell at oar prices,
but we claim the preference because oar
prices are the prices fixed by our own
choice, and nut prices forced upon as
by competition. We claim the prefer
