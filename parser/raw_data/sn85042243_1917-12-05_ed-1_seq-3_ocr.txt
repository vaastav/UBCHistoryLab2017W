DEADLY ONSLAUGHTS
OF GERMANS WASTED
No Sign in Italian Theatre that
Austrians Contemplate a
New Attack.
With the British Army in France,
Dec. 5.—That Field Marshal Haig pre­
vented the Germans from breaking
through his lines on the €am'brai front
discounts the small gains which the
enemy hosts achieved yesterday at
a terrible cost in life. It means that
yesterday's critical period has been
successfully passed and that for the
second time in four days Field Mar­
shal Haig thwarted what is to be a
German attempt to duplicate the Aus
tro-German performance in Italy.
Germans were collected from the
eastern theatre and various parts of
the German line in the west. At La
Vacquerie the enemy fought his way
through the town, and one party pen­
etrated for some hundred yards into
British territory. This,,was the ex­
treme gain. The attacking forces se­
cured a very harrow strip of ground
*a little north and south of La Vac­
querie, but the British srtill clung grim­
ly to the high ground north of this
place.
The British commander voluntarily
pulled back his line to the west and
southwest of Masnieres to make it
firmer. This morning the British line
was near the western part of Marco
ing Copse, but included Marcoing, a
small triangular piece of territory,
therefore has been sacrificed by the
British. Since 8 o'clock last night the
line has remained unchanged.
A heavy concentration of German
guns east of Gonnelieu suffered great­
ly by the excellent British counter
battery work. Things appeared much
brighter in the British camp this
morning. The battle probably has not
yet run its course, but the defenders
from now on will be in much better
shape to handle the situation.
AMERICA'S WAR PURPOSES.
President Wilson in a message to
congress that is regarded as one of
the most momentous declarations in
American history, again has enunciat­
ed, but more strongly than before,
America's purpose in the war.
He also asked congress to declare
war on" Austria Hungary, the chief
ally of Germany, but failed to include
in his request Turkey and Bulgaria,
Germany's other allies, declaring that,
they were "mere tools, and do not yet
stand in the direct path of our neces­
sary action."
The president reasserted that Ger­
man power as. now constituted must
be crushed and that then, when the
German people have spokesmen whose
words can be believed, "we shall be
willing and glad to pay the full price
for peace and pay it ungrudgingly."
"Let there be no misunderstanding,
the president said. "Our'present afad
immedaite task is to win the war, and
nothing shall turn us aside from it un­
til it is accomplished. Every power
and resource we possess, whether of
men, or money, or of materials, is be
iftg devoted and will continue to be
devoted to that purpose until it is
achieved."
Hun Sacrifice* Cease.
The Germans, apparently, have
ceased the reckless expenditure of
lives of their troops in trying to blot
out the Cambrai salient held by Gen­
eral Byng's forces. After four days
of onslaughts that have been charac­
terized as equalling atoy previously
witnessed during the war, only the
artillery now is engaged. Although
the Germans claim the capture of
more than 6,000 British prisoners
their attacks and also more than 100
guns, reports from the scene of bat­
tle, both from the British war offi,ce
and from correspondents, have indi­
cated that the German loss in men
killed, wounded or made prisoner was
a terrible price to pay for the very
small recovery of lost terrain.
while It Is expected further attacks
will be delivered on the Cambrai sec
torr, which is a salieint vitally men­
acing to the important railroad junc­
tion of Cambrai, with its highways
and railroads radiating in all direc­
tions as feeders to the German lines
north and south, the British troops are
declared not to be in a better posi­
tion to offer stronger resistance to
their efforts, it such ft thing is pos­
sible, than heretofore.
Astro-Germans Quiet.

the Austro-Germans of their infantry

Aneta, N. D., Dec. 5.—Miss Aagot
llaaen, Steele county superintendent
of schools, lay pinned under her over­
turned Ford car for two hours before
a traveling medicine vender chanced
along and with the aid of a lifting
jack raised the machine sufficiently
to relieve her of the weight, which
was slowly but surely crushing the
breath from her body. Miss Raaen
whs by this time bleeding freely from
the nose and mouth, and, finding that
he could not release her unaided, the
peddler was forced to proceed some
distance to obtain help. When the
car was righted Miss Raaen found
herself in condition to proceed on her
journey, and, unless some internal in­
jury should develop, fehe will be none
the worse for her terrifying experi­
ence.

Eugene M. Walla, clerk in the auto­

secretary of state's office, was arraign­
ed in district court this morning on
a charge of embezzlement, to which
he pleaded not guilty. Thomas Hall,
secretary of state, bound over to dis­
trict court on the same charge, will
be arraigned Thursday morning, his
counsel being unable to apear today.
The state announced today that the
Hall case will go on immediately after
the trial of Henry Pankow, charged
with murder, begun this morning, and
that the Walla case will be tried at
the conclusion of Hall's trial.
The entire morning was consumed
in drawing a jury for the Pankow
murder case, first on the criminal
court calendar.

W. S. and William Hamilton of Bow­
man, comprising 1% sections of good
farming and grazing land.
(Continued from Pass One)
not wifh~tfie~former Difficulty~piled
upon difficulty, and much as he hoped
to avoid it, the president was forced
to realize: that Austria was being used
by Germany in the United States as
an active enemy and that nothing less
than a declaration of war would clear
the situation and leave the govern­
ment perfectly free to carry on the
war with Germany in the most effec­
tive manner.
Spy System Austrian.
The German spy system in the Unit­
ed States today is known to be man­
ned largely by subjects of Austria
Hungary, many of them members of
the Industrial Workers of the World,
and the recent attempts of that organ
iaztion to hamper the government's
war preparations are traceable to the
German system.
American secret service men fouqd
the trails of the notorious on Papen
and Boy-Ed leading through the Aus­
trian consular service in this coun­
try. Every turn of the government to­
ward combatting the German espion­
age system found evidences of how
Germany was using Austria.
Members of congress and many ad­
ministration officials, realizing the sit­
uation, have for months urged a dec­
laration of war.
SUSPECTS ARRESTED.
Washington, Dec. 5.—Scores of Aus
tria-Hungarian subjects suspected of
being enemy agents in this country
will be arrested within a few hours af­
ter declaration of war against Aus­
tria. Many of these men have been
under surveillance by repartment of
justice agents foor months, but have
not been taken into custody because
of lack of definite evidence against
them.
When congress adopts President
Wilson's recommendation that a state
of war against Austria-Hungary be de­
clared, unnaturalized subjects of the
dual monarchy automatically will be­
come enemy aliens and be subject to
summary arrest and internment.
For months government ajgents have
been gathering information on the
hostile activities of Austrians, who
were hot subject to the restrictions
imposed on unnaturalized Germans by
the state of war with Germany, and
those caught in illegal acts were ar­
rested and tried under the usual crim­
inal statutes. Many others were free
to travel and obtain information val­
uable to America's enemies, however,
while keeping their conduct technical­
ly within the law.
Department of justice officials were
pleased today over the president's
recommendation for legislation to ex­
tend enemy alien restriction to wom­
en, some of whom are suspected of
being clever aids to the German es­
pionage system, and to authorize more
drastic punishment for active alien
enemies, such as penitentiary impris­
onment and hard labor.

royal Austro-Hungarian governments
and that the president be, and he is
hereby authorized and directed to em­
ploy the entire naval and military
forces of the United States and re­
sources of the government to carry
on war against the imperial and royal
Austro-Hungarian government and to
bring the conflict to a successful ter­
mination all the resources of the coun­
try are hereby pledged by the con­
gress of the United States."
In the house the war resolution was
brought out by Chairman Flood of
the foreign affairs committee. The
committee itself had been called to
meet this afternoon to formally act
upon the resolution and return it to
the house for passage. The senti­
ment for including Turkey and Bul­
garia! in the list of recognized ene­
mies persisted and there was promise
of some attempts to amend the reso­
lution.
The committee of both houses, how­
ever, will be guided by the state de­
partment in the language of the reso­
lution, and if the administration has
its way, as it probably will. Turkey
and Bulgaria will be left for the time
when they come directly in the path
of America's action against Germany,
as the president expressed it in his
address yesterday.
Wlhile congress is working on the
actual declaration of war, the execu­
tive departments of the governments
are setting in motion the machinery
which will make the declaration ef­
fective.
The departmnet of justice began
taking steps for disposition of the
great number of new alien enemies
the war declaration will create. The
Many aliens are Czechs, Bohemians
and others of the races which have
been oppressed by the Austro-Hun
garians. Many of them to join the
fight, for freedom of their countrymen
and realization of national aspiration
have joined the American army, waiv­
ing exemptions they might. have
claimed as aliens. It is evident that
some sort of an exception will be
made for them, as the government
hardly wishes to treat them as ene­
mies and still wislies to protect itself
as far as possible.
The department of labor, which hat
custody of alien civilians classed as
enemies also was making its prepa­
rations to care for them as may be
necessary.
Senator Stone of Missouri, one of
the original "wilful 12" and stout op­
ponent of the government's war
plans until war actually was declared,
will pilot the Austrian war resolution
through the senate as spokesman for
th° administration.
Since war actually was declared on
Germany, Senator Stone repeatedly
has announced that the government
has his full and unequivocable sup­
port and the administration was so
pleased with his attitude that it was
decided that, as chairman of the for­
eign relations committee he should
have charge of the Austrian war reso­
lution. Senator Hitchcock, the next
democrat of the committee, handled
the German war resolution.

job is much more diilicult than it
was in the case of Germany. There
are in the United States many sub­
jects of Austria-Hungary who are op­
posed to that government and sympa­
thize with the cause of the United
States.
Outlining a legislative program in

Kitchin said legislation should be con­
fined as far as possible to appropria­
tions and war measures, but that
woman suffrage and prohibition con­

against that government, was intro­

Eternal Triangle Makes
Work For Burleigh Court
In Case Front Anamoose
When Henry Pankow shot Charles
Borchert in the former's ranch home
near Anamoose on May 29 of thia year
the devil chopped another notch in
his trusty "eternal triangle," and more
business was made for the December
term of the Burleigh -county district
court, where Henry Pankow, brought
here on a change o* venue, was placed
on trial at 10 o'clock this morning for
murder.
Borchert died a day or two after
Uhe shooting, in spite of surgical at­
tendance which Pankow rushed to his
home immediately after he had fired
the fatal shot. The tragedy caused
much excitement about Anamoose,
where all of the parties were well
known.
Pankow for some time had suspect­
ed Borchert of being an unwelcome
suitor for Mrs. Pankow's affections.
Bad blood had existed. Borchert for
a while left the community. The
night of the tragedy he came back
and about 11:30 called at the Bor­
chert home. Pankow's friends claim
that nearby was waiting an automo-|
bile in which Borchert hoped to carry
'Mrs. Pankow away. Tljere were wcrd3.1
Borchert entered the Pankow he.
and a moment later fell bad:, hits
lungs riddled with r.hot from n. T'.n
in Henry Pankow's Pankow
drove post-haute to town, procured at­
tendance for the wounded man and
then gave himself up. Neighlor: went
his bond. Borchert lingered a few
days and died. A charge of murder
was preferred against Pankow.
Today or tomorrow Mrs. Pankow
will go on the stand and lay bare her
part in this tragedy. None but she,
and possibly Attorney F. J. Funke,
counsel for the defense, know just
what her story will be. She will be
the only witness for the defense. Her
husband is relying upon her story to
send him from the court room a free
man. The state—F. Temple, the
Sheridan county prosecutor, having
called Assistant Attorney General
Daniel V. Brennan and all of his
forces to his aid, has marshalled an
army of witnesses in an effort to send
Henry Pankow from the dingy Bur­
leigh county court rpom to the peni­
tentiary, a mile distant, to expiate the
crimo of which they hold him wil­
fully guilty.
Finlayson Up Again.
Frank Finlayson, who has pending
in supreme court two appeals from
penitentiary sentences for violation of
the liquor laws, was arraigned this
morning on still another charge, to
which he pleaded not guilty. Finlay­
son is defendant in a second action
set for trial at this term in which
he is charged with preventing a wit­
ness from attending court. Involved
in this same matter are John Farrand,
charged with contempt of court, and
Will'""" Johnson and William Olson,
chin jd wivh perjury, who will be
trknl at this term.
The case against Frank Way, also
charged with perjury has been con­
tinued, the defendant now serving in
