TO CHEER DISABLED HEROES
All Legion Potta to Join In Campaign
to Aid World War Man In
Hospitals.
Mora than 2,000,000 men In almost
10,000 American Lesion poets In all
parts of the United Statea and Its pos
sessions bare been enlisted In a cam
paign to make life more worth living
to some 20,000 sick and disabled
heroes of the World war who still are
patients In government and private
hospitals and to humanize all activi
ties that enter Into their care and
treatment. Government bureaus at
Washington have supplied the Legion
with lists of these hospitals, about
,200 In number, and the number of
ex-service men who are patients In
each. The country has been districted
according to I.egjon membership and
each of the five national vice com
manders of the Legion has been as
signed to supervise the work of Le-
rion posts, committees and Individuals
la various states. A plan to take a
census of all ex-service men, especial
ly those still In hospitals, and straight
en out their compensation and insur-
ance claims, Is Included In the general
progrtm. The full weight of the worn
en's tuxillary of the Legion will also
be trrown behind the movement and
the isslstance of all loyal Americans
Is bring asked for and gladly accepted,
"These men In hoapltala are our
first concern," F. W. (Jalbralth, Jr.,
national commander of the Legion,
said recently, "and the situation with
regtrd to them Is far from satisfac
tory. They are coming to believe, and
Juitly to a large extent, that their
country has forgotten them. Their
greatest need la a friendly handclasp,
rteerful smile and an unqualified and
oft-repeated demonstration that we
lave not forgotten them and will
sever forget them while God gives us
strength to stand four-square with
and behind them so long as they need
our help. It's not our Job alone It's
everybody's Job but It's Just a little
closer to the hearts of men and wom
en of the Legion."
The Legion tukes the position thnt
the maimed World war heroes repre
sent America's fundamental obligation
and that the Legion, backed by the
full weight of sound public opinion,
can make conditions with regard to
them as nearly perfect as human
agencies will permit.
WHAT POST WILL ADOPT HER?
Little French Orphan Whose Father
Was Killed In Defending Verdun
From the Boche.
Little Denise Selller Is now ten years
old. She was six when her father was
killed defending Verdun from the
boche. Denise once was the adopted
daughter of the American civilian em
ployees of the Central printing plant,
at 17 Kue de l'Aqueduc, Paris. Now
the Americans have gone home and
Denise nnd her Invalid mother, her lit

It very hard to make ends meet.
Many posts of the American Legloii
already have followed the suggestion
of national headquarters and have con
tributed $75 to cure of a French or
phan for a year. Perhaps some of the
former foster-fathers of Denise, now
members of a Legion post, may see
this and readnpt her. Any Legion post

CASH BONUS PLAN FAVORED
Referendum Laws Adopted by New
York, New Jersey, Washington
and South Dakota.
Four more states adopted referen
dum laws providing for the payment
of a cash bonus to veterans of the
World war at the elections on Novem
ber 2, following a well organized cam
paign by American Legion posts nnd
various civic organizations. The states
were: New York, $10 a month, $2.riO
maximum; New Jersey, $10 a month,
$100 maximum; Washington, $15 a
month fur service up to November 11,
1!)19, nnd South Dakota, $15 a month.
Twelve states, which supplied 1,000,-
000 men to the army, have now grant
ed the cash compensation. In addi
tion to the four named above, the cash
bonus states are; Massachusetts, $100,
plus $10 a month to Januury 1.1, 1918;
Vermont, $10 a month, maximum of
12 months; New Hampshire, $100;
Minnesota, $15 a month, maximum of
$100; Wisconsin, $10 a mouth, mini
mum of $"0; Hhoile Island, $100;
North Dnkotu, $25 a month, and
Maine. $100.
In New York the bonus rode to vic
tory by a majority of more than a
million ; the vote in Washington was
three to one In Its favor, while In New
Jersey and South Dakota the Legion
naires were successful by lurge mar
gins. National officials of the Legion con
tend that the bonus referendum show
conclusively that the people of the
I'nlted States favor compensation for
ex-service men and they propose to re
double their efforts to obtain the pas
sage of the Legion's fourfold nation

ENDOWMENT FUND PLANNED
Paris (France) Poet Begin Drive to
Raise Large Sum to Aid Ex
Service Men.
The Paris (France) post of the
American Legion has started drive
for a Ave million-franc endowment
fund with which to meet the demand
made upon It dally by ex-service men
who are stranded, and by their famil
ies. Tbe Paris post has beea kept
busy helping former ret whe were
ick, straightening out legal tangles,
securing employment and helping tbe
stranded to get passage home.
Tbe Paris post Is obviously barred
from utilizing the usual method of
raising funds by entertainment for the
community, and has beea forced to ap
peal to the outside. Tbe American
embassy and tbe consulate seml-offi-clally
recognize the post's work by re
ferring hundreds of case to Its officers.

Over In France where the men who

post of the organization. With 837

One of the chief benefits rendered
by the Paris post has been in the way
of obtaining employment for honora

men were placed In tMsiih,ns during
the first seven weeks of the post's

Western Newspaper L'nlon Nuwe Service,
Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil
on sent his fiiiul regular message to
Congress today to tlio two Houses by
messenger.
The text of President Wilson's Dies
sage follows :
"When I addressed myself to per
funning the duty laid upon the Presi
dent by the constitution to present, to
you tin it mi nit I report on the state o
the union 1 found myself dominated
by an linnim-tiil sentence of Abraham
Lincoln's: 'Let us have faith that
right makes might, and in that failh
let us dare to do our duly as we un
dciMnnd it,' u .sentence immortal lie
cause it eniiHiiiies In a loini or. utter
simplicity nnd purity the essential
stale of the nation, tlio faith in which
it was conceived uml the faith in which
It has grown to glory and to power.
With that faitii and the birth of n na
tion founded upon it came the hope
into the world that u new order would
prevull throughout the affairs of man
kind, nn order In which reason, und
right would take precedence of covete-
ousuesg and force, and I believe that
I express the wish and purpose of
every thoughtful American when I say
thut this sentence marks for us In the
plainest manner the part we should
play alike in the arrangement of our
domestic affairs and in our exercise
of Influence upon the uffairs of the
world.
Victory Accomplished by Faith.
"I?y this faitii and by this faith alone
can the world bo lifted out of Us pres
ent confusion unci despair. It was this
failh which prevailed over tlio wicked
force of (ieruiany. You will remember
that the lieuiniiiiij; of the end of the
war came when the (Jerinan people
found themselves face to face with the
conscience of the world and realized
that right was everywhere arrayed
against the wrong that their govern
ment was attempt Ins to perpetrate, I
think, therefore, that it is true to say
that this was the faith which won the
war. Certainly this is the faith Willi
which our gallniit meu went into the
field anil out. trpoii the seas to make
sure of victory.
"This Is the mission upon which de
mocracy catne into the world. Democ
racy Is an assertion of the right of the
individual to live and lo be treated
Justly ns against any attempt on the
part of any coiuliiiiaiion of Individuals
to niiike laws which will overburden
him or which will destroy his equality
milling ins leiiows In the matter of
right or privilege, and I think we all
realize that the day has come when
democracy is being put upon its final
test.
Democracy Should Prevail.
"The old world is just now suffer
ing from a wanton rejection of llu
principle of democracy and n substan
tial! f the principle of autocracy as
asserted in the name, but w il bout tin
iiiitliorily and sanction of the miilli
tiiilo. This is Hie time of nil other.-
when democracy should prove lis pur
ity nnd Its spiritual swer to prevail
it is surely the manifest destiny of
tile Puiled Slates to lead in the at
tempt lo make this spirit prevail.
"There are two ways in which the
rnited States can assist to iKCoinplish
this great object r First, by offering
Hie example within her own borders
of Hie will uml power of democracy to
make and enforce laws which are un
questionably Just mid which are equal
in their administration laws which
secure its full right lo labor and yet
nt the same time safeguard the integ
rity of property and particularly i.r
that property which Is devoted to the
development of industry and the In
crease of the necessary wealth of the
world. Second, liy standing for right
nnd justice as toward individual na
tions. Urge Protection of Weak.
"The law of democracy Is for the
protection of the weak and the infill
ence of every democracy In the world
should lie fur the protection of the
ik nation, the nation which Is strug
gling towards its right and towards its
proper ntngnitlon and privilege in the
family of nations.
Iho United States cannot refuse
this role of champion without putting
the stigma of rejection upon the great
und devoted men who brought Its gov

sltlon and intrigue, even in the face of

Save Much Tims In Hauling Material
to and From Farm Big Draw
back I Poor Roads.
According to an investigation into
the wurtli ami service of motor trucks
on eustorn furniH, specialists in the
United States licpurtmcut of Agricul
ture find that motor tracks, as com
pared to horses and wagons, last year
saved from one-half to two-thirds of
the time required for hauling mate
rials to and from the farms. This In
formation was gleaned from study of
reports from 75.'! farms, Bnd they
showed further that trucks ranging In
size from one-half ton to live tons
were In use, with about half of tlieiu
of the one ton size.
An interesting fact obtained from a
study of these reports Is that about
one-fourth of those reporting! have
changed their markets for at least a
part of their produce. Instead of
patronizing their old markets at an
average distance or seven miles from
home, they go to better markets lo-,
cnted at an average distance of 20
miles away. Iniring the year these,
trucks traveled an average of 'J.S'M
miles at costs ranging from eight
cents a ton mile for the one-halt ton
trucks to 'JO cents a ton mile for thu
two ton size.
The average cost of hauling crops,
with the driver's time valued at 50
cents un hour amounted, to 50 cents a
ton mile with half ton trucks, 34 cents
for three-fourths ton trucks and de- '
creasing to IS cents a ton mile for tho
two ton kind. Along with these costs,
four-fifths of those reporting stated
that their trucks decreased their ex
pense for hired help, this decrease
averaging $324 a year.
The principal disadvantage of the
motor truck, uccordlng to this investi
gation, was poor roads. It Is stated
that there are about eight weeks dur-
