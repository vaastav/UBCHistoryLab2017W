TUii financial standing of the
,ii iho present time is oxci-Ueiit,
and 1 ]n» tin:in'i il management of the na
tion's iiuenats by the government during
the last seven years has shown the most
satisfactory rosulin. But our uriency
system is imperfect, and it is earnestly
to ho hoped that the currency commis
sion will be able to propose a thoroughly
good system which will do away with
the existing dofucts.
During the seven yearn and three
months there has been a net surplus of
nearly one hundred millions of receipts
over expenditures, a reduction of the
iutere.-?t bearing- debt by ninety millions,
in spite of the extraordinary expense or
the Panama canal, and a saving of near
ly n'r* millions nn the annual interest
charge. This is an exceedingly satisfac
tory showing, especially in view of the
fact that during this period the nation
has never hesitated to undertake any
expenditure that it regarded as neces
sary. There have been no new taxes and
no increases of taxes on the contrary,
some taxes have been taken off there
has been a reduction of taxation.
Corporations.
As regards th« givai corporations en
gaged In inu*is uie business, and espe
cially the raliuads, can only repeat
what I have already again and again
said in my messages to tne congress. 1
believe that under the interstate clause
-of the constitution the United States
has complete and paramount right to
control all agencies of Interstate com
merce, and 1 believe that the national
government alone can exert ise this right
with wisdom and effectiveness so a
a
both
to secure Justice from, and to do justice
to, the great corporations which are the
most important factors in modern busi
ness. I believe that it is worse than folly
to attempt to prohibit all combinations
as is done by the Sherman anti-trust
law, because such a law can be enforced
only Imperfectly and unequally, and its
enforcement works almost as much hard
ship as good. I strongly advocate that
Instead of an unwise effort to prohibit
all combinations, there shall be sub
stituted a law which shall expressly per
mit combinations which are in the inter
est of the public, but shall at the same
time give to some agency of the national
government full power of control and
supervision over them. One of the chief
features of this control should be secur
ing entire publicity in all matters which
the public has a right to know, and fur
thermore, the power, not by judicial but
by executive action, to prevent or put a
-stop to every form of improper favoritism
or other wrongdoing.
The Railroads.
The railways the country should be
put completely under the interstate com*
mcrce commission and removed from the
domain of the1 anti-trust law. The power
of the commission should be made thor
oughgoing, so [hat it couid
t-Aervise
com­
plete supervision and control over the
issue of securities as well as over the
raising and lowering of rates. As regards
rates, at least, this power should be
summary. The power to investigate the
financial operations and accounts of the
railways has been one of the most val
uable features in recent legislation.
Power to make combinations and traffic
agreements should be explicitly conferred
Upon the railroads, the permission of the
commission being first gained and the
combination or agreement being published
In all its details. In the interest of the
public the representatives of the public
should have complete power to see that
the railroads do their duty by the public,
and as a matter of course this power
should also be exercised so as to see that
no injustice is done to the railroads.
The shareholders, the employes and the
shippers all have interests that must be
guarded. It is to the interest of all of
them that no swindling stock specula
tion should be allowed, and that there
Should be no improper issuance of se
curities.
The guiding intelligences necessary for
the successful building and successful
management of railroads should receive
Timple remuneration but no man should
be allowed to make money in connection
with railroads out of fraudulent over
capitalization and-kindred stock gambling
performances there must be no defraud
ing of Investors, oppression of the farm
ers and business men who ship freight,
or callous disregard of the* rights and
needs of the employes. In addition to
this, the interests of the shareholders, of
the employes, and of the shippers should
all be guarded as against one another.
To give any one of them unduo and im
proper consideration is to do injustice to
the others.
Rates must be made as low as is com
patible with giving proper returns to all
the employes of the railroad, from the
highest to the lowest, and proper returns
to the shareholders: but they must not,
for instance, be reduced In such fashion
•es to necessitate a cut in the wages of
the employes or the abolition of the
proper and legitimate profits of honest
^shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies en
gaged" in interstate business should be
put under the jurisdiction of the Inter
state Commerce commission.
APPEAL TO PEOPLE.

It 1c very tarr.ostly to be wished that
our p'ople, through their representatives,
should act in th :s matter. Tt Is hard to
pay whether most 1 :'na^c to the Country
at largo would come from entire failure
•on the part of the public to supervise
and control the actions of the great coi
tions, or from the exercise of the
.-:iry governmental power in a way

corporations. l-:oth the preachers of
unrestricted Individualism, and th

deny to abi- men of business the just re
ward of their initiative and business sa
gacity are advocating policies that would
bo fr-a ught with the gravest harm to the
whole country, 'l'o permit every lawless
capitalist, every law defying corporation,
to take any action, no matter how in
iquitous, in the effort to secure an im
proper profit and to build up privilege,
would be ruinous to the republic and
would mark the abandonment of the ef
fort to secure in the industrial world the
spirit of democratic fair dealing. On the
other hand, to attack these wrongs in
that spirit of demagogy which can see
Wrong only when committed by the man
of wealth, and Is dumb and blind in the
presence of wrong committed against
men of property or by men of no prop
erty, is exactly as evil as corruptly to
defend the wrongdoing of men of wealth.
The war wc wage must be waged against
misconduct, against wrongdlong wherever
It Is' found: and we must stand heartily
for the rights of every decent man,
whether ho bo a man of great wealth or
a man who earns his livelihood as a
wage worker or a tiller of the soil.
It Is to the interest of all of us that
there should be a premium put upon
Individual initiative and individual capac
ity and an ample reward for the great
directing inteljlgences alone competent to
manage the great business operations of
today'. It is well to keep In mind that
exactly as the anarchist is the worst
enemy of liberty and the reactionary the
•Worst enemv of order, so the men who
defend the rights of property have most
to fear from the wrongdoers of great
wealth and the men who are champion
ing popular rights have most to fear from
the demagogues who In the name of pop
ular rights would do wrong to and oppress
honest business men, honest men of
wealth for the success of either type of
wrongdoer r.cccssarlly invites a violent
reaction against the cause the wrong
doer nominally upholds. «i point of dan
ger to the nation there Is nothing to
choose between on the one handu the cor
ruptionlst, the bribe giver, fno bribe
taker, the man who employs his great
talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a
large scale, and, on th» other hand, the
preacher of class hatred, the man who,

being for in the long run, under the
mere pressure of mate-rial distress, the
p«-op!y as a whole would probably go back

ualism rather than submit to a control

ei-Motived in a spirit of such unreason
able and narrow hostility to wealth, as

ing profitable, and therefore to bring
ruin upon the entire business community,
and Uitiinatelv upon tho entire body of
citizens.
Tho opposition 10 government control
cf thes.' great corporations makes its
nuou effeeiivo effort in the shape of nn
appeal to the old doctrine of states'
rights, of cuurse, there are many sincere
men who now believe in unrestricted Indi
vidualism in business. Just as iheie were
formerly man sincere men who believed
in .slavery—that Is, in the unrestricted
right of an individual to own another
individual. These men do not by them
selves have great weight, however. The
effectivo fight against adequate govern
ment control and supervision of indi
vidual, and especially of corporate,
wealth engaged in interstate business is
ehielly done under cover and especially
under cover of an appeal to states' rights.
It is not at all infrequent to read in the
same speech a denunciation of predatory
wealth fostered by special privilege and
defiant of both the public welfare and
law of the land, and a denunciation of
centralization in the central government
of the power to deal with this centralized
and organized wealth. Of course, tho
lKlicy set forth in such twin denuncia
tions amounts to absolutely nothing, for
the first half is nullified by the second
half.
Basis of Union.
The chief reason, among tho many
ound and compelling reasons, that led
the formation of tne national govern
ment, was the absolute need that the
union, and not the several states, should
deal with interstate and foreign com
merce and the jK)\ver to deal with intei
state commerce was granted absolutely
and plenarily to the central government
and was exercised completely as regards
tho only instruments of Interstate com
known in those days—the water
ways, the highroads, as well as the part
nerships
of
individuals who then con­
ducted all of what business there was.
Interstate commerce is now chiefly con
ducted by railroads and the great cor
poration has supplanted the mass of
small partnerships or individuals. The
proposal to make the national govern
ment supreme over, and therefore to give
it complete control over, the railroads
and other instruments of interstate com
merce Is merely a proposal to carry out
to the letter one of the prime purposes,
if not the prime purpose, for which the
constitution was founded. It does not
represent centralization. It represents
merely the acknowledgment of the patent
fact that centralization has already come
in business.
If this irresponsible outside business
power is to be controlled in the interest
of the general public it can only be con
trolled in one way by giving adequate
power of control to the one sovereignty
capable of exercising such power—the
national government. Forty or f0 sep
arate state governments can not exercise
that power over corporations .doing busi
ness in most or ali of them first, be
cause they absolutely lack the authority
to deal with Interstate business in any
form and secono, because of the inev
itable conflict of authority sure to arise
in the effort to enforce different kinds of
state regulation, often inconsistent with
one another and sometimes oppressive in
themselves. Such divide.! authority can
not regulate commerce with wisdom and
effect. The central government is the
only power which, without oppression,
can nevertheless thoroughly and ade
quately control and supervise the large
corporations.
To abandon the effort for national con
trol means to abandon the effort for all
adequate control and yet to render likely
continual bursts of action by state legis
latures, which can not achieve the pur
pose sought for, hut which can do a
great deal of damage to tho corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
Corporations See Mistake.
I believe that the more farsigiited cor
porations are themselves coming to rec
ognize the unwisdom of the violent hos
tility they have displayed during the last
few years to regulation and control by
the national government of combinations
engaged in interstate business. The truth
is that we who believe in this movement
of asserting and exercising a genuine
control. In the public interest, over these
great corporations have to contend
against two sets of enemies, who, though
nominally opposed to one another, are
really allies in preventing a proper solu
tion of the problem. There are, first, the
big corporation men, and the extreme
individualists among business men, who
genuinely believe in .utterly unregulated
business—that is, in the reign of plu
tocracy and, second, the men who, being
blind to the economic movements of the
day, believe In a movement of repression
rather than of
regulation
of corporations,
and who denounce both the power of the
railroads and the exercise of the federal
power which alone can really control the
railroads. Those who believe in efficient
national control, on the other hand, do
not in the least object to combinations
do not In the least object to concentra
tion in business administration. On the
contrary, they favor both, with the all
Important proviso that there shall be
such publicity about their workings, and
such thoroughgoing control over them,
as to insure their being in the interest,
and not against the interest, of the gen
eral public. We do not object to the
concentration of wealth and administra
tion but we do believe in the distribution
of the wealth in profits to the real own
ers, and in securing to the public the full
benefit of the concentrated administra
tion. We believe that with concentra
tion in administration there* can come
both "the advantage ol' a larger owner
ship and of a more equitable distribution
of profits, and at the same time a better
service to the commonwealth. We be
lieve that the administration should be
for the benefit of the many and that
greed and rascality, practiced on a large
scale, should be punished as relentlessly
as if practiced on a small scale.
We do not for a moment, believe that
the problem will be solved by any short
and easy method. The solution will come
onlv by pressing various concurrent rem
edies. Some of these remedies must lie
outside the domain of all government.
Some must lie outside the domain of the
federal government. But there is legis
lation which the federal government
alone can enact and which is absolutely
vital in order to secure the attainment of
our purpose. Many lq.ws are needed.
There should be regulation by the na
tional government of the great inter
state corporations, including a simple
method of account keeping, publicity,
supervision of the issue of securities,
abolition of rebates and of special privi
leges. There should be short time fran
chises for all corporations engaged in
public business including the corpora
tions which get power from water rights.
There should be national as well as state
guardianship of mines and forests. The
labor legislation hereinafter referred to
should concurrently be enacted into law.
Use the Power.
To accomplish this, means of course a*
certain increase in the use of—not the
creation of—power, by the central gov
ernment. The power already exists it
does not have to be created the only
question is whether it shall be used or
left Idle—and meanwhile the corporations
over which the power ought to be exer
cised will not remain idle. Let those who
object to this increase in the use of the
only power available, the national power,
be frank, and admit openly that they pro
pose to abandon any effort to control the
great business corporations and to exer
cise supervision over tho accumulation
and distribution of wealth for such su
pervision and control can only come
through this particular kind of increase
of power. We no more believe in that
empiricism which demands absolutely un
restrained individualism than we do
that, empiricism which clamors for
deadening socialism which would destroy
all individual Initiative and would ruin
the country with a completeness that not
even an unrestrained individualism itself
could achieve.
in
The danger to American democracy lies
not in the least in the concentration of
administrative power In responsible and
accountable hands. It lies In having the
power insufficiently concentrated, so that
no one can be held responsible to the
people for its use. Concentrated power
is palpable, visible, responsible, easily
reached, quickly held to account. Power
scattered through many administrators,
many legislators, many men who work
behind and through legislators and ad
ministrators, Is Impalpable, is unseen. Is
irresponsible, can not be reached, can not
be held to account. Democracy is in
peril wherever the administration of po
litical power iw scattered among a va
riety of men who work in secret, whose
very names are unknown to the common
people. It Is not In peril from any man
who derives authority from tho people,
who exercises it In sight of the people,
and who Is from time to time compelled
to give an account of its exercise to the
people.
THE LABOR PROBLEM.
There are many matters affecting l&bor
and the status of the wage worker to
which I should like to draw your atten
tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the
problem in all Its aspects Is not now
necessary, This administration is near
ing its end and, moreover, under our
form of government tho solution of tho
problem depends upon the action of the
states as much as upon the action of tho
nation. Nevertheless, there are certain
considerations which I wish to set before
you. because 1 hope that our people will
more and more koep them In mind, A
blind and lgn«"*ant resistance to every
effort for tin- reform of abuses and for
the readjustment of society to modern
industrial conditions represents not true
conservatism but an Incitement to tho
wildi.st radicalism for wise radicalism
and wise conservatism go hand in hand,
one bet progress, the other bent on
seeing that no change is made, unless in
the right direction. 1 belluve in steady
effort, or pwhaps it would be more ac
curate to »ay in steady efforts in many
different directions, to bring about a con
dition of affairs under which the men who
work with hand or with brain, the labor
ers, the superintendents, the men who pro
duce for the market and the men who
find a market for the articles produced,
shall own a far greater share than at
present of the wealth they produce, and
be enabled to Invest it in the tools and
instruments bv which all work is carried
on.
As far as possible 1 hope to see a frank
recognition of the advantages conferred
by machinery, organization, and division
of labor, accompanied by an effort to
bring about a larger share in the owner
ship by wagu worker of railway, mill and
factory, in farming, this simply means
that we wish to see the farmer own his
own land: we do not wish to see the
farms BO large that they become tho
properly of absentee landlords who farm
them by tenants, nor yet so small that
the farmer becomes like a Kuropean
peasant. Again, the depositors In our
savings banks now number over one
tenth of our entire population. These
are all capitalists, who through the sav
ings banks loan their money to the work
ers—that is. In many cases to them
selves—to carry on their various indus
tries. The more we increase their num
ber, the more we introduce the principles
of co-*»pt«ration into our industry. Every
increase in the number of small stock
holders in corporations is a good thing,
for the same reasons and where the
employes are the stockholders the result
is particularly good. Very much of this
movement must be outside of anything
that can be accomplished by legislation
but legislation can do a good deal. Post
al savings banks will make it easy for
the poorest to keep their savings in
absolute safety. The regulation of the
national highways must be such that
they shall serve all people with equal
justice.
Corporate finances must be supervised
so as to make it far safer than at pres
ent for the man of small means to in
vest his money in stocks. There must
be prohibition of child labor, diminution
of woman labor, shortening of hours of
all mechanical labor stock watering
should be prohibited and stock gambling
so far as is possible discouraged. There
should be a progressive inheritance tax
on large fortune?. Industrial education
should bo encouraged. As far as pos
sible we should lighten the burden of
taxation on the small man. We should
put a premium upon thrift, hard work,
and business energy but ttffesc? qualities
cease to be the main factors In accumu
lating a fortune long before that for
tune readies a point where it would be
seriously affected by any inheritance tax
such as I propose. It is eminently right
that the nation should fix the terms upon
which the great fortunes are inherited.
They rarely do good and they often do
harm to those who inherit them in their
entirety.
Protection for Wage Workers.
The above lb the merest sketch. Hardly
even a sketch in outline, of the reforms
for which we should work. Hilt there is
one matter with which the congress
should deal at this session. There should
no longer be any paltering with the ques
tion of taking care of the wage workers
who, under our present industrial system,
become killed, crippled, or worn out as
part of the regular incidents of a given
business. The majority of wage workers
must have their rights secured for them
by state action but the national govern
ment should legislate in thoroughgoing
and far reaching fashion not only for all
employes of the national government, but
for all persons engaged in interstate
commerce. The object sought for could
be achieved to a measurable degree, as
far as those killed or crippled are con
cerned, by proper employers' liability
laws. As far as concerns those who have
been worn out, I call your attention to
the fact that definite steps toward pro
viding old age pensions have been taken
In many of our private industries. These
may be indefinitely extended through
voluntary association and contributory
schemes, or through the agency of sav
ings banks, as under the recent Massa
chusetts plan. To strengthen thes*» prac
tical measures should be our Immediate
duty it is not at present necessary to
consider the larger and more general
governmental schemes that most Euro
pean governments have found themselves
obliged to adopt.
Pending a thoroughgoing Investigation
and action there is certain legislation
which should be enacted at once. The
law, passed at the last session of tho
congress, granting compensation to cer
tain classes of employes of the govern
ment, should he extended to include all
employes of the government and should
be made more liberal in its terms. There
is no good ground for the distinction
made in the law between those engaged
in hazardous occupations and those not
so engaged. If a man Is injured or killed
in any line of work, it was hazardous in
his case. Whether one per cent or 10
per cent of those following a given occu
pation actually suffer injury or death
ought not to have any bearing on tho
?t
uestion of their receiving compensation,
Is a grim logic which says to an
injured employe or to the dependents of
one killed that he or they are entitled to
no compensation because very few people
other than he have been injured or killed
in that occupation. Perhaps one of the
most striking omissions in the law is
that it does not embrace peace officers
and others whose lives may be sacrificed
in enforcing the laws of the United
States. The terms of the act providing
compensation should be made more lib
eral tnan in the present act. A year's
compensation is not adequate for a wage
earner's family In the event of his death
by accident in the course of his employ
ment. And in the event of death
occurring, say, 10 or 11 months after the
accident, tho family would only receive
as compensation the equivalent of one
or two months' earnings. Tn this respect
the generosity of the United States
towards its employes compares most un
favorably with that of every country in
Europe—even the poorest.
I renew my recommendation made in
a previous message that half holidays be
granted during summer to all wage work
ers in government employ.
I also renew my recommendation that
the principle of the eight hour day should
as rapidly and as far as practicable be
extended to the entire work being carried
on by the government the present law
should be amended to embrace contracts
on those public works which the present
wording of the act seems to exclude.
THE COURTS.
I most earnestly urge upon the congress
the duty of increasing the totally inad
equate salaries now given to our Judges.
On the whole, there is no body of publio
servants who do as valuable work, nor
whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate
compared to their work. Beginning with
the supreme court the Judges should have
their salaries doubled. It Is not befitting
the dignity of the nation that its most
honored public servants should be paid
sums so small compared to what they
would earn In private life that the per
formance of public service by them
implies an exceedingly heavy pecuniary
sacrifice.
It is earnestly to bo desired that some
method should be devised for doing away
with tho long delays which now obtain
in tho administration of Justice, and
which oporate with peculiar severity
against persons of small means, and fa
vor only the vory criminals whom It is
most desirable to punish. These long de
lays In tho final decisions of cases make
in the aggregate a crying evil and a
remedy should be devised. Much of this
intolerable dolay Is due to improper re
gard paid to technicalities which are a
mere hindrance to Justice. In some noted
recent cases this over regard for techni
calities has resulted in a striking denial
of Justice, and flagrant wrong to the
body politic.
At the last election certain leaders of
organized labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire Judiciary
of the country, an attack couched In such
terms as to Include the most upright,
honest and broad minded judges, no less
than those of narrower mind and more
restricted outlook. It was the kind of at
tack admirably fitted to prevent any sue*
ceqsful attempt to reform abuses of the
judiciary, beoauac gave the champions

The cavalry arm should be reorganized
Upon modern lines. This is an arm in
which it is peculiarly necessary that the
field officers should not be old. The cav
alry Is much more difficult to form than
Infantry, and it siinuhl be kept, up to t!u
maximum both in efficiency and iti
strength, for it cannot be made in a
hurry. At present both infantry and ar
tillery are too few in number for our
n»-eis. Kspeclal attention should be paid
lo development of the machine gun. A
Reneral service corps should be esrab
ilshed. As things are now, the average
soldier has far too much labor of a non
nilitary character to perform.
National Guard.
Now that tile organized militia, the Na
tional Guard, hits been incorporated with
the army as a part of the national forces,
it behooves the government to do every
feasonable thing in its power to perfect
Its efficiency. It. should ho assisted In its
Instruction and otherwise aided more lib
erally than heretofore. The continuous
services of many well trained regular
officers wUl bo essential in this connec
tion. Such officers must be specially
trained at service schools best to qualify
them as instructors of the National
Guard. But the detailing of officers for
training at the service schools, and for
iluty with the National Guard entails de
taching them from their regiments, which
are already greatly depleted by detach
ment of officers for assignment to duties
prescribed by acts of the congress.
A bill is now pending before the con
gress creating a number of extra officers
In the army, which if passed, as it ought
to be, will enable more officers t'o be
trained as instructors of National Guard
and assigned to that duty. In case* of
«var it will bo of the utmost importance
to have a large number of trained officers
to use for turning raw levies into good
troops.
There should be legislation to provide
a complete.- pian for organizing the grenl
body of volunteers behind the regular
army and national guard when war has
?ome. Congressional assistance should be
given those who are endeavoring to pro
mote riflv practice so that our men, in
the services or out of them, may know
how to use the rifle. While teams repre
senting the United States won the rifle
and revolver championships of the vorld
against all comers in England this year,
It i«] unfortunately true that the great
body of our citizens shoot less and less
as time goes on. To meet this, wc should
encourage rifle practice among school
boys, and indeed, among all classes, as
well as in the military services, by every
means In our power. Thus, and not
otherwise, may we Wfe- able to assist in
preserving the peace of the world. Fit to
hold our own against the strong nations
of the earth, our voice for peace will
carry to the ends of the earth. Unpre
pared, and therefore unflt, we must sit
dumb and helpless to defend ourselves,
protect others, or preserve peace. The
first step—in the direction of preparation
to avert war if possible, and to be fit for
war if it should come—is to teach our
Tien how to shoot.
Tho Navy.
approve the recommendations of the
general board for the Increase of the navy,
railing especial attention to the need of
additional destroyers and colliers, and
above all, of the four battleships. It is
desirable to complete as soon as possible
a squadron of eight battleships of the best
existing type. The North Dakota, Dela
ware, Florida and Utah will form the first
divlson of this squadron. The four ves
sels proposed will form the second divi
sion. It will be an imurovement on tho
first, the hips being of the heavy, single
caliber, all big gun type. AH the vessels
should have the same tactical qualities,
that is, speed and turning circle, and as
near as possible these tactical qualities
should be the same as is in the four ves
sels before named now being built.
I most earnestly recom^'id that the
general board be by law turned into a gen
eral staff. There is literally no excuse
whatever for. continuing tho present bu
reau organization of the navy. The navy
should be treated as a purely military or
ganization, and everything should be sub
ordinated to the one object of securing
military ef lcir*ncy. Such military effi
ciencv can only be guaranteed In time of
war if there Is the most thorough previous
preparation in time of pence—a prepara
tion. 1 may add, which will In all proba
bility prevent any need of war. The sec
retary must lie supreme, and ho should
have as his official advisers a br
fe
,y
of lino
officers who should themselves have the
power to pass upon and coordinate all the
work and all tho proposals of the several
bureaus. A system of promotion by mer
it, either by selection or by exclusion, or
by both processes, should be Introduced.
It is out of the quest-ion, if the present
principle of promotion by mere seniority is
kept, to expect to get the best results from
the higher officers. Our men come too
old. and stay for too short a time, in the
high command positions.
Two hospital ships should be provided.
The actual experience of the hospital ship
with the fleet in the Pacific has shown the
invaluable work which such a ship does,
and has also proved that it is well to have
it kept under the command of a medical
officer. As was to be expected, all of the
anticipations of trouble from such a com
mand have proved completely baseless.
It is as absurd to put a hospital ship under
a line officer as it would bo J^o put a hos
pitals on shore under such ^••"•cGYrtmand.
Tliis ought to have be«n realized before,
and there Is no excuse for failure to real
ize it now.
Nothing better for the navy from every
standpoint has ever occurred than the
cruise of the battle fleet around the world.
The improvement of the ships in every
way has been extraordinary, and the.
have gained far more experience in battle
tactics than they would have gained if
they had stayed in the Atlantic waters
The A rnerican people have cause for pro
found Kratification. both In view of the
excellent condition of the fleet as shown
by this cruise, and In view of the Improve
ment the cruise worked tn this al
ready hlxh condition. I do not believe that
there Is any other servlcc in the world
In which the average of character and
efficiency In the enlisted men Is as high as
Is now the ease In our own. I believe that
the same statement can- he made as to our
officers, taken as a whole: but there must
be reservation made in regard to those In
the highest ranks—as to which I have al
ready spoken—anil i:i resrard to those who
have just entered the service: because we
do not now get full benefit from our ex
cellent naval school at Annaiwlls. It Is
absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as
ensigns to keep them for two years in
such an -anomalous position as at present
the law requires Is detrimental to them
and to the service. In the academy Itself
every first classman should be required ii.
turn to serve as petty officer and officer
his ability to discharge his duties as such
should be a pre-retjuisltc to his going Into
the line, and his success in commanding
should largely determine his standing at
raduatiou. The board of visitors should
appointed In January, and each mem
ber should he required to give at least six
days' service, only from one to three days
to be performed during June week, which
Is the least desirable time for the board to
be at Annapolis so far as benefiting the
navy by their observations is concerned.
Theodore Roosevelt.
The White House, Tuesday, December
of the unjust Judge their eagerly Jesired
opportunity to shift their ground 'Co a
championship of Just Judges who Vvere
unjustly assailed. Last year, before Mo
liouso committee on tho Judiciary, thetV*
same labor leaders formulated their de
mands, specifying tho bill that contained
theiu, refusing all compromise, stating
wished the principle of [hat bill or
they
nothing.
They Insisted on a provision
that In a labor dispute no Injunction
should Issue except to protect a property
right, and specifically provided that the
right to carry on business should not be
construed an a property right ami in «t
second provision their bill made lejtal in
a labor dispute any act or agreement by
or between two or more persons that
would not have been unlawful if done bv
a single J.erson, In other words, this bill
legalized blacklisting and boycotting In
every form, legalizing, for Instance, tnose
forms of secondary boycott wMeh the
anthracite coal strike commission so un
reservedly condemned: while the right to
curry on a business was explicitly taken
out from under th:it protection which tho
law throws over property. The demand
was made that there should be trial by
Jury In contempt ciises, thereby most
seriously Impairing the authority" of the
courts. All this represented a course of
policy which, If carried out, would mean
the enthronement of class privilege In its
crudest and most brutal form, and the
destruction of one uf tho most essential
functions of the judlcUrv in ail civilized
lands.
Attack Too Crude,
Tho violence
Of
the crusade COT this leg­
islation, and Us complete failure. Illus
trate two truths which It Is essential our
people should learn. In the first place,
tliey ought to tench the worklngman. the
laborer, the wageworker, that by de
manding what is Improper and impossible
ho plays into tho hands of his foes. Such
a crude and vicious attack upon the
courts, even If It were temporarily suc
cessful, would Inevitably in the end cause
a violent reaction and would band the
great mass of citizens together, forcing
them to stand by all the Judges, com
petent and incompetent alike, rather than
to see the wheels of Justice stopped. A
movement of this kind can ultimately re
sult in nothing but damage to those in
whose behalf It is nominally undertaken.
This is a most healthy truth, which It is
wise for all our people to learn. Any
movement buftcd on that (lass lullieM
which at times assumes the name of
"Class consciousness" is certain ulti
mately to fall, and If It temporarily suc
ceeds, to do far reaching damage. '"Class
consciousness," where it is merely an
other name for the odious vice of class
selfishness. Is equally noxious, whether In
nti employer's association or In a wnrli
lngman's association. The movement In
question was one in which the appeal
was made to all worklngmen to vote
primarily, not as American citizens, but
as individuals of a certain class In so
ciety. .Such an appeal in the first place
revolts tho more high minded and far
sighted among the persons to whom it is
addressed, and In the second place tends
to arouse a strong antagonism among all
other classes of citizens, whom it there
fore tends to unite against the very or
ganization o"n whose behalf it is Issued.
Tho result Is therefore unfortunate
from every standpoint. This healthy
truth, by the w*y, will be learned by the
socialists If they ever succeed In estab
lishing in this country an important na
tional partv based on such class con
sciousness ind selfish class Interest.
The wageworkers, the workingmen, the
laboring men of the country', by the way
In which they repudiated the effort to
get them to cast their votes in response
to an appeal to class hatred, have em
phasized their sound patriotism and
Americanism. The whole country has
causo to feel pride in this attitude of
sturdy Independence, tn this uncompro
mising insistence upon acting simply as
good citizens, as good Americans, with
out regard to fancied—and improper—
class Interests. Such an attitude is nn
object lesson In good citizenship to the
entire nation.
Reactionaries Should Pause.
But the extreme reactionaries, the per
sons who blind themselves to the wrongs
now and then committed by the courts on
laboring men, should also think seriously
as to what such a movement as this xor
tends. Tho Judges who have shown them
selves, able and willing effectively to
check tho dishonest activity of the very
rich man who works Iniquity by the mis
management uf corporations, who have
shown themselves alert to do justice to
the wageworker, and sympathetic with
the needs of the mass of our people, so
that the dweller In the tenement houses,
tho man who practices a dangerous trade,
tiie man who Is crushed by excessive
hours of labor, feel that their needs are
understood by the courts—these Judges
are the real bulwark of Lhe courts: these
Judges, the Judges of the stamp of the
president-elect, who have been fearless
in opposing labor whim it has gone
wrong, but fearless also In holding to
strict account corporations that work
iniquity, and far sighted In seeing that
the workingman gets ills rights, are tho
men of all others to whom we owe it that
the appeal for such violent and mistaken
legislation has fallen on deaf ears, that
the agitation for its passage proved to be
without substantial basis.
The courts are Jeopardized primarily by
the action of these federal and state
Judges who show inability or unwilling
ness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of
very rich men under modern industrial
conditions, and inability or unwillingness
to give relief to men of small means or
wageworkers who are crushed down by
these modern Industrial conditions: who,
In other words, fail
tn
understand and
apply the needed remedies for th* new
wrongs produced by the new and highly
complex social and Industrial civiliza
tion which has grown up In the last half
century.
The rapid changes in our social and In
dustrial life which have attended this
rapid growth have made it necessary
that, in applying to concrete cases tho
great rule of right laid down in our con
stitution, there should be a full under
standing and appreciation of the new
conditions to which the rules are to be
applied. What would have been an
infringement upon liberty half a century
ago may be the necessary safeguard of
liberty today.
Unworthy Judges..
The chief lawmakers in our country
may be, and often are, the Judges, be
cause they are the final seat.of authority.
Every time they lnterprot contract, prop
erty, vested rights, due process of law,
liberty, they necessarily enact Into law
parts of a system of social philisophy
and as such Interpretation Is fundament
al, they gfvo direction to all law making.
The decisions of the courts on economic
and social questions depend upon their
economic and social philosophy and for
tho peaceful progress of our people during
the twentieth century we shall owe most
to those Judges who hold to a twentieth
century economic and social philosophy
and not to a long outgrown philosophy,
which was itself the product of primitive
economic conditions. Of course, a Judge's
views on progressive social philosophy
are entirely second In Importance to his
possession of a high and fine character
which means the possession of sUc.'i ele
mentary virtues as honesty, courage and
fairmindedness. The Judge who owes his
olectlon to pandering to demagogic senti
ments or class hatreds and prejudices
and the Judge who owes either his elec
tion or his appointment to tho money or
the favor of a great corporation, ore
alike unworthy to sit on the bcnch. are
alike traitors to tho people and no pro
fundity of legal learning, or correctness
of abstract conviction on questions of
public policy, can serve as an offset to
such shortcomings. But It Is also true
that Judges, like executives and legis
lators, should hold sound views on the
questions of public policy which are of
vital Interest to the people.
The legislators and executives are chos
en to represent the people in enacting and
administering the laws. The Judges ure
not chosen to represent the people in this
sense. Their function Is to Interpret the
laws. The legislators are responsible for
tho laws the Judges for the spirit in
which they Interpret and onforce the
laws. Wo stand aloof from the reckless
agitators who would make the Judges
mere pliant tools of popular prejudice
and passion and we stand aloof from
those equally unwise partisans of reac
tion and privilege who deny the proposi
tion that. Inasmuch as Judges are chosen
to serve the interests of the whole people
they should strive to find out what tho-e
interests are, and. so far as they consci
entiously can, should strive to give effect
to popular conviction when deliberately
body expressed by the lawmaking
The courts are to be highly commended
and staunchly upheld when they set their
faces against wrongdoing or tyranny bv
they arfi to
be blamed
when they fall to recognize under a gov
ernment like ours the deliberate Judg
ment of the majority as to a matter of
legitimate policy, when duly expressed by
thi ®urh lawfully expressed
and deliberate Judgment should be given
effect by the courts, save in the extreme
and exceptional cases where there has
Deen a clear violation of Constitutional
provision. Anything like frivolity or
wantonness In upsetting such clearly tak
en governmental action Is a grave offense
against the republic. To protest against
tyranny, to protect minorities from op
pression, to nullify an act committed in
a spasm of popular fury, Is to render a
service to the republic.
But for the courts to arrogate to them
selves functions which properly belong to
the legislative bodies is all wrong, and in
the end works mischief. The people
should not be permitted to pardon evil
and slipshod legislation on the theory
that the court will set it right they
should be taught that the right way to
get rid of a bad law is to have the legis
lature repeal It. and not to have tfce
couirts by Ingenious hairsplitting nullify
It. A law may be unwise and Improper
but It should not for these reasons be
declared unconstitutional by a strained
interpretation, for tho result of such ac
tion is to take away from tlie people at
large their sense of responsibility and
ultimately to destroy their capacity for
,\rderly self restraint and self govern
ment. Under such a popular government
as ours, founded on tho theory that in
the long run tho will of the people Is
suprvme, the ultlmato safety of the na
tion ctan only rest In training and guid
ing tli« peoplo so that what they will
tol ^Ii r:„-ht, and
net
!n devlslnor means
to defeat their will by the technicalities
of stralnivl construction.
People to Blame.
For many of iho shortcomings of Jus
tice In our country our pcopio as a whole
aro themselves to blame, and the judges
and Juries merely bear their share together
with the public as a whole. It Is discred
itable to us us a people that there should
be difficulty In convicting murderers, or in
bringing to Justice men who as public
servants have been guilty of corruption,
or whet have protited by the corruption of
public servants. The result is equally un
fortunate, whether due to hairsplitting
technicalities In the interpretation of law
by judges, to sentimentality and class
consciousness on the part of Juries, or
to hysteria and sensationalism In the
dally press^
Ileal damage has leen done by the
manifold conflicting Interpretations
of the interstate commerce law. Control
over trie great corporations doing inter
state business can be effectivo only If It
Is vested with full power in an adminis
trative depnrtment, a branch of the fed
eral executive, carrying out a federnl
law: It can never be effective if a divided
responsibility is left in both th*1 states
and the nation: it can never be effective
If left in the hands of the courts to be
decided by lawsuits.
The courts hold a place of peculiar and
deserved sanctity under our form of gov
ernment. Itespei't for the law is essen
tial to the permanence of our Institu
tions: and respect for tho law Is largely
conditioned upon respect for the courts.
Tt is an offense against the republic to
say anything which can weaken this re
spect, save for the gravest reason and
In the mnst carefully guarded manner.
Our Judges should be held in ieeu]inr
honor: and the duty of respectful and
truthful comment and criticism, which
should be binding when we speak of any
body. should lie cs|M'clalIy binding when
we speak of them.
•f CONSERVATION
4- OF RESOURCES
Shortsighted persons, or persons blinded
to the future by desire to make money in
every way out of the present, sometimes
speak as If no great damage would bo
'lone by the reckless destruction of our
forests. It Is difficult to have patience
with the arguments of these persons.
Thanks to our own recklessness in the
use of our splendid forests, we have al
ready crossed the verge of a timber fam
ine In this country, and no measures that
we *iow take can,- at least for many
years, undo the mischief that has already
been done. But we can prevent further
mischief being done and would bo In
the highest degree reprehensible tp let
any consideration of temporary conveni
ence or temporary cost Interfere with
such action, especially as regards the
national forests which the nation can
now, at this very moment, control.
Inland Waterways.
Action should be begun forthwith, dur
ing the present session of the congress,
for tho Improvement of our inland water
ways—action which will result in giving
us not only navigable but navigated
rivers. Wo have spent hundreds of mil
lions of dollars upon theae waterways,
yet the traffic on nearly all of them is
steadily dc.'lning. This condition Is the
direct result of the absence of any com
prehensive and far-seeing plan of water
way improvement. Obviously we cannot
continue to thus expend the revenues of
the government without return. It is
poor business to spend money for inland
navigation unless we get It.
Inquiry Into the condition of the Missis
sippi and its principal tributaries reveals
very many Instances of tho utter waste
caused by the methods which have hither
to obtained for the so-called "improve
ment" of navigation. A striking instance
Is supplied by the "Improvement" of the
Ohio, which begun In 1824, was continued
under a single plan for half a century, in
1S7G a new plan was adopted and followed
for a quarter of a century. In 1902 still
a different plan was adopted and has
since been pursued at a rate which only
promises a navigable river In from twen
ty to one hundred years longer.
Such shortsighted, vacillating, and fu
tile methods are accompanied by decreas
ing water-borne commerce and Increasing
traffic congestion on land, by increasing
floods, and by the waste,, of public money.
The remedy lies in abandoning tho meth
ods which have so signally failed and
adopting new ones In keeping with the
needs and demands of our people.
Until tho work of river improvement is
undertaken in a modern way it can not
havo results that will meet the needs of
this modern nation. These needs should
bo met without further dilly-dallying or
delay. The plan which promises the best
and quickest results is that of a perma
nent commission authorized to co-ordinate
the work of ail government departments
relating to tho waterways, and to frame
and supervise the execution of a compre
hensive plan. Under such a commission
the actual work of construction might be
entrusted to the reclamation service or
to the miltary engineers acting with a uif
flcient number of civilians to coiitinuelhe
work in time of war or it might be di
vided between the reclamation service
and the corps of engineers. Funds should
be provided from current revenues If it
Is deemed wise—otherwise from the sale
of bonds. Tho essential Thing Is that the
work should go forward under the best
possible plan, and with the least poslblo
delay. We should have a new type of
work and a new organization for planning
and directing it. The time for playing with
our waterways is past. The country de
mands results.
National Parks.
I urge that all our national parks ad
jacent to national forests be placed com
pletely under the control of the forest ser
vice of the agricultural department. In
stead of leaving them as they now are,
under the interior department and policed
by tho army. The congress should provide
for superintendents with adequate corps
of first class civilian scouts, or rangers,
and further, place the road construction
under the superintendent instead of leav
ing It with the war department. Such a
cliartgo In park management would result
In economy and avoid the difficulties of
administration which now arise from hav
ing the responsibility of care and protec
tion divided between different depart
ments. The need of this purpose Is pecul
iarly great in Yellowstone park. This,
llko the Yosemite, is a great wonderland,
and should be kept as a national play
ground. In both ail wild things should be
protected, and the scenery kept wholly
unmarred.
I am happy to say that I have been able
to set aside In various parts of the coun
try, small, well chosen tracts of ground
to serve as sanctuaries and nurseries for
wild creatures.
t.
DEPARTMENT MATTERS.
It has been my purpose from the begin
ning of my administration to take the
Indian service completely out of the at
mosphere of political activity, and there
has been steady progress toward that end.
The last remaining stronghold of politics
in that service was the agency system,
which had seen its best days and was
gradually failing to pieces from natural
or purely evolutionary causes, but, like
all such survivals, was decaying slowly
In IS# later stage*. It seems clear
-f
If there is any one duty which more
thun another we owe It to our children
and our children's children to perform
at once, it Is to save the forests of this
country, for they constitute the first and
most lnipotlant element in 1 lie conserva
tion of the natural resources of the coun
try. There are, of course, two kinds of
natural resources. One Is the kind which
can only bo used us part of a process of
exhaustion: this Is true of mines, natural
oil and gas wells, and the like. The
other, and of course ultimately by far
the most lmportunt. Includes the re
sources which can be Improved In the
process of wise use: the soil, the rivers,
and the forests come under this head.
Any really civilized nation will BO use all
of these three great national assets that
the nation will have their benefit In the
future. Just as a farmer, after all his
life making his living from his farm,
will. If he is an expert farmer, leave It as
an asset of increased value to hlB son,
so -we should leave our national domain
to our children. Increased in value und
not worn out. There are small sections
of our own country, in the Bast and in
the West, in the Adirondacks, the White
-Mountains, and the Appalachians, and In
the Rocky mountains, where we can al
ready see for ourselves the damage In
the shape of permanent injury to tho soil
and the river systems which comes from
reckless deforestation. It matters not
whether this deforestation is due to the
actual reckless cutting of timber, to the
fires that Inevitably follow such reckless
cutting of tlmher, or to reckless and un
controlled grazing, especially by the great
migratory bands of sheep, the unchecked
wandering of which over the country
means destruction to forests and disaster
to the small home makers, tho settlers
of limited means
that tt#
extinction had better be made final now,
so th££ the ground can fee shared tof
larger constructive work en behalf of
the Indiaoa, preparatory te their induo*
tlon into rbe full measure ef responsible
citizenship. On November 1 enljr it ace#»
cies were left on the reftter: with tw«
exceptions, where some tegoJ questional
seemed to stand temporarily in the
theae have been changed te superintend*
encies, and their heads breaght into tkl
classified civil service.
Postal 8aving* Banks.
I, again renew my recommendation tot
postal savings banks, for depositing sav#
logs with the security of the government
behind them. The object to to encourage)
thrift and economy in the. wage-earner an{
person of moderate means. In fourteen
states the deposits In savings banks as re«
ported to the comptroller of the currenc*
amount to $3,590,245,402, or 98.4 per cent of
the entire deposits, while in the remaining!
3U states there aro only t70,S08,&t?, or l.fl
per cent, showing conclusively that ther®
are many localities In the United States
where sufficient opportunity Is not given
to the people to deposit their savings. Tha
result is that money Is kept In hiding an#
unemployed. It is believed that in the ag
gregate vast sums or money would b«
brought into circulation through the InJ
strumentality of the postal savings banks
While there are only 1,453 savings banks!
reporting to tho comptroller there are trior®
than 61,000 postofflees, 40,00# of which aret
money order offices. Postal savings banks
are now in operatloi in practically all thw
great civilized countries witk the excep
tion of the United States.
Parcels Post
In my last annual message I commend*
ed tho postmaster general's recommenda*
tlon for an extension of the parcel post oq
the rural routes. The establishment of H,
local parcel post on rural routes would b#
to the mutual benefit of the farmer anf
the country storekeeper, and it is desir*
able that the routes, serving more thait
15,000,000 people, should be utilized to the
fullest practicable extent. An amend*
ment was proposed in tho Sonate at
last session, at the suggestion ef the post
master general, providJng that, for th«|
purpose of ascertaining the p»»etlcablllty
of establishing a special local parcel post
system on the rural routes threaghout th^
United States, the postmaster general D®
authorized and directed to experiment and
report to the congress the result of suclj
experiment by establishing a special local
parcel post system on rural delivery
routes In not to exceed four counties in
the United States for packages at fourth^
class matter originating on a rural routd
or at tho distributing postoffice for deliv
ery by rural carriers. It would seem only
proper that such an experiment should be
tried in order to demonstrate the practica
bility of tho proposition, especially as Uia
postmaster genera] estimates that the rev
enue l'roin the operation of such a system
on all the rural routes WOD)4 amount to
many million dollars.
Education.
The share that the national government
should take in the broad work of educa
tion has not received tho attention and tha
care it rightly deserves. The tmmedlat®
responsibility for the support and improve
ment of our educational systems and in
stitutions rests and should always rest
with the people of the several states act
ing through their state and* local govern
ments, but the nation has an opportunity
in educational work which must not b*
lost and a duty which should no longer*
be neglected.
The national bureau of education was
established more than 40 years ago. With
the limited means hitherto provided, it
has rendered efficient service, but the con
gress ha3 neglected to adequately supply
the bureau with moans to meet the educa
tional growth of the country.
I earnestly recommend Siat this unfort*
unate state of affairs as regards the naxt
tlohal educational office be remedied by
adequate appropriations. This, recommen
dation Is urged by the representatives of
our common schools and great state uni
versities and the leading educators, wbo
all unite In requesting favorable consider
ation and action by the congress upon thlM
subject.
Census.
I strongly urge that the request of thai
director of the census In connection with
the decennial work so soon to be begun, b#
compiled' with and that the appointment^
to the census force be placed under tha
civil service law, waiving the geographical
requirements as requested by the director
of the census. The supervisors and enu
merators should not be appointed under
the civil service law, for the reasons given
by the director. I commend to the con
gress the careful' consideration of the ad
mirable report of the director of the cen
sus, and I trust that hiB recommendation*
will be adopted and immediate action
thereon taken. ,.f
Publio Health.
The dangers to public health from food
adulteration and from many other sources,
such as the menace to the physical, mental
and moral development of children from
child labor, should be met and overcome.
There are numerous diseases, which ar*
now known to be preventable, which are.
nevertheless, not prevented. The recent
international congress on tuberculosis haa
made us painfully aware of the Inade
quacy of American public health legisla
tion. This nation cannot afford to lag be
rbeln
pl(
crolcoplc foes of mankind, nor ought
hind in the world-wide battle now belnJE
waged by all civilized people with the mP
longer to ignore the reproach that this
government takes more pains to protect
the lives of hogs and of cattle tnan or
human beings. The first legislative step to
be taken is that for the concentration of
the proper bureaus into one of the existing
departments. I therefore urgently recom
mend the passage of a bill which shall au
thorize a redistribution of the bureau*
which shall best accomplish this ecdj
Two New 8tates.
XT*1"'
I advocate the Immediate admission of
New Mexico and Arizona as states. This
should be done at the present session of
the congress. The people of the two ter
ritories have made it evident by their
votes that they 'will not come in as one
state. The only alternative is to admit
them as two, and I trust that this will be
done without delay.
AFFAIRS OF STATE.
This nation's foreign policy is based on
the theory that right must be done be
tween nations precisely as between indi
viduals and in our actions lor the last ten
years we have In this matter proven oup
faith by our deeds. We have behaved,,
and our behaving to.vard other nations,
as in private life an honorable man would
behave towards his fellows.
Panama Canal.
The work on the Panama canal is being1
done with a speed, efficiency and entire
devotion to duty, which make it a model
for all work of the kind. No task of such
m&gnituuc ima every uciorsisccn undertake
en by any nation and no task of the kind
has ever been better performed. Themenon
the Isthmus, from Colopel Goethals and
his fellow commissioners through the en
tire list of employees who are faithfully
doing their duty, have won their right to
the ungrudging respect and gratitude of
the American people.
The Philippines.
Real progress toward self government i»
being made In the Philippine islands. Thft
gathering of a Philippine legislative body
and Philippine assembly marks a procesa
absolutely new In Asia, not only as re
gards Asiatic colonies of Kuropean pow
ers but as regards Asiatic possessions of
other Asiatic powers and, indeed, always
excepting the striking and wonderful ex
ample afforded by the great empire of
Japan, It opens an entirely new depart
ure when compared with anything which
has happened among Asiatic powers which
are their own masters. Munerto this Phil
ippine legislature has acted with modera
tion and self-restraint, and has seemed
in practical fashion to realize the eternal
truth that there must always be govern
ment, and that the only way in which any
body of Individuals can escape the nec
essity of being goverr.eil by outsiders is to
show that they are able to restrain them
selves. to keep down wrongdoing and dis
order.: The Filipino people, through their
officials, are therefore making real steps
In the direction of telf-guvernmenL. I
hope and believe that these steps mark
the beginning of a course which will con
tinue till the Filipinos become fit to de
cide for themselves whether they desire
to be an Independent nation.
I again recommend that American citi
zenship be conferred upon the people of
Porto Rico.
In Cuba.
In Cuba our occupancy will cease la
about two months' time the Cubans have
in orderly manner elected their own gov
ernmental authorities, and the Island will
be turned over to them. Our occupation
on this occasion has lasted a tittle over
two years, and Cuba has thrives and pros
pered under it. Our earnest hope and
one desire is that the people of the island'
shall now govern themselves with justice,
so that peace and order may be secure.
ARMY AND NAVY.
As regards the army I call attention to,
the fact that while our Junior ef4cera and
enlisted men stand very high, the present,
system of promotion by seniority rssulta.
in bringing into the higher
