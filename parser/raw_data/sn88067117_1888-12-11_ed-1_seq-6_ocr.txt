TARIFF REFORM THE SAME
OLD WATCHWORD.
Congress Listened Spell-Bound to
His Words.
Various Quest'ons of Public Pol cy
Are i iscussed.
Washington, December U,—The Fiftieth
congress assembh and for its secmd and final
session at noon to-day. Long before that,
hour the galleries began to fill and at 11 :S0
nil but the diplomatic and executive
galleries were, crowded. The executive
gallery was empty. As the hands of
the big senate clock moved on to
'he meridian mark the chamber rapidly
filled with members, and a general hand
shaking was going on in all of the aisles.
At 13 o'clock Senator Ingalls entered the
•chamber, escorting the chaplain, Mr. B.it
li r. When the gavel descended there were
forty-two senators present.
Mr. Butler’s piayer was Uriel. He asked
for blessings on the president aud pivsi
, dent-elect. At the conclusion of the pray. r
Mr. Ingalls announced the senate m set
aion. Mr. Sherman offered a resolution in
structing the secretary to notify the house
that the senate w as ready for the transaction
■of business. Tlio resolution was adopted.
Under a resolution offered by Mr. Morrill
and adopted, the president pro tern ap
pointed Mr, Morrill and Mr. Salisbury a
Jommlssiou to notify the president.
*jfhe senate then went into formal
rcess to await the president’s message.
For ful.y an hour before Speaker Car
lisle, at If’o’eloek to-day, struck his desk
with a brand new gavel and called
the housi to order, a scene was
presented on the Hour which
was highly noisy and mirthful. The desks
-d the members were nearly all occupied,
tad each tjmn talked to the other in a loud
tone of voice, explaining the election in
cidents _,ttnd accidents. There was
(inch iLndshatuiig. When Mr. Randal!,
lookinglairly well, entered and took his
seat, adfow minutes before 12 o’clock, he
was immediately surrounded aud heartily
congratulated upon his convalescence.
MGs. Cleveland and her mother, Mrs. Fol
/nn, occupied the front seat of the diplo
matic gallery. Other galleries were filled
to overflowing.
After the blind chaplain, Rev. W. 11. Mii
hurn, liad offered supplication and the
reading clerk began to call the roll of the
house, the members recommenced their
•chatter, continuing it. while the secretary
of the senate was announced and tvadf.be
ah noun ement that the upper h tly of
congress had reassembled, was ready
for business, and had appointed a
smituittae to act with a similar committee
hi the part of the house to wait upon and
notify Inc president that congress awaited
his pleasure. Messrs. Holman of Indiana,
O’Neill of Pennsylvania, ahd Turner of
Oeorgia were appointed members of the
committee to notify the president, and the
house took a recess till 1:150 p. m.
The President's Message,
To the Congress of the Vnitetl Stales:
As you assemble lor the discharge of the
duties you have assumed as the representa
tives ol a free and generous people, your
meeting is marked by an interesting ami
impressive incident. With the expiration
ot the present session of the congress, the
first century of our constitutional existence
is a nation will be complete.
Our survival lor one hundred years is
’oat, sufficient to secure us, but we no longer
Have dangers to fear in the maintenance,
with all its promised blessings, of a gov
ernment founded upon the freedom of the
people. The time rather admonishes us to
soberly Inquire whether in the past we
have always closely kept in the course of
safety, and whether we have before us a
way plain and clear which leads to happi
ness and prosperity.
When the experiment of our government
was undertaken, the chart adopted for our
guidance was the constitution. Departure
from the linn there laid down is failure. It
lx only by a strict adherence to the direc
tion they indicate and by restraint within
the limitations they fix that we can furnish
proof to the world of the fitness of the
Agoprlwu people for self government.
The equal aiul exact justice of which we
boast as the underlying principle ol our
Institutions should uot be confined to the
delations of our citizens to each oilier. The
government itself is under bond to the
American people, that in the exercise of its
functions ami powers it will deal with Hie
body of our citizens in a manner scrupu
lously honest and fair and absolutely just,
has -creed that American citizen
. I lie the only credential nec
m j- j t ji tfy the claim of equality be
j3 .i.h. , and that no condition iu life

% 'jfc.n.l *t lie people by their govern-
SittU
T* *f <*it republic *>•
nnysrv-n'iy n-us,ea upon mu compliance
with the letter of this bonds, and saw
l-tre'ching nut before him a clear field for
j .dividual endeavor. His tribute to the
Mipiori of his government was
Pleas..r and by the cost of Us
i oomisircal maintenance, and he was so
li are in the ' ujoymeiit of the remaining
recompense of his steady and contented
i toil In those days the frugality of the
; people was stamped upon their govern-
I moot, d.n.l was enforced by the free,
thoughtful and intelligent suffrage of the
citizen, combinations, monopolies, and ag
gregations of capital were iiilier avoided
or sternly regulated and restrained. The
pomp and glitter of governments less free,
offered no temptation and presented ao de
lusion to rim plain people who, side by side
In friendly competition wrought for
Ihe cun' bleiuent and dignity of
man for the solution of the problem of free
) ovornment and for the achievement of the
grand d.-ainy awaiting'the land which
trod hud tiven them. A century has
passed and cities are the abiding places of
Wealth end luxury; our manufactories
yield fortunes never dreamed of by the
I fathers of the republic; our business men
are madly striving in the race for riches
find immense aggregations of capital out
i ltin the imagination in the magnitude of
| l eir mid rtakinis.
We view with pride and satisfaction this
bright picture of our country’s growth and
prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny de
velops a somber shading. Upon m a - - car. •
lul inspection we find the wealth aid lux
i i v of our cities mingled wilh poverty and
wretchedness and unremunerative toil. A
crowded aud constantly increasing urban
population suggests the impoverishment of
rural sections, and discontent with agricul
tural pursuits. The fanner’s son, not sat
isfied with ids lather's simple and labori
ous life, joins the eager chase for easily
ewtpdred wealth.
W e find ihat the fortunes realized by
i ver manufacture and are no longer solely
the reward of steady industry aud enlight
ened foresight, hut that they result from
the discriminating favor of government
mil are largely built upon undue exactions
from the masses of our people. The gulf
between employes aud the employ or is con
stantly widening, and classes are rapidly
lorniing, one comprising the very rich and
powerful, while in another are found the
toiling poor.
As we view ihe achievements of aggre
gtdod capital, we discover tile existence of
trusts, combinations and monopolies, while
the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is
trampled to cleat li beneath an iron heei.
Uorp rations, which shoniii be the care
fully r> slraiat'il creatures of the law and
the servants of the people, ore fast becom
ing the people'* masters. Slill cougratlat
ing ourselves upon the wealth and prosper
ity of our country, and complacently con
templating every incident of change in
separable from the.e conditions it, is our
duty as patriotic citizens to
inquire at too present stage of
our progress, how the bond of government
made with the people has been kept and
performed, instead of limiting the tribute
drawn from our ciuzena to the necessities
of its economical administration, the gov
ernment persists in exacting from llie sub
stance of peop'e in 11 ions which unapplied
and useless lie dormant in its treasury.
This flagrant injustice, ami this breach of
faith and obligation add to extortion the
danger attending the diversion ol the cur
r-nev . 1 •• ii"'cv ironi the legitimate
•hnnneis of business
. ... .vs by which these re
• Hili." nr.- produced, the government per
mits in <uy millions mure to he added to the
cost of the living of our people and to he
takes from our vouaumers, which unrea
sonably swell the profits of a small but
powerful minority. The people must still
be taxed for the support of the government
under the operation of tariff Laws. But to
the extent that the mass of citizens are in
ordinately 'burdened beyond any useful
public purpose and for the benefit of a fa
vored few, the government
under pretext of an exercise of its taxing
power ente s gratuitously into partnership
with those favorites to their advantage and
tojtiie injury of a vast majority of our peo
ple. This is not equality before the law.
The existing situation is injurious to the
health of our entire body politic. It stifles
in those for whose benefit it is permitted,
all patriotic love of country, and substi
tutes in its place selfish greed
and grasping avarice. Devotion to
American citiaenship for Its own
sake and for what it should accomplish as
a motive to our nation’s advancement and
the happiness of all our people, is dis
placed by the assumption that the govern
ment, instead of being the embodiment of
equality, i* but an instrumentality through
which especial individual advantages are
to be gained.
The arrogance of this assumption is un
concealed ; it appears in the sordid disre
gard of all but personal interests, in the
refusal to abate for the benefit of others
one iota of selfish disadvantage, and in
combinations to perpetuate such ad
vantages through efforts to conti ol
legislation and improperly influence
the suffrages of the people
The grievances of those not included
within the circle of these beneficiaries,
when fully realized, will surely arouse ir
ritation and discontent. Our farmers, long
suffering and patient, struggling in the
race at life with the hardest ami most un
remittinvtColl, will not fail to see, in spite of
misrepresentation and misleading fullti
r-j. that they are obliged to accent gaol*
price* lor tneir pruuuma us are
fixed in foreign markets where they corn
jiote with tile farmers of the world; that
their lands are declining in value while
their debts Increase; and without compen
sating favor they are forced by the action
of the government to pay, for the benefit of
others, such enhanced prices for the things 1
they need that the scanty returns of their
labor fail to furnish their support or leave
no margin for accumulation.
Our workingmen, enfranchised from all
delusions and no longer frightened by the
cry that their wages are endangered by a
just revision of our tariff laws, will reason
ably demand through such revision stead
ier i inpayment, cheaper means of living in
their homes, freedom for themselves and
their children from the doom of perpetual
servitude and an open door to their ad
vancement beyond the limits of a laboring
class. Others of onr citizens whoso com
forts and expenditures are measured by
moderate salaries and tixed incomes, will
insist, upon the fairness and jus
tice of cheapening the cost of ueces-1
series for thtynselves and their families. ;
When to the selfishness of the beneficiaries 1
of unjust discrimination under onr laws )
there shall he added the discontent of those
who suffer from such discrimination, we
will realize the fact that the beneficiary
purposes of onr government, de
pendent upon the patriotism and con
tentment. of e.ffr people, are endangered.
Communism Vs a hateiul thing, and a
menace to pAce and organ zed govern
ment. But fh\ communism ol combined
wealth and carnal, the outgrowtli|of over
weaning enpidky and selfishness which in
sidiously uudemijne the justice ami integ
rity of free institutions, is no; less dungei
uus than the 'communism of oppressed
poverty and toi which, exasperated by in
justice and discontent, attack with wild
disorder the tit; del of rule.
He mocks the people who proposes that
the govornraenMshall protect the rich and
that they in turn will care for the laboring
poor. Any intermediary between the peo
pie and their government, or the last dele
gation of the care and protection i lie gov
ernment owes to the humblest citizen in
the land, makes the boast of fn-c institu
tions a glittering delusion and the pre
tended boon of American citizenship*hame
less imposition.
A just and sensible revision of our tariff
laws should be made for the relief of those
of our countrymen who suffer under uns
eat conditions. Such a revision should re
ceive the support of all who love that jus
tice and equality due to American citizen
ship, of all w .10 realize that in this justice
and equality otty government finds its
strength and Mts power to pro
tect the, citizen and Ids property, ol
i all who bclieye that the contented
■ competence aML* comfort of many
1 accord better witli the spirit of onr institu
tions than collossal fortunes unfairly gath
ered in the hands of a few, of all who ap
preciate that a forbearance and fraternity
among our people, which recognize the
value of every American interest are the
surest guaranty of our national progress
and of all who tUfftfe to see the products ol
i American skill and ingenuity in every mar
ket. of the world with a resulting restora
tion of American commerce.
The niTHasaly of the reduction of onr rev
enue is so apparent as to be generally con
ceded. But the means by which this end
shall be accomisVcstmd and the sum of di
rect benefit .wlSife-hV ’ill result to our citi.
z ns present a controversy of the utmost
importance/ There should be no scheme
accepted as satisfactory by which the bur
dens of the peoplt* -Ki only apparently re
moved. Kxtrava-Jant appropriations ol
public money, with all their demoralizing
consequences, should not be tolerated,
either as a means of relieving the treasury
of its present -suspl.n or as furnishing
pretext for resisting a propei
eduction on rates, existing evih
ind injustice, should be honestly recog.
lized, boldly met llid effectively remedied
There should be ttyjtessation of the struggb

tive toward existing industries, but wlticlt
w|fl reduce the cost to consumers of th<
necessaries of life, while it provides for out
manufacturers the- advantage of free raw
materials and pernits no injury to the in
terest* ot The cause foi
which the battlfris waged is comprised
within lines clearly and distinctly defined
It should never heyomproiuisect It is tin
people's cause. > It cannot bi
denied that VnM and vita:
interests which ajpso |tersistunt and hard
when efforts are im.lJ to deal in a just anti
comprehensive manner with overt tarifl
laws are related tat, if they are not respon
sible lor, the sentiment* largely prevailing
among the people that the general govern
ment is the funnUtn of individual and pri
VRteaid; that ir\ray he expected tore
lieVe with paternjajcare the distress of citi
zens and communities; that from the lull
ness of its treasuiy it should upon the
slightest possible jttelext of promoting tlu
general good, apply public funds to till
benefit of localities ahd individuals; not
can it be deniecLdhat there is a young
assumption that,against the government
ami in favor of private claims and inter
ests, the usual rule* and limitations ol
business principles and just dealing should
he waived. These ideas have been unhap
pily much encouraged by legislative acqni
* esence. Relief from contracts made with
the government 1 oo easily accorded in
favor of the citizen; the failure t
support claims agiinst. the government
hv nrnof. is | often sup-plied b
no ueuer i-imniteiatiuti titan tne weaitn ot
tlie government and the poverty of the
claimant. Gratuities in the form of pen
sions are granted upon no other real ground
than the needy condition of the applicant, ;
or for reasons less valid, am) large stunt
are expended for public buildings and
other improvements upon represent,l ions
scarcely claimed to be related to public j
needs and necessities. The extent to which
the consideration of such matters subordi 1
nate and postpone action npon subjects ot
great public importance, but involving nc
special, private or partisan interest should
arnst attention and lead to reformation.
A few of the numerous illustrations o
this condition may be stated. The crowd
ed condition of the calendar ot the su
preme court and tue delay of suitors and
denial of justice resulting therefrom, ha*
been strongly urged upon the attention ol
the congress, with a plan for the relief ol
the situation, approved by those well able
to judge of its merits. ** bile this subject
remains wt hunt effective consideration
many laws have been passed providing for
the holding of terms of inferior courts at j
places to *uit 'he convenience of localities, !
or to lay the foundation of an application 1
for the, erection of new public buildings, ;
Repeated recommendations have been 1
submitted for the amendment ami change!
of the laws relating to our public lands so !
that their spoliation uttd diversion to other |
uses than as hemes for honest settlers !
might, be presented. While a measure to j
meet this < uuceded necessity of reform re- !
main, (I awaiting the action of congress,
many claims to rite public lands and appli-1
cations for their donation in favor of states !
and individuals have been allowed.
Tim president alludes to the evils of om
nibus appropriation hills, private pension
bills, ami file securing of large laud grants
by railroads. He deprecates the extension
of the scope of federal jurisdiction and leg
islation, and its encroachment into the do
main of state r'ghts and local government.
He insists on the duty of observing the lim
itations of the constitution. He says:
The seventh president of the United
States, the sgldinr and Statesman, and at
all times the nriii and bravo friend of the
people, in vindication of his course as the
protector of popular rights and the cham
pion of trim American citizenship, ,Ic.
dared: “The ambition which lead- me , n
is an anxious desire and a (ixt and
determination to restore to the po
plc unimpaired the sacred trust
they have confided to my charge,to heal the
wounds of the constitution ami preserve it
front further violations, to prrsu. d.t my
countrymen, so far as I may, that it. is not
in a splendid government, supported by
powerful monopolies and aristocratical
establishments, that they will find happi
ness, or their liberties moteefed, lint in a
plain system, void of pomp—protecting all
and granting favors to none—dispensing its
blessings like the dews of heaven, unseen
and ttnfelt, save in the freshness and beauty
they contribute to proddee. It is such a
government that the genius of our people
requires, such a one only under which our
states may remain, for ages toe- m united,
prosperous and free.”
The president congratulates the country
on its state ot domestic tranquility, anil
its peace with all nations. He saye that the
international questions that still await set
tlement are all reasonably within the do
main of amicable negotiation, and suscepti
ble of diplomatic adjustment.
He recounts the action of the administra
tion aud ot the senate in regard to the fish
eries controversy, and says: “I am not
aware that, anything has since occurred
wlticlt should be added to the
facts therein stated. Therefore I
merely repeat, as applicable to the present
time, the statement which will he found in
my message to the senate of September
12th last, “that since March ff, 1887. no case
has been reported to the department of
state wherein complaint has been made of
unfriendly or unlawful treatment of Amer
ican fishing vessels on the part of the Cana
dian authorities in which reparation wag
not promptly and satisfactorily obtained
by the United States consul general at
Halifax.’ 1
To meet the exigency created by the re
jection of the treaty, I now again invoke
the earnest and immediate attention of con
gress to the condition of this important
question as it now stands before them and
the counti > and lor the settlement of
which I am ~reply solicitous.
Near the close of the month of October
last occurences of deeply regretable nature
were brought to my mind, which made it
my painful but imperative duty to obtai.
with as little delay as possible, anew per
sonal channel of diplomatic intercourse in
this country with the government of Great
Britain.
The correspondence to relation to this
incident will ia due course be laid befora
you, aud will disclose tbe unpardonable
conduct ot the official referred to In hts
interference by advice and counsel with
tbe suffrages of American citizens in the
very crisis ol tbe presidential election then
near at hand, and also in his subsequent
public declarations to justify his action,
super-adding impugnment of the executive
and senate of the United States in connec
tion with important questions now in
controversy between the two governments.
The offense thus committed was most grave,
involving disastrous possibilities to tbe
good relations of the United States and
Great Britain, constituting a gross breach
of diplomatic privilege and an invasion ol
the purely domestic affairs and essential
sovereign tv of the government to which
tu envoy was eocreatieu. Having nrst
fulfilled the Just demands o( international
comity by affording full opportunity for
her majesty's government to act in reliej
of tl.e situation, I considered prolongation
of discussion to be unwarranted, and
thereupon declined to further recog
nize the diplomatic character of the per
son whose continuance in such {unction
would destroy that mutual confidence
which is essential to the good understand-,
lug of the two governments, and was in
consistent with the welfare and self-respect
of the government of the United States.
The usual interchange of communication
has since continued through her majesty's
legation in this city. My endeavors to
establish by international co-operation
measures for the prevention of the exter
mination of fur seals in Behring
sea have not been relhxed, and 1
have hopes of being able shortly to submit
an effectual and satisfactory conventional
project with the maritime powers for the
approval of the senate.
The president recites the acts of the ad
ministration in regard to the exclusion ol
Chinese immigrants. He alludes to the
revolution in Hayti, and the steps taken to
protect the interests ol citizens of the
United States on that island, and the vari
ous other matters connected with our for
eign relations.
The president summarizes the reports ol
the treasury and other executive depart
ments of the government, giving interest
ing information, which we must reserve for
another i-stie In regard
to tin- policy of purchasing bonds belore
maturity, lie says: The requirements ol
the sinking fund act have been for the yeat
ended June 30, 1888, and for the current
year aNo, by purchase of bonds after com
plying with this law as posi ively required
and sufficient for that purpose had been
bought at a premium, it was not deemed
prudent to further expend until authority
to do so should be more explicit. A resolu
t-ion, however, having been passed by both
houses of congress, removing all doubt a
to executive authority, daily purchases ol
bonds were commenced on the 23d|day ol
April, 1888, and have continued until the
present time, By this plan bonds of the gov
eminent not yet due have been purchased
up to and including the 30th day of Novem
her, 1888, amounting to £94,700,100, the pfs
to turn paid thereon amounting to £17,508,-
hi-” - The premium added to the princi
pal of these bonds represents an investment
yielding about two pi r centf interest for
the time they still had to run, and the sav
ing to the gov rnment is repiesented by
the diflfi r uce hel ween the amount of inter
est at two p'-r cent, upon the sum paid for
principal and premium and what it would
have paid for interest at the rate specified
in the bonds if they bad run to their ma
turity is about $27,105,000. At first sight
this would seem to be a profitable and
sensible transaction on the part
of the government; but as suggested by the
secretary of the treasury, the surplus thus
expended for the purchase of bonds was
money drawn from the people in excess of
any actual need of the government,
and was so expended rather than
allow it to remain idle in the treasury. If
this surplus, under the operation of just,
and equitable laws, had been left In the
hands of the people it would have been
worth in their business at least 6 per cent,
per annum. Deducting from the amount
of interest on the principal and premium
of these bonds for the time they had to run
at the rate of ((percent, the saving of 2
per cent, made for the people by purchases
of such bonds, the loss will appear to be
$55,700,000.'
This calculation would seem to demon
stratn that if excessive and unnecessary
taxation is continued, and the government
is forced to pursue this policy of purchas
ing its own bonds, atthe premiums which it
will be necessary to pay, the loss to the
people will be hundreds of millions of
dollars. Since the purchase of
bonds was undertaken, as mentioned,
nearly all that have been offered were at
last accepted. It has been made quite ap
parent that the government was In danger
of being subjected to combinations to raise
their price, as appears by the instance cited
by the secretary of the offering of
bonds of the par value of
only $320,000 so often that
the aggregate of the sums demanded for
their purchase amounted to morn than
$19,700,000. Notwithstanding the -Urge
sums paid out in the purchase of bonds,the
surplus in the treasury on the 30th day of
November, 1888, was $52,234,710 01, aI * •
deducting about $20,000,000, just drawn
out for the payment f pensions.
The message thus refers to the eflirts of
the administration to recover for settle
ment by the people large qualities ol the
public lands; . *4*
It Is gratifying to know that something
has been done at last to redress the injuries
to our people and check the perilous ten
dency of the reckless waste of the national
domain That over eighty million acres
have been arrested from illegal usur
pation, improvident grants and fraud
ulent entries and claims, to bo
taken for the homesteads of honest indus
try-although less than the greater areas
thug unjustly lost—must afford a profound
gratification to right-feeling citizeps as it la
as a recompense for the labors and strug
gles for the recovery. Our dear experience
ought sufficiently to urge (he speedy enact
ment of measures of legislation which
will confide the future disposition
of our remaining agricultural
lauds to the uses of actual husbandry n<i
