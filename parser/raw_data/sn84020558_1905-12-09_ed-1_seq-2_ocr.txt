PHOENIX, ARIZONA. DEC. 9, 1905.
The Ordered Outrage.
The irade of President Roosevelt
establishing' the Joint state of Arizona
is encountering- opposition wherever
the conditions in the territories of
Arizona and New Mexico are under
stood. The Kansas City Journal, dur
ing the progress of the fight over the
omnibus bill and the later fig'it over
the Hamilton bill, was the friend of
this territory, its friendship being
based upon a familiarity with local
needs.
Of the paragraph of the president's
message dealing with statehood the
Journal said In its leader of last Wed
nesday: The president's recommendation of
statehood for Oklahoma and Indian
Territory meets a popular demand, but
his suggestion that New Mexico and
Arizona be admitted as one state will
be a great disappointment to the peo
ple of these territories. Oklahoma and
Indian Territory have in a measure
combined their forces and are anxious
for Joint statehood, but the substantial
and representative people of New
Mexico and Arizona are vigorously op
posed to merging their identity In this
manner.
Mr. Roosevelt says: "There is no ob
ligation upon us to treat territorial
subdivisions, which are matters of
convenience only, as binding us on the
question of admission to statehood."
But it will also occur to most free
Americans that "all government
should rest upon the consent of the
governed." This is not only an In
alienable right of a free people, but it
is a paramount consideration to their
welfare and happiness. Territorial
subdivisions are Just as important in
every essential particular as state
subdivisions, and the people of a ter
ritory are in equity entitled to the en
joyment of every fundamental right
that the people of a state possess. If
a state can not be blended with anoth
er state without the consent of both,
then the same principle should be ap
plied to the territories.
As a matter of public policy it would
be far more equitable and desirable
to Join Rhode Island and Connecticut
in one state than to force New Mexico
and Arizona to give up their separate
evistence. The only difference is, con
gress has the power in the one case
which it lacks in the other. But to
argue that it should not use that pow
er against the will of the people Is
but another way of saying that might
does not make right.
The interests of New Mexico are
chiefly pastoral and agricultural;
those of Arizona are mining and even
tually manufacturing. The population
of New Mexico is largely Mexican;
that of Arizona is mostly American.
Their racial Instincts and their busi
ness interests alike conflict. If they
are Joined in a single state there will
be continual Jealousy and friction, and
legislation to promote the interests of
one-half the state will necessarily be
at the expense of the other.
The Arizona Journal-Miner thus
vigorously expresses the hope of de
feating the outrage ordered by the
president:
The cause of Arizona, however, is
not yet lost. The president's self-assertive
and autocratic utterances and
opinions have often fell upon the deaf
ears of our legislators, and we sincere
ly hope that in this case the house will
do . Justice k to the territory and refuse
to give assent to such an unparalled
and atrocious outrage as Jointure
would involve. We are strengthened
in this belief by the recent visit of the
congressional deputation to our midst,
and also by visits from several indi
vidual congressmen. These gentlemen
after having made a thorough and ex
haustive Inquiry into the whole ques
tion, confessed that there was no ex
cuse for Joining New Mexico and Ari
zona together in unwilling bonds, and
many of them confessed that, while
they had previously concurred in and
voted with Senator Beveridge on this
question, they would from henceforth
be diametrically opposed to the Joint
ure scheme, and also that they would
use their best influence In senate and
congress to prevent any measure of
Joint statehood from becoming law.
This gives us renewed hope, but the
fight, without doubt, will be waged
without mercy in the present congress,
and the friends of Arizona, both at
home and in Washington, will need all
the help and succor possible. It is use -less,
we believe, to further parley with
President Roosevelt. His recommen
dation has gone forth, and, like Caesar,
no power in heaven or hell can change
it.
The Prescott Courier, which usually
divests itself of gloves preparatory to
handling unpleasant things, says of
the president's dictatorial order:
The above, had it come from the
pen of George the III, could have been
no more arrogant, unjust, or tyrrani
cal, and shows that the president,
with all his grandstand play about
American manhood and fairness, Is
fully in accord with the infamous pro
cedure of his party in its attempt to
dodge keeping of sacred promises as
to statehood by forcing the Joint state
hood deal upon Arizona. From the
first the Courier has been the only pa
per in Arizona opposing Joint state
hood, which has argued that the mat
ter be left to a vote of the people of
Arizona. Certainly this should appeal
to the manhood of both houses of con
gress, and even the president, with his
big stick, would scarcely have the te
merity to oppose so fair a proposition,
a proposition the urging of which this
paper now regards as . the surest
means of defeating the dangers with
which we are now threatened.' " '
RECLAMATION WORK
DONE IN THREE YEARS
A Resume of the Accomplishments of
the Service.
Washington, Dec. 8. A resume of
the work performed by the reclamation
service to date shows that seventy
seven miles of main canal, fifty-four
miles of distributing system, and 18G
miles of ditches have been constructed,
including dams, headworks, etc. Tun
nels having a total length of three and
one-half mills have been driven, in
cluding more than a mile of the great
Cunnison tunnel. More than 250 miles
of telephone lines have been installed
and are in operation; 1?6 miles of
wagon road, many miles of which were
cut out of solid rock In almost Inac
cessible canyons, 147 bridges, and fifty
otliee and other buildings have been
constructed.
The works above mentioned have
called for the excavation of 9,350,000
cubic yards of rock and earth, the lay
ing of 70.000 cubic yards of concrete.
12.000 cubic yards of rip rap, 190,000
square feet of paving; 130.000 linear
feet of sheet pilins: and 10,000 feet of
bearing piles have been driven. There
have been purchased 130,000 pounds of
railroad iron. 250,000 pounds of struc
tural steel. 600,000 pounds of cast iron,
1.750,000 feet B. M. of lumber, and 78,-
000 b?.rrc!s of cement. The govern
ment has erected a cement mill at a
cost of more than $100,000, which has
already turned out 15,000 barrels of ce
ment, and is now furnishing about 300
barrels a day. The saw mills operated
by Uncle Sam have cut 2,880.000 feet.
B. M. of lumber from the government
reserves.
The U. S. reclamation servico was
organized In 1902, immediately after
the passage of the reclamation act. As
soon as possible after a discussion of
preliminary plans in Washington, in
vestigations were begun in the thir
teen states and three territories which
are beneficiaries under this act. By
utilizing the data gathered in previous
years by the hydro-graphic branch of
the geological survey, the service was
enabled to concentrate Its efforts upon
several projects and plar.s for their
construction were soon prepared for
the construction were soon prepared
for the consideration of the secretary
of the interior. Up to the present time
eleven of these projects have been ap
proved and are under actual construc
tion. Their estimated cost is nearly
$30,000,000.
