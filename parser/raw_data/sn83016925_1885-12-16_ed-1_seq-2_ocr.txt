Tie President's Message.
The most striking feature of the Pres
ident's message, uext to its prolixity, is
the great familiarity with the details of
the Government's business which it
discloses. Indeed it i wonderful that
in the cbort opace of nine months, beset
as he baa been by most unusual embar
rassment, be has lieen able to acquire
so comprehensive a knowledge of t.uch
intricate and multitudinous affair. A
synopsis of tins remarkable document i
printed in our columns and we com mend
its careful tnd deliberate perusal to ali.
We notice some of its fecial features.
In connection with a statement of the
relations ot the Limed Maus wan
foreign Govern int nts the President refers
to the refusal of Austria-IIiiDtrarv to
receive Mr. Kkiley and says: "The
reasons advanced were such as could n.;t
be acquiesced in without violation of
my oath of oflice and the precepts of
the constitution, since they necessarily
involved a limitation in favor of a
foreign government upon the right of
-eiectimi by the Kseeut ive, and required
such an application of a religious test as
a qualification for oilice uncer the United
States as would have resulted in the
practical disfranchisement of a lartre
class of our citizen, and the abandon
ment of a vital principle in our govern
merit. The A ustro-llungarian govern
ment finally decided not to receive Mr
K..-I.EY a- the envoy of the L'uited
States, and that eentleman has since
resigned bis commission, letving the
post vacant. I have made no new nom
inaiion, and the interests of thia govern
ment at ienna are now in the care of
tne r-ecretary or Jegation, acting as
Charge d'Affaires ud interim."
Ti .Ml 1 - . 1 .... .
ii win oe remembered tnat it was
stated s-hortly after Mr. Knu.SY' ap-
upointment that the objection to him
was that be whs a Catholic who bad
married a Jewess.
The Nicaragua canal treaty which
was withdrawn from tLe Senate before
any action had been taken on it by that
body, is withheld, because it contains
absolute and unlimited engagements to
defend ihe territorial integrity of the
State of Nicaragua, and while be favors
the Tehuantepec ship railway scheme be
is decided in his convictions that any
mteroceanic transit across the Isthmus
should be neutral, and entirely free
from any engagement involving an offen
sive and defensive alliance.
Iu connection with the statement that
our relations with China are harmonious
the President condemns the conduct of
the mobs in Wyoming and Washington
Territories, though he maintains the
right of the United States to prevent
Chinese immigration, and promises, if
existing laws are inadequate to compass
the end of the restrictive legislation now
iu force, "to give earnest consideration
to any further remedial legislation,
v.itbin the treaty limits, which the
wisdom of Congress may ilevise."
He declines to ask the sanction of the
Senate to the international convention
guaranteeing the neutrality of the Congo
Uasin, though it was signed by the dele
gates from the United States as by the
plenipotentiaries of other Governments,
(without authority, however, so to do),
because it "would be an alliance whose
respon sibilitics we are not in a position
to assume."
Though the language of the message
concerning the tariff seems to be clear, it
has not settled the controversy between
the revenue reiormers and the protec
tionist as io where the President stands.
Ot two things there can be no doubt.
(1). He favors a reduction of the
revenue, and (2) be thinks that the
"reduction fehould be made iu the
revenue derived from a tax on the im
ported necessaries of life." In close
connection with bis recommendations
on this subject, though it my be acci
dental, we find the following:

The President makes a strong showing
in favor of suspending tLe coinage of
silver. The arguments he uses are not
new and not unanswerable, but they are
presented in a new dress and in forcible
style. The first and best answer to all
his predictions of evil to flow from the
continued coinage of silver, is that simi
lar predictions were made in 1878, have
been made constantly since, and have
not as yet been verified. The President
does not ask that silver coinage be sus
pended in order to repair damage already
done, but to avert what he conceives to
be a threatened and impending financial
disaster. As evidence that the pro
phesies of the anti-siver men have not
been fulfilled, we quote the following
language from the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury, one of the ablest
documeuts we have ever read:
"Stopping the coinage now is a perfect
remedy for the evil which the business
classes have measured, judged and desire
to see averted. They do not wish its re
currence in a varied form. Increasing
the weight of silver in the dollar as
sumes the present dollars to be incapable
of continued equivalence with the mone
tary unit, when in fact, by stopping
further coinage they can be he'd in our
domestic exchanges to that equivalence."
As we understand it, thesa are the
views of the President also.
The recommendations concerning the
policy to be pursued towards the In
dians will receive the sympathy of
philanthropists and, it is to be hoped,
will be productive ot good results.
Both the President and Secretary La.
mar pay a deserved tribute to the
Christian men and women who 'have
labored a.3 missionaries among these
savages, and both refer wnatever pro'
gres has been made towards their civili
zation, to the effect of religious educa.
cation.
The Mormon system, being a vul
gar excrescence on the body pontic,
receives the condemnation it deserves.
in terms whose eloquence will charm the
hearts of all who value the chastity
of the domestic circle.
The views of the President on the
civil service have undergone no change
He believes in the gystem of competitive
examinations and gives good and sub
stantial reasons for bis belief. Many
who disagree with him, generally, on this
subject will endorse the following ex
pressions : "While partisanship continues
bitter and pronounced and supplies so
much of motive to sentiment and action,
it is not fair to hold public officials in
charge of important trusts responsible
for the best results in the performance
of their duties, aud yet insist that they
shall rely, in confidential and important
places, upon the work of thoss not only
opposed to them in political affiliation,
but so steeped in partisan prejudice and
rancor that they have no loyalty to
their ehiefs aod no desire for .heir suc
cess. Civil Service reform does not
exact this, nor does it require that those
for subordinate positions who fail in
yielduig their best service or who are
incompetent should be retained simply
because they are in place."
Th. messatre f the President, as a
whole, from whatever point it may be
considered, is an admirable document,
aud it and the report of tbe members of
the country that the ante-election prom,
ises of the Democrats will be made good.
Secretary Lamar'i Report.
It has often been said that the In
terior Department is an empire in itself,
and the remark is not extravagant. The
wide range of topics covered by Secre-
i t
lary Lamar a report mases genera,
comment on it impossible. The inter
ests of Iudian tribes and nations and the
fniduct of the Government Hospital for
the Insai.e; the condition of all the
Territories and of the Hot Spring of
Arkansas; the finances of the Pacific
railroads and the education of the deaf,
dumb and blind; the pension roll and
the Yellowstone Park ; the Patent OSce,
the Freeumau's Hospital and a dozen
other large and small interests, all come
within the purview of this report.
I5iit the spirit which Secretary
Lamar brings to the care of these varied
interests can be shown iu a few words of
bis own. Concerning p nsions, for
instance, be says: "I know of n bur
den of government that is more cheer
fully liorne than that of the pension
svsteiu. I concur fullv iu all efforts to
demonstrate that when well and cleanly
administered it is noble iu its purpose
and good in its results. From a state
ment in the report of the Commissioner
it appears that ilie amount of money
paid as pensions does not equal the
amount of interest paid upon the public
debt incurred during the war. So long
as the premium paid to those who con
tributed the money exceeds that paid to
the defenders of the country, I think the
complaint of excessive pensions, is not
well founded."
Pensioners need not fear the Southern
man at the bead of the Interior Depart
ment t. ho speaks iu (his language of the
duty of the country to them. The
friends of the Indian will be no less
pleased by what the Secretary ssys of
Indian education: 'T think the policy
of securing the co-operation of those re
ligious and philanthropic societies which
have for so many years labored for the
amelioration of the condition of the In
dians should be continued. They have
expended within the last few years in
money' alone millions of dollars, and
experience has shown the benefits of
their aid and assistance. I desire here
to acknowledge my own obligations to
these associations for their co-operation,
and also my high appreciation of the aid
I have derived from "the counsels and
sympathy of those Christian ministers
who, in the spirit of their Divine Master,
are devoting themselves to the best and
tiighest.interests.of this unfortunate and,
in some respects, noble race."
15y the way, the Indians seem to be
on the whole the wealthiest body of
people in this country. There are, Mr.
Lamar reports, 200,000 of them men,
women and children and they own, in
lands and trust funds, $152,0oa000 of
property. The Secretary's comment
upon this remarkable text deserves the
attention of Congress and of the friends
of the Indian. Possibly also the owners
and managers of land grant railroads
will find something of interest in Mr.
Lamar's suggestion that "the field of
future investigation might well include
bow the great frar.cbises granted by the
nation are conducted with reference to
the convenience, wants and necessities
of the people whose interests they were
intended to promote. This broad field
would embrace, among others, rates of
fare and freight, discriminations, combi
nations for the suppression of legitimate
competition aud convenient termiual
facilities and connections. The protec
tion of the pecuniary interest of the
government iu its dealings with these
great highways is important. But to
secure equal justice to every citizen in
his rights thereunder is vital."
Secretary Lamar's report is proof thai
the Interior Department has for its
bead an upright, wise aud patriotic man,
capable of supervising with a firm band
all the various interests committed to
his care, and determined, above all
other things, that justice shall be done
aud the rights of the people rigidly
guarded. JV. 1". 1 let aid.
Vanderbilt's Will.
Perhaps the most remarkable testa
mentary disposition of property on
record, is that of the late William H.
Vaxderbilt. It is remarkable not
only for tbe great value of the estate of
which it disposes, but for the clear, sys
tematic aud business-like manner in
which the disposition is made.
To bis wife he gives for the term of
her natural life, in lieu of dower, the
family residence and all tbe belongings,
including works of art, plate, silver,
ornaments, musical instruments, library,
carriages, horses, &c, and authorizes
her to exchange or dispose of any of the
chattels except pictures, statuary and
works of art. In addition to this he
settles upon hasjan annuity of $200,000,
and directs that a sufficient sum beset
aside to yield that amount, 500,000 of
which she may dispose of by will. All
of the property in which the wife has a
life estate goes to his son George W. at
her death, with remainder to such sou of
Georgi-. W. as he shall by his last vill
appoint, aud iu default of such testamen
f.ry direction, to tbe eldest son who
survives him, and in default of such
survivor, to bis grandson Wst. II., son of
Cornelius, "his sons, his heirs and
assigtis forever."
To each of his four daughters, all
married, he devises the residences in
which they now live.
lie disposes of $80,000,000 as follows:
To each of bis eight children (four sons
aud four daughters) he bequeaths the
income of $5,000,000, the principal to
be held in trust by the trustees named
in the will, tor tbe benefit of his grand
children who take at the death of his
children per uteres. And to each of his
said children be bequeaths 15,000,000,
absolutely. These bequests are specific
and en-brace a schedule of United States
Bonds and Railroad stocks and mort
gages. In addition to the bequests
named in this paragraph,' $2,000,000 is
bequeathed to Cornelits, and he and
Wm. K. are constituted the residuary
legatees.
Religious, charitable and public insti
tutions will receive $1,053,000.
Annuities are provided for a number
of distant relatives. .
His wife and four sons are made
trustees, wfch the exception that neither
of his sons shall be trustee of the fund
set apart for him, or for bis benefit, and
that tbey shall serve without com
pensation. In case of tbe death of any
of tbe trustees, the trust vests in th
others, and when all die the trust ceases j
"and tbe entire trust fund shall be paid i
to the beneficiary entitled to receive the j
same."
The will bears date September 25, 18S4, ,
and was written by ex-Judge Charles
Rapallo of ihe New York Court of Ap
peals. ' -
It is supposed that tbe residuary es
tate will amount to $1,000,000.

heartily endorse:

which ought to be a strict necessity for
hi daily work of life, constitutes the
foundation of our Democracy. But this
is not enough to satisfy its interests. In
the history of nations democracies have
been the cradles of pure thought and art.
The same cause which operated on them
exists in American society, and whether
through a national university or in frag
mentary institutions iu the several
States, sooner or later, a higher edu
cation, higher than the common school
or the academy, or the College can fur-

Bills of Lading.
The case of Friedhtnder d: Co., v. The
Texas aud Paiiic Railway, recently de
cided by Judge Pardee in the Circuit
Court at Galveston, was a f"it bsed cn
a but ot lading, executed oy one oi tne
station agents of the defendant for 300
bales of cotton. The plea of fraud was
iuterposed as a bar to recovery, and j
on the trial it was proved that the bill
bad been fraudulently issued by the agent
without having received tbe Cot
ton, r rti ct andrr & vo. were
third parties holding tbe bill without
knowledge of the fraud. Judgment was
given for defendant.dismissing plaintiff's
action with costs, the court holding that
the company was not liable under the
circumstances for the act of tbe agent
who had fraudulently issued tbe 1411 of
lading for cotton not received.
Whatever may have been the original
office of a bill of lading, in commercial
usage it is now treated in many respects
as a certificate of 'deposit or letter of j
credit. We believe the general opinion
among lawyers is that the receipt, duly
signed by an authorized agent of the
carrier, cannot be disputed when held
by third parties innocent of any fraud
in connection witti it. It is certainly
the opinion of the commercial commu
nity, as evidenced by tbe great facility
with which money can be raised ou bills
of lading.
No Profit at All.
Col. A. K. McClcre, that veteran
and enlightened politician who directs
the Philadelphia Times, puts the ques
tion in a very compact and conclusive
form:
"If the Democratic organs could put the
Cleveland Administration down, what
profit would the democracy gaui"
It would gain no profit at all. To pull
(town the Administration of Mr. Cleve
land in the year 1886, would destroy
every hope of Democratic success in tbe
year 1888.
There is one wise, prudent, and safe
way of dealing with this whole subject,
and that is for all members of tbe Demo
cratic household to dwell together in
unity so far as possible, and to walk in
the ways of forbearance and concord
with each other.
If, nevertheless, there are any Demo
cratic organs that dislike Mr. Clkve
land and his policy so heartily that
they cannot easily control their indigna
tion, let them carefully consider what
will be the effect ou the great body of
tbe Democracy of giving such passion
vent and action. Perhaps a serious in
vestigation may convince them that the
personal gratification, of assailing t fa-
President can only tuin out in tbe end
a matter of barrenness and of destruc
tion; and if this le so, why should
they not desist!
This argument might also have its
weight with Mr. Cleveland himself.
Heougbt to understand that there is
such a thing a3 standing so very straight
to lean over backward. Let ns have
peace all around.
Thft chief duty at present is to
establish and confirm the Democracy in
tbe permanent con. 181 of the Federal
Government; and this duty is even
more obligatory upon Mr. Cleveland
than upon any other individual :
Mncli must be borne which is hard to
bear.

but the case that has been chief in pub-
lie interest was that of the State vs
John. B. Martin, charged with attempt
to till and murder A. M. Heath, on tue
4th day of December, 1 SS 1.
The case may be briefly stated as fol
lows:
Martin bad been anemplove for about
two Tears of A. M. Heath, a well-to do
farmer, living about two miles from
lazoo City. Heith and wife had no

Mollie. Martin proposed to marry Miss
Mollie, to which Heath objected. Heth
iau uiMin rus lire an insurance poiicv
for $5000 $2'J0'J of which wasin favnrof
Miss Moiiie. It was in evidence that
Martin was a young man of steady, and
oiter lianas, yn tne mn l'eemTer,
184, Martin who at that time w-is not
employed by Heath, but' was carrying
on the business ot a butcher in laz in
City, went to,Heath's house, complained
of feeii.12 sick and asked for some
whisky. Heath took a liask of whisky
from a seed box, where he kept it, and
gave it to him. Supper was announced
and Martin declined to eo to the
table, but remained in the sitting
room. Martiu slept in the same bed
tnat night with Heath, aud left at dav-
break the net morning. Two d.nvs
after that, Heath, at the request of one
Roberts, working ou the place, gave him
a drink from the same flask. Soon after
tbe vounc man was taken violently ill,
and a physician pronounced the symp
tou.s those ot poisonm bv strychnine.
An analysis tf the flask of whisky dis
closed the presence of strvehnine. A
warrant was sworn out by Heath against
Martin. fooii atter Martin s arrest, he
and Miss 31olue were married.
The case, of which the above is an
O'ltiiueof the evidence adduced by the
tate, was tried at the present term and
resulted in a verdict of guiltv. Amotion
for a new trial was ovenuled, and defeu
aaut sentenced to a term ot six vears in
the penitentiar". LIui few cases have
exercised a similar interest in this com

THE NORMAL Dl'.T A RTM EN T.
While much b;is been said and writ
ten in regard to tue industrial part ol
the work of the Institute and Cullege
comparatively little attention has been
called to the Normal Department and to
the higher educational advantages oflered
to woman in the College.
Ihe world is apt to run in grooves
somewf thm strange ones, as it appears
afterwards in the light of a higher
revelation. It is so much easier to run
in tbe old, even if devious pathway?
than to hew out new ones, .besides, tu
new ones require, unlortunately, unitv
ot thought, co-operation of mnid, oi
will, and ot action, lue uriversul mind
must not only be made to leel the neces
itv but to unite in the effort to attain
the object. And when we consider the
narrowness of views as to intellectual
necessities entertained by the major
portion i1 humanity, it seems ama.tn
that Mississippi should, by 4mie myste
rious and beneficent providence, have
leaped to the front on the educational
question.
It is scarcely known or appreciated
now that Mississippi is the first aud cnly
government, local or general, in the his
tory or the world to accord to women.
by law, the right to equal education with
me.
This riaht, now that it has been
achieved, seems so evidently just, and
only what should altvavs have been
1, t,mt we ta1 8-arcely realiz,
umt at the opening ot o ir College in
Columbus, last October, was.inaugui nted
one of the grandest epochs in the history
of woman.
When we consider the fact that to
woman is necessarily committed the
most important trust iu the world the
moulding from infancy to youth when
iu the most plastic state "That creature
who stands frontward to the stars,"
fashioned in the image of God himself,
we wonder and are amazed that every
thing is not done to tit her for this
momentous trust.
Nor is woman's responsibility limited
to motherhood. Three fourths of the
work of educating this nation is done
by women. In Mississippi four fifths of
tne educators are women. How are our
teachers fitted and prepared for tb:s
grand mission?
Probably no one in our State has bad
better opportunity to know what
answer to give to this question than
the teachers in the Institute aud College
who have examined and taughe the three
hundred girls there, representing as they
do nearly every county in the State with
their respective teachers.
Doubtless there are very many efhci
cient, conscientous, earnest women and
men in Mississippi doing thorough work
as teachers on stinted pay, for a few
months of each year. Hut there are
doubtless, also, many who, regardless of
opportunities or titiie, have gone into
this work merely to "keep the wolf from
the door."
There is row offered to teachers, by
the State, a Normal Training School.
I know that many of thein feel their
owu necessities for instruction. Let us
put it within the reach of our financially
poorest teachers to get to this school,
by inaugurating County Industrial Loan
Associations all over the State, which
shall, by loaning them the money for
this purpose, confer a benefaction upon
the w hole State.
One of the most encouraging features
of tbe College is the eagerness of the
girls to work, industrially and intellee
tually. It is evident that the "gospel of
work"has been proclaimed to them
effectually. The prospect of learning
some bread-winning art is evidently a
powerful incentive.
Some of the stories of tha girls here
in reference to their getting means to
jome are truly pathetic. One poor girl,
who came with just forty dollars w.ith
which to learn something by which to
live, came to me to advise her and was
so overcome at tbe thought of having to
go back to her former life after a so
much broader outlook that her story
was stopped by tears. She went to her
room and wrote what she bad not the
heart to say. Her letter is so pathetic
in its sir.. pie truthfulness that I shall
give you part cf it as a sample of what
many are doing and feeling:
Miss Martin: I think I can tell you
everything b tter by writing to you.
You have been so kind to me I feel I
can ask your advice. Mama is very poor
and could never afford to send me to
school, but has taught me everything
she could herself. I made money enough-
to come to this school myself, and now
I see it is not possible for me to stay
here and learn a trade, so that I can
make wy own support without working
in the field, for you know that 1 am not
strong enough for that kind of labor.
I cannot stay more than four months.
Mama did want me to take dress making,
but I will not have money enough to
get tbe material to learn with. I want
to learn telegraphy for a trade. Advise
me what to take and lei me stay and
learn it, or I will have to work in the
field always for my suppoit. Papa has
the consumption and cannot live long
and mama cannot support me.
Respectfully,
It is certainly heart-movinar to have
such appeals poured into one s ears, and
that, too, from refined girls whose parents
have perhaps been reared in luxury.
What a God-send our College is to just
such cases, provided they can get the
benefit of it as tbey may through these
Loan Associations it tne Dig neartea
men and women of ou rotate will only
make the little necessary effort to organ
ize them. I speak of what I know. In
oar own Association in Warren county,
which U now aiding four girl to come
to this College, the organizing of which
was a p;eaure ana satisfaction irom
tbe first. Iu noble President, Mrs. A.
Warner, takes evidently only delight m
her beautiful work of benevolence.
Those who can, need not, however.
stand Tjack for co-operation in doing a
noble work, that ot sending a girl them
selves. It would only coat about S12o
to maintain one here for tbe whole
ear's cm?rs? if a scholarship can be
obtained. Think of the s.-aisfaction of
raising a girl from a life f dependence
and drudgery to a noble, cheerful, inde
peudeut living E M.
STATE INDUSTRIAL LOAN ASSO
CIATION OF MISSISSIPPI.
We, tbe representatives of tbe various
County Lvdl'srialLoan Associations
cf the Stat of Mississippi, feeling a
deep interest in the success of the
IxursTRiAt Institute and College
for white girls, nw together on "Open
ing Day" of the College, Octoner 22, in
Columbus, where we organized a State
IsDiVTRiAf, Loan Ass-kiation. The
purpose of tli3 State Association is to
further tbe formation of County Indus
trial Loan Associations, and to dissemi
nate information through them in each
county in regard to the educational
need of women.
The first County Association was
ortrinized in Claiborne count v in March.
lf-sj; this was tuiiowed !v similar
oianizutions in Warren, tooi.-b aud
Washington counties, which have proved
to be of great practical value. There
are now attendinir the Institute and
College ten s;irls sent bv these Associa
tions who are beinir instructed in
erarv branches and tauirht industrial
arts, which will en.ible them to become
e'f-supportinu'.
Th-st girl', sent by County Associa
tions to learn a special art or science, are
not required to go thioiigh the collegiate
course, but are permitted to leave as
soon as they shaii h-ive become proficient
in their special art or science.
THE OBJ..CTS OF THE ST HE I" IX. TRI A I.
I.OAX ASSOCIATION A nr.:

structed iu th" bread-winning arts and
science.
2d. To encourage w men to foster and
to seek a higher education, to leain
practical and useful art and sciences;
aud to aid them to obtaiu employment

THE OBJECTS OF THE COINTT LOAN
ASSOCIATIONS are:
1st. Jo lend a helping hand to
struggling womanhood aud to encotiiage
and assist her in obtaining remunera
tive labor.
2d. To loan a juflicientsuni of money
annually to one or more white ifa! 0I
the countv who shall prove themse've

Thus, for the sum of one dollar pi
annum, by co operation we nbnli be able
to bring the Industrial Institute an
Colleire within the reach of the poores
trirls of our State and make them self
supporting.
The Constitution and Bv-Laws enn be
obtained by applying to the Secretary
of the State Industrial Loan Association
at Columbus, Mississippi. The benevo
lent, public spirited women ot our Slate
in each county are earnestly requested
to interest themselves in this work, to
set about at once organizing Associations
in their counties and communicating
with the cential, Siate organization.
A grand work is belore us in Missis

operation of her women in their efforts
for the educational advancement and
improvement of women.

Columbus Female Industrial College.
Commercial-Herald.
Bishop Thompson writes to th Louis
iana papers concerning Mississippi's Male
Industrial College in happy sua glowing
terms. We will venture to sav, had he
visited ihe Female Industrial College at
Columbus, on the day before Thanks
givinsr, he would have observed some
thing equally as pleasurable and un
usual: the cheerful labors of Mississippi's
girls; our pioneers in the held of female
industrial pursuits. The girls at Colum
bus, like the Starkville boys, are paid
eight cents per hour; and the same en
thusiasm and industry prevail there.
An extract from a recent letter from a
Vicksburg girl to her mother is an
ex. tuple of the determination and cheer
ful willingness to learn to work: "You
know we are paid eight cents per hour
for work. The day before Thanksgiving
1 picked and dressed a turkey, and
though I feit a very 'yeasty' sensation
in the region of my pericardium, I held
on like grim death. I also swept for an
nou', and made another eight cents,
then the collee-urn, winch must be two
feet in diameter, 1 polished up, 'earn
ing,' I hope, at least, an additional
eight cents." This girl is the indulged
daughter of fond parents, and these are
her first lessons iu real work. She is
fitting herself for business, the realities
of life, by giving her almost undivided
attention to one industrial art aud pro
poses being self-smtaiuing. Actuated
by such a spirit of resolve, these noble
young women in embrio prognosticate a
new era in the history of Mississippi.
Her future wives will be the help-mates
in reality for those hardy sous of toil
now at Starkville.
Truly, God's laws of compensation
are wise, if mysterious. "Who of us,
twenty year3 ago, could have foreseen
so mighty a change in our indolent,
luxury-loving society and institutions?
Out of the awful evil of those bloody
five years god has come in this shape
The youth of this generations re develop
ing almost the same spirit of character
that burned in the bosoms of our revo
lutionary ancestry. Iu the words of
Bishop Thompson, there was "far-seeing
wisdom somewhere," when Mississippi
founded her Female Industrial College.
All honor to those instrumental in it ;
and we trust that every Southern State
may follow our example.

As far as we have conversed with
people in this part of the State, including
citizens of five or six couuties besides
Panola, we have not yet come up with a
solitary individual who is not in favor
of the repeal of the law as it now stands.
Some and not a faw of the land
owners with whom we have talked on
the subject,' think it would be better to
repeal the law at once, but no one has
advanced an argument that we deemed
strong enough to overcome our idea of
postponing the effect of the repealing
act till one more crop is gathered. ' The
desire for the repeal of the law at Some
time either immediately or in the near
future seems to be general, and our
Seuator and Representatives may regard
it as the settled will of their constituents
a large -iirfjority, if not all that this
shall be done.

tliatikS for the niaiiiresttttion of vour con
tiiiueii confidence. It is a compliment wrhicli
1 shall altvavs remem!er with pride and
cratittide. Nuwiiere eise in the world can
there be found a legislative assembly lepre
sentina so great a constituency as that rep
resented by this House, and certainly no
similar body, cotisisritur of an equal number
of members is its suocrior in point of abili

it. The pri vile re of presid ine over tho de
liberations of such a bodv is a very liieh and
honorable distinction the hiirhest and most
honorable it can confer on any of its mem
bers, and I appreciate it as such. But, een-
ttemen, my tun appreciation of your action
to-day can liest be shown by a conscientious
and Impartial discharge of my official duty,
and, aithouich it may not be wise lo make
