French Bishops' Attitude.
It is officially stilted that letters of
Mo.nsignor Montagi:ni, the expelled sec
retary of the papal nunciature here,
show the majority of French bishops
favored the observance .of the law of
4881, and bowed with reluctance to the

that the inviolability of the diplomatic
correspondence of the nunciature wa9
.^.'scrupulously respeciied before the rup

Rome, Dec. 13.—Immediately after

.J Mtntagntal, the expelled secretary of
««.the papal .nunciature at Paris, went to

.. vpapal secretary of state, Merry del Val.
tf£He made along report on -tfhe situation
tjci.in France, especially in regard to the
documents seized at the Paris mincia
yvture,- several hundreds of which deal
entirely with the Franco-Vatican con
flict, and will be especially interesting
to the French government as showing,
it is ^asserted here, the differences of
opinion among the members agairust
the action of tlhe French government.
Afterwards M-onta.gndnl went to the
pope, who asked for minute details of
the secretary's expulpion and the doc
urnewts seized. Montagnini expressed
the distress which he felt as the result
of his expulsion and presented to the
pontiff a rather dark picture of the sit
uation, saying he believed the present
French government will not be induc
ed to change the attitude which it had
assumed toward the Vatican.

Washington, Dec. 13t—It Is an

ity that President Roosevelt is seri
ously considering sending a special
message to congress on the question ot
car shortage. The matter has been
pressed,upon him in almost a bushe?
(/0f
letters and telegrams from all parts
vinced that the situation is very peril
ous to many helpless shippers and
owners of farm products. ,,
The chief sufferers thus far seem to
be spring wheat farmers of the north
west, and cattle shippers. The presi
dent is said to hold that there is need
for prompt relief and he is now in
quiring to satisfy himself if the inter
state commerce commission has as
much authority under the new rate law
as It ought to have to prevent a recur
rence of the present^rouble. The pres

sends a special message, will advise an
increase of the interstate commerce
commission's power to permit it to
regulate the distribution of cars and to
enforce penalties against roads de
taining cars of other systems beyond
a reasonable time.
Judge S. H. Cowen, of Texas, who
took a prominent part in helping frame
the rate legislation of the last session,
has already drawn up a bill giving the
commission such jurisdiction and has
submitted it to the president.

DEFERRED DIVIDENDS ARE BAD
Enactment of Prohibitory Statute
Would Bankrupt Some of the Best
Companies in Iowa—Commission May
Limit Amount of Dividends Permit
ted. A *3W, j*
SP*,aX

Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dpo. 13—"If deferred
dividends are abolished some of our
best Iowa insurance companies will Ibe
Toreed into the hands of receivers," say
some of the legislative Insurance com
missioners.
"Deferred dividends are a bad thing
and being a bad thing should be abol
ished," say other members of the com
mission.
The question of deferred dividends is
the final question to be settled in the
legislative commission's report. It was
expected that the commission would
meet again today and finally decide up
on the report but Nate Kendall could
not be here till the first of next week
and it Is now probable that the re
'Port will not be filed till then.
Four distinct times the commission
has approached an agreement as to the
terms of the report. Another agreement
hus been drawn up and the commis
sioners have expressed pleasure with it
with the exception of Jamison. There
is no certainty that an agreement will
he reached Monday when the commis
sion meets.
Gravest of differences divide the
commission on this one point. Every
other point in the report has been fin-,
ally passed upon. The argument that
is being made now before the commis
sion against the deferred dividend will
all be made before the legislature when
it meet9 next month. It is claimed in
the first pla.de that ft. is a "gambling
proposition,'' that dlvld&nclR>ar£ nflt In
surance, and should not be mixed up
with insurance ,that a .person about to
take out insurance Is argued into a de
ferred dividend proposition on the the
ory that he is going to get a lot of div
idends of uncertain and indefinite
amount: and that a person is frequent
ly argued into taking out Insurance for
the sake of the dividends which are
a snare and delusion.
The members of the legislative com
mission are all opposed to the deferred
dividend as an abstract proposition but
here is the Royal Union of Iowa and
other Ioiwa insurance companies which
are writing 95 per cent of their bus
iness in deferred dividends on the
promise of big earnings. If this is cut
off and they lose 95 per cent of their
business they will either go to the wall
or else be years in recovering.
If they try to write the same amout
of business in straight insurance they
will fail for without the idea tha.t it is
an investment a man seeking Insurance
will go oftentimes to some of the fra
ternals, where he can get it cheap.
One basis of settlement reached by
the commission was the annual cred
iting of dividends. It was thought
this would still enable the Iowa com
panies to write the business they had
been writing with the idea of getting
dividends on their insurance. But the
insurance men argue against it on the
ground that the first annual payment to
an old line insurance company goes alf
to expenses and on the second year's
payment there is very little if any div
idends to credit up. The thirdl year
'here is still but a small amount, and
if a person argued into taking in
surance on the promise of big divi
dends. gets two or three of these an
nual statements with little or no divi
dends credited up to him he will drop
his insurance. The dividends pile up
rapidly at the tail end and this is the
one strong argument of the deferred
dividend advocates for allowing the
companies to continue in the business.
At the same time lawyers hold that
this annual statement becomes an ob
ligation and the companies do not wish
to assume any .obligation till the pol
icy is matured. In New York the cam
paign contributions and legislative lob
bying expenses came from these funds
that pay the dividends, and to make an
annual statement would greatly inter
fere with continuing these contribu
tions and lobbying.
Still another argument is made that
if the company is to make a statement
to the person insured, why should it
not continue the process and pay the
obligation over in cash or credit it on
the next premium?
I So far the commission has failed to
1
agree on any of these plans. It is bare
ly possible that an agreement may be
reached to limit the per cent of de
ferred dividend policies written for
each year till the deferred dividend
business is gradually wiped out.

BAD SPILL IN RACE
Ten Bicycle Riders Go Down in a

All Except Two Able to Resume
the Race When the Track Was Re.
paired.
New York, Dec. 13.—There was a bad
spill in the bicycle race early today,
when ten riders went down in a heap,
The race was temporarily suspended,
I while thq stunned and bruised men
were attended to, and carpenters re
I paired the track, which was ripped and
torn for twenty yards. All of the rid
I ers, with the exception of Hollister and
Vanoni, were able to continue when the
race was resumed. The partners of
the two injured men continued to
grind, and it was believed both would
be able to resume after a few hours'
rest. At 8 a. m. the score was: First
twelve, 1,424 miles, seven laps Wal
thour-Bedell, one lap behind.
Evidence of the effect upon the rid
ers of the frightful strain put upon
tihein by the constant vigilance of the
six-day contest, was' shown at the time
of this morning's accident. While the
men were still lying in a heap on the
track,Pye, who had escaped with slight
injuries, jejped out of the bunch and
running wildly along the track began
to shout.
"I win the race. I win the race.
They're all'dead but me. I wini"
He quieted when taken to his quar
ters. When the race was resumed, Pye
was again in the saddle reeling off the
miles with the others.
The accident came when Fogler, of
the Root-Fogler team, darted out .from
among the leaders in an attempt to
steal a lap. Mat Downey was the first
man to accept the challenge, and aifter
a few circuits of the track he caught
the leider just as they were sweeping
around Dead Man's curve and the two
men brushed each other and fell. In an
instant the other eleven riders were
upon tbem and eight went down with
a crash. Emil Georget rode "clear over
tlhe prostrate riders and crashed head

Washington, Dec. 13.—President
Roosevelt was directly charged in the
senate today with using his influence •.
for the election of republican Mormofli
candidates in the recent election in
candidates in the recent election In
Idaho and Utah. The charge waf •./•
made by Senator Dubois in the course
ot a speech jn which he discussed th»
right of Reed Smoot to a seat in the
senate. .. •,
Dubois asserted the control of the
church to be complete in the hierarchy*v|?i
consisting of the^ presidency and&V
twelve apostles, of which Smoot wassj^
•4
one. This control, he maintained, wa#^$s-•%
ecclesiastical, political and commercial^'. if:
and was exercised completely over the^
followers, who come principally front,
foreign countries. He contended the
president had sent Secretary Taft 'Into
Idaho to speak in advocacy of law an4 "J
order, after he (Dubois) had telegraph-*.*
ed the president that the only-issue
in Idaho was the desire of the .Mormon
hierarchy to continue to dominate the
politics of the^state, and that the pres
ident) had been misled If he thought
there was any other issue. The re
publican state platform, he said, wa^,«
absolutely silent regarding law and "orVv^l
der, and notwithstanding*' the demo-"&M
cratio platform 'had denounced thexS
murder of Steunenburg and demanded£-:5
conviction of the guilty party, none of
the democratic speakers had discussed
any subject save that of Mormonism.
Hence, there was no other issue In the
Idaho campaign. A
TO FIGHT CAPITAL INCREASE.

000,000 Northern Stock.
St. Paul, Dec. 13.-r-Attorney General
Toung of Minnesota, today made a ruwS|
ing that under the state law the pro~V$i
posed increase in the capital stock ofH^
the Great Northern' railway, recently
announced from New York, amounting
to $60,000,000, is invalid tha.t as aoons-£^
as the issue is actually begun the state
will take action in the matter. Thej
attorney general holds that before the
railroad can increase Its capital stjclt"\«
it must serve notice of such intention»
on the state railway and warehouse
commission ffor review and public
hearing to determine the necessity for,
the increase.
This has not been done, and further-,
more an Increase of $25,000,000, made
last spring, must also be explained be
fore either the present proposed issuw
or that of last spring can become:lega1.
The Great Northern operates under a
Minnesota charter, and the original
company is Incorporated under ter
