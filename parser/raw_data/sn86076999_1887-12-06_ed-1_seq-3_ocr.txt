A Chicago pitcher who was of

down on the proposition. She was
right. A man who travels about
the country twisting base balls for a

to himself or anyone else when his
ball days are over.
The Republicans of St. Louis
thought to corrall the Teuton vote
by sustaining a proposition to teach
German in the public schools. An
Independent ticket was put in the
field, the mottoe of which was:
'No language but English in the
public schools," and it swept the
field. The American party is com
ing right along.
"Practical politicians" in Mas
sachusetts have been in the habit
of paying the poll-tax of voters
who could not otherwise be induced
to vote, and this i3 not considered
bribery. Somo ingenious citizsns
have induced the managers of both
the great parties to pay thi3 tax,
which amounts to ?2, and then arm
ed with the two tax receipts, re
presented to the city collector that
their tax had been, by mistake,
paid twice, and secured the return
to themselves of the money paid by
one of the campaign committees.
This has led to the adoption of new
tactics on the part of the cheated
politicians, and shrewd voters are
casting about for new dodges to cir
cumvent them.
Kink. Attraction.
A novel race will take place at

The legal contests in the Mc-Don-
a'.d family of San Francisco are be
ing watched with great interest in
' thia city , from the fact that Mrs.
McDonald lived in Carson from a
chil l, , being the daughter of Mr.
Gardner and the sister of Mrs.
Scovillo. She left many warm
friends here, who believe today
with the Appeal that her acts dur
ing the past few months have been
those of a woman not in her right
mind. If half the reports about
Dr. McDonald and his son are
true, a woman must indeed have a
strong mind to keep her reason and
associate with such wretches.
Dr. McDonald, a man of enor
mous wealth, is now spending his
money to blast the character of his
daughter-in-law. A few months
ago he tcld half a dozen people that
she was insane, and in no way re
sponsible for her acts.
During the time he considered
her insane he had private detect
ives on her trail, watching every
movement, and these men in com
pany with bell boys and hotel scul
lions and chambermaids in McDon
ald's employ are in the case, hound
ing this insane woman.
But the blackest thing that has
come out is where a witness, a per
fect stranger to Mrs. McDonald, of
fered to go on her bail. "When 6he
was in the city prison with a sick
child this man threatened to with
draw lrcm her bonds unless she
would consert to become his mis
tress. It is charged that this reptile was
in McDonald's employ, and con
tracted to compromise her for so
much money. Such a ecallawag
should be bung, but hanging would
be a long way too good tor his em
ployer. Death of a Noted Gambler.
George Duval, "a noted monte
man from way back," died in St.
Louis last week. He is said to have
outwitted the most notorious sharps.
He and Canada Bill, for years, fol
lowed the Central and Union Pacif
ic making their headquarters by
turns at Omaha, Salt Lake, Elko,
Winnemucca, Reno and San Fran
cisco, iinally their depredations
became so numerous and the com
plaints against them so general, that
the very strictest measures had to be
taken by the railroad lines to rid
the cars of their presence. Ia time
they found their unlawful business
unprofitable, and finally abandon
ed it altogether
Duval went to St. Louis, where
he engaged in legitimate trade.
But it is said at times the love of
adventure overcame his reformation
and he would disappear for weeks,
to be heard of in some of the Terri
tories, where for a brief season he
plied his tricks and games on the
foolish and unwarv.
It Should Be Confirmed.
When President Cleveland ap
pointed Chas W. Irish to the office
of United States Land Surveyor for
Nevada, there was some little talk
about the gentleman being a nonresident,-
This was by Republicans
as well as Democrats, and was said
before giving the gentleman a chance
to speak for himself. Since Mr.
Irish has been in the office and in
the State he has shown himself
to be one of the best friends Nevada
ever had, and we believe that his
appointment should be confirmed.
He is a resident of this State and
has inaugurated some much needed
reforms here in the conduct of the
land business. There is not a man
who should not urge the President
to confirm his appointment for by
having a gentleman of such integri
ty and sterling worth as Mr. Irish
is possessed at the head of our most
important departments, the State
cannot help but be benefitted. Lyon

The President's 3Ceta;e.
New York, Dec. 5. The World's
Washington special says: The
President's message to Congress,
for the first time in our history, will
discuss but one question. It will
say that, in view of the paramount
and even vital importance of the re
duction of the tariff, he will treat of
that subject alone, and for the pres
ent will refer Congress as to the
affairs of the different Departments
to the reports of the various Cabi
net officers.

Careless Prospectors.
Salt Late Tribune: John J.
Stockwell lost 700 sheep in the can
yon fires northeast of the city. He
had 4,000 head up there when the
flames came shooting up the canyon.
By hard work he and his shepherds
got about 3,300 over the crest into
a place of safety, but the fire came
up so rapidly that 700 were overtak
en and burned. The heat was so
great that many of the poor animals
swelled up and burst. There was
great destruction, also timber, a very
large area being burned over. The
fire is laid to careless prospectors.
