OF
PRESIDENT B. B. HAYES,
DELIVERED TO CONGRESS DE­
CEMBER 1st 1879.
Fellow Cit izens of the Senate and House of
Representatives The members of the Forty
sixth Congress have assembled in the first reg­
ular session, under circumstances calling for
mutual congratulation and grateful acknowl­
edgment to the giver of all good, for the large
and universal measure of national prosperity
which we now enjoy. The moat interesting
events which bave occurred in our public af­
fairs* since last annual message to Congress
are connected with the financial operations of
the government directly affecting the business
interests of the country.
THE RESUMPTION ACT.
1 congratulate Congress on the successful ex­
ecution of the resumption act at the time
fixed and in the manner contemplated by law.
The notes of the United States began to bo re­
deemed in coin since the 1st of January last,
und they have been promptly redeemed on pre­
sentation and in business transactions, public
and private, in all parts of the country. They
are received and paid out as the equivalent of
coin. The demand upon the treasury for
gold and silver in exchange for United States
notes has been comparatively smaller and
the voluntary deposits of coin and bullion in
exchange for notes bave been very large. The
excess of prccious metals deposited or ex­
changed for United States notes over the
amount of United States notes redeemed, is
about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie
payment has been followed by a very great re­
vival of business. With a currency equivalent
in value to the money of the commercial world,
we are enabled tj enter upon equal competi­
tion with other nations iu trade and produc­
tion. The increasing foreign demand for our
manufactures and agricultural products has
caused a large balance of trade in our favqr,
which has been paid in gold from the 1st of
July last to November 15 to the amount of
about $59,000,000.
REFUNDING OPERATIONS.
Since the resumption of specie payments
there has also been a marked and gratifying
improvement of the public credit. Bonds of
the government bearing only four per cent, in­
terest bave been sold at or above par sufficient
in amount to pay off all the national debt
which was redeemable under the present laws.
The amount of interest saved annually by the
process of refunding the debt since Miirch 1,
1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were
largely in small sums, and the number of our
citizens now holding public securities is much
greater than ever before.
The amount of the national debt which ma­
tures within less than two years is #792,121,
700. of which iBuUO,000,0110 bear interest at
the rate of live per cent, and the balance is in
bonds bearing (5 per cent, interest. It is be­
lieved that this part of the public debt can be
refunded by the issuer 4 perct. bonds, and by
the reduction of interest which will thus be
effected, about 510,000,000 can be annually
naved to the treasury. To secure this import­
ant reduction of interest to be paid by the
United States further legislation is required,
which it is hoped will be provided by Congress
dnring the present session.
OOLD AND SILVER COINAGE.
The coinage of gold by the mints of theUnit.
ed States duriug the last fiscal year was $400,
986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since
the passage of the act for that prrpose, report­
ed Nov. 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which
$12,700,344 have been issued from the treasury
and are now in circulation and $32,300,506 are
still in the possession of the government. The
pendency of the proposition for unity of ac­
tion before the United States and the principal
commercial nations of Europe to effect a
permanent system of equality of
gold and silver in the recognized
money of the world, leads me to recommend
tkat Congress refrain from new legislation on
the general subject. The great revival of trade,
internal and foreign, will supply during the
coming year its own instructions which may
well be awaited before attempting further ex­
perimental measures with the coinage. I
would, however, strongly urge upon Congress
the importance of authorizing the secretary of
tbe treasury to suspend the coinage of silver
dollars upon the present legal ratio. The mar­
ket value of the silver dollar being uniformly
and largely less than the market value of the
gold dollar, it in obviously impracticable to
maiutain them at par with each other if both
are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin
is forced into circulation, it will, if coined
without limit, soon become the sole standard
of valne, and thus defeat the desired object,
which is a currency of both gold and silver
which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for
dollar, with the universally recognized money
of the world.
RETIREMENT OP LEGAL TENDERS.
The retirement from circulation of United
8tates notes with the capacity of the legal ten­
der in private contracts is a step to be taken in
cur progress toward a safe and stable currency,
which should be accepted as the policy of the
government and the interest and security of
the people of it. It is my firm conviction
that the issue of legal tender money, money
based wholly on the authority and credit of the
government, except in extreme emergency, is
without warrant in the constitution and a vio­
lation of sound financial principles. The issue
of United Btates notes during the late civil
war with the capacity of legal tender between
private individual was not authorized except
as a means for rescuing ths country from immi­
nent peril. The circulation of these notes for
paper money for any protracted period of
time after the accomplishment of this purpose
was not contemplated by the framers of the
law under which they were issued. They an­
ticipate tbe redemption and withdrawal of the
8"tt lit the earliest practicable period consist­
ent with the attainment of the object for
which they were provided. Tbe policy of the
United States steadily adhered to from the
adoption of the constitution has been to avoid
the creation of a national debt, and when from
necessity in time of war, debts have been cre­
ated, they have been paid off on return of
peace as rapidly as possible. With this view,
and for
thi3
purpose, it is recommended that
existing law* for the accumulation of a ainking
fund BI ilicifi.fi to extinguish the public debt
within a .'imitod period, be maintained. If
any change of tbe objects or rates of taxation
is deemed necessary by Coogress it is suggested,
experience has shown, a duty can be placed on
tea and coffee, which will not enhance the
price of those article* to the consumer, and
,i|,
•isf
which will add several millions of dollars an­
nually to the treasury.
MORJHONISLM.
The continued deliberate violation, by a large
number of promiaeut and idS lential citizens
of
the Territory of Utah, of the laws of the United
States„for the prosecution aud punishment of
polygamy,
merits the attention of every de­
partment of the government. This Territory
has a population sufficient to entitle it to ad­
mission as a State. This important change
will not, however, be approved by the country
while tbe citizens of Utah, iu very considera­
ble numbers, uphold a practice which is con­
demned as a crime by the laws of all civilized
communities throughout the world. The law
for the suppression of this offense was enacted
with unanimity byCongress more than seventeen
years ago, but has remained until recently a
dead letter in the Territory of Utah because
of the peculiar difficulties attending its en­
forcement. Tbe opinion widely prevailed
among citizens of Utah that the law was in
contradiction of the constitutional guarantee
of religious freedom. This objection is now
removed. The supreme court of the
United States has decided the
law to be within the legislative
power of Congress, binding as a rule of action
for all who reside within the Territories. There
is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation
in its enforcement. It'should be firmly and ef­
fectually executed. If not sufficiently strin­
gent in the provisions, it should be amended,
and in aid of the purposes in view, 1 recom­
mend more comprehension and more searching
methods for preventing as well as puuishin^
this crime, be provided. If necessary to secure
obedience to law, the enjoyment and exercise
of the rights and privileges of citizenship in
the Territories of the Uuited States may be
withheld or withdrawn from those who violate
or oppose the eaforcemant of law on this sub­
ject.
PROTECTION OF THE BALLOT.
The elections of the past year, though occu­
pied only with State offices, have not failed to
elicit in political discussions which attended
them all over the country new and decisive evi­
dence of the deep interest which the great body
of citizens take in the progress of the country
towards a more general and complete establish­
ment, at whatever cost, of universal security
and freedom in the exercise of the elective
franchise. While many topics of political con­
cern demand great attention from our people,
both in tho sphere of national and State au­
thority, 1 find no reason to qualify the opinion
1 expressed in my last annual message, tnat no
temporary or administrative interests of the
government, however urgent or weighty, will
ever displace the zeal of our people in defense
of the primary rights of citizenship, and that
tho power of public opinion will override
all political prejudices, and that
all sectional and State attachment
in demanding that all over our wide territory
the name and character of citizen of the United
States shall mean one and the same thing and
carry with them unchallenged security and
respect. 1 earnestly appeal to the intelligence
and patriotism of all good citizens, of every
part of the country, however much they may
be divided in opinion on other political sub­
lets, to unite in compelling obedience to exist­
ing laws aimed at the protection of
the right of suffrage. I respectfully
urge upon Congress to supply any defects in
these lawB which experience has shown and
which it is within its power to remedy. I
again invoke the co-operation of the executive
and legislative authorities of States in this
great purpose. I am fully convinced that if
the public mind can be set at rest on the para­
mount question of popular rights, no serious
obstacle will thwart or delay tbe complete
pacification of the country or retard the gen­
eral diffusion of prosperity.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
In a former message 1
invited the attention
ot Congress to the reformation of the civil
service of the government, and expressed an
intenti on, transmitting to Congress as early as
practicable, a report upon this subject by the
chairman of the civil service c»nunis.-.ion. In
view of the fact, during a considerable period,
the government of Great Britain has beeu deal­
ing with tbe adiniuiKtative problems and
abuses in various particulars analogous to
those presented in this country, and that 'n
recent years the measures adopted were under­
stood to have been effective and in every re­
spect highly satisfactory, I thought desirable
to have fuller information upon the subject,
and accordingly requested the chairman of the
civil service commission to make a thorough
investigation for this purpose. The result has
been an elaborate and comprehensive report.
The report sets forth the history of the parti­
san spoil system in Great Britain,and of the rise
and fall of the parliamentary patronage and of
official interference with the freedom of
elections, shows that after long trials of
variouH kiuds of examinations, those Which are
competitive aud open on equal terms to all,
and which are carried on under the superin­
tendence of a single commission, have with
great advantage been established as the con­
dition of admission to almost every official
p:ace in the subordinate administration of
that country and of British India. The com­
pletion of the report, owiyg to the extent of
the labor involved in its preparation, and the
omission of Congress to make any provision
either for the compensation or the expenses of
the commission, has been postponed until the
present time, it is herewith transmitted to
Congress. While the reform measures of an­
other government are of no authority to us,
they are entitled to influence to the extent
to which their intrinsic
wisdom and their adaptation
to ourconstitutions and social life may com­
mend them to our consideration. The views I
have heretofore expressed concerning the de­
fects and abuses in our civil administration,
remain unchanged except in so far as an en­
larged experience has deepened my sense of
the duty, both of officers and of the people
themselves, to co-operate for their removal.
The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils
system of appointment to office, and of the of­
fice tenure, are now generally recognized. In
the resolutions of the great parties, in reports
of departments, in tbe debates and proceed­
ings of Congress, the messages of executives,
the gravity the evils has been admitted. To
command the necessary support every measure
of reform must be based on common right and
justice, and must be compatible with the
healthy existence of great parties which are
inevitable and essential in a free State.
When people have approved a policy at a
national election, confidence in the officers they
havo selected and the advisers who, in accord­
ance with our political institutions should be
consulted as to the policies which it is their
duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It
is eminently proper they should explain to the
people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the
performance of their official duties. It hardly
need be pointed out that very different con­
siderations apply to the greater number of
those who fill the subordinate places in the
civil service. Their responsibility is to their
superiors in oflicial position. It is their duty
to obey the legal instructions of those upon
whom that authority is devolved, and their
public service consists in the discharge
of their functions irrespective of par­
tisan politics. Their duties are the
same whatever party is in power, and what­
ever policy prevails. As a consequence, it
follows that their terms of office should not
depend upon the prevalence of any policy or
the supremacy of any party, but should be de­
termined by their capacity to Rerve the people
most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan
interests. The same considerations that should
govern tbe tenure, should also prevail in the
appointment, discipline and reroovol of those
subordinate. The authority of appointment
and removal is not a perquisite which
may be used to aid a friend
or reward a partisan, bnt Is
1
7
a trust to be exercised in the public inter­
est. The only just ground of discrimination
is the measnre of character and capacity be has
to make that service moat oseful to the peo­
ple, except in cases when upon just and recog­
nized principles, it is upon the theory of pen­
sions, offices and promotion are bestowed as
rewards for past services. Their bestowal up­
on any theory which,disregards personal merit
is an act of in ustico to the citizen, as well as a
breech of that trust subject to which the ap­
pointing power is beld.
In the light of these principles, it becomes
of great importance to provide just and ade­
quate means,
especially
for every department,
or a large administrative office where personal
discrimination on the part of the head is not
practicable for ascertaining those qualifications
to which appointments and removals should
have reference. To fail to provide such means
is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer­
taining facts upon which tbe most righteous
claims to office depend, but of necessity to
discourage all worthy aspirants by
handing over appointments and removals
to mere influence and favoritism.
If fit is the right of the worthiest claimant to
gain the appointment, aDd the interest of the
people to bestow it upon him, it would seem
clear that a wise and just method of ascertain­
ing personal fitness for office must needs be an
important and paramount function of every
wise and just government.
It has long since become impossible in the
great offices for those having the duty of nom­
ination and appointment to personally enquire
into the individual qualifications of more than
a small proportion of those seeking office, and
with the enlargement of the civil service, that
proportion must continue to become less. In
the earlier years of the government the subor­
dinate offices were so few in number that it
was quite easy foi- those making appointments
and promotions to personally ascertain the
merits of the candidates. Party managers of
methods bad not then become powerful agen­
cies of coercion, hostile to the free and just
exercise of the appointing power.
A large and responsible part of the duty of
restoring the civil service to the desired purity
and efficiency rests on tbe President, and it has
been my purpose to do what is in my power to
advance such prudent and gradual measures of
reform as will most surely bring about the rad­
ical change of system essential to make our ad­
ministrative methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. By a proper exercise of au­
thority it is in the power of the executive to do
much to promote such a reform, and it cannot
be too clearly understood that nothing adequate
can be accomplished without co-operation
on the part of Congress, and
a considerate and intelligent sup­
port among the people. Reforms which
cha'lenge tbe generally accepted theories of
parties, and demand changes in methods of
departments, are not tbe work of a day. Their
permanent foundations must be laid in sound
principles and in an experience which demon­
strates their wisdom, and exposes the errors of
their adversaries. Every woitby officer desires
to make his official action a gain and honor to
his country, but the people themselves, far
more than their officers in public
Btation,
are
interested in a pure, economical and vigorous
administration.
By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now
in substance incorporated in the revised stat­
utes, the practice of arbitrary appointmeats to
the subordinate grades in the departments was
condemned, and examinations as to capacity,
to be conducted by departmental boards of ex­
aminers, were provided for and made condi­
tions of admission to the public service. These
statutes area decision by Congress that exam­
inations of some sort as to attainments and
capacity, are essential to the well being of the
public service. The important questions since
the enactment of these laws have been as to
the character of these examinations, and
whether official Savor and partisan influence, or
common right and merit, were to control ac­
cess to the examinations in practice. These
examinations have not always been open to
worthy persons generally, who might wish to
be examined. Official favoritism and partisan
influence, as a rule, appear to have
designated those who alone were
permitted to go before the examining board,
subjecting even the examiners to a pressure
from the friends of the candidates very difficult
to resist. As a consequence the standard of ad­
mission fell below that which the public inter­
est demanded. It was also almost inevitable
that a system which provides for various boards
of examiners with no common supervision or
uniform measure of procedure should result in
confusion and inadequate tests of capacity
highly detrimental to the public interests. A
further and mure radical change was obviously
required.
In the annual messsge of December, 1870,
my predecessor declared that "there is no duty
which so embarrasses the executive and heads
of departments as that of appointments, nor
is there any such arduous and thaukleps labors
imposed on Senators aud Representatives as
finding places for constituents. The present
system does not secure tho best men and often
does not fit men for public places. Tbe eleva­
tion and purification of tbe civil service of tiie
government will be hailea with approval by
the whole people of the United States."
Congress accordingly passed tho act ap­
proved March 3, 1871, to regulate tbe civil ser­
vice of the United
StateB
and promote
tbe
ef­
ficiency thereof, giving the necessary authori
ity to the executive to inaugurate
a
civil ser­
vice reform. Acting under the statute, which
was interpreted as intending to secure
a
system
of just and effectual examinations under uni­
form supervision, a number of eminently com­
petent persons were selected for the pur­
pose, who entered with zeal upon
the discharge of the duties pre­
pared, with an Intelligent appreciation of the
requirements of tbe service and regulations,
and who, in their capacity an a board, have
been known as tbe civil ser nee commissioners.
Congress for two years appropriated the money
needed for the compensation and for the
expense of carrying on the work
of the commission. It appears from the re­
port of tbe commission submited to the Presi­
dent in April, 1S74, that examinations had
been beld iu various sections of the country,
and tbat an appropr.ation of about $25,000
would be required to meet tbe annual ex­
penses, including the salaries involved. The
report was transmitted to Congress by special
message on April IS, 1874, with the following
favorable comment npon tbe labors of tbe com­
mission: "If sustained by Congress, I have
no doubt tbe rules can, after tbe experience
gained, be so improved and enforced as to still
more materially benefit the public seryice and
relieve the executive, members of Congress and
the beads of departments from influences prej­
udicial to eod administration. The rules, A3
they
have hitherto been enforced, have result­
ed beneficially as is shown by the opinions of
tbe members of tbe cabinet and their subordi­
nates in the departments, and in that opinion I
concur."
And in tbe annual message of December of
tbe same year similar viewa are expressed,
and an appropriation fur continuing the work
6f the commission again advised. The appro­
priation was not made, and as a consequence
the active work of the commissioners was sus­
pended, leaving tbe commission itself in ex­
istence without the means therefor of causing
qualifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or of securing for tbe public service
the advantages of competition upon any ex­
tensive plan.
I recommended in my annual message of
December, 1877, tbe making of an appropria­
tion for the resumption of the work
of the commission. In the meantime,
however, competitive examinations under
many embarrassments, have been conducted
within limited sphered in the executive de­
partments in Washington and in a number of
the custom bouses and postoffices of tbe prin­
cipal cities of the conntry, with a view to fur­
ther test their effects, and in every instance
have been found to be as salutary as they are
stated to be under the administration of my
predecessor. 1 think the economy, purity and
efficiency of tbe public service would be
greatly promoted by their systematic intro­
duction, wherever practicable throughout tho
entire civil service of the government, togeth­
er with ample provision for their general
supervision, in order to secure consistency and
uniform justice.
Reports from the secretary of tho interior,
from the postmaster general, from the post­
master in the city of New York, where such
examinations have been for sometime on trial,
and also from the collector of the port, the na­
val officers and the surveyor iu that city, and
from the postmasters and collectors in several
of the other large cities, sh JW that the competi­
tive system, where applied, has in various
ways contributed to improve the public service.
The reports show that the results have been
salutary in a marked degree,
and that a general application
of similar rules cannot fail to be a decided
benefit to tho service. The reports of the gov­
ernment officers in the city of New York es­
pecially, bear decided testimony to the utility
of open competitive examination in their _re
spectivo offices, showing that these examina­
tions and the excellent qualfications of those
submitted to the service through them have
had a marked effect upon the persons previ­
ously in the service, and particularly upon
those aspiring to promotion. There has been
on the part of tbe latter au increased
interest in the work and a desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond the par­
ticular desk occupied, and thus the morale of
the entire force has been raised. The examina­
tion have been attended by many citizens, who
have had an opportunity to thoroughly investi­
gate the scope and character of the tests, and
tbe method of determining the results, and
those visitors have without exception approved
the methods employed, and several of them
have publicly attested their favorable opinion.
Upon such consideration 1 deem it my duty
to renew the recommendation contained in my
annual message December, 1S77, requesting
Congress to make the necessary appropria­
tions for the resumption of the work of the
civil service commission. Economy will be
promoted by authorizing a moderate compen­
sation to persons in tbe public service who
may perform extra labor npon or under the
commission, as the executive may direct. I
am convinced that if a just and adequate test
of merit is enforced for admission to the pub­
lic service in making promotions, such abuses
as removals without geod cause, and partisan
and official interference with the proper exer­
cises of the appointing power, will in a largo
measure disappear.
There aie other administrative abuses to
which the attention of Congress should be
asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap­
pointments and the constant peril of removal
without cause, very naturally lead to an ab­
sorbing and mischevious political activity on
the part of those thus appointed, which n»t
onlyinterferes with the due discharge of official
duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of
elections. Not without warrant in tbe views of
several of my predecessors in the Presidential
office, and directly within the law of 1871 al­
ready cited, I endeavored by regulation made
on the 22dday of June, 1877, to put some rea­
sonable limits to such abuses.
It. may not be easy and it may never, per­
haps, be necessary to define with precision the
proper limit of political action on the part of
federal officers, but while their right to (hold
and freely express their opinions can not be
questioned, it is very plain tbat they should
neither be allowed to devote to other subjects
the time needed for the proper discharge of
their official duties, nor to use the authority of
their office to enforce their own opinions or to
coerce the political action of those who hold
different opinions. Reasons of jnstice and
public policy, quite analagous to those which
forbid the use of official power for the oppres­
sion of the private citizen, impose upon the
government tbe duty of protecting its officers
and agents from arbitrary exactions.
In whatever aspect considered, the practice
of making levies for party purposes upon the
salaries of officers, is highly demoralizing to
the public service and discreditable to the
country. Though an officer should be as free
as any other citizen from using his own money
in aid of his opinion or his party, he should
als, be as free as any other citizen to
refuse to make such gifts. If salaries
are but a fair compensation for time and labor
of the officers it is gross injustice to levy a tax
upon them. If they are made excessive iu or­
der tbat they may bear a tax, the excess is in­
direct robbery of the public funds.
I reccommend therefore such a revision and
extension of the present statutes as shall se­
cure to those in every grade of official life or
public employment, the protection with which
a great and enlightened nati should guard
those who are faithful in its service.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with foreign counries have con­
tinued peaceful. With Great Britain there arc
still unsettled questions growing out of the
laws of the maritime provinces, and tho action
of provincial authorities, deemed to be in dero­
gation of rights secured by treaty to American
fishermen, the United States minister in Lon­
don has been instructed to present a demand
for $10,530,502 in view of damage* received by
American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th
day of January, 1878. Tho subject has been
taken into consideration by the British
government and an early reply is an­
ticipated. Upon the completion of
the necessary preliminary examinations the sub­
ject of our participation in tbe provincial fish­
eries as regulated by treaty will at once be
brought to the attention of tbe British gov­
ernment with a view to an early and permanent
settlement of the whole question, which was
only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of
Washington.
Efforts bave been made to obtain the remov­
al of restrictions found injurious to the ex­
portation of cattle to the United Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred with
regard to the rescue and saving of life and
property upon tho lakes, which has resulted in
important modifications of the previous regu­
lation of the dominion government on this sub­
ject in the interest of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of
the last session of Congress, commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States
at the two international exhibitions in Aus­
tralia, one of which is now in progress at Syd­
ney and the other to be held next year in Mel­
bourne, a desire has been expressed by mer­
chants and manufacturers interested
Jin the im­
portant and growing t.ade with Australia, that
an increased provision should be made by Con­
gress for the represectation of our industries at
the ^Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the
subject in respectfully submitted to your
favorable consideration.
The assent of the government has been given
to the landing on tbe coast of Massacbvsetts of
a new and independent traus-Atlantic cable
between France, by way of the French island
St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any fu­
ture legislation of Congress on the subject.
Tbe conditions imposed before allowing con­
nection with our shores to be established, are
such as secure its competition with any exist­
ing or future lines of marine cable,
and preclude amalgamation therewith, and
provide for an entire equality of rights to onr
go?emmert and people with those of France in
the uso of the cable, and prevent any exclusive
possession of tho privilege as accorded by
France to the disadvantage of any future cable
communication between France and the United
States which may be projected and accom­
plished by our citizens.
An important reduotion of the present
rates on cable communication with
Europe, which is felt to be too burdensome to
the interests of onr commerce, must necessarily
flow from the establishment of this competing
line. The attention ot Congress was drawn to
the propriety of' some general regulation of
Congress of the whole subject of transmarine
cables by mv predecessor, in his message of
December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to
your consideration tho importance of Con­
gressional action in this matter.
Tbe questions of grave importance with
Spain growing out of the incidents of the
Cuban insurrection, bave been, for the most
part, happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably be anticipated that the commission
now pitting in Washington for the decision of
private cases in this connection, will soon be
able to bring its labors to a conclusion.
Tbe long standing question of East Florida
claims has lately been renewed as a subject of
correspondence and may possibly require Con­
gressional action for its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands with respect
to consular rights and privileges similar to
those with other powers, has been signed and
ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged
on the 31st of July last. Negotiations for ex­
tradition treaties with the Netherlands and with
Denmark are now pending. Some questions
with Switzerland in regard to pauper and con­
vict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubt­
ed that they will be arranged upon a just and
satisfactory basis. A question has also occur­
red with respect to an asserted claim
by Swisa municipal authorities to exercise
tutilage over persons and property of Swiss cit­
izens, naturalized in this country. It is possi­
ble this may require adjustment by treaty with
the German empire. Frequent questions arise
in connection with the subject of naturaliza­
tion and expatriation but the imperial govern­
ment has constantly manifested a desire to
strictly maintain and comply with all treaty
stipulations in regard to them.
In consequence of the omission of Congress
to provide for a diplomatic representative at
Athens, the legation to Greece has been with­
drawn. There is now no channel of diplomatic
communication between the two countries and
the expediency of providing for one in some
form is submitted to
Congress. Tbe relations
with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey,
and Belgium continue amicable and marked by
no incident of especial importance. A change
of the personal bead of the government of
Egypt has taken place. No change, however,
has occurred in the relations between E ^ypt
and the United States. The action of the
Egyptian government in presenting to the city
of New York one of the ancient obelisks which
possess such historic interest, is highly appre­
ciated as a generous mark of international re­
gard. If prosperity should attend the enter­
prise of its transportation across the Atlantic
its erection in a conspicuous position in
the chief commercial city of the nation, will
be soon accomplished.
JAPAN AMD CHINA.
The treaty made between Japan and thfe
United States in regard to the revision of
former commercial treaties it iB now believed
will be followed by similar action on the part
of other treaty powers. The attention of Con­
gress is again invited to the subject of the
indemnity funds received some years since
from Japan and China, which, with the ac­
cumulated interest, now amount to consider­
able sums. If any part of the funds is
justly due to American citizens they should re­
ceive it promptly and whatever may have been
received by this government in'excess of strictly
just demands, should in some form be returned
to the nations to whom it equitably belongs.
The government of China has signified its
willingness to consider the question of the emi­
gration of its subjects to the United Statea
with diplomatic fairness and to co-operate in
such measures as may tend to prevent inju­
rious consequences to the United States. The
negotiations are still proceeding and will be
pressed with diligence.
A question having arisen between China and
Japan about the Lew Chew islands, the United
States government has taken measures to in­
form these powers of its readiness to extend
its good offices for the maintenance of peace if
they shall mutually deem it desirable and find
it practicable to avail 'themselves of tbe
proffer.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
It is a gratification to be able to annonnce
that through the judicious and energetic action
of the military commandera of the two nations
on cach side of the Rio Grande, under the in
htructions of their respective governments,
raids and depredations bave greatly decreased,
and in tbe localities where formerly most de­
structive have now almost wholly ceased. In
view of this result, I entertain a confident ex­
pectation tbat the continuance of this preva­
lence of qaiet on the border will soon become
so assured as to justify a modification of the
preaeDt orders to our military commanders as
to crossing the border, without encouraging
such disturbances as would endanger the peace
of the two countries.
The third installment of the award against
Mexico, under the claims commission of July
4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in the
course of distribution in pursuance of tbe act
of Congress providing for the same. The sat­
isfactory situation between the two countries
leads me to anticipate an expansion of our
trade with Mexico and an increased contribu­
tion of capital and industry by our people to
the development of tbe great resources of that
country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom
of Congress the provision of suitable legisla­
tion looking to this result.
REPUBLIC OF COLUMBIA.
Diplomatic intercourse with Columbia is.
again fully restored by the arrival of a minister
from that country to the United States. This
is especially fortunate in view of the fact tbat
the question of an inter-oceanic canal baa re­
cently assumed a new and important aspect and
is now under discussion with the Central Amer­
ican countries, through whose territory the
canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to
pass. It is trusted that enlightened states­
manship on their part will see that the early
prosecution of such a work will largely enure
to the benefit not only of their own citizens
and those of the United States, but of the com­
merce of the civilized world. It iB not doubted
that should the work be undertaken under the
protective auspices of tho United States, and
upon satisfactory concessions for tbe right of
way and security by the Central American
government, the capital for its completion
would be readily furnished from this country
anci_ Europe, which might, such guarantees
failing, prove inaccessible.
SOUTH AMERICA.
Diplomatic relations with Chili have also
been strengthened by the reception of a minis­
ter from that country. Tho war between Peru,
Bolivia and Chili still continues, ^be United
States bave not deemed it proper to interpose
in the matter farther than to convey to all the
governments concerned the evidence that the
friendly offices of the government of the United
States for tbe restoration of peace upon an hon­
orable basis will be extended in caso the bellig­
erents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil and
the Argentine republic, and trade with those
countries is improving. A provision for regu­
lar and more frequent mail communication in
our own ships between tbe ports of this country
and tho nations of South America seems to me
to deserve the attention of Congress as an essen­
tial precursor of an enlargement of our com­
merce with them, and an extension of onr car­
rying trade.
A recent revolution in Venezuela has been
fo.lowed by the establishment of a provisional
government. This government has not yet
been formally recognized, and it is deemed de­
sirable to await the proposed action of the
people, which is expected to give it the sanc­
tion of constitutional forms.
