might pass unnoticed. Before quitting
the valley they halted their heaving
horses and, selecting a stagnant pool,
scoured the grease paint from their
features as best they could. Their
ears were strained for sounds of pur
suit, but as the moments passed and
none came the tension eased sonie
,what, and they conversed guardedly.
'As the morning light spread they
crossed the moss capped summit of the
range, but' paused again, and, remov
ing two saddles, hid them among the
rocks. Slapjack left the others here
and rode southward down the Dry
Creek trail toward town, while the
partners shifted part of the weight
from the overloaded ppek mules to the
remaining saddle animals and con
tinued eastward along the barren
comb of hills on foot,, leading the five
horses. v.
"It don't seem like we'll get away
this easy," said Dextry, scanning the
back trail. "If we do, I'll be tempted
to roller the business reg'lar. This
trease paint on my face makes me
umell like a minstrel man. I bet we'll
get some bully . press notices tomor
row.-'
"I, wonder what Helen was doing
there," Glenlster answered Irrelevant
ly, for he had been more shaken by
his encounter with her than at his part
In the rest of the enterprise, and his
mind, which should have been busied
with the flight, held nothing but pic
tures of her as she stood in the half
darkness under the fear of bis Win
chester. "What If sh ever learned
who that black ruffian was!" He
ijiialled at the thought.
"Say, Dex, I am going to marry that
girl."
"I dunno if you be or not," 6aid Dex
try. "Better watch McNamara."
"What?" The younger man stopped
And stared. "What do you mean?"
"Go on. Don't stop the horses. I
ain't blind. I kin put two an' two to
gether.". "You'll never put those two together.
Nonsense! Why, the man's a rascal.
I wouldn't let him have her. Besides,
It couldn't be. She'll find him out. I
love her so much that oh, my feelings
are too big to talk about." He moved
his hands eloquently. "You can't un
derstand.", "TJm-m! I s'pose not," grunted Dex
try, but bis eyes were level and held
the light of the past.
"ne may be a rascal,"' the old man
continued, after a little. "I'll put in
with, you on that, but he's a handsome
devil, and as for manners he makes
you look like a logger. He's a brave
man too. Them three qualities are
trump cards and warranted to take,
most any queen In the human deck
red, white or yellow."
"If he dares," growled Glenlster,
while his thick brows came forward,
and ugly lines hardened in his face.
In the gray of the early morning
they descended the foothills into the
wide valley of the Nome river and
filed out across the rolling country to
the river bluffs where, cleverly con
cealed among the willows, was n
rocker. This they set up, then pro
ceeded to wash the dirt from the sacks
carefully, yet with the utmost siecd,
for there was serious danger of dis-.

ure of the richest ground since the
days of '49, and the men worked with
uhlning eyes and hands a-trerable. The
gold was coarse, and many ragged, yel
low lumps, too large to pass through
the screen, rolled in the hopper, while
the aprons bellied with Its weight. Iu
the pans which they had provided there
grew a gleaming heap of wet, raw gold.
Shortly, by divergent routes, the part
ners rode unnoticed into town and Into
the excitement of the holdup news,
while the tardy still lingered over
their breakfasts. Far out In the road
stead lay the "Roanoke, black smoke
pouring from her .stack. A tug was re
turning from its last trip to her.
Glenlster forced his lathered
down to the beach and questioned the
longshoremen who hung about.
"No. It's too late to get aboard
the last tender is on its way back,"
they informed him. "If you want to
go to the 'outside,' you'll have to wait
for the fleet. That only means another
week, and-there she blows now."
A ribbon of white mingled with the
velvet from the steamer's ftinnel, and
there came a slow, throbbing, farewell
Glenlster'x Jaw clicked and squared.
"Quick, you men!" be cried to the

snatched a valise and swept Into It a
litter of documents from the table.
'Hurry up, man!" ho yelled, as the
lawyer dived frantically about his of
fice In a rabbit-like hunt for Items
"My heavens, are you dead? Wake
up! The ship's leaving." With sleep
still In bis eyes, Wheaton was dragged
down the street to the beach, where a
knot had assembled to witness the
race. As they tumbled Into the bkiff,
willing hand run it out luto the surf
on the crest of a roller. A few lifting
heaves and they were over the bar
with the men ut the oars bending the
wliitc ash at every swing.
"I guess I didn't forget anything,"
gasped Wheaton as he put on his coat
"I got ready yesterday, but I couldn't
find you last night, so I thought the
deal was on."
Gicnistcr stripped off his coat and,
facing the bow, pushed upou t.he oars
at every stroke, thus adding his
strength to that cf the oarsmen. They
crept rapidly out from the beach, eat
ing up the two miles that lay toward
the ship. lie urged the men with, all
his power till the sweat soaked
through their clothes and, under their
flinging shirts, the muscles stood out
like iroD. They had covered half the
fistancc when Wheaton uttered a cry
and Glenlster desisted, from his work
with a curse. The Kounoke was mov
ing slowly.
The rowers jested, but the young
man shouted at them to begin again
and, seizing a boat book, stuck it into
the arm of his coat. He waved this
on high while the men redoubled their
efforts. For many moments they hung
In suspense, watching the black hull
as it gathered speed, and then, as they
were about to cease their effort, a puff
of steam burst from its whistle and
the next moment a short toot of recog
nition reached them. Glenlster wiped
the moisture from his brow and grin
ned at Wheaton.
A quarter of an hour later as they
lay heaving below the ship's steel sides
he thrust a heavy buckskin sack Into
the lawyer's hand.

I don't know how much, but It's

A sailor cast them a whirling rope,
up which Wheaton clambered; then.
tying the gripsack to Its end, they sent
It after.
"Important!" the young man yelled
at the officer on the bridge. "Govern
incnt business.". He heard a muffled
clang in the engine room, the. thrash
of the propellers followed, and the big
ship glided past.
As Glenlster dragged Jjlmself up the
beach upon landing Helen Chester call
ed to him and made room for him be
side her. It had never been necessary
to call him to her side before, and
equally unfamiliar was the abashment
or perhaps physical weariness that led
the young man to sink back In the
warm sand with a sigh of relief. She
noted that for the first time the au
dacity was gone from his eyes.
"I watched your race," she began.
"It was very exciting, and I cheered
for you."
He smiled quietly.
"What made you keep on after the
ship started? I should have given up
and cried."
"I never give up anything that I
want," he said.
"Have you never been forced to?
Then it is because you are a man.
Women have to sacrifice a great deal."
Helen expected him to continue to
the effect that he would never give her
up It was in accordance with his ear
lier presumption but he was silent,
and she was not sure that she liked
him as well thus as when he over
whelmed her With the boldness of his
suit. For Glenlster It was delightful,
after the perils of the night, to rest
In the calm of her presence and to feel
dumbly that she was near. She saw
him secretly caress a fold of her dress.
If only (she had not the memory of
that one night on the ship. "Still, he
is trying to make amends In the best
way he can," he thotight. "Though
of course no woman could care for a
man who would do such a thing." Yet
she thrilled at the thought of how he
had thrust his body tiotween her and
danger; how, but for, his quick, insist
ent action, she would have Xalled in
escaping from the pest ship, failed in
her mission and met death on the night
of her landing. She owed him much.
"Did you hear what happened to the
ood ship Ohio?" she asked.
, No. I've been too busy to inquire.
I was told the health officers quaran
tined her when she arrived, that's all."
"She Tras sent to Egg island with
every cne aboard. She has been there
more than a month now and may not
get away this summer."
What n disappointment for the poor
devils on ltfr!"
Ye5, and only for what you did, I
should te one of them," Helen 're
marked. I didn't do much," he said. 'The
fighting pifct is easy. It's not half so
hard us to 'give up your property and
He still while"
Did you do that because I asked
you to because I asked you to put
aside the old ways?" A wave of com
passion swept over her.
"Certainly," he answered. "It didn't
come easy, but" . ; i
"Oh, I thank you,- saia 6ne.
Know it is nil for tho best. Uncle
Arthur wouldn't do anything wrong,
aud Mr. McNamara is an v honorable
man."
He turned toward her to epeak, but
refrained. He could not tell her what
ho felt certain of. She believed in her
own blood and In hermucle's friends
cud It v,is not for him to speak of
McNaiuani. The rules of the game
sealed his lips.
She was thinking again, "If only you
had not acted as you did." She longed
to help him now In his trouble as he
had helped her, but . what could she
do? The law was such a confusing,
intricate, perplexing thing.
"I spent last night at the Midas," she
told him, "and rode . back early this
morning. That was a daring holdup,
wasn't It?"
"What holdup?"
"Why, haven't you heard the news?
"No," he answered steadily. "I just
got up."
"Your claim was robbed. Thr6e men
overcame the watchman at midnight
and cleaned the boxes."
His simulation of excited astonish
ment was perfect, and he rained 'a
shower of questions upon her. She
noted with approval that he did not
look her in tbeveye, however, ne was
not an accomplished liar. Now, Mc
Nainara had a countenance of iron.
Unconsciously she made comparison,
and the young man at her side did not
lose thereby. '
"Yes, I saw it all," she concluded,
after recounting the details. "The no
gro wanted to bind me so that I could
not give the alarm, but his chivalry
prevented. He was a most gallant
darky."
"What did you do when they left?"
"Why, I kept my word and waited
until they were out of sight; then I
roused the camp and set Mr. McNa
mara and his men right after them
flown the gulch."
"Down the gulch!" spoke Glenlster,
off his guard.
"Yes, of course. Did. you think they
went upstream?" She was looking
squarely at him now, and he dropped
his eyes. "No; the posse started In
that direction, but I put them right."
There w'as an odd light in her glance,
and he felt the blood drumming In his
ears.
She sent them downstream! So' that
was why there had been no pursuit!
Then she must suspect she must know
everything! Glenlster was stunned.
Again his love for the girl surged tu
raultuously within him and demanded
expression. But Miss Chester, no long
er feeling sure that she had the situa
tion in hand, had already started to
return to the hotel. "I saw the mn
distinctly," she told him before they
separated, "and I could Identify them
all."
At his own house Glenlster found
Dextry removing the stains of the
night's adventure.
"Miss Chester recognized us last
night," he announced.
"How do you know?"
"She toldln? so just now, and what's
more she Sent McNamara and his
crowd down the creek instead of up.
That's why we got away so easily."
"Well, well ain't she a brick? She's
even with us now. By the way, I
wonder how much we cleaned up, any
howlet's weigh it." Going to the bed,
Dextry turned back the blankets, 'ex
posing four mooseskln sacks, wet and
heavy, where he had thrown them.
"There must have been $20,000 with
what I gave Wheaton," said Glenlster.
At that moment, without warning,
the door was flung open, a,nd as the
young man Jerked the blankets Into
place he whirled, snatched the six
shooter that Dextry had discarded and
covered the entrance.
"Don't 6hoot, boy!" cried the new
comer, breathlessly. "My, but you're
nervous!"
Glenlster dropped his gun. It was
Cherry Malotte, and from her heaving
breast and the flying colors in her
cheeks the men saw she had been
running. She did not give them time
to question, but closed and locked the
door whilo the words came tumbling
from her:
"They're on to you, boys you'd bet
ter duck out quick. They're on their
way up here now."
"What!"
"Who?"
"Quick! I hoard McNamara and
Voorhees, the marshal, talking. Some
body has spotted you for the holdups.
They're on their way now, I tell you.
I sneaked out by the back way and
came here through the mud. Say, but
I'm a sight!" She stamped her trimly
booted feet and flirted her skirt.
"I don't savvy what you mean," said
Dextry, glancing at his partner warn-
ingly. "We rtln't done nothin'.".
"Well, It's all right then. I took a
long chance so you could make a get

got warrants for you for that sluice

robbery last night. Hero they are
now." She darted to the window, the
men peering over her shoulder. Com
ing np the narrow walk they saw
Voorhees, McNamara aud three others.
The house stood somewhat isolated"
and well back on the tundra, so that
any one approaching It by the plank
ing had an unobstructed view of the
premises. Escape was impossible, for
the back door led out into the aukie
deep puddles of the oien prairie, and
It was now apparent that a sixth man
had made a circuit and was approach
ing from the rear,
"My God! They'll-search the place,"
said Dextry, and ,the men looked grim
ly in' each other' faces.
Then in a flash Glenlster stripped
back the blankets and seized the
"iwkes," leaping into the ba& room.
In another Instant he returned with
them and faced desperately the candid
bareness of the little room that they
lived and slept In. Nothing could be
hidden; it was folly to think of it.
There was a loft overhead, he remem
bered hopefully, then realized that tho
pursuers would search there first of
all.
"I told you he was a hard fighter,"
said Dextry as the quick footsteps
grew louder. "Ho ain't no fool, nei
ther. 'Stead of our bein' caught. In
the mountains, I reckon we'll shoot it
out here. We should have cached that
gold somewhere."
He Fj'im the cylinder of his black
ened Colt, while his face grew hard
and vulture-like.
Meanwhile Cherry Malotte watched
the hunted l6ok in Glenister's face
grow wilder and then stiffen Into the
stubbornness of a mau at bay. The
posse was at the door now, knocking.
The three inside stood rigid and strain
ed. Then Glenlster tossed his burden
on the bed.
''Go1 Into the back room, Cherry,
there's going to be trouble."
"Who's there?" Inquired Dextry
through the door, to guin time. Sud
denly, without a word, the -girl glided
to the hot blast heater, now cold and
empty, which stood in a comer of the
room. These stoves, used widely in
the north, are vertical iron cylinders
Into which coal is poured from above.
She lifted the lid and peered ln to
find it a quarter full of dead ashes,
then turned with shining eyes and
parted lips to Glenister. He caught
the hint, and in an Instant the four
sacks were dropped softly into the
feathery bottom and the ashes raked
over. The daring maneuver was al
most as quick as the flash of woman's
wit ths.t prompted It and was carried
through while the answer to Dcxtry's
question was still unspoken.
Then Glenister opened the door care
lessly and admitted the group of men.
"We've got a search warrant to iool
through your house," said Voorhees.
"What are you looking for?"
"Gold dust from Anvil creek."
"All right search away,"
They rapMly scoured the premises,
covering every inch, paying no heed
to the girl, who watched them with
Indifferent eyes, nor to the old man,
who glared at their every movement
Glenlster was carelessly sarcastic, al
though he kept his right arm free,
while beneath his sangfroid was a
thoroughly trained alertness.
McNamara directed the search with
a manner wholly lacking In his former
mock courtesy. It was as though he
had been soured by the gall of defeat.
The mask had fallen off now, and his
character showed Insistent, overbear
ing, cruel. Toward the partners he
preserved a contemptuous silence.
The invaders ransacked thoroughly,
while a dozen times the hearts of
Cherry Malotte and her two compan
ions stopped, then lunged onward, as
McNamara or Voorhees approached,
then passed the stove. At last Voorhees
lifted the lid and peered into its dark
Interior. At the. same instant the girl
cried out sharply, flinging herself from
her position while the marshal jerked
Ins head back in time to see her dash
upon Dextry.
'Don't! Don't!" She cried her ap
peal to the old man. "Keep cool
You'll be sorry, Dex they're almost
through."
The officer had not seen any move
ment on Dextry's part, but doubtless
her quick eye had detected sigus of
violence. McNamara emerged, glower
ing, from the back room at that mo
ment. "Let them hunt," the girl was saying.
while Dextry stared dazedly over her
head. "They won't find anvthlnir.
Keep cool and don't act rash."
Voorhees' duties sat uncomfortably
upon him at the best, and, looking at
the smoldering eyes of the two men.
ho became averse to further search
In, n powdery household whose mem
bers Itched to shoot him in the back.
"It Isn't here," he reported, but the
politician only scowled, then spoke for
tho first time directly to the partners:
"I ve got warrants for both of you,
and I'm tempted to take you In, but I
wont. I m not through yet not by
any means. I'll get you get you
both." He turned out of the door. fnl.
lowed by the marshal, who called off
his guards, and the group filed back
along tho walk.
"Say, you're a Jewel, Cherry. You've
saved us twice. You caught Voorhees
Just In time. My heart hit my palate
when he looked into that stove, but
the next Instant I wanted to laugh at
Dextry's expression."
Impulsively Glenlster laid his hands
upon her shoulders. At his look and
touch her throat swelled, her bosom
heaved and the silken lids fluttered
until she seemed choked bv n very
flood of sweet womanliness. She
blushed like u little maid and laughed
a timid, broken laugh. Then, pulling
herself together, the merry careless
tone came into her voice, and her
cheeks grew cool and clear.
You wouldn't trust me at first, ch?
Some day you'll find that your old
friends are the best after all.".
And as she left them she added 1
mockingly:
"Say, you're a pair of 'hhlne' des
peradoes. You need a governess."

POLITICAL
Ridgcly For a Central Bank.
During the evening devoted to "Les
sons of the Financial Crisis" by the
American Academy of Political .and
Social Science at Philadelphia many
financial experts advocated a central
government bank as the true remedy,
among them Comptroller of. the Cur
rency ilidgely, whose defense of the
president was cheered by the audi
ence. He Insisted that the causes of
the panic were worldwide and that the
critics of the president had done more
than any one else to unsettle the finan
cial conditions of the country. The
central bank In some form was advo
cated by Bankers Schiff, Seligman,
Kash and others.
Senator Forcker's Candidacy.
The letter written by Senator For
tker of Ohio in response to the reso
lutions of the Ohio Republican league
committees last week was his formal
announcement of willingness to accept
support to the end of his becoming the
candidate of the party for the presi
dency. In it the senator virtually laid
(Town his platform by saying he will
feTick to his policy of opposition to
executive encroachment and by oppos
ing tariff tinkering.
Fowler Predicts Disaster.
Upon the eve of the opening of con
gress Representative Fowler of New
Jersey, head of the bouse banking and
furrency committee, issued a predic
tion of coming financial tragedy of far
greater, proportions than the present
panic unless we' stop issuing a fixeti
bond secured currency. He says that
the banks of the country today have
about $12,000,000,000 in deposits and
about the same amount of loans out
standing, against which they hold re
serves of only $900,000,000, 7 of which
$200,000,000 Is In bank notn promises.
This he calls "the worst and wildest
form of Inflation." He defines It as
"basing one credit upon another cred
it;" hence he, deems the credit curren
cy the safest because it would always
be sent to banks of issue promptly
and necessitate proper reserves.
The Man Without a Party.
The refusal of the house Republican
caucus to admit Representative Peter
A. Torter after he had expressed his
desire to be counted among the Re
publicans left that new member in the
role of the man without a party, for
already he had objected to being listed
as a Democrat Porter was elected as
an independent Republican - in the
Twenty-fourth New York district by a
large majority over James W. Wads
worth on the regular Republican tick
et at the time Wadsworth was suffer
ing for his stand against the presi
dent's meat inspection bill In congress.
That is why they say that Porter "rode
Into congress on a cow."
Bryan Likes the Message.
W. . J. Bryan Is quoted as being in
accord with much of the president's
message to congress. In particular he
likes the recommendation that the gov
ernment pay the expenses of elections,
only he would add a provision against
frlvate contributions. He also strong
ly approves of the postal and guaran
teed banks.
Naming Fowler, Snubs Piatt.
The nomination of Edward S. Fowler
as collector of the port of New York
without the knowledge or approval of
the New ,York senators was regarded
as a direct snub of Piatt, who has al
ways had much to say about this im
portant political plum. Fowler Is
known as a "Roosevelt Democrat" and
Is an old personal friend and former
employer of Secretary Cortelyou. New
York papers unfriendly to the presi
dent say It is a sign that he is trying
to keen the oreanization from sending
a Hughes delegation to the national
convention.
