At a meeting of Catholics in Vienna a

for the murder of his infant child. The
child was brutally beaten, and, literally
whipped to death. Its body presented a
a sickening sight. It was black from its

sorrow in the least, but since his imprison:
ment has been trying to throw the respond,
bility of the child's death upon a woman

A Bill to Perpetuate the National Banks
Washington, D. C, "December 7. The
bill to perpetuate the national banking sys
tem, which will be introduced by Senator
Farwell, as soon as the committees are
formed, provides that a national bank may
be organized by depositing with the treas
urer of the United States in lien of the
United States registered lands (as now re
quired) any state or municipal bonds, or
any first mortgage railroad bonds, whose
cash value is equal to a greater amount than
their par value and whose interest doesnot
fall below four per cent. Several conditions
inodif this regulation. The treasurer shall
not receive the state or municipal bonds at
more . than 75 per cent, of their
par value nor the first mortgage
railroad bonds at more than 50 per cent of
their par value. He6hall not receive any
railroad bonds exceeding in total more than
$500,000,000. The approval of the secretary
of the treasury and the comptroller of the
currency is necessary, ana circulation may
be issued on these bonds, only in the pro
portion in which they are received. One
section provides that whenever the comp
troller has ascertained that any bank has re
fused to pay its circulating notes he may .in
stead of cancelling its bonds, cause so much
of them as may be necessary to redeem its
outstanding note3 to be sold at auction in
New York, orhc may proceed in the United
States court to collect such bonds as
fast as they shall mature. For
any deficiency in the proceeds of all bonds
of an association, when thus sold or collec
ted, to reimburse the United States for the
amount expended in paying the circulating
notes of the association. The United States
shall have a paramount lien upon all its as
sets, and such deficiency shall be made out
of such assets in preference to any and all
other claims whatsoever, except the neces
sary costs and expenses of administering
the same.
Many rumors were current this afternoon
relative to the distribution of the chairman
ships. Little credence is generally given to
them, however, owing to the fact that many
changes in the list are inevitable, even after
it shall have been advanced much nearer to
completion than it is presumed to be at
present. The appointment of a committee
on rules. which will probably be
made in a day or two, is awaited with special
interest, for the reason that the chairman of
the committee on ways and means has
always been a member of the committee on
rules, and the arrangement of Mr. Mor
rison's successor on the lasv named commit
tee will be generally regarded as tantamount
tothe selection of the chairman of the com
mittee on ways and rdfans.

Report of the Chief of the Secret Service
Division.
Washington, D. C, December 7. The
annual report of the chief of the secret ser
vice division of the treasary wos made pub
lic to-day. It shows tnat thsra were 355
persons arrested by the ofhcbrs of the ser
vice during the past fiscal 3rear for violation of
the laws against counterfeiting, etc. Of this
number seventy were convicted and sentenced
to imprisonment. The report says that the
counterfeiting'now being done is principally
the work of Italians, who operate in bands
in different portions of the eonntry. The
counterfeiting done during the past year
amounts practically to nothing, the only at
tempt m that direction being a $10 silver
certificate and a $2 silver certificate, and
these were such poor imitations as to be
practically harmless. The report refers to
the fact that all but two of the many skilled
operators arrested since the war for counter
feiting United States bonds, are now at liber
ty, and says they may be expected to resume
their nefarious operations at any time.
The report attributes the scarcity of coun
terfeit money to excellence of the work
done at the bureau of engraving and print
ing, and to the almost certainty of punish
ment 6f the offendexs.
Russia is Suspicious.
Pabis, December 7. According to private
advices from Warsaw the massing of
Russian troops on the frontier is attributa
ble to information received by Russia of a
concerted plan by Germany and Austria for
united action in the event of war between
either of these powers and Russia. In that
contingency it was proposed that Germany
and Austria should suddenly invade Russia
nextto Poland and occupy Warsaw by using
their greater facilities for mobilizing. In
consequence of the discovery of this alleged
project, Russia resolved to compensate for
her slow power of mobilizing by permanent
increase of her frontier forces. The move
implies no aggression, but is a purely de
fensive precaution.
Released on Rail.
New York, December 8, An application
was made before Judge Lawrence to-dhy in
the supreme court for admission to bail of
Johann Most, in who"o case an appeal has
been taken from the judgment of the court

granted and Most released on $5,000 bail,

agriculture for information as to whether'
any person in the employment of that de
partment, making experiments as to the

follows: "Gentlemen of the committee,: As
stated in the call, this meeting is for the
purposetof selecting a time and place foiv
holding the next republican national con
vention, also to consider such other matters
as may properly be brought before it. The
momemtum acquired by twenty-five years
of prevalence of republican principles has
not yet lost its force, and the material inter
est of the country are still prosperous, as
result of republican industrial legislation.
Recent utterances, however, indicate the
determination to end this prosperity by ad
verse legislation forced upon the country by
an administration hostile to American in
dustry; and also indicate the necessity of a
return to yower of the republican party in
national government so that American in
dustry, wool growing, sugar raising, equally
with iron making, and that production may
have continued prosperity, and employes in
these industries have constant employment
and continued good wages, such as Ameri
can workmen should receive." The roll was
then called and every state and territory
with one or two exceptions was represented
by a delegate or proxy.
The committee then proceeded to vote
formally by ballot each state or territory
representative stepping up to the chair
man's table as the state or territory was
called, and depositing his vote in a hat.
The ballots thus deposited were counted by

MOBTEDBT THIS PRESIDENT
The members or the Evangelical Alliance
Are Accorded aKeception at the "White
House Kev. Dr, Burchard Among: Thoe
Present.
Washington, D. C, December 9. llie
White house this afternoon was invaded bj
nearly 2,000 members of the Evangelical
Alliance, who called in a body about 1
o'clock to pay their respects to the Presi
dent and Mrs. Cleveland. They were re
ceived in the east room and were individu
ally presented to the President and Mrs.
Cleveland, by Mr. William Dodge,president
of the Alliance and ColsnelJohn W. Wil
son. The president said: "I am glad to meet
so large a delegation of the Evangelical Alli
ance of the United States. I understand the
purpose of this Alliance to be the applica
tion of christian rules of conduct to
problems and exigencies of social and
political officers. Such a movement cannot
fail to -produce most valuable results. All
must admit that the reception of teachings
of Christianity results in the purest patriotc
ism and a most scrupulous fidelity of publi
trust, and in the best type of citizenship,
those who manage the affairs of the govern
ment are by this means reminded that the
law of God demands tEat they should be
courageously .true to the interests of the
people, and that the ruler of the universe
will require of them a strict account of theii
stewardship. The people, too, are thua
taught that their happiness and t welfare will
be best 'prompted by a continuous regard
for the interest of common brotherhood, and
that the success of government by
the people depends upon the moral
ity, justice and honesty of the people. I am
especially pleased to know that your efforts
are not cramped and limited by denomina
tional lines, and that your credentials are
founded on broad christian fellowship, es
pecially if you seek to teach your country
men toleration, you, yourselves, must be
tolerant- If you would teach them to be
liberal for the opinions of each other, you,
yourselves, must be liberal; and if you
would teach them unselfish patriotism, you,
yourselves, must be unselfish and patriotic.
There is enough of work in the field you
have entered to enlist the heartfelt co-operation
of all who believe in and value the
efficacy of christian teaching and prac
tice. Your noble mission, if undertaken in
a broad and generous spirit, will surely ar
rest attention and respectful consideration
of your fellow citizens, and your endeavors
consecrated by benevolence and patriotic
love, must exert a poweful influence in the
enlightment and improvement of our peo
ple, in illustrating and in advancing the
frosp&rity and greatness of our beloved
and. Rev. Dr. Burchard, of New York, of
three "R's" fame, was among those pre
sented. The president recognized him at
once, and advancing toward him, said, with
considerable earnestness and fervor, that he
was very glad to see him, whereupon the
crowd of delegates broke out in a laughter.

Application Denied.
iliNNEAPOLis, December 9. William
Welch, an attorney of this city, published in
a paper called the Home Dairy, charges that
Postmaster General Vilas worked for the
Madison Insurance company and never ac
counted for some of the funds of the com
pany. Welch was indicted by the grand
jury for criminal libel, as he claims, at the
instigation of Vilas. To-day the court , de
nied his aDDhcation for an order for com
plainants to show cause why they shouldnot
produce the missing books of the Madison
Insurance company. He was granted ten
days more in which to file a bill of specifica
tions. Found Guilty of Murder.
Dubijn, December 10. The trial of seven
men indicted for manslaughter for killing
Constable Whelhan at Lisdoonvarnaj county
Clare, was concluded to-day. The jury was
unable to agree in the case of the two Mur
phys, but returned a verdict of guilty
against O'Leary and four other prisoners.
O'Leary was sentenced to ten years impris
onment and the other four to seven years
each.
Death of Captain Blackford.
Washington. D. C, Decemper 9. Captain
S. S. Blackford, formerly of the Capital po
lice, dropped dead on Indiana avenue, in
this city, about 1050 this norning. He was
connected with the agricultural department
at the time of his death. Captain Blackford
has been a familiar figure about the com
missioner's office fdnceihe beginning of the
license year, and be has probably done more
hard work in the temperance cause than any
other person in the district.
THEY HAS NO TEFENSK.
The Case Submitted to the Jury Without
Argument.
Ctnoinnattt, O., Dec 10. The sudden
elose of the Harper trial, without argument,
was no surprise to any one who had watched
the progress of the testimony and had
knowledge of the law. Ho counsel
could have gone before that jury to defend a
man who had testified to acts that must be
declared by the court to be criminal and the
government counsel had no need to argue
when the defendant himself had proven the
government's case. It was therefore left to
his little child to make, by its innocent
presence the only plea that
could be made for the great
banker and that could only be
a plea for mercy from the judge.
But it seemed to have been ineffectual.
While the judge was declaring the law to the
jury Judge Jackson doubtless felt that in
that duty there was no place for mercy.
Certainly he spoke with rigid clearness and
unflinching seventy. His review of the tes
timony showed a remarkably clear under
standing of the whole matter, and his sum
ming up of Harper's misdeeds was a stun
ning blow to any hope of mercy that may
have crept into the defendant's mind.
The magnitude of the amounts involved,
the frequency with which wrongful acts were
committed all were shown in their strongest
light by the judge as he detailed from mem
ory tne testimony. His legal mind saw so
clearly what the verdict ought to be that he
used the most unmistakable - language. He
said: "The court instructs you that upon
the defendant's own testimony Har
per has committed a crime as
described in the statute under
which he is indicted." The charge was in
writing, except that portion in which he re
viewed the testimony. It was delivered
with great earnestness. The jury waB moved
from its position on the side of the room to
the space directly in front of the court, thus
removing Mrs. Harper and her babe from
their view and allowing the court to speak
to them with no hindrance whatever. Har
per and Blackburn sat in the corner of the
room on the right. Near them were several
oflicers ready for any emergency.
When the charge was ended Har
per was for a time almost alone,
then Mrs. Harper brought her babe and sat
beside him. Miss Matthews and Mr. Mat
thews came also and the family group sat
silent and tearful, but with no outbursts.
Soon Mr. Harper was removed from the
courtroom. Later it was agreed to ad
journ the court until Monday when the
jury's verdict will be received if they are
ready. Judge Jackson has been wisely
commended throughout the trial for
his fairness, his thorough grasp
ing of the whole case, his
ready rulings and for his lucid
charge to the jury. No exceptions have
been taken for the reason that there is no
appeal from this court, but really there has
been no disposition to question the rulings
made. Judge Sage, who sat with Judge
Jackson, has concurred in all the rulings
made so that no opportunity exists for a re
hearing. The district attorney, Mr.
Burnett, has made an exhaustive exam
ination of the statutes and of
the precedents and has reached the conclus
ion which it is understood is shared by the
court that there is no authority for a sen
tence on each of the thirty-three counts if
he should be found guilty on all. The sen
tence, therefore, cannot be for a longer
term than ten years, and this may be short
ened by good conduct to seven years, five
months and ten days.
ARKANSAS TRAIN ROBBERY.
The Express Car Bobbed on a St I.ouis,
Arkansas & Texas Train The Passengers
and the Robbers Much Agitated.
St. Louis, December 10. The informa
tion is just received here that the train bound
north over the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas
railroad was stopped by train robbers ten
miles this side of Texarkana, Ark., last
night and the express car, mail and pas
sengers all relieved of cash. The amount
is not yet known. Governor Hughes has
jut received the following from General
Superintendent Haman, of the St. Louis,
Arkansas & Texas railroad:
Texabkana, Ark.,. December 10.
To Hon. S. P. Hughes, governor:
Our northbound passenger train was
robbed about ten miles north of here last
evening about 7 o'clock by three masked
men. The express car robbed. The passen
gers and mail not molested. Have started
armed posses from here north and from
Leadville south. A posse has also gone up
the Iron Mountain road to Mandeville. The
sheriff will watch the roads leading to this
place. Signed. W. P. Haman.
Governor nugnes nas onerea $zuu ior tne
arrest and conviction of each robber. The
railroad company also offers several thous
and dollars reward. JLhe amount tanen is
said to reach $40,000.
A Pine Bluff special says the robbery oc
curred about 7 o'clock last night twelve
miles north of Texarkana on the train bound
north. K. P. Johnson, postal clerk, on duty
at the time, says the train was suddenly
stopped when moving out of Geneva
station. He saw three rough looking men
board the engine and he knew something
was wrong, so he blew out the lights in his
compartment and locked the doora. The
express messenger did the same thing. The
three robbers were armtd with a Winchester
rifle and a ccuple of pistols each. They or
dered the doors opened and fired several
shots through the windows. They then used
a pickax and Johnson fired one shot
through the window, which was answered
by a volley. Finding resistance useless, and
the lives of the engineer and fireman at
stake, the express messenger opened his
doors, when a light was struck and a search
by the robbers began. Johnson does not
know accurately, but thinks the robbers must
have gotten $10,000. Agood deal of Louisiana
lottery money went up in small denomina
tions. The leader of the robbers was much
agitated, and the mail clerk told him that
he was more scared than he -(Johnson) was.
Johnson says he would know cse of the
men anywhere. The leader weighs 200
pounds and is a thick, heavy set man, very
rough, bfg hands and feet, and blue eyes.
The - conductor opened the door and
was fired on. There was a panic
among the passengers, who seemed
paralyzed with fear. After robbing the ex
press car they entered the mail car. John
son expostulated that that was Uncle Sam's
dominion and that they already had a good
deal of booty and that if they disturbed the
mails it would go hard with them. One re
plied "that's so" and that they wouldn't touch
the mails. Great excitement prevails in the
region of th9 robbery and mounted men are
scouring the woods everywhere. Officials at
Louisville, as soon as notified,went out with
a posse. Have not learned the extent of the
robbing of the passengers. After the rob
bery officers were'soon on the ground and
two of them had a running fight with the
robbers for about a mile and
a habr. One robber lost his hat
and cartridge box Another was
wounded, as was sjown by blood
along the trail. All the parties were mounted,
and so far the robbers have escaped, al
though their capture is hourly expected, as
the officers are scouring the country m every
direction. The passengers were not molested.
In the Presence of Royalty.
London, December 9. John L. Sullivan
boxed with Jack Ashton in the presence of
the Prince of Wales to-night. The pugilist
was introduced to the piince, who expressed
himself as highly delighted with the per
formance. His Condition Unchanged.
-London, December 9. It is stated, on
what is said to be reliable authority, that the
doctors attending the German crown prince
have not changed their opinions as regards
his case, and that the optimist
cently taken are baseless.

death. In the majority of cases
where there is such a scarcity
it is partially the fault of the railroad com
panies and dealers. Th latter did not or
der coal until late in the fall, then the mines
were not of sufficient capacity to supply or
ders. The railroad company say that they
would be cut short if all the dealers were
supplied, and by one pretext or another
failed to deliver coal to the dealers, but put
such restrictions and rates upon it that the
miners were compelled to furnish them in
advance. Their supply is not limited, but
they have hoarded it up to the detriment
and suffering of thousands of people who
have settled on the prairies of western and
southern Kansas.
A Double Tragedy.
Chicago, Decembrr 12. A double tragedy
took place last night on the Wharton plan
tation, ten miles from here. '-A- tenant on
the plantation named James Porter
quarrelled with his wife, and grabbing his
Winchester he ran out of the house, declar
ing he was going to leave her forever. Whea
he reached the yard he turned and shot his
wife through the window, killing her in
stantly, the bullet penetrating her brain.
Porter then turned the rifle against his own
breast and fired it off with his foot. The
ball tore a fearful hole in his lungs as large
as a man's fist. Porter died in half an v
hour.
