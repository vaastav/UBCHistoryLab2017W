soolii 9ipet-cli of Joe. i rlli t of In
tlianu. Mr. Wiij:bt moved to amend the resolution so
as to make the call upon the President instead ol
the Secretary ot War. In a time like this he was
willing to tru?t tbe Piesiilent, and he wanted none
of that miserable doctrine that could be loyalty to
the (to eminent and disloyalty to the Admiuis
tiaiiou. There was onlv an unconditional lovaltv
to the Government and the party iu j-ower at a
timelik this.
According to this abiuid ilr. W light, the pen
pie, who have jut been voting down "ihe party
in power," at the November election, are alt
"disloyal." The entire city of New Yui k. where
the Republicans were not able to elect even a
Common Councilman, must be stee(ed to thv
eyes and ears in treason; ditto, New Jersey ;iHito,
Ohio, Illinois, and old Connecticut even, (if town
electious mean any thing.) The Senator from
Indiana talks like a madman or a New

the cause of the war to the existence of aluverv,
says: . . . , . , ,
Mr. Lincoln's ingenious, though not original
observation, that, if there had been no slavery
there would have been no rebellion. h,s gome
times been compared wi;h the equally logical e
quence, that if no one traveled on the highways
with money iu his pockets, there wouid be in
highwaymen. The truth is, we may begin in
such a chain of reasoning jut where we tee fit.
It the world had not been create!, with various
;race upon it, of diverse characteristics, capai i
ties and dtsixtHi'ioYis; if the necessities, or opin
.tu. or prejudices of society were not such us
they are, we should have had no free-oil party,
no Chicago pUtform.no division among tha Dem
ocratic prty, giving the opportunity lor the Re
publican minority to succeed, and consequently,
no Mr Lincoln for President. In the latter cae
we should, of course, have had no rebellion.

The Yandetbilt sailed yesterday from the

supposed to meet there two United Sntes steam

and the three will then take a different cour?e.
The names of the steamers cannot be given. At

are runniii of lo-ii every vodueof th t form
ot government which exbl-li ly at
iiiton and bis cotemporwiie. Tbe secret fact
connected with this matter are as follows:
Soon after, the commencement of the present
troubles, certaiu atubmous ,epubl;can' resi.l
l"g the western pait of Viruuia cone to this
city iml had an interview with the President nd
with all the members ol the Cabinet enept Mr.
Cameron, who was .l.en Secretary of War. They
, Rave out, while here, that they lud Leen teut lor

told the truth. Certain it i-, they returned to
their houiei elated at the prospect of very oon
being the Governor, the Senators, the Judges,
Hiid the other chief bt .te ofliceia of a uew Stie;
and very $o-n alter, the incijient steps were taken
iu order to cause a few of the western counties
in Virginia to r-ecede fiout that Slate, and to orm
n new State, which was to luve the euphonious
designation of Kanawha.
I need not recapitulate the arguments proving
the unconstitutionality of the admission m a
Slate of these counties. They will be found in
the able speeches of Mr Conway,' of Kansas
Mr. Logan, of . Virginia, and Mr. Th.iddeus
Stevens, of Pennsylvania, who, to bis honor be
it said, refused to be dragooned into the support
of the wicked bill. Rut the readers ol the Times.
oiigbt to keep constantly in mind the following
facts in relation to this grave subject: 1st, The
Sute of Virginia is us mu'-h one and indi vi-alile
astheStateoi Illinois It is not iu the power of
a sin ill fraction of her people to divide her any
mote th n it is iu the power of a Urge portion ol
her people to drag her out of the Union. The
people of the north west counties of Illinois have
as much right to seceie Iroin ihe Slate ol Illinois,
and lorin "the State of :iiena." as the people ol
these western counties of Vircinia have to form a
new .Stale out of part of Viiginia. The fact
that the State of Vhginia is iu rebellion does not
ulie.-thec i.se Viiginia is sti'lone ol the United
States. No one can deny that. When the Union
m restored, f.u will lake her place again iu the
Union as one ol the States. Rut never, urctr w ill
ehe return to the Union shorn of her strength,
turt uleO of her fair proportions, or with an inch
ol her territory taken from her.
21. The designs of the Piesident and his Cabi
net are by thee developments completely un
masked. Those designs contemplate nothing
less than the asfumtioii of irresponsible and diu
tatoral powers by the Administration; the ne t
tion of at least six new States, carved in this man
ner out of six exiting States; the admission into
the Union also, as States, of lour or five new
Territories, with the certainty of getting from
these ten or eleven new States no less than
twenty or twenty-two new Senator, creatuies
who will owe their seats in the Sena'e to the in
trigues of the Administration, and who will be
but the slavish instruments to execute the be
bests ol the Executive.
These are ihe risks w e are running from our
"Republican" Administration; risks involving
the utter ubversioii of our republican form ol
government, and its eh inge into the most grind
ing tyranny and the most absolute despotism.
Pet haps ihe lesson was needed, in order that ihe
people might learn the value of Democratic
principles. Certain it is, that when, m year from
next fall, the people have an opjiortunity to ex
pi ess their sentiments iu regard to "Republican"
rule, they will do it with an emphasis thai will be
the end of this bogus kind ,of "Republicanism"
lore v er.
It is pleasing to look through the gloom that
now envelops the nation to the bright future that
is certainly in store tor us two years hence. Ry
that time, the madness which has ruled the hour
hitherto will have passed away. Ry that time,
the Congress, whose powers will legally com
uience on the 4;h ot M-rch next, will have done
imii.li toward piepaiing the way for a restoration
of the Union When ome the South is con
inced that the Northern States hae repuoiated
that od om political heresy, modern "Renuhli
t ani-in, an I ha e returned to the Democratic
faith, und bae ptauted their feet bunk on the
rock ot the Constitution, they will have no object
iu continuing the warauy longer, but will lay
down their arms and return to the Union. There
is little prospect that the war will terminate le
fore that time, unless it is terminated by foreign
intervention. If it is matmged in the future as
it has been in the past, it will certainly not have a
successful termination. But it may be dragged
on for two years longer, till our rivers run red
with blood, till half a million of men have fallen
victims to "Republican" fanaticism, and till the
land is failed with widows and orphans, who?ecry
for justice will not be unheeded.
Then, when all thl i past, will come the re
action. The Union will be restored ns of old
Congress will once more reassemble, with a lull
delegation in both houses from the fifteen South
ein States. A Democratic President will end in
a Democratic message. It will have something
to say attout white people, and the interests of
white men. The Congress will proceed to busi
ness. If Sumter, and Lovejoy. mid Wilson, and
Wade, and Ch indler nie there, they w ill take care
to keep civil tongues iu their heads, and to speak
gingerly when they allude to "our wayward sis
ters." United and powerfuloncemore.no foreign
nation will ngain dare to insult us. Tbe Monroe
doctrine will be revived and enforced All things
will be restored as they were before the war, and
(efoie the election which led to the war. The
stars and tripes will wave over every State. Rut
the institutions of every State will be left for each
State to regulate for themselves. Slavery being
a necessity in the Southern States, it will exist
ihere. Ail the ur.justand illegal und unconstitu
tional legislation of the present Congress will be
repealed by thr Congre nf the v hole nation then.
The men who strut their biief hour now will then
be consigned to an endless oblivion. The four
years ot "Republican" rule will be a thing of the
past an epoch ot warnii.g for the future Wc
will be weighed down bv the burden of hetvv
t"xes and enormous debts; but we will be once
uioie united and free The land will be filled
with de-olate homes and achinz hearts, and for
these theie can be no e irthlv recompense. Rui
with the Union as it was, and the Constitution as
it is. e will t ike a Ires!) start iu oar national
life, with the tcTirie experience of the past lur
our warning in all ages to come. It is such a
consummation which the radicals of this Con

peated jiounse to tke Ricbmuu l out -f ban 1 iu
ten davs. could have imagined such a plan. They
hive determined to enter -'Richmond by the air
line railroAd. lrom Wahirstoo. The route by
Aquia Creek and FrelerU kburg is certainly the
aliortest wy between the two cries. It is, in
fact, the in til nute. It ieve:i :dr iter tin n ihe
Mait4ss.ts track; and it is far fv.rier, nt least in
miles, iluu McCleilan's cour.-e ion the l'oto
mac, into the bit. and up the Yoik. Rut, bort
as it appears ou the map arid by the Surveyor's
tape, it may be safely a?sUUievj that it wiil be a
more painful pilgrimage than the longest oi all
the ways around.
Refore Bunide gets rery far he will find that
thete are lions in his patent path Tnere is no
point on that rad wheie our troops cannot con
centrate more rapidly than he can advance. 1 he
Federal.Gover:iinetit and Generals seem to hue
supposed that they would meet aiih no oppo-i
tion till they reu bei Hanover Junction, and
have doubtless lelt some confusion of mind at
finding Lee before them at Frederic kburg. They
have stof pel a wtek near that helple-s and inde
fensible village; aid if they get iuto it, they will
rind it harder to leave than to enter. Thev have
arranged iu the Cbnet tint thete v'ould bo io
battle till their aruiv reached Hanovi-r; but they
may find the plains around Fredericksburg, the
highlands in fiont and ihe river in their tuck, the
prettiest place to be drubbed in that Yankees ever
saw. The whole scheme, now freely displayed
by their journals, in the confidence of success, is
eminently characteristic of the smartest nation in
all creation. They are undoubtedly an ingenious
people, but prune, as ingenious people frequently
are, to the pleasing delusion that all others but
themselves are imbeciles and idiots.
Neither Scott nor McCiellan, nor any other
competent military leader, would ever counsel or
undertake a march on Richmond by the lines ol
the railroads. These were highly favorable to
the drummers ol the gi eat manufacturing powers,
but less so to those who w alk at tin-, head of he i vil v
armed regiments. The vulnerable side of Rich
mond is still what military infellinen e and expe
lience for n hundred years have pointed out, her
river. The llriiish got here that way without
much difficulty. McCiellan attempted to follow
their track with one hundred and lil'tv thousand
men. and would hive got here, too, but for
"Chickahoniiny!" Fortunate for us it is that he
found that warder at our gate-1. The interview
with that personage, and ins greeting ot b'ood and
mud, appear lo have given the Yankees so gteit
a disgust for the Yok aid the James. :md the
pleasant swamp between, that they utterlv re
fuse to go there any mote.
It appears, indeed, that they have determined
to ive the mail Ih-e a f i ial ; and we should not
re illy credit tl eir boldness, but for Ihe grett ra
pacity they xissess nt this time to fill the field
The new lev, even if it has not actual! v re u lied
the six bundled thousand demanded in July, has
certainly brought n rodigious number of men
under nuns. Massed with their old rioop.s, the
United States cannot have less than eight hnn
died thousand men in the-r tirmv at this moment
Abstracting from this bine host all tint themo!
extravagaiitcalciilatioti cm pretend for the armies
of the WeM, and gumd of Washington, the
Northern Government have still some four hun
died thousand men to throw at Ivit-hmood ; and
however much ihe superior valor ol men who
fiht lor aiis et foci, rn iy do, when guide by the
:bler Generals of the Smth. while holding the
vantage ground of po-iiion, there are limits be
yond which the weight of numbers will tell. It
is on their overwhelming numbers that ihn North
ate now iletet mined to ielv Relieving th it all
dei-emls on the immediate destt uction of the Con
federate organiz ition, which might be eile -ted bv
the captuie of Ri huiond und the c inpie-t ot
Virginia, thev have detei mine 1 to lu.-h stiaiht
foiward t he prize with ail their forte. Hut
should hiefs place this view hexond doubt, let us
hpe that the Go eminent is pepared to -ouceu
träte, in deten-e of the Capital, iiuuibeis cqu al to
any army of Yankees likely to reach this neigh
boi hood after the depletion ol the battles and the
march they must first accomplish.
Events indicate the approach of nother cris's
in our affairs. A people wh have pii-scd tlmnigh
a trial to their fortitude and energy u h ns we
have once had to endure, m'ght be excused for
hoping an 1 believing that il e wimld never know
another like it Tho-e who lived in Richmond
last June, ami still lived in July, nruht letsona
bly suppose lb it the bitterness m le dh had p issed
them, never to return Ii those days we had but
to raise our ey es to f-e the b illoons f the enemy
watching us lrtm ihe sky. In sight of our
steeple, onlv four miles from ourlors, an army
of a hundieti und tiny thousand 'neu formcl a
vast hall' moon before ami nroun! t.s No man
knew the day would pass withouut the commence
ment of a bu-iue-s. tint might brietlv end in the
assault, sack ami conflagration of the tiwn
words which we do nit care to lehne and vivify
by analysis, and detail. This lasted for months;
and when we remember' it, we cannot refr.iu
from wonder while recollecting the courage ami
composure, amounting alupist in indifference, w-ith
which the population supported it Few wouhl
believe in delvat, and still fewer were frightened.
That noMe confidence in -'O'l and the anus of
the South was well rewtr.lel. For oneltv
that vast host dissolve like a cloud before tlie
shock of thunder. A bleeding, nitngled mass,
crouching tor safety in the corner of the i i ver.wns
all tint then rem lined F the most splendid mili
tary array of the age Our danger had gone like
hii evil dieam or nightmre. and thoe who
awakened in security might be pardoned for
Itelieviug that it could never return.. It requires
some effort t' brace ihe nerves for a similar and
perhaps a mie terrible ordeal. Let us hope that
those who were once ab'e to confront death wiih
dignity can again look with a steady glance on
the direful phantom with which they then gainel
acquaintance, und have fri 111 the band of iron to
grasp il.e hand of bone.
