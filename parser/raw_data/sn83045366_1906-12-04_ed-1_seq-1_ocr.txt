SCENT DEEP PURPOSE
IN SCHOOL SQUABBLE
San Franciscans Declare Japan's
Peevishness Means
Bitter War.
San Francisco, Dec. 4.California is
rebellious, if not in a state of rebel
lion. Standing on its new problem, or
rather on the new phase of an older
problem, the golden state has raised
the banner of state rights and has de
clared more strongly on the color ques
tion than ever the south declared since
the recent unpleasantness.
California is not afraid of war. It
wants no war with the rest of the
United States, but demands a "friend
ly fight" in the supreme court to de
cide whether or not California shall
have the right to rule iself in local
matters and handle the color question
in its own way.
Neither does California seek a war
with Japan. I fact, Calif ornians
laugh at such an idea, but here on the
strip of land which must stand the
brunt of the battering if ever Japan
and the United States go to war there
is no man who fears Japan.
School Board I Firm.
"The school board of San Francisco
never will change its attitude on the
school question," declared the superin
tendent of schools, as he came from a
board meeting which had been discuss
ing the question.
''President Roosevelt's requests, or
orders, will be ignored by us. The
Japanese must stay in their own school.
We are acting under a state law,
passed in 1872, before there ever was
any idea of this situation. If Presi
dent Roosevelt or the federal congress
has any requests to make they must
make them of the California legisla
ture. The legislature can change the
laws in a moment, but we cannot. If
the legislature of California refuses to
change the law we want and hope for
final decision of the case iu the su
preme court of the United States."
Chesty."
"If California is to remain one of
the United States," declared the com
missioner of labor of California, then
it.must stop this invasion and settle the
question. If we do not settle the Jap
anese question soon our children wfll
settle it, or try to settle it, from the
other side of the Sierras. The Japan
ese are' swarming into California at the
rate of over a thousand a month
more arrogant, more chesty than any
other people. They do not demand
equality. They want an acknowledge
ment of their superiority.
A commissioner of labor I realize v,^.,.
that the problem is an enormous one., hint
I would no mora think of driving out ""o
all the Japs today than I would think
of letting them all come in. Thi
problem must be handled sanely."Cali
fornia^ needs labor, and, at the same
time, it faces the destruction and the
driving out of all the whites. The
whites will not amalgamate with the
Japs. There is the problem."
Feeling Surges High.
The feeling^ in San Francisco is high.
The city and parts of the state are
openly, bitterly and resentfully opposed
to the administration's stand in regard
to the school question in San Francisco.
The ninety-three orientals who have
under the old state law, been placed
by themselves in the oriental school
and segregated from the remainder of
the public school children of this
wrecked city may prove the crui?e of
one of the most serious international
complications ever faced by the United
States and one which may cost her dear
if the views of the Calif ornians are
true.
The people of San Francisco, its edu
cators, its officials, its politicians and
its thinkers declare that Japan is not
at all interested in.the question of the
ninety-three segregated orientals, but
that the Japs are seeking to find a cause
for a quarrel with the United States
and have chosen the San Francisco
school situation as the bone over which
to pick a quarrel and start a war.
I is openly stated that the Ja be
lieves the quicker he strikes at Amer
ica the better and that he is seeking
over a trivial question, which the school
board declares was the result not of
any slight to Japan nor of any insult,
intended or otherwise either to Japan
or China, but as a direct result of the
necessity arising from the earthquake
and fire which destroyed the city, to
start a war to decide quicklv which
nation shall be the master of the Pa
cific.
Resents President's Action.
Not only does California, especially
San Francisco, resent the attitude of
Japan, but even more it resents the
apparent attitude of President Roose
velt's administration. California is
rather a peculiar state. I is so far off
from all the rest of the United States
and has been so independent, so rich, so
big, and has developed so rapidly that
it thinks it is quite big enough now to
decide for itself. I resents imperial
federal interference, even as certain of
the southern states once resented it and
as, later Illinois resented it when fed
eral troops were sent to Chicago.
The attitude of the people is rather
odd. The labor unions are bitterly op
posed to Japanese labor, for strictly
selfish reasons. The rest of the people
are opposed to the Japanese because
they say Japan is getting "too fresh."
In San Francisco it is great fun for
"kids" to "soak a skipper," which
means to throw a brick at a Japanese.
Odd as it may seem, these same Cali
fornians whose fathers, -when they wer,e
small, stoned the Chinese in the streets
now treat the Chinamen with some re
spect, and even regard him as an hon
est, hard-working laborer while they
hate and detest the "skippy."

JUDGE WHO TRIED OR. KOCH
KILLS HIMSELF AT
Worry Over Financial Mat-
ters and Wife's Illness
Prompted His Act.
He Was a Pioneer of New
Ulm and Was Prom-
inent.
Special to The Journal.
New Ulm, Minn.. Dec. 4.-Judge
F. Webber is dead by his own hand.
When the news was flashed about New
Ulm today it could scarcely be believed.
That tha leading jurist in all this sec
tion, honored by the people universally,
always regarded as a strong, well-bal
anced man, mentally and physically,
should take his own life, was almost
unbelievable. When the truth was
brought homf, the sorrow become in
tense and general. Judge Webber was
one of the early pioneers, and his figure
was a familiar one to every man, wo
man and child in New Ulm.
Intimate friends of Judge Webber
have known for some ti me that he was
acting strangely and have noticed his
mental and physical powers fail from
day to day. Last night he left his home
at 8 o'clock and remained away until
midnight. This was contrary to all the
customs of his lifetime. N one saw
him then and no one knows where he
went.
Search Begun.
This morning he arose at 5 o'clock,
a custom which he had followed for
years and started for a walk before
breakfast. When he did not return at
the usual time, his wife, who is an in
valid, had her nurse telephone to Mi
chael Mullin, a banker, who had been
the close friend and business counselor
of Judge Webber for a lifetime.
Mr. Mullin at once recalled that
Judge Webber has remarked to him
only a few days ago that he couldn't
stand the strain, referring to the pro
tracted illness of his wife and to imag
inary troubles concerning money mat
ters.
His Hanging Body Found.
Mr. Mullin jumped to the conclusion
at once that it might be a case for
the police and notified Chief Klause
that the judge was missing.
The first thought of the chief was to
search, the barn on Judge Webber's
premises Nothing below was wrong but
the chief no sooner climbed to the hay
loft above than he saw the. body of the
judge hanging from a rafter.
Judge Webber had taken a strap
from,,a bridle, tied a noose, in one end,
which he. put over his head and fast
ene the. other end_,to a rafter, above,
do'-this he had taken apposition
on a box.which he kicked out from
under wh en all was in readiness.
was completely dressed even to his
overcoat, and his hands were in his
pockets and pressed tightly to his side.
It is supposed that he hanged himself
about 6 o'clock his body was found
shortly after 9 0 'clock.
Long Contemplated.
The chief found two ropes in the
hayloft, each freshly cut and with a
noose, indicating almost beyond a
doubt that Judge Webber had long
planned the step and had perhaps even
attempted suicide before.
His Motive.
The motive for the suicide appears
clear to those who have been on inti
mate personal relations with the judge.
I has been a matter of comment among
them that he had been breaking down
for several months. The fact that his
wife is a confirmed invalid and
could never expect to be restored to
health weighed heavily upon him. A
his powers failed he became unneces
sarily worried over his financial affairs
and had expressed fear to his close
friends that he would not be able to
suppport himself and his wife.
Acquaintances tried to cheer him up
and to convince him that his property
was in good shape and ample for all
his necessities.
Ko ch Trial Strain Too Much.
Judge Webber presided at the first
trial of Dr. George R. Koch, charged
with the murder of L. A. Gebhardt,
and the strain of that long inquiry no
doubt hastened the end that came to
day.
Judge Webber was born at Shap
leigh, Me., and in his youth learned
the .trade of a carpenter while he was
acquiring an education that would en
able him to teach school. In follow
ing the trade he had learned, he spent
several years in Massachusetts, com
ing from that state to Blue Earth coun
ty, Minnesota, in 1868. He taught sev
eral terms of school there and then
began the study of law under the di
rection of H. S. Wilson at Garden City
and Madelia.
A Judge for Twenty-five Years..
After being admitted to practice by
the legislature he located in New Ulni,
and, being a Yankee among Germans,
and the only attorney here, he had a
monopoly of the profession for many
years. practiced law here ten years,
during which he held the office of coun
attorney, for eight years, or until
1882, when he was nominated to the
office of district judge. had been
nudge of the ninth judicial district for
almost a quarter of a century, retiring
by his own volition a few months ago.
Liv ed a Long Life.
Judge Webber was 73 years of age
on Oct. 6, and at that time appeared to
be a well-preserved man

Washington, Dec. 4.President
Roosevelt *s annual message to congress
occupied the attention of the senate as
soon as the opening preliminaries were
concluded today. These included the
receipt of messages from the house re'*
citing deaths of several of its members.
The committee appointed to notify
the president that congress was in ses
sion made its report to Senator Hale of
Maine. The reading of the message
began at 12:11 p.m.
Many senators were in their seat*
and the message received careful atten
tion.
Baron Rosen, the Russian ambassa
dor, accompanied by two members of
his embassy staff, occupied the diplo
matic gallery during the reading of tha
message.
Several New Issues. li
In his message the president recom
mends the strengthening of several laws
already on the statute books, notably
those governing corporations. A fed
eral license law is mentioned as one of
the possible solutions of the problem
and a fit foe for the government own*
ership doctrine.
One of the features of the messagB
that entirely escaped the forecasters i
the president's expressed belief that
rape and assault with intent to com
mit rape should be capital offenses.
Among the other new issues raised are
the recommendation that the entire
question of marriage and divorce be
relegated to congress the inheritance
and income taxes and the suggestion
that a Japanese naturalization law
passed.
