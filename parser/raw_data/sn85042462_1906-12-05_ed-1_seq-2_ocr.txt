By Associated Press.
': lIKRKIMKH. N. T., Dec. The
Jury In th.- trial of Chester. K. Gillette
for the murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Brown; at. Big Moose lake, on July 11,
tonight returned a verdict of guilty in
the first degree. ■■
Sentence will. be pronounced Thurs
day morning, to which time adjourn
ment whs taken after the jury had re-
port mi.
When Marshal Heath, the foreman,
declared that a verdict of guilty In the
first flejrrr- 0 liail been found the pris
oner gave no sign of emotion. He was
taken back to his cell.
One juror held "tit for acquittal until
thr sixth ballot.
Ollletto sat motionless In his chair
as the Jury was polled and when the
twelfth man had responded the stolid
indifference or studied composure of
the boy was exhibited as never before.
Leaning over a nearby table he drew
toward him a hit of white paper and
taking a pencil from his pocket wrote
this message:
"Father: I am convicted. — Chester."
This was one of the earliest dis
patches carrying thp news of Gillette's
doom beyond the walls of the court
house. It went to his father in Denver.
Prosecutor Grills Defendant
Pistrirt Attorney Ward early today
resumed his summing up of the case
Against Chester E. Gillette, charged
with the murder of Grace Brown. He
described Gillette's life in Cortland as
outwardly correct, but actually lust
ful, as shown by the wrong he admit
ted he had done Grace Brown.
"Gillette." Ward said, "wanted to stay
In Cortland society. He never intend
ed, never for a moment, to take Grace
Brown anywhere except to her death.
He concocted a plan to rid himself of
her. The girl received her death blow,
I am sure, with a grateful heart out
there in the woods."
Mr. Ward described Gillette as an
unmitigated coward.
"The cool, clever, courageous scoun
drel," the prosecutor declared, "said
upon the stand thnt he asked Grace
Brown to go with him on Decoration
day. A man can be drilled into a long
Btory to cover guilt, but the lie will
come out."
Calls Him a Rat
The prosecutor's address was intense
with feeling. As he read the letters
of Grace Brown and pointed out the
sentiments that she expressed, saying
that the writer was a girl of pure
thoughts and in the same breath re
ferred to the defendant as a rat, Gillette
broke Into tears and It was some time
before he was able to regain his com
posure.
The district attorney concluded his
address at 4:15 this afternoon, when
Judge Devendorff began his charge to
the Jury. Judge Devendorff completed
hia charge and the Jury filed into its
room at 5:50 p. m.

By Associated Press
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.—Represen

duced a bill which provides that "on or
before June 30. 1907, all enlisted men
of tho army who are negroes or of
negro descent shall be discharged from
the service of the United states and
thereafter no negro or person of negro
descent shall be enlisted or appointed
In the army of the United States."
In explaining his bill Mr. Sfeyden
said:
"The bill speaks for itself. It was
not introduced for buncombe. My pur
pose is to give the congress of the
United States an opportunity to purge
the army of an admittedly dangerous
element.
"To say that the negrop.s are brave
in not an argument against this mean
lire Many rn«n liavf been bravo, in
fart mom men are in fighting. The
Comanohfi «nd Kloux Indians were
as brave men as can be. No <>ny
would suggest that we ultimately re
cruit regiments from them, put gunw
in their hands and station them near
companies of white troops toward
