In the late meeting of 8ynod. the cause of
Domestic Missions received considerable attention.
Rev. Jno. L. Girardeau presented the
Annual Report, giving a summary of what each
Presbytery is doing. From this it was apparent,
that nearly six thousand dollars had been
contributed for Domestic Missions, by the
churches of Synod. The scheme of employing
Evangelists is now in operation in two Presbyteries;
and the other two only I?ck the men to
adopt the same.
* Foreign Missions likewise engaged the attention
of Synod. The sermon was preached by
Rev. S. L. Watson ; and the Rev. D. E. Frier
son is to succeed him next year. The annua!
contribution to this cause is usually more than
six thousand dollars from tho churches of Synod.
It was resolved "That it be recommended
to all the ministers of this Synod, to present in
all their churches, on the 23rd of December, thf
subject of the Reformation, as to its causes,
" " J~- ?K?,o In mmnwra.
doctrines and enects, in uruo
orate the Ter-centenary of the first meeting ol
the General Assembly of the Church of Scot
land, the precious germ from which almost all
the Presbyterian churches of England, Ireland
and America have sprung."
Besides preaching iu the Glebe St. church
every night, and three times on the Sabbath j
there were preached thirty-one Presbyteriat
sermons in the city on the Sabbath?all the pul
pita except the Episcopal, Unitarian, Jewish
and Catholic, having been filled by ministers ol
Synod by request of their pastors. The various
Christian denominations have all large churches
in the city, and the most of them are devoting
special attention to the blacks; but in this en
terprise the Presbyterians, Baptists and Metho
dists are leading the way. Not having definit<
information of what the last two are doing, w<
are free to say that Presbyterianism has a no
ble representative, among churches chiefly de
signed for blacks, in the Mt. Zion Church, o
which Rev. Jno. L. Girardeau is pastor. It ha
a membership of four hundred blackt, and abou
seventy whites.

SKETCH OF DR. THORNWELL'S SERMON.
Afrttrs. Editors : It wax with feelings of no ordinary enit
tion tliat I, witb many others, listened to the eloquent an
forcible discourse of lir. Thornwell, in tlie First Presbyter!
* an Church at Columbia, on last Wednesday?the day a{
pointed by our Governor, as a day of humiliation and pray
e r. Had I at once sat down and sketched it off, I could ha v
given you verbatim, many eloquent passages, but I heard s
many express their desire for publication, that I hastil
concluded we would have the opportunity, not only of set
ing it, but of distributing it among our friends. The num
ber of copies to be published being so limited, I though
that a sketch, though necessarily meagre anil imperfeei
might be interesting to your many readers. If I could giv
the political argument, it would be a lesson for statesmen
if I could give the application, it would be a lesson for u
all, containing as it aid, reproof, correction, and inxtructio
in righteousness. With the hope that this sketch may in
duce many to obtain the publication. 1 present it thruug
the columns of your widely-read paper.
After impressive prayer, and the singing of the 21st an
59th Psalms, in the torrner of which occurred the verse?
"In deep distress, a patriot band,
Implored thy power to save;
For liberty they prayed; thy hand
The timid blessing gave"?
thrilling me with its prophetic power. He took for his text
Isaiah xxxvii, the 1st and 6th verses inclusive, but mor
particularly dwelling on the first verse: "And it came t
pass when king Hezekiali heard it, that he rent his clothe
and covered himself with sack-cloth, and went into tli
bouse ot tne intra. Hc
said, during the twenty-five years he had been in tti
ministry, all of which time he had spent in South Carotins
and nearly all of Uiat time in the city of Columbia, he ha
never alluded to politics from the puipit. As a man ami si
a citizen, ho had ever his own opinions upon all politics
questions; as a minister of the gospel, he preached Chrii
crucified; and endeavored to turn the sinner from the bor
dage of sin, to the liberty of the Saviour. He confesset
therefore, the embarrassment under which he labored, as
was necessary to bring in his political opinions, in order th
more fully to" illustrate what he was about to advanee.Still,
he wished his hearers to accept what he said in refei
ence to secular affairs, only as opinions which his coti
science gave him a right to maintain, and yet as making n
law for another's rule of action.
? And first he would enquire, why are we met together
To humiliate ourselves before God. We have sinned, an
we feel in view of coming distress, God's judgment for sit
Without drawing an analogy between this people and th
children of Israel, yet for the' sake of illustration, be woul
say, we, the commonwealth of South Carolina, bad this da
prostrated ourselves before God, clothed ill sack-cloth an
ashes, confessing sin and entering into the house of th
Lord. This very act of appointing a day of thaiiksgivin
and prayer, was an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty
We catne now in a three-fold capacity. First, as one of
body of States; second, as a sovereign State; and third, n
individuals. And now, in a true spirit of humiliation, it
us confess our sins. That there was sin somewhere wa
evident, and evident from the fact that this mighty fabric
raised by our forefathers, sustained for so many years b
ourselves, was now tottering to its ruin, it was not for hit
to say where the sin originated or where it now luy?tvlo
ther in our Federal Government, or in our own State; bt;
if he came to this in a spirit of impartial investigation, h
had no doubt we would not find our own skirts clear. H
then referred to the state of our country at tile close of til
Revolution. Each State an independent government, com
pcteut to perform any act which appertained to any nation

was constituted by the joint action of these individual StateThey
transmitted' to it certain rights and powers, which ha
previously been vested in themselves. It was the law-nui
ker for the States; and as our fathers saw much inconven
iertce arising from the submitting of the several laws to tli
action of each State for approval or otherwise, they deu-rni
ined to make the law, send them forth as laws, rnd allot
the objections afterward. In such a government, the dut
of those representing the people is, not to give expression t
tlie will of the people, but to what ought to be their willto
what is in itself right. One great principle lay at the vt
rv basis of our government thus formed?that of good fail!
Our Constitution was a covenant of fidelity; the breakiu
of the very least of the articles was an act of treason in th
sight of God. and the traitor vile as Judas, who betrayed hi
Haviour with a kiss. And how had that covenant been bre
ken?been violated on the part of some of the States? Ha
our representatives been faithful to their trust ? He spok
of disgraceful scenes occurring in Congress, and the trad
and barter in the halls of legislation ; of the acisofdehnuelii'
rv of those filling prominent places of public trust. Kroi
the Legislature, he exposed the Judieiary. and in witheriu
rebuke he told how justice had fled from their Courts. X*
was our own South Carolina witiiout blame, for faults ha
been committed on our own soil, sutlicient to call down th
vengeance of Almighty God. Our ballot-box, our halls i
legislation and justice, were impregnated with this taiiit.We
were not guiltless, and now, ere this government was i

be the derision and scorn of tyrants and despots. The ein
miesoffree institutions in Europe would laugh at itsdi.-ru|
tlou, and point to us as an evidence of the fallacy of 01
doctrines.
Then speaking of our peculiiar nstitution, an institutio
sanctioned by the Cramers of our Constitution?sustained b

was put into our hands for high moral purposes; it was
trust for which we were resi?otisible, ami which we wo
bound to protect, lie then solemnly asked, had we bee
faithful to that trust; and again bade each one to eotnc cot
fessing, aud ask aid for the future.
Our people, eminently a self-reliant people, had been vai
and boastful. From trusting too much to our own strengtl
wc had forgotten, to a great extent, faith in God. This wti
a sin, and a sin of no eommon magnitude. Valn-glorlou:
arrogant, and profane to such an extent that he could n<
bettpr illustrate it, than by giving the distinction of tli
Frenchman, who, on being asked how he distinguished a
American from au Englishman, replied by repeating u con
mon form of expression used by our people, but which li
would not desecrate that holy place by using, it was to
true that profanity was one of the crying sins ol our lam
and truly God would judge it. After exhorting Ills hearei
to calmness and moderation in action, lie impressed upo
them the noble principle of not yielding to cowardice, nc
accepting a course of policy. Let truth and justice be 01
basis; fairness and honesty our rule of action; and il tli
blessing of tlie Almighty did not attend us in the way w
might look for it, yet we should certainly receive it. Thei

Word?a lesson for past time, it will live to future ages, i
glorious 'iiing it is to die lor one's country ; a glorious thin
to die a martyr to truth and justice?but still more gloriou
to live a monument against oppression?a living inouumen

they can do nothing hi such times. Though not permittei

r LATEST NEWS;
Telegraphed to the Charleston Mercury.
Latent from Waihlngton.
Washimotos, December 3.?Matters here are beginning
i to wear a gloomy aspect. The Congressional delegations of
i the Gulf States, are unanimous for secession. This greatly
, surprises the abolitionists, who expected to find South Carolina
alone. The abolitionists have decided to let matters
take their course.
The secession of a number of the Southern delegations
is arranged to bake place within twenty days, at the farthest.
The Breckenridge and Lane Club of this city disbanded
to-night, with a declaration by its President, that the Union
is at an end.
President Buchanan, in the Message, takes very strong
I ground against secession, as a constitutional right. This por*
tion of the Message will be fiercely assailed to-morrow, immediately
afler its reading, and that, too, by the very men
who have hitherto been the President's warmest friends.
The President's Message.
Wo learn that the following are the prominent features of
the President's Message: He will present in strong terms
the encroachments of the North upon the constitutional
. rights of the South, and strongly urges a Federal Convention
to correct these.
He takes ground against the constitutional right ofa State
to secede, and argues this at length. He asserts that he has
I no (tower to use coercion, and does not think that Congress
has any right to invest the Executive with such power. He
shall, however, turn the question over to Congress. I'ntil
it is decided, he will continue to enforce the Federal laws,
1 and to defend the property now held by the Govennent.?
; But he confesses that he has no righr to collect revenues
, through nieaus of revenue cutters.? Carolinian, 5/A inst.
