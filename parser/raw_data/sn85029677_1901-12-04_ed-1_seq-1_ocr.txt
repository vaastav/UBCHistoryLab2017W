The following 13 a comprehensive sum
mary of President Roosevelt's message to
congress:
The president begins his first annual
communicatltta with an official announce
ment of - the death of the late President
McKrnley, and a eulogy of his former
chief in which he says:
"It is not too much to say that at the
nine or fresiuent Mckinley s aeatn ns
was the-, most widely-loved man In all the
United States, while wo have never had
any public man of his position who has
been so- wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities Incident to public life. His po
f litical opponents were the first to bear
the heartiest and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which bo endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity
In public life he united the tender affec,
tions and home virtues which are all
Important in the makeup of national
. character. A. gallant soldier in the great
. 1 war- lor tne union, he also shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct in the most sacred and Intimate
of home relations. There' could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act
ed with aught but consideration for the
. welfare of others. No one could fail to
respect him who knew him In public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality by asserting that it is. exer
cised for political ends inveigh against
wealth and irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
"The shock! the grief-of the country, are
bitter in the minds of all who saw the
dark days w.hile the president yet hovered
between life and death. At last the light
breath went from the lips that even in
mortal asronv uttered no words save of
forgiveness - to his murderer, of love for
his friends and of unfaltering trust in the
will of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with infinite sorrow, but with such
pride in what he had accomplished and in
his own personal character that we feel
the blow hot as struck at him, but as
etruck at tho nation. We mourn a good
and great president who is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of his life and the
grand heroism with .which he met his
riMCh -
In the same connection he makes
strong recommendations as to how the
'nation should deal with anarch'. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to' enact legislation that will
frevent anarchists from foreign countries
anding upon our shores. He would also
have the federal courts given jurisdiction
over; any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president, of, the country, or any
person who l$-in line" f or';.sccession ..-to-the
presidency. He has no' fear, however,
that the country will ever fall into an
archy. "The federal courts should be given jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who by the constitution or by law is in
line of succession for. the presidency,
while the punishment for an' tinsuceessf u!
attempt should be proportioned to the
enormity of the offense against our in
stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should band
against the anarchist. His crime, should
be made an offense against the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade, for it
is of far blacker infamy than either. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties would
give to the federal government the-power
of dealing with the crime."
The Trnnts.
The president see3 cause for congratu
lation lor the nation in the business. condi
tions of the present, but sees in the "tre
mendous and highly complex industrial
development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half
of the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the present and future. He
does not believe that the old laws and old
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. . He does not attribute
;the creation of great corporate "fortunes
to. the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any otner governmental action, but to
natural causes In the business world, op
erating in other countries as they operate
in our own." In this connection he says:
'The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which is wholly
without warrant. It . is not true that as
the rich have grown richer the poor have
crown poorer. On the cpntrory, never be
fqre has the average man," the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
. been, so well off as in this country and
at the present time. There hav; been
abuses connected with the accumulation
of wealth, yet it remains true "that a for
tune accumulated in legitimate business
r ii 1 . -mumicu uj me person spe
cially benefited only on condition of con
ferring immense incidental benefits upon
others. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can oniy ex
ist if the conditions are such as to offer
Beat prizes as the rewards of success "
But while he realizes existing condi
tions; he emphasizes the fact that congress
In providing remedies must act with cau
tion, as the men and corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
railroads across-the, continent have done
great good to . our .people, and :wlfhout
them the material development of which
we are so justly proud could never have
juare. moreover, we should recog
nize the immense importance to this ma
terial development of leaving as unham
pered as. is compatible with the public
good the strong and forceful men upon
whom the success of business operations
inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions'; will satisfy anyone
capable of forming a judgment that the
personal equation is the most important
factor in a business operation: that the
business ability, of the man at the head of
any business concern; bier or little, is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking success and hopeless failure."
f Another reason for caution in trust legis
lation which he gives "is to be found in the
international commercial conditions of to
day. The same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregations of
fcorporate and individual wealth have
made them very potent factors in inter
national -commercial competition. Busi
ness concerns which have the largest
tneans at their disposal and are managed
by the ablest men- are naturally those
ivhich take the lead in the strife for com
mercial supremacy among the nations of
the world. America has only just begun
to assume that commanding position Jn
the international business world which
we believe will more and more be hers. It
is of the-utftvost importance that this por
iBltlon be not jeoparded, especially at a time
;when the -overflowing, abundance of our
own natural resources. and 'the skill, busi

inevitably enda-ngeta ' the interests of all.
The fundamental rule In our national life,
the rule which underlies all others, is that
on the whole and in the long run we shall
go up or down together. There are excep
tions, and in times of prosperity.&omejwill
prosper far more and in times of adversi
ty some will suffer far more than others;
but,- speaking generally, a period of good
limes means that all share more or jess
.Lin them, and in a period of hard times all
feel the stress to a greater or less degree
He points to the fact that in the past
"the ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective f rlemi of the
evils which he has been nominally" oppos
ing. In dealing with business interests
for, the government to undertake by
crude and "ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional .(disaster that it would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the impossible or the
undesirable serve. as the allies of the
forces with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find out in rational fashion
what the wrong3 really are and to what
extent and in what manner it is prac
ticable to apply'remedies."
Remedies tor the Trnai ETll.
But while he says the above is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should,
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
chief is over capitalization, "because of
its many baleful consequences."' He says:
"The conviction of the American people
that the great corporations, known as
trusts, are in certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
is based upon sincere conviction that com-,
binatlon and concentration should" be not
prohibited, but-! supervised and within
reasonable limits" controlled, and in my
judgment this cdnvietion is right."
As a remedy for these evils he says:
"The first essential in determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations . is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the public
the government should have the right to
inspect and Examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in' inter
state business. Publicity is the only sure
remedy which we can now invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
of governmental regulation or taxation
can onlv be determined nftor rnhliitv
has -been obtained by. process of law and
in ine course or administration. The first
requisite is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made- public
to the world.
"Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate information as to their
operations should be made public regu
larly ;at reasonable, intervals.-"
"The- large corporations; jfiommojily
called trusts, thoueh organized in Yn
state, always do-business in many states
often doing very little business in the
state where they are incorporated. There
is utter lack -of uniformity in the state
laws about them, and as no state has
any exclusive interest in or power over
their act3 it has in practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therpfnw in th
interest of the whole people the nation
should, without interfering with the pow
er of the states in the matter itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doiner nn inter.
state business. This is esDe'oiallv true
where the corporation derives a nnrt-nn
of its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency In its
business. There would be no hardship in
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it, and in their case it is nnw arronto,!
as a simple matter of course. Indeed it
is prooaole that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts in
order to produce excellent results "
The president believes that it will be
possible to secure the needed remedies
for the trust evil under th! constitution
as it now exists, btit if congress thinks
otherwise he recommends th,at a constitu
tional amendment be subm ttetl tnat wi'l
co fer the povt? necessary.

Would Exclude tlie Chinese. ,
The mesjsaee 'miains a strong 'recom
mendation for tie reenactment at
of the present Chinese exclusion act in
which connection he says: . .
"Wages are higher to-day in the' United
States than ever before in our 'history
and far higher than in any -other coun
try. The standard of living is pso higher
than ever before. Every effort of ,ia
lator and administrator should be bent to
secure the permanency of this condition
of things and its improvement wherever
possible. Not ofily must our labor b
protected by the tariff, but it should a'so
be protected so far as it is possible from
the presence in this country of any la
borers brought over by contract or of
those who. coming freely, yet reprent
a standard of living so depressed that
they can undersell our men in the labor
market and drag them to a lower level
I regard, it as necessary, with this end
in view, to reenact immediately the law
excluding .. Chinese -laborers 'and to
strengthen it wherever necessary in or
der to make its enforcement entirely cf-
He also recommends such legislation, by
an amendment to the interstate commerce
law, as Will protect the labor- of one state
from competing with the prison labor of
another state, and also that the govern
ment cease being a party to this competi
tion by not purchasing goods made either
by convict labor or that in which women
and 'children- are: caused -to. work excessive
hours or at nirht. : .- - ,
In the labor unions of tiupresen'f he sees
much that is. gcod. in jvjbtek connection he
"Very great good has 'been and will be
accomplished by associations or unions
of wajrewqrkers when managed with
forethought "and when'- they -.ccmbino in
sistence upon their own rights with law
abiding respect .for the rights of others
The 'display? hf -th)?sl? qualities ia such
bodies is. a duty to the nation no - less
than to the associations thomselve' '
Finally there must also in many cases be
action by the government in order to
safeguard the rights anil interests of all
Under our constitution there is much
more scope for such action by the state
and the municipality than by the nation.
But on points such as those touched on
above the national government can act,
"When all is srtid and done, ihe rule of
brotherhood remains as the iiulispen&abe
prerequisite to success In -the.-kintl of ra
tional life for which w strive.' Each
man must work for hlmsif. -and unless
he so works no outside help " can avail
him.'. But each man must remember also
that.' he is indeed - his brother's 'keeper
and that while no' man whocfuses to

that each
times needs to have the heloinghand put
stretched to him. To be permanently ef
fective aid must always tike the form of
helping" a man to help himself, and we
can all best help ourselves by joining to
gether in the work that is of common in
terestHo all."
The Immigration Lam,
He pronounces our present immigration
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
hts says "we need every honest and ef
ficient immigrant fitted to become an
American citizen, every immigrant who
comes here to stay, wno brings h?re ,
strong bodyt a good head and a resolute
purpose to tic his duty well in every way
and to bring up nis children as law-abiding,
God-fearing members of the community."
But he says:
"Thero should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of working a
threefold improvement over qur present
system. First, we should aim to exclude
absolutely not only all persons who are
known to be believers in anarchistic prin
ciples or members of anarchistic socie
ties, but also all persons who are of a
low moral tendency or of unsavory repu
tation. This means that we should re
quire a more thorough system of inspec
tion abroad and a more rig'd system of
exam.n-ition at our immigrjtlon ports,
the former being especially necessary.
"The second object of a proper immi
gration law ought to be to secure by a
careful and not merely perfunctory edu
cational test some intelligent capacity to
appreciate American institutions and act
sanely as American citizens. This would
not keep out ail anarchists, for many of
them belong to the intelligent criminal
class, but it would do what is also in point
that is, tend to decrease the sum of ig
norance so potent in producing the envy,
suspicion, malignant passion and hatred
of order out of which anarchistic senti
ment Inevitably springs. Finally-all per
sona ci.uuju i-e exciucea wno are Delow
a certair standard of economic fitness to
enter our industrial field as competitors
with American labor. There should be
proper proof of personal capacity to earn
an American living and enough money to
Insure a ciecent start under American con
ditions. This would step the influx of cheap
labor and the resulting competition which
gives rise to so much of bitterness in
American industrial life, and it would dry
up the springs of the" pestilential social
conditions in our great cities where an
archistic organization" have their great
est possibility of growth."
The Tariff.
The president does not desire any change
in the present tariff schedule except where
such may be made in reciprocity treaties
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Every application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties mpst never be reduced below the
point thafwill cover the difference between
the -labbr "cost here and abroad. The well
being of the wageworker is a prime consid
eration of our entire policy of economic
legislation.
"Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth cf our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in the way cf trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
in the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those surplus products by giving us
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to cur own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basi3, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach of successful
competition.
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
I- marine discreditable to us as a nation ana
Ifffcigiiificant tp that of other nations wnicn
we overtop in other forms of business,"
and says we "shoulC not longer soibmlt to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce is carried in
cur own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to buiid up our shipping in
terests, but it wouii! Silso result in benefit
to all who are interested in tne perma
nent establishment of 'i wider market for
American products ar-.d Would provide an
auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work
for their ivn countries -just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
lines, if f stabiishe.l to the principal coun
tries with which we have tieri lings, would
be of political as well as commercial ben
efit. From every standpoint it is unwise
for the United State? to continue to rely
upon th? ships of competing nations for the
distribution of on; goods. It should be
maiii ad vuntagenus" to carry American
goods in American built ships."
His recommendation on this subject is
only that "our government should take
such action as will remedy these inequali
ties. Thi. American merchant marine
should be restored to the ocean."
Finances.
Under this heading the president recom
mends such legislation as will better safe
guard against the .:iorai:ging Influences of
commercial eri:;cs and financial panics and
such as .-will make the- currency of the
country (moi"o responsive to the demands
of domesiie trace. and commerce.
Ho pcijUs out the iact that the receipts
from dunes on imports aid internal taxes
exct'td the expt nc:tui.-s of the govern
ment, but counsels against reducing the
rtviT-ues so that there wli! b; the possi
bility cf a deficit.
"But after providing against any such
contingency T.efins should be adopted
which wiil brirg ths revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs."
He urges the necessity for strict economy
in expenditures, but that "our national
needs, fofbid us to be niggardly in the mat
ter of- providing whatever Is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
1 Inter-Sf ate Commerce.
He. points to defects in the interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct themin which connection
he says:
"Those who complain of the management
of the railways allege that established
rates arc - net maintained, that re
bates and similar devices are habitually
resorted to, that these preferences are
usually in favor of the large shipper, that
they drive cut of business the smaller
competitor, that while many rates are too
low many others are excessive and that
gross preferences are made affecting both
localities" and commodities. Upon the oth
er hand, the railways assert that the law
by its very terms tends to produce many
of these illegal practices by depriving car
riers -of that right of concerted action
which they claim is necessary to estab
lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates.
"The act should be amended. The rail
way is a public servant.- Its rates should
be just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should see to it that
within it3 jurisdiction this 13 so and
should nrovide a-speedy, inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time it must not be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries through which
the commercial lifeblocd of this nation
flows." ;. Kothing could be more foolish than
the enactment cf- legislation which would
unnecessarily interfere with the develop
ment aud operation of these commercial
agencies." ,
Agricultural Interests.
The president cites the forest legislation
of the past and the great good of forest
preserves to the people, and says they wiil
inevitably be of still greater value. Con
tinuing, he says:
"At present the protection of the forest
reserves rest3 with the general land office,
the mapping and description of their tim
ber with the United States geological sur
vey and the preparation of plans for their
conservative use with the bureau of for
estry, which is also charged with the gen
eral advancement of practical forestry in
the United States. - These various func
tions should be united in the bureau of
forestry-, to which they properly belorg.
The present diffusion of responsibility is
bad from every standpoint. It prevents
that effective cooperation between the
government and tho men who utilize- the
resources of the resr-rves. without which
the Interests of both must suffer. The
scientific bureaus generally should be put
under the department of agriculture. The
president should have by law the power
of transferring lands for use as forest re
serves to the department of agriculture.
He already has such'power in the case of
lands' needed by the departments of war
and the navy."
Irrigation.
Irrigation in connection with the waste
lands of the west is a question to which
the president gives considerable attention,
and makes strong recommendations for
government assistance in reclaiming the.
waste lands by assisting in their irriga
tion and the control of water rights wher
ever that is possible, and of this ne says:
"In the arid region it is water, not land,
which measures production. The western
half of the United States would sustain a
population greater than that of our whole
country to-aay if the waters that now run
to waste were saved and used for irriga
tion. The forest and water problems are
perhaps the most vital internal questions
of the United States.
"In cases where natural conditions have
been restored for a few years vegetation
has again carpeted the ground, birds and
der are coming back, and hundreds of
persons, especially from the immediate
neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy
the privilege of camping. Some at least
of the forest reserves should afford per
petual protection to the native fauna and
flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
kinds and free camping grounds for the
ever-increasing numbers of men and wom
en who have learned to find rest, health
and recreation in the splendid forests and
flower-clad' meadows of our mountains.
The forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our peo
ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted' greed of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save the flood waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished By the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
interstate problems are involved, and the
resources of single states would often be
inadequate. It is properly a national
function, at least in some of its features.
It is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The
storing of the floods in reservoirs at the
headwaters of our rivers is but an en
largement of our present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
1 "The Eovernment should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other
public works. Where their purpose is to
regulate the flow of streams the water
should be turned freely into the channels
in the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion of
our country, just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
perity to the Atlantic states. The in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia wiil consume the larger food sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chiefly in upbuilding local cen
ters of mining and other industries which
would otherwise not come into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaking is but another
name for the upbuilding of the nation."
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises, that we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. He also
cites the conditions1 under which the set
tlers of the west are attempting to buiid
homes on these arid lands, and says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered in ordinary suits at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
the arid states have failed to provide for
the certain and just division of streams in
times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws
have made it possible to establish rights
to water in excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream practically
controls the land it renders productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water
apart from land cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such ownership, which has been per
mitted to grow up In the arid regions
should give way to a more enlightened and
larger recognition or trie rignts or the pub
lie in the control and disposal of the nub
lie water supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions ootaining in numicr regions',
where water is too abundant to lustifv
hoarding it. have no proper application in
a cry country.
"In the arid states the only right to water
which should be recognized is that of use.
In irrigation this right Ehould attach to
the land reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom. Ciranting perpetual water
rights to other than users without
compensation to the public is open to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetuai irancnases to tne puDiic utili
ties of the cities. A few cf the western
states have already recognized this and
have incorporated in their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
or water.
The Colonies.
Considerable attention is given the col
onies, ana especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins bv citiner
the needs of Hawaii and Pcrto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
tne territory on tne traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of larare
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till the farms they own
All our legislation for the islands should
be shaped with this end in view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
afford the true test of the healthy devel
opment of the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled
on our homestead system."
Of Porto Rico he says the island is thriv
ing: a3 never before, and is being adminis
tered efficiently and honestly. He deems
no legislation necessary except that con
cerning tne puDiic lanas or me lsiana.
He calls attention to the fact that in
Cuba the independent government of the
island' will soon be in control, and in the
same connection urges strongly tne need
of reciprocal trade relations with the new
nation, upon which subject he says:
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application ana 1 most earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction in the tariff duties on
Cuban imports into the United States.
Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand in inter
national matters fn closer and more friend
ly relations with, us than with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures in the interest of
her material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends muf h
in the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste. He says: "We hope
to make our administration of the islands
honorable to our nation by making It of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves,
and as an earnest cf what we intend to do
we point to what we have done.
AlrceCy a greater measure of material
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained in the
Philippines than ever before in their his
tory." He says we do not desire to do for the
islanders "merely what has elsewhere been
dene for tropic peoples by even the best
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
any people of the tropics to make them'
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the idea of the president is that we
cannot leave the islands at this time, of
which he says: "To leave the islands at
this time would mean that they would
fall Into a welter of murderous anarchy.
Such a desertion of duty on cur part
would be a crime against humanity."
But he believes sufficient progress has
been made along the lines under which we
have been working in the islands: to war
rant us in passing new legislation, but in
this connection he urges the need of cau
tion. He believes the time has come when
the industries of which the islands are
capable should be encouraged by granting
franchises- for their development, and of
this he saj-s:
"Nothing better can be done for the Is
lands than to lntrcclu.ee Industrial enter- i
prises. Nothing1 would benefit them ea
much as throwing them open to industrial
development. 'ine connection between
id'ieness and mischief is proverbial, and the
opportunity to do remunerative work is
one of the surest preventives of war. Of
course no business man will go into the
Philippines unless it is to his interest to
do so, and it is immensely to the interest
of the islands that he should go in. It is
therefore necessary that the congress
shouid pass laws by which the resources
of the islands can be developed, so that
franchises (for limited terms of years) can
be granted to companies- doing business in
them and every encouragement be given
to the incoming of business men of every
kind.
"Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to
the Philippines. The franchises must be
granted and the business permitted only
und'er regulations which wiil guarantee the
islands against any kind of improper ex
ploitation. But the vast natural wealth
of the islands must be developed, and the
capital willing to develop It must be given
the opportunity. The field must be thrown
open to individual enterprise, which has
been the real factor in the development of
every region over which our flag has flown.
It is urgently necessary to enact suitable
laws dealing with general transportation,
mining.-banking, currency, homesteads and
the use and ownership of the lands and
timber. These laws will give free play to
industrial enterprise, and' the commercial
development which will surely follow will
afford to the people of the islands the
best proofs of the sincerity of our desire
to aid them."
The construction of a Pacific cable is
also urged, either that the government
lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippines, or that an arrangement
be made by which the advantages ac
cruing from a government cable may be
secured to the government by contract
with a "private cable company. This he
deems necessary for both commercial,
political and military considerations.
The Isthmian Canal.
He calls attention to the need of an
isthmian canal, and says:
"Its importance to the nation is by no
means limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity, and
yet with a view to these effects alone it
would be to the last degree important
for us immediately to begin it. While its
beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, it would
also greatly benefit other sections. It is
emphatically a work which it is for the
interest of the entire country to beg;n
and complete as soon as possible; it is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with pros
pects of success and which when done
are not only permanent assets in the na
tion's material interests, but standing
monuments to Its constructive ability."
Of the new treaty recently concluded
w-ith England he says:' "I am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great Britain,
conducted on both sides in a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted in my being able to
lay before the senate a treaty which if
ratified' will enable us to begin preparations
for an isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked in connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United States
alone, shall do the work of building and
assume the responsibility of safeguarding
the canal and shall regulate its neutral use
by all nations on terms1 of equality
without the fruarantee or interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. Tho signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and if ap
proved the c-ongress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages it secures
us by providing for the building cf the
canal."
The Monroe Doctrine.
- The pre"sTdent .sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in
which it has been received by other
countries, and in connection with it says
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
any of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith.. He says also that "this
doctrine has nothing to do with the com
mercial relations of any American power
save that it in truth allows each of them
to form such as it desires." That "we
do not ask for any exclusive commercial
treaty with any other American state."
He says of this:
"The Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy of
all the nations of tho two Americas as
it is of the United States. Just 7S years
have passed since President Monroe in
his annual message announced that 'the
American continents are henceforth not
to be considered as subjects for future
colonization by any European power.' In
other words, the Monroe doctrine is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-American
power at the expense of any Ameri
can power cn American soil. It is in no
wise intended as hostile to any nation in
the old world. Still less Is it intended to
give cover to any aggression by one new
world power at the expense of any -other.
It is simply a step, and a long step, to
ward assuring the universal peace of the
world by securing the possibility of per
manent peace on this hemisphere."
The Navy.
The president urges the continued up
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our international duties as well as
a protection and safeguard for our inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a first-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy in
keeping with our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being' in any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly
trained navy is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such a navy represents the very
lightest premium for insuring peace which
this nation can possibly pay."
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men as absolutely necessary,
and says:
"There should be no cessation in the
work of completing our navy. So far in
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise
not to provide this year for several addi
tional battleships and heavy armored
cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft
in proportion. For the exact number and
character I refer you to the report of the
secretary of the navy. But there is some
thing ve need even more than additional
ships, and this is additional officers and
men. To provide battleships and cruis
ers and then lay them up, with the ex
pectation of leaving them unmanned un
til they are needed in actual war, would
be worse than folly. It would be a crime
against the nation.
"To send any warship against a compe
tent enemy unless those aboard it have
been trained by years of actual sea serv
ice, including incessant gunnery prac
tice, would be to invite not merely dis
aster, but the bitterest shame and humil
iation. Four thousand additional sea
men and a thousand additional marines
shoul'l be provided, and an increase in
the officers should be provided by making
a large addition to the classes at Annap
olis. There is one small matter which
should be mentioned in connection with
Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean
ing title of 'naval cadet' should bo abol
ished: the title of "midshipman, full of
historic association, should be restored.
"We now have 17 battleships appropri
ated for, of which nine are completed
and have been commissioned for actual
service. Tho remaining eight wiil be
ready in from two to four years, but it
will take at least that time to recruit and
train the men to fight them. It is of vast
concern that we have trained crews ready
lor tne vessels try ine time tney are com
missioned. Good ships and good guns are
simply good weapons. and the best
weapons are useless save in the hands of
men who know how to fight with them.
The men must be trained and anlled un
der a thorough and well-planned system
of progressive instruction, while the re
cruiting must be carried on with still
greater vigor. Every effort must be made
to exact the main function of the officer
the command of men. The leading grad
uates of the naval academy should be as
signed to the combatant branches, the
line and marines." .
The Army.
No increase in the regular army Is
emei necessary at this time, but there
are several changes In that bVanch of the
government service which the president
commends to congress. Chief or these
Is the establishment of a staff department,
and of this hesavs:
"A general staff should be created. As
for the general staff ard supply depart'
merits, they should be filled by cetaiia
from the line, the men so entailed return
ing after awhiie to their line duties. It is
very undesirable to have the senior grades
of the army composed of men who have
come to fill the positions by the mere fact
of seniority. A system should be adopted
by which there shail be an elimination
grade by grade of those who seem unlit
to render the best service in the next
grade. Justice to the veterans of tha
civil war who are still in the army would
seem to require that in the matter of re
tirements they be given Dy law tne same
privileges accorded to- their comrades In
the navy."
Another recommendation which the pres
ident makes in connection with the army
is for the reduction of the "Daner work '
of the service, known to the public as "red
tape." Of this he says:
"Every effort should be made to bring-
the army to a constantly Increasing state
of efficiency. When on actual service, no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. The paper
work in the army, as in the navy, should
be greatly reduced. What is needed is
proved power of command and capacity
to work well In the field. Constant care
is necessary to prevent dry rot in the
transportation and commissary depart
ments.
He also urges the enactment of legis
lation in connection with the militia and
national guard forces of the nation that
they may be better fitted for active serv
ice in time of war. and savs:
"Our militia law is obsolete and worth
less. The organization and armament of
the national ?uard of the several states.
which are treated as militia in the ap
propriations Dy tne congress, snouia De
made identical with those provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard in time of war should
be carefully defined and a.-system estab
lished by law under which the method of
procedure of raising volunteer forces
should be prescribed in advance. It is ut
terly impossible in the excitement and
haste ot impending war to do this satis
factorily if the arrangements have not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilizing in the first
volunteer organizations called out the
training of those citizens who have al
ready had experience under arms, and
especially for the selection in advance of
the officers of any force which- may be
raised; for careful selection of the kind
necessary is impossible after the outbreak
or war.
He praises the veterans of the civil war,
the war with Spain and those who have
rendered the nation valiant service in the
Indian uprisings of the west and in the
-ninppines, ana counsels continued lib
erality in the nation's dealing with them,
The Civil Service.
He recommends the enactment of lez-Is.
lation that will place under the rulings
01 ine merit system many classes of em
ployes not now governed by it. His re
ommendation for this is as follows:
I recommend the nassaee of a law
which will extend the classified service to
the District of Columbia or will at least
enaDie tne president thus to extend it.
In my judgment all laws providing- foi
the temporary employment of clerks
should hereafter contain a provision that
they be selected under the civil service
law."
He also wishes the merit system to ob
tain in the government service In the
colonies, ana says:
Not an office should be filled in the
Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard
to the man's partisan affiliations or serv
ices, with any regard to the political, so
cial or personal influence which he may
have at his command. In short, heed
should be paid to absolutely nothing save
the man's own character and capacity
aim me neeas ot tne service.
"Tne administration of these islands
should be as wholly free from the sus
picion of partisan politics as the admin
istration of the army and navy. All thai
we ask from the public servant in the
jr-nuippines or i'orto 1-tico is that he re
flect honor on his country by the way in
which he makes that country's rule a
oeaeiii 10 ine peoples wno nave coma nn.
der it. This is all that we Khrmlr) ask-
and ve cannot afford to be content with
Other Recommendations.
Among other recommendations which the
presiuenr. manes are tnese asking for leg
islation that wiil imnrove th cnnsnlflrsrv.
Ice along lines outlined in bills Introduced
at previous sessions, and he says that:
"It 13 true that the service is now in the
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth in the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on thi
subject are enacted into law."
He believes the time has arrived when
the Indian should cease to be treated as a
memoer of a tribe, but as an individual
and recommends breaking up the tribal
funds, putting a stop to the indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments and stopping the ration system. He
recommends also tne establishment of an
industrial educational system, and an en
deavor to encourage the Indians to become
cattle raisers rather than agriculturists
where their lands are unsuited to tTTe' latter.
He recommends liberal appropriations for
the Louisiana Purchase exposition and an
appropriation covering expenses incurred
by the Charleston exposition in removing
Buvciuiucui einiDns irom ine liuuaio ex
position to that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations is fot
a permanent census bureau, as it would in
sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory
work in the interest of business, statistics,
economic and social science.
The Postal Service.
He calls attention to the growth of the
postal system and to the fact that the an
nual deficit in this department of the gov
ernment service has been reduced to the
small sum of $3,923,727. This, he says, could
further be increased and possibly a surplus
shown but for the fact that many publi
cations are now securing the pound rate
as second-class mail matter which are not
entitled to the same under the law. Oi
this he says:
"The full measure of postal progress
which might be realized has long been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden imposed on the government
through the intrenched and well-understood
abuses which have grown in con
nection with second-class mail matter.
The extent of this burden appears when it
is stated that, while the second-class mat
ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight
of all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal
year only $4,294,4:15 of the aggregate postal
revenue of $111,631,183. If the pound rate
of postage, which produces the large loss
thus entailed and which was fixed by the
congress with the purpose cf encouraging
the dissemination of public information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no just exception could be taken.
That expense would be the recognized and
accepted cost of a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted for a justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys the
privileged rate is wholly outside of the
intent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of such wrongly included
matter is estimated by postal experts to
be one-half of the whole volume of second
class mail. If it be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of the burden is
apparent. The pest office department has
now undertaken to remove the abuses so
far as possible by a stricter application
of the law, and it should be sustained in
its effort."
The Chinese Difficult le.
Ke calls attention to the satisfactory
settlement of the Chinese difficulties of
last year, and this nation's part in the
settlement, and says provisions have
been made for insuring the future safety
of the foreign representatives. Of the
promises made by China he says:
"The Chinese government has agTeed to
participate financially in the work of bet
tering the water approaches to Shanghai
and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade In central and northern China, and
an International conservancy board, in
which the Chinese government is largely
represented, has been provided for the
improvement of the Shanghai rfver and
the control of its navigation. In the same
line of commercial advantages a revision
of the present tariff on imports has been
assented to for the purpose of substitut
ing specific for ad valorem duties, and au
expert has been sent abroad on the part
of the United States to assist in this
work. A list of articles to remain free of
duty, including flour, cereals and rice,'
gold and silver coin and bullion, has also
been agreed upon in the settlement,"
In conclusion, he mentions the Pan
American congress, now in session at the
City of Mexico, and refers to the death of
Queen Victoria and the dowager empreis
of Germany, which aroused the genuine
sympathy of the people of this country,
which sympathy was fully recinrocated
by tne people of both these nations upon
the assassination of President. AIcKinley..
A ROAST FOR JENKINS. - -
President Roosevelt -RemoTe the Oklnho- -ma
Governor and Gives His Reasons
for SoXKlng. v
Washing-ton, Dec. 2. Thomas. FeJ(
g-uson, of Watunga, Ok., was appoiqi-.'
ed governor , of Oklahoma. He is ed
itor of the republican paper there
and chairman of the republican ter
ritorial committee. It is understood
that one of the conditions of Lis ap
pointment was that he resign his po
sition as head of the territorial com
mittee. In connection with the ap
pointment of Mr. Ferguson, President
Roosevelt made the following state
ment: "Gov. Jenkins, of Oklahoma, is
hereby removed because of his im
proper connection with a contract
between the territory and the Okla
homa Sanitarium company. The de
cision is based purely upon his own
written statements and his oral ex
planations of them at the final hear
ing. One of the duties of the terri
torial governor is to enter into a
contract with some person or corpo
ration for the keeping of the insane
of the territory. Gov. Jenkins made"
such a contract with the Oklahoma
Sanitarium company, a corporation
the promoters of which reserved $10,
000 of its stock for the governor and
subject to his orders. In the gov
ernor's explanation of this he told
the promoters at the. time they de-"
sired him to sanction the contract
'that it was an important contract
and I had some friends whom I would
like to have interested and to whom I
owed some political obligations
which I would not be able to pay
by appointment or anything of that
kind.' "

Washington, Dec. 2. Backing for
legislation looking to the punishment
of assaults upon the presidents of the
United States or any of the members
of his cabinet is not to come from
the majority side of the senate and
house. Senator Vest, of Missouri, one
of the most influential and conserva

come to Washintgon with renewed
health and vigor after a summer in
the west, and early in the session he
will offer a resolution calling upon
the senate judiciary committee for
information as to the legal obstacles
in the way of legislation designed to

that not only shall the emigration
laws of the country be amended so
as to exclude recognized anarchists,
but he wishes to devise a plan by
which those who are now in the coun
try may be deported.
