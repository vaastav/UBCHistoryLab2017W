HOMDAY SHOPPING.
Only three weeks remain before
Christmas. The agitation in favor of
•arly shopping has been so wide
spread that the advice may seem a
little trite, but still it is not amiss
to call attention again and again to
the Importance of getting the bulk
of the holiday shopping out of the
way before the last few days preced
ing Christmas.
No store carries an unlimited
stock, either In quantity or variety.
Merchants buy goods to sell. And
when the lines placed in stock for
the Christmas trade become badly
broken or exhausted, it is often im
possible to renew them. The early
ehopper has the opportunity of choos
ing from the entire volume of goods
carried by the merchants of his city.
A little of the choice must be con
fined to such varieties as may he left.
rt is not unusual for the tardy shop
per to find that articles which have
been mentally selected for personal
use or for gifts have been sold out.
and something else must be selected
on the spur of the moment from the
stocks which have already been
picked over. The results are far from
satisfactory.
In the matter of service there is no
comparison between early and late
shopping. If the work is done in time
the customer has the service of reg
ular employes of skill and exper
ience, with leisure to make proper
selections. T^ater on, if shopping is
crowded into a few days, there is a
bustle and a hurry, and additional
help, often unfamiliar with the store
and its goods, and with the needs of
customers, must be employed.
The whole tendency of the times,
and it is a good one, is in the direc
tion of regular and systematic shop
pir-r. Stores are no longer kept
open until late in the evening, ex
cept on special occasions. The Sat
urday night rush is passing. There
Is growing
a
recognition of the fact
that shopping is a matter of business,
to be done during business hours,
and not to be postponed until the last
moment and crowded into a single
period when the changes are decid
edly against satisfactory results. This
applies to holiday shopping, and the
universal tendency is toward the care
ful purchase of goods well in ad
vance of the holiday period, when
both customers and clerics are bet
ter able to give the subject proper
attention.

A WESSON BOTH WAYS,
The Chicago Herald suggest* that
the new and successful activities of
Villa ought to be a lesson to the de
facto government of Mexico on the
folly of rejecting aid in the perform
ance of a task which the Mexican
authorities themselves have thus far
shown themselves to be Incapable of
performing. The lesson is there,
without a doubt. Had the Carrana
forces co-operated with the Ameri
can troops under Pershing:, instead of
placing all sorts of obstacles In their
•way, Villa would long since have
been either killed, captured or driven
Into permanent hiding. He would
nave ceased to be an Influence to be
reckoned with. As it is, he is In pos
session of the capital of one of the
Mexican states, has a following of
several thousand men, and is well
supplied with everything that he
needs to make a forceful and effec
tive campaign. It is to be hoped that
General Carranza and his associates
are fully cognizant of the mag
tude of their blunder, and properly
appreciative of its cost.
But the Mexican situation has its
lesson for Washington as well as for
Mexico. After the raid on Colum
bus wo did not wait for anyone's per
mission to send troops after Villa.
The force at hand was pitifully small,
but, as quickly as men could be got
together, they were sent south in pur
suit of the murderous outlaws. That
was well done, as a 3tart. But It was
not well done If the American gov
ernment did not intend absolutely to
ick those men up under all circum
stances and at all hazards. It would
have been sensible for Carranza to
co-operate with our men. But we
had no right to make their presence
or their actions contingent on Car
ranza's exhibition of good sense. If
Carranza had co-operated, well and
good. That would have simplified
matters greatly. But his past course
had afforded good ground for the be
lief that he would not co-operate, but
that he would be much more likely
to oppose. We should have been pre
pared for that, and we should have
been prepared to carry out our pur
pose without co-operation and despite
his opposition.
Had we done this, we would have
convinced all Mexicans that the Uni
ted States means business, and that
is a lesson which it is particularly de
sirable that Mexicans should learn.
We have lost a lot by not teaching it.
WHEN IS A LAW A IiAW?
For a day or so the state is to have
an entirely new supreme court. Three
men who have been elected to the
state supreme bench believe that their
terms begin on the first Monday in
December. The three Judges whose
terms expire hold that they hold office
until the first of January. Somebody
must decide. The supreme court is
the only body of competent Jurisdic
tion. Three of the members, consti
tuting a majority of the court, are
parties to the proceedings, and can
not properly act. The other two,
though not immediately conoctned in
this case, are interested, in a way,
for the decision will affect their own
tenure of office. The case will be de
cided, therefore, by five district court
Judges sitting as a supreme court.
In principle there is nothing new
In this. In cases in which a supreme
court judge Is disqualified for any rea
son it is quite usual for a district
judge to be called in to sit in his place,
and our own court reports contain
records of numerous cases of this
kind. District judges who were not
elected to the supreme court have
participated in many decisions of that
court, and the validity of such action
is not questioned. The unusual fea
ture is that of having an entire court
made up of men not elected to that
position. However, If one district
judKe can act lawfully as a member
of the supreme court In an emer
gency, there appears to be no reason
why five cannot.
If the court thus constituted should
docide that the retiring judges hold
until the end of the year, that will be
the law. Whatever the supreme court
says Is law is law. That Is what a
supreme court is for. There is no
other or higher authority. The court
will then remain as it is until the end
of the year. Then the new Judges will
take their seats. But notice has
already been given on their behalf
that they will not recognize the im
provised court or its decisions. After
the first of January, therefore, a ma
jority of the court will hold that the
terms of supreme Judges begin on the
first Monday in December. And be
cause that is the view of a majority
of the supreme court, that will then
be the law. In other words, it is quite
possible for the supreme law of the
state to be one thing in December and
another in January. This is interest
irfg, and it may prove confusing, but
there appears to be no way out of it.
There is still another possibility
which has its interesting side. The
three new Judges, having qualified,
hold that they are now regular mem
bers of the supreme court. They are
in the majority, and' will remain so
for some time. They hold that the
retiring judges are out of office, and
that judicial proceedings in which
they may participate are void. What
is to hincfer their holding supreme
court sessions of their own, and, if
necessary, calling in two district
Judges to fill out the number if
Messrs. Bruce and Christianson decllnp
to act? In that case we would have
two supreme courts running at once,
which is a luxury few states permit
themselves. Whether or not this is
done will depend entirely on the new
members themselves, provided the
provisional court holds against them.
After the first of the year the new
judges will be unquestioned mem
bers of the couTt they will be in the
majority and they will naturally be
of the opinion that their own acts
have been legal. And whatever the
majority decides becomes the law.
JAMES TWAMX/EY.
One by one the pioneers are called
away, and now it Is James Twamley
who has gone to his rest. He had
been a familiar figure in the life of
Grand Porks since the very early
days, and his departure brings keen
regret to those who, through a long
series of years, had been familiar with
him, and who had entertained for him
feelings of affection and respect.
Junes Twamley was a man of many
flu* qualities, Wlth-4b« advantage of
a business training in several of the
great cities, when he came to take
part in the life of this new common
wealth he took his place, easily and
naturally, among Its foremost com
mercial men. With a mind unusually
keen and receptive, he added to his
formal academlo education the fruits
of wide reaching and close observa
tion, and became one of the most
ardent advocates of a broad and lib
eral educational policy for the new
state. He was one of the first board
of regents of the State University, and
throughout his life he retained his
active interest in and his sympathetic
regard of that institution. His In
terest In publlo affairs extended from
the details of the business of the
township to the problems of the state
and nation, and, whatever the issue
was, he devoted himself earnestly and
fearlessly to the advocacy of that
which he believed to be right and
just.
A man's character may not be de
scribed in a few words but If it were
desired to specify the dominant traits
in the character of James Twamley,
those which stood out above all others,
most of those who knew him well
would say that these traits were en
thusiasm and optimism. Enthusiasm
seemed to have been born In him.
Whatever he undertook was under
taken whole-heartedly and unreserv
edly. That which Interested him was
given every atom of his strength,
every ounce of his energy. And his
optimism equalled hiB enthusiasm.
His path was not always a smooth
or easy one., In common with others
who tried out their fortune In a new
country, he had his share of adver
sity. But no man ever saw him gloomy
or depressed. Faith and hope sus
tained and cheered him, and it is no
small part of his contribution to his
city and state that he was able to in
spire faith and hope in others.

GRAND FORKS HERALD, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1919.
PRESIDENT WILSON'S
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
(Continued from Page 1.)
upon the practical results, deeming
tnese the measures most immediately
needed but It postponed action upon
the other suggestions until an oppor
tunity should be offered for a more
deliberate consideration of them. The
rourth recommendation I do not deem
necessary to renew. The power
of the Interstate commerce commis
won to grant an Increase of rates on
the (round referred to is indisputably
clear and a recommendation by the
congress with regard to Buch a mat
«»r might seem to draw in question
the scope of the commission's au
thority or Its .Inclination to do Justice
when there Is no reason to doubt
either.
The other suggestions,—the in
lncrease In the interstate commercC
membership and In its
facilities for performing its manifold
duties, the provision for full publlo
investigation and assessment of Indus
trial disputes, and the grant to the
executive of the power to control and
operate the railways when necessary
in time of war or other like public
necessity,—I now very earnestly re
new.
The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who
"aye entrusted us with the responsi
bility and duty of serving ahd safe
£u»rding them In such matters would
find it hard, I believe, to excuse a
failure to act upon these grave mat
ters or any unnecessary postponement
of action upon them.
Not only does the Interstate com
merce commission now find it prac
tically impossible, with Its present
membership and organization, to per
form its great functions promptly
and thoroughly but it is not unlikely
that it may presently be found advis
able to add to its duties still others
equally heavy and exacting. It must
first be perfected as an administrative
Instrument.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances
for lack of additional means of ar
bitration and conciliation which the
congress can easily and promptly sup
ply. And all will agree that there
must be no doubt as to the power of
the executive to make immediate and
uninterrupted use of the railroads for
the concentration of the military
forces of the nation wherever they
are needed and whenever they are
needed.
This Is a program of regulation,
prevention, and administrative effi
ciency which argues its own case in
the mere statement of it. With re
gard to one of its items, the increase
in the efficiency of the interstate com
merce commission, the house of rep
resentatives has already acted Its ac
tion needs only the concurrence of the
senate.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesi
tate to act upon the suggestion should
I make it, that any man In any occu
pation should be obliged by law to
continue in an employment which he
desired to leave. To pass a law
fore receiving the approval of society
in doing so would be to adopt a new
principle into our Jurisprudence which
I take it for granted we are not pre
pared to introduce. But the proposal
that the operation of the railways of
the country shall not be stopped or
interrupted by the concerted action
of organized bodies of men until a
public Investigation shall have been
instituted which shall make the whole
question at issue plain for the judg
ment of the option of the nation is
not to propose aay such principle. It
is based upon this very different prin
ciple that the concerted action of
powerful bodies of men shall not be
permitted to stop the Industrial proc
esses of the nation, at any rate before
the nation shall have had an oppor
tunity to acquaint itself with the
merits of the case as between em
ploye and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of con
ciliation or arbitration. I can see
nothing in that proposition but the
justifiable safeguarding by society of
the necessary processes of its very
life. There is nothing arbitrary or
unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily
and unjustly done. It can and should
be done with a full and scrupulous
regard for the interests and liberties
of all concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society Itself.
Three matters of capital impor
tance await the action of the senate
which have already been acted upon
by the house of representatives: the
bill which seeks to extend greater
freedom of combination to those en
gaged in promoting the foreign com
merce of the country than is now
thought by some to be legal under
the terms of the laws against
monopoly the bill amending the pres
ent organic law of Porto Rico and
the bill proposing a more thorough
and systematic regulation of the ex
penditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices
Act. I need not labor my advice that
these measures be enacted Into law.
Their urgency lies in the manifest
circumstances which render their
adoption at this time not only op
portune but necessary. Even delay
would seriously jeopard the Interests
of the country and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to
regulate the expenditure'of money in
elections may seem to be less neces
sary than the Immediate enactment
of the other measures to which I re
fer because at least two years will
elpase before another election in
which federal offices are to be filled
but it would greatly relieve the pub
lic mind if this important matter were
dealt with while the circumstances
and1 the dangers to the public morals
of the present method of obtaining
and spending campaign funds stand
clear under recent observation and
the methods of expenditure can be
frankly studied in the light of pres
ent experience and a delay would
have the further very serious disad
vantage of postponing action until
another election was at hand and
some special object connected with it
might be thought to be in the mind
of those who urged it Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance
and without suspicion of partisan pur
pose.
I shall not argue at length the de
sirability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, will immediately assume,
has indeed already assumed, a mag
nitude unprecedented in our exper
ience. We have not the necessary in
strumentalities for its prosecution It
Is deemed to be doubtful whether
they could be created upon an ade
quate scale under our present laws.
We should clear away all legal ob
stacles and create a basis of undoubt
ed law for it which will give freedom
without permitting unregulated li
cense. The thing must be done now,
because the opportunity Is here and
may escape us if we hesitate or de
lay.
"At the last session of the congress
a bill was passed by the senate which
provides for the promotion of voca
tional and Industrial education which
Is of vital importance to the whole
country because It concerns a matter,
too long neglecteid, upon which the
thorough Industrial preparation of the
coifhtry for th« critical years of eco
nomic development immediately
ahead of us in very large measure
depends. May I not urge Its early
and favorable consideration by the
-ftS'-f&uk,
I
fe-
1
house of representatives and Its early
enactment into law? It contains plans
which affect all Interests and all parts
of the country and I am sure that
there Is no legislation now pending
before the congress whose passage the
country awaits with more thoughtful
approval or greater Impatience to see
a great and admirable thing set In the
way of being done.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of
Porto Rico is brief and conclusive,
The present laws governing the Is
land and regulating the rights and
privileges of its people are not Just.
We have created expectations of ex
tended privilege which we have not
satisfied. There is uneasiness among
the people of the island and even a
suspicious doubt with regard to our
intentions concerning them which the
adoption of the pending measure
would happily remove. We do not
doubt what we wish to do In any es
sential particular. We ought to do It
at "once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be
found and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen,
probably the last occasion I shall have
to address the Sixty-fourth congress,
I hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and sat
isfaction I have co-operated with you
in the many measures of constructive
policy with which" you have enriched
the legislative annals of the oountry.
It has been a privilege to labor In
such company. I take the liberty of
congratulating you upon the comple
tion of a record of rare serviceableness
and distinction.

If you must have your meat every

uric acid which almost paralyzes the
kidneys in their efforts to expel It

gish and weaken, then you suffer with
a dull misery in the kidney region,
sharp pains in the back oi- hick head
ache, dizziness, your stomach sours,
tongue is coated and when the
weather is bad you have rheumatic
twinges. The urine gets cloudy, full
of sediment, the channels often get
sore and Irritated, obliging you to
seek relief two or three times during
the night.
To neutralize these irritating acids,
to cleanse the kidneys and flush off
the body's urinous waste get four
ounces of Jad Salts from any pharm

glass of water before breakfast for a
few days and your kidneys will then
act fine. This famous salts la made
from the »cid of grapes and lemon
juice, combined with llthia, and has
been used for generations to flush and
stimulate sluggish kidneys, also to
neutralize the acids in urine, so it no
longer irritates, thus ending bladder
