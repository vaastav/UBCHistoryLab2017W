After all, is not the farmer the real

But that Englishman who is ta:king
about "the joyless American fa.e"

One of the easiest th.ngs in the

Spain is spending $72,000,0,0 on
a new navy. The source of the mon

The worst has happened. They have

"mother" will either have to complte
or admit that they are better ti.an
she used to make.
"Credit is better than money," says
James J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern Railroad. But you bet if
you ride on Jim's road or ship any
hogs or cattle along his line you w.1l

Prosperous America sent more than
$125,000,000 abroad for luxuries dur

last. These figuies do not include
the scores of millions of dollars spent
by Americans traveling in foreign
countries.
Thomas A. Edison claims that he
can make an automobile for $2,0
that will last for fifteen years. But
why should anybody want an au.o
mobile that will last as long as that?
We will all be flying in less than fif
ten years from now.
Now that congress is in tession
I again it is time.to flood it with pro
tests against the "'fe--seed folly."
It costs $250,000 for seeds, and $250,

the millions of packages. Mon y
which could be oevoted to ag icul
tural interests of real value to Amer

or more of these tree seed packages
forced upon the farmers of l.ong Is
land this year were destroyed by them
and on investigation it was found
that many of them had been on the
market 20 or 30 ycars, and yet were
called 'rare and xaluable."

Is not the building up of your small
town more to you than the building
up of some far-away city? Is it not
a fact that if our town had 25 0,0
population instead of 4,000 it would
be better for us all? Would there not
be much more employment, would
not these people consume more pro
ducts and consequently make a better
market; would not the small homes
with one lot be dcubled in value and
every farm within a radius of ten mil
es be worth $10 to $50 an acre more?
Then, is it only a good thing for the
merchant or tradesman if you buy of
him? Is it not just as good a thing
for you?

A thing that the real estate pur
chaser should consider in his l.ur- E
chasing is the tendency of the aver
age man to believe that the day for
profitable inlvestment has gone by.
Prices today naturally seem high
when one recalls how cheaply the
same property sold a generatiun ago.
How often one hears: "If my fath
er had bought that property thirty
years ago he'd be a rich man today."
And how seldom the man who makes
this statement reflects that thirty
years from now his son will be say
ing the same thing of him.
It is stated on excellent authority

RESTS IN HANDS OF CONGRESS.
Opinion of Cubans Regarding Policy
of the United States.
Havana, Dec 5.-The message of
President Roosevelt to the American
congress was published in the local
press. No editorial comment on it
was made. Liberal and Moderate
leaders are chary of expressing an
opinion of the president's declaration
regarding a Cuban policy, but the
general view is that it does not differ
materially from the statements made
0 in the letter to Senor Quesada, the
a Cuban minister, last September, and
s that the final determination of the
j policy of the United States rests in
the hands of congress.

ing church and state. There will be
no change of policy on this srubject be
cause of his accession, for he was min
Ister of interior in M. Sarrien's cabinet
and his right hand man. The late
premier resigned on account of ill
health. He used to say, "Sarrien is
the driver, but Clemenceau drives the
drivyr." Indeed, Clemenceau has a rep
s
utatian as a sort of Warwiek, as a
statesman who was able to make or
unmake ministers at will, but who until
now was unable to be premier himself.
M. Clemenceau was born sixty-five
years ago and comes of an old Hugue
not family of the province of Vendee.
The father of Premier Clemencean
was a strong 'republican, and the son
was brought up with the Idea that he
must fight for his views as a member
of the minority in his community. He
was educated for the practice of medl
cine, but before he had had a chance
to advance very far In his profession
was compelled to leave the country on
account of his radical views. This
was just before the fall of the Emperor
Napoleon III. Clemenceau removed to
New York, and while trying to estab
lish a practice in the French colony he
for a time taught French. One of his
pupils was a Miss Mary H. Plummer
of Greenwich, Conn. He fell In love
with her, and they were married In
1870 by Mayor A. Oakey Hall at the
New York city hall, M. Clemenceau be

Why Better Ieadt Are WNeede
Patrons along the various rural
routes should take warning from a cidr
eumatance that has happened at Rich
mond, D.l., where.on account of the la
ferior condition of the highways a
rural route has been discontinued, says
the Motor News. On some of the
roads splendid work has been done:
but not until the deep sand roads give
place to good, hard thoroughfares will
the government ever give the farmers
more than see delivery of mall per
day. When counties awake to a full
realising sense of the benefite to be de
rived from properly built roads then
and then only will the government in
erease the present service. But with
the advent of good roads and automo
bile delivery the government will give
both morning and afternoon mail serv
lee, and the farmer will thqn be as well
cared for as are his eity friends.
salt to Lay Dust.
Salt is the latest device for laying
dust on roads in the country, says the
London Globe. The author of this new
departure Is M. Trintzins, city sur
veyor of Rouen. in France, who has
published it as the result of a long se
ries of experiments. The list of these,
while bringing out the weak side at
the new system, possesses considerable
Interest as showing it to possess real
possibilities of utility. A long stretch
ef road was frst watered and then
sprinkled with salt. The next day the
surface of the road was covered with a
thin glazed crust. Rain removed this
in parts, but where the glaze remained
there was no dust for five days.
