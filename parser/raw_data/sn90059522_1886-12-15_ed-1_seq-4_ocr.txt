A DELINQUENT SENATOR.
Congress is in the second week of its j
work, but the senior senator from Florida ;
continues to linger and shudder on the j
frosty shores of Lake Michigan. Day after j
day his name is called on the senate roll and >
vet he responds not. Day by day the gray- j
haired janitor of the senate chamber dusts a
vacant chair in the senate hall and places a
fragrant bouquet on a vacant desk. But
the senator whose place it is to occupy the j
chair comes not, and the fragrance of the
flowers on his desk is wasted on desert air.
The particular cause which rivets the orange
grove representative to the ice-bound shores
of Michigan is not the legitimate subject of
public criticism. The senator is supposed
to be the master of his own heart, and can
lavish its affections upon whatsoever object
he selects. But there is one standpoint
from which the pubiic can discuss his ab- I
sence from his desk in the senate chamber
and can call him to an account. When Sen
ator Joxes qualified as a member of con
gress he entered into a contract with the
people of the United States that for and in
consideration of $5,000 per annum he would
give his services to the public for the term
of six years. The people have fulfilled their
part of the contract and Mr. Jones is re
ceiving his salary. It is about time that
Senator Jones awakened to a moral
sense of his obligations. His place is in
Washington and not in Detroit. If his
personal interests require his presence in
the latter city, then, as an honorable man,
his duty is to cancel his contiact with the
public and allow his place to be filled by j
some one else, who will, at least, go
through the show of attempting to earn his (
salary. It may be true that congress, like 1
the parliament in good old King George's I
daj s, is doing nothing in particular, and
doing it very well, but that does not relieve
Senator Jones from the responsibility of
aiding congress in performing what he him
self has displayed marvelous capacity for
th™ art of doing nothing. If the Florida
senator does not at once return to his seat,
the senate ought to discharge its duty
to itself and the country by making a con
spicuous example of him and declare his
seat vacant. If this was a matter exclu
sively between the state of Florida and its
delinquent senator we would not have a
word to say. but, inasmuch as Mr. Joxes'
salary is being paid out of the federal treas
ury, the people of the whole country are
entitled to a voice in the matter. And the
public verdict is that no public money shall
be paid out for services that are not ren
dered.
m
TnE MEMORIAL CRANK.
Congress does a great many things that it
ought to leave undone and it leaves undone
a great many things that it ought to do.
The consequence is that congress gets a
great deal of blame which it merits. But
there is one thing that congress is not to be
blamed tor failing to perform, lt does not
merit condemnation for refusing to read j
every petition or memorial that is sent in to
it. Of course a member is obliged to present
to the house of which he is a member any
sort of a memorial that is sent in, but
the member's duty terminates with its formal
presentation. As an illustration of the ex
tent to which the petition nuisance is carried,
Senator McMillax presented to congress
the other day, a petition from a Minnesota
constituent covering eight or ten pages of
foolscap paper, memorializing congress in
relation to the Nicaraugua ship canal pro
ject. The Record says that without having
been read the petition was sent to the com
mittee on foreign affairs. There it !
will sleep the sleep of ages. Not
a member of the committee will |
trouble himself to read it Beyond the
iter himself, not a human eye will eve*
trace the lines of the document In the
years to come some employe of the senate
may take it from its pigeon hole to remove
the accumulated dust from it, and unless
his eye rests upon the written Indorsement
on the back, no human being will ever
know that such a document is in existence.
This is only one of the thousands of illus
trations of the useless expenditure of time
and brain power American citizens in
dulge in in a vaiu attempt to impress their
individuality on A * can legislation.
And yet we can't blame congress for re
fusing to do what we wouldn't do our
selves.
m
COUNTY-SEAT CONTESTS.
If there is anything that can provoke
civil war in a community it is a county-seat
contest This has been abundantly illus
trated in Minnesota this year. The dis
tinction of being the c apital of a county is
an honor the average country village cannot
let slip without a vigorous struggle to retain
it. Of the many curious and complicated
features which enter iuto these contests the
Traverse county contest furnishes a notable
illustration. As soon as the official an
nouncement of the vote was made by Gov.
Hibbaim). the people of Wheaton went
down to Brown's Valley for the purpose of
removing the public records. The people
of the latter town resisted the invasion and
quite a lively melee ensued. Col. Samuel
J. Bnowfi, in his interview with the
Globe, vindicates the Brown's Valley
people from the charge of using mob vio
lence, claiming that they only resorted to
force so far as force was necessary to resist
force. At all events they succeeded in
holding on to the county records. But the
legal complications which have arisen in
th* case are the really curious features.
Several years ago the question of locating
the Bounty seat was submitted to a vote of
the people of Traverse county. The two
places in competition were Brown's Valley
and Maudeda. The latter place had
no town charter, being simply a
proposed town site which the
owner had distinguished by naming after
his two daughters, Maude and Eda. And
although the vote resulted in favor of
Maudeda, the district court held on a con- j
test that, Inasmuch as Maudeda had no J
legal existence, the county seat had been j
permanently located at Brown's Valley, that :
being the only other place voted for. An •
appeal was taken from this decision which f
is still pending in the supreme court of the j
state. In the meantime Brown's Valley j
has been recognized as the seat of county 1
justice. Last November the question of
removing the county seat from Brown's ;
Valley to Wheaton was submitted to a vote
of the people. A majority of the votes
were cast in favor of Wheaton and so J
declared by the governor. Now the Brown's j
Valley people resort to the courts, alleging j
in the first place that the late election was I
invalid during the pendency of Maudeda's
appeal in the supreme court, and, in the
second place, if the supreme court should
affirm the decision of the lower court, then
Brown's Valley would be the permanent
county seat, and under the act of the legis
lature passed in ISSS it would require a 1
three-fifths vote to remove it. Wheaton i
having failed to receive three-fifths of the ] .
vote cast at the late election, the Brown's j
Valley people resist the right of the former j
place to be named as the county seat But j
the most curious part of all is that these j
questions were not thought of before the
election.
■
REMOVING DISABILITIES.
The bill introduced into congress to re
move the disabilities of those persons who ,
fought in the Confederate army seems to be }
a matter of sentiment more than of practi- i
cal utility, but it should be given considera- j
tion none the less on that account. ;
If the ex-Confederates feel that j
the prohibition against ever serv- j
ing in the United States army or j
navy under which they now rest separates j
them in a measure from the rest of their j
countrymen, and prevents them, even
though they are perfectly reconciled to the j
result of the great civil conflict, from re- j
garding themselves, in the fullest sense \
of the term, citizens of a , reunited
and entirely harmonious nation, then
it would be simply a gracious act
on the part of the government— too
strong to fear any evil result from us gen
erosity—to grant them the favor they ask.
The passage of a quarter of a century since
the war has taken away the majority of !
those who participated in the great strug
gle. Those who remain, enfeebled with
age and broken with infirmities, are
far down the hill of life. In
most instances, but few years remain to j
them in which to enjoy the experience of
living again in peace and unity with their
fellow men. If the removing of their dis
abilities will render any more tranquil the
declining days of these veterans, it is
a consideration which the country
can well afford to grant them. To
those who are still able-bodied men,
vigorous with the health of middle age, the
passage of the bill will be no less grate
ful, and these in time of war, by their
valiant service to the nation, which could
be forgiving as well as just, would demon
strate the wisdom of the action which
would make them in every respect loyal
and patriotic citizens.
KEEP WITHIN YOUR MEAN'S.
The recurrence of the season of holiday
festivities, with the attendant pleasing cus
tom of giving aud receiving gifts, brings
with it a danger to which Americans, with
their proverbial liberality, are too apt to
subject themselves— the making of gifts
which are really beyond their means.
This matter of making presents has
grown from year to year until
it has almost entirely lost its original and
beautiful significance, and has become sim
ply an exchange of articles of more or less
value in which each person strives to out
do the other through a species of absurd
false pride, which will not suffer one's
neighbors to make, if possible, more costly
presents than oneself. The sentiment which
attaches to a Christmas present should be
the first consideration. ■ While it is well
enough for those who have been liberally
endowed with this world's goods to follow
the advice given Laertes, and make their
presents as well as their habits "as costly
as their purse can buy," it is the
height of foolishness for persons less
favored by fortune to endeavor to
maintain the same standard. The
merest trifle, accompanied by a wealth
of affection, should be, and doubtless is in
most cases, dearer to the recipient than the
costliest article given, simply in the observ
ance of custom and without the refining in
fluence of sentiment. The proneness
to ostentation which becomes yearly
more apparent, should be cur
tailed, and the pretty habit of gift
giving which symbolized the meaning con
veyed by Christmas day to the whole civil
ized world be restored to something like the
simplicity which characterized it in the
olden time. Buy Christmas gifts by all
means, th© house would be cheerless indeed
into which they did not enter, but in doing
so remember to be just to yourself before
you are generous to others, and keep
within your means.

"NATURALIZATION LAWS.
The case of Grottkau, the Milwaukee
rioter and anarchist, who believed himself
capable of instructing his associates how to
vote as well as advising them for whom they
should work, and who set himself up
generally as a dictator of his com
rade's actions, illustrates well the mon
>*--,, 1 - looseness with which the natural
on laws are administered in this conn
try, particularly in the West. Gp.ott
kau, having sworn that he had
been a resident of Wisconsin for
a year and of the United States for five
years was admitted to full citizenship and
permitted to vote. It was subsequently
discovered that he had only been in the
state eight months, aud notwithstand
ing the fact that for most of
this time he had been a notorious character
the fact that he was not entitled to citizen
ship was not found out until he had voted.
In many cases it is, of course, impossible for
the proper authorities to look with great
closeness into the validity of an appli
cant's claims to the right of being granted
the significants, rights and privileges of
an American citizen, but in the majority
of instances much closer scrutiny cap be
maintained. If the right of fran
chise was more jealously guarded
there would be a clearer moral atmosphere
at the polls on election day, and many of
the evils which now seem inseparably
united with municipal politics would
be avoided. There is altogether too
much laxity in this matter and
there is not a single large city in
the country which is not in a greater 01
less degree open to criticism. The Ameri
can spirit of liberality should not be ex
tended to the ' granting of the dearest
privileges enjoyed by. the citizens of a
republic to those who neither have a right
to them nor are. in many cases, capable of
appreciating them.
A BLOW AT CHICAGO.
Another indication of Chicago's ap
proaching loss of prestige as the center of j
the Northwest's cattle trade and of the cer- ;
j taiuty with which St. Paul will succeed to j
■, the position, is seen in a negotiation re- j
j cently entered into by a prominent Mon- j
tana cattle man and the Detroit Dry Dock '
' company, looking to the construction of a j
j number of refrigerator boats. These ves
l sels are to ply between Duluth and Buffalo, ;
I and will be so constructed that it will be a j
matter of the utmost ease to convey !
• dressed meat by them to the seaboard. The j
1 primary object of this arrangement is to |

escape the charges of the Chicago middle
men, but it will also serve to render more j
stable the establishment of the stock
market in St. Paul. Duluth will !
naturally be the lake shipping
point, and purchasers would obviously pre
fer to establish their headquarters at a
point nearer than Chicago to this shipping
center, or, in other words, St. Paul. In
this city exist all the facilities for trans
portation and slaughtering, and the haul to
Duluth being but a short one, the meat in
tended for transportation can be readily
dressed here where It is purchased. The
gentlemen who are pushing the cattle mar
ket enterprise here with so much energy cer
tainly have everything in their favor, and if
they can induce all Western stockmen to
view the matter in the same light of self
interest, there can remain little doubt that
Chicago's supremacy in the matter of the
cattle trade will soon come to an end.
THE REASON WHY.
The Globe cheerfully yields space to
the vigorous kick a correspondent makes
against the publication of the Lord Coi.in*
Campbelt. scandal. The Globe regrets
as much as it is possible for our correspond
ent to regret, that the English aristocracy
should parade their vices before the public
in such offensive manner. It also regrets
that public curiosity is so wonderfully
aroused to hear all of the filthy details. But
as these things do occur, and the public de
mands to know all about them, and par
ticularly as the Globe is a newspaper
whose mission is to give the news, we hold
our nose and let it go. As to the goody
goody class of people, of whose whereabouts
our correspondent makes particular inquiry,
all that we can say is that to our certain
knowledge some of them are so busily en
gaged in keeping up with the Campbell
divorce case they haven't time to devote to
small matters. It is no pleasure to the
average newspaper to publish social rot. but
as long as society is rotten and newspapers
continue to be newspapers, it is going to be
published. The fault does not lie with the
newspapers. It rests in the bosom of
society.
ST. PAUL'S BUILDING STATISTICS.
A half a million dollars increase in the
building statistics in oue year is a pretty
fair showing for a young city that didn't
make any special effort to force a building
boom, yet that is St. Paul's increase over
last year's statistics, and there has proba
bly been no year of the city's growth when
there was as little effort made in the build
ing line. Everything that was built was
done in obedience to the imperative de
mands of the city's growing population
and the growth of its business prosperity.
And yet it foots up nearly ten millions of
dollars in one year.
The Globe being a newspaper, is of course
much pleased to be of such service to a morn
ing contemporary that it is enabled to give
its readers, after a diligent perusal of the
Globe's columns, the news of the day. But
we respectfully submit that, excellent as the
news is, it suffers somewhat in freshness
through our contemporary's habit of pub
lishing it from one to two days alter it ap
pears iv the Globe, which has happened
thrice within the past week.

Senator Jones was kicked again yesterday
This time it was a runaway horse did it.
Samuel Asteroid Phillips,
well known in St. Paul as
the nucleus around which
the Young Men's Republican
club massed Itself; a full,
round-faced gentleman, who

byaVanderbiltorGould; a
comfortable-looking young
man with an idea or two of
his own, and who persisted in wearing: his vest
unbuttoned in July and August on Wabasha
street, has given this thriving settlement the
grand shake and burrowed among the eleva
tors and coal piles of rustling Duluth, where
be Ffas assumed the steering apparatus of
tho Duluth Sunday Sun, a weekly publica
tion of mudh' credit to its managers. Frank
Lazarus Buell, Phillips' shadow, has em
barked in the enterprise with him. Buell as
a solicitor of subscriptions and a reacher-out
for advertising matter has no peer in the
Northwest, a fact which the business men in
the Zenith City, which, by the way, is some
what hoary-headed, will appreciate when he
has made two or three trips up and down
their necks.
The editorial management of the Sun has
been Intrusted to the North Dakota genus of

September astride a black and tan blizzard
and jumped off at St. Paul. His breeziness
was manifested through the columns of a
local paper, and George gave evidences of
originality of thought and style of composi
tion that would do credit to Mark Twain or

the Sun are safe in his hands, and if Bill Nye
has an idea of retiring from the manufacture
of sorrel-topped humor, he can find in George
somebody to take his place.
***
Among the many pictures of perfect
health to be found in the state of Minnesota
there is not one mote striking than in
the case of Senator C. B. Buckman,
of Morrison county. He looks as
robust as the stoutest English yeoman
in the days of Robin Hood, and he has a con
stitution as firm as iron. During the clearing
up of the wreck made Dy the cyclone that
swept through St. Cloud and Sauk Rapids last
summer-he was one of the tireless workers.
He worked day and night, taking hardly any
sleep for an entire week. One of the coldest
days week before last Senator Buckman was
seated in the rotunda of the Merchants, con
versing with his fricuds,nnd his feet were en
cased in low-cut shoes of Kangaroo pelt,
above the tops of which showed narrow strips
of thin cotton socks.
"Buckrri; n." said a friend. "I should think
you'd catch a d— l of a cold wearing low shoes
and cotton socks this weather."
"I wear cotton socks and low shoes all the
year round," replied Buckman. "I tried to
wear boots one winter, but the legs were so
stiff that they made a corn or two on my
shins and I threw them away. Haven't worn
boots since."
A little later tho senator was seen on the
corner of Third and Jackson streets with his
four-button cutaway thrown open, talking
politics with a man clad in a heavy buffalo
coat, seal skin cap and thick overshoes. Tin.*
senator didn't seem to realize that the ther
mometer was about twenty degrees below

The discussions of the Ontario plan, which
have been held in the chamber of commerce
committee meetings, have developed some
very entangling situations. Outside of hall
a dozen men, the attendance is not the same
at two consecutive meetings, and when the
talk is going on, seemingly on one point
some new man asks a question which four or
live answer at the same time, each in a dif
ferent way. Each brings up a new idea, and
each of these develops as many more, sev
eral of which are discussed at the same time.
So many strings being pulled at once, some
of those present lose track of them and more
questions are asked. . Tho result is, that
about every fifteen minutes the question gets
back to the original proposition, and so goes
on around and arouud until no one knows
when the end is reached. Lawyers and finan
ciers, members of the legislature and city
officials, all being accustomed to so me par
ticular phase of things, don't agree on any
thing very easily. If the same gentlemen
had been in attendance at all the meetings
a bill could have been agreed upon long ago,
but the endless explanations necessary to
new-comers make the meetings entangling
and tedious.
THE CAMPBELL SCANDAL.
A Correspondent Who Thinks it
Should Met be Published.
To the Editor of the Globe. .
I have been searching for some time now
all corners of your paper for a protest from
the teachers of the moral, protesting against
your making your paper a common sewer
through which to pour upon the community
the slush of the divorce courts, or as lately
using it as a metaphoric clothes line on which
to hang out in broadest view dirty European
linen, becrested and bclaeed, it is neverthe
less of the dirtiest a sight to make fastidious
people a little faint with disgust in lactl believe
a pretty strong stomach will feel some qualms
in the contemplation. I have expected to see
a heading in half inch type, "Are there no
Police Gazettes In these days where such mat
ter can be relegated and our family journals
be kept free?*' Having seen no such remon
strance nor head, I am constrained to inqure
where areall the moral reformers and teachers':*
Where are all those who cannot look upon the
ballet except when it is in striped trowsers?
Where are those people of the finest feeling
who wished last autumn to veil the rather
harmless)"remains" of statuary in the exhibi
tion'/ Where those who find the opera im
moral and Sunday amusements a deadly sin?
Where the good men who voted for McGill,
also in the interest of morality? Are they
dead, or only sleeping? And you. Mr. Editor,
with your grand journal with its "Sunday
edition of twenty panes" aud its long lists of
Jenkins peports. the delight of us rustics, of
what are you thinking? Getting spicy and
start lint? paragraphs, or what? Perhaps of
warning our young Americans against yield
ing to the temptation of titles and money. If
so, let me beg of you let them rather "burst
in ignorance." Let them marry and re
pent at leisure or not, as the case
may be, but let them remain
ignorant as long as possible. Now, that the
queen of Enland has sot the example, I am
sure your polite public will sustain you in
banishing all such matter now and forever
from your pages, which visits constantly so
many intelligent firesides. What have our
minor sons and our, marriageable or un
manageable daughters to do with such mat
ters! And our old men and women well,
they are too old. I feel very shamefaced in
entering upon this ground, where evidently
angels have not dared to tread, but ray feel
ings have been too great for repression. This
must be my excuse. Most respectfully,

The Manitoba's Competitors-- An Ac
commodating Baggageman"
Got the sinch.
There was a representative body of railroad
men in the city yesterday. It consisted of
General Manager Mellen, Assistant General
Manager Allen, General Freight Agent Ma
lone, Assistant General Freight Agent Bar
low and General Passenger Agent Barker, all
of the Wisconsin Central road. They were in
a new business car, splendidly appointed and
of elegant construction. The party claimed
to be on a tour of inspection of the road, and
had been to Ashland, Wis., from which point
they were returning. They left the city at
12:45 p. m. yesterday for Chicago. The
frequent visits of the officials of
this line to Northwestern . , , points
give rise to considerable speculation, and it
is surmised that when sprint* opens the road
will make some moves that will surprise the
people. An official of the road said a few
days ago: "The erection of buildings in St.
Paul and the enlargement of freight yards
are two improvements that it is anticipated
the road will make, and then there is to be
a great deal of money expended up along
the line, and Ashland will be given a quiet
boom that she isn't figuring on."
Burlington Appointment*.
It is understood that an appointment has
been made to fill the vacancy caused by the
recent death of David Coleman, superin
tendent of the northern division of the
Chicago, Burlington & Northern road. The
appointment has not yet been publicly an
nounced, but it is given on good authority
that A. R. Horn has been appointed to fill the
vacancy. Mr. Horn was formerly train
master of the division, and he will bo suc
ceeded by M. T. Hinckley.
Revising a. Basing Sheet.
The lowa Passenger Rate association met
yesterday at the union depot. There were
present: S. K. Wilson, chief rate clerk of the
Chicago & Northwestern road: G. A. Silvey.
rate clerk of the Chicago, Rock Island &
Pacific: W. S. Keenan, rate clerk of the
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy: J. N. Brown,
of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern;
W. A. Russell, chief clerk of the passenger
department of the Central lowa, and repre
sentatives ol local lines. The meeting was
called for the purpose of revising the lowa
casing sheet and* the making of rates from
juuetion points iv lowa and St. Paul, Minne
apolis and the Minnesota Transfer. The
work done was simply of interest to the lines
interested, and was made necessary by the
recent adoption of the three-cent a mile tariff
on passenger traffic.
Manitoba Competition.
Tho Manitoba road is building its line into
the Northwestern territory as perseveringly
as ever, and on either side of it aud behind it
are its competitors. The Duluth & Manitoba
will be completed to East Grand Forks iv a
few days aud an agent will be appointed at
that point. This will give East Grand Forks
direct connection with St. Paul by a connec
tion with the Northern Pacific road at Haw
ley. The Northern Paniflc road intends to
push its lines from East Grand Forks to St.
Vincent, and some arrangement will be made
to run their trains into Winnipeg-. Next
spring the Northern Pacific will reach
out into the Devil's Lake and
Western country, building lines parel
lel with the Manitoba spurs. This will
tend to enliven the competition and the Mani
toba people will be obliged to clean the film
off their eyes in order to keep ahead in the
race for busiuess.
They've Got the Sinch.
C. L. Wellington, chairman of the joint
Western classification committee, has made a
ruling that has prompted Commissioner
Faithorn, of tho Northwestern Freight asso
ciation, to issue a circular to the effect that
shipments of toboggans, as included iv the
association, will be subject to double first
class rate between Chicago group points and
Burlington group points and St. Paul, Minne
apolis and the Minnesota Transfer. It is an
exceedingly frigid day when a railroad man'
can't figure out an advantage to himself
when the necessities of the people compel
them to turn to him for assistance. Of course
the ice carnival in St. Paul this year will
cause Eastern manufacturers to ship a great
number of toboggans to the Northwest. The
people in the Northwest must have them.
An ice carnival without toto.'gans would be
a very tame affair, and the railroads say if
the people waut them they must pay two
prices to them for bringing them. While the
citizen kicks the railroad officials thrust their
hands deep down into their pockets, look
down on the bucking citizen and calmly say:
"Well, what aro you going to do about it?"
A Polite Baggageman.
A man came in from the North a few days
ago, on the Northern Pacific road, accompa
nying the remains of his deceased brother,
which were lying in a casket in the baggage
car. When the train reached the depot the
corpse was transferred to another train for
transportation East. For the transportation
of a corpse it is necessary to procure a first
class full fare ticket, but this fact seemed to
be overlooked by the local baggageman, who
checked the mourning brother's trunk, and
thinking that the corpse should be checked
too, he did so and took the check to the car
and gave it to the man. The brother took the
brass slip and handing tho baggageman a
cigar said, "Thank you."
"Oh, don't mention it," replied the baggage
man, "I'd be glad to the favor for you any
time," and he walked proudly away, while
the brother looked after him with a puzzled
expression on his face. j]j£j£|
A Sew Tariff.
The Northern Pacific road issued a tariff
sheet on freight between St. Paul, Minnesota
Transfer, Minneapolis, Duluth and Superior
and Oakes, the new station just opened. The
tariff is as follows: On merchandise, per 100
pounds, first class, $1.25: second, $1.10; third,
HO cents; fourth, 70 cents; fifth, 49 cents.
Carloads, per 100 pounds, soft lumber, shingles
and lath, 23 cents; grain. flour, feed. 23
cents; lime, salt, cement and stucco, 23%
cents. Live stock, per carload, horses and
mules, $56; cattle or hogs, $50; sheep. $1:!.
Rates on coal in carloads from Eastern termi
nals will be, to Oakes, $4 per 2,000 pounds.
Emigrant movables from Eastern terminals
to Glover and Oakes will be billed at the rate
of $35 per carload and 35 cents per cwt. for
less than carloads, subject to the rules and
conditions iv the emigrant movable tariff.
There is no agent and freight should be pre
paid.
Chicago Railroad meetings.
Chicago, Dec. 14. — The general meeting
to-day of the Central Traffic association was a
dull affair. A complaint was mado by the
managers that the freight rates had to be cut
from all association points, the blame being
laid upon the fast freight agents, whose
eagerness to procure business had brought
about demoralization, It was agrted to let
the executive committee handle the subject
and bring about a restoration. Some talk
was had in regard to the interstate commerce
bill, but no formal action was taken to oppose
it, the general opinion of the managers being
that its passage was inevitable. It was agreed
that the thirty-cent grain rate from Chicago
to New York, ordered in effect
on the 20th, should be enforced despite
all outside objections. The commissioner
recommended that in fu'ure divisions of
percentage on transcontinental freight- the
trunk lines should take 25 per cent., instead
of 22 per cent., as at present. All other mat-'
ters acted on were routine and the meeting
adjourned until to-morrow, when the mana
gers will meet the passenger department of
the association. In the passen.er department
meeting to-duy W. P. Johnson was elected
pe.-maneut arbitrator. A large amount of
time was consumed considering a plan for
the redemption of tickets. It was agreed that
mileage tickets purchased to test rates should
be redeemed at '1% cents per mile. The sub
ject of rates on west-bound business from
Buffalo was referred to a committee.

Special to the Globe.
Washington. Dec. 14.— N0 question has
excited so much interest since the session
opened as the Cinnabar & Clark's (Fork bill.
Everybody to-day wanted to take a hand in
the debate. Sunset Cox dropped in and urged
tbat the National park must be preserved.and
that selfish corporations were behind the bill,
to get the privilege of carrying tourists into
the park aud boardinr them in the company
hotel. Delegate Toole made an earnest speech
for toe bill, showing how much it was needed
for the mining district around Cooke City.and
Judge Payson. ot Illinois, who had the bill in
charge, advanced its passage ably. Judge
Kelley again took a hand in the fight, on the
ground that the buffalo must be preserved,
and the park was the only place to do it in.
Cox's motion to strike out the enacting clause
was carried by 107 to 05. The bill cannot be
gotten up again, and is practically dead for
all time. It passed both the house and senate
two years ago, and with some concessions in
conference, would have become a law. Mr.
Gilfillan, being a brother-in-law of C. T.
Hobart, who is deeply interested in tbe bill,
did not vote. •
Gould's Big Scheme.
■'! St. Louis, Dec. 14.— The Globe-Democrat
this morning says: Mr. Gould is now figuring
for an extension of his Missouri Pacific sys
tem, which will, when built, probably put a
new face on Southwestern railroad matters,
and will involve au entire rearrangement of
the Southwestern pool. The exteusion pro
posed is from Hannibal, Mo., in a bee line
northeast to Chicago, passing through Peoria
and Streator, a distance of 200 miles. The
facts as learned are as follows: When the
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy road acquired
the Hannibal &St. Joe. three years ago it was
agreed that the Missouri Pacific and the Chi
cago, Burlington & Quincy roads should not
build into one another's territory. In the
past year or more the Quincy people have not
held to their agreement, and have built down
into what Mr. Gould regarded as his terri
tory, and ever since doing so they have an
ticipated retaliatory action. Now it is aoout
coming. If Mr. Gould should carry out his
pian the extension will, with the Missouri,
Kansas & Texas, also form a bee line from
Chicago to Houston and Galveston.
