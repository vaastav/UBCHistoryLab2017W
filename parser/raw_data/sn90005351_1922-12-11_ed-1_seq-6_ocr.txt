the part of the jury. They leiinre
that they will carry tue caso to ihe
supreme court on exoeptions if tho
award ìp susta Ined.
I luring the fi ve wecks of the
trial the defence luwyer took 200
oxceptions to evidence which they
tiainied was int'òmpetent ami
which was adniitted over their ob
jection. The defence attorneys
also ciaim that the jury was influ
enced by the demonstration for the
lilaintiff which oceurred in the
ciurtrooin at the conclusioni of her
lawyer's final plea. At the time of
this occurrenee they petitioned for
a new trial, but were over-ruled.
N'otwithstanding the vigorous
efforts to prevent the plaintiff from
collecting the verdiet, which is the
largest ever awarded in an aliena-
tion of arfections suit, both Mrs.
Woodhouse and her uttorney,
Warren U. Austin, are confident
that the action of the jury will be
upheld even if the case goes to the
highest court in the country. The
first art on the part of the plain
tiff'. lawyer, if the verdiet is sus
tained, will be to apply for a writ
empowering him to jail the defen
flants in event of their failui-e to
puy the dama ges nssessed against
them. In behulf of his client, he
also will daini interest at six per
cent on the .4(ì5,000, as allowed by
the laws of the state.
It is the contention of Atty. Aus
tin that there is no question as to
the ability of the defe'ndants to
pay the $400,000 which the jury
awarded their son's wife for actual
dainages resulting from the loss of
his love and society, as well as the
additional $(55,000 impo.-ed as a
punishment for the "malicious
acts" "which induced him to leave
her and go to Reno to petition for
a divorce.
Lorenzo E. Woodhouse is presi
de nt of the Merchants National
!!ank of this city and is known as
the "richest man in Vermont." Be
sides an imposing residence here,
where he lives about two months a
year, he maintains a home at i-'ì.r
l'ark avenue, New York, an estate
at East Hampton, Long Island and
owns an island in Lake Champlnin
and property in Florida, aecording
to his testtmony on the witness
stand during the trial. Between
his stays at these place.s, he makes
trip to California, White Sulphur
Springs, Va., and other resorts, as
well as occasionai visits to Europe.
His "special account", investigated
during the trial, showed assets in
stocks and bonds amounting to
Sl,.ri0g,0(M.
The A-ealth of the Woodhouse
family was blamed for the shatter
ed romance between Dorrit ami
Douglas. She charged that her
father-in-law and mother-in-law
desired their son to wed a woman
with money and social position
and that they "never recognized
ber as a member of the family."
Burlington residenti of a genera
tion ago recali that Lorenzo
E. Woodhouse's parent., like
wise objected to his mar
riage to Mary Kennedy, daughter
of the agent of the Burlington tex
tilo mills, but Lorenzo refused to;
give up the girl of his choice and
eventually she was reccived into
the family circle.

Message of President
Continued from Pace One
on ali fiuestiotis of importance
have by their vote shown their
prejudices against labor.
Neither can I a gre e that having
the interstate commerce eommis
sion handle wages and working
conditions woubì solve the prob
lem, as these men are appointed to
the commission by the President
and are not practical railroad meli
and are inftuenced by politics.
In my opinon adjustment board
equally divided between railroad
nien and railroad management, as
per adjustment board, Nos. 1, 2
and 3 under government contici
of the railroad, these men to be
picked by empioyes and the man
agement, with a faw that ali de
cision mu.-t be lived up to, would
be a much better solution.
The above, with the knowledge
by the railroad management that
decisions of this board wouid be
fair and just as well as finul
would cause the railroad man
agement to settle with their own
employes on a majority of the
di.-putes without recour.-e to
the board. This would bring better
co-operution and would faclitate.
the handling of dispute, which
heretofore have taken up much
time and caused delays that hav(!
Ic-d to friction and dissenson and
ultimately precipitateti nine-tenths
of the strikes in industry.
St. Johnsbury and Newport neo
pie will al.-o be interested to hear
what Payon Smith, Ma.achu
sett commissioner of education
ha to say about President' Hard
ing' message. Dr. Smith has
spoken before packed house both
in St. Johnsbury anl in Newport.
His remarks follow:
The message in general gave me
a very favorable impression. In
particular, the straight-forward
statement on prohibition was very
much needed. The remarks on the
immigration problem are impres
sive and deal with the question in
a common sense ay, On the ques
tion of co-ordination of the rail
road, and the propoed changes in
the railroad labor board. I think
President Harding is on the right
track. As to child labor, recent
experience indicate that his rec
ommendation for constitutional
amendment shows the only way to
deal with it.
The message is a fine state
document, and puts before the
country in good pioportion the
outstanding ibuea to be met. Presi
dent Harding muft have had in
mind the Fettine forth of his views
to the entire country rather than
any hope that Congress would
take immediate action on ali the
question discussed.
A school of instruction for offi
cerà of the National Guard was
held in the Sonate chaniber of the
State House last week.
The school opened Thursday
evening in charge of Colonel John
L. Switzer and assisted by Cap
tains Fenin and Merrill. Colonel
C. MeLoughlin, senior instructor
of the National Guard of Vermont
last sumnier, and Colonel George
William in charge of the Nation
al Guard of the lst Corps area,
were also in attendunce.
Adjutant-General Herbert T.
John.-on addressed the officers at
the oneninc of the school and tolti
them of the aitns of the National
Guard. About 60 otricsrs attended
the school, among them Captai n
Herbert A. Wilcox asti lst Lieut- '
