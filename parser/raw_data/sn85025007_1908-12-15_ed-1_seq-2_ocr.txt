TUESDAY EVENING, DEC. 15, 1908,
A recent issue of the B bical Wotld,
a magazine edited by tbe religious pro?
fessors of the Chicago Unlvtr.lty School,
contains aa editorial defense of the
modern scientrfis methods of dealing
with the Bible and of extending the
gospel. It holds tbat the most effective
way ot teaeblng Ohristaoity to the
heathen is by means of a physical acd
electrical laboratory, and tbat to tbiok
eolenlihcally in ooe chamber of tbe mind
wbile bowing to authority la another is
"to make one's life an internal contra?
diction and one's progress bei-tatlcg
ead ineffective." Nevertheless,!! says tba'.
"the scientific spirit has gone on Its
victorious way" nod that more and m re
teachers of Christ aoity ure finding tbst
"neither truth nor life has anything to
fear, but everything to gain, from the
most searching investigation, and tbe
most resolute thinking find warrant ad
courage for such thinking and for
courageous doing." I' decVestbat sci?
ence ba* become the a'ly of the religion
of Christ, and looks for the day "when
the church will be no longer joined in
unholy alliance with ignorance, but all
the forcea tbat make for intelligence
ahall be arrayed on the tide of the re?
ligion of Jesus "
In answer to several inquiries it U

Unpsid lor three years, the tax must be
collected by due process from all against
whom it is swated, whether veterans or

Anot' *r Mer sage
Washington, jc 15.?The following
is a synopsis ol spec.a message aent to
Congress by tbe president today :
In language probably more emphati?
cally denunciate r/ than was ever used
before in such a document, President
Roosevelt today in a special message to
Congreaa, anaigned Joseph Pulitzer, of
the New York World, in particular and
other critics cf theadministration in gen?
eral, for their recent charges with re?
spect to the purchase ol tbe Panama
canal.
He characterizes tbe accusations as
scurrilous, libelous and false, lu every
essential particular; submits documen?
tary evidence to support his contentions;
brands Mr. Pulitzer by rame as a villi
fj-r o' t_e Ami rita i people and declare,
his purpose of bringing a governmental
action for libel.
The message in part, reads as follows:
"In view of the constant reiteration
of the association that lhere was some
corrupt action by, or on behalf of the
United States government in coonee
ion with tba acquisition of the title
of the French Company to the Pan?
ama canal aod of tbe repetition of
the atc ry that a syndicate of Amer?
ican citizens owned either one or
both of the Pacama companies, I deem
it wise to Bobrnit lo tbe Congress all tbe
information I have on tbe subject. These
-tories were first brought to my atten?
tion as published ina paper in Indianap?
olis, called 'The News,' edited by Mr.
Delavan Smith. The stories were scur?
rilous and libelous ia cbn-acter, and
fa si- in every essential particular. Mr.
Smith shelters himself behind the ex?
cuse that ho merely accepted the state?
ments which bsd appeared in a taper
published in New York, 'The World,'
owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It ia
idle to say that the known char-e'er of
Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are.
such tlht the statements in tbat paper
will be believed by nobody. I therefore
lay al! the i*tt< before you.''
Here the president recites tbe various
charges including those sg"'_.rt Obarles
P. Taft, brother of William Howard
Taft, and Douglas Robinson, fbe presi?
dent's brother-in-law, of participation
! in the $40,000,000 purchase fund aod
proceeds.
"These statements sometimes appear?
ed in the editorials, sometimes in the
news columns, sometimes in the shape
of contributions from Individuals, either
unknown, or known to be of bad
character. They sre false in every partic?
ular from tenoning toend. The wicked?
ness of tbe slanders is only sop assed by
their fatuity. Ho utterly baseless are
tbe stories, tbat apparently tbey repre?
sent in part merely material collected
fr campaign purposes, and in part
stories originally concocted with a view
jf possible black mail. The inventor of
tas story about Mr. Charles P. Taft, for
instance, evidently supposed tbat at
some period of tbe Pacama purchase, Mr,
Vf. H, Taft wa. secretary of war,
whereas, in reality, Mr. W. H.
Taft never became secretary of war
until long after the whole transaction in
question bad been closed. The inventor
of the story about Mr. Douglas Robin
son bsd not taken the trouble to find
out the fact tbat Mr. Robinson bad not
the slightest connection, directly or indi?
rectly, of any kind or sort, witb any phase
of ihe Pacarra Iramaction, from begin?
ning to end. Now.thess storieSjSS a matter
of fact, need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of proof has been, or can be,
produced in behalf of any of them.
They consist simply of a string of in?
famous libels. In form they are in part
libels upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft
and Mr. Robinson, for instance. P> it
they are in fact wholly, and in form
tartly, a libel upon the United States
government. I do not believe we should
concern ourselves with the particular
individuals who wrote the lying and
libelous editorials, articles from corre?
spondents or aiticles in tbe news columns.
The real t Hander is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer,
editor and proprietor of tbe W .ri I.
While the criminal uflense of which Mr.
Pulitz-r has bean guilty is in form a
lir-el upon individual., the great ii jury
done ia in blackeoiug tbe good rame bi
the Americto people. It should not be
left to a private citizen to sue Mr. Pu?
litzer for libel. He should be prosecuted
for libel by tbe governmental authori?
ties. In point'of encouragement of in
quity, in point of infamy, or wrong?
doing, there is nothing to choose between
s public servant who betiays his trust, a
public servsnt who is guilty of blsck
mail, cr theft, or financial dishonesty of
a y kind, and a man guilty as Mr.
PalltZ-T bsa beet guilty in this instance,
It is therefore a high nstiooal duty to
to bring justice this vilifier ol the Amer?
ican people, this man who wantonly and
wick-dly and without one sbalow of
justification aeeks to blacken the char?
acter of the reputable private citizen*,
and to convict tbe government of his
own country in the eyes of the civilized
world of wrong doing of the basest and
foulest kind when he has not one shadow
of justification of any sort or descrip?
tion for tbe charge be hss msde. Tue
attorney geoeral has under considera?
tion tbe form in wbich the proceedings
against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought."

the hope of arranging a diplomatic al?
liance whereby Germany will support
Venezuela in her numerous international
entanglements in return for such val?
uable concessions in Venezuela thst
Germany woold easily become tbe domi?
nating influence in Venezuela's com?
merce. That Castro will lay these pro?
posals definitely before the German for?
eign office was admitted today hy a mem?
ber of tbe foreign office. Whether Ger?
many will go ag far as Venezuela desires
in thia matter is doubted, but from the
cordiality of the noes exebanged be?
tween Castro and tbe kaiser tbe belief
hss sprung that if Oaatro offers enough
in tbe way of tiade concessions, Ger?
many will do all (tat she can without
actually impairing her international re?
lations to help Oaatro.
Emperor Will'am today seot a tele?
gram of welcome to Castro. The kaiser

Nothing but reassuring notea are given to

the mask must Boon be thrown of and the f.ct
that a grievously ill man is upon the throne
of Rnglaud be recognized. Ths king himself
realizes thc gravity of hi. Hines* aa ia shown
by the fa< t that he is rapidly unloading mar y
ot hil governmental responsibilities to the
shoulders of the Piince of Wales. The most
alarming feature of the king's illness, ia ti
ruipi anance, of ths sympt ina that pre<v!c'i
