the Utah Public Health association
shall jointly decide. Part of it will
doubtless go to uc maintenance of
Ogden's share of the Utah Public
Health association. It is intended to
expend much of it in the employing of
a competent health worker for the Og
den community. This raised the ques
tion as to the real need for such a
health worker.
The Red Cross Christmas stamp has
been used for the purpose of raising
the expense for the American anti-tuberculosis
work.
It may bo of interest to the people of
Ogden to know that Wyoming last year
won the honor of selling the largest
number of Red Cross stamps in pro
portion to the stale population. The
people of that state purchased two and
two-thirds stamps to each inhabitant.
Utah last year bought less than one
stamp to each person. Of all the cities'
with a population of more than COO, the
town of Thornburg led the nation, sell
ing more than thirty seals per inhabi
tant. '

POSTOFFICE RECEIPTS
UREASES SORING
NUMBER
As proof positive that Ogden's busi
ness is on the increase, the receipts at
the postoffico for November exceeded
the same period last year by $5,268-29.
According to the report- just com
piled by Rufus A, Garner, assistant
postmaster, the receipts for November,
1917, totaled $16,059.56. During Novem
ber, 1916, the total was $11,391.27.
The increase Is partially explained
by the war revenue measure boosting
postal rates from 2 to 3 cents on first
class mail matter and corresponding
Increases on other classes of mail.
With that increase taken into consid
eration, the receipts for November this
year aro approximately $1500 in ex
cess of the same month last year.

Commissioner Chris Flygare stated
today that the leakage in the reservoir
which has been disturbing the peace
and quiet and customs and habits of
residents In the eastern part of town,
Is in process of repair. The affected
district lies between Fillmore and Polk
and Twenty-Second and Twenty-third
streets.
The commissioner stated that a
drain owA be constructed, leading
from Twenty-third street north, which
would take care of the overflow. A
complaint was made against conditions
in that section by those suffering from
the leaking water. The roads, it was
stated, had become practiaclly impass
able and basements and cellars were
fining with water.
THRIFT STAMPS iT
BEING PURCHASED
EXTENSIVELY
"Ogden Is not making the showing In
the purchase of thrift stamps that tho
size and the average wealth of tho
community warrants. The wage earn
ers are not taking the hoped-for Inter
est." That was the statement of Post
master W W. Browning this morning.
According to the postmaster, the
sales of thrift stamps have been too
small to announce totals. They were
placed on Bale Monday. The thrift
stamps may be purchased for 25 cents
each and later exchanged for a $5 war
certificate.
"In other cities they stand in lines
at the postofllce windows in order to
buy these stamaps and certificates," he
continued. "The only explanation I
can make of the lethargy that nrevalls
jn Ogden is that the details of the
transaction are unknown, and, also,
there Is a tendency on the part of the
citizens of Ogden to stand aside and
let the men of wealth take the lead.
As a matter of fact, this Is an oppor-.
tunity for the wage earner, the school
children and all classes of people
While other communities of less aver
age wealth are running out supplies,
this office is wondering why more are
not sold."
The thrift stamps, costing 25 cents
each, do not bear interest, but sixteen
stamps, representing a total of $4, with
a cash payment of from 12 to 23 cents
may be exchanged for a $5 certificate.
The certificates bear Interest. No one
pprson Is permitted to purchase more
than $1000 worth of certificates. Bank
ers throughout the country pronounce
the purchase of certificates as good in
vestment as government bonds. Tho
purchase of the war stamps, it is de
clared, will develop thrift and economy
and promote a tendency among the
younger Investors to save and Invest
their money.
JOIflV W. MOflEY OF THE
REO CROSS HERE
FRIDAY NIGHT
Friday night the workers and all
those interested in Red Cross work
will have the opportunity of meeting

It is hoped that as many as are In
terested In the Rod Cross work in any
of its departments will make an es
pecial effort to attend this meeting
and become better acquainted with tho
work. The chairman and members of
the various committees aro especially
asked to make it a point to be pres
ent. Mr. Morey and his party are making
a lour across Utah, getting in touch
with tho needs aud conditions of the
chapters in Utah. They will visit the
Provo, Salt Lake, Ogden and Logan
chapters in this state.
The work in the local cbnpter is be
ing subdivided as rapidly as possible.

chapters In most of the towns of the
county in the near future. Last week

gare visited Coalville and Morgan and
perfected the plans for the work in
thoso towns.
The two new rooms In the local
headquarters are being fitted up this

London Papers Give Fullest
Prominence to U. S. Presi
dent's Address to Congress.
TOO LATE FOR RUSSIA
No Half-tones, Ambiguous!
Phrases or Hints of Com
promise to Pacifists. ,
LONDON, Dec. 5. President Wil
son's message to congress has the full
est possible prominence in the morn
ing newspapers but it reached London
too late for much considered comment.
The Daily News receives warmly tho
president's1 declaration that peace
should be based on generosity and jus
tice to the exclusion of selfish claims.
It adds:
"It would be affection to protend that
this language echoes the declarations
of the European spokesmen of the Al
liance. II is the voice of a statesman
whose vision comprehends the world,
while theirs comprehends only half a
world.
Too Late to Impress Russia
"If President Wilson could have said
earljer what he said yesterday and if
in Great Britain, France and Italy the
responsible leaders had made his lan
guage their own, Russia might be to
day driving the enemies from her bor
ders. .It may be too late to convince
Russia of the identity of aim of her
self and the Allied democracies, but it
must not be loo late for thoso democ
racies to learn from their greatest rep
resentative how democracies should
comport themselves in war and how
they should attain peace.
"In the light of President Wilson's
speech, a statement that will mean
wiping off the slate of much that never
should have been written on its is im
perative. There is no kinship In the
spirit of yesterday's message and the
spirit of knockout blows or economic
warfare or after-the-war boycotts."
No Half Tones In Address
The Times says there are no half
tones in the president's address, add
ing: "There are no ambiguous phrases on
which militarists may feed the illu
sions of their dupes, no hints of com
promise and no suggestion of falter
ing or doubt to raise the spirits of tho
pacifist with this straightforward
and logical statement of America's war
aims the last hope of tho pacifists must
founder"
Tho Times reiterates that formerly
it expressed dissent with President
Wilson's distinction h.etween the Ger
man people and their ruler and says it
can no moro distinguish between them
than the president can any longer dis
tinguish between Germany and Austria-Hungary
believing them willing
accomplices of thoir ruler.

imity. America was represented at the
conference and there follows that the
war aims of the Allies no longer can
be described in anv sense as militaris
tic." None of the editors dwells especially
on the request for a declaration of war
against Austria-Hungary, but brief
references imply that it Is logical and
desirable.
RATMOM ENDORSES
WILSON'S MESSAGE
CHICAGO, Dec. 4 Vigorous appro
val of President Wilson's demand for
a declaration of war upon Austria was
expressed here today by John R. Rath
om, editor of the Providence (R. I.)
Journal, in an address.
"The gravest question that confronts
this country la the settlement of our
relations with the allies of Germany,"
he said. "Until that declaration is
made, this country is absolutely pow
erless to prevent the constant and in
creasing activities of propagandists
who are blowing up our factories, mur
dering our innocent working people,
setting fire to our ships and docks,
poisoning our cattle and doing every
thing they can to paralyze our fight
ing arm. The president's demand for
war with Austria must meet with an
immediate response."
The speaker severely criticised
United Stales Senator Hitchcock of
Nebraska for a letter saying war with
Austria was not necessary now.
