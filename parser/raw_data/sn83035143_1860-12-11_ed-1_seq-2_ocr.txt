Capture of a Slaver.
The U. S, ship Constellation, on the 25th
of September, captured the bark Cora eff the
Congo Kirer, African coast, with 705 slaves
on board. The Cora was a fine resesl of 431
tons register, bailt in Baltimore in 1851.
She was for a time ei,;aged in tbe South
Ameriean trade, and on the 4th ol May last
a register was taken out at the New York
Custom House for John Latham, as master
and owner. The bark, in her fitting out,
took on board such suspicious quantities of
lumber, water and provisions, that she was
arrested as being- about to engage In TJit
slave trade, and was bonded to the amount
of $22,128 23. On the "27th of May she
was re cleared aDd proceeded on her "trading
voyage." The next wa hear of her, she is
captured by the Constellation. She was sent
to Monrovia, where the slaves will be landed,
alter which the vessel w ill be sent to Xor-
foik. : ' '
The Border Slave States.
At the great anti-secession meeting
at Vicksburg tew days since, Ex-Got.
Morehead, of Kentucky, made a speech
from which we extract the following para
graph. It is important, as showing the views
of an able mind upon the destiny of the border
Slave States, in case of secession: ,
"We have a right to demand such con
cessions of the North as will restore us peace

This is undoubtedly a great and glorious

the following paragraphs from a Texas Dem

There is one fact which would do much to
reconcile us to secession, if it should come to
that. The Cotton States, as a eeperate con
federacy, would become, on a small scale, a
foreign power, and as such, would not dare
treat Northern citizens with ench barbarity
as the above, unless the Government of the
Northern States should happen to be in the
hands of a doughface Democracy, which we
do not appreiiend will ever be the case.. :
How Kansas Reports are Manufactured.
writing from the camp of Gen. Frost's
expedition, gives an inkling of the manner in
, which the reporta of Montgomery s "atroci
ties" are manufactured :
"No one in this part of the community
seems to' jusiify iMootfromcry, yet any wha
say the least thing in his favor are suspected
at once of being spies. Resolutions "were
passed in Clinton to arrest any tnan W jo came
from the territory that said there was o
trouble, and hold him in jail until he proved
'sw he had no connection with Montgomery.

Of ail the . unfounded humbugs ever in
vented, none has been more thoroughly ex
posed, than the late Kansas Wai. Judge W Lil
lian) a, who' started the rumors of the mur
ders and raids of Montgomery, has been
shown to be a miserable Imbecile, whose hon
or, if he ever had any,has long since departed
and left him a trembling old dotard. He
fled from the scene of his official (?) labors at
the first rumor of possible disturbance, . and
has the honor of being universally contemned
and ridiculed for his childish fright. , AH
other reports tending to implicate Montgom
ery have also been shown to be base false
hoods, aid now the final and complete over
throw of the invasion humbug is given jn

Gen. Snyder of the Missouri militia, to the
St. Louis Republican, the pro-slavery organ
of the State: '
BOLIVAR, Mo., Dec. 3, 1860.
Ma. Editor: Before this reaches yon tbe
majority of your readers will have ascer
tained that the "invasion of tbe State by
Montgomery, , which caused so much excite
ment, was, so far as the "invasion" is con
cerned, the merest piece of Manchausenism,
witnout anv foundation in truth. ' How the
am that Jim Montgomery and his eaug of
horse-thieves had "taken Fort Scott," coald
.cause any excitement in the State of Mis
souri, is a mystery; for every one knows
that he has had Fort Scott and all of South
ern Kansas for the last three years. Taa hare
pernaps learned by this time that the "three
hundred", armed outlawt who "invaded the
State," "took Fort Scott," and "broke up the
unitea stales District Court," have dwindled
down to certain threat! of Montgomery's and
Jennison's, and about tatern vagabond Abo
litionists who lurked about Fort Scott for a
few days before the Court vat to have been
held. . ;.,., . .
It is true that Montgomery is an anti-sla
very fanatic, of the John Brown school, and
that he has been to the North recently, and
returned with arms of different kinds. -It is
true that he baa distributed those arms to
about two hundred of his raezed followers.

that Jcnnison has made certain declarations

and the advantages and disadvantages of dis
union. We make one or two extracts :
"I need not assure you that whenever the
time shall come when we must choose be

Death of Delazon Smith.
TUa New York World of Saturday contains
the fbllaKing notice of the death of Hon.
De'aaon r HiHb: ' .
By the late arrival from the'Pacific States,
we have intelligence of the death of Delazon
Smith, better known as Delusion" Smith,
. S. Senator from Oregon for a single lea
rn. '
Mr. Smith was educated at Oberliu, Ohio',
by some benevolent ladies, wbo saw in him
young man of good natural abilities, but
quite poor. They intended him for the
ministry; but Mr. S. took the liberty of quar
relling with his alma mater, and was dis
missed. Leaving Oberlin, he went to Rochseter, in
this State; and started a paper, sot particu
larly celebrated fbr its adherence to orthodox
notions; in fact, the sheet was called "infidel.
This enterprise fell dead in a short time.
Yi bile there he bad a public discussion witn
motbodist minister on infidelity, in which
he distinguished himself for irreverence more
than for argumeut. , Tad took place about
twenty years ago. He soon after obtained
the appointment of consul to some obscure
South American town from Mr. Tyler, whose
policy be had supported and defended in a
daily journal, at no little cost to himself. He
is said to have held his commission and drawn
his pay for Bix years after the government
ceased to know bis whereabouts. In I860
he appeared upon tbe stage of political affairs
in Oregon, and succeeded In getting elected
to the Senate, for the short term, from that
State. Latterly he published a sheet not so
remarkable for tbe elegance of diction or pu
rity of style as for its vigorous personalities.
Delazon Smith was well known in Lis
section. After be left Rochester be was for
some time in the office of Dr. Underbill, and
assisted him in the conduct of the "Cleveland
Liberalist," an infidel paper. He published
a pamphlet entitled "Oberlin Unmasked,
which had a large run, owing to the reeling
prevalent against Oberlin during its early
history. During his disappearance from offi
cial view, as above noted, the' enquiry
"Where is Delaton Smith," was almost as
famous as "Who struck Billy Patterson."
Mr. Smith was a man of considerable talent,
which was, however, flighty and misdirected.

For the Leader.
The President's Message.
The President says, the long continued
intemperate interference of the Northern
people with the question of Slavery in the
Southern States has at lengh produced its
natural effects; that this agitation has been
kept up for twenty-five years by the public
press, by the proceedings of State and Coun
ty Conventions, and by abolition sermons,
Ac, and has resulted in producing a malign
influence on the minds of the slaves, inspir
b g them with vague notions of freedom,and
thereby causing serious alarm to their mas
ters. '
The intemperance and agitation to which
the President refers, and to which he objects,
relate only to discussions touching the moral
aspects and bearings of slavery. These dis
cussions are important to the right or trron
of an institution all-controlling in nearly one
half of the States ot the Cniou where it ex
ists, and which seeks to wield the powers of
the Federal Government for its maintenance
and existence. MK Buchanan would have
the people of the Free States smother the no
bler instincts of their nature, turn a deaf ear
to the teachings of Christianity,of the Revo
lution, and surrender the freedom of speech
and of the press, lest the arraigning of slave
holding as a sin against God and a crime
against man, and the dissemination of light
and truth on the subject, may alarm the mas
ter and encourage the slave.
If slavery asks to live in a Republican
Government, it must, like any other institu
tution in a free country, be snbmitted to the
ordeal of free discussion ; and, if it quails
under the truth and the light, it must go
down. The question of when, or how, is for
tlit partes concerned to say. It would be
be strange if it should die without a struggle.
lliat it is tbe moral agitation ot we
subject that the President objects to, is evi
dent, from tbe fact, that he admits that no
act, except the Missouri Compromise (and
that has been repealed by the South) has
been passed by Congress impairing in the
slightest degree the rights of the South to
their property in slaves, and in his opinion no
such act will be passed. He says Congress
has not passed, k he thinks, will not pass any
act excluding slavery' from th-Territories,
that the Supreme Court, has,, decided that
laves are property, and that owners may
take them to tne Territories under the Con
stitution; and further, tht the Fugive Slave
!aw his been carried into execution in every
contested case since the commencement of his
Administration, Personal Liberty Bills not
withstanding. . , , ...
Thus far, by the president 't own Bhowing,
the Legi&lattve, the Judicial, and tbe Execu
tive Departments of the Government have
sustained the demands of the slaveholders, ea
that the evils complained of do not result
from political agitation, or political action.
As well iniht .taa President or the Slave
Power attempt to suspend, the laws of gravi
tation, a attempt to create or annihilate mat
ter as to attempt, through the Federal Gov
ernment,1 by the cry of "dissolve the Union,
oi by any other means to suppress the utter
ance, by the people of the Free States, ol their
deep and earnest convictions against that
system of barbarism, which has been done
away throughout nearly the entire world,
Heathen and Christian, . save in free -and.
Christian America. -i -
. Men are tannted and insulted when, told
that they live under a Republican Govern
ment, and enjoy free institutions, and at tbe
same time, are denied free thought and free
speech. . . , -1 !..-- il
According to Mr. Buchanan's version of
this question (and no one will suspect nim ot
undue bias towards "the J orth,) we see that
no real grounds exist, either for secession by
the South, or concession by the North. Tbe
South has nothing -to demand. The-North
has nothing to concede but principle and
right.
' Let not the hue and cry of dissolution,
money panic,nor tbe threaied horrors of civ
il war, frighten the republicans into any com
promises of freedom for the sakecf peace.
If the crisis must come, let it come now ; to
postpone it by compromise is only to aggra
vate tbe evil. . Let ilr. Lincoln adnere con
seientiously and firmly to the Constitution in
all its pro visions, and let the strain come. If
the Constitution is good for nothing for free
dom, it is good for nothing at all. To desert
it, or compromise one iota of its provisions
for liberty, is treason, which Mr. Lincoln's
S.
Mr. Burch's Attorney.
The Chicago correspondent of the Boston
Transcript relates the following anecdotes of
Mr. Burch's leading attorney:
Van Arman, the leading counselor for Mr.
Burch is a man of rare ability. He is the
mntleman who, a few years ago, cleared at
DetroU a won.au on iruw wr iue mux ucr ui
her husband. It was charged that she ad'
ministered poison in email cakes, three of
which he ato daring nis speecn. it is sam
that tbe jurors were not fairly in their room
before he rushed out of the building and
threw from his stomach the poison. He knew
that while a small dose would kill, a large
dose would act as an emetic. Mr, an Ar
man was counsel in the case of Jumpertz,for
the murder of his mistress. - Though Jomp
trtz was poor and without friends. Van Ar
man devoted himself to the defence with un
tiring energy and at a cost to himself of many
hundred dollars. Jamperti was condemned.
Van Annan moved for anew trial,which was
ordered alter tne gallows had been construct
ed for the execution, and in sight of the con
demned man. At the trial Jumpertz was ac
Quitted. Eon. Mr. Osgood,- a lawyer of
treat talent, is associated with Van Arman.
