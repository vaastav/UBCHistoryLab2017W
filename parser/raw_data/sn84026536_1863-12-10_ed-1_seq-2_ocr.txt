From te Hw Herald, Hit. 7
Mr. John Mofltt, atd old resident of this city, and
well kjiowo b11 over tbe United States as tbe inventor
or patentee ut McfUtt's Life Pills and Ptceiix Bitters,
died yerterday at the ripe age cf seventy-six. Mr. Mof
fatt commeLced business in this city as a dry goods mer
chant, bat Jailed, with very large liabilities. I hia was
sorfe twenty five or thirty years ago. After being cot
of buaineas for a year or two, and io great pecaaiary
straits, same medical acquaintance of his saggested that
he should go into the patent medicine business, and that
he would set him going at it by some simple prescriptions.-
This was the origin of alcfl-ut's Life Pills and
Pbcenix Bitters. .
He got a little store is Hudson street; employed at
first one woman in workicg up and packing the pills,
while his son William B. Mcffatt, was engsged atter
school hours, in distributing business circulars
through tb? city. The Bon graduated in medicine, and,
after a residence in Europe, returned to this city and
entered actively into his father's business. About this
time the former cxeditorg ol Mr. Mcnut oegan to dis
cover that he was making some money ; and be in order
to evade their importunities, transferred tbe business to
the son, and in course of years it produced an immense
income. The proits were principally invested iu real
estate on Broadway and other streets, so that with the
rapid rise io tbe value cf such property, Wo. B. Mcffitt
ranked as a millionaire. The time came, however, when
the father and son disagreed. ' This was when tbe lat
ter, who had ben unmarried till about m'idte life, re
solved to take a wi e. Tbe father called upon him for
a division of tbe property on the groan 3 that they had
been partners in business all tho time.
The son denied this, and urged that be had already
amnlv provided for all the members of his family, iiut
a suit was commenced, and was tried cone six ysars ago
to compel the son to accorct with ti l father. The lat
ter claimed that an the occasion of tbe son's leaving for
Enrop8 some years before there bad been prepared and
duly executed a deed of partnership, which paper had
subsequently fal.'en into the bands of the son and been
destroyed. This was totally dented on the son's part
and finally tbe decision was agaiast the father. The
case went up to a higher court, and was in process of
litigation when the son died, a. little over a year sgo,
and now the father having followed him, the case has
been fully removed to the highest of all tribunals.
Thus have tbe life pills been swallowed np in death and
the rheoenix bitters await a resurrection.

The rebel steamer Banshee was captured on the 17th
November, with a valuable cargo, while on. her way
from Nassau to Wilmington. She arrived at New
York on the 23d. We have already published an ac
count of her narrow escape not long since, while run
ning tbe gauntlet into Wilmington. A Washington
telegram, describing the Banshee, says :
According to the information in the posses iion of the
Navy Department, tbe stearaej Banshee recently cap
tared, was built io tbe yard of Jones, Qutgan & Co.,
of Liverpool, and was launched in the latter part of
November, 1862. one is a paddle-wheel steamer, and
is called a steel boat, tbe plates used in her construction
being of steel, thro fourths of an inch in thickcees,
and said to be equal to iron plates an inch thick.
She is 220 ftet long, 20 feet beam, and 12 feet deep.
Her bottom is flat, and the keel is divided into four
water-tight compartmcats. Her engines are oscillating,
of 120 horse power; and si constructed as to be under
the deck. When fully loaded she draws only eight feet
of water.
Ihi Duty mt (It Hoar.
Never before, in tbe hhtory of the present revolution,
says the Atlanta Confederacy, have tbe affairs of tbe
Confederacy assumed a more critical condition. ' Oar
army retretirg before a eaperior force of the invader,
from the Tennessee ; the enemy making demonstrations
across the rapidan ; the immediate exertions of the
Federal Fleet toward the reduction of Charleston ;
another fierce battle imminent around Knoxville ; tbe
seizing cf tbe Confederate rsms in Europe ail alike
conspire to make ns ftel for the time somewhat dis
couraged. But our trials have not yet reached their
climax. We have not all yet begun to feel the severi
ties and trouble incident to hostile invasion. We are
by no means such martyrs to Liberty's -cause as the
first American revolution produced, and we fear many
of U3 will never become such anseifishpatriots. We
mast be prepared to expect reverses. We must cease
to be sunshine patriots, and learn to welcome clouds as
well as fair weather, and to free ourselves from tyranny,
at alliiazards and to the last extremity. Now is the
time for men to prove themselves. The hour is at
hand when the courage, patriotism and the souls of
men are to be tested. The united endeavors of a united
South put forth io oae mighty effort more, would bear
us swiftly, safely over the breakers, and the ordeal is
passed. Kvery man must to the field whose hand is
strong enough to pull the trigger upon the invader of
his home. The present armies of the Confederacy are
but a trifle in number of its arms-bearing population.
In the name of Southern chivalry, and for the honor of
the South, let not a few brave men be borne down by
hirelings, for the lack of reinforcements.
Thk Necao and the Wa-The Charleston Cou
rier justly say6:
We have passed through three eventfull months since
Gen. Qaincy Adams Qiltaore threw his first shell at the
city ot Charleston, exciting the fiendish hopes of Ynn-
keedom. General Qillmore's shells, in all, from the
22d August to thi3 date, have killed one poor negro
woman a striking illustration of the assertion which
nas been made and amply verified that the negro eut
fers first and wot st under all the experiments of tbe
Yankees. N o class in America has hitherto felt this
cruel and causeless war less than the servants of tbe
South, and none are feeling it more than the helpless
and deluded free negroes of the North. From tbe day
when Abolitionism began its tempering and tinkering
by tbe bold and reckless assertion that slavery was a
sin according to the Bible, to the present hour, every
attempt and effort made by ths so-called friends and
assuming champions of tbe negro have only tended to
bis injury and have only increased the incidental and
otherwise curable evils of servitude. What if the
Yankees take and ocaupy Lookout Mountain ? The
sacred code which guarantees and recognises tbe rights
of the south in tbe interests and institution which now
excite against her the hungry, howling horde of Yankee
miscreants, was uttered, not from "Lookout," but from
Mount Sinai. Will tbe Yankees scale that?
Gtn. Bragg Wfcst hi tblnlc of him bow.
We are advised by telegraph that Geo. Bragg, at
his own aolicitatiOD, has been permitttd to transfer the
conmard of the army of Tennessee to Gen. Hardee.
We will not state to tbe rcadeis ol the Keg:ster that
we regret this thanse. Oar personal interests acd ne
cessities have caused ns to watch cfesely and study
thoroughly the corduct of Gen. Bragg, acd it men
unskilledjn the art ot war are capable of appreciating
military excellence, if we have read history to any pur
pose, and have not in vain contrasted his conduct with
that of men who have led tbe weaker agaio?t stronger
armies, we are compelled to say that we regret tbe
necessity for the above announcement.
Oa former occasions ueu.Uragg nas eoogui uuc
relieved of duties which must have taxed his energies
to a degree that we have deemed insufferable, lie un
dertook" the transformation of the militia of tbe Con
federate States into an army of the Confederate States.
He sought to make soldiers veritable soldiers of self
willed citizens. To fail ia. this wps to insure, disaster
aDd defeat. No one denies this now. The difference
between a citizen soWiery and a disciplined army is at
'ength so thoroughly appreciated that ot.e of Bragg's
veterans wa... along our streets with an air f con
scions superiority over these who, twelve months ago
were his equals.
Iu accomplishing this ta3k Gen. Bragg first incurred
the displeasure of his troops, We all remember the
publie and private assaults made upon bim coon after
bis assumption of the command of the army at Tupelo.
Later, there appeared upon the military stage magnifi
cent actors ready and willing to tnppl nt him. They
hed friends throughout tbe South, and these caught up
the echo of dissatipf action in the raok3 and sought to
popularize it. When the greai mass of ti e soldiers
were at length content and preferred Bragg, es we be
lieve they do at this very hour, to any other, chieftain,
the outcry against him in the interior had reached its
height.
On three several occasions, at leas-, Gen. Bragg has
been fodaced by this clamor to esk the President to
relieve him. With all bis devotion to the code and
rules of military life, he has not been oblivious of his
duties as a citizen of - a republican government, and
hence has manifested, &3 we believe, then and now, an
unwise respect for the supposed but unreal popular
wish. If Gen! Bragg Las ever takeo a false step, he
has now made it. 'i be country cannot blame bim,
since the supposed exponents of tbe opinions of bis
countrymen have induced him to the adoption of this
measure. But if we could believe him capable of an
act of cowardice-, we would on this occasion, as could
have been done on no other in all his history, rr .ke the
charge.
But this is eimply impossible. From tbe day that
the honest old veteran Zachary Taylor, declared, over
his official signature, that be owed the victory at Buena
Vista to the steadfast coarage of Braxton Bragg, we
have deemed every man stultified who has sought to
question Bragg '6 coarago. When Le hed the haraihood
to retreat at Murfressboro, and again to sacrifice him
self in order to cave a little army when we saw how
in his official reports he ecrcenc i officers who before and
alterwarda sought to stab his reputation when by the
examination ot official papers, many of which Lave not
yet been given to the. p'ublic, we became cognizmt cf
these facts we asserted, as we do to-day, in the face of
the late disaster at Chattanooga, that history, if it-can
tell the truth, will assign Gin. Bragg. as proud a posi
tion afi that now occupied in the popular estimation by
Lee and Beauregard.
Within twelve months from to day, wuen fact -after
fact is developed and troth assumes the place of passion
and prejudice, the country will award the lull measure
of justice to the bravest, most sleepiess, tireless atd
sell-sacrificing Geieral who has led an army in all this
terrible war. We have no inducement, at this moment,
to speak thus of an officer whom we have never seen,

welfare of its traducers. " l o make all oat ol the liov-

makers and the tanners, that, the government pcrmit-

for corn, giving 1 lb. of blue stone for one buehei of corn
The government assented. Most of the farmers were
glad to avail themselves of the arrangement, ar.d laid
in as much blue stone as taey would Leed. bom
others, howaver, exchanged all their spare corn for the
mineral, canvassed the country, and bought up more
corn for eight and ten dollars a bushel, exchanged it

Orders, 2s o. 4.5, ci u eDruary zu, ieo, iu cahwiuc nuu
report the iacts and' circumstances attending the cap
tnra of the citv of New Orleans by the enemy, in
Aprils 1862, and the defence of the city by the Confed- j
erate troops under command of Mej Gen. Mansfield j
Lovell, together with thtir opinion thereon ; and the j
court having discharged the duty assigned, them, their j
opinion id published for the beneht ct aii-wnom it may
concern : - '
II. Opinion of thk Court.
The court having maturely considered the evidence
adduced, submit the following
opinion :
1. As against a land attack by any lorcethe enemy
could probably bring, the interior line of fortifications,
as adopted and completed by Maj. Gen. Lovell, was a
sufficient defence of tbe city of New Orleans ; but his
ability to bold that line against such an attack was
greatly impaiied bythe withdrawal frora him, by su
perior authority, of nearly all bis effective troops.
2. The i xtendr line, as adopted and improved by him,
was well devised, and rendered os strong as the means
of Lis command allowed.
3. Until the iron-clad gun-boats Louisiana and
Mississippi should be ready for service, it was indis
rensablv necessarv to obstruct the navigation of the
Mississippi River between Forts -Jackson ard St.
Phillip. The raft completed under Gen. Lovelj's di
rection was ad;quate for the purpose while in poeitior;
but it was swept away, and left the river unimpeded,
either by reason of soms error in its construction, or
neglect in preventing t-e accnnnlatiou ofdrft, or be
cause of insuperable mechanical difficulties, as to which
this court feels unprepared to give an opinion. Gen.
Lovell ccnimuniciued to the Government no opinion as
to tbe insecurity of the raft, nor cny apprehension that
ft might bs swept away, nor did he immediately make
known that fact when it occurred. In this it is con
sidered that he was remiss in his duty.
4t. When the raft was swept away, Gen. Lovell, with
groat energy, immediately endeavored to ieplace it, and
partially succeeded ; but without fault on lais part, this
last obstruction was broken by the care!es3DC-S3 of ves
sels cf the "river defence fleet" colliding with it, and by
fire rafts drifting "against it, and by the failure of the
guard boat3 to pro ect it against night, expeditions of
the enemy.
5. The non completion of the iron-clad gan-boafs
Louisiana and Mississippi made it imj ossible for the
navy to co-operate efficiently with Gen. Lovell.
G. The so called river deience fleet was wholly cac-Ics-csa
means of resistance to the "enemy, for which
Gen. Lovell was in no wise responsible.
7. Unc'cr the existing circumstances," the passage of
the forts by the enemy's fleet could not have been pre
vented by"Geucrd Lovell with any means und-r "his
control ; and the farts beiru passed, the fall of New Or
leans was, inevitable, aad its .evacuation a military ue
cessiiy. 8. When tha first ruft was broken, and the danger
of New Orleans thus becumo imminent-, all neceesary
preparation should have bten made for removing the
public property ane! private property available for mil
itary uses ; and whrn. the second obstruction was swept
away, tbe removal of such propeity should have been
commenced immediately. Tho failure to take these
timely steps caused the leases ef property that occur
red ; but there was comparatively bao little property
lost for which Gen. Lovfcll was responsible.
9. T.e failare of Gtn. Lovell to give1 proper ordets
to Brig. Geo. M. L Smith for the retirement of his
command from Ohalmette ia not suffijicntly explained,
and is, therefore, regarded es a serious error.
10. The proposition of Gen. Lovell to return to New
Orleans with his command was not demanded by bis
duty as a soldier, involving as it did the useless sacri
fice of himself acd his troops, though it explains i'self
upon tbe ground of sympathy for the popaialioa and
a natural sensitiveness to their reproaches.
11. Gen. Lovell displayed great energy and au un
tirirg industry in performing his duties. His conduct
wa3 marked by all the coplness and self-possession due
to the circumstances and his position ; acd he evinced
a high capacity lor command, end the cleareyt foresight
iu many of his measures for the 6V:fecc3 of New Or
leans. Tbe court respectfully report that its afsembiy was
delayed by the faiiare of its President to receive hi3
orders in due tirre, and that session was protracted by
the taking of testimony under tho order of the War De
partaent as to the conduct of navai officers on duty in
Department No 1. This order was rescinded, thus
rendering useless ard irrelevant much of the kbor of
the court. The testimony refered to, although appear
ihg cn record, we.3 not considered by the court in deter
mining it3 findings and opinion.

Bic&uonb, Va., Dec. 8th, 186 2.
lhe Presid.nt rapidly reviews tbe events of the pat
year, remarking, whiist success has not equalled our ex
pectations, we have checked the enemy everywhere in hia
advance. ....
Our relations with foreign natiens are uisousseu at
considerable leegth- The President regre'a there has been
no improvement since hia meesajie ot January last ; ard
that the condoet of European nations ia iws impartial, and
in some cages has assumed a character positively unfriend
ly. Commissioners were sent abroad for tbe purpose of
entering into negotiations proper to fix the relations, rights
and obligations of the Confederate and U. Rates, under trea
ties ettered into with foreign nations, prior to the separa
tion which hes taken place. But this tender, on cur part, has
been declined. H6r.ce, as we have bceu relueed the bene
fit of ttoae treaties, they certainly have ceased to be
binding ; atd In the opinion of the President, our relations
T&ith European Nations are now controiied txslusively by
the general rulea of tke law of nation.
Legislation npon the subject of oar finances U earnestly
recommended
Although the magnitude and duration of th war was sot
at first anticipated, still tha resources ot the country are ao
ample, and the spirit of tho poop'e eo devoted to its cause,
that relief is within our reach.
The financial policy of tho G eve mm ect, since Ita forma
tion, ia dis.nFsed, srv the l'rBJieni coDteuas mat, wDiiat
the provision of the Fei manent Consintion, In reference to
direct taxation, cannot be carried into effect by the mode
pointed cut, it ia plain that the duty cf Congress is to exe
cute tha general intent f the Constitution, by nuking the
tax aniforiG throughout the Confederate States.
These conaiderations are greatly enforced by the reflec
tion that an attempt to apportion the taxes am angst States,
some of which are wholly or partially in the occupation of
hostile forces, would subvert the whole inteutlon of the
trainers of tho Coititution, and be productive of tho moat
revolting irjustiee, instead of that iust correlation between
axation and representation which it was their purpose to
secure. With a large rortion of some of the States occupied
by tho enemy, what justice would there be iu imposing on
the remainder the whole amount of taxation of the entire
State in proportion toils representation ? What else would
thiij be in tfl-ct than to increase the burden of those who aro
the heaviest tufferers by the war, and make onr inability to
protect. theni Jrgm invasion, nsweare rt (juired to do by
the CcDBtrtu'icn, the ground tor adding tp their losses by
an attempted dherence to tha letter in violation of tha
spirit of that instrument. No such purpose could. have
been entertained, and to such result contemplated by the
framers of the ConstiiuMon. It may sdi weight to theae
considerations, if we reflect that, although tbe Constitution
provided that iUbotild go inta operation with a represen
tation temporarily distributed aftiocg the Staten, it express
ly ordains, after providing for a census within three years,
that this temporary distribntion cf representative power ia t
to enda'e until such enumeration shall be made. Wou'd any
one argue, 'hat because a census cannot be made within the
fixed period Government mast, at the expiration of that
period perish tor want of a liepresematlvo boiy. In any
aspect in which the subject can'be viewed, I am led to ths
conclusion ulrecdy jinnounced, PDd which is understood to
be in accordance wi'.h the vote taken ki one or both hon?es
at the last session I shall, therefore, until we aro able to
puisae the precise mode required by the Constitution,
doem it my dat.7 to approve cf any law levying taxation,
which yea are bound to impose for the defetce of the
country, in any other practicable made, whioh fhall dis
tribute the burtbxn uniformly and impartially on the whole
property of the people.
Ia your former legislation yon havo ECUht to avoid th n
increase of the volume of Holes ia circu'ation, offering iu
dncements for voluntary funding. Measures adapted far
that purpose have been but partially succesful, and the evil
has now reached such a magnitude as to permit no other
remedy than a ccmpulsary reduction of the currency
to the amcuct required by the besiness of the country. Thia
reduction should be accompanied by a pledge that under
co sirens of circumstances will that amount be exceeded.
No possible mode of using tha credit of the Go vetnmeat can
be to cn BBfroua as one wnicn aistnros tne DaPis oi ail ex
changes and renders impossible all calculations of Intore
values, augments in constantly Increasing proportions the
price of all cemmodities, and so depreciates all
fixed wages, salaries and iECfius, - as to render
them ii adequate to a bare subsistence. If to these
be added the still more fatal influence on the morals and
character ef the people to which I havo already adverted.
1 am persuaded you will concur ia the conclrsion that au
inflexible adherence to a limitation of the currency at it
fixed sum is an indispensabla element of any system of fi
nance now tt ba adopted. Holders of currency now
outstanding can only be protected in the recovery of
their jaat claim? by substituting for not?s some other
security. If the currency is rot greatly and - promptly
reduced the present pcalo of ir.tlited prices will not
only continue to exlat, but from tha very fact of
tho large amount thus made requisite in the conduct
cf the war. thcee prices will resch rates still more extrava
gant, and tie whole eystem tall under ita own weight, lender
ii g the redemption of the debt impossible, destroying lis
whole value in the hands of the holder. If, on the contrary,
a funded debt, with interest secured by adequate taxation be
substituted for the outstanding currency, its entire amount
will be available to the holder, and Government will be in
a condition enabling iu, beyond the reach of any probable
contingency, to prosecute the war to a saccessf ul issue. H
is, therefore, demanded, as well by the interest of the cred
itor SB of tbe country at large, that the evidences of public
debt now outstanding iu the sharb of troaeury notes, be
converted into bonds bearing adequate interest, with pro
vision for taxation sufficient to injure punctual pa . meat and
final redemption of the whole debt. The President recom
mends to t be con ideration of Congress the report of the Sec
retary of the, Treasury and hopes it will engross the c intid
erfttion cf that body until disposed of in ths manner bent
adapted to attain the important results whicJi the country

Georgh N. Sakdep.3 His Minion Abroad. The
London correspondent of the New York 2 r'mcs says:
Mr. Goerge N. Sacder3,b&3 beta drawn from his cov
er, in Pamlico, by the ram question. He declares that
he has had nothing to do with the rams at Birkenhead.
His innocent and lawful mission is to contract for six
fast mail steamers, not war vessels at all, nor armed in
any way. They arc to be plated; to be sure, so as to
run the blockade with the mails, aud are to carry such
freight a3 may be desirable. Thesa steamer" he con
tends, are perfectly lawful, and he professes bis willing
ness to tell Lord Palmerston confiientially, I presume,
where they are now being built, and to give him all need
ed particulars. Mr. Sanders is quite frank in the mat
ter. He admits that his steamers might very readily
be converted into men-of-war, and that once at Charles
ton or WilmiEgton with the mails, the Confederate Gov
ernment, making him a suitable compensation, might
arm and use tbem. That would, however, be no affair
of his, nor of the British Government. Pity Mr. Laird
could not make out that his rams were intended to carry
the mail, and that the iron beiks were only to be used
in plowing their way into some of the shallow harbors
of the Southern ffoast the plating giving them the
necessary momentum. It took Mr. Sanders to4conceive
of such a happy idea. Englishmen are not up t such
inventions.
But, with all his iajenuitv. I am disposed to think
that.Mr. Sanders' mail steamers will meet the fate of
Mr. Laird's rams. Police Constable Russell will take
charge of them, after having a confidential conveisation
with Mr. Adams, end perhaps, Mr. W alker. The
Washington Government has only to be firm jn the
matter. Mr. Lincoln has only to pat that foot down,
to compel Eogland, just as she is now sitcated, to stop
every thing which can aid the enemies of the Republic.
Russel will do what he thinks necessary, law or no law.
and await the meeting of Parliament.

in a notecs of Henry Ward Beecher's speech at Glas

" At tbe close of his address, a gentleman ia the
body of the room, - completely posed him bv reading a
clause from the United States Constitution, in which
slavery is made legal, and by asking whether Mr.
Beecuer and his inende were contending for the old
Constitution or a new one. If for the fi rut t.ow
must be contending lor slavery ; if for the second, thev
bad no right td complain of the South for following the
same course. We need scarcely say that "Mr. Bs
attempt to answsr the question left him completely im
paled opoa the. fcor&fl ol this cruel dilemma."
In conclusion, tbe Preaident advert to the savage fero
city of tha enecy ia conducting tha war, aud holds up to
public execration tne refusal of the Lincoln Government to
execute ihe cartel tar the exchange of prisoners. But 'h
