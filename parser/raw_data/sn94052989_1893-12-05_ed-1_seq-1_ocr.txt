,' "-..= ; John Tyndail was born August 21, 1820,
V. in the village of Lelghlin Bridge, near
Carlow, in Ireland. His parents were in
•.,"..; very modest circumstances, but they gave
'.':": >.im a good, sound English education. At
the age of 19 he joined in the capacity of a
"civil assistant" a division of the Ord
■■••; nance Survey, which was stationed in his
.-' naive town.
I;"-.. In 1844 he was engaged by a firm in
. Manchester, and for about three years he
• .• was employed in engineering operations
;'• in connection with railways. In 1847 he
' .'accepted an appointment as teacher in
>: . Queenswood College in Hampshire, a new
•=.;• institution devoted to agriculturists and
' ensineers.
...\ . There he became acquainted with Dr.
' .; Frankland, who was resident chemist to
tbe college, and there he began those
original investigations which placed him
in the front rank among the explorers of
science. In 1848 the two friends quitted
England together, and repaired to the
university of Marburg, in Hesye-Cassel,
where they studied under Bunsen and
other eminent professors.
Afterward Mr. Tyndall prosecuted his
rpsearcb in the laboratory of Magnus in
Berlin. He conduded investigations on
the phenomena of dfamagnetism and on
the polarity of diaroagnetic force, includ
ing researches on the magneto-optic prop
erties of crystals and the relation of mag
netism and diamagnethm to molecular
arrangement. He published a volume on
th^se subjects.
He returned to England in 1851. In 1853,
having been previously elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society, be was chosen profes
sor of the Royal Institution of Great
Britain end succeeded the celebrated Far
aday as superintendent. The publication
of an essay on the cleavage of slate rocks
was the cause of bis joining bis friend,
I'roTesßor Huxley, in a visit to the glaciers
of Switzerland in 1856, and they afterward
published a jont paper on the structure
and motion of glaciers.
He returned to Switzerland in 1857, 1858
and 1859, twice in the latter year. He
reached Chamonnl on Christmas night,
1859. through deep snow, and two days
afterward succeeded in attaining the
Montanvert, where he remained nearly
three days, for part amid blinding snow,
and d*tt-rmined the winter motion of the
Mci de Glace.
In 1859 he commenced his researches on
radiant heat, which disclosed relaiions
previously unthought of between this
agent and the gaseous form of matter.
Numerous memoirs published In the
"Philosophical Transactions" are devoted
. to this subject.
Professor Tyndall was a Rumford med
alist of the Royal Society and a
member of vaiious societies; he wi»h

Oxford. On the occasion of his receiving
the honorary degree of D. C. L. from the
University of Oxford. June 18, 1873.
r>r. Huntley, Margaret Professor of
Divinity, protested against the pro
ceedings on the ground that Professor
Tyndall "had signalized himself by writing
against and denying the credibility of
miracles and efficacy of prayer, ihus con
travening the whole tenor of that book
which, with its open page inscribed 'Dom
inus illuminatio mea,' the university still
bears as her device and therefore still pro
fesses to acknowledee as her guide."
In 1872 Professor Tyndall came to the
United Slates on a lecturing tour, in the
course of which he delivered thirty-five
lectures, thus realizing a sum of 823.000.
Deducting expenses, the residue was
carefully invested and rose in a few years
to £33.000, which was devoted to the
founding of scientific scholarships in
Harvard and Columbia colleges and in the
University of Pennsylvania "in aid of
students who devote themselves to orig
inal research."
Profnssnr Tyndall presided at the annual
meeting of the British Association held at
Belfast in August, 1874. He accepted the
presidency of the Birmlnghom and Mid
land Institute for the year of 1877.
For some years Professor Tyndall was
scieniific adviser to the British Board of
Trade and lighthouse authorities, but he
resieued those offices in May. 1883. when
he also withdrew from the special com
mittee appointed by the Board of Trade to
investigate the subject of the best illu
minants for lighthouses.
Besides other works, he wrote "The
Glaciers of the Alps"; "Mountaineering";
"A Vacation Tour"; "Heat Considered as
a Mode of Motion"; "On Radiation," the

READY FOR A FIGHT.
Sailing of the Two Brazilian
Steamers Southward.
They Are More Than Willing to
Meet the Rebel Admiral
on the Sea.
St. Thomas, Dec. 4.— As this dispatch is
sent the Ur«zii an cruisers Xictheroy and
America are preparing to sail under sealed
aiders for some port in Brazil. The Nic
theroy arrived here on Monday, and
steamed outside Tuesday and Thursday,
whpre excellent Hotcbkiss target practice
was done. The Kun crews handled the
new weapon in a most admirable manner.
The America arrived here yesterday
after a rough trip, and both vessels are
expected to weigh anchor to-night and
head for the coast of Brazil. The officers
and crews of (he Nictheroy and America
feel full of fight and most anxious for a
brush with the enemy.
Cable messages are said to have been
exchanged here between the commanders
of the Brazilian cruisers and tbe hi me au
thorities, aod it is said the captains have
been notified tbat Mello has left Rio to
meet the ships. This has caused all the
inoreeuthusias.il among tbe craws of tbe
Nictheroy and America.
Their destination is secret, and it is re
i orted tbe ships shall not be allowed to
communicate with the shore. It is doubt
ful when any further news of President
Peixoto's two cruisers will be forwarded.
The Associated Press correspondent on
board the Nictheroy has been well treated
by the officers of the ship and aniiciDates
witnessing the most novel naval battle in
tbe history of maritime warfare.

United States Marshals. The seizure was
made at the in-tance of John N. Rabbins.

WHY SCRIBA WAS WANTED.
The Importance of His Testimony
Against Eno.
New Yoek, Dec. 4.— When United States
District; Attorney Mitchell beard that
Augustas M. Scriba bad committed sui
cide in San Francisco be sent a
telegram to United States Marshal
Lone requesting him to send a
photograph of the dead man, with a full
description of any marks upon tiis
body which might identify him. Mitchell
said to-night: Three days before the
news that Scriba had committed suicide I
caused a suuiena to be issued for him as a
witness against J»hn C. Eno.
Iv 1884, after Eno had absconded with
$3,000,000 from the Second National Bank,
bcriba examined the accounts of that
bank, and m»de an investigation of Eno's
embezzlement. The can- against Eno is to
come up for trial soon and Scriba was an
important witness.
Dispatches say that Scriba left a note
requesting that his body be cremated at
once. These facts made it seem possible
that if Scriba had for any reason wished
to avoid testifying in this case it would
not have been a difficult matter to place
some of his papers in the pockets of an
other person.
I received an answer to my dispatch
stating that the photograph and requests
and ibe details would be forwarded. I un
derstand now that the body has been em
balmed and will be shipped to this city.
If the relatives identify the body as that
of Scriba that will be proof enough. A
photograph of the suicide with a full de
scription of his body will probably arrive
iv a lew days-
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 1893.
HEARD IN SILENCE
How Congress Took the
Message.
ALL INTERESTED IN HAWAII.
The Part Senator Dolph Did Not
Want to Lose.
CROWDS IN THE CORRIDORS.
On the Whole Washington Does Not
Seem Greatly Taken With
the New Congress.
. Washington, Dec. 4.— The assembling
of the regular session of the fifty-third
Congress at noon to-day was not marked
by the hubbub and confusion and the ani
mated scenes common to such occasions.
Usually there is a great rush of Washinj:
tonians and strangers to the Capitol, but
ouly for a short time to-day were the cor
ridors and galleries of the House and Sen
ate uncomfortably filled. The members
and Senators were slow to arrive. Of the
California delegation Loud, Hilborn,
Geary, Bower?, Maguire and Cannon were
in their seat*, and Representative Caml
netti is expected to arrive soo". Both
White and Perkins were absent when the
roll of States was called in the Senate. It
is understood that Senator White has been
delayed on account of sickness, but that he
will be nere in two or three days. Senator
Perkins will he here next week.
On many desks in the Senate were floral
tributes from admirers of the respective
occupants. Yice-Pres:dcnt Stevenson had
been remembered with a large basket of
roses. A bunch of roses lay on the desk
nf Dolpn, and the doughty champion of
the white metal, Stewart, was the recipi
ent of a basket of beautiful Marechal
Neils. The galleries were well filled at
first, and a touch of color was lent to the
scene by the bright winter toilets cf the
ladies present. •
After the Vice-President's gavel fell the
blind chaplain was led to the desk, and
he delivered an eloquent prayer.
The rollcall showed fifty-six Senators
present.
After the passage of the usual resolution
notifying the House or the meeting of the
Senate and the appointment of a commit
tee to join a like committee from the House
to wait on the President and notify him of
the assembling of Coneress, and one fixing
the time of meeting at neon each day. the
Senate took v reces* of an hour to enable
the committee to wait on the President.
At the expiration of the recess the Senate
reconvened. The message wa^ received
from the House of the appoin r ment of a
committee to wait on the President. An
other reress of twenty minutes whs taken.
On reassembling tbe committee to watt
on the President announced the accom
plishment of its duty and that the Presi
dent would at once communicate with the
Senate. Secretary Pruflen then stepped
f'-rward and delivered the message to the
Yice-Prestdent, who laid it before the Sen
ate, and Secretary Cox at once began its
readiDg. All present, with few excep
tion;, gave close attention when tbe read
ing began. Dolph gave attention to his
old file of bills for a few moments, but
uricked up bis ears as the reading reached
the Hawaiian paragraph. There wag, in
fact, a general changing about in the
seats of the Senators when that
portion of tbe document dealing with
Hawaii was approached. Many of
ihe Senators bad, however, anticipated
the Secretary's re»ding by turning to th**ir
printed copies. After tMs there was an
evident falling off in the interest of the
Senators, but their attention was briefly
revived when the paragraph concerning
bonds was rearbed. When this was passed
tue Senators gradually left their seats and
drifted into the cloakroom, so tbat by the
time the reading of two-thirds was con
cluded only twenty-five Senators were in
tbe chamber, and tbe majority of these
were encaged in conversation among them
selves. The reading was concluded at 3
o'clock, having occupied one hour and a
half.
Dolph immediately rose and said there
bad been distributed in the Senate printed
copies of what purported to be the mes
sage of the President, in which on page 9
he found part of page lOdevoted to Hawaii.
He did not hear that portion read from the
desk, ne desired to know, and thought
the country did also, whether that part
was inadvertently or purposely omitted by
the secretary, or whether the copies which
had been circulated were not true copies
of the message.
Tbe Vice-President responded that that
portion of the message relating to Hawaii
bad been inadvertently omitted by tbe sec
retary, and directed that it be read. This
was done, and D<>lr>b gave notice that be
would t -morrow address the Senate on
tbat part of the message. The message
was ordered to lie on the table.
Numerous petitions were presented and
many bills were introduced and referred.
A joint resolution permitting Colonel
Alison Mills, U. S. A., to serve as engineer
on the commission to survey and fix the
boundary between the United States and
Mexico was passed.
A message was received from the House
Announcing the deaths of O'Neill and
Lilly, late Representatives from Pennsyl-
vanla. Cameron of Pennsylvania offered a
resolution expressive of the sorrow of the
Senate and the appointment of a commit
tee to attend the funeral. As an additional
mark of respect at 3:53 the Senate ad
journed.
INTERESTED IN HAWAII.
But the Talk of the Income Tax
May Have Been Premature.
Washington, Dec. 4. — The galleries
were filled when Speaker Crisp rapped the
House to order at noon, with fully 300
members in their seats. Conspicuous
among the vacancies, on account of the
chairs being draped in mourning, w-re the
seats of Congressmen O'Neill and Lilley,
of Pennsylvania, the Keystone State
being thus cut short two of the full repre
sentation by death.
Rev. Bagey. Chaplain, delivered the
prayer, after which the roll was called.
The rollcall showed 240 members pres
ent.
H. 8. Bundy of Ohio, elected to succeed
the late Representative Enochs, appeared
before the bar of the House and took the
oath of office. Resolutions were passed
notifying the Senate .that the fl >u«e was
ready to proceed to business and appoint
ing a committee to wait on the President.
Gnfnn, successor of the late Chipman of
Michigan, was sworn in.
Various reports of bureau officers were
formally laid before the House.
The. Committee on Appropriations
asked unanimous consent for th« consider
ation of the hill appropriating $50,000 ad
ditional to pay the salaries of officers en
gaged in the enforcement of the Chinese
deportation and registration act. It wag
agreed to.
Hines of Pennsylvania askpd for unani
mous consent for the consideration of a
resolution for the appointment of a com
mittee to Investigate tne Lebigh Railway
strike. Kilaore of Texas objected and the
resolution was referred.
A recess was taken until l;io p. m.
At 1 :25 o'clock the committee to wait on
the President reported its duty discharged
and that the President would shortly com
municate with the House in writing. Ten
minutes later Secretary Pruden appeared
with th 6 message and Clerk Kerr began to
read it. The reading was listened to with
marked attention. Durine the reading of
the first portion of the message relating to
foreign relations, ex-St>eaker Thomas
Keei] burst through a side door and came
running across the area in front of the
Speaker's rostrum. Wiien be reached his
seat he deliberately lighted a cigar an«l sat
puffing away complacently while the read
ing proceeded.
As the reference to the Hawaiian affair
was reached the members straightened up
and cave the closest possible attention,
I'Ut no exprossion, either o f approval or
disapproval, was indulged in. There
seemed to be a general air of disappoint
ment, however, that so little space was
allowed to this question.
The recommendations relative to the
International Monetary Conference aud
the request for further authority for the
issue of bonds caused many significant
>hakes of the head on the part of tbe
extreme silver men. Tne President's
bold indorsement of the pension policy of
the Interior Department, of civil service
reform, and his appeal for rigid economy
In appropriations also attracted attention.
When reference to the tariff was reached
the members crowded about the clerk's
desk. The forceful utterances relative to
the duty of Congress on the tariff and the
hearty indorsement given the Wilson bill
seemed to please the Democratic members
greatly, but much surprise was evident
when that section of the message was read
stating the Ways and Means Committee
hud embraced in its plan several addi
tional internal revenue taxes and a small
tax on incomes of certain corporations.
As it was understood that the internal
revenue fcr.tures and the income tax bad
not been absolutely decided upon, the
President's announcement came in the
nature of a surprise, A roar of applause
greeted the conclusion of the reading.
General Binghani, who bas been selected
by the Pennsylvania delegation to make
announcement of the deaths of Represen
tatives O'Neill aud Lilley, was then recog
nized. A committee was appointed to at
tend the funeral of the late Representative
0 Nell of rYnu*y]v*ula, aud at 3 p. m., as
a further mark of res Dec t, tbe House ad
journed.
COMMENT IN CONGRESS.
Cleveland Has Betrayed the Ways
and Means Committee.
Washington, Dec. 4.— The views of the
members of both Homes concerning the
me-sage are freely expressed. Ex-SDeafcer
Keed said : "It i« exceedingly disappoint
ing, both in matter and manner. On the
Hawaiian question we are left as much in
the dark as ever, and must wait news by
the next steamer just as we have been
waiting so lone. That part of the message
which relates to the tariff asseverates that
the House committee in charge of that
subject has formulated plans and devised
methods of taxation which as a member of
the committee I have not even beard pro
-1 osed. It is a rather unusual sensation to
learn of the deeds of a committee, not in
th» committee-room, but from the Presi
dent of the United States. lias that
committee ceased In form to be
composed of both parties, and bas
it without even the formality of a
word in open committee Informed the
President of its determination in such a
way tiiat he can officially communicate it
to the House? How long has It been a
Dart of our system that a co mini tee of an
independent branch, and above all, the
committee which controls the purse, shall
report to Congress through the President?
Is this the result of tbe rumored blending
of the -appointive with the legislative
power? It is bad enough to have the tariff
bill made up by a little coterie, but to have
it communicated to tbe President before it
reaches even the committee, still less the
House, shows a determination to be moved
by no fact* and modified by no arguments,
which makes apparent the absurdity of ap
pointing Republicans on tbe Committee of
Ways and Means at all."
Mr. Springer approved of the reference
to Hawaii as (he only course consistent
with international honor and comity.
Hitman said: It is an able and forcible
document
McCreary— Able and appropriate.
Dolliver of lowa— Wanting In definite
ness and makes no pretense to leadership
of public opinion.
Wilson of West Virginia— Th« message
Is all right.
Tracey of New York— Heartily in ac
cord with it.
Gear of lowa— The President gives away
the Ways and Means Committee on the
income tax, will restore Liliuokalani and
agrees with II .ncock that the tariff is a
local issue.
Uynum of Indiana — A clear and concise
statement.
Boutelle— The first executive document
which charges a United States Minister
with malfeasance and treason.
Payne of New York— A remarkably dis
appointing document.
Dingley of Maine — Voluminous and
wearisome.
Dalzell of Pennsylvania— The portion on
the tariff shows that facts weigh nothing
with tariff reformers.
Hepburn of lowa— The discussion of the
Hawaiian policy is disappointing.
representatives Geary and Magu ire both
said they thought the message was "a
statesmanlike and able document."
Mr. Loud said: "It is a somewhat la
borious review of national affairs, foreign
and domestic. It seems to lack the old*
time vig<r of Mr. Cleveland, or else we
have become accustomed to his views and
only find them common platitudes now.
lie is frank, at least, on the Hawaiian
question, and only cautious In his declara
tions that the Queen should be restored by
means 'within the limits of constitutional
power.' Experience has taught us that ih^
executive has peculiar views of his own
regarding the 'constitutional powers'
vested in the President, and we must in
fer that he will restore the Queen If be has
forces enough at bis command. Mr.
Cleveland does not appear to be as strong
a tariff reformer as heretofore, but is still
striving to get a cheap- shirt for the poor
laborer and willing to reduce his wages to
accomplish it. His reference to the
Nicaragua canal is a weak attempt at
patriotism and not nearly as vigorous as
he was prior to the election of 1388. In
one sentence, I regard the message as
mighty 'thin soup.' "
Cannon of Illinois— The message will
not tend to restore confidence in the pro
ducing and commercial interests of the
country.
Manderson of Nebraska— With dogged
obstinacy and mulish stubbornness that
persists in wrongdoing when full en
lightenment shows a wiser course, the
administration having hauled down the
flag in Hawaii now proposes to trample It
in the dust. We are to trade the Goddess
of Liberty for a harlot.
Voorhees of Indiana — in the main a
sound, strong document
McPherson — Excellent all the way
through.
Murphy — It is a cord message.
Palmer— The President's impressions are
wide of the mark regarding fraudulent
pension*.
Kyle — 1 am pleased with the income tax
portion, but not about Hawaii and the
issuance of bonds.
Morrlll— The indorsement of a tariff bill
not yet acted upon in committee is unex
pected and remarkable.
Hoar— lt treats important questions
feebly and briefly. The reference to the
tariff report is a Drench of privilege.
Mitchell— l am surprised to lparn that
the restoration of Queen Liliuokilaui is
really contemplated.
Hawley— lt lacks vigor and is a disap
pointment.
Dubois— Lacking in force, atrengtbiand
Americanism.
Jones of Nevada— There Is no hope !for
silvai while the present administration is
in power.
Platt — It scarcely deserves comment.
Shoup— I am disappointed at tbe absence
of any recommendation of the recognition
of silver.
Dixon— Wearisome and without sugges
tions as to the immediate interests of the
country.
Among the Senators who declined to ex
press their views were Sherman, Aidrich,
Hill of New York, Daniel. Mills, Cotte,
Jones of Arkansas, Cockrell, Smith, Har
ris aud Waithali.
" ITS LENGTH GREATER."
That Is About All Ex-President
Harrison Would Say.
Indianapolis, Dec. 4.— Ex-President
Harrison declined to talk about the mes
sage. "The impropriety of an ex-Presi
dent discussing publicly the President's
message." said he. "is very palpable, and
I don't care to do so. 1 am a Republican
and President Cleveland te a Democrat;
consequently we differ radically in views
and opinions, and his suggestions and rec
ommendations are not in accordance with
my ideas. I notice, however, that he goes
down the line of the departments and
treats of them fully. Its length, too, is
greater than the average message."
GROSSLY INACCURATE.
The President's Mistake in Figuring
the Deficiency.
Washington. Dec. 4.— There is consid
erable comment heard on that part of
President Cleveland's message in which
he says that the deficiency in thfl treasury
will be about $28,000,000 at tne close of the
fiscal year on June 30, 1804. This Is said
to be n gross inaccuracy. Only hve months
of the fiscal year have passed, yet there is
already a deficiency of 500.000,000 in round
numbers. The customs receipts for the
month of November showed a falling oft
of $4,000,000, while the internal revenue
receipts decreased 81,000,000 during the
same period. With the threat of tariff re
duction and the uncertainty as to tbe in
ternal revenue taxes, it is beyond the
ability of any one acquainted with Treas
ury Department affairs to discover where
the President got his figures. The lowest
estimate heretofore given in competent
official circles is that the deficiency for
the present fiscal year will be about
850,000,000, and calculations have ranged
as high as 580.000.000. It was learned to
day from an authority upon which every
President's message and every report of the
Secretary of the Treasury has been ba*ed
since war times that the deficiency cannot
be less than 560,000,000. The President
may have calculated on the Wilson tariff
bill becoming a law before the end of the
present fiscal year, which has seven
months yet to run. He counts on increased
importations aud internal revenue taxes,
but the Wilson bill will hardly become
operative before July 1 next.
It is observed that in the estimate for
pensions incorporated in the book of esti
mates submitted to Congress to-day by
the Secretary of the Treasury there will
be a lopping < (T of about $18,000,000 In the
appropriation recommended to pay the
quarterly pittance of the soldiers. Ti.e
a; propriation for the fiscal year 1894 was
5181.000.00 a The estimate for the next
fiscal year ts $167,000,000. Tbe President
omits an estimate for tbe payment of the
sugar bounties, which, including salaries
to officers to distribute it will am. urn to
about $11,000,000. If the bounty repeal
passes it will have no bearing on the fiscal
year.
PRESS OPINION.
President Cleveland Finds More
Critics than Friends.
New Yokk. Dec. 4.— Tbe World will
say: The message as a whole, while it
will not add greatly to Mr. Cleveland's
fame as a writer or leader, is a sensible,
sincere, patriotic document.
The Morning Advertiser: The people
know what they may expect. A great
tight is before them, beaded by the Presi
dent himself. The free-traders will make
a desperate effort to pass tbe Wilson bill,
which, while it is not a free-trade meas
ure, has in it the memce of the extinction
of our free industries which all have
feared
The Herald: The dominant note of tbe
message is prompt tariff revision. All
other matters are subordinated to this,
which Mr. Cleveland properly regards as
the now overshadowing issue before Con
gress and tbe country.
Chicago. Dec. 4— The Times, Demo
cratic, severely condemns the President's
position on tbe Hawaiian question and
says that he is to be congratulated on the
astuteness with which be has laid oat his
lines of retreat from an unpopular and
untenable position.
The general tone of comment is very un
favorable. The Inter Ocean »ays the gen
eral tone of this message is as common
place as the one of ISS7 was sensational.
Tiie record says: The general motive of
the message as a whole may be said to be
economy.
Springfield, Mass., Dec. 4.— The Union
says: Ttie President stands squarely for
tariff reform of the Wilson variety, but
ignores x the lessons taught by the last elec
tion and assumes that the people are
anxious for radical revision of existing
schedules. His allusion to the work of
aiding the people through the work of
tariff reform is misleading, for it is per
fectly clear tlMt the people are suffering
to-day as a result of the general fear that
the policy which he advocates will be
be carried out.
Philadelphia, Dec. 4 -The Telegraph:
The document makes a wilderness of words
covering every possible subject before the
executive for his official coenizance, and
gives far more attention to divers and sun
dry irrelevant and unimportant things than
it does to others whicb are not only fore
most In the public mind at this time, but
which uimt be earnestly considered, and
for the time being, at least, definitely
settled.
The Bulletin: The message is disap
pointing in its failure to deal explicitly or
closely with important questions of policy
which interest all our countrymen. Even
those subjects on which be expresses em
phatic opinions are disposed of in sweep
ing general conclusions rattier than in
exact statements. Cleveland's mental re
luctance or inability to grasp great ques
tions at short range or iv specific detail
has never been more evident than in this
de jeune document.
St. Louis, Dec. 4.— The Globe-Demo
crat: It is, on the whole, a clear, well
written and businesslike document, and
except on the Hawaiian and silver ques
tions will prove fairly satisfactory to the
country.
The Hawaiian matter is destined to
make trouble for the administration, and
Mr. Cleveland appears to have a forebod
ing of this, but he proposes to adhere to
the policy which be has marked out. His
views on the financial question are wise.
The Republic: If the message outlines
any special policy it is that he will be con
tent from the hour when his pen traces the
name of Grover Cleveland at the bottom of
a tariff reform bill to be judged by his
countrymen as an administrator.
St. Paul, Dec. 4.— The Pioneer Press:
We can fiuii in this message evidence only
of the unadmirable qualities of dullness
and jealousy that leave even to his par
tisans no room fur enthusiasm over tbe be
ginnings of this administration.
APPROVED IN ENGLAND.
Where President Cleveland Can Al
ways Look for Applause.
London. Dec. 4.— The Daily News will
say of Cleveland's message: The message
is well worthy of the national crisis in
which it is delivered. The inference from
Mr. Cleveland's facts and figures, whether
intended or not, is that it is true policy to
cultivate close relations witb us. It seems
generally agreed that the new tariff pro
posals will not largely affect our trade with
the United States.
The Chronicle: In the references to
Brazil aud the Bering Sea dispute in Presi
dent Cleveland's message there is nothing
which might not have been fathered by
President Harrison. It is otherwise with
the reference to Hawaii. In awaiting
Cleveland's decision the friction that
would probably have been caused there by
interference at the time has been avoided,
but the result is the same. In regard to
the reform of the tariff the Chronicle says
that while the President will have the
good wishes of every sound economist in
the battle he has b^gun it would be pre
mature to regard it as already won because
the biggest battalions are at present on bis
side.
The Telegraph: That portion of the
message which displays President Cleve
land at bis best is his reference to Hawaii.
Such it frank and honest admission of a
mistake and the declaration of intention
to reverse it reflects the highest possible
credit upon the President and indirectly
upon the nation. Also, the President is
evidently convinced that the American
public would be magnanimous enough to
uphold his action, aud he is probably
right in so thinking.
The Morning Post: President Cleve
land's abstention from party rhetoric at
the expense of bis opponents is all the
more creditable as his opportunicies for
the employment of scathing invpctive were
exceptional. The Post expresses surprise
that the Hawaiian incidents are men
tioned in the message without any expres
sion of shame or indignation.
The Daily Graphic: Mr. Cleveland is to
be congratulated upon his firmness and
consistency.
The Times: Those portions of the mes
sage that bear upon foreign affairs are
conceived in a highly creditable spirit.
Considering the Chauvinism of our Ameri
can kinsfolk, it is more creditable that
the President has frankly admitted the
wrong done to Hawaii. Mr. Cleveland
would doubtless be inclined to go a deal
further than the Wilson bill, but he rec
ognizes the obstacle to progress caused by
the deficit. The Wilson bill would benefit
American workingmen and place manu
facturers upon something like a level with
their foreign competitors. Whether these
changes, in the long mn, will benefit Brit
ish industry and trade is doubtful.
The Standard: From our point of view,
and in spite of Mr. Cleveland's friendly
attitude toward England, we might almost
regard the proposed new tariff as the work
of an enemy. Its natural consequence is
to create a new competitor for our busi
ness abroad, and we can only hope that
experience and the benefit of cheap raw
materials may lead to better things in
other directions.

ATTITUDE OP THE niNISTER.
He Consents to an Interview, in
Which He Says That Lawless
ness Will Not Be Permitted.
Pokt Townsknd, Wash., Dec. 4.— The
harkentine Kl.kiiat. Captain Cutter, ar
rived to-day frura Honolulu with advices
to November 20, v four days after the
steamer Alameda sailed for San Fran
cisco. Minister Willis submitted to an
interview directly after the Alameda
stilled, in which lie said that the instruc
tions from the United Sates Government
which he brought from Washington were
not applicable to the condition of affairs
then existing iv the islands. This state
ment gave the annexationists much satis
faction and the royalists were much dis
pleased.
On account of the many rumors current
of the contemplated acts of the Queen's
supporters the Provisional Government
found it necessary to keep two companies
of soldiers under arms for several nights
after the Alaraeda sailed, The editor of
tho Evening Star requested Minister Wil
lis to submit a statement to the public to
allay the general feeling of uncertainty.
In a published interview Willis said:
"Yes, I believe that the time has come
when it is right and proper for me to use
my discretion in this matter. You are
authorized to say tor me that no change in
the present situation will take place for
several weeks. I brought with me certain
instructions from the United States Gov
ernment on tha Hawaiian situation. Since
my arrival contingencies have arisen about
which neither the United States Govern
ment nor myself were aware when I left
Washington. I have thought it best in
the exercise of the discretion allowed me,
to submit these matters to Washington
before proceeding further to carry out my
original instructions. I forwarded my dis
patches to Washington by to-day's steamer
and until I receive an answer to them no
change will take place in the present situa
tion, nor will any be allowed."
"What do you mean by the expression,
'Nor will any be allowed ?' " was asked.
"I mean just this, that until the time
comts for me to carry out my instructions,
the peace aud good order of this com
munity will be undisturbed in tbe inter
ests of humanity ; that any attempt made
by any person or persons to m»kd trouble
will be proinDtly checked and punished.
You may put the matter more plainly, and
say that even if the Provisional Govern
ment discharged nil its troops to-day no
lawlessness would be allowed Tor one mo
ment under the present situation of
affairs. The whole Hawaiian question is
now in abeyance, and nothing that the
newspapers can say or do will alter the
situation one iota. I make this statement
on my own resnonsibihty and in hope
that it will allay the present excitement.
No one need fear trouble and no lawless
ness will be permitted."
After this statpment rumors began to fly
about that the Queen's supporters would
make a final rally in her behalf. Two
companies of troops remained under arms
and the crews ofjthe United State* men-of
war Philadelphia and Adams were held in
readiness to be landed on a moment's no
tice. The Queen's advocates came out the
next day with a denial of Willis' interview,
saying he was misquoted, and by inference
gave encouragement to the idea that
Willis had or would receive imperative
orders to restore the Queen.
The newspapers containing Blount's re
port had not reached the islands when the
Klikitat sailed, but on account of Willis'
intimation relative to bis instructions, it
was surmised that it would be partial to
the Queen's interests.
Captain Cutler has visited the islands
on many different occasions during the
past twenty years and is personally ac
quainted with the leading members of
both factions. He says: "A large ma
jority of the better element strongly favor
annexation, but 1! left to a popular vote
the natives would outvote the annexa
tionists.
"The general sentiment prevailed chat
Blount's report would be biased and un
fair, inasmuch as he hobnobbed with the
royalist crowd. The natives of Hawaii
agree that the Queen is an immoral woman
and mi tit to govern the islands, and the
principal objection offered by the Pro
visional Government is the manner in
which it was installed.
"They want the United States to restore
the Queen, and then allo^r them to cnange
the form of government If they choose.
No further trouble need be f pared until
Willis has additional instructions from
Washington."
