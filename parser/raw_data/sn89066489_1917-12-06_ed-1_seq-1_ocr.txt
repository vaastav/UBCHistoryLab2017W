CONGRESS IN SESSION
Sentiment Favors Declaring War on
Enemy Aliens.
' Washington, Dec. 3. War atmos
phere pervaded the Capitol today
when the second session of the sixty-fifth
Congress the war Congress
opened at noon. In Senate and
House the uppermost thought was
the vigorous carrying on of the war
with all the legislative force Congress
can give it.
On both sides of the Capitol the
prospect of an early declaration of
war against Austro-Hungary and the
other Allies of Germany, so as to
make a clear-cut issue with the Cen
tral Powers, was bruited. Democrat
ic and Republican leaders, united in
favoring quick action by Congress
that would align Germany's allies as
enemies of the United States.
Congress did no legislative work on
.its first day. After the usual per
functory preliminaries, committees
were appointed by Vice President
Marshall and Speaker Clark to in
form the President Confess had
come together and would await his
message. This the President will de
liver in person at 12:30 o clock to
morrow.
, The Senate session lasted exactly
14 minutes, adjournment being taken
then on motion of Senator La Fol
lette, out of respect to the memory of
Senator Husting, who was killed in a
hunting accident six weeks ago. The
House took a recess for half an hour
Soon after getting together, so that
the joint committee might-1 fonnally
notify the President. Upon the re
turn of the House committee, the
House adjourned until tomorrow. .
Of the 67 Senators present, not one
..- appeared to have any definite idea
as to the war program Congress is
to undertake. Democrats and Repub
licans alike said there would be no
coherent idea for legislative work un
til the President's message had been
delivered. Everywhere the opinion
was expressed that Congress would
attack the war problems with tbe one
aim in view to win the war. Huge
war schemes, involving the expendi
ture of billions of dollars, will be
taken up with this spirit predomi
' nant.. i
That a strong sentiment exists in
Conn-ess for -a declaration of war
' against Germany's allies was evident
in talks with , various benators.
Three outstanding reasons were ad
vanced for this:
1. A-general sentiment throughout
the country to carry on bitter war
fare against Germany and the coun
tries fighting with it, so as to make
war against the common enemy.
2. It would afford the means of
classifying as enemy aliens the sub
jects of not only Germany, but its al
lies and in that way enable the Gov
ernment to protect itself against se
cret spies.
3. Unity of action in the Interal
lied Conference now tn progress in
Paris.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
ranking Republican member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, was
outspoken in favoring a declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary, Turkey
and Bulgaria.
COUNTY TREE PLANTING DAY
Only -Half Eonugh Trees Brought in
for Cotirt House Yard.
Quite a lot of interest, was mani
fested last Saturday in reforesting
the court house yard. The sum total
result was just exactly half as many
trees as we had holes. The variety
of trees brought in was fine. The
townships responding were Mt. Pleas
ant, four trees; Charlotte and Sum
mit, 3 each; Pleasant Gap, Deep vater
and Grand River, I each; New Homo,
6; the Presbyterian Sunday school 2;
Young Men's Bible class,' i; Loyal
Sons, t. The trees- are (as follows:
One sugar maple, 1 box alder, 1 ash,
2 mulberries, 3 hackberries.v 2 burr
oaks, 1 hickory, 2 white elms, 2 red
elms and 7 pecans. We would like a
sycamore or two, some white and wa
ter oaks, a wild cherry, another ash,
or two, some black walnuts, a blask
locust or two, some wild crab apples
and a few more elms would be accept
able. Townships responding this week
will be given a place. After next Sat
urday, if there are any vacancies they
may be filled by individuals. When
the places are all taken a full report
will be made through the papers,
showing which townships are repre
sented, the kind of trees, where lo
cated and-by whom brought in, so
that next summer it may be certainly
knpwn whose trees have survived or
perished.
Let the committee hear from you at
once, if you intend to send a tree,

RE-ORGANIZATION UNDER
WAY
Preliminary Steps to Reorganize
Commercial Club Successfully
Taken.
Appleton City on the Boom.
- From all reports our neighboring
town of Appleton City is on the
boom. The M. K. & T. railroad has
ran a switch to the coal mines south
east of town and about six carloads
of coal are being' taken out every
day. A large number of miners are
employed and' the weekly pay roll
puts a goodly sum of money in cir
culation in that burg.
The committee in the active charge
of the work of the reorganization of
the Butler Commercial Club met
with encouragement in their prelim
inary campaign which ended Tues
day, wiucn tney believe will assure
the unqualified success of the plan.
At a meeting of the members of
the club at the Opera House Mon
day night a number of talks were
made by members of the Club hearti
ly endorsing the plan to put that
body oh a firm financial basis and em
ploying permanently an expert in
civjc affairs to virtually have charge
of fhe details of the Club's business.
A. Lyman Donlin, secretary of - the
Federation of Missouri Clubs ad
dressed the members, pointing out
the: advantages of reorganization and
telling of the experiences of other I
cities adopting the plans proposed for tend.
Butler.
Tuesday morning, as a preliminary WAR SAVING STAMPS ON SALC
step, the committee called upon a I
number of members of the Club who Five Dollar Certificates and Twent-
siiDscrineu memuersnips under tne
new plan, and the amount $2,700, was
raised in about two horns.
Tuesday evening at a meeting of
the committee it was decided that the
campaign be continued and actively
reopened for the final work at about
the first of the year, bringing it to a
close at about the date of the election
of the officers and directors.
Mr. Donlin, who has been here in
an advisory capacity was called to
Harrisonville Tuesday night by the
business men of that city to assist
in the reorganization of the Commer
cial Club at that place.

RUNAWAY BALLOON
CAPTURED
Another One Breaks Lose at -Camp
Doniphan.
Cam) Doniphan, Ok.. Dec. r The
huge observation balloon which hov
ers daily over the aviation school
south of camp .was cut loose at 11:30
o'clock this morning when an air
plane struck the cab'e, slicing it in
two a few feet below the basket. An
altitude of t.ooo feet was being main
tained when the accident hatmened.
In the basket was a Major and First
I icutenant. Looking over the side
he saw the airplane which had done
the damage fluttering to the ground
like a crippled bird. Strangely enouch
the aviator escaped uninjured.
Meanwhile the balloon .nearly
filled with gas, shot aloft at a tremen
dous speed and drifted before the
wind in a northeasterly direction.
Three air planes took the air and
pursued the escaped balloon. They
hovered about it. but could give no
aid. Down on the drill grounds of
Camp Doniphan thousands of men
gared aloft at the s'range sight.
Kit until the balloon had attained
height of 000 feet did the officer
observers succeed in letting o:it
cnoivr'i fas from the bic bae to effect
descent.
A safe landing was made in a bit of
woodland 20 miles northeast of camp.

its free flight across Kansas into Ok
lahoma and back into Nebraska.
Great damage was done to telegraph
and telephone wires and wire fences.
