SENATOR REED ASKS
A PERTINENT QUESTION
If He Was Right in His Contention Then Is He Now
Entitled to Justice
Sustains His Position by Quoting from Message of
President Wilson Delivered Last Week
Senator James A. need Is now at I
hls'post In Washington, and Is feeling,
according to his letter, more satisfied
with the course that he pursued laat
session than he was before President
Wilson delivered his great message to
Congress In Joint assembly nt the con
venlng of the piesent session. The
whole country rend, and knew of his
efforts In the rename In reference to
the proposed food administration of
this country when It was proposed at
the last session and the efforts that
he made to defeat or modify certain
parts of It and also the criticism to
which he fell heir on nccount of those
efforts on his-pait. Now that Presi
dent Wilson has delivered his message
Senator Reed points out the features
of the Hoover bill ,to which he took
exception and cites Presldenf Wilson's
message as proof. In the following
letter sent out to the Mlsouil press
Senator Heed says:
To the Members of the Missouri press
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, 1917.
At the time the Food Control Bill
was before Congress I contended that
It would work an Injustice to the
farmer because It proposed to control
the prices or restrict the free market
of the things the farmer had to jsell,
but did not protect him against ex
cessive prices on the things he had to
buy, and that the bill thus framed
was. Inequitable. I Insisted that It
the price of the farmer's products
iv ere to be controlled then the pi ice
of those tilings he used must be simi
larly controlled.
These statements I repeated from

JAS. A. REED."
From the ConxrcKsloiuiI Ilecortl
Senator Heed's predictions as to the
workings of the Food Control Bill for
which he was criticised as fighting
tho President, June 29 and August 4,
1917: t'
"Mr. need. What I am trjlnjr, to lm-pi-cM
niton the Senator Is tliat If jou
deny to the fanner the benerit of the
competition of the world for that
which ho produces, ou must give to
him a protection against tho compe
tition of tho world In that which ho
Is to purcluise, .
"Now, I call the Senator's attention
to this fact: The farmer Is a con
sumer as well as a producer, and on
the average he consumes Just exactly
s much as any other man. He has
to have boots and shoes; and If you
make him sell his wheat In a con
trolled market, you must give him
his boots and shoes from that same
market, so that he gets them equit
ably. He must have barbed wire for
his fences. He must have agricultur
al Implements to till his fields. He
must have wagons. He must have
harness. He must have groceries.
"He must have sugar and tea and
coffee. He must have everything that
every ordinary person Jn the world amount as the discretion of the fed
has. Now, If you inako him sell In a'eral court may direct.
controlled market, must you not In
the very nature of thlucn glvo lilm
tlio benefit of purchasing In tlmt same
controlled market, niWt put It all with
in one agency? Where can you stop?
Mr, Page, "May I ask the Senator
If he is without any qualification In
favor of covering all of the neces
;sarles of life by this bill and allowing
2Mr. Hoover, or anyone for him, to
make the price?"
Mr. Ileedi-"I am If we pans the
bill giving control of the farmer's
product; then I shall Insist upon the
other,
"My own theory about the matter Is
that the thing to do Is to get the spec
ulator and attend to him wherever
he exist, to get the hoarder and at
tend to him wherever he exists, and
we have laws that govern that al
ready; to give a control over the ex
changes of the country so that all
gambling can be taken out, and we
have already
passed that statute
through the Senate, although it has
not been accepted by the House. My
theory, then. Is that having done those
things e should do everything possi
ble to promote as large a production
we can. and that then we would
have to protect our country against
the sGUIon of Europe the term used
and that that In lt-lf Is going to con-
tiol the farmer's prices a good deal,
It Is a very dangerous power unless It
is very carefully emplojed, but 1 am'
willing to give that, and my theory is
that that is about all we can do. Hut
