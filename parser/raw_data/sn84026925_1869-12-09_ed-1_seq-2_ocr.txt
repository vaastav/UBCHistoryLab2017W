with him by advancing a portion of the

earned, and thus enable him to offer inducements

ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE.
? The Charleston News publishes a list of the
Legislature, frotq which it appears that the composition
of that body is as follows: In tha Senate
there are six Democrats and twenty-five Radicals,
eighteen white and seven colored. In the House
of Representatives there are fifteen Democrats aud
one hundred and eight Radicals, thirty-six of whom
are white and seventy two colored.
? There are only two fat offices to be filled during
the present session, and as there is a number
of hungry candidates, the contest promises to be
exciting, to them at least The people do not feel
much interest in the matter, as none of the candidates
can fairly lay claim to any great popularity
or respect. Mackey, Neagle, Cardoza, Moses,
Willard, Hoge and Boozer, all aspire to be United
States Senator. For the office of Associate Judge
of the Supreme Court, the cards have not yet appeared,
though candidates are feeling around.
Whipper is repbrted to be in the lead, as he is the
candidate of the Radical "white ring" in the House.
?The correspondent of the Charleston News says
there are between fifty and sixty railroad lobbyists
in Columbia, with, an immense sum of money.
Their object is to secure the repeal of the bill refusing
State aid to railroads, and they represent
the following roads: Spartanburg and Union,
Greenville and Columbia, Georgia Central, Cheraw
and Darlington, South Carolina Central, York,
Blue Ridge, Port Royal, Wilmington and Manchester,
and Georgetown,.

THE TOWNSHIP LAW.
Several memorials have been presented in the
Legislature for the repeal or suspension of the
township law, and a Bill has been introduced by
DeLarge (colored)} to consummate this purpose..
The following extract, from the Columbia correspondence
of the Charleston Neios furnishes some
interesting information on the subject:, .
If the assertions of the members may.be relied
upon, the bill offered by DeLargej colored, to repeal
the "Act to organise townships and to define
their powers and privileges', will be passed. The
eighteen or twenty conntv commissioners who held
a conference here last July, being of the opinion
I that the impoverished oondition of the State, at
the present time, renders it impossible for the peoi
nip to nav the additional taxes which the require
ments under this act proyide for, have memorialized
the Legislature to suspend the act for ten
years, and ask that the county commissioners be
directed to appoint for each townshrp one special
commissioner, who stall be under their snperrisionj
and whose remuneration shall not exoeea two dollars
per day when actually employed; and the duties
of whom shall be to inspect and report to the
commissioners the condition of highways ana
bridges, and supervise and report to the same the
condition of the poor; to prepare and return annually
to the county commissioners a complete list
of the qualified voters within his township, from
which list they shall select not exceeding one,for
eveiy ten, nor less than ope for every twenty of
said voters iB the township, respectively, ,who shall,
in their opinion, be qualified legally To serve as jurors,
in accordance with the act passed the 2oth
day of September, 1868, entitled 41 An Act to regulate
the maimer of drawing jurors,the first1
registration after the proposed act to be the basis
of computation, and a new;computation to be made
after,eac^ new registration ;,.$hat be be required
to summon all persons between the ages of eighteen
and fifty, to work the ptiblic roads within tneir,
respective townships,, for not less than six days
each year, if so muoh be deemed necessary, and all
defaulters, after being duly summoned, shall be
subieat to a penalty of double the number of days.
The memorial, further, represents that the several
county commissioners should ha obligated in and
for the penal sum of three thousand dollars, conditioned
upon the lawful perfbrmarice of his duties;
the Charleston County Commissioners to be, with
like condition, obligated in and for the penal Bum
of ten thousand dollars; that all'work ordered by
the county commissioners be given dot by contract
to the lowest bidder, .in their Respective counties,
with real estate security, for the faithful performance
of the contract, when the amount ofit exceeds
one hundred dollars.
The conference, in their report, argue that if the
State (containing 37,000 square^ miles) be divided
as the law directs, it will oontain seven hundred
and forty townships, each of which will , require
seven officers. The law allows one dollar and fifty
ronta n?r diem far each officer when-mi dutv. Kacll
officer, perhaps, will be on duty one hundred and
fifty days in a year, making the pay of the officers
for one township, ror one year, fifteen hundred and
seventy-five ($1575) dollars, and the pay of all the
officers for all the townships, for one year; one million
one hundred and sixty-five thousand and five
hundred ($1,1G5,500) dollars.
This enormous expense shocks, as it should, the
county commissioners, and they'suggest plans to
reduce the expense by recommending the suspension
of the act for ten yearp, but at the same time
they cling somewhat to the features of the act.
They first request that the time for holding an election
for county commissioners be extended so as to
correspond with the State election, .claiming that
thereby a Baving of at least twenty thousand dollars
per annum to the State will be effected; then they
recommend a special commissioner for each township,
making seven hundred and forty of these officers
for the State. It is estimated that eadh officer
will be on duty about forty days in the year
?making each officer's pay eighty dollars ($80)
per annum, and for all the officers, for all the townships,
for the year, fifty-nine thousand two hundred
($59,200) dollars. It is true that this is a considerable
reduction, but why should they have any
special commissioners? What is wdnted of them
is, it seems to me, exactly what the oounty commissioners
are paid to do. Besides, how much labor
is to be expected of a man who gets only eighty
dollars a year? This is a small sum, and one "for
which," to use the argument of the report, in regard
to the one dollar and a half pdr day paid for
services of officers nhder the act, "no competent
man, if he honestly discharge his duty, would be
willing to give his services. It is to be hoped that
the bill to abolish the "Township act" will pass,
and thus rid the State of what is not only an intolerable
nuisance, but to support which also remiirPQ
nn onnrmmis einfinHitiire of monev.

C
Robinson's Show.
The 'Chester Rtowtcr, of last, week, gives 1
Robinson's Circns and Menagerie thoifollowiig (
first-rate notice. .
The Ciroas was here on Monday. Chester sustained
her well-earned reputation as a liberal pat- '
ronizer of this branch of the fine arta The orowd '
was immense, and was on hand early so as to lose
nothing of the sights or smells. Bv far the greater
portion of the crowd consisted of those who are ,
proud to call themselves 'the laboring population.' y
With what propriety they arrogate this title to
themselves we are at a loss to undoratand, unless 1
it is on the liwua djum htcerulo principle. The
performance was identity the same as when they c
exhibited here twplvc months ago?the same iokes ]
were rehearsed by the clown?the same old'bat- j
tercel masks were paraded by the K. K.?the i
comic mule, so-calleu, pitched the nigger over his .
head in the same approved style?the same trained '
horse agonized round the ring in what was called *
a waltz?the short-skirted and calf-padded beauties i
disported themselves as gracefully as before on the t
rope?the animals raised as big a stink as usual? .
and all in all it was the same old show over again.
The most noticeable feature of the whole exnibi- 1
tion was the daring bare back riding of Miss I
Cordelin. Her bold feats were performed with
wonderful agility and gracefulness. Though ahe
has grown some?at least 'the altitude of a chopin'?siuce
her former performance at this place, c
ner improvement in riding has not kept pace with j
the development of her stature. Her riding was j
not so good as when here in 1808. She lost her
balance several times in jumping backwards aorosa 1
the banners, and found herself suddenly on the c
ground. It may be that! she was unwell and not [
in good oondition ibr riding.
Soon after the close of the show they 'folded t
their tents like an Arab, and as quietly stole away' (
towards Youngesville where they were due on
Tuesday. We devoutly trust it may be many a
day before we see their faces among us again.
