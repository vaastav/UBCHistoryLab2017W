Washington. In his message to
congress, read in both houses Tues
day, President Roosevelt makes im
portant suggestions as to what he
considers necessary legislation.
The president congratulates the na-
tlon on its present excellent financial
standing, but calls attention to the
need of remedying defects in the cur
rency system. He says:
The financial standing of the nation
at the present time la excellent,
and the financial management of the na
tion's Interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown the
most sallsfactory results. But our cur
rency system is imperfect, and It is ear
nestly to be- hoped that the currency
commission will be able to propose a
thoroughly good system which will do
away with the existing defects.
Durlnsj the period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 1908, there was an increase
In the amount of money in circulation of
1902,991,399. .The increase In the per capita
during this period was $7.06. Within this
time there were several occasions when
It was necessary for the treasury de
partment to come to the relief of the
money market by purchases or redemp
tions of United States bonds; by Increas
ing deposits in national banks; by stim
ulating additional issues of national bank
notes, and by facilitating importations
from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur
rency system has made these proceedings
necessary, and they were effective until
the monetary disturbance in the fall of
1907 immensely Increased the difficulty of
ordinary methods of relief. By the mid
dle of November the available working
balance in the treasury had been reduced
to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing
house associations throughout the coun
try had been obliged to resort to the
expedient of issuing clearing house cer
tificates, to be used as money. In this
emergency it was determined to invite
subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal
bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent,
certificates of indebtedness authorized by
the act of June 13, 1898. It was proposed
to redeposit in the national banks the
proceeds of these Issues, and to permit
their use as a basis for additional circu
lating notes of national banks. The
moral effect of this procedure was so
great that it was necessary to issue only
$24,631,980 of the Panama bonds and $15,
436.600 of the certificates of Indebtedness.
During the period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 1908, the balance between
the net ordinary receipts and the nef
ordinary expenses of the government
showed a surplus In the four years 1902,
1903, 1906, and 1907, and a deficit la the
years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part
of the fiscal year 1909. The net result
was a surplus of $99,283,413.54. The finan
cial operations of the government during
this period, based upon these differences
between receipts and expenditures, re
sulted in a net reduction of the interest
bearing debt of the United States from
$987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding
that there had been two sales of Panama
canal bonds amounting in the aggregate
to $54,631,980, and an issue of three per
cent, certificates of Indebtedness unJer
the- act of June 13, 1S98, amounting o
$15,436,500. Refunding operations of the
treasury department under the act of
March 14, 1900, resulted in the conver
sion Into two per cent, consols of 1930 of
$200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of
Interest. A decrease of $S,687.956 in the
annual interest charge resulted,' from
these operations.
In short, during the seven years and
three months there has been a net sur
plus of nearly one hundred millions of
receipts over expenditures, a reduction
of the interest-bearing debt by ninety
millions. In spite of the extraordinary ex
pense of the Panama canal, and a saving
of nearly ' nine millions on the annual
Interest charge.
The message reiterates the well
known views of the president that the
control of great- corporations, espe
cially the railroads of the country.
should be vested in the national gov
ernment He says:
I., believe that It Is worse than folly
to attempt to prohibit all combinations
as Is done by the Sherman anti
trust law, because such a law can
be enforced only Imperfectly and un-
equally,- and Its enforcement -works al
most as much hardship as good. I
; strongly advocate that instead of an un
wise effort to prohibit all combinations,
there shall be substituted a law which
shall expressly permit combinations
which are In the interest of the public,
but shall at the same "time give to some
'agency in the national government full
- power of control and supervision over
them.
The railways of the country should be
put completely under the Interstate com
merce commission and removed from
the domain of the antl-truet law. .-. The
power of the commission should be made
thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise
complete supervision and control over
the issue of securities as well as over
the raising and lowering of rates. As
regards rates, at least, this power should
be summary. . . . Rates must be made
- as low as is compatible with giving prop
er returns to all ttie employes of the rail
road, from the highest to the lowest,
and proper returns to the shareholders,
hut they, must not, for Instance, be re
duced In such fashion as to necessitate
a cat" in the wages of the employes or
: the abolition of the proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Interests of the Wageworker
Turning to conditions affecting the
wageworker and the man of . small
means, the president says:
Postal Savings banks will make U
easy for the poorest te keep taeir MV
tngs In absblute safety. The regulation
of the national highways must be such
that they shall serve all people with
equal Justice. Corporate finances must
be supervised so as to make It far safer
than at present for the man of small
means to Invest his money In stocks.
There must be prohibition of child la
bor, u.mlnutlon of women labor, short
ening of hours of all mechanical labor;
stock watering should be prohibited,
and stock gambling so far as Is possi
ble discouraged. There should be a
progressive inheritance tax on large
fortunes. Industrial education should
be encouraged. As far as possible we
should lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man. There should no
longer be any paltering with the
question of taking care of the
wageworkers who, under our pres
ent industrial . system, become killed,
crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular Incidents of a given busi
ness. As far as concerns those
who have been worn out, I call your
attention . to the fact that - definite
steps toward providing old-age . pen
sions have been taken in many of our
private Industries. These may be In
definitely extended through voluntary
association and contributory schemes,
or through the agency of savings
banks, as under the Massachusetts
plan.
Urgent Need of Reform.
Our present system, or rather no sys
tem, works dreadful wrong, and Is of
benefit to only one class of people the
lawyers. When a workman Is Injured
what he needs is not an expensive and
doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of
relief through Immediate administra
tive action. No academic theory
about "freedom of contract" or "consti
tutional liberty to contract" should be
permitted to interfere with this and
similar movements.
I renew my recommendation that
the principle of the eight-hour day
should as rapidly and as far as practi
cable be extended to the entire work
being carried on by the government;
the present law should be amended to
embrace contracts on those public
works which the present wording of
the act seems to exclude.
I renew my recommendation made In
a previous message that half-holidays
be granted during summer to all wage
workers in government employ .
Judges Too Poorly Paid.
Coupled with a eulogy of the Ju
diciary of the nation the president
urges that, beginning with the su
preme court, the judges should have
their salaries doubled.
As was to be expected, the attitude
assumed by certain labor leaders dur
ing the recent election ' comes in for
bitter criticism. The president as
serts that demands made on congress
for legislation were unjust and im
practical and could but work harm to
the cause of labor. While declaring
that our Judicial system is sound and
effective at core, the president says:
There are certain decisions by various
courts which have been exceedingly det
rimental to the rights of wage-workers.
This is true of all decisions that decide
that men are, by the constitution, "guar
anteed their liberty" to contract to enter
a dangerous occupation, or to work an
undesirable or improper number of hours,
or to work in unhealthy surroundings;
and therefore cannot recover damages
when maimed in that occupation, and
cannot be forbidden to work what the
legislature decides is an excessive num
ber of hours, or to carry on the work
under conditions which the legislature
decides to be unhealthy.
There Is also, I think, ground for the
belief that substantial injustice Is often
suffered by employes In consequence of
the custom of courts issuing temporary
injunctions without notice to them, and
punishing them for contempt of court In
instances where, as a matter of fact,
they have no knowledge of any proceed
ings. Organized labor Is chafing
under the unjust restraint which
comes from repeated resort to this
plan of procedure.
Injunction Must Remain.
The power of Injunction Is a great
equitable remedy, which should on no
account be destroyed. But safeguards
should be erected against its abuse.
In substance, provision should be made
that no. injunction or temporary re
straining order issue otherwise than on
notice, except where irreparable Injury
would otherwise result; and In such case
a hearing on the merits of the order
should be had within a short fixed pe
riod, and, t if not then continued after
hearing, It should forthwith lapse. De
cisions should be rendered immediately,
and the chance of delay minimized in
every way. Moreover, I believe that the
procedure should be sharply defined, and
the judge required minutely to state the
particulars both of his action and of his
reasons therefor, so that the , congress
can if it desires examine and Investigate
the same.
Harm Worked by Law.
Discussing measures necessary for
the proper control of giant corpora
tions operating In defiance of law, the
president says:
Real damage has been done by the
manifold and conflicting Interpretations
ox the interstate commerce law. Con
trol over the great corporations doing
interstate business can be effective only
if It is vested with .full power in an
administrative department, a branch of
the federal executive, carrying out a
federal law; it can never be effective if
a divided responsibility is left in both
the states and the nation; it can never
be effective If left In the hands of the
courts 'to be decided by lawsuits.
The courts hold a piace of peculiar and
deserved sanctity under our form of gov
ernment. Respect for the law is essen
tial to the permanence of our Institu
tions; and respect for the law Is largely
conditioned upon respect for the courts.
It Is an offense against the republic to
say anything which can weaken this re
spect, save for the gravest reason and in
the most carefully guarded manner. In no
other nation in the world do the courts
wield such vast and far-reaching power
as In the United States. All that is nec
essary is that the- courts as - a whole
should exercise this power with the far
sighted wisdom already shown by those
judges who scan the future while they
act in the present!
Forest Preservation. . 7 4
The manifest "necessity for forest
preservation is pointed out as a duty
tni present generation owes to its de
scendants, and the president cites the
case of China, where reckless tetor-:
estation has resulted in creating des
erts, as an object lesson.
Inland Waterways.,
Immediate action by the present
session of congress for the improve
ment of our inland waterways the
president declares to be Imperative.
He recommends the creation of a per
manent commission authorized to co
ordinate the work of all the govern
ment departments relating to water
ways, and to frame and supervise the
execution of a comprehensive plan.
Postal Savings Banks.
Urging the immediate institution of
postal savings banks, the message
says:
I again renew my recommendation
for postal savings banks, for deposit
ing savings with the security of the
govrnment behind them. The object
Is to encourage thrift and economy in
the wage-earner and person of mod
erate means. It is believed that In the
aggregate vast sums of money would be
brought into circulation through the In
strumentality of the postal savings
banks.
Parcel Post.
The much-dlscusse'd advisability of
the establishment of a parcel post
service is thus dealt with:
In my last annual message. I com
mended the postmaster-general's
recommendation for an extension of the
parcel post on the rural routes. The
ir.tablishment of a local parcel post on
rsral routes would be to the mutual
benefit of the farmer and the country
storekeeper, and it Is desirable that the
routes, serving more than 15,000,000
people, should be utilized to the fullest
practicable extent.
Education,
Dealing with the important subject
of education, the president says:
With the limited ueans hitherto pro
vided, the bureau of e ducation has
rendered efficient service, but the con
gress has neglected to adequately sup
ply the bureau with means to meet the
educational growth of the country.
I earnestly recommend that 'this un
fortunate state of affairs as regards
the national educational office be reme
died by adequate appropriations. This
recommendation Is urged by the repre
sentatives of our common schools and
great state universities and the leading
educators, who all unite In requesting
favorable consideration and action by
the congress upon thts-subject.
The president points out the neces
sity of better organization of the vari
ous bureaus responsible for the public
health, and urges the placing of all
soldiers' homes under the jurisdiction
of the war department.
Statehood.
On the question of statehood the
president says:
I advocate the immediate admission of
New Mexico and Arizona as states. This
should "be done at the present session of
the congress. The people of the two ter
ritories have made it evident by their
votes that they will not come in as one
state. The only alternative is to admit
them as two, and I trust that this will be
done without delay.
An international agreement con
suming Interstate fisheries is at pres
ent being attempted, and in this con
nection the message continues:
I call the attention of the congress to
the Importance of the problem of the
fisheries in the Interstate waters. On the
Great Lakes we are now, under the very
wise treaty of April 11 of this year, en
deavoring to come to an international
agreement for the preservation and sat
isfactory use of the fisheries of these wa
ters which can not otherwise be achieved.
Lake Erie, for example, has the richest
fresh water fisheries in the world; but it
is now controlled by the statutes of two
nations, four states, and one province,
and this province by two different ordi
nances in different counties. All thvse
political divisions work at cross pur
poses, 'and in no case can they achieve
protection to the fisheries, on the one
hand, and Justice to the localities and in
dividuals on the other.
Country's Foreign Policy.
This nation's foreign policy Is based
on the theory that right must be done
between nations precisely as between
individuals, and In our actions for the
last ten years we have in this matter
proven our faith by our deeds. We
have behaved, and are behaving, to
wards other nations, as in private life
an honorable man would behave to
wards his fellows.
I take this opportunity publicly to
state my appreciation of the way in
which in Japan, in Australia, in New
Zealand, and in all the states of South
America, the battle fleet 'has been re
ceived on Its practice voyage around
the world. The American government
can not too strongly express Its appre
elation of the abounding and generous
hospitality shown our ships in every
port they visited.
Our Southern Neighbors.
The commercial and material prog
ress of the 20 La tin-American republics
is worthy of the careful attention of
the congress. The International Bureau
or the American Kepubucs is doing a
useful work In making these nations
and their resources better known to
us. and in acquainting them not only
with us as a people and with our pur
poses towards them, but with what we
have to exchange for their goods.
Panama Canal Being Rushed.
The work on the Panama canal Is be
ing done with a speed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty, which make it
a model for all work of the kind. The
men on the Isthmus, from Col. Goethals
and his fellow commissioners through
the entire list of employes who are
faithfully doing their duty, have won
their right to the ungrudging respect
and gratitude of the American people.
For Ocean Mail Lines.
I again recommend the extension of
the ocean mail act of 1891 so that satis
factory American ocean mail lines to
South America. Asia, the Philippines,
and Australasia may be established.
Citizenship for Porto Ricans.
I again recommend that American cit
izenship be conferred upon the people of
Porto Rico.
Should Develop Hawaii.
I call particular attention to the Ter
ritory of Hawaii. The importance of
those Islands is apparent, and the need
of improving , their condition and de
veloping their resources Is urgent.
Progress In the Philippines.
Real' progress toward self-government
to seiaf ssade la tbe fhuippue taUadtv
I trust that within a generation
the time will arrive when the Filipinos
can decide for themselves whether It Is
well for them to become Independent, oi
to continue under the protection of
strong and disinterested power, able te
guarantee to the islands order at horns
and protection from foreign invasion.
Good Work Done In Cuba.
In Cuba our occupancy will cease In
about two months' time; the Cubans
have In orderly manner elected their own
governmental authorities, and the island
will be turned over to them. Our occu
pation on this occasion has lasted a lit
tle over two years, and Cuba has thriv
en and prospered under it. Our earnest
hope and one desire Is that the people
of the island shall now govern them
selves with justice, so that peace and or
der may be secure.
The president urges that national
parka adjacent to national forests, be
placed under the control of the foresl
service of the agricultural depart
ment; he also points out the benefits
derived from pure food legislation.
The National Guard.
Urging continued efforts to In
crease the efficiency of the National
Guard the president continues:
Now that the organized militia, the
National Guard, has been incorporated
with the army as a part of the national
forces, It behooves the government to
do every reasonable thing in its power
to perfect Its efficiency. It should be
assisted In Its Instruction and other
wise aided more liberally than hereto
fore. The continuous services of many
well-trained regular, officers will be
essential in this connection. A
bill Is now pending before the
congress creating a number of extra
officers in the army, which If passed,
as it ought to be, will enable more
officers to be trained as instructors of
National Guard and assigned to that
duty. In case of war it will be of the
utmost Importance to have a large
number of trained officers to use for
turning raw levies into good troops.
The Army.
As regards the army I call attention
to the fact that while our junior offi
cers and enlisted men stand very high,
the present system of promotion by
seniority results in bringing into the
higher grades many men of mediocre
capacity who have but a short time to
serve. No man should regard it as his
vested right to rise to the highest rank
In the army any more than in any
other profession. It Is a curious and
by no means creditable fact that there
should be so often a failure on the
part of the public and its representa
tives to understand the great need,
from the standpoint of the service and
the nation, of refusing to promote re
spectable, elderly Incompetents. The
higher places should be given to the
most deserving men without regard It
seniority; at least seniority should be
treated as only one consideration. In
the stress of modern industrial com
petition no business firm could succeed
if those responsible for Its management
were chosen simply on the ground that
they were the oldest people in its em
ployment; yet this is the course advo
cated as regards the army, and re
quired by law for all grades except
those of general officer. As a matter
of fact all of the best officers In the
highest ranks of the army are those
who have attained their present posi
tion wholly or in part by a process of
selection.
The scope of retiring boards should
be extended so that they could con
sider general unfitness to command for
any cause. In order to secure a far more
rigid enforcement than at present in
the elimination of officers for mental,
physical or temperamental disabilities.
But this plan is recommended only If
the congress does not soe fit to provide
what in my judgment is far better,
that is, for selection in promotion, and
for elimination for age. Officers who
fail to attain a certain rank by a cer
tain age, should be retired for in
stance, if a man should not attain
field rank by the time he is 45 he
should of course be placed on the re
tired list. General officers should be
selected as at present, and one-third
of the other promotions should be
made by selection, the selection to be
made by the president or secretary of
war from a list of at least two candi
dates proposed for each vacancy by a
board of officers from the arm of the
service from which the promotion is
to be made. A bill is now before the
congress having for its object to se
cure the promotion of officers to vari
ous grades at reasonable ages through
a process of selection, by boards of of
ficers, of the least efficient for retire
ment with a percentage of their pay
depending upon length of service. The
bill, although not accomplishing all
that should be done, is a long step in
the right direction; and I earnestly
recommend its passage, or that of a
more completely effective measure.
Japanese Exposition.
The Japanese government has post
poned until 1917 th date of the great
international exposition, the action be
ing taken so as to insure ample time
In which to prepare to make the expo
sition all that It should be made. The
American commissioners have visited
Japan and the postponement will mere
ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri
ca to be represented at the exposition.
Not sinceAhe first international expo
sition has there been one of greater
Importance than this will be, marking,
as it does, the fiftieth anniversary of
the ascension to the throne of the em
peror of Japan. The extraordinary
leap to the foremost place among the
nations of the world made by Japan
during this half oentury is something
unparalleled In ail previous history.
For More War Vessels.
The navy is the last subject dealt
with. In that connection the presi
dent says:
I approve the " recommendations of
the general board for the In
crease of the navy, calling especial
attention to the nee.l of addi
tional destroyers and collier, and above
all, of the four battleships. It Is desir
able to complete as soon as possible a
squadron of eight battleships of the best
existing type.
I most earnestly recommend tr-at the
general board be by law turned into a
general staff. There is literally no ex
cuse whatever for continuing the pres
ent bureau organization of the navy. The
navy should be treated as a purely mili
tary organization, and everything should
be subordinated to the one object of se
curing military efficiency. A system
or promotion oy merit, either ty selec
tion or by exclusion, or by boUi
process, should be introduced. ' .
