THE MESSAGE
s
H w it is Koeelved by the
J Sil tr7
Washington 7Tbe Preiidanti mes
sage it generally received with satisfac
tion and commendation Some disap
pointment ii expressed that hA did not
more distinctly and definitely enunciate
ft policy This feeling hewever IMDIB
confined to thoio who hop for the de
minion of a faction of the party Repub
lieu generally think tko President
mean to entirely ignore factions and to
heal dusantioni aad art glad he re i
trained free saying anything that could I
be seized upon by either faction Wilt
Ull republicans especially those from the
silver producing states are not pleased
At the recommendation to limit silver I
coinage but they console themselves I
with the belief that Congress will not
carry out that recommendation
As to the Presidents message among
senators and congressmen of all shades
of politics the belief appears to be that
it is a very able document Opinions as
to the correctness of its conclusions vary
of course according to party affiliation
and individual sentiment but there is a
general agreement that in clearness of
style dignity of tone and force and fresh
ness of argument it is far above the
average level of the annual presidential
messages for a number of years and that
it indicates the possession by its author of
a much higher grade of ability than has
heretofore been commonly attributed to
him There are some disappointment
aaaong Pacific Coast representatives a
be absence of any hearty recommen
dation for legislative action to restrict
Chinese immigration especially as
the President takes pains to sug
gest that Congress should care
fully regard the interests and sus
ceptibilities of the Chinese government
in legislating upon that subject On the
other hand it is noticed with gratification
that the message does say that legislation
is necessary to carry the treaties into
effect and also that the President signifi
cantly though not so openly as might be
desired refers to the evils of unrestricted
Chinese immigration when he says that
our government views with concern the
efforts to seek the replenishment of the I
diminished population of the Sandwich
Islands from outward sources i
President Arthurs vigorous utterances
upon the Mormon question give unal
loyed satisfaction to the Pacific Coast
people and all other opponents of polyg
amy and will probably have a decided
influence on the result of the pending
contest in regard to the admission of
Campbell as aa antiMormon delegate
It is considered highly probable that the
republican members of tbe House will
solidly sustain Speaker Keifer in the
position taken by him today in favor of
Campbell and these combined influences
will also it is believed be reinforced by
many democratic members whose abhor
ance of Mormonism will lead them to
forgo the possible iyantogo of embar
rassing the republican speaker which is
apparently the purpose of the opposition
led by exSpeaker Randall EG that on
the whole Campbells admission seems to
be pretty well assureed
Chicago 7The Times criticises the
Presidents message as beingmore like an
address from the throne than any docu
ment of tho kind since Washingtons
time but commends it for its nonpar
tisan features
The Tribune finds the message objec
tionable for its recommendations on the
silver question and for its unusual
length
The InterOcean regards it as a digni
fied worthy document a vigorous and
straightforward message and one of the
best given to the country for fifteen years
All journals notice its great length
London 7The liaily Telegraph on
the message As long as reform in the
civil service remains unaccomplished the
danger that public interest will be sacri
ficed to faction and that corruption will
prey upon the vitals of the state must
endure The dread catastrophe has
given an awful warning and the belt in
terests of the noble people demand that
showy promises bl promptly followed by
solid performances
New York T Journals are crowded
to day with the Presidents message and
document incident to the opening of the
caw Congress The message itself is
universally well spoken of particularly
II by republican and independent sheets
The World says The message in a
word is full of views aad the views are
not pretended to be the views
of the country or even of the
party but only personal opinions
of the fttttkor of the message which are
to be taken as the saying is for wha
they are worth J No careful reader of
the message can fail to note this pecul
arity and few reflecting readers will be
able to assign it to its true cause It is
the same cause which made the letter of
acceptance of tha republican candidate
for Vice President last year so much
more outspoken and positive than the
otter of the republican candidate for
President The World concludes In re
gard to finances and our foreign relations
tho President speaks with force and
clearness which will command the re
eat of patriotic men of all parties
