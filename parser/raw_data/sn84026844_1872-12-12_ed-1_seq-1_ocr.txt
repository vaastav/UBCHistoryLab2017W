New Yoku, December 11.?The lire
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel last nigbt
broke out shortly alter 11 o'clock on the
sicond ll<>or of the hotel. Thu stair-case
upon which the lire started was one at
the buck ol the bouse, leading Irom the
laundry in the basemeut lo the servants
room on tho attic floor. The flames ran
rapidly up the stair-way; it whs ms a
chimney, there being no openings Irom
it but ai the lop and bottom. Ii ate up
the stair case and charred its surroundiugs.
Keaching the open spice into which
the rooms of tlie servants opened, i: bur.-t
into its fullest strength. The ll uues in
their passage did little or no damage until
they reuched the corridor ai the top;
the draught driving it through the narrow
passage way, carrying llic llunes
quicker, making them more destructive,
as they went on they spread over the entire
extent of the west wing.tho woodwork
of the rooms where the servants slept immediately
caught the flames and so>m the
entire wing was a mass of livid tlauies;
the flames spread so rapidly that tho servants
asleep in rooms at the top of the
stairway were over taken,and before assistance
could reach them were completely
abut oil Irorn the main building. The
lireman who hud in the meantime arrived, I
were too late lor assistance, H8 by this*;
time the apartments ol the poor creatures
were enveloped in ll-nut's. Shortly after
one o'clock, when it was found a number
of persons were mi?iu?, the police
officers and the chief ol the fire department
effected an entrance by means ol
an iron ladder to the room. where
the people were supposed to be; tlry
there found the charred and burned b idies
of thirteen persons. The bedding Hud
furniture were strewn about the rooms
confused with human remains; the bodies
lay at ditlerent places, from which the
poor peopL bad tried to find means of
egress. Some hail endeavored to escape
through the window?; others in their en
deavor to tind air had t tllon at the head
of the staircase. The bodies of two w - ,
men were half concealed under the bed in
an outer room, where they evidently tried ;
to shelter themselves from the landing,
sutFocating smoke and scathingll tints
When the firemen and police got into the :
wing tl Hjraol this room they weres mu I, ,
but "the roof timbers were burned and ha 1 |
fallen upon the floors iu a confused mass
upon the bodies. Water was thrown from
the hose, which was several inehes deep
on the floor, and was filtering through to
the ground. Heavy beams of the roof |
had fallen upon the burned bodies, severing
the limbs and mutilating the re- ;
mains horribly. The bodies were speedily i
removed to OellcTue, from where to day .
they will be sent to the Morgue. Owing to t
iuc \.uuiu9iuu auut At<ikvkucuh| iuc uaujca ui (
the victims could not, up to 20 minutes
past 2 o'clock, be ascertained. Twenty- (
two dead bodies had been recovered? ;
sixteen in one room ana six in another, \
which |s probably all. Tho alarm was i
first given by one o! the female servants,
who shrieked tire through the hall-way,
awakening tho guests, of whom there
were about SOD in tho botel. Many ot
them went to the otllce and inquired <
as to the cause of tho excitement, but *
were informed by the clerks, that there '
was only n little firo in tho laundry, i
This attempt to keep the lire quiet so as
to avoid a panic, helped to briog about u '
terriblo result. When the guests became
cognizant of their danger, scenes of con- i
fusion ensued, people moving about in '
apparent distraction; baggage filled th<;
hall-ways, the smoke was allocating, and
water drenched the floors. It was nearly
twelve o'olock before any oue gave the
alarm. A. passing policeman learning of
the flre inside, caused the lire engines to
come to the spot. The fito by this time,
had made considerable headway. The
ladies were in a wild htate of excitement.
The carpets were still covered with
water. Une ot the poor servant girli
was lbund on tlio third floor writhing
in tho Hgony of pain, her body being ,
frightfully burned. The shrieks of the
servants in the upper stories were heartrending
as the firemen were making their
way to rescue them. Largo crowds had
in the meantime gathered in the streets.
The excitement outsido was kept up tiil
about two o'clock, when the fire was
about extinguished.
The Herald editorially says ,it is stated
that gross carelessness was apparent in the
condition of warmiug apparatus, and that
there was too much at.xiety to keep the
fire secret, and too little effort made to
save the unfortunate girte.
Tho whole subjoct will, no doubt, bo
investigatod. Thelosses ure estimated at
from #100.000 to $150,00. There are i
various statements as to tho origin of the
fire. Ouo says it was causcd by a bursting i
steam pipe in the laundry. Some seventy
or eighty servants altogether were awak- i
ened from the top floor and hurried down
stairs. Their clothing was utterly ruined.
A fireman named Dcavey was seriously
injured by falling through the crevice to
the pavement. The hotel furniture wan
worth about $400,000. Fully one fourth
of this i.H utterly ruined. The house is
owned by A. lleno, but was leased to
Darling, Griawold & Co. Just beforo the
alarm a guest win assigned a room which,
on rearliing, he discovered to bo on fire.
Returning to tho clerk ho was informed
that there was no other room vacant The
fire was not known at this time in the office.
Among the most prominent guests
wero General llurnside, General Horace
I'ortcr, and G. M. Pullman, of Chicago.
Several of the lady guests were accommodated
in the neighboring hotels and
bouses. Alias Neillson, ttio actress, wus
one of the lady jjucatH. The building was
bo Hliglitly constructed that the water
went through the floors as a eei'vo.

The House resumed consideration of
the soldiers' bounty bill called up yesterday.
Sir. Dunntll, of Minnesota, opposed the 1
bill, being unable, he said, to conceive of
a bill more mischievous in its tendencies '
and ellectB. Did Congress propose to satisfy
the claims of soldiers for au equalize ;
tion of bounties by giving them bounty 1
land warrants which would not sell in
the market lor twenty dollars? The bill
would benefit only those who never smelt
gunpowder in tho delence of the country.
Mr. Townsend opposed the bill, ami
said the soldiers ot Pennsylvania were ,
opposed to it, and the Grand Army of the j
Hepublic, in its session in Easton, in Feb- j
ruary, 1872, had expressed in resolutions ]
its disapprobation of the provisions and (
principles embraced in the bill.
Mr. Hawley also opposed the bill, and {
showed bow unlairly and injuriously the ,
bounty system had worked as applied *
to the soldiers ot the Mexican war. He cal- J
eulated that those soldiers got $3G,0U0- [
000 from the salo of their land war- t
rants and that the actual settlers had paid
$1.1501000,000 tor it, the difference going
into the pockets ot the hnd speculators.
The pending measure would work inll- (
nitely more unfairly than that one, br- "
cause now any one could settle on lauds 1
under the homestead and pre emption c
laws. Under this bill two million per- J
sons would bo entitled to land scrip. If i
only one-tenth of them applied in the year 1
that would throw on the market thirtytwo
million acres, and scrip would onlyhold
cood for one voar. 'I lie eflm't wnuM i
only bo that the soldier who spent at least .
$10 in getting his warrant could nut sell [
it in the market for $3. The measure ,
would thcrelore prove to be practically a c
fraud on the soldier, and he held most
rigidly to the policy of preserving the |
public lands for actual settlers. t
The bill was defended by Messrs. Don- ^
nan and ripeer, when Pennsylvania politics
were brought into the discussion, .Mi
SjKier asserting relative to the resolutions
of the Grand Army of the Republic pre- v
aented by Mr. Townsend and signed by 1
Hartranft, the Governor elect, that the J
organization did not represent tho honest '
soldier ot the country, but the political
men and ollicers who were controlled by
railroad companies and monopolies. lie c
(Speer) had been repeatedly culled a liar 1
bv the Republican press for stating that (
llartranft signed these resolutions, which 1
do not represeut the soldiers ol Pennsyl- I
vania. Ho asked his colleague to furnish i
the resolutions of tho Soldiers' C'onven- s
tion, or the letter ot a single soldier of 1
Pennsylvania who carried tho musket, in 1
opposition to his bill. They arc the po- c
litical soldiers put forward by politicians 1
to wiu campaigns for them.
Mr. Townseud replied that the conven- 1
tion was composed of delegates chosen (
by soldiers, and some of whom were pri- 1
vate soldiers, who carried a musket aud f
knapsack during the war. c
Mr. Speer ajrain asserted that the Grand 1
Army ot tlie Republic was a scmi politi- 1
cal organization run in the interest of pol- t
itiriana find nf rnilrnHil rnmrvmuxj e
Air. Townseml replied that it wag h (
semi political organ:7. ition because it wns I
composed of men Who were soldiers, i
TJio soldiers of the war are Republicans, 1
while those of the rebellion were l)emo* J
crats. [Excitement on the Democratic }
side ] .]
Mr. Randall?'That's not so. 1
Mr. ttpeer denounced Mr. Townscnd s (
statement as false in fact anil disgraceful I
to a representative lrom Pennsylvania. (
Mr. Townscnd, in conclusion, asserted 1
that tho rebellion was gotten up by the r
Democratic party of tho South assisted (
by the moral influence ol their coadjutors, J
the Democratic party of tho North, and }
that nine-tenths of the soldiers were lie- 1
publicans. j
