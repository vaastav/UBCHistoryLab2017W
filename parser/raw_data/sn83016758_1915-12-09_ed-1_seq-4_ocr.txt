The man who said that when a man

wrong.
American voters entirely too often
attempt to transform a two spot into
a statesman, by the simple expedient
of electing him to office. It can't
be done.
The last lingering doubt as to the
fallacy of Henry Ford's peace mis
sion went a glimmering when Wil
liam Jennings Bryan enthusiastically
endorsed it.
There is an insistent demand
throughout the length and breadth of
the state that Frank B. Kellogg re
consider his determination not to be a
candidate for the United States senate.

It is to be hoped that the present

laws are enacted to enable this gov

busy themselves fomenting indus

American commerce.

Great Britian continues its high

well knows we are in no position to
carry the controversy beyond the note

also show a disregard of the rights of

sideration than the color of his eyes.
The progressive party has not
breathed its last as yet, but its under
pinning is becoming rather wabbly.
Frank A. Munsey, a prominent east
ern magazine and newspaper publish
er who was one of the aggressive lead
ers of the movement, now admits that
the republicans must present a solid
front in the national election next
year. About all that remains of the
Bull Moose organization at the pres
ent time is a few discontents, and a
motely array of self-seekers.
Congressman Schall of the Fourth
congressional district voted with the
republicans the organization of the
house of representatives. It was re
publican voters that elected Mr. Schall
to congress and he knows it, and we
believe he will work and vote with the
republicans all through the session.
We trust, however, he will stand by
the president's plan for increasing the
army and navy and improving our
sea-coast defenses, unless some better
and more comprehensive measures
are introduced.
Henry Ford can spend all the money
he wants to on a fool errand to Eu
rope, but the state department will
see to it that the countries visited will
not gain the impression that the Unit
ed States government is sanctioning
the plan. Members of the peace party
will not be given passports to bellig
erent countries, as such passports are
only jssued when business makes it
absolutely necessary to visit there or
when an invitation is extended by
some governmental agency in those
countries. It is generally interpreted
that the United States does not re
gard unofficial missions in efforts to
make peace by private persons as bus
iness of an urgent character. And it
it certainly isn't. Mr. Ford might as
well try to halt the solar system, as
to restore peace in the war-crazed na
tions of Europe at the present time.
An article in Farm and Fireside
sets forth the advantages of concrete
roads and especially the small cost
of their up-keep. Reference is made
to the splendid system of concrete
roads in Wayne county, Michigan. The
city of Detroit with its immense val
uation and its millionaire automobile
manufacturers is located in Wayne
county. Every one will concede that
concrete roads are all that is claimed
for them and that it would be very
desirable to have long stretches of
them in every township in Minnesota.
But any sane person knows that $14,-
000 per mile roads are not feasible in
this state at present, save localitieb
in such wealthy counties as St. Louis,
Hennepin and Ramsey. A good coun
try road ought to be built for $2,000
to $3,000 per mile, and such a road
should not cost more than $25 to $30
per mile annually for maintenance.
The supreme court has decided that
Pipestone county voted "wet" at the
county option election held there on
June 7. The canvassing board certi

that the county had voted "dry" by

There appears to be an under
current peace sentiment even in the
belligerent countries, and a recent
editorial in the Berlin Vorwarts con
tains some sensible suggestions. It
demands that the nations at war an
nounce the concrete objects for which
they are fighting, as the first essen
tial step to peace, and there is no
doubt but what that would be the
starting point of peace negotiations.
No specific declarations have been
made by any of the leaders in the
belligerent countries as to what they
are contending for. After stating
that it is really high time to speak
more intelligently and to the point,
the writer says: "The war continues
indefinitely because both parties fear
to place limits to their demands and
speak them out, for fear the announce
ment of the object for which they are
fighting will be interpreted as a sign
of weakness. It may go so far that
this war will end with the complete
exhaustion of all parties, because no
one cared to say under what specific
conditions it was prepared to end it."

Hints are being handed out in high

it comes to holding the troubles of his
native above those of his adopted
country, he is putting a stain upon his
Americanism and helping the land of
his birth not a bit. The only possible
use for the hyphen when it comes to
describing Americans, native to this
land or immigrants to it, is in the
word "all-American."Luverne Jour

it is hinted in some of the papers of

WILSON'SJESSAGE A VIGOROUS PLEA FOR LARGER
AND MORE EFFICIENT ARMY
AND NAVY.
A SCATHING INDICTMENT OF
FOREIGN-BORN PLOTTERS
PAY AS YOU GO.
President Wilson's message to con
gress is able and statesmanlike. He
favors a closer union of American
countries and reasserts the Monroe
doctrine. On this subject he *says:
"There was a time the early days
of ourown great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to inde
pendence in Central and South Amer
ica when the government of the Unit
ed States looked upon itself as in some
sort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any en
croachments or efforts at political
control from the other side of the
water felt it its duty to play the
part even without invitation from
them and I think that we can claim
that the task was undertaken with a
true and disinterested enthusiasm for
the freedom of the Americas and un
molested self-government of her inde
pendent peoples. But it was always
difficult to maintain such a role with
out offense to the pride of the peoples
whose freedom of action we sought to
protect, and without provoking serious
misconceptions of our motives and
every thoughtful man of affairs must
welcome the altered circumstances of
the new day in whose light we now
stand, when there is no claim of guar
dianship or thought of wards but, in
stead, a full and honorable associa
tion as of partners between ourselves
and our neighbors, the interest of
all America, north and south.
"Our concern for the independence
and prosperity of the states of Cen
tral and South America is not altered.
We retain unabated the spirit that has
inspired us throughout the whole life
of our government and which was so
frankly put into words by President
Monroe.
"We still mean always to make a
common cause of national independ
ence and of political liberty in Amer
ica. But that purpose is now better
understood so far as it concerns our
selves. It is known not to be a sel
fish purpose. It is known to have in
it no thought of taking advantage of
any government in this hemisphere
or playing its political fortunes for
our own benefit. All the governments
of America stand, so far as we are
concerned, upon a footing of genuine
equality and unquestioned independ-
ence."
Continued non-interference in the
affairs of Mexico is what the president
counsels. These words would imply
that as far as he is concerned that
distracted country will be permitted
to work out its own salvation:
"We have been put to the test the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited
Mexico by the course we have pursued
remains to be seen. Her fortunes are
in her own hands. But we have at
least proved that we will not take ad
vantage of her in her distress and un
dertake to impose upon her an order
and government of our own choosing.
We will aid and de
fend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all
America that we seek no political
suzerainty or selfish control."
The president favors a reasonable
policy of preparedness and recom
mends a slight increase in the forceb
of the regular army and a supple
mental disciplined reserve force of
400,000 men. We quote from his mes
sage:
"By way of making the country
ready to assert some part of its real
power promptly and upon a larger
scale, should occasion arise, the plan
also contemplates supplementing the
army by a force of 400,000 disciplined
citizens, raised in increments of 133,-
000 a year throughout a period of
three years. This it is proposed to do
by a process of enlistment under
which the serviceable men of the coun
try would be asked to bind themselves
to serve with the colors for purposes
of training for short periods through
out three years, and to come to the
colors at call at any time throughout
an additional "furlough" period of
three years. This force of 400,000
men would be provided with personal
accouterments as fast as enlisted and
their equipment for the field made
ready to be supplied at any time. They
would be assembled for training at
stated intervals at convenient places
in association with suitable units of
the regular army. Their period of an
nual training would not necessarily
exceed two months in the year."
These terse sentences indicate the
importance the president attaches to
a larger and more, efficient navy.
"We have always looked to the navy
of the country as our first and chief
line of defense we have always seen
it to be our manifest course of pru
dence to be strong on the seas. Year
by year we have been creating a navy
tiL^it'M", *-& j&- x%j&. ^cZ^^^tiS'sA
which now ranks very high indeed
among the navies of the maritime na
tions. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun, and how soon."
This paragraph forcibly expresses
the president's belief in an adequate
American merchant marine:
"We have not ships enough of our
own. We cannot handle our own
commerce on the seas. We are not
likely to be permitted to use even the
ships of other nations in rivalry of
their own trade, and are without
means to extend our commerce even
when the doors are wide open and oui
goods desired. It is of capital im
portance not only that the United
States should be its own carrier on the
seas and enjoy the economic independ
ence which only an adequate merchant
marine would give it, but also that the
American hemisphere as a whole
should enjoy alike independence and
self-sufficiency, if it is not to be drawn
into the tangle of European affairs."
A bond issue is not favored by the
president to meet the increased ex
penses of the government that the en
largement of the army and navy
would necessitate. He believes we
should pay as we go, and here is his
suggestion as to the sources from
which the necessary revenue should
be derived:
"We should be following an almost
universal example of modern govern
ments if we were to draw the greater
part or even the whole of the reve
nues we need from the income taxes.
By somewhat lowering the present
limits of exemption and the figure at
which the surtax shall begin to be im
posed, and by increasing, step by step
throughout the present graduation, the
surtax itself, the income taxes as at
present apportioned would yield sums
sufficient to balance the books of the
treasury at the end of the fiscal year
1917 without anywhere making the
burden unreasonably or oppressively
heavj."
We doubt whether these suggestions
for raising additional revenue will
meei with popular approval:
"And there are many additional
souices of revenue which can justly be
resorted to without hampering the in
dustries of the country or putting any
too great charge upon individual ex
penditure. A tax of 1 cent a gallon
on gasoline and naptha would yield,
at the present estimated production,
$10,000,000 a tax of fifty cents a horse
power on automobiles and internal ex
plosive engines $15,000,000 a stamp
tax on bank checks, probably $18,000,-
000 a tax of 25 cents a ton on pig
iron, $10,000,000 a tax of 25 cents a
ton on fabricated iron and steel, prob
ably $10,000,000. In a country of
great industries like this it ought to
be easy to distribute the burdens of
taxation without making them any
where bear too heavily or too exclu
sively upon any one set of persons fr
undertakings. What is clear is that
the industry of this generation should
pay the bills of this generation."
In the following vigorous languas
the president pays his respects to ihe
foreign-born marplots who are at
tempting to raise hell in this country
"I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the
thorough preparation of the nation to
care for its own security and to make
sure of entire freedom to play the im
partial role this hemisphere and in
the world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to it. I
have in mind no thought of any im
mediate or particular danger arising
out of our relations with other nations.
We are at peace with all the nations
of the world, and there is reason to
hope that no question in controversy
between this and other governments
will lead to any serious breach of ami
cable relations, grave as some differ
ences of attitude and policy have been
and may yet turn out to be. I am
sorry to say that the gravest threats
against our national peace and safety
have been uttered within our own
borders.
"There are citizens of the United
States, I blush to admit, born under
other flags but welcomed under our
general naturalization laws to the full
freedom and opportunity of America,
who have poured the poison of dis
loyalty into the very arteries of our
national life who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of ow
government into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to strike at them, and to debase
our politics to the uses of foreign
intrigue.
"Their number is not great as com
pared with the whole number of those
sturdy hosts by which our nation has
been enriched in recent generations
out of virile foreign stocks but it is
great enough to have brought deep
disgrace upon us, and to have made
necessary that we should promptly
make use of processes of law by
which we may be purged of their cor
rupt distempers. America never wit
nessed anything like this before. It
never dreamed it possible that men
sworn into its own citizenship, men
drawn out of great free stocks such
as supplied some of the best and
strongest elements of that little, but
now. heroic, nation that in a high day
of old staked its very life to free it-
^^iftffi
self from every entanglement hatS
had darkened the fortunes of the older
nations and set up a new standard here
that men of such origins and such
free choices of allegiance would ever
turn in malign re-action against the
government and people who had wel
comed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because it was in
credible we made no preparation for
it. We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for it, as if w^
were suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the
ugly and incredible thing has actually
come about a^id we are without ade
quate Federal laws to deal with it.
"I urge you to enact such laws at
the earliest possible moment and feel
that in doing so I am urging you to do
nothing less than save the honor and
self-respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty, and anar
chy must be crushed out.
"They are not many, but they are
infinitely malignant, and the hand of
our power should close over them at
once. They have formed plots to de
stroy property, they have entered into
conspiracies against the neutrality of
the government, they have sought to
pry into every confidential transac
tion of the government in order to
serve interests alien to our own. It
is possible to deal with these things
very effectually. I need not suggest
the terms in which they may be dealt
with.
"I wish that it could be said that
only a few men, misled by mistaken
sentiments of allegience to the gov
ernments under which they were born,
had been guilty of disturbing the self
possession and misrepresenting the
temper and principles of the country
during these days of terrible war,
when it would seem that every man
who was truly an American would in
stinctively make it his duty and his
pride to keep the scales of judgment
even and prove himself a partisan of
no nation but his own. But it cannot.
There are some men among us, and
many resident abroad who, though
born and bred in the United States and
calling themselves Americans, have so
forgotten themselves and their honor
as citizens as to put their passionate
sympathy with one or the other side
in the great European conflict above
their regard for peace and dignity of
the United States. They alsopreacn
and practice disloyalty. No laws, I
suppose, can reach corruptions* of the
mind and heart but I should not speak
of others without also speaking and
expressing the ever deeper humilia
tion and scorn which every self-pos
sessed and thoughtfully patriotic
American must feel when he thinks of
them and the discredit they are daily
bringing upon us."
President Wilson concludes his mes
sage with these patriotic sentences:
"For what we are seeking now, what
in my mind is the single thought of
this message, is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should serve it in the spirit of its
peculiar genius. It is the genius of
common men for self-government, in
dustry, justice, liberty and peace. We
should see to it that it lacks no instru
ment, no facility or vigor of law, to
make it sufficient to play its part witti
energy, safety, and assured success.
In this we are no partisans but her
alds and prophets of a new age."
He May Heed the Call.
The friends and admirers of Frank
B. Kellogg are very likely to induce
him to become a candidate for United
States senator. Mr. Kellogg has made
it known that he has a natural aver
sion against vote begging and the
usual political campaign methods and
for that reason announced his deter
mination not to be a candidate. It is
believed by the admirers of Mr. Kel
logg throughout the state, that if a
general demand for him to become a _,
senatorial candidate came from the gg
country, that he would heed the call.
Mr. Kellogg enjoys a national repu
tation as a lawyer and statesman and
stands the foremost man in the state
in ability, character and honor. His
whole life career has been an honor
able one and he knows no way of
doing a thing except .the right way.
Mr. Kellogg has no influence or in
terests to subserve and is and always
has been free to act as his conscious
ness of right dictated. As United
States senator he could be depended
upon to act in perfect harmony with
Senator Knute Nelson, Minnesota's
Grand Old Patriot. It would really
be a good thing for the people if-they
were allowed to choose such a man
as Frank B. Kellogg as their candi
date for United States senator, to re
present them in Washington,- free
from machine politics and sinister in
fluences. The pulse of the country
press is the pulse of the majority of
the people and we believe that the
country press will endorse the can
didacyof Mr. Kellogg.Roseau Times.
Ought to Make Him Senator.
If there is any one thing that ought
to make Frank B. Kellogg United
States senator from Minnesota it is
his letter declining to enter the race
for that position.Blue Earth Post.
