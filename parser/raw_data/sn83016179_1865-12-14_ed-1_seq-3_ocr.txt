Sober Facts for Thinking People.
Year after year, for an eighth of a century, the
Press of the country has chronicled the beneficial
effects of IIOSTETTER'S STOMACH HITTERS.
Editors, authors, physicians, merchants, officers of
the aruiy and navy, chemists, counselors, ministe.s
of the gospel, in short, a great cloud of witnes-esof
every profession, trade ami calling, hare testified
to its efficacy as a tonic and legulatlng medicine.
The names and statements of those witnesses lmvc
been published in the public prints. Many of tliem
arc well known to the whole public. Their testi
mony has never been challenged or impugned.
Upon evidence far less weighty men arc acquitted
or condemned by conscientious juries.
[ HOSTETTEH'S STOMACH BITTEUS is not, however,
| upon trial. It has been tried and pronounced 011
the authority of those whose lives and health it
has preserved, a pure, harmless and eminently sal
utary preparation. Attempts have hcen made to
rival it. They have failed. Can it he necessary
to say why they have failed ? Ask the recovered
from the dyspeptics, billions sufferers, victims of
fever and ague, and nervous subjects who have ex
perienced its effects, what they think of it. ASK
TJIEM and be guided solely by whut they say. Sohl
