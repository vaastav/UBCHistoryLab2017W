Organizations.
BY WILLIAM E. CURTIS.
Written for The Star ami the Chicago RecordHerald.
The buildings of the German universities
are not like similar institutions in
the United States. They are more like
business houses or manufactories.
There are no dormitories. The students
live in boarding houses and apartments.
The lecture halls of the different faculties
are scattered, often at considerable
distances from each other.
In Leipzig the main university building,
or the Augusteum. as It is called,
is an imposing structure of classic design
of three stories, with a noble portico.
It stands fronting Augustus plats.
In the very center of the city near the
theater, the opera and the post office department.
The library is in the building called the
Paullnum. almost two miles distant. Students
who want to consult one cf the
400,000 volumes or 10,000 manuscripts
, nave to take a long walk or spend twenty
or thirty minutes on the trolley ears.
The Fridericianum, containing the medical
department, is in another direction.
The other buildings, called the Maurictaaum
and the Borngrianum, are also s?ptrated
by wide distances.
These leng and pretentious names are
derived from the kings who have ruled
aver Saxony, and some of them have
statues.
In the great courtyard of the central
building, the Augusteum, which was thoraughly
rebuilt on modern lines in 1-804#0.
is a bronze statue of Prof. Leibnitz,
mathematician and philosopher, a native
Df Leipzig. who is regarded as the most
famous of all the eminent men who have
held chairs in the faculties.
Augfusteum is Big Building.
The Augusteum is an enormous building
and contains thirty-six lecture halls,
accupled by professors of law, philosophy,
theology, mathematics, physics and other
lepartments.
The largest is an auditorium accommoSating
500 people, where the literary exercises.
the conferring of degrees and
other functions are held. The other lecture
halls hold from one to three hundred,
but seldom do the classes exceed
, l.w in numbers.
The Augusteum has an imposlpg rotunda,
or "wafting hall." as they call ft.
ft contains a monument in honor of the
'^udents who fell in the war with France
A 18TO-71. a marble statue of the late
ing of Saxony, a number of busts of
eminent professors and various other memorials.
The walls are decorated with striking
frescoes. One of them represents Prometheus
bound to the crags of Kasbek in
the Caucasus; others are intended to represent
the development of civilization aft r*
Prometheus had conferred upon mankind
the blessing of Are.
The lecture rooms are bare and gloomy,
like those of American colleges. Tfee
laboratories, in the upper stories, are
light, airy and attractive.
The university is gcing to have two new
buildings. It owns the adjoining block,
and as soon as the leases of the buildings
which now occupy it expire they are to
be torn down and replaced by modern
znd model structures especially designed
for the purpose.
The income of the University of Leipzig
is quite large in comparison with those of
other German institutions, being nearly
four niill'ons mark, or a million dollars.
One-half is a subsidy from the government
and the other half is from rents
and fees.
Students Who Do Not Study.
In Leipzig, the professors tell me. the
average atter.dance upon lectures is
about three-fourths of the students enrolled.
Usually one-fourth of a class is
neglectful of opportunities and attends
lectures only now and then.
Three or four per cent of every class
cut lectures habitually and spend their
time in the Fruhschoppen, or cafes, and
In other dissipations. Most of these drop
out before the examinations and abandon
their degrees.
At every university there are various
organizations, in which birds of a feather
flock together, as in American institutions.
They are characteristic of German
student life. The three chief color-wearing
organiza'ions are the Corps, the
Burscher.schaften and the Christian societies,
and between them are several
minor varieties.
The Corps, which correspond to our
Greek letter fraternities, are recruited
from the ranks of the nobility, the aristocracy
and other wealthy young men.
who claim to be the elite of the student
body and the hereditary leaders of the
nation. German public life has been fa\orabie
to these pretensions.
Membership in a university eogps is
everywhere accepted as a mark of super*
lor character and ability, without regard
to the individuality of the person concerned.
As a rule, members of the corps
may be depended upon to support the
government and adore their sovereign.
Patriotism of Burschenschaften,
The Burschenschaften had their beginning
during the wars for German independence.
They are made up of liberal
and in some cases revolutionary material,
and constat almost entirely of representatives
of the middle class, the sons of agriculturists.
merchants, manufacturers and
professional men.
They are filled with love for their fatherland.
A fundamental article of their
political faith is that the class system
and hereditary nobility are the chief
causes of the misfortunes which have
fallen upon the German people. While, as
a body, they are not hostile to the government.
more revolutionists, socialists
and reformers are found among their
members than in other societies.
The Corps are exclusive and clannish.
The Burschenschaften are neither, although
they do not admit to membership
students without certain qualificationsAs
one student expresed it:
While every member of the Burschenschaft
does not sympathise with socialists.
every socialist sympathises with the
Burschenschaft."
The influence of the Burschenschaft has
been toward higher ideals of student
life and close attention to study. They
deserve the credit of having done much
toward abandonment of demoralising
customs that used to prevail In all the
German universities and still retained in
several. They have promoted morality,
manliness and culture.
A third class of organisations, composed
chiefly of divinity students, are
known as "Christian Societies." They
correspond to the Y. M. C. A. of American
colleges, and have similar methods
and purposes.
In addition to these are bicycle, golf
and tennis clubs, photogrgph clubs, Uter
ary, debating, orchestral and choral societies,
dramatic clubs, and innumerable
other groups of students who are pursuing
the same fads and fancies.
Student Dueling Abolished.
The student duel is practically abolished,
because of the determined attitude
of the emperor, the church and society
generally. In Austria the duel remains
as the only method of settling disputes
and "affairs of honor" in the army. In
German universities all participants in
duels, if detected, are punished with expulsion
and imprisonment
Fencing bouts are not so popular as
formerly. The "Bestimmungsmensur," as
it is called, is Considered, however, more
humane than foot ball in ,the United
States. No one is ever killed in a fencing
bout, while long lists of foot ball
victims appear in the papars every year.
Fencing is accepted as one of the best
forms of physical exercise, and develops
manliness as well as muscles, lungs and
hearts. A scar across the cheek of a
young man does not interfere with his
success in life, like injuries which frequently
disable, foot ball players.
Fencing bouts are therefore tolerated,
and, in some cases, encouraged by the
faculties. They are confined to the Corps,
are regulated by a strict code, and
supervised by older students, who do not
permit green men to participate and always
stop them before serious injury is
suffered.
The code will not permit a student to
semi or accept a challenge unless he has
reached a certain proficiency in the use
of the rapier. When blood is drawn on
either side the bout is over.
A surgeon is always present. Wounds
are promptly treated, and the eyes, heart,
lungs and other vital organs are protected.
One of the strongest arguments in favor
of tne fencing bout is that it puts all
students on an equal footing, A peasant
student can challenge a prince, and the
latter must fight or fiunk. The victory depends
upon personal worth and not upon
rank or money.
The scar left by a rapier is accepted
more promptly as a certificate of honor
and courage than a doctor's degree. Usually
commands entrance to all branches
of society.
Dissipation Still in Vogue.
While the drinking bouts that formerly
disgraced the German universities, are
practically abolished, and the habits of
students have improved, there is still
room for improvement. There are still
societies which compel their members. to
sacrifice their time and money, their
capacity for work, their scholarship
standing and their physical and moral
welfare in order to obey the injunctions
of a code which dates back to the seventeenth
century, the period of the greatest
depravity of student life.
These fraternities, however, now exist
only in Munich, Berlin and Bonn. Even
there the members maintain strictest
secrecy.
When the Prince Imperial of Germany
entered the University of Bonn the
kalMr arrnmnnnlpH him and asslslaH in
the Initiation of his son Into the Corps
and the drinking: club to which he had
belonged in his student days. Certain
newspapers published a story that father
and son, the present and the future sovereigns
of the German empire, drank
strong wine until they were stupefied and
fell senseless under the table, according
to the custom of the club.
This report was denied and denounced
with the greatest indignation. The author
of the printed story was expelled from
Germany. Whether there was any truth
in it or not, the publication directed attention
to the possibility of such a thing,
shocked the national conscience and has
done much toward its abolition.
Moral Tone Improving1.
Everybody agrees that the moral tone
of the student body in Germany has advanced
steadily during the last half century.
It is now unpopular to indulge in
habits that are beneath the dignity of
gentlemen, and intemperance and immorality
are considered sufficient ground
for exclusion from the Burschenschaften.
In Leipzig the influences are good.
While there is considerable dissipation
among students, it is no greater than at
Oxford. Cambridge, Harvard, Yale and
other city colleges in the United States.
The traditional German student of romance?a
dreamy, irresponsible individual
with long hair, a flowing necktie and a
cap of his Corps, who isabsorbed in a
trance part of his time and stupefied with
beer the rest?Is seldom seen these days
outside of the comic papers. But the inhabitants
of Leipzig are often entertained
by wild and reckless rushes and are
sometimes shoved off the sidewalk by
young rascals who imagine they must assert
their independence of character and
intellectual superiority by a show of insolence.
No Religious Obligations.
There are no official religious influences
at Leipzig or at any other berman unlTHE

Salt and the Spaniard.
From th? Century.
Until A few years ago no Spaniard had
on hia dining table any other receptacle
for salt than the old-style open cellar.
An enterprising Briton saw this, noted
that the salt was always dirty and gummy,
and determined to Introduce a certain
famous salt-shaker, from whicn
clean salt would run freely in the dampest
weather. Bravely he started to tour
Spain for the company.
"No, senor; no est costumbre usar mas
que esto" ("No, sir; It's not customary
to use more than that"?the old cella.).
was the answer of every dealer to whom
he presented the novelty. Again and
again he was rebuffed. He began to
despair when, standing one day gasing
into a Jeweler's window, a brilliant Idea
struck him. He entered. Realising the
ehildltke curiosity and impressionable
character of his quarry, he persuaded the
Jeweler to displayv a shaker in his win
versities. There are no chapel exercises | i
during the week days. Attendance at !
service Sunday is optional. 1
St. Paul's Church, connected with the
main university building, is a venerable I
and beautiful Gothic edifice, erected in
the thirteenth century and rebuilt in 18979SV
It was Luther's .church; is identified
with some of the most stirring incidents j
of the reformation; shelters the dust of
some of the most eminent theologians of
Germany, and is a holy place.
Members of the theological faculty take
their turns in preaching. There is no
regular pastor, and students are seldom
seen at the services except those from the
theological schools.
There are two English-American
churches in Leipzig, for the benefit of
American and British students and residents
of those nationalities. One is Episcopalian
and the other Scotch Presbyterian.
Both are poorly attended and depend
upon home contributions for support. It
would be better if they were to waive
their sectarian differences and amalgamate.
s
The Christian societies among the students
have little influence. The prevailing ^
vi niiiviig 111c iav<ui?j ??o
well as the students is materialistic. r
Each German university has its spe- c
cialties. Philology. mathematics and 1
philosophy were the features of Leipzig ^
for several centuries. Those chairs have
been occupied by some of the most eminent
scholars in Germany. Of late years
chemistry has received more attention. .
The Leipzig: mathematical faculties ,
have been famous since the days of Gott- ,
fried Wllhelm von Leibnitz, the inventor
of differential and integral calculus,
which have exasperated many an American
student. He was celebrated for the
universality of his genius, and established f
a standard in the University of Leipzig
which his successors have endeavored to .
maintain. J

Conservation of Perns. t
From the Boston Transcript. |
Vermont may yet seek to throw the
same protection over its ferns that it has
applied to its Christmas trees, but it may
have to wait until the constitutionality of t
its export tax is determined. Ferns are
literally stripped by the millions from the ]
mountainsides in some parts of the state
to supply the demands of florists. The
sum of $30,000 has been paid since the c
first of September to fern gatherers in
Woodford. Stamford, Searsburg and
Rcadsboro. As the going rate is 4 cents
a hundred, it follows that the shipments
from these four towns alone aggregated
50,000,000 ferns. Ferns can be carried In
cold c?torage all winter, and their sprays
are very valuable as backgrounds for
bouquets or loose cut flowers. The business
of gathering the ferns is rapidly being
organized, and' Vermonters do not
more than half like the advent of the
Greek pickers sent up from New York to
displace the children of the soil.
The Spruce Gum Diggers.
From the Kennebec Journal.
There will be a crusade in spruce gum
digging in the Maine woods this winter.
About twenty men will leave Skowhegan
within a short time to begin gum digging
operations near Jackman. Gum has
grown scarce in the last few years and
the demand is so great that it has become
a business to manv Maine men. r

A Spaniard came along, looked in the
window, saw the curious object, investigated.
"It is very pretty for the toilet table,"
he remarked, after prolonged scrutiny;
"perhaps useful for the children. What

Ind'flferently the jeweler glanced up
from some sribbling. "No, sir; only

But I don't know."
The simple gentleman was amased,

salt home with him. Ti.e Jeweler
ordered another shaker and more samples
of salt. By and by the gentleman had
used all his salt and wanted more of the

But the romance and adventure of
steamboat Hfe are not to be found in the
account books of the packet companies,
but rather among the passengers, who
gave color and variety to every trip. The

The upper Mississippi had a class of
gamblers all its own. Here the sharpers
were accustomed t<5

same time, nor did they ever recognize
each other. They became acquainted with
their victims individually and were introduced
to each ether by the deluded
settler on his way to the wheat fields of
Minnesota with the savings of a lifetime
in the east. The gamblers of. the
fifties were tolerated by the steamboat
owners because they were constant travelers
and promoted the bar business of
the boat,' alfliough they themselves kept
their own private bottles of colored water
to be served by the saloonkeeper Instead
of rum, which woiuld have shaken thetr
nerve and thus destroyed their "business'
perspicacity.
Steamboat racing gave variety and
spice to the life on the Mississippi. One
of the most thrilling contests was that
between the Grey Eagle and the Itasca,
on the upper Mississippi. This race is
Intimately connected with international
ichevement, as the followng facts show.
In 185i? the first cablegram across the
Atlantic bore greetings from Queen Victoria
to President Buchanan, who was at
the time in St. Paul. There was no telegraph
line to the Minnesota metropolis in
that day, but there were lines to Dunleith,
where the Grey Eagle was loading
for St. Paul, and at Prairie du Chien,
where the Itasca was about to cast off.
Both boats were due to leave at 6
>'clock. The Grey Eagle was sixty-one
niles further rrom St. Paul than the
Itasca, but Capt. Harris determined to
)e the first to deliver the message to the
President. He made only one or two
auuings during this record run. He pitcn>d
his mail bags to the wharves without
loing more than slowing down. As he
vas running far ahead of his schedule,
he mail bags for points up the river
vere not ready, so he did not have to
itop to take these on. The Itasca was
iroceeding leisurely on its way, uncontcious
of the efforts of its rival until
he latter- was seen to turn a bend in
he river, only a short distance behind.
Then the Itasca realized that the Grey
?agle meant to capture the honor of
>eing the first to deliver the message to
he President. Then it was a race for
ife for the few remaining miles to St.
^aul, the Grey Eagle winning by a bare

steamers installed a calliope, and for a
brief period Its popularity was exceptional,

All of the students together drew out t
for use outside the Yale library a total a
of 23,826 volumes. Call it an even 24,000 a
and we have 600 books a week drawn out, J
or 100 a day, by, say, 3,000 students. One p
way of looking at it is that each day d
2,000 boys do not go to the library for a I1
bcok and 100 do go there for that pur- ?
pose. ? It may be added that if p
anything like one boy In thirty draws tl
regularly from the Yale library, then that ti
valuable branch of the university is do- s
lng more work than formerly. n

RULING ON "CONSPIRACY"
IMS INTEREST
May Have Effect in Arguments
in Standard Oil and Tobacco
Cases.
Coming on the eve of the reargument of
the dissolution suits against the Standard
Oil and tobacco corporations, the decision
last Monday by the Supreme Court of the
i'nlted States that a conspiracy under the
Sherman anti-trust law may be a "continuing
offense" has aroused new interest
In the forthcoming legal contest.
The court delivered this decision in the
Kissel case. Almost immediately after
Justice "Holmes announced the conclusion
of the court requests began to pour in for
copies of the decision. One man wanted
twenty-five copies, another ten. and
?nough requests for single copies have
t>een received at the court to exhaust
many times the fifty copies printed.
While the question of a conspiracy unier
the Sherman anti-trust act being con-,
tinuing did not become the leading issue
n either the Standard Oil or the tobacco
corporations, it figured in the argument
in both cases. It was more prominent in
he Standard Oil suit. Just what effect
he Kissel decision will have cn the presentation
of the cases to the court is a
natter of much speculation among corporation
lawyers in the capital. It is
mown that the attorneys on both sides
ire preparing to give close study to the
principles which guided the court in ar Iving
at the unanimous conclusion in retard
to the continuing character of a conspiracy.
What Effect May Be.
It is said that the dectsion may have
in appreciable effect on the argument as
:o what weight should bo given the acts
if the corporation before the Sherman
inti-trusl law wae passed. In the first
irguments of the Standard Oil case counlel
for that corporation contended that
:he alleged rebates and alleged unlawful
exclusion of competitors from the trade
vere not to be considered at all because
hey could uct be violations of a law not
u existence. On the other hand', the representatives
of the government argued
hat these allegations were very maerial,
that they showed .the "continuaion"
of the alleged conspiracy formed in
.870, and brought it down to the time of
he operation of the act.
It has been suggested that the court
nay have completed its consideration of
he Kissel case with more than ordinary
speed in oider to get the holding before
he country for the guidance of counsel
n urgu ng the big corporation cases immediately
aft r New Year, This applies
particularly to the statement in the opin
on that a conspiracy is constituted by an
igreement. to be sure, but the conspiracy
is the result of the agreement rather
han the agreement itslf. just as a partiersh<p,
although constituted by a conTact.
is not the contract, but is the reiUlt
of it."
Anthropologist Among Savages.
"rom the Loqdoa Globe.
An Italian anthropologist. Dr. Modigliml.
lecturing on the people of the Menavei
archipelago in the Indian ocean,
ecently showed a beautiful example of
attoolng on his right hand, and thia is
low he accounted for it:
"I had landed on one of the islands with
l few men. I was soon surrounded by
in angry people and captured. I was
aken to the neighboring village, little
mowing what fate awaited me. I soon
ilacated my hosts with coolness and a
ew presents. I pretended great joy to be
itnong them, and affirmed that I had no
lesire to escape. They believed me, and
nade me an honorary citizen, tattooing
ne with the mark of the tribe."
Dr. Modigliani says that one evening at
lioban his hosts saw him take off his
>oots. They at once came to the concluion
that he had unscrewed his feet. On
.nother occasion he instructed one of
lis men to feign illness. The man fell
o the ground and the doctor took a
ilaster cast of his face. When it was
one the "patient" appeared to be cured,
forthwith the natives brought all their
ick to be treated. As a preliminary to
he cure the doctor took a cast of each
iatient's face; after that, and only after
he cast had been taken, was clincal
reatment adopted. Generally it was a
uccess. and loud were the praises of the
atives of the skill of the white doctor.

rhe rain tree of Peru grows very large, J
rich In leaves and Is called by the In- ^
ins tamalcaspi. It has the power of j,
llecting the dampness of the atmosere
and condensing It Into a continuous i
d copious supply of rain. '
In the dry season when the rivers are 1
v and the heat great the tree's power
condensing seems at the highest, and s
iter falls in abundance from the leaves a
d oozes from the trunk. The water c
reads around in veritable rivers, part .
which tllters Into the soil and fertilises .
These rivers are canalised so as to F
pilate the course of the water. J
t Is estimated that one of the Peruvian J]
in trees will on the average yield nine "
lions of water per diem. In a field of
area of one kilometer square?that Is.
SO feet each way?can be grown 10,000
