matic departments, the latter containing but
one of the under secretaries of the Austrian
legation and three lady friends. The desk of
the presiding officer was decorated by a very
handsome pyramid bouquet, and Senators
Voorhees, Beck, Blodgett, Daniel and Pugh
had before them nature's emblems of the es
teem of friends.
THE OPENING PRAYER.
As the minute-hand overtook the hour-indi
cator on the dial of the clock facing him, Mr.
Ingalls let fall the gavel, and Chaplain Butler
opened the proceedings with prayer. He re
turned thanks for the bountiful blessings
vouchsafed the land in its material interests,
and remembered President-elect Harrison in
his petition. One of the Senators, who could
not be distinguished in the throng. Joined with
the chaplain in repeating the Lord's Prayer at
the close.
C READY FOB BUSINESS.
A few moments were spent in greetings
among the Senators, and then Senator Sher
man offered the usual resolution that the secre
tary notify the House that the Senate is ready
to proceed to business. The resolution was
adopted, as was, also, one offered by Mr.
Morrill for the appointment of a committee to
notify the President that the Senate is ready to
receive any communication he may have to
make. Messrs. Morrill and Saulsbury compose
I this committee. Mr. Cameron offered a reso
lution that the Senate meet daily until further
ordered at 12 m. Adopted.
At 12:47. on motion of Mr. Sherman, the
Senate took a recces for h:ilf an hour.
The recess was further extended to 1:30.
At the conclusion of the recess, the usual
message from the House, announcing the fact
of its being in session and of its having ap
Sointed a committee to wait upon the Presi
ent was delivered?it having been delayed in
consequence of the recess.
READING THE MES8AOE.
That was followed by a report from the com
mittee to wait on the President to the effect
that it had performed that duty and that the
President would communicate in writing im
mediately. And then the President's mes
sage was delivered bv Mr. Pruden, one of bis
secretaries, and Mr. McCook. the secretary of
the Senate proceeded to read it.
The Senate adjourned at 2:50. ?
House of Representatives.
Long before the hour for the meeting of
the second session of the Fiftieth Congress the
galleries of the House (with the exception of
those galleries reserved for the President and
his friends and for the diplomatic corps) were
filled with spectators, and the bright dresses
of the ladies formed a brilliant frame to the
picture presented on the floor below. There
handshaking was indulged in. and congratula
tions on re-election or condolences on defeat
were exchanged among the members. Of
course the recent election was the chief topic
of conversation, but there was no bitter feel
ing manifested, jocose raillery on the part of
the repubUcaus, ;iud patient resignation on the
Dart of the democrats being everywhere evi
dent. The republicart members who are
promineutlv mentioned in connection with the
speakership of this Fiftv-flr.it Congress came
in tor an extra share of felicitations?it being
generally conceded on the floor that the next
House will be republican by from 3 to 7 ma
jority. The speaker s desk was ornamented
with a handsome floral piece, while other I
prominent members were not forgotten by
their friends, and numerous floral designs
added a pleasing feature to the scene.
CONGRATULATING MR. RANPAI.L.
When Mr. Randall (Pa.) entered the cham
ber, which he did at a few moments before noon,
he was surrounded by his friends desirous of
expressing their pleasure at seeing him once
more able to resume his congressional duties.
CALLED TO ORDER.
At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of the gavel
stilled the tumult which yisted ill the hall, and
silence reigned while Dr. MilbdTn, the chap
lain. offered prayer, in which he blessed God
??that since the adjournment of the last session
not a member of this House has been called
away bv death, and that the representatives of
the people are returned to their seats in safety,
peace and health."
Th<5 roll of members was then called, and the
hum of conversation broke out afresh. During
the progress of the call
MRS. CLEVELAND ENTERED THE EXECUTIVE GAL
LERY
and became an attentive spectator. The call
developed the presence of 236 members?there
being 88 absentees.
An motion of Mr. Mills, of Texas, a resolution
was adopted directing the clerk to inform the
Senate that a quorum of the House had ap
peared. aud that the House was ready to pro
ceed to business.
j COMMITTEE TO WAIT OS THE PRESIDENT.
' In accordance with a resolution (adopted on
I motion of Mr. Holman. of Indiana.) the Speaker
appointed Messrs. Holman (Ind.), Turner (Ga.),
and O'Neill (Fa.), us a committee to join a
'similar committee appointed by the Senate, to
wait upon the President anil inform him that
I Congress was ready to receive any communico
| tion he might desire to transmit.
The House then at 12:30 took a recess for
an hour.
THE MESSAGE.
After the recess, Mr. Holman announced that
the committee appointed to wait upon the
President hud performed that duty, and that
the President would communicate with the
Congress forthwith.
Mr. Pruden, of the President's secretaries,
was then announced, and the annual message
was delivered to the House and immediately
read by the clerk.
HOW TUB READING Or THE TARIFF CLAUSE WAS
RECEIVED.
That portion of the message in which the
President treats of the tariff question was
listened to attentively by members on both
sides of the House. Now and then a
smile, more of triumph than of derision,
would appear upon the face of some enthu
siastic republican, but the silence was not
broken until the clerk read in a clear voice:
''The cause for which the battle is waged
is comprised within lines clearly and distinctly
deflnei It should nevef be compromised. It
is the people's cause."
Then the democrats could no longer restrain
their feelings, and broke into a round of ap
plause which was answered by the republicans
with derisive laughter.
The President's reference to the Saokville
West incident provoked a laugh from the re
Sublican side of the House, but no counter
emosstratiou was made by the democrats.

BTT.ICTLT lU'SIXEHM.
The republicans seem to feel that the world
is theirs, and the democrats give no indication
of present disposition to dispute the claim.
The general idea seems to be that this is to be
i a business session, and the republicans < xjM-ct
to devote themselves chiefly in preparing for
their turn. It is pretty generally held among
republicans that
AX EXTRA SESSION
soon after this Congress expires is, to say the
least, not improbable, and the indications are
that there is to be a pretty hot contest over the
speakership. The members are already taking
bides, and thorn- from states honored by the
possession of candidates are working for their
favorite son. The Michigan men are
sure Burrows is going to win. The
Illinois members have as much confi
dence in Cannon as a dead shot. The
New Englanders will have nothing but Reed,
and there are men from the Biickeye state who
think Ohio can never be l>eat. The republicans
expect to pass the direct tax bill, and think the
.S uatc may pass their tariff bill, though this
they all admit is subject to doubt. They say
further that they are noticing to prevent the
democrats from" admitting the territories
unless they let Dakota, in as two states.
HARRISON'S CABINET.
<iosMp at the CspHol-Mr. lllalan and
the State Department.
Senators and Representative? are very sensi
tive. as a rule, about mentioning Mr. Harrison s
cabinet making. There ore more me n in the
field ambitious for cabinet honors even than
have been suggested. The New York situation
calls for considerable quiet discussion, and
men familiar with the situation there say that
Piatt has the better chance if it is to be a con
test for honors between him and Warner Mil
ler. If one is to be presented by New York for
the cabinet they say it will be Piatt. Some
think both may go in.
It is quite evident to any one who talks with
Mr. Bl tine's close friends that they do not pro
pose to see him turned down. They want kiiy
to go into the State department, aud if he does
not there are likely to bo some very angry citi
zens. Several prominent Irishmen who sup
ported Harrison at Blaine's solicitation are
prepared to be deeply affronted if the Maine
stat, sman doe* not get the recognition they
think he ought to receive.
A Stab reporter talked this morning with a
man who was with Mr. Blaine yesterday.
He says that he knows Mr. Blaine hsu not yet
received any intimation that Mr. Harrison "in
tends to call on him as an adviser. Mr. Blame
is as iguorunt of Mr. Harrison's intentions as is
any private citizen.
His friends expect him to go into the cabinet.
Further than that none of them know. It is
most probable that he would accept an invita
tion to manage the State department.
THK TUNNEL SOl'NDKR.
HI* Testimony Before the Military Court
To-day as to Bad Tunnel Work.
The military court of inquiry on the charac
ter of the tunnel work resumed its session at
10:30 this morning. Andrew J. Sparrow, who
was employed by Major Lydccker to make
soundings in the tunnel, was on the stand. He
commenced' at Champlain avenue shaft and
sounded 2.400 feet cast, nearly the same dis- |
twice west, aud 400 feet from University shaft. ;
Witness had a record of his soundings and read '
to the court extracts from it showing his sys
tem of marking the character of the different
parts of the tunnel lining. Openings were
made at various point*, the first 150 feet east
from Champlain avenue shaft. Witness read
to the court his notes as to the condition of the
work showu bv these openings, which did not
differ materially from what had Ix en found
previously by Lieut. Townsend. The general
character of the work was frequently designated
as "bad" or "very bad."'
BIO CAVITIES.
One cavity was found west from Champlain
avenue shaft over 90 feet long and 8 feet wide,
another was 20 feet long and 1C feet wide. Wit
ness had not examined any of the lining in
Howard university shaft. The holes made
were from the soundings and not from any in
formation furnished as to where the cavities
could be found. The witness stated that 95
per cent of his soundings had been verified by
the examination through the openings. At the
conclusion of the examination of witness, at
HUM) o'clock, the court resumed the reading of
the record. It could not be stated whether the
examination of witnesses would be continued
to-morrow or not.

ing ia marked by an interesting and impressive
incident. With |he expiration of tbe present
aeasiou of the Coiigrwa, the drat rrntarr of
onr constitutional existence as a nation will ba
completed. Oar survival for one hundred
year* is not sufficient to assure as that we bo
longer have dangi rs to fear in the maintenance,
with ull its promised blessings, of a govern
ment founded upon the freedom of the people.
The time rather admouishes us to soberly in
quire whether in the past we hare always
closely kept in the course of safety, and
whether we hsve before us a way plaiu and
clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity.
Uhen the experiment of our government was
nndcrtakcn, the chsrt adopted lor our guid
ance was the constitution. Departure from
the lines there laid down is fsilore. It is only
by a strict adherence to the direction they in
dicate and by restraint within the limitation
they hi. that we csn furnish proof to tbs
world of the titneaa of the American people for
self-government
The canal and exact justice of which are
hoart s* the underlving principle of our insti
tutions. should not V confined to the relations
of our citizens to each other. The government
itself is under bond to the American people,
that in the exercise of its functions and powers
it will deal with the body of our citizens in ?
manner scrupulously honest and fan and abso
lutely just. It has agreed thst Amemau citi
zenship shall be the only credential necessary
to justify the claim of equality before the law',
and thst no condition in life shall give rise to
discrimination in the treatment of the people
by their government.
OKE HfNKRED TEAKS SOO.
The citizen of our republic in its early dayo
rigidly insisted upon full compliance with tbe
letter of this bond, and saw stretching out bo
fore him a clear Held for individual endeavor.
His tribute to the support of his government
was measured by the coat of its economical
maintenance, and he was secure ia the enjov
ment of the remaining recompense of bis
steady and contented toil. In those days the
frugality of the people was stamped upon their
government, and was enforced bv the free,
thoughtful, and intelligent suffrage'of the citi
zen. Combinations, monopolies, and aggrega
tions of capital were either avoided or sternly
regulst<>d and restrained. The pomp and gl?
ter of governments less free offered no tempta
tion and presented no delusion to tbe pUm
people who. side by tide, in friendly competi
tion wrought for tbe ennoblement aiid dignity
of man. for the solut' -n of the problem of free
government, and for the achievement of the
grand destiny awaiting the land which Qod had
given them.
A century has passed. Our cities are the
abiding places of wealth and luxury; our man
ufactories yield fortuues never dreamed of by
the fathers of the republic; our business men
are nuully striving in the race for riches, and
immense aggregations of capital outrun the
imagination in the magnitude of their under
taking*. We view with priae and satisfaction
this bright picture of onr country's growth and
prosperity, while only a closer sorauny de
velops
& 80KT1KK KHAMN0.
Upon more careful inspection we And the
wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with
poverty and wretchedness and unrewunerati ve
toil. A crowded and constantly increasing
urban |>opulation suggests the impoverishment
of rural sections and discontent w ith agricul
tural pursuits. The farmer's son. not satisfied
with liis father's simple and laborious life,
joins the eager chaae for easily-acquired wealth.
We discover that the fortunes realized by
our manufacturers are no longer solely the re
ward of sturdy industry and enlightened fore
sight. but that they result from the discrimi
nating favor of the government, and are largely
built upon uri'lu'- exactions from the masses of
our people. The gulf between employers and
the employed is constantly w >ning and
classes are rapidly forming* on< 'omprising
the very rich and powerful, while in another
are found the toiling poor. As we view the
achievements of aggregated capital, we dw
cover the existence of
TBIXT*. COMBINATIONS. AND ?OKOPOUM,
while the citizen is struggling far in the rear
or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.
Corporations, which should be the carefully
restrained creature* of the law and the serv
ants of the people, are fast becoming the peo
ple'* masters. Still congratulating Ourselveu
upon the wealth and prosperity of our country,
and complacently contemplating every incident
of change inseparable from these conditions. it
is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire, at
the present stage of our progress, how toe bond
of the government made with the people has
been kept and performed.
atari.c* axd tariik
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn ftot
our citizena, to the necessities of its economi
cal administration, the government persists in
exscting, from the substance of the people,
millions which unapplied and uaeleea lie dor*
mant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice
and this breach of faith and obligation add to
extortion the danger attending the diversion of
the currency of tbe oountrv from the legitimate
channels of business. Under the nne laws by
which these results are produced, the govern
ment permits many million* more to be adided
to the cost of the living of our people and ta
be taken from our consumers, which nnreaeon
ably swell the profits of a small but powerful
minority. Tbe people mast still be taxed for
the support of the government under the opera
tion of tariff laws, fiat to the extent that the
mass of our citizens ere inordinately burdened
beyond any useful public parpoas, and for the
benefit of a favored few, the g
under pretext of an exercise
power, enter* gratuitously into w
with these favorites, to their advantage and to
the injury of a vast majority of oar people.
This is not equality before tbe law. The
existing situation is injurious to tbe health of
our entire body-politic. It stifles, in those far
ee benefit it ia furiitt*d, all patriotic love
wboae I _
of country, and substitutes in its'piece self..,
greed and grasping avarice. Devotion to
American citueuship far it* ewn sake and for
what it *hould accomplish as a motive to our
our people, is displaced by ths aaMunpttoo that
the government, instead of beiag the embodi
ment of equality, i* but an instrumentality
through which (special and individual advan
are to be gained. The arraganee of thn
