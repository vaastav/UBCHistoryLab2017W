The President goes straight to the
mark, on the anarchist question, and
gets there. As they are avowed
enemies of society and government
they should be outlawed.
The President advocates the Monroe

proven so ever since it was first ad
vocated by President Monroe. And we
will maintain it as a peace measure, if

The President has nothing to say in
his message, of any foreign nation but
China. The rest of them are behaving I
themselves towards' Uncle Sam. The
message was to Americans.'.
In every point of his message the
President shows himself thoroughly
conversant with the world's history,
our country's relation to other nations,
and the home questions that most con
cern us as a people; and he treats of
all points with remarkable wisdom.

The President in his message, says
there have been 6,000 rural mail
routes established, that there will be
8,000 by the close of the fiscal year, and
that applications are filed for 6,000
more. - The mail will be carried by

Gen. Anderson, the commandant of
the Sandusky Soldiers' Home, in his
annual report to the Governor says:
"Forty-nine out of fifty of the members
of the Home are well behaved and self

They are the surviving conscripts and
coffee coolers of the war." ine aver
age per capita expense of the institu
tion is $162.09. The total number of
soldiers at the home the past year was
1614. The number of deaths during
the year was 115. The average age is

' Studebaker's millions all go to his
own family nothing for benevolence
nor charity. How much better, if he
had looked upon the worthy poor and
infortunate in his own city, and in the
language of the old song had said
"jump into my wagon and we'll all
take a ride,"
; There were some politicians and
some statesmen, some newspaper men.
and some business men, who were fear
ful lest the President would say some
thing rash or too radical in his mes
sage, that would injure the party,
alarm capital or disturb the business
interests of the country.
: They seemed to have some idea that
Mr. Roosevelt was a cowboy who car
ried a lasso on his arm ready to lasso
any vagary that ran athwart the pub
lic mind, or they looked upon him as
veritable bull in a china shop. They
neither knew the man nor his record,
or they would have recognized him as
one of the most level-headed men in
the country, who knows how to be in
dependent and fearless, without being
rash, and who knows bow to be conser
vative without beingr timid or truck
ling. .
But they are all rejoicing now, and
are joining in the universal expression
of praise of the new President's first
State paper.
Congressmen ran a race to the White
House to see.who could speak . the first
good - work and say the nicest things
about the message. Newspapers all
over the country have showered the
President with bouquets, and the En
glish and German press say fine things
of the message.
Now this is all because the President
is a correct and Independent thinker, a
man not afraid to speak his convic
tions, who has the happy faculty of
expressing his mind forcibly, and who
yet remembers that bis are great
responsibilities, and that he is treating
of topics that vitally concern the wel
fare and happiness of 75,000,000 people.
It is therefore 'a good message; it is
his, and he is getting only deserved
credit for It.
Topics Treated in the Message,
Assassination of Mr. McKinley.
Suppression of anarchy.
Our unprecedented prosperity.
Growth of financial combines.
Methods of controlling trusts.

activity, the ' session of the Board of
Trade today came very near setting a
new marie rtuslness in all grain was
booming, and the wild rush of traders
made the scene spectacular in many
respects. v .. .
But there was more to it than the
noise and flurry. Under the pressure
of liberal buying orders from every
where, prices went soaring. Corn, for
delivery next Mav, sold at 67c, which
is an advance of lio since yesterday,
and which sets a new record price for
the season. May oats took a material
upshoot and also touched a new high
point by selling at 45ic. -
May wheat sold at 79Jo, which, while
not a record, is near it,
There was nothing artificial about
the strength in corn and oats. In both
markets it has followed a heavy de
mand from the consumers. Oats were
stronger of the cc

' No Corner Anywhere.
The peculiar part of the phenomenal
rise is that there does not appear to be
any corner on the market in any of the
grains dealt in. In terior buying, ai ded
by the. drought in the winter wheat
area, and this alone, is responsible for
the excitement ' in the market,
say the brokers who are dealing
in. the grains. . Some buying has
been going on for weeks by an East
ern, syndicate, through J. 1. Harris
and J. H. Wrenn, two of the biggest
firms in Chicago,' but it is not thought
that sufficient quantities of the grain
have been secured to constitute a cor
ner.
Mayor James A. Patton, of Evanston,
is one of the men pointed out as among
the most fortunate operators in the
present rise. It is understood that he
holds nearly 12,000,000 bushels of oats,
and that the present price Is some
seven cents above the quotations at
which he bought.
Profit of $800,000.
According to- the figuring of the
brokers, this would give him a tidy
profit of upward of $800,000.
The drought in the Southwest, the
great winter wheat belt, is also held to
be large factor, in the rise of the
cereals. AU through this area the
primary markets have been buying
grain, while their visible supply has
correspondingly decreased.
Not a little of the present excitement
(a caused by the presence of wealthy
cattlemen in Chicago to attend the live
stock convention. Many of them have
beenheavy buyers, and it is thought
that they have been arguing from con
ditions in tbelr own districts, with
which they are most familiar.

A painter from Boda-Pesth, who
was out of work and out of money, 'but
who had got as far as Hamburg, er-
maov, on his way to America, got a
shipping bill for a box to be sent to an
ocean steamer, hired a drayman to call
at his room for the box, paid the
drayman's fee, then fastened himself
in the box, where he had stored food
and drink, and came across the ocean
on a steamer as freight. But it was
fifteen days before he was discovered,
and he was nearly starved to death
when found. It is hoped he may re
cover, and parties have interested
themselves is get work for him.
All that the President has to say of
Trusts, is not found under that division
of his message. In treating of the In
terstate Commerce law he says:
The act should be amended. The
railway is a public servant. Its rates
should be just to and open to all ship
pers alike. The Government should
see to it that within its jurisdiction
this is so and should provide a speedy,
inexpensive and effective remedy to
that end."
When railroad rates are made just to
and open to all shippers alike, a heavy
blow will have been struck at Trusts
In legislating against them, this is one
of the first measures that should be
adopted. If Trusts could not secure
special rates and accommodations of
railroads, and control railroad traffic,
competition would have a show, and
small factories and interests would have
chance- It would be Impossible to
,cruah them out.
There was a wild scene on the New
York Exchange, Tuesday.- The Gov
ernments report of a heavy shortage on
the cotton crop, ' advanced the price 45
ooints; the market then dropped about
22 points, but subsequently advanced
to 45, and as men made and lost thous
ands of dollars, pandemonium reigned
in the pit.
The President's endorsement of the
Peace Conference at the Hague, and
his hope that the day is not far distant
when war will be impossible, shows as
it has always been manifest in our
country, that our military captains are
the most earnest advocates of peace.
War, like slavery, is a relic of barbar
ism. In barbarism it is often neces
sary. In civilized life it should be
forever abolished.
Monnett, it is said, is opposed to
Roosevelt's plan of dealing with
Trusts. Monnett sees more than any
body else sees if he sees a plan in it.
The President advises that combines
and trusts be compelled to make pub
lic their business, so that all that is evil
in their affairs may be found out and
corrected, but that is not a plan. The
plans will come after the methods of
the trusts are found out. The Presi
dent advised amending the inter-state
commerce law, so as to secure absolute
