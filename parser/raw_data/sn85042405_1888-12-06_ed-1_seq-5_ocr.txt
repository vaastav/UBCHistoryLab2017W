Th« Interior Department.
In the report of the secretary of the
Interior, which will be laid before you,
the eppdition of the various branches of
^domestic affairs connected with that
sent and its operations during
the past year are fully exhibited. But a
brief reference to some of the subjects
discussed in this able and interesting re­
port can here be made, but I commend
the entire report to the attention of the
congress and trust that the sensible and
valuable recommendations it contains
liill secure careful considerations. I
I cannot but strenuously insist upon the
(iinportance of proper "measures to issue
/frightdisposition of our public lands,
pot only as a matter of justice, but in
forecast of the consequeuces to future
-generations. The broad, rich acres of
fL our agricultural, plains have been long
lj
1
preserved by nature to become her un
trammeled gifts to a peoplf civilized and
free, upon which should rest in well dis­
tributed ownership, the numerous
homes of enlightened, equal and fra­
ternal citizen. They came to national
possession with the warning example in
our eyes of the entail of iniquities in
landed proprietoship which other coun­
tries have permitted and still suffer.
Laws which open the doors to fraudu
lent acquisition or administration which
permits favor to rapacious seizure by a
Favored few of expanded areas that
many should enjoy are accessory to
offenses against the welfare of human­
ity not to be too severely condemned or
punished. It is gratifying to know hat
noni"th»ng has been done at last to re­
dress the injuries to our people and
check the perilous tendency of the reck­
less waste of national domain, that over
80,000,000 acres have been arrested from
illegal usurpers, improvident grants and
fraudulent entries and claims to be taken
for the homesteads of honest industry—
although less than the greater areas thus
unjustly l09t—must afford a profound
gratification to right feeling citizens, as
it is a recompense for the labors and
struggles for the recovery. Our dear
expenence ought sufficiently to urge the
speedy enactment of measures of legisla­
tion which will confine the future dis­
position of our remaining agricultural
lands to the uses of actual husbandry
and genuine homes.
Nor should our vast tracts of so-called
desert lands be yielded up to the mon
opoly of corporations or grasping indi­
viduals, as appears to be much the
tendency under the existing statute.
These lands require but the supply of
water to become fertile and productive.
It is a problem of great moment how
much wisely for the public good that
factor shall be furnished. I cannot but
think it perilous to suffer either these
lands or the sources of their irrigation
to fall into the hands of monopolies
which by such means may exercise lord­
ship over areas dependent on their treat­
ment for productiveness.

•~m
tion continues to improve and the proofs
multiply that the transforming change
is much to be desired which shall substi­
tute for barbarism enlightenment, and
civilizing education is in favorable pro­
cess. Our relations with these people
during rhe year have been disturbed by
no serious disorder, but rather marked
by a better realization of their true in­
terests and increasing confidence and
good will. These conditions testify to
the value of higher tone of consideration
and humanity which has governed the
later methods of dealing with them and
commend its continued observance.
Allotments in severalty have been made
on some reservations until all those en­
titled to land thereon have had their
shares assigned and the work is still con­
tinued. In directing the execution of
this duty I have not aimed so much at
rapid dispatch as to secure just and fair
arrangements which shall best conduce
to the objects of the law, by producing
satisfaction with the results of allotments
made. No measure of general effect has
ever been entered on from which more
may be fairly hoped, if it shall be dis­
creetly administered. It proffers oppor­
tunity and inducement to that inde­
pendence of spirit and life which the
Indian peculiarities need, while at the
same time the inalienable of title affords
security against the risks his inexperi­
ence of affairs or weakness of charac­
ter may expose him to in dealing with
others. Whenever begun upon any
reservation it should be made complete
so that all are brought to the same con­
dition, and as soon as possible com­
munity in lands should cease by open­
ing such as remain unallotted to settle­
ment. Contact with the ways of in­
dustrious and successful farmers will,
perhaps, add a healthy emulation which
will both instruct and stimulate, but no
agency for the amelioration of this peo­
ple appears to me so promis­
ing as the extension urged by the
secretary of such complete fa­
cilities of education as shall, at the ear­
liest possible day, embrace all teachable
Indian youths of both sexes, and retain
them with a kindly and beneticient hold
until their characters are formed, and
their faculties and dispositions trained
to the same pursuit of some form of use­
ful industry. The capacity of the Indian
no longer needs demonstration. It is es­
tablished it remains to make the most
of it, and when it shall be done the curse
will be lifted.
The average attendance of Indian pu­
pils in the schools increased by over 900
during the year, and the total enrollment
reached 15,Sl3. The -cost of mainten­
ance was not materially raised. The
number of teachable Indian youth is now
estimated at 40,00"), or nearly three times
the enrollment of the schools. It is be­
lieved the obstacles in the way of in­
structing all are surmountable, and that
the necessary expenditure would be a
measure of economy.
OpeiiliiK Jle.HervatioiiH.
The Sioux tribes on the great reserva­
tion of Dakota refused to assent to the
act passed by the congress at its last ses­
sion for opening a portion of their lands
to their.settlement, notwithstanding not­
ification of the terms was suggested
which met most of their objections.
Their demand is for immediate payment
of the full price of $1.25 per acre for the
entire body of land the occu­
pancy of which they are asked
to "relinquish. The manner of
snbmission insured their fair
understanding of tho law .and their action
was no doubt as thoroughly intelligent
as their capacity admitted. It is at least
gratifying that no reproach or over­
reaching can in any manner be made
against the government, however advis­
able the favorable completion of the ne­
gotiations may have been esteemed. I
concur in the suggestions of the secre­
tary regarding the Turtle mountain In­
dians, the two reservations in California
and the Crees. They should, in my
opinion, receive immediate attention.
Pensions.
The number of pensioners added to the
list during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1888, is 00,252, and increase of pensions
was granted in 45,716 cases. The names
of 15,730 pensioners were dropped from
the rolls during the year for various
causes and, at the close of the year, the
number of persons of all classes receiv­
ing pensions was 452,557. Of these
there were 806 survivors of the war of
1812. 10,787 widows of those who served
in that war, 10,000 soldiers of the Mexi­
can war, and 5.104 widows of said
soldiers. One hundred and two differ­
ent rates of pensions are paid to these
beneficiaries, ranging from $2 to 10.60
per month. The amount paid for pen­
sions during the liscal year was $78,
775,861.91, being an increase over
preceeding year of $5,308.230.22.
The expenses attending the mainten­
ance and operation cf the pension
bureau during that perion was $i},262,
574.67, making the entire expenditures
of the bureau $82,088,886.07 being 21 1-2
per cent of the total expenditures of
government during the year.
ItevUion of Pentiiou Lairt.
I am thoroughly convinced that our
general pension laws should be revised
and adjusted to meet as far as possible,
in the light of our experience, all meri­
torious cases. The fact that 102 differ­
ent rates of pensions are paid cannot,
in my opinion, be made consistent with
justice to the pensioners or to the gov­
ernment, and the numerous private
pension bills that are passed predicated
upon the imperfection of general laws,
while they increase in many cases ex­
isting in equality and injustice lend ad­
ditional force to the recommendation
for a revision of the general laws on this
subject. The laxity of ideas prevailing
among a large number of our people re­
garding pensions is becoming every day
more marked. The principles upon
which they should be granted are in
danger of "being altogether ignored, and
already pensions are often claimed be­
cause the applicants are as much en­
titled as other successful applicants,
rather than upon any disability reason­
ably attributed to military service. If
the establishment of various precedents
be continued if the granting of pensions
be not divorced from partisan and other
unworthy and irrevelant considerations,
and if the honorable name of veteran
unfairly becomes by these means but
another term for one who constantly
clamors for the aid of the government,
there is danger that injury will le done Savannah. The Louis also drove the
to the fame and patriotism of many
whom our citizens all delight to honor,
and that a prejudice will be aroused un­
just to meritorious applicants for {ten­
sions.

some counties in New York,New Jersey,
Delaware and Maryland, are mentioned,
and the president refers to the beneficial
results of state co-operation with the fed­
eral authorities in the extirpation of the
disease, and advises the continuance and
wide diffusion of the principle.
Favorable reference is made to the dif­
fusion process in making sugar from
sorghum and from the Louisiana cane.
The experimental station system of the
department is commended, as is the pre­
vention of food adulteration by the
scientific investigations of the bureaus.
The president counsels early attention
to the relations between the government
and the land grant railroads, and ex­
presses the opinion that an extension of
time for the payment of their indebted­
ness would be of advantage to the gov­
ernment, and the subject should be
treated as a business proposition.

of Columbia the president states that af­
fairs are in a satisfactory condition, and
he calls attention to the request of the
commissioners for legislation which will
enable them to properly arrange the laws
so that they can be made distinctly
operative.
In C'oncluslou.
The message concludes as follows:
As public servant# we shall do our
duty well if we constantly guard the
rectitude of our intentions, maintain un­
sullied our love of our country, and with
unselfish purpose strive for the public
good.

COMMENTS.
Whnt Senators and Republinan* H*v« to
Suy About the Message.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—Some of the
comments on the president's message,
obtained from senators and representa­
tives by a representative of the United
Press are given below:
Mr. liaor—About all lean say is that it
embodies the utterances of a disap­
pointed politician.
Mr. Sherman—There is nothing strik­
ing about the last part of it. Tfie first
part I did not heaj.
Mr. Cullom—Of necessity he dies
game on his tariff views, and his refer­
ence to internal affairs runs into a great
scold.
Mr. Manderson—1 was not particu­
larly struck with what I heard of the
message. I can say, however, that if
Mr. Cleveland will visit the Northwest
after he has more leisure, he will Snd
that our farmers do not indorse his
utterances on the tariff question.
Mr. Coekrell—I cannot say much about
the message until I shall have read it
over. GeneriRlv speaking, it impressed
me very favorably.
Mr. Ransom—I think it was like all of
Mr. Cleveland's public communications
have been, a very able and concisely
framed instrument.
The following opinions, expressed by
prominent members of the hoti&e of ru
resentatives, represent the views of Re­
publicans and Democrats on the presi­
dent's message:
Mr. Snowden (Pa.), Dem.—The mes­
sage is all right, except the tariff portion.
The farmers of this country in the last
election out a veto on the president's
idea. They know that what betters the
wage work ens' condition enhances the
price of their products, and they voted
accordingly.
Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky,
(Detu.)—The president keeps in view the
fact that it is a fight between monopoly
and labor, and he is on the side of labor.
Mr. Weaver, of Iowa, (Ind.)—The
president's position on the tariff is just
the right thing, but I am sorry he saw
fit to recommend a suspension of silver
coinage.
Said by tlie New York Pre**.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—The Sun says of
the president's message: "I am right
and the country is wrong." It is an aim­
less and inconsequential document.
The Press says it is the effort of a shal­
low demagogue to create ill feeling be­
tween classes.
The Tribune says it is an attempt to
stir up anarchy by pandering to igno­
rance and passion."
The Herals says that Mr. Cleveland's
remarks are sensible and well put, but
his is the voice of one crying in the wil­
derness. The people have elected a party
which favors monopolistic combinations
the
an(l
t'iey do not care enough about the
evil effects of the system to change it.
The Times thinks the president has
somewhat overstated the case, but the
message contains an amount of undeni­
able truth to which the country will be
compelled to give attention.
The World says the message is a dig­
nified, clear, compact and forcible state
paper. If issued three years ago and
followed in 1876 by last year's tariff
message, not even the power of money
nor the personal disaffection in the party
could have prevented Democratic suc­
cess this year.
English Opinion.
LONDON, Dec. 5.—The Post, comment­
ing on President's Cleveland's message,
says that if the Americans are really in­
clined to resume negotiations with a view
to a settlement of tne Canadian fisheries
question, they will find the English min­
isters willing to meet them.
The Chronicle thinks that Mr. Cleve­
land uses strong, but nevertheless true,
language on the subject of protection.
The .Standard says the message could
have been more dignified if Mr. Cleve­
land had effaced from the record of the
recent election his unsuccessful coup
(meaning the Sackville incident).
The Daily News says: "We would re­
gret President Cleveland's acrimony with
reference to the Sackville incident much
more if it were not for the fact that
Lord Salisbury set the example. Mr.
('leveland evidently possesses Salisbury's
bitterness of tongue, but otherwise iiis
message is a great document."

A Good Snowing Made in Secre­
tary Fair
child's Annual
Report.
Estimated Expenditures for the
Coming Year Placed at
$276,000,000.
Question of Surplus More Vital
Than Ever—Evils of the
Customs System.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5—Secretary Fair
child's annual report, as submitted to
congress, presents concisely the condi­
tion of the national finances at the close
of the last fiscal year, together with his
estimates of receipts and expenditures
for the current and next fiscal years.
The revenues for the present fiscal year,
actual and estimated, are placed at $877,
000,000 expenditures, $273,000,000. For
the next fiscal year he estimates reve­
nues amounting to $377,000,000 and ex­
penditures about $276,000,000. After
presenting this financial exhibit the sec­
retary briefly and in a general way gives
his attention to the questions of surplus
revenue, bond purchases anil reduction
of taxation. He calculates that unless
the laws are changed the present surplus
together with what will accumulate up
to the close of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1890, will aggregate fully $228,
1)00,000, or sufficient to redeem all the
outstanding 4 1-2 per cents, now amount­
ing to $188,000,000, which mature in
1891. The principal of the 4 per cents
outstanding is now $080,000,000, and the
interest which would accrue upo them
until maturity in 1907 is $500,000,000,
and so the present surplus revenues, if
continued, would pay before 1900 all of
these 4 per cents. Nothing more, the
secretary says, is needed than this state
i!K*nt to show the absolute necessity of a
readjustment of the public revenues at
he earliest possible date.
On the subject of silver coinage, the
secretary renews his recommendation of
last year: That of fixing the maximum
of silver, which shall belong to the gov­
ernment, and by providing that when it
was exceeded by $5,0U0,000, the purchase
of silver bullion should cease until the
amount owned bv the government should
be again reduced to such maximum by
cancelling United States notes to the
amount of the excess
over the maximum,
If this suggestion was adopted, the sec­
retary thinks, all but one of our mints
might be closed, and large, useless ex­
pense be saved annually.
The secretary calls attention to the
evils and inequalities of our customs sys­
tem and renews his recommendation to
amalgamate the internal revenue and
customs system so as to reduce the num­
ber of officers and the expense of collect­
ing the entire revenue.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.—The forthcom­
ing annual report of Second Comptroller
Butler of the treasury gives in a con­
densed form all information concerning
the work of the office, and show exactly
what was left to be done at the clone of
the last fiscal year. The fables, which
comprise a large portion of the work,
show that the saving over the previous
year was $7,72'I. There has been a steady
decrease in the amount of the appropri­
ations for each fiscal year since the ad­
ministration took charge of affairs. For
J88F $119,120 was appropriated, and for
1888. 020. For next year the same
amount is asked.

CRY FROM ALASKA.
Aleuts I'rolent Against the Corruption
I'ractiHed by Agentf) in the Island*.
NEW YOEK, Dec. 3. —The Sun this
morning devotes half of its first page to
a recital of the wrongs of the helpless
Aleuts, of Alaska, who, it is claimed, are
at the mercy of the agents of the monop­
oly known as the Alaska Commercial
company, which company under its
lease from the government of the United
States controls a large part of the coasts
and islands of that territory. The facts
recited by The Sun show a shocking
state of affairs. The wives and daugh­
ters of the natives of Alaska, it is
claimed, are corrupted by the commer­
cial company's agents, many of whom
are unprincipled drunkards. Chiefs and
priests are bribed by these agents and
the natives kept in a constant state of
terrorism. Government officials who
endeavor to stop the scandalous prac­
tices of the agents are persecuted so that
they are glad to desist. The natives
having lost all patience, have. The Sun
says, addressed to the people of the
United States an appeal, invoking their
aid in securing proper protection from
the government.
CHRISTIANITY DECREASING
A Conference in Progress in New Vork
to Consider Means for Its Revival.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—Monday evening
at Chickering Hall legan a series of con­
ferences upon the question of "What
plans can be adopted for a wise and
hearty co-operation among Protestant
churches of the metropolis." Attention
is especially called to the fact that while
the population of New York has been
increasing for many years the number of
churches lias been relatively decreasing.
In 1840 there was one Protestant church
to every 2,000 persons: in 1880 one to
every 3.000, and in 1887 one to every
4,000. This conference will be the first
of the kind ever held.
Peculiar Suit Against ITncle Sam.
EL PASO, Tex., Dec. r».—Suit has been
instituted here by William F. Dreisman
against the United States government
for $298 for aiding in the capture of
Jefferson Davis, president of the Confed­
eracy, at the close of the war. Dries
man was a member of the company that
captured the fugitive. His share of the
reward was paid to his heirs, he having
disappeared. A peculiar part of the
affair is that his lawyers are both rela­
tives of Mr. Davis.
