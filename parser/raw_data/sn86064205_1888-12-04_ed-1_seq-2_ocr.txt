TRE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Yesterday In respects a note
was many
talis ol the fed
worthy occasion in the
ertl ccngies Tho list woids ol an
outgoing administration always receive
respectful consideration from the people
o the republic For many reasons pecnl
Ik Interest attaches to this message As
announced In its opening phrases
the country is completing its first
centennial ci constitutional existence
The occasion demanded something
more thin a mere executive to deal with
it prcpsrly It presented a theme which
only the statesman and philosopher could
grasp Mr Cleveland with a marvelous
acuity ol adaptability so ofen displayed
by him under varying circumstances has
proved himself equal to its requirements
His last paper belongs not to the
republic alone but to the wsrld It is a
review cf the most notable political
achievements cf the century from an alti
tude cf patriotism tar beyond the reach
of celflsh partisanship
Waile the president doe3 not retreat a
single step from the position tafcen in his
mesgsge to the opening session of the
present congresp which precipitated the
Issue upon which the late cam
paign was waged he does not
confine himself to the narrowed
limits of his former message The psper
read In congress yesterday was intended
to fulfill a greater mission than to outline
the policy of a single campaign It Is a
timely restatement of Democratic do
trines by a man qualified to enunciate
them It is a protest against tendencies
in the government which Jefferson and
Jakson protested against It is a plea
for the constitution such as Benton would
have made were he alive today
Whoever icaas this decament and
compares it wi h the messages of
Have of Gsrtl la and of Arthur will not
need to be told of the fundamental dif
ferences between the Democratic and the
Republican parties Here the lines cf
demarcation aie clearly drawn Present
issues ere triced back to their fountain
head in the time when Hamilton tnd
JtCarson were btruggling to Impress
their widely diverse theories upon the
joung republic To the thoughtful mind
it must appear that the pres
idtnt speaks In no exiggerated
striln of evils which the insidious
growth cf ths Hamiltonian Idea is foster
ing in the republic The revenue system
is referred to simply as an incident of
this discussion After showing that the
treasury surplus is increasing ani must
continue to Increase at the rate of 100
OGOOOO a year under the present system
of unnecessary taxation the president
concludes this part of his message with
this plgnlflcsnt coursel
Thoc ehonld be no scheme accepted as sat
isfactory by which the burdens of tbo people
are only apparently removad Tho extravagant
appropriating of pcblls money with all their
demoiallzlng conseqaences rhoald not I > 3 tol
erated either as a means of rellevlngthe treas
ury of lis present surplus or ts furnishing pre
texts for resisting a proper reduction In tariff
rates Existing evils and lrjusti c t ehouiu be
honestly rccogclzsd boldly met and effectively
remi died There ehonld be no cessatlor of the
struggle until a plan Is perfected fair and con
Bcralve toward existing Industries bat
which will reduco the cost to concumers of the
necessaries of life whllo It provides for our
manufacturers the adrantsges cf free < aw ma
terial and permits no Injiry to thelntcressof
American labor
Ot no less significance is the reference
to the pension system Taking as a bails
the fact that the expenditures for pen
sions during the flfcsl year ending June
30 were 31 per cent of the total ex
penditures ot the government the presi
dent says
The laxity of Ucas prevailing amorg a laigc
number of oar poople regarding pensions Is
becoming cverv day more marked Tho prln
elples upon which they ibould be granted are
In dang r ot being altogether Ignored and al
ready pensions arc often claimed because the
applicants are as much entitled as other suc
cessful applicants rather than upon any disa
bility reasonably attributable to army service

The tariff and pension systems furnish
the most notable illustrations of the
development ot the paternal idea in
Government against which in accord
with Democratic traditions and teach
ings tho message so vigorously end ably
protests
It Mr Cleveland had done no more for
his country than to direct its attention to
the departures which have been made
from tho original plan and theory of gov
ernment he would have rendered it a
signal service In doing this he fittingly
concludes the active service ct an ad
ministration which will live in history as
a faithful exponent of Democratic prin
