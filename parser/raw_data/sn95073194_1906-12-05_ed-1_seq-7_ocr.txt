Waahmgtea, Dae. . President
ita message to the aecond session of
the Fifty-ninth congress deals with a
aamfeur af new aad Important aubjecta,
aaiet af which is the government proae
outlaa af the trusts, the abuse of lnJunc-
ttoaa la labor troubles, the negro ques
ts preaching of class hatred
capital and labor, additional legis-
fer the control of large corpora
a federal inheritance aad Income
tax, law and currency reform.
The message opens with s statement
af what the last congress left unfinished.
aad of this he says:
I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Such
a bill has already past one house of con
cress. Let individuals contribute as they
desire; but let us prohibit In effective
fashion all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose,
directly or Indirectly. '
"Another bill which has Just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary should be enacted into
law is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal In criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists In many of the states; It exists In
the District af Columbia by act of the
congress. It Is of coarse not proposed
that In any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had Indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy in connection with
rebates, the court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer: while In another juris
diction an Indictment for conspiracy to
btaln rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under it.
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be, In real conflict with each other,
tut It Is unfortunate that there should
even be an apparent conflict. At pres
ent there Is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
It occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
si higher court; and the wheels of justice
sue blocked without any real decision of
the question. I can not too strongly
arge the passage or the bill In question.
'A failure to pass will result In seriously
hampering the government In Its effort
to obtain justice, especially asalnst
wealthy individuals or corporations who
do wrong; nd may also prevent the
government from obtaining Justice for
wageworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where

Oa the subject of the abolition of In
JjBnctlons In labor disputes, he says:
-la my last message I suggested the en
actment ef a law In connection with the
Issuance of Injunctions, attention hav
ing" been sharply drawn to the matter
ay the demand that the right ef apply
ing Injunctions la labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
ase ef Injunctions In such cases would
stand the test ef the courts; in which
esse ef course the legislation would be
Ineffective. Moreover. I believe it would
he wrong altogether to prohibit the use
at Injunctions. It is criminal to permit

and not the wild and crooked savagery

Need for Negro Education.
"There is another matter which has
a direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching and of the brutal crime which
sometimes calls it forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
its existence. It Is out of the question
for our people as a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number. Even those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows jrill In
the long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can be Imagined
than., in the fancied interest of one
class, to prevent the education of an
other class. The free public school, the
chance for each boy or girl to get a
good elementary education, lies at the
foundation of our whole political situ
ation. In every community the poor
est citizens, those who need the schools
most, would be deprived of them If
they only received school facilities
proportionately to the taxes they paid.
This Is as true of one portion of our
country as of another. It Is as true
for the negro as for the white man.
The white man. if he Is wise, will de
cline to allow the negroes in a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education. Unquestionably ed
ucation such as is obtained In our pub
lic schools does not do everything to
wards making a man a good citizen;
but it does much. The lowest ni
brutal criminals, those for instance
who commit the crime of rape, are in
the great majority men who have had
either no education or very lltle; just
as they are almost Invariably men who
own no property; for the man who
puts money by out of bis earnings,
like the man who acquires education,
is usually lifted above mare brutal
criminality. Of. course the best type
of education for the colored man. ta
ken as a whole. Is such education as
Is conferred ia schools like Hampton
and Tuskegee; where the boys and
girls, the young men and young wo
men, are trained industrially as well
as in the ordinary public school
branches. The graduates . of these
schools turn out well In the great ma

in no other way; for next to the negro
himself, the man who can do most to

effort should be to better the relations
between the two. Great tho the bene

colored pupils and to the colored peo

the benefit has not been at least as

Of course, a Judge strong enough to be

It must be remembered that a prelim

granted without adequate proof (even
when authority can be found to support
the conclusions of law on which it Is

- Capital and Labor.
On the subject ef capital and labor
the president takes the agitators ef class
hatred to task aad says "to preach
hatred to the rich man, as such, . . .
to seek to mislead and inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives are hard
and who have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger la the doctrines
preached la to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be false to every
worthy principle aad tradltloa of Amer
ican national life." Csattaulag.ea this,
subject he says:
"The plain people who think the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the mea to
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country aad try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe It to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop

umph of the plutocracy, and to have

In the end the honest man. whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal Justly by his fellows, has

of either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup

are at this moment wealthy reaction

or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as

Invaatioation of Disputes.
He ureas the enactment of a
child, labor law for the District ef Co-
lumna aao ine territories, ana a federal
tovestlaatlon of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of the rnnualasloa:
appelated to Investigate labor conditions
In the coal fields of Pennsylvania In IMC.
and refers to the wish of the commissioa.
"that the state and. federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory investiga
tion of controversies between employers
aad employes when they arise." After
referring to the fact that a bill baa al
ready been Introduced to this sad be
says:
"Many or these strikes sad lockouts
would not have occurred had the parties
to the dispute been required to appear
before aa unprejudiced body raprseiatlng
the nation and, face to face, state tbe
reasons for their contention. Ia most
Instances tbe dispute would doubtless be
found to be due to a mlsunderstaadlag
by each ef the other's rights, aggravated
by an unwillingness of either party to ac
cept aa true the statements af the ether
aa to the Justice or injustice of the mat
.tsrs In dispute. The exercise of a Ju
dicial spirit by a disinterested body
representing tbe federal government,
such aa would be provided by a commis
sion oh conciliation, tt and arbitration,
would tsnd to create an atmosphere of
friendliness and conciliation between con
tending parties; and the giving each stdS
an equal opportunity to present fully Its
case in the presence of the other would
Srevent many disputes from developing
lto serious strikes or lockouts, sad in
other cases, would enable the commis
sion to persuade the opposing parties to
come to terms.
"In this axe of areat cornorate and la
bor combinations,, neither employers nor
employees should be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would be in the line of securing
recognition or the fact that In many
strikes the public has Itself an interest
which cannot wisely be disregarded; an
interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a Just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
it is well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results; the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind tbe parties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chance for public opin
ion to exert its full force for the right."
Control of Corporations.
A considerable portion of the message
is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations in what be refers to
the passage at the last session of the
rate, meat inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these have already Justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat Inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to place the
cost of Inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
this subject of the control of corporations
by the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but Ineffective
chaos in the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within the limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or in other fashion,
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tionsa control that will among other
things prevent the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that will compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
of its stockholders and of Its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations.
This will tend to put a stop to tbe secur
ing of Inordinate profits by favored
Individuals at the expense whether of
the general public, tbe stockholders, or
the wageworkers. Our effort should be
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, but so to supervise sad control It
as to aee that It results In no harm to
the people. The reactionary or ultracon
sarvatlve apologists for the misuse of
wealth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact it Is these reactionaries
and ultraconservatives who are them
selves most potent In Increasing socialis
tic feelteK. One of the mast efficient
methods of averting the consequences-of
a dangerous agitation, which la 80 per
cent, wrong. Is to remedy the 30 per cent,
of evil aa to which the agitation is well
founded. Tbe best way to avert the very
undesirable nw for the governmental
ownership of railways Is to secure by
the government on behalf of the people
as a whole such adequate control and
regulation ot the great interstate com
mon carriers as will do away with the
evils which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper antidote
to the dangerous and wicked agitation
against the men of- wealth aa such is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the abolition of the grave
hu which actually do obtain In con
nection with the business use of wealth

do much. The department ef agriculture
It
would refer
la the necessity for the curbing of enor
mous fortunes, aad he has done so by
recommending lsglslatlon for both In
come and an laherltance tax. He be
lieves the government should impose a
graduated Inheritance tax. and. If possi
ble, a graduated income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become famil
iar with what is proposed to be done,
may clearly see the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds Just how far
they are willing to go in the matter:
while only trained legislators can work
out the project in necessary detail. But
I feel that in the near future our nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing for a graduated inheritance tax by
which a steadily increasing rate of duty
should be put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift, bequest, or
devise to any individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the tax heavy
In proportion as the individual benefited
is remote of kin." In any event, in my
Judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the Increase
of the amount left to any one Individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the desire on the
part of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts ot property left; because
the prime object should be to put a con
stantly Increasing burden on the Inher
itance of those swollen fortunes which
it is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of tbe government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly how far the Inheritance tax
would, aa an incident, have the effect of
limiting the transmission by devise or
gift of the enormous fortunes in question
It Is not necessary at present to discuss.
It Is wise that progress in this direction
should be gradual. At first a permanent
national inheritance tax, while it might
be more substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either in amount or in the extent of the
increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.

Combinations Are Nacassary.
"The actual working of our laws has
shown that the effort to prohibit all com
bination, good or bad, la noxious where
it Is not ineffective. Combination of
capital like combination of labor is a
necessary element of our present indus
trial system. It Is not possible completely
to prevent It; and If it were possible,
such complete prevention would do dam

is not vainly to prevent all combination,
but to secure such rigorous and adequate
control and supervision or the combina

fact that a combination has secured

"This species of tax has again and again
been imposed, altho only temporarily, by
the national government. It was first
Imposed by the-act of July , 1T97, when
the makers of the Constitution were
alive and at the head of affairs. It was
a graduated tax; tho small in amount,
the rate was increased with the amount
left to any Individual, exceptions being
made In the case of certain close kin. A
similar tax was again Imposed by the
aet of July 1. 1SS2; a minimum sum of
8.08 in personal property being excepted
from taxation, the tax then becoming
progressive according to the remoteness
of ma. The war-revenue act of June IS,
MM, provided for an Inheritance tax on
any sum exceeding the value of $10,000,
the rate ot tax.lncreaslng both In accord
ance with the amounts left and in ac
cordance with the legatee's remoteness
of kin. The supreme court has held that
the succession tax Imposed at tbe time
of the civil war was not a direct tax but
an Impose or excise which was both con
stitutional and valid. More recently the
court. In an opinion delivered Dy Mr.
Justice White, which contained an ex
ceedingly able and elaborate discussion
or the powers or the congress to Impose

ality or the Inheritance tax feature of the
war-revenue act of l&Se.
- la Income Tax Constitutional T
"In its Incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revenue, an
Income tax stands on an entirely differ
ent footing from an inheritance tax, be
cause It Involves no question of the per
Setuatlon or fortunes swollen to an un
eslthy size. The question Is In its
essence a question of the proper adjust
ment of burdens to benefits. As the
law now stands It is undoubtedly diffi
cult to devise a national income tax
which ahsll be constitutional. But
whether it is absolutely impossible is an
other question; and if possible It is most
certainly desirable. The first purely in
come tax law was past by the congress
In UQ. but the most Important law deal
ing with the subject was that of 184.
This the court held to be unconstitu
tional. "The question is undoubtedly very In
tricate, delicate, and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It is the law of the
land, and, of course. Is excepted as such
and loyally obeyed by, all good citizens.
Nevertheless, tbe hesitation evidently
felt by the court aa a whole in coming
to a conclusion, when considered to
gether with the previous decisions on
the subject, may perhaps Indicate the

with this subject as with the subject
of the proper control by the national
rovemm'ent over T the use of corporate
wealth in Interstate business, to devise
legislation which without such action
shall attain the desired end; but if this
falls, there will ultimately be no al
ternative to a constitutional amend
ment." He makes a strong plea tor technical
and Industrial education for the masses,
and while the federal government can do
but little In this line, he asks that
schools of this character be established
in the District or Columbia as an ex
ample to the .parlous states.
Agricultural Interests.
He appeals for every encouragement
that tbe congress can give to the agri
cultural Interests of the country. He
points to the good that Is being done by
the various forms or grange organiza
tions, and says:
"Several factors must cooperate in the
baa brekea aow. around In many dire.

ing to coordinate Ite work with the agri
cultural departments of the 'several
states, sad so far as Its own work is
educational, to coordinate It with the
work of ether educational authorities.

agricultural educational institutions are

m. om asnciuiunu ana unurea sciences
to young country people or young city

"Great progress has already been made
among farmers by the creation of
farmers' institutes, of dairy associa
tions, ot breeders' associations, horti
cultural associations, and the like A
striking example of how the govern
ment and the farmers can cooperate is
shown In connection with the menace
offered to the cotton growers of the
Bouincrn suites oy ine aavance of the
boll weevil. The department is doinsr

the threatened districts, just as it has
been doing all it can to organize them
in aid of its work to eradicate the cat
tle fever tick in the south. The depart
ment can and will -cooperate with all
such associations, and it must have
their help If Its own work is to be
done In the most efficient style."
He urges the extension of the irriga
tion and forest -preservation system, and
asks for an appropriation for building a
luauunui ineaier at Arlington.
Marriage and Divorce.
As means of brineine about nnttnnnl
regulation of marriage .and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amendment, and
says it is not safe to leave these ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
states. Continuing on this subject he
says:
When home ties are loosened: when
men and women cease to ret?ard a
worthy family life, with all. its duties
fully performed, and all its responsi
bilities lived up to. as the life best
worth living': then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. There are
regions in our land, and classes of our
population, where the birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surely it
should need no demonstration to show
that xwilfui sterility is. from the
standpoint of the nation, from me
standpoint of the human race, the one
sin for which the penalty is national
death, race death; a sin for which
there Is no atonement; a sin which is
the more dreadful exactly in propor
tion as the men and women guilty
thereof are in other respects, in char
acter, and bodily and mental powers,
those whom for the sake of the state
it would be well to see the fathers
and mothers of many healthy children,
well brought up In homes made happy
by their presence. No man. no woman,
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for love of ease and pleasure,
or for any other cause, and retain his
or ner seir-respert.
The president asks for the enactment
into law of a shipping bill that will place
American Interests on the seas on a par
with those of other countries, and urges
especially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws are asked for. and after showing
that present laws are inadequate because
of the wide fluctuation of interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
showa that our present system is seri
ously aeieciive. rnere is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed chans-es must be ruled
from consideration because they are
complicated, are not easy of compre
hension, and tend to disturb existing
rights and interests. We must also
rule out any plan which would mn
terlally impair the value of the United
States two per cent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, the issue of
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press any soeclnl plan. Various
plans have recently been proposed by
expert committees of bankers. Among
the plans which arc possibly feasible
and which certainly should receive
your consideration Is that reneatpdiv
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secretary of the treasury, the es
sential features of which have hn
approved by many prominent bankers'
anu Dusiness men. According to this
plan national banks should be per
mitted to issue a specified proportion
of their capital in notes of a given
kind, the issue to be taxed at so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted in legitimate trade. This
plan would not permit the Issue of
currency to give banks additional
profits, but to meet the emergency pre
sented by times of stringency.

eviL Rebates, for Instance, are ma often in the widest possible sense In the sense
due to the pressure ot bis shippers (Ma which keeps ever in view the Intimate
Need of Automatic System.
"I do not say that this is the right
system. I only advance It to empha
sise my belief that there is need for
the adoption of some system which
shall be automatic and open to all
sound banks, so as to avoid all pos
sibility of discrimination and favorit
ism. Such a plan would tend to pre
vent the spasms of high money and
speculation which now obtain in the
New York market: for at present
there Is too much currency at certain
seasons of tbe year, and its accumu
lation at New Tork tempts bankers
to lend It at low rates for speculative
purposes; whereas at other times when
the crops are bing moved there is
urgent need for a large but temporary
increase in the currency supply. It
must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business men gen
erally quite as much as bankers; es
pecially is this true of stockmen,
farmers and business men In the west:
for at present at certain seasons or
the year the difference In interest
rates between the cast and the west is
from six to ten per cent., whereas in
Canada the corresponding difference is
but two per cent. Any plan must, of
course, guard the Interests of west
ern and southern bankers as carefully
as it guards the interests of New Tork
or Chicago bankers: and must be
drawn from the standpoints of the
farmer and the merchant no less than
from the standpoints of the city
banker and the country banker.
The law should be amended so as to
specifically to provide that the funds de
rived from-customs duties may be treat
ed by the secretary of the treasury as
he treats funds obtained under the in
ternal revenue laws.- There should be
a considerable Increase in bills of small
denominations. Permission should be
given banks, if necessary under settled
restrictions, to retire their circulation to
a larger amount than $3,000,000 a mpnth."
He again asks for free trade with this
country for the Philippines and in the
same connection reviews the work done
by this country in the islands, and says
"if we have erred in the Philippines it

"I recommend to the congress that
an act- be passed specifically provdlng tor
the naturalization of Japanese who come
here intending to become American cit
izens. On of the, great embarrsasmeata
attending the performance of our In
ternational obligations Is the fact that
the statutes or the United States gov
ernment are entirely Inadequate. They
fall to give to the national government
sufficiently ample power, through United
States courts and by the use of the
army and navy, to protect aliens in the
rights secured to them under solemn
treaties which are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
tne criminal ana civil statutes or the
United States be so amended and ad'Jed
to as to enable the president, acting for
..v; uiiiicu ciuiics Kvvirrniiicnt. wmen IS
responsible in our international rela
tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un
der treaties. Even as the law now Is
something can be done by the federal
government toward this end. and In the
matter now before me affecting the Jap
anese, everything that it Is in my power
to do will be done, and all of the forces,
military and civil, of the United States
which I may lawfully employ will be
so employed. There should, however, be
no particle of doubt as to the power of
the national government completely to
perform and enforce its own obligations
to otner nations, ine moo or a single
city may at any time perform acts of
lawless violence against some class of
foreigners which would plunge us into
war. The city by Itself would be power
less to make defense against the for
eign power thus assaulted, and if inde
pendent of this government it would
never venture to perform or permit the
performance of the acts complained of.
The entire power and the whole duty to
protect the offending city or the offend
ing community lies in the bands of the
United States government. It is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy under which a given locality may be
allowed to commit a crime against a
friendly nation, and the United States
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, .but. in the
last resort, to defending the people who
nave commitieu it against the conse
quences or their own wrongdoing."
Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion in Cuba and the Inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
the provisional government is reviewed,
and the president says:
"When the election has been held and
the new government Inaugurated In
peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi
sional government will come to an end.
I take this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American Deonle.
with all possible solemnity, our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the Imperative need of Dre-
servlng justice and keeping order in th
island. The United States wishes noth
ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper
morally and materially, and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save that they shall
be able to preserve order among them
selves and therefore to preserve their
independence. If the elections become a
rarce. and if the Insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed In the island, it Is ab
solutely out of the question that th
island should continue independent; and
me unitea states, wnicn nas assumed
the sporsorship before the civilized world
for Cuba's career as a nation, would
again have to intervene and to see that
the government was managed In such
orderly fashion as to Secure the safety
of life and property. The path to be
trodden by those .who exercise self-government
is always hard, and we should
have every charity and patience with th
Cubans as they tread this, difficult parth.
I have the utmost sympathy with, and
tegurd for. them; but I most earnestly
adjure Uwm solemnly to weigh their re
sinslbilities and to see that when their
new g eminent is started it shall run
smoothly, and with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on the one hand.
and rrom insurrectionary disturbances on
the other."
Considerable space Is devoted to the
international conference of American re
publics and the visit of Secretary Root
to South America, and points to the fact
that our efforts in behalf of the nations
of that country are appreciated by them.

SOME USES FOR SODA.
Material Practically Indispensable for

A weak solatioa of soda will revive,
the color in a dusty carpet. Keep
'flowers fresh by putting a pinch of
soda in the water. Add a little soda
to the water when boiling out enamel
saucepans and it will help to cleanse
them. A spoonful of soda added to
water in which dishcloths are washed
will keep them a good color and sweet
en them. One large teaspoonful of sal
soda will bleach a kettleftil of clothes.
Hair brushes need a weekljr cleansing:
for this purpose add one tablespoon fuL
of soda to a quart of hot water, dip the
bristles not the back into this and
shake well, until perfectly clean:

When the waste pipe is clogged with
grease, pour down a gallon of boiling
water in which has been dissolved a
cupful of soda. Repeat this until all

The Army and Navy.
The message closes with a plea for
the maintenance of the navy at its pres
ent standard, to do which he says would
mean the building of one battleship each
year. Of the present efficiency of th
army and navy he says:
"The readiness and efficiency of both th
army and navy in dealing with the re
cent sudden crisis in Cuba Illustrates
afresh their value to the nation. This
readiness and eisciency would have been
very much less had it not been for th
existence of the general staff In the array
and the general board in the navy; both
are essential to the proper development
and use of our military forces afloat and
ashore. The troops that were sent to
Cuba were handled flawlessly. It waa
the swiftest mobilization and dispatch of
troops over sea ever accomplished by
our government. The expedition landed
completely equippea and ready for im
mediate service, several of Its organiza
tions hardly remaining In Havana over
night before splitting up Into detach
ments and going to their several posts.
It was a fine demonstration of the valor
and efficiency of th general staff. Sim
ilarly, it was owing in large part to th
general board that the navy was able
at the outset to meet the Cuban crisis
with such Instant efficiency: ship after
ship appearing on the shortest notice at
any threatened point, while the marina
corps in particular performed Indispens
able service. The army and navy war
colleges are or incalculable value to th
two services, and they cooperate with
constantly increasing efficiency and im
portance. "The congress has most wisely provided
for a national board for the promotion
of rifle practise. Excellent results have
already come from this law. but it does
not go far enough. Our regular army
is so small that in any great war we
should have to trust mainly to vol
unteers: and In such event these volun
teers should already know how to shoot;
for if a soldier has the -fighting edge,
and ability to take care of himself in
the open, his efficiency on the line of
battle is almost directly proportionate to
excellence in marksmanship. We should
establish shooting galleries In all tbe
large public and military schools, should
maintain national target ranges in ainer
ent parts of the country, and should In
every way encourage the formation of
rifle clubs thruout all parts of the land.
The little republic of Switzerland offers
us an excellent example in all matters
connected with building up an efficient
citizen soldiery.

It is safer to have butter creamed

the yolks of four eggs in a small sauce
pan and set one side In another
saucepan put four tablespoonfuls each

the hot vinegar to the beaten egg
yolks, little by little, set the pan
over the fire in a hot water bath and
stir rapidly aa the egg thickens. As
soon as creamy and thick take from
the fire, add a portion of the creamed
butter, incorporate thoroughly, add
more of the butter, and so on until all
Is in and well blended. Then pouc
at once over a hot broiled sirloin or

cannot be obtained a little of the fine
minced herb is added just before serv

also sometimes used and garlic may
be substituted for the onion.
