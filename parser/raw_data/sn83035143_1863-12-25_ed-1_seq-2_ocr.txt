Social Reconstruction of the South.
War is by bo means without great ad-
TanUfea. If It tears down, it can also
build op. It earnes at onoe both a banner
of blood and a banner of progress.
BUenily, and by the operation of great
social laws, the tidal wares of a new life
are being poarei aeross the continent;
and when the nation wakes out of this ter
rible incnbas of war, new oonditiona of
Society will exist.
Tae whole population of the South is
divided Into three elasees : mean whiles,
mall farmers or yeomen and planters or
eaivalry. And below the bottom, the ne
gro, are the mean whites oonposing three
eights of the population of the Southern
Stales. .The social and moral eondiiion
of this elaas is pitiable in the extreme.
They manage loeke out a life of ignorance
and poverty by stealing from the planta
tions of the ohiralry whatever corn, ba
ton, tobaoco or cotton they can lay their
hands oa. Their homes are Indian wig
wams, hats with one room, through the
ravines of which the winds whistle end
ths rains pour. Their moral condition is
of a very inferior species. Brother Inter
marry with sisters, and husbands are fre
quently known to sell their wires for sn
Id rifle or a keg of " red eye."
The second clans are in the possession of
a little land and sometimes own one slave,
With whom they plow aod ohop, dig and
sow. They take no newspapers; six
Tenths oan neither read nor write. In
Tennessee alone are such things as free
ashjols known and they were doled out
by he ohiralry with moon grumbling.
Their ohief political knowledge Is derived
from the specious pro-slavery speeches
which they hear at barbecues.
Bdt a new era has been ushered In by
this war. ' The million soldiers whom we
Bare seat into the field are missionaries to
enlighten and instruct these men. They
or ueini educated by them to a sense of
their degrtdation and ignoranoe. This
prooess must go on for years to come.
The tidal wares of population which hare
boon urging westward their riohly freight-
ad treasures, are to be turned Southward
Tar the magnificent farming lands of Ten
lessee, Alabama and Mississippi. Tens
of thoasands of soldiers hare already se
lected the spot of land on whioh, with gen
nine Yankee instiot, they pitched their
UnU. ' Invariably on their return Norths
da they bear testimony to the inexhausti
ble wealth of the Southern soil, to its ge
nial climate and magnificent soenery. If
onoe the laner, orer-worked and effete
plantations are put nnder the thorough
cultivations of Northern farmers, the
South will be regenerated with a new in'
daitry and aew social institutions. Han
dreds of thoasands from the busy, crowded
aires of Europe will find a welcome asy
lam in s land whenoe they were repelled
by the overshadowing iniquity of human
bondage. Westward the star ot empire
takes its way, must for a fow years give
nlaos to the aew Southward impulse of
population and civilisation.
With ail that is said against the Uni
ted States br ariatoc ratio writers and
speakers abroad, is is still a faet that, even
In the midst of oar great war, this oountry
if regarded by the oppressed of Europe as
the only refuge and place of safety. They
are aoming to our shores by thousands
they find here homes, bread and work in
abundance for all who come ; schoo's for
their children ; a share in the Government
as soon as they are naturalised, and a fair
ekaaoe to make their way In the world.
Let them come; ths war Is opening up
naif a continent, and the most, fertile
parts of it, to free workingmen , wo have
room for the half of Europe; we want all
who oan work and who are sober, virtu
ous, industrious. Hare are homes and lib
arty for all."
The preliminary stage) of this new dis
pensation, we are already passing through
The whirlwind of war is making our pop
nlation to seethe throughout all its depths.
While onr Northern, newspaper reading
soldiers are carrying the toroh of civilis
tlon to the deluded whites aod enslaved
blacks of tne South, the South is also pour
ing Its exiles to the North. Already a half
million of them hate sought a temporary
refuge In the North. For months they
have been finding their way along all the
lines of travel. They come by sea, from
very port at which vessels might touoh
by the Mississippi; by the Cumberland
and Tenneesee by the Nashville Rail
road : throurh the mountain passes of
Western Virginia into Ohio and Pennsyl
vania ; through South-Western Missonri
from Arkansas and Texas; across ths
Chesapeake and Potomac ; by every tortu
ous rente, through every wind and weather,
hare aome the negro, the anti-slavery man,
the loyalist, the business men of the
South. -
Bat still more. The prisoners of war
taken, numbering In all over one hundred
thousand, who have been brought North,
will not return without new ideas of
Borthern life. They have seen the land
lowing with milk and honey ; they have
felt for a moment the inspiration of free
schools, a-free press and jubilant, joy
ous eiTilizalion.
As ths ooaan currents traverte the sea
n all direction, the waters of the tropios
blending with and assimilating to those of
the X or ih Sea, so Is Southern society to be
reconstructed anew, civilisation ushered
In. '
About the Weather.
A weather-wise Englishman prophesies
a stormy Christmas. He broaches a the
ory that fifty-four years constitute a oom
plete cycle for the prevailing winds, and
that la each snoh oyele there are three
periods each of four years of deficiency
of mat wind, and the same number of ex
eats of east wind. 1896-1809, if wo may
believe this British Merriam, formed a
period of exoess of west wind, and so do
1880-188. With 1864 will begin a pe
riod of eioeM of east wind.
The "Democratic" Tight Rope.
It is seldom a nation is favored with the
performances of sash politloel acrobats as
hare been catering to the public for the
past two weeks in Washington. Monsieur
Blondon Is totally eclipsed and most here
after hang his diminished head. Ths gen
tlemen who are sow figuring so grace
fully before the nation are by no meant
depts in the artt of vaulting, tumbling,
gyrating and equilibrating. They are
mostly green hands; and henee their per
ilous suspension oa wirs In mid air, both
tragic and comic. They are endeavoring
to accomplish a very neat trick, however,
in all of their preliminary movements. It
is nery desirable for the sake of plunder
to wield the opposing elements in Congress
and hence the incessant diplomacy by
which the poor "Peaoe Demoorasy" are to
be lassoed or driven into the corral of the
"War Democracy."
Fernando, with white choker, in order
to give due spiritual effeot to his mission
of love, is represented as sitting In sullen
demureness at seeing the bold summer-
setting, which he, as the chief apostle of
the new gospel of peace, Is expected to do,
until, at length, at the eleventh hour, see
ing the baton of power departing from his
nerveless grasp, his occupation almost
gone, he concluded to astonish everybody
by bis skill in weathering the new polit
ical Cape Horn. Bat he does It with ad
mirable easel Together with his illus
trious compatriots who prayed for and
propheoied a speedy coming of ths King
dom of Peace, he gees in fur ewpplyinf
"the meant and men necessary to a prose-
cation of ths war."
Behold these " democrats 1" What may
our eye snot yet see ! We live ,in .an age
of wixardryl A few short weeks ago
these men piped before the people to the
tune of Peace, and begged the people to
danoe. The trumpet horn of u arbitrary
arrests" blew load and long throughout
the land, beseeohlng the defenders of the
" Constitution as it is, and the Union as
it was," to pat their shoulders against the
tumbling pillars on which Freedom's fair
temple is builded ; but the dear people
wouldn't dance, nor lend their shoulders.
Now mark you how wise these " honor
able" men have grown. If yo will not
hearken unto the dulcet strains of Peaoe
on earth and ood will to men," we will
lead ye say these venerable acrobats, In
to the sulphurous paths of war. We will
nnveil grim Moloch to your gate and ye
shall bow down and worship him.
Bat, seriously, the hypoorisy of these
men it sickening. Ate these men to play
npon public credulity at so cheap a rate?
Is human gullibility profound enough to
swallow the new tactics of the democratic
party leaders? Already the recoil has
taken place and the democracy will be di
Tided. Many of them are too sincerely
for Peaoe-at-eny prioe to be hoodwinked
into any new war policy.
Alas I that we should have no better tale
to tell abroad of American statesmanship.
Are our publio men so bereft of all senti
ments of honor that they will belie their
faith for their parly? "How can you
hope," says the New York World, to the
Pease Demooratt in Congress, " to elect
President unless yon unite with us?"
The Refutation of Bishop Hopkins.
Ths Loyal Publication Society, 8C3
Broadway, has Just published an answer
by Professor Henry Drisler, of Columbia
College, to Bishop Hcpkin's "Bible View
of Slavery," whioh we can recommend for
sreneral circulation among the class of
people who are likely to have been affected
by the sophistries and the unfounded as
sertions of the Bishop. Professor Drisler
completely exposes the absurdity of the
arguments by which Bishop Hopkins at
tempts to justify slavery oat of the Bible;
he proves this pro slavery Bishop to be ig
norant of the Scriptures, lllogioal and
bigoted.
News from the Spirit Land to the Peace
Democracy.
The Crisis publishes this week the
second of a series of supernatural revela
tions to the people of America.
The author is an old man in Missouri
onto whom the angel speaks.
The revelation Is copy .righted. We re
gard this as very unkind In ths angel ; the
most unkind cut of alL
The revelation In the estimation of the
Crisis shows in startling accuracy the aw
ful progress hell ward the natioa is mak
ing. Of this new revelator " whom the
angel called" Obed Keder, (very good
name, eh ?) Colonel Medary thus sweetly
saith :
On ths faith of a man we are led to be
lieve that this old fteaUeman passed
through some remarkable state of mind,
which developed those impressions, with a
most faithful type of the sorrows and hor
rors to which otir people would be doomed,
by ths labors of a foul priesthood, of
bloody lips, of wicked and revengeful
hearts, and politioal knives rioting in hu
man gore nnder their lead, lash and, direction.
Arming the Slaves.
The Mobile Advertiser ' takes on" ter
ribly at the arming of colored men and
their organisation into Federal regiments.
It proposes retaliation as follows :
' Some hold that it is not safe, In any
event, to employ our Blares as soldiers, and
that scoha proceeding would be incompat
ible with the maintenance of the institu
tion itself.- The answer to this is that
Yankee suooees is death to the institution,
as well as to its masters, and that any peril
should be oonfronted to avoid it. So that
it is a question of necessity a question of
a choice or ems at least. We bold that it
is not only legitimate but a safe and pro-
dent policy to fight an enemy whoso pur
pose is our ram, with every wespon which
God and Nature has placed in our hands
with fire and water, with steel and powder
and ball, and with oar household servants
and plantation hands, if they prove neces
sary to avert from ns the supreme calam
ity of subjugation. If they send the negro
to confront our sons and brothers in battle,
why not, if necessity requires, meet them
with the same material?"
December Flowers.

Sowers which adorn ihe gardona of New
Orleans just now I Were a Northener sud

other reasons for loving this sunny land

Phillips Message
and Proclamation.
On Tuesday evening last Wendell Phil
lips made his to-ealled criticism on the
President's Message and Proclamation.
We lay before our readers the mrst Im
portant passages to let them see that Wen
dell is not yet satisfied.
HE PROTESTS AGAINST THE PROCLAMATION.
one people en
ter my protest against the proclamation,
and to ask of you to demand more of the
government than that document covers.
(Ominous silence), cay not that I am do
ing injustice to Mr. Lincoln. As my old
professor at the law college nsed to say,
ttentleraen, 1 know my profession so wen
that I need not blush when I say no to a
question that I cannot answer.
THE PRESIDENT CAN AFFORD TO HAVE HIS
HIS FAULTS TOLD.
Bo Mr. Lincoln has done each service In
this rebellion, has carved for a niche so
high in the world's history, that he can
well afford to hare all bis faults told.
Applause.
TWO KINDS OF STATESMEN.
There are two kinds of men in states
menship. One is the servant of the peo
ple and the other is the moulder or me
people. To ths first class belongs
President.
THE SOUTH A BRAVE PEOPLE.
The South are brare people. Four years
ago 1 said to von under tnis rooi, me
8 juth is now coward, and you laughed at
me. fou know now that, however deluded
the sonthdoes believe a lie and is willing
to fight for it. The last forlorn refuge of
such a people is a bloody fight. When in
the eighth century the Musselmen poured
orer the Alps lour hundred thousand
strong Charles Matrel, when France could
not muster bat fifty thousand men to meet
hi ,!!, "Q'ntlemen, there is no France
but what your feet corer" Nerved by
such despair they hurled the crescent bank
Into tbe Mediterranean and saved Europe
and Christianity. The South fights with
suoh a motive and such a faith.
THE WAR NOT YET ENDED.
Na. the war is not enied. It does not
touch Its end, and yet its end is certain
and we may read it in the light of our
own power and our own perseverance.
Ths Union is to be reconstruateu wuu
cement that laughs all interference tn
scorn. Applause 1 Daniel weDstersaia
the oement of the Union was the FugitWo
Slave act. Sin never cemented anything
but evil.
CEMENT OF UNION TO BE THE MUTUAL
RESPECT OF THE TWO SECTIONS.
The cement of this Union is to be the
mutual respect of the seotions, bred of
that blood which has mingled on bravely
contested fields. The South thought of
Yankee as one who knew only how
oheat. She met him at Chattanrcga and
changed her mind. The North thought
the South as only gaeoonade and empty
vaunt. She has struggled with her four
years and learned to respect her sincerity
if not her intelligence, and out of that
mutual respeot Is to grow a Union as In
destructible and indissoluble as the granite
that holds up the continent. Applause.
There is not the fear. As I said before
(as Mr. Lincoln shows it) it is here
he North th question of how muoh and
how far we will go.
THE CONDUCT OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE.
When the war broke out England as
unit hated us. There is no other word
that will express her feelings. Closely
allied, kindred by olose blood relationship,
we trod on her heels. We over passed her
on some points. She could not bear the
rivalry nor the conquest, 8he felt it as
close as relatives always feel the success
of their kindred. l'ou will always find
safe to abuse a man to his cousin.
(Laughter.) England, cur cousin, hated
us; and when the London Times looked
across the water and said the babble had
burst, she meant thank God. (Laughter.)
But she looked a little longer, and out
that bareted bnbble came seven hundred
thousand armed men on the baoks of the
Potomac (applause) and the heart that
hated us, began to fear as. She said this
broken fragment of a people starts up
great military power. Boecher is eloquent;
but Vioksburg and Chattanooga, and Par
rot guns, sending two hundred ponnd
balls seven miles, are more terribly elo
quent than he. (Applause.) Then, Franoe,
the Emperor of France is a long headed
man. He does not send ten thousand men
by dribbles auxiously keeping alive the
march ot Mexican invasion for nothing.
He has a keen eight and a determined
purpose ahead. He means, oat of the diffi
culties of this nation, to make a serious ef
fort to arreBt the march of self govern
ment and the astute head that sits the
throne is our determined enemy. Now, I
would not answer Francs solely with the
beat of the drum and the noise of rifles on
the banks of the Bio del Norte. Oh, not
This continent Is self-oonBeorated by the
ages to the full and free experiment
self government That is our claim our
just claim. Europe is trying ths experi
ment of thrones. Let her. She has a right
to try it without our interference. But
Franoe plants the germ of aristocracy and
thrones on the soil of the American conti
nent, my answer to her is, this reconstruct
ed Union, holding out its right hand, with
fifty millions of dollars for Garibaldi, say
ing, take possession of Rome, and one
hundred millions for the republioans
Paris, saying, make Napoleon sit uneasy;
and one hundred millions for Germany,
saying, make kings tremble I would an
swer Napoleon with his own weapons
Europe leaves America to Republicanism,
welL If she interferes, we interfere (ap
plause) and the right hand of our
resistance is clssped in brotherhood with
the radicals of Europe to upset every
throne on the oontinent (Applause)
That is foreign policy. Now, look South.
I said Lincoln does not fear the South.
THE CONSTITUTION A BARRIER.
Now the lesson of to-day is: the consti
tution to be thrown op as a barrier. And
that brings me to the second point of the
proclamation of Mr. Lincoln. The natur
al law, wbioh would have saved as, even
without an amendment of the constitution,
he ('he President) seta aside. He sets aside
the Confiscation aot. He says all slave
holders, excepting about seven hundred,
may return to their estates, and the State
may then oome back on the vote of one
tenth into tha Union. What does this
mean? Every man who knows anything
knows that land dictates government.
yon hold land, every man his own farm,
is a democracy; you need not go aud ask
the statute book. If a few men own the
territory it is an oligarchy; you need not
ask history. - Thirty thousand families
own England; it is an oligarchy. ETery
Massachusetts farmer owns his house, and
Jefferson Davis, multiplied by millions,
could aot make it anything but a democ
racy. ' Daniel Webster said, in 1820, tha
the revolution in France has crumbled up
the nobles' estates into small farms: the
throne mast either kill them oat or they
will kill oat the throne. Every man knows
that,
CONFISCATE THE LAND OF THE SOUTH AND
GIVE IT TO THE NEGROES AND WHITES.
me confiscate the land of tha
South and pat Into the hands of the ne
groes and white men who fought for it, and
you may go to sleep with your parch
ments. I have got the Union down there
by a natural root that nobody can ever
change. . Yon do not make government
liken clapboard house: you plant them
like an oak. Plant me a hundred thousand
negro farmers and a hundred thousand by
their side of white soldiers, and I will risk
tha South, Davis and alL (Applause.)
When William the Norman conquered Eng
land, In order to guarantee his conquest
ha divided tha land among his nobles, and
they hold It to-day. ''I have conquered
tha South," tha North may say." "and I'll
divide Its territories among my nobles
the blacks and ths whites who have won it"
And then wo are safe. Instead ol that
Andy Johnson stands to-day in Nashville3
In eight of him is a man one of five, a
committee, one of the fifth to whom Jen.
Davis gave fire millions of dollars (snen
as they are), with orders to taie tnai
State out of the Union; and he dil his
best and failed. Now ha lives there on
his own plantation, with as many of hit
slaves as he oan keep, proteot'd by Bote-
erans, a contractor with toe waruepan
ment to furnish timber for our railroads,
out of which he will male sixty thousand
dollars this month. How soon wtu you
bting bee t Tennessee at this rata I On the
contrary, let Uovernor Johnson sena mat
man where von Dlease: take his territory
and plant upon it fifty men who know that
their title deed is the Union, and you may
bring back Tennessee peaceably into this
nuttnn in twelve month.. And YOU viu
never brinit it otherwise. Every linlou
man at the South says, "Give us, the
hated, hunted, all but hanged Unionists
of tha state the power in uus state
and we can safely come baok. Keep it
from us, divide it between us and others,
and we must either be exiles or be hang."
That is the practical common sense of the
Unionists or Tennessee and iionisuna.
Now, Mr. Lincoln's proclamation sets that
aside, and gives to tne oia siavenoiaere,
under the guise of landowners, tha power
in tha 8tate. I need not theorise on the
subject. It has been done.
