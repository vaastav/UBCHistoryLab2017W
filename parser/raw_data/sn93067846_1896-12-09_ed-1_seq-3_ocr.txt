Senator Tillman has lost hie faculty
of more than fulfilling the expectations of
his friends. He was invited to Gaffney
City on Saturday to make a speech in
favor of the proposed new county. Instead
o? delivering an uncompromising and
virile new county speech, he was mere
ly conservatively pro-new county. The
result seems to have been that his
friends among the new county people,
who had brought him in as a trump
card, are thoroughly % disappointed,
while those who do not favor the new
county think that be . was interfering
with a matter that did not concern him
at all. Since the sensational election
last summer Senator Tillman has not
held so firm a grip on the people, who
bave begun to tire of dictation.

Olney on Cuba.
An Extraordinary Report by
the Secretary of State. \
Washington, Dec. 7 ?For the first j
time within the memory of old officials, j
the Secretary of State has made a regu-J
lar report to the President for trans
mission to Congress, like the reports of
other officials of the Cabinet. This re
port was laid before Congress to-day as
an appendix to the President's message.
It treats of many details of American
relations during the past year with for
eign governments that either were not
touched open at all in the message or
were more briefly treated
Under the head of Spain, Secretary
Olney bas much to say in reference to
Cuba, and in his reports he sets out in
great detail the history of the growth
of the rebellion, the present evil state
of affairs on the island and other facts
upon which the President bases bis
broad statements and conclusions. No
reference is made to a report from Con
sul General Lee, but the Secretary inti
mates that his information comes prin
cipally from tho United States Consuls,
so must be regarded as confidential as to
its source. The Secretary's estimate of
the present situation is disclosed in a
paragraph made after a preliminary
statement of the destruction of the in
dustrial resources of Cuba, saying :
"From whatever point of view we re
gard the matter, it is impossible not to
discern that a state of things exists at j
our doors alike dacgerous to good rela
tions, destructive of legitimate com
merce, fatal to the internal resources of
Cuba and most vexatious and trying be
cause entailing upon this government
excessive burdens in its domestic admin
istration and in its outward relations.
This situation cannot indefinitely con
tinue without growing still worse, and
the time may not be far distant when
the United States must seriously consid
er whether its rights and interests as
well as its international duties, in view
of its peculiar relations to the island, do
not call for some decided change in the
policy hitherto pursued."
To begin, with, the Secretary makes]
it plain that the present insurrection is
far more formidable than the famous j
"ten y?>ar3 insurrection," which began
at Yara io 1868. He says that, start- i
ing in the same portion of the island, !
it very early took proportions beyood
its predecessor and there was assumed
an aggressive nh-ise. Passing the de
fensive lines of trochas, traversing the
island from Nona to South, formidable
bodies of the revolutionary forces early
in the year established themselves in j
the rich sugr.r planting districts of j
Santa C'ara, Cienfugos and Matanzas, j
made hostile forays almost in sight of
Habana itself, aud, advancing West
ward, effected a lodgment in the fertile
tobacco fie'ds, of Pinar del Rio, which
has so far resisted all efforts of the
Spanish forces to ovetcome. The Sec
retary says that while no prominent
seaport bas been attacked by the insur
gents, a iar'*e oirt of the 2,200 miles
of seacoast is practically in their hands,
and from its rugged and wild charac- j
ter is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla war-j
fare aod affords means of receiving !
clandestine supplies of men and arms.
Beariog upon the question of recog
nition of the insurgents, probably soon ;
to oome before Congress in some shape, ?
Secretary Oioey says :
"So far as our information show*. ?
there ?3 no? only no effective local gov- !
eromeot by the insurgents in rhe terri- j
tories they overrun, but there is not j
even a tangible pr?teuse to establish ad- j
ministration anywhere. Their organi
zation, confined to the shifting exigen
cies of tho miiijary operations of the j
hour, is nomadic, without definite j
toentres and lacking the most elementary
^atures of municipal government,
^ jere nowhere appears the nucleus of
s^tebood." . j
/The Secretary illustrates hie point as

Stores Will Probably be Closed
Two Days.
. There has been some talk of making an ef
f'or to tod ace the business raen of the city to
suspend ali business on Saturday, December
26th, as well as on Chiristmas day.
Some years ago when Christmas hap
pened to fill on Friday all stores
were i-losed both Friday and Saturday
and everybody enjoyed a season of
Christmas rest and good cheer tost is still
recollected with pleasure. There is no reason
wby business should net be suspended for
two days, for it will be admitted by all well
informed persous that little or do business
will be transacted on the day following
Christmas, and all workingmeu will enjoy the
day of rest. It is a good ide* and it should
be taken up and put into executioa
[A partial canvass of the city has been
made and about twenty firms bare expressed
a willingness to close their stores bcth days.]
by citiog their destruction of American
plantations and oppressions of Amer
ican planters who grind cane, which be
characterizes as acts of aoarchy.. Oo
the other baud, he shows that m . the
capital cities and ail parts of the island
wiih which the United States or its cit
izens maintain legitimate normal inter
course the Spanish power is supreme,
though often exercised in a vexations
and arbitrary way, calling for just re
monstrances, and most of the fuoctioos
of government proceeds as in time of
peace. Reccrring to his comparison of
this insurrection with those that bave
preceded it. Secretary Olney makes
this significant statement :
' From every accesible' indication it
is clear that the present rebellion is on
a far more formidable scale as to num
bers, intelligence and representative
features than aoy os the preceding re
volts of this century; that the'corres
ponding effort of Spain for. its repres
sion has Jbeeo enormously augmented;
and that despite the coustant influx of
fresh armies and materials of
war from the metropelis, the rebellion,
after nearly two years of successful re
sistance, appears to day to be in a con.
dition to indefinitely prolong the con
test on its present lines."
He also compliments the tactical !
skill displayed ly tbe leaders of the I
insurrectiou. "The insurgent amies," j
says tbe Secretary, "feiny represent!
the intelligent aspirations of a large j
proportion of the peop'e of the whole
island; and it is shown that they pur
pose to wage this contest on these bet
ter grounds of vantage to the end, and
to make the present straggle a soprerae
test of the capacity of tbe Cuban people
to win for themselves and their children
the heritage of self-government.1'
The Secretary speaks of the appall
ing phases of tbe struggle, such as
often appears in contests among tbe
Latin races of the Western hemisphere;
of the excess and forcefol and arbitrary
acts of the military; of the ravagiog of
privare property, the violation of civili
zed warfare by irresponsible officials,
and the killing of non-combatants, in
some instances, happily few, of Amer
ican citizens.
Mr. P. S. Thomas Attemps Suicide
The Florence correspondent of tbe News
and Courier has the following to say in refer
ence to Mr. Thomas' attempt to suicide:
Florence, December, 4.?Mr. F. S. Thomas
in a fit of mental aberration attempted to j
coinjr.it suicide yesterd-iy by cutting: his
throat with a pocket-knife. The csuse is at- j
tributed to drink.
Yesterday morning Mr. Themas in sn in- j
toxicated condition went uoseen into the j
front room of his house and locked it up se- j
curely. short while afterwards his wife
became aware of what he had doue, becom- !
ing alarmed, sent in haste to the shop3 for j
assistance, Mr J. J. Brown responded, but j
thinking it unwise to break in alone upon j
a man armed p.nd in a demented condition
Bent for further assistance. Two other gen |
tlemeo came, and the three burst open the
door. They found Mr. Thomas lying upon
the floor apparenti dead, with a knife ly
ing by his side?. Upon investigation it was
found that he had cut a gash in tbe lett side
of his throat, but had fallen asleep before
finishing the intended crime. After some
trouble be was aroused from his deep sleep,
aod became deeply offended at the iutrusiou
of this three friends. After hiding his kr.ife
and razor and unloading his pistol these
gentlemen returned to their work. In a few
minutes they were again summoned, tbe
messenger statine that Mr. Thomas was in
another rage looking over tbe house for some
thing to kill himself with. He was soon I
brought to his senses and no more trouble I
resulted:
Tbe gash in the throat of tbe unfortunate !
man proved to be not 3erious. He is at v.ork j
to-day, nod is very much mortified because i
of bis bebivior yesterday. This is second
or third time he has attempted to commit |
suicide
Mr. Thomas removed to Florence some I
years ago, nnd has made many friend dur- !
ing his stay here. His fellow laborers and :
frietds generally deplore the sad event.

In our article on the "Privateer Redbones"

Goins. It is a matter of interest to see over
what a wide area this name is found. There
ere Goinses found among that peculiar peo

which people the Redbones of South Carolina
are evidently in part a branch. "Redbones"
nre also found in Louisiana, and a gentleman
of that State, writing to us three and a-half
years ago about them, mentioned Goin3 as
one of their family names. Mr. James !
Mooney, a prominent ethnological' writer off
wide experience, tells us in a recent magazine
sketch cf two Goins brothers he formerly

were the same sort of people as the Goinses;

Araoog the interesting State Records ?d ?
tbe Secretray of State's office of Columbia is
a land paper stating that July 2i, 1774
5 Ishsm Moore, D. S" "laid out uoto John
Braodon a plantation or Tract of Land con
taining one hundred acres on privateer
Branch on Black River in Craven County, St.
Marks Parish, butting aod boundiog al! 6ide3
on vacant Lind." While we b.-.ve never as
yet come across the name of Brandon in our
local historical researches, we may still con
clude that this "privateer Braoch" is the
same stream which flows through our town
ship, for the modern Privateer Branch is one
of the waters of Black River, and this sec
tion of county was known a3 "St. Marks
Parish, Craven County,'' in the old colonial
times. As Brandon's tract was surrounded
by"vacant land" we may safely conclude that
the country was not thickly settled in those
early dajs. It would be interesting to learn
how long ago this stream h2S borne the
nams of "Privateer." Tbe person who re
corded this old land paper was not very care
ful a'cout the use of capital letters.

"The Morning Star" beautifully rendered by j

Cured by Dr. Miles' Nervine.
Prolonged derangement of the nervous
system not only affects the brain and men
tal powers, but develops disease in some of
the vital organs. The most dangerous of
these indirect results is when the heart is
aiTected. This was the cose o? the Rev. N.
F. Surface, Fawn River, Mich., who writes
under date of Feb. 14,1SS5:
"Fourteen years ago I had a slight stroke of
paralysis. Overwork brought on nervous
prostration. I was exceedingly nervous and
the exertion of public speaking caused
heart palpitation that threatened my life.
I used two bottles of Dr. Miles' New Heart
Cure for my heart trouble, and two of Dr.
Miles' Restorative Nervine for my nervous
ness and feel better than I ever expected to
feel again. I can speak for hours without
tiring or having ray heart flutter as it for
merly did, and I have you to thank that I
am alive today."
