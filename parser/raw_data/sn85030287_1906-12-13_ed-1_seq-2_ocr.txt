A group of several engineers and

GOTHAM COURTS WOULD NOT AVAIL DUCHES3.
New York lawyers are not Inclined
the cabled report that the duchess
borough may come to this state tor tne purpose
of bringing her suit for divorce against the duke
of Marlborough. As the case now stands, the
New York courts have no jurisdiction, and the
mere fact that the duchess would prefer to sue
here would have no weight.
Under the provisions of the code or civil pro
cedure, divorce may be granted here when both
parties to the action are residents of the state;
when they were married here or if the offense
alleged was committed here and the plaintiff is
actually a resident at the time the suit is brought.
There is not one element that would bring the
Marlborough case within the provisions of the
code, and the New York courts would have to
dismiss any action that might be instituted.
Even if the duchess claimed residence here,
and if she was able to have the papers served personally on the duke within
the state limits and the New York courts were willing to entertain her com
plaint, it would be very doubtful if the British courts would recognize the
validity of any decree that she could obtain. In the case of Neame versus
Neame, tried here some years ago, the wife, an American, obtained a decree
against an English husband. She remarried and Neame then sued In England,
naming the second husband as corespondent; the court upheld his contention
that the American tribunal had never acquired jurisdiction.
Several lawyers expressed the opinion that the duchess would have no
more sight to sue here than Countess de

"Resolved, That we believe it has
been fully established than one cent
a pound is a full and adequate pos

odicals. Resolved, Further, that we protest
tgainst the charge that newspapers
and periodicals cause any real loss, or
chat they are subsidized by the pay
ment made by the government to meet
a deficit that is really the result of
the cost of postal matter carried for
the government." -

SENATORS BY DIRECT VOTE
Convention at Des Moines Formes
Permanent Organization.
Will Attempt to Secure From 37
States ay Demand Vpon Congress
for Constitutional Amendment
Des Moines, Iowa, The Inter-State
Senatorial amendment coference be
fore adjourning Thursday completed
a permanent organigation which will
conduct a campaign to secure from
congress a call for constitutional con
vention to consider the question of
having senators elected by a direct
vote of the people.
Thomas A. Cheshire of Des Moines
was named chairman of an executive
committee of five to take charge of
the movement. His associates are
Thomas J. Gernon of Louisiana, Frank
C. Goudy of Colorado, W. R. Ellis of
Oregon and C. M. Kimbrough of v In
diana. The work of the organization will
be directed towards securing from
the 37 state legislatures that meet this
winter, demands upon congress for
calling a constitutional convention to
which, the conference unanimously
committed itself. The organization
will be known as "The Inter-state
Senatorial Convention." Congress
man Strode of Nebraska is its first
president.
After station that there exists and
has long existed a popular demand
for the election -of United States sen
ators by direct vote of the people ana
that it ha3 been impossible to secure
the necessary action by Congress sub
mitting to the several states an amend
ment to that effect because of the re
fusal of the senate to taKe the neces
sary action, the resolutions declare.
Be it therefore resolved: That,
while this convention would mucn
prefer that congress should submit
to the several states a proposed
amendment to the constitution for
tl"3 election of senators by direct
vote of the people, so that the states
might pass upon it as a single ques
tion, yet, inasmuch as the senate per
sistently refuses to submit such
amendment, it therefore earnestly re
commends that the legislatures of the
several states do, in pursuance of ar
ticK 4, of the constitution of the Uni
ted States, make application to the
congress to call a convention for the
purpose of proposing amendments
to the constitution of the United
States.

BIRD TRAVELS WITH GIRAFFE
Red Billed Weaver Constant Compan
ion of Animal Skyscraper.
The red-billed weaver bird Is a con
stant companion of the giraffe, perch
ing itself upon the withers and flying,
along when its. host takes to night,
and immediately alighting again on
its back at the first opportunity. The
only means of defense or offense by
the giraffe is by means of Its hoofs,
and the blows it can deliver by kick
ing are of tremendous power. Th
old males during the breeding season
ngnt in tms manner a gooa aeai. ana
the female employs the same means .
In defending her young against car '
nivorous animals.
Giraffes are very swift of foot, and
It requires a very fleet horse to run
them down. Experienced hunters,
however, charge them at full speed,
and by this means are often able to
run into them, and if the glraffeB are "
faU they will soon become "blown."
When running, the tail is twisted in -a
corkscrew fashion over the back and
the hind legs at each step are thrown
on the "outside of the forelegs, 'giving
a very grotesque straddling .appear
ance. The giraffe is mute, but he has
a very keen sense of hearing and of
smell. -
LIMB RAW AS PIECE OF BEEF..
Suffered for Three Years with Itching
Humor Cruiser Newark U. S. N.
-; Man Cured by Cuticura.
"I suffered with humor for about
three years off and on. I finally saw a
doctor and he gave me remedies that
did me no good, so I tried Cuticura
when my limb below the knee to the
ankle was as raw as a piece of beef.
All I used was the Cuticura Soap and
the Ointment I bathed with Cuticura
Soap every day, and used about six
or seven boxes of Cuticura Ointment.
I was thoroughly cured of the humor
in three weeks, and haven't been af
fected with it since. I use no other
Soap than Cuticura now. H. J. Myers,

Tea on the Down Grade.
Tea drinkers are finding scant en
couragement in a report recently
made by a large tea exporting house
in Yokohama to its American cus
tomers. Incidentally it indicates that
the United States is not alohe in fac
ing increased cost of living. The re
port says: "Owing to the rapidly in
creasing cost of living In Japan labor
costs more, and in consequence cul
tivation of the tea gardens Is less
generous and extensive than formerly,
and -less care and skill are expended
in picking and curing the leaf. Hence
the average quality of the teas now
offered for sale is below that of sea
sons prior to the war, and for the
same reasons we are not likely in the
future to see any reversion to the
excellence of former years." New

Unearthing the Briber.
During a recent campaign in Eng

Missed Chance for Fame.
The astronomer, Lalande, narrowly
escaped being made famous by a dis
covery. He accidentally struck Nep
tune with his glass, on May 8, 1785,
but supposed it was a star. He put it
down in his notebook as a star and
recorded its exact situation. Two
days later he struck it once more and
made a record of it. But when he
looked over his notes he found he had
it down as being in two different
places, and as a star cannot move In
48 hours he supposed he had made
a mistake in one of his notes. If he
had used his mind a little less me
chanically he easily might have been

NO MEDICINE.
But Change of Food Gave Final Relief.
Most diseases start in the aliment
ary canal stomach and bowels.
A great deal of our stomach and
bowel troubles come from eating too '
much starchy and greasy food. -
The stomach does not digest any of
the starchy food we eat white bread,
pastry, potatoes, oats, etc. these
things are digested in the small intes
tines, and if we eat too much, as most
of us do, the organs that should di
gest this kind of food are overcome
by excess of work, so that fermenta
tion, indigestion, and a. long train
of ails result
Too much fat also Is hard to digest,
and this is changed Into acids; sour
stomach, belching gaS, and a bloaty,
heavy feeling.
In these conditions a change from
indigestible foods to Grape-Nuts will
work wonders In not only relieving
the distress but In building up a
strong digestion, clear brain and
steady nerves. A Wash, woman
writes:
"About five years ago I suffered with
bad stomach dyspepsia, Indigestion,
constipation caused, I know now
from eating starchy and greasy food.
"I doctored for two years without
any benefit The doctor told me there
was no cure for me. I could not eat
anything without " suffering severe
pain in my back and sides, and I be
came discouraged.
"A friend recommended Grape-NutA
and I began to use it. In less thady
two weeks I began to feel better, and'
inside of two months I was a well
woman and have been ever since.
"I can eat anything I wish with
pleasure. We eat Grape-Nuts and
cream for breakfast, and are ' very
fond of it" Name given by Postum
