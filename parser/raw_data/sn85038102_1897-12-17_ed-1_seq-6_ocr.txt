Copyright, 1897, by American Press Asso
ciation. Washington, Deo. 12. Taking the
exciting Btory of Samson's fall as a sug
gestion, Dr. Talmage in this discourse
jehows how giants in body and mind or
onl ought to be consecrated to good
and great purposes. His text is Judges
Xiv, 1, "And Samson went down to Tim
anath." There are two sides to the character
cf Samson. The one phase of his life, if
followed into the particulars, would ad
iiuinister to the grotesque and mirthful,
but there is a phase of his character
fraught with lessons of solemn and eter
Dal import. To these graver lessons we
devote our sermon. This giant no doubt
in early life gave evidences of what he
was to be. It is almost always so. There
.were two Napoleons the boy Napt
leon and the man Napoleon but both
alike; two Howards the boy Howard
and the man Howard but both alike
two Samsons the boy Samson and the
man Samson but both alike. This
giant was no doubt the hero of the play
ground, and nothing could stand before
!his exhibitions of youthful prowess. At
1 8 years of age he was betrothed to the
daughter of a Philistine. Going down
toward Timnath, a lion came upon him,
and, although this young giant was
weaponless, he seized the monster by
the long mane and shook him as a hun
gry hound shakes a March hare and
made his bones crack and left him by
the wayside bleeding under the smiting
of his fist end the grinding heft of his
iieel.
There he stands, looming up above
other men, a mountain of flesh, his arms
bunched with muscle that can lift the
gate of a city, taking an attitude defiant
of everything. His hair had never been
cut, and it rolled down in seven great
plaits over his shoulders, adding to his
bulk fierceness and terror. The Philis
tines want to conquer him, and there
fore they must find out where the secret
of his strength lies.
The Treacherous Delilah.
There is a dissolute woman living in
the valley of Sorek of the name of De
lilah. They appoint her the agent in the
case. The Philistines are secreted in the
same building, and then Delilah goes to
work and coaxes Samson to tell what is
the secret of his strength. " Well, " he
eays, "if you should take seven green
withes, such as they fasten wild beasts
with, and put them around me I should
be perfectly powerless. " So she binds
him with the seven green withes. Then
ehe claps her hands and says, "They
come the Philistines 1" And he walks
out as though they were no impediment.
She coaxes him again and says, "Now
tell me the secret of this great strength. "
And he replies, "If you should take
some ropes that have never been used
and tie me with them, I should be just
like other men. " Sho ties him with the
ropes, claps her hands and shouts,
4'They come the Philistines!" Ke
walks out as easily as ho did before
not a single obstruction. She coaxes
him again, and bo says, "Now, if you
should take these seven long plaits of
hair and by this house loom weave them
into a web, I could not get away. " Sc
the houso loom is rolled up, and the
shuttle flies backward and forward, and
the long plaits of hair are woven into a
web. Then she claps her hands and says,
"They come the Philistines 1" He
walks out as easily as he did before,
dragging a part of the loom with him.
But after awhile she persuaded Lim
to tell the truth. He fciiys, "If you
should take a razor or shears and cut off
this long hair, I should bo powerless and
in the hands of my enemies." Samson
sleeps, and that she may not wake him
np during the process of shearing help
is called in. You know that the barbers
of the east have such a skillful way of
manipulating the head to this very day
that instead of wakiug up a sleeping
man they will put a man wide awake
Bound asleep. I hear the blades cf the
shears grinding against each other, and
I see the long locks falling off. The
6hears or razor accomplishes what green
withes and new ropt s and house loom
could not do. buddeuly she claps her
hands and says, "Ihe Philistines be
upon thee, Sauiboii !"' He rouses up with
a struggle, Lut his strength is all gone.
He is in tho hands of his enemies.
Outgianted by Low Passion.
I hear tho groan of the giant as they
take his eyes out, and then I see him
staggering on in his blindness, feeling
his way as ho goes on toward Gaza.
The prison door is open, and the giant
is thrust in. He sits down and puts his
hand on the mill crank, which, with
exhausting horizontal motion, goes day
after day, week after week, month after
month work, work, work. The con
sternation of the world in captivity, his
locks shorn, his eyes punctured, grind
ing corn iu Gaza.
First of all behold in this giant of
the text that physical power is not al
ways an index of moral power. He was
a huge man. The lion found it out, ant1
the 8,000 men whom he slew found it
out, yet he was the subject of petty re
venges and outgiantd by low passion.
I am far from throwing any discredit
upon physical stamina. There are those
who seem to have great admiration for
delicacy and sickliness of constitution.
I never could Bee any glory in weak
nerves or sick headache. Wrhatever ef
fort in our day is made to make the
iien and women more robust should
have the favor of every good citizen as
well as of every Christian. Gymnastics
may be positively religious.
Good people sometimes ascribe to a
wicked heart what they ought to as
cribe to a slow liver. The body and the
oul are such near neighbors that they
often catch each other's diseases. Those
who never saw a sick day, and who,
like Hercules, show the giant in the
cradle, have more to answer for than
those who are the subjects of lifelou
infirmities. He who can lift twice as
much as you can and walk twice as far
and work twice as long will have
double aeoonnt to rnteet in the judgment,
How often is it that you do not find
physical energy indicative of spiritual
tower 1 If a clear head is worth more
than one dizzy with perpetual vertigo,
if muscles with the play of health in
them are worth more than those drawn
up in chronic "rheumatics, " if an eye
quick to catch passing objects is better
than one with vision dim and uncertain
then God will require of us efficiency
just in proportion to what he has given
us. Physical energy ought to have at
good digestion of truth as we have ca
pacity to assimilate food. Our spiritual
hearing ought to be as good as our phys
ical hearing. Our spiritual taste oughi
to be as clear as our tongue. Samsons
in body, we ought to be giants in moral
power.
The Lost Strength.
But, while you find a great many men
who realize that they ought to use their
money aright and use their intelligence
aright, how few men you find aware of
the fact that they ought to use their
physical organism aright ! With every
thump of the heart there is something
saying, "Work, work I" And lest we
should complain that we have no tools
to work with God gives us our hands
and feet, with every knuckle and with
every joint and with every muscle, say
ing to us, "Lay hold and do something. "
But how often it is that men with
physical strength do not serve Christ I
They are like a ship full manned and
full rigged, capable of vast tonnage,
able to endure all stress of weather, yet
swinging idly at the docks, when these
men ought to be crossing and recrossing
the great ocean of human suffering and
sin with God's supplies of mercy. How
often.it is that physical strength is used
in doing positive damage or in luxurious
ease, when, with sleeves rolled up and
bronzed bosom, fearless of the shafts of
opposition, it ought to be laying hold
with all its might and tugging away to
lift up this sunken wreck of a world.
It is a most shameless fact that much
of the business of the church and of the
world must be done by those compara
tively invalid. Richard Baxter, by rea
son of his diseases, all his days sitting
in the door of the tomb, yet writing
more than 100 volumes and sending out
an influence for God that will endure
as long as the "Saints' Everlasting
Rest." Edward Pay son, never knowing
a well day, yet how he preached and
how he wrote, helping thousands of dy
ing souls like himself to "swim in a sea
of glory I" And Robert M'Cheyne, a
walking skeleton, yet you know what
he did in Dundee and how he shook
Scotland with zeal fcr God. Philip Dod
dridge, advised by his friends, because
of his illness, not to enter the ministry,
yet you know what he did for the "rise
and progress of religion" iu the church
and in the world.
Wilberforce was told by his doctors
that he could not live a fortnight, yet
at that very time entering upon philan
thropic enterprises that demanded the
greatest endurance and persistence.
Robert Hall, suffering excruciations, so
that often in his pulpit whilo preaching
he would stop and lie down on a sofa,
then getting up again to preach about
heaven, until the glories of the celestial
city dropped on the multitude, doing
more work perhaps than almost any
well man in his day.
Oh, how often it is that men with
great physical endurance are not so
'great in moral and spiritual stature.
While there are achievements for those
who are bent all their days with sick
ness achievements of patience, achieve
ments of Christian endurance I call
upon men of health today, men of mus
cle, men of nerve, men of physical pow
er, to devote themselves to the Lord.
Giants in body, you ought to be giants
in soul.
Samson's Misguided Strength.
Behold also in the story of my text
illustration of the damage that strength
can do if it be misguided. It seems to
me that this man spent a great deal of
his time in doing evil this Samson of
my text. To pay a bet which he had
lost by guessing of his riddle he robs
and kills 80 people. He was iyat only
gigantic in strength, but gigantic in
mischief, and a typo of those men in all
ages of tho world, who, powerful in
body or mind or any faculty of social
position or wealth, have used their
strength for iniquitous purposes. -
It is not tho small, weak men of the
day who do the damage. These small
men who go swearing and loafing about
your stores and shops and banking
bouses, assailing Christ and the Bible
and the church they do not do the
damage. They have no influence. They
are vermin that you crush with your
foot. But it is the giants of the day,
tho misguided giants, giants in phys
ical power, or giants in mental acu
men, or giants in social position, or
giants in wealth, who do the damage.
The men with sharp pens that stab re
ligion and throw their poison all
through our literature, the men who
use the power of wealth to sanction in
iquity and bribe justice and make truth
and honor bow to their golden scepter.
Misguided giants look out for them.
In the middle and latter part of the last
century, no doubt, there were thousands
of men in Paris and Edinburgh and
London who hated God and blasphemed
the name of the Almighty, but they did
but little mischief they were small
men, insignificant men. Vet there were
giants in those days.
Who can calculate the soul havoc of a
Rousseau, going on with a very enthu
siasm of iniquity, with fiery imagina
tion seizing upon all the impulsive na
tures of his day, or David Hume, who
employed bis life as a spider employs
its summer, in spinning out silken
webs to Uap the unwary, or Voltaire,
the most learned man of his day, mar
shaling a great host of skeptics and lead
ing them out in the dark land of infi
delity, or Gibbon, who showed an un
controllable grudge against religion in
his history of one of the most fascinat
ing periods of the world's existence,
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire" a book in which, with all
the splendors of his genius, he magnified
the errors of Christian disciples, while,
with a sparsenesa of notice that never
can be forgiven he treated of the Chris
tian heroes of whom the world was not
worthy?
A Crown on Karth.
Oh, men of stout physical health,
men of great mental stature, men of
high social position, men of great power
of any sort, I want you to understand
your power, and I want you to know
that that power devoted to God will be
a crown on earth, to you typical of a
crown in heaven, but misguided, be
draggled in sin, administrative of evil,
God will thunder against you with his
condemnation in the day when million
aire and pauper, master and slave, king
and subject, shall stand side by side iu
the judgment, and money bags and ju
dicial ermine and royal robe shall be
riven with the lightnings.
Behold also how a giant may be slain 1
Delilah started the train of circum
stances that pulled down the temple of
Dagon about Samson's ears, and tens
of thousands of giants have gone down
to death and hell through the same im
pure fascinations. It seems to me that
it is high time that pulpit and platform
and printing press speak out against
the impurities of modern society. Fas
tidiousness and prudery say: "Better
not speak. You will rouse up adverse
criticism, you will make worse what you
want to make better. Better deal in
glittering generalities. The subject is
too delicate for polite ears." But there
comes a voice from heaven overpower
ing the mincing sentimentalities of the
day, saying, "Cry aloud, spare not, lift
up thy voice like a trumpet and show
my people their transgressions and the
house of Jacob their sins. "
The trouble is that when people write
or 6peak upon this theme they are apt
to cover it up with the graces cf belles
lettres, so that the crime is made at
tractive instead of repulsive. Lord By
ron in "Don Juan" adorns this crime
until it smiles like a May queen. Mich-
elet, the great French writer, covers it
up with bewitching rhetoric until it
glows like the rising sun, when it
ought to be made loathsome as a small
pox hospital. There are today influences
abroad which if unresisted by the pul
pit and the printing press will turn our
modern cities into Sodom and Gomor
rah, fit only for the storm of fire and
brimstone that whelmed the cities of
the plain.
You who are seated in your Christian
homes, compassed by moral and reli
gious restraints, do not realize the gulf
of iniquity that bounds you on the
north and the south and the east and
the west. While I speak there are tons
of thousands of men and women going
over the awful plungo of an impure
life, and while I cry to God for mercy
upon their souls I call upon you to mar
shal in the defense or your homes, yoHf
church and your nation. There is a ban
queting hall that you have never heard
escribed. You know all about the feast
of Ahasuerus, where a thousand lords sat.
You know all about ' Belshazzar's ca
rousal, where the blood of the murdered
ing spurted into tho faces of the ban
queters. You may know of the scene of
riot and wassail when there was set bo
fore Esopus one dish of food that cost
$400,000. But I speak now of a differ
ent banqueting hall. Its roof is fretted
with lire. Its floor is tessellated with
fire. Its chalices are chased with fire.
Its song is a song of fire. Its walls are
buttresses of fire. Solomon refers to it
when he says, "Her guests ure iu the
depths of hell. "
Death the Invincible.
Behold also in this giant of the text
and in the giant of our own century
that great physical power must crumblo
and expire. The Samson of the text
long ago went away. He fought tho
lion. He fought the Philistines. He
could fight anything, but death was too
much for him. He may have required
a longer grave and a broader grave, but
the tomb nevertheless was his terminus.
If, then, we are to be compelled to go
out of this world, where are we to go?
This Lody and soul must soon part.
What shall be the destiny of the former
I know dust to dust. But what shall
be the destiny of the latter? Shall it rise
into the companionship of the white
robed, whose sins Christ bus slain, or
will it go down among tho unbelieving,
who tried to gain the world and save
their souls, but were swindled out of
both? Blessed Le God, we have a cham
pion! He is so styled in the Bible a
champion who has conquered death and
hell, and he is ready to fight all our
battles from the first to the last. " Who
is this that cometh from Edom with
dyed garments from Bozrah, mighty to
save?' ' If we follow in the wake of that
champion death has no power and the
grave no victory. The worst man trust
ing in him shall have his dying pangs
alleviated and his future illumined.
In the light of this subject I want to
call your attention to a fact which may
Dot have been rightly considered by five
men in all the world, and that is the
fact that we must be brought into judg
ment for the employment of our physi
cal organism. Shoulder, brain, hand,
foot we must answer in judgment for
the use we have made of them. Have
they been used for the elevation of so
ciety or for its depression? Iu proportion
as our arm is strong and our step elastic
will our account at last be intensified.
inousanas oi sermons are preached to
invalids. I preach this morning to 6tout
men and healthful women. We must
give to God an account for the right use
of this physical organism. '
These invalids have comparatively
ittle to account for perhaps. They could
not lift 20 pounds. They could not walk
half a mile without sitting down to
rest. In preparation of this subject I
have said to myself, How shall I account
to God in judgment for the use of a
body which never knew one moment of
real sickness? Rising up in judgment,
standing beside men and women who
had only little physical energy and yet
oonsumed that energy in a conflagration
of religious enthusiasm, how will wo
feel abashed I
The Weak That Are Strong-.
Oh, men of the strong arm and the
stout heart, what use are you making
of your physical forces? Will you be
able to stand the test of that day when
we must answer for the use of every
talent, whether it were a physical ener
gy or a mental acumen or a spiritual
power?
The day approaches, and I see one
who in this world was an invalid, and
as she stands before the throne of God
to answer she says: "I was sick all my
days. I had but very little strength,
but I did as well as I could in being
kind to those who were more sick and
more suffering. " And Christ will say,
"Well done, faithful servant."
And then a little child will stand be
fore the throne, and she will say: "On
earth I had a curvature of the spine,
and I was very weak, and I was very
sick, but I used to gather flowers out of
the wildwood and bring them to my
sick mother, and she was comforted
when she saw the sweet flowers out of
the wildwood. I didn't do much, but I
did something." And Christ shall say
as he takes her up in bis arms and kiss
es her, "Well done, well done, faithful
servant; enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord." What, then, will be said to us
we to whom the Lord gave physical
strength and continuous health?
I said to an old Scotch minister, who
was one of the best friends I ever bad,
"Doctor, did you ever know Robert Pol
lock, the Scotch poet, who wrote "The
Course of Time?'" "Oh, yes," here
plied, "I knew him well. I was his
classmate." And then the doctor went
on to tell me how that the writing of
"The Course of Time" exhausted the
health of Robert Pollock, and he ex
pired. It sems as if no man could have
such a glimpse of the day for which
other days were made as Robert Pollock
had and long survive that glimpse. In
the description of that day ho says,
among other things:
Begin the woe, ye woods, and tell it to the
doluful winds,
And doleful winds wail to the howling hills,
And howling hills mourn to the dismal vales,
And dismal vales sigh to the sorrowing brooks,
And sorrowing brooks weep to the weeping
stream,
And weeping stream awake the groaning deep.
Ye heavens, great archway of the universe,
put sackuloth on, '
And, ocean, robe thyself in garb of widowhood
And guther all thy waves into a groan and ut
ter it
Long, loud, deep, piercing, dolorous, immense.
The occasion asks it nature dies, and angels
come to lay her in her grave.
What Robert Pollock saw in prophet
ic dream you and I will see in positive
reality tho judgment, the judgment!

His
Corncob Pipes and Teetee Stems. '
The manufacture of corncob pipes
has become a considerable industry at
Beaufort, S. C. Special machinery has
been made for the purpose, and an ex
pert turner is employed to carve out the
boWls, which are of many designs. The
cobs are of a particular corn grown in
the Missouri valley and are transported
to South Carolina by the carload. The
cobs have to be seasoned for two or
three years before they are used. The
supply of cane stems, which is obtained
from the cauebrakes along the Port
Royal railroad iu lots of 00,000 stems,
capable of being cut into three lengths,
also employs much labor in the country
to select and gather them. A new and
attractive feature of some of these pipes
is tho teetee stem.
The teetee is a shrub, the botanical
name of which isCliftonia ligustrina.
It grows up in a long, straight, point-'
less stem, with a soft center pith and
f various circumferences, from the size
jf an ordinary pipestem to that of the
little finger. It has enjoyed the reputa
tion, from the aborigines and among
southern planters and others, who have
ever used it in preference to any other,
not excepting tho cherry or fig stem, of
best absorbing the nicotine and afford
ing a grateful and fragrant taste. Sa

New York, Dec. 12. A special dispatch
to the Sun from Havana says:
It appears now that the money cap
tured at La. Caimanera by the insurgents
and first reported to be $40,000 is much
more. Over $200,000 had been deposited
there to be distributed among the sev
eral Spanish battalions operating in the
east.
An official report is published in La
Lucha to the effect that two employes
of the railway at Guantanamo had news
of the arrival of the money at La Cai
manera, which is but a few miles from
there, and sent word of it to the insur
gents. An insurgent agent went to
Guantanamo, and with the help of the
railway men, bribed a Spanish officer
with 16 volunteers who formed the gar
rison of the main fort which protected
the road to the wharf of La Caimanera.
According to the plan agreed on by the
conspirators, when the insurgent forces
approached the fort was delivered to
them. They left hk the fort some 25
men, and over 200 proceeded to La Cai
manera and took possession of the
wharf, after a very slight reslstence of
some few soldiers.
Near the wharf was the building of
the military administration, in 'which 12
iron chests were kept containing the
money of the regular troops around the
place, and, besides, the $200,000 recently
arrived. The insurgents invaded the
building and killed the inspector of po
lice and two civil guards who tried to op
pose them.
The cashier made a desperate resist
ance. He fired the six shots of his re
volver and made a brave fight with his
sabre, barricading himself behind tables
and chairs. To him it Is due that the in
surgents could not take away all the
chests. They seized three of them and
left nine, though many of the latter they
broke open, taking the gold inside and
leaving the silver. The cashier finally
was overpowered, and fell to the ground
seriously wounded by five blows of a
machete.
It is understood that the Insurgents
captured $150,000 in gold. The officials
here believe that a part of the booty was
lost by the Insurgents when they fled
at the approach of Spanish re-enforcements.
They hope to recover a part of
the money believed to be scattered
around the town. The two railway en
ployes, the officer and the 16 volunteers
fled with the insurgents. In their re
treat they had time to plunder a store
in the neighborhood and secure more
money and provisions.

A Lucky Find.
A guest in a Philadelphia hotel lost
a diamond stud in the waste pipe of the
bathtub the other day, according to the
Philadelphia Record. On hearing of
the loss the proprietor allowed the pipe
to be taken up at tho expense of the
loser. A plumber did the job for $10,
and the guest not only recovered his
stud, but also found in the bend of the
drain pipe a diamond ring. Being an
honest man, he gave the ring to the
proprietor, who advertised the find in
several newspapers. As no one came to
claim the ring the proprietor, with an
equally commendable sense of honesty,
returned it to the finder. Needless to
say, the loser of the stud was highly
compensated for his trouble, as the ring
was valued at f 150. The fortunate man
gave the plumber a crisp $20 note ex
tra, as the brilliant find was partly due
to that worthy.
Good Advice.
"I have become so accustomed to
wearing bloomers," said the bicycle
girl, "that during the winter I think I
shall simply wear my skirts over my
bloomers. What do you think of the
idea?"
"In my opinion," replied the girl
who never had a hankering to forsake
the garb of femininity, "that will be
infinitely preferable to trying to wear
the bloomers over the skirts. "
Thus it happened that for a time the

Strangling of Allen lirown.
Boston, Dec. 13. The grand jury found
no bill against William Leavitt, a blind
song pedler, who was charged with caus
ing the death of Alice Brown, a former
New Hampshire girl, who was found
strangled in her bed at the south end
several weeks ago.
It has been known for some time that
the officers preparing the case and the
district attorney felt that there was not
enough evidence to convict, even if an
indictment was secured. As the matter
stands now, Leavitt could still be
brought before the grand jury should
additional evidence be secured to war
rant such a step.
One of the weakest spots in the evi
dence prepared for the grand jury was
the testimony bearing on motive, for,
though it could be shown that the girl
had repelled Leavitt's advances, it
could not be clearly .shown that he was
Jealous of her, as was at first supposed.
Another point in favor of the pedler was
the fact that the marks left by the
strangler on the woman's throat were
those of fingers on which there were
long nails. Leavitt's nails are short, and
his lawyers stood ready to produce a
score of people who would swear that
he had been In the habit of biting his

It declares that Spain will not accept the

in Cuba in case the war Is prolonged, and
demands that the government adopt "the
same energetic attitude towards the
United States as Germany adopted to

that Spain must prepare for all eventu

' A true story which is as strange as
fiction is that of Miss Isabella Farley,
who sailed for England the other day
to take possession of a fortune of 50,

her father at the age of 19, on his sec

nothing to warrant the expectation of
cheaper shoes."
