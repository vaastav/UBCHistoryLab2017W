Donsol, Sorsogan, P. I , Oct. 2S. 1901.
If you have thought of those three
young men who took dinner with you
one evening in Honolulu and i .jmised
to write you their adventures, you
have probably written "reprobati" af
ter Vach of their names In your mind
after mine, at any rate. The others
had not written the last time I saw
them, but really it is not our fault.
We have hardly been certain we would
remain more than ten minutes in a
place till now, and" one doesn't write
good letters when they are unsettled.
But absolute tranquility insures a good
letter; then this should be passing
good. I am going to tell you our adventures.
Our voyage to Manila was unevent
ful. So was our stay there, except for
strange scenes among strange people.
We were all assigned in about a week
and expect to be hurried away to our
stations at any moment. Bit they
dragged Mr. Bancroft's time and mine
out a full month. Dan got ov:y in
about three weeks, and as I have lost
his address, I have no idea where the
boy Is.
During our stay in Manila we had
three receptions and several very
pleasant dancing parties. The fii.st re
ception was by the teachers already
working in Manila. At that we met all
the "big guns" except the governor,
who was away from the city, '.''he next
was by Mrs. ,Taft and the last by the
Y. M- C. A. All three were very fine.
When at last we escaped from Ma
nila our party was sent along with the
other teachers for Sorsogan Province to
the city of Sorsogan, whioh is Its cap
ital. . Prom here we were to t:et out
as best we could to our stations. Most
of the boys got out in a week, but it
was four before I got transportation
here.
However, I enjoyed my .t.:y in Sor
sogan. It Is a bt-autiful place, s tuated
on the north shore of a bay wWe"h cuts
In from the sea between two p-irallel
ranges of movntailUL A plain runs
back about two miles to the mountains
and this is covered with hemp fields
and cocoanut groves. The mountains
are all extinct volcanoes and are cov
ered with heavy timber. The climate, is
so moist that they are always '"vered
with mist from their summits htlf wav
down. The sunrises there are the most
beautiful I ever saw. They are the
first justification I ever saw for the de
scriptions of Ruskin and those itople.
The teacher at P;.rogan was sick and
one of our party c:ime back with a fe
ver. So I taught school at Sorsogan
and conducted a nospitaL The people
are usually very eager to learn, but in
that place they appear wholly indiffer
ent. The soldiers say they haven't
been '"shot up enough."
Kvcry inv'n here has Its pat-.'':i saint
and when his day comes around they
hold a feast or fi sta. The fiesta lay for
CasiKiiran, eight miles lordxd the bay
from Sorsogan, came while I was there.
Mr. Bancroft teaches in Casigu.-an and
came for me on Saturday to go over to
see the celebration.
While this fiesta is supposed to he a
reUgiOUS affair, there is really very little
reliK'on about it. They had a religious
pi -sion and services in the church.
The church ceremonies here are quite
difft rent from those at Rome and the
religion tliey have here seems to he more
a mass of superstitions than anything
else. Tt is not at all the same spirit we
are accustomed to they seem to be try
ing to dodge the devil, not to attain to
good. I suppose we are all more or lcs.--inclined
to that form of devotion, though.
Well, we were met at the deck by the
presidente and secretary of the pueblo
and conducted to the tribunal. Here
two long rows of chairs were placed, face
to face, ahout six feet apart. Tliey gave
us seats at the head, one one each side,
and brought iid wine. We drank witti
them and told them we were very
"amlgo." They were so friendly they
wanted to get us drunk. Because of the
habits of the soldiers h re, they think
an American Isn't having a good time un
less he is drunk.
That night there was a big monto
game, in which several thousand pesos
changed hands. The next day was de-
voted to cock-llghtlng and processions of i J' J-J Jij Jj JJ Qj JJ,
villagers. In the evening they had j
the feast at the tribunal or city hall, and Just opened; opposite the Kinder-
after that a dance. The feast consists garten on King street, near
in Quantity, no quality. If you WISH to mrst-ciaus meais at an nours
dance you choose your partner, regard
less of her mind on the subject, and it
she doesn't suit you, get another without
ceremony. Some of their dances are
very pretty.
The feast was supposed to end that
night, but as there was still food and
drink they carried it over another day.
Monday night I went hack to Saisagon.
and enjoyed the trip exceedingly, though
we were four hours going and it rained
a great deal of the time. The sea water
here Is always phosphorescent, and Is
particularly so It stormy weather. The
light isn't as white as sliver or yellow
as gold, out is oriniant ana gieams eve
rywhere that the water Is disturbed,
even in the breaking of the little wave
lets. It Is like bright moonlight on foam
