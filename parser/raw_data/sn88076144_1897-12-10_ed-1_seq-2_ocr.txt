•••!...ncy
revision
which will make our demu'Hl oVligations
less onerous to the gover-'n.ont tnd re
lievo 4iur tlnanci:ii laws f»'(un ambiguity
and doubt. The brief review ol what
was accomplished from the close of
the war to l.sn: makes unreasonable
and groundless any distrust either ot our
financial ability or soundness: while the
situation from ISjirt to 1S»7 must admonir.h
congress of the Immediate necessity of so
legislating as to make the return of the
conditions then prevailing impossible.
There are many plans proposed as a
remtdy for t!ie evil. Hefore we can lind
the true remedy we must appreciate the
real evil. Jt r.ot that our currency of
every kind .n.» good, for every dollar
of it is good p-n.»d becnff?\ tlie govern
m-nfs pleilgt-- is j.«: to keep it so and that
the pledge wl not b* broken. However
tlie guaranty nf on mirpnse to keep the
pledge will be best shown bv advancing
toward its fultilhr.nt.
Tlio evil of the present system is found
In the great cost to tlie government of
maintaining the parity of our different
forms of money, that is. keeping all of
them at par with gold. We surely can
Hot be longer heedless of the burden this
imposes upon the people, even under fair
ly prosperous conditions, while the past
four years have demonstrated that it
not only an expensive charge upon the
government, but a daug»r »rs menace to
the National Credit.
It is manifest that ve devise some
plan to protect the goven.nunt against
bond issues 'or repeated redemptions.
We must ettl.ir curtail the opportunity
for speculation, made easy by the multi
plied redemptions of our demand obliga
tions. or in'*r?ase the gold reserve for
their redemption. We have Simo.ftoO.onQ
of currency which the government by
solemn enactment has undertaken to keep
at par with old. Nobody is obliged to
redeem in gol 3 ou1 the government. The
banks arc not required to redeem in gold.
The government is obliged lo keep e«,:ial
with gold all its outstanding currency
and coin obligations, while its receipts
are not required to be paid in gold. They
are paid in every kind of money but gold,
and the only moans by which the govern
ment can with certainty get gold is by
borrowing. It can get it In no other way
when it most needs it. The government
without any tixed gold revenue is pledged
to maintain gold redemptions which it
has steadily and faithfully done, and
which under the authority now given it
will continue to do.
The law which requires the govern
ment after having redeemed its United
States notes to pay them out again as
current funds demands a constant re
plenishment of the gold reserve. This is
especially "so in times of business panic,
and when the revenues are insufficient lo
meet the^ expenses of the government.
At such~Tliites the government has no
other way to supply its deticit and main
tain redeption but through the increase
of Its bonded debt, as during the admin
istration of my predecessor, when $262.
815.400 oi 4V per cent bonds were issued
and sold, and the proceeds used to pay
the exp^nsws of the government in ex
cess of the revenues, and sustain the gold
reserve. While It Is true that the greater
part of the proceeds of these bonds were
used to supply deficient revenues, a con
siderable portion was required to main
tain the gold reserve.
Low-Priced Bonds.
With our revenues equal to our ex
penses, there would be no deficit requir
ing the issuance of bonds. But if the
gold reserve falls below JSIOO.OUO.OOO, how
will it be replenished, except bv selling
more bonds? Is there any other way
practicable under existing law? The seri
ous question then is. shall we continue
the policy that has been pursued in the
past that is. when the gold reserve
reaches the point of danger, issue more
bonds and supply the needed gold, or
shall we provide other means to prevent
these recurring drains upon the gold re
serve?
if no other legislation is had. and the
policy of selling bonds is to be continued
then congress should give the secretary
of the treasury authority lo sell bonds
at long or short periods, bearing a less
rate of interest than is now authorized by
law.^
I earnestly recommend, as soon as the
receipts of the government are quite suffi
cient to pay all the expenses of the gov
ernment. that when any of the United
States notes are presented for redemption
in golu and are redeemed in gold, such
notes shall be kept and set apart and only
paid out in exchange for gold. This is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the United
States notes prefers the gold and gets it
from the government, he should not re
ceive hack from the government a United
States note without paying gold in ex»
change for it. The reason for this Is
made all the more apparent when the
fovernment
fyo'it looked as if it would
.way. Only a few papers
^faithful to the true princl-
the JO
issues an interest bearing
«bt to -ovide gold for the redemption of
United States notes—a non-interest bear
ing debt. Surely it should not pay them
out again except on demand for gold. If
they are put out In any other way, they
may return again to be followed by an
other bond issue to redeem them—another
interest bearing debt to redeem a non-ln«
tereBt bearing debt.
Stop tlie Drain,
In my view, it is of the utmost import
tance that the government should be re«
lieved from the burden of providing all
the gold required for exchange and ex
port. This responsibility is alone borne by
the government, without any of the usual
£ni ,*ne£ L8B$ry banking powers to help
itself. The hsinks do not feel the strain of
gold redemption. The whole strain rests
upon the government, and the size at the
gold reserve in the treasury has come to
be. With or without reason, the signal of
danger or of security. This ought to be
stopped.
Ir wo a*6 to have an era of prosperity
In thootfuntry, with sufflnipnt receipts for
the^«pense« of the government, we may
t$/K no immediate embarrassment from
present currency, but the danger still
.\tisis ana wilt oe wer pnsen,! menacing
us so long as the existing system contin
ues. And besides, it is in times of ade
quate revenues and business tranquility
that the government should prepare for
the worst. We cannot avoid, without se
rious consequences, the wise consideration
and prompt solution of this question.
I
The secretary of the treasury has out
lined a plan in great detail for the pur
pose of moving the threatened reeur
»Mice of a depleted gold reserve and save
us from future embarrassment on that
account. To this plan 1 invite your cart
ful consideration.
I concur with the secretary of the treas
ury in his recommendation that na
tional banks be allowed to issue notes'to
face value of the bo«a'ts which they
have deposited for circulation, and that
the tax on circulating notes secured by
deposit of such bonds be rtduced to one
half of 1 per cent per annum. I also join
him In recommending thai authority be
given for the establishment of national
banks with a minimum capital of $2o,UU0.
This will enable the smaller villages and
agricultural regions of the country to be
supplied with currency to meet their
n»*«ds.
recommend that the Issue of national
bank notes be restricted to the denomi
nation of and upwards. If the sugges
tions I have herein made shall have the
approval of congress, then I would recom
mend that national banks be required to
redeem the notes in gold.
(•IVIS SPAIN A CHANCE.
lieiinomihlc Time for the Enforce
ment of Autonomy In tr^od.
The most important problem with which
the government is now called upon to
deal pertaining to its foreign relations
cojic- rns its duty toward Spain and the
Cub i.»surreetion. problems and condi
tions more or less in common with those
now existing have confronted this govern
ment at various times in the past. The
stoiy of Cuba for many years has been
one of unrest and growing discontent
an -tYort toward a larger enjoyment of
liberty and self-control of organized re
sistance to the mother country of de
pression after distress and warfare, and
of ineffectual settlements to be followed
by rem wed :evolt. For no enduring pe
riod sinee Inc cnfranchisemoi:* of the con
tinental possessions of Spain i:i the West
ern eont hient has the condHion of Cuba
or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not
caused concern in the Unitee States.
Th* prospect from lime to Ume that the
Weakness of Spain's hold upon the island
and the political vicissitudes and em
barrassments of the home government
might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a
ontiiiental power called forth, between
and IMlio, various emphatic declara
tions of ihe policy of the United Stotes
to pel mil no disturbance of Cuba's con
nection wltn Spain unless in the direct.:on
of independence or acquit'.io-: by the
United States through pur nor has
lh»*:e been any change of dec\--ed
poKcy since upon ihe part of the go-vrn
ment.
The revolution which began in 1SG8 lasted
for ien yea'-s despite the strev-uous efforts
of the successive peninsular governments
to suppress :t. Thtn, as now. t.he govern
ment of the United States testified its
grave cjticern and offered its aid to put
an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The
overtures made by Gen. Grant were re
fused and the war dragged on. entailing
great loss of life and treasure and in
creased injur to American interests, be
sides throwing enhanced burdens on
neutrality on the government. In 1878
peace was brought about by the truce
of Zanion. biained by negotiations be
tween ihe Spanish commander, Martinez
de Cuimx:v »:nd the insurgent leaders.
The i»» seiu insurrection broke out in
February, 1SP3. It is not my purpose at
this time to recall its remarkable increase
or to characterize its tenacious resistance
against the enormous force massed
ageinst it by Spain. The revolt and the
eff-.irts lo subdue it carried destruction
to every quarter of the island, developing
wide proportions and defying tlie cftorts
of Spain for iis suppression. 1? je civilized
eodi of war has been oi-jregarded, no
less so by the Spaniards •jian by the
Cuba is.
Tlie existing conditions caanot but fill
this government and the American peo
ple with gravest apprehension. There is
no desire the part of the people to
profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We
have only the desire to see the Cubans
prosperous and contented, enjoying that
measute of self-control which is tne in
aliable right of man protected ir their
right to eap the benefit oi the exhaust
less tria. ures of their country.
VlfgorouM 1'rotcat*.
The offer made by my predecessor in
April. ISIM tendering the friendly offices
of this government failed. Any media
tion on our part was not accepted. In
brief the answer was: "There is no
effectual way to pacify Cuba, unless
it begins with the actual submission
of the rebels to the mother country."
Then only could Spain act in the prom
ised direction of her own motion and
after her own plan. The cruel policy of
concentration was initiated Feb. 10, 18DtJ.
The districts controlled by the Spanish
armies wert depopulated. The agricultur
al inhabitant* were herded in and about
the garrison towns, their lands laid waste
and their dwellings destroyed. This pol
icy the late cabinet of Spain justified as
a necessary measure of war and as a
means of cutting off supplies from the in
surgents. It has utterly failed as a war
moasure. It was not civilized warfare.
It was extermination.
Against this abuse of rights of war I
have felt constrained on lepeated occa
sions to entcr^the firm and earnest pro
test of this government. There was much
of public condemnation of the treatment
of American citizens by alleged illegal
arrests and long imprisonment awaiting
trial or pending protracted judicial pro
ceedings. 1 felt it my first duty to make
instant demand for the release or speedy
trial of all American citizens under ar
rest. Before the change of the Spanish
cabinet in October last twenty-two pris
oners. citizens of the United States, had
been given their freedom. For the relief
of our ov citizens suffering because of
the conH ct the aid of congress was
sought in a special message and under
the appropriation of April 4. 1897, effect
ive aid has been given to American citi
zens in Cub/-., many of tliem ut their own
request having bee» returned to the
United States.
The instructions given to our new min
ister to Spain before his departure for his
post directed him to impress it upon that
government the sincere wish of the
United States to lend its aid toward the
ending of the war in Cuba by reaching
a peaceful and lasting result just and
honorable alike to Spain and to the Cu
be, people. These instructions recited the
character and duration of the contest, the
widespread losses it entails, the burdens
and restraints it imposes upon us. with
constant disturbance of national interests
and the injury resulting from an Indefi
nite continuance of this state of things.
It was slated that at this juncture our
government was constrained to strenu
ously inquire if the t'me was not ripe
when Spain of her own volition, moved
by her own interests and every sentiment
of humaaiiiy, should put a stop to this
destructive war and make proposals of
settlement honorable to herself and just
to her Cuban colony. It was urged that
we as a neighboring nation with large
interests in Cuba could be required to
wait only a reasonable time for the
mother country to establish Its authority
and restore order within the borders of
the island, that we could not contemplate
as indefinite period for the accomplish
ment of this result.
ISmbnrrnHincnt Avoided.
No solution was proposed to which the
slightest idea of humiliation to Spain
could attach, and. indeed, precise pro
posals were withheld to avoid einbarras
ment to that government. All that was
asked or expected was that some safe
way might be spetdily provided and per
manent peace restored. It so chanced
that the consideration of this offer, ad
dressed to the same Spanish administra
tion which had declined the tenders of
my predecessor, and which for more than
two years had poured men and treasare
into Cuba in the fruitless effort to sup
press the revolt, fell to others. Between
the departure of Gen. Woodford, the new
envoy, and his arrival In Spain, the
statesman who has shaped the policy of
his country, fell by the hand of an as
sassin. and. although the cabinet of the
late premier still held office and received
from our envoy the prommals he bore,
the cabinet gave place wlirin a few days
thereafter to a new administration under
the leadership of Sagasta.
Spain's Replf.
The reply to our note was received on
the 2'Jd day of October. It J* 'n the direc
tion of a better understanding*. Jt appre
ciates the friendly proposals of this gov
ernment. It admits that o-.r country is
deeply affected by the war in Cuba, and
that its desires for peace -'.r-. just. It de
clares that the present Spanish govern
ment is bound by every oration to
a change of policy that should satisfy the
United States mid pacify Cuba withjn a
reasonable time. To this end Spain has
decided to put Imp effect the political re
forms heretofore advocated by the pres
ent premier, without halting for any con
sideration in the path which in )ts judg
ment leads to peace. The military
preparations will continue, it }s said, but
will be humane, and will be conducted
with all regurd for private rights. h"tng
accompanied by political action lea ling
to the autonomy of Cuba, while guarding
Spanish sovereignty. This, it is claimed,
will result in investing Cuba vvHh a dis
tinct personality the island to be gov
erned by an executive and by & 'coitl
council or chamber, reserving to Spain
the contro: of the foreign relations, the
army and navy, and the judicial adminis
tration. To accomplish this the present
feglslatlon
government proposes to modify existing
by decree, leaving the dpanlsn
Gprtep jyith the uid of Cuoan senators

!LA:
ana ucpit! to solve the economic prflT»
lem and pioperly distribute the existing
debt. In the absence of a declaration of
the measures that this government pro
poses to take in carrying out its itrofTer
of good offices it suggests that Spain be
left free to conduct military operations
•uul grant political reforms, while the
United States for its part shall enforce Its
neutral obligations and-cut olt the as
sistance which, it is asserted, the in
surgents receive from-this country. The
supposition of an indefinite prolongation
of the war is denied. is asserted that
the western provinces are already well
nigh reclaimed that the planting of
cane and tobaoeo therein has been re
sumed. and that by force of arms and
new and ample -eforms very early and
complete pacltica Ion is hor»*d for..
The immediate amelioration of existing
conditions under the new administration
of Cuban affairs is predicted and there
withal the disturbance atul all occasion
for any change of attitude on the part of
the United States. Discussion of this ques
tion of the international Uiiics and re
sponsibilities of the United States as

seem to be a sufficient answer. But of

necessary to vpeak further n-j.v. Firm in
the conviction cf wholly performed ob

national Compromise.
Throughout all these horrors and dan
gers to our own peace this government
has never broken, even in Any way abro
gated its sovereign prerogatives of reserv
ing to itself the determaiat)«n of its pol
icy and course according tc its own high
sense of right and in consequence with
the dearest interests and convictions of
our rwn people should the prolongation
of th? strife so demand.
Of the untried measures there remain
only: Recognition of the insurgents as
belligerents, recognition of the independ
ence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end
the war by Imposing a rational compro
mise between the contestants and inter
vention in favor of one or ths other party.
I speak not of forcible annexation, for
that cannot be thought of. That by our
code of morality would be criminal ag
gression. 0
Recognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents h?.s oTten been
canvassed as the poss'.bie If not in
evitable step botn In regard to the pre
vious ten years' struggle and during the
present war. I ?m not unmindful that
the two houses cf congress in the spring
of 18% expressed the opinion by concur
lent resolution that a condition of public
war existed requiring or justifying the
recognition of the state of belligerency in
Cubi, and during the extra session the
senate voted a joint resolution of like in.
port, which, however, was not brought to
a veto in the house of the representatives.
In the presence of the significant expres
sions of the legislative branch, it behooves
the executive to soberly consider the con
ditions under which such an Important
measure must needs rest for justification.
It Is to be seriously considred whether
the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond
dispute the attributes of statehood which
alone can demand the recognition of bel
ligerency in Its vor. Possession, in short,
of the essentih.2 qualifications of sover
eignty by the insurgents and the conduct
of the war by them according to the re
served code of war are no less important
factors toward the determination of the
problem of belligerency than are the In
fluences and consequences of the struggle
upon the international policy of the rec
ognizing state.
The utterances of President Grant in his
memorable message of Dec. 7, 1875, are
signally relevant to the present situation
in Cuba and it may be wnolesome now to
recall them. At that time a ruinous con
flict had for seven years wasted the neigh
boring Island. During all those years an
utter disregard of the laws of civilized
warfare and of the just demands of hu
manity, which called forth expressions of
condemnation from the nations of Chris
tendom continued unabated. Desolation
and ruin pervaded that productive region,
enormously affecting the commerce of all
commercial nations, but that of the United
States more than any other by reason of
proximity and larger trade and inter
course. At that luncture Grant uttered
these words, which now, as then, sum up
the. elements of the problem:
Reooffultfton Impracticable.
A recognition of the independence of
Cuba being, in rny opinion, impracticable
and indefensible, the question which next
presents itself is that of the recognition
of belligerent rights in the parties to the
contest. In a former message to con
gress I had occasion to consider this
question, und reached the conclusion that
the confilct in Cuba, dreadful and devas
tating as were Its Incidents, did not rise
to tho fearful dignity of war. It is pos
sible that the act of foreign powers, ajid
even acts of Spain herself, of this very
nature might be pointed to in defense
of such recognition. But now. as in past
historr. the United Sthtec should care
fully avoid the false rights which might
lead It ipco the masses of doubtful law
and of questionable propriety, and ad
here rigidly and sternly to the rule which
has been its guide, of doing only that
which is right and honest and of good
report. The question of according or of
withholding rights of belligerency must
be judged ir every case in view of the
particular attending facts. Unless justi
fied by necessity It Is always and justly
regarded as an unfriendly act and a
gratuitous demonstration of moral sup
port to the rebellion. It is necessary and
it is required when the interests and
rights of another governmeait of its peo
ple are so far affected by a pending civil
conft'ct as to require a definition of its
relations to the parties thereto. But this
conflict must be one which is recognized
in the sense of international law as war."
Belligerency, too, is a factor. The mere
existence of contending armed bodies and
their occasion conflicts does not constitute
war In the sense referred to. Applying
to the existing conditions of affairs in
Cuba the tests recognized by publicists
and writers on international law, aind
which have been observed by nations of
dignity, honesty and power, who free
from sensitive or selfish and unworthy
motives, I fail to find in the insurrection
tho existence of such a substantial po
litical organization, real, palpable and
manifest to the world, having the forms
and capable of the ordinary functions of
government towards its own ueople and
to other states with courts for the ad
ministration of justice with a local habi
tation, possessing such organization of
force, such material, such occupation of
territory, as to take the contest out of the
category of a mete rebellious insurrec
tion or occasional skirmishes ana place it
an the terrible footing of war, to which
a recognition of belligerency
Would Aim to Elevate It.
The contest, moreover, Is solely on land
the insurrection has not possessed itself
of a single seaport, whence it may send
forth Its flag nor has it any means of
communication with foreign powers, ex^
cept through the military lines of its ad
versaries. No apprehension of any of
those sudden and difficult complications
which a war upon the ocean is apt to pre
cipitate upon tne vessels, both commercial
and national, and upon the consular offi
cers of other powers, calls for the defini
tion of their relations to the parties to
the contest. Considered as a question of
expediency, I regard the accordance of
belligerent rights still to be as unwise and
premature, as regard to be, at present,
indefensible in a measure of right.
Such recognition entails upon the coun
try according the rights which flow from
it difficult and complicated duties and re
quire the exaction from the contending
parties of the strict observance of their
rights and obligations. It confers tho
right of search upon the high seas by
vessels of both parties It would subject
the carrying of arms and munitions of
war, which now may be transported free
ly and without interruption. In vessels of
the United States to detention and to
possible seizure it would give rise to
countless vexations questions would re
lease the parent government from re
sponsibility for acts done by the insurg
ents, and would invest Spain with the
right to exercise the supervision recog
nized by our treaty of 17»5 over our com
merce on the seas, a very large part of
which In its trafitc between the Atlantic
and the Gulf States and between all of
them and the states on the Pacific,
passes through the waters which wash
the shores of Cuba. The existence of this
supervision could scsiree fail to lead, if
not to abuses, certainly to collisions per
ilous tp the peaceful iclations of the two
states. 'Rhere can be little doubt as to
what'pesiilt supervision would before long
lraW flits nation. It would be unworthy
pf the United 8tates to ihaugurate the
possibilities of such result by measures
pf questionable right or expediency or by
any indirection."
Turning to the practical aspects of a
recognition of beligeruncy. and reviewing
)ts Inconveniences and positive dangers,
sti|l further pertinent considerations ap
pear. In the code of nations there is no
such thing as a naked recognition of
belligerancy iinaccompan!« by the as
sumption of
)nterfi|tjqii4! Neutrality.

announces a domestic law, on neutrality

national obligations of a'neutral in the
presence of a public state of war. It
warns all cltlsens and others within the
jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they
violate those righteous obligations at
their own peril and cannot expect to be
shielded from the consequent. The
right of visit and search on the seas and
seizure of vessels and cargos and contra
band of war and good prize under admir
alty law must under international law be
admitted as a legitimate consequence of a
proclamation oflbelfig5eYaflc'J\ While ac
cording the equal belllgerant rights de
fined by public law to each party In our
ports disfavors would be imposed on
both, which while nominally .- jual would
weigh heavi.y in behalf of s4»'n h?rself.
Possessing navy and co..irodl:ig the
ports of Cub»\ her marat-ine rights could
be asserted not only for ibf- military in
vestment .of tho island. I ut up to tho
margin of our own territorial waters,
and a condition of things would exist for
which the Cubans within their own do
main could not hope to create a parallel
while its creation through the aid or sym
pathy from within our domain would be
even more impossible than now with the
additional ovlibations of International
neutrality we would perforce assume.
The enforcement of this enlarged and
onerous codc of neutrality would only be
influential within our jurisdiction by land
and sea. and applicable by ou** own
instrumentalities. It could impr.rt to tho
United States no jurisdiction between
Spain and the Insurgents. It would give
the United States no right of intervention
to enforce the conduct of the strife within
the paramount authority of Spain accord
ing to the international code of war. For
these reasons. I regard the recognition of
the belligerency of the Cuban Insurgents
AP
now unwise and, therefore. Inadmissi
ble. Should that step hereafter bo
deemed wise as a measur? of right and
duty the executive will take It.
Intervention upon
Humanitarian roundm
has been frequently suggested and has
not failed to receive my most twnxlous
and earnest consideration. But should
such a step be now taken when it is ap
parent that a hopeful change has super
vened In the policy of Spain toward Cuba?
A new government has taken office in
the mother country. It is pledeged In ad
vance to the declaration that all the
effort in the world camut suffice to main
tain peace in Cuba by the bayonet that
vague promises of reform after subjuga
tion afford no solution of the insular
problem that with a substitution of
commanders must come a change of the
past system of warfare for one in har
mony with a new policy which shall no
longer aim to drive the Cubans to the
"hoirit.le alternative of taking to the
thicket or succumbing in misery that
reforms must be instituted in accordance
with the needs and circumstances of the
time and that these reforms, while de
signed to give full autonomy to the col
ony and create a virtual entity and self
controlled administration, shall yet con
serve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain
by a distribution of powers and burdens
upon a basis of mutual interest untainted
bv methods of selfish expediency.
The first acts of the new government
lie in these honorable paths. The policy
of cruel rapine and extermination that
so long shocked the universal sentiment
of humanity has been reversed. Under
the new military commander a broad
clemency is proffered. Measures have
alread.\ been set on foot to relieve the
horrors of starvation. The pow^r of tho
Spanish armies it is asserted is to bo
us.-d not to spread ruin and desolation
but to protect the resumption of peaceful
agr'culturai pursuits and productive in
dustries. That past methods are futile
tc force a peace by subjugation is freely
admitted and that ruin without concilia
tion must inevitably fail to win for Spain
the fidelity of a contented dependency.
Decrees in application of the foreshad
owed reforms nave already been promul
gated. The full text of iheso decrees has
not been received, but as furHsned in a
telegraphic summary from our minister
are: All civil and electoral rights of pen
insular Spaniards are, in virtue of exist
ing constitutional authority, forthwith ex
tended to colonial Spaniards. A scheme
of autonomy has been proclaimed by de
cree, to become effective upon ratification
by the cortes. It creates a Cuban parlia
ment which, with the insular executive,
can consider and vote upon ad subjects
affecting local order and interests, pos
sessing unlimited powers save as to mat
ters of state, war and the navy, as to
which the governor general acts by his
own authority as the delegate of the cen
tral government. This parliament re
ceives the oath of the governor general to
preserve faithfully the liberties und priv
ileges of the colony and to it the colonial
secretaries are responsible, it has the
right to propose to the central govern
ment, through the governor general, mod
ifications of a national character and to
invite new projects of law or executive
measures in the interest of the colony.
Besides its local powers it is competent,
first, to regulate electoral registration and
procedure and prescribe the qualifications
of electors and the manner of exercising
suffrage second, to organize courts of
justice with native judges from members
of the local bar: third, to frame the insu
lar budget both as to expenditures and
revenues, without limitation of any kind
and to set apart the revenues to meet the
Cuban share of the national budget which
latter will be voted by the national cortes
With the assistance of the Cuban senators
and deputies fourth, to initiate or take
part in the negotiations of the national
government for commercial treaties which
may affect Cuban interests fifth, to ac
cept or reject commercial treaties which
the national government may have con
cluded without the participation of the
Cuban government sixth, to frame the
colonial tariff acting in accord with the
peninsular government in scheduling arti
cles of mutual commerce between the
mother country and »he colonies. Before
introducing or voting upon a bill, the Cu
ban government or the chambers will lay
the project before the central government
and hear its opinion thereon, all the cor*
respondence in such regard being made
public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdic
tion arising between the different munici
pal, provincial and insular assemblies, or
between the latter and the insular execu
tive power, and which from their nature
may not be referable to the central gov
ernment for decision shall be submitted to
the courts.
Give Spain a CUonco,
That the govern Tient of Sagasta has en
tered upon a course from which recession
With honor is impossible, can hurdly be
questioned that in the few weeks it has
existed it has made earnest of the sincer
ity of its professions is undeniable. I
shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should
impatience be suffered to embarrass it in
the task it has undertaken, it is honest
ly due to Spain t*nd to our friepdly rela
tions with Spain, that she should be given
a reasonable chance to realize her expec
tations and to prove the asserted effi
ciency of the new order of things to which
She stands irrevocably committed. She
has recalled the commander whose brutal
orders inflamed the American mind and
shocked the civilized world. She has mod
ified tlie horrible order of concentration,
and has undertaken to care for the help
less and permit those who desire to re
sume the cultivation of their fields lo do
so. a.id assures them the protection of the
Spanish goyermnent ip their lawful occu?
patior.s. She has just released the Com
petitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to
death, and whi have been the subject of
repeated diplomatic correspondence dur
ing this and the preceding administra
tion. Not a single American citizen is
now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of
whom this government has any knowl
edge.
The near future would demonstrate
whether the Indispensable condition of a
righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans
and to Spain, as well as equi\»t!e to all
our Interests so intimately invoivt-u in the
welfare of Cuba, is l^eiy to ne attained.
If not, the exigency of fur'.t and other
action by the United States fl'ill remain
to be taken. When that time oomes that
action will be determined l.i the line of
indisputable right and duty. It will bo
faced without fihrgiymg or hesitating in
the light of the th ie-ruon this govern
ment owes to itf'-.f, io the people who
have confided to it :he protection of their
interests and h.»nor, and to humanity.
Sure of the right, keeping free from all
offense 'urs-'lvt-s. acting o"iy from up
right and patriotic conbiderilions. moved
neither by pa^ion nor selfishness, the
government will continue its watchful
care over the rights and property of
American citizens, and will abate none of
its efforts to bring about by peaceful
agencies a peace which shall be honora
ble and enduring. If it s) all hereafter
appear to be a duty imposed by our obli
gations to ourseives, to civilization and
to humanity to intervene with force, it
shall be without i'ault on our part, and
only because tlv: rvcesslty for such action
will be so clear as to co :im:'.iid the sup
port and approval of the civilized world.

Thin In Strongly Urged by President

By a special message, dated the 10th of
June last, I laid before the senate a treaty
signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of
the United States and of tne Republic of
Hawaii, having for its purpose the incor
poration of the Hawaiian mlr.nds as an
integral part of the United States and
Under its sovereignty. The senate having
removed the injunction of secrecy, al
though tho treaty Is still pending before
that body, tho subject may be properly

While consistently disavowing from a
verv earlv period any agg**^siva policy
of absorpt.'ca in -.egard :o th* Hawaiian
group, a long series of declarations
through three-quarters o" century has
proclaimed the vital intervs of the United
States in the independent life of the isl
ands and their intimate commercial de
pemb-tve upon tnis country. At the same
time It has been repeatedly asserted that
In no event could the entity of Hawaiian
statehood cease by the passage of the
islands under the domination or influence
of another power than the United States.
Under these circumstance^ the logic of
events required tout annexation, hereto
fore offered, but. ueclincd. should in the
ripeness of tim* come M-cU as the nat
ural result of the strengthening ties that
bind us to the?e ishuvls .r.d be realised
bv the free will of Ihe ll i-A^Sian stale.
That treaty was unanimously ratified
without amendment the senate and
president of the republic of Hawaii on
on the 10th of September '.-«st. and only
awaits the favorable action of the Amer
ican senate to effect the unplete absorp
tion of the Islands Into the domain of
tlie United States. What the conditions
of srch a union shall be. the political
relation thereof to the United States, the
character of the local administration,
the quality and decree of the elective
franchise of the inhabitants, the exten
sion of the federal laws to the territory,
or the enactment of special Jaws to fit
the peculiar condition thereof, the regula
tion. if need be. of the labor sy»um
therein, are all matters which the treaty
has wisely relegated to congress.
If the treaty is confirmed as every con
sideration of dignity and honor reouires,
the wisdom of congress will to It,
avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly yet fitted to share In the
highest franchises of citizenship and hav
ing due regard to the geographical condi
tions. the most just provisions for self
rule In local matters with the largest
political liberties as an Integral part of
our naWon will be accorded to the
Hawallans. No less is due to a people,
who after nearly five years of demon
strated capacity to fulfil the obligations
of self-governing statehood come of their
own free will lo merge their destinies in
our body politic.
The questions which have arisen be
tween Japan and Hawaii by reason of
the treatment of Japanese laborers em
igrating to the islands under the
Hawaiian-Japanese convention of l.sSSare
in a satisfactory stage of settlement by
negotiation. This government has not
been invited to mediate and on the other
ha id has sought no intervention in that
matter further than to cvincc its kind
liest disposition toward such a speedy
and direct adjustment by the two sov
ereign states In interest as shall com
port with equity and honor. It is gratify
ing to learn that t.he apprehensions uf
first displayed on the par*, of Japan lest
the cessation of Hawaii national life
thtough annexation might Impair priv
ileges to which Japan honorably laid
claim have given place to confidence in
the uprightness of this government and
in the sincerity of its purpose to deal
with all possible ulterior questions in the
broadtst spirit of friendliness.
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
Mcaru^un Canal anil Some Diplo
matic Complications.
As to the representations of this gov
ernment to Nicaragua. Salvador and
Costa Rica, I have concluded that Mr.
William 1^. Merry, confirmed as minister
of the United States to the states of
Nicaragua. Costa Rica am- Salvador,
shall proceed to San Jose. Cosia Rica,
and there temporarily establish the head
quarters of the United States to those
three states. I took this action for what
regarded as the paramount Interests
of this country. It was developed upon
an investigation by the sect clary of state
that the government of Nicaragua, while
not unwilling to receive Mr. Merry in
his diplomatic quality, was unable to do
so because of the compact concluded June
20, 1SP5, whereby that republic and those
of Salvador and Honduras, forming what
is known as the Greater Republic of Cen
tral America, had surrendered to the rep
resentative diet their right- to receive
and send diplomatic agents. The diet was
not willing to accept him. because be
was not accredited to that body. 1 could
not accredit him to that body because
the appropriation law of congress did
not permit it. Mr. Baker, the present
minister *o Managua, has been directed
to present his letters of recall.
Mr. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been
accredited to the governments of Guate
mala and Honduras, the same as his pre
decessor. Guatemala is not a member of
the greater Republic of Central America,
but Honduras is. Should this latter gov
ernment decline to receive him he has
been instructed to report this fact to his
government and await, its further in
structions.
A subject of large importance to our
country and increasing appreciation on
the part of the people is the completion
of the great highway of trade between
the Atlantic and Pacific known as the
Nicaraguan canal. Its utility and value
to American commerce is universally ad
mitted. The commission appointed under
date of July last, "to continue the
surveys and exactions authorized by the
act approved March 2, 181)5" In regard to
'the proper route, feasibility, and cost
of construction of the Nicaragua canal,
with a view of making complete plans
for the entire work or construction of
such canal" Is now employed In the
undertaking. In the future I shall take
occasion to transmit to congress the re
port of this commission, making at the
same time such further suggestions as
may then seem advisable.

Under the provisions of the act of con

14th day of April, 1SH7. Hon. Ivlward O.

have been diligent in their efforts to se
cure tho co-operation of ICuropt-an coun

question, but up to this time have not
been able to secure an agreement con
templated by their mission.
Tho gratifying action of our great sister
republic of France in joining this country
In the attempt to bring about an agree
ment among the principal commercial na
tions of Europe whereby a fixed and rela
tive value between gold and silver shall
be secured furnishes assurance that we
are not alone among the larger nations
of the world in realizing the international
character of the problem, and in the de
sire of reaching some wise and practical
solution of it. The British government
has published a resume of the steps taken
jointly by tho French ambassador in
I^ondon and the special envoys of the
United States, with whom our ambas
sador at London actively co-operated in
the presentation of this subject to her
majesty government. This will be laid
before congress. Our special envovs have
not made their final report, as further
negotiations between the representa
tives of this government and the
governments of other countries are
pending and contemplation. They be
lieve that doubts which have been
raised in certain quarters respecting the
position of maintaining the stability of
the parity between the metals and 'kin
dred questions may yet be solved by fur
ther negotiations.
Meanwhile, it gives mo satisfaction to
state that the special envoys have already
demonstrated their ability and fitness to
deal with the subject, and it is to be
hoped that their labors may result in an
international agreement which will bring
about recognition uf both gold and silver
as mqney upon such terms and with such
safeguards as will secure the use of both
metals upon a basis which shali work no
