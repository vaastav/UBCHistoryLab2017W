iYESTERH CANADA'S OFFER IS
ALIEBIGA'S OPPORTUNITY
GROW GRAINS IN WESTERN CAN
ADA," ENJOY AN EXCELLENT
CLIMATE AND MAKE
MONEY.
With the European wheat fields
desolated, and the : farming popula
tion more than decimated, there will
be for a number of years a demand for
food products that has not been ex
perienced in the memory of the pres
ent generation. Everyone regrets the
horrible war that has brought thit
about Its effects are felt not only in
Europe, but In every part of the
American continent Many lines ' ot
business have been hurt, but only
temporarily it is hoped. Financial
stringency Is being talked of. There
Is a way of overcoming these things;
and Western Canada offers the solu
tion in its immense agricultural area,
when the possibility of retrieving
losses, making assured gains, and at
the same time becoming a factor in
providing ' the world with the one
great requisite wheat is so .pro
nounced that it cannot be overlooked.
There are several ways in which
excellent farming lands can be se
cured in the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan or Alberta, and also
British Columbia.
In the first place the offer of the
Dominion Government of 160 acres of
land free to the settler is something
not given by any other country. Con
ditions of settlement are easy.' Live
upon the land six months in each year,
for a period of three years, cultivate
about thirty acres, and erect a habit
able house. Instead of cultivation,
tae keeping of a certain number of
head of cattle will carry with it the
same value. Many of these home
steads may be had in the open prairie
area, where every acre can be put
under cultivation, but to the man with
limited means, in the park area, lying
n6rth of the central portion of three
of the provinces named, there is af
forded the best chance. In this park
country are beautiful groves of poplar
and willow, small lakes and streams,
and sufficient open area to enable one
to go into immediate cultivation for
crops of wheat, oats, barley and flax,'
any one of which does wonderfully
well, giving prolific yields. In due
time when more land is required for
cultivation, these groves may be cut
down at small cost In the meantime,
however, they have been valuable in
providing fuel and shelter for cattle,
which thrive wonderfully on. the wild
grasses that grow in abundance.
Another plan is to purchase from
some of the railway companies who
hold large tracts, or from some re
sponsible land company. The prices
asked are exceedingly low and the
terms easy. - Whether one may decide
to locate in the open prairie area or
in the park country the land will be
found to be of the same general tex
ture, a rich, black or chocolate colored
loam or la clay subsoiL ; K : ...-V :
Again attention is drawn to the fact
of the great opportunities for farming
that are offered in Western Canada.
Already a number of holders of tracts
of land . there, who ' are residents of
the United States business men, mer
chants, lawyers, bankers men of fore
sight and keen knowledge of busi
ness, - have decided to cultivate ; the
lands they ; have been holding for
speculation and wait no longer for a
buyer to turn up. They are acting
wisely. '-f'jK: -- . -: - :; .-. ..
.- Canadian laws are as fair and just
as can be found in the civilized world.
Military service is not ' compulsory,
nor is there one ounce of coercion
used. Anything that is given to Great
Britain whether in money of men is
entirely voluntary. There is no draft
ing nor conscription of any kind. Al
ready over sixty thousand of th
young men of Canada have volun
teered for service, and thirty-flvo
thousand have gone forward, many ol
these having left their farms in their
love for Great Britain and a desire to
fight for their country. As a conse
quence, many farms may be left un
filled. , Therefore Canada Invites oth
ers to come in and take their places.
This then is the opportunity for the
American who wishes to better his
own condition. Advertisement .

Confessions gf a
Mail Order Man
By Mr. M. O. X.
Revelations by One Whose Experience in
the Business Covers a Range From
Office Boy to General Manager
MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE
MAIL ORDER BUSINESS.
It was as a boy, long-legged, lanky
and just into my 'teens that I made
my application for a "job" with one
of the merchandise concerns that was
making an effort to secure trade from
the people in the towns and country
adjacent to one of our big western
cities.
I had arrived In the city, having quit
my job in a. smaller metropolis many
miles away after serving an arduous
term as office boy and all-around "kid"
in a small store. My self-cpnfidence
was small and my diffidence abnormal,
I suppose I stood outside the store en
trance for fully an hour before I mus
tered up courage enough to go in.
"I want to see the boss," was my
statement to a rather flashy appear
ing man who asked me what I wanted.
"What for?"
"1 want a Job."
He sized me up quizzically and then
pointed to a door leading into a dingy
little office in the corner.. There was
a long counter, behind .which a sleepy
looking bookkeeper was engaged in
adding up figures and within the office
I could see a tall; angular man read
ing letters. Timidly I knocked at the
door. : ; .
"Come In," said the angular man,
In a deep, bass voice. 1
' Tremblingly I approached him. He
looked at me with a keen glance arid
asked me 'what I wanted. '
"I want a Job." V , '
"What can you do?" ;, '; ! '
TWork around a store."
. tThen followed a series of questions,
which I answered freely as I be
came more at ease. ' ' ,
"I need a good, hard-working boy,"
he said, "one that is honest and re
liable. ; Have you any references?"
"No, sir." I explained that I had
been refused a reference from my last
employer because he did not wish me
to quit and he had taken this petty
revenge. Then he asked me a lot
more questions about my work, etc.,
and finally he said:
, "A reference doesn't amount to any
thing, anyhow. Men will give a ref
erence to get rid of a fellow, lots of
times. J I've done it myself. You ehow
me that you are all right, and we'll
have no bother about the reference.
I'll give you a job. Where are your
things?" ,
- "What things?" .
"Why, your trunk or your valise or
your bundle."
v It was with humiliation that I con
fessed that I did not have anything
except the clothes I had on. I did not
confess.' to tho. possession of a pair
of neatly darned socks, which I had
in one jacket pocket. As for linen,
why,T had the ehirt I was wearing and
my celluloid collar had been, eo far,
all sufficient, as I . could launder it In
a minute with a basin of water, ( , ; . ,
"He laughed e-nd said, ,," All right,
sonny; start riglt in and see that you
don't take away from my ; store any
more than you fetched into It."
I barely existed on the three dollars
a week' he paid me, but managed to
make shift, by sleeping on a cot in the
rear of the store. V- i i
"You can go out in the store and
straighten up stock," he said, "and
fix everything up, in good style. Every
morning you will take the broom and
sweep out, and if you find anything on
the floor, bring it to me. It belongs to
me because vthia is my store, under
stand?" . I nodded assent.
"During the day yott can help around
the store, wrapping up bundles, filling
brders and doing anything that comes
handy, but keep busy."
In my after years I realized how
pitiful, how utterly , inadequate, how
worthless for all practical purposes
was the "Junk" yet, it was no bet-
terihat he had In stock. As a buyer
I have since visited the biggeet mar
kets In all of the principal cities, and
I have never seen anything like the
stuff he had piled on his shelves.
There was a long table with clothing,
made from material known as "shod
dy." When you wore it out in the
rain It ' became a pulp and lost any
semDiance oi snape. There were
shoes, made of the cheapest leather.
with insoles of paper; there were bar
rels of brown sugar, "coffee A," etc.,
and a big canister of "white" sugar.
There was coffee, which I mixed with
roasted beans and corn and ground by
hand in the "mill" screwed to the
dirty pine counter. There were prunes.
raisins, currants, apples, all dried.
The dry goods would now be consid
ered absolutely worthless. Thin,
scrawny and shapeless, the stuff would
unroll from the bolt, while the rib
bons were flyspecked and dirty. Then
there was a stock of "notions," a
stock," of hardware, more groceries, not
forgetting" a barrel each of whisky,
rum, molasses and vinegar.. There
were other things, too numerous to
mention, but all of the same question
able value. )
The store made pretensions to being
quite an establishment, but I will
state honestly that as I remember that
awful stock of merchandise I would
not offer $100 for the whole outfit,
were I to appraise it today.
; So I swept out the store mornings,
tied up bundles and waited on cus
tomers during the day and at night I
crawled under the counter, too tired
to dream, and slept amidst the odors
from the barreled and boxed groceries.
He ehowed me how to manipulate
the old-fashioned scales so that I could
:heat an old woman out of a pound
or two ot sugar or flour. Our pint,
quart and gallon measures had false
bottoms. Our peck and bushel meas
ures were fixed for false measure,
and there was ample material for adul
teration of all commodities. He in
structed me in their use, and one day
he trounced me without mercy be

The Social Code.
Men are kept orderly, clean and de
cent through the strength of an obse
quiousness to social opinion which the
prophets of individualism are in such
haste to deplore, writes Q. W. Firkins
in the Atlantic Monthly. The social
code no doubt always Involves much
inadequacy, much stupidity, some hy
pocrisy and some wickedness; but,
taken by and large, the average of its
prescriptions has probably been higher
in every age than the average of un
directed and unfettered Individual Ins-
old Irishwoman who did my . other
shirt up (for I now had two) and who
mended my socks for a few pennies
a week.
"You'll never leato the business,"
he said, rather sadly, "unless you
watch every chance to make a penny.
It's the pennies that count in this
business."
"Get their money," he used to say
with great unction, "get all you can
out of them for as little as you
can give. If they come back , and .
holler it is plenty of time enough to
make it right. Then, of course, it was
a mistake, but be careful and don't
give too much, even then." .' ;
And then this old rascal began t&
make it a practice to call me into his
office when a customer came1 in tc
complain - of short weight or short
measure, and put the blame on me
for it. If the kick was a strong one
he would "fire" me then and there,
and I used to go out into the back
room and loaf until the customer had
gone. But I had no : chance to lose
my Job. . -
He made it a point to wait on little
children who came into the store, and
I realize now that his purpose was to
short-change them out of a few pen
nies. It came about that I filled all the
orders sent in by mail or that were
left to be filled for farmers who
brought in an order made out by the
wife. Many and many a wigging was
had by innocent farmers who were
blamed by their wives for "forgetting"
to order certain articles. Of course
the things were never put lntohe
package, although paid for.
I knew it Tas wrong. I knew I was
cheating these customers, " but here
was this old sinnerl who went to
church regularly and was a deacon in
the leading house of worship, i His
argument when I made a weak objec
tion to this method was that he was1
in business to make money and that
the thefts were so small that nobody
missed the money. Besides, he ras
my "boss," and he was. responsible.
That is what he told me In so many
words.. . '. .
One day I told him I was going to
quit. Here I was a half-starved and
wholly overworked boy, ignorant , of
the world and without a penny saved,
and absolutely dependent ' upon my
dally r wage for food, but desiring
strongly to escape from this old scoun
drel. ..' : . l . ' v
When I told him I, wanted to quit
he dragged me Into the office and beat
me with a strap He threatened me
with an i awful death, cutting my
throat, and that sort of stuff, if
tried to get away. And I believed
him and I did not sleep soundly that
night as I pictured in my boyish miud
the horrors and tortures he had
threatened me with.
After that I planned. I planned to
murder, him. I planned to burn down
the store. I planned to do anything
and everything that might offer me a
chance to get away from the hateful
place. '; And one day the chance came,
Back behind the counter one after
noon I found a pocketbook. . It , be
longed to him. I knew it as I knew
my . own right hand, for it was from
this selfsame pocketbook that he gave
me grudgingly every Saturday night,
so slowly and grouchily that I feared
each time that he would change his
mind and withhold it, my three dol
lars. In the pocketbook were bills to
the amount of $30,-. -
Fear assailed me at this discovery,
but conscience never 'spoke. I btiried
it. in the prune barrel and continued
my work.- He searched for it every
where. He gave me a brutal question
ing and , tortured me "by twisting my
arm until I screamed with pain. But
wild horses would not have dragged
my secret away. , ;
In the pocketbook were some notes
and other papers identifying it I took
out the currency and hid it again in
the prune barrel after a few . days.
Then, one night, I slipped out and left
the pocketbook, with, the papers in it
on the wooden sidewalk, because he
had made hia loss known by word of
mouth and , had announced that he
would give $5 for its return.
The next day the pocketbook was
brought into the store by a man who
said he had found it and who demand
ed the reward. The boss opened it,
found that the $30 was missing and
accused the finder of being a thief. He
refused to pay any reward.
They fought all over the store: The
boss was soundly trounced, and I, piti
ful object of humanity, a scrawny,
half-starved boy and the author of his
misfortune, sneaked behind the coun
ter and choked my mouth with a
shoddy coat sleeve ' to keep from
shrieking with unholy joy. c
Some days later I resurrected the
$30 from the prune barrel and with
this modest fortune left in the night
for parts unknown.
Did I return the money In my later
years of prosperity?' I did not.
Best Way to Keep Apples. '
The best vessels in which to keep
apples are crates or baskets that per

When it commences to reach its full
stage of ripening it is well to sort it
occasionally, and remove and use any

Land Holdings in Mexico.
It is said that land holdings today
are so concentrated in Mexico that
7,000 families hold practically all the
arable land. If the distribution were
in proportion to that in the United
States, John Kenneth Turner has reck
oned, there would be 1,000,000 Mexi
cans holding land Instead of 7,000. In
the state of Morelos 12 proprietors
hold nine-tenths of the farming dis-
I trict. In Chihuahua the Terrazas f am

Administration Must Consider
Country's Needs.
Extravagance of the Past Has to Be
Atoned For by the Democratic
. Party Wise Statesmanship
Now Necessary.
The extravagance of the long ses
sion will not, of course, be repeated
by the short. Not only had the Demo
cratic party violated its platform
promises, but it had in some items pal
pably gone beyond, the needs of the
government. -
Something, however, was to be at
tributed to a lack of information on
the part of those voting the supplies.
They had been misled by a yarn that
the Republicans had been wasting
three hundred millions a year. It was
on the strength of that the promise
at Baltimore about economy had been
made. ,
When the Democrats took charge of
the purse they discovered both their
error and their duty. No such Repub
lican waste had taken place, and hence
no such retrenchment as had been
promised could be made. They found
that large appropriations were neces
sary, and made them. But in their in
experience, they made them too large,
and aoon found themselves swamped.
The only saving was forced by a Re-
oublican Senator Burton who. with
aV long fork, took all the pork out of
the pork barrel. t .
But the Baltimore platform Is no
longer seriously considered. It is now
only a smile-provoker. Even its au
thors share in the general amusement.
The Democracy is advised today of
what the government needs, of what
it should have, and of what the re
sources are. . ;; -: :
While the long session swelled ap
propriations beyond all previous rec
ords, it would be a mistake for the
short session to reduce them to a star
vation size. That would hot be, econo
my, but the reverse-not business, but
a mere political play. There should be
no pork-barrel features in any of the
supply bills, as, for that matter, there
never should be. It has not been neces
sary for the war to teach us Jhat. We
knew it before. '
" But our government is on a large
scale, and rapidly growing, and those
to whom it has been committed should
suDDort It generously. The cheese-
parer is not an economist, and some
times not a patriot, and his advice at
this time possesses far less than its
average small importance.

has rallied to the Republican party

The meaning is plain: The people

SOUTH STILL IN CONTROL
Recent Election Strengthened Parti
san Domination In the House of
Representatives.
Those who have been congratulat
ing themselves that, as one result of
the elections, the South -is no longer
in the saddle," have been just a lit
tle too optimistic. It is difficult to
see( how the influence of the south
ern congressmen will be decreased in
the next congress. With one or two
unimportant exceptions all of the
losses Democracy has sustained has
been among the Democrats from New
England, the North and the West
These three sections, therefore," de
prived of their representation in the
ranks of the majority, will be more
than ever at the mercy of the' men
from Dixie, whose control has been
strengthened, rather than weakened.
since, in a Democratic membership In
the Sixty-fourth congress much small
er than that in this congress, their
own numbers remain practically the
same. The inevitable result of this
will be that when the next house is
organized southern members, already
occupying nearly all the important
chairmanships, will fall heir to such
as will be surrendered by retiring
northern men, while in addition, the
membership of each committee re
maining of the same strength, the
southern men will have to ."double
up, and serve on more committees
than is now the case. This will
strengthen the hold of the Southerner!
cn the machinery of congress. Un
til the Democratic majority has been.
wiped out entirely the South will re
main in the saddle.
FISCAL' SYSTEM TO BLAME
Falling Off of Country's Revenues Can
not Be Attributed to the War
in Europe.
President Wilson, In his "message
asking congress to vote a special tax,
pointed out that the falling off In rev
enue during the month of August was
something between $10,000,000 and
$11,000,000., There was such a fall
ing off, but was it due to the war or
was it a natural result of the Demo
cratic fiscal system? Congressman
Philip Campbell of Kansas seems to
have a sound argument " on his side
whsn. he points put that "the presi
dent referred only to the falling off
in our , revenues for the month of
Auguet of this year, after the war in
Europe began. If he had been dis
posed to give congress and the coun
try all the information be had in his
possession he could have stated that
under the tariff bill passed by this
congress on the third day of October
last the revenues had been constantly
falling, off. (Applause on .the Repub
lican side.) For the month of Jan
uary, 1914, the failure of revenue!
amounted to $5,506,044.26. For the
month of February the falling off in
revenue amounted to $9,995,512.13, al
most as much as In the month of Aug
ust, to which the president pointed
with so much alarm from this rostrum
a few days ago." Collier's Weekly.
Republican Prospects for
The public appearance of a large
number of candidates for the next Re
publican presidential nomination is a
result of the election that is, perhaps,
inevitable. , As a symptom and sign of
the confidence with which the party
looks forward to 1916 it is of interest
and Importance. " But as affording any
clue as to what the party Is to do in
that year the claims of today are of
strictly negligible value.
This la tot the time to select or
even to discuss the question of who is
to lead the Republican party in the
next presidentlaljBontest. The Repub-
lican road to the White House is by
no means clear. One swallow does not
make a summer, nor one off-year elec
tion a presidential victory. Overconfl-
dence has lost many an Important po
litical battle, and the feeling now that
a Republican victory will necessarily
come in 1916 is one of the most effec
tive ways of preventing such an event

Natural Trade Revival.
The Democrats have had a feast of
sour grapes because they cut and
slashed the vines of American enter
prise savagely and ruthlessly by a tie-1
etructive tariff measure. They are wit
nessing the reversal of sentiment in
their behalf because they have power
enough to force the American people
to be satisfied with crumbs instead of
enjoying the whole loaf. It is intoler
able to have them seek to cover xtp
their chagrin by such pretexts as that
of Mr. Bryan, which, coming from a
cabinet member, are most harmful.
Despite all that the discredited Demo
crats may say,' the people are turning
to the Republicans for relief and will
receive it Despite Mr. Bryan and de
spite the Democratic tariff there is a
tendency toward a revival of trade,
due to the vast volume of exports
caused by the war in Europe and the
stimulus to lines of manufacture that
has been created.
Democrats' Real Standing. ;
Last September the Democrats saw
in tha Maine returns an assurance that
the country was with them. All Dem
ocratic outsiders who had participated
in the campaign so expressed them
selves to the president How much
mistaken they were is now an estab
lished fact plain to everybody. They
owe their, slender margin in the next
house to the Bull Moosers. Had all
the Bull Moosers returned to their old
affiliations the Republicans would have
carried the house easily and substan
tially. "Rebuke to Democratic Policies."
"It is a smashing Republican victory
all round," said Nicholas Longworth,
who defeated Representative Bowdle,
"as well as a keen rebuke to the Demo
cratic policies practiced during the last
two years. The Democrats closed
down the factories about twenty years
ago, and they again closed them down
in 1914, but I am pleased to learn that
I will be on hand to help tc open them
up."
It's all right to ride a hobby if you

sensations and' hallucinations "in
some respects similar to those caused
by hashish," and others "like those
experienced by some opium smokers,
especially the multiplication of ob
jects and their bright colors." No
other ill effects followed, and there
was no headache or any disturbance
of the digestion.

the Journal of the American Medical
