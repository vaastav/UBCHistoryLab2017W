SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1882.
COLORED DEMOCRATS.
Jno. W. Garrett, J. W. Garret, Jas.
Swagarty and Alex. Roadman, four
colored men of Cocke County, sign
an address to "the colored people"
and publish it in the Newport Sen
tine), a foiteful little Democratic
newspaper.
Of cours?, this address was writ
ten by a Democrat, and for Demo
cratic purposes. It is full of mis
representa tions. We quote theclos
ing paragraphs:
"If these RDubueans are our
best friend, why have.we not been
given at last one member of the
Legislature from Est Tennessee,
'soeciailv in the district of Mr,
Houk, or Mr. Pettibone, where Re
publicans claim to have everything
theJr own wav?
"Middle and West Tennessee,
where the great Democratic majori
ties pile up, have given ine comreu
Tifionlft thripe memoers. wi cuuu
ed voters think of these things."
Now. the funny thing about the
above is that these three colored
mfimhfira are all ReDUblican?, and
were opposed by the Democrats.
The Democrats in Shelby County
nominated two colored men
on their Legislative ticket in order
to humbug the colored voters,
Enough colored men were thus
humbugged into voting the Demo
cratic ticket to elect all the white
Democrats on the ticket; but the
white Democrats refused to vote
for these two colored Democrats,
and thus defeated them.
If colored men want to be Demo
crats because they love Democratic
principles, let them join that party,
But if colored men join tne Lem
ocratic party in order to have
Democrats elect them to office, they
wilTfind out what their humbugged
brftthren in Shelby learned last
November that the Democrats
prefer a white Republican to a
black Democrat,
Swagerty and the two Garretts
are merely three catpaws to pull
chestnuts out of the fire for Demo-
crate to eat ; and all the reward
they will get will be singed paws.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
Cone-res Tbe President The Cabinet
What Will be Done.
Washington, December 6, 1882.
Notwithstanding the fact that the session
of Congress just opening expires by limita
tion on the fourth of next March, the feel
ing is strong that in these three months will
be passed a great deal of very important
and useful legislation; more, probably, than
has been effected by any session, long or
short, for years past.
So far as bills yet introduced go, they re
late to taxation, purity of elections and civil
service reform. The tax bills so far intro
duced are simply crude propositions, grow
ing out of undue haste on the
part of certain members to make a record
for speed in proposing the abolition of all
internal revenue laws. The ways and
means committee have, however, agreed on
one important measure, namely: the aboli
tion of all internal revenue taxes on
TOBAOOO.
This will likely be agreed to.
Judge Honk's bill for preventing fraud
and intimidation at elections, and insuring
a fair expression and faithful recording of
the will of the people, has met with much
favorable comment, and is likely to receive
the general support of both houses.
Kasson has a bill establishing some fixed
term for subordinate officers and employes
of the government, and something will be
done in this direction, xear after year a
feeling has grown that it was necessary to
do away with the uncertainty which is at
the bottom of much demoralization of the
civil service.
THE PBESXDENT'S MESSAGE
and the accompanying reports of the heads
of departments bristle with suggestions for
Congress to work out. The most import
ant suggestions, of course ; relate to internal
revenue and tariff reductions.
The President recommends the removal
of all internal revenue taxes save those on
whisky, and a general overhauling of the
tariff, to relieve it from crudities and unjust
provisions which are to-day the main source
of whatever weakness afflicts it. The Sec
retary of the Treasury does not go quite so
far, but recommends retaining the internal
revenue tax on whisky, beer and tobacco.
Probably Congress will remove the tax from
tobacco, and all other articles included
the internal revenue laws, except
whisky and beer; or, to speak exactly, "dis
tilled spirits" and "fermented liquors."
As to the tariff, it is not thought that
changes in it will be in the direction of de
parting at all from the protective system,
which has built up the manufactures of the
country and made us a nation instead ol a
colony, but that there will be such a reduc
tion as is demanded by the need of reducing
our revenues to an amount only sufficient
for the
economical administration of the
government, and the prompt payment of
its obligations as they fall due.
The tariff laws now in force were sub
stantially made up during and just after the
war, at a time when the enormous cost of
the rebehon made it necessary to tax to the
uttermost whatever would yield revenue to
meet the extraordinary expenses of the
government, and whoever came before
Congrnsn and painted out something that
could be taxed was looked upon as a public
benefactor. Of course some "jobs" got
into the system, many of which have since
been removed, but some of which
remain. And beside this, some
taxes were put at a figure
then imperatively demanded by the needs
of the government, but which neither reve
nue nor protection now require to be kept at
so high a point. Yet, what would have
been an unbearable burden to any other
country in the world, has been a great and
positive benefit to'our own. First, it has
raised large revenues which have gone to
rapidly diminish the principal and reduce
the rate of interest on the public debt; and,
second, it has greatly stimulated our manu
facturers at home, bringing about competi
tion which has given us all sorts of manu
factured goods at half the price
they would cost to-day if we de
pended on foreign manufacturers.
And while we have been reaping this result
on the one hand a very large class of skilled
mechanics has grown up making the very
best kind of a home , market with good
prices for the productions of our farmers.
Hut now the very prosperity and growth
which this
GBEAT NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Has produced is bringing in an amount of
revenue so greatly in excess of the needs of
the government, either for its current ex
penses or to pay such parts of the
public debt as it can now reach
that tne imperative need is
a reduction of taxation not only to pre
vent extravagant appropriations, but to
escape contraction of the currency through
the accumulation of excessive revenues.
A few ears ago the country was stagger
ing under a load of debt that would have
crusnea any other country that ever ex
isted on the face of the earth. To-day its
greatest need is to guard against excessive
accumulation of revenue. Nothing that
man could speak or write (would go so far
to prove the wisdom and honesty of Re
publican administration as this single fact
The president ana the Secretary of the
Treasury, fully alive to this condition of
things, and strenuously advocating the
strictest economy m the expenditure of
public money, come forward with the
recommendations calculated to give the
country the fullest benefit of this state of
prosperity, and both the President's nies
sage and the report of Secretary Folger are
generally commended as the ablest papers
of the kind that we nave Had in many
years.
Tne report of the Tariff Commission
supplements the executive recommenda
tions ; and this, with the fact that the tariff
commission bill was passed by the Republi
cans in Congress, in perfect good faith,
makes it very probable that congress will
in a short session, do a great deal of good
work.
THE POLITICAL OTJTLOOX
is improving day by day. in New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and
elsewhere in the Northern btatea the Be
publicans were in a condition of apathy and
indifference, peevish, foolish, all the more
so that there was no reason lor it Once
in a while a man gets into a condition of
biliousness and general enssedness. where
ne win make more fuss and noise over a
sore finger or a pimple on his nose than he
would, in a decent frame of mind, over a
broken leg. Any fool can lead him then,
provided he leads him in the direction of
some folly or deviltry. Over-security, idle
nebs, the lies of - malignant newspapers re
peated and reiterated for years past, had
combined in many Northern btates to get
the party into a peevish, fidgetty condition
and a lot of the sorriest, broken-down sore
headed and sore backed political hacks
took advantage of the state of affairs to
raise a howl against the President, against
"bosses," and the Lord knows what; and
they managed to lead off enough men to
defeat the party in inany States. It was
18740 ver again. The result has shown the
foolish followers of these false leaders the
mistake of being led by them. They
brought up , in the ditch with a generally
sprained system, just escaping broken
necks, and they have had enough. Now
they are getting together to meet the dan
ger their folly has produced,
have forgotten their pimples
and sore fingers and are rubbing the lini
ment of truth into their sprains and bruises,
and will be on hand ready for earnest and
honest Bepubliean work when the next
election comes along.
Meantime the President, who has been
the subject of more unjust abuse than any
of bis predecessors, is calmly and steadily
pursuing his way as
A OOOB PBE8EDENT
And good Republican, and as the smoke of
the battle clears away the people are finding
out that he has shown more wisdom and
steady devotion to the good of the party
than any other of our leaders. That
the only policy he - had was to build
lip and strengthen the party in
the South, where it needed strength, leav
ing it to take care of it&elf in the North,
where it was abundantly able to win if so
disposed. In the South we have had great
gains, and there only are we free from great
losses and disasters. Bat the pendulum
will swing back in the .north, and the good
work in the South will continue, and in
1884 we shall be all on hand.
Meantime we shall get a good deal of help
from a Democratic House. Their general
cossedness is bred in their bones and is
bound to come out in the flesh.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Comment's and Criticisms.
The President's message will, like 1
his previous utterances, take rank as
a creditable State paper. Washing- j
ton Star (ind.)
It will soon be forgotten by the
country, for tne .President may be
trusted quickly to revive attention to
himself as an omce-filledr and an
office emptier. Albany Argus (Dem.)
The plain unpretending style of
President Arthur's message, and the
good sense of his views, will com
mend it to the approval of the coun
try. Pmladelpbia Kecord (Ind.)
It is the sort of message the coun
try has leared to expect from PresiN
dent Arthur plain, frank, straight
forward, business-like, with no ats
tempt at fine writing or nonsense of
any kind. Hartford Uurrant (Hep.)
The message transmitted to Con
gress by President Arthur, yesterday,
is interesting in its relation of facts
and its presentation of the govern
ment finances, but calls for little
comment. Trenton True Ameri
can (Ind.)
.President Arthur's message is an
excellent one, and will please the
country very much. It is sensible
throughout, and sensitive to public
opinion, tie improves upon his po
sitions of last year, and advises
Congress .in the main wisely.
Springfield Republican (Ind.)
The President stands squarely on
the platform of progressive Repubs
licanism. He evades no issue, and
his recommendations are of the
plainest description. NewHaven
Palladium (Kep.)
This second message of" President
Arthur is less striking and impressive
than the first. The message of a
year ago, wnen ne was fresh in tne
chair, was a masterly state paper
published in style, elevated in tone
and statesmanlike in its grasp. The
present document is less finished,
less original, less torceiul. It is
rather a commonplace and jejune
Anirrmfi of rirv icl.atiar.ips and dull r-
. mi ' m -i vi i t
ports. The Philadelphia Press
(Rep)
it is a document tnat will repay
the most careful perusal, and cannot
but convince every reader that its
author has closely studied that vast
range of important subjects that
come within his jurisdiction $ has
dealt with them in a spirit of judicial
fairness, and has arranged his state
ments oi tact and conclusion in a
concise, dignified and graceful man
ner. Albany Express (Rep.)
His wnoie message is that of a
cau ious executive who had no very
emphatic views to advance, but de
sires to conduct the public business
with credit and to show that he has
overlooked none of the subjects
which traditionally belong in a
President's message, from the Japas
nese indemnity to polygamy in Utah.
The document will be referred to
the appropriate committees, and' the
country will go on as before. Phila
delphia Times (Ind.)
England Begins to See that America
Exists.
London Times.
We can no longer exist without
America. The country of which,
witnin recent memory, we were
childishly and vindistively jealous,
now proves to be the country by
which to a great extent we live. It
sends us corn by the hundreds of
ship-loads. Its beef competes with
ours, or rather becomes ours, and is
sold at our . native prices, under the
hands of the enterprising Enerlish
butchers. While to the Roman poet
the tnougnt ol getting fash from the
Caspian was. the thought of odious
luxury, with us, it is the classes that
cannot afford the Tay or the Tweed
that send to the Columbian river for
their salmon. But the idea of a
growing America, and of a Canadian
Dominion which is rapidly increasing
in wealth and numbers, is much more
than the idea of a new market and a
new source of Bupply. - It is an idea
wnicn aliects tne whole of the po
ht'.cal life of Europe. We see a new
Europe. We see a new Europe, as
it were, erowinsr ud on the other
side of the Atlantic ; and though
their problems are for the moment
not ours, and though they resolve to
keep aloof from our affairs, their
very exisience nas its innaence on
us. Little by little the political ner.
spective alters; the world is seen to
contain other nations than the three
- . . r
or four which have been used to con
siaer memseives as tne only pro
gressive and truly civilized nations.

Brown's Ikon Bittbks, I tried a
bottle, with most surprising results.
Previous to taking Brown's Iron
Bitters, everything I ate distressed
me, and I suffered greatly from a
burning sensation in the stomach,
which was unbearable. Since tak
ing Brown's Iron Bitters, all my
troubles are at art end. Can eat any
time without any disagreeable re
sults. I am practically another
person. Mrs. W J. Flvnn,
