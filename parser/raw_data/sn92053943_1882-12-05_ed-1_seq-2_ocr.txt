the hope that authority and means to be
gin thiit important wt)rtwDl sooif bbpj

to the propriety of making more adequate
provisions for arming and equipping the

The secretary of war calls attention "ter
the fact Of nn embarrassment growing pat j
or tne recent act oi congress, maHng the
retirement of officers of the arte Compul
sory at the age of sixty-four.- Ta act of
1878 is still in force, which limits to four
hundred as the number of those Who can
be retired for disability, or upon, their own
application. The two acts, wheil construed
together, seem to forbid re!Iving,
even for absolute incapacity, the ofijeers
who do not fall within the purview of Ifhe
latter statute save at such times as there
is chances to be less than four ha6&?d
names on the retired list. Ttere ar sow

RIVERS AND ' HARBORS.
The grounds that impelled me to wjth
hold my sitature frofcn the bill entitled
An act-ffskinff apDTOpria,ion for the
constrdCtlom repair.tandfpr JServatlon; of
certain worse on risers ana harbors," which
became a law near the close of our last
session prompt me to express that no
similar measure be deemed necessary dur
ing tne present session of congress. 1 n-
deed such a measure would now be open
to serious objection in addition to that
which was lately urged upon your atten
tion. I am informed by the secretary of
war that the greater portion of the sum an
pronriated for the various items specified
In Hi-it .remains unexpended of the new
ofts ; which it authorized; expenses have
been incurred upoxt two only forwhfch the
total afpropriation ws $210,000. The

this exhibit that as concerns most items
to which the net of August 2, 1882, relates
there can be no need of further appropria
tions until after the close of u present
sosRiOB. -if. no-ever. "anvctt6n- should
be necessary in respect to particular ob
jects it will be entirely feasible to provide
tor those objects by appropriate legisla
tion. It ia possible, for xaffipl, that i
delay until the assembling" of the next con
gress to make additional provision for the
Mississippi river improvements might be
attended with serious consequences. If
such should appeared be the case a just
dui reiatiHg to the snmecr would command
my approval. This leads me to offer a
suggestion which I trust will commend it
self to the wisdom of congress. Is it not
advisable: that grants 4f-considerable sums
of money "for "diverse and ' independent
scnemes or internal improvement should
be made the subject of separate and dis
tinct legislative enactments? It will
scarcely be &ainsayed even by those who
fasrorintoe'taoBt liberal expenditures for
purposes sought e be ceom-

or in both, is one which is to be most dep
recated." Unless it is remediable it is inev
itably tending to secure the success of the
bill as a whole, though man v of the items.
if separaratelv considered, could scarcelv
fail of rejection. By the adoption of the
course I recommended every member of
congress, whenever opportunity should
arise for giving bis influence and vote for
nrerttorioosappre-priations, which be would
be enabled to do without being called upot
to sanction others deserving his approval.
So, al6o, would the executive be afforded
a full opportnnlty to exercise his constitu

ers which' commended themselves to bis
judgment. It may be urged, in opposition
to these suggestions, that a number of
works of international improvement,
which are justly entitled to governmental
aid, is so .great as to render impracticable
"several apprftpriation bills therefor, or even
for such a comparatively limited number
las to make a disposition of large sums of
money, 1 ins objection may be well
founded, or' whether it be or not, the ad
vantages which would be likely to ensue
from the adoption of ILe course I have
recommended, may perhaps be more effec
tually attained by another, which I respect
fully submit to congress as an alternative
proposition. Itwasr provided bv the-tson-
stitutioas fefffotmeen at our states that the
executive may disapprove any item oi'
items of a bill appropriating money, where
upon the part of the bill apprpved shall be

states wherein some such provision as the
foregoing is a part of the fundamental law,
are: Aiabania,"Califoruia. Colorado, Flor

Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia. I
commend to 7011 careful consideration the
question whether the amendment of the
federal constitution in the particular indi-cated-woOld

to the execu-
tive. . and
is sometimes a serious public
mischief.
THE TTATT."
It appears by the secretary's report that
the available naval force of the United
states consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single tur-
a n number of smooth-bore guns and
rifled "efcnnon. The cruising vessels should
be gradtliHy replaced by irotnor steel ships,,
the mouitdts. by modern - armored -vessels;
and the arfeament by higft S power rifled
bans. The teiconstruction "of our navv.
4iich was recfttnmended in my 'last mes
sage, was begun dv congress authorizing
in its recent act the construction of two
large steel vessels of the character recom
mended by the lafte naval advisory board,
"I'StfOTftjeet to approval of a new advisory.

act. ';' tiM atit-ation to the fecommemda

ccubJCTf 'f -smaller dimensions, and one
fleet-dispatch vessel, and that , ap propria-.
tions be maae ior nign power tiannon, lor
torpedo service, and for other harbor de
fenses. Pending considefation' "by con
gress of the policy to be hereafter adopted
in conducting the eight large large , jiavy
yards and their expensive establishments,
the secretary advocated a reduction of ex
penditures therefor to the lowest possible
amounts. For the purpose of affording
the officers and seamen of the navy Oppor
tunity for excercise and discipline in their
1 profession, under appropriate control aud
ejection, toe secretary advises that the
1 jthouse and coast survey be transferred,
w organised, from tl treasury t
navy department; and he also suggests,
for. the reasons which he assigns, that
similar transfer may wisely be made of the
cruising revenue vessels. The secretary
forciblv depicts the mtimate-connection
and independence of ihe "tsavyandlbe
commercial marine, aad iuvites attention
to - the continual decadence tf th latter,
unJ he V ofresnoudina tratisfer of our
growing commerce to foreign bottoms
This subject is one of the utmost import
ance to our welfare. The methods of re
viving American ship-building and of rein
stating the United Spates flag in the ocean
carrying trade should receive the imme
diate attention of congress. We have
mechanical skill and abundant material
for the construction of modern iron steam
ships in fair competition with our com
mercial rivals. Our disadvantage in
building ships is the greater cost of labor,
and in sailing them higner taxes ana great
er interest on capital, while the ocean
highways are already monopolized by our
formidable comioutors. inese oosiacies
should in some wav be overcome, and for
rapid communication with foreign lands
we should not continue to depend wholly
upon vessels built in other countries and
sailing under foreign flags. With no
United States steamers on the principal
lines to foreign ports our facilities for ex
tending our commerce are greatly restrict
ed. while the countries that build and sail
the ships and carry the mail and passen
gers. obtain thereby conspicuous ad van
tages in increasing their trade.
POSTAIi MATTERS.
The report of the Postmaster General
gives evidence of the satisfactory condition
of the department, and contains many val
uable data and accompanying suggestions
which cannot fail to be of interest.
The information which it affords that
the receipts for the fiscal year have ex
ceeded the expenditures must be gratifying
to congress and to the people of the coun
try as matters which may fairly claim par
ticular attention. I refer you to his ob
servations in reference to the advisability
of changing the present basis for fixing
salary and allowances, of extending the
functions f. postal establishment sd s to
have under Its carrtrol, the tele jraph sys
tem of the cfruntrv, mougb from this lffst
and important recommendation I must
withhold my concurrence. At the last
session of congress several bills were intro !
duced into the House of Representat ives
for. the reduction of letter postage to the
rate of 2 cents per half ounce, Ibava
given much study and reflection to' this!
subject and am thoroughly persuaded that
such reduction would be for the best inter
ests of the public. It has been the policy
of the government from the foundation,
to defray as far as "possible the expenses of
carrving the mails by a direct tax in tne
form of postage, and it has never been
claimed, however, that this service ought
to be productive of a net revenue.
As has been stated already, the report
of the postmaster general shows that there
is now a very considt-rabie surplus . in tus
department, and that henceforth the re
ceipts are likelv to increase at a much
greater rah than tne f necessary- expend!
tures. Uniteat j56nCfihajz4 iahotadAiialbe
existing laws, the profits of the postal ser
vice will in a very few years swell the
revenues uf the government many millions
of dollars J The J irofc 'seems fcouspaCuous,
therefore, for some reduction in the rates
of postage. In what shall that reditction
consist? A revision of the legislation
which has been had upon the subject dur
ing the last thirty years discloses that do
mestic letters constituted the only class of
mail matter which has never been favored
by a substantial reduction of rates. I am
convinced that the burden of maintaining
the service falls most unequally upon that
class, and that more than any other is en
titled to present relief. That such relief
may be extended without detriment to
other public interests will be discovered.
Upon reviewing the results of former re
ductions. immediately prior to the act of
1845 the postage upon a letter composed
of a single sheet was as follows r
If cenveyed 30 miles or less, six cents;
between 30 and 80 miles, ten cents; be
tween 80 and 150 miles, 13 r cents; be
tween 150 and 400 miles, 18$ cents; over
400 miles, 25 cents. By the act of 1845 the
postage upon a single letter, conveyed for
any distance under 300 miles, was fixed at
five cents, and for a greater distance, ten
cents, fifty per cent reduction m tax for
carriage would at once increase the num
ber of letters consigned to the mails. The
advantages of the secresv would leed to a 1
very general substitution of sealed packets
for postal cards and open circulars and in
divers other ways the volume of first class i
matter would be enormously augmented.
Such an increase amounted in England in
the first year after adoption of penny pos
tage was more than 125 per cent. As a
result of careful estimates the dteails of
which cannot be here set out, I am con
vinced that the deficiency for the first year
would be small. .....
If congress should approve these sug -gestions
it may be deemed desirable to
supply to some " extents the deficiency
which must for, time result by increasUng
the charge for carrying merchandise, which
is nowmly 16 eeits per pound; but even
without .such. tf increase I-ani coafiehHit
that the receipts under the diminished
rates would equal the . expenditures after
the lapse of three "br four years.
THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW.
The report of the department of justice
brings a new to your notice the necessity
of enlarging the p reseat system of federal
jurisprudence" so as to effectally answer
the requirements of the ever; increasing
litigation with which it is called upon to
deal. .-
The attorney general renews the sugges
tions of bis predecessor, that in tu inter
ests off ostico better I prof isions ' thad th
existing laws afford should be made in cer
tain judical districts, for fixing the fees of
witnesses and inrors. .
In my mgssage pf , December Jast, J ,r!Br,
f erred to -pdingJcriiiinal trpceedugs
growing out of alleged frauds in what is
known as the star route service of the post,
office department, and I advised you that
I had enjoined upon the attorney general
and associate counsel to whom the inter
ests of the government were entrusted, the
duty of prosecution with the utmost vigor '
of the law all persons who might be found
A trial of
one of these cases has since occurred. It
occupied for many weeks the attention of
the supreme court of this district and was
conducted with, great zeal and ability. It
resulted in a disagreen at of tlvp jury, but
the case has been again placed upon the
calendar and Will shortly be, retried. If
any guilty person shall finally escape pun
isbment for their offenses, it will not be
for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on
the part of the prosecution. I trust that
some agreement may be reached which will
speedily enable congress, with the con
cuireTice of the .cxecutiw, to afford the
commercial community the benefits of a
national bankrupt, law.
THE INTERIOR.
The reports of the secretary of the inte
rior with its accompanying document pre
sents a full statement of the varied opera
tions of the department. In respect to
Indians nothing has occurred which has
changed or seriously modified the views to
which I devoted much space in a former
communication to congress I renew the re
commendation therein. Giving the Indian
the protection of the law as allotting land
and in severalty to such as desire it and
making suitable provision for the educa
tion of the youth such provisions as the
secretary forcibly maintain will prove un
availing unless it is broad enough to in
elude all those who are able and willing to
make use of it, and should not solely re
late to intellectual training, but also to in
struction in such manual labor and simple
industrial arts as can be made practically
available. Among other important sub
jtc'.s which are included within the 'secre
tary s report which will doubtless furnish
occasion for consideration is the subject of
education.
Jib survey of material condition can
fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and
intellectual welfare of the people. The
census returns disclose and alarming in
crease of literacy in certain parts of the
country where provision for schools is
grossly inadequate. It is a momentous
question for the decision of congress
whether immediate substantial aid should
be extended by the general government for
supplementing the efforts of private bencli
jcenee and of stat&and tcn ttoral legislation
in behalf Tf education.
It is hardly probable the legislation in
this regard will be deemed desirable until
the effect of the existing laws shall be more
closely observed and studied. I congratu
late you that the commission under whose
supervision these laws have been put in
operation, are encuraged to believe that
the evil at which they are aimed may be
suppressed without resort to such radical
measures us in some quarters have been
thought indispensible for success.
THE TERRITORIES.
The close relation of the general govern
ment to the territories preparing to be
great states, may well engage your special
attention. 'It is there that the Indian dis
turbances mainly occur and that the ixly-
gamy has found room for its growth. I
cannot doubt that a careful survev of ter
ritorial legislation woud be of the highest
Utility; lif ar.d property wnuW become
more secure ; the liabiflty of outbreaks (e-
tween Indians and "Whites would be les
sened; the public domain would be more
securely guarded, and better progress bo
made in the ins ruction of the young.
Alaska is still without any form of civil
government. If means were provided for
the education of its people and the protec
tion of their lives and property, the im
mene resources of the region would invite
permanent settlement and open a new
field to enterprise and industry.
Til K AORICtTLTt RAL DEPARTMENT.
Tii- repot t of the Commissioner of Agri
culture presents an acrount of the labors
of that department during the past year,
and includes information of much interest
to the general publie. The condition of
the forests of the country and the waste
ful manner in which their destruction is
taking place gives cause for serious appre
hension. Their action in protecting the
earth's-furface, in modifying the extremes
of climats, and in regulating and sustain
ing the flow of springe and streams is not
well understood, and their importance in
relation to the growth and prosperity of
the country cannot be safely .disregarded.
They are fast disappearing before the de
structive fires and the necessary require
ments of our increasing population and
their total extinction cannot be long de
layed unless better methods than now pre
vail shall be adopted for their protection
and cultivation. The attention of Con
gress is invited to the necessity of addit
ional legislation to secure the preservation
of the valuable forests still remaining on
the public domain, especially in the ex
treme Wesb rnJStates and Territories, where
the necessity for their preservation is great
er than in less mountainous regions, and
where the prevailing dryness of the cli
mate renders their restoration, if they are
once destroyed, well nigh impossible.
THE CLOSING YEAR
has been replete with blessing, for which
we owe to, the Giver of all good our rever

harmony of ur foreign "-relation's, . for the
decay of-acctional animosities, for the ex

spread of intelligence and the conserving
of the public credit, for the growth of the
country tn all the elements of the nation's
greatness. For these and countless other
blessings we should rejoice and be glad. I
trust that under the .inspiration of tibia
great prosperity our councils may be har

secure the adoption of measures in which
