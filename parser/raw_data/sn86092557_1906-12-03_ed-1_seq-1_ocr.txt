EXPLAINS LAW ON
VARIOUS KINDS
Of VIOLATIONS
Emphasizes
Duties of Jurors
Circuit Court convened this morning.
Judge Mason made a strong
charge to the grand jury. He said that
the only way to enforce the law against
criminals was through the grand Jury.
"This State," said the aide jurist, "has
a good system of law, but Its enforce
ment depends up4n the duty of the
grand jurors." He said that as the
grand jury hears but one Bide of the
case it should be careful In Its pre
sentments. After the Jury is reasonably
sure that an offense has been committed
It is the duty of the jury to
tlnd out if It can who committed the
offense. The duty of the juror Is
often an unpleasant one. Many times
his duty compels -him to do things
that he would rather not, biyt It Is a
duty that must be performed.
Ju'dge Mason recited the statutes
governing elections and Instructed the
jury to Inquire diligently Into the elec
tlons and ascertain If possible If any
frauds were committed. He said thai
there would he uo Illegal elections un
der his administration If the grand
juries would st.aiU.by the court. He
said that hh had the men who held
the elections and those who assisted
In conducting them summoned before
the grand, jury because It was right
that the Jury should lmve the stave
ments of the best men rather thnr
the statements of disreputable per
sons. The Judge said that their wo:
an idea fixed In a good many people
that most of the voters were booJIers
but this he said was not true.
The law governing assessments and
licenses was carefully gone over, A
whiskey dealer cangot sell liquor to r
man that Is drunk. If he does, his II
cense enn he taken away. There liai
been some trouble In determining
when a man is drunk, owing to the dif
ferent opinions of the circuit Judges
'but this question has recently beer
settled by the Supreme Court.
The law governing miners an.
mines and the game and fish laws wee
brought to the notice of the gran.
Jury.
