St Petersburg, Dec. 14. The gov
ernment Is making little headway In
crushing the telegraph strike. The
wires of a few lines over which the
service has been temporarily restored
are constantly cut and no. sound wire
..' Is working out of St Petersburg this
morning. The news from the Baltic
provinces today Is to the effect that
many German landlords who have not
flown are establishing a net work of
. small forta and are standing a regular
' siege. There has been much killing
and burning. The Inhabitants of the
' Baltic provinces now residing In St.
Petersburg were Immensely gratified
at the publication yesterday of an im
-serial ukase promising local self gov
' eminent which they say means the
Mbundoumtmt of the Russian policy
which began in 18G7 to destroy the
unity qj the old province of Llthanua.
Cries for a strong policy to end the
tyranny of the revolutionary organs
are openly taken up by such men as
Charles Von Schwaebach, former min
ister of agriculture. In an Interview
be denounced Premier Witte's policy
as fatal, declares that strike law will
be as useless as press law and says
that the only sane method is to an
swer by force threats of the organ
izations which are calling on the peo
ple to make armed resistance. Snrh
Interviews Increase the feeling that I Miner Contention to Make

other hand It Is declared the premier

fighting him.
