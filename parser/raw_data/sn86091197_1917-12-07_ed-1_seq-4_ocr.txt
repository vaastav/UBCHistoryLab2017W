YOUR PART N THE WAR
RIGHT NOW
A condition of war in a fight for
all that is worth having, now con
fronts the American people, and
along with the American people are
those who live in Bingham county.
Bingham county has a fight for life,
and the larger organizations of state
and nation and the world-wide
boards governing plans and distri
bution and levies, will pass the de
mands and assessments down the
line to us for Immediate fulfillment.
Under these conditions a new duty
confronts each citizen, and it is
worth while to learn that duty now
and prepare to meet it. This war is
not to be settled alone on the fields
of battle, but primarily in the indus
tries, and the peoples who have sup
plies always ready when needed and
who have supplies for use the day
after the opponents have none, are
expected to name the terms of peace.
Bingham county In common with
all the others in all the states, is or
ganizing its forces to mobilise sup
plies and to conserve supplies so that
mobilizing may be orderly and last
ing, The time has come for every
citizen to make an adjustment deep
down in his own bosom; an adjust
ment that says his olrn private af
fairs shall hereafter be second to the
needs of his country, and when an
authorized member of the defense
committee calls upon him for any
service or material over which he has
control, it should be furnished
promptly without any ifs or argu
ments or any kind of useless delays.
This is a time to set aside all
local differences, mistrusts and nar
row selfishness, and to cultivate the
spirit of unity. It is the time to put
public good ahead of private gain,
and the man who has been training
himself all his life to lookout for
number one, has now arrived at the
that
period when
he has
jthwfnis country needs, afitt
y to give It freely as it is
be
led.

READ PRESIDENT
WILSON MESSAGE
In this issue we print a synopsis
of the president's message delivered,
at the opening of congress Monday.
It urges the necessity of America
getting under the burdens of the war
with the understanding that it is to
be a long, hard war, and to be
fought with the determination that
the masters of Germany, not the
German people, but their masters,
must be crushed. He recommends
a declaration of war against Austria,
but not against Germany's other al
lies until such time as they stand
directly in our way.
