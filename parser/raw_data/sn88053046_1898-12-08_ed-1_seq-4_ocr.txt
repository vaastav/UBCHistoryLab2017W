Reform in U»y
The question of reform in Levy Court
management of county affairs is bound
to come before the next session of the
General Assembly. The condition of
affairs in New Castle county demands
attention} Kent county concerns are
not in tho best shape, while in Sussex
county there is no denying that an
appalling state of affairs prevails.
In the latter county it is admitted
by papers of both politioal parties that
the oounty finances are in a most de
plorable condition. The Sussex Re
publican of Georgetown last week as
serted that the county debt
but that probably no one knew exactly
how large it
from a Republican paper, and the Levy
Court has been under Republican con
trol for the past four or five years.
The statement, therefore, can be ac
cepted as absolute truth.
Commenting upon this remarkable
déclara tiop,Every Evening showed how
the Legislature, upon being appealed
to 'peveral years ago, had authorized
the bonding of Sussex county in the
sum of $30,000, for the purposo of
wiping out the then existing floating
debt The floating debt was liquidated,
but now it is even larger than it wa9
then,while the loan of $30,000 remains,
interest-bearing burden upon the
taxpayers of tho oounty.
Now comes the Milford Chronicle,
another Republican paper, and says
that the present, floating debt of the
county is at least $45,000 -
mates the county's total indebtedness,
both bonded and floating, at $75,000.
For a county of the population and
resources of Sussex, this is a frightful
showing. And yet there is
Its truth—and the probabilities
that the situation is even worse. It is
a fact that the registration fees arising
from the late election, amounting to
about $8,000, did not fairly get a rest
ing plaoe in the count}* treasury. The
entire amount was quickly absorbed in
cashing outstanding orders,
there was nothing left with which to
pay the expenses of holding the elec
tion,and the election officers are whist
ling for their pay.
"No one

the Milford Chronicle, and in this
statement it sustains the Sussex Re
publican. "This indicates poor busi
acumen,'' it adds, "and there is
great need of earnest and quick reform
in methods—by the Levy Court, in
guarding against inroads on the treas
ury through the offleo of clerk of the
peace by refusing to allow the largo
and unreasonable charges for work
given out through that office—in other

relief proposed for tho benefit of Sussex
oounty, and to compel her people to city
work out their own salvation under
existing conditions. The frightful only
state of affairs now so generally and that
contritely admitted was charged during
the recent campaign, and was a dis
tinctlve issue. The Republican papers be
did not deny the charges; they simply not
ignored them. The Democratic papers and

The press of the oountry, judging
from the comments of the morning
papers of this locality, is no^ at all
pleased with the message of President
McKinley. And there is small doubt
that the feeling of the press accurately
represents tho feeling of the publio.
The trouble with the message is
that, despite its great length, there
"is nothing in it." It is a mere sum
marization of the public affairs of the
past year, with which the people were
made thoroughly familiar by the news
papers from day to day. As the New
York Herald says :
True to his habit of throwing down
the reins, the President in this inspir
ing moment of our history has nothing
to suggest, takes no initiative, strikes
the keynote of no new policy. He
merely collates a dreary report present
ing numerous facts, and leaves the rest
to Congress and to God. There are
some facts, however, which he doe9
not give.
In the seven thousand words de
voted to a history of the
searches in vain for any
sympathy or regret for
soldiers left to suffer, and many, alas
to die of starvation and fever in hos
pital and camp through official in
difference or incompetence. On this
moves tho
Î iresaion of
e gallant
subjeot, which so
heart of the people, nothing is said.
There is no such word in the message
as Alger or "Algeriern."
As to the future government of our
possessions Mr. McKinley says,
"Discussion will be appropriate after
the treaty of peaoe shall bo ratified.
Touohing Cuba, it will be necessary to
give aid and direction to its people
to form a government for themselves,"
and about the Nicaragua Canal the
commission is nearly ready to report,
and the construction of this maritime
highwuy and its control by
mnt "are propositions which,
not, Congress will duly appreciate and
wisely act upon. "
In the opinion of the Philadelphia
Record, "a longer or a duller message

tho Congress sinco

important topic,there

tenor of newspaper comment.

Washington, Doe.3.—Senator Eugene
Hale, It., (Mo.) yesterday announced
I his opposition to tlie peace treaty
which is being formulated in Parle,
He is opposed to the acquisition of the
Philippines, and his antagonism to the
treaty will be based upon that section
of the treaty which deals with the
| Philippine questioon.
"The negotiation of the treaty, un -
fortunate as it is,' said the Senator
today, "by no means insures the actual
annexation of the Philippine Islands,
It is uncertain when the treaty will be
signed, or when it will be submitted to
the Senate, and still more uncertain
whether it will over bo ratified. I he
responsibility is so vast and the solid
Hide ol the publio so great that ample
time will be given to its discussion
and to getting the real facts before the
American people.
"Many things will bo found out
which are now not known,and tho evils
of the proposed annexation will so grow
on tho public mind and upon Congress
and npon the President that it is by
no means unlikely that
months or a year everybody, instead of
being for annexation of the islands, will
want to be well rid of them.
"The people of the United States
will find out that the commerce of the
Philippines is very limited in extent:
that they are inhabited by a people
whose habits and wants forbid an in
creuse of trade, and that, under tho
j scheme of annexation presented to us.
| this trade is to bo shared equally with
Spain and all other competing nations,
| What is called the 'open door' policy
j cuts down the interest of the United
j States in th<% Philippine trade to
point where it makes no figure in 01
commerce. The entiro trade of the
islands, if wo had it nil, not the profit
derived from it but the whole amount
of trade, will not, in any year, pay the
expenses of tho army ancl the navy that
tho United States will be obliged to
maintain thoro.
"Tho people will seo at once sp
upon Congress a proposition l
standing army of 100,000 men, costing
yearly more than $100,(XX),000, and a
naval increase qf from $15,000,000 to
; $30,000.000 a year in addition, all of
which must coiuo by levy of taxation.
Not only will no war tax be repealed,
but the present tax must be increased,
"The people of the Pacific coast will
find out that if we admit 8,000,000 or
10,000,000 of Malays, Tagals and
Negritos to become a part of
try and to have some or all the privi
leges of citizenship, we must necessarily
give to the Chinese who are alreadv in
tho country tho same privileges. Tho
people of the South will find out that
the admission of these alien races to
the United States will bo another
added intensification of tho raco prob
lern which is today a standing menace
in our own borders. The great Irish
American element of our population
will find out that, notwithstanding
in Lord Salisbury's characteristic sneer,
in his Guildhall speech, nt the
policy of tho United States, the British
Foreign Office is the inspiration of
present diplomacy, and, although
thousands of these Irish-Americans
have of late years beep voting the Re
publican ticket, their protest over
presont conditions capnot fqil to be
loud and deep.
if this. with tho business
men of the country and with all
thoughtful men, the peril of this de
parture from the settled policy of tho
government will bo seen more dourly

Washington, Dec. 3.—The Imperial
ists are continually saying to their
opponents, what tho President said to
Mr. Erving Winslow of Boston and his
associates tho other day : "You oppose
tho annexation of our newly Required
territory and population to the U
States, but you offer us no alternative
plan for disposing of our acquisitions.
What would you have us do with theso
lands and people?"
Without stopping to ask by what
right the imperialists propose to saddle
the task of getting the country out of

a aornpo upon the citizens who did
their utmost to prevent its getting into

the Senator has not repudiated since it
was put into his mouth by several
reputable newspapers, answers itself at
ono point, for in an earlier sentence

except so far as we may nerrnit.
Surely Mr. Morgan, though ho may

he began espousing every hobby that
has come before Congress with a bad
name at it« start, must havo heard of
tho land-in-sqveraity law, whereby
Indian becomes a citizen as soon ns he
has reaohod the point of owning real
property. Ho must lie aware, also that

much to say that praotioaily nothing

American Indians and citizenship to
day except tho Indians' own re
luctance. Congress never finishes a
session without having made a move
towards the absorption of a fresh body
of Indians into our body politic. Com
missions are appointed, under laws
which Senator Morgan himself helped
to enact, to visit tribes and work npon
their sentimeutal side, and sometimes
upon tho avarice of tho influential
chiefs and .head men, to induce them
to take allotments of land in sevorality
and become citizens. Now, if Senator
Morgan is in earnest, and not merely
