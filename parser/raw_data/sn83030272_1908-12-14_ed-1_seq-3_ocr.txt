The trouble bogan It wan assorted by
eminent members of tho Appropriations
Committee today nearly ft year ago
hen AttorneyGeneral Bonaparte aj
poare < i before the committee and naUoj
for an appropriation for Secret Service
ajents as Sfr Uopaparte was opposed
to accepting lrDoJlparte Chief Wilkle
department for tho reason that the
Treasury Department fixed the compen
sation of tho men and the AttorneyGet
oral bad no complete authority over the

refused AttorneyGeneral Dip rto re
quest on tho ground that there was no
authorlT in law fdr such an uppropr
atlon
After the refusal AttorneyOenon
Bonapartes reuest an Inveatlgatio
was tx guii and it was found that Chief
tVllkioH men contrary to the statuteS
S had been distributed in thu depart
ment of Justice State War Navy and

which Urn President now male the basis
for Ills attack on Congress
The result of the practice of distrll
itlnKvthe Sotlot Hervlc men in the vari

tho Bandry civil act of last session pro
lilbluxl it was declared today was to
maintain twice a many men on the pay
rolls of the Secret Service on wero necoj
sary to carry out the purposes for which
that service was created and for which
purpose only the appropriations for that
service Are available
Concerning that part of Mr Hoofwvelt
message as to the land frauds it may 0

given by Secretary Garfield of the In

mltte on Appropriations 01 March 2
wt In reply to this question from

ary do you employ Secret Service men
In this work to investigate claim
and contests Secretary Garfield replied
None aal and thatU ono of tin
Mints that I want t bring out In connco
rmL with the general question of the
force gentanono of them H employed
a1 detective
At this hearing before the Appropria
ions Committee Secretary larileld sale
hat the DopartmenUof the Interior had
abandoned the use of Secret Service men
In the Investigation of land frauds ant
rave us ono of the reasons that their lack
of knqwjpdgs of thP public land Inws D
such as Jdg render the results of their
investigations practically worthless and
he citeU lan illustration the dismissal
oftliirty odd lad fraud cases in Denver
which wore found on C mlatlol to be
baaed upon inuuRlclcnt evidence to justify
The Republican Congressmen who went I
carefully over the Presidents criticisms i
today said emphatically that the pro
vision Inserted l the present Sundry Civil
act concerning the Secret Service Divi
sion in no way limits the right or authority
of any department of rgt Government
to employ Secret Service men aside from
those employed in the Treasury Depart
ment for specific statutory purposes and
that this foot will no doubt convince many I
that the criticisms of President Roosevelt
are wholly unwarranted
It wholy shown in the hearings before
the House Appropriations Committee
that there were 820 experienced detectives
ho reoords had been investigated and
Rhone applications had been placed on
die for appointment in the Secret Ser
vice Division of the Treasury Department
mont and it was tho Republican testi
tnony today thatll was entirely com
man for the head of any executive
department needing the service of the
Secret Service to employ any of these
CO men or to employ any detective
should ho desire C dose The drift for
a number of years under President R
ielt according to the testimony of A
dB tan t Chief Moran before the Appropriations
priations Committee and in the knowl
jdgeof others baa been in the direction
if building up a large Secret Service
department in the Government The
theory of the Government before Mr
loosevelt was elected was that thor
was but one branch of th public service
where a permanent Secret Service was
equlred and lhatvwas the Treasury D
lartrrient for the protection or tho money
of the Governmentogninst counterfeiting
and latterly for the protection of the
wrson of the President Mr Roosevelt I

Youre mistaken that Is not aat
Thats a raccoon Didnt you ever hear

it cries
The mournful wall kept up and In II few
minutes nior Haldeots of the block
wero up aftkiug one another what the
trouble was all about Somo said bur
liars others said a murder After nn
hours excitement the wail from the tree
lot upand tboresidents went to bed again
As dayjlgbt came on the wall started
up afresh and it became known that 11
wasa 1tup tho treea white cat knowh
to some of tho children on the block nil
Haggerino the Tramp
Haggcrino kept up his hoI which
Became i so disturbing that Dr Isaac
Davidson of 22 West llfith street called
up Police Headquarters and asked I if the
ca couldnt be shot or taken away
The police of the oat 104th street
station were told to send a man around
ind see what could be done Policeman
CoQgan got the job Coogan weigh
nearly 200 pounds and ho balked at climb
Ing the tree Uo said ho might do it If
he had an extension ladder Air Fin
calleda conventionof the neighbors and
iBked for suggestions One woman said
hat coaxing would bring him down and
another suggested that thoy puta bird In
a cage sd tnaf the cat could see It Sill
itiotller suggested that they send in II
Iro alarm and have the firemen run up 11
udder One man said
Why all this talk about a cat Le
policeman shoot him and there will be
an end to the wholo trouble If that cat
18 going to stay up In tho tree all nigh
you can bet I wont stand it
Policeman Coogan was invited to join
the conference Juo said he would not
climb trop If thocat never came down
and the only remedy he could suggest
was that tho Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty Animals be notified They
have men who are used to1 tree climbing
jtnct maybe they could get the cat dqwi
without killing hlmhe said
The society was communicated will
mdtwo men were sent uo yesterday at
srnoon but all their efforts to get too cut
down were unavailing and at 9 oclopl
last night Haggcrino was still up in I lit
tree howling aa wildly as ever Some ot
the tenants went to tho roofs of their
houses and threw old shines sticks and
anything they could got but ho refused to
budge an Inch

Some comment was caused yesterday
Upon the clash between AttornoyGoneri
Charles Bonaparteand former Aslstnnt
AttorneyGeneral James W Book which
occurred at the dinner Pennsylvania
SoCiety at the WadorfAstoria
Mr Deck was ready explain and to
amplify the statement he made in his
Impromptu speech Saturday night At his
home 47 East Sixtyfourth street yester
day afternoon he said I
Eoally there was no bitter feeing
between Mr Bonaparte and myuef as the
rult of the litUe tilt between us lost
night It was just one of those little
things that liven a banquet and really
there is no aftermath worth discussing
You see I wont to the dinner unpre
pared with notJ2 and I epoko oitem
pdraneousfy It was a mistake to believe
las has bo reported in some quarters
that I went there loaded for Mr Bona
parte I did not know what he was going
to soy andnaturolly ho could not know
what I was going to say
When I started in the course of my
speech to allude to the speech credited
to Mr Bonaparte and delivered at the big
antitrust conference of thoCivio Federa
tion in Chicago a couplo of years ago Mr
Bonaparte interrupted me with a dis
claimer saying that he could not have
delivered the speech I oHuded to since ho
w not present at the conference < While
lie was still on his feet he made a tacit
idmltrion that his sentiments anont
trust regulation bad suffered a change
jlnoe that affair In Chicago d
After the AttorneyGeneral had taken
ils seat I talked with him laughingly on
the subject of ourargument Then it
iras that Mr Bonaparte admitted that the
ipeech tiat had boon delivered or read
In Chicago had been one that ho had
ireYiouslymadeelBewhere That speech
le sold had been token to Chicagoby a
friend and road before the convention of
the Civic Federation 9o you see I was
ight after all
But let me assure you that the con
versation Mr BotaapartA and I had after
no had taken our scats was of the moat
friendly even 01 a jocular character
there was no significance in the whole
incident >
