And when will they do It?

protracted the more ns;onlz!n will be

Which will it be, and when"
Ppon the answer, depends the fate of
the Mormon people.
There will be too many, we fenr, who
will not be able to do Christmas shop

But the Council cannot see the de
sirability of the Mill creek water offer
even with a lawsuit thrown in.

bargains In their line, even If they are

TBTE GAMBLING PROBLEM.
The Tribune demands 'hat the rob
bing gambling gamSfl In this city be
losed up. Tt has designated the chief
offenders In this direction, and calls
upon the administrative officials of this
city to do their duty under the law.
They know thee resorts better than
w an show thm. They know the
law They knew thHr sworn duty.
Thy are forsworn If they do not do It.
There must he an end of this damn
able robbery. Laboring men, minors,
Oerks. trusted agents, are beguiled into
gambling dens, are pllt-d with liquor and
arc rrilib.-.l, with not oven the Ptn.ill
chance of the one who coos agtlln8f the
ordinary chancea of a gambling game,
to win it Ls criminal robbery that is
prepetritted upon them. It Isn't a game
of chance that they play, for they have
no chance whatever to win.
Think of the case where a man, so lm
brutcd as to steal and pawn his wife's
wedding ring for about half Its value,
and so Infatuated with the game, so en
thralled In the vice so alluringly held
out to him, that ho resorted in the gam
ing tables, and then think of his rc
morSS and anguish on losing it all! And
think if the horror of the wife on
learning of the depraved act which the
man she has sworn to love, honor and
obey, had committed, when she learned
the awful fact! Who, unmoved with
disgust and wrath, could think of such
a case?
Remember, also, the man who came
here to engage In business, but who was
enticed Into a gambling hell and robbed
of all his ready money, so completely
looted that he had to pawn his ov rcoal
to get the money to take himself and
his wife out of town. And realize, If
you can, the loathing and shame thai
wife must have felt over this terrible,
outcome of what was a fair prospect of
an honored and promising business life,
and a career that promised such
winsome outlook.
Again, note the case of a boy of
eighteen, who was lured into a den, and
rohbeJ of his pitiful savings, accumu
lated through some years of toil and
self-denial. Is It not enough to mak
the blood boll against the miserable
scoundrels who perpetrated this abom
inable outrage?
These arc but a few cases of the great
number of merciless, savage plu kings
that have occurred within a brief time
And backing It Is a hierarchy that con
trols the city absolutely, a negligent set
of accomplices as city officials, and a
police force that knows all the facts and
lifts not a finger to enforco the law or
succor the victims.
THE MILL CREEK OVERSHOT.
It Is a matter for congratulation that
the proposed Mill Creek negotiations
were stopped by the Council on Monday
night. The Mayor's proposed wasteful
and reckless negotiations were bad
enough. In all conscience, when they
dealt with water rights that were valid;
but when it comes to negotiating on the
same prodigal basis for rights that are
In dispute, and that aro actually (.rt liti
gation In court that Is. buying Into a
lawsuit the lnconslderateness of It
was too glaring even for the church's
Council before which It came, and
w hich has hitherto sturdily sustained
whatever was proposed, no matter h"w
Injurious to the city, nor how far It de
parted from the pledges given to the
taxpayers during the bond election cam
paign. This Mill Creek water which It was
proposed to obtain by these cloudy ne
gotiations would be had, If at all. on the
same profligate and cut-throat terms as
those carried In the contracts with the
Big Cottonwood farmers. That Is, for
the two million gallons which are
sought, the city will give two million
flve hundred thousand gallons. It Is a
sheer throwing away of the city's re
sources to deal on those terms. In fact,
the city Is much worse off on Its water
supply right now than It was before it
voted the bonds pr entered Into any ne
gotiations at all on this new deal.
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
It is encouraging to note that the City
Council can be moved by public discus
sion to do the right thing Not long
ago a taxpayer wrote to The Tribune
Inquiring as to the right of the Council
to demand advance payment for local
lmpro enicnt s. and to hold the money
for long periods; also, as to why It re
tained mney collected under promise of
making certain Improvements, after It
had abandoned all- Intention to make
such Improvements.
Mr. Eramel. Assistant t'lty Attorney,
made a fair statement, in reply, show
ing that the Council had made post
ponement of Hrne for payments in post
poned work, but as he was not author
ized to say anything about refunding
money on work paid for but abandoned,
he very properly omitted to mak men
tion of It.
We note, however, that In the Council
Monday evening. Mr Tuddenham in
troduced a resolution dealing compre
hensively with this question, and the
Council promptly passed It. The reso
lution not only suspends payment on
work nnt compute,, hut it directs that
the money already paid on such work
not done, he, refunded to th payers.
This Is the right thln. It covers the
whole c;ise The persons who have paid
Will Ret their money, and they will not
be called upon again to pay on any
work that has not been ordered, bul
nothing will be collected on work that
Is abandoned.
The American victory Is not deold of
power, It appears, to correct some plar
Injr Injustices, oven before Its officials
get Into their offices.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The key-note of the President's mes
sage is National control of gnat cor
porations, it is argued, and the proof
goes with the argument, that the States
are unable to control these vast con
cerns whose business Is In many States;
In some cases. Indeed, the State Is un
abl to reach thoSS Interstate combina
tions In nny effective way. We believe i
that til thought of the leading tin n of
the country, as Wl II SS the SSntimt fll Of
the masses of th people, ls with the
proposition for National control And
still, the conflict would come on the
methods proposed whereby to exercise
that control. And there would be the
difference of opinion. There Is evidently
a long and fierce fiKht to win before the
National regulation can be made effect
ive. This the President sees, and he
asks definite legislation. In order to find
out the limitations, If there are any, to
the programme of effective National su
pervision. The railroad rate question will al
ways be a troublesome one. and caution
In handling It Is enjoined by the Presi
dent. The block signals, public ac
counting, lesser hours, labor problems,
race suicide, are dealt with vigorously.
On the question of life insurance he
probes deeply, and suggests that Fed
eral supervision may be Imperative. And
while calling for reform here, he also
demands reform In public affairs, in the
departments, and In elections.
He exults over the peace settlement,
and tlenounces wars of aggression, but
holds that It would be madneps for the
Nation to disarm, and he urges a strong
navy to enrorce tne iuonroe aoctrine,
and for defense; and the importance of
ceiast defenses Is dwelt upon.
The President urges revision of the
naturalization law?; of the criminal
laws; he calls for the highest type of
citizenship, and for the enforcement of
the civil servh c law.
He gives warm words of commenda
tion to the Irrigation reclamation ser
vice, and favors the encouragement of j
our merchant marine.
The Indian question. National parks.
Alaska, Hawaii. Porto Rico, and the
Philippines come In for special consider- 1
atlon; as to the latter, the President
considers self-government a matter for
the remote future
The Panama canal comes In for de
tailed mention, and the need of further
provision of money to push the work Is
referred to.
The message closes with a review of
the condition of our diplomatic and i
consular service, w hich Is taking on In
creasing Importance, and for which fur
ther and more appropriate consideration '
should be extended by Congress.
It Is a long message, but it ls a very
able and strong one It has many sub
jects to deal with, and It deals with
them pointedly, and with exact knowl
edge, and with a perfect exposition of
President Roosevelt's opinion about j
each, and of what he considers should
be done. It ls such a mesasge as the i
American people delight to read, and WS j
believe that this messace will receive
more general perusal than any Prsl- '
dent's message has received for many
years ,
A MERE WORLDLINESS.
In Victoria, British Columbia, the
street railways and lighting plants are
operated by one company. This Is Its
method of financial operation: After
paying an Interest of four per cent to
the stockholders, the balance of the net
earning of the company Is annually di
vided Into three portions. Two of these
go to the stockholders, and one to em
ployees of more than a year's stand
ing. These employees share and share
ullk?, no matter what their salary or
station In the company. In the first
year of the trial the sum of $25 was the
profit to each man, from superintend
ent to track greaser, and this year tht
profit to each will be $40 the amount
having grown steadily year by year
But the Victoria light and rail"
company is a mere worldly concern,
owned by mere worldly men. operated
merely for lawful gain, for public con-
venlence, and for the benefit of em
ployees How fortunate It Is that this
company is not owned by a prophet of
God, who would operate It for personal
aggrandizement, for public Inconven
ience, and without due consideration
for the Just demands of toll
THE SCHOOL ELECTIONS.
Next Wednesday, In the three school
districts of this county, outside of the
city, there Is to be an important elec
tion. Baoh district will elect tie
truvt.es. aid upon these five officials,
when they are elcted, will deohe the
duty of inaugurating the consolidated
school work heretofore scattered among
a larg'"1 number of small school dis
tricts. The change will be In the same
direction, and of the same order, though
In lesser degree, as the consolidation of
the twenty odd school districts of this
city into one.
The new school trustees should be
men of substance, of standing, and
above all. of knowledge of school work,
and of enthusiasm In it. A great mis
take would he made to elect any person
to be one of these trustees merely be-
ause he or she is popular, or Is sffii It ni
In pome other branch of law or of pnb
lic service. The school work i what Is
to he done by these trustees, and the
persons most competent for that work
are the ones who phciild be . hos.-n to
do It.
No work that nny public, officials
have to do s of higher Importance or of
more lasting effect upon the com
munity than the Work of the school
trustees. They should, therefore, be
men of wisdom In the broadest sense, of
Independence of character, citizens w ho
Will unyieldingly press for th best
things for the pupils, which Is also the
best for the community, for on the edu
cation of lis citizens depends the per
petuity of the Republic. We trust that
the very best selections will bo made at
tho election next Wednesday, and that
the schools of this county w ill thrive as
they should, under the control of trust
ees who are zealous In their office, and
devoted to the cause of education.
A FRAUDULENT PLEA.
That fraudulent "American" sends
another letter to The Tribune, and this
time he appears as A Mother."
Without giving space to his long
communication, there are some points
in which it might add to the gayety
of nations. First, he pretends that he
cannot spell common words, like
"plain" and "clothes" which he calls
"plane close." And yet he talks about
more laurels for the brow of The Tri
bune; discourses learnedly of Jtrome
and his fight on the New York City
pool rooms, and designates two rep
utable business houses in this City as
being dens of Iniquity in gambling and
places for the ruin of tho unwary.
Neither one of them is known as a
gambling hon.se so far as The Tribune
ls aware.
The little diversion which "American"
attempts to create will not retard The
Tribune's work This paper does not
demand the Impossible, nor will It be
led Into any misdirected attack upon
reputable business houses not connected
in any way, so far as we know, or the
police know, with any phase of gam
bling "American" does not want to prevent
the robbery of poor working men by
"skin" games and he adopts as his
method a fraudulent urgency In behalf
of the Improper and the Impossible.
The venom of his opposition to The
Tribune s work against gambling and
thieving, is too apparent to be over
looked; and his offence Is doubled
when he Invokes the sacred name Of
"Mother" to cover his nefarious at
tempt to divert the public attention
from wrong that tan he cured to
wrongs that either do not exist, or are,
for the present, out of reach.
Let us advise the citizens of Salt
Lake that this ls the most cunning
trick that opposition to reform ever
adopts. When the people have their
guna pointed at one evil, If the pro
prietors or friends of that evil can In
trude another evil upon attention,
thereby getting up a vacillation of
purpose In the public mind, they not
only save themselves, but they save
other wrongs from destruction.
On.- difht at a time, and that fight to
a finish.
