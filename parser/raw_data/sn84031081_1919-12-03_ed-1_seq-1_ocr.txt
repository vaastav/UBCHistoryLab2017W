Leonard Wood was indorsed for pres
ident of the Vnited States early to
night I y the repub'Ican state conven
tion after u spirited struggle in which
Gov. Krank O. Lowden of Illinois
came out second bept. While the re
publicans were meeting in one legis
lative chamber of the state capitol,
the democratic state convention in
the opposite chamber Indorsed Presi
dent Wilson for a third term by an
unanimous vote.
Under the Richards, state primary
law the county delegations cast their
vote on the basis of their voting
strength at the last state election and
a majority was necessary to indorse
or nominate. Wood received 28,599
votes from the republican majority
and Ixnvdon got 15.442. The necessary
m.iiority was 25,558.
The republican convention was
turned Into a turbulent session late
today when one faction halted a roll
call on presidential indorsement and
urged that the county delegations
withhold their vote on that question.
After this move was defeated, the sup-.
porters of this plan who were classed
as anti-Wood delegates, swuns their
strength to Lowden.

The republicans then quickly in

did not indorse any one for vice presi

session of congress.
The president asked for new tariff
laws based on the nation s changed
relation to the rest of the world, sug
gested, that the income and excess
profits tax schedules be simplified, ad
vocated steps to improve rural condi
tions and promote production, and de
clared for a "genuine democratization
of industry" to protect both labor and
capital.
The railroad problem he reserved
for a future message and he made no
statement of his intentions regarding
tno peace treaty or Mexico.
Many of his resolutions were the
same as those submitted to the spe
cial session last spring and several of
them are embraced in legislation al
ready being formulated in the two
houses.
To Meet High Living .sih.
To meet the cost of living, the pres
ident asked extension of the war time
food control bill, federal regulation of
cold storage, readjustment of food
transportation and establishment of a
system of federal licensing for all cor
porations engaged in interstate com
merce. He declared the causes of unrest to
be superficial and. temporary and
made his only reference to the sen
ate's failure to ratify the peace treaty
in saying that restlessness was due
largely to the nation's hesitation In de
termining its peace policy. The fed

The J,"n (tu rned that Carlisle had
eaten wii living dinner at the
ranch ol 'riJ,i Hill. From almost
every rancher the potter obtained fur
ther Information. He had dined at the
home of one rancher one day, another
the next. Yesterday morning he was
at Jim Shaw's ranch on Horseshoe
creek. He had dinner and supper at
Frank Day's near Esterbrook park
and was traced to that place this
morning. It was then learned that he
hud left this morning from' the home
' of Krank Newell for the La Bonte
country and the posne lost his trail.
KHeapcs From Widow's Home.
Luter in the morning, the posse
learned by telephone that Carlisle had
gone to Widow Bruy's home, and, it
was from here that Carlisle made his
escape, when almost in the hands of
his pursuers. Just before noon.
The bandjt then doubled back on
his trail to Scott Hamilton's ranch
and from tbere toward Ksterbrook
park.
It was not hard for the posse to
follow the fresh trail to Williams'
home, In the wildest part of the Lara
mie Peak country. Sheriff Roach
and W. J. McClement special agent
of the Union Pacific at Cheyenne, lay
down in the snow at Williams' back
door while the others surrounded the
place. Soon Williams came out. He
informed the posse that Carlisle was
inside and the sheriff entered.
Carlisle ran from the kitchen, in
which he had been sitting, to th-s
front room. He Belzed an automatic
pistol, apparently prepared to give
battle, when the sheriff entered and
fired the shot which ended the
bandit's career for the time being.
Carlisle escaped from the state
prison on Saturday. November 15, in
a box of shirts shipped from the
shirt factory in which he was em
ployed. He was Berving a sentence
of 25 to 60 years for train robbery,
committed in 1918.
Hobs Passengers of $250.
Three davs later he boarded th
Union Pacific libs Angeles limited at
Rock River, robbed passengers in a
tourist car of S250 and escaped near
Medicine Bow.
In making his escape, .It was
learned today Carlisle was wounded
in the right hand. He was unable to
get medical attention while a fugitive
in the hills and the bullet is still in
his hand.
From ranch house to ranch house
through the desolate Laramie Peak
country, Carlisle made his way, never
attempting to conceal his Identity,
rather boasting of it. It was not un
til last Saturday that any of his In
voluntary hosts notified officers of
the bandit's 'Whereabout. The of

In an extended discussion of labor
conditions, he declared the workers

said tonight that Carlisle's wound is
not necessarily fatal. He will be kept
under guard in the local hospital for
several days and then' be taken back
to the state prison at Rawlins.
The Union Pacific Railroad com
pany spent several thousand dol
lars in attempting to capture
Carlisle. A special train was
sent to the scene of the rob
bery on November 18 and posses
were kept in the field for several
days, large sums were spent In try
ing to trace the source of letters and
telegrams sent to the railroad, and to
newspapers, purporting to come from
Carlisle. It now develops that all of
these were fakes and that Carlisle has
been In isolated parts of the state
ever since his escape from the train
robbery.
Given First Aid Treatment.
Carlisle was given first aid treat
ment by the sheriff and McClement
in the Williams cabin and then tied
on the pack horse for the descent
to the road far below the snow-covered
mountain where a high-powered
automobile had been kept in waiting.
lis was nrought to Douglas at 4:45
o'clock this afternoon. I
The authorities are not overlooking
any cnam.-e that the troJn robber
will attempt to make his escape from
the hospital,, even though badlv
wounded. A heavy guard has been
placed at his bedside and this will be
maintained until he is safely back be
hind prison walls at Rawlins.
Since the train robbery, the Union
Pacific has been maintaining arrned
guards on all passenger trafns
through the state, fearing Carlisle
would attempt another robbery. In
1916, the bandit perpetrated at least
three train robberies before his cap
ture. ,"I don't blame you for shooting"
Carlisle told the sheriff after he had
been placed under the care of a doc
tor In the hospital. The bandit re
fused to say anything further.

the making of all appropriations and
that appropriations should lie made,
rot independently of ettcii other, but
with reference to one single compre

related to the nation's Income, there
can be no doubt. 1 believe the burden
of preparing the budget must, in the
nature of the case, if the work Is to
be properly done and responsibility
concentrated Instead of divided, rest
upon the executive. The budget so
prepared should be submitted to and
approved or umended by a single
committee of each house of congress,
and no single appropriation should
be made by the congress, except such

He also told the Jury that a trans

into to protect the company In case
its license to sell stock were taken

retary of the treasury.
Prol lem of Taxation.
"I trust that the congress will give
Its Immediate consideration to the
problom of future taxation. Simplifi
cation of the income and profits taxes
has become an Immediate necessity.
These taxes performed indispensable
service during the war. They must,
however, be simplified, not only to
save the taxpayer Inconvenience and
expense, but In order that his liability
may be mode certain and definite.
"With reference to th details of
the revenue law, the secretary of the
treasury and the commissioner of in
ternal revenue will lay before you for
your consideration certain amend
ments necessary or desirable In con
nection with the administration of the
law recommendations which have
my approval and support. R is of the
utmost importance that in dealing
with this matter the present law
should not be disturbed, so far as re
gards taxes for the calendar year
1 920, payable In tho calendar year
1921. The congress might well con
sider whether the higher rates of In
come and profits taxes can in peace
times be effectively productive of rev

the contrary, he destructive of busi
ness activity and productive of waste
and Inefficiency. There is a point at
which In peace times high rates of
Income and profits taxes discourage
energy, remove the incentive to new
enterprise, encourage extravagant ex
penditures and produces industrial
stagnation with consequent unemploy
ment and other attendant evils. .
Not Kusy Problem.
"Tho problem is not an easy one.
A fundamental change has taken
place with reference to the position
of America In the world's affairs. Thel
prejudice and passions engendered by
decades of controversy between two
schools of political and economic
thought the one believers In protec
tion pf American industries the other
believers in tariff for revenue only
must be subordinated to the single
consideration of the public Interest in
the light of utterly changed condi
tions. Before the war America was
heavily the debtor of the rest of the
world and the interest payments she
had to make to foreign countries on
American securities held abroad, the
expenditures of American travelers
abroad, and the ocean freight charges
she had to pay to others, about bal
anced the value of her pre-war fa
vorable balance of trade. During the
war America's exports have been
greatly stimulated, and Increased
prices have Increased their, value. On
the other hand she has purchased a
large proportion of the American se
curities previously held abroad, has
loaned some $9,000,000,000 to foreign
governments, and has built her own
ships. Our favorable balance of trade
has thus been greatly increased and
Europe has been deprived of the
means of meeting it heretofore exist
ing. Europe can have only three
ways of meeting the favorable balance
of trade in peace times: by Imports
Into this country of gold or of goods,
or by establishing new credits.
Europe's Gold.
"Europe Is In no position at the pres
ent time to shin gold to us nor could
we contemplate large further Imports
of gold Into this country without con
cern. The time has nearly pnssod
for Interns tional governmental loans,
and it will take time to develop In
this country a market for foreign se
curities Anythtne. therefore, which
nvt.ve of consideratfon for this or!,w"rt o.t very great' field, by creating
new opportunities lor mniVHiuiil en
terprise. The secretary of the interior
has pointed out the way by which re
turning soldiers may be he'ped tn find
and take up land in the hitherto un
developed regions of the country
which the federal government has al
ready prepared or can readily prepare
for cultivation, and also on manv of
the cutover or neglected areas which
lie within the limits of the older
states; and I once moro take the lib
erty of recommending very urgently
that his plans shall receive the imme-
fliate and substantial support of the
congress."
Tarirr Legislation.
"In the matter of tariff legislation,
t beg to call your attention to the
statements contained In my last mes
sage urging legislation with reference
to the establishment of the chemical
and dyestuffs Industry In America:
Among the Industries to which
special consideration should bo given
Is that of the manufacture of dye
stuffs and related chemicals. Our
complete dependence upon German
supplies before the war made the In
terruption of trado a cause of excep
tional economic disturbance. The
close relations between the manufac
ture of dyestuffs, on the one hand,
and of explosives and poisonous gases
on the other, moreover has given the
Industry an exceptional significance
and value.
" 'Athough the United States will
gladly and unhesitatingly join In the
program of International disarma
ment, it will never the less he a .policy
of obvious prudence to make certain
of the successful maintenance of
many strong and well equipped chem
ical plants. Tho Ocrman chemical in
dustry, with which we will be brought
Into competition, was and may well
be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly
capable of exercising a competition of
a peculiarly Insidious and dangerous
kind.'
Must Increase Production.
"During the war the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. Hy materially increasing
the production of his lund, he sup
plied America and the allies with the
increased amounts of food necessary
to keep their immense armies In the
field. Ho Indispensably helped to win
the war. But there is now scarcely
less need of increasing the production
In food and the necessaries of life. I
ask the congress to consider means of
encouraging effort along these lines.

In the coal strike situation, though

communities to make effective coal

Sn far as reiTorts were available
production in the bituminous fields
dropped yesterday and today to a lit

Operators and others watching re
sults were told that the government

In carrying out Dr. Garfield's pro
gram for the maximum use of local
discretion in rationing coal to meet
emergencies and constant'y changing
conditions the St. Louis regional coal
committee ordered late opening and
early closing for retail stores. In New

In congress the situation was given
