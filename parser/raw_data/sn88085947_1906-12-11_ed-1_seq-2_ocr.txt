IS THERE TO BE A DICTATOR?
Tlie president's views era the Japanese question, as ex
pressed in his message to congress, are, to say the least,
startling. Entirely dismissing the possibility that those
,who are most familiar with the little brown niton of the
Orient may be best fitted to judge of his characteristics,
Mr. Roosevelt proceeds to flay the California authorities
for enforcing their state laws in regard to Oriental
schools.
He accuses the people of the Pacific Coast of thought
lessly, and through blind prejudice, attempting to embroil
tlie United States in a war. Tn his eulogy of the Japanese
and condemnation of the Californians he neglects to touch
upon the facts, vouched for hy official reports, of condi
tions in the Hawaiian Islands, where the American is be
ing practically forced out of business and politics by these
very good friends from Japan.
There is no mention made of the fact that ex-officers
of the Japanese army are arriving in Honolulu hy every
boat.
The evidences of a hostile spirit on the part of the
subjects of the mikado are too familiar to the general
public to require repetition. Mr. Roosevelt cites the re
markable rise of the Japanese within the last century, and
comments upon there unswerving loyalty to the mikado
and Xippon.
la the event of trouble with them it would appear that
'while this patriotism of theirs is a very nice thing in the
abstract, it is just what wo have to fear in the concrete.
Allowing that the Japanese be naturalized it will
necessarily follow that lie will be permitted to serve in
the army and navy.
With several thousand trained Japanese fighters in
his. own forces, what chance would Caucasian Uncle Sam
stand in case of war! And war will undoubtedly come
sooner or later unless the American people are willing to
resign their possessions without a struggle.
Aside from the question of naturalizing the Japanese,
which appears to he a sop to appease their wrath, the
president asks congress to do an unheard of thing—that
is, to give the president the right to enforce the executive
opinion in sovereign states by the use of the Federal army
and navy.
It is true that the army and navy were used in the
Civil War, but they were not used until the Southern
states had openly eeeeded from the Union and declared
themselves beyond the pale of the Constitution.
With the power to overturn state Jaws by the use of
the United States soldiery, what safeguard would we
have against the rising of a second Napoleon Bonaparte?
What is the condition of affairs in countries where the
army is supreme?
Mexico has a dictator. Do we need one, too?

EDITOR TURNS SLEUTH TO
RESCUE KIDNAPED ROY
CM AH A, Neb., Dec. 11—Enticed
from his home at Grand Island.
Neb., to York, Neb., then kidnaped
and taken to a life of drudgery in
a Baltimore, ftfd., sweatshop and
finally rescued after a hard fight
in court, 12-year-old Floyd Brunei - ,
son of widowed Mrs. eLon Bruner,
been restored to his mother's arms.
That the boy was fcund after his
abduction Is due solely to Elmer E.
Brown, o£ Harvard, Neb., editor of
the Omaha Observer, who through
sheer sympathy for the boy and his
moiher trailed the abductor across
half a continent and won his fight
for the possession of the boy in
Baltimore.
Lazel Wlnakur, a Polish Jew,
who with his brothers operates a
sweats/hop at 107 North Front St.,
Baltimore, is under arrest in that
city and will be brought to trial
on a charge of ki.inaping young

city, with a prospect of ease and
money and a bright, future, Winau-
Uer is alleged to have enticed little
Floyd Bruner from his home at the

The Daily Short Story
MISS RUTH.
I suspect that if mother and sis
ter Margaret, had not gone to Can
ada and left Ruth and me at Larch
mont I might have have been as
happy as I am.
Father and Aleck came home
about. 10 days after the departture
of the rest of the family, and al
though Aleck was 15 years older
than I, he seemed to like me very
much.
We went rowing every day, he,
Ruth and 1, and part of each day
we spent on a little island, where
we rested under the pine trees and
listened to the murmuring of the
river.
But Aleck soon seemed to tire of
me. It wounded me cruelly at
first: but I soon decided that he
was a very good stepbrother, and
if he liked Ruth I was happy in
their love, for Ruth was as dear as
a sister to me. She had been a
sort of governess and companion
to me for years, and Margaret's
hateful treatment of the girl only
made her that much closer to me.
At first Ruth felt bound to refuse
Aleck's attentions because she was
so much poorer than he, and be
sides she had fancied she was
boundto him because he had been
very kind when she was in need of
true friendship. This Harry Lee
came to see her occasionally, and
when Ruth was engaged he spent
the time with me. I confess I liked
him a great deal. I found that
Ruth did not really love him and
that she liked Aleck very much.
When Margaret returned home
and found that Aleck wanted to
marry Ruth she proceeded to
make things as unpleasant as pos
sible for my friend. Aleck was
finally forced, to leave home with
out knowing whether Ruth loved
him or not.
One day, as Harry came up the
walk, I intercepted him and frankly
asked if he loved Ruth. He was
embarassed by my question at first
hut seeing that I was not actuated
by idle curiosity he admitted that
he had ceased to believe himself
to Ruth and that he had found an
other whom he loved deeper than

cago, but could r.btain no traice of
the boy. Finally, at. Lincoln, he
learned that Floyd had eaten at
one of the hotels in company with
a man who registered as Lazel
Wlnakur.
From Winakur's merchantile cus
tomers, Brown learned that the
man's place of business was in
Baltimore, c wired the police there
to resuce the boy.
In the meantime Winakur re«
turned to Baltimore and began a
fight for the possession of the hoy.
He enlisted the aid of a Jewish
society for the "protection of chili
dren," and secured the custody of
the boy through the juvenile court.
When Elmer Brown reached Bal
timore he secured a special session
of court Sunday morning, but learn
ing that he must travel tbe red tape
line of long litigation, he then de
termined to do a little kidnaping
himself, if necessary
Brown called at the home where
the society harbored its wards and
told the officers of the institution
that he would leave with the boy
if he had to lick the whole insti
tution. They evidently throught
Brown meant what he said, and the

he had' ever believed it. possible to
love.
This relieved my mind so much
that I wrote to Aleck and told him
that I knew Ruth would be his
wife if he would only ask her. This
encouraged him so that, he came
home the following week and made
Ruth promise to be his, no matter
what the family thought of it.
Realizing that I had done the
'best I could, and now that I was
to be left, I grew very lonely. But
Harry came more frequently than
ever, and only a week before the
day set for Ruth's wedding he ask
ed me if I could ever be afole to
care for him.
I had not thought of it in this
way bebfore, but since he told me
that it was I he loved all the time
instead of Ruth I was happy .in
deed, and much to the dismay of
the family we announced that W0
would be married two weeks after
Aleck and Ruth.
The dear girl says to this day
that I denrve my happiness be

and fell in love with my- step
brother. And I am glad, for they
are as happy as Harry and I, and
that is a wonderful degree.
Margaret, with her disagreeable
disposition, has net yet married.
