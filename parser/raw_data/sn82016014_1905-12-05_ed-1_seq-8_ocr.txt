h - Herald: Reuben Vincent, form
?rh- a member of the state board of
p ' '.ies and a prominent citizen of
Washington county; A. L. Sellg, one of
the leading citizens of Lawrence; S. M.
Fox, who was adjutant .general under
the Stanley administration, and C, V.
Norman, formerly county superintend
ent of Doniphan county and prominent
in the state's educational circles. It is
unusual that a body of men of such
standing is brought together to dis
pense justice.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
It is extremely refreshing to read a
public document like the president's
message to congress, which is pub
lished in the State Journal today.
While it is lengthy, there is no useless
verbiage about it. Theodore Roose
velt knows how to write. He expresses
himself in clear, forcible language
that leaves no doubt as to what he is
trying to say.
But the sentiments of the president's
message are the vital part of it. It Is
a message of the Square Deal. In
every paragraph justice and square
dealing between man and man are
pieached. While it is addressed to
congress, some portions of it, the dis
cussion of the labor problem for ex
ample, seem directed to the American
people.
Without wasting any words in
platitudes the president begins a dis
cussion of the general welfare of the
country, leading quickly up to the
regulation and control of corporations
and trusts by the government He
shows the weakness of the present
laws, in that corporations are created
by states and that they are permitted
to go forth into other states without
any adequate control.
President Roosevelt sets forth a new
idea concerning trusts in his message.
He protests against laws absolutely
prohibiting combinations which re
strict competition, saying that they are
impossible of absolute enforcement,
but that instead the government
should control and direct such combi
nations, eliminating the evils and di
recting the benefits for the common
good.
One of the evils which the president
specifically points out is overcapitaliza
tion watered stock. This, he says, is
the chief but not the only evil of big
combinations of capital. It is generally
the result of dishonest promotion,
says the president, and it brings
myriad evils in its train. It produces
an inflation that invites business panic
and conceals the true relation of the
profit earned to the capital actually
invested. It creates a burden of in
terest payments that improperly re
duces wages. It damages the small in
vestor, discourages thrift, encourages
gambling and speculation, and en
courages triekiness and dishonesty.
This leads directly up to the regula
tion of the railroads. President Roose
velt cautions congress against hasty or
radical action, but he insists that rail
road rates must be regulated by the
government, anil he reiterates the gen
eral plan that he has laid down in his
speeches conferring the rate regulat
ing power upon an administrative body.
The president does not attempt to say
what the administrative body shall be
the present Inlcrstate Commerce com
mission, or a reorganized commission
but he insists that it shall be a purely
administrative body.
In addition to giving the commission
the power to make a maximum rate
when the rate established by the rail
road company is complained of and
found to be unjust, the president goes
considerably farther. He says that in
some instances favored shippers are
given rates that ate too low, and in
such instances the commission should
establish that as the maximum. "It
would need only one or two such decis
ions to cure railroad companies of the
practice of giving improper minimum
rates," says the president. Unless this
power to establish maximum rates is
given a commission there is no use of
touching the subject at all, he says.
He takes up the question of indirect
rebates, including the scheme of which
the St. Paul is just now accused giving
a favored shipper advance information
concerning a low rate to be made and
allowing him to prepare to take advan
tage of it, to the disadvantage of his
competitors. This, he says, as well as
private car lines and termlnals.fictitious
damages, and all other forms of indirect
rebates should be severely dealt with.
The president discusses the railroad
issue at length, insisting that he is not
hostile to the railroads, but only wishes
to curb dishonest men who would prey
on the public, and who also force those
railroad officials who are honest to meet
their dishonest practices.
Another problem that the president
discusses at length is the relations of
labor and capital. He recognizes the
benefits of labor unions the same as he
does combinations of capital, but he in
sists that the powet of the unions must
not be wrongfully used. He takes the
same view 01 tne laoor proDiem as was
set forth in the State Journal a few
weeks ago that labor ancl capital must
work together as partners and not as
enemies.
"Each man," says the president, "if
he be really a good citizen, must show
broad sympathy for his neighbor and
genuine desire to look at any question
arising between them from the stand
point of that neighbor no less than
from his own; and to this end it is es
sential that capitalist and wage-worker
should consult freely one with the other,
should each strive to bring closer the
day when both shall realize that they
are properly partnei and not enemies.
To approach the questions that inevit
ably rise between them solely from the
standpoint which treats each side in the
mass as the enemy of the other side in
the mass is both wicked and foolish."
The president protests most emphat
ically against the fostering of class
spirit, saying that it must result in the
death of the republic if carried out; but
that every man should stand on his in
dividual merits.
The recent insurance exposures are
recognized by the president and he rec
ommends that congress shall consider
the question of federal regulation of in
surance companies, along with other
corporations.
The tariff is touched on only indirect
ly in a discussion of the government
revenues. The president calls attention
to the deficit in the treasury the past
year and suggests that if, in the course
of time, It becomes apparent that not
enough revenues are collected to run
the government, a readjustment of the
revenue laws will become necessary.
This is the only reference that is made
to the tariff.
At the same time the president speaks
of economies that have been introduced
into the public service, and insists on
lopping off all unnecessary expendi
tures, at the same time being generous
with those things that are necessary.
He deals briefly with the money ques
tion calling attention & the need of a
currency that shall be elastic enough to
expand with commercial demands with
out being inflated when unusual de
mands are over.
One of the subjects in which there is
great interest is that of campaign con
tributions, which the president speaks
of under the subject of federal elections.
He reiterates his former recommenda
tion that campaign committees and
candidates be required to make public
both the contributions that they receive
and their expenditures. He says that
campaign contributions must necessar
ily be made, but that they should be
given with a legitimate object in view,
arid should be legitimately expended.
"This," says the president, "means
that many contributions, and some of
them of large size, must be made, and,
as a matter of fact, in any big political
contest such contributions are always
made to both sides. It is entirely pro
per both to give and receive them, un
less there is an improper motive con
nected with either gift or reception. If
they are extorted by any kind of pres
sure or promise, express or implied, di
rect or indirect, in the way of favor or
immunity, then the giving or receiving
becomes not only improper but crimi
nal." This means that corporations ought
not to make contributions which the
president emphasizes as follows: "All
contributions by corporations to any
political committee or for any political
purpose should be forbidden by law;
directors should not be permitted to use
stockholders' money for such purposes:
and, moreover, a prohibition of this
kind would be, as far as it went, an
effective method of stopping the evils
aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not
only should both the national and the
several state legislatures forbid any of
licer of a corporation from using the
money of the corporation in or about
any election, but they should also for
bid such use of money in connection
with any legislation save by the em
ployment of counsel in public manner
for distinctly legal services."
Considerable space is given by the
president to a discussion of the sub
ject of peace and The Hague confer
ence, and the Monroe doctrine, which
leads up to our relations with Santo
Domingo and the question of maintain
ing our army and navy. The president
does not recommend that the navy be
enlarged, but he says several old war
ships ought to be replaced with mod
ern ones.
Naturalization, the public lands, im
migration, civil service, our insular pos
sessions and numerous minor subjects
are touched on.. Near the close of the
message single statehood for Oklahoma
and Indian Territory are recommended
and also for New Mexico and Arizona.
ine president also deals with the
Panama canal at the close of the moo-
sago, telling what has thus far been
accomplished, the problems still to be
solved, and urging congress to make
provisions to carry on the work, as
expeditiously as possible.
MR. BOXES APPOINTMENT.
The nomination of Harry J. Bone
of Ashland, for United States district
attorney for Kansas will meet with
approval from a vast number of
Kansas people, in spite of the fact
that he displaces a good oAicial. So
far as the State Journal knows,
nothing can bo said against J. s.
Dean, the retiring district attorney',
and Mr. Bone's extreme popularity
and the fact that Senator Long feels
indebted to him for his unswerving
loyalty in the past are doubtless the
influences that have landed him in
the coveted office.
Probably few men could secure a
better line of personal endorsements
in Kansas than Mr. Bone. He has an
extremely wide acquaintance, and
with all factions he is popular. His
ability is unquestioned, and he will
take into the office of district attorney
the experience of four years as assist
ant in the office, during which time he
handled much of the grand jury work
and aided in the prosecution of cases,
as well as the detail work of the office.
Years ago Mr. Bone took out a
working card in the Republican or
ganization of the Seventh district, and
he has always kept up his dues. He
attracted attention during his first
term in the legislature, ten years ago,
and has been advancing steadily ever
since, mr. lione nas not neglected his
law business for politics, hof.vever, and
his practice brings him an income of
several thousand dollars a year.
J. S. Dean, who retires from the
office after a service of four years,
has, so far as the State Journal
is informed, made a creditable record.
The only thing that might be urged
against him is that he was an ap
pointee of J. R, Burton, but it can
be said in extenuation of this fact
that he was not Burton's first choice,
and Mr. Dean long ago lived down any
stigma attaching to him because of
the fact that Burton first nominated
him. Mr. Dean will retire from the
office with the respect of his state and
with the knowledge that it was
through no neglect or malfeasance of
duty that he failed to land a second
term.

THE INEVITABLE.
Senator Burton's fate is pathetic and
is regretted by all familiar with his tal
ents and the future that was possible
for him in public life. But it is the
natural and only ending of a career
shaped as Burton shaped his. His con
ception of public office was that it was
a means for private gain and he pur
sued it along that line, without regard
to methods. Honor, fidelity, integrity,
a regard for his constituents and the
distinguished body of which he was a
member had no place in his considera
tion. All he wanted was money and
his punishment was swift and certain.
Few men can go to the United states
senate, but going to jail is largely a
matter of choice. Burton won the dis
tinguishing honor of a place in the sen
ate, but he chose to go to jail, and 1i!
honor and disgrace are his. Miami Re

There may be a world of pathos, and
even of rebuke, in a very few words, and
so the rather thoughtless wife of a con
tributor of ours discovered recently. She
has two sweet little children, both girls,
and, almost without knowing it, she
made a pet favorite of the younger

ed her, had every care and attention

neglect was more or less the portion of
the elder.
The mother was sitting in her bed
room, quietly reading, recently, when
the soft patter of tiny feet sounded on
the stairs.
"Is that you. Sweet?" she called.
"No, mamma," was the sad reply; "it
isn't Sweet it s only me!"

"The leaves of this plant were curious,"

a strange thing happened. The neigh

pressed it firmly into the mucilage. Life

(By La Touche Hancock.)
Dick Fremont was in an unroman
tic state of mind. A little Cupid,
which was holding a finger to its lips,
and gazing at him from the top of an
inkstand on a table by his side, seemed
to warn him that he had been physic
ally exhausting himself lately. He had
been working too hard. At present he
had pains all over his body. His tongue
was distinctly discolored, and his
pulse was weak. His head was throb
bing, and there was scarcely a portion
of his body which did not ache. Loss
of time meant loss of money to him,
for he wrote for a living. If he did not
work he was perfectly aware that some
one else would get ahead of him. Not
that he had easily given up, but the
task of putting words together had
proved, in his present condition, as
hard as carving blocks of stone.
In his extremity he thought of a
doctor. Of all medical men he had a
horror. At the moment, however, there
seemed to be no excuse for not con
quering his aversion, so he dispatched
a bell-boy with orders to bring the
nearest medical practitioner in a
hurry.
He had made a heroic effort to fore
stall any aid from such a source. On
the table near by were bottles of all
sizes and shapes, containing nearly
every advertised patent medicine
which he thought suited to his peculiar
complaint. He had partaken of them
all with much the same result, as if ha
had drunk a "hazing" concoction. At
last he had given up all hope of suc
cessful self-treatment and resigned
himself to a dubltatlve trial of "kill or
cure" at the hands of a doctor.
The little Cupid attracted his eyes
to a photograph lying close at his
hand. He took it up, looked at it earn
estly, and meditated. Just as he was
about to press it to his lips a knock
came at the door. He said wearily,
"Come in!" and a woman's voice re
sponded :
"Pardon me, but are you the gentle
man who sent for a doctor? The boy
who called me said you lived on the
third floor, but I did not quite catch
the name he mentioned."
The tones of the voice seemed famil
iar to Dick. He hastily hid the photo
graph he had in his hand behind the
pillow on his chair, and looked up at
his visitor.
"Why, May Miss Montgomery
you ?"
With a blush the woman he
dressed turned, as if to j,-o away.
"It must have been a mistake,"
began, when he interrupted her.
"No! No! Please come in!"
ad
she She hesitated, and then closing the
door looked at him.
There was a pause, and neither
spoke. Then Dick said in a half whis
per, "Are yon a a doctor?"
"I am." she replied with a smile,
"but I don't think you meant to send
for me.
"Well " he hesitated "I'm glad to
see any doctor.
"Thank you!"
She almost laughed at the doubtful
compliment.
"No! I elon't mean that. I I really
had no idea of seeing you. I told the
bellboy to go for the nearest doctor,
and I never thought"
"To see me? No, I suppose not. You
didn't know I had taken my decree. Of
course not. I don't suppose my af
fairs interested you after "
"After our eiuarrel ? Oh. yes, they
did. I assure you "
She stopped him with a glance.
"You do look sick," said she, "real
ly sick, and " advancing to the table
"what on earth hu.ve you been dos
ing yourself with?"
"A little medicine."
"A little medicine? A litle poison!"
she exclaimed with a laugh, as she
took up the several bottles, one after
the other, and examined them.
"Toothache drops! Paragoric!
Dear me! You must have a compli
cation ot ailments!
"I suppose I have," he wearily as
sented. "I've tried them all, and I'm
not a bit better!"
She burst out laughing. Then she
came a little nearer to him, and said,
hesitating, "Let me feel your pulse."
He put his hand in hers. His pulse
was beating at fever heat. She count
ed mentall" then touching htm on the
shoulder gently pressed his body for
ward, and placed her ear to his back.
As she did so, the pillow fell down, re
leasing the hidden picture. She start
ed, as she saw her own photograph.
Then with a quiet smile, she said, "Are
you in pain?"
"Awful!" he replied, pressing his
heart.
She winced, and turned toward the
mantelpiece. There, storing her in the
face, was another photograph of her
self. She turned and looked at him.
"Why!" she exclaimed, "I really be
lieve you still "
"Yes!" he replied, looking straight
into her eyes, "I do still care for you.
Won't you forgive me for my share in
that silly quarrel we had two years
ago ? I "
She made 110 reply, as he hesitated
"Ah! say 'yes,' " and he tried to rise,
but sank back with an expression of
pain.
"Don't get up." she said gently.
"You are too sick!"
"Can't you help me?"
She smiled. "I think I can."
She took out her prescription book
and wrote on a leaf.
"Here is a prescription, which "
"Oh! bless the medicine! I don't
want that. If you only "
"Will you take it? See what it is!"
"Oh! I can't read doctor's hiero
glyphics I mean. I don't understand
Latin."
She handed him the slip of paper.
He took it, and carelessly scannen what
she had written, w-hich was merely her
name "May Montgomery!"
"Will I take it?" he almost shouted.
"Will you give it to me?"
She nodded her head.
The cure was complete. (Copy

QUAKER REFLECTIONS.
From the Philadelphia Record.
It seems easier to write a life In
surance policy than to right it.
The fellow who marries for money
deserves all that's coming to him.
All the average woman flemands of
a man is that he be a good listener.
The man who puts his trust in
riches wouldn't hesitate to put his
riches in Trusts.
Never ask a truthful man for his
honest opinion unless you are pre
pared for a shock.

"Your Henry s fractured, mother dear.
Upon the gridiron sporty;
His feet betwixt the goal posts near.
At fourteen yards he left an ear,
A collar bone at forty.
"A doctor now, with loving care.
His cartilage is tacking;
They say lie will not miss his hair
And nearly all his ribs aro there.
Though several bones are lacking. '
"He holds his thorax with a groan
And says it hurts a little;
His coaches say, in awe-struck tone.
They'd not have done it had thev known
That Henry was so brittle.
"They say that Henry didn't lack
The talent and the training;
At half he was a crackerjaek "
(You couldn't make a auamback
Of what there is remaining).
"Alas! he. had the proper stuff.
Though rather tall anad slender;
And though his fate is somewhat rough
"i'is not because the game's too tough,
But Henry is too tender."

GLOBE SIGHTS.
From the Atchison Globe.
Y'outh is dangerous because it thinks
it knows everything it guesses at.
A good many social debts seem to b
settled by paying 50 cents on the dollar.
Vivid imaginations can make things
about as disagreeable as anything in this
world.
Did vou ever read anything about Job
having a wife who insisted upon family
reunions?
If there is anything missing these days
it is pretty apt to turn up chopped in the
mincemeat.

The trouble with most of us is that we
do not take enough time in making a $10

The injustice at this season Is that all
the window displays are of articles that
will please only the women and children.
Love is so blind that an Atchison girl
will give her bald-headed sweetheart a
pair of military hair brushes for Christ
mas. If a man has a diamond scarf pin there
isn't anything for his wife to buy him for
Christmas but a pair of cotton socks.
Perhaps the reason a man is allowed
only one bureau drawer is that it limits
him to only one place where he is not
able to find things.

Fashion spare nothing In demanding a
change: The pie that used to be aa thick
as a feather bed. Is now as thin as a
boarding house blanket.
About all the compliments Mother gets
is when some one asks for a second piec
of pie, or some one says her daughter has
beautiful hair.
The average man gets so tired of seeing
his prospective son-in-law hanging
around that he is willing to give his
daughter a bonus in the shape of wedding
clothes if she will rid the house of him.
