Charleston, S. C Dec. '-The South Car
olina, and West Indian Exposition wis for
mally opened to the world to-day with
words of greeting from the President of the
United States The invocation was deliv
ered by the -venerable Charles 9. Vedder of
the Huguenot church and Captain F. W.
Wagcner, president of the exposition com-
pany, and Governor M. B. McSweeney
spoke words of welcome.
Thousands of visitors w ere present at the
opening.
Chauncey M. Depew, United States Sen-
ator from. New York, orator of the day,
was then Introduced by Major Smith.
Mr. Depcw said In part:
"This exhibition Is the triumph of revolu
tion and evolution. There ha- been no pe
riod since the Colony of South Carolina
adopted the theoretical but Impracticable
charter prepared by the great phUoopher,
John Locke, In 1674. down to the treaty of
Paris with Spain, in 1899, when this happily
conceived enterprise was possible until now.
It Is an cmen of future development and
prosperity for Charleston that the moment
Ita citizens saw the time had come they en
tered upon this beneficent work with pa
triotism, courage and confidence.
'It required nearly a century and a half
of struggle and preparation before there
rrlated an Industrial and manufacturing
South In the United States, and Spanish
islands In the Caribbean Sea free and inde
pendent to meet upon the common ground
of united welfare and reciprocal benefits.
-Jtaectrlclty and steam, the instantaneous

In transportation have made one market for
all the world. Reduction of cost and superi
ority of workmanship are the factors of
modern competition. Building the cotton
mOl beside the cotton fields and the furnace
and atael factories by the ore and coal are
redartrlDoting industrial centers. Upon these
linos; and by the application of these princi
ples, the South, from no place In 1S66. has
come to the front In the production of Iron
and coal, and while New England and tho
Western States have practically reached the
profitable limit and are standing still in the
expansion of the manufacture of cotton
goods, there has been the phenomenal In
crease of 1.307,000 spindles during the year
100 In the Carollnas and their neighboring
commonwealths. Capital and enterprise.
which are utilizing wood for Us varied pur
posesindustrial, domestic and commercial
are converting the vast pine forests of
this rich territory Into settlements of thrift,
productiveness and happiness.
"Except for the broader conception In Its
creation, this exhibition would worthily jus
tify its existence as a celebration of the
most wonderful contribution to the most re
markable of centuries. Surely nothing In
the story of the rise, decay and resurrec
tion of nations equals the development and
progress In the last third of the Nineteenth
Century of the States which are bounded by
the Ohio and Potomac rivers on the north,
the Gulf of Mexico on the south, the Mis
sissippi on the west and the Atlantic Ocean
n the east.
"But this fair is more than a memorial
of the glories of the era which recently
closed so brilliantly. It confidently and
hopefully enters the Twentieth Century with
the high and patriotic mission of promoting
closer and mutually beneficent relations
with neighboring countries and communi
ties. The teachuigs of this industrial exhi
bition, carried by visitors from the West
India Islands and the South American
States to their homes, will enforce the les
sons of reciprocity, and open here and there
new and growing markets."
At the conclusion of the Senator's oration.
Mr. Wagener stepped to the wire connecting-
the Auditorium with the Executive
Mansion in Washington and sent greeting
to President Roosevelt. A few minutes
later the response of the President was re
ceived and the exposition was formally
declared open. A number of State days
have been arranged, the first on the list
being Utah. December 4 is the day as
signed. Object of the Exposition.
The principal object of the exposition Is
to make a fully representative display of
the manufacturing progress and commercial
possibilities of the country, and particularly
of the Southern States. A commercial
problem at this time confronts the South,
and perhaps the supreme purpose of the
fair is to solve It. The great advance In
the number of cotton mills constructed and
the output of finished products has created
a surplus or cotton goods. Of this product.
China was at one time the largest con
fUtner outside of the home markets. The
recent disturbance In that country, how
ever, has virtually paralyzed the markets
and the home surplus multiplies. The prln-

OHORGH COLLECTIONS
SH6W BIO INCREASE.
Hospital Association Fund May
Reach $2,",000 This Year
Count Not Completed.
Church collections for the Hospital Sat
urday and Sunday Association, which were
made In all of the St. Louis houses of wor
ship Sunday, show a big increase over last
j ear's contributions. The total amount ob
tained has not been ascertained as yet, but
several of the churches that reported yes
terday materially increased their gifts of
the j car before.
Full returns have not been received from
other sources, but the officers of the asso
ciation are satisfied that the collections will
nearly reach t23.O0O. which is a large In
crease over last year, when only $18,812 was
secured. This year the collections in the
office buildings were noticeably larger than
they have previouslv been, and there were
liberal donations from the trades and other
sources.
When some of the ladies were offering the
badges in one of the prominent office build
ings Saturday an old man. illy clad and
stricken with a maiadv that nude a cripple
of him, approached one of them to make a
purchase. He produced his mite In very
small change and It looked as if it might be
all that he had. but there was a smile on
hU face when he cave it and he seemed
very proud of the tag that was handed Mm
as a receipt for his gift.
"I have just spent eight months in one of
the Institutions that Is supported bj this
fund." said he. "and I know that the little
help that I am able to give will go to a good
purpose. I would have been dead If It had
not been for the care that was given me and
I could not have had the attention if some
one had not made It possible by giving help
to the hospital."
Quite a sum for the Hospital Fund was
raised by a 'prominent oung lady in a well
known cafe Saturday evening when the
campaign for donations was under way.
There was .1 large bouquet of carnations oi
the table, and some one suggested that she
auction the flowers, which she did. The
bidding was spirited, .ind .ifier a very ex
citing conlrst. which attracted the rivalry
of all the gentlemen in the room, the bou
quet was knocked down to one, who paid
$J0 for the prize. As the others wero d's
H r pointed because the) did not get the
flowers, the bouquet was returned to the
young lady by the purcht'er and resold by
the bud. In all. the hospital fund netted
VS from the sale. .

BILL
INTRODUCED BY LITTLEFIELD.
PRIVATE FURS SEIZED
FOR CUSTOMS DUES.
Mr. J. R. Lewis, the Consignee,
8a ts Purchase Price Included
the Duty.
Sealskin furs, the property of J. R.
Lewis, a local stock broker, of Xo. 4f14
Washington avenue, were seized last Friday
afternoon bj Wllburn F. Bunn. special
agent of the Treasurj' Department at
Washington. D. C, on the charge that the
goods were Imported from Canada without
the payment of the required duty.
Mr. Lewis cas that the seizure does not
worrj him in the least, since the duty vas
Included In the price of the fure, and since
he can show positively that he had no In
tention to defraud the Government.
Several das ago Colonel J. A. Montgom
ery, special agent in charge in St. Louis,
received notification that Mr. Lewis had re
ceived bj express a consignment of goods
bought in Montreal. Canada. Investigation
showed that Mr. Lewis had received a
package of the kind described, and Special
Agent Eunn called upon Lewis in his down
town office.
Lewis admitted that he had received the
goods and wont out to his home with the
special agent, where he turned over the
furs. The property was placed In the hands
of Charles II. Smith, customs officer of thls
port, who will hold It pending action on the
case In Washington. ,
Mr. Lewis said last, night that he had
bought the fur. which, ho claims, reprjsent
a valuation of about KM. from Charles
DesjardliL. S. Sors of Montreal.
"It is lbsolutely untrue." said he, "that
I did or attempted to smuggle the property
into the United Slates. The question of
duty came up between me and th firm from
whom I bousht. and, as I understood, the
duty charge-- were to be Included in the
purchase price. It was the arrangement
that the furs were then to be "nt to me in
Xew Tork. I received them In the latter
place and brought them with me to St.
Louis."
PASTOR ESCAPES
THROUGH A WINDOW.
Flees From Church to Escape the
Wrath of Young Men He
Had Denounced.
After denouncing two voung men who,
he said, had disturbed an Epwortlt League
meeting at the Washington Street Metho
dist Chur'h in Alton. Sunda, the pastor,
the Rev erend J. W. Borah, jumped through
a window and escaped the vengeance of
those whom he had upbraided. With him
went several members of the congregation,
who found the same convenient avenue of
escape.
Throughout the panic that followed when
onef of the men who had been rebuked drew
a revolver the minister's brave little wife
stood up and coolly held her ground. After
a time order was restored and the excited
pastor, with his child, was found. The
mother seemed less frightened than any who
v Itnessed the occurrence.
Two oung men came to the meeting as
ccorts of two oung lady members of the
church, and while the services were going
on. It Is said, persisted in talking loudly.
The were admonished by the pastor, but
paid no heed Finally the minister threat
ened to send for the police. This made the
joung men more offensive, and finally sev
eral members retired in quest of an officer.
It was then that one of the men drew a re
volver from his pocket and flourished t,
with a threat to ivenge the rebuke admin
istered to him.
Instantly there was a panic In the church.
The pastor evidently thought that he was
to be the center of attack, and with agilitv
he sprang to a near-by window and quickly
madt his "tit. After securing a footing on
the ground h stopped long enough to have
his wife hand him out their baby, and then
he made tracks as fast as he could for a
place of safety. The wife did not follow
him. but sta ed and faced the excitement.
While frightened members were climbing
over tiers of seat In an effort to Ilnd a
door or a window, several husky oung men
s-truggled witn tne men wlio had caused all
the trouble and succeeded In getting them
out of the church. OTIcers McKee, Brenner
nd Winkler soon were upon the scene and
placed under arrest Joseph and Alfred De
muth, who were taken jesterday before
Police Magistrate Few and bound over for
trial under J30O bord.
It was said at Alton yeterday thit the
Reverend Mr. Bornh had gone to Lebanon.
Mo., to tender to tho Presiding Elder his
resignation. Mr. Boraii is a stuuent at Mc
Kendree College while -arrlng on his min
isterial work, and is an athletic vouns
man who has some renown on the football
gridiron, having been connected with the
jlcKendree team In several of Its contests.
The oung men who are Involved In the
difficulty are brothers and belong to a
prominent Alton family. The disturbance
caused a big sensation In
Alton.

Dcs Mcines, la., Dec. 2. The annual -e-rcrt
of the Iowa Railroad Commissioners

-The absorption of the smaller lines by
the lirger ones will be, on account of the
safeguards provided by the railway laws of
this State. Deneticlal rather than otherwise
to the peorle ot the State, it has had the
effect not only of placing the weaker line

SCRAP IRON TRUST
IS TALKED OF.
Itepm-t Tlmta Combine Will Con
trol the Market for Thin
Commodity.
MAY HAVE $10,000,000 CAPITAL
Two Luinl LJuveix Say DwiIlhs
Should !N"ot lie Alarmed De
pend on Law of Supply
and Demand.
Dealer in scrap iron and steel in St.
Louis are interested in the reports that
come from the East announcing the prob
able formation of a scrap iron trutt, with
a capital of 110.000 OuO. for the purpose ot
controlling the market for this commodity.
Rumors of some such movement have
been thick ever since the Republic Iron
and Steel Company, several months ago,
made an effort to buy all Ita scrap iron and
steel directly from the producers. This un
dertaking, so the dealers assert, dll not
meet immediate or decided success, and it
is their blief that It will not be prolonged
greatly.
"The Iron and Steel Companj of Amer
ica" is said to be the name of the proposed
new trust. It is also said to be the Inten
tion of the Incorporators not only to buy
scrap Iron and steel, but to manufacture all
products of those and other metals.
"I do not put much faith in the report."
said F. Majer of Xo. 10J) Xorth Twelfth
street jestcrdav. "Even if tome of these
reports should lie true it need not unduly
alarm the regular dealers. The law of sup
Ply and demand will very quickly settl anv
trouble that maj arise. If an attempt
should be made to force up the prfi.es of
iron and -teci scrap such a sunolv unuM
come from Europe that the price would go
the other wa).
"I rememLer a similar case several ears
ago when manj dealers expected to sef
wrought iron bring at least 4 cents a pound.
More than a million tons of the metat were
on the oeean at one time, coming here to
supplj the extraordinarj demand. The re
sult was that the price fell from Jt a ton
to 110 a ton in less than slxn iijis. Thi.
same thing will happen again if the trust
or an combination of dealers attempts to
force pi ices out of their legitimate range.
The dealers hardlv- need to organize to win
that fight."
S. Schwartz ot Xo 1219 Xorth Eighth
street aid that he had heard --evcral times
recently of proposed consolidations, but be
licved that nothing would come of them.
"If an thing of ths kind should be at
tempted," he said, the dealers would be able
to fight effectivelv. The railroads do not
now sell much of their old material to deal
ers, but deal directly with manuafcturers.
The rest of the trade we certainly can make
a stubborn fight for. At the worst, the
manufacturers could only refuse to buy
what we had to sell, and there is nothing
to prevent the building of a new mill, if that
should become necessarj. in order to make
a market for our scrap."

RELIGIOUS BUILDING AT FAIR.
Committee Presents Plans and Pe
tition lo President Francis.
The officers of the World'h Fair Religious
Building and Exhibit Committee jet-tenl.iy
formally presented the petition signed !)
the various religious bodies to President
Francis of the Louisiana Purchase Kxposl
tlon Company.
Doctor Xiccolls, as chairman, urged the
granting of the petition for a separate
building on the ground of the far-reaching
power and Influence of religion in building
up the civilization which made the Exposi
tion a possibility. He said also that It
would not only require a separate building,
bnt that it should be of such magnitude as
would afford ample space for the proposed
exhibits, and of such architectural beauty
as would be a real attraction for the re
ligious world.
Father Phelan, vice chairman of the com
mittee. Indorsed the position taken by Doc
tor Xiccolls. and called special attention to
the advertising power of such a building.
He said that the refiglousi press of the world
would gladly donate space for everything ot
Interest In the entire preposition, and each
religious organization would be put on Its
mettle as to Its own particular exhibit. He
was satisfied that the great Catholic de
positories of the world would lend their
most precloiw treasures for an exhibit.
.Vector Johnston said that the Exposition
owCd the same recognition to religion as to
education, to liberal arts, iggriculture and
Mil other exhibits for which separate build
ings Werp to be erected.
Mr. Llndruy, secretary of the committee
presented plans of a building, which had
