The State Journal Is a memW ot the
Associated Press and receives tne full day
teiejsraDh report at that great news or.
ranization for exclusive evening publi
cs Hon in Topeka.
The State Journal receives for exclusive
publication the leased wire report Gf tne
Publishers' Press tor the edition for Ban
cs v morning:.
The news is received In the Ptats Jour
nal building over wires for this sole pur
pose. Moscow is evidently a good place not
to hold a peace conference.
Another strong point in favor of the
president's message is that the New
fork American was disappointed in it.
Senator Depew has been credited with
Wearing a smile that won't come off,
tout there is a suspicion abroad that it
ia evaporating.
Xow the price of Mr. J. Pierpont Mor
gan's gold brick has advanced to ten
minion dollars but we still find it very
easy to conceal our sorrow.
Very likely I. K. Lambert can think
"f a precedent which ought to satisfy
IHstrict Attorney Dean that he was rot
necessarily entitled to a reappointment.
The worst thing about the federal
regulation of life insurance companies
ihat the president recommends is that
pome of the insurance companies favor
it also.
Anyway Mabelje Gilman is acquiring
a choice line of theatrical advertising
notwithstanding the damage it may be
doing to the family and feelings of Mil
lionaire Corey.
It is announced that Kansas will gret
130,000 packages of congressional seeds
in the annual free seed distribution that
is about to begin. But will congress
guarantee that they will grow?
The Lawrence Journal seems to have
been badly scooped in finding out that
J. Leeford Brady was to be its new
editor. All the other papers made the
discovery a week ahead of the esteemed
Journal.
The president discusses corporations
otherwise known as trusts in such
an off-hand way in his message that
one is constrained to believe he could
t-ay still more on the subject should
the occasion demand it.
Mr. John A. McCall had an idea it
was only a little breeze, but as he sees
the havoc it has brought, to the house
of McCurdy he is convinced it must be
a regular hurricane. And what bothers
him most is that it is still blowing.
A dispatch from Washington says
Sresident Roosevelt thinks football
ought to be a kicking game. If the
14-esldent should hear the way some
teams abuse the referee he wouldn't
want any more kicking in it than there
Is now.
Notwithstanding all the fun that has
Tree it poked at Harvard because of its
poor showing in football, it is noticed
that the all-eastern team contains four
Harvard players, the same number as
Tale, while Dartmouth, Princeton and
Pennsylvania have only one each.
"Czar Nicholas," says the Chicago
News, "has surrounded himself with
53,000 troops and now feels sure that
iiis loving subjects won't do anything
9o harm him." Yes, he would feel
cuite comfortable if he were also sure
Ifcat his 16,000 troops won't either.
Nevada seems to be attractive to per
sons near the top of the steel trust. Mr.
Schwab, the former head of the trust,
has gone to Nevada to get himseif elect
ed to the United States senate, and the
w;? of the present head of the trust
has gone there to get a divorce.
Mrs. W. E. Stanley and Mrs. Cora
Or. Lewis will assist the state board of
control in purchasing the supplies for
the state's charitable institutions. This
isn't a bad idea. The average woman is
a far better buyer than the average
man when it comes to purchasing
household supplies.
"Governor Hanly of Indiana," says
the Kansas City Star, "has ousted his
adjutant general as peremptorily as he
did the state auditor. Hanly has a way
of ousting dishonest officials first and
having his prolonged 'controversy' with
th"m afterward. Which is better than
the Kansas plan."
The farmers down in the Second dis
trict really ought to get a few more
congressional candidates like Henry
Alien into the field. The congressiona!
candidate fieid is here referred to. It
is related that Mr. Alien carries an
expert oorn-husker with him in the
canvassing tour he is making in the
district this fall. When he runs across
a farmer husking corn he stops the
farmer and puts his own man to work
in the corn field, so that trie farmer
shall not lose valuable time in listen
ing to Mr. Alien's observations about
,-n(, v pother and other matters inei
tten'.Hlh'. Now if tic-re wei-r- enough
etiliUt fflfowii.fr Mr. Alton's plan
; ,s tanners couii put la- conslderuble
time saving the country, and their
corn-husking would not be neglected
in the meantime. The plan certainly
has its good features.
A RECORD TO BE PROUD OP.
How proud of their record must be the
gentlemen who compose the state school
fund commission of Kansas! As they
glance back over the deals they have
made and the bonds they have bought,
can they not proudly exclaim, "Couid
we have done better for ourselves and
our friends?"
To be sure the school fund may have
suffered. The children of the state may
have been defrauded out of some of their
education in order that these "success
ful" deals might be made, but that is
evidently not what the Kansas school
fund commissioners are looking out lor.
This proud record begins just a f.--w
days after the present commission got
possession of the school fund, when Mr.
J. R. Burrow as chairman of the school
fund commission purchased from Mr.
J. R. Burrow as president of the Home
Investment company $14,000 of Smith
Center bonds. The bond3 are, of course,
good, but Mr, Burrow as president of
the school fund commission was so care
ful of the interests of Mr. Burrow as
principal owner of the bonds that he
allowed the latter Mr. Burrow to clip
enough coupons from the bonds they
were bearing five per cent interest to
bring them down to four per cent, there
by netting Mr. Burrow as chief owner
of the bonds something over $2,000 profit
on the deal, to the detriment of the
school children's trust fund of which
Mr. Burrow was a trustee.
How many such deals the commis
sion has to its credit the State Journal
does not know. It does know, however,
of the Dodge City deal, which Superin
tendent Dayhoff seemed anxious to get
through for his bond broker friend, D.
E. Dunn, but which was stopped, after
Messrs. Burrow and Coleinun had signed
the warrant to pay for the bonds, by the
refusal of the auditor's office to register
them, and the subsequent discovery that
the valuation figures of Dodge City had
been juggled to get thein. high enough
to allow the bonds to be legally pur
chased. The State Journal also knows of the
Comanche county bond deal, whereby
either the state school fund stands to
lose $123,000, or the people of Coman
che county have had fastened upon
them by the state an unjust and dis
honest debt a debt that they never
contracted, from which they never
secured one cent'8 worth of benefit,
and which no moral obligation binds
them to pay, although a court decree
does so. The devious and secret
manipulations by which this deal was
carried out, including the embezzle
ment of $123,000 of the state's money
to finance it, are too familiar to the
people of Kansas to need repeating
here; and it was all done to aid an
other bond broker friend of the com
mission to make a profit of something
over $11,000 on the deal: It was, per
haps, the school fund commission's
proudest achievement,
The carefulness with which the
school children's money has been in
vested is shown by the fact that after
the First National bank failure the
commission could not buy a large
number of gilt-edged bonds on account
of "no funds," although the books
showed something like $300,000 on
hands. And at the same time T. T.
Kelly, as state treasurer, was securing
funds from some mysterious source
with which to meet warrants, to refuse
to pay which might have been ex
tremely serious for him.
Then there is the latest exhibition of
carefulness on the part of the school
fund commission as brought out this
week in the Wichita bond case care
fulness to buy of certain friendly
brokers. The city of Wichita offered,
through its mayor, $45,000 of 4 per
cent bonds, but the rate was too low to
suit the school fund commissioners.
They have become very particular at
times since the Smith Center deal.
But Mayor Ross discovered that other
4 per cent offers, not as good as his,
had been taken when offered by
brokers or friends of the commission
instead of by a municipality direct.
Whe.i he presented these facts to the
commission, Messrs. Burrow, Dayhoff
and Coleman concluded that the Wich
ita bonds might be a good investment
after all.
Really, these gentlemen ought to
have been in charge of a New York
life insurance company.
MITCHELL.
The end that has come to John H.
Mitchell, convicted United States sena
tor from Oregon, is indeed pitiable. A
man who for forty years has held a
high and honorable place in the af- j
fairs of men most of that time in the
United States senate; comes to the
close of his career dishonored and dis
graced, because he yielded to perhaps
a single temptation late in his career.
Senator Mitchell was not regarded
as simply an ordinary grafter. While
he may have made mistakes, until
within recent months he has been re
garded as a highly honorable gentle
man. At the age of seventy years the
reputation of a lifetime was swept
from him by the discovery of his con
nection with the Oregon land frauds, a
charge that his colleagues could not
credit and his friends refused to be
lieve when first made.
With disgrace fastened upon him in
his old age and imprisonment in a
common jail staring him in the face,
it is little wonder that his health was
undermined; and when seized with a
slight affliction his physical nature
could not resist it.
The sad part of it is that Senator
Mitchell should have sacrificed a life
long honorable reputation by giving
way as he did to dishonor, and should
then be cut off with no opportunity to
retrieve himself.
Senator Mitchell's case is conspicu
ous because of his prominence and the
height from which he fell; yet similar
cases are by no means rare in the an
nals of everyday life. Why can not
men learn the terrible lesson of giving
way to dishonor from example instead
of experience?
Every Kansas editor who knows John
E. Junkin. and most of thm do. will
j vote aye three or four times on the
proposition to make . him president cf
the National Editorial association.
Junkin is somewhat peculiar. Although
he finds time to "gad" a good deal to
all the editorial associations, he man
ages to get out a number one country
paper in a number three town number
three as to size but not quality, how
ever. In some ways the Sterling Bulle
tin is a model country newspaper, and
its editor is deserving of high honors for
what he has accomplished in the coun
try newspaper field, particularly as he
is an all-around good man besides.
SUCCESS.
A Boston firm recently offered sev
eral prizes for the best essay on the
subject, "What Constitutes Success ?"
It was stipulated that the essay must
be under one hundred words in length.
A Kansas woman, Mrs. A. J. Stanley
of Lincoln, submitted a definition of
success in the contest. It was consid
ered In competition tvith several hun
dred others from all parts of the coun
try, and a few days ago Mrs. Stanley
received a draft for two hundred and
fifty dollars, with the information that
she had won the first prize. Her defi
nition was as follows:
"He has achieved success who has
lived well, laughed often and loved
much; who has gained the respect of
intelligent men and the lovo of little
children; who has filled his niche and
accomplished his task; who has left
the world better than he found it,
whether by an improved poppy, a per
fect poem, or a rescued soul; who has
never lacked appreciation of earth's
beauty or failed to express it; who has
always looked for the best in others
and given the best he had; whose life
was an inspiration; whose memory a
benediction."
Mrs. Stanley i3 the wife of the county
superintendent of schools iu Lincoln
county. Her husband also represented
that county in the legislature of 1899.

LA FOLLETTE.
The announcement that "Bob" La
Follette has finally decided to leave the
governorship of Wisconsin and enter
the United States senate is an agreeable
one, for the reason that that part of
the public which does not look upon
LaFollete as a tired and true re
former is anxious to see him tested.
LaFollette has stood the test in its ev
ery application in Wisconsin; the ques
tion is. is he big enough to "make good"
In the United States senate.' The answer
to that question will be one of the most
interesting spectacles the country has
witnessed Among LaFollette's ac
quaintances none questions his honesty
or hifi sincerity. But the qualities he
has demonstrated in winning his long
fight in Wisconsin will get him into
trouble with the senate. They will tan
gle up with senatorial courtesy, and
raise bumps on senatorial conservatism
at every turn. LaFollette goes out of
Wisconsin with the record of a great
job, well done. He enters the senate

enthusiasm to mix things up a bit for

She Let Him Have It.
Among the passengers on a western
train recently, says the Boston Journal,
was a woman very much over dressed,
accompanied by a bright-looking nurse
girl and a self-willed, tyrannical boy of
about three years. The boy aroused the
indignation of the passengers by his
continued kicks and shrieks and
screams, and his viciousness toward his
patient nurse. He tore her bonnet,
scratched her hands, and finally spat in
her face without a word of remonstrance
from the mother. Whenever the nurse
manifested any firmness the mother
chlded her sharply. Finally the mother
composed herself for a nap, and about
the time the boy had slapped the nurse
for the fifth time a bug came sailing in
and flew on the window of the nurse's
seat. The boy at once tried to catch it.
The nurse caught his hand and said,
coaxingly: "Harry mustn't touch. Bug
will bite Harry." Harry screamed sav
agely and began to kick and pound the
nurse. The mother, without opening her
eyes or lifting her head, cried out sharp
ly: "Why do you tease that child so,
Mary? Let him have what he wants at
once." "But, ma'am, it's a " "Let
him have it, I say." Thus encouraged,
Harry clutched at the bug and caught it.
The screams of pain that followed
brought tears ot joy to the passengers'
eyes. Tha mother awoke again. "Mary,"
she cried, "let him have it." iviary
turned in her seat and said, confusedly:
"He's got it, ma'am." "What is it?"
languidly asked the mother, as the
screams increased. "A wasp, ma'am,"
said the nurse-.
Kmbarrassed Bridegroom.
He was embarrassed, ill at ease; she
was calm, self-possessed.
"If it were only over," he whispered
excitedly; "I know I'll do it wrong."
"It won't take long, John," she an
swered consolingly. "You haven't
much to say."
The minister was speaking. "Kindly
change places with the bride."
John attempted to do so, stepped on
the toe of her shoe, and raising his
arm caught his cuff button in her veil.
"Do be careful," she implored.
"Oh," he groaned, "before all these
staring people, too."
"Sh-h-h "
The minister began the ceremony.
John grew more embarrassed, and
fumbled with the roses of her bouquet.
Then he put his hand in his pocket and
pulling out his handkerchief, excitedly
mopped his brow.
The church was quiet save for the
voice of the minister.
"If any person knows any just rea
son," he was saying, "why these two
should not be joined together, let him

Wanted to Save Trouble.
He loved his fellowman, and any
body of perception could see it, but he
was a stranger. He stood more than
an hour in front of the Stimson build
ing yesterday afternoon watching an
automobile berthed alongside the curb.
The machine was dripping, dripping,
dripping. The stranger saw it and in-
stanted assumed guard, driving away
an persons who came near with lighted
cigars, or pipes. Certain men de
murred, but none rebelled violently.
One pedestrian thoughtlessly threw a
cigarette stump upon the "pavement
near the flowing steam from the auto
mobile mechanism, but the stranger
quickly stamped upon it and darted an
indignant glance toward the careless
man.
When the chauffeur came out of the
building and entered the auto the
stranger said:
"You're losing your gasoline, and I
have kept it from catching on fire, and
blowing up."

man: "that's water." Los Angeles Ex

THE EVENING STOR Y
Prom the Gallery.
By Constance D'Arcy Mackay.
They sat in the fitst row of the gal
lery. Now that the tumult of the tush
was over the girl had time to take off
her hat and smooth her rumpled hair.
She was still breathless and her cheeks
were glowing. The man beside her
turned and looked back triumphantly.
"We did pretty well to get this far
front," he said. "There's a whole lot
of people back there standing up. It's
always a packed house for an all-star
show."
"Yes," assented the girl, vaguely.
"You see, it's all so so new and so
strange. I've only been to the theater
once before in my life. That was when
Uncle Ben took me to see -Shore Acres.'
Oh, that was so real. I could almost
believe it was true. Will thi3 be like
'Shore Acres, do you thinkr"
The man spread his programme out
on his knee. "Well. no. not exactly," he.
answered. "This is 'Romeo and Juliet.
I ain't strong on Shakespeare myself,
but I thought you might like to eee it,
Esther." .
"Thank you, Mr. Stubbins," said the
giri, with a grateful glance.
She was a pretty girl, fair-haired and
fragile "peaked looking" was the wa
the people in her aunt's dingy Last
side boarding house described her, when
they spoke of her at all, for a3 errand
girl, dish washer and general drudge
Esther was not used to much considera
tion. The boarders seldom noticed her.
True, there had been the gawky art
student who used to take delight in
drawing her thin, delicate profile, and
who always murmured "spirttuelle
when she passed him the pickles. But
until Mr. Stubbins came no ohe ever
had given her so much as a kind word.
He spoke to her when they met in the
hall, and once he had taken her to walk
in the park. It was after that that he
had asked her to go to the theater.
When this piece of news spread
among the boarders they exchanged
significant glances; mil v
turned out to ue "rtomeu an o..
it seemed as if the climax had been
reached. One of the married women
sniffed reminiscently. "i remeinuei

during the last act."

thought Mr. StuDbins as a

was red-facea and puffy, with abnor
mally large hands and feet. Still, as
Esther acknowledged to herself, ne
was kind, kinder than any one else had
ever been in all her life.

you, Esty," she said, "if Mr. Stubbins
should ask you to marry him. Besides,
I've got enougn to qo iu w o..

like a bump on a long, when he s talk

"Yes. aunt," said Esther, thinking
more of the theater than of Mr. Stub
b'n ind now at last she was there in
side the theater. The lights, the
music the sense of waiting for one
knew not what all were intoxicating.
She hardlv saw the hurrying ushers,
the people taking their places. At
length came the magic instant when
the overture died to a whisper, the
footlights shone luminously in the
darkness and the great curtain rose
slowly, giving to view a scene m
Verona. ,
When it fell there was a thunder of
j-. f ,v,ih TT.Kther seemed to
hear onlv the echo. "A-ah! she
breathed, with a little shiver. And in
spite of her aunt's instructions, that
was the only word she spoke all the
evening. Mr. Stubbins gave up all ef
forts at conversation and contented
himself with gazing about the house,
or watching the flushed, rapt face of
the girl beside him.
At length the final curtain fell. Mr.
Stubbins smiled at Esther. "Pretty
good show, that was," he observed
genially. "
His voice awakened Esther from her
dream of romance to the actual pres
ent of boarding houses and drudgery.
Yes oh. ves. Mr. Stubbins!" she
said. The flush had left her cheek,
and she was very pale.
They spoke little on the way home.
Esther was thinking of what she had
seen. Mr. Stubbins was wondering
which was the easiest and quickest
wav to propose.
On the steps of her aunt's boarding
house they paused. The street was
very still. The ugly rows of houses
opposite were touched by moonlight -such
moonlight as silvered the streets
of Verona long ago. Mr. Stubbins
cleared his throat. "Esty," he began,
"I ain't much at love making, like
that Romeo fellow we saw this even
ing, but mv business is doing well and
I'm thinking of settling down. You'd
make a fine Utile housekeeper. I took
to you from tire first you must have
seen that, and and I want you to
marry me."
As Esther listenea she had a fleeting
vision of Romeo. How gracefully he
had stood beneath that flower-hung
balcony, while Mr. Stubbins, red from
the unwontedness of Tove-making, look
ed more awakened and florid than ever!
She gave a little gasp of pleasure. Mr.
Stubbins thought. He smiled benefl
centlv "Of course you're surprised,"
he said, "and it's only natural. But I
mean what I say. You're lonely, and
I'm lonely. I ll give you a good home,
and you'll never be sorry for marrying
me."
Esther made a quick, despairing ges
ture. "Wait, Mr. Stubbins!" snc criea.
"I haven't said that I a marry you. jna
I can't say it. because I di$rt love you.
Oh. I know you can t understand, but
there are things a girl wants more than
a home a thousand times more! I
hope vou're not angry with me, Mr.
Stubbins. for you've always been so
kind, and 1 11 never forget your taking
me to see a play that showed me what
love really means."
She vanished into the hou:. leaving
the astonished Mr. Stubbing 5-gape cfn
the doorsteps. "Well," he ejaculated,
"that beats all! A man spends his
good money to take a girl to a show,
and then she goes and acts like that!
I thought seeing Romeo would fix mat
ters, but you never can depend on a
woman, anyhow."

A Feminine Railroader.
The artistic ability of a woman has
been recognized by four of the great
railroad companies in an unusual man
nr bv th appointment of Mrs. An
, nslta ii McCrea. to be architect and
landscape gardener in charge of every
station along the route of the roads
and their branches. Her husband was
an expert gardener and when, at his
death, Mrs. McCrea was thrown upon
her own resources in supporting and
educating her two daughters, she real
ized that happy hours in the past had
provided her with a pract' al knowledge
of landscape gardening. Though a wo
man landscape artist is not usual and
the popular opinion is that th
work demands a man, Lincoln Park,
Chicago is, perhaps, the best known
testimonial to Mrs. McCrea's ability.
Her duties with the various railroads
are to lay out grounds at stations, re
port artistic arrangement of cokns for
painting depots, suggest plans for im
proving unsightly Toints around station
buildings, and, in general, to make the
scenery of the systems more attractive.

tentiary now. I believe it was forgery for
the purpose of keeping up appearances or
something o that kind." Chicago Record-Herald.
"My wife refuses to let me correct my
small boy. She says it will break his
spirit."
"But your wife corrects you, doesn't
she?"
"I should say she did. But then he
claims I never had any spirit." Cleve

GLOBE SIGHTS.
From the Atchison Globe.
The club, all through life, seems to
be in the wrong' hands.
The meanest father that ever lived
isn't half as mean as the meanest
husband.
What has become of the old fash
ioned child who was taught "Pretty is
as pretty does?"
The open season on the old man's
pocketbook begins January 1, and
ends December 31.
The men should have less objection
to the women's club, considering that
they are not expected to attend.
Instead of praying for strength to
bear misfortunes, why would it not be
a good idea to pray for sense enough
to avoid them?
"If I ever assault a man," said
Church White this morning, "it will
be to make him turn a picture, he is
carrying up street, face out."
As It gets nearer and nearer to
Christmas, the men of the family wiil
begin to feel aa limp as a doll that has
had a. hemorrhage of sawdust.
There isn't anything a boy plays
with that will make of him a picture
as pretty as a little girl makes with
her doll, and he suffers a similar
handicap when grown up.
We have noticed that when a wo
man goes into a dry goods store and
asks to see the silk, she talks louder
than if she wanted to see the calico.
When a man does wrong, and his
mother attempts to shield him she is
only continuing a mistake she began
when she shielded him as a boy; those
who are promptly punished are not so
apt to do wrong again. Every one
seems to learn his lesson In life quick
er than a mother.
QUAKER REFLECTIONS.
Fiom the Philadelphia Record.
Y'ou can't tell an angel cake by it
wings.
A civil engineer isn't always as po
lite as you might suppose.
Even the tight rope walker may
complain when things are slack.
The height of realism is to sing coon
songs until you are black in the face.
The pessimist who is always looking
for the worst says it's just his luck not
to get it.
Foresight may be all right, but it
won't keep a man from being stabbed
in the back.
Never tell secrets in a conservatory
unless you are sure there are no rub
ber plants around.
The actor may be able to forget that
he has an audience, but he can't al
ways forget that he hasn't one.
Only a few of us can have our faces
on bank notes. As for that, most of
us would prefer to have our hands on
then;.
Blobbs "We don't hear so much
talk about the deadly microbe any
more." Slobbs "No. the automobile
seems to have crushed it."
Overheard in the dime museum
"The sword swaliower is laid up." re
marked the living skeleton. "What'
the matter with him?" asked the fat
lady. "He got a fish bone in his
throat," said the living skeleton.
Wigg "Footlites seems to be hav
ing great trouble in getting a company
together for his new play." Wag"
"What's the name of it?" Wigg
" 'The Automobile.' " Wagg I sup

REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR.
From the New Y'ork Press.
A girl can nearly always improve her
complexion by kissing a man against
her will.
If a man acts as if he were deeply
interested in a woman's wit the wiil
take all the rest for granted.
Because you can see through a wo
man's shirt waist is no sign you can
see through her idea of wearing it that
way.
Without, half trying a widow can
make a man believe little children wiil
teach her more worldllness than sh
knows.
When you are going through a tun
nel with a pretty girl it does seem a
great waste of time to liave the lights
turned on for so short a time.
Still at It.
