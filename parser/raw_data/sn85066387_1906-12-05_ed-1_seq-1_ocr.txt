to Senator Raynor of Maryland, who
wished to introduce a resolution on
the Japanese situation. It -was read
and went over until tomorrow.
The same action vras taken with ref
erence to the Foraker and Penrose
resolutions of yesterday relating to the
discharged negro troops.
Senator Raynor's resolution on the
Japanese question follows:
"Resolved, That in the opinion of the
Senate this Government has no right to
enter into any controversy with any
foreign Government relating to the
public school system of any *of the
States in the Union.
"Resolved, further. That it Is the
opinion of the Senate that there is no
provision In the treaty between the
TTnited States and the Government of
Japan that relates in any manner to
this subject or in any way interferes
with the right of the State of California
to conduct and administer its system of
public schools In accordance with its
own legislation; and
"Resolved, further. That it Is the
duty of the President of the United
States to notify the Government of
Japan and to notify any foreign gov
ernment with which the question may
arise, that the public educational In
stitutions of the States are not within
the jurisdiction of the United States
and the United Sttaes has no power
to regulate or supervise their admin
istration."

that Campbell, Metson & Campbell's

BAGNIO
Witnesses Tell the Grand
Jury How He Shared the
Profits of Its Cribs
GAVE ADVICE ABOUT
CONDUCT OF KESOET
Testimony Shows That He
Was a Frequent Visitor
at 620 Jackson Street
"Herbert Schmitz was one
of the four stockholders of the
*municipal house' at 620 Jack
son street. He visited it about
three or four times a month
and looked over the books. He
frequently made recommenda
tions concerning its manage
ment. There were about % 133
rooms in the place and the
weekly earnings aggregated
$3830. This was split four
lt\-j. Schmitz got one-fourth
and the remainder was diviucd
between 'James Finnigaxu
yjoseph '\u25a0 Michel ": Emilio
'Lastreto.' Schmitz .was well
known as one of the partners
of the place and was looked
upon as such by the inmates and
those connected with the man
agement." — Testimony of Paul
Heudiara before Grand Jury.
Direct testimony that Herbert
Schmitz, brother of the Mayor,
shared the profits of the cribs of
the house at 620 Jackson street
was given before the Grand Jury
yesterday by Paul Heudiara, who
was manager of the establishment
up to the time of the April fire.
Heudiara was on the stand for
more than an hour, and his testi
mony was of a most conclusive
and positive character.
He told, among other things,
how the Mayor's, brother fre
quented* the establishment and
discussed details of its manage
ment — how his connection with it
was openly discussed among the
inmates — and how a fourth- of the
weekly wages of shame was paid
over to him.
•Heudiara's testimony, in brief,
demeaned the name of Schmitz as
it has not been demeaned since
the investigation into municipal
graft was started.
Called to the stand and ques
tioned by Prosecutor Heney,
Heudiara briefly recounted the
i history of the house, which has
; been more or less a matter of se
i crecy since it was opened in 1904.
"The real owners of 620 Jack
son street were Herbert Schmitz,
James Finnegan. Emilio Las
treto and Joseph Michel," he
said. "Michel had a relative
named Joseph Alexander, who
was supposed to be the owner of
the place, but in reality he had
nothing to do with its manage
ment. • The money realized from
the place was banked in Alexan
der's name, but Michel had charge
of it and was the real representa
tive of the owners. It was he
who looked after protection and
paid out all the money that went
for this purpose. I know little
about that, but I do know that he
was the man who took charge
of it.""
