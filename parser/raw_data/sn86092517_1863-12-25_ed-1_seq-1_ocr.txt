The Anniversary of Christmas.
' Peace on Earth and Good Witt to 5Tan."
The first thing in connection with this
blessed anniversary which rurshes upon the
mind is the shocking inconsistency and
criminal recklessness of many of the pro
fessed ministers and deciples ot Him whom
this day commemorates I The oxalted ap
pellation of "Prince of Peace was given
to Christ when he was fulfilling his mission
upon earth. Princes of war and of carnage
are the titles earned by too many of his
Pulpit and others disciples. The doctrines
of Christ were Peace, Love, Tolerance, Hu
mility and Charity. Their doctrines are
War and Slaughter, Hatred between breth
ren, Malevolence, Pride and Vengeance.?
Christ's doctrine is to even love your ene
mies? their s is to exterminate them lrom
the face of the Earth. In the whole mis
sion of Christ and of his immediate disci
ples, employed, as it was, when the world
recognized the relation of master and ser
vant, there i3 not a word that looks like the
tierce proscription and bloody Abolition
spirit of some of tho clergy of to-day.
Christ, in an especial manner, condemned
the sources of discord ? the stirrers-up of
strife. Many of those who profess to rev
erence His name, and be His humble disci
ples, are the great apostles of political
agitation and strife. Christ taught that
men should "render unto Cjesar the things
that are Ojesar's," a tiguro of speech em
ployed to inculcate obedience to the civil
powers ; but how many of His pretended
followers preach to us a Higher Law that
is disobedience to civil Government !
What a mockery in vital essential creed
is there between the pure, pacific, kind and
humane teachings of the Redeemer, and
the bloody, violent, ferocious and hateful
dogmas of the hypocrits who assume the
mantle of Hi* name to hide their evil
deeds.
Is it improper on this blessed anniversary,
to hope that before another Christmas rolls
around, reconciliation between brethren
mav take place, and white-winged peace
shall dawn upon out c e happv Trountryf
May we not hope that ere ano* ior Christ
mas the father-;, brother*, husbands, sons
and lovers, who are now engaged in the
fearful butchery of each other, will be
peacefully enjoying the sweet society of the
beloved ones at home around the old famil
iar hearth.
LETTERS FROM WASHINGTON
Special Correspondent to the Wheeling Re gist ex.
Washington, Dec. 22, 1863.
The funeral of Major General Bufordtook
place on Sunday last, under circumstances
showing the high estimate in which deceas
ed was held by the authorities and the army.
The pall bearers were Gens. Casey, Heintzle -
man, Sickles, Schofield. Hancock, Double,
day, Augur and Warren. The body was
conducted from the church where the last
services were performed, to the Railroad
depot, thence tu be taken to W est Point,
New York, for interment. Our citizens
generally showed their sympathy with the
bereavement suffered by the dc<eased's
family, friends and fellow soldiers.^
Whatever might be the result of the in
vestigation by the committee in John P.
Hale's bribery case, his own statement in
the Senate appears tc. l?e universally consid
ered as a virtual contusion of judgment. ?
Ho took firt-t $2000 as a retaining fee, and
then demanded and received an additional
51000. He attempts adefense on the ground
that he was a fauytr, but this is untenable
because untrue. He performed no legal
services; he appeared before no court, the
only tribunal to which he appealed was the
Secretary of War, and there as a promin
ent abolition leader, he succeeded iu his ef
fort. Mr. Hale's own conscience would not
have pricked him had the services been
those merely of a lawyer, and in going to a
man of the well-known antecedents of Rev
erdy Johnson to get advice, he went where
he had reason to be . ieve he would get some
thing whereby he might dupe and blind his
conscience and keep the money. Mr. John
son did not say the thing that was strictly
just and truo when he said bo was in the
babit of doing such things as that which
was contemplated by Mr. Hale. Mr. John
son could not do it. He cannot even get
common justice for a client, to wit, the
Fita John Porter case, wherein the com
monest order of the courts was outraged in
prejudice of his client. Again, Mr. John
sou. printed and published a review of the
testimony in the said Porter case, but it was
r*fused passage through the mails 1 It is
plain then that Mr. Hale was feed to use
lis poliiiaal influence; he did use it, and was
paid for it, This i s the third recent case of
fefc- I II n^r
the kind. Mr, Charles Sumner led off. ?
Early in Mr. Lincoln'* term a claim for half
ft million of dollars held by some Northern
merchant, was rejected in whole or part by
the accounting- officers, of the Treasury.
After Jong and persevering exertions by the
claimant, the claim Was firmly denied. In
the exigency, Mr. Sumner was appealed to.
He undertook the business, and came to
Washington, where his [progress in get
ting the whole claim out of the Gov
ernment was like that of Caesar a against
Pharnaees. He might, and uerhaps did
exclaim, veni, vidi, vici. How'tnuoh Mr.
Sumner was rewarded for this exploit has
not publicly transpired, but nothing short
of $10,000 is at all likely. Again, the old
Senator from Rhode Island who preceded
Mr. Sprague, was publicly exposed aud dis
graced as the recipient of a bribe of $50,
000 for a corrupt use of his legislative posi
tion. Here theu we have three New Eng
land Senator* spotted, and the well-read 1
politician will remember that the newspa
pers some few years ago levelled very simi
la r shafts at Senator Hamlin, These circum
stances will afford some idea of tho purity
of leading New England Abolitionists, and
guide to the motives which govern ninety
nine-hundredths of the whole party, not
exceeding by any means the shining aboli
tion lights of the good city of Wheeling.
If you can find room for the scathing ex
posure published in the World touching
Secretary Stanton's management of the
Hurtt case, and the tender caro wherewith
Chase's abolition tools are protected at the
expense of the ruiu of noneat and upright
citizens and soldiers? to wit, Major M'Lean
? you ought to publish it. From all ap
pearances we have now in the administra
tion more corruption, violence, venality and
crini?_th&n all the past history of the coun
try Could gather into one heap. Such how
ever was to be expected from the party
which has sought to conceal its own wick
edness under imputations of disloyalty and
uni'aithfulne^s against men whose shoe's
latchets they are not worthy to unloose.
1 here never was a Christmas when ex
penditures were as great among our citizens,
both old and recent, as now. The store*
are supplied with the moat expensive arti
cle, from Paris and London, and they sell
notwithstanding. The specimens of topo
graphy from London are unsurpassed, and
seem notpossble to be excelled. Market
ing continues very high here; a turkey of
any pretensions will bring from $2$ to S3.
It is announced that the first sale of the
confiscated property in this region will take
place gn t.ho 11th of next month. Ttie
estate ofRobt. E. Lee, or the famous Arling
ton estate owned by the late Geo. Washing
ton Parke Curtis, the step-son of General
Washington, '.Till be first offered. It com
prises about 1,490 acres of land, and is most
eligibly situated. A difficulty must arise,
however, if the Constitution of the United
States is to be considered as of any further
validity, becauso whilst the Constitution
disallows the alienation of real estate from
the heirs of a cjnvi eted traitor, Judge Un
derwood has decidec( that tho fee simple
will be sold. *7 *
In a case before the United States Su
preme Court, involving i}*6 question of
legal tender, removed from a C^urt in New
York, the Supremo Court lias re/used to
consider the case for want of juris/u.'Ct'on.
There is probably somo informality
which this decision is ba^ed, otherwise it*
would appear that tho Supreme Court has
abnegated its authority and jurisdiction.
If this be tho case our Revolution is com
plete, aud America may .shut up her shop as
a free people ruled by laws. It might soon
be time to celebrate the entombment of the
Constitution and tho Republic by a grand
funeral profession, so that the great change
might be read and known of all men.
Pinnace.
Condition of Grant's Army.
A correspondent of the St. Louis Repub
lican vtho had just returned from Chatta
nooga, writes from Louisville the 15th:
The army ig getting into good condition,
rapidly, at front. Plenty of coarse food
i there now, for man and beast. The gener
al health of the troops is excellent. The
stock is in better condition than I expeeted
to find it, and not near so many mules have
deceased as reported. The inability to ob
tain long hav, straw and stalks ? renders the
bringing to process rather slow, and if at
least one-half of the entire army stock ?
say 20,000 head of mules and horses ? could
be spared and driven back to interior Ken
tucky, to winter, thousands of dollars could
be saved to the country.
The prospects are good for a long stay at
Chattanooga? three months at least? uu- i
less Grant concludes t# ramble into Georgia
with empty pocket and wallet, and without
a change of clothes. The utmost strain up
on the railroad south of Nashville onfy
keeps up a day or two of rations in advance, j
The other line of railroad, via Athens and '
Huntsville, is being rapidly repaired, but'
the long bridge at Duck river, near Colum
bia. will require a month in rebuilding. ?
The rebels eveu blasted down the stone
piers.
There is un effectual stoppage upon travel
to the army, except on strictly military bu
siness. Militnry conductors upon every i
train, ruthlessly tumble every passenger
ashore at the fir.-t station, who have not a
pass direct from headquarters at Cbatfanoo 1
ga. And uo goods whatever can pass over!
the railroad, save army supplier The ex
press company are restricted to the carriage i
of am all soldiers' packages, and the news
paper men can only carry so many pounds j
daily. Not a pound of sutlers' goods cau '
go forward.
I he express office at Stevenson is a sight
?so full of boxes and bundles. Sutlers'
g^ods are piled up in half the stores of
Nashville. There is nothing to sell at Chat- 1
tauoogr*. ard the soldiers are flush with
money. Er -i the supply of letter paper
and envelop ?, has been exhausted, and the
ose firm of newspapermen have sold pa-!
per?and stationery to the extent of $1,500'
per day ? at least one third of the amount
clear profit.
The Mormon theatrical company at Salt !
Lake City is playing "Ingomar," a story
which tolls of devoted Jove to a sin gle wife.
"Two hearts that beat a* one. ? "says Par
thenis. not half a dozen. ?
The Journal of Commerce thus analyses
public sentiment regarding the conscription,
with the renewal of which, modified or un
changed, we are threatened at the begin
ning of the new year :
"All married men over thirty-five think,
most decidedly, that the present division of
the enrolled into two classes should not be
abolished. They strongly approve of the
distincti n which makes all menunderthir
ty-five liable to be drafted first before they
can be drawn. On the other hand, the mar
ried men under thirty- five hold that the
present discrimination is perfectly ridicu
lous, not to say inhuman, and that Congress
ought to repeal it at once. This class of
Benedicts, and all the bachelors under forty
five (also included in thefirstdivision) form
a powerful majority of pnblic opinion, and
if they should undertake to petition Con
gress, would beat the second class by two
or three to one. ?
A more important proposition is that to
ttrike out the three hundred dollar exemp- j
tion clause; also the one allowing substi-1
tutes te be furnished, and making everybody j
who is drafted liable to serve. Here, too, j
the line between tbe friends and opponents!
of the amendment is elearly drawn. All
persons who have not three hundred dollars
about them are unanimously agreed that
this alteration, of all others, ought to be
made. To this, all persons who have three
hundred dollars and upwards at their dis
posal dissent eraf hatically and with one
voice. Such of them as are very flush with
greenbacks would be willing, as a compro.
mise. to let the government abolish the
three hundred dollar clause, and leave every
drafted person tree to hire a substitute on
the best terms that he could get; but as for
making the service ef every drafted man,
rich or poor, compulsory, that would be a
monstrous measure! Men over forty-five,
and therefore exempt from all draft, what
ever their condition of life, are disposed to
favor the amendment. They are rather
tired of the greatly augmented taxes Which
come from the city's assuming to pay com
mutation feps for all drafted men. And so
it goes; each man judging of the question,
as he judges of most other questions, by the
way that it affects himself."
General Banks' Department.
The New Orleans correspondent of the
Philadelphia Press writes, Dec 7th:
"Oen. Brink* H<u nnt sufficient troops to,
carry out hi* plans. Wbat those plana
may be no one i?ut himself can tall, and
he is not likely to divulge the secret. He
has been calling earnestly for more men,
for some time past, but bis demands have
not thus far been complied with. It is pro
bable that other department commanders
hare been equally earnest in their requests
for troops, and that Government jends to
the quarters where the most pressing need
is apparent. The great iuterest being in
northern Georgia, Gen. Grant is very prop
erly reinforced before other appeals were
heeded.
In West Louisiana the war seems to have
dwindled to comparative quiet. A few
months ago that section was swarming
with the troops of the rebel Dick Taylor,
who made up in activity what they lacked
in numbers. He was unable to keep his
command up to a proper fighting standard
Mid is now supposed to De recalled to Tex
as. Combined with the forces of Magru*
jer aud Holmes, Taylor's command will
enable *be rebels to take the offensive
against sc Part onr line.
Life in NTew Orleans is at present quite i
gflv. The Ea^tern^officers seem to form a
coterie of their from which those hail
ing from the Weh* are carefully excluded,
at least such is the complaint of some of
the Western men. 7be contrast betweeu
this and Gen. Grant's Apartments is very
great, as far as etiquette i^ concerned. At
Gen. Grant's headquarters the utmost
plainness is every whero apparent, the Gen
eral himself being the least pr?!.<;ndiug of
all. Here it is just the reverse, the red
tape being in all its glory.

admission to tho political body an oath of

State? and to the Union under it, why not

A correspondent comments as follow?:
Imagine aclergyman, who tells his h^ar
ors. "If it be proper for you to believe the
Bible, then, why then not beliave that all
my sermons are equally inspired?" The
people of the United States, North and
South, arc, or should be interested in main
taining forever, intact, the Constitution
transmitted to us by our fathers, while
tbey regard the vagaries of Abraham Lin
coln as the affairs of four years at most. ?

The Enrollment Act. ? It is understood
th it the majority of the committee on inil
ita ry affairs in the House are opposed to
repealing the comntation clause in the en
roll ment act, es reported from the Senear*
com ?ittee. Senator Wilson speaks of hip
intention to offer an amendment authoriz

Union Prisoners in Richmond. ? The
following letter was written, in- reply to a
query made by a citizen of Washington:
Fortress Monroe, Dec 19, 1863. ? Sir :
In reply to your inquiry of the 17th inst.,

Political Prayers.
The new Chaplain of the House, Mr. ?
Channing, indulges iu a prayer to God
about every morning, to help the republi
cans carry the Elections, not exactly in
those words, but this is the substance of
his Prayers. It is not probablet that he
will thus convert any Democrat sinners
from the errois of their wa^, ? but, on the
contrary, thus make them more persist in
them. Political Pa-sons are public nuusan

ion, but a boundless harm,

The list of the Rebel Congress shows that
the people of the Suuth have ejectcd from

England, 25 years ago, started this civil war
