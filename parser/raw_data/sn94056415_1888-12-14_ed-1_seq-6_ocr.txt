- _ . .public.our ; business men aro madly striving

* $ J3ns of capital outrun tho imagination in
• - e-magnitudo of their undertakings.
When tho experiment of our government
'I' as undertaken tho chart adopted for our
auklauco was tho constitution. Departure
Kotzz. tho lines there laid down is a failure.
-Bis only by a strict adherence to tho dircc-
* or they indicate and by restraint within
' fctfca limitations they fix that wo can furnish
yjsroa t to the world of the ability of tho AmerE
* * I3s people for self government
The equal and exact justice of which we
< * oast as the underlying principle of our in-
- -stitutions should not bo confined to tho rela-
"twos of our citizens to each other. The
. . * avernment itself is under bond to tho Amerr
• ricaa. people that in the exercise of its
v * • Sanctions and powers it will deal with the
' < &ody of our citizens in a manner scrupulous
"iybonest nd fair and absolutely just It has
• agreed that American citizenship shall be
"ttbaoaly credential nocessary to justify the
'Claim of equality before tho law and that no
• . • condition in lifo shall give rise to discrimina-
• liioG. in tho treatment of the people by their
/ijiovcrnmcnt
We view with prido and satisfaction this
' • Sfcright picture of our country's growth and
jajtospcrity , while only a closer scrutiny de-
relops a somber shading. Upon more carell
iVnl inspection we find tho wealth and luxury
-s < ijx ; > ar cities mingled with poverty and
vroJxIhedncss and unremuncrative toil. A
• crowded and constantly increasing urban
* ffC2 Hlation suggests the impoverishment of
-rtcral sections and discontent with agricult'
tterai pursuits. Tho farmer's son , not satisr
& & ! with his father's simple and laborious
Tfife , joins thoeager chase foreasily acquired

tW discover that the fortunes realized by
* smmanufacturers aro no longer solely tho
-Kxsrcxd of tudy , industry and enlightened
"Sfcredight , but they result from the discrimi-
rctjstiag favor of tho government , and are
tlSargely built upon undue exaction from the
* ac isses of tho people. The gulf between emc
grtoyers-and employed is constantly widenp
db ajid classes are rapidly forming , ono
cscmprlsing tho very rich and powerful while
< t5i the other are found the toiling poor.
We view the achievement of aggregated
• capital ; wo discover the existence of trusts ,
- -combinations and monopolies , while the citis
s. tea is struggling far in tho rear , or is tramtl

I crnment owes to tho humblest citizen in tho J I
land , makes tho boast of frco institutions a I I
glittering i delusion and tho pretended boon i i
of i American citizenship a aluimcless lmpcsl-
tion.
. A Just and scnslblo revision of our tariff
laws should bo made for tho relief of those
i' of our countrymen who suiter under pn-scnt
conditions. ' Such a revision should receive
tho support of all who lovo that Justice and
! equality duo to American citizenship ; of all
who realize that in this justice and equality
our ! government finds Its strength and its
power to protect the citizen and his property ;
of all who believe that tho contented com-
\ potencoand comfort of many accord better
with the spirit of our institutions than col- |
ossal ' fortunes gathered in tho handi of
a few ; of all who appreciate that tho for1
bcaranco , and fraternity amoncr our people
which rccognizo the value of every American
interest , aro tho surest quantity of our na-
tional progress , and of all who desiro to seo
tho products of American skill and ingenu-
ity ' in every market of tho world , with a re-
suiting ' restoration of American commerce.
Tho necessity of tho reduction of ourreve-
nuo ' is so apparent as to bo generally concedi
od. ! But the means by which this end shall
bo accomplished and tho sum of direct beneJ
fit which shall result to our citizens , present
a controversy of tho utmost importance.
There ; should be no scheme accepted as satis-
factory by which tho burdens of the pcoplo
aro only partly removed. Extravagant ani
propriations ' of public money with all their
J demoralizing consequences , should not bo
tolerated ] , either as a means of relieving tho
treasury ) of its surplus , or as furnishing pre-
texts for reaching a proper reduction in tariff
rates. Existing evils and injustice should
bo honestly recogni/.ed , boldly metandeffec-
tively \ remedied. There should bo no cessa-
tiqn J of tho struggle until a plan is perfected ,
fair and conservative toward existing indus-
tries , but which will reduce tho cost to conc
sumers of tho necessaries of life , while it
\ provido for our manufacturers the ad van-
tages of freo raw materials and permits no
J injury to tho interests of American labor.
Tho cause for which the battlo is waged is
comprised within lines clearly and distinctly
defined. It should never bo compromised.
It is tho people's cause. It cannot be denied
that tho selfish and private interests which
aro so persistently heard , when efforts aro
mado to deal in a just and comprehensive
manner with our tariff laws aro related to , if
they aro not responsible for , the sentiment
largely prevailing among the people that the
general government is tho foundation of in-
dividual and private aid ; that it may be ex-
pected to relieve with paternal caro the dis-
tress of citizens and communities , and that
from tho fullness of its treasury it should
upon tho slightest possible pretext of pro-
moting tho general good apply public funds
to the beneht of localities and individuals ,
nor can it be denied that there is a growing
assumption that as against tho government
J and ! in favor of private claims and interests ,
tho * usual rules and limitations of business
principles and justdealingshould bewaived.
These ideas have been unhappily much en-
couraged , by legislative acqueiscence. Re-
lief ' from contracts made with the govern-
ment is easily accorded in favor of the citi-
zens , as the failure to support claims against
the government by proof is often supplied by
no better consideration than the wealth of
tho government and the poverty of the
claimant Gratuities in form of pensions aro
granted upon no other real grounds than the
needy > condit ion of the applicant , or for rea
sons less valid : and large sums are expended
for public buildings and other improvements
upon representations scarcely claimed to be
related to public needs and necessities. Tho
extent to which the consideration of such
matters subordinate and postpone action up-
on subjects of great public importance , but
involving ' no special , private , or partisan in-
tcrcst ' should arrest attention and lead to
reformation.
A few of the numerous illustrations of this
condition may be stated. The crowded confl
dition of the calendar of the supreme court ,
and the delay to suitors and denial of justice
resulting there-from , has been strongly
urged upon the attention of the congress ,
with a plan for the relief of the situation ap-
proved by those well able to judge of its
merits. While this subject remains without
effective consideration , many laws have been
passed providing for the holding of terms of .
inferior courts at places to suit the con-
venience of localities or to lay the foundation
of an application for the erection of a new
public building. °
Repeated recommendations have been
submitted for the amendment and change of
the laws relating to our public lands , so that 7
their spoliation and diversion to other uses J"
than as homes for honest settlers might be
prevented. While a message to meet this ?
conceded necessity of reform remains await-
lng the action of the congress , many claims ?
to the public lands and applications for their
donation in favor of states and individuals 9
have been allowed.
A plan in aid of Indian management , re- "
commended , by those well informed , as con- .
taining valuable features in furtherance of "
the solution of the Indian problem , has thus 3
far failed of legislative sanction , while
grants of doubtful expediency to railroad C
corporations , permitting them to pass m
through Indian reservations , have greatly
multiplied. °
The propriety and necessity of the erecu
tion of one or more prisons for confinement .
of United States convicts and a postoffice P
building in the national capital are not dis-
puted , but these needs yet remain unanaJ
swered , while scores of public buildings
have been erected where their necessity for sc
public purposes is not apparent A revision
ofpur pension la > vs could easily be made j
which would rest 'upon ' fust principles and to
provide for every worthy applicant But
while our general pension laws remain con- ?
fused and hundreds of n
' imperfect , our private
pension laws are annually passed which are ai
the sources of unjust discrimination and of
popular demoralization. Appropriation bills ?
for the of the de- is
< support government are - J
faced ' by items and provisions to meet priJ J
vate ends , and it is freely asserted by re- J ?
sponsible ] and experienced parties that a bill "
appropriating money for internal improve-
ment would fail to meet with favor unless It J *
contained more for local and private advanP
tage than for public benefit These state- |
ments can be much emphasized by an ascer- ?
tainment of the proportion of federal legis- "
lation , which either bears upon its face its 2
private . character , or which , upon examinat
tion , develops such a motive power , and yet
the people wait and expect from their m
chosen representatives such patriotic ac-
tion as will advance the welfare of the en5
tire country ; and this expectation can only 8j
be answered by the performance of public aJ
duty with unselfish purposes. Our mission ri
among the nations of the earth , and our suefa
cess < in accomplishing the work God has y to
given the American people to do , require of
those intrusted with the making and cxecul
tions of our laws perfect devotion , above all if
other things , to the public good. This devoP
tion will lead us to strongly resist all imporDJ
tance of constitutional 1 imitations of the fed-
eral power , and to persistently check the inf
creasing tendency to extend the scope of P
federal legislation into the domain of state to
and local jurisdiction upon the plea ofsubs |
serving the public welfare. The preserva- "
tion of the partitions between proper subJ J
jects of federal and local care and regulation S
of such importance under the constitu- ?
tion , which is the law of our very existence , "J
thatno consideration of expediency or sentiJv
ment should tempt us to enter upon doubty y
ful ground. We have undertaken to - disSF
cover and proclaim the richest blessings of a ,
free governmentwith the constitution as [ ?
our guide. Let us follow the way it points °
out It will not mislead. And surely no ono ° 9
who has taken upon himself the solemn obll ° f
gation < to support and preserve the constituPJ
tion can find justification or solace for dis25
loyalty in the excuse that he wandered and lj
disobeyed : in search of a better way to reach
the public welfare than the constitution ? S
offers. : J"
What has been said is deemed not inapie
propriate at a time when , from a century's
height , we view tho way already trod by the
American people and attempt to discover
heir future paths. The seventh president of he
the United States the soldier ana statesman , sp
and at all times the firm and brave friend of su
the people in vindication of his course as je
the protector of the popular rights and tho co
champion of true American citizenship , dewi
clared : "Tho ambition which leads me on is
anxious demre and a fixed determination
restore to the people unimpaired the saon
cred trust they have confided to my charge ; he
to.heal the .wounds of tho .constitutioaand .fo
prevent violation ; to persuade my counsp
trymen , so far as I may , that it is not iu a In
splendid government supported by poweron
ful and aristocratic establishments , that ha
they will find happiness < rr their liberties ce
protected , but in a plain system , void of Cl
pomp protecting all and granting favors to tai
none , dispensing its blessings like the dew m <
heaven , unseen and unfelt , save in the Cl
freshness and beauty they contribute to proat
duce. It is such a government that the die
genius of our people requires such an ono du
only under which our states may remain Cl
ages to come united , prosperous and th :
free. " ch :
The State of tho Union. ivi
In pursuance of a constitutional provision m <
requiring the president from time to time to pe
give to the congress information of the state
the Union , 1 have tho satisfaction to an- ]
nounce that the close of the year finds the ha
United States in the enj ent of domestic tic
r
I
. . f
tranquility ' nnd at peaco with all tho nations ,
Sinco < my last annual message our foreign
relations i havo been strengthened and Im-
proved ] by the performance of international
good J ofllcos , and by new nnd renewed treatt
ies ; of amity , commerco and reciprocal extraJ
dition i of criminnls. Those international
questions which sail await settlement aro
all i reasonably within tho domain or arnicai
bio 1 negotiation , and there is no existing sub1
jeet i of dispute between tho United States
und i any foreign power that is not susceptible
of < satisfactory arrangement by frank diploi
matlc i treatment The questions between
Great < Britain and the United States , rolati
ing 1 to the rights of
AMEBICAX FIsnEUMBN
under i treaty and international comity In the
territorial 1 waters of Canada and Newfound-
land 1 , I regret to say aro not yet satisfactor-
ily i adjusted. Those matters wero fully
treated 1 in my message to tho senate of Febi
ntary J 20,18S8 , together with which a coni
vcntion , concluded under my authority with
her 1 majesty's government on the 10th of
February 1 last , for tho removal of all causes
of < misunderstanding , was submitted by mo
for i tho approval of the senate. This treaty
having 1 been rejected by the senate I trans
mitted a messago to the congress on the 23d
of August last reviewing tho transactions
and submitting for consideration certain
recommendations for legislation concerning
the 1 important questions involved. After-
wards , on the 12th of September , in responso
to 1 a resolution of tho senate , I again comi
municated , fully all the information in my
possession as to tho action of the govern-
ment of Canada , affecting tho commercial
relation between the Domiuion and the
United ' States , including tho treatment of
American fishing vessels on the ports and
waters of British America. The communi-
cations have all been published and therec
fore opened to the knowledge of both houses'
of congress , although two were addressed to
the senate alone. Comment upon , or repeti-
tion of their contents , would be superfluous ,
and I am not aware that anything has occ
curred which should bo added to the fact3
therein stated. Therefore , I merely repeat ,
as applicable to the present time , tho state
ment which will be found in my messago to
the senate of September 12 , last , "Thatsince
March 3,18S7 , no case has been reported in
the department of state , wherein complaint
has been made of unfriendly or unlawful
treatment of American fishing vessels on
the part of tho Canadian authorities , in
which reparation was not promptly and sati
isfactorily obtained by the United States
consul general at Halifax.
. Having essayed , in tho discharge ot my
duty , to procure by negotiation the settle
ment of a longstanding cause of dispute and
to remove a constant " menace to the good
relations of the two countries , and continuf
ing to the opinion that tho treaty of Februt
ary last , which failed to receive the approvg
al of the senate , did supply "a satisfactory
practical and final adjustment on a basis
honorable and just to both parties to the
difficult and vexed question to which it rei
lated , " and having subsequently and unavailt
ingly recommended other legislation to cont
gross , which I hoped would suffice to meet
the emergency created by the rejection of
the treaty , I now again invoke the earnest
and immediate attention of the congress to
tho r , condition of this important question as
it now stands before them and the country ,
and for the settlement of which I am deeply
solicitous.
THE SACKVILLE INCinENT.
. Near tho close of the month of October
last ! occurrences of a deeply regretable nar
ture were brought to my knowledge , which
made it my painful but imperative duty to
obtain , with as little delay as possible , a new
personal channel of diplomatic intercourse
in this country with the government of
> Great Britain. The correspondence in rec
lation \ to this incident will in due course be
laid before you , and will disclose tho unpar-
j
donable conduct of tho official referred to in
his interference , by advice and counsel , with
the suffrages of American citizens in the
very crisis of the presidential election then j
near at handand also In his subsequent pub-
lie declarations to justify his action , super-
adding impugnment of the execntive and
senate of the United States in connection
with important questions now pending in
controversy between the two governments.
The offense thus committed was most grave ,
involving disastrous possibilities to the
good relations of the United States and
Great Britain , constituting a gross breach of
diplomatic privilege , and an invasion of the
purely domestic affairs essential to the sov
ereignty ' of the government to which the en-
voy , was accredited. Having first fulfilled
the ! just demands of international comity by
affording full opportunity for her majesty's
' to act in relief of the situation ,
foverninent S
considered prolongation of discussion to be a
unwarranted , and there upon declined to
further , recognize the diplomatic character
of the person whose continuance in such S
function V would destroy that mutual confia
dence ! which is essential to the good under
standing of the two governments , and was
inconsistent } with the welfare and self-re
spect of the government of the United
States. The usual interchange of communir.
cation has since continued through her °
majesty's legation in this city. r
My endeavors to establish , by national co- J
operation l , measures for tho prevention of n
the extermination of [

being enabled shortly to submit an effective

The coast boundary between our Alaska Rj
possessions , and British Columbia , I regret
* say , has not received the attention de- °
manded by its importance and which on e-
several occasions heretofore I have had the
honor < to recommend to the congress. The ?
admitted . impractibility , if not impossibility , r §
' making an accurate and precise survey P'
and demarkation of the boundary line as ita
? recited in the treaty with Russia under 5
which Alaska was ceded to the United "
States , renders it absolutely requisite for j *
the prevention of international jurisdictional ?
complication that adequate appropriation "
for a reconnoisance and survey to obtain ; >
proper ] knowledge of the locality and the
geographical features in the boundary T
should be authorized by congress with as
little ' delay as possible. Knowledge to be *
Dnly thus obtained is an essential perquisite "
for negotiations for ascertaining a common $
boundary or as preliminary to any other
mode of settlement n
It is much to be desired that some agree- "
ment should be reached with her majesty's J
government , by which the damages to life i
and property on the Great Lakes may be "
alleviated by removing or humanely reguy
lating the obstacles to reciprocal assisstance ,
wrecked or stranded vessels. The act of "
June ! 19 , lSfl3 , which offers to Canadian ves-
sels free access to our inland waters in aid li
* wrecked or disabled vessals , has not yet 5j
become effective through concurrent action

The due protection of our citizens of
French origin or descent from claim of mili5

last session. In the absence of conventional j ,
agreement as to naturalization , which is i
greatly to be desired , this government sees *
' occasion to recede from the sound posiS
tion it has maintained , not only with regard "
France , but as to all countries with
which the United States have not concluded ?
special treaties. "J
Twice within the last year has the inper- ?

I announce with sincere regret that Hayti ; d
again become tho theater of insurreo la
ion , disorder and bloodshed. The titular th
r
•
t
government of President Salomon has '
been ] forcibly overthrown aud he driven
out of tho country of France , where ho has
since died. Tho tenure of power has been
so unstable amid tho war of fuel ions that
has J ensued sinco the expuls'oii ot President
Saioraan that no govcmimnt constituted
"by the will of tho Haytien people" has
been i recognized as administering respousi-
bly 1 tho affairs of the country. Our reprei
sentativo has been instructed to abstain
from l interference between tho warring
factions i , and a vessel of our navy has been
sent to Hayttcn waters to sustain our
minister and for the protection of persons
and property of Americau citizens. Duo pre-
cautions have been taken to enforce our
neutrality laws and prevent our territory
from 1 becoming tho base of military supplies
for i either of the warring factions. Under
color of a blockade , of which no reasonable
notice had been given , and which does not
appear to havo boon officially maintained , a
seizure of vessels under tho American flag
has 1 beon reported , and , in consequence ,
measures to prevent and redress any mo-
testation 1 of our innocent merchantmen have
been 1 adopted.
MEXICO.
Tho wisdom of concluding a treaty of com-
mercial reciprocity with Mexico has been
heretofore 1 stated in my messages to con-
gross , and the lapse of time and the growth
of commerce with that close neighbor and
sister republic confirm tho judgment so ex
pressed. The precise location of our bound
ary line is needful , and adequate appro
priation ] is now recommended. It is with
sincere satisfaction that I am enabled to ud1
vert to tho spirit of good neighborhood and
friendly co-operation and conciliation that
has 1 marked the correspondence and action
of the Mexican authorities in their share of
of the task of maintaining law and order
about the line of our common boundary.
THE EMPIRE OF RRVZU ,
in i abolishing the last vestige of slavery
among Christian nations , called forth the
earnest congratulations of thib government
in i expression of the cordial sympathies of
our people.
Tho claims of nearly all othor countries
against
cim.r , *
growing out of her war with Bolivia and
Perue , have been disposed of , cither by ari
bitration 1 or by a lump settlement Similar
claims of our citizens will continue to bo
urged upon the Chilian government , and it
is i hoped will not be subject to further de-
lays.
Tho Naturalization Lairs.
With the rapid increase of immigration to
our shores and the facilities of modern
travel , abuses of the generous privileges af-
forded by our naturalization laws call for
their careful revision. The easy and uni
guarded manner in which certificates of
American citizenship can now bo obtained
has 1 induced a class , unfortunately large , to
avail themselves of the opportunity to bec
come absolved from allegiance to their nac
tive land , and yet by a foreign residence to
escape any just duty and contribution of
service to the country of their proposed
adoption. Thus , while evading the duties
of citizenship to the United States they
may make prompt claims for its national
protection , and demand its intervention in
their behalf. International complications
of a serious nature arise , and the corre-
spondence of the state department discloses
the great number and complexitv of the
questions which have been raised. Our laws
regulating the issue of passports should be
carefully revised and the institution of a
central bureau of registration at the capital ,
is again strongly recommended. By this
means full particulars of each case of natura
alizalion in tho United States would be seV
cured and properly indexed and recorded ,
and thus many eases of spurious citizenship
would be detected , and unjust responsibili-
ties would be avoided.
The reorganization of
THE CON'SULAR SERVICE
is a matter of serious importance to our na
tional interests. The number of existing
principal consular offices is believed to bo
greater than is at all necessary for tho conii
duct of the public business. It need not be
our policy to maintain more than a moderate
number of principal offices , each supported
by a salary sufficient to enable the incums
bent to be comfortable , and so distributed
as to assure the convenient supervision ,
through | subordinate agencies.of affairs over
a considerable district.
I repeat the recommendations , heretofore
made by me , that the appropriation for the
maintenance of our diplomatic and consular
service should be recast ; that the so-called
notarial or unofficial fees which our repreg
sentatives ( abroad are now permitted to treat
as personal perquisites should be forbidden ; e
that a system of consular Inspection should o
be instituted and that a limited number of
secretaries ( of legation at large should be
authorized. h

The Treasury. t
The report of the secretary of the treasd
ury . exhibits in detail the condition of our 3
national finances and the operations of the tl
several ! branches of the government related ei
to his department. The total ordinary reve
nues of the government for the fiscal year
ended . June 30,1SS0 , amounted to $379,260-
074.76 ' , of which § 219,091,173 63 was received
from customs duties and 1424,290,871.98 from °
internal taxes. z.
The total receipts from all sources , exP.
ceeded those for the fiscal year ended June jj'
30 , 1SS7 , by S7S6,279,710. The ordinary ex- j"
penditures of the fiscal year ending June 30 , {
1SS8 ; , were S2. )9,653,93S.07 , leaving a surplus 1
of § 119,012,117.09. The decrease in these
expenditures , as compared with the fiscal j ;
year ' ended June 30 , 1SS7 , was 5327,822,131 , S
notwithstanding J the payment of more than
5,000,000 for pensions in excess of what was „
paid ; ' for that purpose in the latter mentioned
year. The revenues of the government for -
the : year ending June 30 , 1SS9 , ascertained -p
for the quarter ended September 30 , 18SS ,
and estimated for the remainder of the time ,
amount . to $377,000,000 , and the actual and es
timated ordinary expenditures for the same bi
year are $273,000,0X ( ) , leaving an estimated fi
surplus of $104,000,000. Ji
The estimated receipts for the year ending "
June 30,1S90 , are § 377,000,000 and the estimc
ated . ' ordinary expenditures for the same P
time . are $27. 5,767,4S8.34 , showing a surplus of e
$101,232,511.00. The foregoing statements of
surplus do not take into account the sum nr
necessary to be expended to meet the re- 1-
qulrements ' of the sinking iund act amount
ing to more than $47,000,000 annually. The
cost of collecting the customs revenues for di
the last fiscal year was 2.44 per cent ; for the PJ
year 18S5 it was 3.77 per cent. 0C
The excess of internal revenue taxes col
lected during the last fiscal year over these
collected J for the year ended June 30,1SS7 , ai
was $5,4S9,174.26 , and the cost ol collecting r
this revenue-decreased from 3.4 per cent in P
1S87 , to less than 3.2 per cent for the last ti
year. The tax on oleomargarine was $723 , - tl
948.04 j for the year ending June 30,1SS7 , and PJ
S64,139.88 for the following year. a1
The requirements of the sinking fund act ra
havp been met for the year ended June 30 ,
18SS , and for the current year also , by the di
purchase of bonds. After complying with 9
this law , as positively required , and suf- *
ficient for that purpose had been bought at a Dj
premium , it was not deemed prudent to furol
ther expend the surplus in such purchases cl
until the authority to do so should be made e
explicit. A resolution , however , having 1E
been passed by both houses of congress re
moving all doubt as to executive authority ,
dailv purchases of bonds were commenced P"
the 23d day of April , 1SSS , and have conm
tinued until the present time , and by this u
Elan bonds of the gov ernment not yet due of
; ave been purchased up to and including the ei
30th day of November , 18SS , amounting to tl
S94,700,400 , the jncmium paid thereon J °
amounting to $17,508,013.03. The premium tl
added to the principal of these bonds reprem
sents an investment yielding about 2 per ai
cent interest for the time they have to run ,
and the saving to the froverninent , repre
sented by the difference between the amount
interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid ju
for principal and premium and what would ai
have been paid for interest at the rate specig <
tied in the bonds , if they had run to their re
maturity , is about $27U'o,000. . At first sight et
this would . = eem to be a profitable and sensito
Ble transaction on the part of the govern
ment , but , ' as suggested by the secretary of m
the treasury , the surulus thus expended for w
the purchase of bends was money drawn di
from the people in excess of any actual need cc
the government , and was so expended , pc
rather than allow it to remain in the treasai
ury. If this surplus , under the operation of th
just and equitable laws , had been left in the fa
hands of the people , it would have been tii
worth , in their business , at least , 0 per cent dt
per annum. in
Deducting from the amount of interest
upon the principal and premium of these
bonds for the time they had to run at G per th
cent tho saving of 2 per cent made for the bi
people by the purchase of such bonds , the ai
loss will appear to be $5T .7ijO,0OJ. This calpi
sulation would seem to demonstrate that if ti <
2xces"tfve nnd unnecessary taxatiou is conne
tinued and the government is forced to purth
3UO tho policy of purchasing its own bonds ed
the premiums wluch it will bo necessary ti <
pay , Jhe loss to the people will be bunop
Jreds of millons of dollars. Since the purm
jhase of bonds was undertaken , as mentionar
, nearly all that havo been offered were at
tustaeOep'ed. It has been quite apparent th :
that the government was in danger of being th ;
I subjected i to combinations to raise their
price ] , appears by tho instance cited by tho
secretary i of lb * offering of bonds of tho par
valuo o' " ' ' 20,000 so often that the aggro-
gat | ; - mrs sums demanded for their pur
chase i amounted to more than 810,700,000.
THE SURPLUS.
Notwithstanding tho sums paid out In tho
purchase 1 of bonds , tho surplus In tho treas
ury i on tho 30th day of November , 1888 , was
$52,234,010,01 after deducting about $20,000-
000 ( just drawn out for tho payment of pen
sions. i
SILVER COIXAOE.
At tho close of tho fiscal year ended Juno
30,18S7 , there had been coined under the
compulsory j silver coinage act , $2yO,9SS,280
in j silver dollars , $55,504,310 of which were
in j the hands of tho people on the 30th day of
June.lSSS. There had been coined $299,703-
790 ; , and of this $55,829,304 was in circulation
in J coin and $200 337,370 in silver certificates ,
for j tho redemption of which silver dollars tc
that 1 amount were hold by the government
On < the 30th day of November , lb88 , $312,570-
990 had been coined ; $00,970,990 of tho silver
dollars were actually in circulation and $237-
418,3-10 in certificates. Tho secretary recom
mends i tho suspension of tho further coinago
of silver dollars , and in such recommenda
j tion I earnestly concur. For further valua
ble ' information and timely recommenda
tions 1 , I ask the careful attention of the con
gress { to the secretary's report.
Tho War Department.
The secretary of war reports that tho
army , at the date of the last consolidated re
turns 1 , consisted of 2,169 officers and 24,549
enlisted men. The actual expenditures of
the t war department for the fiscal year ended
Juno 30,1SSS , amounted to $41,105,107.07 , of
which \ sum $9,15S,514.C3 was expended for
public j works , including river and harbor
improvements.
Tho board of ordnanco and fortifications
provided for under tho act approved Sep
tember 22 , last , was convened October 30 ,
1SS8 1 , and plans and specifications for pro
curing forging for eight , ten and twelve-
inch i guns , under provision of section 4. and
also for procuring twelve-inch breech load
ing i mortars , cast iron , hooped with steel ,
under the provisions of section 5 of tho said
act , were submitted to the secretary of war
for reference to the board by the ordnance
department of the same date. These plans
and specifications having been promptly
approved by tho board of the secretary of
war , the necessary authority to publish ad
vertisements inviting proposals in the news
papers tin oughout the country was granted
by the secretary on November 12 , and on
November 13 the advertisements were sent
out to the different newspapers designated ,
Tho bids for the steel forgings are to be
opened on December 20 , 1888 , and for the
mortars on December 15,188S.
THE EXAMINATION' OF OFFICERS.
I earnestly request that the recommenda-
tions contained in the secretary's report , all
of which arc , in my opinion.calculated to in-
crease the usefulness and discipline of tho
army , may receive tho consideration of the
eongrcss. Among these the proposal that
there should be provided a plan for the ex1
amination of the officers to test their fitness
for promotion is of the utmost importance ,
This reform has been before recommended
in the reports of the secretary , and its expo-
diency is so fully demonstrated by tho argu-
ment > ho presents in its favor that its adopj
tion should no longer be neglected.
. THE DEATn OF GENERAL SHEKIDAS
in ] August last was a national affliction. Tho
army then lost the grandest of its chiefs.
The country lost a bravo and experienced
soldier , a wise and discreet counselor , and a
modest and sensible man. Thoso who in
any manner came within the range of his
personal association , will never fail to pay
deserved and willing homage to his greatt
ness and the glory of his career , but they
will cherish with more tender sensibility
the loving memory of his simple , generous
and considerate nature.
Tho Navy.
The report of the secretary of tho navy
demonstrates very intelligent management
in that important department and discloses
the most satisfactory progress in the work
of reconstructing the navy made during the
past year. Of the ships in course of con-
struction , five , viz. , the Charleston , Balti-
more , Yorktown , Vesuvius and Petrel , have
in that time been launched aud are rapidly
approaching completion. And in addition to
the above tho Philadelphiat the San FranS
Cisco : , the Newark , the Bennington , the Con-
cord and the Herreshoff , torpedo boats aie
all under contract for delivery to the de-
partment during the next year. The pro-
grcs" ; already made , and being made , gives
good ground for the expectation that these
eleven ; vessels will bo incorporated as part
of the American navy within the next
twelve months.
The reports show that notwithstanding the
large expenditures for new construction ,
and the additional labor they involve , the
total ordinary or current expenditures of tho
department for the three years ending June J
30,1SSS ( , are less by more than 20 per cent
than such expenditures for the three years
ending June 30,1SS4.
Tho Postal Department.
, The report of the postmaster general
shows J a marked increase of business in
every branch of the postal service. The
. .
number . of postoffices on July 1 , 18SS , w v > s
57,376 , an increase of 6,124 in three yean ,
and of 2,219 for the last fiscal year. The
latter mentioned increase is classified as •
follows :
;
New England states 5 d
Middle states 181 t

FREE DELIVERY OFFICES °
have increased from 189 in the fiscal year S
ended June 30,1SS7 , to 35S in the year ended JJ
June 30,1SSS. In the railway mail service "
there has been an increase in one year of 16S n
routes , and in the number of miles traveled
per < annum an increase of 150,795,917.48. The
estimated increase of railroad service for n
the year was 6,000 miles , but tho amount of If
new ( railroad service actually put on was gi
12,704.50 miles. pi
MOSET ORDERS- ir
The volume of business in the money orcl
der division , including transactions in postal al
notes , reached the sum of upwards of $143O
000,000 for the year. o1
FOURTH-CLASS POSTMASTERS.J J tl
Of the total number of postmasters , 54S76 ai
are of the fourth-class. These , of course , d
receive no allowances , whatever , for exp
penses in the service , and their compensa- $
tion is fixed by percentages on receipts at pi
their respective offices. This rate of comsi
pensation may have been , and probably was , yi
some time , just , but the standard has retl
mained unchanged through the several reb
ductions i in the rates of postage. Such rem
auctions have necessarily cut down the $
compensation of these officials , while it unir
doubtedly increased the business performed e
by them. Simple justice requires a mention yi
this subject , to the end that the fourth-
class postmasters may receive at least an al
equivalent to that which the law itself , fixe
ing the rate intended for them. oi
THE COST OF SERVICE. fz
It is gratifying to note from the carefully pi
prepared statistics [ accompanying the postei
mastergeneral's report thatnotwithstanding g
the great expansion of the service , the rata si
expenditure has been lessened and efficij j in
ency has been improved in every branch ;
that fraud and crime have decreased ; that ir
t
losses from the mails have been reducedand va
that : the number of complaints of tho service oi
made to postmasters and to tho department
are far less than ever before. la

The Department of Justice. T
The transactions of the department of gi
justice for the fiscal year ended June 30,1SSS , ni
are contained in the report of the attorney b
general , as well as a number of valuable as
recommendations , the most of which are repu
etitions of those previously made , and ought bl
receive consideration. of
It is stated in this report that though judggi
ments in civil suits amounting to $552,021.03 pi
were recovered in favor of the government cc
luring the year , only the sum of $132,934 was v <
collected thereon ; and that though fines , bi
penalties and forfeitures were imposed cl
amounting-to$541S0S.43 , only § 109,648.42 of is
that sum was paid on account thereof. These fa
facts may furnish an illustration of the senze
timent which extensively prevails , that a w
iebt due to the government should cause no
inconvenience to the citizen.
POLTGAMV.
It also appears from this report that
though prior to March , 1SS5 , there had been w
but six convictions in the territories of Utah ef
and Idaho under the laws of 1SG2 and 1SS2 , re
' and unlawful cohabitahi

Tho Interior.
I cannot too strenuously insist on tho im-
portanco of propor measures to insure a
right disposition of our public lands , not otr
ly as a matter of presont Justice , but in fore-
cast of tho consequence to future genera
tions. Tho broad , rich acrc3 of our ugricul-
teral plains havo been long preserved by nai
ture to becomo her untrammeled gift to a
pcoplo civilircd and freo upon which should
rest , in well distributed ownership , tho num-
erous homes of enlightened , equal and
fraternal citizens. We camo to national posi
session witii tho warning example iu our
eyes of tho entail of inequities of land proi
priotorships which other countries havo peri
mittcd and still suffer. We have no excu30
for tho violation of principles , cogently
taught by reason and example , nor for tho
allowanco of pretexts .which have somei
times exposed our land to colossal greed.
Laws which open a door to f radulcnt acquis-
itionor administration ; which permit favor
to rapacious seizure by a fovored few of ex.
panded areas that many should enjoy are ac-
cessory to offenses against our national wcli
fare and hunvinity , not to he too severely
condemned or punished.
It is gratifying to know that something
has been done at last to redress the injuries
to our people and check the perilous tendency
of the reckless waste of national domain.
That over 8OCO0OC0 acres have been wrested
from illegal usurpation , improvident grants
and fraudulent entries and claims to bo takc
en for the homesteads of honest industry
although less than tho greater areas thus
unjustly lost must afford a profound gratlt
fication to right feeling citizens , as it is a
recompense for tho labors and struggles of
the recovery.
Our dear experience ought sufficiently to
urge the speedy enactment of measures of
legislation which will confluo tho future
disposition i of our remaining agricultural
lands to the use of actual husbandry and
genuine ; homes. Nor should our vast tracts
of i so-called desert lands bo yielded up to
tho monopoly of corporations or grasjiing
individuals , as appears to be much tho tena
dency < under the existing statute. Tho lands
require but tho supply of water to becomo
fertile and productive. It is a problem of
great j moment how moro wisely for tho pubt
lie ] good that factor shall bo furnislicd. I
cannot i but think it perilousto suffer either
those 1 lands or the sources of their irrigation
I to fall into tho hands of monopolies of which
by 1 such mean ? may exercise lordship over
areas j dependent on their treatment for proh
ductivencss. < Already steps have been
taken i to secure accurate and scientific infora
mation i of tho conditions which is tho primo
basis 1 of intelligent action. Until this shall
be 1 gained the course of wisdom appears
clearly to be in the suspension of further
disposal , which only promises to crcato
rights antagonistic to the common interest
No ] harm can fo.low this cautionary conduct ,
The land will remain and the public good
presents j no demand for hasty dispossession
of national ownership and control.
THE IXDIAXS.
The condition of our Indian population
continues to improve , and the proofs multia
ply that the transforming change so much to
be 1 desired , which shall substitute for barf
barism enlightment and civilizing education ,
is i in fair progress. Our relations with theso
people during tho year have been * disturbed
by t no serious disorders , but rather marked
by a better realization of their true interests
and increasing confidence and good will ,
These conditions testify to tho value of tho
1T higher tone of consideration and humanity
which has governed the latter methods of
dealing with them , and commends its congi
tinued observance. Allotments in severalty
have been made on some reservations until
all those entitled to land thereon have had
their shares assigned , and the work is still
continued. In directing the execution of this
duty J : I have not aimed so much at rapid dis
patch as to slow , just and fair arrangements
which shall best conduce to the objects of
the law by producing satisfaction with tho
results of the allotments made. No measure
of general effect has ever been entered on 3
from which more may be fairly hoped , if it
shall be discreetly administered. It profsi
fers opportunity and inducement to that in-
dependence of spirit and life which the
Indian peculiarly needs while at the same
time the inalienability of title affords securta
ity J against the risks his inexperience of n
affairs or weakness of character may expose di
him to in dealing with others. Whenever tl
begun upon any reservation it should bo al
made complete so that all are brought to thec
same condition and as soon as possible , m
Community in lands should cease by oj enw
ing such as remain unallotted to settlement ii'
Contact with the ways of industrious and ai
successfdl farmers will perhaps add a m
healthy emulation which will both instruct 'a
and stimulate. But no agency for tho * ' >
amelioration of this people appears to me so io
promising as the extension urged by tho *
secretary of such complete facilities of eduF
cation as shall at the earliest possible day Lo
embrace all teachable Indian youths of both fo
sexes and retain them with a kindly and
beneficient hand until their characters aro :
formed and their faculties trained to tho
sure pursuits of some form of useful indusV
try. Capacity of the Indian no longer needs ?
demonstration. It is established. It remains
to < make the most of it and when that shall w
be done the curse will be lifted. e
INDIAN SCHOOLS. U
The average attendance of the Indian jO
pupils on the schools increased by over 900 fe
during the year , and the total enrollment
reached < 15,212. The cost of maintenance was Dr
not materially raised. The number of teach3f
able Indian youth is now estimated at 40,000 , fc
or nearly three times the enrollment of the an
schools. ( It is believed the obstacles in tho re
way of instructing are all surmountable , and Jpj
that the necessary expenditure would be a JC
measure of economy. do
pensions. • e
The number of pensioners added to the Jr
rolls the fiscal ended ' DS
during year June 'M ,
18S8 , is 60,252 , and increase of pensions was
granted in 45,716 cases. The names of 15.730
pensioners were dropped from the rolls dur
ing the year for various causes , and at the
close of the year the number of persons of
all classes receiving pensions was 452,557.
Of these , there were 812 survivors of the war gc
1812,10,787 widows of those who served in _ :
that war ; 16.000 soldiers of the Mexican war ,
and 5,104 widows of said soldiers. One hunpr
dred : and two different rates of pensions aro ga
paid ; to these beneficiaries , ranging from $2 to
$416.66 per month. The amount paid for or
pensions during the fiscal year was tS,775nc
551.92 , being an increase over the preceding m
yearof$5,30S,2S0.22. The expenses attending 5-
the maintenance and operation of the pension JJ
bureau : during that period was $3,202,524.67 , th
making the entire expenditures of th e bureau ch
S2,03S,3S6.27 , being 21J per cent of the gros3 jg
Income and nearly 31 per cent of the total .
expenditures of the government during the l"
year. ° 1'
I am thoroughly convinced that our generth
] pension laws should be revised and adjust0f
( to meet as far as possible in the light of nj
our experience all meritorious cases. Tho \ )
fact that 102 different rates of pensions are iei
paid , cannotin my opinion , be made consistwi
ent with justice to the pensioners or to the go .

The department of agriculture has contin- "
lied with a good measure of success in it3 tj
sfforts to develop the processes , enlarge tho ,

practical information , introduced and tested sin
new plants , checked the spread of contagnol
farm ' mals. resisted the

THE SDOAR IXDUSTKT.
During tho past four years tho process of
diffusion , as npplicd to tho manufacture of
sugar from sorghum nnd sugar cane , lins
been introduced into this country and fully
perfected I by tho experiments carried on by
tho department of agriculture. This process '
is i now universally considered to bo the most '
economical one , aud it is through it that tho j
sorghum sugar industry has been establish
ed upon a firm basis and the road to its fu- '
ture success opened. Tho adoption of this i
diffusion process is also cxtonding iu Louis
iana i and other sugar producing parts of tho J :
country , und will dougbtless bo tho only •
method employed for tho extraction of sugar j
from the cane. An exhaustive study has .
also , within tho same period , been under
taken of tho subject of food adulteration )
and tho best analytical methods for detecting j
it. i A part of tho results of this work has
already been published by tho department , '
which , with the matter in course of prepar
ation , will make the most complcto treatise
on that subject that ever has been published

THE RAILROADS.
Tho adjustment of tho relations between "
tho government and the railroad companies j !
which have received land grants and tho
guaranty of the public credit in aid of tho 'l
construction of their roads , should rcccivo
early attention. Tho report of a majority of .
the commisbioiiers appointed to examine tho |
affairs aud indebtedness of theso roads , in
which they favor an extension of tho timo '
for the payment of such indebtedness. In ,
at least one case where the corporation ap- J
pears to bo able to comply with well-guarded J
and exact terms of such extension and tho , '
reinforcement < of that opinion by gentlemen i
of undoubted business judgment and experi
ence appointed to protect the interests of tho .
government as directors of said corporation , '
may well lead to the belief that such an ex- !
tension would be to the advantage of tho !
government Tho subject would be treated <
as : a business proposition , with a view to a '
final realization of its indebtedness by tho , i
government rather than as a question to bo
decided upon prejudice , or by way of punish- |
ment for previous wrong doing. ;

Good Talkers.
Over and over again we are told that
jood talkers are scarce in American so- '
siety , especially among1 women. It is
jroverbial that men who enjoy conver- ;
jation with ideas in it
prefer to talk to j
ne another. It is humiliating to ,
lotice how they drop the themes they
prefer in their .own chat for small gos-
iip when they addressed themselves to
he ladies of society. However , a great
mange is in progress in this respect. It '
. no longer considered out of character
or ladies to discuss psychlogy , pom-
ilogy ' , the tides or the tariff. It is said
hat a man best enjoys the conversation
a woman who is a good listener , sup-
lementing his thoughts rather than
eading off with ideas of her own. One
vriter beseeches women to avoid , in
.onversing , the three D's dress , do-
nestics and diseases. Experts will t
ometimes adroitly turn the drift of
onversation into channels where they
ire most learned and can appear at
heir best , but it requires skill to do
his gracefully. Small talk has been aptly
lefined as "a conversation created ap-
opos the moment with no ulterior mo-
ive than that of being agreeable. * ' A
deasantly modulated voice and well
hosen words are two great requisites
good talkers , and these may be culti-
ated by any one anxiou3 to improve
nd excel. To learn to think and store
< mind with things worth telling , t
han learn to tell them in an entertain-
manner , are two fundamental rules
be observed. "You cannot draw
rater out of an empty well ! " Frank-
ess , sincerity , cherfulnes3 and
ood sense are necessary qulifications ; t '
' really , a study to become a good con- r •
ersationalist involves improvement of
