The official canvassing board did
not convene today. Tomorrow it will
resume and take up the larger differ
ences that have arisen during the pro
gress of the count. ' Although no of
ficial programme has been laid out it
is understood that the case of O. L.
Owen, Democratic candidate for cor
poration commissioner, will be taken
up first. H. L. Patton and H. D. Ter
rel, attorneys of Clovis will argue the
case for Mr. Owen.
An error in the prjj"! of the name
in Luna and McKiKy counties is re
sponsible for the apparent defeat of
Mr. Owen. The board is asked not to
count the 800 votes for "Sol' Owen as
having been ca-t for O. L. Owen, al
though that gentleman contends that
they should be counted for him, as
the intent of the voters is undisputed
The dispute over the returns from
Melrose precinct, Curry county, and
Carthage, Reserve and Gila precincts.
Socorro county, will also be argued. ,..
Another matter that will come be
fore the board tomorrow afternoon is
the argument for and against accept
ing Clayton precinct returns of Union
county, without the signature of the
Judges of the election who declare
they will not sign because" of certain
irregularities at the polls.
There are many other irregularities
of lesser consequence to straighten
out end minor differences to be ad
justed. It is believed, however, that
the board will have its report ready to
forward to Washington by Saturday
and that the approval of the president
will be received before the first of
the year.

Washington, D. C, Dec. 18. With
the definite, though un-official state
ment that President Taft formally had
notified Russia that the treaty of 1832
with that country would be abrogated
within the next two or three days, the
Senate committee on foreign relations
today considered what form the abro
gation should take.
Will Turn Down House.
Two propositions were laid before
the committee. The first was that
the President should officially proclaim
the abrogation with ratification of his
action by the Senate. The second was
that the abrogation should be ordered
iu a joint resolution as proposed by
the House. There was no though.
however, of adopting the language of
the House document.
In Executive Session.
Most members of the committee, in
clined to the belief that the President
should act with the Senate alone and
without regard to the House. The
committee also discussed at length
the question as to whether the abro
gation of the treaty should be consid
ered in open session of the Senate, as
it was In the House, or whether the
discussion should be in executive ses
sion. Until this question was set
tled, it was declared, no official state
ment would be made as to the message
of the President on the subject of
abrogation.
Lodge Drafts Resolution.,
A resolution satisfactory to the ad
ministration is said to have been
framed by Senator Lodge of Massa
chusetts. This draft would briefly
and simply declare the treaty abrogat
ed on the ground that it had become
obsolete.
In a letter to the foreign -relations
committee, and in a message to the
Senate, President Taft today stated
that he served notice on Russia of
the abrogation of the treaty on Decem
ber 15, last Friday.
Russia Makes No Complaint.
: Secretary of State Knox declared to
day that there had been B great deal
of misapprehension about the attitude
of Russia In the recent negotiations.
He asserted anew that Russia had
not protested to the United States
against the abrogation of the treaty
nor against the language of the Sulzer
resolution. The secretary said that
neither formally nor informally had
Russia entered any sort of complaint.
It was intimated early this after
noon" that later in the day correspond
ence might be made public which
would clear the air materially.
House Resolution in Modified Form.
The Senate committee on foreign re
lations decided to report to the Sen
ate the House resolution, in modified
form, fdr the abrogation of the Rus
sian treaty. This means that the
House would be included in the action
of abrogation.

(By Special Leased Wire to New Mexican)
San Francisco, Calif., Dec. 18. A
cablegram received here today re
ports that Dr. Sun Yat Sen ha. been
elected president of the new Chinese
republic by the revolutionary conven
tion sitting at Nanking.
Peace Conference Convenes.
Shanghai, Dec. 18. The peace con
ference between Wu Ting Fang, the
foreign secretary in the revolutionary
cabinet, the Tang Shao Yai, represent
ing Premier Yuan Shai Kai, and five
delegates selected by each side, op
ened in the town hall here at 2:30
this afternoon.
The delegates were welcomed by
the chairman of the municipal coun
cil, after which they immediately pro
ceeded to business. All except the
delegates were excluded from the
building, which was guarded by the
British police. The public is not even
allowed on the same side of the street.
One of the notable facts in connec
tion with the conference is that both
of the principal personages are na
tives of Canton and old friends. On
their first entrance into the room the
greeting of the delegates was mo-it
friendly.
Significant Declaration.
Tang Shao Yi, said he does not rep
resent the throne but is a personal
representative of Premier Yuan Shi
Kai. This declaration may be regard
ed as significant.
Both Wu Ting Fang and Tang Shao
Yl privately expressed the hope that
some agreement might be reached as
a result of the discussion.
Amos P. Wilder, United States con
sul general here, formally called on
Tang Shao Yi and talked with him on
subjects of general interest without
touching on the subject ot the revolu
tion. Threats of Assassination.
The strictest precautions have been
taken for the protection of Tang Shao
Yi. as an intimation has reached the
police that some among the more hot
headed students have been advocating
his assassination on the. ground that
he is supporting the Manchus.
Does Not Believe in Republic.
There is reason to believe that this
idea is absolutely without foundation.

St. Louis, Dec. 18. Leaders of the
few unions of railroad workers are
scheduled to meet here tonight to dis
cuss the advisability of calling a
strike on western railroads in sympa
thy with the strike of the shopmen

tral and Harriman roads.
All Men to Be Called Out.
J. W. Kline, president of the Inter
national Brotherhood of Blacksmiths
and Helpers, arrived here this morn
ing. He i3 to meet the union officials
of the western roads. Secrecy is
maintained as to where the meeting
will be held, and union workers on
every road in the jurisdiction of the
general managers association of the
veslern and southern railroads will be
called out if the present plans of
Kline are realized. He is quoted as
saying that the men are going to win
the strike on the Harriman and Illi
nois Central roads if he and his co-
leaders have to call out all the men
of their unions. Kline charges that
other roads have been lending en
gines and cars to the lines now effect
