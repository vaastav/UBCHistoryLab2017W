HOUSE RECEIVES
NEW RATE SILL
Etch-Townsend Measure Is Remodeled
and Reintroduced.
Special Correspondence.
Washington, Dec. 7.— The Esch
Townsend railroad rate bill, which
passed the house at Its last session,
has been redrawn and was reintro
duced in the house yesterday by Mr
Townsend. The bill embraces all of
the features of the former measure, but
is drawn so as to specify the things
which may be done by the Interstate
commerce commission.
In addition, it has a publicity fea
ture, and gives the commission juris
diction over refrigeration and terminal
charges. It also directly prohibits the
carrier from granting any shipper the
privilege of colecting his product, and
then getting a special rate under the
short term provision for changing
rates. As explained today by Mr.
Townsend the bill "expresses the ideas
fft the president in his message and
will, if enacted into law, amend the
Interstate commerce law so as to make
it more effectual in securing exact jus
tice between the carriers, shippers,
producers and consumers.
Affair in Isle of Pines.
The Isle of Pines trouble and the
resignation of the Cuban minister, Mr.
Squires, directly on account of that
trouble, has occupied more attention
than the matter really is worth. No
body denies that Minister Squires was
an energetic and valuable public ser
vant, but the fact that hb made him
self obnoxious to Cuba was enough to
warrant that country in asking for his
recall. He had clashed with the Cuban
administration over a number of
things, the sanitation of the island,
which was of course his business, and
alleged offensive partisanship in poli
tics which was none of his business.
Then there came up the Anglo-Cuban
treaty which was directly opposed to
the interests of America. Mr. Squires
fought that perhaps not too wisely but
too well and strained relations with the
Cuban government almost to the
breaking point. When he undertook to
side with the Americans who wanted
to establish a territorial form of gov
ernment under the American flag in
the Isle of Pines, he did a thing that
perhaps had the sympathy of the ma
jority of Americans but which was di
rectly opposed to the policy of the state
department and Mr. Root called him
sharply to terms. Mr. Squires sent in
his resignation by cable and it was ac
cepted the same way.
Korea Will Protest in Vain.
The next minister to Cuba, Edwin V.
Morgan, will not go to a very easy post,
but he will get out of a lot of trouble

in Korea. That country is protesting
strongly against the powers breaking
off diplomatic relations with her be
cause the Japanese protectorate has
made the presence of special diplomatic
representatives there no longer neces
sary. Minister Min of Korea is now
on his way to Washington to make an
appeal to President Roosevelt, but it is
believed that the journey will be fruit
less. This country was the leader in
the peace negotiations between Japan
and Russia and it was properly the
first to sever diplomatic relations with
Korea when that country was taken
over by Japan. This action on the part
of Japan while it is quite natural under
the circumstances, does not quite
square with her declaration that the
war was not for purposes of territorial
aggrandizement. It is one of those
International complications that all the
powers were obliged to agree to as a
lesser evil than allowing the war to run
on. Everybody will be sorry for Korea
in a -way, but It is likely that Minister
Min had just as well save the travel
ing expenses that his journey to Wash
ington will entail.
Tariff War With Germany.
The announcement that Germany
had formally denounced the trade
agreement under which she lias been
operating with the United States for
the past five years, is no surprise. This
country had known Germany's inten
tion for about a year and the senate
had let the reciprocity treaties pre
sented to go by the board rather than
stir itself to tariff revision. The Ger
man tariff treaty could have been de
nounced at any time on the giving of
three months notice by either party.
But the present crisis has been brought
about by new treaties which Germany
has negotiated with Austria Hungary,
Switzerland, Belgium, Romania. Italy.
Russia and Servia. They will all go
into effect on the first of next March
and under them the American treaty
by which we enjoyed the most favored
nation treatment with Germany will
cease to exist. The prospect Is that
there will be an era of disastrous tariff
war between this country and Ger
many. We will be hurt severely but It
is a question with experts whether we
will suffer any more than Germany if
as much. However, this coutry had
ample warning of what was coming
and if congress wants to Inaugurate a
period of tariff war, it may the more
speedily enforce the lesson that both
President McKinley and President
Roosevelt tried to inculcate, of fair re
ciprocal trade agreements. The lesson
may be a costly one, but after all it
may be worth the price of admission.

TWO OPINIONS CONCERNING
REMARRIAGE OF DIVORCEES
Shall the clergy of America unite to take a drastic stand against divorce
and the remarriage of divorcees?
T he recent action of Bishop Scanne» in excommunicating Miss Mae
Hamilton, a millionaire, because she had acted as bridesmaid at a wedding
where a divorcee was one of the contracting parties, has reopened the sub
ject throughout America. The following opinions on the subject given by a
judge and a priest of Los Angeles are Interesting in contrast:
MGR. HARNETT.
Vicar General of the Diocese ofMonte
rey and Los Angeles.
There is no use asking a Catholic
I'riesi his attitude on the question of
divorce. The teachings of the church
are well known on this point. There is
no divorce under these teachings. A
man's wife is his wife until death. And
so with the wife's husband. Only death
can part them. Re-marriage after di
vorce Is concubinage. That is all.
As to co-operation of the clergy to
take some more drastic stand than the
clergy of all denominations take, I be
lieve It would be a good thing. Co
operation always brings better results
than individual effort. In this country
this is a crying evil.
By taking such a stand ns is sug
gested the clergy will among other
things do much toward molding public
opinion, and public opinion does a
great deal toward making individuals
live properly. If here in America peo
ple frowned on divorce as they frown
on illegitimate births there would be
as few divorces as there are illegiti
mate births. We have come to look too
loosely on this question—I mean the
American people.
How many divorces do you find in i
Europe, England, Germany and Italy? '
How big a proportion of divorces do
you find there? Even in Canada there
are few. The people frown cm it. Pub
lic opinion puts a ban on it.
Were the clergy of this country to
unite and to take a stand opposing di
vorce and opposing re-marriage of di
vorcees, public opinion, which now
winks at this evil, would begin to take
a different attitude. And it is time that
something of this sort were done.

JUDGE WALDO M. YORK.
Member of the Superior Court at Los
Angeles.
I do not see that there would be any
practical results from the ministers re
fusing to perform marriages for di
vorced persons, because Judges and
justices of the peace could still perform
the ceremony. It is also questionable
in my mind- whether denying divorcees
the right to remarry would not lead
to worse immorality than would result
from their remarrying. Divorces under
the California law are granted for
adultery, extreme cruelty, wilful deser
tion, wilful neglect, habitual intem
perance and conviction for a felony.
It seems to me that either of those
causes should Justify a divorce. But
divorces must be denied upon a show
ing of connivance, collusion, condona
tion or recrimination.
With a careful administration of this
law. it is questionable in my mind if
more harm would not bo done by deny
ing divorces than by granting them.
I am satisfied that divorce laws are
more strictly construed than formerly
and that very few divorces are granted
without a merltoriolus cause. The ele
vation of society, I think, will eradi
cate much of the evil.
If divorces are more prevalent now
than formerly I think It is because peo
ple were accustomed to bear many
things in silence and that a higher
spirit has caused them to be more in
sistent upon maintaining their self re
spect and resenting ill treatment.
DO dozen brooms daily.
Mr. Thurber informs an Inter-State
News representative that about 1000
acres adjacent to T^ewiston are planted
to broom corn, Mr. Thurber himself
having D20 acres. The yield of broom
corn In this part of the country is
1000 pounds to the acre. About J75 a
ton is the prevailing price realized by
the farmers.
Mr. Thurher says Idaho soil is well
adapted to the production of an ex
cellent quality of broom corn.
HANG IT UP BY THE TAIL.
(Continued from page one.)
dog. it would be Just as uncomfortable
a sensation for this great country, and
by Jove I am not one to sit quietly by
and see it attempted."
"But do you not think some conces
sion ought to be made to New England
which is asking for free hides and
other free raw material?"
"Would these gentlemen enter on
tariff revision and hang the country up
by the tail for the sole purpose of hav
ing abolished the duty on imported
hides, which I think amounts to about
15 or 20 per cent ad valorem? What
difference would it make in the first
cost of a pair of shoes to have the
duly of 15 per cent taken off an im
ported hide? If any it would be very
small, perhaps a few cents. I don't
think the benefit to the wearer of the
shoe would bo appreciable. Yet in or
der to get 15 per cent off hides our
friends would open up the whole ques
tion of the tariff, would risk plunging
the country into a period of great busi
ness depression.
Uncle Joe Tolls a Story.
Let me tell you a thing that hap
pened right here in the capitol last
winter, when so many of our friends
were filled with the idea that the tariff
question could be settled, or rather the
tariff could be revised by the adoption
of Just a few amendments. A distin
guished friend of mine from Massachu
setts, a member of the house, came in
and said to me:
" 'You are all wrong about this tariff
business. It can be settled with Just
three amendments to the schedules.
Just put In an amendment for free
hides, another for free coal and another
for free wool.'
T told him it was worth thinking
over. A few minutes later a distin
guished member from a western state
came in.
I tell you,' he exclaimed, T have
solved this question of tariff revision,
and I'll do It in three amendments. We
will take the duty off steel, off woolen
good and off glass, and there you have
it.'
I also told hlm I would think it over.
It did not require much thought to con
vince mo that If these six amendments
were Introduced the men from New
England who wanted free wool and free
hides Would be at the throats of the
men from the west who wanted free
woolens and free shoes, and vice versa.
I know something about the scramble
that occurs when the word goes out
that the tariff Is going to be revised.
My voice la going to be against it.
What Revision Would Moan.
'Just think," he continued, "what an
active attempt to revise the tariff by
tills congress would mean. There are
more than eighty million persons in
this country. I don't, suppose it is an
extravagant estimate to say that
thirty-two millions of them are making
their living working with their hands
and brains, mostly with their hands.

dally earnings, no matter how obtained,
