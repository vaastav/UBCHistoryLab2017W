JAPS NATURALIZATION
Considered the Only Solution of
the Japanese Problem in
America.

Franolieo Jubilant) Three Hundred
Thousand Whltaa Ara Opposed
to Naturalliatlon.
HAN FRANCISCO, Dee. 7. In an
Interview published In the Call today,
bearing on the recommendations made
In hi message by President Room
velt on Japanese naturalisation and on
tha segregation of their children In
schools. General K. Uyene, thj conaul
for Japan here, aaya:
"Sentiment la practically unlveranl
among tha ten thousand Japnnese In
San Francisco that the reeommenda
tlona made by the President contain
tha moat ratlonnl solution of the Japanese-American
problem yet suggest
d. The Japanese are not only pleased
ovr the message, but they regard It
aa one of the moat noteworthy docu
ment on International question thnt
have been Issued from the White
Houae.
"There la no question but that the
bonda between Japan and the United
Btatea would be considerably strength
ened by conferring the privilege of
franchise on tho Japanese In Califor
nia. There are aome fifty odd thou
Band Jananeae In the atatee, and while
I am not In a poaltlon to Bay how
many of theae would take advantage
of naturalization privilege, I do
think the number would be compara
tively large. I think this "would be
especially ao In tho case of the Jap
anese in San Francisco.
"Many Japanese have family and
property In thla city and they would
naturally regard San Francisco aa
their permanent home once they be
lloved that they had the same prlv-
lieges as other aliens.
"Concerning tho school segregation
question, a lot la being written and
talked about that Is duo to miscon
ception of the facts in the case,
"I think that tho entire matter will
be solved satisfactorily and that there
la no occastlon for believing other
wise, The Jopanese are not striving
for anything unreasonable and are
quite willing to lot the facts In the
dispute guide whatever decision Is to
be ultimately decided."

commenting on Jacob Schlff's address
at the meeting of the chamber of com
merce yesterday, In which he asked
for an Inquiry into exorbitant inter

had heard that a number of banks
and trust companies were said to be
guilty of manipulating call money loan
rates In the manner described by Mr.
Schlff, but that he did not know
whether the charges were true. The
stock exchange authorities, he said,
would gladly co-operate with tho

"There is said to be enough money
to go around," ht added, "for the
brokers always manage to get accom
modations at soma rats or other and
apparently the money Is there, wheth
er It Is loaned at' five per cent at one
time of the day ,or 25 per cent at
another, and we would only be too glad
to waist In any movement to estab
lish less violent fluctuation. Thus
far we have been unable to devise any
plan for so doing."

IMPROVING MORAL CHARACTER
New Disease Discovered by New York
Specialists Which Usually Attacks
School Boys of Tender Years,
Is Curable.
NEW YORK, Dec 7. According to
Dr. William H. Maxwell, city superin
tendent of schools, and Dr. John J.
Cronin, assistant chief medical in
spector of the board of health, It has
been demonstrated that Burgery can
transfom a bad boy Into a good one.
This achievement among other equal
ly beneficial, was the result of an op
eration performed recently upon a
pupil from a school in the lower East
Side, whose name is withheld. Pri
marily the operation was resorted to,
not with the notion of Improving the
lad's moral character, but for the re
moval of a physical defect.
For a long time the boy, who Is
about 14 years old, and the son of poor
parents, had been incorrigible In and
out of school. After the operation
which was for the removal of adenoids,
there was a surprising change In the
boy. He became more cheerful, lost
his surly manner, and without threats
or coercion, but merely in response
to a kindly suggestion, he stopped
smoking cigarettes, a habit to which
he had been addicted. He also de
veloped a quickness of apprehension
and a readiness to study and is now
considered a model pupil.
