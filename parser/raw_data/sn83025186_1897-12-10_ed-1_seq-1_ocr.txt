Dr. C. R. Ransom's
Lecture.
On last Tuesday evening Rev. C.
R. Rausom of Chicago the eloquent
young divine, delivered his lecture
entitle "Paddle your own Canoe,"
or the version is self reliance. The
weather was lovely and warm and
everything was as good as could be
expected except there being so few
present, yet there was no excuse for
their non presence, only like of race
pride, race advancement or literary
appreciation, as the meeting was
thoroughly advertised and admission
reasonable. For us to attempt to
give a synopsis of the lecture, would
be in vain as our colored short-hand
reporters did not take it down for
which we are sorry but the Dr. has
promise to give us a part of it with his
cut to print in our Xmas holiday
number. The lecture was splendid
filled with good thoughts pure diction
and delivered with great eloquence
and ease in a graceful and attractive
manner well worth the preesnce of
any auditors and especially instruc
tive to our race, his idea of accumula
ting and saving wealth was good
then by putting brain and education
into those places that we now have
and that honest labor, hotel labor
or any other so called menial labor
are not menial but honorable, he
recommend the industrial theory
and the unification of our race,
and to give the young ambitious and
aspiring youth our hearty support.
The Docter says that it is a duty
rather then a right that we have,
then he says that our race needs
stronger men, morally to protect our
young and guide them right. The
church is the only moral evangeliz
ing agency of our race for the sav
ing of people. The central thought
that he developed was to be self re
liant, self educated, self econemy
and christian morality. Tha Dr.
Was born and educated in Ohio
finishing his college course at Wil
berforce he was a student at the
time that Mr. J. F. Blagburn and
wife were students there, he has a
bright future before him and we
wish him success.

President's Message.
President MiKinley transmitts his

ple has in the President he meets all
the important questions squarely, he
first discussed the finande the great
mass of people have been waiting
with special interest to see the Presi
dent's views on the finance and the
people had she same anxiety and in
terest as to what the message would
contain about Cuba and Hiawua.
He had but little to say on this sub
ject, the next subject presented is
the Nicaruaga canal, he de!t lightly
on it, but promised a special mes
sage on this subject. The reci
procity feature of our new tarifi law
has hardly had time to prove that a
change was necessary he says that
we should do our full share in cary
ing the trade of the world. After re
fering to the two conferences recently
held to protect the seal heard he
adds: "Negotiations to this end ara
now in progress, the result of which
I hope to be able to report to con
gongress at an early day," he also
says this country should be properly
represented at the Paris exposition
in 1900. He makes a strong appeal
for the completion of the three bat
tle ships, the extension of the gen
eral survey system of Alaska is rec
emended *—tht-^lndian "question,
especialy the five tribes of civilized
Indians was discussed, he also lays
before congress the sale of the
Union Pacific Railroad last month.
The last subject he discussed was
the civil service, after a general re
view of this question the President
says, There are places now in the
classified service which ought to be
exempted and others not classified
may proparly be included."

For Auditor of the

Ex^United Stales Senator, B. K.
Bruce, formally from Miss., but
now of Washington, D. C., wasap*
pointed last week Auditor of the
United States Treasury by Presi
dent McKinley. No better ap
pointment could have been made
and will no doubt meet the gens
eral approval of the leading pro
gressive element of our race. In
all of Mr. Bruce's long political
career he has not one word against
his honesty and purity of charac
ter, nor has he ever been guilty of
malfeasance or non-feasance, neith
er has he lost his identity with his
race leaders. As he has once be
fore held said position he will go
into the office with abundant ex
perience, and will add strength
with the Treasury department.
We only hope the ex-Senator will
remember Iowa in the selection
of some of liis assistant clerks.
