ABRAHAM LINCOLN. NEWSPAPER PRICES.
When wo fneresaod tho price of ihe
Jour At, to Two Dollars per year, we wer
amlor the impression that tha price of
whit paper wai about aa hinh aa it could
possibly gel; but wa find that we have
been mistaken, for another "advance" baa
already been made in the price of this srtl-
. We aro uow psyins 115 00 for the
same amount of white paper for which, two
years sinco, we p u l 87 "0. Our patrons
will ut orico soe, that at this rate of iuci ram,
wo oan not long ufT.ml to publish tho Joi-r-
nau nt $2 per year: In (act. wa can
not now afford it, yet that is a'l we are
charging fur our paper.
If there la no additional increase in the
coat of paimr, wo shall endeavor to contin
uous price of tlio Jocrnai, at Two )ol-
lara, bii' if another advance ia made in our
expenses we shall be compelled to make a
oorruspooding ndvanco.
for the preaent. however, ami until' Cur-
thor notice wo will receive Two Dollars
per yosr for the Journal, but we can
make no promiao as to the length of time
during- which we will reueivo that amount.
Our readers will therefore cuusult their own
interest by making immudittte payment, be
foro any addition is ni.i.lo to the price of
the pitper.
On the question of newspaper prices, we
copy the following sonsiblo niticle from the
Vhto tttu Journal:
A great chango has como over t' e busi-
iicbj of nuwspapur printing within tho last

ruinous to tho trade, ani brought 110

lint the difficulties to tho trade did not
stop here. A fow years ao, thoso two

Thny are the great centralizing powers of

wneu we go to our ilinnor, to take along
the morning papers from Cincinnati, Clove

THE WAR
Iteliul newspapers of the Cth iust. give
apparently pretty reliable accounts ofllfn.
eial Sherman's position and uiowmonU on
Monday of hut week. t ia said that his
columns had then united, and that his wholo
army was Koiilhweat of Millon, and march
ing steadily towards the coast, which it
was thought he eVeaiguod reaching at 14- iu
the vicinity of Savannah. A battle north
west of Savannah, before the cl.iso of this
week, bet eeu his force and its oppoaers,
was anticipated by tho rebula. Anctthit

which is said to have ovcuirod on Sunday

say that his ani tiais evpreaaed astoiiish

which they weic paasing and Ihe abiliidauai

A battle took place at Houey IMI, S. C.

Foster were with the expedition. After
landing, Iho troops woro puahod out for
several milos in various directions, driving
H10 enemy before tlioin nt ovcry. point.
The day was (bus consumed in rcconnoit
ering mil skirmishing. Kirly on the
morning of the 30th they were attacked by
a body of robula who tnove.l otit from their
eaithwotks at Iloaey flill. These woro
immediately driven in, and determined and
eevcro fighting commenced between our
men on tho open grennd and tho enemy In
his iiilretichmonls, and lasted- for ovcrrd
hours. Three gallant charges were mado
on the rebel works by tho l.'nion Holdiers;
but, llii'lmg them too strong to bo easily
taken, and not of siiflijient importanco to
compciiHuto for tho Iomsus wliiclx thiir ca.i.

The exchange of prisoners on Savannah
river lias coated, either (ioneral Sherman's
or Moiioral Foster's operations having ren
dered the rebels uunblo or indisposed to
continue the delivery of our men at that
poitit.
There is little change of importance in
tho positions ol the two armies at Nash
ville. A rebel battery has been establish
ed on a bluff fourteen miles below Nash
ville, nnd seven of our gunboats went
down and attacked it, but did not siiocsod
in driving tlio enemy away. Olio of tho
boats was cousiduiiubly damaged in tho en
gagement. A Union rccoiiuoitering party
between tho Nashville and Lebanon pikos
met a lurge body of rebels, whom they
skirmished with and drove oil'. It is re
ported Hint that the rebels have planted a
battery at llarpeth bho tls; 011 the Tennes
see river, and a gunboat has gone to look
after it. Meantime transports are not al
lowed to ascond thoTciinessco.
Heavy engagements in tho vicinity of
Itichnion.l and Petersburg ore now daily

STATES RIGHTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA
—DENUNCIATION OF DAVIS.
Tho State's rights extremists of South
Carolina did m ro than tiny olhor class of
men nt the South to procipitato tho Seces
sion movomout, nnd there aro now no more
angry or disappointed individuals in the
Confodirraey, Mr. Ilobort 11 trn well P.hett
an avowed distinionist long b . -fore Mr. Lin
coln's first election, has introduced tho
following resolutions io t!io8)uth Carolina
Legislature, in which ho denounces in fiorco
tonus tho recotit policy of Jeff. Davis:
Jtftolreil, Th it tho sovereign Rtatos com
posing tho confederacy of tho Confederate
States are not amenable to tho Government
of tho Confederate .States for their exist
ence; and that any laws passed by Congress
conscripting their ollioers into the army nf
the Confederate States, whoruby the ordi
nary operations of ytutd Governments may
bo disturbed or arrested, are lligrant usur
pations to which tho States should not
submit.
htnohctl, That by the torma of tlio Con
stitutiou ol tho Confederate States Congress
can make 110 la-v it'iridgin.t the free lo.n of
the press. Therefore, all legislation by
C.tfigross beariug upon either tho material
ol tlio press or tho persons producing it,
by which its freedom is abridged, is un
constitutional. A'fsoew.TInit the Constitution especially
prescribes that no capital or direct tax
shall bo paid unless in proportion to tho
census, and that representation und tliroct
taxes bluill be apportioned umong the
States. Any direct toxation, therefore,
against those provisions is plainly uncon
stitutional, Il;so!c!l, That tho institution of African
slavery is exclusively uudor tho jurisdic
tion ami control of tho sovereign States.
Any law jiasried by Congress to emancipate
a slave 111 uny .State, or to appropriate
money from the Treasury, of tho Confeder
ate States to cm mciputo tho tiluvo, id un
constitutional and void.
Preliminary to this declaration of griev
ances, the Governor assorts that South
Carolina was oppressed by the Richmond
authorities, ami auks, tho Legislature lo
"dcOuo nioro clearly, by stntuto, tho limits
of tho authority of tho General Govern
ment. His main source of trouble is iden
tical with that of Mr. Uhctt, viz., tho
niilificatifju of the Stato exemptions. He
says: "Any furthor claim made by the
General Government upon this Slate, at
least, will abstract so much from tho little
bone and sinew Hint ia left in the land as
to leave us enervated, paralyzed und com
parativcly helpless in our own defense."
11c alleges that South Carolina,, "with a
voting population of about forty-seven
thousand, has furnished at ki 1st sixty. livo
thousand troops to iho Confederate army,
ami that of the thousands of Stato ollioers
whom she might have claimed ns exempts
from that aervico, there aro less thaii one
hundred wit-bin- tho borders of tho Slate.'
A moro fearful record of thu exhau.ting
extent to which the conscription leu al
ready been carrie I c nil 1 not bo mile.
Stato rights may bo tho pretext, but they
uro not tho only cause for groaning which
South Carolina has.
THE GROWTH OF THE NATION.
There is 110 more striking feature of the
President's Message than that which estab
liuhes the fact that notwithstanding all tho
desolations and ravages of this unhappy
civil war, tho loyal Slates havo actually
increased in population smico 181.0. The
not increase, during tho war, iu tho loyal
States and Territories has boon 14:'),
751, not iucliiding the soldier from var
ious States that did not vote in tho rccont
election. Statisticians, in oiJinary times,
estimate that as many us 25 per cent of the
population do tiut voto at all. Tho num
ber that did not voto iu 18U0 and 1854 w as
very much less than this and probably
about the same in per cent. But this in.
crease does not iueliide tons of thousands
of foreign emigrants who have arrived
upon our shores, and who havo not be on
naturalized. .1
This fact of a great increase in our popu
lation hue a very Important bearing on the
qitestiou of our ability to carry on the war.
It shows that there is. yet u:i abundanco
of mea iu tho land, and that tho rebellion
can be pu t down.
Iho growth in our population illustrate
aevoral other iniptvtant facts. The popu
I tr vot. iu l-OfiO, of all the states now in
insurrection, was 85G,r2l. That of Now
York this year is 720,730, only 13"),73i
votes less. That is, tho strength of New
York alone is nearly, equal to that of the
insurrectionary States iu I860.' But the
population of ihe rebellious Slates has bet n
greatly retlticed 111 fnur veara. The av
ages of war havo been iu tlieir midst.
Their loss of life lias Wen fearful. We
may therefore utter that the popular vote
to-dny ef the' tftate of New York is as great
as that of all tho States 111 insurrection.
It is this wonderful growth of tho North,
going on in spite of the civil war, which
alarmed the rebel leaders in days gone by
They saw it inevitable that they would
finaljy bo out-voted in the legislative halls
ef the nation. Thoy sought, therefore, to
escape iroin tn ootisoqueiioes of that ma
jority by pluuglug lute tSia desolate strife.
Thoir motto was, "letter raign iu hell than
serve in heaven," atid reigning iu darkness
and destruction they certainly are. The
dream' of a grttai slave empire ordering on
the Gulf ia forever gone. The great froe
poHtlaiiou of the NwriU Is ' to luhabit the
