forwarded by courier to San Fabian,
says that Gen. Young, with three troops
of the Third envnlry and Maj. Peyton C.
March's battalion of the Thirty-third
infantry, arrived at Santa Cruz Monday.
TheAmericansleftHamapacan.province
of Union, Monday morning, expecting
to have n hard fight at Tngudin, in South
Ilocos province, but they found, on ar
riving there, thnt 000 rebels, under Gen.
Tino, had evneuated 30 hours before, de
serting nn almost impregnable position.
The insurgents had been entrenched nt
Tngudin, on the north side of the river,
where a hundred well disciplined troops
could have slaughtered a whole brigade
crossing the river, with the men up to
the armpit in water.
The residents of Tngudin received the
Americans outside the town with n
brass bund. They had been robbed of
almost everything by the insurgents
and were glad to welcome friendly and
protecting troops. A similar reception
awaited Gen. Young nt Santa Cruz.
Prominent citizens, bended by n band,
escorted the American officers to houses,
where rest and refreshment were of
fered. Gen. Y'oung's commnnd wns nl
most without food. The men had been
living on the country, which nfTords
but little, nnd the horses nre complete
ly worn out, most of them without
shoes.
The inhabitants of Santa Cruz and
of other towns through which the
Americans passed say that Aguinnldo
and his entire refugee nrmy have gone
into the mountains eastward since the
Oregon, Snmnr and Cnllao attacked
Vigan and landed a force there.
Gen. Young's desire is to pursue the
rebels into the mountnins. There is no
communication between his small com
mand and any of the other American
columns, except indirectly, perhaps, by
sighting nnd signnling United States
gunboats bound to or from Manila.
In several towns Gen. Young was
shown letters written by Lieut. Gil
more, showing thnt he had been kindly
treated by the citizens and had been en
tertained by them when lie passed
through Inst May. Reports indicate
that all the American prisoners, some
25 or 30, were at one time in Benguet
province, but it is supposed now that
they have been removed into Lepnnte
province.
Capt. Rumbold, with 35 men of com
pnny G, Thirty-second infantry, while
escorting the signal corps laying the

Americans found on the captain the
sword nnd revolver thnt were taken
from the body of Naval Cadet Welborn
C. Wood, who wns killed by the insur
gents while in commnnd of the gunboat
Urdaneta, when thnt vessel wns cap
tured in the Orani river.
Manila, Dec. 5. Aguinaldo's mother,
who wns captured by Maj. Cronin with
the little son of the insurgent lender
and brought to Mnnila by order of Gen.
Otis, said in nn interview:
"I desire nothing but that peace may at
once bo secured. I am plad from tho bot
tom of my heart that the Insurrection 1b
near Its end. Agulnaldo Is not sufficiently
civilized to keep from being misled by the
bad counsel of his ministers and the mem
bers of the Filipino congress. A majority
of those about him have constantly de
clared for war. Such a course has always
been contrary to Aguinaldo's best Judg
ment, but he was weak enough to allow
them to Induce him to fight. That Is why
I say he Is not sufficiently civilized."
The mother of the insurgent leader
expressed herself as being immensely
gratified by the manner in which she
nnd her grandson have been treated by
their American captors. She continued :
"When I was captured I fully expected
that I would bo shot immediately. For
this reason I tried to keep the Identity of
tho child a secret from tho soldiers, but
thoy found It out somehow. Instead of be
ing put to death I have been treated with
every kindness."
She nlho told me that the death of the
recently born bube of the insurgent
leader had been caused from falling
from the arms of a cureless nurse, and
not from exposure during the hurried
retrent, as had been widely reported.
She claimed that the women nnd fami
lies even of the insurgent oilicers are
suffering fenrful privation and hard
ship as a result of tho war. She also
claimed to know nothing of Aguinnldo's
whereabouts or his ultimate destina
tion. Fireman Killed.

BATTLE OF MODDER RIVER.
Fuller Detail of (lie Great HiiKitiro-
niont llotiveon llrltlsh nnd
llocr Force.
..London, Dec. '5. A correspondent
with Gen. Lord Mcthueii's column, tele
graphing from Modder river Inst
Thursday, snys:
"Tho Wntorloo of tho campaign has been
fought nnd won. Tho battle wns conducted
with unprecedented stubbornness on both
sides. Thcro was ono continuous roar, like
tho explosion of countless firecrackers.
Tliero wns no flinching on either side, and
not a moment's pause. For llvo hours tho
British batteries poured tons of shrapnels
unci shells Into tho Hoor positions. Lord
Iothuen had 22 guns, nnd each llrcd nn nv
orago of 200 rounds. Tho Boors had nn ol
most equal number of guns, which, It Is
reported, were mostly served by French
and German artillerists.
"It Is believed that tho Boors had occu
pied tho position seven weeks before nnd
had spent tho Interval In fortifying nnd
rendering It, as they considered, Impreg
nable. They did not seem to fear to spend
their ammunition and their guns wore well
nnd smartly handled.
"Owing to tho bend In the river on the
right, tho Boers hnd nn opportunity of
cross-firing on tho British attack, A Boer
GEN. CRONJE.
hotchklss was directed with marvelous ac
curacy against British maxim, killing th
sergeant In charge, wounding an otllcet
and disabling the gun, This occurred quite
at the beginning of the engagement. When
ever the Boer Are was silenced In one di
rection It was Immediately reopened In an
other. Owing to tho terrlllc tiro nobody on
tho plain was out of range. Stretcher bear
ers found It Impossible to go forward in
the few cases they wore called upon to at
tend, and tho wounded wero compelled, If
possible, to crawl out of tho lines.
"No quarter seems to have been given on
either side. Tho British assert that, amid
tho bullets, tho ambulanco wagons dis
played their flags promiscuously to no ad
vantage. These wero repeatedly driven
back and compelled to take refuse out of
sight. It Is alleged that the Boers used
dumdums nnd made special targets of the
horses on tho plain In the hope of hitting
the riders. While tho Argyll Highlanders
were pushing across tho river they were
llred upon from a house nnd several fell.
Thereupon the hlghlanders stormed the
house, and, although the Boers hoisted a
whlto flag, no attention was paid to it, and
all the Boers were shot.
"It Is reported that Gen. Cronje, with his
contingent, retreated toward Langcberg
at four o'clock In the afternoon. Others
followed In tho direction of Jacobsdal, and
the main body of tho Boers retired with the
guns about eight In the evening.
"On the following morning at daybreak
tho British tired a few shells Into tho vil
lage. Getting no response, a patrol of cav
alry crossed tho river and found the ene
my's camp deserted. Dead Boers and many
who wore dying wero to bo seen every
where In the intrenchmonts, as well as
numerous new graves. Several buildings
were In smoking ruins.
"Some of tho Boer prisoners say that
Gen. Cronjo was In supremo command. He
had to whip his men to prevent them from
deserting, and despite this many throw
down their rllles and tied."
Cape Town, Thursday, Nov. 30. The
Cape Times has the following dispatch
from Mafeking: "Gen. Cronje, with 100
wagons nnd a lnrge body of Boers, hns
left his langer, practically raising the
siege, nlthough desultory firing can be
heard."

A NOTABLE SILVER ANNIVERSARY.
'With tho close of tho present ycarj
Mr. David C. Cook, of Chicngo, will
celebrate his first quarter-centennial
ns editor and publisher of Sunday
school literature. Stnrting twenty-five
years ago, without reputation or assur
ance of support, he hns become ono of
the most widely nnd favorably known
publishers in this line. Beginning in
1875 with two small publications, his.
periodicals have grown In number and
favor until there are few schools in
tlds country that do not find it to their
interest to use some of his pure and
helpful publications, while ninny in
distant lands pay tribute to their mer
its. The past quarter of a century
has witnessed many changes among-Sunday-school
publishers, and much
less time than this hns sufficed for some
to outlive their usefulness. On thecon
trary, Mr. Cook is preparing to cele
brate the beginning of another quarterV
certtury with additional improvements,
and now publications. Among these
may be mentioned the Now Century
Sunday School Teacher's Monthly, a.
large nnd thoroughly up-to-date mag
azine for superintendents and teachers,
the first issue of which will appear in
December. Among the most remark
able of his publications is the Y'oung
People's Weekly, which hns attained
a circulation of nearly a quarter of a
million, being a successful attempt to
furnish a high grade of religious story
reading for boys and girls. To avoid
the "goody-goody" story of the Sunday-school,
such as we remember in
our childhood days, and furnish some
thing natural, interesting and en
nobling, has been its aim, and we are
not at all surprised at its popularity.
The restraining influence of the
Christian home and the Sunday-school
on our growing community of young
people, some of us may not appreciate
as we should perhaps because these
sometimes fail to restrain. This paper
should be a most welcome accessory
in this work, nnd one which all should
appreciate. Boys and girls will read,
and the story book and paper are their
first choice. There seems a plentiful
supply of religious papers for older
people, but this is the first successful
atttempt to furnish a non-sectarian re
ligious story paper for young people.
The paper is profusely illustrated,
beautifully printed, and contains as
much or more reading matter than tho
most expensive of secular young peo
ple's story papers. The price, seventy
five cents per year, should bring it
within the reach of every home. Mr.
Cook is now mnking a special effort
to give the paper a wider circulation,
and nil who send seventy-five cents for
a year's subscription before Jan. 1st
will receive a beautiful premium pic
ture entitled "The Soul's Awakening."
It is exactly the same size (13x18
inches) and style as those on sale at
art stores for $1. Orders should be ad
dressed to David C. Cook Publishing
Co., 36 Washington St., Chicago.
Probably no man living has done so
much to improve nnd cheapen Sunday
school literature as has Mr. David C.
Cook. Through his aid thousands of
schools have been encouraged, im
proved and made self-sustaining. Mr.
Cook is yet a comparatively young man,
and it does not appear at all improbable
that his field of usefulness may extend
over yet another quarter-century.

caused by an inflamed condition of tlie mu

this tube gets inflamed you hnvc a rumbling
