While Secretary Wilson of the De
partment of Agriculture was singing
the song bf the farmer's Joy orer his
banner year of production and profit,
the club, women of the west were con
sidering the condition of the farmers'
wires, with the resultant announce
ment that for every member of the
family the slogan "Back to the farm"
has everything to commend It.
In the early days of the west it was
a common remark of eastern women
that they pitied their western sisters,
whom they pictured as going insane by
wholesale because of their dreary iso
lation and monotonous existence. But
today the tables are reversed, and the
eastern dweller in cramped city quar
ters Is learning to look with envy upon
the prosperity and contentment of the
farmer's wife In the west.
Truth Is, the day of drudgery on the
farm fs past. The development of
agricultural resources i has amazed the
nation, and the farmer with his auto
mobile and leisure to enjoy it is a liv
ing reality as well as a stock Joke for
the newspapers. In all the progression
the wife has shared. Just as she shared
the hardships In the pioneer days.
Now she baa commonly as much help
in her home duties aa has the average
city woman, she haa the same com
forts of modern conveniences, and If
she has not neighbors crowding her at
every turn of her elbow, she has a
broader -outlook upon the world and
can hold social Intercourse with her
chosen friends over the telephone, or
by means of her motor car can Join an
agreeable gathering, as readily as
though at the very center of popula
tion. Rural delivery Is another human
touch with her kind, and she has her
own clubs and similar interests, as
readily accessible and as, entertaining
and edifying as any in the land.
Altogether, the time for wasting
pity on the poor farmer's wife is past,
except in those isolated cases where
the failure to rise above old conditions
must be attributed to individual fail
ure to respond to those influences
which have made home life In the west
so independent and happy for the
farmer and Ms wife an1 family.
The Nation's Finance!.
There is evident in the annual re
port of the secretary of the treasury
a co-operation with the announced pol
icy of the administration for close
economy and for a more concerted con
sideration of the system of estimates
and appropriations which in this coun
try takea the place of "the budget that
perplexes Euroirean nations. It must
be evident to the observer of Wash
ington events that the government is
well on Kb way toward a final form of
reorganisation of its fiscal responsibil
ities, evolving a scientific method .: of
appropriations which shall' be ? a
marked gain over the haphazard mode
of the past. - v
The new idea gives every assurance
that tho treasury will hereafter be
wisely administered as a unit, not only
as regards the passing of approprla
tlons by congress, but also as concerns
the routine of the department, where
it s apparent that the application of
more modern business customs will
simplify the work and eliminate anti
quated and roundabout red-tape pro
cedure.
It Is 'clear that progress Is being
made In the dealings of the comp
troller of the currency with the na-
tional banks, and that directors have
been stimulated to a livelier and more
detailed sense of their active responsl
bllltles. The secretary announces a
radical improvement in the ruling that
examiners hereafter must be identified
with the service, having no political or
financial affiliation. The year has un
doubtedly witnessed a considerable
strengthening of the banking Interests.
Secretary MacVeagh is very precise
in his interpretation of the corporation
tax, and he makes clear that the treas
ury expects to collect 1 per. cent of the
actual net profits of each taxable cor
poration from all its sources of reve
nues. Banking and currency reform
he finds to be still a matter for the
future to determine, and he argues
convincingly for anAiltlmate form of
adjustable currencyand trustworthy
surplus reserves, "two absolutely es
sentlal features of any banking system
upon which the finances, and the com
merce of this great nation can securely
rest." His attitude against any make
shift legislation may be construed as
part of the administration's policy of
deferring all action (until a rational,
harmonious agreement for the cure of
existing evils shall have been reached.
Civil Service Pension!.
The subject of civil service pensions
cannot much longer be., evaded, yet
there will be some hesitancy on the
part of congress to fasten another pen
sion system upon the country at a
time when the military' pension list
Is being increased by 'the recent old
age legislation and tiy the never-ceasing
importunities f the augmenting
of old allowances.
Secretary MacVeagh points -out that
we are the only nation that has no gen
eral legal retiring pension for em
ployes of the civil service, except as
pertains to the Judiciary, while large
universities and industrial corpora
tions of the country have taken strides
along this very line. He finds that the
public service is blocked in many in
stances by the unwillingness ' of the
officials in charge to throw out worthy
men and women who have given the
best ot their lives to the work of the
government, so' that, he argues, we
are. practically paying pensions under
a fysteri?Shat ! verT imperfect and
wholly unsatisfactory in form.
President Taft likewise contends
that a system of pensions for clj em-
ployes and the substitution therefor of
younger and more energetic servants
promotes both economy and efficiency
of administration. Secretary and
president are in accord on the necessity
fox, some method of superannuation.
and it may be that their united recom
mendation will result In the presenta
tion of a form of pension bill repre
senting their views for consideration at
the current session of congress.
Extending Onr Influence Abroad.
The proposal to raise the United
States minister to China to the rank of
ambassador with the accession of Mr.
Calhoun to that office, has to recom
mend it the fact that with the in
creased dlginlty of the post its incum
bent would have fuller opportunity for
developing our relations not only with
the Chinese empire, but throughout the
far east.
There can be no doubt that our neg
lect of business opportunities in the
field beyond the open door has been
due chiefly to the lack of understand
ing in commercial circles of Just how
vast those opportunities were, and it
may well be that in thus honoring our
representative to Peking we will Im
press upon our own people the tre
mendous importance of the post, and
awaken the mercantile interests to the
fuller significance of the open door.
To the world at large, such eleva
tion ot the minister would serve as
notification that we are not to be lag
gard In any respect In the matter of
international diplomacy as affecting
affairs in that part of the world, and
immediate strengthening of our pres
tige would undoubtedly follow.
Republican! and Reform.
The report of the Nebraska Railway
commission to the governor is a sum
ming up of accomplishments that the
citizens of the state will do well to re
view in detail. Without question it
is as remarkable a showing as was
ever made by a body similarly consti
tuted. Less than three years ago this body
went into office under a title that was
immediately questioned in the courts,
and was sustained In all particulars.
Laws for its guidance and operation
were passed at the time the body was
organized, and in the short time that
has elapsed since its formation It has
achieved more in the way of beneficial
.reform as regards railroad rates and
service than had ever been done in all
the history of the state. The enforce
ment of the Sibley law against the ex
press companies in itself, is a sufficient
triumph for the railway commission,
but this is only one of its many vic
tories for the people. It is still en
gaged In securing reforms in service
that will be for the good of the public.
One point should not "be overlooked.
This board was constituted by a. repub
lican legislature. Its membership has
been republican from the beginning,
and the'laws it has been called upon to
enforce were enacted by republicans
and approved by a republican governor.
The only bit of legislation for which
the democrats are In any wise responsi
ble is the cute little bill by which the
anti-pass law was Juggled so as to
make It more difficult to prosecute its
violators. The republicans of Ne
braska can well stand on the record
they have made in dealing with the
common carrier question.
The passing of the old market house
will be regretted by none. It has
stood in the middle of the street for
many years, a monument to a blunder
made by the city council, . and the
sooner It is removed the better. But
its removal does not finally dispose of
the question of a public market. This
will again force Itself to the front, and
the wiseacres of the present council
might perform something like real
service by undertaking a solution of
the problem. I
Americans cannot but be amazed at
the action of William Watson, the
English poet, in disclosing for publica
tion Immediately on his arrival in New
York the personal confidences of Eng
lish women which he gleaned while a
guest in their homes. We may well
wonder what significance attaches in
his case to the phrase, "A fine old Eng
lish gentleman."
The Douglas county farm hand- who
has finally come Into his reward as the
result of the death ot his mistress is
an exemplar, cheerful to contem
plate, of the oU-tlme servant who lived
to aid his master rather than for per
gonal profit. The breed is so rare that
an occasional specimen ought to be
carefully preserved.
If the consolidation of the Bellevue
and Hastings schools will result in the
strengthening of the new Institution,
the work will have been well done.
Omaha people will not say good-bye to
Bellevue college without regret, but

There seems to be a failure to get
together on a basis of military aero

be very much in the air.

NEW M1MSTKK TO CHINA.

The new minister to China who, by the
way. Is not an ambassador, certain ought-to-be-well-lnformed
newspapers to the con
trary notwithstanding will hall from Chi
cago and his name will begin with C.
There, however, the resemblance to Min
ister Crane ends; for William J. Calhoun
is a lawyer, and he haa had diplomatic
experience.
Mr. Calhoun went aa special envoy to
Veneauela at the time when the harbor
of La Oualra was full of warships and
the situation extremely unstable. He made
exhaustive Investigations and turned in to
the State department a report wherein the
diplomatic and legal reefs and sandbars
were so admirably charted that the United
States has been able to steer salely ever
since, wltl). the Monroe dootrlne in tow.
Before this achievement he visited Cuba

Philadelphia Publto Ledger.
Dr. Frank, Julian , Warne, a graduate
of the University of Pennsylvania and long
an earnest student of social and industrial
cvuestlons, tali.es up in the current number
of the Metropolitan Magailne In the course
of his study of "The Conquest of Poverty,"
the particular ' part played by ' the labor
unions. He takes the general position that
the dormant and primary causes of pov
srty are not individual or social defects of
character, but those economic forces over
which the Individual victim usually has
no control. And he makes the claim that
it is chiefly to the labor unions that the
credit is due for the prevention of poverty
by the removal of its cause that Is, the
regulation of factory management, the pro
vlalon of safety appliances and the general
enforcement of better sanitary conditions.
The record of death and caaualty in the
industries of the country is briefly re
viewed and authorities are quoted to show
that were the same precautions taken and
care exercised as In certain foreign coun
tries a vast proportion of the accidents
would be avoided and thousands of human
lives saved.
From this tf. Warno is led to a consid
eration of, the movement for a change In
the American law and practice concerning
the employers' ilablllty for accidents to
workers and he says that the brunt of
the struggle for the prevention of indus
trial aocidents.is being borne by the labor
unlona. In this connection he gives the fol
lowing table, not as a complete bhowlng
of the relief work 'of labor organizations,
but as a suggestion of what is being done:

An interesting feature of Dr. Warne's
article Is the statement which he presents
as showing the attitude of the unions on
the subject. Thus he quotes John Mitchell,
ex-presldent of the United Mine Workers,
as saying:
To understand what the trade unions
aro doing to combat poverty It is necessary
to consider the cause of povcrie-. Poverty Is
tlie result of unemployment, low wages,
disease, accident and mivfurtune. The traJ:
unions have sousht, with marked success,
to remove poverty by securing for the
v.aee earners a rate of wages sufficiently
Meb to enable workmen and th?ir families
to live In a manner conformable to Ainer
loan standards. They the unions have
accumulated large funds which are used
to toliuve workmen and their families who
may be In distress as a result of accident,
death, sickness or unemnloy niiu. Last
year there were paid for the relief of the
unemployed members of trade unions out
of the funds In. the -union treasuries, not
less than ta.OOw.OOO. These expenditures do
not Include several millions ot dollars paid
In strike and lockout benefits,.
James Duncan, first vloe president of
the American Federation of Labor, in his
statement of labor's campaign ajalust pov
erty enumerates the reduction of the work
ing hours per day and the Increase of
wsges as the most important contribu
tions toward the cause and he adds:
I oontend that the recurrence of panics
haa Vfen changed by trade unlona reducing
orklVg hours per day, and to three-quar-tera
and two-thirds Instead of full time,
so as to keep all employed: also In refusing
to reduce wages during dull times.
Again experience proves that the toller
who la not overworked and who reoelvee
fair compensation for hia labor la a sober,
thrifty living clllsen, which fact glvsa him
a better chance to guard against poverty.
Thus again, prevention being better than
a cure, we soore. Judged from any stand
point, trade unions an performing tltvlr

The demand for a change of the date of
the inauguration of president and vloe
president from March 4 to a day promising
more agreeable Washington weather de
velops more than the languid Interest ex
cited heretofore The experience of the
multitude In the abominable weather of the
last occasion weather so disagreeable aa
to compel abandonment of outdoor exer
cises brought home to public officials the
oft-repeated truth that a later date sheuld
be chosen, both for public health and gen
eral convenience. How the change may be
effected ts a question which one of the
house committees will consider and report
at this session. Several pending measures
fix various dates In April and May. Repre
sentative Gaines of West Virginia, chair
man of the committee, says he proposed to
go Into this subject thoroughly. "Involv
ing as It does a change In the vast and
complicated msehlnery of the government
with a lengthening of the term of one pres
ident and a general readjusting ot dates,
there should be no haste in dealing with
the subject," he said.
Chairman Gaines said the committee
would hold as many hearings as may be
necessary to reach a full understanding
of the subject, and determine what should
be dona.
The anteroom of President Taft's new of
fices affords an entertaining and varied
spectacle these days, especially when the
hand shakers oall In tow of their senator
of representative. They came from every
where, and b their appearance and their
actions demonstrate anew that, though God
made man In His own Image, "He hath
sought out many Inventions." All sorts
and conditions of people come to the White
House while congress Is in session to make
many and curious requests. An astounding
number of them come to beg the president
or members of the cabinet to make speeches
In various parts of the country. Anything
from the annual meeting ot a state bar
association to the celebration ot a harvest
home festival brings a delegation to Wash
ington looking for a "big gun" to make
the speech of the day. Not one-tenth of
these requests can be granted. The presi
dent tells all the delegations that come
td him that If the cabinet officers accepted
One-third of the Invitations they have to
speak, the government business would be
sadly neglected.
For the first time, in over forty year the

used In lieu of the 10-cent on the registered

design for a few days, but the change Is

This Is a story about John Eversman,
right hand man for Representative Mc
Klnley of Illinois, and playful as a pup
with a bone; L. Whito Busbey, secretary
to Speaker Cannon and dignified as a
blind owl, and Asher Bines, legislative
clerk of the house, and neither playful
nor dignified to an extreme.
They were riding uptown from the capl
tol on a street car when, with one accord,
they all lifted up their voices and each in
sisted on paying the fares of his com
panions. "No," said Eversman, who la the playful
guy of the group; "we'll match to see who
pays."
They flipped up coins and each coin fell
heads up. By this time the conductor was
getting 'red in the face.
"Well," said Eversman, "whoever haa the
coin bearing the earliest date must pay."
The three colna, upon examlnaUonjjroved
to bear each one the date 1W2. At this mo
ment the conduotnr walked away from
them and swore volubly, but In a low ton.
Mr. busbey'a dignity began to feel sore
and Eversman was laughing greatly. Hlnes
looked puzxled.
By the time the car had reached the Post
office department these three high browed
employee of a beneficent government had
decided that each must pay his own fare.
Eversman was the first to hand the con
ductor a nickel, but the collector of fares
refused to take It.
"Your fare's been paid," he said gruffly.
"Who paid It?" asked the three in chorus.
"That gentleman over In the corner,"
said the oonJuotor, turning away. The
gentleman he had pointed out was a total
stranger to the three, and he was laughing
hysterically. For a few momenta the three
Jokers sat in embarrassed sllenca. Evers
man, who likes to have Jokes on other pio
