MARKET FIRM ON
SHORT COVERING
Ucalings Almost Entirely Coir
iincd to Professional
Traders.
STOCKS ARE DISTURBED
JJusiness Failures Reach Point
Where Street Is Badly
' Alarmed.
t Special to Tho Tlmes-DlBpatoli.]
Now York. December 9.?Short cover?
ing held tho market firm to-duy,
causing somo further advonccB. Doal
Ingo were almost entirely professional.
At the close of the session the Steel
Corporation announced an Increaoe of
147.627 tons Im tho volume of unlllled
orders on Its books at tho end of No?
vember, compared with tho end of Oc?
tober. This Is double what tho street
expected. The bank showed u gain
of S10,;>87,350 In actual surplus ut the
close of business Friday night. De?
posits uro roduccd $38.281,000, and
louns reduced ft 5,853,000. Great
Northern Ore certificates and Wabash
were the wenk features.
.Stocks have been disturbed the past
week by ploma for reorganizing Wa?
bash and Alllfl-Chnlmcrs. The dis?
turbance was not caused so much by:
the Importunco of these rcorganlza- j
lions, as by the fact that they come
ill li time when business failures In
general urc so numerous as to be :
startling. Tho November failures are |
about the worst since lft'i", and De?
cember failures promise to be fully
as bad, both in number of firms and
in volume of capital.
On the constructive- side of the mar- ]
k*t n deal was announced
whereby New Tork Central gets control I
>>t Ontario and Western, taking it from j
the New Haven, which will take con?
trol of the Rutland Railroad from the
New York Central. This deal gives l
New Haven a direct line to Montreal, j
and gives the New York Central n
greater control over the anthracite
business. The deal cannot he con?
summated until the public service com?
mission grants permission, nnd that
permission ban been asked.
Money remained high, lending early
in the week at 5 per cent., and touch?
ing a high point of 5 1-'.' per cent. Fri?
day. The mysterious loss of cash re?
ported by the banks the previous week
was explained by Faying that gold en?
gaged for export to Canada had been
subtracted from tho cash In advastco
? >n the name principle that when a
check it. certified the certification Is
subtracted from the account against
which It Is drawn.
President Taft's message was favor- |
ably received by tiie street, particular?
ly BO by Insiders of the American To?
bacco Company. The President's de
hcription of the settlement of the to?
bacco trust caee as the best possible
was heartily concured in by the to?
bacco people. All tobacco subsidiaries,
have been strong throughout the week
and a deal of Importance Is expected
In connection with the United Clgat
Htnrcs Company, which will be re?
organized and become a manufactur?
ing, as well as a selling concern.
J-tandard Oil subsidiaries were also
? iitoted separately for the first time,
but hankers aru advising minority
stockholders to hold everything until
a market Is developed that will glv*
nome correct Iden of the proper price
iit w-hlch to sell. It Is announced that
persons holding less than a full share
will not be permitted to vote.
Wlnslow S, Pierce was made chair?
man of the reorganization committee
for the Wabash Road and the Equitable
Trust Company as trustee of Its mort?
gage exercised Its privilege of ap- i
pointing a majority of the board of
directors. The company Is understood
to need ?10,000.000 spot cash. Kuhn.
Ixieb & Co. are Interested In the re- j
organization plans.
While the most conservative peo?
ple In the street look for a further ,
ileclln In the stock market they at?
tach great Importance to the fact thai
there have been heavy rains and snows
recently all over the country. The
government reports a slightly smaller
planting of winter wheat, but the dry
weather prevented or discouraged
farmers from putting in their usual
acreage. This, however, will be made
up with spring wheat and other crops, 1
and the heavy rains. If they continue,
will within three months wash out all
the trace of panic from business and
the stock market. Iiy that time the
radicals in Congress will have dis?
closed their worst intentions, nnd the
conservatives will have had an oppor?
tunity to show what they can do in
the way of settling the trust problem
so as to encourage the resumption of
business.
On the Curb.
Tobacco stocks developed further
weakness on tho curb to-day, and all
Issues declined materially. Copper
shares were heavy. Precious metals
were slightly higher.

COTTON MARKETS.
New York. December 9.?The cotton mar?
ket was tosicr to-dty on coverlag by yester?
day's sellers and realizing by older ?hon?
lor o\.;r the government's estimate ot tho
crop report which I? 'lue on Monday, and
the close was steady at an advance of 15/5
points. The market opened steady at a de
t line of I point on January, but generally
20* points higher on bolter cables than ex
pectcd and a result ot covering. Inspired, j
both by the' relativ? firmness of Liverpool'
und bullish week-end ngures. Tho South,
wo? a seller on the Initial advance, and at j
times local bears were quite aggressive, but (
after working off to about the closing ne?
uro* of last night during tho middle of the I
morning the market steadied up again on j
continued covering, and at one time show- .
ed a net advance of I or 5 points on the,
active positions. Closing prices were with- j
In '-' or 3 points ot the top. Private cables .
attributed the relatively arm showing of
Liverpool to heavy continental buying and
reports ol a better trade In Manchester, i
with the action ot the markot alto suggest-j
Ing that the ginning report of yesterday I
had failed to materially alter the average
(orolgn view of tho probable crop. Aside
from the cables and the week-end figures
thore seemed to be nothing In the news to
help the market, and many reports contin?
ued to come In from the South Indicating
continued activity In the matter of ginning i
knd also much cotton remaining In tho I
fields to be picked. Houses with foreign
connection were good buyei? again to-day.
Receipts for the week 4?,0v0 bales against
??,657 lost week and 427.8 t'J last year. To?
day's receipts at New Orleans 10.4SJ bales
against 16.351 last year, and at Galveston
U.26! bales against 17.711 last year, and at

Now Orleans. La., December 9.?Cotton
futures opened steady at an advu.ice of 2<&t|
points on good cables. The close was |
I steady and unchanged to 3 points up. The.
weather map was called unfavorable, as too!
much rain was reported In the. Central and I
Eastern sections of the cotton region. This
led to some buying on the theory that pick?
ing, und therefore ginning, wus being inter-1
fered with. Sellers of yesterday were in?
clined to take protlts, which furnished a
moderate dcmiinri Immediately aftcvr the ?
mil, when the trading months were 4'a?j
points up. Liquidation of tho long account
started here, and the market did not hold.
At the end of the first half hour of busi?
ness pricosc wero 1?3 points over yester?
day's final quotations.
From the middle of tho morning on ex-1
trcmo dullnees ruled. Commission houses
had a few buying ordors to nil, and these
Steadied tho market. Tho most active
months stood still at yesterday's closing
level for somo time. Several large crop es?
timates from crop bureaus and private
sources mado their appearance, but did not
cause any selling of consequence. The
forecast of unsottlcd weather and rain In
the cotton region over Sunday brought out
a limited amount or buying. Spot quiet

CLAREMONT GETS
RIGHTTOJROIII
.Strong Company Organized to
Make Great Town on the
Lower James.
A very interesting local Item pub?
lished exclusively lu The Timcs-Dls
patch a few days ago, told of the In
cororatlon of the Rlchmond-Claremont
Norfolk Real Estate Company. This
company, which has ample capital be?
hind It, will have Richmond ofllces,
Julian W. Tyler, one among Hie best
known of Richmond business men, be?
ing the president and a liirgc stock?
holder. It Is understood that this
company is not strictly a real estutc
ngency, us Its name might Imply, but
rather a development company, Its real
object In tho end being to make the
good little town of Clarcmont on the
James River, and In Surry county, the
Industrial and business centre that
nature seems to have marked It for.
The company has acquired a vast deal
of the farming and Industrial proper
tics In and around the town, and they
propose to develop the same; to offer
big Inducements to new enterprises,
and to farm developers.
Claremont Is nnttirally a good town,
being nt the head of high water on
the .lames and nt a point where the
biggest ships can land und load and
unload. It Is n line place for Indus?
trial development, and Iras long been
a wonder why It has not developed
Into the big Illing that nature seems
to have Intended It to be. Willi river
und Maler transportation that Is
superb, and with railway facilities
there Is n" reason why Claremont
should not hi' the city that the origi?
nators of the railway to that point
thought some twenty years age It
should be. The new company, headed
by some of tho best business talent
In three cities, will sec to It that
Claremont shall be the town naturo
intended It to be.
Tho new company has ample capital
to prove Its faith, and Its other good
oflle.ers are. 11. J. Arrlngton, vice-presi?
