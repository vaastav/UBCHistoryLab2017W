Twenty-one tramps, who had been sent
to jail for ten days under the vagrant
struck tbis morning and refused to
work. When the jail officials were pre
t aring to seud them out the prisoners
pretended they were willing to work
but objected to being shackled. A
telephone message was sent to the
Mayor asking him to allow them to be
-;aken out of jail without the balls and
chains and the request was denied. He
was told that the city had but eight
pairs of schackle and that it would be
impossible to secure all the prisoners,
aud tin- Mayor decided to bring out to
day as many as could be shackled aud
to-morrow and the next day the others
could be brought out, thus forming re?
lays. When the decision was commu?
nicated to the prisoners they all with
one accord struck, refusing positively
to do any work for the city. A squad
of policemeu was sent to the jail and
the strikers brought to the station
house and locked up on bread and wa?
ter. Of course, the plan of the prison?
ers was to get into the streets without
the balls and chains and run away.
Tnere is but one way to end the chronic
trouble with insubordinate members of
ih? chain gang?and that is for Council
.o come to the rescue with a tlogging
act, which the State law gives them the
power to pass.
Police Court.?The following cases
disposed of this moruing :
Sallie and George Williams, both col?
ored, arrested by Officers Knight and
- charged with disorderly conduct
and abusive language toward some col
?red relatives, were fined ?2 each.

Will Tat the King Street Sewer.
The government authorities in this city
liHve formally decided to abaudon the
present St. Asaph street sewer and tap
the one recently constructed by the city
ou King street. Mr. Thomas W. Robin
boh, custodian of the custom house,
has received the specifications which
provide for an eight-inch terra cotta
pipe from th? custom house building to
King street. Proposals will be received
ot once aud the work prosecuted at
soon as possible. The proposition to
run the sewer down St. Asaph street
ami into Duke was rejected, as it would
be uece-sary to tear up seveml squat es
to carry out that plan, while in order to
carry the sewer to King street a much
shorter route is presented with a satis?
factory tall, as there is a down grade
almost all the way from the custom
house. The government will, of course,
pay the city lor the privilege of tapping
its sewer, and that, to be "built for the
use of the custom house will be a strictly
private affair which no one will be al?
lowed to tap.

The M. P. Church.?The services at
the M. P. Church yesterday were well
attended, especially the nii>ht service,
when nearly every available seat was
occupied. Rev. F. T. Benson preach?
ed from the text, "Stand not in
the way of Sinners," and taking
for his subject the "Curbstone to
the Gutter," he spoke of the large
number of young men who idle
away their time congregating on
the street corners. "Pass along the
street when you will, day or nieht, dur?
ing the week or on Sunday, you see
these same people on the curbstones,
using profane language or engaging in
unholy jests." He exhorted men to
keep away from such ungodly associa?
tions and try to make something of
themselves, improving their talents; ac?
cept Christ as their Saviour and walk
in the way of the righteous. The re
vival services closed with last night's
meeting, having lasted for five weeks,
accomplishing great good and adding 48
souls to the kingdom of Christ. Twen?
ty-five have thus far united with tho

played of an attractive kind for pres?

general public will not be slow to be?

stores and their progressive methods.
The holiday season which is now upon
us gives the merchants ample scope to
tastefully display their wares and so?
licit trade by their most seductive
methods. The shrewd advertisers,
those who advertise honestly and per?
sistently, are the ones whose stores at
all times are well patronized.

she acted sullenly and would not prom?
ise him that she would stay home. It
was found necessary to send her to the

It may be worth something to know
that the very best medicine for restor?
ing the tired out nervous system to a
healthy vigor is Eleotric Bitters. This
medicine is purely vecetable, acts by
giving tone to the nerve centres in the
stomach, gently stimulates the Liver
and Kidneys, and aids these organs in
throwing off impurities in the blood.
Electric Bitters improves the appetite,
aids digestion, and is pronounced by
those who bay* tried it as the very best
blood purifier and nerve t?me. Try it.
