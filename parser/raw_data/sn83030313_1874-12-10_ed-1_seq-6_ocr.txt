New York, Thoriday, Dm* 10, 1874.
From our reports this morning the probabilities
are that the weather to-day will be cool and gen
erally clear.
Wall Street Yesterday.?The stock mar
ket was - without important feature. Gold
opened and closed at 110J. Money on call
was quoted at 2) a 3 per cent. Foreign ex
change was heavy.
Sunday Amusements.?A motion made in
Court on behalf of Mr. Strakosch to restrain
the police from interfering with his Sunday
performances has been denied. This action
does not, however, materially alter the ques
tion of the legality of Sunday performances,
which will be argued regularly before the
courts. It is important only as conferring
discretionary power on the police until such
time as the question has been finally decided
by the courts of appeal.
The Bill Introduced by Mr. West, of
Louisiana, providing for the construction of a
United States postal telegraph line between
Washington and Boston by way of Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York and Hartford, is the
pioneer movement of the postal telegraph sys
tem in this country. The proposed line is in
tended to test the practical operation of a
system here which has bsen found to work
advantageously to the publio in Europe.
While there may be differences of opinion as
to the expedi?ncy of placing the telegraphic
business under the control of the government
there ought to be no objection to the test pro
posed by Mr. West's bill. Let us see how a
government telegraph between the designated
points works, and we shall then be in a better
position to judi<e of the wisdom of bringing
the whole telegraphic business of the country
within the jurisdiction of the Post Office De
partment as a national undertaking.
The Von Abnxm Casb in Court.?Bismarck
and Von Arnim have at last come to close
quarters. The Prussian Chancellor has opened
fire with all his batteries and the struggle for
power must soon be decided for or against
the parties. The Indictments are divided into
three heads?the $propriating of papers that
Von Arnim claims as personal, the disap
pearance of others, of which he denies
&11 knowledge, and finally the carrying off
t>f papers since returned. The indictment
c .arges that Von Arnim admitted writings
letter to Dfillinger, but denies that he was
a ponsible for the publication of facts relat
ang to diplomatic movements whioh found
t: e'r way into the newspapers. The struggle
i.* uow fairly engaged, and should Bismarck
la 1 to seenrs the condemnation of his op
jv< at his own influence will probably suffer.
Whatever the result he has damaged himself
in the estimation of Europe by the harsh and
arb.trary course he has pursued toward

Th? First Debit* of tk? 8?mIo>
ilk* Finaaeei.
Wo do not concur in the view exprwwed
in Uie House by Mr. Cox that currency
discussion* at this session can produce
only mischief and ought to be avoided. He
is, doubtless, correct in his opinion that such
discussions will lead to no legislation in tbe
divided state of opinion on this subject in
Congress, but we cannot accept his inlerence
that to debate it will unsettle business by
diffusing a feeling of uncertainty. If Mr. Cox
would allow that the business community is
as intelligent as hi in sell he would see that
they are as cajwble of judging whether Con
gress will legislate on the currenoy as he is,
and that debates which are certain to result
in nothing cannot be a disturbing element in
their calculations. Discussion can do no
great harm even if it docs no good. As to
legislation the way is effectually blocked on the
side of the greatest danger. If an inflation
bill should pass it would be stranded on the
President's inevitable veto; so, let Congress
do what it will, business is subject to no kind
of uncertainty on that side. Legislation in
the other direction is more to be desired than
expected. It ought to be rather a ground of
hope than alarm. But no such good fortune
awaits the country at present The course of
business will not be materially affected by the
abortive projects or heated discussions of the
present session. They will be beneficial in
keeping a great subject before the public mind
and contributing to the public education. We
shall never reach a sound currency except as
the result of widespread popular agitation,
and the debates in Congress, however wild
and absurd, lift the subject into prominence
and enable the press to hold public attention
while exposing inflation sophistries and main
taining sound principles. The more discus
sion tbe better, both in Congress and out
of it; for truth always gains by opportunities
to grapple with error. We there lore totally
dissent from the view of Mr. Cox, who wishes
the problem to be silently passed over to a
democratic Congress. The democratic party
needs a great deal of education on this sub
ject, and every occasion should be improved
for so enlightening public opinion as to mako
future legislation easy.
This currency debate, though precipitated
on a supremely foolish measure, may be of
some service in developing, at an early stage
of the session, the relative strength of the in
flationists and resumptionsta ant showing to
what extent the elections have changed the
position of members. It will be found, we
suspect, that there has been no considerable
chauge since the last session, and as soon as
this is demonstrated it will be clear to every
body that President Grant's financial recom
mendations are a failure. If members adhere
to their former views it is too evident that the
majority who werd foiled by the veto
will successfully withstand all legislation
looking toward specie payments. That
majority was, indeed, made up of inflation
ist democrats as well as inflationist republi
cans, and it is quite suppoeable that some of
the democrats may incline to waver. But
the party leaders are unwilling they should
be put to the test, and it is in that view that
Mr. Cox remonstrated against any action or
discussion at this session, shrewdly masking
his purpose under a pretence that such de
bates tend to disturb and unsettle business.
The democratic leaders hope that by postpon
ing the subject they can let their own infla
tionists down easy and pave the way for an
appearance of party unity at the next session.
They are unwilling, on one hand, that the re
publicans should have the credit of sound
measures, and, on the other hand, they shrink
from a new exposure of the democratic
division on this question. It is, accordingly,
the democratic policy to defeat all financial
legislation, whether good or bad, at this ses
sion, and the irreconcilable differences among
the republican members will render this an
easy task.
It is noteworthy that the first discussion of
the session has sprung up on a proposition
which flies in the very teeth of the President's
recommendations. Mr. Kelley's bill bids bold
defiance to the policy of the President The
resolute promptness with which he called it
up illustrates the weakness of party discipline
among the republicans and notifies the coun
try that the President has no personal or i
officiil control over a large section of his
nominal supporters. The inflationists in Con
gress have practically renounced their alle
giance to the President, and are ready to
oppose him with as little scruple or respect as
the ^constructionists exhibited lor Andrew
Johnson. The ordinary forms of respect tor
j a President of their own party should have
; held the republican inflationists in check
until the recommendations of the Message had
| been referred to the appropriate committees
and time had been given for maturing and re
porting suitable bills. But instead of this
they hasten to meet the President on the
frontier and fling down the gauntlet of defi
ance. Their unflinching opposition and the
unwillingness of the democrats to act on the
subject at all confirm the foregone belief that
there will be no financial legislation during
the present session.
Kelley's bill is foolishness itself, but we hope
it will be brought to a vote in order that the
country may see how many of the republican
members are prepared to go to extreme lengths
in thwarting the policy of the President We
trust there it no possibility of so insane a
measure passing the House; but the vote on
it, if it comes to a vote, will be an instructive
indication of the want of coherence in the re
publican majority. Of all new ways to
pay old debts Kelley's scheme is the
most grotesque and preposterous. The
bonds and the greenbacks which he
proposes to make constantly interchange
able are alike evidences of debt against
the United States. In both the gov
ernment promises to pay so many dollars to
the holder. Mow, when the greenbacks are
presented for payment it is proposed to dis
charge the debt by giving an equal amount of
bonds, and when, the next day or the next
week, the bonds are presented for payment, it
is proposed to discharge them by giving the
government creditors an equal amount of
greenbacks, and so on, without limit of time
or any other provision for payment. It is the
same as if a debtor who owes you a large sum
on book account offers to pay by giving his
note on demand and stipulates to pay the
note by taking it up whenever you wish, and
again charging you an equal sum on his
books, offerina to reciorocate these forms as
often as yon want to be paid, bat nerw">r
any other steps to discharge the obl^ 'lltlon
Such a hocus-|>ocus is no payment, ^iut a
trifling with the patience and an insult to* *^e
understandings of creditors.
Ibis precious scheme is as objectionable in
form as it is ridiculous in substance. Even
from its own standpoint, that greenbacks are
money lent to the government, the process is
cumbrous and absurd. Supposing groen
backs to be money the scheme converts the
Treasury into a savings bank fox keeping the
spare money of the people and paying it back
: on demand, with a moderate interest Why,
then, use the clumsy machinery of bonds in
stead of simply keeping an aoeount with the
depositors? A bond is a form of obligation
given for debts having a considerable time to
run. It is ridiculous to resort to the formality
of bonds for debts payable on demand. The
scheme is preposterous in another view. The
inflationists have all along been oontending
that we have no excess of currency for the
busy part of every year, when the grain and
cotton crops are seeking markets. By
their own showing, then, every dollar
of the greenbacks would be called
back into circulation for a considerable por
tion of each year. What, then, becomes of
Kelley's argument and Butler's argument that
the greenbacks reoeived for the interchange
able bonds could be employed in redeeming
the six per cent public debt and thereby fund
ing it at a lower rate of interest T When the
new bonds were all returned to the Treasury
in August and September how could the gov
ernment pay them on demand if it had parted
with the means of doing so by purchasing
five-twenty bonds? The scheme is really too
absurd for serious argument, and we are curi
ous to see what proportion of the members of
the House are crazy enough to vote for it.
Snch a vote would be a gauge of legislative
folly.
The Tram it of Venua.
Scarcely had the wonderful event of astro
nomical history passed its closing stages yes
terday morning when the multitude of scien
tists scattered over the face of the globe hur
ried to grasp the electric chains that
branch through the continents in order
to convey to the anxious hearts of
the scientific world the results of their
patient and energetic labors. From many of
the isolated islands that seem to the mind's eye
to be fixed away beyond the confines of earth
itself, it is true that instant communications
do not come. But from regions hitherto un
explored and impervious to the progress of the
traveller the marvellous tongue of the
telegraph speaks to us across the ocean and
the continents of the genius, the progress
and the successful labors of the glorious army
that went forth many months ago to perform
the wondrous operations soon to result
in such benefit to the human race.
Who would have imagined, one hun
dred years ago, that in tracts
of territory among the Oriental climes, sep
arated from us by mountains, rivers, oceans
and continents, events of vital moment to
men would transpire and the news thereof be
carried to the remotest ends of the earth within
the limits of a single day ? This has never
been realized to such an extent aB in the case
of the observations of the long-waited for
transit of Venus. From the extreme recesses of
Siberia, the most distant regions of China,
from Africa's desert bosom and from the shores
of the Empire of Japan, the intelligence
reached us last night of the varied
suocess of the astronomers in scrutiniz
ing the transit yesterday. Our cable de
spatches to-day furnish ample testimony
to the resistless march of science and civiliza
tion, and the part which the press deems it an
honor to take therein, by Riving to the world
with a promptitude and precision unsur
passed, the fullest details of every struggle
fought and every laurel won by the
votaries of science and the friends
of progress and human freedom. We
publish to-day, particulars of the work done
by many ot the astronomers throughout the
world, especially by those in whom Ameri
cans take a special interest These have, in
every place where it was possible to do so,
made the most accurate measurements with
the micrometer, the result of which will be
that the planet's track will be known with
perfect accuraoy. They have taken photo
graphs which will aid them in this work, and
they Beem to have determined with surprising
accuracy the exact locations of their respec
tive stations. Thus nothing has been
left undone to have America play as
prominent a part in this grand scientific
labor as possible. And when the results
are made known it maft^be found that we
will have ample reason fb rejoice in having
sent forth our own army of observers, whose
fame for success in this enterprise will not be
less than that of more pretentions scientists.
The New Yobs Senatobshtp.?A corre
spondent of one of our contemporaries intro
duces an interesting feature into the contest
for the Senatorship. This correspondent says
that the liberal republicans bold the balance
of power in the next Legislature and may
control the election of United States Senator,
and that among these liberal republicans there
is no statesman who could control the repub
lican vote so effectively as Colonel Frederick
A. Conkling.
This gentleman served in Congress some
years since, and has been a candidate for a
great many offices with the same success that
attended Henry Clay and Daniel Webster in
their aspirations to the Presidency. If Mr.
Conkling should be elected to the Sonate we
should have the romantic spectacle of two
brothers representing the State, each beading
rival political organizations. On reflection
we think this is a very wise arrangement
During the time of the Scottish civil wars
the cautious landowner sent one of his sons
into the army of the sovereign and the other
into the army of the rebels, so that which
ever side won the estates remained in the
family.
pedzstbianum.?Professor Judd continues
his undertaking with unflagging courage. He
has already walked over two hundred miles
and feels confident that he will succeed. Con
siderable interest is felt in the Professor's ex
periment, and he is visited daily by large
numbers of ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Judd'i
powers of endurance have been severely tried
on former occasions, and if ths feat he has
undertaken be not beyond human ability to
perform he will probably achieve success.

esting communications ooncerning the war of
races which has broken oat in Mississippi

The taxpayers, therafipre, requested his

seems to have greatly modified bis

The editor of the Vicksburg Herald tele
graphs us these facts on behalf of the white

On the other hand Governor Ames sees in
the refusal of the white people of Vioksburg
to allow Mr. Crosby to act as Sheriff without
giving bonds an attack on the equal rights

Tfie Railroad gclumtri at the Frank
Although the session has bat jast opened
the petitions for railroad grants are already
besieging Congress. The Texas and Pacific
and Atlantic and Pacific Companies have
joined their forces, and through Thomas A.
Scott and A. Pierce, Jr., their respective pres
idents, have presented a memorial, of which
the substance will be found in our news col
umns. All their arguments are specious fal
lacies; but even if these begging roads had a
better claim to national bounty the condition
of the Treasury and the heavy load of debt
under whioh the country is staggering would
be a conclusive reason not merely for denying
their petition but for refusing even to con
sider it It is not to be tolerated that the
weight of our oppressive taxes should be in
creased for building railroads through long
stretches of wilderness with scarcely an in
habitant The memorialists declare that they
rest their cause solely on their arguments and
will not attempt to use personal influence
with the members. This shows a wholesome
sense of the odium into which the lobby has
fallen and the felt necessity of putting on
a mask at their first appearance. But the
mask will soon drop if Congress consents to
give them a hearing.
The objections to the whole proposed sys
tem of railway legislation may be summed up
in our objections to this memorial. In the
first place, these roads are to be built through
a country without agricultural resources, with
out population, without business. In the
second place, the government credit is asked
for forty thousand dollars the mile when a
great many Western railroads have been
built upon the credit of twenty thou
sand dollars per mile. In return for
this credit the company proposes to give
to the government only a part of what it
receives from the government If the com
pany Bhould become bankrupt then the
whole business of managing the railroad
would fall directly upon the government
Unless we change our whole policy toward our
railroad system this is the one thing to be
particularly avoided. Finally, there is no
guarantee that the government would not be
swindled as it was swindled by the builders of
the present railway, who, after they had ob
tained credit from the United States for their
road, built it as cheaply as possible, and di
vided the government subsidy among them
selves at the rate of "eight hundred per cent
dividends" on Credit Mobilier stock.
The truth is that the whole Credit Mobilier
experience convinces us that it is impossible
for any honest system of legislation in lavor of
Pacific railways to pass through Congress. This
is because the whole proposed system is, in it
self, dishonest Corporations which have noth
ing whatever, not even credit, which have not
advanced a dollar in capital stock, which *a!ta
none of the ordinary business risks of enter
prise, come to the government and ask to be
endowed with its credit, ita lands, and to be
put in possession of a vast interest It is not
the function of the government to give land to
defunct corporations or to give substance to
imaginary enterprises. All the profit in this
enterprise?if there is any profit?goes to the
corporator. All the loss?if there is any loss?
fails upon the government Wherever a govern
ment has attempted to strengthen with its oredit
private corporations, not only in America but
in Canada, we have seen scandals, embarrass
ments and corruption. The whole system on
which it is proposed to build railways to the
Pacific is wrong. We can see no possible good
in any of these schemes. There is no surer
way for the republican party to increase the
volume of the "tidal wave" which came with
the last canvass than to identify itself with
these measures. If President Grant is as
alive to the interests of the country and his
own fame as he was on inflation he will crush
them with his veto ?s firmly as he crushed re
pudiation.
Lafayette's Watch.?Minister Washburne
performed yesterday a pleasing duty In re
storing to the family of Lafayette the watch
presented to him by Congress, and which was
stolen from him in this country. Borne time
ago it was reoovered, and the government sent
it to France for restoration to Lafayette's
family. This pleasant ceremony was made
an occasion for the interchange of
expressions of good will on the
part of representatives of both coun
tries. The memory of Lafayette is guarded
with eqqal veneration both in France and

The Beeeher-TUtoa S??a4?l.
What has been known so long as the
"Beeoher-Tilton scandal" bids Hair to be
known as the "Beecher-Tilton comedy." If
so dreary a story could have an amusing side
nothing would be more so than the tactics of
the lawyers who are managing the case. First,
the Brooklyn Oourt opens. Here the
issue is the civil suit of Tilton against
Beecher for one hundred thousand dol
kws. In this all the evidence that has
been printed?letters,, statements, conversa
tions?will be brought*.out, and Tilton will
have his whols story under oath. Conse
quently he is anxious to have this tried first
It is his strongest esse, and victory or defeat
in it will be victory or defeat in the whole
proceeding. Accordingly the Tilton law
yers rise and scream for "immediate trial;"
the Beecher lawyers rise and say that they
cannot ''sacrifice the rights of their client to
popular clamor," or to "trial by newspapers."
So ends the first act of the comedy.
Then the federal Oourt opens. The issue
here is between Miss Edna Dean Proctor and
Francis D. Moulton, Miss Proctor claiming
that she has been cruelly and wantonly libelled,
and also asking one hundred thousand dollars
damages. This issue is simply a side event
in the Beecher scandaL The evidence in
favor of Moulton is weak compared to that in
favor of Tilton, and, as there has always
been a prospect of a verdict against the "mu
tual friend," the Beecher people thought that
such a verdict would prove a moral triumph
to their cause. Consequently the Beecher
counsel, who clamored for delay in the Brook
lyn Court, came into the Rhadamanthine pres
ence of Judge Woodruff and insisted upon
"immediate trial." The Tilton lawyers, who
had been pathetically picturing the agonies
of their client at the prolonged delays of
Brooklyn justice, insisted that the "rights
of their cause should not be sacrificed to popu
lar clamor." This preliminary Bkirmish has
ended in the rout of the "mutual friend,"
who, by agreement of counsel before the
referee, oonsenta to pay a sum of money in
compensation for a technical libel. In ac
oepting the referee's decision General Butler,
of counsel for the defence, stated that while
admitting the technical libel they did not
mean to admit that the statement had not
been made to them.
Seriously speaking, it is time this oomedy
should end. We are glad it is now at last in
a fair way of settlement No man in this
country is more interested in the termination
of the cause than Mr. Beecher. After all, he
is the person on trial. It makes compara
tively little differenoe to the country what bo
comes of the other parties involved if ruin is
to fall upon the head of this extraordinary,
gifted, and either atrociously sinning or
cruelly Binned against citizen.
CoB|riumM as Attorntji?Mr. Beck's
"Bell Puneh."
The bill offered by Mr. Beok, of Kentucky,
forbidding members of Congress, under heavy
penalties, to serve as counsel for clients having
claims against the government is a necessary
but humiliating measure. The need of such
a prohibition, enforced by penalties, marks the
degeneracy of Congressional morals. The
self-respect of members and their sense of
personal honor ought to bta sufficient guar
antee against this abuse of their trust There
is no good reason why members of Congress
who are lawyers should not argue ordi
nary private oases before the Supreme
Court or other tribunals. Webster,
Pinckney, Clay and other eminent men
always did this without reproach, but they
would have shrunk with recoiling delicacy
and a sense of insult from the offer of a re
tainer to argue against the government a case
relating to any matter on whioh they might be
called to act as legislators. They would as
soon have accepted a fee to go into a court
and argue money out of the pookets of their
own fathers.
But although Mr. Beck's proposed bell
punch for Congressmen is a badge of degra
dation which bears witness to a painful de
cline of legislative honor we trust he will
succeed in getting it adopted, and that those
whom it is meant to restrain may not suc
ceed in ciroumventing it as some of the car
conductors supplied themselves with false
bell punches, ftrhich gave the sound,
but enabled them to defraud their employers.
We prefer not to go into the recital of well
known instances in which prominent Senators
and members of the House have taken large
fees for this kind of service which it is the
purpose of Mr. Beck's bill to prevent It
would give us no pleasure and be of no advan
tage to the publio to put individual members
to shame, and we trust it may not be necessary
to do this as a means of correcting the eviL
Let the bell punch be put impartially into the
hands of all, and there will be no need of indi
vidual accusations. Each member will be at
liberty to class himself among the honest ones
who might safely be left to be a law unto
themselves.
Steamboat Racing.
The inrestigation by the "local inspec
tors of steamers" into the collision be
tween the Harlem and Sylvan Olen steam
boats, has resulted in one of those farcical de
cisions which render any punishment of per
sons endangering the lives of the publio quite
hopeless. The Inspectors, it appears, after
weary labor, came to the conclusion that
pilots and steamboat captains, in charge of
river steamboats, are in the habit of breaking
the laws enacted for the protection of the lives
of passengers. Every one who has sailed on
one of these boats to llarlem knows this faot
quite well, though it took the Inspec
tors of Steamboats, who are supposed
to know all about suoh matters, so
long to find it out In the case brought
under theiz notice the public required that
more than a mild censure should fail on the
guilty. It was a case in which the full penalty
of the law should have been Inflicted. But
the inspectors finding it impossible to white
wash the offenders, instead of putting the law
in force, simply give notice that on some
future occasion the law may be vindicated.
The publio have a right to ask why the guilty
should not be punished in this instance as
well as in some future case. Why should the
aw panish a man to-morrow for what it
tamely censures another man to-day? Will
the Inspectors rise to explain?
Th? Civil Rerrle*.
There van just the least bit of temper in
that part of the President's Message referring
to the civil service. The President says, prac
tically, that he had done all in his power to
secure this wise reform; that Congress had
hindered him; that unless Congress gate him
the legislation necessary to enforce it ha
would abandon the whole scheme. No doubt
the President feels that it would be the crown
and jewel of his administration to introdnoo
the civil service into the government. At the
same time he should remember that he hint*
self, in the transfer of General Sharpe from
the Marshal's office to the Surveyorship, and
the consequent resignation of Mr. Curtis from
the Commission, gave his own plan the first,
and, we think, the fatal blow. If, howsret^
he has any doubt about this Congress passing
the necessary legislation let him wait another
year and sea what the democrats will do.
They oome into power pledged to oivil service
reform. Mr. Tilden means to introduce it
into New York, where there are more officer*
in the various departments of the govern
ment than in many of the monarchies of Eu
rope. The President should not abandon tha
reform because his party abandons it Let
him clin^ 40 ?ivil service reform, or so much
of it as is left, and see what the democrats
will do when they come into power.
Til* Indian Question Again* -
We observe that a motion has been intro
duced into Congress to "extinguish the rights
of the Indians to their reservation in the Black'
Hill country." This means that our federal
troops have found gold in thie region, and'
that the Indians are to be driven oat in order
that the white men may go in and dig for
gold. We suppose that the inevitable ten
dency of civilization will be to remove the
tribes. But we never see a suggestion of this
kind without wishing that our government
had statesmanship enough to adopt a sound
policy of dealing with the aborigines.
The President began his administration with
the best intentions on this subject Wo
wish we oould feel that these intentions had
been sustained. But the Indian Bing?and
there is none more shameless in the history
of corruption, because it lives upon the plun
der of the ignorant and helpless savage?is
stronger to-day in Washington than it has
been at any time in our history. "Manifest
destiny"?by which swelling phrase we gen
erally mean national selfishness?points to
the extinction of the Indian race. At tha
same time it is a cruel and cowardly thing
that as a government, we have never yet
made a serious effort to treat the Indian
tribes with justice and humanity. It will bo
a good time to begin fair dealing in settling
this Black Hill question.
