ROOM! TO
THE LAWMAKERS
President Says Financial Stand
ing of Nation Is Excellent
—Taxes Reduced.
Repeats Recommendations Re*
garding Corporations Doing
Interstate Business.
The following is a synopsis of the
president's message to congress:
The financial standing of the nation
at the present time is excellent, and
the financial management of the na
tion's interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown
most satisfactory results. But our cur
rency system is imperfect, and it is
earnestly to be hoped that t'ne cur
rency commission will be able to pro
pose a thoroughly good system which
will do away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1. 1901,
to Sept. SO. 1908. the balance between
the net ordinary receipts and the net
ordinary expenses of the government
showed a surplus of nearly $100,000,000
of receipts over expenditures, a reduc
tion of the interest bearing debt by
$90.000,0O0. in spite of the extraordi
nary expense of the Panama canal, and
a saving of nearly nine millions on the
annual interest charge. There have
been no new taxes on the contrary,
some taxes have been taken off there
has been a reduction of taxation.
As regards the great corporations
engaged in interstate business, and es
pecially the railroads, 1 can only re
peat what I have al-
Corporations ready again and
again said in my
messages to congress. I believe that
tinder the interstate clause of the con
stitution the United States has com
plete and paramount right to control
all agencies of interstate commerce,
and I believe that the national govern
ment alone can exercise this right with
wisdom and effectiveness, so as both
to secure justice from, and to do jus
tice to, the great corporations which
are the most important factors in mod
ern business. I believe that it is worse
than folly to attempt to prohibit all
combinations as is done by the Sher
man anti-trust law. because such a
law can be enforced only imperfectly
and unequally, and its enforcement
works almost as much hardship as
good. I strongly advocate that instead
of an unwise effort to prohibit all com
binations. there shall be substituted a
law which shall expr.-sslv permit com
binations which are in the interest of
the public, but shall at the same time
give to some agency of the national
government full power of control and
supervision over them. One of the
chief features of this control should be
securing entire publicity in all matters
which the public has a right to know,
and furthermore, the power, not In
judicial, but by oxoeutive action, to
prevent or put a stop to every form of
improper favoritism or other wrong
doing.
The railroads of the country should
be put completely under the interstate
commerce commission and removed
from the domain of the anti-trust law.
The power of the commission should be
made thoroughgoing, so that it could
exercise complete supervision and con
trol over the issue of securities as well
as over the raising and lowering of
rates. As regards rates, at least, this
power should be summary. The power
to investigate the financial operations
and accounts of the railways has been
one of the most valuable features in
recent legislation. Power to make
combinations and traffic agreements
should be explicitly conferred upon the
railroads, the permission of the com
mission being first gained and the com
bination or agreement being published
in all Its details. In the interest of
the public the representatives of the
public should have complete power to
see that the railroads do their duty by
the public, and as a matter of course
this power should also be exercised so
as to see that no injustice is done the
railroads. The shareholders, the em
ployes and the shippers all have inter
ests that must be guarded. It is to
the interest of all of them that no
swindling stock speculation should be
allowed, and that there should be no
improper issuance of securities. There
must be no defrauding of investors,
oppression of farmers and business
men who ship freight, or callous dis
regard of the rights and newels of em
ployes. Rates must he made as low as
is compatible with giving proper re
turns to the shareholders but they
must not. for instance, be reduced In
such a fashion as to necessitate a cut
in the wages of employes or the aboli
tion of the proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies
engaged in interstate business should
be put under the jurisdiction of the in
terstate commerce commission.
The fight against adequate govern
ment control and supervision of indi
vidual, and especially of corporate,
wealth engaged In Interstate business
is chiefly done under cover and espe
cially under cover of an appeal to
state's rights. Forty or fifty separate
state governments cannot exercise con
trol over corporations doing business
In most or all of them. Such divided
authority eannot regulate commerce
with wisdom and effect. The central
government is the only power which,
without oppression, can thoroughly and
adequately control, and supervise the
large- corporations. There is legisla
tion which the federal government
alone can enact and which is absolute
ly vital in order to secure the attain
ment of our purpose. Many laws are
needed. There should be regulation
by the national government of the
great interstate corporations, including
a simple method of account keeping,
publicity, supervision of the Issue of
securities, abolition of rebates and of
special privileges. There should be
short time franchises for all corpora
tions engaged in public business, in
cluding the corporations which get
power from water lights. There should
be national as well as state guardian
ship of mines and forests. The labor
legislation hereinafter referred to
should concurrently be enacted Into
law.
To accomplish this, means, of course,
a certain increase in the use of—not
the creation of—power, by the central
government. The power already ex
ists it does not have to be -created
the only question is whether it shall
be used or left idle—and meanwhile
the corporations over which the power
ought to be exercised will not remain
idle.
Many matters affecting labor and the
status of the wage-worker are called
to the attention of
Labor. congress by the presi
dent. A steady effort
ahould be made, he says, to tiring about
a condition of affairs under which the
men who work with hand or with brain
ahall own a far greater share than at
present of the wealth they produce.
As far as possible he hopes to see a
frank recognition of the advantages
conferred by machinery, organization
and division of labor, accompanied-, by
an effort to bring about a larger share
In the ownership by wage-worker of
railway, mill and factory.
The regulation of the national high
ways must be such that they shall
serve all people with equal justice.
Corporate finances must be supervised
so as to make it far safer than at
present for the man of small means to
invest his money in stocks. There
must be prohibition of child labor
stock watering should be prohibited,
and stock gambling so far as possible
discouraged. There should be a pro
gressive inheritance tax on large for
tunes. Industrial education should be
encouraged. As far as possible we
should lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man. We should put a
premium on thrift, hard work and
business energy. It is eminently right
that the nation should fix the terms
upon which the great fortunes are in
herited. They rarely do good and
they often do harm to those who in
herit them in their entirety. The
above is the merest sketch, hardly even
a sketch in outline, of the reforms for
which we should work. But there Is
one matter with which congress should
deal at this session. There should no
longer be any paltering with the ques
tion of taking care of the wage-work
ers who. under our present industrial
system, become killed, crippled or worn
out as part of the regular incidents of
a given business. The majority of
wage-workers must have their rights
secured for them bv state action but
the national government should legis
late in thoroughgoing and far-reach
ing fashion not only for all employes
of the national government, but for all
persons engaged in interstate com
merce. The object sought for could
be achieved to a measurable degree, as
lar as those killed or crippled are con
cerned. by proper employers' liability
aws. As far as concerns those who
have been worn out. definite steps
toward providing old-age pensions
have been taken in many of our pri
vate industries. To strengthen these
practical measures should be our im
mediate duty. When a workman is
injured what he needs is not an ex
pensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the
certainty of relief through immediate
administrative action.
1
he law passed at the last session of
congress granting compensation to cer
tain classes of employes of the gov
ernment should be extended to include
all employes of the government and
should be made more liberal in its
terms. Congress should without furtlic-r
delay pass a model c-mplovc-rs' liability
law :"or the district of Columbia.
The president recommends that the
principle of the eight-hour day should
as rapidly and aS far as practicable be
extended to the entire work being car
ried on by the government.
The president urges upon congress
the duty of increasing the salaries now
given our judges. Beginning
Courts. with the supreme court, he
says, the judges should have
their salaries doubled.
It is earnestly to be desired that
some m'-ihod should be devised for
doing away with the long delays which
now obtain in the administration of
justice, and which operate with pe
culiar severity against persons of
small means, and ftvor only the very
criminals whom it is most desirable
to punish. These long delavs in the
final decisions of cases make in the
aggregate a crying evil and a renu-dv
should be devised.
Our judicial system is sound and ef
fective at core, and it remains, and
must be maintained, as the safeguard
of those principles of libertv and
justice which stand at the foundation
of American institutions. The presi
dent thinks there is ground for the
belief that substantial injustice is
often suffered by employes in conse
quence of the custom of the courts is
suing temporary injunctions without
notice to them, and punishing for con
tempt of court in instances where, as
a matter of fact, they have no
knowledge of any proceedings. There
is a widespread feeling that this sys
tem often works great injustice to
wageworkers when their efforts to
better their working condition result
In industrial disputes. A temporary
injunction procured ex parte may as
a matter of fact have all the effect of
a permanent injunction In causing
disaster to the wageworker's side in
such a dispute. Organized labor is
chafing under the unjust restraint
which comes from repeated resort to
this plan of procedure. Its discontent
has been unwisely expressed, and
often improperly expressed, but there
is a sound basis for It, and the order
ly and law-abiding people of a com
munity would be in a far stronger
position for upholding the courts if the
undoubtedly existing abuses could be
provided against.
Such proposals as advocated by
some of the extreme labor leaders
contain the vital error of being class
legislation of the most offensive kind,
and even if enacted into law would
rightly be declared unconstitutional.
The power of injunction is a great
equitable remedy, whioh should on no
account be destroyed. But safeguards
should be erected against its abuse
Provision should be made that no in
junction or restraining order issue
otherwise than on notice, except where
irreparable injury would otherwise
result and in such a case a hearing
on the merits of the order should be
had within a short fixed period, and.
if not then continued after hearing It
should forthwith lapse. Decisions
should be rendered immediately, and
the chance of delay minimized in
every way.
If there is any one duty which more
than another we owe it to our chil
dren and our children's
Forests, children to perform at once,
it is to save the forests of
this country, for they constitute the
first and most important, element in
the conservation of the natural re
sources .of the country. Thanks to our
own restlessness in the use of our
splendid forests, we have already
crossed the verge of a timber famine
in this country, and no measures that
we now take can, at least for many
years, undo the mischief being done
and it would be in the highest degree
reprehensible to let any consideration
of temporary convenience or tempo
rary cost interfere with such action,
especially as regards the national
forests which the nation can now, at
this very moment, control.
Nothing should be permitted to
stand in the way of the preservation
of the forests, and it is criminal to
permit individuals to purchase a little
gain for themselves through the de
struction of forests when this destruc
tion is fatal to the wellbeing of the
whole country in the future.
Action should be begun forthwith,
during the present session of congress
for the improvement
Inland of our inland water
Waterways. ways—action which
will result in giving
us not only navigable but navigated
rivers. We have spent hundreds of
millions upon these waterways, yet
the traffic on nearly all of them is
steadily declining. This condition is
the direct result of the absence of any
comprehensive and far-seeing plan of
waterway improvement. It is poor
business to spend money for Inland
navigation unless we got It.
Until tho work of river Improve
ment ia undertaken in a modern way
it can not have results that will meet
the needs of this modern nation.
These needs should be met without
further dilly-dallying or delay. The
plan which promises the best and
quickest results is that of a permanent
commission authorized to co-ordinate
the work of all the government depart
ments relating to waterways, and to
frame and supervise the execution of
a comprehensive plan.
The pure food legislation has al
ready worked a ben
Pure Food. efit difficult to over
estimate.
The president renews his recom
mendation for postal savings banks,
for depositing
Postal savings with the
Savings Banks, security of the
government be
hind them. The object is to encourage
thrift and economy in the wage-earner
and person of moderate means. Postal
savings banks are now in operation in
practically all the great civilized coun
tries with the exception of the United
States.
The establishment of a local parcel
post on rural routes would be to the
mutual benefit of the
Parcel Post, farmer and the
country storekeeper,
and it is desirable that the routes,
serving more than 15.000,000 people
should be utilized to the fullest prac
ticable extent. The postmaster gen
eral estimates that the revenue derived
from the opration of such a system on
all the rural routes would amount to
many million dollars.
The president urges that the request
of the director of the census in connec
tion with the decen-
Census. nial work so soon to
be begun, be com
plied with and that the appointment to
the census force be placed under the
civil service law, waiving geographical
requirements.
All soldiers' homes should be placed
under the complete
Soldiers' control of the war
Homes. department.
The immediate admission of New
Mexico and Arizona as states is ad
vocated by the president. This should
be done, he says, at
Statehood. the present session of
congress. The people
of the two territories have made it evi
dent by their votes that they will not
come in as one state. The only al
ternative is to admit them as two, and
this should be done without delay.
The work on the Panama canal is
being done with speed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty, which make it
a model for all work
Panama Canal, of the kind. Ko
task of such mag
nitude has ever before been undertaken
by any nation: and no task of the
kind has ever been better performed.
The importance of those islands is
apparent, says the president, and the
need of improving their condition is
urgent. The nation-
Hawaii. al government must
provide the neces
sary harbor improvements on each isl
and. so that the agricultural products
can be carried to the markets of the
world. The coastwise shipping laws
should be amended to meet the special
needs of the islands, and the alien
contract labor law should be so modi
fied in its application to Hawaii as to
enable American and European labor
to be brought thither.
The Filipino people, through their
officials, are making real steps in the
direction of self-government. Under
the present system
The Philippines, of just laws and
sympathetic admin
istration. we have every reason to be
lieve that they are gradually acquiring
the character which lies at the basis
of self-government. The president
trusts that within a generation the
time will arrive when the Philippines
can decide for themselves whether it
is well for them to become inde
pendent, or to continue under the pro
tection of a strong and disinterested
power, able to guarantee to the Islands
order at home and protection from
foreign invasion.
The president again recommends that
American citizenship
Porto Rico. be conferred upon
the people of Porto
Rico.
In Cuba our occupancy will cease In
about two months' time the Cubans
have in an orderly manner* elected their
own governmental
Cuba. authorities, and the
islands will be turned
over to them. Our occupation on this
occasion has lasted a little over two
years, and Cuba has thriven and pros
pered under it.
As regards the army the president
calls attention to the fact that while
our junior officers and enlisted men
stand very high, the
The Army. present system of
promotion by senior
ity results in bringing into the higher
grades many men of mediocre capacity,
who have but a short time to serve.
The scope of retiring boards should be
extended so that they could consider
general unfitness to command for any
cause, in order to secute a far more
rigid enforcement than at present in
the elimination of officers for mental,
physical or temperamental disabilities.
But this plan is recommended only if
congress does not see fit to provide
what in the president's judgment is
far better that is, for selection in
promotion, and for elimination for age.
Officers who fail to attain a certain
rank by a certain age should bo retired.
Now that the organized militia, the
national guard, has been incorporated
with the army as a
National Guard, part of the national
forces, it behooves
the government to do every reasonable
thing in its power to perfect its effi
ciency. It should be assisted in its in
struction and aided more liberally than
heretofore. There should be legisla
tion to provide a complete plan for or
ganizing the great body of volunteers
behind the regular army and national
guard when war has come.
Tho president approves the recom
mendations of the general board for
the increase of the
The Navy. navy, calling especial
attention to the need
of additional destroyers and colliers,
and above all, of the four battleships.
It is desirable to complete as soon as
possible a squadron of eight battle
ships of the best existing type. The
North Dakota, Delaware, Florida and
Utah will form the first division of this
squadron. The four vessels proposed
will form the second division. It will
be an improvement on the first, the
ships being of the heavy, single cali
ber, all big gun type. The president
most earnestly recommends that the
general board be by law turned into a
general staff. There is literally no ex
cuse for continuing the present bureau
organization of the navy. The navy
should be treated as a purely military
organization, and everything should be
subordinated to the one object of se
curing military efficiency.
Nothing better for the navy from
every standpoint has ever occurred
than the cruise of the battle fleet
around the world. The Improvement
of the ships In every way has been ex
traordinary, and they have gained far
more experience in battle tactics than
they would have gained if they stayed
in Atlantic waters. The American
people have cause for profound grati
tude, both in view of the excellent
condition of the fleet as' shown by this
cruise, and in view of the improve
ment the cruiae has "'Vked in this
already high condition.
WUl PROSEOIIE
SMEITER TRUST
Government's Right to Protect
Forest Reserves Guides
President in Decision.
BIG SMELTERS MAY BE CLOSED
President Orders Bill in Equity Piled
Against Copper Trust's Ana*
conda Plant.
Washington. Dec. S. President
Roosevelt has decided that the right
of the government to protect its own
property gives hint sufficient authori
ty to proceed against the Anaconda
properties of tho smelting trust, and
inasmuch as thousands of acres of
forest reserves are alleged to be in
danger of destruction from the poison
ous fumes from the smelters, he has
the pro or officials actively at work
on plans to end the nuisance.
Tho attorney general had advised
that bill in equity be filed in the
Tnited States courts in Montana to
this end. The president, after consul
tation with department officials, in
cluding Solicitor General Hoyt. agreed
that a bill in equity was the best
means presented, out he was anxious
that there be a certainty of resulta
if the bill was filed and the suits be
gun.
Agent to Investigate.
He therefore gave instructions that
an agent of the department of justice
should proceed to the mines and make
a thorough report as to the actual
damage done and whether it was like
ly to increase.
This step of the president had the
effect of increasing the alarm of the
trust people, who expected to dispose
of the w'i.v.'» matter at a conference
with the resident Saturday.
Department officials who talked on
the subject yesterday said that the
case wrs a very plain one and no
court could fail to sustain a bill in
equity when filed by the department.
It 's because of the determination
of the government to proceed at once
with it^ s'rong band that the mine
owners and smelters are afraid that
an injunction would either cause
grave and expensive changes in their
ways of doing business, or restrict
their oiui'ut, which would cause a
loss runr.iti^ up into the millions. A
big fight :s therefore expected when
the bill iv: equity is filed.
The ability of the trust to fight the
government is only measured by its
money, which is practically unlimited.
If the smelters are actually closed
down from 12,000 to 15,000 men will
be thrown out of work and the output
of the company immensely decreased.

CASTRO CANT LAND IN FRANCE

Paris, Dec. 8.—If President Castro
of Venezuel comes to Bordeaux he
will not be allowed to set foot on
French soil until after he has offered
a formal apology for the fashion in
which he has flaunted.' France. This
idecision was arrived at by the cabi
het at its meeting Saturday, but it
Was kept a secret for two reasons—
first, because it was suspected that
Castro would disembark at Santander,
Spain, and, second, because his physi
cal condition may be such that hu
manitarian motives might render im

But should he arrive at Bordeaux and
his illness not be serious, the cabinet
has determined that some signal re
dress must be expected from the
Venezuelan president for his lgnomi^
ious expulsion of M. Taigny, th«
French charge d'affaires, from that
country in January, 1906.
Permission to land, therefore, will
be made conditional upon, first, the
dispatch of an official telegram of
apology to the French government,
and after that the dispatch of tele

the immediate execution of the arbi
