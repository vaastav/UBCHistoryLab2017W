THE KIMBALL GRAPHIC.
Official Paper of the City and County.
BY C. R. TINAN.
If a man tpeaks aught but his honeti
conviction*, pray, where it hit honesty?.
The Index has no idea that thire will
be any immediate change in the Kimball
postofflce, but when there is a change it
is more desirous of teeing W. L. Thorn
dyke installed as postmaster than any
other man. That there may be no mis
taken idea about It—or any false iin res
sions go out—we would state right here
that at the propor time Mr. Tborndyke
may be considered as In the field and
when petitions go out for signatures
there will one for him.—Index.
That's all right, "Thorn," and if you
"get thcra" the QIIAPHIC will be among
the flrat to tender the congratulations
due from a friendly aotemporary—will
sign your petition if you say so—but you
don't want that olHoe—yo don't need it
any more than a cat need, two tails.
Sit down a minute, my boy, sit down,
while we talk to you like an old uncle.
Don't you honestly think that it would
be more commendable, more magnani
mous and better in every way—for your
self, as well as others moro needy—to
stand back and use your iDUtlenco toward
seouring tha offlee for some of the old
timers, who were wheel horses of the
Republican party before you and we
were out of our swaddling clothesf We
have such meu In Kimball, good men,
competent men, some of whom for long
years faced tho tliritkiug shot and shell
and endured the horrors of the field, the
hospilal and the prison pen to the end
that this might be the greatest country
on God's green earth. "To the viotors
belong the spoils." And who ore tho
victors if uot the briiye old veterans who
are faHt slipping down Uie shady side of
life while you and we are young and
strong? Von have a nice business, a
good business, one which gives yon a
nloe livlihood. Can as much b« said of
the veterans? Think this over, Thorn—
and pardon our interference—ponder it
well, and if wittiin tliy young broast
there dost stil! linger a longing for the
glory aud emoluments of a public office,
why, come over and you may have our
tit as an alderman and may God have
mercy on your soul.
The day after the presidential olac
lion it appuarud probable that tho
farmers had elected Harrison. From
that tiny to this almost overy fact regard
ing the election tends to conHrin that
view of tho case. Cleveland gained In
the manufacturing canters, while Harri
son gained the "rooral deestricUtf,"
It naturally follows that the exponents
of the notions of the successful party
claim that the great rural vote is solid
for a high tariff and can be relied upon
to remain loyai to that policy. Is this
a wise conclusion? Do those who make
these claims consider how short was the
time for popular education between the
publication of the president's tariff mes
sage and ttiti election? Do they make
sufficient ailo'vatice tor the fuet that the
agricultural mind always displays great
moderation in co.ning to a conclusion to
change a familiar policy. Such a mis
take of judgment is natural, but it is not
warranted by the experience of mankind.
It does uot dw to overlook the fact that
when the farmers make up their minds
about a tiling in poliues something is
lit.b to happen and happen hard. The
"granger legislation" regnr ling rail
roads is a case in point that is worthy of
attention. The ideas that got abroad
in the last campaign upon the subject of
taxation will continue to live and to trav
el. They will sit by the rural tlreside
and becomo familiar to »he rural mind.
Some day the American tanner will fully
appreciate from what source comes the
pressure of the rstra burdens lie has to
carry. l'h«n he will take a hand in the
great national game of polities for the
purpose of righting hia wrongs. The
work will be short but uncommonly
thorough.
Henri VYattcrson: 1 come to bury
Cleveland, not to praise him. The evil
politicians do their party lives after
them The good is interred with its po
litical hopes. Cleveland was oousidered
an honest man, and if it was so 'twas a
grievous fault and grievously hath Cleve
land answered it. Here under leave of
Dana and the rest—for Dana is an hon
orable man—so are they all honorable
men—I come to speak at Cleveland's
funeral. Cleveland was my pupil, teach
able aud obedient to the last, but Dana
says he was a rattlebrained enthusiast,
and Dana is a newspaper man—there are
no flies on Dana, lie has filled many
offices with Democrats, but you all know
how slow he was about It. Did this not
become a reformer? When the hungry
Democrats cried, Clevolaud fed them—
had he lived four years longer the fat of
the land would have been yours forever.
Yet Dana says he was no good, and
Dana—lie's all right. You all did see
how at St. Louis we offered him the
crown which he did take, although once
he had refused. How was that for high?
Yet Dana says he was nou compos, and
there's no dust on Dana's collar, neither
doos the wind blow through his whiskers.
I seek not to disprove what Dana says,
yet you all did love him to the last and
uot without cause. He had the bait.
What cause withholds you then to
mourn for him? O, star-eyed goddoss
of reform, thou art played out and- we
had better shut up shop. Bear with me
my political hopes are in the aofflu there
with Grover. And it is a long time be
tween Democratic administrations.
A Michigan Democrat is tho only
loser of a bet this fall who Is In a good
humor over it. He made a wager with
a Republican neighbor on the general re
sult. The loser was to be kicked unre
sists ly ai ross the street in publie, with
brass band and bonfire accompaniment,
and all the usual uproarious nonsense.
When the returns were all In the winner
oame around and laughed and shouted,
and then went and ordered anew pair of
stogy boots that weighed four pounds
apiece. The Democrat tried to beg off,
and eaid he was only in fun. But the
Republican insisted, and the Democrat
finally gave in. The time arrived. The
band and tbe bonfire and the crowd were
all there. The Democrat was there and
the kicker was there. The Democrat
took a position on the curb, and as the
big drum sounded ferociously the glee
ful Republican took a running start and
fctched him a mighty kiak. The Dem
ocrat bounced about three feet out into
tha street, while the kicker laid down
and took his foot in both hands and
howled, and was finally carried away on
a shutter. The Democrat had insoled
the seat of his trousers with a forty
pound coal hole cover.
The following brief review of the
presidents message is ellpped from a
little the hottest Republican sheet pub
lished in Ohio:—Several of oar ex"
changes And fault with its length. This
is churlish and unjust. This is a great
countty and its manifold interests can
not be passed over in a few brief para
graphs of glittering generalities. We
doubt If one in a hundred of the editors
who speak slightingly and sneeringly of
it read what It contained or know of
what they were writing. From & Dem
ocratic standpoint the message is an able
state paper and deserves the careful con
sideration of the American people. The
campaign of education is not yet over,
and that man becoittes wise who stndies
the postition of the enemy and pVoflts
by it.
Deserving veterans will thank the
president for much that he has to say in
his last message upon the subject of
pensions, notably for this paragraph:
If the establishment of vicious prece
dents be continued, if the granting of
pensions be not divorced from partisan
and oth%r unworthy and irrelevant con
siderations and if the honorable name of
veteran unfairly becomes by these ineuns
TheRtnal Voice is still running the

The editor of one of our exchanges—
we have forgotten which one—was. a
few days since, trying to explain how the
editorial "we" came to be used. It re
minds us of what Kuscoo Conklin said
about it. He said there were only two
classes of men who had the right to me
tho term we—viz the editoi aud the pro

F. D. Hyde, of Dubuque, one of the
best architects Iowa, in a letter to a
local editor in that city, says he is to re
move from Iowa soon, and adds in ex
planation: "Prohibition has knocked
me out, us well as eight other architects
in the last four years. I seek a new
field in some more prosperous state.
The Democratic governors of the states
of Louisiana, North Carolina, Maryland
and Tennessee are whiter than they have
been painted. They have nil decided to
issue certificates to the Republieans
elect
ed to congress in accordance with the
original ballots. All honor to the
honest governors.
Congressman McKlnley, the big gun
from Ohio, is uot in favor of an extra
session of congress. "It is too narrow
an issue to justify en extra session for
the purpose of admitting the territories,"
he says, "too narrow, too local and too
partisan and public opinion would not
approve of it."
Treasurer Austin is doing good work
collecting delinquent personal taxes.
On the first of July last there was over
$10,000 of suck taxes. There is some
thing wrong when such a stata of affairs
exists. The commissioners should look
after this business a little more atten
tively.
