republicans to dlear: their allegiance

Mr. Harrison att-arVed the penate re

When Mr. Wilson apposed or urged leg
islation. Mr. Harrison continued, the th-i.
Benaitor. Handing described him as "a dic
tator and ao autocrat" and when Mr.
Wilson issued his appeal in tor the
election of a, democratic congress, Mr.
Harding , was equally bitter in his de
nouncement, 'Yet, we have the spectacle," he said,
"of the president coming here and malt
ing a speech against the soldier bonus, :
thins unprecedented. Ttten yesterday ho
came here and appealed to the agricultur
al rroin to line no? to ret behind- the
party banner." He added, however, that
it migbt have been that the pres'dent
was calling for the renujblican senators to
line up and retain the seat of Senator
Newberry of Michigan, ntw under con
test by Hmry Ford in connection with the
1918 election, ss a matter of party policy
This statement precipitated a debate on
the Newberry ease, which Is to be decide-3
rest worth in which half a djczen sena

Involved the league of nations.
Mr. Harrison however, returned to a
discuss on of the president's message with
the remark that the Newberry case was
"so nauseating that I do not want to hook
It vd with the league of nations."
Continuing he said he was condent
there had been a misprint in the (presi
dent's message wher Mr. Harding ha'
expressed appreciation of the "signal
achievements" of the extra sess'on. "What
the president meant, probably was
"single" achievement, for otherwise the
meseiaere aipreared . "irt:st contradictory
and conflicting." ,
The action of the house in fixing a fif
ty per cent, sur-tax in the revenue bi'l. he
declared, constituted "a (plain repudiation"
of the executive's stand. It was appear-

"riled the i I'l-s : -.."Uj.',. ;
"fiut I hisib-U" he salu, "that t'.ie pro
