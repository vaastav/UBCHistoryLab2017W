A defeat that was as good almost as
a victory was the Phoenix high's with
the state champs last night on the
basketball court at the Young Men's
Christian association. Thirty-four to
two dozen was the scon, with the Tem
pe high getting the long end of a hard
fight.
The Phoenicians showed astonishing
improvements of play. They guarded
with the best in the state, and tlieir
only weakness a fatal one as vet
was in basket shooting.
Play was closer in this contest than
in any the Coyotitos have lost yet.
"Lost" is "coincident with "play ed" so
far this season, but the way the young
wolves are coming up, they will begin
to win with regularity before long,
n'ebb as forwards, Ladd in center and
Pinney, Banks and Matthews as guards.
Matthews supplanted Pinney in the last
half.
Tempo high lined up with Finch and-
O. Brooks forwards. Kelly Moeiir cen
ter and K. Brooks and Turner guards.
Harris went in for Finch in the last
part of the game.
Mesa comes to Phoenix to play on
the high school courts Saturday after
noon. Phoenix goes to Clendale to try
a fall with the husky young high school
out there Tuesday after school.

The twenty-fifth annual convention
of the Arizona state V. C. T. V. was
opened in this city yesterday morning
by President Mrs. II. B. Wakefield of
Tucson presiding, and with delegates
from all Arizona present. Three lively
sessions of the organization were held
closing witli a reception in the Union
Home 227 West Monroe street, where
the sessions are being held. A goodly
crowd of Phoenix women who are in
terested in temperance were present.
The morning session was given over
to the reception of delegates and the
committee assignments. This was fol
lowed by a meeting of the executive
board, and that in turn by a conference
of superintendents of departments.
The chief event of the afternoon was
the president's address which was a
statesmanlike view of the outlook of
the Arizona union and the temperance
question. This was followed by reports
from the different departments.
The program for today comprises
many interesting items. More delegates
are looked for. The event of the even
ing will be the temperance address of
Rev. Dr. Darker of the First Methodist
church.

DOl ;r ; I.A S. Dec. 3. Hartolino Flores,
a rebel soldier who killed a comrade
yesterday and then escaped across the
border into the United States, was cap
tured by Sheriff Harry Wheeler near
Xac
o, twenty-nine miles east of here
and lodged in jail at Tombstone. It is
expected he will be deported. Flores
said the immediate reason for the
shooting was a quarrel over precedence
in drinking from a canteen.
Should this fighting in Mexico con
tinue for years, I will continue to do
my part in it if 1 am still alive."
So long as he is able to obtain
American oil, Iluerta said lie would

bil.ef that the closing chapter of the
Muerta regime ;s being written is the
report to the state department from
agents in Mexico that federal troops
are no longer receiving pay, and
experience has shown that loyalty
cannot be depended on without this,
and other reports regarded as indi
cating the speedy triumph of the con
stitutionalist forces, related the pre
cipitate flight of the heads of fam
ilies which controlled vast estates in
northern Mexico, which flight and
abandonment of property deprives the
Iluerta government of a much-needed
:;orree of income.
Inquiry, unofficially, into the re
ports that large quantities of arms
and anrncnition ordered by the
lluert-i government and now on the
way to Mexico, developed the fact
such orders as are being filled were
pl'jocd many months ago, in the oarlv
days of the revolution, when it seemed
insignificant.
To Strengthen Force.

FINANCES AND
MARKETS
' .pp'OTKl) l'KKSS DISPATCH!
N'KW YORK, Dec. 3. In the last
hour of today's stock market the trad
ing became animated and prices moved
up vigorously. Prior to that time, the
market was virtually on a dead level,
with business down to low point. Tli?
undertone was firm throughout. Final
quotations for the representative
shares showed gains of two points in
some instances. Short covering was
apparently the main factor. Today's
traders learned of further reductions
in the working forces by railroads and
industrial corporations. Some southern
roads made good reports for October
but other statements shoyved shrink
ages of earnings. Statistics in pig iron
production, considered a reliable bar
ometer for the steel trade conditions,
disclosed a decline from a daily aver
age of 82.K.3 tons for October to 74,453
for Xovemlfer .
Sentiment abroad was depressed by
the French ministerial crisis which
made more uncertain the prospects for
a French government loan, to the out
come of which Rreat importance is at
tached in indicating the general Kuro
pean financial outlook. The stock
market's advance in the fact of these
influences was apparently in response
to technical conditions. P.onds did not
share fully in the improvements of
stocks. A number of weak spots ap
peared. Rock Island refunding four
half's fell 1. Total sales represented
a par value of $1,600,000. United States
2's coupon advanced ' on call.
