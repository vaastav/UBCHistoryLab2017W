Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions
In such cases would stand the test of
the courts In which case of course the
legislation would be ineffective. More
over, I believe it would be wrong al
together to prohibit the use of injunc
tions. It is criminal to permit sympa
thy for criminals to-weaken our hands
in upholding the law and if men seek
to destroy life or property by mob
violence there should be no impair
ment of the power of the courts to
deal with them in the most summary
and effective way possible. But so far
as possible the abuse of the power
should be provided against by some
such law as I advocated last year.
In this matter of injuntcions there
Is Ipdgea in the hands of the judiciary
a necessary power which is neverthe
less subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extreme care and
should be subject to the jealous scrut
iny of all men, and condemnation
should be meted ou.t as much to the
judge who fails to use it boldly when
necessary as to the judge who uses it
•wantonly or oppressively. Of course
a judge strong enough to be fit for his
office will enjoin any resort to violence
or intimidation, especially by conspir
acy, no matter what his opinion may
be of the right of the original quarrel.
There must be no hesitation in dealing
with disorder. But there must like
wise be no such abuse of the injunc
tion power as is implied in forbidding
laboring men to strive for their own
betterment in peace and lawful ways
nor must the Injunction be used
merely to aid some big corporation in
carrying out schemes for its own
aggrandizement. It must be remember
ed that a preliminary Injunction in a
labor case, if granted without ade
quate proof (even when authority can
be found to support the conclusions
of law on which it is founded), may
often settle the dispute between the
parties and therefore if improperly
granted may do irreparable wrong
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
SENDS ANNUAL MESSAGE
i&ecutive First Takes Note of The Literally
Unprecedented Prosperity of The
Nation—Devotes Much Attention
to Corporations
SUGGESTS INHERITANCE AND INCOME TAX LAWS
ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY CAN BE ENACTED
GIVES PARTICULAR ATTENTjON TO EVERY FORM OF LABOR DIFFI­
Washington, Dec. 4.—President
Roosevelt's annual message occupied
the attention of the senate as soon as
the opening preliminaries were conclu
ded today.
The President discusses at some
length the subject of lynching, up
holding the enforcement of the law
favors arbitration of the differences
between capital and labor suggests
•the necessity of currency reform en
dorses the proposition of a lower Phil
ippine tariff reviews the situation in
Cuba, and goes at length into the Rio
conference. On other subjects he
epeaks in part as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives
As a nation we still continue to en
Joy a literally unprecedented prosper
ity and it is probable that only reck
less speculation and disregard of legi
timate business methods on the part
of the business world can materially
mar this prosperity.
No congress in our time has done
more good work of importance than
the present congress. There were
several matters left unfinished at your
last session, however, which I most
earnestly hope you will complete be
fore your adjournment.
Corporation Campaign Contributions.
I again recommend a law prohibit
ing all corporations from contributing
to the campaign expense of any party.
Such a bill has already passed one
house of congress. Let individuals
contribute as they desire but, let us
prohibit in effective fashion all cor
porations from making contributions
for any political purpose, directly or
indirectly.
Government's Right of Appeal.
Another bill which has just passed
one house of congress and which it
is urgently necessary should be enact
ed Into law is that conferring upon
the government the right of appeal
upon criminal cases on questions of
law. This right exists in many of the
states it exists in the District of Col
umbia by act of the congress.
CULTY THAT IS NOW BEFORE THE PUBLIC—SUGGESTS AR­
BITRATION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPI­
TAL—FLAYS THE AGITATORS OF DISCONTENT.
Railroad Employes' Hours.
I call your attention to the need of
passing the bill limiting the number
of hours of employment of railroad
employes.' The measure is a very
morerate one and I can conceive of
no serious objection to it. Indeed,
so far as it is in our power, it should
be our aim steadily to reduce the num
ber of houre of labor with as a goal
the general introduction of an eight
hour day.

wisely provided for a truant court for
the District of Columbia a marked
step In advance on the path of prop
erly caring for the children. Let me
again urge that the congress provide
for thte thorough investigation of the
conditions of child labor and the labor
of women In the United States. More
and more our people are growing to
recognize the fact that the questions
which are not merely of industrial but
of social importance, outweigh all
others and these two questions most
emphatically come In the category of
those which affect in the most far
reaching way the home life of the na
tion.
Corporations.
The present congress has taken
long strides in the direction of secur
ing proper supervision and control by
the national government over corpo
rations engaged in interstate business
—and the enormous majority of cor
porations of any size are engaged in
interstate business. The passage of
the railway rate bill, and only to a less
degree the passage of the pure food
bill, and the provision for increasing
and rendering more effective national
control over the beef packing industry,
mark an important advance in the pro
per direction. In the short session it
will perhaps be difficult to do much
further along this line and it may be
best to wait until the laws have been
In operation for a number of months
before endeavoring to increase their
scope, because only operation will show
with exactness their merits and their
shortcomings and thus give opportun
ity to define what further remedial
legislation is needed. Yet in my
judgment it will in the end be advis
able in connection with the packing
house inspection law to provide for
putting a date on the label and for
charging the cost of inspection to the
packers.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
There are many kinds of taxes which
can only be levied by the general gov
ernment so as to produce the best re
sults. because, among other reasons,
the attempt to impose them in one
particular state too often results mere
ly In driving the corporation or indi
vidual affected to some other locality
or other state. The national govern
ment has long derived its chief reve
nue from a tariff on imports and from
an internal or excise tax. In addition
to these there Is every reason why,
when next our system of taxation is
revised, the national government
should impose a graduated inheri
tance tax, and, if possible, a graduat
ed income tax. The man of great
wealth owes a peculiar obligation to
the state because he derives special
advantages from the mere existence
of government. Not only should he
recognize this obligation in the way he
leads his daily life and in the way he
earns and spends his money, but it
should also be recognized by the way
In which he pays for the protection
the state gives him.
Marriage and Divorce.
I am well aware of how difficult it
is to pass a constitutional amendment.
Nevertheless, in my judgment, the
whole question of marriage and di
vorce should be relegated to the Na
tional congress. At present the wide
difference in the laws of the different
states on this subject result in scan
dals and abuses and surely there is
nothing so vitally essential to the wel
fare of the nation, nothing around
which the nation should so bend itself
to throw every safeguard, as the home
life of the average citizen! The change
would be good from every standpoint.
In particular It would be good be
cause it would confer on congress the
power at once to deal radically and
efficiently with polygamy and this
should be done whether or not mar
riage and divorce are dealt with. It
is neither safe nor proper to leave the
question of polygamy to be dealt with
by the several states. Power to deal
with it should be conferred on the
national government.
Naturalization of Japanese.
I recommend to the congress that
an act be passed specifically providing
for'the naturalization of Japanese who
come here intending to become Amer
ican citizens. One of the great embar
rassments attending the performance
of our international obligations is the
fact that the statutes of the United
States are entirely inadequate. They
fail to give to the national govern
ment sufficiently ample power, through
United States courts and by the use
of the army and navy to protect aliens
in the rights secured to them under
solemn treaties, which are the law of
the land. I therefore earnestly re
commend that the criminal and civil
statutes of the United States be so
amended and added to as to enable
the President, acting for the United
States government, which is responsi
ble in our, international relations, to

Capital and Labor.
In dealing with both labor and capi
tal, with the question affecting both
corporations and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to re
member than aught else, and that is
the infinite harm done by preachers
of mere discontent. These are the
men who seek to incite a violent class
hatred against all men of wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper move
ments for the better control of cor
porations and for doing away with
the abuses connected with wealth, into
a campaign of hysterical excitement
and falsehood in which the aim is to
inflame to madness the brutal pas
sions of mankind. The sinister de
magogs and foolish visionaries who
are always eager to undertake a cam
paign of destruction sometimes seek
to associate themselves with those
working for a genuine reform in gov
ernmental and social methods, and
sometimes masquerade as such re
formers. In reality they are tho
worst enemies of the cause they pro
fess to advocate, just as the purveyors
of sensational slander in newspaper or
magazine are the worst enemies of all
men .who are engaged in an honest
effort to better what is bad in our
social and governmental conditions.
To preach hatred of the rich man as
such, to carry on a campaign of slan
der and invective against him, to seek
to mislead and inflame to madness
honest men whose lives are hard and
who have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger in the doctrines
preached—all this is to commit a
crime against the body politic and to
be false to every worthy principle and
tradition of American national life.

American Shipping.
Let me aagln call the attention
of the congress to two subjects con
cerning which I have frequently be
fore communicated with them. One
is the question of developing Ameri
can shipping. I trust that a law em
bodying in substance the views, or a
major part of the views, expressed in
the report on this subject laid before
the house at its last session will be
passed. I am well aware that in for
mer years objectionable measures
have been proposed In reference to
the encouragement of American ship
ping but it seems to me that the
proposed measure is as nearly unob
jectionable as any can be.

TWENTY-THREE
ASKING PARDON
LIFE CONVICTS ARE SEEKING RE­
LEASE FROM THEIR LONG
SENTENCES
List Includes Nearly All That Come in
That Class—Some Have Already
Served Many Years in the Peniten
tiary For Crimes.
Dos Moines, Dec. 4.—Twenty-three
life convicts have applied to the leg
islature for pardon. Yesterday was the
last day. The list is larger than ever
before. It leaves but a few life con
victs who do not seek clemency.
One unique case is presented to the
legislature. Otto Otten of Pocahontas
county was given a conditional pardon
by the governor, on recommendation of
the legislature, the twenty-ninth gen
eral assembly. The conditions were
that he should live in Jackson county,
should lead a moral and upright life,
and thai he should neither write to nor
permit Mrs. John O'Schon to communi
cate with him. He was not permitted
to visit her nor she to visit him. He
had been given a life sentence for the
murder of her husband. He now peti
tions tho legislature for a full pardon
and the removal of these conditions.
Charles Stegall of Davenport applies
for a pardon, also. He escaped the
gallows in 1899, having been sentenced
to hang on December 4. The sentence
was commuted by Governor Shaw to
life imprisonment. In his petition Ste
gall claims to have killed "Bill" Miller
in self delense. He says that Miller
owed him 65 cents and when he asked
for It his creditor assaulted him, and
he stabbed in self defense.
An Illinois Mystery.
In the case of Leonard W. Haley
from Dubuque county who, with Hugh
Robbard held up a car and killed twq
or three policemen, a letter has been
filed lrom Robert S. Rose of Chicago
in which Rose says that he will give
Haley employment in a shorthand
school as soon as he is released. Haley
has learned the art during his prison
life. He is a mystery. His real name
is not known, but it is known that he
is highly connected in Illinois. He de
clines utterly to talk of himself or his
early life. He has a black eye, genu
inely black, and utterly without expres
sion.
The governor has been served with
official notice by the warden of the
penitentiary at Anamosa that William
McWilliams has been adjudged in
sane. This prevents the execution of
the court's order of sentence of death
on December 14, 1906. McWilliams
murdered his wife and five or six chil
dren.

three life convicts who appeal to the

ROY BERRY COMMITS SUICIDE.
Young Man at Chariton Drinks Six
Ounces of Acid.
Chariton, Dec. 4.—(Special).—Roy
Berry committed suicide Monday aft
ernoon at 4 o'clock by drinking six
ounces of carbolic acid, which he pur
chased at the Dougherty drug store.
Mr. Berry it is reported, had been un
der tho influence of liquor for several
days, which probably prompted him to
do the deed.
His sister, Mrs. Bertha Vickroy of
Lacona, was there and was getting
ready to take the train for home,
when Mr. Berry put on his coat and
started out, she asking him to come
and see her. He answered by telling
her the next time she saw him he
would be dead. He walked around the
block and into the closet at the east
school building, where he drank the
carbolic acid, went home and laid down
telling them he was a goner and bid
them good-bye. He lived about five min
utes.. Mr. Berry was 32 years of age
and was the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs.
J. Y. Berry, with whom he made his
home.
The tragedy was a double shock to
the agod parents, as on Sunday Mrs.
Owen Berry, their daughter-in-law,
was Durled. The funeral of Roy Berry
will probably be held Wednesday.....

STATE WATCHES
SHAW'S MOVEMENT
NOTHING IN STORY THAT HE CON­
TEMPLATES GOING TO SE­
ATTLE TO LIVE
Whether He Enters Race for Presi
dency or Not, It is Anticipated That
He Will Return to Iowa and for a
Time Attend to Private Affairs.
Des Moines, Dec. 4—Politicians think
there is nothing in the story which
comes from Washington, D. C. that
Secretary of the Treaurer Shaw ex
pects to go to Seattle and settle down.
They believe that he will return
to Iowa and resume his business at
Denison, where he owns a string of
banks and has a business already cut
out for him among his friends.
If he were going to leave Iowa, it Is
thought that he would go to New
York. He has had the offers to ga
there. Some of the big financial '.n
stltutioas in that city have offered him
$50,000 a year. It is said he has been
considered as a possible head for one
of the big Insurance companies.
Whether he enters the race for the
presidency or does not, it is believed
he will return to Iowa to live. Ani
politicians expect t- see him enter
the race for president, With Iowa
back of him he, Shaw, would cut an
immediate figure of importance.
Rinehart Endorses Roosevelt's Action.
George F. Rinehart, publisher of the
only democratic paper in Des Moines,
and a strong, intimate, personal friend
of William Jennings Bryan, has
strongly endorsed the action of Presi
dent Roosevelt in discharging the ne
gro soldiers who, Rhinehart says, com
mitted unspeakable outrages in
Brownsville, Texas. He was down
there during the recent troubles and
says that the negro soldiers got all
that was coming to them. The dis
charge was due to the fact that they
knew the culprits who committed the
outrages but would not disclose their
identity. Had they disclosed the per
sons who committed the crimes, these
men alone would have been punished.
The defense of the President in this
respect by the leading democrats of
the state removes the matter from any
possible partisan manipulation, here
after.
Commission is Embarrassed.
The sensational stories printed
about an alleged altercation in the re
cent sessions of the legislative in
surance commission have caused that
body much embarrassment.
There has been earnest discussion
among the commissioners with respect
to the form of the report to be maJe,
but as to the conclusions, there has
been none.
In the case of the recommendations
respecting deferred dividend policies,
the majority of the commisison sug
gested that it would be wise to include
the argument advanced by insurance
men in defense of the policy. The
minority of the commission thought
this unwise and so it comes out. The?
report is an indictment without re
commendation. It has been unani
mously agreed upon.

Fairfield, Deo. 4.—(Special).—Be
cause, as he says, Walter Davidson has
alienated his wife's affections, Michael
Shondel asks damages to the extent of
$1,000 from Davidson and the suit will
attract much attention when it comes
to trial. Both the men are well known
farmers near Birmingham, where the
family troubles of Shondel have vreated
much comment. According to the story
of the plaintiff, his wife, Kitty, and'
Davidson, have often stolen buggy
rides together during the past year,
onee being so bold as to drive clear
to Fairfield and attend a theatrical
performance. At one time, says Shon
del, the two went to Aledo, 111., and'
posed as husband and wife. Shondel
further declares that Davidson has
given his wife millinery and other arti
cles of wearing apparel, jewelry, bon
bons and flowers.
Would Go to Federal Court.
Claiming that they are not resident!
of the state of Iowa, the Rock Island
railroad has filed a petition asking for
the removal to the federal court at
Keok ik of the suit filed by Mrs. Vonnie
Gifford against the railroad. The rail
road's petition alleges that the suit is
between citizens of different states as
it is a corporation created by the state
of Illinois. In her resistance to the
petition Mrs. Gifford attaches a certifi
cate from the secretary of state, which
says that the railroad is incorporated
in'Iowa, and therefore a resident of the
state. The petition will be argued in
the local court this week. In this case
Mrs. Gilford aSks $12,000 damages for
injuries received in a collision here on
June 28. 'ssS
