Quarantined on their honeymoon, with the prospect of passing Christmas
and New Tear's day away from their families and friends, is the plight of Ilr.
and Mrs. Robert Campell Wheeler, who recently began housekeeping on the
south side, Chicago.
Mr. Wheeler, who is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Wheeler. 2962 Michigan
avenue, and Mrs. Wheeler, who was formerly Miss Lydla Genevieve Thatcher of
Pueblo, Colo., were married seven weeks ago at the Colorado city.
Mr. Wheeler had just recovered from an attack of typhoid fever, when his
wedding day was set, and the young couple had hardly completed plans for
their future when the bridegroom was again stricken, this time with scarlet
fever.
Mrs. Wheeler insisted on remaining with him, and her nursing is believed
to have brought him out of danger. His parents have not been allowed to see
him, and could communicate with her only by telephone.

It is predicted that Speaker Cannon will put a kink in the proposed
waterways bills and it will not do for Indiana Harbor to be too jubilant
until Mr. Cannon, who is an old enemy of the, idea, comes out of the woods.
It does not seem to matter to Mr. Cannon how many big men fall into
line to support the bills, he still maintains his old stubborn stand tut at
the same time he seems reluctant to advance good reasons. Why doesn't he
consider it a great public service ? He says he stands ready to support
the plan to Issue bonds to carry out the work, provided the Rivers and Har
bors committee favors it. And there's the rub. Mr. Cannon knows quite
well that the committee will not favor any large expenditures at this ses
sion. It is unfortunate that the project should be hampered by the speaker
of the house whoso influence, is ., ail-powerfully.-felU Despite the speaker's
opposition there are really enough big men in congress to grasp the matter
in all its importance and push it through. To this class, of course, be
longs Congressman E. D, Crumpacker. It takes a , big man to see the
value of river and harbor improvements and to appreciate the fact that
transportation is now absolutely dependant upon our waterways to do that
part of the work which the railroads can never do. s

PARENTAL NEGLECT IS RESPONSIBLE,
Another pitiable "case -of girlish delinquency" came 'to' light in Ham
mond yesterday when the two girls who lodged at a resort on the Calumet
river for two days were brought back to their parents. Neither of the girls
Is old enough to be put in long dresses, yet they have gone astray so far
that their ultimate reclamation is a matter of doubt Just what the parents
of these delinquent lassies have been thinking of in the past is a mystery.
It i3 quite palpable that they have been remiss in their nurture and guard
ianship so much so that the condition of one of the girls is shocking. The
example set in both cases is full of harm to the young people with whom
the girls come in contact and it is an all arounud deplorable state of affairs.
. It is to be hoped that the keeper of the place where these girls lodged can
be brought to justice. If the police of Hammond and authorities of Lake
county ever did a praiseworthy deed in their official career, they will bring
him to justice, or see that the lawbreaker gets short justice.
IT IS REMARKABLE how the Chicago Journal is striving to get
little advertising from President Roosevelt in the Panama affair. It hurts
awfully to have an Indiana paper get a griddle-roasting and to see Mr.
Pulitzer get hi3 trimmings and then to be ignored after industriously cry
ing "thief as, the, Jouranl has done. The Chicago paper Is still asking
where the money went when the president has already told the people
where it did go.

Wabash Will Cut Rate to
Pittsburg $1, Affecting
Other Roads.
A passenger rate war among the rail
roads of the Central Passenger asso
ciation with the passenger traffic be
tween Chicago and Pittsburg as the
prize for the victor, was started yes
terday at Pittsburg. The Gould-Har-

let by announcing that the Wabash will
cut the present single trip rate of $9
between Pittsburg and Chicago to $8
as soon as notice can be filed with the
interstate commerce commission and the
legal thirty days shall elapse.
The declaration that the Gould-Har-
riman interests will give battle to the
Vanderbilt and Bauer Interests, and
that the rate slashing will be "to a
finish" came at the close of a stormy
meeting in Pittsburg between represen
tatives of the roads Involved and after
efforts at compromise had failed. It
may mean a' break in the Central Pas
