PRESIDENT'S PICTURE LESSON TO CONGRESS
SENDB THEM PHOTOGRAPHS
FROM CHINA SHOWING THE
EVIL EFFECTS OF DEFOREST
ATION.
Sp*clal Correspondence to The Freer
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—1n his
valedictory message to congress
President Roosevelt declared that
If there was any one duty which,
more than another, we owe it to our
children and our children's chil
dren to perform at once, it is to
save the forests of the country.
That this subject is very close to
the president's heart is shown by
the fact that he appended to his
message and thereby put into the
hands of every senator and repre
sentative photographs showingfl as
the president said, in vivid fashion,
the appalling desolation taking the
shape of treeless mountains and
barren plains which immediately
followed deforestation of the moun
tains in China.
Reproduced herewith are two
striking photographs which the
president presented to congress.
They show the great lesson that is
just being learned in America, that
with the destruction of the trees
comes the destruction of the soil,
changing climate and general deso
lation.
The president said: "What has
thus happened in nortern China,
what has happened in central Asia,
in Palestine, in north Africa, tn
parts of the Mediterranean coun
tries of Europe, will surely happen
in this country if we do not exer
cise that wise forethought which
should be one of the chief mark*
of any people calling itself civil
ized."
Most men are sorry not because
they have sinned, but because of
the result of their sin.

Dear Dad: What did I tell you?
The Indianapolis News is in the
Ananias club. As you may suspect,
I am shedding no tears. I don't
mind ordinary newspaper abuse;
but it always seemed to me that the
News was a little bit out of the
ordinary in the cheapness of its
spleen. Of course, it is Mr. Fair
banks' knuckles that are smarting.
While the president's letter talks
about Delavan Smith, everybody
knows that the paper gets its ani
mus from Fairbanks. Having lost
the presidential nomination, and
been sidetracked for the vice presi
dency. Fairbanks has continued his
abuse of Taft and Roosevelt from
motives which impel the political
blackmail artist. The price of quit
ting'was a fine foreign appointment
in the diplomatic service. Just be
tween us, he has a poorer chance
for anything like this than Hooker
T. Washington has to be selected
an honorary president of the Colon
ial Dames.
"Curse him, but he can be agree
able when he has a mind to." This
was a remark I heard from a New
York gentleman emerging from a
conference with T. R. I was sitting
in the anteroom, and the words
were not intended for my ears. You
see, T. R. was doing a little "ar
ranging" in regard to Mr. Root go
ing to the senate, and the New
York party was getting an experi
ence of T. R.s winning ways and
manners.
I got a look at the guns T. R. is
going to take with him to Africa. A
pair of Winchester rifles 45 61-9
caliber are all he will carry. He be
lieves this will do for ail occasions.
If it comes to getting through the
hide of an elephant or rhinocerous
he will use a steel capped explosive
bullet.
Sodium nitrate Is the chemical
■with which the millers bleach ordi
nary flour. At a hearing recently
the question came up whether this
chemical was injurious to the per
son eating bread, cake, pastry, etc.,
and an expert took tbe stand and
deposed as follows: Ordinary bread
contains twenty-five thousandths
part per million, and a loaf of bread
weighing 453 grains, or one pounu,
would require, in order to get one
gram of nitrous anhydride into the
human system, the consumption of
10,000 loaves of bread, which would
be equal to about 36 barrels of
flour. The average individual con
sumes about one-half a loaf of
bread a day, or all told, 182 loaves
of bread a year. Figuring that he
would commence to eat his half
loaf of bread the day he was born
(not a likely supposition), and that
ho retained uucbauged all the
nitrate (also uulikelyj, be would be

Oh, I guess I'll go on eating flour.
1 am not rabid on the subject of
woman's suffrage, but I would call
T. R.s attention to the election of
Judge Hen Lindsey in Denver, Col.,
and beg him to consider the influ
ence of the women in that event be
fore he elaborates his statement
that there has been no improve
ment in those states where wom
en's suffrage exists over those
where the men do all the voting.

I have it on excellent authority
that the next step will be putting
the southern postmasters under the
civil service. The subject is rather
a delicate one, but the facts are
about these. If southern post
masters were put under civil serv
ice a big step would be taken
toward the elimination of the negro
from office holding in the south.
The test of satisfaction in a post
master would, under civil service,
be —not political indorsement, but
the indorsement or the people of
the community served. If the negro
were not satisfactory the people
would protest and the man would
be removed and replaced by a
white. Watch Taft, and see if he
Hoes not take this step in his plan
to break up the old lines of south
ern prejudice.

To give to his childrei dear,
A bold robber person snould spoil all your joys
By shoving a gun in his ear!

You'd run to the chimney and there you would say,
"Why, there isn't a thing in my stocking!"
Then p'raps it would show —just s'posin', you know —
How the child of the poor must feel
On Christmas to suffer just that kind of a blow,
Where it isn't supposin', but real!

FAILS AGAIN
An applicant for divorce to run

court most be backed up by good
and sufficient evidence of the ef-.
Urt will prove a failure. On the
last default divorce day Judge
Huneke rejected or referred back
for additional proof three cases,
one of them being a private divorce
agreement by the interested par
ties. Yesterday afternoon another
private divorce agreement came be
fore • Judge Huneke, which was re
jected by him with the statement
that because the parties "have*
agreed between themselves that
they cannot live together furnish
es no reason justifying the court
in granting a decree to either
party."
The case under consideration
was that of Lotan R. Dolby, a Riv
erside avenue clothier, against Llb
bie Dolby, his wife, in which the
chief complaint of the plaintiff was
that his wife was a perpetual
scold. Mrs. Dolby did not appear
In ccurt in opposition to the ap
plication, but was represented by
counsel. When Judge Huneke
learned that a divorce had been
agreed to by the parties and a di
vision of the property made he
disallowed the application.
