THE UiFFESEXVE.
During tlio fall campaign the Demo
cratic press was tilled with loud and in
cessant howls over the defalcation of Ma
jor liodge—Democratic politicians pro
claimed it from the stump, and the cir
cumstance was heralded abroad as an evi
dence of a corrupt llepublican adminis
tration.
Now the plain truth about the whole
matter is simply this; Major 1 lodge
was a paymaster in the United States
/Army, a position of honor and high trust
and being an educated soldier, no atten
tion was paid tofhisjpoluics.and it is <juitc
common for officers in the regular army
to claim that they are not effected by
partisan influences, lie was tempted,
and fell into bad and extravagant habit*,
engaged in most reckless speculations,
and embezzled nearly half a million of
dollars that belonged to the government.
There is no reason to believe that he was
a natural born villain; or that his purpose
or intention vraa at first to wrong tlio
treasury out of a single cent. There is
little doubt but he would have accounted
lor every dollar that passed through his
hands, had his speculations and risks
proved fortunate. \V lien ruin and dis
grace stared him in the face,and he could
no longer hide his speculations and m:s
deeds, ho made a full and humble con
fession that touched every good and warm
heart with a feeling of pity and sorrow
for his family and himself. But ho had
done wrong—committed a crime—and it
was proper and right he should suffer
the pen dty of the law lie had violated. !
Justice b.s been sternly and properly
dealt out upon him. After a fair and
impartial hearing of the evidence, a ;
Court-martial found him guilty and sen- j
tenccd him to a just punishment of ten j
years hard service in the penitentiary as |
a convict.
This is the way Republicans adminis
ter the government, execute the law and
punish defaulters. Let justice be done,
though thp Heavens fall, is the doctrine
and practice of the Republican party.
How is it with Wm. M. Tweed, of
Tammany llall in New York city, which
is as much and fully in the hands of the
Democratic party under him, as the gov
ernment of the United States is under
I’resident Grant and in the hands of the
Republican party. Tweed lias stolen
millions from the people ot New York
city, die evidence of the fact is notorious
but notwithstanding this, he still claims
to lead the party in that city and was
elected to the office of State Senator at
the late election. Tweed is in the hands
of the Democratic party, and there is lit
tle hope or prospect of a just punishment
being meted out to him and his colleag
ties, in much greater frauds and crimes
than those off lodge. One by one they
are disposing of their real estate and oth
er property converting.their means into
cash and stealing away to foreign lands.
This is the difference between Republi
can justice and that of the Democratic
party. The Republican party punishes
defaulters as exemplified in the case of
Hodge. While the democratic party
lots a notorious thief go unwhipped of
justice, and permits him to stand as i(*
c<,n<Ji<Jiiio ttml duet* him to an office when
the evidence of liis guilt, as one of the
most notorious criminals of the age, is
known and r.ad by ad men. Krcluiuge.

Our independent Senator from Illinois
Lyman Trumbull, has been recently
asked in plain English, if ho would take
the Presidential nomination from Con
servative Republicans and Democrats
against President Grant as the regular
Republican nominee. His answer was
with unusual emphasis,
“No sir. 1 would not.”
He was asked for his reasons. Cata
logued they w< re as follows, iu Senator
Trumbull's language :
1. lam satisfied where I am. I can
be more useful here.
I do not agree with the programme
of those who refuse to support the Presi
dent's re-election.
3. Neither North nor South can be
benefited by the proposed party revolu
tion. The people of the South have re
ally accepted nothing. I believe the de
feat of President Grant would involve a
reaction at the South, whose consequenc
es wouhl be even worse than the present
state of affairs.
His interlocutor, an ex Senator,said to
him with sense of humor, and doubt
less, in quotation marks ;
“l>o you think President Grant medi
tates the permanent usurpation of the
executive office?” To which Senator
Trumbull’s reply was prompt, “No 1
do not. My opinion is that General
Grant : s, in the main, a conservative
man. The Republican party is not real
ly divided. Its internal discussions mere
iy exhibit the exercise of individual free
will, which do it good and not harm. It
will act as a body and I think will poll a
larger vote than it did in ISOS, no matter
what frame work or what candidate are
opposed to it.”
Senator Sumner is credited wifh Imld
ing precisely the same views, and with
equal candor in their expression.— J2v.

The question of a general amnesty
which shall pardon and restore to <iiil
citizenship every rebel engaged in the
late secession moveuant, is one upon
which opinions honestly differ. The Nor
thern people have never objected to a
human and magnanimous policy toward
the masses ot offenders, but have insisted
on the single condition that they should
obey the laws and remain peaceful and
orderly. With such cases as Jeff. Davis,
I beck en ridge, etc., the matter is differ
ent. They have met with no adequate
punishment, and the disqualification to
hold office, under which alone they claim
to suffer, is certainly the mildest penalty
over inflicted upon notorious criminal of
fenders. It is even milder than the lo
cal disqualification of a penitentiary con-
v u*t, a part of whose sentence is, disfran
chisement for life. He cannot vote or
hold office, for perhaps an unintentional
or unpreuiediated crime. But these trait
ors. though they cannot hold office, can
vote; and yet they stand convicted at the
bar of public justice of the gre itest crime I
over committed in any age or country.
t>ii the score of clemency they are enti
tled nothing. liut the quality of mer
cy may perhaps bear a strain In their be
half. The chief question is whether ir
is safe to the eoumrv to renew their pri- I
vilege of citizen -hip—and whether, if;
granted, they will not renew their con i
against the liberties of mankind j
Are they capable of gratitude for the
boon if life which the magnanimity of:
the country forced on them, after they ;
had forfeited it? As an experiment, it
may bw well to try them ; but it will be
quite wise to keep up a vigilant watch
for a few years longer. The nest-egg of
treason has shown signs of vitality since
those persons escaped the halter. The
saakc is tscopTcd—uut killed— -

Keporl ol .State l.aml Commissioners,
The Srst to roach us of the annual
Reports emanating from any of the state
departments is that ot the commission
ers of school and University lands. From
it wo gather that the public domain is
rapidly passing into the hands of settlers
and speculators. The sales for the past
fiscal year have been as follows :
School Lands 57,415 Acres
University Lands 2,205 “
Nnrmal Sr-lmol Lands 90,847 11
Drainage Lands 129,102 “
Agricultural Uol. Lands... J 9,547 c *
Military Road Lands 840 “
Marathon County Lands.*.. 9,019 “
Total 306.077 “
This shows a large increase of sales
over any previous year. The amount re
maining on hand subject to sale is now
2,350,069 acres, nearly all of which be
longs to the Drainage and Normal School
Funds.
Under the general law, the sum of
§89,985, belonging to the Trust Funds,
has boon loaned to school districts, and
§104,175 invested iu bonds of the United
States.
The amount of the several productive
or interest bearing funds on the 30th of,
September, were as follows :
Schxd Fund §2,489,488.28
1 1 niversity Fund 207,139.38
Normal School Fund 734,111.24
Agricultural*CoL Fund— 182,970.20
The report of the commissioners is
complete and systematically arranged,
and speaks well for the chief clerk of the
Lend office, as well as for tho Commis

Sawyer has introduced a bill ex

The demand upon the Relief Society
of Chicago, for coal, is very large.as high
as four hundred tons a day.
Mayor Mcdill places the money value
of the property destroyed by the
fire at $150,000,000, or more than one
half the total wealth of Chicago at the
time, which bad been created by labor
and capital.
It is announced that the Commissioner
of Pensions has revised the bounty laws,
and decided that all who have served in
any of the wars in which this country
has been engaged since 1790, and prior
to March, ISGS, arc entitled to ICO acres
of land. _ Those not having received the
amount will bo entitled thereto without
regard to the length of service, provided
that they wero regularly mustered into
the United States service.
The ordering of United States naval
vessels to Havana seems likely to bring
the haughty Castilians to terms. The
Spanish minister at Washington has in
formed the Cuban authorities that the
American government is in earnest ;n |

“let slip the dogs of war - ’ without great
provocation, they will nsist on the rights
of American citizenship, both as against
the Ku Lvlux at home, and the Spaniard
I abroad.
The National Republican Committee
1 proposes to recommend that no office
holders be sent to the National conyen

the purpose that if they arc present the
nomination of General Grant will be

The statement made by the New York
I/rinhl, and afterwards pubii.-hed genei
ally throughout the country, that Duke
Alexis came (u this country fur the pur
pose of proposing an alliance offensive
and defensive between Russia and the
United States, has been officially denied
by Secretary Fish. Ho says the report
absurd to need further refutation.
The complete official returns give the
llepublican state ticket outside of New
York city 48,002 majority. The total of
ficial majority of the Republican candi

The Spanish Minister was at the State
Department Saturday, in conference will)
Secretary Fish about th elEloiula Hornet

The Galveston News, the leading Dera
j ocratic journal in Texas, opposes the
“passive” policy, and exclaims “Don’t
give up the ship.”
The Cincinnati Enquirer is indignant
because the reform Republicans do not
appear to be willing to moot the Demo
crats half way in the organization of a
new party.
The political status of the present Con
gress is as follows: Senate, 57 Republi
cans, and 17 Democrats ; Republican u?a

Democrats 104 ; Republican majority 3G,
Senator Howe is made Chairman of the
Committee on Southern Claims, one of
the most important in the Senate, and is
also a member of the Committee on Print

Senator Carpenter is Chairman of the
Committee on Enrolled Bills, and is on
the Judiciary, Elections and Privileges,
Patents, and Revision of Laws.
Wisconsin Members on Committees.
—Mitchell on Committee of Manufactur

A Washington special to the Chicago
Tribune says that the President’s message
was received with great satisfaction in
both. Houses, and the recommendations
concerning taxation, tariff and amnesty
were regarded generally as insuring for
it very great popularity throughout the
country. The amnesty feature was en
tirely unexpected, and the Democrats are
warm in expressions of their approval of
that portion.
The New York Bun, which “shines for
all,” hoists the name of Senator Trum
bull as its candidate forthe Presidency.
Inasmuch as Trumbull has expressed his
belief that nothing can prevent the re-!
election of Grant, it is not reasonable to
expect a very vigorous canvass from the
Illinois Senator.
The knottiest conundrum tho demo
▼
cratic party has ever had to solve is being
passed round among its members uow-a
days. In fact the first salutation when
one democrat meets another is* “How
can we beat Grant?” They all give it up.
The Syracuse Courier (Democratic)said
on the day before election : “If Grant
should carry New York, the Democratic
: party of the nation may bang its harp on
the willows and sit down by the waters
of Babylon and weep.” On the part of
those Democrats who think more of parly
than of honesty and the public welfare,
i bo elevation of stringed instruments and
the flooding of tho waters of Babylon are
now in order. —Jjiiffalo Express.
Senator Sumner has not been restored
to his old position of Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations. Sena
tor Sehurz is left without a chairmanship,
as the Senate did not see fit to revive the
Sspccial Retrenchment Committee. —
Neither of these omissions seems to have
created the least sensation. The organ
ization for both houses has been harmo
niously completed, and the work of each
will progress without difficulty or delay.
We should have been welkpleased if Mr.
Sumner had been reinstated in his old
place, but the failure to do so evinces no
:I1 will toward him, nor will it cause a
ripple on the serfaoe of public affairs.
The Boston Advertiser, which is sup
posed to speak for Sumner and Wilson,
says: “We believe that the opposition
iO Gen. Grant is both smaller and of a
loss determined character than the lea d
ers of it fancy. We base this opinion on
the double proposition that the substan
tial reasons for objection to him are few,
and that the people arc guided by’ reason
i in their political conduct.”
The Democrats are ready to throw
1 themselves into the arms of auy adven
• tun. r fertile sake of power. The Utica
IRrald facetiously remarks: “Tlio situ
a".on of the Democratic party is like that
of the old. maid who went out into the
woods to pray fora husband, and mistak
ing the owl s ‘who, who?’ for the voice
of the Lord, answered : ‘Anybody, good
ford, anybody !’ In (he pitiful words of
one of the Tammany journals, they ‘arc I
ready to combine with anybody for the ;
defeat of Grant.”
The Pas-jivists say: “Lot the Radi
cals call their convention and nominate
Grant, and then let the independent Kc
publicans b >!t and nominate whoever they
; please, and then the Democrats rally to
his support.” This is assigning to the
Democracy a part which would bo dis
graceful and humiliating. Let their op
ponents "Dominate whoever they please
and then tho Democrats rally to his sup
port!’’ When Democracy stoops to such
cowardly subserviency it would merit an
nihilation for its treachery to every prin
ciplo that gives it vitality. Boston lust
hije wc deem it wise and patriotic
to invite tho co-operation of tho Repub
lican enemies of General Grant, and to
.make it easy for them to act with us,
they must understand that it is wo, and
not they, whose hands are on the helm of
tho Democratic ship. We are willing to
take them in as partners, but their con
trol can only be in proportion to the ac
tive capital they bring into the concern.
They know who we are, but wc do not
know who they arc.—iV. Y. World.
3lessrs. Schurtz, Geo. Wilkes & Co-,
and all tho soreheads, will please take
notice and govern themselves accordingly.
You know who they are, but they do not
know who yon are. They will run the
machine, but you will bo graciously per
mitted to work in the traces.
The passive policy proposed by the De
mocracy has been happily designated the
’Possum Policy, from the habit of this
animal of feigning death when it is caught
and cannot escape. It is one of the great
est hypocrites of tho animal kingdom,
passively allows itself to be jammed, haul
ed and rolled about without showing signs
of life, but when its time comes it slyly
peeps out to see that all is right, and if
its enemy is gone it becomes the same
old ’Possum. The Democratic leaders
must place a vary low estimate upon the
intelligence of their followers, if they
think to lead them with the picture of
such an “animilo” on their ban
ners.
How the great passive movement is to
be worked is minutely described in the
St. Louis Republican of tho 2Sth inst.
First, a National Convention of fuil-com*
munion Democrats is to meet and, “with
ropor solemnity and authority,” resolve
to do nothing. The Democracy have
taken the plunge back into the domain of
Chaos and Old Night, and disappeared,
the anti-Grant Republican convention,
composed exclusively of men who haven’t
voted a Democratic ticket for at least
seven years, is to medfc and place a ticket
in tlie field, together with “a bold and
inspiring reaffirmation of those great con
stitutional principles and those high per
sonal rights which form the ground of
Democratic opposition to the present ad
ministration.” Then look o H for the
old Democratic war hoop.
A Washington Correspondent says:
“It is astonishing how difficult it is to
find these “dissatisfied men” within the
ranks of tho Republican party. 1 have
not met a man of any political proaneiico,
who has any just claim to be called a Re
publican, who expresses the least doubt
as to General Grant's rc-nominatioi> and
re election. The Democracy can hope
for little aid from what is left of the “dis
satisfied men” in the Republican rank- 1 .
First, because they arc few in number, if
indeed, they have an existence at ail, and
second, because the boldest and most san
guine among them have abandoned all
hope of defeating Grant.
The opposition Republicans are having
rather a discouraging time of it. Accord
ing to the Chicago Times, whoso tele
graphic correspondent in Washington lias
been casting about to see how tho land
lies, “not a single one of the 139 Repub
lican members of the House of Represen
tatives is willing to announce his opposi
tion to tiie re-nomination of Grant.” —
Among the Senators is the same unhap
py promise. Those who have been
reckoned upon as the very head and front
of the Republican sorehead movement,
have been found, upon interview, to
know nothing about it, and to care less ;
and with the single exception of ~ nator
Schurz, not one of them can be got to say
I that he will not support Gmot for ic
nomination. So much for the “Passive”
experiment. What next?
If there is one thing more than another
every good citizen of the republic should
seek to protect, make sacred, honorable
and full of dignity and meaning, it is the
right of suffrage. If there is one thing
more than another which every good cit
izen of the Republic should seek to pun
ish and crush out, it is the abuse of that
right as practiced by the unscrupulous
and corrupt. Every illegal vote cast is a
blow at the dignity and purity and value
of American citizenship—is the grip of a
I ruffian upon the throat of every honest
man —is u dagger in the heart of every
i one who loves liberty and prizes free
schools and a free press—is a manacle
upon the hands of order, peace, security
i and justice.
The Roman Catholic Church, of Eng
land, has sent out Missionaries to con
vert the entire negro population of the
United States to Catholicism. They have
i bound themselves, by a vow, to work
themselves, until death, “the fathers and
: servants of the negroes.” The four
* Missionaries, already arrived, will coni'
| mcnco their labors in Maryland. This
j action will be likely to stimulate ITotest
! ant Missions in this country.
Mr. Bout well was able to - report a re
i duction of our national debt by more than
Thirteen Millions in September, and he
reports a further reduction of nearly live
Millions in October. The full amount of
reduction since Gen. Grant’s inauguration
is $203,7 jo, 812. or more than Ono Hun
dred Millions per annum. Should we I
continue to pay as wc have thus far paid I
since the incoming of this administration, |
the debt would be utterly extinguished I
within the next twenty years.
“And yet the Democratic party is not
happy.” Sentinel.
Doubtless it is a causa of sorrow to the
Administration that a few of its appoin
tees are proving themselves to be rascals,
but nearly, wo cannot see that this ras
cality is a fair warrant for the language
used;by certain of our cotemporaries.—
That Hodge, Stokes, Powell and Forbes
have gone wrong is no personal reflection
upon Gen. Grant. We think ho has given
public station to some worthless and in
efficient men, but bo has shown no dispo
sition to shield proven thieves and de
faulters. And it is verj 7 mean and petty I
business to make war on him because the :
Chicago Post office was burned during Ids'
term in the White House. When he
puts Hodge into any lucrative position it
will be a good time to bring out the as
saulting guns. Every Saturday.

Those who are prone to decide upon
the Chinese Immigration and Labor
Question, without knowing anything
about it, may or may not bo pleased to
learu that those “Celestials” (according
to the liev. G. IX Pike, writing in The
CongrcgationnU*t newspaper) are actu
ally “hungry for knowledge;” and that
“they gladly spent their earnings for
books and teachers, paying as cheerfully
for these as for any other valuable thing.
One of them enjoys the luxury of a pri
vate tutor, paying him a liberal remun
eration for evening lessons. Others
study at night in their dormitories. “1
saw,” says Mr. Pike, “live of them with
Second Headers around a lamp, learning
their lesson by means of a Lexicon con
taining English words with their mean
ing in Chinese.” It is to be noted that
the boys are as diligent in study as the
adults. “The joy and gratitude,” says
Mr. Pike, “which they manifested at
the litt'o attention Igave them was enough
to melt one to tears. They are overcom
ing obstacles in a manner well fitted to
develop character.” At the first, they
spent their evenings in gaming, but now
hud a recreation in study. No opium, it
is said, is used by them, and Mr. Parton
will be pleased to leara that only seven
out of seventy.four use tobacco. They
are “exquisitely neat,” in their habits,
and do not “gravitate to liquor saloons.’
„Iu a word,” concludes Mr.Pike,“their
prominent characteristics are industry,
ingenuity, fidelity, neatness, economy,
power of discrimination, and love, of learn
ing.” Is there any class to this country
from the old world, English,Scotch,lrish
Welsh, Swedish, German, French, or
Italian, able to show a better certificate
of character than this? The question
seems to bo narrowed down to this. Do
we want immigrants at all? and to this
the most enthusiastic Know-Nothing will
hardly respond in the negative. The
truth is, immigration follows a higher
law than any to be found in written sta
tute-books and constitutions ; -and since
we cannot arrest it, without grievously
damaging oar own interests, we may
thank our stars if the new comers are no
worse than the Chinese shoemakers of
North Adams.

The accounts of the famine in Persia,
•which continue to arrive in grcster de
tail, bid fair to treat tho world to the
spectacle of a calamity the like of which
has not been witnessed in historic times
at least —the sudden extinction of a na
tion by want of food. This has really
been the fate of the great Slates which
once tilled the valley of the .Euphrates,
and it is a fate which lias for centuries
l>oen threatening some modern States
Spain for instance. Man lias stripped
the soil of trees ; the absence of trees has
brought droughts ; droughts have slowly
dimiidshed the productive powers, of the
ground, and finally destroyed them, the
population, in the meantime, dwindling
in numbers and vitality. Spain had for
ty millions of people in the time of the
Romans, and flowed with milk and hon
ey ; it is now an arid region, only half of
it under cultivation, with only sixteen
millions of inhabitants, and, if modern
science had not come to its aid, would
probably go the way of Babylon. Persia
was one of the most powerful States of
antiquity, and even in the fourteenth
century was able to support tho army of
Tamerlane, who inarched without com
missariat or baggage during u bloody con
test. It is now almost a wilderness.with
a population of two millions —about half
of them nomads, which is rapidly perish
ing from famine brought on by three
year’s drought. The worst of it is, that
owing to the absence of cither common
roads or railroads, it seems to be impos
sible for the charity of tne rest of the
world to reach the sufferers, o that ther
is really a strong prospect of the total'
depopulation of the country. The mot- i
al of this horrible story is—look after
your trees, it is to be hoped that we
shall witness, before long,some organized
attempt in tho country to deal with this
momentous question of forest preserva
tion, which is daily becoming more pres
sing. Zoroaster, the great Persian leg
islator, was wbor than he knew when he
put planting a tree among the most mcri
torious of acts.
