HOOVER URGES MORE
LIBERAL CREDIT FOR
AMERICAN FARMERS
Asks Harding for Revised Rail
Rates Correction of Coal In
dustry! Over-Expansion.
Secretary of Commerce Hoover in
Ma annual report to President Har
din* yesterday urged "more liberal
credit* tor American farmer*, and
relief to them through readjustment
of railway rates as between high
priced commodities and primary
produce."
He recommended also "correction
&t over-expansion in the coal indus
try, and the development of trans
portation equipment reserve to meet
the peak periods of crope and com
modity hauling."
Secretary Hoover suggested a
"possible liberalisation of the re
straint of trade laws, to clear away
some of the uncertainty surround
ing these activities, and to make for
a constructive distinction between
collective action, which Is used as a
cloak for conspiracy against the pub
lic welfare and collective action,
whose objectives are the elimination
?' waste, the increase of technical
knowledge, the extension of research
and many other beneficial functions."
SAVES 1SH PER CENT.
The report points out that the va
rious bureaus of the Department of
Commerce were reorganized and ex
panded, and new forms of service
Initiated, coincident with the ssving
of lltt per cent of the total available
appropriation*.
The establishment of stancfardlssd
Krulfa and qualities of various com
modities is set forth as one of the
important features of the work ac
complished by the department.
COAL STRIKE FACTORS.
Concerning the coal strike, the re
port cites action by the Department
in securing the following; results:
1?The country entered the strike
with the largest stocks of coal on
hand ever known, owing to depart
mental surveys and a general cam
paign to Increase storage prior to
the strike. These stocks allowed
commerce and industry to be main
tained during the longest strike in
our history.
*?In the absence of any legis
lation voluntary agreements were
entered into with producing opera
tors whereby the average price of
spot coal for the entire period of
the strike was held at 13.70 per
ton as compared with ??.20 In 1920,
when production was three times as
great; and thus millions of dollars
were saved to consumers.
*?With the exhaustion of stocks I
during the latter part of the strike
a voluntary coal dWrlbutlon agency
was established though co-opera
tion with the governors of all States
and the Interstate Commerce Com
mission.
The activities of the department
were summed up generally in this
paragraph:
"Vigorous expansion of all the
functions of the Department of
Commerce, close keying of Its ef
forts to the expressed desires a'nd
needs of commerce and the trades,
careful avoidance of Government
meddling in business affairs, and
the saving despite all advance in I
^accomplishment of more than 53.1
250.000 from a single year s appro-1
priation." j
Advertising Commission
To Meet in January
One of the most Important steps
toward the development and pro
motion of advertising in the United
States will be launched in Wash
ington January 9 and 10 when the
National Advertising Commission
holds its annual convention at the
Willard Hotel.
There are twenty-two departments'
of the commission, each separate I
and distinct from the other; each j
however, working hand and hand ?
with the other. Educating the mer-1
chant in the fundamentals of ad-1
vertising. with the view of con
vincing him beyond any question
of dbubt. that "advertising pays."
will be one of the aims of the con
vention.
W. Frank McClure. chairman of
the commission, announced that
among the speakers will be Roger
Babson. E. T. Meredith, former
Secretary of the Department of
Agriculture, and Herbert Houston,
of the Houston Publishing Com
pany.
Sees Overdevelopment
Of Soft Coal Industry
The bituminous coal mining in
dustry Is overdeveloped, the United
States Coal Commission declared
yesterday, as the result of its pre
liminary study of the industry.
There are too many soft coal mines
and too many miners.
Estimates of the excess mine ca
pacity range from 30 to SO per cent
above the country's normal de
mand. For the last five years this
demand has averaged 510.000.000
tons a year. The average dajly
output last year, based on 300
working days, would have resulted
in 840,000.000 tons, or 60 per cent
amove the country's normal need.
The industry should not be fur
ther Inflated by opening new mines,
the commission declares.
Income Tax Collectors
Prepare for "Round-Up"
Under Instruction of experts frpm
Washington on the individual In
come tax law and regulations. In
come tax collectors are "wising up"
for the annual Income tax round-up.
The period for filing returns is Janu
ary 1 to March 16.
The instruction schools for depu
ties supplements the work of the
correspondence study section of the
internal Revenue Bureau, which
operates throughout the year.
At the end of the course, the depu
ties are examined as to their knowl
edge of the law and regulations.
Then they are sent into every county
In the United States to aid taxpayers
in making out their tax forms.
Stock Dividends May Have
Unpleasant Reaction Soon
Br BROADAN WALL.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.?Marfinal traders will probably receive late
this week the first unpleasant effect of the many stock dividends which
have been declared. "The Angels of Death," which is a favorite
term for ?aargin clerks, will start this week asking for additional
money from those traders who are carrying high priced shares on
which big stock dividends have been declared. Inquiry reveals for
instance that a man having $1,600 margin on 100 shares of old National
Biscuit will have to put up a sufficient margin to carry the 700 new
shares he will receive.
As a further Instance a hank,,
would be willing to lend, a firm oaf
1,000 shares of such a stock but
would be quite unwilling to carry
7,000 sharee of stock In the same
loan.
STOCK MARKET BULLISH.
The stock market has been lifted
out of the rut of despair J?y the
President's message ana the annual
report of Secretary of the Treasury
Mellon. The letter's remarks on
taxation did much to revive confi
dence in the bull campaign and al
lay apprehension. Stocks In gen
eral are expected to continue dis
counting the improvement being
witnessed In many lines of Indus*
try. Many securities have more
than discounted the business bet
terment but the majority have not.
Many bankers and brokers keep
harping on the hugeness of broker
age loans. They compare them
with figures of years past. They
forget that brokers' loans must
show a big increase compared with
other years owing to the big in
crease in the number of securities
dealt in. Any brokerage house that
has not shown substantial ex
pansion In Its borrowings from
banks has been going backward.
Brokerage loans are now placed at
approximately 1190,000.000.
History always repeats In Wall
Street. Any veteran In the financial
district will confirm the statement
that shares are split up Into a
larger number of certificates be
cause the Insiders are desirous of
transferring their shares to the gen
ral public.
STANDARD OILS.
Standard Oil interests are consid
ered leaders in the stock market.
Their opinions are coveted. The
Standard Oil shares are being re
duced In par value to facilitate dis
tribution to the public. The new
stocks were not In readiness for
the constructive campaign In stocks
of the last year. Through stock
dividends and reductions In par
value the shares are now within
reach of the -average person. It
will be necessary to have an active
and strong market In order to Mis
tribute the shares to the public.
To make the stocks look attractive
to the prospective speculator and
investor some inducements will have
to be made. For this reason the
street will soon begin to hear re
ports concerning prospective Inter
ests In the dividends of Standard
Oils that have been split up. It
should be borne in mind that corpo
ration managements do not split up
their stocks Into smaller units be
cause they like the pretty certifi
cates.
Europe is not nearly as bankrupt
as most people are being led to
believe. It (develops that some Eu
t-opean countries have recently ap
peared In the bond market as sub
stantial buyers. This buying has
been especially heavy in British,
Dutch and Canadian securities. An
authority states that approximately
$7,500,000 of the $20,000,000 7H per
cent new Netherlands loan is now
held hy Dutch investors. Also that
about $10,000,000 of the second $80,
000,000 loan has also found its Way
Into Dutch strong boxes. England
has been a large buyer of Brazil
7 >4 per cent bonds. About $5,000,
000 of the $16,000,000 placed In the
I'nlted States have been taken by
English investors. Holland Invest
ors are also absorbing Canadian
government securities on a liberal
scale while Swiss Investors are buy
ing American bonds.
Inadequate Rail System
Curtails U. S. Employment
By JOHN GOLDSTROM.
Inadequate railroad transportation is holding down the expansion
of employment throughout the United States, according to a state
ment by the Department of Labor yesterday, synchronizing with the
section of President Harding's message showing the country's need
for immediate development of transportation.
Notwithstanding this handicap the increase of employment generally
was the greatest during November of any month since the first of the
year. The statement analyzed data gathered from S59 of the principal
industrial centers of the United States.
Fifty-two of the sixty-five leading-^
cities show increased employment.
The principal cities showing de
creases were Atlanta, Seattle. Kan*
?as City, Philadelphia and Toledo.
IRON AND STEEL GAINS.
The heaviest gain was In the iron
and steel industry, especially in the
Pittsburgh district. Improvement
in this industry was reflected in
its derivative products.
"All manifestations point to a
steady upward trend in employ
ment," said the report. "The mount
ing increases of the past twelve
months give substantial evidence of
permanency/* x
New York?Increased industrial
and employment gains are particu
larly evident in the basic indus
tries. With but few exceptions that
trend in most all industries is up
ward, employment in many plants
being the largest recorded In the
past two years or more. Unem
ployment has practically ceased, and
labor ^shortage exists in many in
dustrial fields throughout the State.
Building construction on a large
scale is highly encouraging.
Chicago?A pick-up in industry
and employment in the Chicago dis
trict is indicated. Wire and alloy
Steel plants are operating at
capacity. Employment trends up
ward in the paper industry. Manu
facturing and building lines are
active. An increase of shipments
to the stock yards has resulted in
favorable conditions. Building op
erations providing ample employ
ment for building tradesmen.
Detroit ? Increased employment,
particularly in paper and automo
tive industries, also hardware in
dustry. Carpenters, brick masons,
skilled workmen in the building
trades and automobile body build
ers are in demand. Tin can manu
facturers operating to capacity.
Housing , shortage continues to
exist.
Boston ? Industrial employment
conditions are much improved
throughout the Boston district.
Building trades are more active
than for several years. Decided
shortage in building trades of both
skilled and unskilled workmen.
Shoe industry In Lynn reveals im
provement during the month. Labor
supply about equals demand.
WESTERN SITUATION.
Milwaukee?Increase in employ
ment in practically all lines, partic
ularly in metal trades, shoe, leather
and food Industries. Snortage of
workers exists in packing houM
farms, logging, candy, knitting,
bindery and machine Industries,
with an acute shortage of female
factory help.
Seattle?Labor turnover, now de
creasing. especially noticeable In
logging industry. Tendency toward
surplus of unskilled workers. Large
plants have taken on more men
and are working regular shifts.
Skilled miners going to Alaska.
Waterfront shipping shows in
crease.
District of Columbia ? A heavy
shortage of clerical workers. Home
building program proceeds without
abatement.

mind for lower railway rates,
it la feared, may check ??
tensive purchasing of equip
ment, etc., by the railroads,
particularly since it has not a
little tb do with the stimula
tion of business activity during
recent months.
The wintry weather naturally
slowed u? building activity.
Dfcclosures that Washington
is strongly opposed to modify
ing the ujesent restrictions on
immigration have not helped in
dustrial or financial sentiment,
and particularly as the agricul
tural element apparently in
dorses this attitude.
Conditions in Europe still ex
cite concern, especially in inter
national and commercial circles.
? ? ?
All of which reminds me of
the description applied by the
late King Edward's tailor to a
vast gathering at one of the
King's * receptions. Strolling
pompously up to a balcony
where the King was surveying
' the assemblage, the knight of
the needle, who had become
very rich because of the royal
patronage he had received, ob
served as he ceremoniously fixed
his eyeglass, "Rawther a mixed
crowd here. tonight, Yotir
Majesty." "I am very sorry
you don't like my guests," re
plied the King, "but we cant
all be tailors."
e ? ?
Just at this juncture, I feel
more disposed to chronicle hap
penings than to draw dogmatic
deductions therefrom. I feel like
saying, with the old-fashioned
showman, "pay your money, gen
tlemen, and taV0 your choice.
? e ?
Even so, however, I would sub
> scribe, for the time being, at
least, to this quip, perpetrated
by a newspaper wit: "Trade sta
tistics indicate that we have
reached that stage of the busi
ness cycle known as the buy
cycle."
