Tbe report of Attorney General Williams
states that in the civil suits to which the Unit
ed States was a party during the past year,
the aggregate amount of judgments in favor of
the United States ot these suits was $2,021,
724, and the amount actually realized in these
judgments during the last fiscal year wast'867,
192. The Attorney General says his total ex
penditures were $2,669,730, being $361,138
less in the aggregate than the expenditures for
these purposes last year. During the fiscul
year there was $401,336 less advanced to mar
shals for defraying the expenses of courts,
their own lees and the fees to jurors and wit
nesses than tor the previous fiscal year. He
says that many of the confederate records and
archives are now io tbe possession ot tbe gov
ernment, and would furnish much valuable
evidence to defeat excessive and unjust claims
if they could be used. The heads of depart
ments having their custody should have au
thority to properly certify them, as the records
of other departments are now certified; and
they should be competent evidence, their cred
ibility aod conclusiveness to be determined by
the judges from all the facts and proofs in the
case. _______________
An American, now a resident ot Paris writes
to Washington that Minister Washburn is quite
outspoken in discussing the causes which led to
the Democratic succosses at the recent elections
aud believes that the agitation of the third
term was one of them. That President Grant
expects another re-election Minister Washburue
does not believe; but at the some time he is
free to say that he would not support Geoeral
Grant were he again acrndidate, believing that
it was never intended by the framers ot the
Constitution that any man should occupy the
Presidential chair three times io succession.
Mr. Washburne further said that he thought
President Grant had made a serious mistake in
not promptly declaring before the election that
he was not a candidate again tor the positiouto
which he has twice been called.
Telegrams from Vieksburg report that yes
terday several bodies of armed negroes attempt
ed to take possession of the court house in that
city, where the sheriff was held under arrest.
A conflict took place, aod Gov. Arnea' Adju
tant General telegraphed Gen. Emory, at New
Orleans, that the State militia was powerless to
quell the disturbance. A later telegram says
seven hundred negroes attacked the city that
morning on three different roads leading to it.
They were driven back with a loss of twenty
five killed and wouuded and forty prisoners.
The whites lost eleven killed and two wounded.
The attack was made tor the purpose of rein
stating Crosbv, sheriff, who was requested to
resign because he had not giveu bond. Negroes
in the country aro reported as burning dwel
lings and gin houses.
That portiou of the President's message, in
reference to affairs io Louisiana aud Arkansas,
wbioh is published in full in to-day's Gazette,
reads more like the emanations from a "South
ern Republican Convention" or a "State or
Cuuuty Executive Committee" than the
words of "truth aod soberness" from the
"head of the nation" who at least, would be
supposed to be coguizant of all the tacts, and
not imposed upon by the stories of "outrage"
aud "wrongs," made up io most cases for par
tizan purposes. It is certainly not calculated
to increase the "love aud respect'' which should
be entertained tor the chief magistrate, by the
people, whose "love aod respect" is worth hav
ing, as far as the South is concerned at least.

Congress.?In the Senate, yesterday, Mr.
Morrill reported from the Special Committee
an entirely new scheme of government for the
District of Columbia, embracing a system of
Municipal Boards, the chief of whom shall be
three Regents, to be appointed by the Presi
dent and confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Sher
man submitted a bill for the revision ot the
Custom laws. Among other bills introduced
was one tor the relief of lhe Western sufferers
by the ravages of the grasshoppers, aud anoth
er to break up the importation of Chinese iuto
California uuder a system of slavery.
" In the House of Representatives a number
of the new members who had been elected to
fill vaoancics were sworn in. Six of the ap
propriation bills were reported and days fixed
for their consideration by the House. These,and
the amounts named in them, were as follows:
Legislative, Executive and Judicial, $19,653,
434; Army, $27,701,500; Iudiau, $4,805,807;
Fortifications, $850,000; Naval, $16,970,706;
Consular and Diplomatic, $1,338,035. The total
of all these bills is nearly neveuty-one and a

ed to introduce a bill for the repeal of the Po
land gag law of the last session, but he was cut
off by Mr. Butler. Mr. Cox reminded Mr.
Butler that his(Cex's) side of the House would
soon be in the m.-jonty. After this remark the
House adjourned, Mr. Phelps giving notice
that he would press his bill for the repeal of
the law.
Louisiana and Arkansas.
The President, in his message 10 Congress,
yesterday, thus refers to affairs m Louisiana
uod Arkausas.
"Your atteulion will be drawn to the unset
tled condition of affairs in some ut the South
ern States. On the 14th oi' September last
the Governor of Louisiana calle l upon me, as
provided by the Constitution ami laws ut' the
United States, to aid in suppressing domestic
violence in that State, Tuis e.ali was made in
view of a proclamation issued on that day by
D. B. Pent), claiming that he was elected
Lieutenaut Governor in 1672, and calimg up
on the militia of the Stale to arrii, assemble,
aud drive from power the usurpers, as he de
signated the officers of the Siate government.
On the next day I is.-ued my proclamation
commanding the insurgents to disperse within
live days from the date thereof, and subs
queatly learned that on that day they had
taken forcible possession oi l he Siate House.
Steps were taken by me to support i he existing
and recognized State government; but, t>< lure
the expiratiou of the five days the insurr- ciion
ary movement was practically abandoned, and
the officers of the Slate government, Willi Si-me
minor exceptions, resumed their powers and
duties.
"Considering that the present Siate adminis
tration in Louisiana has been the ouiy govern
ment in that State for nearly two years, that
it has been tacitly acknowledged and aupiirs
eed in by Congress, and more than once ex
pressly recognized by me, I regarded it as my
clear duty, when legally eaiied upon for thai
purpose, to preveut its overthrow by an aimed
mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity
in the election of 1672. I have heretofore call
ed the attention of Congress to this sul ject,
stating that on account of the frauds anu for
geries committed at said election, and bie.iuse
it appears that the returns thereof were never
legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell there
by who were chosen; but from the best sou ices
of information at my command 1 have always
believed the present State officers received a
majority of the legal votes aetual.y casi at that
election, i repeat what I said iu my special
message of February 23, l673f that iu the
event of no action by Congress i must continue
to recognize the government here colore recog
nized by me.
"I regret to sfiy that with preparations for
the late election decided indications appeared
in some localities in the Southern States of a
determination, by acts of violence aud intimi
dation, todepiive eit,z-.:us of the freedom oi
the ballot because of their political opinions
Bands of men, masked and armed, made their
appearance; White L amiss and other socie
were formed ; large quantities of arms aud am
munition were imported aed distributed to
these organizations; military drills with mena
cing demonstrations were held, and, with all
these, murders enough were committed to
spread terror among those wiiose political ae
tion was to be suppressed, if possible, by these
intolerant aud criminal proceedings. In sjuic
places colored lat-ores were compelled to vote
according to the wishes of their employers un
der threats of discharge if they acted otherwise,
and there are, too, many instances iu which,
when these threats were disregarded, they
were remorselessly externeu by those who
made them.
"I understand that the fifteenth amendment
to the Constitution was made to preveut this
and like state of thing*, aud I he act of 31 ay 31,
1670, with amendments, was passed to eniorce
its provisions?the object ot both being to
guarautee to all citizens the right to vote and
to protect them in the free enjoymt nt of tnai
right. Enjoined by the Constitution "to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed,'' and
convinced by undoubted evidence that vio
lations of said act had been committed, and
that a widespread and flagrant disregard of it
was contemplatdd, the prop- r officers weie in
structed to prosecute the offenders, ami troops
were statioued at convcuieut poims to aid these
officers, it necessary, iu the pcrfwrmanuc of
their ufficial duties. Coiupiaiuts ;ire made of
this interference by Kcderai authority, nut ti
paid amendmeut aud act do not provide lor
such interference, under the circumstances as
abovestated, then they are Without meaning,
force, or effect, and the whole seln-me ol col
ored enfranchisement is worse than moek.ry
and Jittle better thau a erime. Possibly, Con
gress may hud it due to trtrii and justice to
asoertaiu, by means of a committee, whether
the alleged wrongs to cokired citizens for polit
ical purposes are real or the reports thereof
were manufactured for the occasion. The
whole number of troops in the States ol Louisi
ana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Caro
lina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland and Virginia
at the times of the election were 1 062. This
embraces the garrisons of all the foils from the
Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.
Another trouble lias arisen in Arkansas.
Article 13 of the constitution of that State
(which was adopted in 180S, and upon the ap
proval of which by Congress the Slate was re
stored to representation as one of the States of
the Union) provides iu effect that be.'ore any
amendments proposed to this constitution shall
become a part thereof they shall be passed by
two successive Assemblies, and then submitted
to, aud ratified by a majority of the electors of
the State voting thereon. On the J 1th of May,
1674, the Governor convened an extra session
of the General Assembly of the S ate, which,
on the 18th day of the same mouth, passed an
act providing for a convention to frame a new
constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at au
election held on the 30th of June, 1S74. the
convention was approved, aud delegates were
chosen thereto, who assembled on the J4ih of
last July and formed a new constitution, the
schedule of which provided tor the election of
an entire new set of State officers in a manner
contrary to the then existing election laws of
the State. On the 13th of October, 1674, this
constitution, as therein provided, was submit
ted to the people for their approval or rejec
tion, aud according to the election returns was
approved by a large majority of those qualified
to vote thereon, and at the same election per
sons were chosen to fill all the State, county
aud township offices. The Governor elected
in 1672 tor the term of four years turned over
his office to the Governor chosen under the
new constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant
Governor,also elected in 1672 for a term of four
years, claiming to act as Governor, and alleging
that said proceedings by which the new con
stitution was made and a new set ot officers
elected, were unconstitutional, illegal and void,
called upon me, as provided iu section 4, arti
cle 4, of the Constitution, to protest the State
against domestic violence. As Congress is now
investigating the political affairs of Aikansas,
1 have declined to interfere, fhe whole subject
of Executive interference with the affairs of a
State is repugnant to public opinion, to the
feeling ot those who,from their official capacity.
must be used in such interposition, and to him
or those who must direct. Unless most clear
ly on the side of law. such interference becomes
a crime. With the law to support it, it is con
demned without a hearing. 1 desire, there
fore, that all necessity for Executive directi.-n
in local affairs may become unnecessary and
obsolete. I invite the attention, not of
Congress, but of the people of the United
States, to the causes and effects of these un
happy questions. Is there not a disposition on
one side to magnify wrongs and outrages and
on the other side to belittle them or justify
them? If public opinion cnild be directed to
a correct survey of what is, and to rebuking
wrong, and aiding the proper authorities in
punishing it, a better state ol feeling would be
iuculcated, and the sooner we would have
that peace which would leave the States free
indeed to regulate their own domestic af
fairs. I believe on the part of our citizens of
the Southern Slates?the better part of them?
I hi re a disposition to ba law abiding, and to
do no violence, either to individuals or to the
laws exisiioe. Rut do they do right in ignor
ing the existence of violence and bloodshed in
resistance to constituted authority? I sympa
thiz ? with their prostrate coudition, and would
do all in my power to relieve them?acknowl
edging that in some instances they have had
most trying governments to live under, and
very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for
nominal improvements, uot giving benefits
equal to the hardships imposed ? but ean they
proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible tor
ihis condition? 1'hey cannot. Violence has
been rampant in some localities, and has either
be n justified or denied by those who could
! have prevented it. The theory is even raised
j (hat there is to be no further inteiference ou
! the part of the General Government to protect
citizens within a .State where the Slate author
I iti'.-h fail to give protection. This is a great
; mistake. \\ hile I remain Executive all the
{ laws of Congress and the provisions of the Con
: s:iiuiituj. including the recent amendments ad
ded thereto, will be enforced with rigor, but
; with regret rhar they should haye added one
1 j->t or tittle to Executive duties or powers. Let
there he fairness iu the di cus.-ion of Southern
; questions, tiic advocates of both or all political
i parties giving honest, truthful reports ofoccur
j rences, condemning the wrong and upholding
I the right, and >oon all will be well. Under ex
isting conditions the negro votes the liepubli
can ticket, because he knows his friends are of
that parry. Many a good ciwzen votes the op
posite, not because he agrees with the great
principles of State which ceparate parties, but
because, generally, he is opposed to uegro rule.
This is a most delusive cry. Treat the negro
as a citizen and a voter?as he is and must re
main?and soon parties will be divided, 7lot on
the color line, but on principle. Then we shall
have no complaiuts of sectional iuterfureoce.

The Financial Question.
We gave yesterday a sumujary of the Presi
dent's Message to Congress, but as the Financial
Question is one iu which ail are interested, we
give the full text of the message on that sub
ject:
"Since the convening of Congress one year
ago the natiou has undergone a prostratiou iu
business and industries such as has nut been
witnessed with us for many years. A specula
tion as to the causes for this prostration might
be indulged iu without profit, because as many
theories would be advauecd as there would be
iudepeudeut writers?those who expressed their
own views without borrowing ?upon the sub
ject. Without indulging in theories as to the
cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call
your attention only to the tact, aud to some
plain questions, as to which, it W'>uid seem,
there should be no disagreement. During this
prostration two essential t kmcnts of prosperity
have been most abuudant?labor and capital.
Both have beeu largely employed. W here
security has beeu undoubted, capital has been
attainable at Very moderate rates. Where
labor has been wanted it has beeu found iu
abundance, at cheap rates compared with what
of the necessaries and com I oris of hie eottid be
purchased with the wages demanued.
Two great eliiueuts ot prosperity, therefore,
have not been denied us. A thiid might be
added. Our soil and climate are uncqualed
witLiu the limits of any contiguous territory
under one nationality lor its variety ot pro
ducts to feed and clothe a people, aud iu the
amount ot surplus to spare to feed lesa favored
, peoples. Therefore, with these facts iu view,
it seems to tue that wise statesmanship at this
session of Congress would dictate legislation
ignoring the past, directing iu proper channels
these great elements ol prosperity to any peo
ple. Debt, debt abroad, is the only element
that can, with always a sound currency, enter
iutoour affairs to cause any continued depres
sion iu the industries and prosperity of our
people. A great conflict for national existence
made necessary, for temporary purposes, the
raising of large sums ot money, from whatever
source attainable.
"It made necessary in the wisdom of Congress
?and I do not doubt their wisdom iu the
premises, regardiug the necessity of ttie times
?to devise a system ot natioual currency,
which it proved to be impossible to keep on a
par with the recognized currency ot the civil
ized world, lhis begot a t-pirit of speculation
involving an extravagance aud luxury not re
quired lor the happiuess or prosperity of a peo
ple, aud involving, both directly aud indirectly,
foreign indebtedness. The currency being ol
fluctuating value, and, therefore, uusate to
hold for legitimate transactions, requiting
money, became a sutjectol speculation in liscif.
These two causes, however, have involved us
iu a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good
faith by borrower and L-uder, which should be
paid in coin and according to the bund agieed
upon when the debt w.is coutracteu?gold or
its equivalent. The goou faith ol the Lioveru
meut caunot be violated towards creditors with
out national disgrace. But our commerce
should be encouraged; American ship building
aud carrying capacity increased; foreign mar
kets sought for products of the soil ami rnauu
factories, to the end that we may be able to
pay these debts. Where a new maiku can be
created for the saic of our products, either of
the soil, the mine or the manufactory, a cew
means is discovered of uuiiziug our idle capital
aud iabor to the advantage of the whole peo
ple. But in my judgment the first step towards
accomplishing this object is to secure a cur
rency of fixed, stable vaim ; a currency good
wheiever civilization reigns; one which, it it
becomes superabundant with one people will
find a market with some other; a currency
which has as its basis the labor necessaiy to
produce it, which will give to it its value, (rold
aud silver are now the recognized mediums ol
exehaugo the civilized world over, aud to this
we should return with the least practicable de
lay. In view of the pledges ol the American
Congress, when our present legal tender sys
tem was adopted, and debt contracted, there
should be no delay ?certainly no unnecessary
delay?iu fixing, by legislation, a method ly
which we will return to specie. To the ac
complishment of this end I invite your special
attention. I believe firmly that there can be
no prosperous aud permanent revival of busi
ness and industries until a policy is adopted,
with legislaiiou to carry it out, looking to a re
turn to a specie basis.
?'It is easy to conceive that the debtor aud
speculative classes may think it ol vaiue to
them to make so-called money abuudaut until
they can throw a portion of their burdens upou
others. But eveu these, 1 believe, would be
disappointed in the result if a course should
be pursued which will keep iu doubt the value
of the legal tender medium of exchange. A
revival of productive iudustry is needed by all
classes ; by none more than the holders ot
property, of whatever sort, with debts to liqui
date from realization upon its sale. But ad
mitting that these two classes of citizens are
to be benefited by cxpansiou, would it be hon
est to give it? Wouid not the general loss be
too great to justify such relief? Would it not
be just as honest and prudent to authorize
each debtor to issue his own legal teuders to
the extent ot bis liabilities? i han to do this
would it not be safer, for fear of over-issues! y
unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt ob
ligations are obliterated in the United Srates,
and now we commence anew, each possessing
all be has at the time, free from incumbrance ?
These propositions are too absurd to be en
tertained for a moment by thinking or honest
people. iret every delay in preparation lor
final resumption partakes of this dishonesty,
aud is only less in degree as the hope is held
out that a convenient season will at last arrive
for the good work of redeeming our pledges to
commence. It will never come, iu my opinion,
except by positive action by Congress, or by
national disasters which will destroy, for a
time at least, the credit ol the individual and
the State at large.
"A souud currency might be reached by total
bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of
the nation and of individuals.
"1 believe it is in the power of Congress at
this session to devise such legislation as wi.I
renew confidence, revive all the industries,
start us on a carecr of prosperity to last many
years, aud to save the credit of the nation aud
of the people. Steps towards the return lo a
specie basis are the great requisites to this de
voutly to be sought for end. There are others
which I may touch upon hereafter.
"A nation dealing in a currency below that of
specie in value labors under two great disadvan
tages: First, having uo use for the world s ac
knowledged medium of exchange? gold and
silver?these are driven out ot the cou itry be
cause there is no demand lor their u-:e. Second,
the medium of exchange in use being of a fluc
tuating value?for, atter all, it is otii} worth
just what it will purchase ot gold and silver,
metals having an intrinsic value just in propor
tion to the honest labor it takes to produce
them; a larger margin must be allowed for pro
fit by the manufactuier and producer.
"It is months from the date of product ion to
the date of realization. Interest upou capital
must be charged and risk ol fluctuation in the
vaiue of that which is to be received in pay
ment added. Hcuce high prices, acting as a
protection to the foreign producer, who re
ceives nothing in exchange for the products ot
his skill aud labor except a currency good, at a
stable value, the world over..
"It seems to me that notning is clearer than
that the greater part of the burden of existing
prostration, for the want ot a sound financial
system, falls upou the working man, who must,
alter all, produce the wealth and the salaried
man who superintends and conducts business.
The burden falls upon them iu two ways?by
the deprivation of employment and b) the de
creased purchasing power of (heir salaries. It
is the duty ot Congress to devise the method
of correcting the evils which are acknowledged
to exist, and not mine. J3ut I will venture lo
suggest two or three thiugs which seem to rue
as absolutely necessary to a return to specie
payment; the first great requisite in a return to
prosperity. The legal tender clause to the law
uuthoriziuejihe issue of currency by the Govern
ment should be repealed, to take effect as to
all contracts entered into after a day fixed in
(he repealing act; not to apply, however, to
payments of salaries by Government, or for
other expenditures now provided by law to be
paid in currency in the interval pending be
tween repeal and final resumption. Provision
should be made by which the Secretary of the
Treasury may obtain gold as it may become ue
cessary from time to time from the date when
specie redemption commences, To this might
and should be added a revenue sufficiently in
exce.-s of expenses to insure an accumulation
ot gold in the Treasury to sustaiu permuueut
redemption.
'"I commcud this subject to your careful con
sideration, believing chat a favorable solution is
attainable, and that it'reached by this Congress

"With resumption, troe banking maybe au
thorized with safety, giving the same lull pro
tection to bili-holders which they have under
existing laws. Indeed, I would regard free
banking as essential. It would give proper
elasticity to the currency. As more currency
should be requirred for the transaction of legiti
mate busiuess new banks would be started, and
in turn banks would wiud up (heir business
when it was fouod that there was a superabun
dance of currency. The experience and judg
ment ol the people can best decide just how
much currcncy is required for the transaction
of the business of the country. It is unsafe to
leave the settlement of this question to Con
gress, the secretary of the Treasury, or the
Executive. Congress should make the regula
tion under which bank? may exist, but should
not make banking a monopoly by limiting the
amount of redeemable paper currency t hat shall
be authorized. Such importance do i attach
to this subject, and so earnestly do I commend
it to your attention that I ?ive it prominece by
introducing it at the beginning of this mes
