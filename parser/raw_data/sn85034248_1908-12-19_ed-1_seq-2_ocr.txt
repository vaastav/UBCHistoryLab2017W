Merry Christmas! Peighdjerpole
tacks?
Only twelve more days of leap year.
Have you thought of it, girls?
The Chief proffers to all of its read
ers the wish that they may enjoy a
very Merry Christmas.
T'he best use to which a two-dollar
bill can be put just now is to get it
changed into ones, pass over one of
the ones to the sheriff for your poll
tax and send the other one to the
Times-Democrat as a contribution to
its doll and toy fund for poor children.
The maidenly modesty of the vener
able Picayune has received a terrible
shock, judging by its captious editor
ial caption, "President Taft Seeks to
Seduce the South." It is to be hoped
the outraged sensibilities of our es
teemed contemporary will not find vent
in an effort to invoke a resort to the
extrajudicial methods of Judge Lynch
as a punishment of Mr. Taft's bold
badness.
Ex-Governor Vardaman of Missis
sippi has grabbed time by the fore
lock and annoinces that he will again
be a candidate for United States sena
tor. Ele seems to te proceeding on
the principle that actuated the persist
ent suitor who wouldn't take no for
an answer and pestered the unwilling
girl until she married him at last just
to get rid of his protestations and be
cause she was "Sired of having him
hanging around."
The board of directors of the Peo
ple's Bank met in regular monthly
session Wednesday forenoon, with
President J. A. Dalferes in the chair.
Cashier W. J. LeBlane submitted a
report of the condition of the institu
tion at the close of business on Tues
day afternoon, showing loans of $164,
470.16, available cash of $54,712.01,
and deposits totalling $166,355.01. A
dividend of ten per cent was declared,
payable on and after Dec. 31, 1908.
The affairs of the bank were found to
be in prime shape, large gains hav
ing been made in all lines of business
during the past year.
Knights of Columbus Elect Officers.
Ascension Council No. 1087, Knights
of Columbus, held an enthusiastic
meeting last Sunday and elected the
following officers for the ensuing year:
Paul Leche, grand knight; H. A. Ter
rio, deputy grand knight; L. A. Lan
dry, Jr., chancellor; U. L. Rodriguez,
recording secretary; J. C. Bouchereau,
financial secretary; W. J. LeBlanc,
treasurer; R. J. Chauvin, advocate;
Jos. Constantin, warden; Prosper
Ganel, inside guard; Robert H. Lan
dry, outside guard; Rev. J. M. T.
Massardier, chaplain; James Fortier,
trustee. The officers will he installed
at the first meeting in January.
A lively contest seemed in prospect
for the choice of officers of the New
Orleans Board of Trade for 1909, but
the ticket headed by Crawford H.
Ellis for president and Alex. F.
Leonhardt for first vice president
proved so popular that all opposition
to it has been withdrawn. .Mr. Ellis is
division manager of the United Fruit
Company at New Orleans, besides be
Ing prominently connected with sev.
eral other business concerns, and Mr.
Leonhardt is a leading grain and feed
merchant. Both have been prominent
and active in the direction of the
Board of Trade's affairs, and are
eminently worthy of the favor and
confidence of their associates in that
organization.
Good Sense and Good Poetry, Too.
The New Orleans Poll Tax Associa
tion has issued a placard which is be
ing displayed in the street cars and
s bow windows of that city, reminding
citizens of their duty in the following
forcible prose and cit ver rhytae:

FOR THIS 1OTHEE
Mia A. G. Tuson, of Livermore, Cal.,
writes: "I picked up from my door
step one day a little book in which I
soon became very much interested.
Ky little girl of five years of age had
been troubled for a long time with
loss of appetite, extreme nervousness
and undue fatigue. She was all run
down and In a very delicate condition.
"This little book was very compre
hensively written, and told of the new
method of extracting the medicinal ele
ments of the cod's liver from the oil,
aliminating the obnoxious oil which is
so hard for children to take.
"'Just the thing,' said I, 'for my little
daughter,' and I immediately went for
a bottle of VinoL It helped her won

Besh and strength, and she does not
take cold half so easily.

eperience and jam give Vinol a trial."

President Roosevelt's Final
Message.
The last annual message which
President Roosevelt will transmit to
the national congress was read in
both branches of that body on the
8th instr, and its contents is attracting
great interest throughout the country.
The document covers two pages of an
ordinary-newspaper in small type, and
in point of exhaustiveness, vigor,
ability and clarity of expression com
pares favorably with its predecessors
and is worthy of the established repu
tation of its distinguished and bril
liant author.
The recommendations, suggestions
and statements of governmental con
ditions comprised in the message may
be briefly summarized as follows:
The present session of congress
should witness action for the improve
ment of inland waterways-action that
will give us not only navigable, but
navigated rivers.
Our courts are jeopardized and dis
credited by judges who show inability
or unwillingness to put a stop to the
wrongdoing of very rich men and to
give relief to wageworkers and men of
small means who are crushed down
and oppressed by modern industrial
conditions that should be curbed and
reformed.
Organized labor is chafing under
unjust restraint coming from repeated
resort to procedure by injnrction.
Although often improperly expressed,
labor's discontent has a sound basis,
and existing abuses should be abro
gated.
The burdens of taxation on the small
man should be lightened as far as
possible, and as a means to this end
an inheritance tax on large fortunes
shout1 be levied.
Railways should be placed under
the control of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and removed from the
domain of the anti-trust law. The
commission should haie control over
the issuing of securities and the rais
ing and lowering of rates.
Excellent results have been accom
plished by the management of the na
tion's finances during the past seven
years, but the currency system is yet
imperfect. -
There was a surplus of revenues in
the years 1902, 1903, 1906 and 1907, and
a deficit in 1904, 1905 and 1908, the net
result being a surplus of over $99,000,
000. The interest bearing debt was
reduced from $987,141,040 to $897,253,
990, notwithstanding there were two
sales of Panama Canal bonds and an
issue of 3 per cent certificates of in
debtedness.
The Sherman anti-trust law should
he amended so as to invest the na
tional government with the paramount
right to control all agencies of inter
state commerce, and there should be. a
law permitting combinations which
are to the public interest.
Railroad, telegraph and telephone
companies doing interstate business
should be under control of the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
Proper solution of the labor problem
depends as much on the states as the
central government.
Child labor must be prohibited, wo
man labor diminished and the hours of
mechanical labor shortened.
Stock watering should be prohibited
and stock gambling discouraged.
An increase in the salaries of United
States judges is recommended.
Postal savings banks are advocated.
The saving of the forests is com
mended.
Mnre effective action a-ainstcrimin
ale by the secret service is advocated.
Opportunity of tLe government in ed
ucational work must not be lost nor
longer neglected.
War against disease, and particu
larly against plague carrying rodents
and insects, should be vigorously
waged.
The immediate admission to state
hood of New Mexico and Arizona is
advocated.
The postmaster general should be
authorized to experiment with the
parcels post.
Attention is called to the importance
of the fisheries in interstate waters,
and an extension of the federal law
regulating game to include fish, is
recommended.
The administration of the Panama
Canal-is praised.
The commercial and material pro
gress of the twenty Latin-American re
publics is noted with satisfaction.
Extension Lf the ocean mail service
to , urn America, Asia, the Philip
pines andAustralatia is recommended.
Farticular attention is called to tht
advancement of Hawaii.
Progress toward self-government in
the Philippines is fast, but no one can
prophesy when it will be wise to con
sider independence as a definite policy
American citizenship for the people
of Porto Rico is recommended.
Hope is expressed that the Cuban
people will be able to govern them
selves with justice after the withdranal
of the American troops.
A change in the methods of promo
tion in the army, by attainments rather
than by seniority, is advocated.
Reorganization of the cavalry along
modern lines is advocated.
Government should perfect the effi
ciency of the national guard, the first
step being to teach men how to shoot.
Recrmmendations of the general
hoard for the increase of the navy,
calling attention to the need of addi
tional destro yers and colliers, hospital
ships, a d above all, four new battle
ships, are aporoved.
Nothing better, from every view
point, has ever nccurred to the navy
than the cruise around the world.
There is no excuse for continuing
the present bureau organization of the
navy.
The Chibf is indebted to the New
Orleans Tines Dem-;crat for a consid
erable pE rt on of the foregoieg synop
sis of the president's admirable mes
sae
Mr. Taft and tVe Colored Citizen.
A well-known colored resident of
this state-a man of marked natural
ability and educational acquirements,
who is an earnest student and thought
ful observer of all matters and events
connected with the welfare of the ne
gro in this country-expresses the fol
lowing views in a personal letter
which has fallen under our observa
tion:
"I believe the election of Hon. Wil
l1am [I. Ta't as president is a distinct
blessing to the black citizenship. I
may differ from many in my concep
tion of that blessing, but that personal
view may well be left to the care of
future developments. It is the future
that completes all work of human
origin.
"I may say this much, however,
that I still hold to the opinion that the
colored man to be progressive must
first be responsive. 'Exceptionals'
are powerless to promote general ad
vancement, for just as sure as logic
makes it a rule for reasoners to
descend from the universal to the par
ticular, so will the race be rsquired to
diversify and generalize before it can
ctmmand an average of excellence,
and thus invite comparisons founded
on truth instead of concessions.
"The colored man must help himself,
and so doing help the race, and he
can best do tlhat by giving force to
Mr. Hay 's admonition, 'Shine wLere
you are.'
"I believe that Mr. Taft will wel
come that spirit of self consciousness,
and will go as far as his authority
will permit to make good his sym
path es.
"I like to recall some of his expres
sions uttered in the last campaign.
On one notable occasion, addressing
a colored audience, Mr. Taft re
marked that 'The negro will settle the
race problem himself.' To abandon
all barren policies is one of the ways.
Another way is to encourage and sup
port in the south the men who have
the power to appeal to public senti
ment and who are themselves humane
and considerate."
The Panama Canal.
A lot of time and newspaper space is
apparently wasted in discussions over
the Panama Canal. The site of the
Gatun locks has called for a great
amount of ink-shedding by people who
don't know what they are discussing.
The esteemed New Orleans Picayune
devotes nearly a column to this in
teresting subjct and illustrates the
accuracy of most of these discussions
by quoting from the repot t of the
Isthmian Canal Commission a partial
statement of geological conditious at
the site of the Gatun locks and deduc
ing therefrom the remarkable conclu
sion that there is no rock in the back
bone of the Ihthmus.
The fact is the matter is just now in
the hands of the most competent body
of men in the whole world-the engi
neer corps of the United States army.
They have already dune, and done
successfully, some of the heaviest work
the world has seen. They have not in
their whole record a substantial per
manent failure. They rarely make
mistakes, and never serious ones.
Neither congress nor newspaper en
gineers can help them except by letting
them alone, and we have no idea con
gress will do anything but pay the
bills as they come in. The bills wilt
be honest, too, and as reasonable as
is possible. The engineers and their
work will at all times stand any in
telligent investigation. There is no
occasion for hysterics. Wait and see.
Another Democrat Booms Cannon.
Last week The Chief quoted the un
stinted words of praise and coom
mendation spoken by Congressman
John Sharp Williams of Mississippi
in behalf of "Uncle Joe" Cannon
Illinois, the Republican speaker of toe
house of representatives. Now we
have the pleasure of reproducing the
following testimonial to like effect
from our own "Cousan Bob" Brous
sard, Democratic congressman from
the third Louisiana district, as cited
by a representative of the New Or
leans Picayune who asked the con
e-ressnaan if he had seen the published
report that Speaker Cannon was to
have Republican opposition:
"Yes," he replied, "I have noted the dispatches
from Virginia as to the possible opposition to
speaker Cannon for re-election, but I believe
he will be re-elected by an overwhslming ma
Jority of the house. I consider Joe Cannon one
of the largest and strongest men in the whole
national Republican party."
The first session of the Southern
Commercial Congress was held in
Washington, D. C., last week, and
John M. Parker of New Orleans was
elected president of the body. The
selection of the place of meeting for
next year was left to the executive
committee, and it is thought the sug
gestion of the Louisiana delegates that
Boston should be chosen will be
adopted.

Donaldsonville, La., Dec. 19, 1908.
EDITOR CHIRP:
Please permit me, if you have space
in your valuable paper, to call Mr. B.
Vega's attention to the fact that as he
was so particular in questioning me
on how many feet I live from the bar
room, he should try and find out how
many feet live those that signed the
petition in favor of the said bar room,
for in my opinion many of them live
outside of the 300 feet line. Therefore,
Mr. Vega or those interested in above
said bar room business would oblige
me -very much to have me present
whenever they are ready to measure,
if ever that will be, for we would like
to see justice done to us all. As I am
an Italian by birth, I beg to be ex
cused for all the errors I have made.
Hoping that you may find room
enough in one corner of your valu
able paper, and thanking you in ad
vance, I sign myself your humble
perv"ut, MICHELE D'ESPOSITO.
N. B1. Don'r 1 ou think that our rea
sans are suniciert to protest? Mr
Forrest, Mr. Termini and myself are
the most interested in the case.

N. Pugh, Prosper Rodriguez, W. B. Stuart, Al
bert Muller and J. E. Walker. Absent-George

E. 1'. Melancon and Prosper Rodriguez.

and W. B. Stuart.
The minutes of the previous meeting of Oct. 14,
1908, were read and approved.
The following report of the superintendent was
read. accepted, and the superintendent author
ized to carry out its provisions by engaging an
additional teacher for the Calbasse and the
Sacremento schools:
Donaldsonville, La., Dec. 17. 1908.
Hon. President and Members of the School
Board:
Dear Sirs:-It is with much pleasure that I
submit to you this report on the progress of the
schools since your last meeting.
I beg to report that all requirements of the
State Board have been complied with and the
Donaldsonville High School has been placed on
the list of authorized schools.
The institute held from November 2 to 6 was
qunie a success. The attendance was almost per
feet and the faculty placed a high estimate on its
value.
Al that time the teachers decided to lay es
pecial stress upon the following points during
the present session: (1) a high per cent of at
tendance; (2' strengthening of sentiment for
consolidation of schools: (3) the matriculation
and retention of as many of the older children of
their communities as might be possible; (4) the
introduction of agriculture and other manual act
ivities, largely through school gardens. They
cordially invite your co-operation along these
lines.
Since the opening of schools in September I
have visited every school in the parish at least
once, and several of them two tites. traveling
by buggy in that time 343 miles. I find the
attendance truly remarkable in its increase over
this time last session, and the work ot the teach
ers zealous, and generally speaking, efficient.
The senools of Calbasse, Sacremento, Corner
view, Fairbanks, Carencro, and Galvez are too
badly crowded for good work. I would recom
mend an additional teacher for each of the two
first named schools, if funds will permit, and
that the work of the Cornerview and Carencro
schools be limited to four instead of six grades.
with the recommendation that patrons of the
Galvez and Fairbanks schools who have pupils
in fifth and sixth grades also send such pupils to
graded schools. These schools arenear enough to
Dutchtown, St. Amant, Gonzales and Calbasse.
respectively, to allow the larger pupils to attend
these graded schools without great inconveni
ence. I would recommend that pupils be allowed
to make their transfer any time between now
and January 4.
Teachers' reports of last session for the month
ending Lec. 13 show a total enrollment to that
date-of 1576 children in all the schools of the par
ish. Reports now on file for this session show
an enrollment to date of 2120 pupils, an increase
of 35 per cent.
Good weather, good roads, short cotton crops.
are all partially responsible for this remarkable
increase, but the greater interest in schools gen
erally. has greatly assisted. The increase in
graded schools is greater than in one-room
schools, because people are gradually learning
that they give better returns. In the course of
time the one-room school will pass the way of
the open-kettle sugar mill, because we are learn
ing that there is a much better school by con
solidation. Yours truly,
The action of the superintendent in ordering a
half-dozen book cases was approved.
On motion, duly seconded and unanimously
carried, the superintendent was authorized to
confer with Prof. W. R. Dodson of L. S. U. and
formulate definite plans for the establishment
of an agricultural demonstration stat-ion of
several acres in the New River section in con
nection with the school work, and present such
plans to the board at its next meeting.
The following resolution was unanimously
adopted:
Resolved. That a committee of three be ap
pointed to take charge of the sixteenth section
of timber in the seventh ward, and report its
actions from time to time to the board.
The president appointed on this committee
Messrs. J. E. Walker, M. G. Saverio and G. W.
Rice.
Bills to the amount of $78.72 were approved
and ordered paid.
The appointment of trustees for the various
schools was deferred to a future meeting.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved. That the bond of the Bank of Don
aldsonville as depository of the school funds be
snd is hereby lixed at ten thousand dollars, and
that a copy of this resolution be sent said bank
by the secretary.
The schools of the parish were granted from
December 24 to Jan. 3, inclusive, as holidays.
Business having been concluded, the board
adjourned. E. N. PUGH,
