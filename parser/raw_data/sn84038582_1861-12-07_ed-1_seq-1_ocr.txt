In Artenms Ward's classical story enti

Siiuaw of tho .Suake-heads," publishetl in
Vanity Fair, we liiid the following exqui
site chapter, in which the characteristics
of great men in times of great public and
personal peril, are depicted in a style that
some of our contemporaries would in an
emergency term "graphic" :
It became daily more and moro evident
that a battle was imminent The Silver

An ertc.ui States is in many sections no sparse, that
skillful physicians are hardly avitilabie to them. Vact

themselves of this necessity tnpalm off their worthless

this iniquity, lie tilings not only his own, hut the best
skid of our times to bear, for the production of the
best remedies which can be made. These are-supplied
to the world, in a convenient form, at low prices, and
the people will no mire buy poor medicines instead of
good, at the same cost, than they wid braa instead of
Hour. The inevitable consequence of this is, that the
vile compounds that flood our country are discarded
for those which honestly accomplish tlie end in view
which cure. Do ws over estimate its, importance, in

j The President's Message.1
Fellow Citizens cf the Senate, and Ilovse of
llrjrrtscniatives :
In the midst of unprecedented political
troubles, we have cause of great gratitude
to God for unusual good health and most
abundant harvests. You will not be sur
prised to learn that in the peculiar exi
gencies of the times, our intercourse with
foreign nations has been attended with
profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon
our own domestic aiEiirs.
A disloyal portion of the American peo
ple have, during the whole year, been en
gaged in an attempt to divide and destroy
the Union. A nation which endures fac
tious domestic divisions, is exposed to dis
respect abroad, and one party or both is
sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreiga in
tervention. Matious thus tempted to in
terfere, are not always able to resist the
counsels of seeming ex-podiency and un
generous ambition, although measures
adopted under such influences, seldom
fail to be unfortunate and injurious to
thoseaiopting them.
Thet-disloyal citizens of the United States
who have offered the ruiu of our country
in regard for the aid and comfort which
theyjkave invoued abroad, havo received
less patronage and encouragement than
they probably expected. If it were just
to suppose, a the insurgents have seemed
to assume, that fore'.'n rinfim.s in fbis
case 'z.l'.'-ui''d:u2
tnaty obligations, would act solely and
s liishly fur the most speedy r- .-torr.tion '
of comuurce, iticluding specially the ac
quisition of cotton, tho.-e nations appear
as yet not to havo seen their wav to their .

political importance, have been negotiated 1

priation be made to satisfy the rea-onable i statute law should be made as plain and
demands of the owners of the vessel for j intelligible as possible, and be reeluced to
her detention. J
1 repeat the reconimeiulation of my pre- i
etacessor in his annual message to Congrers j
in December last, in regard lo tne ensposi
tion of the surplus which will probably re
main, after satisfying the claims of Ameri
can citizens against China, pursuant to the
awards of tlie Commissioners under the
act of the 3d of March, 1S.V.'. If, however
it thould not be deemed advisable to car,
rv the recommendation into etlect, 1
would suggest that authority be given for
the nrincinal over the surplus
referred to in good securities with a view
to the satisfaction of such other claim of
our citizens against China, as are not un -
likely to arise herealtcr in the course ot
our extensive trade with that Empire.
15 v the act cf the 5th of August last, Con
gress authorized the riesident to instruct
the commanders of suitable vessels to de
fend themselves against and to capture
pirates. This authority has been exercis
ed in a single instance only. For the more
effectual protection of our extensive and
valuable commerce, in the Eastern seas,
especially, it seems to me that it would
also be "advisable to authorize ttie com
manders of sailing vessels to recapture anj
prizes which pirates may make of United
Slates vessels ami their cargoes, and con
sular courts established by law in Eastern
countries, to ae'juticato the cases in the
event that this shoulel not be objected to
by the local authorities.
If any good reason exists why we should
persevere longer in withholding our re
cognition of Jthe indepenelence and sover
eignty of Hay ti and Liberia, I am unable
todiscern. Unwilliug, however, to inau
gurate a novel policy in regard to them.
without the appropriation of Congress, I
submit for your consideration the expe
diency of an appropriation for maintaining
a Charge D' Allans near each of those
States. It does not admit of doubt that
important commercial advantages might
be secured by favorable treaties with
them.
The operations of the Treasury during
the period which has elapsed since your
adjournment, have been conducted with
signal success, The patriotism of the
people has placed at the disposal of the
Government the large means demanded
by the public exigencies.
Much of the national loan has been
taken bv citizens of the industrial elasse-

have beeii unable to give personal atten

inti i csiing in itself, anel so extensively and
intricately connected with the material
prosperity of the world. Through the
Secretaries of State and Interior, a plan or
system has been devised, and partly ma

of valuation, iu lieu, pro rata, of direct
taxes, or upon some other plan to bo
agreed on with such States respectively
that such persons, on such acceptance by
th- general o;overnmer.t, be at onco deemed
free, and that, in any event, steps be takers
for colonizing both classes, or the one firttv
mentioneel if the other shall be brought,
into existence, at some place er place in
a climate congenial to them. It might be
well to consider, too, whether th fre
colored people in the United States could
not, so far as individuals may desire, bo
included in such colonization. To carry
out the plan of colonization may inrolve
the acquiring of territory, aud also toe
appropriation of money beyond that tobe
expended in the territorial acquisition.
Having practiced the acquisition of terri
tory for nearly fifty years, the qestion of
Constitutional power to do so is no longer
an open one with us. The power was firet
questioned by Mr. Jtfl'erson, who, howerer,
in the j. un base of Louisiana, yielded hi
scruples on the plea of great expediency.
If it be said that the only legitimate ob
ject of acquiring territory is to furnish
homes for white men, this measure effect
that object: for the emigration of colored
men leaves additional room forwhite mess
remaining or coming here, Mr. JeffersoBT-.
however, placed the importance of proottr
