THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Contrary to expectations the Prcs
i lent's message read before Congress
Tuesday, is quite a lengthy document.
I le touches upon many subjects but for
uost part confines himself to the work
of giving an account of his adminis
tration duiing the past year. Perhaps
the most interesting feature of the
whole document is the discussion oi
the tariff. The Richmond Times
comments on this part of the mes
sage as follows :
Mr. Harrison frankly admits that
t'.ie American people have most
emphatically reversed that policy,
..lthough he carefully omits mention
ing the fact that the verdict of the
people, given on the Sth of November,
was only a repetition of that two years
ngo, only that this time it was uttered
in such decided tones as to leave no
possible In pe that they would ever
hnnge their minds, at least until the
policy of tariff reform had been fail ly
tried and found wanting.
There i slight evidence, however,
that Mr. Harrison is amenable to the
riiiht. The most important part of
1 is message is in realtiy but a forced
argument 1 r protection, but he emits
a gleam of the light of reason. He
winds up tl it portion of his message
vi which hj treats of this subject, as
f llows :
"Those v ho have advocated a pro
tective tari T can well afford to have
L eir disastrous forecasts of a change
ot policy disappointed. If a system of
c istoms du.ies can be framed that will
si t the idle wheels and looms of Europe
in motion : nd crowd our warehouses
with foreign -made goods, and at the
sime time keep our mills busy, that
w ill give us an increased participation
in the mar ;etsof the world' of greater
value than .he home market we sur
render ; that will give increased work
t,i foreign workmen upon products to
l-e consumed by our people without
diminishing the amount to be done ;
that will enable the American manu
facturer to pay to his workmen from
5-v to a 100 per cent, more in wages
than is paid in the foreign mill, and
yrt to compete in our market and
K reign markets with the foreign pro
ducer ; that will further reduce the
o. st of articles of wear and without
reducing the wages of those who pro
d :ce them ; that can be celebrated
a; er its effects have been realized as
its expectation has been in European
as well as in American cities, the
aurhors and promoters of it will be
er titled to the highest praise."
Here he asserts that there is a possi
bility that a tariff law can be framed
which will, while increasing the com
nierce of the country, also substan
tially benefit American industries and
the American workman. It is just
sue h a tariff law as this that the Demo
crats propose to enact, and if they
succeed they will receive, as Mr.
Harrison says they should, the highest
praise from the entire country.

JAY GOULD DEAD.
The great railroad king and many
times millionaire Jay Gould, in some
particulars the most remarkable man
of his time, is dead. He passed away
at his home in New York city at 9:15
o'clock Friday morning, the direct
cause of his death being pulmonary
consumption. The dispatches say he
had never rallied after he had a
hemonhage of the lungs on the day
before Thanksgiving. He had another
hemorrhage two days later and still
another on Wednesday following.
This announcement was a great sur
prise to all but most intimate acquaint
ances of Mr. Gould. It had all along
been supposed that he was suffering
from nervous dyspepsia.
ESSAYISTS FOR THE PRESS ASSO
CIATION. For the next session of the North
Carolina Press Association, which will
be held in New Berne next May, the
following members have been appointed
by President E. E. Hilliard, of the

REWARD THE EDITORS.
Paul Jones, writing from Tarboro to
the News and Observer, pays a tribute
to the services rendered by the Demo
cratic press of the State during the
last campaign. He says :
Although the election is over, and
things in the political world have to a
certain extent quieted down, yet there
are still many grave and serious ques
tions to consider, and one of which I
shall mention is that of appointments
to the different public offices through
out our State and nation, made vacant
by the retirement of the Republican
party.
If the question arises, who are the
men to fill these vacancies, a fair
answer would most assuredly be, those
men who have labored most for the
success of the Democratic party. Now,
Mr. Editor, when we look over the
just past campaign and see how the
press of our own dear native State
have labored and toiled to educate the
people in the ways of Democracy,
when we see with what boldness our
editors have stormed the very strong
holds of Republicanism and Third
party ism, when we see how nobly and
fearlessly they have upheld the speak
ers of the Democratic party every
where and on all occasions, how, sir,
can we but say, give them the choice
and reward them for duty well per
formed. It is my own private opinion,
sir, that the press of North Carolina
did more towards the success of the
Democratic party than ail the com
bined forces elsewhere.
Whenever it can be done, let our
editors have the appointments. Let
cur prominent men have an eye to
this. Let them not for conscience's
sake pass the editors by unnoticed,
for they of all men, deserve recogni
tion at the hands of the appointing
power. Most respectfully,
Paul Jones.
CLEVELAND ON OFFICE SEEKERS.
"The morning callers whom I have
been obliged to receive would not, I
think, have encroached upon my time,
if they had given the matter a mo
ment's reflection. Those who have
called upon me to talk about offices,
it seem:; to me, have been a little in
considerate, and certainly premature.
I desire you to give as much publicity
as possible to the statement that I do
not propose to "consider applications
for office prior to my inauguration,
and I shall avoid all interviews on
that subject. Those who under any
pretence gain an opportunity to pres
ent their applications, and those who
burden me at this time with written
applications, cannot possibly do any
thing which wuuld so interfere with
their chances of success. Written
applications will be so little regarded
that I doubt if they ever see the files
in Washington, for there is no reason
or decency in my being overwhelmed
with such matters at this time." N.
V. Letter in Charlotte Observer.

This gentleman is endorsed for col
lector of Internal Revenue for the
Eastern District of North Carolina in
a communication before us by one of
the most prominent and influential
citizens of the State. There
is not a truer Democrat in the world
than Capt. Kitchin, and he has ever
been of the advance guard in every
battle for the maintenance of Demo
cratic principles. His services should
be properly recognized, and we hope
the.y will lie. We go Senator Vance
one better and say that the horse which
pulls the plow should not only have
the fodder but the corn too. State
Chronicle.
No State in the Union deserves
more credit for the part it bore in the
late election than does North Caro
lina. The old North State was before
the campaign selected as one of the
points at which to drive the wedge
that would split the solid South. The
People's party was the wedge and the
Republican party the sledge. But the
conspirators reckoned without their
host. The true men of North Caro
lina stood, as they always have, loyal
to their State and the South, and
routed utterly the combination against

CAPT. S. A. ASHE.
We are not much given to compli
ment, but we are a stern believer in
justice, and there is one man in North
Carolina who has claims upon the
Democratic party that is a simple
claim of justice and condensation.
The delicate question of the late
campaign was how to deal with the
Third party. It was a serious and an
alarming Question. Democrats con
fronted it like Macbeth the ghost of ! turers m the State- Under same date

Mr. Cleveland has, much to his
regret, left Hog Island for the North.
He is inclined to an out of door life,
and has enjoyed himself very much
upon Virginia soil. He hopes to
revisit the scene of his skill as a hunts
man and sportsman, but the duties of
his office will not permit of as pro
longed a stay next time. It is greatly
to be hoped that our next President
has laid in a stock of health during
his stay in old Virginia, which will
stand him in good stead while wrest
ling with the cares, duties and re
sponsibilities of his exalted position.
Richmond Times.
The weekly papers of North Caro
lina, though now in the wake of the
splendid victory, are scarcely thought
of as contributing anything to the
result, nevertheless they were, if we
may be pardoned for so saying, a very
great faction in bringing it about.
The editors worked manfully for
Democracy without the hope of re
ward. They wanted no office, nor
were they thinking of such a thing.
Yet, we fear their work is not appre
ciated. We make a plea for the rec
ognition of their work, at least.

OUR SENIOR SENATOR.
Hon. Matt W. Ransom.
The Charlotte Observer has a com
plimentary article referring to the
public and patriotic services of Senator
Ransom, in which it enumerates some
of the notable events of Senator Ran
som's history. His first distinction
mentioned by the Observer was his
election by the Legislature in 1847,
when 27 years old, to the office of
Attorney General of North Carolina.
But in fact his distinction had pre
ceded him from the University before
he put on the toga of manhood. He
had at the University competed for the
highest honors of scholarship with
Pettigrew, a phenomiual genius in
mathematics, Ransom being his
superior as an orator and bellelettre
scholar and his equal as a classical
scholar.
But. the Observer deals only with
his post-natal honors. He became
distinguished in the legal profession
after leaving school and when the Civil
War burst upon us he became a
cavalry officer and rose to a General's
command. After the war he was our
first Senator and has always held in
that body a high rank for ability, con
servatism, courtesy, and wisdom in
counsel.
The Observer refers in laudatory
terms of the conduct to Seuator Ran
som, in the habeas corpus proceedings
beftre Judge Brooks, growing out ot
the Kirk outrages under the administra
tion of Governor Holden. It was to
Senator Ransom and Judge Brooks
that the release of our most worthy
citizens from incarceration during that
brutal reign of terror, was due. To
Senator Ransom for discovering the
legal process by which they could be
released, and to Judge Brooks for
putting in execution his Judicial
authority for the accomplishment of
their release. When that glorious
judicial act of Judge Brooks-is com
memorated in marble by North Caro
lina, the name of Matt. W. Ransom
should accompany its commemoration,
for Matt. Ransom blazed the way by
the light of the Federal statute which,
unintentionally, placed in the hands
of Geo. W. Brooks, a Federal Judge,
the power of releasing our most dis
tinguished citizens from a felon's cell.
The Observer also refers to Senator
Ransom as a popular speaker and to
the service he has rendered in North
Carolina in many of her campaigns.
There is no question that Matt. Ran
som is a born orator. As a dialectic
orator he ranks next to -Gaston in
North Carolina history as a public
a u r " U,V u-
dress he is Gaston s equal; in grace -
fulness of elocution he is his superior.

The election ot Mr. Cleveland
seems rather to have improved the
labor market. A dispatch from Provi
dence, R. I., says: "The Lonsdale
Company and the firm of B. B. & R.
Knight notified their employes to-day
of an increase in wages, to go into
effect December 5 th. The amount
of the proposed increase is not given
out. This action will doubtless be
followed by the other cotton rnanufac
vvmsion oennnei.
Some idea of the size oi the multi-
tude which will cross the Atlantic to
visit the World s ran next year may
be gained from the fact mentioned in
a Sun cablegram that nearly 3,5 00
members of the Regent street Poly-
technic have already engaged passage
Washington Letter.
Washington, Dec. 5, 1892
Editor Gold Leaf: "The house will
olease be in order," were the words of
Speaker Crisp as the hand on the big
centuated by a sharp rap with the gavel
he held uplifted in his right hand; and
the last session of the Fifty-second Con
gress was open for business. The at
tendance was fairly good for an opening
session, although the number of empty
8eats on the Demoeratic side wfisentirelv
too large for those who fear that absen-
teeism may give the party leaders as
ed yiew of the fllture but rather. give
the Democratic members of the House
credit for sufficient love of party and
patriotism to see that a Democratic
quorum is not lacking at any time when
it becomes desirable to have it present,
and that is practically all the time.
Mr. Harrison's annual message will
not go to Congress until to-morrow, but
your correspondent has read it, although
it was an onerous duty to wade through
its more than 15,000 words, and not a
pleasure. It strikes me as being in the
nature of a skillful lawyer's plea for the
acts of the present administration and
for the legislation of the Republican on
grs, and an altogether useless and
unnecessary one, inasmuch as the court
of final appeal the people rendered its
verdict in the case nearly a month ago.
The general style of it is far below that
of those previously written by Mr. Har
rison; but, come to think of it the circum
stances under which this message was
prepared were such as to make it unfair
to criticise it from a literary point of
view. It demonstrates one thing very
clearly. Mr. Harrison still clings to pro
tection and the other Republican ideas
which were so overwhelmingly condemned
by the American voters on the eighth of
last month.
The attendance at the opening session
of the Senate was better proportionately
than that in the House, but that may
have. been largely owing to the fact and
by a resolution adopted at the last ses
sion the anti-option bill was made the
regular order for to-day, which gives
that measure, which it will be remem
bered has already passed the House,
the right of way as unfinished busi
ness until it shall have been disposed
of or the session shall come to a close.
There is a decided difference of opinion
as to whether this bill will be disposed
of by vote of the Senate or by the close
of the session. Its opponents claim that
enough Senators from the South have
changed their minds about the bill to
make it certain that they can defeat it
on a direct vote, but all the same they
are now scheming to prevent a vote
being taken.
There are a number of important
measures, from a Democratic standpoint,
which may be brought forward and
passed by the House at this session or
may be held until the beginning of the
Fifty-third Congress, just as the Demo
cratic conference or caucus, shortly to
be held, may decide. It is believed that
there are enough Republican Senators
willing to vote with the Democrats to
repeal the present silver law, provided
an agreement can be reached on a substi
tute, and some of them have expressed
themselves as favoring a return to the
Bland law if nothing more satisfactory
can be arranged. No help is expected by
Democrats from the International mone-
Ltary conference, now sitting, in solving
me silver prooiem.
Unless several Republican Senators
shall vote differently from the way they
talk it is probable that the House bills
for the admission to Statehood of New
Mexico and Arizona will be taken up
and passed by the Senate at this session.
This is very desirable for several reasons,
not the least of which is that -it is be
lieved that both States will send Demo
cratic United States Senators in time to
take their seats next winter.
The cholera scare is being worked for
all it is worth to work up sentiment in
Congress in favor of a suspension of im
migration for one year, and it is to a
certain extent succeeding. Once con
vince Congress that there is real danger
of the cholera getting a foothold in this
country next year, through immigration,
and the vote will be unanimous in tfavor
of suspension, notwithstanding the ef
forts of the steamship lobby. .
A majority of the Democrats in this
Congress appear to think that present
indications point to the neoessity for an
extra session of the next Congress, and
those in a position to know say that
Mr. Cleveland is of the same mind. It is
the work of this Congress which will de
cide whether that extra session will have
to be held in the spring or whether it can
safely be postponed until the fall.

A Remarkable History.
We recently published a strongly com
mendatory notice of "Alden's Cyelopedia
of History." In the interest of our read
ers we wish to repeat and emphasize
what we said. A good Universal History
ought to be in every home; this is cer
tainly excellent, if not the very best for
general use and reference ever published,
covering all nations (except United States
to be published separately) and from
B.C. to a. d. 1892. Certainly it is the
cheapest historical work we have ever
seen; but that is what readers generally
will expect from Mr. Alden, who has
done so much to place the highest class
of literature within popular reach. To
get such a vast amount of matter within
such small compass the type used is
necessarily small, but it is beautifully
clear, and the paper, printing and bind
ing are of the best. Send 10 cents to
Mr. Alden and he will send you a sample
volume of 160 pages, containing the his
tory of several nations complete, by
which you can juge for yourself whether
you want the entire work. Hiscatalogue
of choice books, 128 pages, sent post
paid for 2 cents, presents a wonderfnl
feast for book lovers. Address John B.

THE STATE VOTE.
Gov. Carr's Majority Nearly
Beaches The 40,000 Mark.
The canvassing board completed its
work yesterday afternoon. The canvass
of the Gubernatorial vote showed that
the plurality of Carr over Furches for
Governor was 39,761. It would have
run over 40,000 if the returns from every
county had been sent in but for some
reason four counties failed to send in the
retur for State officers. They were
Wilkes, Vauce, Duplin and Onslow.
The following are totals received by
the various candidates as shown by the
canvass, the third named candidates
being the Gideonites and the fourth the
Prohibitionists:

The December! Cosmopolitan.
In view of the fact that SirEdwin Arnold
will ve,ry likely be the next poet-laureate,'
one turns with interest to his most enter
taining article in the December Cosmopol
itan on a "Japanese Watering Place."
The same number contains seven por
traits of Tennyson and interesting views
of his home and surroundings. Thos.
Gorman has penetrated the mysteries of
the silent trappists' monastery with a
profane kodak ; Mnrat Halstead dis
cusses "Varieties of American Journal
ism;" Herrmann throws "Light on the
Black Art" and Theodore Roosevelt and
Maurice Thomson each contribute inter
esting articles. A feature of the number
is twenty-four portraits of Parisian jour
nalists, with sketches of their work. A
curious bit is found in thecontrast of the
double frontispieces which adorn the
magazine on one side the marvelous
painting of "The Conquerors," by Fritel,
which attracted so much attention at
the last Paris salon, and on the other
"The Conquered," by Anton Dietrich; in
the one the heroes of war moving down
the vista of the centuries in magnificent
array between ghastly lines of naked
corpses, the other the unfortunate of all
times and lands flocking beneath the
gentle hand of the loving Christ. The
Cosmopolitan will mark its first edition of
150,000 copies that of January by the
offer of 1,000 free scholarships. In return
for introducing the Cosmopolitan into cer
tain neighborhoods the Cosmopolitan offers
to any young man or woman free tuition,
board, lodging and laundry at Yale,
Vassar, Harvard, or any of the leading
colleges, schools of art, music, medicine,
or science. They send out a pamphlet
telling how to obtain one of these free
scholarships. Address the Publishers, at
New York City.

SIMPLY A QUESTION
OF
i
Sensible people are not
apt to be controled by senti
ment when it comes to part
ing1 with their hard-earned
cash purchasing the every
day necessaries of life. The
contemplation of a purchase
resolves itself into a question
of dollars and cents. And the
wise buyer takes into account
how much he can save before
he parts with his money.
Knowing this, we merely
ask you to call and
EXAMINE OUR GOODS,
Compare prices with others
and exercise your own judg
ment. It is a question of dol
lars and cents, and we can
make it to your interest to
trade with us. Here are the
goods to suit you no doubt
about that. The next thing
then .is look into the matter
of prices. We have no ap
prehension on that point.
Come and see for yourself.
You will find that we have a
large and carefully selected
line of
General Merchandise,
Embracing everything in
Dry Goods and Notions, Hats
ind Caps, Hoots and Shoes,
White Goods, Tin, Crockery,
Glass and Wooden ware, &c,
&c. Also a full and complete
stock of pure and fresh
Stai aid Fancy Grows,
Such a - Hour, Meat, Meal,

fee, Butter, Cheese. Crackers,
Canned Goods, Lard, Salt,
Fish, Hams, Breakfast Bacon,
&c, &c. We keep also Hay,
Bran, Shipsluffs, and Oats,
which we sell at lowest prices.
We buy all our Flour, Salt,
Hay and Shipstuffs in car
load lots, and can sell these
goods by the large or small
quantity at prices that can
not be shaded by any other
dealer in Henderson.
Family trade respectfully
solicited. Prompt and care
ful attention to the wants of
our customers.
Very Respectfully,
