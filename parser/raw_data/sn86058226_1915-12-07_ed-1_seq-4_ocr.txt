'If ?f.1 President Wilson's Message
President Wijson. today presented the most
forceful message he has asked the American con
gress to consider. The document centered about
the preparedness program and the chief execu
tive endorsed the plans made public by Secretary
Garrison and Secretary Daniels. He asked for
more men and ships, and asked congress to pass
laws making effective the plans outlined by the
secretary of the army and the secretary of the
navy.
The American people have been aroused to
the weakness of the army and the navy and to
the need of military and naval preparedness.
President Wilson's plea for legislation, to bring
about adequate defenses to repel invasion echoes
the sentiment of the American people as a . whole.
Europe's great war has thrust upon the Ameri-
can people the awful truth that our boundaries
are open to invasion at many points and that our
army and navy are absolutely inadequate to re
pel a designing foe and to protect our country. A
bigger army and a bigger navy are needed. Both
Democrats and Republicans in the lower house
ought unite on the broad basis of patriotism and
remove the danger by the enactment of a meas
ure sufficiently broad to bring relief.
The chief executive voices a patriotic senti
ment and one that will appeal to every true
American when he denounces in unqualified
terms those aliens who have become American
citizens;' but still are "preaching and practicing
disloyalty", by f participation in plots . against
American neutrality. Nefarious dynamiting of
munition plants making supplies for foreigners
setting fire to plants engaged in the same work
and connivance with foreign- agenta in schemes
designed to benefit any of the belligerents are in
essence; treason against the United ' States. We
cannot deny that an alien always' will have sym
pathetic interest in the welfare of his. former
country, but we insist, with the president, that
when a foreigner swears allegiance to the United
States he becomes an 'American; and his "whole
soul, all his opinions, all, his deeds,, fought 'to 'be
American.. Ah American cannot serve two mas-
tersV v He must be an American ;-This applies
both to British andGeiTOana..
TKe president is right in 3nsis.tingCthat f'such
creatures of disloyalty H and anarchjr. must be
crushed out'-and the hand of out power should
close over them at once." The blowing up of mu
nition plants to stop -munition shipments is -re
course to anarchy and mob spirit,! The men . de
signing these .plots and those conniving at their
execution forfeit all rights to be called American
citizens. : l'f .
' It cannot .be gainsaid that the European, war
has made the problem of national revenue a diffi
cult and trying one. Some sort , of plan to re
habilitate the finance of the nation is heeded.
President Wilson puts this problem squarely -up
to Congress,
l .The president has little new to say regarding
the domestic problems, matters which' he says he
will leave to the discretion of congress. -
His conclusion is the patriotic - sentiment : ;
"For what we are- seeking' how, what in my
mind is the single, thought of this message, ; is
national efficiency and security. We serve a
great nation.- We would serve it in the spirit of
its peculiar geniusr It is the genius of common
men for self government, industry, justice lib
erty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks
no instrument, no faeilityor vigor of law tomake
it sufficient to play its part With energy, safety
and assured success. In this We are no parti
sans, but heralds and prophets of a new age."

A press -dispatch from Richmond to
the Chicago Inter-Ocean in August;
1888, has the following to say about
Governor Foraker's . speech., here
against Cleveland and Of the political.
demonstration that was held : -". . . -
The first big gun In the political
battle of Hoosier soil, was.,, fired , in
this city today and there was . a big
array in the field filled with unwont
ed zeal. This is the seat of govern
ment for Wayne, the leading Republi
can county of Indiana, and it is to be
expected that when the adherents of
that party make a da of it they will
make a big One, but in -nineteen years"
newspaper experience here your cor
respondent has never seen the enthusi
asm of this day duplicated." In fact,
the? pld: veterans of. 1840, who were
numerous in the demonstration,' there
being "several" wagon and' divers car
riage loads, of them, including about a
hundred from sister towns in. Ohio,
and not a few of them 'who were over
80 year a of age, say they never saw
it. duplicated but twice in 1840 and
again in 1856. Nothing so delighted
the. old Tippecanoe fellows as the ap
pearance of the log' cabins on wheels,
brought in; by delegations, while' all of"
them were done up according to tradi
tt on with coon-skins and other pelts;
live coons and other animals, alive and
dead. One cabin was made still truer
in its representation by a back porch,
in which a chap in female attire was
preparing dinner on a stove for the old
men who sat waiting with friends.
While these delegations continued to
arrive there also came long excursion
trains filled to repletion, and tit
crowds on the street swelled until
the enthusiastic doubled the . figures
that the conservative placed at 20.000
lin estimating the number of Strang
ers in tne city. Tne processions were
picturesque and the speeches enlivening.

Corrects Stubborn Case
of Constipation.
An important duty that-devolves on
parents is the regulation of their chil
dren's bowels.- Health in later life de
pends in large measure on early train
ing and a child should be taught from
infancy to regular habits.
When from any cause the bowel be
comes congested with stomach waste
a mil laxative should be employed- to
open up the passage' gently and, carry
off the congested mass.. . A most ef
fective remedy for this purpose is the
combination of simple . laxative herbs
known as Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin.
Mrs. W: D. Bulls, of Reed, Okla.; used
Xr. Caldwell's Syr-up Pepsin forher

says "It did him more good thany-any

they act easily every time I give him
