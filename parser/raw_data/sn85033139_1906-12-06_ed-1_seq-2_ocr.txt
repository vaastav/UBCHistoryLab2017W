Dot proposed that tiny verdict lor the (]■•- i

hamper the government In its efforts to on

to the government the right to have the
supreme court definitely decide the qnes

Setting Aside Judgments.
In eonin lion with this matter the Presi
dent culls attention to the unsatisfactory
state of our criminal I iw. .resulting In “
large part from the hat'll of setting aside
the judgments of Inferior courts on tecliul
callties absolutely nucomieeted with the
merits of the ease, and wlo ie (here la no
attempt to show that there has been any
failure of subsi nthil JnMb 'l ie Pi - do at
asks for a :.nv providing that no Judgment

any ease, • ...; or criminal, mi the ground of
misdlrc lion of the Jury or the Improper ad

unless, in the opinion of the court to who h
tic api'lieaileii Is made, after an examine
t!" i of the i nine case, it shall affirmatively
appeal that the error eomplalnetl of has re
sulted In a miscarriage of Justice.
Injunctions Are Necessary.
The President believes It would be wrong
n; and probably invalid t" abolish the power
of InJ jnctle;Put he thinks that so far
as is possible some law should be passed
which would prohibit the abuse of the
power. He helb ves the power of lujune
tlon Is necessary, and that no judge should
hesitate to a e such power In dealing with
disorder, le- does not think It proper to
t ....
betterment in lawful and peaceful ways,
nor does he appro'i of Using the InJuu
tlonul power I" aid some big corporation
It
grandUement, but he believe Judges sb.ui.'d
wield their power to prohibit any resort
to violence or Intimidation, esje-i tally by
conspiracy, no matter what their opinion
may be of the rights of tho original ijuar
re I.

Lynching a Growing Danger
In couiieeiloti with the lavs of Ho law
the Pn ' . cut all-, i to- attenilon of I'm
gress to Hie ).te’,ah ace of lynching and
mob violence He says that the greatest
existing cm. e of lynching, especially of
block men, Is tho hideous crime of rape
"the most abominable In fill the category
of crimes, even worse than murder." He
sny.s that when mobs begin to lynch for
rape th'.v peedlly extend the sphere of
their opm lions and lynch for many other
kinds of crime, so that two thirds of the ■
lynching!* are not for rajic at all; while a
considerable portion of the Individuals j
lynched are Innocent of all crime. There i
Is but one safe rule In dealing with the
black men as with white men; It Is the j
an me rule that must he applied In dealing ,
with the ileh and i r men. that la to
treat each man. whatever lib color, his
creed, or his aortal position, with even '
' real i
man Tin :' is no question of "social e.|tial- I
Ity" or "m i ro domination" Involved; only!
tlie question of punishing laid men and i
protecting tie good. The President ays
that i'eiy oiluri 'l man should r< allze that 1
bis wor-t ■ .eniy is the n. gro rrlmlnal and
should help the officers of Hie law In pun ,
Idling the guilty.
“Moreover, In inv Judgment,” say- the
President; ' th" crime of tape should al
ways be i iin bed with death, as In the
cos"' with murder; assault with Intent to
commit raj" should be made a capital
crime, at lea t at tin- discretion of the ,

Withdrawal of Coal Lands.

government to alh nati* Its remaining coal
lands He suggests legislation whleh would
provide for the withdrawal of these lands
Iron, sale or entry, save In certain special
circumstance- li" thinks the government
cmld penult them lo he worked on a roy
ally and control them so that excessive
prices ould not he charged consumers. The
control of common earners so that they
would not favor one competitor at the ex
pense of atioth* r must also be provided for
in the hill.
Corporations.

the pure food law and the packing house
regulations should not he touched this s.-s
slot,, according lo the President. They
should he given an opportunity to show
their merits and shortcomings He suggests,
how. wr, that a law be passed providing for
the putting of n date on the label of pack
ing house products and the charging of the
cost of Inspection to the packers.
All the corporation laws have justified
their enactment. The President points out
that In the face of predictions that the In
let.--late commerce law would ml i the rail
muds, the lust live months show. fi Increased
earnings and unusual dividends and that
the in -re taking effect of the law had pro
duced ah unprecedented number of volun

. "ii,o law would prevent the evils of over
capitalization and put a stop to the se
eming of Inordinate profits by favored In
divid, ils at Hie expense whether of the
geneliil public, the stockholders or the
wage workers. He does wish so much lo
prevent consolidation hut to supervise and
control so that no harm Is done to the
people 111" best way ro avert III" very
undesirable move for government owner
ship of railroads Is to secure by the gov
i rnmeiit on behalf of the people as a whole
such (ide.pnite control and regulation of
the great Interstate commou carriers as
will do away with the evils which give
rise to the agitation against them. The
effort to prohibit nil combination, good or
had, is noxious where It is not eifoetlve.
Combinations of capital like combinations
of labor, Is a necessary clement of our
present Industrial svstem What Is need
ed is control of the combination*. Ii is un
fortunate that our present laws should
forbid all combinations. Instead of sharpie
discriminating between the good and hud.
often railroads would llko to eoinhlne for
tie- p-n-po-e of preventing a big shipper
ti 11.,, th" Standard oil company) from
maintaining Improper advantage at the ex- :
pense of small shippers and the gen
eral public. Such combination should he
favored not prohibited. It Is a public evil
to have a law on tho statute hooks Ineiipn

I that after ear. fill Investigation ,

to obviate the evils dl.-elosed
Inheritance and Income Tax.
A graduated Inheritance and income tax
Is ia commended. Ih- President says a man
of great wealth owes n peculiar obligation
to tin- i.tat", because he derlvis sp-elal ad
’.ant ig* a froill the mere existence Of g'H
, n. and ■dioulil pay for the proleeilou
!... He advocates distributing the
harden of taxation more equally than it Is
| at pi-sent. Treat the rich and pour on a
basis of equality. The Pn Huh nt wishes to
, encourage thrift and in'gi s that the liicnme
tax he made vi ry small on nioderale
1 nmonnls of protn riy I* ft nnd make it much
heavier when tin- gift goes (o some remote
lof kin. He would im rease the biinlen eh
the Inheritance of those swollen fortunes
which are of no lienellt to this country to
perpetuate. He urges gradual progress to
ward an Inheritance lax.
The President wants an Income tax and
nays i very effort should he made to enact
one without amending the constitution, hut
if (his falls be fu'ors a constitutional
amendment.

powerless itself to make defense, would

, itv from war but ean do
nothing to prevent the commission of a ,

Cuba.
The President explained his action In
Interfering In Cuba. He snld the Cuban
government had failed and It was neces
snry for the United States to net In order
to prevent some foreign power from step
ping lu, under guise of protecting Us sub
j.-ets When the elections are held In
Cuba and a government restored the Amer
lean troops and governor general will be
withdrawn. The United States wishes
nothing from Culm except that It prosper
morally and materially. If the Insurrec
tion habit becomes confirmed It will lie
necessary for the United States to st"p
In and terminate Cuba’s Independence.
America 1- Cuba’s sponsor and must see
that Ilf- and property are protected on the
Island.

near future on his Panama trip.

The- Senate Is asked to ratify the treaty.
Fur Seals.
The destruction of the Prlbllof Islands
fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues
and the seals are fast Ineomlng extinct
The pr slilent asks for swift action. The
stealing Is accompanied by fearful cruelty.
Second Hague Conference.
The President reports progr* ss In arrang
ing for the second Hague conference. No
date has as yet been llxed.
Peace and Righteousness.
W" should do nil In mir pow. r lo pre
serve pine", but also we should be pre
pared for war. says the President. A just
war Is better than peace ol.tallied by ne.
qules-enee In wrong or Injustice. 'The
i bane- for the settlement of disput s peace
fully, ny arhllialioti, now depends mainly
upon Hi" possession by th- nations that
mean to do right of Hullbdeiit armed
.strength to make their purpose effective.
The Army and N,.vy.
The lull'd States navy Is the sorest
guarantee of pi a* - which this country pos
sesses. The President dm ' 'i"t ask that the
navy be Increased but asks that it he main
tained nt Hs present strength. To stop
building ships for one year means that for
that year the navy goes hack instead of for
ward. Karh year one llrdt class battb ship,
equal to any In-ltig built by other nations,
should he built. Of course from time to
time cruisers and other warships must be
built. As onr ships are constantly wearing
out this progt.imm- would result In 1- • plug
the navy at its present strength.
The President urges that the best men be
secured for both the army and navy by of
fering all p" -slide encouragement to tho
enlisted men In pay ami otherwise. He de
sires that the y 'linger men be advanced
more rapidly ns too often tinder our present
system, ne n are not promoted to high posi
tions until He ir advanced age makes them
of little use.
The President points <mt that both the
army and mi'y illustrated Us readiness and
eflb i'-itey by Us rapidity In dealing with the
recent, crises in i Tib,i when the mobilization
and dispatch of troops over the sea was the
quickest on record it was u line illustra
tion of the value of the general staff.
The President closes hts message by urg
ing the establishment of shooting galleries
In till the public schools " In re frequent rifle
practice can he held. The little republic ot
Switzerland offers us an excellent example
In all matters connected with the building
up of an efficient i ilizeii soldiery, says the
President.

ARGUE INSURANCE REFORMS.
Judge Noyes Appears Before Slate Tax
Commission.
MADISON. Wis.. Dee. I. |5pe,. ; ,1.1
Kopresenliitives of the Northwestern'
Mutual Life Insurance company of .Mil
waukee appeared before the slate tax
commission on Monday to argue for •
lew law which they hope will reform in
surance taxation methods in Wisconsin.
Judge Noyes argued the matter, claiming
that tin* logical way of regulating the
business was to charge a license fee ol
s.7mi. and a tax upon the surplus accu
mulations In policies written in the state
or held here computed upon the same
bn os that otl er pr ipertj. 11*
contended that ibis was the reasonable
way. because the surplus is the profits
of the policy holders end may he con
sidered as their funds. This method
would not produce a tax aggregating as
much as the present method, but it
would adjust the tax burden more uni
formly and justly, it is claimed.
