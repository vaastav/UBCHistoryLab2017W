Four Pago Supplement.
In order to give nil tho news and accomo
date onr large advertising patronage, we issue
a four page supplement this week. It con
tains much valuable news matter and adver
ting, together with an exhaustive review of
the President's message, which deserves enre
fnl reading.
JSTIndiana's official vote gives Harrison a
plurality of 2,348.
iWhen Mr. Cleveland retires from the
White House he will be 62 years old.
J3JDe mocratic principles are right, and
like the eternal truth of God, will ultimately
prevail.
EP"Gen. Harrison's father-in-lnw has held
a government office all through President
Cleveland's term.
JjThe prohibition amendment to the
constitution of Virginia was snowed under
by a majority of 40,000.
"Cleveland has over 80,000 majority of
the popular vote, the Signal notwithstanding
to the contrary. This is over 18,000 more than
he had in 1884.
ISTThe Garrett (Ind.) Clipper remarks
that the Democratic party is still doing busi
ness at the old stand and after a furlough of
four years orders will again be taken for post
offices, clerkships, etc
J3?"Mr. E. Strone Wiggins, the wild weath
er prophet of Canada, is just now swollen to
the bursting point with indignation, because
he has been elected an honorary member of
the Boston Ananias Club.
tyThe Democrats of Ohio at the late elec
tion carried thirty-live of the eighty-eight
counties by majorities averaging 1,120 each.
They gained over their vote of four years ago
in every county in the State, and made net
gains in thirty-three counties.
JStfTA Republican in Wellsborough, Pa.,
illuminated his house because of the recent
victory. His wife, however, is a Democrat,
to she closed one blind on each window of
the domicile to show that one-half the firm
didn't sympathize with the demonstration.
ESTThe Republicans assassinated the last
President they placed in the White House,
because he failed to satisfy their greed for
office. They are likely to serve the one they
have just elected the same way, and the coon
try again be disgraced by the villainous act.
Blaine was the prime cause of the murder of
Garfield. He may play the same part with
the new Republican President.
SSTfte- newspapers which are assigning
John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, to the po
sition of the Secretary of the Treasury under
Mr. Harrison are not veil informed. Mr.
Wanamaker, undoubtedly raised and turned
more money into Quay's campaign treasury
than any other man in the country, but he is
an importing merchant and hence cannot
hold the position to which he has been as
signed without sacrificing his big store, which
bow covers a ten acre lot. 1
JStTThe Democratic plurality in this Con
gressional district on the candidate for Sec
retary pf State, which it will be remembered
was the head of the State ticket, was 015, and
yet a Republican candidate for Congress is
elected by 94. It's a burning shnme nnd a
reflection on the consistency of Democrats
and their loyalty to party principles'. We
have a Democratic district, yet the Republi
cans are sending a Representative to Con
gress. We meekly bow our heads in shame.
-l'avlding Democrat.
THE DEMOCRATIC NORTHWEST.
JSf Republicans hive great love for sol
diers and their widow, maimed soldiers es
pecially. Or at tant tlirf pretend to have
that great love, but generally when position
or spoils are concerned, the soldier or his
widow don't count any more than the usual
run of mankiud. A maimed soldier is now
holding tho position as postmaster of Na
poleon, and his commission won't expire
until probably a year after the Republican
President is inaugurated. Many question
whether he will be allowed to serve oat his
time, and no one believes he will be reap
pointed, although, remember, be is n one
armed soldier! Also, a soldier's widow i
holding the position as deputy under the
above named postmaster. Now, will this
great love (?) the Republicans have for the
widows of soldiers allow them to even retain
this dependent widow in the position she now
occupies, or give her any other position? We
have our doubts, and believe they are well ta
ken when we look over the hungry horde of
place-seekers brought to the surface through
the election of Harrison President.
If the Republicans wish to test this love for
the soldier, or practice what they preach, let
them re -appoint the present maimed soldier
and the soldier's widow. And if they can't
do this, let a maimed soldier of their own
choosing be made p. m., and a widow, equal
ly deserving as the present incumbent, be
made deputy! Will the Republicans do this?
Their past record answers "No!"
JSTThe law provides that the trustees of
any township, when notified in writing that
Canada thistles are about to go to seed on
any land within their township, shall cause
the thistles to be destroyed in time to pre
vent the seed from spreading, and make re
turn in writing to the board of county com
missioners, with their bill of expenses and
charges. The bill, when duly audited, is to
be paid ont of the county funds, and the
amount is then entered on the tax duplicate
against the land on which the thistles were
destroyed. The owner, lessee or agent of the
land must, however, be notified in writing by
some one interested, not less than five days
before the cutting of the thistles is done by
the trustees. The law also provides that the
"owner, occupier or possessor" of land on
which Canada thistles are allowed to go to
seed shall be fined $20.
' J3fWhile the Congressmen from the North
vary in fortune from $30,000,000 down to
practically nothing at all, the Southern mem
bers are all comparatively poor. The riohest
Southern member in the House of the Fit
tieth Congress is Nathan Goff, of West Vir
ginia, Republican candidate for Governor of
that State at the late election. The only
Southern members who reach $100,000 are
Governor McCreary, of Kentnoky, and Gen
erals Bankhead and W. H. F. Lee, of Alaba.
ma. The former is a farmer and both had
Borne of their fortunes left from fine estates,
before the war. The opposition of the trusts
and other big capitalistic concerns of the
North to legislation coming from the South
is due to the fact, that Southerners being
poor seek means to curtail the extraordinary
absorption of national wealth by these con
cerns. SAn exchange says that the editor of
the Ohio Farmer has been going through the
statistics of the destruction of sheep by dogs
in Ohio, since the law providing for the pay
ment of them by the county commissioners
has been in operation, or since 1880. In that
time there have been 432,820 sheep killed
in this State by dogs. Then he falls into
philosophizing over it in this way: "Here is
a grand total of 432,820 sheep killed and in
jured, the value of which was $215,707.45, and
every one of which was a dead loss to the
wealth of the State. It is safe to assume that
there are over 390,030 dogs in Ohio,and it ooBts
five dollars a year to feed each one, making
an additional dead loss to the State of $1,600,
000 a year, or a grand total of over $13,000,
000 that the dogs of Ohio have cost daring
the past eight years. Are they worth it?"
ISf-The St. Louis Republic suggests a trib
ute to President Cleveland in the following
words:
"The Democracy of this nation would do
itself credit by organizing a great national
reception in honor and in admiration of the
sterling honesty, indomitable courage, wise
statesmanship and unselfish patriotism of the
present executive Grover Cleveland. Let this
demonstration be held in the sejond week of
March, 1889, as he retires from the office in
which he served the people so well and faith
fully. And, sir, let it be given him in the city
of New York, where the traitors accomplish
ed their unhallowed work. Let the great
heart ot the national Democratic party give
expression to its feelings in this manner. It
wid be a fitting tribute to a great and trusted
public servant, such a one as the Democracy
has not known since the days of Jackson."
These are our sentiments exactly.
S3?"Tohn Culliton, head porter of the Grand
Pacific Hotel in Chioago, is worth over $100,-
000, and is said to'be the wealthiest porter in
the world. He has been bead porter for a
soore of years, being now past fifty years of
age. While ho does very little work, aside
from announcing trains and giving informa
tion, he oan give his brawny young men
points on handling big trunks when so dis
posed. He is a walking railroad and hotel
guide, an amusement bulletin, and about the
best city directory Chicago has. The head
porters of all the big Chicago hotels are
wealthy, and all have their money invested in
real estate.
tSTMohn Caruth, cotton manufacturer of
Philadelphia, has reduced the wages of his
employes 10 per cent, since election. James
Kerr, who also owns a cotton factory has
done the same thing. The Frank Lear Starr
mills resumed work Thursday, with a 30 per
cent, reduction on wages. Thus, says the
Philadelphia Record, "is the seed of tariff re
form for future fruitage being sown."
tSrTVan Wert Times says: Millionaire
Bushnell, of Springfield, O., who wants the
next Republican nomination for Governor,
told a newspaper reporter that he sent money
in this district to help Boothman. Money
was also sent from Cincinnati into Paulding
county for the same purpose. The size of
the corruption fund that was raised to defeat
Mr. Saltzgaber would, if made known, cause
pnblio wonder.
One Bryan saloon keeper was offered $150
if he would support Boothman, and $50 ad
ditional if he would induce a certain other
Democrat to do likewise. One man at Mont
pelier was offered $0 to support Boothmnn.
Doubtless other influential men were offered
similar sums to support Boothman. It is no
torious that at two or three polling plnces
voters were bought at prices ranging from
$2 to $5 each. An effort to punish one of
the vote merchants failed by one vote to
pass the grand jury. Bryan Dem.

city:
WARNING.
This is to warn a certain class of men that
are in the habit of getting drunk and abusing
their families, and not providing for their
support, that, if they do not try and do some
thing for them soon they will receive a visit
from the White Caps.

Opinion is divided as to whether it is a hoax,

Ii7The rotten borough of Nevada cost in
1876, 19,691 votes; in 1880, 18,343; in 1884, 12,
771; in 1888 about 10,000. Here is a loss of
nearly 150 per cent, of the total vote of the
State in twelve years and the decrease is con
stantly going on. This shows that Nevada,
with less than one-fourth of the votes cast in
the city of Cleveland, is represented in Con
gress by two United States Senators and one
Representative. It shows that the Republi
can party will control both branches of Con
gress by reason of the three representatives
of that insignificant rotten little wart. Those
Republicans who have been howling about
the nnequal representation from certain
southern States would do well to turn their
attention for a moment to Nevada. Plain

J35TUnder the present partisan Republican
gerrymander in Ohio there are at least 250,

the Democrats can have no show of carrying
one-half of the districts which by right and
justice belong to them. Plain Dealer.

OBITUARY.
It beoomeB our aad duty to chronicle the death of
another pioneer of Flatrook townahlp. in the perion
of Jacob Lnmhardy. who was born February ihaid,
188. and died Nov. S6'h. WS, aged 66 jreara, 9
miutha and 4 daya. The deceased waa a native of
Kiaenbangh, Germany, he and his companion hav
ing emigrated to America In the year 1KM and lo
cated in Tuncsrawas County, Ohio, and remained at
that place about four years ; then moved to Heury
Oounry, Flatrook township, where he departed this
life. He was married to Elizabeth Lowcry in his
native country in '810; they lived together In the
bonds of n atiimuDy until 1877, when his compan
ion departed this life. Since that time until the day
he died his grand daughter kept house for him.
To theee parents were born 8 children 4 sons and 4
daughters, one child was buried in his native coun
try, while five are sleeping tu the Florida cemetery
beside father and mother. He waa more or les af
flicted with disease for a number of years, but was
only coutined to his bed for about 12 weeks when he
passed away. H was confirmed and became a
member of the (ierman Reformed Church at the age
of 14 years, and lived a worthy member until he de
parted this life. During his illners he epoke of
death as a welcome visitor and longed to go to that
home where they know no sorrow. He loved to
read God's Word, aud lifted hie heart to God in
prayer as long as he had strength to do so, and
when his departure waa near at hand be tried to ar
range matters for tbe future, took his little grand
daughter by the hand aud raid, he a good girl and
bid the friends good bye, I can't stay any longer
with you.
Thus one a'ter another these lights have gone ohi
of this fan ily but may all ne rebuilt again in Heav
en. M ay all who were present on ihis occasion re
member the funeral text delivered on the oocaalon
by the Rev. rtheplcy, pastor in charge, from the
words of the 1st chapter ol Fblllpians and the 2 lrd
verse : ''For I am in a ttrait betwixt two hivlng a
desire to depart and be with Ohriatls far better."
The fun ral took place from the German Reformed
Church, at Florida, Ohio, where a large congrega
tion gathered and followed the remains to the ceme
tery at Florida, and there laid beside his companion
and children to await the resurrection morn. Hay
the Ureat Comforter sustain the two that are left
and ultimately bring them all to meet again be
yond the river.
Our father and mother are gone and we are left,
The loss of them to mourn,
But may we hope to meet with them
With Christ before tne throne. J. W.

"I have seen in several of the New England

Burr, who has written a life of Gen. Sheridan, was
an iutimite friend of my husband; that Oen. Sheri
dan aided him in tbe preparation of bis book
and in revising it. Tho statements thus made are
nntrue. Gen. Sheridan was never an intimate
friend of Mr. Burr, and he not only never aided him
in the preparation or revision of any book, but he
ordered Mr. Burr from his office when that gentle

certainly have no objection to any one writing of
