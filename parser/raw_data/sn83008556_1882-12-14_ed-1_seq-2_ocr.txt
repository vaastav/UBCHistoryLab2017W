A President's message is about the
greatest bore on a poor, harnused coun
try euitcr there is. It is worse than the
elephant which a New Jersey fellow
won at a shooting match. One does
not know at all how to handle or what
t> do with it. To publish it entire is
it lei ly out of the question—squarely
i:a ;o3 l >h. M the fiiv wuo care
to read it entire have done so from the
dailies loug before their weekly paper
can publish it. Cut off the head and
v >u have a shapeless mass of words cal
culated more to provoke than to please
our rulers ; lop off the tail and you
ti tlee matters worse instead of im
i.roving them, and if you dissect the
dy yon destroy all symmetry and pro
ortion. It were indeed a real pity to
reat Arthur's message so rudely, for
be poor fellow had agony more than e
r.ougli to frame and fit it together, and
-.■ van when complete it seems to disap
point all aud 3uit none.
No ; we will not annoy our reader*
v.'.th trie President's message or any
> irt of it. Our space is fully takea up
with other, and- as we feel satisfied
more acs ptable matter.

Senator Butler Re-elected.
COLUMBIA, S. C. December stb.
General M. C. Butler was to-day re-e
- the General Assembly United
Nates Senator. Colonel 11. S. Thom
m was inaugurated Governor. He
ieliyered an address touchng on na
tional as well as home affairs.
The greenback vote in Indiana hav
■ r_4 increased 113 in two years, it is es
v • too that at the same ratio of in
.-35130, that party will take control of
Tie Nate iu 1057,
. lie Democratic State Couraaitee will
M -it Ilarrisburg on the third Mon
i iu January, for organization under
new rules adopted t>y the last Dera
• ',it!e State Couvaation.
The suggestion that Mr. Curtin be urged for
the speaker-ship of the House meets with more
favor as It grows older. The Lewistown Free
Press is the last of the many journals of the dis
tnct who approve of It.— Clinton Democrat.
Wo consider it rather unseasona
ble at this time if not circctlv un
wise, to urge our distinguished mem
her for the position of Speaker. If
done merely to "compliment' our
grand old Ex-Governor it may be
all right, but certainly docs nogrwl.
We very much doubt whether Gov.
Curtin has any desires in that di
rection himself. With all his great
abilities he does not claim to be a
trained parlimcntcrinn, a la Randall,
that anybody knows of, and perhaps
lacks the physical strength so ncc
essarv for a Speaker to possess.
Gov. Curtin's natural and proper
sphere will be as leader of the house
—.and don't any of you forget
it. There his high order of states
menship, coupled with his
brilliant and masterly powers of or
atory will be of more service to the
country than in the Speaker's chair
and there he can hit Speaker Ky
phtr oftencr and hardei than he
could as presiding officer of the
House.
THE figures given by the
the United Slates in his report forj„the
yeur 1882 are strong arguments in favor
tif the reduction of taxation. The to
tal increase in net revenue of the gov
ernment for the present year over ISSI
jis $42,742,957.71. This shows an in
crease from customs of $22,251,004,2s ;
from internal revenue, SI 1,233.209,81 ;
from sales ot public lands, $2,5s 1,277,-
20, and from miscellaneous sources $6,-
707,415. The ret expenditures decrease
from $200,712,887 to $257,181,440, a re
ductiou of $2,741,447. Apparently the
whole internal revenue system mav be
wiped out and still leave the govern
ment plenty of money to defray all ne
cessary expenses. If civil service je
form is to be practically established,
there can be no reason why four thous
and oflice ho Iders should be retained at
a cost of five millions o! dollars per
year for the purpose of collecting need
less revenues, nor can the people be
longer expected to bear the burdens of
unnecessary taxation.— Patriot.
We agree entirely with the Patriot in
all but one point. Let the entire
internal revenue system be "wiped
out' 1 from our statute books one
swoop, excepting only the tax on whis
key and tobac co. Whiskey drinkers,
smokers and cbewers ought to pay the
bigger part of the balance of our na
tional debt without grumbling.
TNE TENURE OF THE OFFICERS.—
The Governor and Lieutenant Gover
nor elected in Pennsylvania on the 7th
of November will hold office for four
years ; the Secretary of Internal Affairs
for three yeats, and tbe Judge of
tbe Supreme Court for twenty-one
yeara. Twenty-eight Congressmen
were chosen to serve two years ; twen
ty-five State Senators to seir four
years, and tbe entire membership of
the lower House for two years.
IIE WILL BE LONELY.—The Green
backers will have a single Rcpresenta
tive in the Forty-eight Congress, in
the person of Hon. Charles X. Brumm,
of the thirteenth district of Pennsylva
nia. in t!>e present Congress there are
nine Greenbnckert. There is one thing
that won't woriy Brumm—attending
party caucuses.
California pilititia ns express the o
pinion tlmt t he Chinese restrictive law
can be easily amended bv congress so
that its c oustitutionality should be in
; disputable. They therefore oppose the
suggestion of the national labor con
gress that the law should l>e tested in
the courts. Imperfect as the law is it
has had the effect of almost stopping
Chinese emigration to this country.
Moreover huudreds of Chinamen have
departed for their own land, and hive
not returned to this country.
GCOVER CLEVELAND, Governor-e
--lect of New York, in addition to his
Democratic majority against boss rule
seems to have several characteristics in
common with Governor-elect Pattison.
He has declined the proffered services
of a military company on inauguration
day and expresses an earnest wish that
there shall be as little ceremony on that
occasion as possible. This seems to be
a year in which Democratic Governors
are thoroughly democratic.
Not That Kind of Legislature.
It must be understood that the legis
lature Isn't going to give a roll of Brus
sels carpet, an oil painting, a case of
penknives and enough shaving mugs to
start a barber shop to every member.
It must stop at the shaving mugs, any
how.
• •
A Washington special says : There
is very general unanimity among the
republicans in the house in charging
the defeat of the party to Robeson's
profligate leadership and his river and
harbor plunder. The defeated republi
can members are very bitter against
Robeson,and he will receive many hard
blows from his own household if he at
tempts to lead this session.
Gov. Pattison will be inaugurated,
Tuesday, J in. 16th. The legislature
meets Tuesday, Jan. 2nd, just two
weeks before the inauguration.

cE r THE BE ST
The people generally get that which they make a market for. They demanded better news
papers. \nfl within the last few years journalism has made rapid strides. THE TINF.P,
which, from the day of Its first Issue, took place In the front rank of progressive journalism, has
kept along at the double-quick step, and at this time is a better newspaper than ever. It is a
journal that never sleeps and never takes a holiday. A* there are 365 days, so there are 365 is
sues of IHE 1 IKES in a year. The week-day edition of THE TIMEM Is of four paces, be.
lug in a form suitable for the busy man or the busy woman. The Sunday edition, of eight pages
contains a great deal of the best miscellany as well as all the news. The editorial strength of
THE TIN EN need-not be dwelt upon—the fact that It Is quoted more than any other paper In
Americans sufllrlont evidence of its excellence in that direction. Nor need the typographical
superiority be iuoi than mentioned—for it is widely known as "the handsomest paper in the
con ntry."
a PHILADELPHIA WEEKLY TIMES

every part of the world. The leading feature of THE WEEKLY is the "ANNALS OF THE
WAR." This department en braces chapters of unwritten history, contributed by prominent ac
tors in the War of the Rebellion, and it has booome a recognized depository of such matters
whether from Northern or Southern sources. The ANNALS will be kept fully up to the high
standard of former years.
