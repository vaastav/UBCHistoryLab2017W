"presidents message
To the Senate and
House of Representatives:
In coming before you for the first time as the
Chief Magistrate of a great nation, it is with
gratitude to the Giver of all good for the many
benefits that we enjoy. We are blessed with
peace, without entangling alliances abroad to
forebode trouble, with territory unsurpassed iv
fertility, of an area equal to an abundant sup
port ol 500,000,000 of people, abounding in
every variety ol useful mineral in quantities
sufficient to supply the world for generations.
Exuberant crops in variety, climate adapted to
the production of every speeias of the earth's
riches, suited to thfe<habits, tastes, and require
ments of every living thing, with a population
of 40 000,000 of free people, speaking one lan
guage, with facilities for every mortal to acquire
education ; institutions closing to none the av
enues to fame, or any blessing of fortune that
may be povetod j with freedoqi of pulpit, press
and school. A revenue flowing into the Na
tional Treasury beyond the requirements ofthe
Government. Happily, harmony is being re
stoied within our own borders. Manufactures
hitherto unknown iv our country are springing
up in all sections, producing a degree of nation
al independence unequalled by any other power.
These blessings and countless others are en
trusted to yourcire and mine for safekeeping
for tbe brief period of our tenure of office. In
a short time we must each of us return to the
ranks of the people who hj)ve conferred our
honors, and account to them for our
ship. I earnestly desire that neither you nor I
may be condemned by a free and enlightened
constituency, nor by our own consciences.
Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic mag
nitude, aided $s it was by the sympathies and
assistance of nations with which we were at
peace, eleven States of the Union were four
years ago left without legal State governments.
A national debt had been contracted; com
merce was almost driven from the seas ; the in
dustry of one-half of the country had been ta
ken from the capitalists and placed where all
labor rightfully belongs—in the keeping of the
laborer. The work of restoring istatc govern
ments loyal to the Union, protecting and fos
tering free labor, providing the means for pay
ing the interest on the public debt, have re
ceived ample at ten: ion from Congress. Al
though your efforts have not met with success
in all ths particulars that might have been de
sired, yet on the whole they have bppn more
successful than could reasonably have been an
ticipated.
GEORGIA TO BE RECONSTRUCTED.
Seven ofthe States which passed ordinances
of secession have been fully restored to their
places in the Union. The eighth—Georgia
held an election at which she ratified her Con
stitution, republican in form, elected a Govern
or, members of Congress, State Legislature, and
the other officers required. The Governor was
installed ; the Legislature met and performed
all the acts then required of them by the recon
struction acts of Congress. Subsequently, how
ever, in violation ofthe Con-titution which they
had just ratified, as since decided by the Su
preme Court of that State, they unseated the
colored members of the Legislature and admitt
ed to their seats some members who are dis
qualified by the third clause of the fourteenth
amendment, an article which they themselves
had contributed to ratify. Under these cir
cumstances, I would submit to you whether it
would not bo wise without delay to enact a law
authorizing the Governor of Georgia to convene
the members orignally elected to the Legisla
ture, requiring each to take the oath prescribed
ny the reconstruction acts, and none to be ad
mitted who are ineligible under the third clause
ofthe fourteenth amendment.
THE FREEDMEN.
The freedmen, under the protection which
they have received, are making rapid progress
in learning, and no complaints are heard of
lack ot industry on their part when they receive
fair remuneration for their labor.
THE GOVERNMENT INCOME.
The means provided for paying the interest
on the public debt, with all other expenses of
Government, are more than ample
TOE LOSS OF OUR COMMERCE.
The los 3of our commerce is the only result
of the late rebellion which has not received
sufficient attention from you. To this subject
I call your earnest attention. I will not now
suggest plans by which this object may be ef
fected, but. will, if necessary, make it tho sub
ject of a special message during the session.
THE ELECTIONS UNDER RECONSTRUCTION IN THE
SOUTH.
Congress, by joint resolution, authorized the
Executive to order elections in the States of
Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, to submit lo
them the Constitutions which each had pre
viously framed and to submit the Constitutions
either entire nr in separate parts to be voted
upon at the discretion of the Executive. Under
this authority elections were called. In Vir
ginia the election took place on the 6th of July.
The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor elected
have been installed. The Legislature met and
did all required by this resolution and by all the
reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained
from all doubtful authority. I recommend that
her senators and representatives be promptly
admitted to their seats, and that the State be
fully restored to its place in the family of States.
Elections were called in Mississippi and
Texas, to commence November 30th—two days
in Mississippi and four in Texas. The elec
tions have taken place, but the result is not
known. It is hoped that the acts of the Leg
islature oi these States, when they meet, wilt
|be such as to receive your approval, and thus
close the work of reconstruction.
THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENT.
Among the evil- growing out ofthe rebellh n
and not yet referred to, is that of an irredeem
able currency. It is an evil which I hope will
receive your most earnest attention. It v a
duty, and one of the highest duties oi" Govern
ment, to secure to the citizen a' medium of fixed
and unvarying value. This implies a return to
a specie basis, and no substitute for it can be
devised. It should be commenced now, and
reached at the earliest practicable moment con
sistent with a fair regard to the interest of the
debtor class. Immediate resumption, if prac
ticable, would not be desirable. It would com
pel the debtor class to pay beyond their con
tracts the premium on gold at the date of their
purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ru
in to thousands Fluctuations, however, in >he
paper value ofthe measure of all values—gold,
is detrimen'al to the interests of trade. It
makes the man of businessan involuntary gam
bler, for in all cases where future payment is to
be made, both the parties speculate as to what
wiil be the value of the currency paid and re
ceived I earnestly recommend to you, then,
such legislation as will insure a gradual return
to specie payments, and put an immediate stop
to the fluctuations in tbe value of currency.—
The methods to secure the former of these re
sults arc as numerous as speculators ou political
economy. To secure the latter, I see but one
way ; and that is to authorize the Tieasury to
redeem its own paper at a fixed value whenev
er presented, and withhold from circulation all
currency so redeemed until sold again for gold.
The vast resources of the nation, both devel
oped and undeveloped, ought to make our cred
it the be.-t on earth. With less burden of tas
a ion than the citizen has endured for the six
years pas - , the entire public debt could be paid
in ten years, but it v not desirable that the
people should be taxed to pay it in that time.
Year by year the ability to pay increases in rap
id ratio, but the burden of interest ought to be
reduced as rapidly as can be without a violation
STAUNTON, VA., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1869.
ot contract. The public debt is represented in
: great part by bonds having trom one to forty-
I five years to run, bearing interest at the rate of
five and six per cent, respectively. It is op
tional with the Government to pay these bonds
at any period of the least time mentioned upon
their face. The time has already expired when
a great part may be taken in, and rapidly ap
proaching when it may weli be believed that all
which are now due may be replaced by bonds
bearing a rate of interest not exceeding foui
and a half per cent., and as rapidly as the re
mainder become due they may be replaced in
the same way. To accomplish this it may be
necessary to authorize tbe interest to be paid
at either of the three or four money-centres of
Jjurope, or by any of the assistant treasurers
of the United States, at the option ofthe hold
er of the bond. I suggest this subject for the
consideration of Congress, and also simulta-
I neously with this the propriety of redeeming
• our currency, as before suggested, at its market
value at the time the law goes into effect, in
creasing the rate at wlpeh currency will be
bought and sold, from day to day or week to i
week, at the same rate of interest as tbe Gov
ernment pays upon its bond*.
The subject of tariff ai*d internal taxation
will necessarily receive your atteniion. The
revenues of tha country are greater than the
requirements, and may, with safety, be re
duced ; but i»s the funding b# the debt in a four
or four and a half per cent, loan would reduce
the annual current expenses largely, thus, after
funding justifying a greater reduction ot taxa
tion than would now be expedient, I suggest a
postponement of this question until the next
meeting of Congress.
TARIFF.
It may be ajivisabje tp modify taction and
tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome
discriminations are made by the present laws;
but of a general revision of the laws regulating
this subject I reoommend tbe postponement for
the present.
THE INCOME TAX,
I also suggest a removal ofthe tax ou incomes,
but at a reduced rate, and this tax to expire in
threo years.
■■ • 1
CUSTOMS.
With the funding of the uational debt, as j
here suggested, I ieel safe io saying that the
taxes and revenue from imports may be reduc
ed from sixty to eighty millions per annum at
once, and may be still further reduced from
year to year as the resource of the country are
developed-
FISCAL STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
shows the receipts of the Givernment for the
fiscal year ending June 30;b, §370,943,747, and
expenditures, including bounties, &c, $321,-
-490,597 The estimates for the ensuing year
life more favorable to the Government, and will |
no doubt show a much larger decrease cf the
public debt. The receipts in the Treasury be
yond the expenditures have exceeded the
amount neces.-ary to be placed to the credit of
the sinking fund, as provided bylaw. To lock
up the surplus in the Trea.-ury aud withhold it j
from cireulati vi wouid lead to such a contrac- |
tion of currency as to cripple trade aud serious- j
ly affect the prosperity ot the country. Under [
these circumstances, the Secretary off the Trea
sury and my.-elf heartily concurred in the pro
priety of using all the surplus currency in the
Treasury in the purchase <fGovernment bonds,
thus reducing the interest-bearing indebtedness
ofthe the country, and of -v unitting to Con
gross the question ofthe disposition tobe made
of the bonds so purchased The bonds now
held by the Treasury amount to $75,000,000,
including those of the sinking fund I recom
mend that the whole be p!ac?d to the credit of
the sinking fund.
Your attention is respectfully invited to the
recommendations of the Secretary of
ury for the creation of the office of Commisr
sioner of Customs and Revenue, for the increase
of the salary of certain classes of officials, and
the substitution of increased national bank cir
culation to replace outstanding three per cent,
certificates, and most especially to his recom
mendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares
of fines, penalties, forfeitures, etc., to tbe of
ficers of Government or to informers.
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
The office of Commissiotier of Internal Rev
enue is one of the most aiduous and responsi
ble under the Government, and falls but little
short of a Cabinet position in its importance
and responsibilities. I would ask for it, there
fore, such legislation as in your judgment will
place the office upon a footing of dignity com
mensurate with its impor !aiice and with the
character and qualification-- "f the class of men
required to fill it properly.
CUBA
As the United States is the freest of all na
tions, so do its people sympathize with all peo
ple struggling for liberty and self-government.
But while so sympathising it is due to our hon
or that we should abstain from enforcing our
views upon unwilling nations, and from taking
an interested part in quarrels between different
nations, or between govern incuts and their sub
jects. Our course shouhj always be in con
formity with strict justice and law—interna
tional and local. Such has been tho policy of
this Administration in dealing with these ques
tions for more than a year. A valuable prov
ince of Spain, and a near neighbor of ours, in
whom all our people cannot but feel a deep in
terest, has been struggling for independence
and freedom. The people and government of
the United States entertain the same warm
feelings and sympathies for the people of Cu
ba in their pending struggle that they manifes
ted throughout the previous struggles between
Spain and her former colonies ia behalt of the
latter. The contest has at no time assumed
conditions which amount to war in the sense of
international law, or which would show the ex
istence ot a de facto political organisation of
the insurgents sufficient to ju-tify a recognition
ot belligerency. The principle is maintained,
however, that this nation is its own judge of
when to accord the rights of belligerency either
to a people struggling to {'w* themselves from
a government they believe to be oppressive or
t<> independent nations at war with each other.
The United States has no disposition to inter
fere with the existing rela ions of Spain to her
colonial possessions on this continent. They
bel.eve that in due time Spam and other Eu
ropean powers will find their interest in termi
nating those relations and establishing their
present dependencies as independent powers.—
These dependencies are no longer regarded as
subjects of transfer trom one European power
to another. When the present relations of col
onies ceases they are to become independent
powers, exeroi.-ing the right of choice and of
self-control in the determination of their future
condition and relation with other powers.
The United States, in order to put a stop to
the bloodshed in Cuba, and in the interest of
the neighboring people, proposed its good offi
ces to bring ttie existing contest to a termina
tion. Tne offer, not being accepted by Spain
on the basis which we believed could be re
ceived by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped
that the good offices of the United States may
prove advantageous for the settlement ot this
unhappy strife. In the mean while, a number
of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been
broken up. It has been the endeavor of the
Administration to execute the neutrality laws,
no matter how unplea-ant the task, made so by
the suffeiing wo endured from the lack of like
good faith iowards us by other nations.
SPANISH SEIZURE OP AN AMERICAN VESSEL.
On the 26th of March last the United States
schooner Lizzie Ms.'jor was arrested on the high
seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers
taken and carried prisoner.-, to Cuba. Repre
sentations of these facts were made to the
Spanish Government as torn as official iafur
mation reached Washington The two passen
gers were set at liberty, and the Spanish Gov
ernment assured the United States that ihe
captain of the frigate making the capture had
acted without law, that he had been repriman-
§Kltlflß
ded, and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba
would not sanction any act that could violate
the lights or treat with disrespect the sove
reignty of this nation.
The question ofthe seizure ofthe brig Mary
Lowell, at Bahama, by the Spanish authorities
is now the subject of correspondence between
this Government and Spain and Great Britain.
The Captain General of Cuba about May last
issued a proclamation authorizing the searching
of vessels on the high eeas. Immediate re
monstrance was made against this, whereupon
the Captain-General issued a new proclamation
limiting the search to vessels of tbe United
States authorized under the treaty of 1795.—
This proclamation, however, was immediately
withdrawn. I have always felt that the most
intimate relations should be cultivated between
the United States and independent nations on
this continent. It may be well worth consider
ing whether new treaties between us and them
may not be profitably entered into to secure
more intimate relations—friendly, commercial,
md otherwise.
CENTRAL AMERICA—THE DARIEN CANAL.
The inter-oceanic canal, to connect the At
lantic and Pacific oceans through the Isthmus
of Darien, is one in which commerce is greatly
interested. Instructions have been given the
Minister to the United States pf Colombia to
endeavor to obtain authority for a survey to de
termine the practicability 0 f the undertaking.
In order to ocnipjy with the agreement with
the United States of Colombia as to a mixed
commission at Lima, it became necessary to
send a commissioner and secretary to Lima.
The good offices of the United States to bring |
about peace between Spain and the South A
merican republics having been accepted by
Spain, peru, and Chili, a congress has been in
vited to be held in Washington during the
present winter.
A grant has been given to Europeans of an
exclusive riyht of transit over the territory of
Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has given its
assent; which, it is alleged, conflicts with the
vested rights of citizens of the United States.
The Department of State now has the subject I
under consideration.
Utt Sf AN ISH GUNBOATS.
The Minister to Peru having made represent
ations that there was a state of war between
Peru and Spain, and that Spain was construct
ing in and near New York thirty gunboats,
which might be us ?d by Spain to relieve the
naval force at Cuba to operate against Peru, or T
ders were giyeu to prevent their departure. No
further steps having been taken by the repre
sentatives of the Peruvian Government to pre
vent the departure of these vessels, and I not
feeling authorized to detain the property of a
nati'in with which we are at peace on a mere
Executive order, tbe matter has been referred I
'o the courts.
SOUTH AMERICA.
The conduct of the war between the allies
and the Republic of Paraguay has made inter
course with that country difficult, and it has
been deemed advisable to withdraw our repre
sentative from there.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
Towards the qf the last administration
a convention was sisrned at London for the set- |
t lenient of outstanding claims between Great j
Britain and United States, which failed to re
eeive the consent of the Senate The time and
the circumstances attending the negotiation of
that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance I
by the people ofthe United States, and its pro- j
visions were wholly inadequate to the settlement
ol the grave wrongs sustained by this Govern
ment.
The injuries resulting to the United Stales ]
by reason of the course adopted by Great Brit
ain during the war in the increase of the rates j
of insurance, in the diminution of exports and |
imports and other ob-tructions to domestic in- I
dustry and production, in its effect upon the
foreign commerce of the country, in the de
crease and transfer to Great Britain of our com- j
mercial marine, in the prolongation of the war,
and in the increased cost both in treasure and
in lives of itsjmppression, could not be adjus
ted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims
which continually arise between commercial na
tions ; and yet the convention treated them
simply as such ordinary claims, from which
they differ more widely in the gravity ol their
character than in the magnitude of their a
mount. Great even as is that difference, not a
word was found ia the treaty, and not an infer
ence could be drawn from it. to iemove the
sense of the unfriendliness of the oourse of
Great Britain in our struggle for existence
which had so deeply and universally impressed
itself upon the people of this country. Be
lieving that a convention thus misconceived in
its scope and inadequate in its provisions would
not have produced the hearty, cordial settle
ment of the pending questions which alone is
consistent with the relations which I desire to
have firmly established between the United
States and Great Britain, I regarded the action
of the Senate in the rejection ol the treaty to
have been wisely taken in the interest ot peace
and as a step in the direction of a
perfect and cordial friend.ship between the two
countries,
A sensitive people, conscious of their power,
are more wholly at ease under a great wrong
wholly uuatoned, than under the restraint of a
settlement which satisfies' neither their ideas of
justice nor their grave sense of tho grievance
they have sustained. The rejection of the
treaty was followed by a state of public feeling
on both sides which 1 thought not favorable to
an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations.
I accordingly so instructed the Minister of the
United States to Great Britain, and found that
my views in this regard were shared by her
Majesty's Mmisters. I hope that the time may
soon arrive when the two Governments can ap
proach the solution of this momentous question
with an appreciation of what is due to the
rights, dignity, and honor of each, and with
the determination not only to remove the causes
of complaint in tho past, but to lay the foun
dation of a broad principle of public law which
will prevent future differences, and tend to firm
and continued friendship. This is now the on
ly grave question which the United States has
with any foreign nation.
RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA.
The question of renewing the treaty for re
ciprocal trade between the United States and
the British provinces on this continent is not
favorably considered. In conformity with the
recommendation of Congiess a proposition to
aboiish mixed courts for the suppression of the
slave trad*} is under negotiation.
x THE FRENCH CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge that a cor
porate company, organized uuder British laws,
proposed to land upon the shores ofthe United
States, and to operate there a sub-marine cable,
under a concession of the Emperor of the
French of an exclusive right tor twenty years,
lor telegraphic communication between the
shores ot Fiance and the United States, with
the very ojcctioiiablc feature of subjecting all
messages conveyed thereby to the scrutiny and
control ofthe French Government, I caused the
French and British legatious at Washington to
be made acquainted with the probable policy of
Congress on this subject as tore.-hadowed by a
bili which passed the Senate in March last.
This drew from the representatives ol the
company an agreement to accept as the ba*is of
their operations the provisions of the bill or
6uch other enactments on the subject as might
be passed during the approaching session of
Congress, also to use their influence to secure
from the French Government a modification of
their concessinn to permit the landing of any
, cable belonging to any company incorporated
\ by authority of the United States or any State
!in the. Union, and on their part not to oppose
the e.-tabli.-hment of any such cable. Iv con
i sideration of this agreement I directed the
withdrawal of all opposition by the United
States to the landing of the cable until the
meeing of Congress. I regtet to say there
has been no modification made in the company's
toacession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they
attempted to secure one.
Their concesMon excludes capital and citizens,
of the United States from competition on- the
shores of France. I recommend legislation to
protect the rights of citizens of the United
States and the sovereignty of the nation against
such an assumption ; r and I shall also endeavor
to secure by negotiation the abandonment of
the principle of monopolies in ocean cables.
NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
The unsettled political condition of other
countries le?s fortunate than our own sometimes
induces their citiz:ns to come to the United
States for the sole purpose of becoming natural
ized. Having secured this they return to their
native country and reside there without disclos
ing their change of allegiance. They accept of
ficial positions of trust or honor which can only
be held by citizens of their native lands. They
journey uuder passports describing them as
such eitisens ; and it is only when civil discord
(after perhaps years of quiet) threatens their
persons or their property, or when their native
State drafts them into military service, that
their change of allegiance is known.
They reside permanently away from the Uni
ted States, contribute nothing to its revenues
and avoid the duties of citizenship, and only
make themselves known by a claim for protec
tion. I have directed the diploma! ic and con
sular officers to scrutinize carefully all such
claims to protection. A citizen of the United
States, whether native or adopted, who din
charges his duty to his country, is entitled to its
complete protection. While I have a voice in
the direction of affairs, J shali not oonsont to
imperil this sacred right by conferring it on
fictitious or fraudulent claimants.
REGULATIONS FOR IMMIGRANT SUIPS.
Invitations have been extended to the cabi
nets of London, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, The
Hague. Copenhagen, and Stockholm, to em
power their representatives at Washington to
simultaneously enter into negotiations and to
conclude with the United States conventions
identical in form, making uniform regulations
as to the construction of parts of vessels devo
ted to the use of emigrant passengers, as to the
quality and quantity of food, as to the medical
treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be I
observed during the voyage in order to secure
ventilation, to promote health, to prevent in
trusion, and to protect females, and providing
for the establishment of tribunals in the sever
al countries for enforcing suoh regulations by
summary prooeii.
TARIFF ON RUSSIAN HEMP.
Your attention i-* respectfully called to the
law regulating the tariff on ltus.-ian hemp, and
to the question whether to fix the charges on
Russian hemp higher than they are fixed on j
manilla is not a violation of our tvouty with I
Russia placing hef products on the same foot
ing with those of the most favored nations.
OUR MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCING INTER
ESTS.
Our manufactures are increasing with won- j
dcrful rapidity under the encouragement which
they now receive. With the improvements in
machinery already effected and still increasing,
causing machinery to take the place of skilled j
labor to a large extent, our imports of many
articles must fall oft largely. Fortunately, too, j
manufactures are not confined to a few locali
ties, as formerly, and it is to be hoped will be- I
come more and more diffused, making the in
terest in them equal in all sections. They give
employment and support to hundreds of thou
sands ot people, and retain with us the means
which otherwise would be shipped abroad.
The extension of the railroads in Europe and
tho East is bringing into competition with our
agricultural products like products of other
countries. Self-interest, iff not self-preserva
tion, therefore, dictates caution against disturb
ing any industrial interest of the country. It
teaches us also the necessity of looking to oth
er markets for the sale of our surplus. Our
neighbors south of us, and China and Japan,
should receive our special attention. It wiii be
the endeavor of the Administration to culti
vate such relations with ali these nations as to
Bus to their confidence, and make it their
t as well as ours to establish better com-
I relations,
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
Through the agency of a more enlightened j
policy than that heretofore pursued towards j
China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts !
of our own distinguished citizens, the world ia }
about to commence largely increased relations
with that populous and hitherto exclusive na- j
tion. As the United States have been the ini
tiators in this new policy, so they should be th«
most earnest in showing their good faith in
making it a success. In this connection I advise j
such legislation as to forever preclude the eu- j
slavement of Chinese on our soil under the I
name of coolies, and also to prevent American !
vessels from engaging in the transportation of |
coolies to any country tolerating the system.
I also recommend that the mission to China i
be raised to one of the first class.
CHANGE IN OFFICE-HOLDERS.
On my assuming the responsible duties of i
Chief Magistrate of the United States, it was!
with the conviction that three things were es- i
sential to its peace, prosperity, and fullest de- j
velopment. First among these is strict integrity
ia fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure j
protection to the person and property of the i
citizen of the United States in each and every '
portion of our common country wherever he j
may choose to move without reference to his
original nationality, religion, color, or politics,
demanding ot him only obedience to the laws,
and proper respect for the rights of others; and
third, tbe union of all the States, with equal
rights, indestructible by any constitutional ;
means.
To secure the first of these Congress has ta
ken two essential steps : first, in declaring by
joint resolution that the public debt should be
paid, principal and interest, in coin ; and sec
ondly 7, providing tlie means for paying. Pro
viding the means, however, could not secure
the object desired without a proper administra
tion of the laws for the collection of the rere
nues and an economical disbursement of them.
To this subject the Administration has ad
dressed Lself with results, I hope, satisfactory
to the country. There has been no hesitation
in changing officials in order to secure an effi
cient execution of the laws—sometimes, too,
where, io a mere party viow, undesirable polit
ical results were likely to follow—nor any hesi
tation in sustaining efficient officials against re
monstrances wholly political. It may be well
to mention here the embarrassment possible to
arise from leaving on the statute-books the so
cailed tenure-of-office acts, and to earnestly
recommend their total repeal. It could not
have been the intention ot the framers of the
Constitution, in providing that appointments
made by the President should receive the con
sent of the Senate, that the latter should have
the power to retain in office persons placed
there by Federal appointments against the wiil
of the President. The law inconsistent with
a faithful and efficient administration of the
Government. What faith can an Executive
put in officials forced upon him, and those, too,
whom he has suspended for reason? How wiil
such officials be likely to serve an Administra
tion which they kuow does not trust them?
For the second requisite to our growth and
prosperity, time and a firm but humane admin
istration of existing laws, amended from time
to time as they may be ineffective, or prove
harsh or unneces-ary, are probably all that are
required.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The third cannot be obtained by special leg
islation. It must be regarded as fixed by the
Constitution itself, and gradually acquiesced in
by force of public opinion. From the iounda
tion ol the Government to the present, the
management of the original inhabitants of this
continent (the Indians) has been a fcubject of
embanassment and expense, and Las been at
tended with con:inuuua robberies, murders and
wars. From my own experience ou the fron
tiers and in Indian countries, I do not hold ei
ther legislation or the conduct of the whites,
Number IV.
who come most in contact with the Indians,
The past, however, cannot be undone, and
the question must be met as we now find it. I
have attempted a new policy towards these
wards of tho nation, (they cannot be regarded
in any otber light than as wards,) with lair re
sults so far as tried, and which, I hope, will bo
attended ultimately with great success. The
Society of Friends is well known as having suc
ceeded in living in peace with the Indians in
the early settlement of Pennsylvania, while
their white neighbors of other sects, in other
sections, were constantly embroiled. They are
also known for their opposition to all strife, vi
lind war, and are generally noted for their
itegrity and fair dealings. These con
ons induced me to give the management
r reservations of Indiansto, and to throw
den of the selection of agents upon, the
•esult has proven most satisfactory. It
found qaore fully set forth in the report
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. For
tendents and Indian agents not on res
is, officers of the army were selected.—
sons for this are numerous. Where In
ents are sent, thereo r near there, troops
so be sent. The agent and the com
of troops are independent of each oth
are subject to orders from different de
partments of the Government. The army offi
cer holds a position for lite, the agent one at
the will of the President. The former is per
sonally interested in living in harmony with the
ludiaus and establishing a permanent peace to
the end that some portion of Ids life may be
lin civilized society. The latter has no
ersonal interest. Another reason nan
deal one; and still another, the hold
the Government has upon a lite officer
ire a faithful discharge of the duties in
ig out a given poh.-y. The building of
ds and the access thereby given to all the
agricultural and mineral region* of the country
is rapidly bringing citilized settlements into
contact with all the tribes of Indians. No
matter what ought to be the relations between
such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is
that they do not harmonize well, and one or
Bjther has to give way in the end. A sys
which looks to the extinction of a race is
lorrible for a nation to adopt without en
ig upon itself the wrath of all Chiisten
, and engendering in the citizen a disregard
tor human life and the rights of others danger
ous to society. I see no substitute for such a
system except iv placing ali tho Indians on
large reservations as rapidly as it can he done,
and giving them absolute protection there. As
soon as they are fitted lor it they should be in
duced to take their lands in severalty and to-c:
up territorial governments for their own pro
tection. For full details on this subject I call
your special attention to the reports of the Sec-
Bof8 of the Interior aud the Commissioner of

THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy ac
companying this shows the condition ofthe na
vy. When this administration came into office,
and by changes made since, s>treuuous efforts
have been made to place as many vessels in
commission, or render them fit for service when
required, as po.-sible, and to sub-titute the sail
for steam white cruising, thus materially redu
cing the expense ofthe navy and adding greatly
to its efficiency. Lookiug to our future, I rec
ommend a liberal though not extravagant pel
icy towards this branch of the public service.
POST-OFFICE DEPARTMSNT.
The report of tho Postmaster-Genera! fur
nishes a clear aad comprehensive exhibit of the
operations ofthe postal aerrice andoi the finan
cial condition ofthe Post-office Deapaitment.—
The ordinary postal revenuo. tor the year end
ing June 30, 1869, amounted to $16,444,010,
and the expenditures to $23,698,131. Vuur at
tention is respectfully called to the recommend
ation made by the Postmaster-General for au
thority to change the rate of compensation to
the main trunk-railway lines for their services
in carrying the mails, for having post-route
maps executed, for reorganizing and increasing
the efficiency of the special agency service,
for the increase ofthe mail service of the Pa
cific, and for establishing mail service under the
flag of ihe Uniou in the Atlantic; and most
especially do I call your attention to his recom
mendation for the total abolition of the flank
ing privilege. This is an abuse from which no
one receives a commensurate advantage. It
reduces the receipt for postal service from
twenty-five to thirty per cent, and largely in
creases the se vice to be performed.
THE PATENT OFFICE-INTERIOR DEPARTMENT,
ETC.
During the year ending September 30, 1869,
the Patent Office issued 13,762 patents, and its
receipts were $686,359, being $213,926 more
than the expenditures.
I respectfully call your attention to the rec
ommendation of the Secretary of the Interior
tor uniting the duties ol supervising the edu
cation of freedmen with the other duties de
volving upon the Commissioner of Education.
If it is the of Congress to make the
census during the year IS7O more complete and
| perfect, I would suggest early action upon any
j plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress
iat the last session appointed a committee to
j take into consideration such measures as might
|be deemed proper ia reference to the census,
1 and to report a plan, I desist from saying more.
I recommend to your favorable consideration
| the claims of the Agricultural Bureau for lib
! eral appropriations. In a country so diversi
! tied in climate and soil as ours, and with a pop
! ulation so largely dependent upon agriculture,
I the benefits that can ba conferred by properly
i fostering this Bureau arc incalculable.
j I desire respectfully to call the attention of
| Congress to the inadequate salaries of a num
• ber of the most important officers of the Gov-
I ernment. In this message I wiil not enumerate
them, but wiil specify only the Justices of the
Supreme Court. No change has been made in
their salaries for fifteen years. Withiu that
time the labors of the court have largely in
creased, and the expenses of living have at least
doubled. During the same period Congres
has twice fouud it necessary to increase largely
the compensation of its own members, and the
duty it owes to another department of the Gov
ernment deserves, and wiil doubtless receive,
due consideration. •
CONCLUSION.
There are many subjects not alluded to in this
message which might with propriety be intro
duced, but I abstain, believing that your patri
otism and statesmanship will suggest the topics
and tho legislation most conducive to the inter
ests of the whole people. On my part t prora-
K rigid adherence to the laws and their strict
cement. U. S. GRANT.
