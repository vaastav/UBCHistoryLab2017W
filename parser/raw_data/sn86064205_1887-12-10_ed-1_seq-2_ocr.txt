Mayor Roche of Chicago is receiving
a great deal of applause from certain sec
tions because he refused to grant the an

in one of the parks unless they agreed not

Mayor means well doHbtless but his ar
bitrary action will have a bad effect He
has no power and no authority to pre
scribe what people shall drink or how
much nor can he say what colored flags
they must carry If carrying red flags is
contrary to law those guilty of carrying
them should be punished as tho law
directs The anarchy preached by the
Chicago reds is no worse than the despot
ism which says under what conditions
alone people may exercise their rights
The precautions taken by the Mayor of
Chicago show a craven fear of the an
archists unworthy a great city
THE LAW TO BE ENFOBGED
The unpleasant notoriety givenSan
Antonio through the persistent violations
of the Sanday law by the saloonkeepers
of that city is to be deplored as it adds
fuel to the fire of misrepresentation of the
state Justices of the peace and juries
who arrogate to themselves the power to
pass upon and annul the laws of the land
andthrowthemselvesbetweenmalefactors
and the prison do not stand out as exam
ples of Texan intelligence or virtue The
determination of AttorneyGeneral Hogg
to enforce the law at all hazards even
though it become necessary to call in the
state troops is to be commended and en
couraged not only because it is his plain
duty to see the law enforced but because
by defining the bounds of the lawdefjing
territory the remainder of the state will
be absolved from any participation in or
sympathy for the anarchial conduct
of the Alamo City The Attorney
General means what he says and

teat San Antonio is dominated by foreign
born citizens who have not yet learned to
relish Texas sentiments and while it is
true that every people should be per

a manner as will be most agreeable to
themselves it is equally true that citi
zens of Texas should either obey Texas
laws and respict her institutions or re
main beyond her lmits and that when
laws are openly and dtfiintly violated by
thOEe claiming to be citizens of the state
and for the reason that such laws ere not

BLAINES MESSAGE
President Clevelands message was
given to the counry and the country
read it and was satisfied Almost imme
diately thereafter wouldbe President
James G Blaine came to the front with a
message everything but official in which
he undertakes to demolish the arguments
advanced in the Presidents message
Mr Blaine though undoubtedly an able
disputant and as well equipped for po
litical discussion as any man in public
life does not meet argument altogether
with argument but cleverly inteijects a
volume of sentiment as he goes along
and always where it will do the most
good England he assures us looks
with great favor upon the free trade ten
dencies of President Cleveland and is
preparing for an enormous trade in
fabrics with this country under the benefi
cent influence of a lower tariff This is
to arouse the manufacturers of the coun
try and rally them to his standard
He favors the construction of fortifica
tions to indicate his loDg boasted strong
foreign policy and ingratiate himself
into the good graces of the Irish of New
York who are always ready to applaud
opposition to foreign nations which
means to England In this Mr Blaine
has shown a master hand While Mr
Cleveland has been unapproachable on
the subject Mr Bayard high in the
councils of the administration has been
by some charged with being the Ameri
can representative of English capitalists
and of offensive snobbery Mr Blaine
wants to accentuate not only his sympa
thy with Irish sentiment but his
American individualism which Is sure to
elicit the good will of the growing
American sentiment that we see mani
festing itself in the outcroppings of
modified Knownothingism under
rious names He favors the
peal of the t3x on tobacco and
will be a strong card with
in that very doubtful state Virginia
a remarkable coincide ce when
va
re
this
him
As
Mr
Blaines interview was coming from New
York advocating the repeal of the in
ternal revenue tax on tobacco the
Democratic Legislature of Virginia was
telegraphing the national representatives
of that state instructing them to work for
a similar subject Here is one Instance
where a Democratic state refused to be
guided by the policy outlined by a Demo
cratic President The tax on whisky Mr
Blaine desires to see remain and with
much plausibility he argues with the
Prohibitionists ia so able and apparently
sincere a manner as to convince the not
too skeptical that he was one of them
His views on the wool question are hand
in hand with the National Woolgrowers
Association now in session in Washing
ton that is viewing with alarm the
impending destruction of their interests
There is not s vulnerable point in Mr
Clevelands armor that the man fromMaine
has not assailed and some of them with
success The sea coast cities are all
given liberal quantities of taffy relative
to defenses the labor element in the
usual way and with the very proper and
truthful addition that tobacco is the
poor mans necessity and that labor
pays the tax imposed upon this product
which is only partially true Taken all
in all Mr Blaines interview is more
catchy and popular than Mr Clevelands
message For Temporary use it is a
better electioneering document It
is of course certain that for
every defection from the Demo
cratic ranks on account of revenue or
tariff there will be an acquisition
for the same reasons The question
however to be settled by the people is
plain and simple and Mr Cleveland has
taken the view of it that will find the
most advocates The surplus must be
enue tax on tobacco will also be reduced
as a compromise One thing Blames
pronunciamento has done however has
been to brush away from his path all op
position to a nomination by the Republi
can convention

TUB POOL AND TEXAS
The railroads of Texas should not un
derstand the present movement to do
something in behalf of the state to be the
outgrowth of hostiliy to the railroads of
the state but at the same timp the rail
roads should appreciate the earnestness
of the people in this matter aad symp
thiza with it to the extent of such friend
ly interest as will tend to a cooperation
based upon the full discharge of obliga
tions resting on both people and railroad
The people of Texas are painfully
aware of the fact that no immisration
worthy tue name has come into the sute
since 18S3 they are not oblivious of tne
hlghting irfluences of the drouth of
1885 and 1880 and of the great depres
sion in the cattle industry beginning in
ISSi they know that deep water
on the Texas coast and a land law
that will simplify the acquirement of
public lands are needed factors in the
states development The people know
that railroads cannot unaided do all
TexaB needs to have done for it but they
do know that the railroads of Texas haul
people across Texas to California at a lefs
rate of fare than the same railroads
will transport people into Tex s
and they know further that Texas
railroads will carry people out of Texas
at e less rate than they will bring people
into Texas and they also know that for
the past six months more people have
been carried out than have been brought
into the state
The people have an intelligent appre
hension of all the facts bearing on the
esse and now they are ripe for
action that shall be based on co
operation o5 railroads and people They
do not feel encouraged to expend any
more money in advertising the state to
those who are offered cheaper rates to
travel through Texas to other states than
to come to Texss they want the railroads
to aid in some movement that will build
up Texas and if the pool stands in the
way and sets itself up as an obstacle the
people want the pool busted
The people recall the first message of
Governor Ross to the Twentieth Legisla
ture in which he so folly discussed the
traffic arrangements of railroads by
which the reads divided the profits upon
some mutually agreed basis and put
practical end to the competition which the
people soueht and thought to provide
by liberal donations municipal and pri
vate The people are recalling also this
suggestion of Governor Ross to the Legis
lature
I respectfully suggest to your honorable
bodies the pronrleiy of enacting that hereaf er
pooling r combinations bctwe n railroads and
other con mon carr era shall be deem d unlaw
ful and If any offi c gent eeivant or em
ploye thereof shall en er into or execute any
agreement of that character or shall operate or
assist in opcating a r ilnad under such agree
ment or i ha 1 tnowlngly aid or assist in the
operation of arailroad under such arangem nt
he 6hal be deemed guilty of a felony and be
Imprisoned in the penitentiary for a proper
erm of years
If the railroads cannot or wili not aid
in the movement because of pool obliga
tions the roads must certainly see that
such refusal for such cause will tend to
crystalize public sentiment in favor of
such law recommended by Governor
Ross
The Gazette is not unaware of the
public advantages and benefits claimed
for the pool but if such benefits are to
be purchased at thp cost of all hope
of legitimate competition and of the
cooperation of railroads and peo
ple in an effort calcula
ted to promote the interests of both then
the plea of the people for cooperation
it may be expected will become a de
mand for some legal enactment that will
insure competition It is for the rail
roads to demonstrate whether a traffic
arrangement or pool is the iripnd or
enemy of Texas

The sugar trust it is reporced has gone
into actual operation The buying out

and it is reasonable to suppose that the

now with the probability that it will be
firmer a month or two hence It is per

later Congress will soon be in session

Austin Tex Dec 9 The Gazette
correspondent today called upon a
number of leading citizens and business
men of Austin in reference to matter cf
railroads giving Texas r fair show n
bringing immigration into the state the
boom for which was started by The Ga
zbtte sometime back Every Austinite
interviewed expressed himself warmly
In favor of the movement indicated by
The Gazette and the idea to get the
railways to treat Texas justly and make
some1 efforts to briog immigration tc
Texas as to California and other states
takes immensi ly From what The Ga
zette man learned today everybody it
now in favor of booming Texas like
California and prevailing on railroads to
helD us do it
Folio mas were among those Inter
viewed J W Peacock merchant paid
he agret d with The Gazette entirely in
this matter and he thuu ht we ought to
shoot the man who wasnt It was th1
interest of the railroads themselves to
settle up Texas lands Tne richer Texas
got the more business they would get
Covert McCartvreal estate meo said
concerning railroads di criminating in
favor of California that the roads ought
to treat Texas fairly They had msde
money < ut of the state and it was to their
interest to give us as low immgraut rte
as to anv other point We have advant
ages superior to other states
General A S R berts merchant and
also commander of Ttxi3 military said
the railroads ought to unite in the move
ment to boom Texas and bring immi
grants into the state to settle up ber
waste places The railroads themselves
possessed vast bodies of lands here and
it was to their interest as well as the
state to settle it up
Ragland Liser wholesale merchants
said they warmly endorsed the movement
to boom the state and her lands Thev
w ere for it every time and thought The
Gazette had done a good thing in startj
ii g this movement
Dr D T Iglnheart the leading cotton
merchant of the city said let the rail
roads alone They have done a greet
deal for the state already In fact we
ought to thank them for making Fuch
rates as to take all the worthless class of
people out of the sttte to Calfornia never
to return Texas has a large clas3 f
thriftless lzv goodfornotblng people
whtchwe could well spare Again we
did not want the railroads to bring us
any more paupers we had enough of
that class already We didnt want such
people as would come on an emigrants
ticket Th class we did want was west
ern people thrifty and industrious such
as those who had built up the state of
Kansas
Mr Crooker a prominent lumber
dealer said a man who came to Texas on
an emigrant ticket was not desirable as
to cheap labor we had enough of that al
ready
A number of other gentlemen were
seen and with few exceptions endorsed
the policy of The Gazette
