More than one-fourth of the whole num-

tnwarila tVi ronpTXl nnrl Ktrpnirllipntncr nf
out relations as one people, and removed
" - e s
'serieui cause for discontent on the part
of tha inhabitants of those . States. . It
would have accorded with the great prin-
"ciple enunciated in the Declaration of
American Independence that no people
.ought tq bear the burden, of taxation, nnd
yet be denied the Tight of representation,
j It would have been in' consonance with
. the express" provisions of the Constitui
tion, that each State shall : haVe at least
.without: its consent," shall be deprived of
its equal suffrage in the Senate. These
. provisions were intended to secure to ev
ery State, the right of representation in
.each house of Congress; and so important
wai , it ; deemed by the. frame rs of the
Constitution that the eoualitv of the
.States in the Senate should be preserved,
that not even by an amendment of the
Constitution can any State, without its
,'eonsept, be denied a voice in that branch
of, the National legislature.
It is true, it has been assumed that the
existence o the States wa3 terminated by
the rebellious acts of their inhabitant?, 1
and .that the insurrection having been
suppressed, they were thenceforward to
be considered merely f as conquered terri
tories. "The Legislative, .hxecutive and
Judicial Departments of the Government
h&ve.however.with great distinctness and
uniform consistency, refused to sanction
an assumptiaa'io incompatible with the
nature of our republican system, and
with the professed, f objects, of the war.--Throughout
the recent legislation of
Congress, the undeniable fact makes it
self apparent,- that these tenr political
communities are nothing-less than States
of the Union. At the very commence
ment of the rebellion.each House declar
ed, with a unanimity s lemarkabla . as it
was significant,' that th war: was not
"waged, upon our oart, in any spirit of
oppression, nor tor any purpose of con
quest or Bubjugation, nbr purpose of over
throwing or interfering with the rights or
established : itstitutions ' of those States,
but to defend and maintain the suprema
cy 6f the Constitution and all laws made
in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the
Union with all the dignity, equality, and
rights of the several States unimpaired;
and that as soon as these objects": were
acOmplished the war ought to. cease'."
In some instances Senators were permit
ted to continue tneir legislative functions,
while in other instances - Bepresentatives
were'elected and admitted to seats after
their States had ' formally declafed their
right to' withdraw from the Union, and
were endeavoring to maintain that right
by force of arms. - All of Jhe States
whose people were in insurrection, as
States,' were included in the' apportion
ment of the direct tax of twenty millions
of dollars annually laid upon the United
btates by the act approved 5th August,
1861.: Congress, by ; the act of March
4, 18C2,and by the apportionment of rep
resentation thereunder, also recognized
their presence as States in the Union;and
they have, for judicial purposes, been di
vided into districts, as States alone can be
divided; The same recognition appears
in the recent legislation in reference' to
Tennessee, which evidently rests upon
the fact that the ' functions of the State
were not destroyed "by the rebellion, but
merely suspended; - and that principle is
of .course applicable to those States which,
i?i ; 'm :t ... ...-
iik, o.ennessee, - auempiea 10 renounce
their places in the Union.' ' -: ;
..Tlxe action of, the Executive Depart
ment of the Uovernment upon this sub
ject has been equally-definite and uhi
lorm, and tne: purpose ot the war was
specifically stated in the Proclamation is
sued by my' predecessor on the 22d day
of September, 1862. It was then solemn
lv proclaimed and declared that "here
after, as heretofore.the war will bejprose-
cuted for the object of practically restor
ing the", constitutional, relation' between
the United States and each of the States
and the people thereof," in which. States
that relation is or may be suspended or
disturbed. .
( The recognition ,of the. .States by the
Judicial Department; of the Government
has also been clear and conclusive in all
proceedings affecting them as StatesV had
in, the Supreme,-,. Circuit . and District
Courts. r..'. ; ' . ,
, : In the admission of Senators and Bep
resentatives. from :. any .anoV: all- oft the
States, , there can be no just ground of ap
prehension, that persons who are disloyal
will be clothed with the powers of Iegisla
tion; for this , could not happen when the
Constitution and the laws are enforced b
a vigilant and faithful : Congress. Eac
House is made the "judge of the elec:
tions,; returns, .and. qualifications, of-its
owo:membersf" and.-may 'with the con
currence of . two-thirds, expel & member.'.'
When a Senator, or Kepresentative pre
sents.hia certificate of eloction.ho may at
once be admitted or; rejected; or, should
there be any question as to his eligibility,
his credentials may be referred for mves
tigation to! the appropriate committee.
If admitted to a. seat, .it must be upon
evidehco- satisfactory; to ; the , House of
which he' thus becomes a member ,tbat he
possesses the requisite constitutional and
legal, qualifications s If -refused admis
sion as a member, for want of, due allegi
ance to the Government, and returned to
his constituents,- tney are admonished
that none but persons loyal to the United
States will be allowed & voice in the Leg
islative Councils of the Nation,;and the
political power and moral influence of
Congress are - thus effectively, exerted in
the j interests ' of - loyalty : to tho Govern
ment ! and fidelity to the Union. , Upon
this question, so
terestfl of the Union and the permanency
of our present form of Government, my
convictions, heretofore : expressed, , have
undergone no change; but on the contra
ry, their correctness has "been confirmed
by reflection and time.T! If the admission
of loyal members to seats in the respect
ive Houses of Congress was wise and ex
pedienta year ago, it is no less wise and
expedient now. If this ; anomalous con
dition-is right how-if, in the exact con
dition of these States at the present time
it is lawful to exclude them from repre
sentation,.! do. not see that the question
will be changed by - the efflux of time.-
len years hence, if these states remain
as they are, the right of representation
will be no
stronger the right of exolu
sion will be no weaker.
5 The Constitution of the United States
makes it the duty of the President to Te
commend to the consideration of Con
gress "such measures as he 'shall judge
necessary or expedient." I know of no
measure more imperatively demanded by
every consideration of national interest
sound policy, and equal justice, than the
admission of loyal members from the uow
unrepresented States. This would con
summate the work of restoration,and ex
ert a most salutary influence in the re-establishment
of peace, harmony; and fra
ternal feeling It would tend greatly to
renew the confidence of the American
people in the vigor and stability of their
institutions. It' would "bind us more
closely together as a iiationvand enable
us to 6how to the world the inherent and
recuperative power of a Government
founded upon the will of the people, and
established upon the principlcs of liber
ty, justice and intelligence. Our increas
ed strength nd , enhanced prosperity
would irrefi-agably demonstrate the falla
cy of the arguments ajainst free institu
tions drawn from our recent national .dis
orders 'by the enemies of republican gov-'
eminent. The admission pf loyal mem
bers from the States now 'excluded from
Congress, by allaying doubt and nppre-
hension, would ; turn capital,' .now await
ing an opportunity for investment, into
the channels ef trade and industry. It
would alleviate the present troubled con
dition of those States, .and by inducing
emigration, aid in the settlement of fer
tile regions nowjuncultivated, and lead
to an increased production ef those sta
ples which have -added so greatly to the
wealth of the nation and the commerce
of the world.i? New fields of enterprise
would be opened to our " progressiva peo
ple, and the devastations of war would
be repaired, and all traces of our domes-
tie differences effaced, from the minds .of
our countrymen.,"'! v f v I '.:!
In our efforts to preserve "the unity of
Government - which- constitutes us -one
people," by restoring the ' States to. the
condition which thev held prior to the
rebellion; we" ihoald be-cautious, : lest.
havin? rescued out nation from the per
ils of threatened' disintegration, - we re
sort to consolidation, and in the end ab
solute despotism, j as a remedy for the re
currence of similar troubles. The war
having terminated, 1 and with it all occa
sion for the exercise of powers ot doubt
ful constitutionality, we should hasten te
brinz legislatioa within the boundaries
pi-escribed by the Censtitution.and to re
turn to the ancient landmarks established
by our. fathers ; for the guidance of sue
eeeding generations, "The Constitution
which at any time exists,' until changed
by an explicit and authentic act of the
Whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon
all " ;,'If, in the opinion of the people,
the ' distribution or modification of the
constitutional powers be, in any particu
ar. wrong, let it be corrected .by an
amendment in the way in which the Con
stitution designates. - But let there be
no change by usurpation; ' for "it is the
customary weapon by which free govern
ments are destroyed." Washington spoke
these words to his countrymen, when,fol
lowed by their love and gratitude.be vol
untarily retired from the cares of public
life. "To keep in all things within the
pale of our Constitutional powers, and
cherish the1 Federal Union as the only
roxkof safety," were prescribed by Jef
ferson as rule3 of action to endear to his
"countrymen the true principles of their
Constitution, and promote a unionlot sen
timent and action equally auspicious to
their happiness and ; safety." J ackson
held that the action of the General Gov
ernment should always .be strictly confi
ded to the sphere of its appropriate du
ties." and justly and forcibly urged that
our Government is not to be maintained
nor
our ' Union preserved "by invasions
of the rights and powers 1 of the severa
States. In thus attempting to make our
General Government
weak. Its true strength consists in Ieav
individuals and States as much as
possible to ' themselves: in making itsel
felt, not in its power, but in its beceii
cencc:- not in its control,' but in its pro
tection; not in binding the Stale more
closely to the center, hut leaving each to
mote unobstructed in its proper consti
tutiqnal orbit."' These are the teachings
of men whose deeds i and services have
made them, illustrious-, and Who,' long
since withdrawn from the scenes of life,
have left to their country the'rich legacy
of their example, their wisdom,and their
patriotism. . Drawing fresh inspiration
from their lessbns.let us emulate them in
lo?e of country and respect for the Con
siituuon ana laws.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury affords , much information re
specting the revenue and commerce of the
country:.. His views . upon the currency,
and with reference. to; a proper, adjust
ment of . our revenue system,' internal as
well as tmpost, are commended to the
careful consideration of Congress; In
my last annual message I expressed my
general views upon these subjects. '
need now only call attention to tbe ne.
cessity of, carrying into every departmeh
of . the lioverument a system of rigid ac
countability. thorough retrenchment an
wise economy." With no exceptional or
unusual expenditures, the oppressive bur
dens of taxationcan be lessened by such
a modification of our. revenue laws as
will be consistent ' with the public' faith
and the legitimate and necessary wants o
tne. uovernment.
- The report presents a much more sat
isfactory condition pf-our. finances than
one 'year .ago the most sanguine could
have anticipated. ; During tbes fiscal year
ending the 30th June, 1865, the last year
of : the war, the public debt was moreased
$941,902,537,and on the 31st of Uetober
1865, it amounted to 52,640,854.750
-,:.On the 31st day of October, 1866, it
had been.reduced to $2,551,310,006,- the
diminution, during a period of fourteen
months, commencing September 1, 1865
and ending Ootober 31,1866, having been
5206,379,565. In the last annual repor
on tbe state of the finances, it was esti
mated that during the three quarters o
the fiscal year ending the 30th of June
last, the debt would be increased $112,
194,9:47. During that period, however,
it was reduoed $31,196,387,, the receipts
f the year haying been $89,90a,905 more
and the -expenditures $200,529,235 less
than the estimates. Nothing Could more
cleany mdieate than these statements th
extent and availability of the national re
sources and the rapidity and safety with
which, under our . form of government
great military and naval establishments
can he disbanded, and expenses reduce
from a war to a peace footiag
During the fiscal year ending the 30f
of June, 1866,; the receipts were $558,
032,620, and the expenditures $520,750
940, leaving an available surplus of $37,
2S1,6S0. It is estimated that the receipt:
for the fiscal year ending the 30th June
1867,' will be $475,061,386, and that the
expenditures will reach tbe sum of $316
428,078, leaving in the Treesury a sur
plus of $158, 633.308. For the fisc
year ending June 30, 1868, it is estima
ted that the receipts will amount to $436
000,000, and that the. expenditures wii
be $300,247,641 showing an excess
$85,752,359 in favor of the Governments
These estimated receipts' may be dimin
ished. by, a reduction of excise and import
duties; bat after all necessary reductions
shall have been made, the revenue of the
present and of following years will doubt
less be sufficient to cover all legitimate
charges upon the Treasury, and leave a
large annual surplus to be applied to' tha
payment of the principal of tho debt.-
There, seems now to be no good reason
why, taxes may not be Teduced as the
country advances in population ' and
wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished
within the next - ooarter of a centurv.
The report of the Secretary of War
furnishes valuable and important infor
mation m-reference to tho : operations of
is department during the past vear.
ew volunteers now remain in the ser
vice, and they are being discharged as
apidly as they can be replaced by reeu-
ar-troops. ; The army has been promptly.
paid, carefully provided with medical
treatment, well sheltered and subsisted,
nd is to be furnished with ' breech-load
ing small arms. The military strength
of the nation has been unimpaired by the
discharge of volunteers, the disposition
of,-unserviceable or perishable slores,and
he retrenchment of expenditure. Suffi
cient war material. to meet anjemergency
has been retained, and, from the disband
ed volunteers standing, ready to respond
o the national call, large armies can be
rapidly organized, equipped and concen
trated, fortifications on tho. coast and
frontier have received, or are being pre
pared for more powerful atmaments; lake
surveys and .harbor and river improve
ments are. in course of energetio prose
cution. Preparations have been made
or the payment of the additional -boun
ties authorized during the recent session
of Congress, under such regulations. as
Will protect the Government from fraud,
and secure to the honorably, discharged
soldier the - well-earned reward :of his
faithfulness and gallantry. More than
six thousand maimed soldiers have receiv
ed artificial limbs or other surgical appa
ratus; and forty-one national cemeteries,
containing the remains of 104,526 Union
soldiers, have already been established.
The total estimate: of military appropri
ations is $25,205,669. :. ,
It is stated in the report' of the Secre
tary of the Navy that the naval force con
sists of 278 vessels-, armed . with 2,351 '
guns. Of these 115 vessels, carrying
1.029 guns,' are in commission, distribu
ted chiefly among seven squadrons. ..The
number of men in the service is 13,600.
Great activity - and vigilance have been
displayed by all the squadrons, and their
movements have been judiciously and ef
ficiently ''arranged in such manner as
would best promote American commerce,
and protect the rights and interests of our
countrymen abroad. The vessels unem
ployed 'are undergoing repairs,' or. are
laid up until their services may be requir
ed. Most ' of the iron clad fleet is at
League Island, in the vicinity of Phila
delphia, a place which, until decisive ao
tion should be taken by Congress, was se
lected by. the Secretary ' of the Navy as
the m6st eligible location for that class
of vessels. It is important that a suita
ble public station should be provided for
the iron clad .fleet. It is intended that
these vessels shall be in proper condition
or any emergency, and it is desirable
that the hill accepting League Island for
naval purposes, which passed the House
of' Bepresentatives at its last .session,
should receive final action at in early pe-i
riod, in order that there may be a suita
ble pubho station for this class ot ves-
sels, as well as' a navy yard of an area
sufficient tor the wants or tne service on
the Delaware Biver. The Naval Pension
fond amounts to $ll,750,000,having been
increased $2,750,000 during the year.-
The expenditures of the Department for
the fiscal year ending 30th June last were
$42,324,526, and '.the estimates, for the
coming jear amount to to $23,668,430.
Attention is invited to the condition of
our seamen, and the importance of legis
lative "measures for their relief and im
provement. The -suggestions in , behalf
of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens
are earnestly recommended - to .the
favorable attention Of Congress..,''. .
;The report of the ' Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition of
the postal service, and . submits recom
mendations which deserve the considera
tion of Congress. The. revenues; of the
Department for the year ending June 30,
1866; were $14,386,986, and the expendi
tures $15,352,079 showing an excess of
the rlatterxn- $96o,093. i In anticipation
of .'this deficiency,, hoWe.ver,a special ap
propriation .was. made by. Congress in the.
act approved July, 28, 1866. Including
the standing - appropriation' of $700,000
for' free mail matter, as a legitimate por-:
tion of. the revenues yet remaining un
expended, the actual deficiency ! for the
past year is only $265,093 a sum within
$51,141 of the amount estimated ;in the
annual renort of 1864- ' The decrease-of
revenue compared with the previous year
was one and one-fith per cent., and the in
crease of expenditures, owing principally
to the enlargement'of the mail seryice.in
the South was, twelve per cent. r On the
3th of June last there we're.in operation
6,93Q mail routes, with an aggregate
length of 180,021 miles, an aggregate an
nual' transportation of 72,837,914 miles,
and ah aggregate annual cost, including
all expenditures ef $8,410f184. - The
length of railroad routes is 32,092 miles,
and the annual transportation 30,609,467
miles. The length of steamboat routes
is 14,346 jniles, and the annual transpor
tation 3,411,962 miles. The mail service
is rapidly ' increasing . throughout; -the
whole country, audits steady extension
in the Southern States indicates their
constantly . improving condition. ;: ; The
growing importance; of tbe foreign ser
vice j also merits- attention. ' The -Post
office Department of Great Britain and
our own have agreed upon a preliminary
basis for a new Postal Convention, which
it is "believed, will, prove eminently bene
fieial to the commercial interests of the
United States, inasmuch as it pontem:
plates a reduction of the international
letter postage to one-nau tne ex sting
rates; a reduction of postage with all pth-
t i i . t I
er countries , to and irom wnicn corres
pondence is , transmitted , in the British
mail, or in closed mails through tbe Uni

and territorial transit of correspondence
in closed mails; and an allowance to each
Postoffioe Department of the right to use
all mail communications established un-
der the authority . of the other for, the
dispatch of correspondence, f either. ..in
open or closed mails, on the same terms
as those applicable to the inhabitants of
the country providing the means of trans
mission, : (. -. ... ' .
; The report of the Secretary of the In
terior exhibits;, the condition of those
branches of the public service which are
committed to his' .supervision. During
the last fiscal yearr tour million'sixhund
dred and twenty-nine thousand tureo hun
dred -and - twelve acres of publid land
were dippescd of, one- million eight bun-
dred and. tiaety-two.. thousand five .hun
dred and sixteen acres nf which were en
tered under the homestead act. The pol
icy originally adopted relative1 to the pub
lic lands has undergone essential modifi
cations. Immediate 'revenue, and not
their rapid settlement was the cardinal
feature of-bur land system.' :' Long expe
rience.. and. earnest discussion,. have .re
sulted in the conviction that the early de
velopment of, our agricultural resources
and the diffusion of an energetic popula
tion over our vast territory, are nbjects
of far greater importance . taJhe national.
growth and prosperity than the proceeds
land.' toi the highest
bidder in open market. ' 'The1 pre-emption
laws confer upon the pioneer who
complies with the terms "they imposelhe
privilege of purchasing a limited portion
of "unoffered lands' at the minimum price.
The homestead enactments relieve the
settler from the payment; of purchase
money, and secure him a permanent home,
upon the condition of residence for a
term of years. This liberal policy invites
emigration from the' Old,' and from the
more crowded portions of the new world.
Its propitious results are:undouhted, and
will be more signally : manifested when
time shall have given to- it a wider development..-,
, j. V, . f . !T i, .. -
Congress has made. liberal grants of
public ,land to corporations, jn aid of, the
construction of railroads and other in
ternal improvements. Should thia'pol-icy-;
hereafter , 'pre vail, ' more -stringent
provisions will be required to secure a
faithful application of the fund. The
title to the lands should not pass, by pat
ent or otherwise, .but remain in the Gov

As a subject upon : which ' depends an
immense' amount of the' production and
commerce of tbe eountry, I' recommend
to Congress such legislation as may be
necessary for tbe preservation of the lev
ees or. the Mississippi river. it is a
matter 'of nationaI.importance that early
steps should, be taken not only to add to
the 'efficiency, of these -barriers ' against
destructive inundations, , but for lthe re
moval of all obstructions5 to the free and
safe navigatiqn of that great channel of
trade,, and commerce? .; ., . r,

Our fellow citizens residing in the . Dis

son is perceived why " a delegate of their

The increasing enterprise and rapid prog

highly gratifying,--and I trust that the

In the month of April last, as Congress
is aware, a friendly arrangement was
made between the':Emperorl,.of. France
and the President of the , United States
for the withdrawal from" Mexico of the
French expeditionary military . forces.
This .withdrawal .was to .'.be effected ;. in
three detachments,-the first of :whichIt
was understood, would leave Mexico, in
November.now past, the second in March
next, and the the third and last in No
vember, 1867. Imme.diately-poncthe
completion of the evacuation the French
Government' was to assume the' same at
titude of non-intervention, in regard to,
Mexico.as is held by the 5 Government of
the United States. 'Repeated iassurances j
have been given by -the Emperor, since
that agreement, that he would complete
the promised evacuation : within the pcrin
od mentioned, or sooner .:,:?;V :..fi.t ' )
It was . reasonably expected that the ;
proceedings thus contemplated would pro
duce a crisis of great political interest in
the Bepuhlic1 of Mexico, yi The newly-ap
pointed Minister of.the United States,iMr.
Campbell,7 was therefore' sent forward, on
the 9tli day of November last, to' assume
his proper functions as Minister, Plenipo.-.
tentiary of . the United States to that lie-,
public- It was also" thought ;expedient
that he should be attended in the vicini
ty of Mexico by the'iieutenant: General
of the Army of the United States, -with the
view of obtaining suehHnformation" as
might be important-to determine the
poursi lo be pursued by theUhited'States
in re-establishing and maintaining neces
sary arid proper intercourse with the Be
puhlic. of rMexico. rDeeply interested in
the cause of liberty and humanity, it
seemed an obvious dnty,-pn; our part to
exercise whatever influence.we possessed
for the restoratip.n'and permanent e'stah
lishment in that country, of a domestic
and republican form nf Government, v"
. Such wast tha condition of affairs- in
regard to Mexioo; when, orti .thej 22d; of
November last,' official information was
received from Paris that the'Eroperor of
France had some time before decided not
to withdraw a detachment of his forces' in
the month of November "past, according
to -engagement,-but that this decision was
made with - the ' purpose Ib'P withdrawing
the whole of those forces in the ensuing
spring. ' Of this determina'tionrhowever,
the United States haV not deceived any
notice or intimation; and,' .sq'80on 'aS' the
information was received' by the Govern
ment, Care was taken' tor make known, its
dissent to, the1 Emperor bf France- .'"
I,'.' I cannot'forego '. the whope that" .France
will' reconsider the subject!and"adppi
some resolution in regard .. to the evacua-
tion of Mexico which will conlorm .as;
nearly as practicable-with the -existing
engagement, and thus meet the just ex
pectations of the United Sfates.' The pa
pers relating to the subject will .he, laid
before you. It is' believed that1 with the
evacuation of Mexico by the expeduion
ary forces,-no subject for serious: differen
ces between France and the United States
would remain. The expressions -. of
the Emperor and people- of France war
rant a hope that 'the tradionary -friend
ship between the two 'countries might in
that case be renewed and permanently re

r A claim of a citizen of the United States
for indemnity for - spoliations-committed
on tbe high seas by the trench authori
ties, in the exercise of a belligerent bow
er against Mexico," has been' met by the
Government; of France with a proposition
to defer settlement 'until' a mutual con
vention for' the 'adjustment of all claims
of citizens and subjects of both countries,
arising out pf the recent wars, on this
Continent, shall be agreed upoii by the
two-: countries
suggestion is not
deemed
unreasonable but it belongs to
Congress to direct the manner in
which
claims ror inaemnity by foreigncrs as
well as by "citizens of the United States,
arising out of the late civil war, shall be
adjudicated and determined. iJ I have no
doubt that the subject of all such claims
will engage your attention at a oonven
ient and proper times-"
It is a matter' of regret that no con
siderable advance has been made toward
an adjustment of the differences between
the United States and Great Britain,aris
ing out of the depredations upon bur na
tional commerce and other tresspasses

kowever, may.be believed to. have result

situati&n' of Great Britain! ' An entire
change of ministry occurred in that coun
try;durng tne last session of Parliament.
The attention of the new ministry was
calle to the subject at an early day, and
there is some reason to expect that it"
v7ITl"now he considered in a becoming and
friendly' spirit." jTbe importance of tn,
early disposition of jthe 'question cannot
