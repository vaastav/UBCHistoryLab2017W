PRICE FIVE CENTO
HIGH COST OF
SEWER SYSTEM
Comparisons Show It to Be Twice
That of Other Cities
If any one, within the present sew
er system, doubts that he is paying
enough for the sewer system laid in
the adjacent alley next his abutting
property, let him carefully read over
the costs in a few of the other towns
and cities in the state and in Wash
ington. It will be remembered that
$80,000 bonis were voted to lnstul
about 4 2,000 feet of sewer. Every
citizen within the sewer district own
ing property therein, is assessed his
proportion of the $80,000, although
it is said all of it will not be needed
and the balance will be refunded.
With 42,000 feet to construct and
$80,000 required, means nearly two
dollars per running foot for the con
structing of the entire system. The
city clerk of Idaho Falls informs us
that $1 per running foot will cover
tlie expense in his city.
In ISoise the assessment for sew
ers are levied upon the square foot
area of all abutting property. This
has varied from 6 to 8 mills pel
square foot. In other words a lot
50 by 110 costs from $33 to $44.
"This," states the city clerk of Boise,
"includes the cost of the entire sys
tem; of engineering expenses, inan
jholes, flush tanks, main sewer, etc.,
ias well as the actual cost of the pipe
adjacent to each property owner."
Is it probable any property own
er within the present sewer district
[will be asked to pay only $33 for his
by 110 foot lot? Any one who
lever resided at Idaho Falls or Boise
knows digging in Coeur d'Alene is
a comparative snap, not a rock en
countered in the entire system and
the dirt the most easily removed in
jthe world. It can all be spaded.
Let us come a little nearer home.
[Colfax. Washington, has a sewer ays
tern. Much of the town sets on rocks
Considerable blasting is encountered
in installing a system there. The
soil Is much more difficult to remove
than in Coeur d'Alene and our city
[is as level as a floor compared with
Colfax. Still the city clerk informs
jus that when the system was instal
led in 1896, it cost $22.50 per 50
foot lot." In 1904, a new district
was added which cost $25 per 50 foot
|lot."
A citizen residing in Colfax, is as
sessed on his 50 foot lot at the rate
of 50 cents a running foot or $25 a
dot. He has rocks. Palouse hills, and
mard soil to pay for. In Coeur d'
[Alene on the same sized lot he is as
■(1 from $75 to $100 or three to
[four times as much without rocks
or a Palouse hill or hard soil.
We learned that Caldwell, Idaho,
[has installed or rather Is installing a
sewer system. We are in formed by
jthe city clerk of that place that the
p.vstem Is about 11,000 feet long—
hot as large a contract as Coeur d'
jAlene and every thing being eqaul
should cost more. The cost of this
; entire system, including the main
jthe pipes, man holes, covers, flushing
inlets, excavation, fitting, and pipe
laying was $9719.93—considerably
jless than $1 a running foot. In Coeur
d'Alene it is nearly $2 a running
foot. The clerk informs us that the
[work was done by spading, that sand
"as constantly encountered and
[throughout nearly the whole work
the water had to be pumped from the
[trenches." The soil in Caldwell re
sembles that in Coeur d'Alene ln-so
far as there is much sand encounter
ed but In our city pumps were not
[kept running night and day by the
[contractor in order to permit the men
[to work at all. In Caldwell the clti
;Z'*ns pay less than one half as much
[l*er lot as in Coeur d'Alene. In Cald
well at this rate a 42.000 foot sewer
system would cost $35,000 but in
Coeur d'Alene it coats $80,000.
Coming direct to the property as
RPs sment per running foot in front
of the lots and we have a coat of $3
Per running foot as against $1 and
in other cities in Washington
■tid Idaho.
These facts were ascertained by
Press from the officials of tbr
towns and cities mentioned and show
that Coeur d'Alene is paying an out
rageously high price for its sewer
system.
KING OSCAR IS DEAD
Beloved Ruler of Sweden Pauet
Away.
STOCKHOLM, Dec. 8.—Oscar II,
king of Sweden, died at 9:10 o'clock
this morning. The death of the ven
erable monarch occurred in the royal
apartments of the palace, where, sur
rounded by the members of tha fam
ily, including the aged queen Sophia,
and the crown prince, Oscar Gustave
and high ministers of state, the Inev
itable end had been awaited, while
outside the palace great crowds stood
with bowed heads and tearful eyes
long after the announcement came of
m
w
OSCAR AND SOPHIE.
the death of their well-loved sover
eign. The whole country is bowed
with grief, for King Oscar was some
thing more than a ruler of the people,
and had endeared himself to them at
an intimate and personal friend
When the flag was dipped to half
mast there was a moan of anguish
from the assembled multitude, and
many of them cried, "Our dear old
king is dead."
Gustave Becomes King.
The succession to the throne of
Sweden now passes to Oscar Gustave
Adolphe, duke of Verland, the oldest
son of the late king. At a meeting
of the council of state this afternoon
the new king took the oath of alleg
iance under the title of Gustave V.
and adopted the motto, "With th*
People of the Fatherland." The prin
cess then took the oath of allegiance,
and the new monarch accepted the
homage of the Btate officials.

BUREAU OF MINES
Great Industries Should Have Recog
nition.
The recommendations of President
Roosevelt in his message to Congress
In favor of the creation of a Bureau
of lfinee under the control and dlrec
tlon of the Secretary of the Interior,
will meet with hearty response
throughout all this western country,
and very likely will be favorably re
ceived throughout the country at
large, as it crtalnly ought to be.
Those who oppose It will be the windy
sharpers, and the complacent, self
sufficient absorbers of money In New
York City who do not care anything
about American industry, except as
they can exploit It to their own ad
vantage A Bureau of Mines properly
conducted would give the American
people a great and trustworthy view
of the whole mining situation at all
times, and would have surveys, rec
ords, and geographical investigations
on file that would prove valuable to
the public at all times.
The Bureau of Mines would natur
ally and speedity grow far beyonl the
limits outlined by President Roose
velt in his message. His idea is that
this bureau should "Include statistics,
make investigations in all matters
pertaining to mines, and particularly
to the accidents and dangers of the
industry." That surely would be one
important function of the bureau, hut
far and away beyond this it should
have knowledge at hand with regard
to mine deposits of the country and
details of all operated mines, it
should have special experts investi
gate mineral deposits, proving their
extent and quality, and Indicating
by the scientific explorations and sur
veys of mineral deposits, including
metals of all kinds, carbonaceous de
posits, hydrocarbons, oils, the situa
tion of mineral bearing strata, and
everything now mined of value or
that could be mined of value to the
people at iarge or to the country.
And we should expect to see this bu
reau grow Into a Department with a
Secretary at the head of it, precisely
as the Department of Agriculture
grew from a small beginning of a di
vision in the Interior Department,
then a Bureau, and finally a separate
Department, with a Secretary at the
head a member of the Presidential
Cabinet.
The limited function outlined for
a bureau by the president would cer
tainly be useful, but naturally there
would grow from it a wonderful in
crease of opportunities and useful
ness. The geological survey of the
country would naturally be found un
der the control of this Department
of Mines when it is created, and that
is a matter of the very highest im
portance to the whole country. The
work of the geological experts is es
pecially valuable In the mining In
dustry; and a thorough survey
of the whole country would be of Im
mense benefit to all. The idea will
no doubt develop from the Bureau of
Mines into the Department of Mines
far more rapidly than any other Bu
reau has so developed In the history
of the country; because, when the
Bureau of Mines is opened It will be
so thronged with business, with the
addition of matter that is so appro-!
priate to the work of such Bureau.'
that it will speedily be found that it
Is the mere beginning of a great work
to be done. But the fact that it is a
beginning is the main point, and so
we welcome the President's sugges
tlon and are sure that it will be sup-j
ported loyally throughout the mining
regions of the country, and should
be by everybody. And there is no
reason why It should not take actual
form at the present session of Con
gress.—Salt Lake Tribune.

ROBBED A RESIDENCE

$35 Taken.
Joe Stark, residing at 1622 Second
street, met with a loss last evening
while away from home. Some one
entered his house and took $35 in
cash from a drawer. It is thought
nothing more was molested. There
is no clue as to how an entrance was
effected but It is probable that the
intruder had a pass key. Mr. Stark,
kept his money at home for safe keep

DRUGGISTS FOL
LOW^ CUSTOM
Say They Have No Intention of
Violating Law
The Coeur d'Alene druggists when
Interviewed concerning the case of
Mrs. J. M. Anderson vs. Hugh Whit
aker charging him with selling llq
our without a license made an Inter
esting statement. Mr. Whltakei
said;
"The boy came iu and got the stuff
and I certainly gave it to him on a
written order and thought I was act
Ing in good faith and using discretion
In furnishing It for medicinal pur
posea."
Mr. Wilkins, of the Goeur d'Alene
drug store said: "It has always been
customary to fill orders for liquors
for medicinal purposes. In case*
where minors are sent to the store
by the parents, we have always re
quired written orders signed by the
parents. We have repeatedly refused
to fill orders when written order*
were not furnished or when we were
satisfied that a legitimate use was not
to be made of the liquor."
One of the proprietors of the Lake
side Pharmacy stated: "The Lake
side Pharmacy uses Ita discretion In
filling all orders presented by tninort
for liquors believing we have a right
to fill all such orders for medicinal
use."
Albert Porter, of Porter A Bon
said: "It is customary to fill all or
ders for llqours for medicinal pur
poses. These orders must be signed
by responsible persons."
The order upon which Mr. Whttak
er claims he sold the brandy rads at
follows: "Please let the boy havr
50 cents of Plso'a cough syrup; 50
cents of syrup of figs and a 50 cent
bottle of brandy.
"L. M. ANDERSON."
It was this transaction that caus
ed the complaint to be filed against
Mr. Whitaker.
Prosecuting Attorney Potts was
asked to give his view of the matter
and made the following statement:
"It is a violation of law for a drug
gist to sell Intoxicating llquora of any
kind without a state license, except
upon the written prescription of a
regular practicing physician of this
state, who certifies that In bis opinion
the health of the party to whom the
liquor Is to be sold requires, or would
be promoted by the use of the partic
ular kind of liquor prescribed, or he
may Bell wines for sacramental pur
IKMtes only, or alchohol for mechanic
al and scientific purposes. A druggist
cannot sell liquors or wines to Ite
drunk, or permit the same to be
drunk in, upon or about the premises
where sold under an circumstances.
If the druggists are under the impres
sion that they have a right to sell
liquor upon a written order, other
than the prescription of a practicing
physician, they are mistaken

other person has a Government li
