FLAN POSTAL CHANGE'S.
Board Sends Congress Draft of
Reorganization Bill.
WTaahlamMmi. Dec. 17.— The final report of the
joint commission on the business method of the
PostofT.ee Department and the postal service was
submitted to both houses of Congress to-day, and
accompanied the draft of r» bill providing for the
reorganisation of the department and the codifica
tion of all of the postal la»!« The commission.
which has been considerin-.; a reorganisation scheme
for two years, consists of Senators Penrose, Carter
and clay and Representatives' Overatreet, Gardner,
of New Jersey, and Mron, of Tennessee.
In pointing out the defects in the present system
the commission names as the foremost of them
"the want of a permanent administrative head hay
inc. by reason of long continued practical experi
ence, a thorough knowledge of the business to be
conducted." he first step in the plan of the com
mission, therefore, is the creation of the office, of
director of posts. The duties of this officer, to be
performed in all cases under the supervision of the
Postmaster General, are those of general superin
tendence and management of tiie postal service. In
order to leave the Postmaster General free to per
form the higher dut'es of his office, most of the
administrative functions with which, under exist
ing law. be is burdened are transferred by the bill
to the director of posts, to be performed by him
directly. The Postmaster General, however, re
mains the administrator of the postal finances. in
respect of which the director Of posts exercises
powers only by expressed designation of the Post
master General himself. Comment insr on the ne
cessity of such a change, the commission says:
To fl'l the pap between the individual postmas
ter and the central administration the rotnmls
»ion purposes to create a new field organization.
It Is provided that the country sliall be divided
Into postal districts, each in charge of a district
superintendent of Doatofßose. The duties of these
district superintendents will be to keep postmas
ters to a strict performance of their duties, to
regulate and adjust the allowances given them for
rent, light, fuel and the salaries of clerks and
employes, and to maintain In each district store
room a stock of supplies sufficient for all current
n^eds of the offices within the district.
The reorganization scheme creates a new fiscal
system, which baa been worked out with great
care. The Investigation by the commission con
vinced its members that the present system of
money orders was entirely adequate for the trans
mission of considerable sums, but too expensive
and cumbersome for the transmission of small
■mna It provided, therefore, for the Introduction
of postal notes or money orders, without advices,
for the transmission of sums not exceeding Ja.
such notes to bo payable at any postoffice. ..he
fees charged will be considerably less than tno«=e
'or money order*.
The. plan proposed does not contemplate a sud
den and Immediate transformation of the old sys
tem Into the new. On the contrary, the new is
simply to be developed out of the old.
AMBASSADOR TO CHINA.
Senator Lodge Proposes to Raise
Minister RockhilVs Rank.
[From The ■ ■ me Bureau.!
Washington, Dec. IT.-Senator Lodge Introduced
in the Senate to-day an amendment to the diplo
matic an.! consular hill raisins the rank of the
American Minister to China to that of Ambassador.
1, hi believed that this step would-be regarded. as
a preat compliment by China and would serve t..
cement more firmly than ever the cordial relations
now existing between the United States and that
country. Not only would the United States be one
of the' Brat nationa-poaaibly the nrst-to show to
China this distinguished consideration, but it would
entitle the American representative to periodical
access to the prince recent and thus render less pos
sible any misunderstandings In the future.
The measure if adopted, will increase the com
pensation of Minister Rockhlll from H2.OM to H7.800.
The amendment was referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations.
CONFER ON WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
Delegates Favor Uniform Laws— Will Submit
Bill to Congress.
Washington. Dec. 17.— That all the states of the
Union should have uniform laws on the subject of
weights and measures, or that there should he a

ference of the national organization of Inspectors
of weights and measures of the United States,
which began Its two-day session here to-day at the

The inspectors from several of the states declared
that they could give startling testimony as to some
of the methods used to defraud by the use of false
weights and measure?. Approving letters from a
number of national commercial associations have
been received in large numbers at this conference.
The State Superintendent of Weights and Measures
of New York declared that the direct I" 1 to the
' people of his state by short weight was not less

Washington, Dec. 17.— Postmaster General Meyer
to-day announced that he. would nut renew his
order Issued in December, HOT, permitting delivery
to charitable organizations of letters addressed to
"Sam a <"lavs." plaints have been made by
many charitable organizations that it was not
possible to investigate each case, ad that many
presents given out fell into the hands of unworthy
persons. The practice was also objected to on the
ground that it tended to make beggars of children.

-rfitfßK DAILY TRIBUNE. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 18, 100S ,
SAY ANMIS WAS SOUGfiT
QUERIES BY T. J. HAINS.
Testimony of Bay side Club Members j
—Victim's Wife Changes Front.
The prosecution in the trial in Flu.-l.ing of ,
Thornton J. Halns began an attack yesterday on
the story that Thornton and his brother. Captain
Peter C. Hams, went to the Bayslde Yacht CIUD
on '•eal estate business on the»nlght of the killing
of William E. Annis. Frederick A. Storm, a real
estate dealer, testified that Thornton, now being
tried as principal with his brother in the murder
of Annls, met him at the yacht club on the night
In question, and that after a little preliminary
business conversation Thornton asked where An
nis could be found.
On this statement District Attorney Darrln hopes
to base the proof that the alleged realty errand
was merely a blind.
Another point claimed by the prosecution was
made when Charles Birchneld. a former friendjol
Annis testified {hat Thornton Hama drove him
back with a revolver when he tried to prevent th-»
shooting. When court opened Justice Crane ruled
that the elaborate and expensive node! of the
tragedy was Inaccurate and could not he used.
On the whole, however, the defence felt some
what elated over the outcome of the fourth day a
the trial. The prosecution, after taking con
siderable testlmouv. was obliged to go back
and bring on witnesses to prove that William K.
Annis had been killed. Mrs. Annis, widow of tne
victim, was herself put on the stand to establish
the fact of his death. Martin Skura. who said he
drove the brothers to the club on the night of tllfl
shooting, proved so worthless a witness that air.
Darrin withdrew him In confusion and was re
buked by the court for his lack of preparation.
Frank EHerson. a negro waiter si the yacht club.
Bl=o proved d'wnpointingly forgetful as to the. visit
of the' Halns brothers. Ha did say, however, that
he bad been approached by a man who hud tried
to havr ; Ire sign a statement that it was no« the
Hams brothers who appeared In the club reception
Mom on the night of the shooting and asked about
Annls. He said lie refused to sign the statement.
WIDOW NOT HOSTILE TO HAINBES.
It was learned yesterday that Mrs. Annis. largely
upon whose testimony the state expected to convict
Thornton J. Haiti* of murder in the ,"rst degree as
an accessory to the killing of her husband, had .
changed her attitude toward the brothers aft-:
hearing more detailed reports of the circumstances j
surrounding the tragedy and was no longer hostile.
At first she felt the mo^t active animosity toward
both brothers. . , .
Another new light on the case was shed in the
morning, when Hatess counsel said that Thornton
J. Hams had had some trouble with William E. ,
tnnls over the publication of a magazine article !
last June. It is said that the author submitted a
manuscript to Mr. Ripley. owner of the magazine j
on which Annis was employed, in May, and that
Annis induced Ripley to return it. Counsel for |
Hams says that the defendant then wrote a letter
to Ripley saying he knew why the manuscript was |
rejected, and added. 'I will get even with him yet."
This Is the threatening letter referred to by Special <
Prosecutor White In his opening address, according
to counsel for Hams, who further -ay they will :
show there was no threat in the defendant's |
communication, and that the episode simply mdi- j
cated Annte's feeling toward the author. The law
yers say that they will prove that Hams some time |
previous to this affair had Annis discharged from a ,
place with a publishing company.
It will he asserted when the defence present? Its
case that Thornton Hams and bis brother went to ,
Bayslde to find a borne where the author's young :
daughter Molly, a sufferer from a throat affection. ,
might have the benefit of country air.
The defence also claims Mr. Birehfield, who lives |
at No. 34S East 119lh street. Manhattan. He has j
also been considered one of the state's chief wit
nei?S A P , and his testimony yesterday was not con- i
sidered particularly In favor of tne defence when |
Mr. Mclntyre. chief counsel for Thornton J. Hams, ;
grilled him during a long and trying cross-examina- i
tion. The. defence expects, however, that he will I
give evidence that will cast doubt In the jurors' .
minds whether Thornton J. Hams did not. as a
matter of fact, really go to the Hay side Yacht Club
to look after a proposed real estate deal, and no:
to assist his brother to kill Annis. Yesterday he.
testified that Thornton J. Halns. learning that Mr
Jespeson, the real estate man, was not to be found
about the club grounds, urged Captain Hams, in
Birclifields hearing, to go away.
Thornton Halns was greatly pleased with the re
suits of the day.
"This has been a field day." said he. "I look h'.
the situation In. this manner: The prosecution haH
used much of Its best material, out of which we
have scored a number of very tellng points. It has
not much left, while all of the defence remains for
us. I have felt confident of acquittal from the
first. Now I feel certain of it."
There was same excitement when it was said
that "Charles A. Curtis." of Princeton, X. .»., who
had written General Hams to offer testimony re
garding alleged boasts made by William E. Ann
regarding Mrs. Peter C. Hams, jr.. wife of Captain
Halns, had committed suicide near Baltimore. The
defence had placed some considerable dependence,
on this witness' testimony. The suicide's real
name is said to be Orlan C. Cullen. which may
have been the name of the letter writer. The causa
Of the suicide and. Indeed, the fact whether or not
It really was < !lA witness for the defence who
took his life appear to be surrounded with some
mystery.
MRS. AXNIS CALLED.
The calling of Mrs. Annis by District Attorney
Darrln created a stir in the court. She laid aside
her heavy sealskin (oak, evidently expecting a long
ordeal. District Attorney Darrln. however. simply
asked her if she saw her husband in the Flushing
Hospital.
"I did." she replied
"Did you tee him die "
"Yes, sir."
"What was the time?" asked Justice Crane.
"About twenty minutes past seven." she said.
Whether Mr. Mclntyre would have ventured to
cross-examine Mrs. Anils or not, any chance that
he might, have done so was vehemently negatived
by the defendant, who vigorously shook his head
at his coui<C?!i w hlsperteg:
"No, no, no!" «
Mrs. Annis Is expected to spend considerable
time in testifying either to-day or to-morrow.
Mr. Birchfleld testified that Thornton J. Halns
asked him about real estate, and that while they
were talking about an introduction to Mr. Storms
the gentleman with the defendant (meaning Cap
tain Hams) beckoned to him. calling him. aside.
"They held a whispered conversation," said the
witness.
"Where did you next see them?"
•They were walking down the dock. A little later
I saw them standing at the end of the etringpiere.
others also were on the dock— Mrs. Ann is, Mrs.
Rockwell, Mrs. Nfeebit and others. I entered again
Into conversation, and we talked of boats.
"The defendant asked me if Annis's boat was oae
of the one design class.
"1 pointed out the Annis boat, which bore the
number 7. It was one of two bouts coming down
the bay.
"He aeked me If Annls would have to com" in be
fore the rae°. I replied thai he. would, as I al
ways sailed with him. and he would have to come
In after me.
"Did you see what Captain Hams did?"
"Not at that time; my whole attention was on
the boat. Annis sat In tii- stern, handling the
tiller. Mr. Harvey was amidships. I caught the
forest to stop th<- boat.
"As i stopped the boat I heard a shot 1 whirled
eround and saw the defendant. Captain Ha as
was behind "him. I could not see Captain Hans
clearly, but he was crouching I made a step tow
ard him. I said :
"•For God's sake, is he crazy?"
"The defendant said: 'Keep back, keep back!
He knows what he Is doing.'
"The defendant stood with his legs well braced,
a pistol In nil hand. This was pointed nt me. I
bad a little headway and didn't »t< \> or. the in
stant, and be saM
" "Don't Interfere or you'll gel the same thing.'
"lie then turned from me and pointed his re-
VClVffr at, Mr. Roberts I do lint recollect lust
what happened next i became rather hazy and
do nit know what happened until i saw Annls be
al<ie the mast. However, i heard three distinct
ahota. i remember counting ■<»■, two, three.* Hut
after be pointed the I ■■■ at me my mental condi
tion was such that 1 couldn'l not- the. number of
shots. I could not measure the time, for th* »«m«
reason."
"Mrs. Annls ran down to the float same time
aiur th« gun was pointed at me. She wu «crewa-
In*. The defendant spoke to her. I do not know
what he paid.
•'The defendant pointed th« gun at Mrs. Annls.
and she turned and went up the runway to the
dock."
Mr Mclntyre, on crosi-examination, endeavored i
to prove by Mr. Blrohfleld that the Swede boat- j
man did not rush upon Captain Halns until after
the shots had been fired. This point the defend- .
ant's counsel considers of infinite importance to ;
the defence, for. he contends. if the Swede rushed
threateningly nt Captain Halns the defendant
would be fully Justified in endeavoring to protect j
his brother from what he tool* to mean a threat I
against Captain Hatns's life. The witness was ,
confused regarding the number of shots, but said ,
he believed Tonnlng. the Swede, had rushed upon j
Captain Mains Immediately after the firing of the |
shots that he had noticed.
Thornton Haino stood up In the courtroom at Me-
Intyres bidding to make a. demonstration of the
position the witness described. The defendant's
lawyer assumed the place of Captain Hams In the
scene.
"Did you hear Thornton Hams say to his
brother: 'Jespeson Is not here. Let's go back?' "
•Yes sir, I heard him pay that In substance."
"Was It when Annla'a name was mentioned that
Thornton Haines said to his brother: 'Come along;
let's go: Jespeson Is not here?' "
"1 think It was after Annis's name had been
mentioned."
Mr. Storm, the real estate dealer, who is a rrem
ber of the club, corroborated previous testimony
relating to the Inquiry made by Thornton .T. Hams I
M to the whereabouts of Annls. Storm said he
pointed out Annis's boat, which was at a distance
on the bay and approaching the float.
"I got a boatman to row me out to the boat I
was to sail in the race." said Storm. "I heard ■
shot and a woman scream. I sailed to the float
at once, and sprang upon It. T saw Roberts on the
float, and others. The Hams brothers were to
gether. The defendant was on the north side of
the float, standing beside an upturned rowboat. The
doctor called for quiet, because there was so much
excited talk. I asked the defendant, near the automo
bile in which the defendant and others went away,
•What In the world did he shoot him for?'
•If he'd done to me what he did to him. I a
have shot him also.'
• "Then Captain Hams turned to his brother and
said:
" "You keep out of this.' "
Upon Mr. Mclntyre's motion this testimony was
stricken out because it was Irrelevant. ■";•_•■-;
The adjournment was taken for the. night before
the wltn-ss was cross-examined.

itable and educational institutions, consisted of the
introduction by the contestant, the testator's sister.
Mrs. Charlotte H. Arnot, of Elmira. of evidence
In an endeavor to establish the fact that the per
sona, eccentricities and penuriousr.ess of the testa
tor, as related by the contestant's witnesses, were
the result of a diseased mind and were only mani
fested to a marked degree during the year In which
the will In litigation was made. Mr. Rockwell, this
testator's former servant, contradicted some testi
mony damaging to the proponent's case which he
had given on direct examination, and qualified pre
vious statements in a manner that partly substan
tiated the proponent's contention that the. testa
or's pecuriousnees was not restricted to the last
year of his life, when he made his will, but was
manifested for many years. Mrs. Rickey, who was
Mr. Hewitt's cook and chambermaid, testified that
the latter did not take a bath for a year preceding
his death. His towels, said the witness, were per
mitted to hang on the racks until they were covered
with dust
Mrs. Fannie R. Whitney, of Rochester, daughter
of the contestant, was tha last witness examined
to-day. It is generally believed that she is the real
contestant, it being asserted thit she instituted the
proceedings in the name of her mother, who la
more than eighty years old and bedridden. Mra
Whitney's testimony was that Mr. Hewitt exhibited
marked mental deficiencies during the last year of
his lifo. Sh=> testified that when asr mother an
nounced to Mr Hewitt her intention «f giving $1,000
to a church Mr. Hewitt exclaimed: "Who ever
hesnl of a person giving so much money to a
church f
From th.lt time until hla death, said the witness.
Mr. Hewitt pereiatej.tly adhered to the belief thai
her mother was cre»y. mid wrote several letters to
the witness reminding her of that fact. The wit
ness testified that on another oaowalMß, when her
mother announced her intemion of giving KCO to
charity. Mr. Hewitt became greatly agitated and
exclaimed to the witness: "Your mother la insane
in spending money. If this continues we wU! all
be bankrupt and I will be forced to spend the re st
of my days in the poorhouse."
These conversations, the witness sflid BC* '•-*.
about the time Mr. Hewitt made his will.
