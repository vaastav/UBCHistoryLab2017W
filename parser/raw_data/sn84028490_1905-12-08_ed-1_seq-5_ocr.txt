Sympathy of Ameri

The First Petition in the
Senate Was, f From .a,
& Woman "All Alone in
the World," Wants an
Appropriation.
Washington, Dec 5. Thl was the
president's day In congress. His an
nual message, aggregating over 27,
000 woros, was read U both branches.
It was the longest stato paper ever
produced by l'rea'.cent Roosevelt. It
treated on 12 general subjects. Some
of these, notably the. topic of labor,
contained a half dozen or nioro Im
portant sub-divisions.
However much his auditors might
differ in opinions, It was a signifi
cant fact that tho president's view
received unusually close attention,
particularly upon tho regulation of
railroad ratca. The reading required
over two hours and a half. Iho sen
ate adjourned Immediately after. The
Republican members held o caucus,
selected Senator Allison as chairman
and fjistiucted hi in' to appoint a com'
miltcu on committees to fill vacan
cles In standing committees.
Iho first patltlon presented in the
senate' of tho 59th congress was put
in by VIco President Fairbanks., It
was from Miss Sarah Miranda Clymer.l
who lives in Brighton, N. J. It was
addressed to the "legislature of the
United States",-and nfter lecltlng the
fact that tho petitioner Is "all alone
In tho world" explained that the fol
lowing law ought lo be passed as
soon as possible:
"1 Bo it onacted that tho trcas-

VIEWS ON THE MESSAGE
Republicans as a Rule Think It a Very
Worthy Document.
' Washington, Dec C.-Opinlons' on
tho president's message aro almost as
various In character as tlio topics
treated v.cro great In number. An
n rule tho Republican members of
both branches characterized- Jt as an
'admirable' Uo'ciment. Many, declined
to express themselves even .piivatcry.
Representative Payne, of New York,
Republican lloor leader, said:
"I think the president presents an
uncommon amount of food for
thought. Many of his recommenda
tions aro very courageous, and most
of them aro extremely commendable."
Representative John Sharp Wil
liams, of Mississippi, Democratic floor
leader, said: t
"I agree almost In toto with tho
president's expressions on tho railroad
matter. In regard to insurance, how
ever, I don't seo how tlio president
will make connections."
Senator Boverldgc, of Indiana, was
loud In his praises of tho message:
"It's high and lofty in tone and
will .provo a tonic to the body poll
tic." Senator Rayner, of Maryland, said
ho found many good points In the
document, but ho took Isssuo with
tho president on his South American
policy.
Tlio only realty discordant note for
(publication was from Senator Morgan,
q Alabama:
"The message is a mass of plati
tudes, latitudes and tho personal re
flections of our strenuous young presi
dent. He gives us, as usual, a mora
holy than thou dissertation on such
subjects as ho deems worthy of con
conslderatlou, and expects us or Im
agines that we wlir'acccpt them as
gospel." ..
