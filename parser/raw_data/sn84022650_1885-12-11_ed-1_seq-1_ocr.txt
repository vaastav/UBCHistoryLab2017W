Senator Dolph's bill, introduced in the
senate last Tuesday to repeal the timber cul
ture, pre-emption and desert land acts, pro
vides that in place of these modes of enter
ing land, all persons entitled under the laws
to make homestead entry shall be entitled
to enter a section or less of desert or moun
tain lands. Such hinds are denned as all
lands exclusive of timber and mineral lands
which will not produce agricultural crops
without irrigation, and all lands which are
so mountainous and roogk that they cannot
be cultivated. It further provides that any
forty acre tiact of which three-fourths is
desert or mountainous, shall be desert or
mountainous laud.
The secretary of the treasury has trans
mitted to congress estimates of appropri
ated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887.
The total amount estimated as required for
All fhe expenses of the governient is $339,

sura cp lied for in estimates submitted last
year, and $5,006,710 more than the aggre

The Sunday Capitol says that rumor has
it that Mr. TiUlen's letter on coast defenses
was prompted by democratic job politicians.
It says: "Mr. Bar num. of Connecticut, an.l
some democratic statesmen of the sort who
have Mr. Tilden's ea, have got the idea
that lots of money is to be made out of the
construction of heavy guns and steel for
formications. They are said to have care
fully laid their plans to rake iu. millions.
Mr.i&aiitiaii, hading out what was going
on, hits -begus to stir himself to see that
Pennsylvania does not get left in the grand
distribution of contracts. Mr. Barnum and
others who ere with him have stirred Bp
Tnden to write the letter, which, it is
thought, wid have great influence with
democratic members of congress, and grease
the way in both houses for the passage ot
heavy appropriations. It is barely possible
that our great coast upholders have ascer
tained that Mr. Cleveland does not take
quite so much interest in their schemes as
they would like to have him, and for this
reason they have invoked the voice of Mr.
l'ildeu two days before the meeting of con
gress an I publication of the president's mes
sage. "

Salt Lake City has been full of .rumors of
intended rebellion by Mormons. The gov
ernment evidently anticipates trouble, as
Battery B, from Omaha, has been suddenly
dispatched to Utah. It is thought by some
that the president's message will contain
some expressions on Mormonism which may
create a disturbance.
The United States grand jury, at Sau
Francisco, while making no indictments,
ays in its reports, regarding frauds in con
nection with the restriction act: "We are
convinced that gross irregularities and frauds
have been perpetrated, and that these could
not have been done except with the con
nivance or assistance of certain officials c m
jiected with the customs department." The
whole matter is theu left to the future) grand
jury.

taken by the forty-ninth congress to provide

ted Senator Sherman for president pro tern.

ence and consideration should be promptly

Laud Commissioner Sparks has weakened
slightly, and will issue patents where ex
aminations have been made by government
detectives and no frauds found. There are
now about tv. euty ageuts and detectivts ex
amining claims, and they manage to get
through about four a week, at which rate it
will take them something like 150 years to
complete what Sparks has given them. He
will certify to homestead entries where
residence, improvement and cultivation have
been made according t law. In other
wonts, he will issue patents to mose woo
have lived five years upon their homestead
and hive in ol legal improvements and the
araouut of cultivation required.
A long letter from Samuel J. Tilden to
Representative Carlisle has been given to
t press. It is a suggestion to congress,
and advises the expenditure of the suip.ua
now in the treasury for the construction of
coast and harbor defenses. The letter says:
If we do not make the expenditure neces
sary to provide for our sea coast defenses
when we have a surplus and have no need
to levy new taxes, we ceitaiuly will make
these expenditures when we have no longer
a surulus in the treasury. lo leave onr
vast interests defenseless in order to reduce
the cost of whisky to its consumers would
be a solecism." Also: "The best guarantee
against aggression, the best assurances tuat
our diplomacy will be successful and pacific,
and our rights and honor respected by other
nations, is in their knowledge that we are
in a situation to vindicate our reputatii n
md interests. While w may afford to 1 e
deficient in means of offense we cannot af
ford to be defenseless. The noteriety of
the fact that we have neglected the ordinary
precautious of defeuse invites a want ot
consideration in our diplomacy, and in
justice, arrogance aud insult at the hands of
foreign uations."
