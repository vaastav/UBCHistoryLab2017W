AFTER MAIN LINE I
FOR THEIR TOWN
Hardinsburg Citizens Want Spur
Taken UpContest Withdrawn
Slaton Dismissed
Hardiusuurg Ky Dec 12Spe
SpecialNow that the building of the
proposed railroad from Madisonville to
Fordsville seems assured the citizens
ot this place are anxious to have the
HendeSon Route take up the spur and
run the main line through the town
It is believed that the railroad com
pany and the town could agree upon a
route with little or no difficulty Tho
railroad should maKe a proposition
which if reasonable would be readily
accepted by the citizens who seem to
realize that this is the time to get the
main line through here
In the contest cases it has been
agreed that the suit of W S Ball
against W 1 HOOK shal1l Iw dismissed
at the February term of circuit court
The reason Is that the subscription to
the contest fund is not sufficient to
prosecute the suit and Mr Ball does
not feel that he oucht to pay the great
cost of such a proceeding himself

WEAK LUNGS
Do you Fear Consumption
When we take into couculeration the
fact that one out of every seven in this
climate die of consumption is it any
wonder that it is feared by the people
of Cloverport who have weak lungs and
chronic colds n ml coughs
A fatuous London physician has for
years urged his patients wheu the
slightest tendency to consumption ap
peared to take the best cod liver prepa
ration they t could find and physicians
everywhere have recognized that the
cOils liver 1 contains curative values for
coughs colds bronchitis consumption
and all wasting diseases unequaled in
medicine but unfortunately few could
take and derive any benefit from old
fashioned cod liver oil and emulsions
on account of the indigestible grease
which they contain
A member of the firm of Short St
Hayues our local druggists says We
want every person in Cloverport to
kow the value of our new cod liver
preparation Vinol It actually contains
in a concentrated form all of the
strengthening bodybuilding elieiueats
of cod liver oil actually taken from
fresh Cods livers without a drop of
grease to upset the stomach nUll re
tard its work
Therefore where old fashloned cod
liver oil or emulsions would do good
Vinol will do tRiomorc good We
guarantee Viuol will improve the
appetite strengthen digestion make
rich red blood create strength cure
chronic coughs and colds and strn th
en weak luugs If Vinol fails to give
satisfaction we return your money
without question Short Haynes
