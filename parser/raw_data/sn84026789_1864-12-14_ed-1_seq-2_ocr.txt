'?The New York and West Vir
ginia Oil Company."
In pawing up street we now observe J
the front door of one of the room? j
of the old "Ionian House," just,' above !
<he Upper l'erry, this sign ? " The New
Vork an? West Virginia Oil Company's
Office."- We believe it is the first reg
ular office opened in the place for any of
the oil companies now operating in the
Valley, and as this is a rapidly growing
interest, and this Company the pioneer
.company, it may not be uninteresting to
?our readers to be informed in regard to
.their operations. The Company is com
posed of Gen. Crook, Gen. Avcrill, and
Copt A. W. Gregg, of the United States
Army, Iloratio F. Averill, liso.,%of New
York City, Oscar J. Averill, of Bath,
N. Y., and other prominent gentlemen
of New York and West Virginia.
They commenced through Capt. Jos. j
U. Wheeler, late Provost Marshal of this
?Congressional District, and other agents,
taking leases, before there was much
.excitement about oil in the Valley.
They have thui secured a large num
ber of leases on tho choicc oil territory
.(selected by Capt. Gregg, a practical
Geologist,) in the Valleys of Kanawha,
Klk and Pocotulico rivers and their
tributaries.
They now have several surveyors em
ployed in mapping their territory, pre
paratory to boring, and will probably
commence shortly after the Holidays.
There is probably no stronger Com
pany than this one operating in the
Valley; and they have uniformly made
liberal propositions to the land holders,
and in no instance taken advantage of
their want of knowledge of the oil bus
iness, as they might have douc in many
cases.
Those desiring to liavo the experiment
made upon their land, would do well to
call on this Company.
Then and Now.
In June, IStll, before Gen. Wise's
forces came into the Valley, the follow
ing warning and assurance appeared in
the Ilcjiitblicon ;
" The people on the other side of the
Ohio may be assured that in case of an
invasion, or any wanton assault or inter
ference from them, /A* people of this cut
try will be a unit in its Jr/aicc."
It also assured the people of Green
brier that the \ ankccs "would havo to
march over the dead bodies of every
Union man in the valley," before they
could reach them.
A 010 tho Republican claims to be
Union; but unfortunately for its con f is
tcncy, it was lead", in its last issue, into
the defencc of avowed sympathizers,
against tho attacks of "Moses," in our
columns! Come, Mr. Newton, please
explain hoto a Union man can consist
ently take sides with Traitors?
Hon. K. V. "VThaley.
We would respectfully call attention
of our representative in Congress to the
subject of our mails in this section. A
petition went on to tho Post Office Be*
partment some time ago, praying for the
opening of the routo from Kanawha C.
II. to Clendenin, Walton, ?fcc. There
aro many truly loyal citizens on this
route, and they need mail facilities. ?
The routo is safo from guerillas, and
ought to bo established.

Enrollment Lists.
Kvery citizen of Kanawha County and
of this District should make it hiti busi
ness to help correct this list so far as lie
may be able. Not only should every
man liable to draft who moves into his
neighborhood, or becomes of age, be re
ported?but those who are not liable,
from tho various causes, should have
their names stricken off at once, and
thus save much delay when the draft is
ordered. Besides, as each District's
quota is in proportion to the number of
jaep enrolled! it is evident that there
should be popo on the lists not really
Ijablp to draft. See to it at once.
Wc aro glad to learn that 3Ir. :
White, State Superintendent pf public
Schools, may be expected hero tormorrow
(p address our citizens on tho all-impor*
taut subject of education in West Vir
ginia. We shail be glad to havo the op
portunity of learning of him how the
Publie School system is progressing in
$e New Stat*. >Vo hope to aee a full
-Urooitt. , . ?
We copy the following, which concerns
all Union men licre, from the l'airmont
Xalional :
" Mil. Kditor : I wish to give on idea
of some of the doings in the Kanawha
Valley, in regard to the treatment, by
the civil and military, of outlawed rebel*.
The men I wish to speak of are Mr. I.
X. Smith, who is the son of IJ. II. Smith.
I. X. Smith held a commission in the
rebel service. The other is Dr. I. P.
Hale, who was captain of an artillery
company in Gen. Wise's Legion. Those
men linding they could make more
money by returning to Kanawha and
buying up Southern States' bank paper
and Confederate funds, threw up their
commissions and came sneaking back
through the influence of the U. S. Dis
trict Attorney, and in connection with
a few others commeoced their hellish
work of doubly-faced robbery of both
Xorth and South. They have bought
up this paper at eighty per cent, discount,
then forced the old and infirm president
of the Bank of Virginia, at Charleston, j
to give up those bonds which he had in
his possession which were on rebel
landholders, and advertised their farms
for sale. These men arc holding high
positions in the midst of Union men,
and refuse to take the oath to the New
State Government, and, neither the civil
or military can compel them to take it.
How iong shall such men as these, who
are as deep dyed traitors now ns they
were when they held their commissions
under Jeff. Davis, and ready to carry on
the work uf desolation and damnable
treason in trying to trample under foot
the glorious stars and stripes ? the
emblem of our nationality ? disrupting
and tearing asunder the Uuion of the.MJ
States, formed and joined together by
the wisest :tnd best men known to the
civilized world, be allowed to go at
large? How long, oh! how long!
will the people of West Virginia
suffer these brazen faced traitors to work
out their hellish purposes, sustained by
copperheads, upheld by traitors, and
working under the mantle of religion,
to prey upon the vitals of our country,
despised by Union men who knov\ them,
and doubly damned by southern traitors
whom they arc robbing? If there is no
other power that can reach them, where
is the Governor of West Virginia?
Would not u trip to Wheeling, with a
small escort dressed in Uncle Sam s
uniform, with bayonets, act as a general
purgative, and work out an oath that
might be soothing to these men's con
sciences, and rid us of a nuisance that
we have unwillingly borne for two years
without remedy ? If lawless traitors are
to be turned loose to roam at large, we
have no civil or military power, und
deserve no country."
We believe the above to be the forts.
If not, our columns are open to any one
who will give them. We want the peo
ple of Kanawha to know what is being
done and what is going on.
Now, no one who owes allegiance to
the so-called Southern Confederacy lias
any rights within our lines, except he be
a prisoner of war. These men still hold
to the secession cause ? they refuse to
take the Oath of Allegiance to the
United States Government. They do
not even ackuowledgo themselves as cit
izens of the State of West Virginia.
Therefore they have no rights hire.
Why arc they allowed to remain ?
What influence is brought to bear upon
the authorities f Can any good Union
man give any excuse why they should be
allowed the privileges, &c., of citizens,
while they declare themselves public
enemies to the government?
The Republican will find, by taking
the trouble to refer to the poll books,
that 1,422 is the vote which IvaDawha
recorded for Lincoln. H e do not " take
it for granted that all who voted for the
re-election of Lincoln will be regarded
as loyal," by any means. Neither is it
true that a small fuction" here claimUo
bo the only truly loyal men ; for the
mass of the people of Kanawha arc loyal.
1 But there arc not less than two or three
hundred, we venture to gay, in this
county, who would have voted for
McClcllan, or even for J<4j}\ Davis, if they
had dared.
Our Gallipolis correspondent has been
a resident here, and knows of what he
speaks.

Tiie election returns show our popula
I tion greater than before the war. The
statistics collected by Assessors, show
the value of property to be greatly in
creased. Everything proves us as a

began. We arc in a much better con
dition to crush tho rebels than we were
the day they fired into Fort Sumter.
Roger A. Pryor, who, when in Con

Parkersburg and the Oil Trade.
The people of Parkersburg seem to
have forgotten that there is war in the
1.111 J. When spoken of, it seems to he
mi item of news to them, it is as one of
<ie weird talcs of the past. They scciu
j tp say, that let others do as they will,
they and their families will know noth
ing but Oil ? Oil is their meat and their
drink, the sustenance of their lives, the
food of their conversations, the ?* ultima
tbule" of their existence. Under the in
fluence of the oil trade Parkersburg has
teken a fresh start, and is springing up
if?to vigorous life. The air is saturated
w^th oil, and the very earth so greasy
tfcat a man can hardly get a lease on
toy feet of ground that will stick ; and
y(it the people never stop to reflect that
their prosperity is built ou a very slip
pery foundation.
?Kanawha bids fair to emulate her sister
" vity" in this excitement. Every boat
ar;iving here brings strangers among us,
ea'^cr in the scareh of the " greasy trea
sure," while many of our own citizens
ar?; awakening to the importance of this
interest. No one who knows anything
ah^ut it, disputes the existence of oil
he^c. The only question is as to tjicin
tit$, and this must'bc determined by ex
periment. Several companies arc al
rci^ly at and about to commence work,
to Jest (his ? but at the same time tliey
arc". securing every available foot of " oil
territory" by lease. Those who would
sh?/e the untold wealth which nature
secpis to have hidden here, should be
up -and doing. When it is definitely
kntfwn how much oil thorc is here it will
be too late to get leases. ,J Nothing risk
nothing gain."
Major W. P. Hl'cker.? Major W :n.
P. Iluckcr, (better known as Dr. Ruekcr)
Senior Aid-de-Camp to Geo. Crook, ha*
resigned his commission in the U. S. 1
servlco on account of unpleasant rela
tion^ with a superior officer. The major,
since his resignation, has been ofTcrinl i
the commission of a coloncl by Gov.
foreman, and the command of our Stale j
troops now doing actual duty. 'J lie
major has not yet dccidcd to accept the
commission.
Kemarkahi.e On. Stkike. ? The
Pittsburg Chronicle of the 2Gth ult. says
Messrs. Pctinock, Ball & Co., of that
city, who for several months past have
been sinking a well on Bull Kun, not
far from Zmcsville, Ohio, are now ob
taining one hundred and sixty barrels o!
oil a day. Its specific gravity is said to
be thirty, and is selling at ticaiti/foiir
dollar* per hnrrcl at th>' Wfll. This is i
one of the most remarkable strikes in the J
history of oil.
The electors of President and Vicc
President meet on the first Wednesday
(the 27th) of December, at the capitols
of their respective States, to cast their
votes, which arc sent to the President of
the Senate, (the Hon. Hannibal Ifam
I i n ,) and counted before both houses of
Congress on the second Wednesday, (the
8th) of February. 1SG5.
Salmon P. Chase has been appointed
Chief Justice of the United States Su
preme Court. This honor is richly
merited, and the duties involved could
not have been entrusted to safer hands
than those which cared so well for the
public finances.
We give the most important features
of the President's Message this week.
What he says on the amendment of the
Constitution? in fact, the whole of it
is well worth reading a second time,
even. "
The Wheeling Jntclligrnccr of last
week, says : " At present tho city is
filled with soldiers whose term of scrvicc
has expired, and who have come here to
be mustered out."

here, is 'now in command of a Post at
Jacksonville, we believe, on the southeru
coast of Florida.

A " Pozor" Indeed.

by Mr. Jawrowskiceo, in New York, of
which thp following is a specimen article.
It is Polish we belicvo :

West Virginia Politics.
TUB STl'PK ?"K ARE MADE OF.
It is deeply to be regretted that many j
ure composed of material that will not,
stand the test in times of severe trial, t
With some, doubtless, it is a constitu
tional weakness. They instinctively :
shrink at the approach of danger, and j
could not, if they would, endure lliej
shock with that firmness of nerve so.
characteristic of others. Such deserve,
commiseration rather than ' censure,
rjainly, they won't do " to tie to." ^ ^ |
Others are weak from want of princi- ;
pic. Interest is everything with them, j
Thev seem to forget that true interest j
is a'i ways inseparable from principle.
They cannot forego a present advantage j
for the sake of a future one, even if the;
former be a shilling and the latter a for-'
tune. Their views arc limited ; they
never extend to the future. The whole !
doctrine of present sacrifices to obtain !
future good, is incomprehensible to
them, iloiv it could p?y to wage an
ei"ht years' war to establish the prinei- j
pie. 7-" So taxation without representa
tion.' ? would be to them as enigmatical j
as the hycroglyphies of Kgypt. I'ity
all such had not perished with the over- 1
throw of toryi.Mii. J 5u t it was not so.
They are here to-day, and their speech
betraycth them. Hear them: I must'
go with my property," and '? 1 must fol
low my State." Where questions of
interest are not involved, ?' party" takes
its place with them.
In an early day there resided in the
northern part of this State, a Christian
lady of color, who was ardently attached
to the Methodists. At that early day
"other denominations" had nut quite
agreed to allow the Methodists to go to
Heaven at all. iter Presbyterian friends
cautioned her to beware lest these .Meth
odists should lead her to hell. Her
reply was : If they go to hell I will fol
low them." .\ow I do not think in
this case the old lady incurred much
risk ; for. though she blindly followed,
hers were not blind leaders. Still the
policy (for it does not amount to princi
ple) is a most unsafe one. Interest should
be subordinate to, and How from, princi
ple. Clearly it will not do, n: any case,
to sacrifice principle to interest ; though
the contrary may often be necessary.
I'erhaps there is no period in tl.e world's
history in which the doctrine we advo
i oatc has received such decided and
unequivocal recognition as now. Ilovv
| noble and numerous are the examples
(of brave men who have laid their lives
with their property upon the altar, or
been driven into exile rather than vibrate,
as interest demanded, between the North
and the South. JIow infinite is the
difference between the exalted character
of the unswerving patriot, who risks all
for a principle, and the insufferable
meanness of the man who cannot ri.-e
above party prejudices or mere selfish
| interests ; or who takes both sides of the
i question, or neither, as a prudent regard
j to circumstances may dictate.
{ GROWTH OF runi.ic sknti.mknt.
j In the Old World, public sentiment
is at a stand still. Ages roll onward,
but it changcth not. Not so with us.
We are a nation of progressionists. We
are rapidly approaching manhood. Pub
lic sentiment with us is us if the waters
of the Atlantic should start westward
through the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
j thence up that river, leaping over the
? Kalis of Niagara into the great lakes,
[thence scaling the Piocky Mountains,
!.?hould mingle with the waters of ths
' Pacific. l>on't talk about obstacles; it
I is as resistless as the swelling tide of the
! ocean; it knows no control but His, in
! whose hand are the hearts of the children
of men. As a remarkable instance of its
growth, compare the Presidential elec
tions of 1SCU and 18(54. In the former,
but one man in this Valley dared to vote
for Abraham Lincoln ; in the latter, but
one mau was found to oppose him.
I Take another view. Many calm, uncx
citable men, who, in 1SGU, stood far in
[advance of the masses, in 1S(M found
themselves lar in the rear. If time and
tide wait for no man, neither docs pub
lie sentiment. Come now, you staid
gentlemen who have been left behind,
fall in, while the masses, after their
great achievement, stop to take breath ?
j lull in, fall in ; and don't .stay so far
behind, that, when the glorious work is
done, you cannot hear the shouts of
victory. Joshua.
Ens. Joi'knai. : Is " 8," the author
of the Obituary Biography of James C.
McFarland, which you published last
week, a rebel ? If not, why does lie, in
the concluding paragraph, eulogize and
lament the dcuth of rw.ry prominent
rebel, of whom death has rid us? If we
must say, '? nil nisi Loinna <U mortuit ,"
(nothing but pood of the dond.) then let
it he nothing , when those who have dis
graced a life otherwise honorable, by
turning traitors to their country arc
concerned. We believe it is not only
best for them but for their country
that they have been called away.
