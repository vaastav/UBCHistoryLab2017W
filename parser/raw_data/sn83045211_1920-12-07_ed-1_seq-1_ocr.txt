Undismayed by the defeat of hi
amendment which Fought te rcduce the
nrmv of empleyes of the Municipal
Court, Councilman William W. Ropm Repm
leaves here Friday for Chicago te study
the municipal court system in that city.
Although Chicago's population Is
greater then Philadelphia's, anil al
though the court there has thirty
judges, compared with nine municipal
court Judges here, Mr. Reper asserts
the. Chicago institution costs less than
the tribunal ruled by President Judge
Brown.
The Reper amendment, voted down
at tbe Council session yesterday, was
defeated by seven administration mem
bers who joined with the Varc minority
in killing the economy measure.
Must Curb Power
"If the Indiscriminate power of ap
pointment held by Judge Brown is net
Mopped,'' Mr. Reper said today, "he
will 60en be running the entire city.
The hnnds of the court seem te be
stretching out like an octopus, gather
ing in everything in sight, whether it Is
relative or net.
"There is no reason why the taxpay
ers here should pay mere for their
Municipal Court than the taxpayers of
ether large cities. Something very defi
nlti) should be done without delay te
curb the power of this institution. It
should net be allowed te interfere with
the funi tlens of ether departments."
Councilman Reper is assembling facts
bearing en the horde of jobholders ut
the Municipal Court. With compari
sons obtained from his study of the
Chicago court he plans te lay his in
formation before the slnte Legislature
te curb the job expansion in Judge
Urewn's uiMltutlen.

"I would tube Judge Brown's word

Councilman Montgomery's excuse today,
In explaining why he, supposedly an
administration man, etcd against the
Jleper amendment.
"I don't believe thut Councilman
Dcrclin or Councilman Reper made
much of an investigation of the Mu

'The trouble there is that some of
the jobs are net classified. Chief Clerk

Surgeon's Knife May Cure
Twe Youthful Prisoners
Wallace Hauikins, Shrewd Embezzler at 15,
Astounds by His Adult Views en Life and
Economics Other Bey Thief Flippant
The surgeon's knife may remove the
criminal propensities of two of the most mest
rcinarkablc boy prisoners who have ever
been In custody in tills city.
One is 'Wallace Hawkins, who will be
sixteen years old en February 10, but
who has proved himself already a crafty
and scheming thief.
Physicians will remove his tonsils,
which have been troubling hlra, nnd will
nt the same time study him te see if bis
precocious talent for stealing cannot be
essened by the removal of some pressure
.in the brain.
Hawkins was given a preliminary
hearing this morning at the Heuse of
Detention for the systematic theft of
$"e00 from his employer. He startled
even the eldest court attaches with his
remarkable intelligence as well as his
calm indifference te all sense of guilt.
"He is a boy of sixteen with the
brain of a man of twenty-five," snid
Superintendent Henry Richardson, who
held him for n formal henring later be
fore Judge Brown.
Hawkins is one of two boy criminals
who arc puzzling police and alienists by
their prececltv and their apparent lack
of any moral sense.
The ether boy is Klllett Mlchencr,
who stele about ?4500 from the Baldwin
Locomotive Works.

On the way back from New Yerk the
boy chatted gayly with the detectives.
"Gee!" he exclaimed. "When I get
back te Philadelphia I'll be the cleanest
prisoner they ever hud there. Wherever
I took n room in n hotel I took u bath

PEAN FOR INAUGURATION
Women took part In a meetin gef the
Republican City Committee nt Eleventh
and Chestnut streets today.
In honor of the women members,
there was an air of sartorial elegance In
the ntire of the men who attended the
meeting.
Of course, the fair members present
were well gowned and well millinercd,
tee, as they always arc but the men
well some of them were tailored te at
tend a Presidential Inauguration cere
mony at Washington just ns they were.
It was te discuss plans for attend
ance nt the Inauguration ceremonies en
March 4 that the meeting was called.
A cemmitter of five was appointed by
Themas W. Watsen, chairman of the
city committee. This committee will in
quire into hotel rates, transportation fa
cilities and ether matters with special
Instructions that the comfort of the
women members shall be looked after,
Varc Will Stick
During the discussion Senater Vare
took opportunity te deny n report thut
he intended te "withdraw from active
party management." He declared that
as long as the Republicans of the
Thirty-ninth Ward wanted him te
represent them In the committee he
would always take nn active part in its
management. I
f After pointing out the victories of the
Varc forces during the last year, the
senator directed his remarks te the
women. It was most important, the
senator asserted, that every woman be
assessed. He regretted that many wom
en declined te give their names te their
assessors prier te the last election and
expressed the hope. In view of the big
Republican victory, that they would
net besitnte in the future.
Reems Loelc Their Best
There were mere thnn u score of
women scattered throughout the room.
And the heudquurtcrs never looked mere
spick mid span. The blue velvet carpet
seemed te novo an extra glow for the
occasion and the mirrors reflected mere
pleasant! than ever before.
There seemed te be an eagerness en
the part of the prominent leaders pres
ent te outdo each ether in paying trib
ute, te the women from the standpoint
of citizenship.
Councilman CharleR B. Hall, who
weie a trim-cut dark blue suit with
double-breasted coat and n purple tic
vhicli contrasted hurmniiieusly with his
;rny hair, said if the committee Bl
ended the Inauguration be believed the
wmien should go, tee. He pointed out,
however, that the trip might be fraught
with much inconvenience as hotel lie lie lie
ouimedalions were limited and the trip
.Miulil lie very expensive.
I)as Net Always Nice
Themas W. Cunningham said that,
although he would be glad te sec the
women go along, be feared that they
i.ight meet with much -disappointment.
"Out of nine Inaiiguratieusw Inch I at
tended," lie said, "only two were pleas
nut ft mn the stund?rlnt of weather. The
londitlens are different In ether ways,
loe." I
Aftrr listening te many addresses ei

At Hawkins' hearing tills morning,
the youthful prisoner was the most
composed and unriifilcrf person in the
court room. He frankly admitted all
the charges agninst him nnd said that
be bail once before been in a similar
scriipe but refused te tell where.
Runaway Bey Barb
It was learned at the hearing that his
brother, Jeseph, had run away from

10-CENT CARFARE
EN
Public Service Ce. Declares It
Must Increase Present
7-Cent Schedule
HOT PROTESTS EXPECTED
The Public Service Railway Ce. today
petitioned for a ten-cent trolley fore in
Camden nnd elsewhere in New Jersey,
effect l e Jununry I.
The petition was sent te the Public
Utility Commission by Themas N. Mc
( arter, president of the company, who
snid tiie lines will be forced out of busi
ness unless the increase from the pres
ent beven-cent fare is granted.
The move for n higher fare was at
tacked almost immediately by Majer
Charles II. Kills, of Camden, and ether
.tOlrtlnlti lltn.A r,...n. t.lll.. l.t .!. ..1...
i'. .ivit.tr. mi-itr. .,iuwi l.llin Mllll UU' I'JIJ
and civic bodies will fight the fare rise
"teeth and nail."
In a letter te the utility commission,
Mr. McCarter said the company hns
been incurring a deficit fur the last
three years, which new totals $.'i,t!00,
000. The seven-cent fare, grouted one
yenr age, he stated, failed even te pro
vide an $800,000 depreciation fund.
Tiie financial troubles of the company
in Camden nnd iu ether sections of New
Jersey nre said te be complicated by
a thriving jitney business.
In Camden the .public used the jit
neys when the trolleys were boycotted
because of the zone fare plan! The
Mtnev habit formed then hns continued
in favor with many riders. It Is be
lieved the trolley company has lest
thousands, of dollars because of this
competition.
An uproar of pretest against the pro
posed ten-cent fare Is expected because
a valuation of the company's lines bus
uet been completed.
Frank S. Van Hart, president of tin
Camden City Council, stated today the
proposed ten-cent fare "is obviously
excessive." The question may be ills'
cussed tonight at n meeting of Council.
William J. Strnndwitz, president of
the Camden Chamber of Commerce,
said lie is net prepared te comment en
the requested fare increase. "I feel the
preposition should be brought te the
attention of members of the chamber,"
he added.

When I addressed myself te per

of the Union I feutid my tneught
dominated by an Immortal sentence
of Abraham Lincoln's;
"Let us have faith that right
makes might, und in that faith let
ns dare te de our duty as we under
stand It," a seutence immortal be
cause it embodies in a form of litter
simplicity und purity the essential
faith of the natleu, the faith in
which it was conceived and the faith
in which it has grown te glory and
power. With that faith and the birth
of a nation founded upon it came the
hope into the world that a new order
would prevail throughout the affairs of
mankind, an order in which reason
and right would take precedence of
covetousness and force, and I believe
that I express the wish and purpose
of everj thoughtful American when
I say that this sentenee murks for
us in the plainest manner the part
we should play alike In the arrange
ment of our domestic affairs and in
our exercise of influence upon the
uffulrH of the world.
Ry this faith, and by this faith
alone, eon the world be lifted out of
its present confusion and despair. It
was this faith which prevailed ever
the wicked force of Germany. Yeu
will remember that the beginning of
the end of the war came when the
German people found themselves face
te face with the conscience of the
world und realized thnt right was
everywhere arrayed against the wrong
that their government was attempt
ing te perpetrate.
Sajs Faith Wen War
I think, therefore, that it is true te
say that this was the faith which wen
the war. Certainly this is the faith
with which our gallant meu weut iute

The Sinking Fund Commission of the L

conference iu the office of Majer Moere
tedny.
Themas K. Mitten, president of the
cempnn, former Ooierner Kdward S.
Stuatt und the Mayer were present at
the meeting. When the conference was
ever Mr. Mitten said that nothing but
the sinking fund had been discussed.
Since 1007 the cefpany has been paying
$10,000 monthly Inte n fund which will
keep en growing until 1057, when the
city will take ever the P. It. T. prop
erty and the fund wll be divided among
the stockholders of the company.
which arc equal In their administra
tion laws which secure its full right
te labor and jet nt the same time
safeguard the integrity of property,
nnd particularly of that property
which Is devoted te the development
of Indiistrj and the Increase of the
necessary wealth of the world.
Must SUuid for Right
Second, by standing for right' and
justice us towards Individual nations.
The law of democracy Is for the pro
tection of the weak, and the influ
ence of ever democracy In the world
should be for the protection of the
weak nations, the nation which is
fitVuggllng towards its right and
towards it proper recognition and
privilege in the family of nations.
The I'nlted States cannot refuse
this role of champion without put
the stigma of rejection upon the great
and devoted men who brought Its
government Inte existence and estab
lished It in the face of utmost unl
crsal opposition and Intrigue, een
in the face of wanton force, as, for
example, against the Orders in Coun
cil of Great Britain and the arbitrary
f Napoleonic decrees which involved us
in what we knew ns tiie war et 101.
I urge you te consider thnt the
display of an immediate disposition
en the part of the Congress te rem
edy any injustices or evils that may
have shown themselves in our own
uutienal life will afford the most
cffectuul offset te the forces of chaos
and tyranny which are playing se
disastrous a part in the fortunes of
the free teeples of mere than one
part of the world. The United States
is of necessity the same democracy
of the world, and the triumph of
democracy depends upeu its suc
cess. Budget Sjstcm Urged
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slew
en the ether side of the water and bus
given premises. I venture te say. of
early completion only in our fortunate
ceuutry ; but even with us the re
covery halts aud is impeded at times
and there arc immediately serviceable
acts of legislation w hich It seems te
nic we ought te attempt, te assist
that recovery and pree the inde
structible recuperative force of n
great government of the people.
One . of these Is te prove that a
great democracy ran keep house as
succevsfully and in a businesslike u
fusJilnn an any ether government.
It seems te me that the first step to
ward proving this is te supplj our
selves with a sjstematie method of
hnndllng our estimates and expendi
tures nnd bringing them te the point
where they will net be nn uiineecssurj

words, u workable budget sjstem, and
I respectfully suggest thnt two ele

President's messaee delivered te
Congress today. It was sent by mes
senger and rend by clc-ks.
I'rIdent-elePt Hnrdlng held
conferences with his ndvern en ap
pointments te his cabinet, and the'?
League of Nations. '
The recemmendntinn of the joint"
nericulttiral committee that the war
finance beard be revived was re-,
ported te the Senate, and will b
taken up today.
By the Assi'dnted I'rcss
Washlnrten. Dec. 7. President Wil Wil
eon, in his annual message te Congress'
nresented te that bedv today, declared
that the United States cannot refusV
the' role of champion of weak nt(eas.
He said that It Is the destiny A
America te lead In the attempt te make
the spiritual power of democracy prevail
and that democracy is in its final test.
Cenr.'ete Rcremmrndntlcns
President Wilsen's concrete recom
mendations te Congress in his message
were :
ReWsien of the tnx laws with sim
plification of the income nnd profits
taxes.
Independence for the Philippines.
A lean te Arineuln.
Kconemy in government nppreprla
tiens nnd expenditures nnd creation of
a "workable budget sjstem."
Celd storage and ether laws uffectinf
the cost of living, nnd the federal
licensing of corporations as recom
mended in previous messages.
Rehabilitation and training of dis
abled soldiers and sailors.
The President did net indorse a bonus.
Nowhere did the President directly
refer te the League of Nations or the
pence treat fight.
However, lie may have referred te the
League of Nations b inference In bis
opening when he quoted Abraham Lin
coln's "Let us have faith that right
makes might, nnd in thut faith let us
dare te de our dutj as we understand
it."
President's Valedictory
At its dose the President wrote a
paragraph which might be regarded as
a valedicterj saying: ;
"I bae net se much laid before you
a -cries of recommendations as sought
te utter u confession of fuith, of the
faith te stand h until my Inst fighting
du. I believe this te be the faith of
America, the faith of the future and
of all the victories which awuit national
action in the das te come, whether
ill America or elsewhere."
"DemecrHcj," the President said,
"Is being put upon its final test "
"The old world." said he, "is just
new suffering from a wanton rejection
of the principle of democracy and a
substitution of the principle of nuteci
raej as asserted in the name but with
out the autheritj and sanction of tb
multitude. This is the time of all ether
when democracy should prove its purity
and its spjiritiinl power te prevail.
It is surely the manifest destiny of
the United States te lead in the at
tempt te make this spirit prevail."
KxAirlr Within Own Berder
Twe ways "in which the United
States can asist te accomplish this
great object" were eutliued by the
President. The.v were:
"First. Bj offering the example
within her own borders of the will and
power of demecriic te make and enV
force laws s li ! It are unquestionably
just uud which are equal lu their acl
ministration
"Second Bv standing for right and
justice as toward individual nations.
