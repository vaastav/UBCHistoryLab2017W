""Tiii Pitis'lD'fcirt's Messaoe. This document,
Sfekd la both branches of Congress to-day, !t
largely devoted to the topic of secession, Upon
which lu views are to numerous amd contra
dictory, that 'alt parties will find something to
be pleased with.
A. Sad Sell. Not having the privilege of

livery, we made arrangements with our more
iavored 'neighbors of Ai' Cohtlilulionli furnish
!with a sufficient number of copies to supply
'oursfubscribeti to-day. We engaged nothing
bat tho message; but the sheet furnished us
contains three columns of other matter and
offensive; matter at that, or at least presented
under an ouensive caption. We have no alter
native but to serve this offensive matter to our
readers, or withhold the message.
MISREPRESENTATION AND ITS
EFFECTS.
It has long been a subject of complaint with
the South, that the Abolitionists of tho North
persist in vilely misrepresenting the character
of the peculiar' domestic institutions in which
their interests are so deeply involved. But
rarely, no misrepresentation can be more un
just and more persistent than that which char
acterizes the Squth in its charges respecting
the principles and purposes of the Republican
party. Not to refer to the assertions of a reck
lesaand Irresponsible newspaper press, we have
been astonished at charges recently put forth
in grave official doenments, by the Executives
of Southern States, especially at a time like the
present In the message of Governor Ellis to
the Legislature of North Carolina, on the 20th
instant, for example, we find the charge, among
other assertions equally incorrect, that John
Brown's expedition " was deliberately planned
and set on foot by political societies and men
high In public confidence at the North, for the
purpose of creating an insurrection of slaves
against their masters." Now, can it be possi
ble that Governor Ellis is not aware that this
statement is false utterly false, every word and
syllable of it? Can it be possible, that in times
of excitement like the present, he has put this
atrocious libel before his people without being
aware that a Senate committee appointed for
the express purpose of connecting " political
societies and men high in public confidence at
the North " with this crazy raid, after an in
Yestigation of eight months, carried to the very
extent, if not beyond the bounds of law and
decency, and backed by all the power of the
Federal Government, failed utterly failed
confessedly aud ignominiously failed, to connect
a single individual " high " or low, in the public
confidence of the North, with that treasonable
affair, old John Brown and his handful of
white and black fanatics only excepted ? If
Governor Ellis is not aware of this, his igno
rance is as lamentable as his baseness would
otherwise be unpardonable. We will, in char
ity, trust he was not aware of the true facts of
the case; but it is a sad thing that just such
reckless charges as this have brought about
just the present excited state of feeling at the
South. The wildest assertions are made, and
not one syllable of refutation is permitted to
follow.
. The Supreme Court. The Supreme Court
met at noon yesterday, in their new Chamber.
-Chief Justice Taney and all the associate
judges, except Jndge Wayne, were present.
After the adjournment of the Court, the
members of the bar, practicing at that bar,
held a meeting relative to the death of Associ
ate Justice Daniel, which occurred during the
vacation.
The Court remained in session for only n
brief period; and afterwards the members paid
a visit to the White House, where they were
cordially greeted by the President.
From there they proceeded to the residence
of the Vice President; but he not being at
home1, they left their cards.
Disner to Colosel McCldbe. A compli
mentary banquet was given on Saturday eveu
ing, at the Continental Hotel, Philadelphia, to
Colonel A. K. McClure, chairman of the Peo
ple's State Central Committee of the recent State
and national campaign. The dinner was served
up in a very handsome style, in the ladies' or
dinary of the princely establishment. The head
table was arranged across the eastern end of the
spacious room, from which two tables extended
nearly the entire length of the apartment, so as
(to form a hollow square. On the eastern wall
Twero portraits of Abraham Lincoln, President
elect of the United States, and Andrew O. Car
tin, Governor elect of Pennsylvania. Speeches
were made by M. McMichael, Esq., Colonel A.
K. McClure, Hon. A. G. Curtin, Hon. William
D. Keller, and others.
The Constitution berates the Republicans
soundly for their incredulity, in not believing
that the Southern Democracy really intended
to rebel against the Government if fairly beaten
in the Presidential election. If we gave them
credit for more patriotism and less affinity for
treason than was their due, we are sorry they
hive taken it as an offence. We shall know
b'tter how to estimate them hereafter.
Coasx,Fouce. The South Carolina Legis
lature', on Monday last, passed a resolution in
structing the Committee on the Military to in
quire into the expediency of providing a coast
police for South Carolina ; and for that pur
puse, bow many vessels would be necessary,
and how they should be armed to afford pro
tection for the inlets and harbors of said coast.

After the reading of the Journal of yester

the vote, by which the homestead bill was re
ferred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union.
Mr. Phelps moved to lay tho bill on the table.
Mr. Grow was willing, if the gentleman from

The Clerk then proceeded to read the mes
sage of the President.
Pending which, our report closed.
Items Telegraphed from Washington.
We select the following items from quite a
number telegraphed from this city, principally
to the Northern press.
Washington Dec. 3. The most important
movement, it is said, originates with senator
Crittenden and one or two other conservative
members. Their exact plans are not known
in detail ; but the preliminary condition of them
is to have a caucus of the Southern members
and talk over the matter, state their grievances
and place them in a tangible shape, and make
a written proposition for their settlement. It
is then proposed to call a caucus of the North
ern members, who shall prepare another plan
for the equitable conciliation of the momentous
questions of the South. Finally, to compare
the two plans, and see if a united compromise
can be agreed upon, that will be satisfactory to
the South, particularly to the cotton and ex
treme Southern States.
John Cochrane, of New York, is said to have
a proposition to refer the portion of the mes
sage touching secession, in both Houses, with
out debate, to a committee of one from each
State, with instructions to report, in the course
of thirty days, an amendment to the Constitu
tion which will cover and settle all differences,
the members of the committee to be selected
by the delegations of the State represented. If
this proposition is accepted, time will be afford
ed for deliberation, and a little time for reflec
tion and Inendly conference will be a great
gain.
The South Carolina members are said to
scout all propositions for compromise, and arc
liktly to impair their influence with the border
States Dy tneir ultra position.
A number of prominent, non-political, influ
ential Southern planters and merchants, of the
higjbst respectability, arrived here on Satur
day morning, in accordance with a previous
arrangement amongst themselves, and called
upon the President: after which, a private cau
cus meeting was held in the parlors of tho
Union Club House, where an address was pre
pared, warmly endorsing the President. This
address is to be printed in the form of a peti
tion and sent to friends in all cf the Southern
States, after which they are to be sent to their
respective Representatives in Congress here,
who will be urged to sustain Mr. Buchanan ana
the Union. These gentlemen, who appear to
be quiet, unassuming, thoughtful men, repre
sent slave property to the amount of $4,000,000,
which, while in the Union, they believe it to be
comparatively sufe, while out of the Union they
contend there is no safety. The majority of
them left for their1 homes the same evening,
and hope to return in a few days with unmis
takable evidence of the predominance of the
conservative and Union sentiment of the South.
Systematic efforts have been made to con
voke meetings, and several conferences have
been held between the Republicans and South
cm leaders, and there is a strong prospect of a
satisfactory settlement of the difficulties on a
permanent basis.
Among the first business of tho session will
be the introduction in the Senate, by Senator
Douglas, of a bill making it a penal offence to
obstruct United States officers in executing the
fugitive slave law.
Washington, Dec. 3. The congratulations
among the members of the two Houses of Con
gross upon their assembling to-day were seem
ingly as cordial as heretofore. Many of them
had met to-day in their respective Chambers
for the first time this session.
The assurances from the members and others
from Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, that
these States will posititely follow the move
ment of South Carolina, have unmistakably
alarmed the conservatives, who, before coming
hither, were, they say, of the opinion that that
State only would venture upon secession,
t The Republican Senators held a caucus to
day, with reference to the formation of the
Btanding committees.
There is a consultation in progress to-night
among the members of several Congressional
delegations from the Southern States. Their
object seems to be to secure the co-operation
of the border elaveholding BUitcs in the seces
sion movement.
The Treasury Department to-day was en
abled to pay only about twenty-five per cent,
on the mileage due Congressmen.
The projected meeting of the Union mem
bers of the House and Senate, which was to
have taken place to night, has been indefinitely
Sostponed, at the request of Hon. Mr. Crittcn
en.
Some of the friends of Mr, Breckinridge
waited on him on Saturday, and tendered him
a serenade, which he declined.

MiUedgeviUe, Dee. 3, On motion 6f Mr. Holt,
of -Muscogee, a preamble) and resolutions sub
mitted by him were made the order for Tues
day, proposing a conference of all the Southern
States at Atlanta, on the 20th of February, to
counsel and advise as to the mode and manner
of resistance to be adopted under the existing
exigency. The prcambhj takes strong ground
in favor of having all sectional questions final
ly settled, and objects to separate State action.
TEXA8 LEGISLATURE.
New Orleans, Dec. 2. A committee of citi
zens of Texas have petitioned to Gov. Houston
to convene the Legislature. To this the Gov
ernor responded, that, viewing the proposed
measure as unwise, he could not Call the Legis
lature, but if a majority of the citizens of the
State petitioned for it, he would not stand in
their way. The secession feeling strongly
predominates.
THE LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
A Charleston letter of the 30th ult. says:
"The bill to provide a military force will
certainly pass this week.
" A resolution was introduced, declaring that
it is inexpedient to fill the vacancies in the
United States Senate from South Carolina. It
will bo adopted.
" The Legislature is preparing a large num
ber of bills in relation to free negreos, itinerant
salesmen, and trevflling agents.
" The police regulations of the State will be
made more stringent, and effective measures
are being perfected for the purpose of putting
the coast in a state of defence. In every way
preparation is going lorwaro, in oruer to no
fully prepared to back the Convention which
shall declare the State out of the Union.
" A Governor will be elected this week, per
haps on Wednesday. Among the names men
tioned in connection with the office is Hon. F.
W. Pickens. He addressed the Legislature on
Friday night, in the House hall, lie declared
for immediate action, and made a strong argu
ment in favor of the position assumed by the
State. He said the recent Bpeech of the Hon.
A. H. Stephens was calculated to mislead, and
declared that secession could be exercised
only by each State separately. If South Caro
lina went out, the other cotton States would
follow."
MESSAGE or TOE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
It is devoted to a review of the consequences
to the South of Lincoln's election, aud argues
at length the right of a State to secede, con
cluding as follows :
" Entertaining these views, Inmost earnestly
recommend a call of a Convention of the peo
ple of the State at an early day, to take such
action as in their judgment mav be necessary,
to protect and preserve the rights, honor, and
safety of the people of Florida. I would fur
ther recommend a revision of the militia laws,
with a view to a more effective organization of
the military, and an appropriation of $100,000
as a military fund for the ensuing year, to be
expended as fast as the public necessities may
require.
The Legislature promptly responded to the
recommendation of the Governor for the call
of a State Convention. It is to meet on tho 3d
of January.

A TRADE MEETING IK PENNSYLVANIA.
Pittsburg, Dec. 3. At the adjourned meet
ing of the cotton and woollen manufacturers on
Saturday, a resolution was adopted recom
mending the running of the mills upon half
time for the present. It was stated that over
production was as much the cause of the pres
ent heavy stock on band as the influence of
politics.
YIRE AT CHICAGO.

laundry of the Briggs House yesterday, and be
fore it could be subdued, considerably damaged
the building. The loss is about $10,000, but

THE JOHN BROWN MEETING AT UOSTON UEADED
OPT BY THE UNION MEN BROWN DENOUNCED,
AND IKS EXECUTION JUSTIFIED I
Boston, Dec. 3. The meeting called by the
ultra Republicans in commemoration of John
Brown, to take place here to-day, in Tremont
Temple, was headed off by tho Union men,
who took possession of the hall, chose Richard
Sullivan for their chairman, and then passed a
scries of resolutions denouncing Brown, and
justifying his execution, and lauding the course
of Virginia in the affair. Fred Douglas, Red
path. Frank Sanborn, and other well-known
abolitionists, vainly endeavored to be heard,
and much confusion ensued. Finally tho po
lice were called in, and the Temple was soon
cleared and closed by order of tho Mayor.
THE r-ERSONAL LIBERTY LAW IK VERMONT.
The final action of the Vermont Legislature,
1 eore its adjournment on th- 27 th ult., was to
refer the whole subject to the commissioners
on tho revision of the laws of tho State, with
instructions to .report whether he present law
upon the rendition of fugitive slaves is in con
met with the Constitution of tho United States.
The commissioners of revision, who are to take
the matter id charge, are cx-Judgos Milo L.
Bcnnet, Picrpont, and Isham, and Hon. An
drew Tracy, formerly member of Congress all
known to be men of strong conservative tend
encies. . VIEWS, A ErURUCAK GOVERNOR.,
Mr. Curtitf, tbejGqvernor olect'of Pennsyl
vania, made a speech in Philadelphia on Satur
day evening, during which he referred to the
nullifying laws of that State. The speaker
doubted whether any of her legislative enact
ments Interfered with the statutes of the Uni
ted States; but, if they did, the principle was
maintained that they should be immediately
repealed. While Pennsylvania thus yielded
to the National Government, she expected
every State, both North and South, to be as
faithlul as herself to constitutional obligations.
MILITARY: PREPARATIONS.
Great quantities of arms continue to be or
dered in the North by parties in the South. In
many of the. States the authorities are pScing
all tho important points on a war footing. In
all of the armories there is work enough for a
year. So great is the demand beyond the ca
pacity of labor, that Southern agents report it
impossible to have all their orders filled.
MR. CUSD1SO AND THE PALMETTO FLAG.
The Hon. Caleb Cushing says that whatever
may have, been done on board the James Gray
in regard to tho Palmetto flag, was done " with
out any orders, knowledge, or privity, on the
part either of my brothers or myself; and
that our first and only knowledge of the mat
ter at the time was derived from the telegraphic
statement as it appeared iu various shapes in
the newspapers of Boston."

out in the upper floor of old Tammany Hall,

ery thereof, the entire building would doubtless
have been destroyed. The firemen succeeded
in extinguishing the flames before they had

nated from a defect in a brick furnaco built
