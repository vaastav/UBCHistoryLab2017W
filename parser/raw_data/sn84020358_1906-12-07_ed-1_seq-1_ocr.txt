ANOTHER BAD WRECK
CttU.iS AT HIDED
SOUTHBOUND FREIGHT CRASHES
INIO LOCAL SWITCH til
AND CARS.
Practically a Head-On Collision
Switcher Attempting; to Cross Track
in the Yard When It is Hit William
II. Marvin, of New Haven, Engineer
of the Freight,' Dies of Injuries En
gineer of the Switcher Probnbly Fa
tally Injured Conductor Missing.
Meriden, Dec. 6. Probably the worst
railroad wreck that ever occurred in
this city happened shortly before 9
o'clock to-night in the freight yards.
South-bound freight No. 848 crashed
Into the local switcher and three box
cars that were endeavoring to cross
from the south-bound track to the
north-bound. It was practically a
head-on collision. William II. Martin,
of Lamberto'n street, New Haven, the
engineer on the freight, was terribly
scalded and died a few moments after
being found. George Veits, of Meriden,
engineer on the switcher, is in the Mer
iden hospital with a compound fracture
of the leg, an injured spine and inter
nal injuries. Small hopes for his re
covery are entertained.
William S. Jones, conductor of the
freight, is missing and is supposed to
be buried under the mass of wreckage,
twenty feet deep. A brakeman named
Matte, belonging in this city, was in
jured about the face and body, but not
seriously. Wreckers from New Haven
and Hartford are now clearing the
tracks.
Traffic was at a standstill for over
three hours and passengers were trans
ferred, walking through the scene of
the wreck.
The entire city force of physicians
and surgeons fend the ambulances were
called to the freight yards. The cab of
the down freight engine caught fire
soon after the crash came, and the fire
department was called. Dense fog is
given as the probable cause for the
wreck.
COMPROMISE IN SIGHT.
Ship Subsidy Bill Stands Chance of
Being: Passed.
Washington,' Dec. 6. Compromise on
the ship subsidy bill seems to be in
sight. At the meeting of the house
committee on merchant marine and
fisheries to-day Chairman Grosvenor
j suggested an amendment to the Gallin
k I frer bill which will limit subsidies to
the South American and Oriental trade.
The suggestion was well received, al
1 though no vote was taken, and Mr.
f Grosvenor is now engaged in prepar
fl 'ing amendments for the committee's
c 'consideration.
The amended bill will be in harmony
ti. Hvith Secretary Root's policy for the ex-
w 'tension of trade, as outlined in recent
a speeches in the west,
h Representative Watson, of Indiana,
the republican whip, expressed the
oipinion that the committee can get a
favorable report on a bill limiting the
subsidies to Latin-American and Ori
ental lines. He also said he had can
vassed the house and is confident such
a measure will pass.

For several hours the attorneys for

his story. The attorneys attempted to
show that Schultz had entered & plea Pattern mountain gun at ranges of 2,000

Adopted Mr. Culberson Also Secures
Amendment to Resolutions Asking
Specifically for Order to Commander

the Soldiers Demanded.
Washington, Dec. 6. The senate to
day adopted the Penrose resolution re
quiring the president to send in infor
mation regarding the discharge of the
negro t romps of the Twenty-fifth in
fantry, and also the Foraker resolu
tion directing the seeretaary of war to
transmit all information in the pas-
session of his department on the inline
subject. Both resolutions carry an
identical amendment by Mr. Culberson
asking specifically for the order to
Major Penrose, commanding the
j frooPs whk'h directed him not to turn
over to the Texas autlvritieu certain
of the troops demanded. This action
followed a debate of two hours, and
was taken without a roll call or oppos
ing vote. The debate developed along
two distinct lines, one as to the pro
priety of asking t ho president for the
information t of directing the secre
tary of war to furnish it, and the
other an indulgence by a few senators
in comment on the merits of the eai-:e.
Mr. Pipooner took the ground that in
matters where congress had an abso
lute right to information in the pas
sosolon of the executive it had always
been customary to direct a cabinet of
ficer to furnish it. In matters where
it had not this right and in which
there was some doubt about the advis
ability of publicity, congress usually
made a request upon the president, if
it desired the information, with the
understaning that It shoul be furnl'she
"if not Incompatible with the 'public
interest." This view was supported
also by Mr. Foraker, while Mr. Lodge
quoted precedents to the contrary.
To lay the foundation for a discus
sion of this poirrt, Mr. Carter observ
ed that "It had been alleged and not
denied" that the troops In question
ha committed murder in Texas. This
brought Mr. Foraker to his feet with
an emphatic disclaimer. The allega
tion had been denied, he said, and

vote of 110 to 164 to-day defeated the
bill of Representative Littlefield of

Hartfoijd, Dee. 6. Frank T. Han.
cock, who was the janitor of the New
Haven postofllee, was acquitted to-day
of the charge of theft of letters from
the mails in that city,' the jury in the
United States court being out but flf
teen minutes. The trial of the aged
janitor attracted considerable attention
during the last two days on account
of the large number of witnesses who
appeared at the trial to testify to the
good character of the Reused man,
When the Jury announced its verdict
Hancock, who lives ln Meriden, was
congratulated by former Governor
Chamberlain and other well-known
citizens, who followed the trial with
interest.
Hancock was arrested after several
attempts had been made to find the
person or persons supposed to have
been responsible for .the number of
thefts of letters of value from the New
Haven postofllee. When taken into
custody he had in his possession a box
containing several unopened letters,
and claimed that he found them on the
floor and was taking the letters with
other scrap paper to the waste pile in
the cellar.
His attorney, Jacob P. Goodhart, of
New Haven, in summing up the case
to-day, said that "there was a thief In
the New Haven postofllee, and that
Hancock was not the man, but the
scapegoat." He Intimated that the let
ters which the defendant picked up
were put there to shield the real crim
inal and to throw the blame on Han
cock.
Hancock as a witness made a good
impression on the stand and told a
straightforward story, finishing lils tes
timony during the morning session of
the court to-day. Other witnesses to
day were former Governor Chamber
lain and Bernard E. Farrell, of New
Haven, a clerk in the postofllee. Far
rell yesterday said that he saw Han
cock take the letters, and to-day ad
hered to his original story. The argu
ments, which were begun at noon, last
ed until well along Into the afternoon.

BRYAH CRIES SHA1E
ACAINST THE PRESIDENT
ASSAILS TIIE WARLIKE TONE OI
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S
MESSAGE.
Not Rljjht That the Army and Navy,
the Instrument of Brute Force,
Should be Placed Above the Nation's
Sense of Justice as the Guarantor of
Peace Doctrines Which the Demo
crats Have B?en Advocating; Boldly
Appropriated Some Things That Arc
Good.
Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 6. Commenting
on President Roosevelt's message, W.
J. Bryan said there wai3 much that
was good and much that was bad in
it, but it may be regarded as the
president's most important state pa-pe-.
:
Mr. Bryan said: "The message con
tains much that is democratic and for
which the general public may well
thank him. It contains something that
v.us'ht to arouse isevere criticisms. The
president boldly appropriates doctrines
which tho democrats have been ad
vocating and on the other hand, he
announces some doctrines which are
so absurd as to excite amusement if
tho suggestions came from .a less
prominent source. In some cases he
takes advanced ground, In some case's
ho retreats from ground already tak
en." Mr. Bryan complains that what the
president say.s on government by in
junction will not bo satisfactory to the
laboring men or to these who respect
the right of trial by Jury. The presi
dent's stand on child labor, the eight
hour law and the risht of the people
to criticize a judge is commended.'
On President Roosevelt's reference to
the Japanese question, Mr. Bryan
says:
"He pays a deserved tribute to the
progress of the Japanese nation, and
asks for legislation which will enable
congress to protect the treaty rights of
foreigners. That there should be such
legislation cannot be generally disput
ed, but a great deal depends upon the
character of the legislation. If any
bills are presented in regard to this
suggestion they must be carefully sera
tinlzed, lest they deny to the states the
right to protect themselves and their
people ln matters purely local."
..Finally, Mr. Bryan, deplores what he
calls the presilent's warlike attitude
He says: "There will be general dis
appointment of the warlike tone of his
message, where he discusses the army
and navy. He speaks of the navy as
tho surest guarantor of peace which
this country possesses. 'Shame on the
chief executive that he should place an
Instrument of brute force above the na
tion's sense of justice as a guarantor
of peace, The best guarantor of peace
