Congress convened today, with very
few of the startling incidents which
so often mark the opening of the two
great National bodies. No flowers were
permitted and everybody was glad.
The opening session was purely pro
forma, as most of Congressional action
Is getting to be, because everything
had been arranged beforehand, and the
rails had been greased, so to speak.
? ? *
The caucuses of the Republicans and
Democrats were held on Saturday ev
ening and the slates fixed up. Nobody
else had a ghost of a show except the
caucus nominees, of course. There
?were no insurgents, so there could be
no kicker?. .Representative Mann, of
Illinois, called the Republicans to order
and nominated Representative "Pete"
Hepburn, of Iowa, to his old place as
Caucus Chairman. This had l?een un
derstood. also, and Mr. Hepburn, with
out showing any trepidation at the
honor thrust upon him, assumed con
trol of the caucus and said:
"The principal purpose of our meet
ing is to name a gentleman for whom
the Republicans of the House of Rep
resentatives of the 59th Congress shall
vote as their candidate for Speaker.
But It is probable that the Republi
cans of the country have anticipated
us in this matter. So far as the pub
lic prints have advised me, or any of
the conversations I have had with the
members of this House, there has not
been a name suggested for this office
other than one we all know. The nom
ination has been made, and it is up to
us to say if we shall ratify it.
"I would pause for & moment in or
der that any gentleman might name
some other candidate than the man in
the minds of the great multitude of
Republicans. If there is no gentleman
desirous of so doing, I shall proceed
to put the motion, that the Hon. Jo
seph G. Cannon, a Representative
elect from the State of Illinois, be
named as a candidate to be voted for
by the Republican members of the
House of Representatives of the 59th
Congress."
? ? ?
This speech was received with
cheers, and Messrs. Payne, Boutell, and
Curtis were appointed a committee to
notify Mr. Cannon of the caucus ac
tion. As Mr. Cannon entered he was
tumultuously greeted, the members
standing until he had ascended his
former throne. Mr. Cannon's speech
of acceptance was in part as follows:
"Gentlemen: One year ago, after
full consideration, the people, under
the lead of the Republican Party,
elected its candidates for President and
Vice President, continued a strong Re
publican majority in the Senate, and
gave a Republican majority in the
House of Representatives of 112. The
Congress will be organized on Monday
next and will promptly receive the an
nual message from the President. I
will not speculate as to what may be
the contents of the message. I have
no doubt it will be both wise and pat
riotic in its recommendations.
"You. the Republican Representa
tives in caucus assembled, have unani
mously chosen me as your candidate
for Speaker of the House. This action !
touches me profoundly. I would be !
less than human if this action, taken j
after service for one Congress, was not
a matter of great gratification. And
yet, I do not misunderstand your ac
tion. It would have been impossible
were it not that you believe my action
as presiding officer will, in so far as I
have ability. be fair to the whole mem
bership of the House, both to the party
of the majority and the party of the
minority, in the transaction of the bus
iness of the House."
? * ?
Mr. Cannon then said that he be
lieved that he had been selected be
cause the Republicans in the House
believed that he would be true to the
party and its principles. He declared
the man would be bold indeed who de
parted from them one iota, or who
would try to do anything to injure the
prosperity of the country by injudi
cious legislation. He then hastily
sketched the progress of the country
rince 1861:
? ? ?
"8Ince 1861, when our party came
Into power, the history of the Repub
lican Party has been substantially the
history of the country. Our popula
tion has more than doubled, and our
wealth has been multiplied by five;
11 States have been admitted to the
Union; we have today almost one
half of the world's railways; the pro
duct of our labor more than equals
one-third of the product of the labor
of all the civilized world; by Invention
and enterprise, aided by the use of our
great capital, we have harnessed the
forces of nature and made them our
servants,. until individual effort today
accomplishes for the benefit of all the
people many times more than It did in
the early days of the Republic. Since
William McKinley took the oath of
office, in 1897, the expenditures and
revenues of the postal service have I
been nearly multiplied by two. This is
the best measure of the industry, pro
duction, business, and commerce of our
people.
* ? ?
"The changes in the methods of pro
duction and commerce, so salutary
and beneficial, involving as they do the
extraordinary use of combined capital,
emphasizes the necessity for prevent
ing agreements in restraint of trade
and the regulation of commerce among
the States and with foreign Nations.
"The consensus of opinion of the
people, however, is that Congress has!
the power by amendment to the law j
to provide better remedies for real
abuses existing, so that the producer
and consumer can find a more speedy
and loss expensive remedy than we
now have. In this opinion I, for one,
concur. The burden is upon Congress,
and our party, having power, is pri
marily responsible.
"Let us go forward. But It is our
duty to s"e that legislation is wise in
the premises, just to the corporation,
the carrier, and to the people. We
cannot oppress one by foolish or un
just legislation without in the end
bringing disaster upon all."
? ? ?
The old rules of the House were
adopted, and the election of the other
officers was assured by placing in nom
ination all the old officers of the
House.
? ? ?
The Democrats in their caucus nom
inated John Sharp Williams (Miss.)
for Speaker, and this constitutes him
the floor manager for the Democrats
during the 59th Congress.
* ? ?
But Mr. Speaker-to-be Cannon says
"no more of this," and so there will
not be. For this relief much thanks.
? ? ?
Congress convened and glory be,
there were no flowers, nary fllower,
mind you. except the McKinley carna
tion which Gen. Grosveror and a few
of his confreres wear. The Senate
passed a resolution that no more flow
ers would be permitted to litter up the
lobbies and desks of the Senate Cham
ber, but the House lagged behind in
this respect. Mr. Speaker Cannon has
come forward with a pronunciamento,
however. He says, emphatically, that
there will be no more flowers permit
tod inside the hall of the House on
opening day. and that settles It, as the
Speaker Is Czar.
? ? ?
This is a reform that should have
been Instituted long, long ago. For
tunes have been spent in flowers for
the opening of a Congress?one single
Congress. It has not been unusual to
fee huge floral pieces brought Into the
House with two or more men stagger*
under the weight of the ponderous
tffairs which coot op la the hundreds
of dollars. Tammany used to be the
greatest sinner in this respect. The
Tammany Braves used to send floral
pieces to their own particular Con
gressmen that were boorishly coarse
and inartistic in their reeking sug
gestions of costliness. Orchids that
cost 150 the blossom. Roses at $25 a
dozen. Violets at $10 a thousand, and
all that sort of thing. Poor girls who
had a $500 position in the Government
Printing Office, scrub women who had
a dollar a day. struggling young clerks
with big families and small salaries,
each and all felt that they must show
"regard" for their "Inflooence," and
would spend $10 on a bunch of flowers
and go hungry and cold for a week to
pay for it. Society women would show
er "flowery fgvors on members of Con
gress whom they hoped to rope into
"paying" card parties; and so it went.
By the time the roses and carnations,
the tube roses and decaying violets,
the lilies-of-the-valley and heliotrope
had been piled about the desks of fa
vored members like funeral pieces
around the "deceased." and the per
fumes of the flowers had mixed with
the* aroma of stogies, old pipes, cigar
ets. stale tobacco sputem, and silk
di esses soaked full of effete, or one
might say "fetid," sachet odors, the air
in the House and Senate was like noth
ing so much as an abattoir on a hot
August day.
? ? ?
Washington has a distinguished
guest?maybe a Prince of his country,
but we can't be sure?who is almost
unable to give any account of himself.
He is big, oh, he is superb of stature,
broad of girth, magnificent of presence,
and is enriched with gold enough to
run the Government for a day, when
he gets on the uniform that covers that
immense frame of his. But?oh, dear,
isn't it awful? He's an Abyssinian,
don't you know? Black as the ace of
spades?yes, he is even blacker. He
is so black that he might have been
shined with shoepolish. Ai Hadji
seems to be his name, but as he speaks
only a little French, some Arabic, and
mostly Abvssfnian, he doesn't find
many Interpreters round in this neck
of the woods. He is a merchant prince,
and brought to President Roosevelt a
letter from King Menelik, written in
Abyssinian, so the President had at
first not the slightest idea what that
letter contained, but took it on trust.
AI Hadji brought a present to the
President?two huge elephant's tusks
of the finest and whitest ivory, the
largest and most perfect ever brought
to this country, lie is said to be the
richest man in Abyssinia, and is a
maker of fire-arms, and furnishes the
military equipment for King Menelik's
army. He is a sight.
? ? ?
Yes, sir. the Rough Riders are do
ing pretty well, thank you. The Pres
ident has promised to appoint John R.
Abernathy. of Frederick, Oklahoma
Territory, United States Marshal down
there when there is a vacancy.
? ? ?
It is said that Senator Alger, of
Michigan, has decided that he will
again ?>e a candidate for the United
States Senate. He decided a few months
ago, and announced the fact that ill
health would keep him from ever
again entering public iife.
* ? ?
Gov. Otero, of New Mexico, has been
turned down for the coveted third
term, and Herbert J. Hagerman has
been appointed by the President to
succeed him and will step into Gov.
Otero's shoes Jan. 1. 1906. Gov. Otero's
administration is said to have been per
fectly acceptable to the President, but
such strong opposition has developed
in Xew Mexico, due, it Is said, to the
fight on him because he failed to make
certain appointments, that the Presi
dent was almost forced to appoint
some one else.
? e ?
The President has appointed D. C.
O'Connor Superintendent of Public
Instruction for the Panama Zone, at
$2,300 a year. Prof. O'Connor is Sup
erintendent of Schools in Norfolk, Neb.
His appointment was urged by Sena
tor E. J. Burkett.
Charles E. Magoon, Governor of the
Canal Zone, has informed the War De
partment that there are 1,93< children
along the line of the Panama Railroad,
and says 935 of them cannot read or
write. He recommends the establish
ment of 42 schools In the Zone, with 50
pupils to each teacher.
Prof. O'Connor has been instructed
to go to the Zone at once.

This from the Director of the Mint Is
interesting.
The Director announces that all sil
ver bullion purchased under the act of
1878 and 1890 is now gone, the ac
counts with it closed, and coinage of the
silver dollar is at an end unless in the
future new legislation upon the subject
is passed. He says. In part:
"The total issue of silver dollars
from 1793 to the cessation of dollar
coinage has been $578,303,848. The ag
gregate of all seigniorage of coinage
under the acts of 1878 and 1890 was
$134,164,986. The average purchase
price of silver bought in the fiscal year
1878 was $1,204 per fine ounee, and the
average price in the last year pur
chases were made, the fiscal year 1904,
was 73.1 cents per ounce. The bullion
value of a silver dollar In 1878 was
93.1 cents and in 1894 56.5 cents.
"The stock of gold in the world on
January 1, 1905, In use as money is es
timated in round numbers as $6,000,
000,000. The amount actually in sight
in reporting hanks and Government
Treasuries was $3,364,600,000."

Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio, wants a
ship subsidy bill, arid he is going to
work for it might and main.
? ? #
This means?what?
United support of the Monroe Doc
trine by all the Nations of South Amer
ica will be urged by Secretary Root,
who it Is announced, will visit several
countries of South America, particu
larly Brazil.
This announcement is made on the
authority that a third Pan-American
Congress will be held shortly at the
Brazilian Capital, and the Secretary's
trip will be ostensibly to attend and
take a prominent part in that gather
ing.
This important step, which will be a
precedent In the annals of the Secre
taries of State, is said to be the prin
cipal feature of a program that has
been decided upon between the Presi
dent and Mr. Root toward bringing all
the countries of America Into closer
diplomatic relations and establishing a
better understanding between them and
the powers of Europe.
? ? ?
In this connection, it Is rumored that
the secret mission of Judge Penfield to
Brazil and other South American coun
tries was not to watch German colon
isation, nor to look into the commer
cial conditions with a view to estab
lishing better consular relations be
tween this country and the Southern
Republics, but to feel the pulse of those
Governments as to whether the time
Is ripe for such a move as is reported
to be contemplated by the President,
through his Secretary of State. The'
time is ripe, Is the verdict the Judge Is
said to have rendered upon his arrival
in Washington a few days ago.

Nothing but a game of chess?this
'Kingdom" business. Today there is a
Monarchy, an Empire, a Republic, and
tomorrow any one of these may have
drawn a blank, and be wiped out, to
be known no more except In legend
and tradition. That's what has hap
pened to the tiny "Hermit Kingdom."
Yesterday?last year, there was an Km
peror of Korea?it vm an Kmperor,
was it not? He had Ministers to Ens
land and France and the United States
and a few other places, and was going
along all right. Korea was quiet and
Inoffensive, with a hundred or so men
in its national army, and a converted
yacht which it called a "Navy," and it
paid its bills, and asked no odds of any
body. That was yesterday.
? ? ?
Today the Korean Emperor wears a
puppet crown, the legations are abol
ished, and Japan is in control. Korea
kicked like a "bay steer," but, la, what
good did that do? The Russian-Jap
anese war changed the map of Asia and
this little Kingdom, just about as big
sis Kansas, with eight times the popu
lation of the Sunflower State and a his
tory which goes back to 1120 B. C.,
was part of the spoils which Japan got
for pounding the stuffing out of the big
Russian bear. There was a little Kor
ean Prince, son of the Emperor, who
traces his dynasty back through more
than 500 years, who came over to the
United States to study how to be
learned, and to get a military training,
that when he grew up he might be the
Cist of his dynasty and rule his people
even better than his father, who is the
SOth of his House to sit on the throne
of Korea. The little Prince was a
high-flyer, he certainly was, and he
just raised particular cain in every
school where they "incarcerated" him.
He kept the Korean Legation here in
hot water all the time, ran away and
got lost down South somewhere, came
mighty near marrying a fool American
girl who thought she saw a throne in
sight, and learned about everything
but how to grow up great and good.
The poor little chap might just about
as well had his fling, for now his throne
is gone, and he is poor. But, then?
Japan has swiped Korea two or three
times before and had to let go, so may
be the little Prince will live to sit on
his throne yet.
? ? e
Secretary Root has informed the
Japanese Government through Minis
ter Takahira, that hereafter he will
conduct the affairs relating to Korea
through the Japanese Legation. The
action was taken upon the receipt by
the State Department of official infor
mation from Japan that that Govern
ment had established a protectorate
over Korea and that in the future di
plomatic business of Korea would be
conducted from Tokio. The useless
nes3 of an American Mission at Seoul
was at once made apparent, and Mr.
Morgan, our Minister there, has been
informed that his work in Korea Is
over. He will undoubtedly get some
other post, as his services at Seoul have
been efficient and valuable to this Gov
ernment.
? ? ?
The treaty of amity and commerce
between the United States and Korea
will not be affected. The consular
officers in Korea will remain where
they are.
The abolishment of the Legation at
Seoul will save the State Department
$10,000 or more a year. Mr. Morgan's
salary alone is $7,.r>00. The Legation
staff at Seoul consists of Mr. Morgan,
G. Paddock of New York, Secretary of
Legation, and Consul-General, Capt.
Andre W. Brewster, military attache,
and one native interpreter. Capt.
Brewster is also accredited to the Le
gation at Pekin as military attache.

It is said that the business methods
of the General Land Office and Its
branches are of the most antiquated
kind, and that the chief alni In that
section of the Department of the Inter
ior seems to be to swell the coffers of
extortionate express companies. It is
said that the books are of the compli
cated kind and that half the funds
taken in by the Receiver of a Land
Office are never registered, and that
unless the funds are specifically called
for, the Receiver is just that much
better off. Just now this matter Is be
ing looked into and some kind of re
form wiii be instituted. Instead of us
ing the mails, the Land Offices in the
Great West send checks by express. It
is said that In one small Land Office
over $300 was paid in one year just to
express checks which might have been
carried for $3, by using the mails and
a two cent stamp for each. Graft,
graft, graft!

O, my, oh! They really and truly say
that Paul Revere was a dentist. Think
of it, a dentist, albeit a good one, pre
sumably, for that day; but one look at
the false teeth that Washington wore,
and which are deposited at Mt. Vernon,
is quite enough. They might have been
blocked out for a cow, don't you know,
and sawed down to fit Washington's
mouth. It wasn't a little mouth,
either, that the Father of his Country
had.

N. H. Darton, of the Division of Min
eral Resources of the United States
Geological Survey, has just returned
from a season's work in the wilds of
the Big Horn Mountains, Wyo., where
he went on a mission for the Govern
ment. It appears that early next July
President Roosevelt will open one-half
of the Shoshone Indian Reservation to
settlement, and it was with a view to
ascertaining the exact state of the land
In regard to minerals that Mr. Darton
was sent to Wyoming.
Of the mineral prospects, he says
that in the Bridger Range, not far from
the scene of his labors, copper and gold
have been encountered in paying quan
tities and considerable excitement pre
vails. As for the northern part of the
Shoshone Reservation, which he ex
amined thoroughly, he failed to find
the slightest trace of any metal worth
the trouble of mining. A notion had
prevailed that this tract was rich in
minerals, but if such is the case, Mr.
Darton states, it is certainly not re
vealed in any of the surface formations.
The Shoshone Indians, he said* are
not at all concerned over the fact that
part of their reservation is to be opened
to settlement, as they have never oc
cupied this area, worth speaking of,
but have from first to last lived hud
dled together, in true Indian fashion, In
the southern half of the tract.

Reform In the Departments here in
Washington seems about to begin at
the wrong end. Instead of beginning
with men and women who are paid big
salaries for doing work that in busi
ness life would command hundreds
where thousands are given by the Gov
ernment, the beginning of economy is
to be at the bottom round where wom
en are simply keeping soul and body
together counting old money. It is one
of the nastiest Jobs under the Govern
ment. A scrub woman has a cinch
compared with these women who count
money. The scrub woman can at least
have clean water, good soap, and if she
likes a disinfectant. But these coun
ter* of wornout currency! My, my! The
stuff comes in by the wagon load. It
reeks of tobacco, of foul odors of every
kind, and is filthy with dirt, bacteria,
disease of any and all kinds; yet these
women, who are experts in every sense
of the word, and when one dies, the
Government feels itself personally
aggrieved and has to hustle like the
mischief to replace the piece of worn
out machinery?these women are to
have their wages of $600, $700, $930
cut a few dollars. They are responsi
ble fqr the vile rags, yclpt "money,"
which they handle, and if a dollar of
the ragged stuff is unaccounted for af
ter it goes into their hands to he sort
ed. counted and "baled" they have to
replace it out of their own slender
purses; indeed they do. And be It said
to the credit of women, that not once
In a decade is any money lost, and
then no very great sum, never above a
few dollars.

As a matter of fact, it Is said that
the Keep Commission, which Is stilt
pegging away on its business of finding
graft, and ways to kill It In the De
partments, Is traveling a rocky road.
Up among the ornamental offices It

seems equally hard to cut off extrava
gance In expenditures, because every
body has a pull and somebody Is llkcty
to g%t "hurt," and so It goes. But these

poor counters of nasty, dirty, flltliy
money.?they have no pull, and so their
salaries will be cut.

belongs to that Republic by right of
law, and It only remains for the United
States to ratify the pending treaty be

Capt. Brian also retains his position.

In reply to the question whether the

Stlllings said:
"It is an open shop now. If it were
otherwise the Government Printing

which have gone forth saying that I am
against the Unions are false. The
Lnions have done much to elevate the

a benefit; when they use it wrong they
are a menace. If I were a Journeyman

working in the office. The men em
ployed here should be the best obtain
able, and that shall be my rule. The

fit* at 10 o'clock President and Mr?.
Roosevelt, Theodore, Jr., Edith and
Archie got on a special car on the
Southern Railroad, and off they ? went
for "Plain-Dealing," Mrs. Roosevelt's
farm of 15 acres, down In Virginia. Two
cooks from the White House went down
on Wednesday with the big Rhode
Island turkey and all the concomitants
of a turkey dinner, and the President's
valet went with the family to take carej
of the traps. Mrs. Roosevelt, In plain
walking attire, tucked up her sleeves
and bossed the business of getting that
Thanksgiving dinner on the table, and
"they" do say it was a crackin' good
dinner, too, albeit It was served with
little or no company.
? ? ?
"Plain-Dealing" is a pretty little
"wood-lot" six miles from the railroad,
in Albemarle County, Va., right in the
heart of the timber and hills, pretty
well removed from neighbors. It is a
pretty little cottage of a story and a
half, painted a light brown with darker
brown trimmings, and has bright-green
shutters. It Is surrounded on three
sides by a porch. In fact, the porch is
a good deal bigger than the house. ItI
is furnished in the very simplest man- j
ner imaginable, and the President and
Mrs. Roosevelt go there just to get rid
of folks. It is only an hour's ride from
Washington, and when the President is
tired out he goes there for a day, to
tramp through the woods. Of course,
as they do not keep an establishment
there, they cannot have their horses
there just for a day, so the tramp is the
only exercise they can get, but the
Roosevelts are all fond of tramping.
? ? ?
Theodore, Jr., Is getting along all
right, his broken nose having behaved
itself very well. He has returned to
Harvard. Miss Alice got home from
her grandmother's In time to have gone
with the family to Plain-Dealing, but she
is still a little ailing, and it was thought
best for her not to go. Baby Quentin,
who really Isn't so much of a baby after
all, being about seven years old now?
was also left behind with his governess.
It was thought the day would be too
strenuous for his little legs, as he Is
pretty short for his years, and a long
tramp would do him up. They dined
with Commander "and Mrs. Cowles. The
Presidential party returned to the White
House Friday evening, much refreshed,
and the President had his own fun with
the correspondents, who were disposed
to think they had been pretty shabbily
treated.

And now It Is Senator Patterson. He
of Colorado, don't you know. He owns
two newspapers, and It Is because of
cartoons and editorials in these news
papers that he was tried before the
Supreme Court of Colorado, and was
adjudged guilty of contempt of the Colo
rado law in so printing things. He was
fined $1,000, and committed to Jail un
til the fine was paid. Subsequently the
Court ordered a stay of execution for
60 days pending an appeal by Senator
Patterson to the United States Supreme
Court.
? ? ?
Senator Patterson declared emphat
ically at first that he would go to jail
rather than pay the fine Imposed. His
attorneys also Informed the Court that
Senator Patterson would exercise con
stitutional right as a United States Sen
ator to claim exemption from arrest
while Congress was In session, and
thereby have set aside the judgment of
the Court so that he might be enabled
to be present when Congress convened
this week. Further discussion followed,
however, and the Senator then told the
Court that if a stay of execution was
issued he would hasten an appeal to the
Supreme Court of the United States, and
if that body refused to take cognizance
of his case or decided the case against
him, he would pay the fine Immediately.
The Court agreed to this.

Representative "Pat" Murphy, a
Republican who represents the 16 th

the "Ozask" District, if you please,
promised a Mrs. McCready, the mother
of a big family of Republican voters
of the Ozark region, that if he was
elected he would wear to Washington
a suit of Missouri "Homespun," if
she would spin and weave the cloth,
cut and make the suit. Pat was elect
ed, sure. Mrs. McCready also made
good. She spun the cloth, which is
real "butternut," don't you know, and
she cut and made the clothes, and?
well, you just ought to see them, and
him! For be wore the clothes to
Washington, and they are fine enough
for anybody, and Mrs. McCready's ge
nius ought to be emulated by other
w omen.

Representative Longworth, of Ohio,
Is going to begin at the right end of
the tangle. He does not want to In
crease Consul. Ministerial or Embas
sadorial salaries, but he is going to
introduce a bill to buy residences for
all of our foreign representatives. That
is exactly what should be done. The
United States has been niggardly In
this respect, and yet It costs us tre
mendously to pay so much rent. If
residences were purchased outright,
then a man of moderate means might
aspire to some of the higher positions
abroad. As it is a man must be a mul
timillionaire to accept the office of
Embassador to the Court of St. James,
for Instance, where the house rent
costs nearly twice the yearly salary.

Secretary of War Taft sums up the
conditions in the Canal Zone after this
fashion:
"By December 1, 1905, we shall have
spent $60,000,000 in the course of ac
quiring a transcontinental canal.
"The $10,000,000 appropriation for
preliminary work has been exhausted.
"The pay roll at present amounts to
about $600,000 a month. It contains
13,000 names.
"Efficient labor is difficult to obtain,
and it may be necessary to employ
Asiatics. Another year will determine.
The wisdom of applying the eight-hour
law is doubted.
"The present problem Is one of trans
portation rather than excavation.
"Former Engineer Wallace's exper
iment in excavation, costing over $500,
000, has been abandoned by Shonts and
Stevens, though the experiment has
reduced to that extent the ^amount of
work to be done."

GEN. MEACHAM DEAD.
Iatermeat of Dlatiafaliiked Vetera* la
Arlington?Fine Military Record.

ffaataatloaa.
While It was not unexpected, the death
of Gen. John F. Meacham, so long and
so favorably known among patriotic
organizations all over the country, but
more particularly in Washington, was
a distinct shock to his many friends.
The end came in the early hours of
the morning, Friday, Nov. 24, and the
charters of many veteran organizations
in the District of Columbia were
draped in mourning in consequence.
Gen. Meacham came to Washington
from Indiana In 1892, entering the
employ of the Government in the
Treasury Department, where he re
mained until his death. He was born
in Rockville, Ind., July 17, 1844, and
was but a youth of 17 when the civil
war was commenced, but he enlisted
Immediately, and served until the
very last, being mustered out Dec. 8,
1S65. He served in the 31st Ind., en
tering as a private and being mus
tered out as Adjutant of the regiment. <
The 31st Ind. is designated as one of
tho "fighting" regiments. It was with
Grant at Fort Donelson, losing nine
killed and 52 wounded, and also at
Fort Henry, Perryville and the bat
tle of Franklin. At Shiloh it lost 21
killed and 114 wounded. It was in
the Stone River and Chickamauga
campaigns, and in the Atlanta cam
paign it did splendid service. After
the evacuation of Atlanta it accom
panied the Fourth Corps in its pursuit
of Hood, fighting again at Nashville.
After the war closed, the 81st Ind.,
Gen. Meacham, Adjutant of the regi
ment, with the Fourth Corps, was
moved to Texas, in view of the possi
ble complications with Maxmillian's
Empire. But this collapsed without
the regiment being called upon to ren
der any military service. The regi
ment yras mustered out Dec. 8, 1865,
at Victoria, Texas. Out of a total en
rollment of 1,562, 258 were captured
and in Confederate prisons, and alto
gether the total loss of killed and
wounded was 4S2.
Gen. Meacham was among the earli
est workers in the Grand Army of the
Republic, and was a charter member
of Steele Post, of Rockville, Ind., serv
ing for nine successive years as its
Commander, and might have served
longer had he not removed to Wash
ington, where he became a charter
member of George H. Thomas Post.
He served this Post one term as Com
mander, had been often on the staff
of Department Commanders and of the

He was Colonel of Logan Command,
U. V. U., for two terms, and later
General Commanding: the District of
Columbia Division, U. V. U.. for two
terms. As a soldier Gen. Meacham
was noted for gallantry in action and
loyalty to his superior officer*. He
was a gentle, considerate man. Arm
in principles, but most genial aud
companionable, and In his bitterest
fights for his principles never made a
lasting enemy.
Gen. Meacham leaves an interesting
family of six daughters and two sons,
all of whom are proud of their father's
achievements, and a widow, Mrs. Ros
amond B. Meacham, who has been his
gentle lieutenant through all the vicis
situdes of the years. While he was
winning honors in Grand Army cir
cles she was keeping pace with him in
the auxiliary to that organization, and
became President of the Department
of the Potomac, Woman's Relief Corps,
a promotion which gave Gen. Meach
am much pleasure, as he fielped to or

which Mrs. Meacham was a charter
member and its first President.
Gen, Meacham's remains were laid
to rest in Arlington, and the flag*

upon it. These came from different

All About Pensions.
The "Age" Order.
The laws of June 27, 1896, and May
9, 1900, provided for a pension, accord
ing to degree of disability, from $6 to
$12 per month for any soldier of the
War of the Rebellion who served 90
days and was honorably discharged.
The new "AGE" Order simply says
that any claimant who has arrived at
the age of 62, or 65, or 68, or 70 is
presumed without further proof (and,
inferentially, without examination) to
be suffering disability sufficient to war
rant $6 a month pension at age of 62;
$8 a month at age of 65; $10 a month
at age of 68, and $12 a month at age
of 70'
To Those Who Have Never Ap
plied for Pension.
We urge upon these comrades that
it is their duty to apply. If many are
so well-to-do that they do not need it,
they can apply the money to help those
who do need it. Under the "AGE"
Order an application can be made that,
in most cases, does not involve exam
ination. which probably removes a fea
ture that was objectionable to many.
Write to R. W. Shoppell, or The Xa
tlonal Tribune* Washington, D. C., and
a proper blank will be mailed you with
out cost.
To General Law Pensioners Drawing Less
Than 912.
If under the law of June 27, 1890, as
construed by the New "AGE" Order,
which is given elsewhere, a pensioner
will receive an increase, he should
write to R. W. Shoppell, or The Na
tional Tribune, Washington, D. C., and
a proper blank will be mailed him
without cost.
To Pensioners Under the Act of June 27,
1880, Who Are Receiving Less Than
?12 Per Month.
Read very carefully the new "AGE"
Order given In another column. If it
allows you more pension than you are
now receiving, write to R. W. Shoppell,
or The National Tribune, Washington,
D. C., and a proper blank will be mailed
you without cost.
To Those Wlshlac to Allesre More Dis
ability Than Is Proscribed by the
?A*e" Order.
Under the "Age" Order it is assumed,
if the contrary does not appear, and a'
other legal requirements are proper 1
met, that a claimant is half disabk
for manual labor at the age of 62; two
thirds disabled at the age of <6; live
sixths at the age of 68, and wholly
disabled at the age of 70. If the claim
ant cannot show that he has greater
disability at these respective ages than
is recited above, it is of no use for him
to describe his ailments. It is a disad
vantage, in fact, because it will incur
the expense and delay of medical ex
amination. If a claimant is in fair
health for his age, it is useless to apply
for more than is allowed by the "Age"
Order.
Any one, however, who is sure that
he is more disabled than is allowed for
by the "AGE" Order should write to
R. W. Shoppell, or The National Trib
une, Washington, D. C., and a proper
blank will be mailed him without cost.
