A Christinas Ptory by Frank K- Stockton.
Special arrangements have been made for tho
.publication, In next Sunday's Journal, of a
novelette by Frank R. Stockton. It is a Christ
man love story entitled "Major rendallas, and
is invested with tlio unique charm so character
istic of tbi writer's work. Stockton has a pe
culiar twist In his mental make-op that leads
LIm to j.laco his characters in the most remarka
ble situations, and at the san:e time give such
i3ppnlnzs an air of tho greatest naturalness,
lie Invariably succeeds in gaining tho reader's
attention, and holding It to the end.- These) char
acteristics arc well shown in "Major Pendallas,
which is a highly entertaining and attractive
story. As bents a Christmas love story, or, in
Ved, a love story of any kind, tho outcomo is
fcarpy, and the Journal congratulates its readers
on tho treat in store for them.
Possibly Mr. Crisp wishes his party
had not such a majority in tho House.
In making up committees he iinds Dem
ocrats too numerous for comfort.
A dill has been introduced in Con
gress to prohibit Chinamen from travel
ing in tho United States.' How are
those now here to pet away unless they
travel?
The President's postponement of ap
pointments suggests the possibility that
a considerable number of worthy cit
izens will be made happy by finding
each an office in his Christmas stocking.
Speaker Crisp has appointed two
committees, viz.: on accounts and on
mileage. Tho chairman of each was a
supporter of Crisp, while of tho nine
Democrats on tho two committees fivo
voted for Crisp and four for Mills. This
is a straw.
One tiling which tho Anglomaniac
press does not note is the fact that tho
president of tho principal tin-plato com
pany in tho Black Hills offers to contract
to deliver one hundred tons of block-tin
ono year henco at $C0 a ton less than
present prices.
There seems to bo a society in Now
York city which has tho laudable pur
pose of making it a more desirablo placo
of residence. Tho overthrow of Tam
many misrule and extravagance would
lay tho foundation of all reforms in
that direction.
It will disappoint those Democrats
who are expecting to mako capital out
of tho expenditures of tho administra
tion, when they rcalizo that Secretary
Tracy has reduced tho estimates of now
6hips to $12,300,000, which is 83,800,000
less than was appropriated last year.
There is another report to tho effect
that ex-Speaker Reed is contemplating
a retirement from public life at an early
day to engage in tho practice of law in
New. York city. Of course, he will not
retire until ho has seen tho adjournment
of tho Gorman-Hill-Tammany House
The advice of Governor-elect Flower
and Mr. Clews, of Wall street, is given
to those who have $100 to invest. Tho
former would invest it in real estate and
tho latter would put it in a bank as a
neat-egg. Neither of them suggests try
ing a flyer on a wheat or stock margin.
In the case where New York Demo
cratic supervisors counted out a Repub
lican Senator becanso several ballots
boro tho mark of the printer's "quads,"
Judge Harnard, a Democrat, has directed
them to count tho ballots and return tho
Republican as elected. This is bad for
Governor Hill.
The New York Sun is demanding of
Speaker Crisp that he put Mr. Holman
at tho head of the committee on appro
priations, to tho end that appropriations
may be cut down; nevertheless, tho Sun
will demand millions for a now custom
house postofneo extension, and the
never-ending improvements in New
York harbor.
It is very probable that many Massa
chusetts voters who wero led into the
error of voting for Messrs. Hoar and
Williams and electing them to tho House,
now that these peculiar persons are
called tho "kindergarten members," de
plore their folly and have resolved to
voto cither for Republicans or full
prown Democrats next time.
The Kansas City Journal thinks tho
comprehensiveness of the President's
message is not appreciated at first, but
has a growing importance. It says that
"Democrats aro beginning to realize
this quality in his message, and instead
of complaining that it shows a paucity
of idea?, they now acknowlcdga that it
has entirely too many sensible ones."
The Auditor of Stato has acted wisely
In revoking tho license of tho Progress
ive Benefit Order, of Boston, to do busi
ness in this State. This is ono of tho
etrich-quick concerns which have been
swindling tho public right and left during
the last Year or two. It has no standing
whatever in Massachusetts, whero it
professes to have its headquarters, and
its license to do business in this Stato
was obtained by fraud. Our peoplo
cannot bo too careful about dealing with
bogus concerns of this kind which offer
fabulous profits. It was unfertunato
that the Auditor should have issued a
certificate to this company to do busi
ness in tho Stato without having in
formed himself as to its homo standing,
but ho has dono tho next best thing in
revoking tho certificate- as soon as ho
obtained the information.
PBACIICAL BECIPB0C1IY.
In regard to reciprocity, the question
is not so much who first originated or
suggested tho idea, as who first applied
it and put it into practical operation.
Many a valuable invention or discovery
has been suggested in a theoretical o:
tentative way long before it was con
summated, but the real inventor or dis
coverer is he who gives tho idea practi
cal effect. No .doubt there wero other
persons besides Christopher Columbus
who believed in the existence of a west
ern world, but he was tho first to deni
onstrato tho fact.
The idea of reciprocity in trade is al
most as old as the government and, has
been dimly shadowed forth in many
official papers. Ineffectual attempts
wero made in that direction during tho
administration of Washington, and the
records show that both Jefferson and
Madison believed it practicable and de
sirable. John Quincy Adams, in his
message of 182S, strongly urged it as a
wise policy for the United States to pur
sue. Thomas II. Benton, in his "Thirty
Years' View," discusses, at some length,
tho clauso of tho Constitution which
gives Congress tho power to regulato
commerce with foreign nations, and con
tends that up to his time it had never
yet been executed in tho sense intended
by tho Constitution. Ho insisted that
none of our commercial treaties or tariff
laws, whether for revenue or protection,
carried out the object of that clause. Ho
continues: '
The principle of the regulation was to be
that of reciprocity that is, that trade was
not to be free on one sido and fettered on
the other; that goods were not to bo taken
from a foreign country ireo of duty, or at a
low rate, unless that country should take
something from us also free or at a low rate.
And the mode of acting was by discriminat
ing in tho imposition of duties between
those which had and bad not commercial
treaties with usthe object to be accom
plished by an act of Congress to that effect,
which foreign nations might meet either
by legislation in their imposition of duties,
or, and which is preferable, by treaties of
specified and limited duration.
This extract from a work published
thirty-five years ago shows that its
author had very clear ideas in regard to
reciprocity of trade, but ho did not claim
that they wero. original with him. Ho
fonnd them shadowed forth by tho
statesmen of a previous generation. It
is obvious, thereforo, that the theory of
reciprocity is not now nor of recent
origin.
It is not necessary to claim for President
Harrison or Secretary Blaine that either
of them originated or discovered tho
idea of reciprocity in trade. Tho claim
in that form could not bo sustained. It
is enough that this administration is tho
first to give practical form and effect to
tho idea, tho first to carry tho theory
into practice. No matter what tho early
statesmen may have thought or recom
mended on tho subject, or what they
deemed practicable, politic or wise.
Reciprocity in their day was a barren
ideality, a mere dream of statesmanship,
and continued to bo so long after they
wero dead and gone. It nover was put
into practical operation until now. It
remained for this administration to
brcatho tho breath of lifo into a dead
theory and make it a living actuality.
Tho important trado arrangements mado
by this administration with various gov
ernments under the reciprocity provision
of tho McKinley law aro tho first
fruits of tho theory of reciprocity put
in practice. They are eminently char
acteristic of this business administra
tion. AN ATTACK OF FREE-TRADE RABIES.
Tho free-trade organ which always
seems to be . seized with rabies when
over it undertakes to treat of any ques
tion or matter relating to the protection
of American industries is the New York
Times. It appears that Mr. J. W. Jones,
a reputable lawyer in Hutchinson, Kan.,
seeing a free-trade statement that tho
wages of spinners in Lowell, Mass., tho
employes of tho Buckeye reaper-works,
the Willimantic thread-works, the coal
miners of Illinois and other employes of
factories had been reduced, wrote to tho
managers of these works, or others
knowing about thtfa: management, to
ascertain if tho declarations wero true.
Ho was moved to do this becanso tho
assertions had been paraded in tho organ
of the political Farmers Alliance. When
Mr. Jones received replies from theso
sources ho gave them to a paper called
tho Interior Herald, of Hutchinson, Kan.,
to bo published in tho interest of fair
play. It will 6triko any ono but a rabid
free-trade Anglomaniac that this was
an entirely proper thing for an Amer
ican citizen to do. But 6uch seems
not to bo tho opinion of tho New
York Times, which evidently hates
nn American manufacturer with the in
tensity with which John Randolph hated
a sheep. It seems to assumo that a man
living in Kansas has no right to mako
any inquiries which may lead to exposure
of tho stock lies of free-traders, whether
they aro tho handiwork of tho newspa
per printed on British-mado presses in
New York or tho effusions of Jerry
Simpson. Therefore, tho Times has
fallen upon Mr. Jones, of Kansas, with
nil manner of sneers. He is tho author
ity in Kansas which Eastern papers quote,
and altogether an improper person be
cause ho has asked some questions about
wages and jmblixhed the answer?".
Among other papers which have ex
cited the wrath of tho Times for accept
ing Mr.' Jones's letter as authority is tho
Journal. Mr. Jones never posed as an
authority. He wrote letters of inquiry
to six manufacturers orother men inter
ested in manufacturing who had been
reported as cutting down tho wages of
their employes, and ho simply gave out
their replies for publication. Of tho
genuineness of theso rcplios there can
bo no doubt, sinco tho originals have
been sent tho Journal by Mr. Jones to
establish tho fact that his information
was genuine. All of these replies aro to
tho effect that wages have not been rc
dnced since the passago of the McKinley
law, and in two cases of tho six, affect
ing the greater number of employes, the
letters declaro that wages had been in
creased sinco tho passage of that law.
Tho Times is trying to mako its read
ers believo that there has been a general
reduction of wages sinco tho passago of
the McKinley law, which is not tho case.
It quotes a few iron-works in which
wages aro not so high as before its pas
sage, but it fails to add that the general
duties on iron wero reduced by tho pres
ent law. But while tho Times, and
those liko it, make tho most of an occa
sional striko or dispute about wages in
this country, they mako no mention of
tho declining tendency of wages and
tho partial suspension of work in the
tin-plate and other industries in Eng
land; that wages havo had a downward
tendency in Great Britain during tho
years that they havo had an upward
tendency in Germany under protection;
that, with any slight decrease in raro
cases, the wages yet paid in tho iron in
dustry, and most others, are, on an
average, more than 73 per cent, higher
than in free-trade England.
PROPOSED ELECTORAL REFORM.
Ex-Congressman J. M. Ashley, of Ohio,
has a plan which ho thinks would effect
ually do away with gerrymanders in tho
election of Stato legislatures. His plan
is framed especially for Ohio, but is ap
plicable to any Stato by a simple chango
of numbers. For Ohio ho proposes to
amend the Constitution so that instead
of electing members of tho Legislature
by counties, they should bo elected
partly by districts and partly by tho
Stato at largo. Thus, presuming that
the Legislature is to consist of ninety
three members, ho would havo ninety of
them elected m eighteen districts, livo
members to a district, and threo by tho
State at large, tho members at large to
bo voted for on the same ballot as tho
district members. Three representative
districts of contiguous territory should
make ono senatorial district, in each of
which fivo Senators should bo elected.
In addition to these thirty Senators,
elected by districts, there should bo not
less than three nor more than five elect
ed by tho Stato at large. Ho would
havo all candidates for tho Legis
lature nominated by primary elec
tions, thus doing away with nom
inating conventions, and ho would
also provido that each elector shall have
tho right to cumulate his voto and cast
all tho votes to which ho is entitled in
tho district of his residence, and in tho
Stato at large, or both, as ho may elect,
for ono of tho duly-nominated candi
dates, 'or for more than ono of said can
didates, under such rules and regula
tions as tho General Assembly may by
law prescribe. Mr. Ashley claims that
this plan is npplicablo to every Stato
and city, and that it would insure an
equitable distribution of political power
under any apportionment that could be
made, clothing each elector with tho
right to vote on ono ballot for tho samo
number of Senators and Representa
tives, thus securing to each voter abso
lute equality at tho ballot-box. Obvi
ously, under such a plan of districting
and apportionment, every voter in each
Representative district would voto for
five district Representatives and threo
from tho State at large.
With slight modification tho plan
could bo adapted to Indiana or any
other State. It would, of course, in
volve a chango of tho Constitution, but
that would be an easy matter if the plan
should commend itself to tho people.
Anything is worth trying that promises
to put an end to gerrymandering.
The rumor goes in Washington that
the election of Crisp ns Speaker will
bring some now men to the front and
probably send some old ones to the rear.
With all his devotion to tho party he
has got to stand by his friends, and that
means that those who contributed most
to his election will como in for special
plums in tho distribution of committee
chairmanships and other favors. It is
said that tho threo men who wero clos
est to Crisp during his canvass and who
did him tho best service, nro Catchings,
of Mississippi; Montgomery, of Ken
tucky, and OTerrall, of Virginia. None
of theso men wero very conspicuous in
tho last Congress, but they aro likely to
bo in this one. It is believed that
Shively will tako tho place of Bj'num
ns tho Democratic leader from this
State. Tho movement to expunge the
voto of censuro on Bynum, made by tho
last House, is probably in his interest,
the object being to get up a discussion
with him as tho central figure. Bynum
depends very much on clap-trap adver
tising. '
The Chicago Herald recently pub
lished a dispatch from this city stating
that tho friends of tho lato Governor
Hovey were indignant at tho wide pub
licity that had been given to "an alleged
interview" with him, first published in
tho Evansvillo Standard, in which ho
epoko in high terms of President Harri
son's administration and predicted his
renomination and election. The Herald
dispatch declared that the alleged inter
view was not authentic and that Gov
ernor Hovey had denied it. This state
ment is, beyond question, untrue. Tho
Evansvillo Standard has fully substan
tiated tho correctness of its report, but
if any further testimony is needed the
writer of this paragraph will say that in
a conversation held with Governor
Hovey, a few days beforo ho left for
Mexico, he distinctly indorsed the in
terview and reiterated the statements
then expressed.
The Collector j Customs at Buffalo
says that immediately following tho
passage of tho McKinley net there was
a marked stagnation in importations
from Canada, but things soon adjusted
themselves to the new conditions and
trade is now as large ns over. Tho
noticeable feature in tho adjustment, ho
says, is that tho Canadians lowered tho
prices of articles on which tho duty was
increased, and raised prices where tho
duty was lowered. A comparison of
prices on both sides of the lino before
and sinco tho passago of tho bill shows
conclusively that the Canadian importer
pays the duty for tho privrlogo of enter
ing our market.
The Washington Herald, a strong
Democratic paper, say?:
President Harrison seems to havo caught
the popular fancy with, his message as
much as he did by his speeches on his cele
brated swing around tho circle. There is a
general chorus of approval of the tone, tho
literary style and the arrangement of tho
document, in which Democratic journals
nro not slow to join. While Democrats
differ with the President on all the great
questions of government policy with which
liedealsinhismessaze.it must be recog
nized that ho advances his ideas with ju
dicial calmness mid moderation, and im
parts to the entire document n tone that
bespeaks the broad-minded patriot aud
statesman, instead of tho politician. The
message is unmistakably one of the most
admirable documents issued from tho
White House in a long time.
Free-trade papers nro seconding tho
proposition that books for public
libraries be placed upon tho free list.
They aro hardly consistent. They wero
the most eager advocates of a copyright
Jaw whoso object is to mako foreign
books more expensive. They demanded
protection for authors, and tho same
Congress that passed the McKinley bill,
which confers protection upon other
products, granted it. Now, they would
liko to destroy tho effect of tho law they
advocated.
Editor Watterson thinks tho presi
dential situation, so far as tho Demo
cratic party is concerned, depends on
New York. Ho says: "If that Stato
comes to tho national Democratic con
vention against Cleveland it will be sui
cidal to nominate him, and ho will not
bo nominated. If it comes divided tho
nomination goes elsewhere, and if wo
leave Cleveland out we can not hope for
Now York." This makes a bad case for
tho Democracy.
The New York Herald has a signifi
cant caricature, which represents Cleve
land as a full moon being eclipsed by a
very dark body bearing tho outlines of
tho face of Governor Hill. It is signifi
cant becauso in all parts of tho country
thero is a feeling that this is tho very
thing that is taking placo in the Demo
cratic planetary system.
In view of tho lnct that prices are gen
erally lower than a year ago in all lines
of manufactured goods, when the free
trade prophet declared they would bo
much higher, cannot ho save his reputa
tion by declaring that his predictions,
like dreams, must be taken to mean just
tho opposite of his word.?

The .latest presidential gossip from
Washington is that Senator Cullom is
eDjoying a "boom.T on the ground that
ho can carry Illinois.; When it becomes
necessary for tho ' Republican party to
nominato an Illinois man in order to
carry that Stato it may as well retlro
from business.
Every other Democrat in tho Houso
wants to goon the ways and means com
mittee, according to. all accounts, and
tho rest aro willing to accept positions
on tho appropriations committee. No
wonder Speaker Crisp has decided to
retire to his nativo mountains for a
week or two.
Latest disclosures are to tho effect
that Edward M. Field swindled his
partners , out of several .hundred thou

It is hoped that tho kindly influences
of tho approaching Christmas season
will not fall to reach tho morning and
evening Democratic organs yet in sack
cloth and ashes over tho mishap of Mr.
Mills. It may not mean tho end of Mr.
Cleveland, after all.
Since his defeat for tho speakership.
Mills, of Texas, is giving an exhibition
of temper that justifies nil his enemies
havo said of him. Ho Is not only ill
tempered, but narrow, stubborn and
pig-headed.
The Muncio Times says that at a Repub
lican club meeting held in that city a few
nights' ago Hon. Ralph Gregory, arriving
at a late hour from sneaking in tho court
room, excused himself from making a
speech, but related what might bo callca a
joke, lie had written to headquarters for
literature on tho silver question, and a few
days afterwards was notiUcd by the post
master in Muncio to 6end for a package
that was too large and hoavy for the letter
carrier to deliver. Mr. Gregory dispatched
his clerk for the package, and in a few min
utes tho clerk returned staggering under
the weight of a load that fairly bent him
double. The packa?o was opened and
found to contain silver literature fifteen
thousand pages in pamphlets. Ho cited
this to show the breadth of one of the sub
jects that would be discussed in the next
campaign and to give an idea of the study
and preparation that would be required to
speak intelligently on the silver question.

Moltke was in the service of the Sultan,

of essays npon Oriental military u Hairs and
tho geography of Asia Minor. As the com

METHODISTS 3IAY USE A LITURGY.
liiahop Newman Speaks of Possible Re
turn to an Old Form of Service.
New York Ccrresrondenco Philaaelthia tress.
Just beforo leaving for his home in the
West, to-day, liishoD Newman tola me of a
rather important conference which has
just been held in this city with some lead
ing officers of the Methodist Church. The
conference was important in its suggestions
only. It was purely informal, and was
really a meeting for the interchange of
views respecting certain things which
are to come up before the General
Conference of the church iu Omaha in
May. The most striking suggestion which
was made, and it is one which will create
much discussion among Methodists and
Episcopalians as well, was that an effort
should be made to induce the Methodist
Church to adopt the Wesley liturgy.
Bishop Newman said that those with
whom he had talked were decidedly in
favor of this step, and while thero is likely
to be some opposition to it. yet he believes
that the liturgy will be adopted at this con
ference. Tho Wesley liturgy was sent to this
country by Wesley when the lirst Method
ists came here in the latter part of the last
century, it was not generally adopted,
but some of tho Methodist churches used
it. Even theso have gradually abandoned
it, so that now there is in the Methodist
Church no acoepted liturgy. As Bishop
Newman said: "When I attend a service
m a Methodist church I always feel like
asking, what next? after each exercise is
completo. Every church seems to be a law
unto itself, and the result is confusion,
whon a Methodist brother from one church
visits another. The time has come when
this must bo changed, and I have no doubt
that at the General Conference a liturgy
will bo adopted, and probably that of
Wesley."
If the Methodist Church does adopt the
'Wesley liturgy, it will bo almost impossi
ble to distinguish its services from those
of the Protestant Episcopal Church in
America. When Wesley began the great
movement of dissent which led to the crea
tion of the powerful Methodist sect, he pre
pared a liturgy which differed from that of
tho Established Church very little moro
than tho liturgy of tho Episcopal Church
of America does from that of the
mother church. In many respects the
Wesley liturgy and that iu uso in
Episcopal churches are identical.' It is
quite likely that the General Conference
may make some changes in the Wesley
liturgy, but they will be comparatively
tritling. and only such ns take cognizance
of the coudition of the chnrch to-day. The
effect of this step is almost impossible to
estimate. It was said in tho conference to
which reference is made above that its
tendency would almost inevitably bo to

TIIK AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK.
The Period of Depression Is Ended and the
Future Is Very Promising.
Indiana Farmer.
The statistics of the production by the
Department of Agriculture, showing the
great Increase in this country, throws a
good deal of light on tho cause of low
prices from which American agriculture
is now emerging. From 1S70 to ISiW tho
annual corn production increased from
7CO.000.000 bushels to 1.7G0.C0O.00O bnshels,
an increase of .over 100 percent. Wheat
production increased from 2S7.000.000 in
1870 to 4oT,000.000 in 180. nearly 100 per
cent. Oats from 282,000,000 bushels to
407.000,000. also nearly 100 per cent, in
crease. During the same decade, our popu
lation increased only W per cent. During
this period, the Suez canal was opened
and tho wheat of Inaia found its way to
tho markets of Europe, and the increased
production of Russia was also felt.
It is believed that this period of low
prices is about passed in this country.
While our population has greatly increased
sinco lt0, and consumers havo also in
creased in tho er.mo time, tho railroad
system has extended to the now land dis
tricts, and production iu this country can
nover increase so rapidly again. Million
of acres were brought into cultivation and
in reach of tho markets by the railway ex
tension from 1S70 t ISisO. This cannot oc
cur again, for tho agricultural la, is havo
all been penetrated and their pr'.luctions
made possible to market. Significant along
this line, also, is the wonderful growth of
the cities and towns over tho rural
districts. This, of course, means a
great increase of consumers of the farm
products. To tho rapid growth of man
ufacturing, mining aud commercial pur
suits, are duo this increase of city popula
tion. And so while thero is a rapid expan
sion of consnmption, there can be no such
expansion of production azain in this
country or the world ns that noted be
tween 1S70 and 1S0. Tho increased pro
duction in the future must como by more
and more intenso farming. This is brought
about by the educational forces in this
line. All know how hard it is to induce
changes in methods. It is usually
done by educating and impressing the
young and growing generation of farmers.
The naricultnral schools, experiment sta
tions and other forces are doing this work,
but tho process is slow compared with
huildinx thousands of mi'.rs of railway in
to new iieldsof production.
31 r. IloiTuIls Hint lin Harper.
New York Letter.
It is whispered in publishing circles that
tho Harpers did not mako a. very strenu
ous ellort to keep Mr. Howells in their em
ploy, aud that they have felt for some time
that tho prestige of bis name had not been
of the precuniary value to the magazine
and house which was expected. Moreover,
some of Mr. llowells's theories are nt par
ticularly admired by some of the Harper
people. Whether he will succeed an asso
ciate editor of the Cosmopolitan, remains
to bo demonstrated. If he does, ho will
overcome the tendency to tho belief that
he retired from theeditorship of the Atlan
tic Monthly because it was discovered that
his abilities wero creative rather than edi
torial. 4
WANT NEW CITY BUILDINGS
The Qncstion Discussed .it Length at tho
Meeting of the Commercial Club.
A Kesolution Faming the Erection of a New
Baildinj Adopted Matter Rfferrci to a
Special Committee Its Uses.
Tho regular meeting of the Commercial
Club was held last night at the club-rooms,
and thero was just ono more person pres
ent than the required number to make a
quorum. President Lilly stated that both
tho federal building and Democratic con
vention committees have been actively
at work furthering tho advance
ment of those projects. Ho 6aid that
tho committee felt satisfied that it
could convince tho Democratic national
committee that Indianapolis was amply
ablo to take care of each a convention, and
that everything pointed to the fact that
this city stood as good a chance of securing
it as any other city that is bidding.
Tho president then announced the special
business of tho evening the discussion of
the advisability of working for a city hall,
to be known as a memorial hall. The fol
lowing resolution was presented:
Resolved, That wcare in favor of the erection
of a city building on the vacant space known as
tlio i;at Market-street lot. Hald building to be
occupiod by the elty for city ofllces, Council
chambers, a memorial hall, lodge-rooms for the
various Grand Army posts and Woman's Relief
Corps, fire headquarters, ns vvcU as drUl rooms
for tho city military companies.
W. R. Holloway. editor of the American
Tribune, and a promoter of the idea, was
the first to speak upon the subject. Ho
said that while Indianapolis was a very
enterprising city, still it had' never done
any particularly big thing in the way of
building a fine pnblio edifice. Tomlinson
Hall had been given us, and now every
body wonders how wehad ever gotten along
without it. The fact that tho otlices of a
city like Indianapolis should bo stowed
away down in a damp, dark, murky cellar,
was a disgrace and a shame, and the sooner
tho city builds a respectable city build
ing the better. All other cities have
them, and even every little town
of any pretensions and enterprise has one.
Aside from using it for the purpose ot city
nthces. space on the upper floors could be
dovoted to museum purposes, where tho
mineral, agricultural aud other resources of
the Stato, both of the present time and of
past generations, might b collected to
gether, and thero they could be seen by tho
visitors to tho city. There is no place now
to take strangers after they have seen the
State-house and the soldiers monument.
Ex-Mavor 1). W. Grnbhs thought that
Colonel iiolloway's ideas were just right,
and said that since the completion of Tom
linson Hall be has wondered now the city
ever did without it- Yet even this build
ing does not relieve the city of its oflices.
He said all he could do to further the cause
he would do with a will. C. Hilgenberg
and Dr. J. W. Hervev spoke in the same
vein. R. K. Shiel called attention to the
mAgnihcent city buildings in Cincinnati.
Philadelphia. Chicago, boston and other
large centers, and said that it should
make Indianapolis blush for shame that
she has none. He thought that
the first thing to be done was to agree that
we wanted a biulding, get an architect and
have him draw the plans, and then get to
work and build it. This valuable advice
was unanimously approved as was observed
by the expressions on the faces of those in
tbe room. Some of the speakers opposed
the idea of putting the building on tho
Kast Market-street lot, as they thought
that ground should be kept for out-of-door
markets. Others favored not putting a
market in tho new building at all. but to
use it exclusively for a memorial hall.
Mr. Shiel said if the city wonld give him
a twenty-iivo years' lease of a site ho
would build a market-house "that would
be a dAndy and a dead winner."
Mr. Voss moved to amend tho resolution
so that tho words "on the vucant space
known as the East Market-street lot" bo
stricken out. The amendment was carried.
President Lilly then spoke in be
half of the proposition and said he
regarded it as very important. This city is
able, he said, to build a handsome hro-
proof bnilding. and should do eo. He said
he often had occasion to visit the Mayor's
oflice, and always noticed an odor of eewer
gas about the place. Ho wondered that the
Mayor and city ollicera maintained their
health. The resolution, as amended, was
passed and referred to tho board of di
rectors, with a request that they refor it to
a special committee, to report at tho next
meetlug.
JOSEM WHIPPLE'S CONDITION.
He May Die as a Result of the Attack Mads on
Him Arrests Made.
r
Joseph Whipple, night watchman at the
North-side Gas-works, lies in a precarious
condition at his home, No. 178 West Ninth
street, and as the result of tho as
sault made upon him Sunday
night in front of Ward's saloon, on
Seventh street, near Illinois. He suffered
a concussion of tho brain, and is severely
injured in the chest. Tho former injury was
due to a blow from a pair of knacks, and
tho latter to a blow with a
bowlder. Whipple has not been able
to speak since tho occurrence, and
grave fears are expressed that he may not
recover. Dr. Glass and Dr. Earp attended
him yesterday. It is said that Whipple and
an acquaintance were going easton Seventh
street during the earlv part of the evening,
tho former being on his way to his work.
The acqnaintanco went into tho saloon
while Whipple waited on the outside.
Tho latter yesterday communicated, as
well as ho could by gestures and signs, that
while he was standing on the sidewalk:
waiting, Charles Vance and Thomas Force,
young men, came out of the saloon and
pounced upon him. The knocked him
down with knucks, and struck him with
bowlders. They rau away, leaving him un
conscious. Ho was taken to his homo by
friends.
Vanco and Foreo wero arrested yester
day by patrolmen Winn and Rhodes, for a
plain assault and battery. After the sen
ons nature of the wounds was discovered
Stationmaster Taflo was instructed to re
fuse bond for them for tho present on that
charge. They modo the pica of self-de-fenso
to a Journal reporter, and said that

A FOR1IIDDLX CITY.
Queer Story of an Ancient Mexican Town
That No White Man Hat Entered.
Correppor.of nee Philadelphia Pr as.
Mr. Juan Alvarez, who has jut returned
from an exploring expedition in the south
west part of the republic, reports that ho
has found a city which has never been en
tered by white men, and which has evi
dently been in existence for hundrtds of
years, going back before tho time ot tho
conquest of the county- by the Spaniard.
It is an old Aztec city, and tho approach
to it are so guarded by nature that it is an
impossibility to reach it if tho inhabitants
do not want the traveler to get m. The
eity lies in the almost inaccessible mount
ains. In the extreme southwestern part of
the country, and is so far away from civil
ization that few white men have ever born
in tho neighborhood.
It was by tho purest accident that Alva
rez becauio aware that a city was any
where iu the vicinity, and after he fouud
it all of his endeavors to reach it were un
availing on account of the persistent oppo
sition of the natives. He had been travel
ing over the mountains in search of an out
let to the Pacitic ocean when he cauie to
the top of an elevated plateau and crossed
to the further edge. He had a magnificent
view, and while looking over the country
saw what ho took to be houses in a far dis
tant valley A close inspection with a glahi
eoon convinced him that what he saw was
really a collection of houses, and he at once
set about reaching the place to seo who
lived in that part of the country.
After days of hard work, climbing over
clifls and mountains, he reached a rdnco
from which he obtained a good view of tho
city and eaw that it was regularly laid out
in streets and was peopled with a race who
knew something about civilization. The
houses were of stone and were surrounded
by yards, in which were growing flowers
and shrubs. On all sides were evidences of
taste shown by the inhabitants, and it was
evident that he had foond ft city which was
not known to the outside world. A careful
examination of tho country showed him
that the city was within a natural amphi
theater, and was accessible from one side
only. He saw that the only means of ac
cess was through a long and narrowdelilo
which led into the mountains from tho
Pacitic coast side, aud he started to reach
the place where be could iind this entrance.
He made an outline drawiug of the city
as lb appcureu IU JUIU liuiu mo uiDiaut
mountain top, and this is all he has to show
that there is a city within the heart of tho
mountains, for he was never allowed to
reach the spot.
From this drawing it is plain that tho
city has not less than four thousand inhab
itants. The houses are all of stone and aro
supplied with doors and windows. In the
center was a large bnilding. which was un
doubtedly the temple of worship, for on its
wails could be seen sculptured designs rep
resenting the deity. It was in the shape
of tbe ancient teocallies, which are to bo
found in many parts of this country, and
the people could be seen passing in aud out
during all hours of the day.
After ten days of arduous work Alvarez
found himself at the foot of the mount
ains on the western slope, and 6et about
searching for the canyon leading to the
city, lie had so well marked tbe lay of
tho land that ho bad no difficulty in lind
ing tbe entrance, but be was met by a
band of Indians who refused to let him
Eroceed. They ottered him no violence,
ut insisted that he should return. Ho
told them that he had como over the
mountains, and that be uid not know
how to get back. After a consulta
tion ho was told that be would havo to re
main awbile as a prisoner, and two run
ners were sent into the mountains, who re
turned in a day with orders from some one
in authority, and Alvarez was blindfolded
and placed on tho back of a mule. Ho
traveled in this condition for three davs,
only having tho bandage removed from his
eyes at night. On tbo fourth day he was
told to remove the bandage, and when bo
did so he found himself on tho borders of
the Pacilic ocean. The Indians had gone,
leaving him with nothing t guide him
back to tho place whero ho had seen tho
city.
W hat the Tariff Has Done.
New York KecorGer.
Protection to our labor has raised Ameri
can industry from a condition of colonial
vassalage to British capital.
Even of luxuries prices have not been
generally increased to American consumers
by the new tarUl. TAkc, for example,
cigars, llome-made goods have unmis
takably improved, while the effort to raiso
the price of imported ones has brokeu
down. Tbe loss under new aystem falls
chiefly on the foreign manufacturer, not
on tbo American smoker.
