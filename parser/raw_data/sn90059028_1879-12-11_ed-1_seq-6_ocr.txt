CURRENT COMMENT.
AN alarming sickness has broken out
among the convicts of the Kentucky
penitentiary, and'from four hundred to
five hundred men are unable to work.
THE total value of exports of domes
tic provisions and tallow from the prin
cipal ports of this country for October,
1879, was $7,886,627, and for the same
month in 1878, $6,797,065.
WHEN the ex-Empress Eugenie ar
rived at Madrid, her mother, the count
ess de Montijo, was already dead. The
ex-empress visited her mother's house
on Saturday, and prayed over her body.
AT a meeting of Manchester Fenians
a resolution was passed declaring that
though a number of the brethren had
seceded under ecclesiastic ban, there is
life enough left in the society to carry
out the redemption of Ireland.
A YEAR and a half ago a mission for
lepers was established in North Iudia by
a missionary of the Church of Scotland.
Jt has now three asylums, with eighty
inmates, and of these twelve have pro
fessed Christianity. A more unattract
ive missionary field cannot well be
found.
ANOTHER of those too common ac
cidents" with a loaded gun has happen
ed in Portland, Oregon. A yonnst fool
was cleaning a gun, and pointed it at
two women to frighten them. He did
not know it was loaded the gun was
discharged, and one of the women was
instantly killed.
A fat boy living near Knowlesville,
Orleans county N. Y. kicks the beam
at 199 pounds, although only 11 years
of age. The fat seems to accumulate
about his legs, which have grown to
suchji size as to prevent him from
walking to school.
THE old powder magazine built by
the union forces, which stood on Main
street in the edge of the old cemetery
at Richmond, Va., has been torn down.
This is the last of the works left from
the war. The fortifications which were
around the grounds now occupied by
the magnificent buildings of Central
university, have long since disappeared.
M. VALENTINE, senator of France, died
suddenly in Paris lately, aged 56. Ex
iled by Louis Napoleon in 1851, he be
came professor of military history at
the military academy royal, Woolwich,
England, but in September, 1870, was
appointed professor of Strasburg, then
besieged by Germany, and entered it
by swimming across the river at night
under fire. At the surrender he was
imprisoned at Ehrenbreitstein.
THREE whales appeared off Cape
May, N. J., one day last week, close in
shore, going eastward slowly, throwing
single spouts about twenty feet into the
air. They were probably of the sperm
species. Large flocks of sea gulls sur
rounded and dived about. them. They
stopped the gillnet fishermen who were
after snapping mackerel, and kept pos
session of the sea during the day.
CHILDREN in England are very apt to
pick and swallow the berries of the yew.
The practice is a dangrou? one, as is
shown by the case 6f a little boy on
whose body an inquest has been held
at Oxford. The child had been strolling
through a cemetery with his friends,
and, while playing about, he had pluck
ed and eaten "a handful of yew-berries."
No evil efl'ect was noticable until next
morning, when he awoke in convulsions
and died even before the doctor could
be fetched. The poison seems to have
attacked the nerve centres, but in what
specific manner could not be said.
THERE is a prospect that the Kilken
ny policy will be adopted by the Utes.
Five hundred Southern Utes are ex
pected at the Los Pinos agency, to re
inforce Ouray, who has expressed his
determination to arrest the White River
Utes who led in the Meeker massacre.
The white River Utes have been col
lecting .their forces, and are not likely
to allow the arrests to be made if they
can help it. They number about throe
hundred warriors, while the combined
strength of the Southern and the Un
compahgre Utes is about seven' hun
dred, and Ouray claims positively that
these two bands will stand by him even
to the extent of fighting the White
River Utes, who are' only naturalized
member of the tribe.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citizens of Ihe Senate and House of Rep
resentatives
CONGRATULATORY.
The members of the Forty-sixth Congress havo
assembled in their first regular session under air
camstances calling for mutual congratulation and
grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of alt good
for the large and unusual measure of national
prosperity which we now enjoy.
The most interesting events which have occnrr
cd in our public aft'airs since my last annual mes
sage to congress are connected with the financial
operations of the government dircctlv affecting
the business interests
of the country. I congratu
late congress on the successful execution of the
resumption act. At the time fixed and in the
manner contemplated by law, United States notes
began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first ot
January last they have been promptly redeemed
on presentation, and in all business transactions,
public and private, in all parts of the couatrv,
they are received and paid out as the equivalent
of coin. The demand upon the treasury for gold
And silver in exchange for United States notes has
been comparatively small, and the voluntary de-
Eas
osit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes
been very large. The excess of the precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United States
notes over the amount of United States notes re
deemed is about $40,000,000.
RESUMPTION.
The resumption of specie payments has been
followed by a very great revival of business.
With a currency equivalent in value to the money
of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter
upon an equal competition with other nations in
trade and production. The increasing foreign de
mand for our manufactures and agricultural pro
ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our
favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st
of July last, to November 15, to the amount of
about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie
payments there has also been a marked and grati
fying improvement of the public credit. The
bonds of the government bearing only four per
cent. interest have been sold at or above par, suf
ficient in amount to pay off all of the national
debt \yhich was redeemable under present laws.
The amount of interest saved annually by the
process of refunding the debt, since March 1,1877,
is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in
small sums, and the number of our citizens now
holding the public securities is much greater than
ever before. The amount of the national debt
which matures within less than two years is $792,
121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the
rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds
Dealing six per cent, interest. It is believed thai
this part of the public debt can be refunded by the
issue of four per ccnt. bonds, and, by the reduc
tion ot interest which will thus be effected, about
eleven millions ot dollars can be annually saved
to the treasury. To secure this important reduc
tion of interest to be paid by the United States,
further legislation is required, which, it is hoped,
will be provided by congicss during its present
session.
COINAGE.
The coinage of gold by the mints of the United
States, during the last fiscal year was $40,986,912.
The coinage of silver dollars, since the passage of
the act for that purpose, up to November 1,1879,
was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been is
sued from the treasury ana are now in circulation
and $32,300,506 arc still in the possession of tho
government.
The pendency of the proposition for unity of ac
tion between the United Siates and the principal
commercial nations of Europe, to effect a perma
nent system for the equality of gold and silver ir.
the recognized money of the world, leadB me to
recommend that congress rel'rain from new legis
lation on the general subject. The great revival
of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during
the coming year, its own instructions, which may
well be awaited before attempting further experi
mental measures with the coinage. I would
however, strongly urge upon congress the import
ance of authorizing the secretary of the treasury
to euspend tbe coinage ot silver dollars upon the
present legal ratio. The market value of the sil
ver dollar being uniformly and largely less thar
the market value of the gold dollar, it is obvious
ly impracticable to maintain them at par wi'h
each other if both are coined without limit. II
the cheaper coin Is forced Into circulation it will,
if coined without limit, soon become the sole
standard of value, and thus defeat the desired
objec\ which is a currency Of both gold and sil
ver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for
dollar, with the universally recognized money of
the world.
RETIREMENT cr GREENBACKS.
The retirement, from circulation of United
States notes, with the capacity of legal-tender in
private contracts, is a step to lie taken in our pro
gress towards a tafe and stable currency, whicii
should be accepted as the policy and duty of the
government, and the interest and security of the
people. It is my firm conviction that the issue ol
legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the.
authority and crsclit of the government," except ia
extreme emergency, is without, wan ant in the
constitution, and a violation of sound lloanciit!
principles. The Issue of United States notes dur
ing the late civil war with the capacity of It gal
tender between private individuals was not au
thorized except as a meant of rescuing th»
country from imminent peril. The circulation ol
these notes as paper money, for any protracted
period of time after the accomplishment of this
purpose, was not contemplated by the framers of
the law under which they were issued. They an
ticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these
notes at the earliest practicable period consis
tent with the attainment of tii* object for which
they were provided.
FATING THE WAR D1SBT.
The policy of the United States, "steadily ad
hered to from the adoption of tne constitution,
has been to avoid the creation of a national debt,
and when, from necessity in time of war. debts
hare been crentsd, they have been paid off on the
return of peace as rapidly na possible. With this
view, and for this pnrpose, it is recommended that
the existing laws for the accumulation of a sink
ing fund sufficient to extinguish the public
debt within a limited period be maintained. It
any change of the objects or rates ot taxation i«
deemed necessary by congress, it is suggested
that experience has shown that a duty can be
placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance
the price of those articles to the consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars an
nually to the treasury.
POLYGAMY..
The continued deliberate violation by a large
number of the prominent and inttuentiftl citizens
of the territory or Utah of the laws of the United
States for the prosecution and punishment o?
polygamy demands the attention of every depart
ment of the government. This territory has a
population sufficient to entitle it to admission as
a -state, and the general interest of the nation, as
•well as the welfare of the citizens of the terri
tory, require its advance from tbe territorial foim
of government to the responsibilities and priv
ileges of a state. ThH important change will
not, however, be approved by the country while
the citizens of Utah in very considerable number
uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime
iy the laws of all civilized communities through,
out the world.
The law for the suppression of this offence Was
enacted with great unanimity by congress more
than seventeen years ago, but hiis remained until
recently a dead letter in the territory of Utah,
because of the peculiar difficulties attending its
enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed
among the citizens of Utah that tho law was in
contravention of the constitutional guarantee of
religious freedom. This objection is now remov
ed. The supreme court of the United States has
decided the law to be within the legislative power
of congress, and binding as a rule of action for
all who reside within the territories. There la
no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in
Its enforcement. It should be firmly and effect
ively executed. Ir not sufficiently stringent In
lie provisions it should be amended, and. In aid
ol the purpose in view, I recommend that more
comprehensive and more searching method* for
preventing as well as punishing: this crime be
provided. If necessary to secure obedience to
the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights
and privileges of citizenship in the territories of
the United states may be withheld or withdrawn
from those who violate or oppose the enforcement
ot the law on this subject.
ZLXCT1VS FRANCHISE.
The elections of the past year, though occupied
only with state offices, have not failed to elicit in
the political discossions which attended them all
over the country, new and decisive evidence of
the deep interest which the great body of citizens
take In the progress of the country towardo a
more general and complete establishment, at
whatever cost, of universal security and lreedom
In the exercise or the elective franchise. While
many topics of political concern demand great
attention from our people, both in the sphere of
national and state authority, I find no reason to
qualify the opinion I expressed In my last annual
menage, that no temporary or' administrative in
terests of government, however urgent or weighty,
will ever displace the zeal of oar people in de­
fence of the primary rights of citizenship, and
that the power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices, and all sectional and state
attachments,' in demanding that all over our
wide territory the name and character of citizen
of the United States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry witlf them unchallenged security
and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelli
gence and patriotism of all good citizens of every
part of the country, however much they may be
divided in opinions ou other political subjects, to
untte in compelling obedience to existing laws
aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage.
I respectfully urge upon congress to supply any
defects in these laws which eixperience has shown
and which it is within its power to remedy. I
again invoke the co-operation of the executive
and legislative authorities of the states in this
great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the
public mind can be set at rest on this paramount
question of popular rights, no serious obstacle
will thwart or delay the complete pacification of
the country, or retard the general diffusion of
prosperity.
CIVIL SEBVIOB.
In a former message I invited the attention of
congress to the subject of the reformation of the
civil service of the government, and expressed
the intention of transmitting to congress as early
as practicable a report upon this subject by the
chairman of the civil service commission.
In view of the fact* that, during a considerable
period, the government ot Great Britain has been
dealing with administrative problems and
abuses, in various particulars analogous to those
presented in this country, and that in recent
years the measures adopted were understood to
have been effective and in every respect highly
satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have fuller
inlormation upon the subject, and accordingly re
quested the chairman of the civil service com
mission to make a thorough investigation for
this pprpoae. The result has been an elaborate
and comprehensive report.
The report sets forth the history of the partisan
spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise
and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of
official interference with the freedom of elections.
It shows that after long trials of various kinds of
examinations, those which are competitive and
open on equal terms to all, and which are carried
on under tue superintendence of a single commis
sion, have, with great advantage, been establish
ed as conditions of admission to almost every
official place in the subordinate administration of
that country and of British India. The comple
tion of the repoit, owing to the extent of the labor
involved in its preparation, and tho omission of
congress to make any provision either for the
compensation or the expense of the commission,
has been postponed until the present time. It is
herewith transmitted to congress.
While tbe reform measures on smother govern
ment are of no authority for us, tney are entitled
to influence, to the extent to which their intrinsic
wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions
and social life may commend them to our consid
eration.
The views I have heretofore ftpremed concern
ing the defects and abuses in our civil administra
tion remain unchanged, except ia
bo
far as an
enlarged experience has deepened my sense of
the duty both of officers and of tbe people them
selves to co-operate for their removal. Tbe grave
evils and perils ofa'.partisan-spoils system of ap
pointment to office and of oQlco tenure, are now
generally
recognized. In tbe resolutions of the
great parties, in the reports of departments, in the
debates and proceedings of congress, in tbe mes
sages of executives, the gravity of these evils has
been pointed out and the need of their reform
has been'admitted.
To command the necessary support, every meas
ure of reform must be based on common right and
justice,* and must be compatible with the healthy
existence of great parties, which are inevitable
and essential to a great and free state.
When tbe people have approved a policy at a
national election, confidence! on the part of tbe
officers they have selected, and of the advisers
who, in accordance with our political institutions,
should be consulted, in the policy which it is their
duty to carry into effect, is :ndeepensihle. It is
eminently proper that they should explain it be
fore the people, asl well as illustrate its splr* in
the performance of tMeTr official duties.
Very different consideration" apply to the
Creutcr number of those wii II the subordinate
places iu the civil service. .en- responsibility
is to their superiors in f. i»l position. It is
their duty to obey tbe It's -unctions of those
upon whom that author kv involved, and their
best public service con^i the discharge of
their functrons irrespeci.. of partisan politics,
their duties are the sam '.never party is iu
power an.l whatever po -vails. As a con
sequence it follows that toir tenure of office
should not depend on' prevalence of any"
toIiry or tbe supremacy of any party, but should
be determined by their capacity to serve the
people most usefully,
quite
irrespective of parti­
san interests. The same considerations that
should govern the tenure, should also prevail in
the appointment, discipline, and removal of
these subordinates. The authority of appoint
ment and lemoval is not a perquisite, which may
be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but
is a trust to be exercised iu the public interest,
under all the sanction* which attend the obliga
tion to apply the public funds only for public
purposes.
livery citizen has an equal right to the honor
and profit of entering the public service oi his
country. The only just ground of discrimination,
is the measure of character and capacity he has
to make that service most useful to the people.
Except In cases where, npou just and recognized
principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices
and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past
services, their bestowal upon any tbeory which
disregards personal merit, if an act of injustice
to the citizens, as well as a breach of that trust
subject to which the appointing power is held.
In the light of these principles, it becomes of
great importance to provide just and adequate
means, especially for every department, and large
administrative office, where personal discrimina
tion on the part of its head is not practicable, for
ascertaining those qualifications to which ap
pointments and removals should have reference.
To fail to provide such means is not only to deny
the opportunity of ascertaining the facts npon
which the most righteous claim to office depends,
but, of necessity, to discourage all worthy aspi
rants, by handing over appointments and remov
als. to mere influence ana favoritism. If it is the
right of the worthiest claimant to gain the ap
pointment, and the interest of the people to be
stow it upou him, it would seem clear that a wise
and just method of ascertaining personal fitness
for office must be an important and permanent
function of every just and wise government. It
haslong since become impossible, in the great of
fices, for those having the duty of nomination and
appointment, to personally examine into tbe in
dividual qualifications of more than a small pro
portion of those seeking office and, with the en
largement of the civil service, that proportion
must continue to become less.
In the earlier years of the government, the sub»
ordinate offices were so few In number that it was
quite easy for those making appointments and
promotions to personally ascertain the merits of
candidates. Party managers and methods had
not then become powerful agencies -of coercion,
•hostile to the free and just exercise of the ap
pointing power. .'
A large and responsible part of the duty of res
toring the civil service to tho desired purity and
efficicncy rests with the president, ana it is my
purpose to do what is within my power to ad
vance snch prudent and gradual measures of re
form as will most surely and rapidly bring about
that radical change of system essential to make
our administrative methods satisfactory to a free
and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of
authority, it is in the power of the executive to do
much to promote sucli a reform. But it cannot
be too clearly understood that nothing adequate
can be accomplished without co-operation on the
part of congress and considerate and intelligent
support among tho people. Reforms which chal
lenge the generally accepted theories of parties,
and demand changes in tho methods of depart
ments. arc not the work of a day. Their perma
nent foundations must be laid in sound principles
and in an experience which demonstrates their
wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversar
cs. Every worthy officcr desires to make his of
ficial action again and honor to his country, but
the people themselves, far more than their officers
in public station, are Interested in a pure, econom
ical, and vigorous administration.
By laws euacted In 1853 and 1855. and now in sub
stance Incorporated in the Revised Statutes, tne
practice of arbitrary appointments to the several
subordinate grades In tbe great departments was
condemned, and examinations, as to capacity, to
be conducted by departmental boards of examin
ers, were provided for and made conditions of ad
mission to the public service. Tbese statutes aro
a
decision by Congress thai examination of some
sort, as to attainments and capacity, are essential
to the well-being of the public service. Tne tin-
faws
ortant questions since the enactment of these
have beea as to the character of these exam
inations, and whether official favor and partisan
Influence, or common right and merit, were to con
trol the access to the examinations. In practice,
these examinations have not always been open to
worthy persona generally who might wish to be
examined. official favoritism and partisan influ
ence, as a rule, appear to have designated those
who alene were permitted to go before the exam-.
lntng-board8, subjecting even the examiners to a
pressure from the friends ef the candidates very
difficult to resist. As a consequence, the standard
of admission fell belsw that-Whlcb the public In-
interest demanded. It was also almost inevitable
that a»eystem which provided for various separate
boards of examiners.with no common supervision
or uniform method of procedure, should result in
confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of
capacity highly detrimental to the public interests.
A further and more radical change wasobviou-iy
required.
In the annual message ot December, 1870, my
predecessor declared time "there is no duly which
.«o much embarrasses the executive and heads of
departments as that of appointments: nor is there
any such arduous and thankless labor imposed ou
senators and representatives as that of finding
.places for constituents. The present system does
not secure the best men, and orcen not even fit men
for the public places. The elevation and purifica
tion of the civil service ot the government will be
li'iiled with approval bv the whole people of the
United States," Congress accordingly passed the
act, approved March 3,1871, ''to cgulate the civil
service of the United States and promote the effi
ciency thereof," giving tbe neces-.arv authority to
the executive to inaugurate a civil-service re
form
Acting under this statute, which w:s Interpreted
as intended to secure a system of just »nd effectual
examinations under uniform supervision, a num
ber of eminently competent persons wei-e selected
for the purpose, who entered with zeal upou the
discharge of their duties, prepared, with an intel­
ligent
aopreclation of the requirements of tho ser
vice, the regulations contemplated, and took
cbargc of the examinations, and who, in tlirir ca
pacity as a board, have been kuown as the ''Civil
•aervice Oommifsion. Congress for two years ap
propriated the money needed for the compensa
tion ana for the expense of carrying on the work
of the commission.
It appears from the report of the commission,
submitted to the president in April, 1871, that ex
aminations had been held in varions sections ot
,Si .untrY\ ,aMd
,thi^t
an appropriation of about
*2S.00U would be required to meet the annual ex
penses, including salaries, involved in discharging
the duties of tne commission. The report was
tS,.8??Pre??,.by
special messago ot
April 18, lb if. with the following favorable com
ment upon the labors of the commission: "If sus
tained by congress, I have no doubt the rules can.
after the experience gained, be so improved and
enforced as to still more materially benefit the
public service and relieve the executive, members
of congress, and the heads of departments, from
Influences prejudicial to good administration. The
-rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, listve
resulted beneficially, as is shown by tho opinions
of the members of the cabinet and their subordi
nates in the departments, and in that opinion I
concur." And in the annual message of December
of the same year similar views are expressed, aud
an appropriation for continuing the work of the
commission again advised.
The appropriation was not made, and, as a conse
quence, the active work of the commission was
suspended, leaving the commission itself still in
existence. Without the means, therefore, of cans
lug qualifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or of securing for tbe public service the
advantages of_ competition upon any extensive
?iss. "I in J" ituuaai 'message oi
December. 1877, tho making of an apprprlatfou
for the resumption ef the work oX tne commis
sion.
1
In the meantime, however, competitive exam
inations under many embarrassments have been
conducted within limited spheres in the execu
tive departments in Washington, and in a num
ber of the custom houses and post offices of the
[principal cities of the country, with a view to
further test their effects, and, In every instance,
they have been found to be as salutary as they
are stated to have been under tho administration
of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity
and cfficienty of the public service would be
greatly promoted by their systematic Introduc
tion. wherever practicable, throughout the entire
'civil servico of the government, together with
ample provision for their general supervision, In
order to secure consistency and uniform justice,
Reports from the secretary of the interior, from
the postmaster-general, from tbe^postmaster in
the city of New York, where such examinations
'have been some time on trial, and al«o from tbe
collector of the port, the naval officer, and the
surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters
and collectors in several of the other large cities,
show that the competitive system, where applied,
has, in various ways, contributed to Improve tbe
public service.
The reports show that the results have been sal
utary in a marked degree, and that the general
application of similar rales cannot fail to be of
decided benefit to the service.
The reports ot the government officers, in the
city of New York especially, bear decided testi
mony to the utility of open competitive examina
tions in their respective offices, showing that
these examinations, and the excellent qualifica
tions of those admitted to the service through
them, havo bad a marked Incidental effect upon
(the persons previously in the service, and partic
ularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There
baa. been, on the part ot these latter, an Increased
Interest in the work, and a desire to extend ac
quaintance with it beyond tbe particular desk oc
cupied, and,thus the morale of tbe entire force
has been raised. The examinations have
jbeen attended by many citizens who have had an
opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope
and character of the tests and the method of de
termining the results, and those visitors have,
without exception, approved the methods em
plowed, and several of them have publicly attest
ed their favorable opinion.*'
Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to
renew the recommendation contained in my aa
liual message of Xiectimber, 1877, requesting con
gress to make the necessary appropriation for
the resumption of the work of tbe civil servlee
commission. Economy/will be promoted by au
thorizing a moderate compensation to persons in
the public service who may perform extra labor
'upon or under the commission, as the exe cutlve
may direct.
I am convinced that if a joet and adequate
test of merit is enforced tor-admission to the pub
lie service and in making promotions, such
Abuses as removals withont good cause and par
tisan and official interference with the proper
exercise of thoappointing power, will in' large
measure disappear.
There are other administrative abuses to which
the attention of congress should be asked in this
connection. Mere partisan appointments, and
,the constant peril of removal without cause very
naturally lead to an absorbingTand mischievous
political activity, on tho part of those thus ap
pointed, which not only interferes with tbe due
discharge of official duty, but is incompatible
with the freedom, of elections.' Not without
warrant, in the views of several of my predeces
fors in the presidential office, andLdirectly with
in the law of 1871, already cited. I endeavored,
by regulation, made on the 22d day of June, 1877,
to put some reasonable limit to such abuses. It
may not be easy, and it may never perhaps' be
necessary, to define with precision the proper
limit of political action on tbe part of federal:
officers. Bat while their right to hold and freely1
express their opinions cannot be questioned, it
is very plain that they should neither be allowed
to devote to other subjects the time needed for
proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use
tho authority of their office to enforce their
own opinions, or to coerco tbe political action of
those who hold different opinions.
Seasons of justice *nd public policy, qulto
analogous to those which forblcUhe use of ot*
Octal power for the oppression of the private
citizen, impose npon the government tho duty
of protecting its officers and agents from arbi
trary exactions. In whatever aspect considered,
the practice of making leviesKfor party
purposes, I
upon the salaries of omcers'is highly demoraliz*1
ingto the public service and discreditable to tho
country. Though an officer should be as free as
any other eitizen, give his money In aid of his
opinions or his party, he should also be as free as!
any otber citizen to refuso to make such gifts. If
salaries are but a fair compensation for tbe time
ami labor of the officer, it is a gross injustice to
levy a tax upon them. If they are made exces

I recommend, therefore, euoii a revision and
extension of present st»tpt$s as Isbatl secure to I

OUB RELATIONS WITH FOKBfGK COUHTMBS HAVE
CONTINUED PiEACSrCI..
With Great Britain there are still unsettled
questions, growing out or the local laws of the
maritime provinces and the action or provincial
authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights
secured by treaty to American fishermen. The
United States minister iu London has been in*
stracted to present a demand lor 0105,305.02 in
view of the damages received by American citi
zens at Fortune Bay on tbe Gth day of January.
1878. The subject has been taken into consider!
ationby the British government, and an early re*
ply is anticipated.
Upon tho completion of the necessary prelim
inary examinations, the subject of our participa
tion in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by
treaty, will at once be brought to the attention
of the British government with a view to an early
and permanent settlement of the whole question,
which was only temporarily adjusted by tae treaty
of Washington.
Efforts have been made to obtain the removal
of restrictions found injurious to tbe exportation
of cattle to tbe United Kin?dom.
Some correspondence has also occurred with
regard to the rescue and saving of lire and prop*
erty npon the lakes, which has resulted in lm
poitaut modifications of tbe previous regulations
of the Dominion government on' the subject, in
the Interest of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the jd|| resolution of the
IfiSfcMfitioEL of- QQDgre»e. coWB|b»«KnerB were at*
pointed to represeCl tfte United grates attSeWo
international exhibitions in Australia, one of
which is now in progress at Sydney, aud the other
to be held next year at Melbourne. A dersire has
been expressed by our merchants, and manufac
turers interested in the important and. growing
trade with Australia, that an increased provision
should be. made by congress for the representa
tion of our industries at the Melbourne exhibi
tion of next year, and the subject is respectfully
submitted to your favorable consideration.
I THE Fit EN CM CAB
LB,
The assent of tbe government has been given to
the landing, on tbe coast of Massachusetts, of a
new and independent transatlantic cable between
France^ bv way of the French island of St. Pierre,
and Ibis country.subject any future legislation of
congiesspn the subject. The conditions imposed
before allowing this connection with our shores
to be established, arasuch as to secure Its compe
tition with any existing or future lines of marine
cable, and preclude amalgamatiou therewith, to
pi ovide for entire equality of rights te our govern
meat and people with those of France in use of tbe
cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the
privilege as accorded by France to the disadvan
tage of any future cable communication between
France anst tl|e United States which may be pro
jected and accomplished by onr citizens. An Im
portant reduction of the present rates of cable
communication with Europe, feitto be too burden
some to tne interests of our commerce, muse nec
essarily flaw from tbe establishment of this com
peting line.
Tbe attention of congress was drawn to the pro
priety of some general regulation by congress of
the whole subject of transmarine cables by my
predecessor in his message of December 7th, 1875,
and I respectfully submit to your consideration
the importance of congressional action in this
matter.
OTHER FOREIGN MATTERS.
The question of grave importance with Spain,
growin* out of the incidents of the Cuban insur
rection have been, lor the most part, happily and
honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticl
pate.l that the commission now sitting in Wash
ington, for the decision of private eases in this
connection, will soon be able to bring its labors to
a conclusion.
Tbe lonar standing question of East Florida!
claims has lately been renewed as a subject of cor
respondence, and may possibly require congres
sional action for its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands, with respect to
consular rights and privileges, similar Jo .those
with other powers, has been signed and ratified,
and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st
of July last. Negotiations for extradition treat
ies with the Netherlands and with Denmark are
now in progress.
Soma questions with Switzerland, in regard to
^pauper and convict emigrants, have arisen, but it
is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a
just and satisfactory basis. A question has also
occurred with respect to on asserted claim by
Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage
.over'persons and property of Swiss citizens natur

With the German empire frequent questions
arise in connection with the subjects of naturali
zation and expatriation but the imperial govern
ment has constantly manifested a desire to strict
ly maintain and comply with all treaty stipula
tions in regard to them.
In consequence of the omiseion of congress to
provide for a diplomatic representative at Athens,
tho legation to Greecc has been withdrawn.
There is now no channel of diploinotic communi
cation between the two countries, and the expedi
ency of providing for one, in some form, is sub
mitted to congress.
Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy. Portugal,
Turkey, and Belgium continue amicable, and
marked by no incident of especial importance.
A change of the personal head of the govern
ment of Kgypt has taken place. No change, how
ever, has occurred in the relations between Egypt
and the United States. The action of the Egyp
tian government in presenting to the city of New
York one of the ancient obelisks, which possess
such historic interest, is highly appreciated as a
generous mark of international regard. If pros
perity should attend the enterprise of its trans
portation across the Atlantic, its erection in a
conspicious position in the chief commercial city
o£ the nation will soon be accomplished.
The treaty recently made between Japan and
the United States in regard to the revision of for
mer commercial treaties, it is now believed will
be followed by similar action on the part of other
treaty powers. The attention of congress is again
invited to the subject of the indemnity funds re
ceived some years since, from Japan and China,
which, with their accumulated interest, now
amount to considerable sums. If any part of
these funds is justly due to American citizens
they should receive it promptly and whatever
may have been received by this government in ex
cess of strictly just demands, should in some form
be returned to the nations to whom it equitably
belongs.
The government of China has signified its wiT
llngness to consider the question or
the emigration
of its subjects to the United states with a alsptts
slonato fairness, and to co-operate In such meas
ures a3 may tend to prevent
injurious consequenc
es to the United Stctes. The negotiations arc still
proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.
A question having arisen between China and
Japau about the Lew chew Islands, the United
States government lias taken measures to inform
those powers of

readiness to extend
its
good of­
fices for the inalntenanco of peace, if they Shall
mutually deem ft desirable, and find it practlcablo
to avail themselves of tbe proffer,
It is a gratification to bo able to announco that,
through tho judicious and energetic action of the
military commanders of the two nations on each
side of the Rio tirsude, under the instructions of
their respective governments, raids and depreda
tions have greatly decreased, and, in the localities
where formerly most destructive, have now almost
wholly ceated. In view of this result, I entertain
a confident expectation that the prevalence of
quiet on the border wilt soon become so assured as
to justify a modification of tbe present orders to
our military commanders as to crossing the bor
der, without encouraging such disturbances as
would endanger the peace of the two countries.

was duly paid, and has been put in course of dis
tribution in pursuance cf .the act of congress pro
viding for the same. This satisfactory situation
between the two countries leads me to anticipate
expansion of our trade with Mexico and an in-,
creased contribution of capital and industry by
our people to the development of the great re
sources of that country. I earnestly commend to*
the wisdom of congress the provision of suitable
legislation looking to this result.
SOUTH AMSIUCAN STATES.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again
ful!y restored by the arrival of a minister from
that counrry to the United States. This is espe
cially fortunate in view of the fact that the ques
tion of an lntcr-oceanic canal has recently as
sumed anew and important aspect, and is" now
under discussion with the Central American
countries through whose territory tbe canal, by
tbe Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is
trusted tbat enlightened statesmanship on
their part will see that the early prosecution of
such a work will largely enure to the benefit, not
only of their own citizens and those of the United
States, but or the commcrce of the civilized world.
It is not doubted that should the work be under
taken under the protective auspices of the United
States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the
right of way, and Is security, by the Central
•American governments, the capital for Ha com
pletion would be readily furnished from this coun
try and Europe, which might, failing such guar
antees, prove inaccessible.
Diplomatic relations with Chill have also been
strengthened by tbe reception of a minister ffom
that country.
The war between Pern, Bolivia, and Chill, still
continues* The United (Hates have not deemed
it proper to interpose in the matter, farther than
to convey to all the governments concerned, tho
assurance tbat the friendly offices ot the govern
ment of the United States for the restoration cf
fn
ieace upon an honorable basis will be extended.
case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness
to aecept them.

Cordial relations continue with Brazil acd the
Argentine Republic, and trade with those coun
tries is improving. A provision for regular and
more frequent mail communication, in our own
phlps, between the ports of this country and the
nations of South America seems to me to deserve
the attentiotvof congress, as an essential precur
sor of an enlargement of onr commerce with
them, and an extension of our carrying trade.
A recent revolution in Vetizuela has been fol
lowed by the establishment of a provisional gov
ernment. This government has not been Airntal
ly recognized, and-it is deemed desirable to await
jtbe proposed action of the people, which Is expect
ed to glvo it the sanction of constitutional forms.
A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan
Islands, to maca survey aslttta possession of
the privileges ceded to tho United utates by Sa
moa, in tbe harbor of Pago Pago. A
Coaling-sta­
tion Is to'be established there, which will be con
venient and useful to United States
vessels.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with Roumauia and Servia, now become inde
pendent sovereignties. Is at present-under con
sideration, and Is the subject of diplomatic cor
respondence.
There is a gratifying Increase of trade with
nearly alt Knropean and American countries, and
it is believed tbat with judicious action in regard
to its developement it can and will be still more
enhanced, and' that American products and man
ufactures will find new and expanding markets.
The reports of diplomatic and consular officers
upon this subject, under the system now adopted,
have resulted in obtaining much valuable tafbr
mation, which has bern and will continue to be
laid before congress and the public from time to
time.
