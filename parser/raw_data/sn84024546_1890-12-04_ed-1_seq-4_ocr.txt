PITTSBURG. THURSDAY. DEC. 4. 189a
ORGANIZE roil THE CANAL!
What the State and what the National
Government will do for our proposed ship
canal to Lake Erie must remain ret awhile
a subject of conjecture. What AVestern
Pennsylvania, and, particularly, what Pitts
burs will do is, however, of primary im
portance. Providence is very good to those
who help themselves. Assuming a ship
canal is practicable at anything near the
estimated cost of 23,000,000, it behooves
our manufacturers, our merchants and our
real estate owners to begin figuring out
what it will be worth to the annual trade of
this city.
As The DisrATCH has abundantly
demonstrated, this work is of great im
portance to the Federal Government. It is
as fit for Federal aid as a score of under
takings for which liberal appropriations are
ordered year after year in the River and
Harbor bill. That it is of vase interest to
the State is also clear. But it is above all
of direct interest to Pittsburg, so much so
that four per cent interest on the total cost
would represent but a small part of the an
nual benefits to this city alone.
Pittsburg and AVestern Pennsylvania can
present a powerful claim for State and
rational help to construct the canal. But
there must be earnest organization in the
premises, ilie nest authority so tar indi
cates that besides affording cheaper and even
more rapid transportation than now exists,
the ship canal will pay handsome interest on
the cost of construction over and above
operating expenses. The most the State or
the National Government may be asked for
in the end is likely to be a guarantee of
bonds to be used for construction, which will
take care of themselves when the canal
opens. If the people whose industries,
merchandizing and real estate will receive
millions of benefit are active, and them
selves willing to back up part of the guaran
tee and work for the rest, there will he little
trouble in getting Government aid. But it
is now time to wake up and take hold of the
project in earnest.
TErE BILLS FOR BRIBERS.
The true bills returned against three of
the men charged with bribery in the Twenty
.fifth Congressional District Conrent'on, is a
satisfactory evidence that such scandals as
this are not to pass wtthout notices. It
should be noted that the very summary talk
of the Judge in dealing with a recusant wit
ness who refused to testify before the grand
jury, has contributed materially to this re
sult. The strenuous efforts which have been
made to keep this scandal from getting be
fore the courts only emphasizes the import
ance that it shall be fully tried, and if the
bribery is proved, that those engaged in it
should be severely punished. One grand
jury has ignored the case, after what W3s
afterward shown to be a farcical investiga
tion; but the present proceedings are evi
dently inspired by more energetic and
honest motives.
Bribery in politics must be made the sub
ject of severe punishment wherever it ap
pears, and in this case it is satisfactory to
tee that the point is reached where the
offense must be either disproved or pun
ished. THE HUDSON AND WESTERN BITERS.
An interview in the Albany Argus with
the State Engineer of New York, on the
subject of the proposed Hudson river im
provement, noticed in these columns the
other day, puts the matter in a rather ques
tionable light by alleging unjust treatment
for that stream. It alleges that from 1877 to
1882 the United States had expended but
f 145.000 on the Hudson river, while the ex
penditures on the Mississippi in the same
period were Sj,3G2,000, and on the Ohio and
Missouri rivers about 81,450,000 each. As
the commerce of the Hudson is three times
greater than that of the 3Iississippi, and so
much greater than that of the Ohio and
3Iissouri combined, according to the asser
tion of the State Engineer, he thinks the
proportion unjust. Why figures are not
given since 1882 maybe left to conjecture.
This way of putting it calls for the criti
cism that the justice of the expenditures for
the improvement of navigation depends
upon the extent and capacity of the water
ways to be improved and the need for such
improvement. AVith that principle in view
it is pertinent to note that the length of the
Hudson river, between Albany and New
York, is but about 140 miles; while the Ohio
is nearly a thousand miles in length, and
the Mississippi and Missouri, in their navi
gable parts, 2,500 each. This overwhelming
difference in the extent of the various streams
accounts for a great share of the difference
if expenditures.
But a more decisive criterion is famished
by the need for improvement. The Hudson
is naturally navigable for sea-going vessels
to the town of Hudson, and for steam and
canal boats to Albany and Troy. All the
expenditures on the Ohio, Missouri and
Mississippi traversing the borders of seven
teen States, are designed to give only a rea
sonably permanent channel of actually less
depth than the Hudson enjoys in the first
place. With these facts properly appre
ciated it will be apparent that the vast dif
ference inlthe importance of the subjects is
greater than the difference of expenditures
concerning which tne New York State En
gineer makes his seeming complaint.
With regard to the relative importance of
the commerce on the respective streams, we
think the State Engineer must be the victim
of statistical misinformation. If we are
not mistaken, the tonnage of the Ohio river
alone, being some six or seven millions,
equals if it does not exceed that of the Hud
son river; although the value ol the corn-
merce on the latter stream probably rivals
that of the entire Mississippi basin. "We
need not dispute upon this point however,
because we desire to recognize the magnifi
cant proportions and national importance of
the commerce of New York's canal and
river system. This is a spjendid and con
vincing proof ol the wisdom of maintain
ing the policy originated by DeAVitt Clin
ter, and preserving those water ways while
other States have permitted their water
ways to fall into disuse. .
A State that has done to much as New
York has to maintain a national water way
at its own expense, has a good claim upon
the Government for aid to such a work as
extending the deepwater channel to Albany
and Troy. But it does not seem a very dis
creet way of furthering that claim to be
gin, ss the State Engineer does, by antagon
izing the improvement of the rivers of the
entire Mississippi basin.
PATTISON AND THE BANK DEPOSITS.
The recent statement of political gossip in
Philadelphia, that Governor Pattison will
retain his bank presidency while assuming
public office, evokes a comment from the
Philadelphia Press as follows:
If true, it is evident the Governor lias con
cluded that he will have no use' for the Con
stitutional opinions of prospective Attorney
General Hensel, who not long ago made a
great fuss because the banking firm in which
Senator Delamater is interested had some of
the State funds on deposit. If the Constitu
tion applied to Senator Detamater's case, as
Hensel claimed it did, it will apply with equal
force to Governor Pattison after he has taken
the oath of office, unless the large deposit of
State funds now held in his hank is with-
drawn.
The Tress farther says that it would be a
grotesque development to see the Governor,
while retaining the State deposits for his
bank conferring the law office of the Ad
ministration on the man who has directed
public attention to the illegality of such a
course. It might justly be considered so,
if it had not been declared by numerous
eminent lawyers of Philadelphia, and the
editorial columns of the Press, that the con
stitutional provision against that practice
does not mean what it says, but really
means little or nothing at all.
Nevertheless the criticism of the Press is
of the sort that contains a good deal ot
pertinence when the Governor takes the
course that is reported. Probably the Press
is wise in seizing the opportunity to deliver
itself of its criticism, before the action of the
Governor has taken the ground out from
under it. The Dispatch pretends to no
political or personal intimacies of the en
tourage of the Governor-elect which enable
it to speak by his authority. But it has en
joyed the advantage of an acquaintance with
his political and his public record for the
past eight years; and the information thus
gained is enough to warrant a decisive
statement that the above report is entirely
without foundation.
The record and the character of the Governor-elect
make it certain that he is neither
so foolish or so insincere as to remain as the
President of a Stale depository after becoming
Governor. When he is inaugurated he will
either retire from the Presidency of the
Chestnut Street National Bank, or.that in
stitution will give up the State deposits.
As the latter are probably of more import
ance to the bank than a President who could
give no attention to its affairs, and as Gov
ernor Pattison is not the kind of man to re
tain the responsibilties of a place that he
cannot attend to, it may be taken as a fore
gone conclusion that the bank will elect a
new President at its next annual meeting.
PARADOXES FROMBANK BUNS.
Speaking of what seems to have been an
entirely causeless and foolish run on the
solvent Keystone National Bank, of Phila
delphia, the Record, of that city, remarks
that the depositors "who did not have use
lor their money should have first assured
themselves that the bank was not in a con
dition to pay its debts." The purpose of
the Record's advice is unexceptionable, bnt
when the pnblic is able to learn that a bank
is not in a condition to pay its debts, a sus
pension is necessary, and the advice that
they should not draw out their money until
they cannot get it out is not likely to have
much weight with the depositors. The story
of the scared depositor who did not want
his money if the bank could pay it, but if
the bank could not pay it then he wanted it
like everything, is familiar, but the -Record
has supplied the obverse of the medal. Both
views are natural, and both are exceedingly
paradoxical.
ANOTHER RUSSIAN CRIME.
A meeting was held in New York, as
chronicled in The Dispatch yesterday, to
protest against the execution of Sophie
Gunsberg, a young Russian condemned to
death on suspicion of being a Nihilist, and
resolutions were passed entreating the Rus
sian Government to modify the sentence.
To the same end Secretary Blaine was
memorialized. But the Russian Govern
ment was not to be robbed of its prey. The
cable informs us that the luckless young
woman, who seems to have been tried and
condemned on the patent Russian plan
without even a show of justice, much less
mercy, was executed privately by night
some time ago. One more assassination
does not count for much in Russia, but it
will be avenged in time no doubt. The
atrocities with which the explorers of the
Dark Continent of Africa recently shocked
the whole world are nothing beside the
crimes committed everyday by the rulers of
Russia in the name of political expediency.
NO NEED FOR A SCARE
Some of our Eastern cotemporaries, evi
dently with the intention of stimulating ap
propriations for the building of coast de
fenses, are renewing the scare about the ease
with which naval force could lie off our
principal seaports and reduce them to ashes
by a bombardment at long range. The Dis
patch has heretofore signified its approval
ot an intelligent and well-considered policy
of coast defenses; but it is unnecessary to
raise a scare, both because the sensation is
injudicious and because fortifications built
in obedience to the dictates of panic would
be of very little use.
The best evidence that there is no need of
panic over the defenseless condition of our
seaboard cities is to be found in the fact
that it has lasted for fifteen years, during
which time there has not been a month
in which every power of the world
of sufficient naval strength to send
a fleet across the ocean would not
have rejected promptly any proposition to
attack and plunder our cities. Any Gov
ernment which would attemnt such an
enterprise would lose far more in its own
commerce, to say nothing of the enmity it
would arouse by destroying our commerce
with other nations, than it could gain in
plunder. By providing a moderate fleet of
swift cruisers, we can insure that the enter
prise of attacking our seaports by foreign
fleets will be as profitless as it is'unpopular.
Beyond that it is worth while 10 remem
ber that the policy of keeping out of foreign
quarrels and treating all other Governments
with decent fairness will do more to con
tinue the safety of our.seacoasU indefinitely
than fifty or a hundred millions of expend
itures on coast defenses can do.
FARMERS AND THETORCE BILL.
AVhile it may be true that the members of
the Farmers' Alliance are very much
divided as to their official programme, there
are plain indications that they are agreed
upon some points. The Eepublican major
ity in Congress' may well study the news
which comes from the Alliance's convention
to-day, to the effect that the delegates one
and all denounce the Federal Elections bill.
The farmers have no liking for the measure
that has earned the ugly and unlucky title
of the Force bill. AVe should not be sur
prised if the attitnde of the Farmers' Al
liance upon this question should temper
any enthusiasm for Mr. Lodge's scheme
that the President's message may have re
awakened. JUSTICE TO AUTHORS.
It is probable at last that honesty may
rule in the international book of this coun
try. The international copyright bill was
passed by the House of Representatives yes
terday, and as the Senate approved the
principle at the last session, and the Presi
dent commended it in his message, authors
here and abroad will soon be permitted to
enjoy the fruits of their own industry and
invention. In short, American and foreign
writers are at last on a level with the
butchers and bakers and candlestickmakers.
For which superb if somewhat tardy relief,
the literary craft should be deeply grateful
to tne House ot itepresentauves, wuo aione
have opposed the measure heretofore.
Mr. Ddxsell's plan of making the
membership of the next House 354 is supported
by the New York Press, because Mr. Springer's
plan would mako New York loss two repre
sentatives. In other words, the esteemed Press
would prefer to have the present unwieldly size
of the House aggravated rather than have New
York lose in membership in common with th
rest of the country. This 13 not national legis
lation, bnt an attempt to influence legislation
on narrow local lines. When politics rise above
such petty considerations, some House will
make an apportionment cutting down the mem
bership of the House to about 230 and let all of
the States lose about 20 per cent of their mem
bership in common.
It is pleasant to learn that Jay Gould's
first experience was in securing a chromo share
certificate in which be invested 230 in New
Hampshire gold .mines, and still has the
chromo. Mr. Gould has smco then succeeded
in inducing a large number of people to share
his experience, and there is reason to believe
that his output of chromo securities has fully
equaled his investment in them.
The mix-up in that South Carolina Con
gressional district is explained by the Philadel
phia limes to be due to the fact that "Mr. Mil
ler (the Republican candidate), in order to
force the colored voters to vote for him or to
incur the vengeance of their race leaders, haa
his tickets printed of smaller size and on tinted
paper, so that every vote cast tor him could be
recognized by all present before it was depos
ited." AVe are glad to be assured on this Dem
ocratic authority that South Carolina has
reached that ttage of political enlightenment
where the use of marked, tinted or tissue bal
lots is forbidden to tne Republicans.
Mb. Eugene Field and other pundits
are discussing the profound problem why the
English people called Disraeli. Earl of Beacons
field, "Dizzy." They do not, however, get
down to the fundamental tact that he was
called "Dizzy" because his rapid changes of
political front made the other fellows so.
It is rather interesting to find the New
York Press enlarging upon the statement of
Valerian de Gribayedoff, as a new historical
discovery, that a French force under Humbert
landed in Ireland in 179S and waR rantnrr1 lw
I Cornwallis after a three months' campaign.
The historical trnth of the statement is toler
ably correct, but as a detailed story of the ex
pedition was made a part of Charles Lever's
"Maurice Tiernay," over thirty years ago, the
novel feature of it is to be told that it is a new
historical discovery. -
The Republican advocates of the style
of "vindication" that is obtained by carrying
elections and primaries may get new light on
its value from the fact that Breckenridge, of
Arkansas, is the ono man who has been vindi
cated that way.
We find the genial Eugene Field declar
ing that the claims of superiority for the
climate of the Old World are air sham, and the
climate is not to be compared with that of
America, because during the month of June
last, in England, he found that it rained 17 days
out of the thirty. If Eugene would come
home long enough to get acquainted with our
present climate, he would discover that it 'has
reached that pitch in which a month cannot lay
claim to any especial weather unless it rains 35
days out of SO.
Peop. Elliot's proposition that seal
catching shall be suspended for seven years will
be approved by every man with a wife and grown
up daughters, with the added proviso that seal
skin buying shall also be suspended for the
same period.
Touching the report that the Legis
lature of Florida had offered Mr. William
Astor a Senatorship for $250,000, the Buffalo
Courier declares that "it does not believe that
he could buy a Senatorship in the Democratic
State of Florida for that sum or any other
sum." AVe approve the belief, but the inti
mation that Democratic supremacy prevents
the sale of Senatorships evinces a lack of ac
quaintance with the Democratic Legislature of
Ohio.
Mb. Dockery's resolution to investigate
the alleged Congressional speculation in silver
is a proper move. The probing of this matter
might give us new light on the motives which
influence Silver legislation.
The New York Herald alleges that in the
present House of Representatives "a majority
couldn't De held together long enough to pass
the Ten Commandments without a resolution
to amend by knocking out the word 'not' in the
passage 'Thou shalt not steal."' But what
good would it do to have the House pass the
Ten Commandments, when Ingalls would rule
them out of order when they wer ftent up to
the Senate? f v

THE TOPICAL TALKEfU
An Operatic Talisman.
"Ythenever I want to change my luck,"
said a Plttsburger, yesterday, "I go to
see an opera, if there's one within reach."
"Does the harmony soothe your troubled soul,
or how do you figure it out?" ,
"No, it isn't the harmony exactly, and I'd be
pnzzled to tell you what the precise method is,"
said the first speaker a man, by the way, you'd
never dream of having a superstitious
streak in his nature. "But the plan has
never failed since 5 tried it sixteen years
ago, I think it was, in Detroit. I was
a printer In those days, a plain everyday type
sticker, and I dare say some people would have
called me a tramp printer at that. Things had
gone very badly with jne in Detroit, although
that town has a pretty good reputation among
printers. I'd been 'subbing around at the
different offices, taking what work 1 could get
aud hoping in vain to get a case steady. But a
week came that even 'subbing' that is, taking
another compositor's case for a night was de
nied me, and my stock of cash was' reduced to
about fonr dollars, three ot which I owed ior
board. Well, 1 paid my board bill, ana after
eating the last meal coming to me,
which was supper, I walked out to pass away
what I meant should bo my last evening in
Detroit. 1 intended to start to walk back to
Toledo, where I had more friends, the next day.
1 had less than a dollar in my clothes, but I was
young and very sanguine, and when I saw some
bills in a store announcing that some opera
troup or other was (joins to play "Girofle-
Girofla" at the theater that night, I made up
my mind I would go to see it, I spent 50 cents
for a seat, and had, to be exact, just 32 cents
left between me and bankruptcy. But that
didn't prevent me enjoying a tolerably good
performance of that merry opera comiqne.
"Walking back to my room, I confess I felt
rather blue, for the morrow did not promise
well. It was raining, and though late in the
spring, the roads between Detroit and Toledo
bade fair to be bad walking. AVhen I got to my
room I found a note which had boen left for me
during my absence. I laughed as I opened It,
because it struck me that it was probably a pe
tition for a loan from some companion in dis
tress. But it wasn't. Instead it was from the
foreman of the composing room in which I
had worked most of tho time, telling me that
he had a case for me and permanent work if I
wanted it. It is only nccessaiy to add that
when I did leave Detroit some months later I
rode in a Pullman palace car. Since then
whenever things have gone wrong with me I
have hunted up an operatic show, with good re
sults invariably."
Their Strong Point,

A Change In Washington.
iiThkee is one thing that impresses me more
in AVashington," said a lady of this
city who spends a large part of the year
at tho Capital, "than the improved
streets, the handsome new buildings,
or even the army of women on bicycles, and
that is the wonderfnl change that has come
over the stores in tho last ten years. AVhen 1
first spent a season in AVashington, in 1879-SO,
it was absurd how little a woman could get in
the stores there. If you wanted a half yard of
rucbingyou had to send away for it, and for
drygoods, laces, and, of course, for dressmaking,
tho nearest stores tor a AVashington woman
were in Baltimore. It must be admitted
that it you wanted jewelry, diamonds
especially, you could get the very best in
AVashington always, but even a fashionable
woman cannot dress with precious stones
alone. Now we have changed all that, and the
stores of all sorts in AVashington are equal to
any you can find in New York, Philadelphia or
Pittsburg. 1 believe it is largely the result of
the growing fashion of Congressmen of taking
their families to the Capital, and also to the
influx of a resident class of wealthy people
from all the great cities."

A World's Fair in Asia.
Chicago Tribune.!
Few people in this country are aware of the
fact that within the last two months a great
fair has been held at Tashkend, the capital of
Russian Turkestan. The exhibition included
tho display of products of tho vast Central
Asian region and was in many ways a remark
able enterprise. Perhaps its chief interest,
however, lies in tho evidence it gave of the ori
ental submission to Western influence. An en
deavor to consummate such an enterprise 20
years ago met with ridiculous failure. Now,
with the increase of interrelationships, it has
been carried through successfully, the Turks
slowly acceding to the propositions of the dom
inant races, which are gradually extending
their sway, together with their railroads, into
the darkest of the unenlightened nations.

NATIONAL AND CITY GOVERNMENT.
Would-be Reformers Will Advocate That
Both Should Conform to One "Plan.
Tho wort of the Municipal Congress this
year, said a memberto a representative of the
Cincinnati Post, will be first to agitate the call
ing of a national convention to change our na
tional Constitution. There are many changes
that shonld be made which we will call atten
tion to, such as the election of President and
Senators by popular vote, tho abolition of the'
electoral college, and the governmental control
of all railroads, etc. To secure this convention
we will call the attention of the States to this
matter and urgo them to. vote for it.
In this Slate wo will urge chiefly the adop
tion of a uniform plan of municipal govern
ment on the Federal plan. Make this as an
amendment to the Constitution, to be adopted
by the vote of the people; so frame it that no
change can be made by the Legislature without
a direct vote of the people. Let the general
plan bo modified to suit the different corpora
tions, but hold tho central principle of making
the Mayor the head of the government. The

THE ALLIANCEJN POLITICS.
A Distinction' and. a Difference.
Chicago Inter Ocean (Kep. )
Between tbe Farmers' Alliance and Indus
trial Union, now in session at Ocala, Fla., and
the National Farmers' Alliance there is a dis
tinction with a difference. The first is a South
ern organization which has gone into politics
on party lines, and has achieved some measure
of success. The National Farmers' Alliance,
on tbe other hand, is a political but not a parti
san body. Organized in the Northern States,
having free scope for its action upon two great
parties, accorded the utmost freedom of
speech, existing in a section of the Union
where every man reads, and where every corner
grocery in tho country is a center of political
debate, tho National Farmers' Alliance can
avoid thosejocks and shoals of tbird-partyisra
upon which the Southern organization is all
but sure to be wrecked.
Old TartiesNeed Not Fear.
Washlneton Post (Dcm.)
There is no reason why any members of the
old political parties, whose patriotism is greater
than their partisanship, should look upon the
new movement with suspicion, much less with
fear. Some individual ambitions may, indeed,
bo distnrned, but a greater good to a greater
number may be gained. The farmers of tho
country have fully as large an interest inits
welfare and prosperity as any other class of
citizens. They are eminently sensible, practical
and patriotic. They will not long adhere to a
policy which develops a mischievious tendency.
The Alliance movement, therefore, in giving a
fresh impetus to political action, may lead to a
needed revision of old theories and methods,
may have an influence on the correction of
some abuses and may do something toward
giving practical effect to tbe doctrine that a
Government by tbe people is for the people.
Legislation Not tho Only Cure.
Philadelphia Press (Kep.)
The ultimate success of the Farmers' Alfianco
rests not so mnch in present political action as
in the thorough education of its followers in
economic and social subjects. Many of the
disadvantages under which tbe agricultural
classes labor spring more from lack of informa
tion than from lack of legislation. Their
greatest grievances cannot be cured by political
action. Cheap money and plenty of it will not
bring any larger returns to shabby farming,
and the control of a Governorship or a Legisla
ture will not make prosperous a class that dis
regards economic principles.
Not the Tariff, but the Money Question.
Toledo Blade (Kep.)
The Democratic papers, without a single ex
ception, are assuming that tbe newly-elected
Alliance members of the next House are Dem
ocrats politically, and that they will vote as
such on all tariff legislation that may come up
in that Congress. In this they are, we think,
bauly mistaken. Secretary Rlttenhouse, of
the National Alliance, writing from the na
tional headquarters in Washington City, de
clared that be received hundreds of letters
from subordinate organizations of tho Alliance
which show that it was the money question,
and not the tariff issue, that caused the nom
ination and election of so many Alliance can
didates for Congress.
A Most Important Gathering.
Boston Herald (Ind.)
That it is an important gathering need not be
said. Three newly-elected Governors, several
Congressmen-elect, and representative men
from every State in tbe Union are among its
members. It assembles tresh from decided
victories at tbe ballot-box, and no one. unless it
be- a "mossback" politician, blinded by the
glamour and emolumentsof power.can close his
eyes to the possibilities which lie in the pro
ceedings of the Alliance.
Alliance's Political Fitness Questioned.
Brooklyn Citizen (Dem.)
Because the farmers have declared their in
dependence and shown their goodsense in the
recent elections, it does not follow that it would
be wise for them to form a third party, or that
they have demonstrated their fitness as an
organization to take on themselves all the
functions of government.
The South Not In It.
AtlantsJournal (Dem.)
The Farmers' Alliance has absolutely nothing
to gain by going into a third party, and it will
not go into a third party so far as tbe South is
concerned.
REPUBLICAN HARMOHY.
Likelihood That the Factions in the Empire
State AA'Ul Unite.
New Y'ork Post.
There is likelihood that the Republican party
in tbe State will soon be united, that the differ
ences between '.he Piatt and Miller factions
will be settled, and that the party will present
a solid front in the Gubernatorial campaign of
1891. Ex-Senator Piatt has recently returned
from AVashington, whither he went to back up
tho demand of the ReouDlican County Execu
tive Committee for the removal of Colonel Joel
B. Erhardt from tbe Collectorship of tbe Port
of New York. Ex-Senator AVarner Miller has
also just returned from Washington, whither
he went to oppose the demand for Colonel Er
hardt's removal. Both were at tbe capital at
tbe invitation of President Harrison, who,
after receiving from Jacob M. Patterson,
Chairman of tho County Executive Committee,
a letter demanding Colonel Erbardt's removal.
and from ex-Senator Miller and several of bis
supporters, letters demanding Colonel Er
bardt's retention, all of which indicated a con
tinuance of the warfare that has already dam
aged the Republican party in this State, re
solved to bring the leaders of the two factions
together, and, if possible, induce them to patch
up a peace.
In that effort, it is slid by a trustworthy per
son, the President has been partly successful.
A conference between tbe chief leaders of the
Flatt and Miller factions will be held in this
city within a short time, at whicb, it is ex
pected, all differences will be settled, or at least
set aside for a time, and a plan for the cam
paign of 1891 be evolved- Ex-Senators Piatt
and Miller, Senator Hiscock, Colonel Erhardt,
Senator Fassett, Congressman James J. Belden,
ChaunceyM. Depew. Postmaster Van Cott,
Louis F. Payne. General Husted and ex-Congressman
James S. Smart are among those
who, it is expected, will attend the conference.
Many of these persons are now in tbe city.

Our Mainstay In the Pacific
From the Philadelphia Press.
The Hawaiian reciprocity treaty is a bulwark
and mainstay of the influence of the United
States in the Pacific, and any omission to recog
nize the special privileges granted by the treaty
in the McKinley tariff shonld be promptly
amended by Congress. The national honor and
the national policy are both involved in such
action, which ought, and we trust will, bo
passed without objection by anyone on either
side in Congress.

' THE OLD FLAME REVIVED.
A Wedding With a Dash of Old-Timo Ro
mance About It.
IFItOH A STAFF COKBESPOMDEKT.
Washington, Dec 3. A wedding, with a
bit of somewhat dramatic romance in it, took
place in Christ Church. Georcetown, to-day,
when Miss Annie Hunter, of Virginia, was
married to Rev. Dr. Henry J. Davis, an emi
nent Presbyterian divine. It was over 30 years
ago when the lovers first met, and then Annie
Hunter was a pretty, red-cheeked maid, be
longing to a well-known Virginia family. That
was before the war. when tbe hospitable Vir
ginia planters kept open honse. and when a
houseful of guests was an every-day occur
rence. Annie Hunter happened to be visiting
at tbe homo of her bosom friend during a Pres
byterian convention in tbo village. Tbe minis
ters were .scattered about at the different
bouses, and among tbe guests at this particnlar
mansion was a youngtbeological student, who
had just passed bis examination for the minis
try, and the brilliancy of bis examination was
the talk of tbe whole country round about.
Ha was as handsome as he was bright. He re
mained long enough to become quite fascinated
with pretty Annie Hunter, ana for her friend
to fall in love with him.
Neither of these facta were known, however,
until later. A week or so after his departure.
Annie Hnnter received a letter from the young
minister. It was a great surprise to the girl,
for. while it did not contain a proposal exactly,
it was so worded as to mean that, if replied to
in a similar sphit. It took Miss Hunter only
about two days to realize that she was really
In love with tbe handsome yonng man and she
proceeded to write a reply. While engaged in
the pleasant task, her intimate friend entered
Annie's room. Discovering that she was writ
ing a letter, she offered to post it. Annie said
she would give it to a post boy, but the friend in
sisted, and secured the letter to carry it to the
office.
No answer ever came, and the girl's pride
suffered a terrible blow, but she crushed out
all remembrance of the matter as far as she
could. Years passed. She read of the marriage
of the young minister and his brilliant success.
Recently there was a Presbyterian Assembly in
Winchestsr, which was attended by the Rev.
Dr. Davis, a more than middle-aged minister.
He heard In some way that Annie Hunter was
in tbe neighborbood and wrote a polite note,
asking permission to call to renew an old
friendship. The request was granted. The
minister came. He aid not find the pretty girl
who won his heart over 3u vears aco. hut his
old love was reawakened. Annie then learned
for the first time of tbe letter that never came.
It did not take long for them to come to an un
derstanding. They were married to-day.
SAWDUST KILLING SALMON.
A Higlily Interesting Explanation of How
the Injury Works.
From the Cathlament (Ore.) Gazette.3
It has been proved beyond a doubt that tho
promiscuous dumping of sawdust into the
water is very detrimental to the salmon. Sal
mon, after leaving tbe ocean to spawn, never
eat anything while in the river. On opening
thousands of them, it is found they have noth
ing in their stomachs and intestines.
Nature has provided for this abnormal ab
stinence from food by giving them an extra
amount of tat as a reserve to draw upon, which
is consumed while on their way to the spawn
ing grounds. In examining fish that have been
killed by sawdust, it is found that tbe fine par
ticles of wood that have been swallowed in the
water lodge in the gullet and abdominal cavi
ties and clog them up, instantly killing tbe fish
The greater percentage of fat found in
Columbia river fish over those of any otber
river is accounted for on the grounds that the
much longer distance the fish have to travel,
over those of salmon of other rivers, before
reaching tbe spawning grounds,makes this wise
provision of nature a very necessary requisite
in tbe life of a fish.
EX-GOVERNOR EORAKER'S FUTURE.
He Dopes for the Senatorship, hut Not for
Presidents! or Gubernatorial Honors.
From tbe Washington l'ost.l
Tbe returning Republican members from
Ohio bring some interesting gossip, about ex
Governor Foraker, about whom very little has
been heard of late. The Governor is said to
have settled down to his law practice, which is
growing to such dimensions that he will become
a wealthy man.
"He has become more prudent in his speech,"
said a prominent Ohio Republican yesterday,
"and is not likely to make any more sensational
remarks. He has given up tbe idea of securing
the Presidental nomination and he believes, as
every one else concedes, that Mr. McKinley will
be the next Governor of Ohio. Governor For
aker is laying wires for the Senatorship to suc
ceed Mr. Sherman. That is now his only politl- 1
cal ambition."
