LETMW,of Pierre, was arrest
ed two months ago by the chief of
Police at Pierre for being found in a
bouse of ill-repute and fined $25 and
sentenced to 25 days in jail. He now,
it is said, has decided to bring suit
against the city for $20,000 damages
to his character. A good round price
for a rusty character.
ALL the harvester and binder manu
facturers have combined in a gigantic
trust. A represenative says this is to
benefit the farmer—perhaps by squeez
ing him harder. Now let the farmers
form a trust and agree to put all their
machinery under cover instead of leav
ing it out in the weather, and they
could seriously effect the other trust.
SEND up your large bills and get
small ones for change. The treasury
department is now prepared to supply
the country with bills of the denoini
nation of $10, $5 and a few of $1 in
exchange for bills of $1,000 denomina
tion and less. The amount of such de
nominations now on hand is about $20,
000,000.
TIIE dispatches say that Postmaster
General Wannamaker has put a $50,
000 mortgage on his Washington prop,
crty. Had he done so be tyre election
Loucks would have made his followers
lielieve that every man, woman or child
who Iniught a postage stamp would
have been contributing 2 cents toward
paying ofT that mortgage. Many more
unreasonable statements were made by
(he Hoodoo managers and believed and
acted upon by their following.
THE Indian news is contradictory.
One day they are reported to be rais
ing— Ned, killing cattle and horses,
destroying settlers, property, and every
thing imaginable, while the next day
the reports are contradicted and vise
verm, so that we can tell but little
about what is being done or what they
intend to do. At army headquarters,
however, it is believed that the Indians
are congretating in the Bad Lands, in
eouthwestern Dakota, for the purpose
«f taking the war-path early in the
spring. The Messiah craze now extends
from the Brittish possessions on the
north to the Indian territory on the
-«outh—all join in the ghost dance and
are very defla it. The Governor and
«»inmanding officers along the Mis
souri river, by proclamation and other
wise, assure the people on the east
aide that no fears of danger from the
Indians crossing the river and commit
tug depravations need be entertained
by the settlers.
TIIK President's Message is not
lengthly, but an able document.
Congressman Cutchcon of Michigan,
wants South Dakota prepared to pro
tect herself and assist the government
Against Indian depredations, so last
Monday introduced a joint resolution
in the House authorizing the Secretary
of War to issue this state 1,000 rifles
and ammunition for the same not to
exceed 50 ball cartridges for each arm.
REPRESENTATIVE Pickler introduced
a bill, Monday, for the free coinage of
gold and silver bullion. It provides
for|the deposit at United States mints
of silver or gold bullion to be formed
into standard dollars or bars for the
benefit of the owners and without
charge and that certificates raty be h
sued as under the act of 1848, and thev
are to be foil legal tender A number
of other similar bills were introduced
by other congrensmen.
DURING the late campaign In this
county it was alleged by some of the
Independents that should certain Re
publican candidates he defeated they
would leave the county at the expira
tion of their present term of office, and
that their candidates were old-timers
and stayers. Let's see bow is it on
their side? Soon after the result of
the election became known the Indc
pendent candidate for County Judge
began to pack up and arrange bis busi
ness to leave and has gone, and Mr
Leverett, their candidate for Auditor,
has gone east to "spend the winter."
None of the defeated Republicans think
of leaving. They are the stayers.

The little stir and war like demon
strations by the Reds on the west sid
of the river has been the means of them
getting increased rations, so that, thev
may be fat and in good fighting trim
when the birds again begin to sing
Last Monday the Secretary of the In
terior directed that the Sioux Indians
be supplied with increased rations
sufficient to conform to the agreement
made in 1877. The appropriations for
the Sioux have decreased every year
upon the supposition that the Indians
were becoming more and more capable
of maintaining themselves. Owing,
however, to the partial failure of crops
for the last year or two and restless
ness of the Sioux, which is believed to
be in a measure due to the reduction
of rations, the secretary has ordered
the increase.
State Canvass.
The State canvassing board, consist
ing of Governor Mellette, Secretary
llingsrud, Judge Corson and Audi
tor Taylor, met at the capitol in Pierre,
Thursday, and canvassed the State re
turns, the result showing that the Re
publicans carried the state by plurali*
ties ranging from 9,806 for Governor
to 13,037 for Superintendent of Public
Instructions, which was the highest
plurality given to any candidate, but
none but the Governor fell below 10,
150. The total Republican vote cast
in the State averages about 35,000
Democratic 18,000, and Independent
24,500. The proposition to raise the
limit of indebtedness to $500,000 was
defeated by 30,859 majority equal
suffrage by 21,610 majority, while the
Indians carried the State by 10,369
majority. Pierre received 41,896 votes
for permanent capital and Huron 34,
252, giving Pierre a majority of 7,644.
The Political Pindoloa.
flows Kail* OltUen.
If
the opinion of editor# and writers are
to be relied upon ax a true Kolution to tin:
puzzle as to why was thin so? at the recent
election, then we should forever be in the
dark, for the mass of opinions are so wide
ly at variance and so conflicting that no
rietinite determination can he drawn.
Perhaps the reason rests on human nature,
that endorses this today and that to mor
row, accept* a theory this year and dis
cards it next. This peculiarity of human
actiou likens it to
a
pendulum, swinging
from extreme to extreme and passing over
all phase of the space between. History
hrini us some vivid examples of this
In 1840 the wldgs elected William Henry
Harrison by a tremendous majority and
they had a majority of 31 Congressmen.
In 1842 the democrats who hud been 8c
S
badly whipped 2 years before
HO
changed
their record that a majority of 71 con
gressmen, almost as bad a rout as they
made on us in the election just past. In
1844 the Democrats elected Polk, but had
a majority of 49 only in congress. 184tt
only two years later, the whigs again car
ried congress by a good working majority.
Two years and in 1148 the whigs elected
Taylor president, but two years later
in 1850 the Democrats had a majority of
52 congressmen. In 1852 the Democrats
elected Franklin Pierce president and
elected 159 congressmen and in 1854 they
only elected 83 congressmen. In 1856 the
democrats elected Buchanan president but
in 1858 the new party just forming, the
Republicans, elected a majority of 27 con
gressmen. And so the record goes.
A careful study of our campaigns will
bear out the pendulum. In 1872 Grant
was elected over Greeley by the highest
majority ever given to any chief execu
live, and yet two years later the democrats
carried congress. On this reasoning then,
hacked by so complete a record, we can
safely predict that in 1892 the Republican
party will sweep the country. And the
cause of it will be the swinging ol the
treat political pendulum.
Dimosrata Claim the Zadsptnints.
Our readers will remember that dur
ing the last campaign the WATCHMAN
stated at different times that the Inde
pendent or Alliance political party was
nothing but a Democratic tnck
to break up the Republican party, and
ultimately strengthen the Democratic
party. This the Democrats denied be.
fore election, but since come out boldly
and father the scheme. The Demo
cratic Congressmen who have recently
returned to Washington claim that the
Alliance membership of the country
look to them for relief, and that they
will get it Mansur, of Missouri, says
they intend to show the farmers be
tween this and the 4th of March that
there is really no need for the Alliance
movement, and that everything they
need can be accomplished by the Demo
crats. He predicts that before the next
presidential campaign opens the Demo
cratic party will have swallowed the
Alliance party and thousands of Re
publicans now acting with them will
have become fb 11 fledged Democrats,
ready to vote for Cleveland in '92. He
says the Alliance-Republicans gener
ally realize that in going into the move
ment they revolted from old party ties.
Indian Forces.
Now that the Indians on our bor
ders are so vigorously preparing to ex
terminate the whites (if dancing by the
month can be considered any serious
preparation) it might be interesting to
our readers to know how many there
are of them to engage in thb little pas
time, so that we may make proper prep
aration too to meet the enemy. The
following is the population as reported
to the government at the different agen

Of these about 6,000 are warriors,
while the government has only 2,000
available men for the field, so (jen.
Miles reports. If such is the case, the
Governors of the Dakotas would le
obliged to call out and arm the militia,
if all the fighting force of the Indians
should take the field. But there is no
probabity of this. Still every precau
tion shoald be taken and preparations
made hy the whole mass of the whites
near the field of danger, so that on the
very first blow being given by the In
dians, they may be met by such over
powering forces as to whip them in at
once.— F". C. Capitol.
CommnnioauA.
The wealth and comfort of a country
is not determined by the per capita of
its currency or promises to pay. That
is determined by the quality and per
capita of acres cultivated. The ma
chinery, buildings, horses, cattle, sheep,
hogs, manufacturing plants, mines,
rail roads, etc., they control.
The money per capita and consequent
expressed value cuts no figure. Eyery
paper dollar in circulation not repre
senting its equivalent coin in the treas
ury is a debt and no amount of polit
ical nonsense can make it otherwise.
Debts are very poor evidence of wealth
and comfort. The Independents claim
that if the currency is increased and
thereby cheapened the farmers will le
the benefited interests because they are
so heavy in debt, but the lumbermen,
miners, merchants, manufacturers, rail
roads and banks arc carrying heavier
per cents of debts than the farmers. In
1888 the total National Rank liabilities
were $1.000,000, and the railroad
liabilities $4,080,000,000, the two in
terests alone making a total of $0,040,
000,000, being about three times the
farm debts of the country. Such a
scheme would relatively be an injur)*
to the farmers. Recently during a con
versation with an esteemed friend who
flopped at the last moment it was urged
that higher expressed values would
benefit the farmers because they are
selling more than they arc buying. If
they are greater sellers than buyers,
and I believe they are, the same can be
said of the other interests, and espe
cially of the railroads and banks, and
whatever is true of all interests will
benefltor injure all alike and leave them
relatively the same as before. 1 can
not see that an increase of the currency
will benefit the farmers more than any
one else, nor that the contraction of it
will injure them more than it will injure
others. The mistake has coine about
by believing the Calamity Jane false
hoods circulated by the opposition par
ties. The Bank debts amount to a
little over 300 per cent, of their stocks,
the railroads to 50 per cent, and farm
debts for the whole country do not
exceed 20 per cent. All the different
productive interests are only so many
parts of our grand industrial bee-hive,
and the money or tariff legislation that
benefits the whole and any such legis
lation that injures one injures the whole.
When it can be proven that a wagon
was driven to town on three of its
wheels doing as good work as usual
while the other wheel remained at home
I will believe the Calamity Jane stuff
about farm depression and manufact
uring boomers. H. O'CONNOR.
