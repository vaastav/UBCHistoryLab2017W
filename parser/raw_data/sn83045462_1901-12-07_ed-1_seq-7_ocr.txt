The Castelberg Credit system has
been a subject of wonder all over
America. Not only have the natu
rally interested jewelers been inter
ested, but merchants in every line of
business everywhere have made it a
point to call, when on their travels, at
the Castelberg houses, either in Bal
timore or Washington,and have ask
ed pertinent questions pertaining to
this system of selling that has revolu
tionized the business of merchandis
ing. The fact that this concern will
open an account with one, simply
having them agree to pay a little
each week or month, as the case may
be, and delivering to them at once
such valuable articles as come within
the range of their stock, makes one
halt for a moment and consider.
Yet such is the case.
The writer called on 'Mr. Robert
Castelberg, the resident partner of the
Castelberg stores, with a curiosity
born of interest. It is well right here
to note an impression that was made
upon the writer on his efitrance.
The door was opened by a uniform
ed boy, and the establishment struck
me at once as one of the neatest and
best kept business houses I had vis
ited. Not a speck of dirt or dust
anywhere. The proverbial Dutch
kitchen would take a back seat when
compared with Castelberg's. The
Silverware, ranged along the walls
in handsome cases, was at its bright
est, looking as if it had that minute
come from the shop of the polisher
and the Diamond and Watch travs
as spick and span as though they
were not subject to the handling of
hundreds every day.
In meeting Mr. Castelberg one is
impressed at once with one of the
reasons of his success. It is his
manner. It is easily understood how
a man who will readily make friends
should meet success more than half
way.
The Immense Stock at Castel
berg's.
Mr. Castelberg was very ready to
be interviewed on his business, and
at once called the writer's attention
to the size of the stock carried.
"We carry one pf the largest stocks
of Dia'monds, Watches, Jewelry and
the like in America. It's a part of
the business to be equipped to meet
every demand that a customer can
make on us. Some want goods that
cost up into the thousands, while
some want pieces of jewelry as low
as a dollar. We cater to all. The
goods you see displayed here only
represent a small part of the whole.
'These three safes are well filed with
Diamonds and Watches and
Brooches, and fronm your own expe
rience of the money that can be put
Into Diamonds you may imagine
what an amount of money these safes
represent."
"How much of a stock, in Igures,
do you carry, and do you always
carry as much as now?"~
"We carry a large stock at all
timea-something over a half a mil
Eion dollars' worth of goodwthe year

we have increased the stock accord
ingly."
The Credit System. -
The writer naturally took up that
all-important subject of credit with
out delay. "We hear cash houses
everywhere talking of what they
call the evident savings to be effected
by buying for cash. That is directly
against your proposition of Credit.
How do you get around it?"
"It's the business of cash houses to
talk cash. They aim for cash trade,
and they must make it a strong fea
ture of their advertising talk in order
to counteract the convenience and
the desirability of buying on credit.
Of course we take the directly oppo
site stand, and the beauty of it is we
are able to prove our side of it, while
the other fellow spends his energy in
talk. We do not want any one to
buy anything here unless he is per
fectly satisfied that he is buying at
least as low as any of these so-called
cash stores can sell him. We are
only too glad to have a prospective
customer make every comparison in
his power. That is our proof, and it
is convincing. Credit would have
little attraction, according to our
way of thinking, if it was not for the
underselling feature. This firm
deals in Jewelry in a way that would
make most other dealers' purchases
look like retail buying. Of course
we have two houses to buy for, and
each house is doing twice to three
times the business of any other store
of its kind in its home city. We also
have agents - who cover the entire
states of Maryland and Virginia, of
fering our goods as cheaply as at this
store here, and selling on credit, too.
The buying alone for such an outlet
enables us to save big percentages
on the most of goods.
Opening Credit Accounts.
"Yes, any one who wishes can
open an account with us, and we de
liver the goods bought when the first
payment is made on them. _I see the
question you would ask and will an
swer it without your putting it into
words. There is a great deal of hu
man nature to be studied in this
business. We can tell who is honest
in their desire to buy of us and agree
to our terms of payment and who is
not."
"How do ~you do it?"
"It is very simple in itself, but very
hard to explain, and is knowledge
that only comes with years of expe
rience. Many others have tried from
time to time to establish a business
similar to ours, but that something
was lacking that was the vital point
of their success. Still, there are other
merchants doing business exactly as
we do in other cities, and we flatter
ourselves that we gave them the
keynote of their success; glad of it,
too."M
The Recent Advance I imeu.a.
The writer had read somnewhere of
the enormous advance in Diamnpp

monds advanced 30% in two years,
and if we had have been so inclined
we could have sold the stock we had
on hand at an advance that would
have made an additional profit for
the house of between 30 and 50%.
We were well stocked-almost over
stocked-for our Mr. Joseph Castel
berg had just returned from abroad
after making one of the biggest dia
mond purchases in the history of the
house. No, we did iot advance
prices--it gave us one of the biggest
advertisements a house ever had.
We sold at the old prices, while
every one else was compelled to ask
the advance, because they were not
so well provided. Of course there
was some luck in our being so well
fixed, but then it happened that way."
The Credit System Offers an In.
vestment Feature.
There is a similarity between the
savings bank and the credit buying
system as explained by Mr. Castel
berg. We all know that when one
opens a savings bank account it is
to deposit a portion of one's earnings
each pay day, and thus build up an
account that is worth the owning. It
is the same with buying at Castel
berg's. You pay a little at regular
intervals till your deposit balances
the purchase price of the goods
bought. There is one glaring differ
ence, though-you are enjoying the
benefit of the full amount of money
-wearing the Diamond or Watch
while you have still paid only a small
part of its cost. *
Cigars and Candy.
Mr. Castelberg suggested a novel
idea when pointing to the account of
one of his patrons. "This lady and
her husband entered into an agree
ment--the one to give up candy and
the other to give up so many cigars,
and the two are now putting the
money so saved into two of the
handsomest Diamonid Rings that the
store owned. Just goes to show how
a proposition will impress itself on
different people."
The Castelberg Factory.
"In most of the larger cities the
prominent jewelers conduct factories
of their own for the manufacture of
different goods. Have you such a
factory, and, if so, does it, besides the
pride of possession, give you any ad
vantage over the jeweler who has
none?"
"We have a factory-well equip
ped, too-in charge of one of the
best knovin foremen in America. Of
course we don't manufacture all our
goods. We buy the biggest part of
them, but when it comes to some
thing distinctly original and unique.
and when, as is often the case, we can
make an article cheaper than we cant
-buy it, our factory is our right
bower. It is very often the case that
we make considerable savings in this
way, and they are all turjied to the
benefit of the customer. Our fac
tory is not run for profit. We only
figure to cover its expenses. Of
course a'regular manufacturer could
not think of such a thing. He has
his traveling salesmen, the cost of
the factory, and his own'profit to fig
ure in-as well, before he can come at
the cost of an article to him."
The Inviw Inviwe.
Mr. Castelberg turned questioner
here and asked: "Did you ever stop
to think that our ofer of credit is
only a development of what all the
jewelers who cater to th~e best trade

five to six months' credit. We adopt
the other system and ask for pay
ments weekly or monthly, as the
buyer wishes, and the bill is paid in
nearly the same time and without the
inconvenience of paying the full
amount at once."
"Open a Charge Account at Cas
telberg's."
The slogan has become famous in
Washington. It is heard every
where on all occasions. It expresses
a whole lot in a few words and has
come to mean that cash is not such a
vital part of one's existence as it
might be. Opening a charge ac
count at Castelberg's smooths the
way of buyers to comforts and luxu
ries that would otherw ise be the pre
rogatives of the rich.
"We start young people to house
keeping-not in a literal sense, of
course, but we are a means to that
end in lots of cases. Many an en
gagement ring and edding ring,
too, is bought hef,'t be paid for as
the prospective grooa wishes. They
say that all the world oves a lover,
and we believe we ha our share of
that feeling, for there is not a young
man with the idea of iarrying who
comes into the house, and we know
it, that we don't put every advantage
in his way. He is often bashful and
thinks the whole world knows just
who he is buying that ring for, and
just why he is buying it, and he
needs help. He always has our best
advice and gets the very best the
store offers."
The Buyers at Castelberg's.
"Do you find that any particular
class of people take advantage .of
your credit plan more than any other
class?"
"The buyers here are people in
every station of life. North, west,
south and east are pretty well repre
sented in the twenty-five thousand
accounts on our books. As I said,
we cater to all-to every purse and
to every fancy, and by showing such
a large and such an exclusive stock,
too, we control pretty much the
cream of the trade in Washington.
A person will buy where his best
advantage lies every time, and we
make it to his advantage to buy
here."
A Present of Jewelry.
With the approaching Santa Claus
time the idea -of gifts predominates.
The "What shall I give?" is the all
important tluestion. From time iin
memorial jewelry has '1ield the first
place in the category of gifts. One
can express so much gocal taste in
such a gift.a One hanue -large- a
