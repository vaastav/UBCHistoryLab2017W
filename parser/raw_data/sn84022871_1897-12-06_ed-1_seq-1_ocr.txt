MESSAGE' FORECAST.
message of President McKinley
devoted practically to the
I: of our foreign relations and
irrency problem. It will be
in one respect in that it ignores
aat bulk of matters usually
uting the departmental por-
l presidential annual messages.

matter of the annual reports

ging to call attention only to
bre important affairs of the
imen. For this reason the
savings project of the post
general is not discussed in
3sage.
3 the details of the currency
re not definitely known, it can
oritatively stated that it is in
in an incorporation of the
views submitted by Secretary Gage,
though as to details the President
leaves himself freedom of action by
not taking any position with reference
to several features of the secretary's
plan while endorsing its main object.
Strong presentation of the Hawaiian
question is made and Congress is
urged to take immediate action by
ratification of the treaty of annexa
tion. This part of the message strong
y depicts the necessity for making
the island part of the domains of the
United States and reviews the advan
tages that would accrue to the coun
try by its possession. As to Cuba,
the message calls attention to the
recent trend of affairs on the island,
refers to the scheme of autonomy
just offered by Spain, and, after re
citing other developments in the situ
ation, reaches a virtual conclusion
that existing circumstances do not
warrant inteference in the affairs of
the island.
Considerable attention is'paid to the
question of reciprocity negotiations
with various nations of Europe. Spec
ial Commissioner Kasson has been
working on this subject for some time,
and the message deals with some of
the developments of negotiations
already had and expresses the satis
factory results in the future. The
policy of the Administration on this
subject is outlined, and citing French
champagnes as an illustration, the
point is made that if special conces
sions are given any foreign products,
the United States must be given equal
treatment by reciprocal concessions.
The Alaska problem is discussed at
some length and a plea is made for
congressional legislation including
the extension of the operation of the
public land laws and the granting of
rights of way for roads by which all
parts of the country may be made
more accessable.
PROBABLE LEGISLATION.
Members of Congress are unusually
slow in putting in , their appearance
here for the regular session which
convenes next Monday. Up to this
time there have been scarcely more
than a half dozen arrivals each day.
From now on, however, it is expected
that thejrush. will begin, and that a
full attendance will be present on the
opening day. Few of the leaders of
either house are yet here. This is es
pecially true of the House of Repre
sentatives. Neither Speaker Reed
nor Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of
the majority, will reach Washington
until Saturday or Sunday. With the
exception of the pronounced and
radical pro and anti Cuban members,
the members of both houses, as a
rule, seem tojbe holding their judg
ment in abeyance until they ascertain
from official sources exactly what the
situation is as to Cuba. In the matter
of currency it seems already estab
lished that the democrats and their
free silver allies will oppose stub
bornly anything the majority is like
ly to propose and the fact that the
opposition in the Senate seems in
surmountable inclines many of the
republican members of the House to
the opinion that it would ,be wisdom
not to attempt any legislation what
ever. Mr. Hepburn of Iowa is one of
these. He thinks the futility of
passing a measure . in the Senate
makes it inexpedient for the House
to attempt to put through a meas
ure, and, besides, he doubts the pro
priety of the republicans of tho House
attempting to make a republican
policy on a subject upon which the
republican iplatform . does Jnot speak
to the point. He says if the president
should, as reported, recommend
any scheme for the retirement of
greenbacks, it would be beyond the
republican platform and every re
publican would be free to support or
oppose it a3 his judgment indicated.
There is some talk of a republican
caucus on this question; many of the
members believing tif fa currency
measure is to be passed differences
could bej most easily adjusted and
concerted action secured in this way.
Mr. Walker of Massachusetts, chair
man of the committee on banking
and currenc", some time ago sent a
letter to every member of his com
mittee urging the importance of cur
rency legislation and asking each
member to be prepared as soon after
the opening of the session as possi
ble to work to the end that some
measure may be submitted to the
House for action.
Mr. Hepburn, who i3 chairman of
the committee on interstate and
foreign commerce, says he has re
ceived many letters during the re
cess, particularly from mercantile
bodies, urging action on the anti
scalping and pooling bills, and he ex
pects both these questions to receive
early attention.
Secretary Gage said recently that in
the annual estimates he would send
to Congress he would name about
$10,000,000, and not above 25,000,000
as the amount of the treasury deficit
for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898. The secretary said that he e"x-
pected the receipts from customs to
increase steadily and that in the
spring months he anticipated large
importations.
ANNEXATION OF THE SANDWICH
ISLANDS.

for it of bank paper, and for a liberal
banking law, under which remote
communities with small capital can
enjoy banking facilities of which they
are now deprived. In other words,

is needed, and perhaps something
may be obtained from the Senate if

make a determined and intelligent
push for it. Harper's Weekly.
Royal makes the food pure,
wholesome and delicious.
Among the important matters with
which the United States Senate will
have on its hands during the present
session of Congress is the question of
annexation of the Sandwich Islands.
The government of Hawaii has al
ready accepted the proposition and a
largo proportion of the people seem
anxious that the Islands should be
annexed. It only remains now for.
Senate, by a two-thirds vote in favo?
to ratify the treaty. It is reported
that more than this number of sena
tors are willing to vote for the treaty.
The annexation means of course
that these far away islands become a
part of the United States. They will
be entitled to some sort of territorial
or other government under the sanc
tion of the United States. They will
be under the protection of our gov
ernment and will be entitled to rights
and privileges which belong to states
and territories.
Hereafter, if not at once, in the
very nature of things, complications
in regard to rights and privileges, and
with other powers are liable to arise.
Expenses, probably greater than any
direct returns to the government, will
be incurred, Forts and fortifications
must be built to resist attacks in case
of war with other nations. Battle
ships must patrol the waters and
guard the interests of the far-away
regions and the country must pro
tect the islands from danger from
without, and commotions, if such
there may be, from within.
It is claimed on the other hand that
the islands belong by right of loca
tion, though two thousand miles
away, to the United States. They are
largely controlled already by people
who have gone there from this coun
try. Their interests are identica
witn ours. .Business relations are
close. We ship a large variety of
products and manufactures there,
while they ship tb us immense quan
tities of sugar . and other products
which are grown on the islands.
American capital in large amounts is
invested there.
It is a question with many, how
ever, whether the project is advan
tageous or not. Our country and our
capabilities are pretty large yet and
we have no special need of territory
or of distant sea possessions. Euro
pean countries, even little Japan of
the Asiatic realms, are reaching out
for territory and power, and without
doubt are ready to accept Hawaii if
the United States does not do it. So
far our possessions in Alaska have
not proved unprofitable and it may
be that a portion of the Pacific may
be advantageous. We shall see.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE
il ENDLESS CHAIN."
It seems to be settled that Mr. Mc
Kinley is to make some recognition
of the need of money reform in his
forth-coming message, and that he is
at least to recommend the adoption of
Mr. Gage's proposed plan for destroy
ing the "endless chain" which has been
so successf ully dragging the gold
out of the Treasury. Whether or not
he is to go any further than this ap
pears not to be known. The destruc
tion of the "endless chain" is to be
accomplished, if Congress agrees to
Mr. McKinley's proposal, by prohib
iting the reissue of greenbacks except
In return for gold. This would be an
exceedingly valuable step in the right
direction, but so long as the green
backs exist they will be a hindrance
to the adoption of a sound banking
law, and a temptation to unsound
money men to agitate for government
paper alone. Already the greenbacks
are taking advantage of the rumored
recommendation to begin an agita
tion for the replacement of National
bank notes with greenbacks. What
the country wants, however, is a
system that shall supply all the paper
money, leaving to the government
the duty of coining metal money, and
to the Treasury Department the duty
of collecting and disbursing the rev
enues, and of holding the securities
and the safety -fund for the assurance
of bank-notes. We trust that the
House which may if Mr. Reed will
will pass .a proper bill providing for
the retirement and destuction of gov- I
ernment paper, for the substitution 1
