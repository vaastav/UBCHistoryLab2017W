EXCESS OF RECEIPTS FOR FIS
CAL YEAR 1908.
CIRCULATION IS NOW FREER.
Withdrawal of Public Money from De
positary Banks in New York in
January Was $8,850,000.
CO—TELYOU SUBMITS HIS REPORT.
WASHINGTON. D. C-, Dec. 9.—The
annual report of Mr. Cortelyou, the
secretary of the treasury, shows a re
versal of conditions for the fiscal year
1908, as compared with the fiscal year
lor 1907. For the latter year the re
ceipts were $84,290,580 in excess of the
disbursements. For the fiscal year 1908
the disbursements were $58,070,201 in
excess of the receipts, due to business
depression and increased appropriations.
Fortunately, the report says, the avail
able cash balance at the beginning of
the fiscal year was $272,001,445.
The treasury was called upon in the
latter part of October, 1907, to render
assistance in a financial panic which
started in New York city and which
gradually extended over the entire coun
try. Through treasury operations dur
ing this financial disturbance the amount
ot public deposits with the banks
reached $230,548,321 on November 30,
1907, and on December 27, 1907, the
maximum of $259,994,271 was attained,
after which it was decreased to $250,-
920,154 by the close of the month.
Further withdrawals decreased this
amount to $118,379,530, on November 10,
1908. At the beginning of the present
fiscal year there was a freer circulation
of money and large amounts were re
turned to the financial centers and some
of the depositaries voluntarily returned
to the treasury a part of their Holdings
of public deposits, amounting in all to
approximately four millliou dollars. A
further withdrawal of public money from
depositary banks in New York city,
made in January, amounted to $8,850,-
000, making the balance in the banks to
the credit of the general fund at the
end of January, $226,241,418.
Further voluntary surrender of de
posits were made during February, and
on June 30 the general fund had been
reduced to $149,0000,000.
The aggregate of trust funds, consist
ing of gold coin and standard silver dol
lars held for the redemption of certifi
cates and notes for which they were re
spectively pledged, increased $139,000,-
000 during the year.
Monetary Stock Increases.
The monetary stock for the year in
creased $263,203,000. The growth in gold
was $151,744,391. In silver. $17,919,-
395; national bank notes $94,545,227. At
the same time there was a decrease of
$1,006,000. At the close of the fiscal
year 1908, the money in circulation
amounted to $3,038,015,488, or a per
capita of $34.72. The percentage of gold
to circulation was $45.95. There was an
increase of $94,545,227 in the volmuy of
national bank notes during the fiscal year
closed July Ist, last.
The amount of interest bearing debt on
June 30. 1907, is shown to have been
8934.902,760 and on June 30, 1908, $897,-
503,990.
The report shows that from the date of
the passage of the national bank act in
-.863 to July 1, 1908, charters were
granted to 9174 national banking associa
tions and at the close of the last fiscal
year there were in operation 6827 as
sociations, with authorized capital stock
of $930,542,774. Banks to the number of
1878 have been closed by the voluntary
action of their stockholders and 469 insol
vent associations have been placed in
charge of receivers.
There were purchased for the coinage
of subsidiary silver during the fiscal year
16,950.309 ounces of silver bullion at a
cost of $9,923,026.
The receipts from internal revenue
taxes for the fiscal year 1908. were
$251,711,126, a net decrease from 1907 of
$17,955,646. The customs receipts for
the same period amounted to $286,113,-
130, a decrease for the year of about
$46,000,000.
May Reach Big Sum.
Basing his figures on the estimates of
appropriations- already submitted by the
several executive departments, the sec
retary is of the opinion that the excess
of expenditures over receipts for the fis
cal year ending June 30, 1910, may
reach $143,046,796.
Realizing that sudden changes in the
customs standing of imported merchan
dise are unfair to business, and intro
duce an element of uncertainty, the sec
retary has instituted anew- system by
which, when the classification of goods
is changed, which results in the payment
of a higher rate of duty, ample notice is
given to those interested.
There have been just completed by
the department negotiations which put
an end to the long drawn out controver
sy as to the value of Limoges china.
And in doing this it had established a
precedent and a principle of eo-operation
between the manufacturing interests in
volved and the United States govern
ment which is capable of being extended
to other classes of merchandise, with ex
cellent results.
During the year the department has
entered into an agreement with the
chamber of commerce of Limoges repre
senting the manufacturers of that city,
as to the value of all kinds of lottery
there manufactured. Some minor details
yet remain to be settled, but these do
n*t affect the harmonious results that
have been achieved.
Germany’s Monetary System.
The report calk attention to the com
mission of which Assistant Secretary
James B. Reynolds was the chairman
which went abroad last year to dis
cuss with German officials certain impor
tant matters affecting the proper admin
istration of the customs laws and an
agreement reached with that country
contained a provision that the chamber
of commerce of that country should be
entitled to furnish certificates of value
of merchandise manufactured or pro
duced in their respective communities
which should be regarded by the ap
praising officers of the United States
BRYAN TO VISIT JOHN W. GATES.
Democratic Leader to Be Guest of the
Republican Millionaire.
GALVESTON, Tex., Dec. 9.—As the
guest of John W. Gates at his palatial
home at Port Arthur, W. J. Bryan will
spend two or three days with the well
known Republican millionaire. While
a duck hunt on the Gates preserve has
been arranged as a feature of the en
tertainment, Mr. Bryan has consented
to deliver an address especially dedicated
to the Republicans of Texas. Mr. Gates
has invited many of the leading Re
publicans of the state to be his guests
on 'his occasion and to assist in enter
taining the distinguished Nebraskan. Mr.
Bryan and his wife leave Galveston for
Fort Arthur Friday.
BULGARLA IS WILLING TO PAY.
Ready to Give Turkey $16,500,000 for
Her Independence.
PARIS, Dec. 9.—The Temps publishes
a dispatch from its Sofia correspondent
saying that Bulgaria has notified the
powers of her willingness to indemnify
Turkey in the sum of $16,500,000 for the
damages sustained by the Bulgarian dec
laration of independence.
as competent evidence in the finding of
value. The privilege was subsequently
extended to the chamber of commerce
of other nations, and it was granted
only after it was ascertained that these
organizations were governmental in their
character so that in case of a careless
or false certificate of value being sent
to this country by such an organization,
it would be possible to present the mat
ter to its government for proper action.
The treasury commission also made a
special study of these chambers of com
meice in France, Austria-Hungary and
Great Britain to determine just what
would be the competency of the evidence
that was presented In case of disputed
values.
With a view to greater expedition and
hence less disturbance in business con
ditions incident to the enforcement of
the pure food law. the secretary during
the year has arranged to do away in
a large measure with the reference of
eacii disputed case to Washington and
has left to the chief loesi representa
tive of the treasury department and
the department of agrictlture at the
larger ports the disposition of all cases
except those of exceptional importance.
Economy in Transfers.
The advantage of reducing to a mini
mum the transfer of gold between these
financial centers of the world, the secre
tary says, has been often discussed, but
has not yet been the subject of official
action. Economy in such transfers as
come about automatically from time to
time by the extension of the system of
bills of exchange and by the use of in
ternational credits, but distrust of these
resources in time of crisis, the very mo
ment at which they are most needed,
invokes a demand for physical gold. The
three months of November and Decem
ber, 1907, and January, 1908, witnessed
imports of gold into the Fnited States to
the amount of $118,822,870. and on the
other hand the three months of April,
May and June, 1908, witnessed exports
of gold from the United States to the
amount of $49,658,072. For the twelve
months ending October 31, 1908, the
total imports of gold were $150,234,064,
and total exports $72,509,564.
The secretary says it would seem that
means might be devised to diminish the
transfer of physical gold under these con
ditions. That credits or loans of gold
might be extended more generously than
at present by one nation to another in
times of stress, was proposed soon after
the crisis of a year ago. It has been
suggested that an international confer
ence be called of representatives of the
ministries of finance and of the great
slate banks with a view to more prompt
and effective co-operation in emergencies.
Distribution of Receipts.
The secretary devotes considerable
space to the question of an economical
disbursement of current receipts, and
the classification of both receipts and
disbursements in such a way as to fa
cilitate such an adjustment, and sug
gests that it would perhaps be compe
tent to Congress to vest in a joint com
mittee the power of revising the appro
priations bills with a view to distribut
ing reductions and increases in an equit
able manner and also with a view to
the relative importance of the object
for which appropriations are sought.
It would seem that such a committee
should be charged with the responsibility
of keeping the expenditures of each
year approximately within the revenue
of the year, or, if this could not be
done, that it should authorize the issue
of a proper amount of short term obli
gations to bridge over tlie deficit of
loan years. By such a committee need
less and wasteful expenditure might be
checked.
The secretary says that the present
form of treasury statement is in several
respects misleading. It makes no sep
aration between the expenditures for
the ordinary service of the government,
and those for permanent public works,
like river and harbor improvements, pub
lic buildings and the Panama canal. If
these statements differentiated between
the ordinary and the extraordinary ex
penditures the record for the fiscal year
1908 would show ordinary receipts
$601,126,118. Ordinary disbursements,
$570,477,838. Surplus of receipts, $30.-
048.279. Extraordinary receipts and dis
bursements. sale of Panama bonds, $24,-
631.980. Sale of treasury certificates,
$15,436,500. From premium, $735,788.
Total extraordinary receipts, $40,804,-
2GS. Extraordinary disbursements, for
Panama canal. $38,093,425; for public
buildings, under treasury. $9,341,364;
for reclamation service. $11,126,042. For
rivers and harbors, $30,157,649. For
the reduction of the public debt, $34,-
356.750. Total extraordinary disburse
ments. $123,075,230.
There are other changes that should
be made in tlie daily treasury statement
in the interest of a better understanding
of the financial operations of the de
partment.
Revision of Tariff.
On the subject of the revision of the
tariff the secretary says the new admin
istration is pledged to a fair and equita
ble revision. The necessities of the gov
ernment should be a guide, at least in
part, to the measure and character of
the revision. Data recorded in this re
port tell their own story. If the defi
ciencies reach anything like tiie figures
given, ample provision must be made
through new subjects of taxation, to
provide adequate revenue. The earnest
consideration of Congress is especially
urged to this phase of the subject.
Of recent currency legislation the sec
retary says that the act passed at the
last session of Congress has served a
useful purpose, and will be available un
til the recommendations of the monetary
commission created by that Congress can
be considered and acted upon.
MAY ERECT MUSEUM,
Chicago Court Denies Injunction Prayed
for by Montgomery Ward to Block
Field Memorial.
CHICAGO. Ilk, Dec. 9.—The $8,000.-
000 museum provided for Chicago in the
will of the late Marshall Field became a
probability today when Judge De Puy
in the superior court refused to grant a
perpetual restraining order petitioned for
by A. Montgomery Ward to prevent the
erection of the edifice on the made land
part of Grant park, commonly known as
the Lake Front park. Judge De Puy
held that a previous permanent injunc
tion applied only to the park proper west
of the Illinois Central tracks, but not to
the made land which has extended the
boundaries of the park a considerable
distance into the lake east of the tracks.
Mr. Ward complained against the con
templated building in his capacity as an
owner of property on Michigan avenue,
which bounds the park on the west.

WRIGHT ASKS FOR
NEW LIFE IN ARMY
SECRETARY OF WAR WANTS 612
MORE OFFICERS AND RETIRE
MENT OF UNFIT.
COST OF ARftlY INCREASING.
Annual Report Calls for Larger Appro
priations to Maintain Forces
That Are Needed.
FEWER DESERTIONS ARE NOTED.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 10.—
Uncle Sam needs more officers for the
army, and at the same time he wants to
get rid of a lot of poor material. In his
annual report Secretary Wright espe
cially recommends an addition of 012 of
ficers to the army and also approves a
policy for the elimination from the serv
ice of all officers who fail to maintain
the requisite standard of efficiency.
Both of these propositions were before
Congress at its last session and will be
strongly urged this year. To provide for
the additional 612 officers the secretary
states there will be added an annual
cost of between $2,600,000 and $3,000.
000.
Ihe necessity for more officers, the re
port states, is due to the unavoidable
detachment of officers from their regular
service with troops. Their detachment for
recruiting duty, for duty as instructors in
the army and at state institutions, as
well as with the militia of the several
states and territories, has occupied the
time of a large number of officers. At
present there are on detached duty 691
officers and 157 additional absent on
leave or on account of sickness. Secre
tary Wright is of the belief that it
would be a measure of wise economy to
provide an extra number of highly
equipped officers for these added duties
which have been thrown upon the army,
as the result would be highly beneficial
in case of war.
Cost of Army Increases.
The total estimates of the war depart
ment for the next fiscal year, as shown
by the annual report of Secretary
Wright, amount to $189,755,039, an in
crease of about $52,000,000 over the ap
propriations for the present fiscal year.
The increase is largely for river and har
bor work and other public works of a
civil character, for which purpose about
$24,000,000 is asked. Of the balance
about $10,500,000 is an additional esti
mate for the support of the army, mili
tary academy and the militia. For mili
tary public works, such as fortifications,
arsenals and military posts, the estimate
calls for an increase of $17,800,000.
In urging the favorable consideration
of the bill providing for the additional
612 officers Secretary Wright makes the
following statement:
“Although our existing military es
tablishment fully justifies itself even in
times of peace, it should never be for
gotten that its greatest value is found
In the fact that through it in case of Avar
we have a considerable body of trained
officers fit for higher commands, who art'
available to take charge of and lick into
shape large bodies of volunteers who are
suddenly summoned to the colors with
out previous military education or disci
pline. While the increased number of
officers asked for are urgently needed
now. their value in case of war cannot
be overestimated. All of us hope that
war with any foreign power may never
come, but this hope has not prevented
the nation from several times becoming
engaged in war, and usually there has
been little time for preparation preceding
the actual declaration of hostilities.”
Fewer Desertions Noted.
The report states that the total num
ber of enlistments in the army during
the fiscal year ending June 30. 1908, ex
clusive of the hospital corps and Philip
pine scouts, was 41,463. Of this number
11,743 were re-enlistments and 29,720
were original enlistments. The number
of desertions from the army fell off 4.6
per cent, of the whole number of enlisted
men in the service during the fiscal year
1908, as compared with 5.6 per cent,
during the preceding fiscal year. Secre
tary Wright speaks with gratification
upon the marked decrease in the num
ber of desertions, which was less in 1908
than during any fiscal year since 1901.
Secretary Wright submits an estimate
of $500,000 to enable the signal corps to
take up military aeronautics in a more
effective way than it has done in the
past. On this subject he makes the fol
lowing observation:
“During the past year the signal corps
of the army has been instrumental in ma
terially advancing the progress of aerial
navigation by the encouragement it has
given to owners and inventors of dirigi
ble balloons and aeroplanes. It has been
engaged in developing the knowledge in
practice of aeronautics both in the signal
corps and in the army at large, and in
furtherance of its work an officer of
the signal corps spent three months in
France. England, Germany and Belgium
inspecting and investigationg the mili
tary aeronautical establishments of these
countries.
“During the past year the signal corps
has purchased under contract, after satis
factory tests, a small dirigible balloon
capable of carrying two persons and hav
ing a speed of twenty miles per hour,
and this machine is at present being used
for the training of officers and men.”
Militia Is Improving.
The secretary refers to the good results
accomplished by legislation enacted at
the last session of Congress to promote
the efficiency of the militia. Having in
mind the desirability of being prepared
for any attack that might be made on
one or both of the coast lines, he recom
mends that the general scheme of na
tional defense shall provide a force of
organized militia of approximately 350,-
000 men, 300.000 of these in combina
tion with the infantry, cavalry and field
artillery of the regular army to consti
tute a field army of 400.000.
He estimates that about 75 per cent,
of the 111,000 officers and men in the
organized militia would respond to a
call to arms, and of the number respond
ing a small percentage would be elimi
nated probably by physical disqualifica
tion. It is estimated that a lititle more
than 60 per cent.—that is, about 67.000.
would be available at present in case of
an emergency.

Chicago Association of Commerce last
night at the Auditorium hotel, delivered
a brief after-dinner talk, one of the
few he ever made, in which he declared
that he would remember the occasion as
long as he lived.
Mr. Morgan said that he had not come
to Chicago to talk, that he was not a
speechmaker, and that he came because
he wanted to assure the business men
of Chicago that his heart was with
them in the upbuilding of the city.
Mr. Morgan had listened with evident
interest to addresses by B. F. Yoakum
of the Hock Island-Frisco lines, who
spoke of “Our Country and Our Kail
roads;” Judge Thomas Burke of Seattle,
Wash., who talked on the “Commercial
Relationship of the Pacific Northwest
and the Orient.” and Kt.-Hev. Charles
P. Anderson, bishop of Chicago, who
discussed “The Ethics of Commerce.”
Thinks Nation Needs Rest.
Mr. Morgan did not restrain his > dem
onstration of appreciation of poignant
remarks made by Mr. Yoakum on the
railroad situation in the United states
and applauded vigorously the declara
tion of the railroad man that this coun
try “now needs a rest from further regu
lative laws until the railroads can ad
just themselves to a compliance with
those which have been enacted.”
This statement was enthusiastically
applauded by the 700 Chicago business
men who partook of the dinner in Mr.
Morgan’s honor, and the great financier
nodded his approval as he clapped his
hands enthusiastically.
Again he applauded when Mr. Yoak
um turned from a discussion of the rail
road problem to the development of the
great waterways of the country and ad
vocated the completion of the Chicago to
the gulf deep water way project as of
more importance to the United States
than the completion of the Panama ca
nal.
Morgan Rises Unannounced.
Mr. Morgan, who occupied the seat of
honor in the center of the speakers’ ban
quet table, sa ; d nothing until the con
clusion of the programme. Without any
announcement he rose from his seat
and the great crowd rose with him
and cheered him to the echo. Handker
chiefs were waved and scores of en
thusiastic Chicago business men stood in
their chairs applauding while Mr. Mor
gan bowed and smiled his appreciation
of the reception.
“Mr. President and gentlemen of the
Association of Commerce,” said Mr.
Morgan, speaking in a voice that was
surprising for its strength and clearness.
“When your president called upon me
lasjt September asking me to come and
dine with you hero, it is needless for me
to say that I was deeply touched, and
I told him that I would come, but un
fortunately, being familiar with dinners,
there was one thing that I could not do
and that was to speak.
“But I cannot allow yon to go from
here tonight without telling you how I
thank you from my heart for the sin
cerity of your reception, for all that
has been said, for all that has been
done, and to tell you that I shall never
forget it as long as 1 live.”
As Mr. Morgan concluded the applause
was deafening, exceeding in intensity and
vigor *he cheers which greeted him when
he rose to speak.
Generous with Signature.
Mr. Morgan signed his name to more
than 200 programmes during the progress
of the dinner. In fact Mr. Morgan had
little time to partake of the dinner, so
great was the demand for his autograph.
He took the demaud of the guests very
cheerfully, and even after officials of the
club tried repeatedly to stop the waiters
in .heir rush from all parts of the house
with menu cards and programmes, Mr.
Morgan insisted that his fountain pen
had not gone dry, and that he would
keep signing his name as long as it was
demanded.
“You see. I am used to signing my
name,” said Mr. Morgan to President
Hall.
When the first cards were passed up
to him from guests who sat near the
press table Mr. Morgan leaned over the
table and said, smiling as he spoke:
“Gentlemen, you can have anything
you want from me except a speech or an
interview.”
The waiters were immediately in great
demand, and they found it profitable, for
on returning the menu to its owner with
Mr. Morgan’s signature attached a sub
stantial tip was waiting. After Mr. Mor
gan had passed the squab and the ice
association officials attempted to stop the
procession to the guest of honor’s seat,
but it was of no use.
“Oh, let them come,” said Mr. Morgan.
“I am enjoying it. I am not signing
checks.”

Ladies’ Apartment.
IS CALLED LUCKIEST ACCIDENT.
BISMARCK. N. D., Dec. 10.—The
wreck of the westbound North Coast
limited at McKenzie, twenty miles east
of here last night, may be considered one
of the most lucky in the annals of rail
roading, according to railroad men. The
fact that an almost entire train going
at the rate of fifty miles an hour, con
taining more than 'JOU people, could turn
over and go down a 10-foot embankment
without killing anybody is marvelous.
The train struck a broken rail. The
engine got over safely but the tender
went off the track, followed by the bag
gage car and mail car, when the cou
pling broke and the three day coaches,
two sleepers and the observation car
went down an embankment into a deep
snowdrift and turned over without
breaking a coupling. The hard packed
snow saved the train from destruction.
Eight babies on the train were not even
scratched.
List of Injured.
The most seriously injured are:
11. G. WILLIAMS, Allegheny, Pa.,
thrown through the window of the day
coach, cut on head, face, neck and body;
he nearly hied to death before the arrival

Embarrassing for Preacher.
A .Seattle preacher was thrown out of
his berth in his nightshirt into the berth
of three women, badly bruising the lat
ter. The lights on the train were ex
tinguished at once, which added to the
confusion. In the meantime the passen
gers were calm and crawled out into the
snow in all kinds of attire, lint soon re
tired to the cars and finished dressing.
SAYS PRESIDENT HAS
THIRST FOR SLAYING.
Colorado Humane Officer Declares
“Roosevelt’s Lust for Blood Is
Pernicious.”
DEN\ ER, Col., Dec. 30. —Secretary
E. \V. Whitehead of the state bureau of
child and animal protection, in an arti
cle printed in the monthly publication
of the Colorado Human society, just
from the press, entitled “Protect the
Deer,” says “President Roosevelt as a
sportsman is furnishing to the American
nation an example of ruthlessness and
bloodlust as far reaching as it is per
nicious.” Continuing, the article says:
“No one more deeply and sincerely ap
preciates the merit and good qualities of
our President than we do, but these va
cation trips of his are not worthy of
a President nor of the true American
man. Many of his truest admirers re
gret his heralded hunting trip to Africa.
It is not necessary; it cannot reflect
credit upon him; he runs little risk;
and if tliore is any, it is a needless one
in an unworthy cause. If reports are
true he looks forward eagerly, exultant
ly. impatiently to the excursion to the
other side of Hie world, whose prime
object is to slay. We resent the lust of
blood, the thirst to slay.”
5 CENTS JOHN DPS TIP.
Richest Man Also Advises Waiter to
Put Gift in Savings Bank to
Earn More.
NEW BRUNSWICK, N. J., Dec. 10.
—John D. Rockefeller had luncheon at
the Mansion house with Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson of New York. They motored
up from Lakewood and back again.
The luncheon, of which Mr. Rocke
feller ate a generous proportion, consist
ed of vegetable soup, lobster, scallops,
planked chicken, and baked potatoes.
Rockefeller gave the waiter 5 cents
for a tip and advised him to put it in the
savings bank.
“That’s what I did with ray spare
cash when I was your age,” said Mr.
Rockefeller, “and it earned money for
me. Never waste your money.”
PANAMA FOR BIG FAIR.
Little Republic to Celebrate Opening of
Canal and Wants World’s Expo
sition There.
PANAMA, Dec. 10. —Steps are being
taken looking to the organization of an
association for the purpose of commem
orating the opening of the Panama canal
in 1915. It is proposed if the scheme
is found feasible, to hold a world’s fair
here. Many of the most prominent men
on the isthmus have heartily endorsed
the plan, which, if successfully carried
out. would mean so much for the coun
try.
USE TREE FOR DISPLAY.
APPLETON, Wis., Dec. 10.—[Spe
cial.] —Elaborate electric street illumina
tion consisting of a large number of
arches, each having seventy-five incandes
cent lights, will be supplemented tomor
row night on the main thoroughfare of
this city by perhaps the most unique
electrical display ever used in a business
section of a city. A mammoth elm whose
stateliness has for years protected it
from the woodsman’s axe and which is
the only tree in the business section of
Appleton, will be transformed into an
overgrown Christmas tree and decorated
with several hundred red, white and blue
incandescent lights. The tree occupies
a location at the eastern extremity of
the arch street lighting system and will
therefore constitute one end of what is
said to be the most elaborate electrical
display in any small city in the middle
west.
WAUSAU—The examination and ordina
tion of Rev, Guy C. Crippen as pastor of
