The proposition, it nppcars, In to net
aside bolt of land six miles wide, run
nlng from Fort GriDlii, Tex., across the
Texas Pacific Raiiro ul at Hoard, and
proceeding north ns far as the llritlsh
Posies-lous, pasting through Fort
Dodge and Ogalalla. It U propoed
that tho Government shall grant what
public laud may he needed for the pur
pose, tb.tt tho States and Territories
traversed shall be asked to grant what
State land falls" wltlun tho trail, and
that both Stnte and national authorities
be asked to aid in condomimg what
ever private proporty may come In tho
wny, to be paid for by the cuttle syndi
cate, Their proposed line would bo not
far (rom 1,000 miles in longth, and be
ing 0 tnlle wide, would mvolvo aboMt
6,000 sqtiaio miles, or nh.ut 4,000,000
acres, worth, perhaps, 320,000,000. No
remuneration to tho Government Is
proposed lor this vast grant of hind. An
enorm nil valuo U to be given for noth
ing, and ivn Interest nl ready wealthy
and prosperous is to bo furthoi enrich
ed thereby. Upon what reasons of Jus
tice and fairness can such chum be
made? Careful obsorvers detect indi
cation of a dangerous monopoly in tho
course of some ot tho "cattle kings"
represented in the Convention, who
have crowded smaller lanihemon to
the wall, and have not been scrupulous
us to either privnte or public rights
which fell in ihulr way, I ho proposed
grant would strengthen such a monop
oly. Moreover, muny of these cattle
men are foreigners cither Individual
owners or agents for foreign corpor
ationswho have no interest in tho
coHntry except t get out of It nil the
money that they can. For ourselves,
wo nro free to say that we would rather
sfe a limit put upon their acquisitions
than to open tho way to extend nnd
strengthen them. Tho proposition ot
the cattlemen Is' distinctly not one that
hould command itself to ike favor of
Congress.
In speaking of the Inte cattlemen's
convention held at St. Louis, tho Tar-
kin Republican says:
Did lfover'occur to the casual render
that this combination of the Western
cattle men is tho beginning of one of
the most dangerous monopolies with
which our country Is cursedP If it has
not, it Is time that ovary man interested
in the throttling nnd downfall of such
Institutions, should glte It conildcra
lion. Thoy say that ono object they
have in forming tho organization is
self-protection. Self protection against
what? " Don't they go out upon the
wo'tern plains with all tho protection
that is vouchsafed to any other man or
olass of IndlvidHalsP Are they not per
mitted to tftKo their largo herds out
there and graze upon government land
as long as they please, or until the same
is required for ueluil sotilomontP
Ilaven't they millions upon millions ot
dollars invesieu out tuero upon wuicn
they are nut required to pity n dollars'
tax? Don't thoy enjoy all tho protec
tion that is ci anted to the poor home
steader? What kind of protection do
they want then ? It is the protection
that Is sought altor by every other
large corporation and combination in
the land that of the strong against the
weak. Thoy want the goyemmeut to
givo ovor the whole wes'- to thdra nnd
drive out tho homesteader and poor
men who are socking a home, nnd what
forP For the protection of tho cattle
Interests."
Bo on your gnard, you who expect
some dav to secure a plne of govern
ment land upon which to make a home
for yourself and fainilv, for as sure as
von live. Ibis combining ot all the Itn
ruenee cattle interests irom ino uuu or
Mexico to the Diitlsu line means some
thing It mvans a desiro to get control
of tho entire wct. They havo alroady
taken charge of nil the water privileges
