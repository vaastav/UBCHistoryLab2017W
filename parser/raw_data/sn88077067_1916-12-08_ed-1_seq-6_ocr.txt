TO THE CONGRESS

sion Hear Address of
the President.
HE MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS
Further Legislation for Settlement and
Regulation of Railway Labor Dis
putes Held Imperatively Necea
aary by the chief Magistrate.
Washington, Dec. 5. Tilt' senate
and house in ft In Joint session today
and heard President Wilson's message,
which was us follow s :
Gentlemen of tin' Congress:
In fullllling ut this time il l'"y '"Id
upon im by llu Constitution of com
inunleuting to you from time to time
Infornmtion of tht' slate of tin" I'lilon
ami recommending to your eoiishleru
tlon such legislative measures us may
be Judged necessary unci expedient 1
Mm II continue the pruct !. which I
hope has lii-en acceptable to yon, of
leaving to the reports of the several
lieuils of tin- executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service mid tontine myself
to those mutters of more general pub
lic policy with which It si-ems neces
sary and feasible, to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which .von will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions lis lew as possible; but there
iwcre some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, It seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the renminbi):
measures of the program of settle
ment ami regulation which I hail occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last session In view of the pub
lic dancers disclosed by the unaccom
modated ditliculties which then existed,
nnd which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country ami their locomotive engineers,
conductors, nnd trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended :
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission alum; the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives ami now awaiting
fiction by the senate; In order that tlw
commission may be enabled to deal
.with the many great and various duties
'now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are. with
Its present constitution and means of
notion, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages In the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating, trains in interstate transporta
jtlon. Third, the authorization of tin- ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the in
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by tin- adoption of the eight
hour day nnd which have not been off
pet by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify tin- increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to It a provision that, in case
the methods of nceomniodation now
provided for should fall, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
Mich dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And. sixth, the lodgment in tin
hands of the executive of the power.
1n case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into
the military service of the United
States such train crews nnd adminis
trative ollieials as the circumstances
require for their safe nnd efficient use.
Renews His Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress Immediate
ly acted on: it established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
nnd wages in train service and it au
thorized the appointment of u com
mission to observe nnd report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most Immediately needed ;
Unusual Experience.

but It postponed action upon the other
miggcslloiiM until mi opportunity should
he offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem It rieces
miry to renew. The power of (he In
terstate commerce commission to grant
an lncrense of rates on the ground re
ferred to Is Indisputably clear and n
recommendation by the congress with
regard to mich n matter might seem to
draw In question the scope of the com
mission's niithorlty or Its Inclination to
do Justice when there Is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions tin Increase
In the Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership nnd in its facilities
for performing Its manifold duties, the
provision for full public Investigation
and nssessment of Industrial disputes,
mid the grant to the executive of the
power to control nnd operate the rail
ways when necessary In time of war
or other like public necessity I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with the responsibility
nnd duty of serving nnd safeguarding
them In such matters would llml It
hard, I believe, to excuse n failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of notion
upon thetu.
Not only does the Interstate com
merce commission now llml It practi
cally Impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Its great functions promptly nnd thor
oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It
may presently be found advisable to
add to Its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative Instru
ment. The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
luck of iiiMltlonal means of arbitra
tion ami conciliation which the con
gress can easily nnd promptly supply.
And all will ngree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This Is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case In ttie mere
statement of It. With regard to one
of Its items. the lncrense in the etli-
cU-ucy of t lie Interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
lias already acted ; its action needs
onlv the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon tiie .suggestion should I
make it, that any man in any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue In an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass n law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave bis work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple into our jurisprudence which I
lake it for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. Hut the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
Investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to propose
any such principle. It is based upon
the very dill'ercnt principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop t lie in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but tlie justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of till concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three mutters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which;
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the hill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than Is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bilf amending
the present orguuic law of Porto liico ;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough und systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt I'ructices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies in the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
tills time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government.

Porto Rico's Needs.
The Argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Tor
to Itlco Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the Island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not Just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among the people
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move, we do not (toutit w nat we wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do It at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween 1he two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you In
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor In such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare servieenbleiiess and
distinction.
Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite.
Instead of an ax and saw to remove
the tops of trees that are to be used
as masts In logging operations, dyna
mite is used to shoot off the tops.
After the branches have been removed,
a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of
irons, to the point where It Is neces
sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk
is usually about 12 inches In diame
ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna
mite cartridges, fastened end to end
like sausages, around the trunk at this
point, inserts a blasting cup with about
1!0 feet of fuse In one of these sticks,
lights the end of the fuse, and de
scends before the explosion takes
place. The tree top pumps Into the
air with the explosion and the trunk
is left ready for attaching the rigging
for dragging in and loading the logs.

Great Britain Is maintaining one nd
of tho longest, most dangerous nnd
most Important ferry service In the
world,
"Kerry service" may sound like nn
odd phrase, for the moment, to be
used In describing an overseas trans
portation system, but so frequent are
the sailings, so great the numbers of
men and tons of munitions and sup
plies carried that the expression Is
really the uptest to be found.
Halifax, N. S Is the western termi
nus of the great ferry. Its eastern
ends are Liverpool, London, Havre
and Ilordeaux.
Few A rlcuns, unless the thing
fulls directly under their eyes (and
unless they nre helped, even then,
with n little Information that Is
mighty hard to get), can realize what
an Important seaport Halifax is and
how much Is being done there.
On n vacation trip n few days ago 1
steamed Into the harbor of Halifax
through a narrow space, a "gate" they
call It, between two lines of Hunting
mines that extend from shore to shore
on the little steamer Florlzel of the
Ited Cross line, writes Joseph J. O'Neill
In the New York World.
As we straightened out for our dock
there came Into view an Immense four
stack steamer n mile or so away from
us. She looked rather familiar at first
glance, and even more so when viewed
through the glasses. Undoubtedly
she was one of the' huge passenger
liners tnat all New Yorkers are used
to seeing in tlielr own bay; but there
was something wrong about her. She
looked different. She was of the dull
gray of the I5ritish navy, and on each
side of her, forward and aft, protruded
long, wide-mouthed guns.
The Twenty-Eight Ten.
"What ship is that?" everyone
asked.
Hut the patriotic British oilicers of
the Florlzel were not telling.
Trohnhly something in the trans
port service, or an nuxiliary cruiser,
or t he like." they replied.
Hut If this was a transport or an
auxiliary cruiser It was an unusual
one, for there are mighty few boats
afloat the size of this great gray mon
ster. I'.y driblets information about the
vessel In the harbor came to the ears
of the curious vacation voyagers after
they got ashore. The town is filled
with khaki-clad Tommies, of course.
Appealed to for ' nam" and busi
ness of the big craft they would usu
ally reply: "Caw n't sye. sir, really."
Finally to got this far: "They cnll

Then, at last, 1 chanced to meet nnd
fraternize with a Canadian soldier, a
chap who had just returned from the
other side, wounded, and one who was
glad to get n bit of news about the
United States (because this was con
fidential he belonged here himself,
and showed me proudly his United
States citizenship pppers which lie hud
carried with him throughout two
years of scrapping in Belgium and
France).
"That's the Olympic."
"That big hooker out there? Why,
that's the Olympic!" he said. "I Just
came over in her, and tomorrow
morning she's going out with a pretty
full cargo of Tommies. She's nothin'
but a bloomin' ferry these days!"
And that's what she was the Olym
pic, the former pride of the White
Star line, sister ship of the ill-fated
Titanic, and formerly one of the most
luxurious pnssenger liners afloat.
But now she is Transport Twenty
eight Ten.
And next morning, so early that the
dawn-pink hadn't yet shown over the
eastern horizon, the Olympic went out
on one of her regular ferry-runs. She
Just slipped out, without a whistle
blast, without a sound, Indeed. And,
as my friend In khaki had said, she
took with her u "pretty full cargo of
Tommies'
Now, If you had rambled rbout Hall
fax the night before and asked pri
vates or officers here nnd there,
"What's the big boat taking away
when she goes?" you'd have been told,
"Oh, a few hundred men, maybe; a bit
of supplies, too." And watching the
Olympic slide off through the semi
darkness you wouldn't have been
greatly impressed.
But if you hud had better sources of
Information ns I had. thanks to my
original Tommie-pal and some others
you might have learned that Inside
the dark grny hull were 7,000 men con
signed to t'.ie French front 7,000 stal

wheat fields and towns of the vast Do

acting as second In command of this
battalion if Yankee lads, I was told by
several persons who had ample means
f knowing.
They mimed his name and said that
so enthusiastic was he about the cause
of the allies that he was content, even
eager, to accept a lieutenant colonelcy
In lids battalion, although he had been
of far greater position than that In the
nrmy of his own country, and was
really one of the best known of the
older "fighting men" In Uncle Sam's
service.
I am not giving the name here, be
cause It was whispered In confidence,
and It was said that lie didn't want it
known Just yet that he was fighting
In the service of a foreign monarch.
But all this the departure of 7.000
boys In khaki was but the Incident
of a single day In the port of Halifax.
The men were assembled secretly,
pouring In at night over the lines of
the Intercolonial railway, nt one of
whose piers the big Twenty-eight Ten
was tied ui. And when the town was
dark and quiet they were marched
aboard her and, though you could get
within a block or so, you couldn't ap
proach near, enough to see the throngs
clustered on her di-cks, for you were
halted by n bayonet politely pointed at
your breast.
Great Britain keeps such movements
pretty secret.
A few words more nbout the Olym
pic. There nre several reasons why
she is In the British transport service
and is making trips across the Atlan
tic almost on a regular schedule which
runs approximately like this: Five
days crossing, three days loading, off
again.
One reason Is that she Is commo
dious and speedy. Sire can turn off her

Buck Attacks Cattle.
Altoona, I'a. A four-pronged buck
has been annoying cattle on farms In

LIVES OF TRAVELERS SAVED BY"
"LAND LIGHTHOUSES."
8afety Signals on Desolate English
Waters Were a Necessity In Time
Cone By Many of Them Still
In Existence.
Of all tho remarkable lighthouses lm
existence, nnd there are ninny of them,
what Is described as "the only land
lighthouse" Is the most extraordinary.
This Is the lofty lower. 100 feet high,
ou the lonely levels of Lincoln Heath,
five miles from Lincoln, In the parlslt
of iMiustou. It Is known as "liunston
I'illar," says u writer lu London An
swers. When the Strange building first cuinn
luto being In l'.'l Lincoln heath wus
easily the most dangerous waste place
In F.ngluiitl. About twenty miles
square, It had then no made roads, no
Hlgnposts and no inclosing hedges.
'Iravelers found It a risky place to
venture in, especially In the short days
of winter.
The registers of Leasliighani church,
on the outskirts of the vast solitude,,
contain accounts of tht burials of
many unfortunate travelers who lost
thelf way here nnd perished In snow
storms and tempests.
So notorious were those dangers,
that at Bolter Hanworth ami at Blank
ney. In this region, there are pieces of
land bequeathed as thank-offerings by
strayed wayfarers whose lives hadi
been saved by hearing the church,
bell's chimes, so that their steps were
guided to shelter. The revenues from,
these lands were Intended to secure
the continuance of those nightly ring
ings, so that uo others should run
such risks.
It was Francis Pashwood, Lord le
Iiespenser, who built Iunslon I'illar..
It served ns n signpost by day nnd:
ns a beacon by night, being nt that
time surmounted by a lantern, which
was brilliantly Illuminated.
But, after ome fifty-nine years, n,
good road was nt last iiiailo across
these wilds and the lantern wus no
longer considered necessary. So In.
place of It a colossal stone statue of
George III. was placed there In 1810..
the year of his Jubilee. And there Ir
stands today. '
Besides IUtnston I'illar, there are
many more beacons that were Intend
ed to keep the old-time travelers lu.
the right path. We have one In the
neighborhood of London. This is the
old iron flrepot, or cresset, on the
angle turret of Monken Hadley church,,
near Barnot, placed there originally
hundreds of years ago for the express;
purpose of guiding travelers who
might be coming after nightfall'
through the lonely and deeply wooded,
districts of Enfield Chase. The Iron
pot has, of course, been ol'teu re
newed. A similar flrepot stands on the tow
er of Gillingham church, near Chat
ham, overlooking the Biver Medway.
A much more elaborate affair, which
was as much n "land lighthouse" as
I ninston I'illar, Is the lantern which
still stands on the tower of Great Wei
don church, In the Buckingham Forest
district of Northamptonshire. It was-
lighted every night for the express '
purpose of guiding benighted travelers
to surety through the entangled forest
brakes.
Of course, many of our lighthouses
serving our mariners along our coasts
are actually built on land, notably tho
ruinous North Foreland und the Lizard
lights.
Among the most curious of these ts
Dungeness lighthouse, standing on the
desolate wastes of shingle on the
Kentish coast.
It was about 1015 when the first
lighthouse was built there by a pri
vate speculator, who disposed of dis
interest to one William Luiuplough,.
clerk to the king's kitchen.
Civilized Barter.
One of the curious developments of
the war is the abnormal effect upoi
the money situation in the Scandina
vian countries. These countries are
Hooded with gold in payment of a long:
continued tide of purchases by for
eign countries. To such an extent ha
this persisted that Denmark ha
passed a law allowing the National
bank of Denmark to decline to pur
chase gold burs and foreign coin at
the international gold standard rate.
This Is a notice to foreign buyers Up
bring no more gold if they w ish to pur
chase Danish goods, but instead to
send goods which they have and .which.
Denmark wants. She has too mucl
already and Is well on the way to
becomes n King Midas, as all her food
and drink Is being turned into gold,
and she inny come in danger of starv
ing to death If this keeps up Indefinite

Start of Phrenology.
The first announcement made by
Franz Joseph Gall regarding his sys
tem of phrenology was ln an address
delivered before his medical colleague
In Vienna Just a century and a quar
ter ago. Gall was n native of Baden,
but settled in Vienna In 1781 and begnns
the practice of medicine in the Aus
trian capital. From his boyhood he
had been Interested, ln studying the
craniums of his companions, and many
observations und much study convinced
him that the talents and dispositions of
men may be Inferred with perfect ex
actitude and precision from the extei
nal appearance of the skull. Thls
tlieory he elaborated In many lectures,
pamphlets nnd books, and soon gained
many adherents in the scientific world.
Cocoa From the Enemy's Country.
A cargo of 400 tons of cocoa re
cently arrived In Loudon from the-
former German colony of Cameron
Before the war the colony was
tunny's chief cocon-produclng
nnd from Cnmei-oons and
she derived something like
a year.
