Washington, Dec. 5. President Mc
Kinley sent the following message to
the Fifty -fifth congress after he had
been informed by committees that the
senate . and house awaited any com
munication he wished to make- to
them:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered
necessary by tha war, our, people rejoice in a
Tery satisfactory and steadily increasing de
gree of prosperity evidenced by the largest
volume of business ever recorded. very man
ufacture has been productive, agricultural pur
suits hate yielded abundant returns, labor in
the fields of Industry is better rewarded, rev
enue legislation passed by the present congress
has increased the treasury's r receipts to the
uiuuut csbimuieu uy aubuuribics, iuv
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administrated and its credit advanced
to the first rank, while its currency has been
maiuiameu at iuc wunu a nignest siaauara.
Military service under a common flag and for a
righteous cause has strengthened the national
spirit and served to cement more closely than
ever the fraternal bonds between every section
0 of the country.
The president here takes up the his
tory of the' Cuban insurrection, - the
failure of Spain to successfully cope
with affairs in the island and the un
successful efforts of this country for a
peaceful solution of the matter. He
refers to the destruction of the battle-
snip Maine, a catastropne tne sus
picious nature and horror of which
stirred this nation's heart profoundly."
The initiatory steps leading up to the
war are recounted, the unanimity of
congress in passing needed legislation
to strengthen the executive is praised
and the facts regarding the declara
tion of war are told anew. The presi
dent then recites the salient features
0 of the war. paying a glowing tribute
to America's heroes on land and sea;
refers to Dewey's remarkable victory
at Manila, to the military movements
in Cuba and finally to the destruction
of Cervera's. fleet and the capitulation
of Santiago. Continuing, he says:
" NoanUtt Overture for Peace.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet,
followed by the capitulation of Santiago, hav
ing brought to the Spanish government a real
o izlnt sense of the hopelessness of continuing a
struggle now becoming wholly unequal, it
made overtures of peace through the French
ambassador. Accordingly, on the afternoon of
August 12, M. Cambon. as the plenipotentiary
of Spain, and the secretary of state, as the
plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a
protocol. .
Immediately upon the conclusion of the pro
tocol, I issued a proclamation of August 12.
suspending hostilities on the part of the United
States The necessary orders to that end were
at once given by telegraph. .The blockade of
the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Porto Rico
was in like manner raised. On August 18. the
muster out of luo.000 volunteers, or as near that
' number as was found to be practicable, was
ordered The military committees to' superin
tend the evacuation of. Cuba, Porto . Rico , and
the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed.
The Peace Commission.
Pursuant to the fifth article -of the protocol
I appointed William R. Day, lately secretary
of state: Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye
and George Gray, senators of the United States,
and Whitelaw Held, to be the peace commis
sioners on the part of the United States. Pro-
met on the 1st of October five commissioners
similarly appointed on the part of Spain. The
negotiations have made hopeful progress, so
that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite
treaty of peace before the senate, with a re
view of the steps leading to Its signature.
Bltlltarv. Governments far e l ime.
I do not discuss at this time the government
or the future of the new possessions which will
come to us the result of war with Spain. Such
a discussion will be appropriate after the
treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the mean
time and until congress has legislated other
wise, it will be my duty to continue the mili
tary governments which have existed since our
occupation and give its people security in life
and property and encouragement under, a just
and beneficent rule'
The Nicaragua renal Commission.
The Nicaragua canal commission, under the
championship of Rear Admiral John G. Walker,
appointed July 24. 1897. act of June 4 of that
year, has nearly completed its labors, and the
proper route, the feasibility, and the cost of
construction of an Inter-oceanio canal by a
Nloaraguan route will be laid before you. Ia
the performance of its task the commission re
ceived all possible courtesy and assistance from
the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
which thus testified their appreciation of the
importance of giving a speedy and practical
outcome to the great project that has for so
many years engrossed the attention of the re
spective countries. -
The Parle Exposition.
There is now every prospect that the partici
pation of the United States in the universal ex
position to be held in Paris In 1900 will be on a
scale commensurate with the advanced posi
tion held by our products and - industries in the
world's chief marts. By a provision in the
sundry civil appropriation act of July 1. 1891 a
sum not to exceed 65j,0j0 was allotted for the
organisation of a commission to care for the
proper preparation and Installation of
American exhibits and for the display of
suitable exhibits, by the several executive de
partments, particularly by the department of
agriculture, the fish commission and the Smith
sonian institution, in the representation of the
government of the United States. Pursuant
to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand
W. Peck, of Chicago, commissioner general,
with an assistant commissioner general and
secretary.
Kelatloes with Great Britain.
Our relations with Great Britain have con
tinued on the most friendly tooting. Assenting
to out request, the protection of Americans
and their interests in Snanlsh inrisdlction was
assumed by the diplomatlo and consular repre
sentatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their
de'lcate and arduous trust with tact and seal,
eliciting high commendation.
It will give me special satisfaction if I shall
be authorized to communicate to you a favor
able conclusion of the ' -pending negotiations
with Great Britain In respect to the Dominion
of Canada It Is the earnest wish of this gov
ernment to remove all sources of discord and
Irritation in relations with the neighboring do
minion. The trade between the two countries
Is constantly increasing and it is Important to
both countries that all reasonable facilities
should be granted for its development.
The Annexation of the Hawaiian Island a.
Pending the consideration by the senate of
the treaty signed. Jane Id 1897, by the pleni
potentiaries of the United States and the re
public of Hawaii, providing for the annexation
of the Islands, a joint resolution to accomplish
the same purpose by accepting the off --red ces
sion and incorporating the ceded territory into
the union, was adopted by the congress and
approved July 7, 1898 I thereupon directed
the United States steamer Philadel
phia to convey Rear Admiral . Miller
to Honolulu and entrusted to his
hands this important legislative act to
be delivered to the. presldestdent of Hawaii
with whom the admiral and the United States
minister were authorized to make appropriate
arrangements for transferring the sovereignty
of the islands to the United States. This was
simply but impressively accomplished on the
12th day of August last, by the delivery of a
certified copy of the resolution to President
Dole, -who thereupon yielded up to the re ore
sen tatlves of the government of the United
States the sovereignty and publio property of
the Hawaiian islands.
Pursuant to the terms of the joint resolution
and in exercise of authority thereby conferred
upon men, I directed that the civil, judicial
and military powers theretofore exercised by
the officers of the government of the republic
of Hawaii should continue to be exercised by
those officers until congress shall provide a
government for the incorporated territory sub-,
ject to my power to remove such officers and to
fill vacancies
The Cur's Disarmament Proposal.
The proposal of the' czar for a general reduc
tion of the vast military establishment that
weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of
peace, was communicated to this government
with. earnest invitation to be represented in
the conference which it Is contemplated to as
semble with a view to discussing the means of
accomplishing so desirable a result His maj
esty was at once informed of the cordial sym
pathy of this government with the principal
involved -in his exalted proposal' and of the
readiness of the United States to take part in
the conference.
4 lim Against Turkey.
The newly accredited envoy of the United
States to the Ottoman port carries instruc
tions looklng.to the disposal of matters in con
troversy with Turkey for a number of years
He is especially charged to press for a just set
tlement of our claims for indemnity by reason
of the destruction of property of American
missionaries resident in that country during
the Armenian troubles of 1895 as well as for
the recognition of older claims of equal just
ness Information to Benefit Industries.
During the past year the Important work of
collecting . Information of practical benefit to
American Industries and trade through the
agency of the diplomatic and consular officers
has been steadily advanced and in order to lay
such date before the publio with the
least delay the practice begun in
January, 1898, of issuing the com
mercial reports from day to day as they are
received by the department of state. It is be
lieved that for promptitude, as well as fullness
of Information, the service thus supplied to our
merchants and manufacturers will be found to
be a sensible improvement and to merit the
liberal support of congress
Matter Concerning the Treasarv.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all souroes
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, in
cluding 84,751.223 received from sale of Pacific
railroads, amounted to il05.3.'l,33 and its ex
penditures to i441.303.58i There was obtained
from customs 149, 575,062 and from internal
revenue tl70.900.64l. Our dutiable imports
amounted to 324,7, 479. a decrease of i 68, 156,
690 over the preceding year, and importations
free of duty amounted to 291,414,175, a de
crease from the preceding year of (90,524,068.
Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of
the preceding year by t24.212.068.
The total tax collected on distilled spirits was
192 516,999, on manufactured tobacco 1 36. 23 J. 52 J,
and on fermented liquors $33,515,4.'!. We ex
ported merchandise during the year amount
ing to $1.231,48!, 330, an increase of $180,488,774
from the preceding year.
It is estimated upon the basts of present
revenue laws that the receipts of the govern
ment for the year eodlng June 30, 1899. will be
577.874,607, and Its expenditures t689.8r4.6l7, re
sulting in a deficiency of 1 12,000. 000.
On the 1st of December, 1838. there was held
in the treasury gold coin amounting to $138. -441,547.
gold bullion amounting to 133.502,545.
silver bullion amounting to 193.359.250 and
other forms of money amounting to i451.963.98L
On the same date the amount of money of all
kinds in circulation, or not included in treas
ury holdings, was $1,836,8.'9.5U4, an increase for
the year of $165,794,966. Estimating our popu
lation at 75,104,000 at the time mentioned, the
per capita circulation was $25.00. On the same
date there was in the treasury gold bullion
amounting to $133,502,515.
The provisions for strengthening the re
sources of the treasury in connection with the
war has given increased confidence in the pur
pose and power of the government to maintain
the present standard, and has established more
firmly than., ever, the national credit at. home
and abroad. '
I renew so muoh of my recommendation of
December. 1897, as follows: "That when any
of the United States notes are presented for
redemption in gold such notes shall be kept
and set apart and only paid out in exchange for
gold. Thts is an obvious duty. If the holder
of the United States note prefers the gold and
gets it from the government, he should not
receive back from the government a United
States note without paying gold in exchange for
it. The reason for this is made all the more
apparent when the government issues an issue
bearing debt to provide gold for the redemp
tion of United States notes a non-interest-bearing
debt. Surely it should not pay tbsm
out again except on demand and for gold. If
they are put out in any other way they may re
turn again, to be followed by another bond Is
sue to redeem them, another interesting-bearing
debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt
This recommendation was made In the belief
that such provisions of law would insure to a
greater degree the safety of the present stand
ard and better protect our currency from the
dangers to which it is subjected from a dis-.
turbance in the general business conditions of
the country.
In my judgment the present condition of the
treasury amply justifies the immediate enact
ment ot the legislation recommended one year
ago, under which portion of the gold hold
ings should be placed in a trust fund from
which greenbacks should, be redeemed upon
presentation, but when once redeemed should
not thereafter be paid out except for gold.
It is not to be Inferred that other legislation
relating to our. currency is hot required. On
the contrary, there is an obvious demand for
It. The importance of ' adequate provision
which will insure to our future a money stand
ard related as our money standard now and to
that or our commercial rivals is generally
re cognized.
The companion proposition that our domes
tic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet
be so related to the needs of our industries and
internal commerce as to be adequate and re
sponsive to such needs is a proposition scarce
ly less important. The subject, in all its parts,
is commended to the wise -consideration of the
congress.
Investigation ' Tellow Fever.
In my last annual message I recommended
that congress, authorize the appointment of a
commission for the purpose of making syste
matic investigations with reference to the
cause and-provocation of yellow fever. This
matter has acquired an increased importance
" as a result of the military occupation of the
island of Cuba and the commercial Intercourse
between this island and the United States
which we have every reason to expect. The
. sanitary problems connected with our new re
lations with the island of Cuba and the acquisi
tion ot Porto Rico are no less important than
those relating to finance, commerce and
administration.
I Increase of the Army.
Under the act of congress approved April 26,
1898, authorizing the president in his discretion,
upon a declaration of war by congress, or a
declaration by congress that war exists, I di
rected the increase of the regular army to the
maximum of 62.000, authorized in said act.
There are now in the regular army 57,862 offi
cers and men. In said act it was provided "that
at the end of any war In which the United
States may become involved the army shall be
reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the
: same arm of the service or absorption by promo-
i tion or henoraMe discharge under sucbregula-
I tlona-as the secretary of war may establish of su
i pernumerary commissioned officers and the hon
orable discharge or transfer of su ernumerary
enlisted men, and nothing contained in this act
shall be construed as authorizing the perma-
I nent increase of the command or enlisted force
j of the regular army beyond that now provided
act except as to the increase of 25 majors pro
vided for in section 1 hereof."
The Importance of legislation for the per
manent increase of the armv is therefore mani
fest, and the recommendation of the secretary
or war for that purpose has my unqualified ap
proval There can be no question that at this
time and probably for some time in the future.
100,000 men will be none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation.' At all events.
whether that number shall be required per
manently or not, the power should be given to
the president to enlist that force if. In his dis
cretion. it should be necessary; and the further
discretion should be given him to recruit with
in the above limit from the inhabitants of the
islands with the government .of which-we are
charged.
It is my purpose to muster out the entire vol
unteer army as soon as the congress shall pro
vide for the increase or the regular establish
ment. This will be only an act or justice and
will be much appreciated by the brave men who
left their homes and employments to help the
country in its emergency.
Pacific Railroads.
In my last annual message I stated: "The
Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold
under the decree of the United States court for
the district of Nebraska the 1st and 2d or No
vember or this year. The amount due the
government consisted of the principal of the
subsidy bonds, i27.236.5i2 and the accrued in
terest thereon, 431,211.511.07, making the total
Indebtedness -i 58.4 18.221 75. The bid at the sale
covered the first mortgage Hen and the entire
mortgage claim of the government, principal
and interest"
This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon
eluded. By a decree of the court in that case
an upset price for the property was fixed at a
sum which would yield to the government only
2.600.000 upon Its ilenr The sale at the-instance
oi the government was postponed first
to December 15, 1897, and later, upon the appli
cation or the United States was postponed to
February 16. 189a
Having satisfied myself that the interests of
the government required that an effort should
be made to obtain a larger sum, I directed the
secretary of treasury, under the act passed
March 3, 1837. to pay out or the treasury to the
persons entitled to receive the same, the
amounts due upon all prior mortgages upon
the middle and eastern divisions or said rail
road out or any money in the treasury not oth
erwise appropriated.
It is a gratifying fact that the result or these
proceedings against the Union Pacific system
and the Kansas Pacific line is that the govern
ment has received on account of its subsidy
claim the sum of $64,751,223.75. an Increase or
418,997.163.75 over the sum which the reorgan
ization committee originally agreed to bid for
the joint property, the government receiving
its whole claim. , principals and interest, in
Union Pacific and the prlnclpal'bf 'its debt on
the Kansas Pacific railroad.
Department of Justice Building.
I deem it my duty to call to the attention of
congress the condition of the present building
occupied by the department of justice. The
business or that department has increased
greatly since it was established in its present
quarters. The building now occupied by It is
neither large enough nor or suitable arrange
ment for the proper accommodation of the
business . or the department The su
pervising architect has pronounced it
unsafe and unsuited for the use
to which it is put I may likewise
refer to the inadequate accommodations pro
vided for the supreme court in the capitol and
suggest the wisdom of making provision for the
erection or a separate building for the court
and its officers and library upon available
ground near the capitoL
The Postal Service.
The postal service or the country advances
with extraordinary growth Within 20 years
both the revenues and the expenditures or the
post office department-thaw multiplied three
fold. In the last ten years they have nearly
doubled. Our postal business grows much more
rapidly than our population. Jt now involves an
expenditure of - (100, 000. 000 a year, numbers
73,000 post offices and enrolls 200.00J employes.
This remarkable extension of a service which
is an accurate index of the public conditions
presents gratifying evidence of the advance
ment or education, of the increasa of commu
nication and business activity and of the im
provement of mall facilities, leading to their
constantly-augmenting use.
It is pleasing to be able to say that the serv
ice in the territory which has come under our
control is already materially improved.
Venezuela Dlspatn with Ureal Britain.
The arbitral tribunal appointed under the
treaty or February, 1897, between Great Brit
ain and Venezuela to determine the boundary
line between the latter and the colony of Brit
ish Guiana is to convene at Paris dur
ing the present month It is a source
of much gratification to . this government
to see the friendly-resort of arbitration
applied to the settlement of this controversy.
not alone because of the earnest part we have
had in bringing about the result, but also be
cause the two members named on behalf of
Venezuela. Mr. Chler Justice Fuller and Mr.
Justice Brewer, chosen from our highest court,
appropriately testify the continuing interest
we feel in the definitive adjustment or the
question according to the strictest rule or jus
tice. Naval Secretary's Benmmnritlnn Urged.
The following recommendations of the secre
tary of the navy relative to the increase of the
navy have my earnest approval: -.

The Pension Rolls.
There were on the pension rolls on June 30.
1893.418,714 names, an increase of nearly 18,000
over. the number on the roll on the same day
or the preceding year. The amount appropri
a ted by the act of December 22. 1896, for the
payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1898
was .140. 000. COt Eight million, seventy thou
sand, eight hundred and. seventy-two dollars
and forty-six cents was appropriated by the
act of March 31, 1893. to cover deficiencies
in army pensions and repayments in the
sum of 12,020 33, making a total of
tl4a082.S92.70 available for the pavment of
pensions during the fiscal year -1898. The
amount disbursed from that sum was $144,651.'
87a 80, leaving a balance of 13,431.012.99 unex
pended on the Sith of June. 18J8, which was
covered Into the treasury. There were 3fc9
names aaaea to the rolls during the year by
special acts passed at tha second session of the
Fifty-fifth congress, making a total or 6.-186
pensioners by congressional enactment since
186L
Public Lands.
The public lands disposed of by the govern
ment during the year reached 8.43.8Ji92 acres.
an increase of 614,780.26 acres over the previous
year. The total receipts from publio lands
during the fiscal year amounted to $2,277,995. 18,
an increase of $190,053.9J over the preceding
year. The lands embraced in the II forest
reservations which were suspended by
the act or June 4, 1897, again' became
subject to the operations or the procla
mations or February 22. 1897. creating
them, which added an estimated amount or
19.981.36i acres to the area embraced in the re
serves previously created. In addition thereto
two new reserves were created during the year
the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake reserves in
California, embracing 1,644,594 acres, and the
Prcscott reserve in Arizona, embracing 1 1.249
acres, while the Pecos river in New Mexico has
been changed and enlarged to include 120,000
additional acrea
At the close or the year 30 forestry reserva
tions, not including those or the Afognac forest
and fish culture reserve In Alaska, had bsen
created by executive proclamation under sec
tion 24 or the act or March S, 1891, embracing an
estimated area or 40,719.474 acres The depart
ment or the interior has inaugurated a forest
system, made possible by the act of July. 189J,
for a graded force of officers in control of the
reserves This system has onlv been In full
operation since August, but good results have
already been secured in many sections. The
reports received indicate that the system of
patrol has not only prevented destructive fires
from gaining headway but has diminished the
number of fires
The Patent Office.
The total rectipts or th? patent office during
the past year were $1,253,948 41 The expendi
tures were $1,081.63179, leaving a surplus or
$172,314.65.
The Indians.
The special attention of the congress is called
to that part or the report or the secretary or
the interior in relation to the five civilized
tribes It is noteworthy that the general con
dition or the Indians shows marked progress.
But one outbreak or a serious character oc
curred during the year and that among the
Chippewa Indians or Minnesota, who happily
have been suppressed. While it has not yet
been practicable to enforce all the provisions of
the act of June 28, 1898. ' for the protection of
the people of the Indian territory and for
other purposes," it is having a salutary effect
upon the nations composing the five tribes
The Dawes commission reports that the most
gratifying results and irreater advance toward
the attainment of the objects of the govern
ment have been secured in the past year than
In any previous year. I cannot too strongly in
dorse the recommendation of the commission
and or the secretary or the interior ror the
necessity or providing for the education or the
30.000 white children resident in the Indian
territory.
The Department of Agriculture.
The department or agriculture has been
active in the past year. Explorers have been
sent to many or the countries or the eastern
and western hemispheres ror seeds and plants
that may be useful to the United States and
with the further view or opening up markets
ror our surplus products. The forestry division
of the department is giving special at
tention to the treeless regions of our country
and is introducing species specially adapted to
semi-arid regions.
Anniversary of Founding of Washington.
In the year 1933 will occur the centennial an
niversary or the rounding or the city or Wash
ington ror the permanent capital or the govern
ment or the United States by authority or an
act or congress approved July 16. 1790. In May.
1800. the archives and general offices of the fed
eral government were removed to this placa
On the 17th or November. 1800. the national
congress met here for the first time and
assumed exclusive control of the federal dis
trict and city. This Interesting event assumes
all the more significance when we recall the
circumstances attending the choosing of the
sit?, the naming of the capitol in honor of the
father or his country and the interest taken by
him in the adoption or plans ror its future de
velopment on a magnificent srale. These orig
inal plans have been wrought out with a con
stant progress and a signal success even be
yond anything their f ramers could have fore
seen. The people of the country are justly
proud or - the distinctive beauty and govern
ment of the capital and of the rare instruments
of science and education which here find their
natural home.
A movement lately inaugurated by the citi
zens to have the anniversary celebrated with
fitting ceremonies, including perhaps the es
tablishment or a handsome permanent me
morial to mark so historical an occasion and to
give it more than local recognition, has met
with general ravor on the part of the public.
I recommend to congress the granting or an
appropriation ror this purpose and the ap
pointment or a committee from its respective
bodies. It might also be advisable to author
ize the president to appoint a committee from
the country at large, which, acting with the
congressional and District of Columbia com
mittee, can complete the plans for an appro
priate national celebration.
Ihe Allen Contract Law.
The alien contract law is shown by experi
ence to need some amendment. A measure pro
viding better protection for seamen is pro
posed; the rightful application or the eight
hour law ror the benefit ef. labor and of the
principle of arbitration are suggested for con
sideration and I commend these' subjects to the
caref ull attention of congress.
