PHOENIX. ARIZONA, DEC. S, 1910.
Arizona Remains a Territory.
Had there been any remaining
doubt as to the fatef statehood as
related to the sitting constitutional
convention, that doubt was removed
yesterday when thq convention caused
to be finally imbedded in the consti-
tution "the recall" in all its vicious
ness. The clause adopted yesterday is
there to stay, as it cannot be changed
under the rules except by an affirma
tive two-thirds vote, and of course it
is utterly impossible to get two-thirds
of the convention to leave "the recall"
out of the constitution.
There was, to be sure, little doubt
'of statchood's fate in any event. The
adoption of the initiative and referen
dum principle, with no restrictions
thoreon, and sundry other radical fea
tures of the constitution, had prac
tically assured the defeat of Arizona's
application at "Washington. But "the
recall2' indubitably "do settleMt" Had
the convention confined Itself to the
authorization of the referendum in
certain cases, there would have been
no objection in the territory, and, we
are confident, no objection in, Wash
ington, for Mr. Taft has hitherto made
it clear that he approves certain fea
tures of the referendum as we made
clear, in the late campaign. The con
vontion has chosen to "go the whole
"hog" in radicalism, however. It has
provided for the "initiative" on such
a basis that the representative form
of government, including the consti
tution itself, is set aside, and it has
provided for the utilization of "the
recall" in a manner that not even
Oregon has dared to sanction. Ore
gon, at least, protects the judiciary
from the evils of "the recall."
Statehood in the immediate future
can be made possible only by voting
down the constitution which this con
vention has framed, and at this time
such action by the people docs not
seem probable. Under the terms of
Che enabling act, the rejection of the
"constitution by the people of Arizona
would give the territory one more
chance. Anpther constitutional con
vention would have to be held a
convention made up of the same dele
gates as in this convention, however
and were the second constitution to
be free from objectionable features
from the "Washington viewpoint, and,
having been ratified by the people.
the admission of the territory would
Immediately follow.
But that way out of the difficulty
is not encouraging. In view of the
manifest radicalism voiced in the con
vention. There seems little probabil
ity that even an adverse vote by the
people would lead tne delegates to be
more thoughtful and conservative.
And, as already suggested, the wave
of radicalism which swept over the
territory two months ago has not ap
parently subsided sufficiently to war
ranttexpectation that the constitution
as now framed will fall of ratifica
tion. Hence, taking tiic most optimistic
view of the situation possible, the
conclusion is inevitable that the ad
mission of Arizona into the Union
has been delayed Indefinitely.
And, strangely enough, having defi
nitely defeated statehood and so de
stroyed its own usefulness, the con
vention still goes about its work with
all the earnestness and solemnity of
.a child building mud pics. So far as
the public Is concerned, any further
interest that it may take in the pro
ceedings of the convention will be
from mild and disinterested curiosity
In observing' the obviously useless
work of earnest men.
system, more than it needs anything
else.
As we stated the other day, the
council apparently decided wisely in
favor of the so-called shallow system
of conduits. This decision makes the
existing system available for Inclu
sion within the new system, and the
only remaining question is the ono of
price in taking over the existing sys
tem. On this question the attitude taken
by the city government is, we believe,
the wise attitude. The members of
the council, all of them reputable
citizens and fully advised of all the
facts In the premises, believe that the
best course Is to buy tho existing
system at the stitpulatcd price,
$60,000.
The explanation of Mayor Christy
with reference to the question Df price
will, we believe, be conclusive in the
minds of Phoenix people. The mayor's
unselfish devotion to the public inter
est is so unquestionable that in all
probability his advice would be taken
without an accompanying explanation.
There is no doubt, we believe, that
the owners of the system have, with
in the past two years, offered It for
sale at a much lower price than they
now ask. But, to be plain about it,
they are in a position to work some
what of a hold-up game on the city.
The mayor explains that, whereas the
system originally cost some J3S.000 to
install, there has been additional ex
penditure by the owners to tho
amount of approximately J 10,000. Ho
states, also, that the investigations of
the council have disclosed that tho
cost of labor and material has ad
vanced so materially since the system
was installed that it is doubtful
whether It could be duplicated today
for $00,000. Ho states, moreover, that
official examinations of the plant
show that it is in good physical con
dition. In view of these" facts, wc believe
the vote in the coming election should
be in favor of the proposed purchase.
The Sewer Proposition.
The taxpayers of Phoenix will be
required In a few days to cast an ad
visory vofe on th question of pur
chasing the sewer system.
The question Is of much more than
usual moment, for an adverse vote
would undoubtedly postpone for two
years at least the installation of a
sower system.
While we do not relish the Idea of
paying any fancy price for the exist
ing system. It is obviously necessary
to get It out of the way If the general
sewer proposition Is not to be unduly
delayed.
Phoenix needs an adequate sewer
The New Leader . of the Arizona
Democracy.
"We salute Judge Parsons of Doug
las, tho new leader of the Arizona de-.
mocracy. Judge Parsons has demon
strated his control of the constitu
tional convention, day after day, and
never more effectively than yester
day.
The conservative, . old line demo
crats, backed by a telegram from
United States Senator Joseph Weldon
Bailey, In which the distinguished
democratic leader of the senate
warned the democratic delegates that
the inclusion of the initiative and
referendum and recall would defeat
statehood at Washington, vainly ral
lied their forces for one last charge
upon the breastworks of" the social
ists. They besought and implored the
radicals to take note of the fact that
one of the best friends Arizona has
had at Washington was giving the
advice, as a democrat to democrats.
Here and there there was wavering
in the hollow square which had been
formed with consummate skill by
Parsons, aided by his able lieutenants,
Cunniff, Hunt and Winsor. But in
the final charge the square stood
firm, like the old guard at Waterloo
but there the parallel ends, for the
old guard was exterminated, whereas
the Parsons cohorts remained in tri
umphant possession of the field.
With' cold and biting scorn. Judge
Parsons met the invocation of Bailey's
name. Bailey to h m was as odious
as a republican. What was it to him
and his followers what Bailey
thought? Bailey was a dead one.
There was in Arizona a new democ
racy which knew not Joseph of Texas.
Its patron saint was one Mover, pres
ident of the Western Federation of
Miners. One was reminded of that
incident in the French chamber, fol
lowing the revolution, arid immediate
ly after the beheading of Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette. Most of Eu
rope was preparing to-take up arms
against France. Dumoricux, heading
the revolutionary army, was holding
the enemy in check on the frontier,
but the ultimate issu; was in .doubt
Napoleon had not yet emerged from
obscurity. A delegate who would to
day be classified as a ''conservative
dynamiter" had suggested that per
haps the revolutionists had been too
violent, and perhaps it would be well
to cater somewhat to foreign opinion
by abating the reign of blood. The
bloody handed Danton turned to .this
delegate and to the convention, and
thundered: "The kings of Europe are
uniting against us. We accept the
gage of battle, and hurl at their feet
the head of a king!" Judge Parsons
hurled at the feet of the conservative
democrats the head of Senator Bailey,
and contemptuously told them to
make the most of It. And the rad
icals checrqd him to the roof.
We advise our readers to take note
of Judge Parsons of Douglas, and
watch his future. Only two years
ago he was a somewhat unknown
lawyer of Douglas. His first entry
Into politics, so far as we recall, was
his candidacy for the democratic
nomination for the city council. He
was beaten, and promptlr announced
his Independent candidacy, .as a so
cialist. He was elected, and from
that time he has been coming to the
front. Although a socialist, he has
succeeded in persuading the Arizona 1

Finances and Markets
New York, Dec. 7. Prices moved
irregularly in the stock market today
and, while the net changes were up,
a halting undertone reflected the con
dition born largely of the absence of
an investment demand. A heavy
opening was followed immediately by
a smart rally, but before noon the
list was again under pressure and
prices made new low records for the
movement. In the latter session
practically all lost ground was recov
ered and then the market relapsed
into extreme dullness, which contin
ued to the end. Further digestion of
the president's message appears to
have convinced Wall street's sober
element that the recommendations
contained therein are .entirely in ac
cord with the conservatism so often
expressed by the administration and
for the best interests of the financial,
commercial and industrial world.
Bullion amounting to almost JSOO.000
was received by the Bank of England
from an undisclosed source. Foreign
exchange here indicated a further
transfer of loans to London. Local
trading for that market was insignifi
cant, with some buying of United

EUGENIE
Recently ex-Empress Eugenie, de
siring to visit tlie royal ' palace in
Paris, once her home, decided to do so
incognito. Hoping to escape observa
tion, slie joined a party of "personally
conducted tourists." It is said no one
paid any particular attention to the
demure little old woman until tlie par
ty stood within a room which had once
been a part of the imperial suite and
the guide began to explain that it was
once the bed chamber of "the little
prince who died." At tlie words
Eugenie fainted and betrayed her
Identity, for "the little prince" had
been her beloved son.
Who can tell what floodgates of
memory were opened by the thought
less recital of the man who was paid
to tell the story of the misfortunes of
the Bonapartes to every stranger who
pays his fee for admission to the pal
ace In which tliis astonishing family
once lived, loved, despaired and sor
rowed, and from which in a few rapid-
.Jy moving years the members entirely
vanished?
To few women has it been giv-n so
deeply of the cup of joy. or so to drain
the cup of sorrow arid disappointment
to the dregs as lias Eugenie, once
empress of the French, now an exile
in the land of France's foes.
Yet over and. above all, Eugenie was
a woman a mother who loved only as
a mother can. A woman with a wom
an's capacity for great joy and for
great srtrrow. When Eugenic fainted
in tlie palace it was not of "the prince
who died" that she thought, but of
the child who had been snatched away
from her embrace; tlie boy who had
gone away, oh, so long ago, and left
her arms and her heart empty.
Because of her maternal sorrows
Eugenie comes on a footing with every
other, mother the world over, for be
tween her and every other mother is
forged a bond of sympathy known only
to tlie sisterhood of mothers.
All this world round there are moth
ers who grow weak and without cour
age at recollection of "tlie baby that
died." There are bottom drawers in
many a home in which are hidden
away a tiny shoe, a rattle and the little
dresses baby used to wear, and which
no one touches now except the mother
when sho comes to recollect and to
pray. No one sees in each article in
the bottom drawer the story of lost
hopes and shattered dreams, ext-ept tlie
faithful mother, who can never forget
the little body she once cuddled to her
own.
Eugenic fainting in tlie palace was
not the ex-empress, tlie woman who
had shone in high place, but the moth
er still cherishing memories of a little
head snuggled close to her breast and
the childish prattle that made life's
sweetest music. Eugenic still grieving
for her dead boy (lead. oh. so many
long years finds sympathy that would
bo denied Eugonic, the empress, frii-v-ing
over lost glories. For in her grief
over her lost child every mother can
understand her, because maternal
losses speak in a language of their own
to every good woman the world over.
