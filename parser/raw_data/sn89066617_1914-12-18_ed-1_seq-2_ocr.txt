SAFEGUARDING THE COUNTRY.
The message delivered by President Wilson to Congress a few days ago
"was truly the voice of the American people. Iir. Wilson declared that he has
tried to find out what the masses of this country are really thinking: and feel
ing and hoping. There is no doubt that he has come nearer doing it than have
the clamoreis for war.
Thoughts of aggression we should banish fa- fm. us. Conquest of other
I-1- ' a m"h ruled cut as conquest of our ov.ti. As Ivh Wilson so aptly
..aid, we should give the cid ideal America a free coarse to run and be glori
fied. And he rises to a great power when he shows the criminal folly of doing
uT.ythnj which may destroy the splendid opportunity which may socn be
ours to help the world to gather once lucre about the altar cf peace.
It would be a sad day for mankind if the European .war should have the
effect not only of bringing misery upon the countries engaged in it, but should
put out the light of the world vhich the United States is holding up to the
nations of the earth.
The true ambition cf this republic cf freedom has always been to let
other nations alone, just sz President Wilson says, and while it will always
pursue that course, the belief is steadily growing that the United Slates
should have a larger standing army and a better navy.
The trained soldiers of this country would be hopelessly inadequate
thould a great power attempt lo invade the United States. The :avy, which
ranks as one of the largest in the world in number of fighting vessels, is not
properly manned.
Efforts of American statesmen and Newspapers, who aie crying for war,
are talking to deaf cars, but those who think calmly must naturally lock to
Congress to properly prepare this country for an emergency, even though it
may never be needed.

IS TIIE SOUP HOUSE A CURSE?
With winter and ike holiday season hero, it is only natural that the
thoughts of many turn to the pc?r. Charity is more mcded in the cold
weather than during the. warm seasons, but it is a blcsring all the year round.
As necessary as it is, there are times when charity is abused by those
whom it is intended to aid. The soup house, laudable as v. ere the aims of
those who created it, attracts undesirables to a city in which it is maintained.
St. Louis is supplying soup to an amty cf unemployed daiiy. Last winter
thousands gathered at these municipal lunch counters and partook of that
which was offered.
Singular as it may be, only men are fed. And last year, while twenty
live hundred men were given lodging at the various police stations, crdv
twenty-five of them rei ponded when the city p. eked lor 2.003 men to shove;
simw at 52.50 a day.
The soup house in St. Lcuis simply lures men who are unv. i'ding to work,
and thir- is the result wherever food is given for the asking. Every hungry
matt should be fed, of course, but if he accepts the food in the same spirit in
which it is given, he is willing to work.
Cities that are large enough to maintain soup houses, should require men
who. have the privilege of this charity to work. This would keep the profes
sional tramp out and it would take care of the deserving who are actually
iu need. - " .
, But the most unfortunate feature of the soup house is the absence of
women and little children. No one possessed cf the miik of human kindness
would begrudge feed given to women or little boys and girls.
While, the hundreds of unemployed men eat regularly as the city's guests,
there are several times as many women and children in the slums who arc
cold and hungry. And this makes the soup house a farce.
Large cities should feed the men who are hur.gr' and willing to work, bat
it should not encourage the habitual wanderer. The money that is being
stitiandered on tramps should be used to take care of the widows and orphans,
who are forgotten in the hustle and bustle of life.
Yhile St. Louis is boarding several thousand able-bodied tramps, doesn't
it ever give a thought to the helpless women and children who are suffering
during these bleak and cold December days?

like to proclaim in the same breath
the passing of railroad-baiting less in

when co.-,t is highest ar.d improve

and provide an ample earning in good i
times to enable extensive betterment
to be made in the dull period. This
would tend to better service in the
days of the revival. Meanwhile the
expenditure for betterments would re
lieve the general dullness amid such
conditions as we complain of today.
"Through agitation and restriction,
there has come impaired credit, uniii

WILLINGNESS TO OBLIGE
THE public has a vlzht to something more
than perfunctory service from those who
supply its telephone needs. '
There is something more to a telephone ser
vice than merely placing at the disposal of the
public adequate telephone equipment.
. Courtesy, willingness to oblige and patience,
under trying conditions cn the part of telephone
employes, promote friendly feeling and are essen
tial to the best kind of telephone service.
