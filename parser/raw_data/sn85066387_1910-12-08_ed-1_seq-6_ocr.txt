* I ''HE strong recommendation in President Taft's message in
I favor of the mail contract bill calls attention to some results
"*\u25a0 of the congressional inquiry into corrupt methods that have
been employed to defeat any measure intended
to subsidize American shipping. The'\ foreign
steamship companies plying from Atlantic
ports constitute a powerful and influential
interest,^ and they maintain a strong lobby
and a well served literary bureau to create sentiment against any
measure designed to promote American shipping.
It is the testimony of William H. Douglas, formerly a member
of congress, before the congressional committee, that the foreign
steamship companies had spent money freely to "influence senti
ment against American shipping." By way of specifications con
cerning matters within his own knowledge the witness explained
ihat this was done "by preparing articles in newspapers which were
widely distributed and by the employment of agents." He believed
that money had been spent in Washington in the way of dinners
and other entertainments, but, of course, activities of this character
were kept well under cover. When Mr. Douglas was asked if he
knew an}' of these agents he remarked, "I hardly think they would
want to know me." Indeed, it is not to be expected that men
emploj'ed on such work would court any publicity or notice that
could possibly be escaped.
Mr. Taft puts the case briefly:
Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal
will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail itself in
international maritime business of this great contribution to/the means
of the world's commercial intercourse. *
Quite aside from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant
marine, where can we find the seafaring population necessary as a natural
naval reserve, and where could we find, in case of war, the transports
and subsidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without a body?
For. many reasons I can not too strongly urge upon the congress the
passage of a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to
guarantee the establishment and rapid development of an American mer
chant marine, the restoration of the American flag to its ancient place
upon the seas.
Japan is not a wealthy nation, but it can afford to pay a subsidy
of $500,000 a year in aid of each and ever}*- Japanese steamship -plying
across the Pacific, and if this policy is not met by the United States
it is a question of only a short time when Tapan will monopolize the
Foreign Opposi=
tion to Ameri=
can Shipping
commerce of the Pacific ocean.
This country is asked to spend uncounted millions to. dig a
deep waterway from Chicago to the gulf, but every proposition to
help American shipping, even in the moderate way of a mail con
tract subvention is bitterly opposed by hostile interests, of which
the foreign steamship owners present the most conspicuous example.
AMONG the many serious problem? of congressional apportion
ment that must come up for settlement' consequent on the
census is that of representation for the southern states. Many
-] of these states have practically disfranchised
the negro, but at the same, time they claim
representation in the house on the basis of
population. The question is raised whether
in apportioning the quota of representatives
the disfranchised negroes should be eliminated from consideration.
The constitution of the United States says :
When the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for
president and vice president of the United States, representatives in
congress, the executive and judicial officers of a state, or the members
of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such
state, being 21 years ofageand citizens of the United States, or in any
yvay abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the
basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which -
the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male
citizens 21 \-ears of age in such state. ' \ '"<
It is a delicate question, which congress hesitates to touch.
In spite of the practical disfranchisement of the negroes it is not
likely that. action will be had, even if the matter is settled by the
present congress. Of course, the next house of representatives,
which will be democratic, need not be expected to take any measures
calculated to reduce representation of the south. If, on the other
liand. the present congress should make the apportionment,* the
democrats will contend that the negroes are not technically deprived
of their right to vote, although their actual exclusion is effected by
the requirement of qualifications which they are unable to fulfill.
A Difficult
Problem of
Apportionment
THE controversy concerning freight rates from coast points to
interior centers of distribution, on which tHe: state railroad com
mission will he asked to pass, stipplies an example of the lack
of homogeneity and comprehensiveness in the
existing system for regulation of rates. The
logical and the expedient plan for regulation
would be to treat them all" by one ' systemTof
official machinery and as a' comprehensive
whole. The fact is that intrastate and interstate rates are inter
dependent and arc all parts of a single business; The whole
should be committed to the jurisdiction of a\single official- body,
which, of course, would be the interstate commerce commission. '
For example, if the interstate commission reduces rates from
the east to Reno or other intermountain points under the mileage
basis law, that body must at the same time logically recognize) the
geographical facts of competition by water, and will accordingly
reduce existing rates from the coast cities to Reno and the corre
sponding points. But the same rule should apply to rates from the
coast to points in the! interior of the state, while at the same time
the adjustment of these rates is left to. another official' body, the
state railroad commission, which may or may not recognize the
equities governing the action of the federal commission:
Altogether it is an anomalous condition arising from the effort
of congress to repeal "a law of nature and deprive the coast cities?
of their natural geographical advantage. .The result' is endless c°n

EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE CALL
President Taft's Message Is, on the
Whole, a Somewhat Timid Document
IT IS not very clear why Wall street
should ''-feel aggrieved by the presi
\ dent's message or disappointed be
cause of its tenor. .Yet. we are told,
that stocks ' \u25a0 sold off ' 'several- points.
. To .be- sure, the message; contained the:
declaration^ that the law against trusts
would, be enforced as it' is written andy
interpreted' ;by the courts and this' an
nouncement r may have assumed V- some {
extrinsic emphasis' by reason of ;the\simul- :':'
tahepus' action taken by the administration 1
to break up 4he bathtub trust. .
If it is true that: large financial interests
are alarmed by a promise that the law will
be ehforcedthe chief significance of this
state of. mind might seem to be the, evidence
it affords of a giiilty conscience.
..Mr.. Taft is not extreme^in' his views of
this question and his policy .in • this rela
tion has been confined to the prosecution .
of those trusts which are -accused of em
ploying . fraudulent, or; oppressive methods.
It is intimated fur ther that the financial
interests are not pleased with the proposal
to make a physical- valuation of the rail
roads. The only objection in this regard
that: could occur to such;' interests is that =
an honest valuation of the roads might dis- :
close a considerable amount of fictitious
capitalization. If the capitalization is sub
stantially genuine aiid honest it is not clear
why objection should be raised. If, on the
other hand, the stock is * largely water, the
people who use the roads should not be
compelled to pay interest on a paper debt
representing nothing".
The message in part is a somewhat tin^d'
document. It does not recommend ( any
extensive program ' \u25a0\u25a0{. of legislation: -The
tariff is not touched except in the
way of exposition of results and a moderator
commendation of the plan 'to' submit ''the
schedules to the examination of a non
political commission. The most important
proposition advanced' by the president in
this regard is that" the several schedules ,
should be taken up by congress one at a.
fusion, ho little aggravated by the conflict of jurisdictions that may
or may not be guided as to their action by the same considerations
of law and equity. " '
' A TRl !^^ example of the policy ol grab in relation to the
/A exploitation of natural resources is found in the claim advanced
by H. V. Gates to-the most valuable water, power site on the
-.\u25a0\u25a0 Pit river in Shasta county. .Gates- located a
building stone claim at. the big bend, on- the
Pit. The land" office now decides that the
claim is fraudulent 'in the sense that the land
_ was not properly classified as chiefly useful
for the production; of building stone. The rear purpose of the loca
tion was, of course, for use as a power site, and to that end Gates
had appropriated 250,000 inches of water, rwhich he proposed to
carry through a tunnel in order to get the necessary fair for manu
facturing power. V
What Gates wanted to do has been done successfully .'• in = hun-;
dreds of cases in. California, and if he had tried it ten years ago
there is little doubt that his claim would have been allowed. That
is to say, he Would have acquired a property worth a vast sum of
money Jor a nominal price. He failed because the effect of the
conservation movement, has been to makefile land office look more
closejy into these claims. But further legislation on a compre
hensive plan for conservation is much needed to safeguard the
public interests.

The Morning Chit-Chat
THERE Is a little new mother across the street from'
us, who; because she seems to all of us such a young
and helpless mite to have charge of another even
younger and more helpless mite, is the constant recipient:
of wise advice and suggestions and "how I did its'* from
all the mothers in the neighborhood.
Most of this she receives willingly — no, avidly
Bnt the other day she rebelled.
This is how it happened.
The lady who is born with a mania for, regulating
everyone's affairs came in to see the baby.
. She admired him enthusiastically enough to suit even
the little mother, and then she started to regulate. Had
she done it in the direct, frank way of the other mothers
there would have been no trouble at all, but instead she
went about it this way.
Addressing the baby: "So he was a buflum, buflum Ittie baby,, but why
didn't he tell his mother that she had his Ittie garters too tight so they drew
his ittie legs right up?" -/: .. :
"Oh, did he yawn, was he real sleepy? Bless, his little' heart. He mist
tell his mother that he needs a longer nap in the morning than she: gives
him." ' ' • '.
When she took her • departure after a half hour's conversation thickly
jeweled with modest pearls of Insinuated wisdom like the above, the little
mother came back from seeing her to the door with tightly shut lips and a
flame of resentment on her cheeks.
"Tell the lady next time she' comes! here that your mother wouldn't do
a thing she said, just because she said it all in such a silly, silly war.'*
she admonished the T>aby solemnly, and then in answer to my laugh, **)h
yes, I suppose I will, because she knows such a lot; but don't vott Late
hints?" . '
.. To which qVestion,- though I should call the suggestions of the lady
who. has a mania for regulating other people's affairs rather.too broad-for
hints, I was able togive a; warm afflrmative. '
Do you know anything more exasperating, for instance, than to have
someone with whom you have been talking ten minutes on the telephone
begin to hint that she Is going out that, evening instead of telling you
frankly the moment you called up. that she had an engagement and wouLH
rather you called up the nexf night, which you would have been entirely'
willing to do? |SR
To unnecessary, frankness in the speaking of disagreeable things I am
a most militant foe. » - •
But- to frankness and directness In the matter -of necessary facts/' as
opposed to. hints, I am as vigorous a friend. : •\u25a0•-.?
Commend me. for a friend to that kind of person wiio. never says a^dis
agreeable or critical thing unless It will do some good, and when he thinks
it will, says it frankly and plainijr instead, of hinting.
