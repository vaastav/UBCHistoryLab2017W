FBIDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1884.
The president's message will be
found on our inside pages. As it is a
document that all would be benefitted
by reading, we will not tempt any one
to omit it by summarizing it. It will
be found a very unpretending, busi
ness like paper, containing a number
of valuable suggestions that Congress
would do well to heed, but that it
probably will not.
A mono the recommendations of
President Arthur, was one that a pen
sion ho slvpn to Gen. Grant. In ac
cordance with this recommendation.
the chairman of the committee on pen
sions during the first dajs of the ses
sion, introduced a bill allowing Gen.
Grant an annual pension of $5000. "We
are glad to see, by Tuesday's dallies,
that the bill has been withdrawn at
the General's own request, he having
written to the gentlemau who intro
duced it, that uuder no circumstances
could he accept a pension. This act
will very greatly raise Gen. Grant in
the opinion of the vast majority of his
countrymen. No one would begrudge
him the $5000 if he needed it, but in
spite of his losses last summer he is
still a rich man, and can ill afford to
appear before the country in the role of
a beggar.
By request of McCook Post No. 51,
G. A. B., and under their auspices,
The Daily Register will again
make its appearance during the holi
days. This little sheet obtained r
very flattering reception last winter
and with a large stock of experience
accumulated since then and much bet
ter mechanical facilities, we hope this
winter to make it even more worthy
of your kind consideration and pat
ronage. The first number will be is
sued on the 24th Inst., and seven num
bers will be issued in all. There will
bo 300 copies printed daily, making a
total edition of 2,100 copies. These
will be carefully and systematically
distributed, not only in Iola, but also
in Moran, Colony and Humboldt.
This Mill make it a most valuable ad
vertising medium, and as rates will be
reasonable, we hope that the Daily
will be well patronized.
J. C. HUBBAT TO THE FRONT.
Our old fellow townsman, J. C. Mur
ray, is not without (political) honor in
Missouri as he was here. He is a
member elect of the legislature of that
state and is prominently mentioned
for high places In that body. The
Platto county Argus, quoted with fa
vorable comments by the Nevada
Democrat nominates him for speaker
of the house in the following compli
mentary language:
"Anions: the most distinguished
democrats elected to the next house of
representatives is Judge J. C. Murray,
of Vernon county, a native of our town
and county, and brother of Mrs. B. P.
C. Wilson. A ripe scholar and a law
yer of flue ability, as well as an ardent,
active working democrat, he has long
been one of the pillars of the party in
the southwestHis name is being prom
inently mentioned in connection with
the speakership of the house, for which
he Is so admirably qualified. Judge
Murray will not meet his superior in
either branch of the general assem
bly." THE HUMBOLDT TRAGEDY.
A most unfortunate affray took place
in Humboldt last Monday night which
resulted in the killing of Frank "Vogt
and serious wounding of bis half broth
er, Herman Scheer. As has been gen
erally known there has been a warrant
in the hands of the sheriff for some
time for the arrest of John Brooks and
Herman Scheer, charged with violat
ing the prohibitory law. They have
eluded the officers until last Monday
when Sheriff Gordon received notice
that they were in Humboldt. Ac
companied by John Brown, he accord
ingly went to Humboldt, Monday
evening, arriving there after dark.
Upon the recommendation of Mr.
Amos they went to the house of Mr.
Ashcraft and asked him to go with
them and show them where these men
lived. Ashcraft demurred but finally
consented to go, They went first to
the house of Johu Brooks, and finding
him at home, John Brown arrested
him and took him to the Nickleplate
Hotel. Gordon and Ashcraft then
returned to the square and Gordon,
leaving Ashcraft m front of the old
Monroe house, told him to remain
there on the lookout, while he went to
the Fitzsimmons' place to look for
Scheer. What happened afterwards
is thus told by Scheer himself, before
the coroner's jury :
I was at Humboldt on the evening of
December 8th, when on affray took
place between myself, Frank Voght
and A. W. Ashcraft. I was in com-
fiany with Frank Voght and was go
ng south on 8lh street when Ashcraft
tapped me on the shoulder and said I
was under arrest. I said he could not
arrest me, be was no officer. He tapped
me on the shoulder. J think I hit him
twice in the face. I think he has two
blue spots in the face. Then he shot.
I had hold of him. He shot twice. 1
think the first two shots did not take
effect. The third shot I think he hit
Frank Voght. He fired five shots. I
had holdof his hand. He pulled away
from me and ran up the street Frank
did not hit him that I know of. I had
hold of his right hand with my right
hand. He did not say a word. Frank
did not do anything that I know of.
There were three along. Frank Voght
went on ahead and then came back.
He heard this fuss. Some one was
with Frank. One shot was fired be
fore Frank came hack. He came back
walking. At the time Ashcraft first
tapped me on the shoulder Frank
Voght was four or five steps ahead of
mo with the creamery man. The
creamery niai did not come back.
I had no revolver, pistol or knife.
Had nothing in my hand. It was very
dark, but I could see Ashcraft'a face
plain enough to know him. Don't
know whore he came from. He came
out of stairway, it may be, but I don't
know. He was facing east when fired
first Bhot. There was .a window bro
ken, I guess he fired through there.
I'm sure one shot went through there.
He nulled loose when he shot me. It
was the last or last but one shot that
hit me. I was shot In the rlehtshoul
der from in front. I had hold of him
when he shot me. Frank Voght was
not armed. Didn't see any arms except
what Ashcraft had. H said some
thing when I told him he was not an
ifRtAt. litif T Minnnf. foil TPlmf 1 f. Wflfl.
I think I grabbed him immediately. I
think ho nad tne revolver in nisnana.
I am positive he had the revolver In
his hand. He first Btepped to my
right side. I think the third Bhot took
effect fh Voeht. First or second shot
went through the window. I did not
see Frank fall. The affray took place
at southeast cornerofJNlcKoleu'B omce.
Voght was found only a step away
from me. It was southeast corner
where I was standing. Frank was
three or four steps uway. I did not
see him shoot at Frank, ho was trying
to shoot me. Can't say that Frank
did anything. Ashcraft was trying to
shoot me and I was trying to keep him
from it. After tapping me on the
shoulder he took hold of me and null
ed me out to one Bide. I grabbed the
right hand. It had a revolver in it.
Then he shot. I struck him in the
f.ice two or three times. It was after
the first shot I Btruck him. I did not
strike him before he shot. I struck
him with left hand. He patted my
shoulder with his left hand, at the
time I think I saw the revolver. In his
rieht hand. I did not know when
Frank came back.
Several other witnesses were exam
ined, eliciting no new facts. The jury
desiring to hear the testimony of Gor
don, who was outof the county search
ing for Ashcraft, an adjournment was
had until Thursday.
Immediately after the affray Ash
craft fled and was not heard of until
Wednesday when the sheriff of Green
wood county telegraphed that he had
placed himself in his custody. John
Brown went the same day to get him
In the absence of Ashcraft'a story,
and even of the verdict of a coroner's
jury, it would be folly to venture an
opinion as to the degree of
Ashcraft's guilt. The testimony
of Mr. Scheer, who is
tainly interested in throwing Ash
craft in as bad a light ub possible,
shows that the killing of Vogt was
accidental. But putting the worst
possible construction upon it, the con
duct of some of the citizens of Hum
boldt is reprehensible in the highest
degree. They seemed to go perfectly
wild, and if they could have found
Ashcraft that night, they would un
doubtedly have hung him. They
even threatened John Brown, believ
ing that he was concealing him. But
they look it back when Mr. Brown re
minded them that he had been in
Kansas too long to stand any foolish
ness. A mob of 30 or 40 went to
Geo. Amos' residence and insisted on
searching it. They were up here
twice that night to search the jail
Hearing that he was expected in from
Eureka Wednesday, fourteen of them
came up at noon to meet him and es
cort him to his preliminary trial at
Humboldt, remarking that after the
preliminary was over he would be no
expense to the county. Such, actions
and such talk cannot be condemned
too strongly. If A. W. Ashcraft is
guilty of willful murder, every good
citizen will insist that the extreme
penalty of the law be visited upon
him; but whether he is thus guilty or
not can only oe determined after a fair
trial, and this he must have. No one
can say whether ho .is guilty or not.
Let the law decide, not a mob.
ASHCRAFT'S 8TATEMENT :
Since the above was written, John
Brown has returned from Eureka,
where he found Ashcraft in the custo
dy of Sheriff DeFoe, with whom he
has left him, as Ashcraft did not think
it safe to come here. He says
that Ashcraft's statement is as
follows : 'I arrested Scheer and ho
was about to go along without much
trouble when Voght struck me aud
knocked mc against the window.
Scheer then fired one shot at me, when
Voght struck me, knocked imo down
and kicked me. As I got up I drew
niy revolver and shot Voght twice
and killed him. Scheer then clinched
me. I shot twice at him and jerked
loose, tearing my coat in doing so, and
ran."
