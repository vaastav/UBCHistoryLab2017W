1 lie active underground movement* of
secret societies in promoting the political
advancement of their members has been
one of ill e fruitful raises, if not the main
cause, of fiiiing our public stations with so
many men of inferior intellect and charac
'er. The trickster who succeeds in attain
ing any public position through grips and
lodge room manipulations, lihs a mind too
grovelling to rise above the apron strings
that encircle him when he is out in full re
galia. No man of sufficient brains and
character to discharge with credit to him

ties of any responsible public position woM
debase !.i:ne'f bv r.L-taimrg one through
prostituting the assembly rooms of benev

-j-oken of i-rt in proportion as the number
of members of some secret societv to which
he is attached occupy seats in the body,
flie number of nominations made by the
subtle influence of lodge room operations
an 1 outside grips and manipulations, is so
great as to be surprising to those who have
never had their attention called to the suh
jeef.
Our countrv lias been brought to the
brink of ruin hv allowing small and dis
hone.-l men, through unworthy means, to
crawl into places of high tru-t and re-pon
Ability. The r.ftces-ities of the country
are such now that it is no time in canvass
ing the claims of men for public positions
to put the paltry question, i Vies he belong
to some M asonic, (>d,l Fellows’, or Good
Templars’, or some other socie’y ? The
oidv question should be. Is he a patriot ?
Is he honest? is he the most capable and
uptight man that can be found to dis
charge the duties of the position for which
his name lias been presented ?
We have no time to pursue this suljec-t
further this week ; but may recur to it, and
perhaps be more specific in a future num

Mud Two Feet Deep.
A correspondent writing from Falmouth
(opposite Fredericksburg.) on the 21-1
ult., says :
A rain storm in Virginia is a far differ
ent affair in its effects fiom one tip north,
where, from the lighter character of the
soil, it soon disappears fiom the snrface.
But down here, where the earth is hard,
daved and impervious, the water of even
r, few hours’ storm seldom dries otF in less
than as many day?. Imagine the effect
then, of a storm of several days upon the
mad, with the difficulties of travel im reas
ed by the passage of every successive ve
hide. We are onlv in the beginning of
our troubles now, with the roads convert
ed into mud of putty consistency and
varying in depth from six inches to two
feet. The once dry and in soine places
almost parched surface of the earth is con
verted into a grand plateau of streams
and rivulets of dirty muddy water ; rills
have become brooks ; brooks have become
creek?, and creeks rivers, under the inun
dalion from tbe clouds.

ed to the EmUssadors of France at Lon
don and S'. Petersburg :
Paris, Oct. 3d.
Europe watches with painful interest the
struggle which has been raging more than
a year upon ike A continent
1 lie hostilities have provoked sacrifices
and efforts certain!y of a nature to inspire
the highest idea of the perseverance and
energy ul the two populations. But this
-pomade, whidi does so much honor to
their courage, is only given at the price
of numberless calamities and a prodigous
effusion of blood. To these lestiits cf civil
war, which from the vert lirst assumed
va-t proportions, there is still to be added,
the apprehension of servile war, which
would be the culminating point of so
many irreparable disasters. The suffering
of a nation toward which we Lave always
professed a sincere friendship, would have
sufficed to excite the sincere solicitude of
the Emperor, even had we ourselves not
suffered by the counterblow of thc-e events.
L nder the influence of intimate relations
which extensive intercourse has multiplied
between the various regions of the globe,
Europe itself has suffered from the conse
quences of the crisis which has dried up
otic *<f the most fruitful sources of public
wealth, and which has become, for the
great centres of labor, a cause of most sad
trials
As you are aware, when the conflict
commenced, we held it our duty to ob
serve the most strict neutrality, in concert
w;th other maritime powers, and the
W ashington Cabinet lias repeatedly ac
knowledged the honorable manner with
which w adhered to that line of conduct.
The sentiments dictated to us have under
gone no change but of a benevolent char
acter. 1 hat neutrality, instead of impos
ing upon the powers the attitude which
might resemble indifference, ought rather
to make them of set vice to the two parties
bv helping them out of a position which
fee ;.s to have no i-sue. From llie com
mencement of the war an armed force was
set on foot bv the beFigeren’s, which since
then has almost, constantly been kept up
After so much bloodshed, they are now,
in that respect, nearly in the same posi
tion —nothing aut Inn i/.ing the prcsnmp
lion that more deci.-ive military optimums
will shmily occur, according to the last
news received in Europe. The tw. ar
mies, on i he contrary, were in a condi' m
that woijM not allow eiihei party to hope.
within a btief delay, for anv decided tnl
vantage to turn ilie balance and accelerate
the com-'u-iun of a peace.
Ail these circumstances, taken logethet
point to the opportunity if an atmislice.
to which, moieover, under the present cir
cumstat,ces, no strategical objection can
he had. The favorab'e dispositions Io
wa: a- peace, which arc beginning to man
if’est themselves in the ninth, as well as in
the south, might, on the other hand, sec
ond steps that might bo made to recom
mend tiie idea of truce. The Emperor
has, therefore, thought that thu occasion
has presented itself of offering to the bel
ligerents the support of the good offices
of the maritime powers ; ami his Majesty
has charged me (o make the proposition
of this government to her Hritannic Maj
estv, as well as to the Court of Russia
The three Cabinets would exert their in
fluence at Washington, as weii as with
the Confederates, to obtain an armistice
for six months, doting which every act. of
war, direct or indirect, should provision
ally cease on sea as well as on land, and
it might bo, if necessary, ulteriorly pro
longed.
The overtures, 7 need not say, sir, wo’d
not imply, on our part, any judgment on
the origin or issue of I lie struggle, nor any
pressure upon the negotiations which
might it is to be hoped, ensue in favor of
an armistice. Our ta.-k would consist
s-ilcly in soothing down obstacles, and in
imerteiit.g only in a measure determined
upon bv the l vo parties.
We should not, in fact, believe ourselves
called upon to decide, nov to prepare the
solution of difficulties which hitherto have
opposed reconciliation between the beliig
erenl parties. Would not, moreover, an
agreement between the ihree courts re
spond sufficiently to their intentions ?
Would it not give to their step the char
acter of evident impartiality ? Acting in
concert, they would combine the condi
tions best suited to inspire confi lence—
the government of the Emperor, by the
constant tradition of French policy to
wards the United Slates —England, by the
community of race Russia, by the marks
off: ieiid-hip she has not ceased to show the
Washington Cabinet. Should the event
not justify the hope of the three powers,
and should the ardor of the struggle over
rule the wis lorn of their councils, this at
tempt would not, he the less honorable for
them. They would have fulfi ied a duty
of humanity, more especially indicated in
a war which has excited passion* which
render all effect attempts at negotiation
more difficult. It is the mission which
international law a--ig:is neutrals ; at the
same time it prescribes to them a strict
impartiality, and they could never make
a nobler use of their influence than by en
deavoring to pul an end to a struggle
which causes so much suffering and coin
i rom >*-- such great interests throughout
the whole world
F.naiiy, even without immediate results
*lifcse overtures would not be em.i r elv n*e
less. for lliev might encourage public opin
ion to views of concilia'ion. and thus con
tribute t > hasten the moment when the
return of peace might become possible.

DIiOUYN DE L’iIUYS.
KAItL hfSSKLt’s HEJ’LT.
Af’cr re. apbulaliog the propositions of
the French government, Pari Ressell re
plies in a letter dated Nov. 13, addressed
to Her Majesty’s Embassador at Paris, as
foFow* :
S'.irli in substance is *!•<? proposal of the
government of the Emperor of the French I
and I need hardly say that it lias attract- ;
eJ the serious attention ot Her Majesty's :
government. Her Majesty is desirous of
acting in concurrence with France upon
the great questions now agitating the world
and upon none more than the conungen
ties con netted with the great struggle now
fjoingon in North America. Neither Her
Majesty, the Queen, nor the British nation
will ever forget the nob’e and emphatic
manner in which the Emperor of the
French vindicated the laws of nations and
assisted the cause of peace in the instance
cf the seizure of the Confederate Conunh
sinners on hoard the Trent. Her Majesty’s
government recognize with pleasure lire
design of arresting the progress of the war
by friendly measures, the benevolent views
and humane intentions of the Emperor.—
They are also of the opinion that if the
steps proposed were to be taken the con
currenee of Russia would be extremely de
| sirable. Her Majesty’s government have,
however, not been informed up to the
present time that the Russian government
have agreed to co-operate with England
and France on this occasion, although
that government may support the endeav
ors of England and France to attain the
end proposed. But is the end propos
ed attainable at the present moment by
the course suggested by the government
of France ? Such is the question which
has bien anxiously and carefully examin
ed by her Majesty’s government. After
weighing all the information which has
been received from America, her Majesty’s
government are led to the conclusion that
there is no ground at the present moment
to hope that the federal government would
accept the proposal suggested, and a re
fusal from Washington at the present
time would prevent any speedv renewal
of the offer. Her Majesty’s government
think, therefore, that it would be better
to watch carefully the progress of opinion
in America, and if, as there appears rea
son to hope, it may be found to have
undergone, or may undergo hereafter, any
change, the three Courts might then avail
themselves of such change to offer their
friendly counsel with a greater prospect
than now exists of \iz being accepted by
the two contending parlies.
Her Majesty’s government will com
municate to tliat of France any intelli
genre they may receive from Washington
or Richmond bearing on this important
subject.
Your Excellency may read this dispatch
to M. Drotiyn and I’Huvs, and give him a
copy of it. (Signed) RUSSELL.
The Little Children.
The Milwaukee News thus speaks of the
hardships of the draft in Washington
county :
“ We are informed by an intelligent
gentleman of Washington county, that up
on a careful estimate, he concludes that
not less than (ivo thousand little children
are dependent upon the drafted men of
that, county Cor their daily care and sup
port. Nearly eight hundred men were
drawn. Nearly all of them are laboring
men, married and with large families. In
the town of Germantown the parents of
quite 400 children are drawn.
*• You, whose hearts are moved with
sympathy for the well fed negro of the
south—have you no feeling for she hard
ships endured in the huinU'e homes of
your own slate ? Is it best, is it Chris
tian, to catty on a war for anything else
than the restoration of the Union, at lids
expense ?
War at best is a fearful thing. It
takes life. It takes money. It destroys
trade. It cultivates the evil natures of
men. It always leaves desolation and sor
row in its crimson track. Uut civil war
carried on by conscripts—this is the worst
war of all. It is the aggregate of all pub
lie calamities. It robs the verv children
ot the cheer with which God blessed them,
and erects a grinning skeleton on the
hearth of every humble home.”
Painful Accident. —The Chilton
Times publishes the following painful oc
currence :
“John McHugh, of this town lost a
bright intelligent little girl,aged two j ears,
on I hursday last under the following pain
ful circumstances: The tea kettle was
boiling on the stove, and her little brother
aged live years, went and blew the steam
down the spout ; she tried to do the same
tiling, but unfortunately sucked the steam
down her throat. She lived in great ag
ony fur about twenty four hours, when she
expired.”
■ ——
The Draft. The drafted men in the
camp at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, it is
said, desert by hundreds. The Lancaster
Erprcti says of the eleven hundred men
who left that county for the camp only

Meeting of Congress—The President’s
Message.
Both houses of Congress met on Mon
day last, ai d ibe annual Message of Presi
dent Lincoln was delivered the same day.
Immediately on tl.o organization of the
House, Mr Vallandiguam, of Ohio, offer
ed lh following resolution, which was
adopted :
Resolved) That the committee on Judic
iary be instructed to inquire into and res
po r t to the House at an earlv day by what
authority of the Constitution or law?, if
anv, the Post Master General undertakes
to decide what newspapers mav and what
newspapers may not be transmitted tbro’
the mails.
Mr. Cox, of Ohio, offered the following :
Whereas , Many citizens of the United
States have been seized by persons acting,
or pretending to act, under the authority
of the United States, and have been car
ried out of the jurisdiction of the States of
their residence, and imprisoned in the mil
itary prisons and camps of the United
States, without any public charges being
preferred against them, and without any
opportunity being allowed them to iearn
or disprove the charges made, or alleged
to be made against them ; and.
Whereas. Such arrests have been made
in the States where there is no insurrec
lion, or rebellion, or pretence thereof, or
any other obstruction to the authority of
the Government; and.
Where as, It is the sacred right of every
citizen cf the United States, that he shall
not be deprived of his liberty without, due
process of law, and when arrested shall
have a speedy and public tiial by an im
partial jury : therefore.
Resolved, That the House of Represen
tatives does hereby condemn all such ar
rests and practices as unwarranted bv the
Constitution and laws of the United States,
as a usurping of power never given up by
the people to their rulers, and do hereby
demand that ai! such arrests shall bereaf
ter cease, and that all persons so arrested,
and yet held, shall have a prompt and
public trial according to the provisions of
the Constitution and laws of the United
States.
Mr. Riciiaudson, of Illinois, offered the
following resolution :
Resol cJ, 'i hat the President l>e request i
eil to inform the House of Representatives. :
what citizens of Illinois are now confined
in any forts or places of confinement, nmj
upon v. hat charges such ci'iz*-ns wgie ar
rested, ami Mint the President also inform
the House of Representative® the names of
the persons arresed in the State of li'inois
and confined in prisons outside the limits
of said State, what the charges are ag’st
them, by whom charges are made and by
whose order all such arrests were made.
It is needless to say that the resolutions
of Messrs. Cox and Richardson - were vot
ed down by the Mack Republicans, who
compose a large majority of the present
Congress. Thank God, their reign expires
on the 4:h of March, after which time we
hope to have all the rascalities and perse
cutions practised by the present Adminis
tralion looked into.
The following is a synopsis of the Presi
dent’s Message ;
lie says the cotrespondence touching
foreign affairs, which has taken place dur
ing the last year is herewith submitted in
compliance with a request to that effect.
If the condition of our relations with other
nations is le c s gratifying than formerly, it
is certainly more satisfactory than a na
tion so unhappily distracted might have
reasonably apptehended.
A blockade of 3 000 miles of sea coast
could not be established and righteously
enforce'! in a season of great commercial
activity like the present, without commit
ting occasional mistakes and inflicting un
intentional injuries upon foreign nations
and subject*.
In clear cases of tin’s kind I have, so far
as possible, heard and redressed complaints
by friendly powers, there is, however, a
large and augmenting number of doubtful
cases upon which the government is una
ble to agree with the governments whose
protection is demanded by the claimants.
There are moreover many cases in which
the United Slates, or their citizens, suffer
wrongs from the naval or military author
ities of foreign nations which the govern
ment of these slates are not at once pre
pared to redress.
I have proposed to some of the foreign
states interested, mutual conventions to
examine and adjust such complaints. This
has been made especially to Great Britain,
France. Spain, and Prussia. In each case
it has been kindly received but not yet fur
mally adopted.
Applications have been made to me hv
many free born Americans of African de
scent to favor their emigration with a view
to such colonization as was contemplated
in recent acts of Congress. Other parties
at home and abroad, some from interested
and other motives have suggested similar
measures, where on the other hand several
of the Spanish American republics have
protested against sending of such colonies
to their respective territories under these
cirett instances.
1 have declined to move any snch colo
nv to any state without first obtaining the
consent of its governmen’ with an agree
ment on their part to receive, and nrotecl
such emigrants in a!l their rights as free
men, and I have at ttie same lime offered
to the several states, situated in the tropics,
or having colonies there, to negotiate with
them subject to the advice an ! con-ent of
the Senate to favor voluntary emigration
of parties of that c!as to their respective
territories upon conditions which shall be
! equal, j't't and humane.
Our relations with the European States
remain undistui bed, and with the States (if
our continent, have improved, especially
Mexico, \’o-!a Rica, Arc.
I The va-t expenditures incident to the
| military arc! naval operations required for
1 the suppiession of the rebeli'on have liilh
erto been met with a promptitude cert on
ly unu-unl in similar circumstances, and
the public credit has been fully maintained.
The continuance of the war, however,
and the increased disbursements rendered
necessary demand your best reflections as
to the best modes of providing the necessa
ry revenue.
The suspension of iperua pavmcnt hr
the banks nifide largo Psoas of Treasury
notes unavoidable. In no other wav <;oM
the payment of the troops and the satis
factiqo of other just demand?}-Wo eco
nomically or a? weli provided for. It is
extremely doubtful whether a circulation
of treasury notes payable in coir, and suf
ficiently large for the wants of .the people
can be permanently, usefully and sandy
maintained. Is there any other mode in
which the necessary provision for the pub
lic wants can be made, an I the gvtai n<.-
vantages of a sale and uniform c4nency
secured?
These rates prepared under the .super
vision of proper officers, being unifonurin
appearance and security and convertible
always into coin, would at once protect
labor against the evils of a vicious curreu
; cv, and facilitate commerce by cheap safe
| exchanges. A moderate reservation from
i the interest on (he Bonds would compen
j sate the U. S for the preparation and dis
! tribution of the notes and a general super
! vision of the system and would lighten the
i burden of that part of the public debt era
j ployed as security. The public credit
1 moreover would be greatly improved and
: the negotiation of new loans greativ facili
tated bv the steady market demand for
Government Bonds which the adoption of
the proposed system would create.
It is an additional recommendation of
the measure, of considerable weight in my
! judgment, that it would reconcile as far as
possible all existing interests by the op
\ portunity offered to existing institutions
ito reorganize under the act; substituting
1 only the secured uniform national circu
lation for the local and various circulation
now issued.
The President then gives a summary
from the Secretary of Treasury’s report;
refers to reports of Secretary’s of Navy
and War ; savs though lengthy, are only
brief abstracts ; says there i® decided im
provement in a financial condition of Post
Ollice Oep’t compared with preceding
years. The Secretary of Interior reports
public lands ceased to he a source of rev
enue. Speaking of Indian affairs and re
cent troubles savs, I submit for your spe
cial consideration whether our Indian sys
tem shall not he remodelled ; suggests tho
earliest completion of the Pacific Rail
road ; also favorable action of Congress
on projects for enlarging the great canals
of N-w York. Illinois end Michigan.
The President refers to ids compensated
emancipation proclamation of Sept. 22d,
and savs tliat portion of the earth occu
pied by 11 10 people of the Linked Slates is
w ell adapted to be the home of one nation
al family hut not. for two or more.
in the inaugural address I briefly
pointed out the total iuad< quacy of disun
ion as a remedy for differences between
the people of the two spmions.
I did so in language which I cannot im
prove. Physically speaking wo cannot
separate, we cannot remove our respective
sections from each other, nor build an im
passable wall between them lie then re
marks at length of the difficulty of ma
king any national boundary line.
The Pre-ident then suggests amend
ments to ‘.he constitution, Congress con
! curing to be proposed to the legislature*
I or conventions of the several States,which
i if ratified l>y three four hi of said legisla
tures to he valid as parts of said censtilii*
lion, d’he last article proposes all States
abolishing sla\er_\ before January Ist 1 000
shall receive compensation fiom the Uni
ted Males. Second, ail .-laves freed 1 V
the chances of war, at any time before tho
I end of tho rebellion, shall be forever free,
but ail owneis who had not been disloyal
shall he compensated. Third, Congress
may appropriate money, and otherwise
provide for colonizing bee colored persons,
wish their consent, at any place within the
j Uidled Sta’es.
Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would
! bring restoration arid thereby star both,
| and notwithstanding lids plan, the rocom
[ mendation that Congress provide hy law
for compensating any stale which may
adopt the emancipation before tins plan
-hall have been acted upon, is hereby ear
nestly renewed. This plan i® recommend
! ed as a mean’s not in conclusion of, but
; additional to all others, for restoring and
| preserving the national authority turoug’d
; out ihe nation.
The subject is presented exclusively in
| its economical aspect. The plan is promts
| ed as a permanent, and constitutional iaw.
jin conclusion the President savs. Dog
j mas of the quiet past are inadequate to
I the stormy present, the occasion is piled
j high with difficulty, and we must riso
I with the occasion.
Death of Luther Hanchett.
We learn from a letter received last
night that Hon Luther Hanchett, mem
ber of Congress elect from the Sixth Dis
trict of this Stale is dea l. Ho died at
his residence in Plover. Portage county,
on Monday last, at half oast two in the
afternoon. In the forenoon of that day
he was attacked hy apoplexy and expired
a few hours after.
The people of Wisconsin w ill learn the
fart with sorrow. Mr. Hanchett was a
man of many noble and genial qualities.
He had a clear head, am| warm and gen
erous heart. His public career ha? been
short. He was elected to the State Senate
in IboG, and served in that body four
years. In I£GO. lie was elected to Con
gress. and re-elected en the first 1 aesday
of the present month. Though recogniz
ed as a member of the rep inlican party,
his views and votes, both at Madison and
at Washington were pre-eminently cons
servafive, distinguishing him from nearly
a'l other prominent republicans of the
sta'e So clearly defined was his position
in this respect, that he. was doubtless in
debted for his majority at the hate elec
tion to democratic votes. He was a na*>
tive of Ohio, and hut ,°7 tears of ago.
The death of Mr.-Hanchett makes a va
cancy in the representation from this stale
both for the re-sion < otmn-m ing on Mon
day next, and for the Congress which
comes in on the 4'h of next March. A.
| special election to fill both these vacancies
will probably bo called by the Governor
to be held at an early day. — MUwauktt
