The Sunday law was enforced at New
York, Sunday, with a strictness that sur
prised the residents. Street venders of
all commodities, newspapers included,
were arrested, and in Brooklyn the drug

hotels were kept busy, as outsiders who
wished to be shaved, claimed to be guests

express drivers, if found violating the
law, were taken in. Projectors of sacred
concerts fared in a similar way.
General Raum, Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue, has submitted his report
4othe Secretary of the Treasury. He
hows that taxation by internal revenue
has increased from $113,000,000 in 1879
to $146,500,000 in 1881, and estimates
the receipts for the year at $145,000,000
He believes the revenue should be re
duced from $60,000,000 to $70,000,000 an
nually, and that if they are continued
at the present rate the Treasury would
contain a surplus in short time which
would necessitate the purchase of bonds
the demand for which by the government
would enhance their value at the cost
of the people. He thinks the duty on
sugar, now amounting to $45,000,000
yearly, should be abolished, and that
home producers, as an offset to the loss
of protection, be given a bounty of 2
cents on each pound manufactured. The
Commissioner estimates the stock of dis
tilled spirits in bond as about equal to
six years consumption, and thinks an
extension of the bonded period is a press
ing want of the trade. As the manu
facturers, to avoid withdrawal of their
Sroperty, and consequent payment of
axes, are thinking of exporting their
whisky, and then reimporting it and
storing it in customs bonded warehouses,
General Raum is of the opinion that leg
islative relief could be afforded with
safety, without putting the manufactur
ers to this outlay.

THE MODEL NEWSPAPER.
The Inter-Ocean for 1883.
To give all the news without indulging in of
fensive Rensationalism; to be courageous and
aggressive in the advocacy of well-established
principle, without being narrow-minded or un
fair, to cater to the tastes of all classes of in
telligent readers, without pandering to the
prejudices of any; to present in most attractive
form the greatest variety of matter, without cur
tailing or lowering the standard of any depart
ment; to grow in interest aud excellence with
each succeeding year of its existence, is to be
the model newspaper.
From the first it has been the aim of the pub
lishers of The Inter Ocean to have the paper
reach this high standard, and in each of t he
ten years of its existence a notable step for
ward has h.-en taken. As every change has
met with encouraging response from the pub
lic in the shape of increased patronage, it is fair
to assume that the efforts of the publishers have
been in the right direction, aud have been ap
preciated. The Inter Ocean will remain uncompromis
ingly Rhpublican, will maintain its present at
titude of protecting American industries; will
continue to devote special attention to trade,
transportation, and economic questions; will
retain the departments of the Curiosity Shop (a
current encyclopedia of curious, interesting and
valuable information, called out by inquiries
of subscriber) ; The Woman's Kingdom (de
voted to the progressive movements In wldch
women are interested ) ; The Farm and Home
(covering topics of special interest to farmers,
tiieil wives and their children): The Veterinary
(containing answers to questions as to the
treatment of horses, cattle, and other animals
by one of the best veterinary surgeons in the
West); and Complications (taking in puzzles,
enigmas, conundrums, etc. ) all of wldch are
peculiar to the paper; will give as much space
as hitherto to serial and short stories, original
and selected sketches, and poems, and with in
creased facilities for news gathering in the
shape of special wires to New York and Wash
ington, and experienced correspondents well
placed at home and abroad, will more than
maintain its high standard for enterprise and
accuracy in all departments of news.
The Inter Ocean, always closely identified
with the interests of the West, has led in the
work of development of both the Nortwest and
Southwest, and it will;continue to make promi
nent the characteristic features of the progress
of the newer communities toward statehood.
No paper in the country has given so much at
tention to immigration movements, railway and
canal enterprises, race and economic problems,
and other topics relating to the prosperity of
the older states and the development of the
newer sections as The Inter Ocean.
The aim has been to make it the best paper
for citJjfciliiirhan. or country reader; the best
papeiVtho business man and his family; the
best fr the strong partisan as well as the
generafTeader; and as the circulation of the sev
eral editions has Increased more rapidly the
past year than in any previous year, and as it is
now larger than that of any other paper west of
New York City, the publishers, feeling that
they have fair measure of popular approval,
will continue In the course marked out, making
such improvements as will keep The Inter
Ocean at the head of the list of American
tournals as the model newspaper.
The circulation is host shown by the amount
of postage paid on the papers sent to actual
subscribers. Judged by this standard, The Inter
Ocean Is far ahead of all of its Chicago contem
poraries, as is shown by the table below. This
table gives the amount of postage paid on circu
lation ly each newspaper named ( ail of 'hicago)
