Near the close of the month of October last
occurrences of a deeply regretable nature were
brought to my knowledge, which maae it
my painful bat imperative duty to obtain,
with as littre delay as possible, a new per

this incident will in due course be laid before

After considering several topics of minor
importance, the Chinese question is
treated as follows: In a message accompa

gotiation of the treaty with China, concluded
at this capital on the twelfth day of March,
18S8, and which, having been confirmed by
the Senate with certain amendments, was re
jected by the Chinese government. This
message contained a recommendation that a
sum of money be appropriated as compensa-
tion to uninese snojecuj wuu u

consideration for the Indians. A number of
these prisoners have forfeited their lives to
outraged law and humanity. Experience has
proved that they are dangerous and cannot
be trusted. This is true not only of those
who on the warpath have heretofore actually
been guilty of atrocious murder, but of their
kindred and friends, who while they remain
ed upon their reservation laniiouou u
comfort to those absent with bloody intent,

kept in restaint far from the locality of their
former reservation. They should be subject
ed to efforts calculated to lead to their im

and eruel instincts; but their return to their
old home should be persistently resisted.
" THE OTHER INDIANS.
The condition of our Indian population
continues to improve, and the proofs mul
tiply that the transforming change so ranch
to be desired, which shall substitute for bar
barism enligntenmens niiu uuii.mis
tion, is in favorable progress. Our relations
with these people during the year has been
disturbed by no serious disorders, but rather
marked bv a better realization of their true
interests and increasing confidence and good
will. These conditions testify to the value
of the higher tone of consideration and hu
manity which has governed the later methods
of dealing with them, and commend its con
tinued observance. Allotments in severalty
have been made on some reservations nntii
all those entitled to land thereon have had
their share assigned, and the work is sttil
continued in directing the execution of this
duty. I have made as much rapid dispatch
so as to secure just and fair arrangements
which shall best conduce to theobjeots of the
law by producing ratification with the re
sult of the allotments made. No measure of
general effect has ever been entered on from
which more may be fairly hoped if it shall be
discreetly aaminisiereu. i u"- p -tunity
and inducement to that independence
of spirit and life which the Indian peculiarly
needs, while at the same time the inalienabil
ity of title affords security against the risks
his inexperience of affairs or weakness of
character may expose him to in dealing with
others. Whenever begun upon any reserva
tion, it shonld be made complete, so that all
are brought to the same condition, and, as
soon as possible. Community in lands shonld
cease by opening such as remain unallotted to
settlement.

Many improvements are soon to be made
on the Shore line road. An important
feature will be the building of a $100,000
iron bridge at Lyme. This will be finished
early in 1889. The increasing travel will
necessitate a second track before -very long.
When trranite was needed for filling and
bnildins works, blasting began in a ledge
where the second traok would be laid. The
road is now double tracked as far east as
the bridge over Quinnipiao river in Fair

impedes travel greatly. Sometimes, in the
case of a heavy express train, it is twenty
minutes after the train arrives from the west
before it is loaded on the boat to be trans

In the death of Mrs. Nancy Blakeelee, at
the ripe old Sge of seventy-five yeais, anoth
er link is severed in the chain which binds
the present to the past as connected with the
history of the College street church.
Among the familiar names of those who
were specially active in the formation ana
fostering of the church, but who have now
entered into the rest of "the cbnroh tri

still bearing the burden and heat of the day.
The deceased was born in Watertown,
April 22, 1813, and married Isaiah. A. Blakee

Rntnnvinff to New Haven Mr. Blakeelee,
at the organization of the then Church street
church, joined his fortunes with it and be
came one of its most zealous members.
When at length it was decided to change
and build the College street chnroh, his
money and time were cheerfully given till
his instant death, caused by a fall while in
specting the buildine, June 14, 1848.
Mrs. Blakeelee was thus left with a family
of four ohildren,but her energy.indnstry and
economy enabled her so to care for and train

USE OF THX SBBPLUS.
The reqairements of the sinking fond aot

law as positively required, and bonds sufli

oreminm, it wss not deemed prndent to far
ther expend the surplus in such purchases
until the authority to do so shonld be more
explicit. A resolution, however, having been
Dassed by both houses of Congress, removing
ail aouoi as ui vj ' v,' Wi j
ohases of bonds were commenced on the 3di
day of April, 1888, and have continued until
the present time. By this plan bonds of the
Kovernment not yet due have been purchased

ber. 1888. ambunting to $94,700,400, the .pre
mium paid thereon amountins; to ,17,007,
$13 80 The premium added to the principal
of these bonds represents an in vestment yield
ing about 3 per cent, interest for the time
they still had to run, and the savinr to the
oovernment represented by the difference
between the amount of interest at 2 per
cent, upon the amount paid for principal
and premium, and what it would have paid
for interest speoiBed in the tends if these
bsd ran to their maturity is about $ 27,165.
000 At first sight this would seem to be a
nrontable and sensible transaction on the
. s. A a an rr YiJit Art hf
ihe Secretary of the Treasury, the surplus
thus expended for the purchase of bonds was
money drawn from the people in excess of
any actual need of the government and was
so expended rather than allow it to remain
Idle in the treasury. If this surplus under
the operation of just and equitable laws
had been left in the hands of the people it
would hsvs been worth la their business at
i.t .i, run- oent. ner annum. Deducting
from the amount of interest upon the prin
cipal and . premium of these bonds for the
time they had to ran at the rate of six per
cent the saving of two per cent, made for
the people by the purchase of such bonds,
the oss will , appear to be $55,760,000.
This collection would seem to demonstrate
I that if excessive and unnecessary taxation is

at the premiums which it willbe necessary to
pay .the loss to the people will bs hundreds of
niUUons of dollars. Since the purohase of
bonds was ondertaken asamentioned. nearly
all that have been ottered were anna i''
ti i- vu i aria nnltA annarent that
the government was in danger of being sub
jected to contentions to raise their price, as
appears by the instance cited by the Sesreta
rjr of the offering of bonds of the par value
of only $326,000 so often that the aggregate of
the sums demanded for their purohase was
mors than $19,700,000.

: -Notwithstanding the large sums paid out
in tha nnrchass of bonds, the surplus in the
treasury on the 30th day of November, 1888,
was $53,234,610.01, after deducting about
$30 000,000 just drawn out for the payment
of pensions. At the close of the fiscal year
enoed June 30, 1887, there had been coined
under the compulsory silver act266,988,280
?n .Uver dollars, $55,504,310 of .which were
in the hands of the people. On the 30th day
of Jnne, 1888, there had been coined $299,

government. On tne Idtn aay oi u'"'i
1888, $312,570,890 had been coined; $60,
970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in

to make the most of it, and when that shall
be done the curse will be lifted, the Indian

redeemed. Tha time of its accomplishment
depends upon the spirit and justice with
which it shall be prosecuted. It can not be

and good name of the nation. The average
attendance of Indian pupils, in the schools
increased by over ?00 during the year, and
the total enrollment reacneu

is now estimated at 40,000, or nearly three
times the enrollment of the schools. It is

GRANTING OF PENSIONS.
After detailing the expenditures of the past
year for pensions, the President continues:
I am thoroughly convinced that our general
pension laws snouia u" r"v uu aujuirau

experience, all meritorious eases. The faoj
