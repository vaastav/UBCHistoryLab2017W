Amerlca-Its Importance to'the nation la
by no means limited merely to Its mate
rial effects upon our business prosperity,
and yet with a view to these effects alone it
would be to the last degree Important for
u« Immediately to begin It. While Its ben
eficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, It would
also greatly benefit other sections. It Is
emphatically a work which it is for the
Interest of the entire country to begin and
complete as soon as possible It Is one of
those great works which only a great na
tion can undertake with prospects of suc
cess and which when done are not only
permanent assets in the nation's material
Interests, but standing monuments to its
constructive ability.
1 am glad to be able to announce to you
that our negotiations on this subject with
Great Britain, conducted on both sides in
a spirit of friendliness and mutual good
will and respect, have resulted In my
being able to lay before tho senate a
treaty which If ratified will enable us to
begin preparations for an Isthmian canal
at any time and which guarantees to this
nation every right that it bns ever asked
In connection with the canal. In this
treaty the old Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so
long recognized as Inadequate to supply
the base for the construction and mainte
nance of a necessarily American ship cti
»ial, Is abrogated. It specifically provides
that the United States alone shall do the
Vork of building and assume the respon
sibility of safeguarding the canal and
shall regulate its neutral use by all na
tions on terms of equality without the
guarantee or Interference of any outside
nation from any: quarter. The signed
treaty will at once be laid before the sen
ate, and If approved the congress can then
proceed to give effect to the advantages It
secures us by providing for the building of
the canal.
The true end of every great and free
people should be self respecting peace,
and this nation most earnestly desires
sincere and cordial friendship with all
others. Over the entire world of recent
years wars between the great civilized
powers have become less and less fre
quent. "Wars with barbarous or semibar
barous peoples come in an entirely differ
ent category, being merely a most regret
table but necessary International police
duty which must be performed for the
•ake of the welfare of mankind. Peace
can only be kept with certainty where
both sides wish to keep it. but more and
more the civilized peoples are realizing
the wicked folly of war nnd are attaining
that condition of Just and intelligent re
gard for the rights of others which will in
tho end, as we hope and believe, make
worldwide peace possible. The pence con
ference at The Hague gave definite ex
pression to this hope and belief and mark
ed astride toward their attainment.
The Monroe Doetrinc.
This same peace conference acquiesced
In our statement of tho Monroe doctrine
as compatible with tho purposes and aims
of the conference.
The Monroe doctrine should be the car
dinal feature of the foreign policy of all
the nations of the two Americas as it is of
the United States. Just seventy-eight
years have passed since President Mon
roe in his annual message announced that
"tho American continents are henceforth
not to be considered as subjects for future
colonization by any European power." In
other words, the Monroe doctrine is a dec
laration that there must be no territorial
aggrandizement by any non-American
power at the expense of any American
power on American soil. It is in nowise
Intended as hostile to any nation In thf
old world. Still less is it Intended to glvo
oover to any aggression by one new world
power at the expense of any other. It is
simply a step, and a long step, toward as
suring the universal peace of the world by
securing the possibility of permanent
peace on this hemisphere.
During the past century other influences
have established the permanence and in
dependence of tho smaller states of Eu
rope. Through the Monroe doctrine wo
hope to be able to safeguard like inde
pendence and secure like permanence for
the lesser among the new world nations.
This doctrine has nothing to do with the
commercial relations of any American
power save that it in truth allows each of
them to form such as it desires. In other
words. It is really a guarantee of the com
mercial Independence of the Americas.
We do not ask under this doctrine for any
excluslva commercial dealings with any
other American state. We do not guaran
tee any state against punishment if it
misconducts Itself provided that punish
ment does not take the form of the acqui
sition of territory by any non-American
power.
Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guar
antee of our own good faith. We have
Bot the slightest desire to secure any ler
fltory at the expense of any of our neigh
bors. We wish to work with them hand
In hand, so that all of us may be uplifted
together, and we rejoice over the gool
fortune of any of them, we gladly hail
their material prosperity and political sta
bility and are concerned and alarmed if
any of them fall Into industrial or political
chaos. We do not wish to see any old
world military power grow up on this
continent or to be compelled to become a
military power ourselves. The peoples of
the Americas can prosper best if left to
work out their own salvation In their own
way.
Tlie Navy.
Tho work of upbuilding the navy must
be steadily continued. No one point of
our policy, foreign or domestic. Is more
Important than this to the honor and ma
terial welfare and, above all. to the peace
of our nation in the future. Whether we
desire It or not we must henceforth recog
nize that we have international duties no
less than international rights. Even i!
our flag wer» hauled down in the Philip
Pines and Porto Rico, even if we decided
not to build the Isthmian canal, we should
need a thoroughly trained navy of ade
quate size or else be prepared deflnltel
and for all t'me to abandon the idea that
our nation is among thoBe whose sons go
down to the sea In ships. Unless our com
merce Is always to be carried in foreign
bottoms we must have war craft to pro
tect It.
Inasmuch, however, as the American
people have no thought of abandoning the
path upon which they have entered, and
especially in view of the fact that the
building of the isthmian canal Is fast
becoming one of the matters which the
whole people are united in demanding, it
Is imperative that our navy should be put
and kept in the highest state of efficiency
and should be made to answer to ou
growlng needs. So far from being in any
way a provocation to war, an adequate
ahd highly trained navy is the best
guarantee against war. the cheapest and
most effective peace insurance. The cost
of building and maintaining such a navy
represents the very lightest premium for
Insuring peace which this nation can pos
sibly pay.
Probably no other great nation In the
world V* so anxious for peace as wo are.
There Is not a single civilized power
which has anything whatever to fear
from aggressiveness on our part. All we
want is peace, and. toward this end we
wish to be able to secure-the same re
fipect for our rights fnm others, which
we are t-ag^r and ar'xi to extend to
their rlr-rhts In return Insure fair treat
ment to us romrnerfi.'ill .' r-nd to primrun
tee the sutety of the American pe .ple.
O.nr people intend'to abide by the Mf,n- 1
roe doctrine aiul to insist upon it as the
one sure means of securing the peace of
lle western hemisphere. The navy otters I
us the only means of making our insist
ence upon the Monroe doctrine anything
but a subject of derision to whatever na
tion chooses to disregard It. We desire
the peace which conies as of right to the
Just man armc^ not the peace granted on
terms of ignominy to the craven and the
.weakling.

It is not possible to Improvise a navy
after war breaks out. The ships must
be built and the men trained long In ad
vance. Some auxiliary vessels can be
turned Into makeshifts which will do in
default of any better for the minor work,
and a proportion of raw men can be
mixed with the highly trained, their
shortcomings being made good by the
skill of their fellows, but the efficient
fighting force of the navy when pitted
against an equal opponent will bo found
almost exclusively in the warships that
have been regularly built and in the offi
cers and men who through years of faith
ful performance of sea duty have been
trained to handle their formidable but
complex and delicate weapons with the
highest efficiency. In the late war with
Spain the ships that dealt the decisive
blows at Manila and Santiago had been
launched from two to fourteen years, and
they were able to do as they did because
the men in the conning towers, the gun
turrets and the engine rooms had through
long years of practice at sea learned how
to do their duty.
Our present navy was begun in 1882. At
that period our navy consisted of a collec
tion of antiquated wooden ships already
almost as out of place against modern
war vessels as the galleys of Aleibiadra
and Hamilcar, certainly as the ships of
Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time did
we have men fit to handle a modern man
of-war. Under the wise legislation of the
congrcss and the successful administra
tion of a succession of patriotic secreta
ries of the navy belonging to both politi
cal parties the work' of upbuilding the
navy went on, and ships equal to any in
tho world of their kind were continually
added, and, what was even more impor
tant, these ships were exercised at sea
singly and in squadrons until the men
aboard them were able to get the best
possible scrvlco out of thorn. The result
was seen in the short war with Spain,
which was decided with such rapidity be
cause of the infinitely greater prepared
ness of our navy than of the Spanish
navy.
The Part Played l»y Congress,
While awarding the fullest honor to the
men who actually commanded and man
ned the ships which destroyed the Span
ish sea forces in 'the Philippines and iri
Cuba, we must not forget than an equal
meed of praise belongs to those without
whom neither blow could have been
struck. The congressmen who voted for
years In advance the money to lay dot*n
the ships, tn build the guns, to buy
armor plate, the department officials and
the business men and tvageworkers who
furnished what the congress had author
ized, tho secretaries of tho navy who
osked for and expended the appropria
tions and finally the officers who in fair
weather and foul on actual sea service
trained and disciplined tho crews of the
ships when there was no war in sight—all
are entitled to a full share in tho glory of
Manila and Santiago and the respect ac
corded by every true American to those
who wrought such signal triumph for our
country. It was forethought and prepara
tion which secured us the overwhelming
triumph of 1S9S. If we fail to show fore
thought and preparation now. there may
come a time when disaster will befall us
Instead of triumph and should this time
come the fault will rest primarily nnt
upon those whom the accident of events
puts in supreme command at the moment,
but upon those who have failed to prepare
in advance.
There should be no cessation In the
work of completing our navy. So far in
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It Is unsafe and unwise not
to provide this year for several additional
battleships nnd heavy armored cruisers,
with auxiliary and lighter craft in pro
portion. For the exact numbers and char
acter I refer you to the report of the secre
tary of the navy. But there is something
we need even more than additional ships,
and this Is additional officers and men. To
provide battleships and cruisers and then
lay them up. with the expectation of leav
iug them unmanned until they are needed
it actual war, would be worse than folly.
1& would be a crime against the nation.
More Men Required.
To send any warship against a compe
tent enemy unless those aboard it have
been trained by years of actual sea serv
ice. including Incessant gunnery practice,
would be to invite not merely disaster,
but the bitterest shame and humiliation.
Four thousand additional seamen and a
thousand additional marines should be
provided, arid an increase in the officers
should bo provided by making a large ad
dition to the classes at Annapolis. There
is one small matter which should be men
tioned in connection with Annapolis. T1 a
pretentious and unmeaning title of "naval
cadet" should be abolished the title of
"midshipman."- full of historic associa
tion. should he restored.
Even in time of peace a warship should
be used until It wears out, for only so can
it be kept fit to respond to any emergen
cy. The officers and men alike should be
kept as much as possible on blue water,
for It is tliers only they can learn their
duties aa they should be learned. The big
vessels should be maneuvered In squad
rons containing not merely battleships,
but the necessary proportion of cruisers
and scouts. The torpedo boats should
handled by the younger officers in such
manner as will best fit the latter lo take
responsibility and meet the emergencies
of actual warfare.
Every detail ashore which can be per
formed by a civilian should be so per
formed. the officer being kept for his spe
cial duty in the sea service. Above all,
gunnery practice should be unceasing. It
is important to have our navy of ade
quate size, but it J* even more impor
tant that, ship for ship. It should equal
In efficiency any navy in the world.
This Is possible only with highly drilled
crews and officers, and this In turn Im
peratively demands continuous and pro
gressive Instruction in target practice,
ship handling, squadron tactics and gen
eral discipline. Our ships must be assem
bled In squadrons actively cruising away
from harbors and never long at anchor
The resulting wear upon engines and
hulls must he endured. A battleship worn
out in long training of officers and men Is
well paid for by the results, while, on the
other hand, .10 matter in how excellent
condition it Is useless if the crew be not
expert.
The Necessity of Drill.
Wo now have seventeen battleships ap
propriated for, of which nine are complet
ed and have been commissioned for actual
service. The remaining eight will be ready
in from two to four years, but it will
take at least that time to recruit and
train the men to fight them, it Is of vast
concern that we have trained crews ready
for the vessels by the time they are com
missioned. Good ships and good guns are
simply good weapons, and the best weap
ons are useless save in the hands of men
who know how to fight with them. The
men must be trained and drilled under a
thorough and well planned system of pro
gressive instruction, while the recruiting
must bo carried on with still greater vig
or. Every effort must be made to exalt
tho main function of the offlcer-the com
mand of men. The leading graduates of
tho Naval academy should be assigned to
the combatant branches the line and ma
rines
M"ny of the essoi.tlnl* of success are al
ready r^nogniscd by thr' gi-noral hoard,
which, as the central-office of a growing
staff, is moving'steadily toward a proper
war efficient and a proper efficiency of
tho whole navy under the secretary. This
general board, by fostering the creation of
a general staff. Is providing for the offi
cial and tht^n the general recognition of
our altered conditions as a nation and of
the true m?aning of a great war fleet,
which meaning la. first, t\\e best men, and.
second, the best slima

But, In addition, we should at once pro
vide for a national naval reserve organ
ized and trained under the direction of
the navy department and subject to the
call of tho chief executive whenever war
becomes Imminent. It should be a real
auxiliary to the naval seagoing pcace es
tablishment and offer material to be
drawn on at once for manning our ships
in time of war. It should be composed of
graduates of the Naval academy, gradu
ates of the naval militia, officers and
crews of coast line steamers, longshore
schooners, fishing* vessels and steam
yachts, together with the coast popula
tion about such centers as life savinc
stations and lighthouses.
The American people must either build
and maintain an adequate navy or elce
make up their minds definitely to accept
a secondary position in international af
fairs. not merely in political but in com
mercial matters. It has been well said
that there is no surer way of courting na
tional disaster than to be "opulent ag
gressive and unarmed."
The Army,
It Is not necessary to increase our army
beyond its present size at this time but
it Is necessary to keep it at the highest
point of efficiency. The individual units
who as officers and enlisted men compose
this army are, we have good reason to be
lieve, at least as efficient as those of any
other army in the entire world. It Is our
duty to see that their training is of a kind
to insure the highest possible expression
of power to these units when acting in
combination.
The conditions of modern war are such
as to make an infinitely heavier demand
than ever before upon the individual char
acter and capacity of the officer and the
enlisted man and to make it far more dif
ficult for men to act together with ef.'ect.
At present the fighting must be done in
extended order, which means that each
man must act for himself and at the same
time act in combination with others with
whom he is no longer In the old fashioned
elbow to elbow touch. Under such condi
tions a few men of the highest excellence
are worth more than many men without
the special skill which Is only found as
the result of special training applied to
men of exceptional physique and morale,
but nowadays the most valuable fighting
man and tl.e most difficult lo perfect is
the rifleman who is also a skillful and
daring rider
The proportion of our cavalry regiments
has wisely been increased. The American
cavalryman, trained to maneuver and
fight with equal facility on foot and on
horseback, is the best type of soldier for
general purposes now to be found in the
world. The ideal cavalryman of the pres
ent day is a man who can fight on foot
as effectively as tho best infantryman and
who Is in addition unsurpassed in the
care and management of his horse and in
his ability to fight 011 horseback.
Woolil Create a General Staff.
A general staff should be created. As
for tho present staff and supply depart
ments, they should be filled by details
from the line, tho men so detailed return
ing after awhile to their line duties. It is
very undesirable to have the senior grades
of the army composed of men who have
come to fill the positions by the mere fact
of seniority. A system should be adopted
by which there shall be an elimination
grade by grado of those who seem unfit
to render the best service in the next
grado. Justice to the veterans of tho
civil war who are still in the army would
seem to require that in the matter of re
tirements they be given by law tho same
privileges accorded to their comrades in
the navy.
The process of elimination of the least
fit should be conducted in a manner that
would render it practically impossible to
apply political or social pressure on be
half of any candidate, so that each man
may be judged purely on his own merits.
Pressure for the promotion of civil offi
cials for political reasons is bad enough,
but It is tenfold worse where applied on
behalf of officers of the army or navy.
Every promotion and every detail under
the war department must be made solely
with regard to the good of the service
and to the capacity and merit of the man
himself. No pressure, political, social or
personal, of any kind will be permitted
to cxerelse the least effect in a.nv Ques
tion of promotion or detail, and If there
is reason to believe that such pressure is
exercised at the Instigation of the officer
concerned It will be held to militate
against him. In our army we cannot af
ford to have rewards or duties distributed
save on tho simple ground that those who
by their own merits are entitled to the re
wards get them and that those who are
peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen
to perform them.
Every effort should bo made to bring
the army to a constantly increasing state
of efficiency. When on actual service, no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. The paper
work in the army, as in the navy, should
be greatly reduced. What is needed is
proved power of command and capacity
to work well in the field. Constant care
is necessary to prevent dry rot in the
transportation and commissary depart
ments.
Field Exercises Advocated.
Our army is so small and so much scat
tered that it Is very difficult to give the
higher officers (as well as the lower offi
cers and the enlisted men) a chance to
practice maneuvers in mass and on a com
paratively large scale. In time of need
no amount of individual excellence would
avail against tho paralysis which would
follow Inability to work as coherent
whole under skillful and daring leadership.
The congress should provide means
whereby it will be possible to have field
exercises by at least a division of regu
lars and. if possible, also a division of na
tional guardsmen once a year. These ex
ercises might take the form of field ma
neuvers, or If on the gulf coast or the Pa
cific or Atlantic seaboard or In the region
of the great lakes the army corps when
assembled could be marched from some
inland point to some point on the water,
there embarked, disembarked after a cou
ple of days' Journey at some other point
and again marched inland.' Only by actual
handling and providing for men in masses
while they are marching, camping, em
barking and disembarking will it be possi
ble to train the higher officers to perform
their duties well and smoothly.
A great debt is owing from the public
to the men of the army and navy. They
should be so treated as to enable them to
reach the highest point of efficiency so
that they may be able to respond instant
ly to any demand made upon them to sus
tain the interests of the nation and the
honor of tho flag. The individual Amer
ican enlisted man is probably on the
whole a more formidable fighting man
than the regular of any other army. Ev
ery consideration should be shown him.
and In return the highest standard of
usefulness should be exacted from him.
It is well worth while for the congress to
consider whether the pay of enlisted men
upon second and subsequent enlistments
should not be increased to correspond
with the increased value of the veteran
soldier
Arm^ Reorganization.
Much good hns already come from tho
act reorganizing the army passed early in
the present year. Tho three prime re
forms, all of them of literally inestimable
value, are, first, the substitution of four
year'details from the line for permanent
appointments in the so called staff divi
sions second, the establishment of a
corps of artillery with a chief at the
bead third, the establishment of a maxi
mum and minimum limit for the army. It
would bo difficult to overestimate the im
provement I11 tho efficiency of our army

should reoelve hearty encouragement from
the general government.
«T

$u.-p ^r-^^^:r"~
THE OTTPM.WA COURIER.
which these three reforms are making
and have in part already effected.
Tho reorganization provided for by the
act has been substantially accomplished.
The improvod conditions In the Philip
pines have enabled the war department
materially to reduce the military charge
upon our revenue and to arrange the
number of soldiers so as to bring this
number much nearer to tho minimum
than to the maximum limit established by
law. There is. however, need of supple
mentary legislation. Thorough military
education must bo provided and in addi
tion to tho regulars the advantages of
this education should be given to the of
ficers of the national guard and others in
civil llfo who desire intelligently to fit
themselves for possible military duty.
The officers should be given tho chanca
to perfect themselves by study in tho
higher branches of this crt. At West
Point tho education should be of the kind
most npt to turn out men who are good in
actual field service. Toomuchstress should
not be laid on mathematics, nor should pro
ficiency therein be held to establish tho
right of entry to a corps d'elite. Tho typ
ical American officer of the best kind need
not be a good mathematician, but he must
be able to master himself, to control oth
ers and to show boldness and fertility of
resource in overs' emergency.
Action should be taken in reference to
the militia and to tho raising of volunteer
forces. Our mllltla law is obsolete and
worthless. Tho organization and arma
ment of the national guard of the several
states, which are treated as militia in the
appropriations by the congrcss, should be
mado identical with those provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard in time of war should
be carefully defined end a system estab
lished by law under which the method of
procoduro of raising volunteer forces
should be prescribed in advance. It is
utterly Impossible in the excitement and
haste of Impending war to do this satis
factorily if the arrangements have not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should bo made for utilizing in the first
volunteer organizations called out tho
training of those citizens who have al
ready had experience under arms, and es
pecially for the selection In advance of
the officers of any forco which may be
raised for careful selection oi the kind
necessary is Impassible after tSe outbreak
of war.
That the army is not at all a mere in
strument of destruction has been shown
during the last three years. In the Phil
ippines, Cuba and Porto lileo it has prov
ed itself a great constructive force, a
most potent implement for the upbuilding
of a peaceful civilization.
The Veterans.
No other citizens deserve so well of the
republic cs the veterans, tho survivors
of those who saved the Union. They did
the one deed which if left undone would
have meant that all else in our history
went for nothing. But for their steadfast
prowess in the greatest crisis of our his
tory all cur annals would be meaningless
and our great experiment in popular free
dom and self government a gloomy fail
ure. Moreover, they not only left us a
united nation, but they left us also as a
heritage the momory of the mighty deeds
by which the nation was kept united. We
aro now indeed cr.c nation, one in fact as
well as in name we are united in our de
votion to the flag which is the symbol of
national greatness and unity, and the
very completeness of our union enables
us all, in every part of the country, to
glory In the valor shown alike by tho
sons of the north and the sons of the
south In tho times that tried men's souls.
The men who in the last three years
have done so well in tho East and iii the
West Indies and on the mainland of Asia
have shown that this remembrance is not
lost. In any serious crisis the United
States must rely for the great mass of Its
fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery
who do not make a permanent profession
of the military career, and whenever such
a crisis arises the deathless memories of
the civil war will give to Americans the
lift of lofty purpose which comes to thosj
whoso fathers have stood valiantly in the
forefront of tho battle.
The Merit System.
Tho merit system of making appoint
ments is in Its cssence as democratic iyd
American as the common school system
itself. It simply means that in clerical
and other positions where tho duties are
entirely nonpolitioai all applicants should
have a fair field and no favor, each stand
ing 011 his merits as he is able to show
them by practical tert. Written competi
tive examinations offer the only availa
ble means in many cases for applying this
system. In ether eases, as where laborers
are employed, system of registration
undoubtedly can ba widely extended.
There are, of course, places where the
written competitive examination cannot
be applied ard others where it offers by
no moans an ideal solution, but where
under existing political conditions it is,
though an imperfect means, yet tho best
present means of getting satisfactory re
suits.
Wherever the conditions have permitted
the application of the merit system in its
fullest and widest sense the gain to the
governmont has been immense. The navy
yards and postal service illustrate proba
bly better than any other branches of the
government tho great gain in economy,
efficiency and honesty due to the enforce
ment of this principle.
1 recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service to
tho District of Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend it. In
my Judgment all laws providing for the
temporary employment of clerks should
hereafter contain a provision that they be
selccteu under tho civil service law.
It is important to have this system ob
tain at home, but it is even more impor
tant to have it applied rigidly in our insu
lar possessions. Not an office should be
filled In the Philippines or Porto Rico
with any regard to the man's partisan af
filiations or services, with any regard to
the political, social or personal influence
which ho may have at his command. In
short, heed should be paid to absolutely
nothing save the man's uwn character
and capacity and the needs of tho service.
The administration of these islands
should be as wholly freo from the suspi
cion of partisan politics as tho adminis
tration of the army nnd navy. All that
we ask from the public servant in the
Philippines or Porto Rico is that he reflect
honor on his country by the way in which
ho makes that country's rule a benefit to
the peoples who have come under it. This
Is all that we should ask, and we cannot
afford to be content with lews.
Tho merit system is simply one method
of securing honest and efficient adminis
tration of the government, and in the
long run the sole Justification of any typo
of government lies in its proving itself
both honest and efficient.
The Couxnlar Service.
The consular service ia now organized
under tho provisions of a law passed in
1350, which is entirely inadequate to exist
ing conditions. The interest shown by so
many commercial bodies throughout the
country in the reorganization of the serv
ice Is heartily commended to your atten
tion. Several bills providing for a new
consular service have in recent years
been submitted to the congress. They aro
based upon the Just principle that ap
pointments to the service should be made
only after a practical test of the appli
cant's fitness that promotions should be
governed by trustworthiness, adaptability
and zeal In the performance of duty, and
that the tenure of office should be unaf
fected by partisan considerations.
The guardianship and fostering of our
rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the
protection of American citizens resorting
to foreign countries in lawful pursuit of
their affairs and the maintenance of the
dignity of the nation abroad combine to
make It cs^ntiai that our consuls should
•t
be men of'character, knowledge and en
terprise. It is true that the service is now
in the main efficient, but a standard of
excellence cannot be permanently main
tained until the principles set forth in the
bills heretofore submitted to the congress
•an this subject arc enacted into law.
In my Judgment the time has arrived
when we should definitely make up our
minds to recognize the Indian as an indi
vidual and not as a member of a tribe.
The general allotment act is a mighty
pulverizing engine to break up the tribal
mass. It acts directly upon the family
and the individual. Under its provisions
some CO,000 Indians have already become
eltizenH of the United States. We should
now break up the tribal funds, doing for
them what allotment docs for the tribal
lands—that is. they should be divided into
individual holdings. There will be a tran
sition period during
which the funds will in
many cases have to be held in trust. This
is the case also with the lands. A stop
should be put upon the indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments. The effort should be steadily to
make tlie Indian work like any other man
on his own ground. The marriage laws
of the Indians should ba made the same
as those of the whites.
Industrial Education of Indian*.
In the schools the education should be
elementary and largely industrial. The
need of higher education among the In
dians is very, very limited. On the reser
vations care should be taken to try to
suit the teaching to the needs of the par
ticular Indian. There Is no use in at
tempting to induce agriculture in a coun
try suited only for cattle raising, where
the Indian should be made a stock grower.
The ration system, which is merely the
corral and the reservation system, is high
ly detrimental to the Indians. It promotes
beggary, perpetuates pauperism and stifles
Industry. It is an effectual barrier to
progress. It must continue to a greater
or less degree as long as tribes are herded
on reservations and have everything in
common. The Indian should be treated
as an individual, liko the white man.
During the change of treatment Inevitable
hardships will occur. Every effort should
be made to minimize these hardships, but
we should not because of them hesitate to
make the change. There should be a con
tinuous reduction In the number of agen
cies.
In dealing with the aboriginal races few
things aro more important than to pre
serve them from the terrible physical and
moral degradation resulting from the liq
uor traffic. We are doing all we can- to
save our own Indian tribes from this evil.
Wherever by international agreement this
same end can be attained as regards racer
where we do not possess exclusive control
every effort should be mado to bring it
about.
Expositions.
I bespeak the most cordial support from
the congress and the people for the St.
Louis exposition to commemorate the one
hundreelth anniversary of the Louisiana
purchase. This purchase was the greatest
instance of expansion in our history. It
definitely decided that wc were to become
a great continental republic, by far the
foremost power in the western hemi
sphere. It Is one of three or four great
landmarks in our history—the great turn
ing points in our development. It is emi
nently fitting that all our people shouU
Join with heartiest good will in commemo
rating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of
Missouri, of all the adjacent region, are
entitled to every aid in making the cele
bration a noteworthy event in our annals.
We earnestly hope that foreign nations
will appreciate the deep interest our coun
try takes in tills exposition and our view
of its Importance from every standpoint,
and that they will participate in securing
its success. The national government
should be represented by a full and com
plete set of exhibits.
Tho people of Charleston, with great en
ergy and civic spirit, are carrying on an
exposition which will continue throughout
most of the present session of the con
gress. I heartily commend this exposi
tion to the good will of the people. It
doserveo all the encouragement that can
be given it. The managers of the Charles
ton exposition have requested the cabinet
officers to place thereat the government
exhibits which have been at Buffalo,
promising to pay the necessary expenses.
I havo taken the responsibility of direct
ing that this be done, for I feel that It is
due to Charleston to help her in her
praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the
management should not be required to
pay all these expenses. I earnestly rec
ommend that the congress appropriate at
once the small sum necessary for this
purpose.
The Pan-American exposition at Buffalo
has just closed. Both from the industrial
and the artistic standpoint this exposition
has been in a high degree creditable and
useful not merely to Buffalo, but to the
United States. The terrible tragedy of the
president's assassination interfered mate
rially with its being a financial success.
Tho exposition was peculiarly in harmony
with the trend of our public policy, be
cause it represented an effort to bring
into closer touch all tho peoples of the
western hemisphere and give them an in
creasing sense of unity. Such an effort
was a genuine service to the entire Amer
ican public.
Science and Education.
The advancement of the highest inter
ests of national science and learning and
the custody of objects of art and of the
valuable results of scientific expeditions
conducted by the United States havo been
committed to the Smithsonian institution.
In furtherance of its declared purpose—
for the "increase and diffusion of knowl
edge among men"—the congress has from
time to time given it other important
functions. Such trusts have been exe
cuted by the institution with notable fidel
ity. There should be no halt in the work
of the institution, in accordance with the
plans which its secretary has presented,
for the preservation of the vanishing
races of great North American animals in
the National Zoological park. The urgent
needs of the National museum are rec
ommended to the favorable consideration
of the congress.
Perhaps tlie most characteristic edu
cational movement of the past fifty years
is that which has created the modern
public library and developed it into broad
and active service. There are now over
5.000 public libraries in the United States,
the product of this period. In addition
to accumulating material, they are also
striving by organization, by Improvement
in method and by co-operation to give
greater efficiency to the material they
hold, to make it more widely useful and
by avoidance of unnecessary duplication
In process to reduce the cost of its ad
ministration.
In these efforts they naturally look for
assistance to the federal library, which,
though still the library of congress and
so entitled, is the one national library
of the United States. Already the largest
Binglo collection of books on the western
hemisphere and certain to increase more
rapidly than any other through purchase,
exchange and the operation of the copy
right law, tliis library has a unique oppor
tunity to render to tho libraries of this
country—to American scholarship—service
of the highest importance. It is housed
in a building which is the largest and
most magnificent yet erected for library
uses. Resources are now being provided
which will develop the collection properly,
equip It with the apparatus and service
necessary to its effective use, render its
bibliographic work widely available and
enable it to become not merely a center of
research, but the chief factor in great co
operative efforts for the diffusion of
knowledge and the advancement of learn
ing.
For the sake of good administration,
sound economy and the advancement of
science the census office as now constitut
ed should be made a permanent govern
ment bureau. This would Insure better,

eheaper and more satisfactory work In
the Interest not only of our business, but
Of statistic, economic and social science.
The Postal Service.
The remarkable growth of the postal
service is shown In the fact that its rev
enues have doubled and its expenditure*
have nearly doubled within twelve years.
Its progressive development compels con
stantly increasing outlay, but in this pe
riod of business energy and prosperity its
receipts grow so much faster than its ex
penses that the annual deficit has been
steadily rcduced from $11,411,779 in 1897 to
13.9:3,727 in 1901. Among recent postal ad
vances the success of rural free delivery
Wherever established has been so marked
and actual experience has made its bene
fits so plain that the demand for its ex
tension is general and urgent.
It is Just that the great agricultural
population should sharo in the improve
ment of tho service. The number of rural
routes now in operation is 6,009, practical
ly all established within three years, and
thero are 6,000 applications awaiting ac
tion. It Is expected that the number in
operation at the close of the current fiscal
year will reach 8,600. The mail will then
be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of
our people who have heretofore been de
pendent upon distant offices, and one-third
of all that portion of the country which is
adapted to it will be covered by this kind
of service.
The full measure of postal progress
which might be realized has long been
hampered and obstructed by the hc-avy
burden imposed on the government
through the intrenched and well under
stood abuses which have grown up in con
nection with second class mail matter.
The extent of this burden appears when it
Is stated that, while the second class mat
ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight
of ail the mall, It paid for the last fiscal
year only $4,294,415 of the aggregate postal
revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate
of postage, which produces the large loss
thus entailed and which was fixed by the
congress with the purpose of encouraging
the dissemination of public information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no Just exception could be taken.
That expense would be the recognized and
accepted cost of a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted for a Justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys the
privileged rate is wholly outside of the
Intent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of Its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of such wrongly included
matter Is estimated by postal experts to
be one-half of the whole volume of second
class mall. If it be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of the burden is
apparent. The postofflce department has
now undertaken to remove the abuses so
far as Is possible by a stricter application
of the law, and it should be sustained in
Its effort.
The Cblieie Situation.
Owing to the rapid growth of our power
and our interests on the Pacific, whatever
happens in China must be of the keenest
national concern to us.
The general terms of the settlement of
the questions growing out of the antifor
eign uprisings In China of 1900, having
been formulated in a Joint note addressed
to China by the representatives of the in
jured powers in December last, were
promptly accepted by the Chinese govern
ment. After protracted conferences the
plenipotentiaries of the several powers
were able to uign a final protocol with the
Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of
last September, setting forth the meas
ures taken by China in compliance with
the demands of the joint note and ex
pressing their satisfaction therewith. It
will be laid before the congress, with a re
port of the plenipotentiary on behalf of
the United States, Mr. William Woodville
Rockhill, to whom high praise is due for
the tact, good judgment and energy lie
has displayed in performing an exception
ally difficult and delicate task.
Tlie agreement reached disposes in a
manner satisfactory to the powers of the
various grounds of complaint and will
contribute materially to better future re
lations between China and the powers.
Reparation has been made by China for
the murder of foreigners during the up
rising, and punishment has been inflicted
on the officials, however high in rank,
recognized as responsible for or having
participated in the outbreak. Official ex
aminations have been forbidden for a pe
riod of five years in all cities in which
foreigners have been murdered or cruelly
treated, and edicts have been issued mak
ing all officials directly responsible forAhe
future safety of foreigners and for the
suppression of violence against them.
Provisions have been made l'or insuring
the future safety of the foreign repre
sentatives in Peking by setting aside for
their exclusive use a quarter of the city
which tho powers can make defensible
and in which they can If necessary main
tain permanent military guards, by dis
mantling the military works between the
capital and the sea and by allowing the
temporary maintenance of foreign mili
tary posts along this line. An edict has
been issued by the emperor of China pro
hibiting for two years the importation of
arms and ammunition into China. China
has agreed to pay adequate indemnities
to the states, societies and individuals
for the losses sustained by then**nd for
the expenses of the military exjweutions
sent by the various powers to protect life
and restore order.
What China Has Promised.
Under the provisions of the Joint note
of December, 1900, China has agreed to re
vise the treaties of commerce and naviga
tion and to take such other steps for the
purpose of facilitating foreign trade as
the foreign powers may decide to be
needed.
The Chinese government has agreed to
participate financially in the work of bet
tering the water approaches to Shanghai
and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade in central and northern'China, and
an international conservancy board, In
which the Chinese government is largely
represented, has been provided for the
improvement of the Shanghai river and
the control of its navigation. In tho same
line of commercial advantages a revision
of the present tariff on Imports has been
assented to for the purpose of substitut
ing specific for ad valorem duties, and an
expert has been sent abroad on the part
of the United States to assist in this
work. A list of article:] to remain free of
duty, including flour, cereals and rice,
gold and silver coin and bullion, has also
been agreed upon in the settlement.
During these troubles our government
has unswervingly advocated moderation
and has materially aided in bringing
about an adjustment which tends to en
hance the welfare of China and to lead
to a more beneficial Intercourse between
the empire and the modern world, while
In the critical period of revolt and mas
sacre wc did our full share in safeguard
ing life and property, restoring order and
vindicating the national interest and hon
or. It behooves us to continue in these
paths, doing wiiat lies in our power to
foster feelings of good will and leaving no
effort untried to work out the great policy
of full and fair intercourse between China
and tho nations on a footing of equal
rights and advantages to all. We advo
cate the "open door" with all that it im
plies not merely the procurement of en
larged commercial opportunities on the
coasts, but access to tho interior by tho
waterways with which China has been so
extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing
the people of China Into peaceful and
friendly community of trade with all the
peoples of the earth can the work now
auspiciously begun be carried to fruition.
In the attainment of this purpose we nec
essarily claim parity of treatment under
the conventions throughout the empire for
our trade and our citizens with those of
all other powers.
AVe view with lively interest and keen
htpes of beneficial rtsulta the proceedings
A
Of the pan-American congress convoked
at the Invitation of Mexico and now sit
ting at the Mexican capital. The dele
gates of tho United States are under the
most liberal Instructions to co-operate
with their colleagues in all matters prom
ising advantage to tho great family of
American commonwealths, as well in
their relations among themselves as in
their domestic advancement and in their
intercourse with the world at large.
My predecessor communicated to the
congress the fact that the Weil and La
Abra awards against Mexico have been
adjudged by the highest courts of our
country to have been obtained through
fraud and perjury on tho part of tho
claimants and that in accordance with
the acts of the congress tho money re
maining in the hands of the secretary of
state on these awards has been returned
to Mexico. A considerable portion of the
money received from Mexico on these
awards had been paid by this government
to the claimants before the decision of
the courts was rendered. My judgment is
that the congrcss should return to Mexico
an amount equal to the sums thus already
paid to tho claimants.
The death of Queen Victoria caused thA
people of the United States deep anft
heartfelt sorrow, to which the government
gave full expression. When President Mo.
Iiinley died, our nation in turn received
from every quarter of the British empira
expressions of grief and sympathy no
less sincere. Tho death of the Empress
Dowager Frederick of Germany also
aroused the genuine sympathy of the
American people, and this sympathy wasl
cordially reciprocated by Germany when
the president was assassinated. Indeed
from every quarter of the civilized world
we received, at the time of the president'^
death, assurances of such grief and re-,
gard as to touch the hearts of our people.
In the midst of our affliction we reverent*
ly thank the Almighty that we are at
peace with the nations of mankind, and
we firmly intend that our policy shall bo
such as to continue unbroken these lnter«
national relations of mutual respeot amj
good will. THEODORE ROOSEVELT,
White House, Dec. 3, 1901.
How a Blind Man Can Tell Time,
Perhaps many people have noticed thlfi
the blind man who plays the hand organ
day after day at Grand avenue bridfq
has a watch in his pocket. £[e has at
watch and can tell time too.
Yesterday a man dropped a nickel iq
his cup and, noticing the watch, asked
him for the time. It was a queer ques«
tion to ask, bat he saw the watch an$
wanted to know whether the blind mag
was simply pretend^* to be sightless.
"I think I can tell, Said the blind mazr.
He held it up close to his ear and Blowlxl
turned the stem winder.
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight," he counted, and then he saida
"That means seventy-two minutes.
wound up tho watch tightly at S o'clock,
and so the time ought to be about twelvd
minutes past 4. Here, look and see how
near I came to it."
His questioner looked, and the time wtfl
4:18. He was only six minutes off.
"Do you mean to say that you can tell
the time of day by winding up youB
watch'.'"
"Not exactly, but I can come mighty
near it, usually within ten minutes, and
it's very easy too. All you have to know
is how one long click ia winding up will
run the watch. I'll expluin. Suppose
that at 3 o'clock I wind up my watch
until it is tight, as we say—that is, until
another turn of the winder would appar
?ntly break a spring. At 5 o'clock I
.vind the watch again and find that tho
A'iudcr clicks twelve times before the

Tlie Electric Light.
Tho electric lijjlit was exhibited for the
iivit time in the United States at the
.Vntcnuial exposition, but those who saw
were skeptical regarding the possibih
of using it upon any scale that would
be of practical benefit to mankind.
While arc lightiug was produced upon
a commercial scale in 1877, the real his
tory of the art as regards its modern as.
pec-ts dates from the opening of the Pearl
street station in Xew York city by Thorn*
as A. Edison on Sept. 4, 1882, in which
the Edison incandescent lamp was used.
In nineteen years this industry has grown
to where the investment in electric light-*
iug plants in the United States alone nov(i
reaches the enormous sum of
$700,000,
000, according to a very careful tabula*
tion made by The Electrical Review oA
New York.
This extraordinary achievement repre"
sents a struggle with powerful and well
organized competition of a long estab
lished industry—that of gas illumination*
It made its way against bitter opposition,
against corrupt councils and the difficul*
ties and failures incident to overcapltaW
ization to where it is now, one of tha sol*
id, certain and remunerative industries
of the country.
Kodlalc, Not Kadinlr.
On the coast of Alaska, near Cook la*
let, is a large island which has had trou*
ble with its name—trouble with its spell*
ing, trouble with its pronunciation.
The spelling now adopted by the United
States board of geographical names ia
Kodiak (.pronounced lCo-di-ak), this being
a reversal of the decision Kadiak made)
by the same board about ten years ago.
The universal local usgge as to this nama
is Kodiak. Such, also, is the general
usage on the Pacific coast. It is this
widely extended and firmly established
usage which has led the board to discard
an alleged "correct" form and adopt aa
alleged "corrupt" form which local usage
has firmly established. National Qtw

Its Effect on Kitchener.
A British officer who has served id
South Africa and is now in the United
States tells a characteristic story of Lord
Kitchener. A young subaltern in charge
of some construction work in uppec
Ej ypt had the misfortune to lose some
native workmen through the accidents)
explosion of several cases of dynamite,
fearful of a reproval from headquarters:,
he telegraphed to the sirdar, "Regret to
report killing of ten laborers by dyna
mite accident." He awaited the expect
ed rebuke with fear aud trepidation.
In a few hours came this laconic dis
patch: "Do you need any more dyna
mite?"
Be Brief.
'Tis a busy world, dear friends, and if
fou would have people listen patient !y N
our story we must be brief. Dr. llimw
of London once preached so long that nil
his congregation dropped off, leaving the
sexton and himself alone. The se\tou,
finding the doctor apparently no nearer a
conclusion, said to him: "Sir, hero are tbe
keys. Please lock up the church when
you get through your discourse." It it
quality and not quautity that counts, "not
how much, but ho* good."—National
