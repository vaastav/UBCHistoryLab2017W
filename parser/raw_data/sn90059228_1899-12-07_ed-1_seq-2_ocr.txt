I '-.J-
Washington, Dec. 4.The annual report
of the secretary of the navy, just made pub
lic, is a document of unusual interest, deal
ing not only with the work of the navy
during the past year and important recom
mendations for the future, but also dis
cussing the more important questions re
lating to the navy, including the authori
zation of 18 new warships, the imperative
need of special legislation in the early
days of congress for armor of the best
quality that can be obtained and the prop
osition that the thanks of congress be
given to the commander-in-chief of the
North Atlantic squadron and to the offi
cers and men under his command for the
part they took in the naval operations at
Santiago.
Increase in the Navy.
These larger items of the report receive
extended attention at the hands of Sec
retary Long. As to the increase of the
navy he says:
"The number of large, s-wift and power
ful armored cruisers of great coal endur
ance in our navy is largely disproportionate
to the rest of the naval establishment.
The experience of the last year has als'o
shown the need of several smaller vessels
usually classed as gunboats, 'it is there
fore recommended that congress be re
quested to authorize the construction of the
following vessels:
"First. Three armored cruisers of about
13,000 tons' displacement, of a maximum
draught of deep load not to exceed 26 feet,
carrying the heaviest armor and most pow
erful ordnance for vessels of their class,
to be so sheathed and coppered as to have
the highest practicable speed and greatest
radius of action.
"Second. Twelve gunboats of about 900
tons' trial displacement, to be sheathed and
coppered.
"And, third, as recommended a year ago,
three protected) cruisers of about 8,000
tons' trial displacement, carrying the most
powerful ordnance for vessels of this class,
to be sheathed and coppered and to have
the highest possible speed and great radius
of action."
The secretary adds in this connection that
the 8,000-ton protected cruisers are consid
ered better adapted to the present needs
of the navy than the 6,000-ton ships rec
ommended last year. He also asks that if
satisfactory bids cannot be obtained for
the new ships authority be given to build
them at the United States navy yards.
Services Should Be Recognized.
The secretary's reference and recommen
dation as to those who' took part in the op
erations at the battle of Santiago are as
follows: "While those engaged in the battle
of Manila have been deservedly rewarded
and no men ever deserved reward more
richlythose who took part in the opera
tions at Santiago, displaying the same con
spicuous conduct and extraordinary hero
ism, have received no recognition what
ever for their great services except the
recommendations for promotion by the
president, which have lapsed, not having
been acted upon by the senate. The depart
ment believes it due to these gallant men
to suggest to you that their services be
recognized and equal justice done them,
and that, in accordance with the statute in
such cases made and provided, you rec
ommend that the thanks of congress be
given to the commander in chief of the
North Atlantic squadron and to the offi
cers and men under his command, as they
were given in the case of the commander
in chief and officers and men of the Asiatic
squadron.

of which it discharged with signal effi

and enormous responsibilities, and was
brought to a successful and glorious con
summation, which terminated the war by
the destruction of the Spanish sea power.
It was marked by unsurpassed precision,
brilliancy and vigor. That the men who by
such achievement earned their coun
try's gratitude have received no reward
from its government is an omission which
cannot be doubted will be cordially and
generously repaired.
"If reward by the present system of pro
motion is abandoned, the department re
news its suggestion embodied in senate bill
5,005, introduced at the last session of con
gress, which provides for medals of three
classesone for conspicuous conduct in
war, one for extraordinary heroism and
one for general meritorious servicethe
first to carry with it a per centage of in
crease of pay, based upon the rank of the
recipient, and calculated to take the place
of the increase which would be the result
of promotion were that form of reward con
tinued. It is believed that such a medal,
worn during life and transmitted for an
inheritance, will be far more grateful to
a deserving officer than a promotion in
rank at the expense of a comrade."
The Armor Question.
Concerning armor for warships the sec
retary says: "The most important ques
tion pertaining to naval construction at the
present time, and one that demands prompt
attention, is that of the armor for vessels
now building and for others authorized but
not yet contracted for on account of the
provision in the act of March 3, 1899, pro
hibiting the department from contracting
for the vessels therein authorized until
contract 'has been made for the armor
therefor within }300 a ton. The price fixed
is one for which even inferior armor can
not be obtained, and the" department has
therefore been unable to invite proposals
for the three battleships and the three
armored cruisers authorized by the act of
March 3, 1899." The secretary then shows
that 7,358 tons of armor are needed for the
battleships Maine, Ohio and Missouri,
about 9,000 tons for the new battleships not
yet begun-and about 5,100 tons for the ar
mored cruisers already authorized, a total
of. about 21,458 tons. He says that $400 a
ton probably will buy armor made by the
ordinary process of face hardening, which,
though good, is not the best, and the de
partment does not therefore consider it
suitable for vessels of the Maine class.
After pointing out the features of the new
process of making armor ami Its adoption
by leading maritime nations except the
United States, the secretary says: "The
department desires to make use of such
armor for the vessels now building which
are yet unsupplied with armor, and for the
armored vessels authorized and not yet
contracted for."
A Recommendation.
His recommendation is as follows: "it is
urgently recommended that in the early
days of its next session congress enact such
special legislation, by joint resolution or
otherwise, as may be necessary to enable
the department to make contracts early in
the coming year for 7,358 tons of armor of
the best quality that can be obtained in
this country for the Maine, Ohio and Mis
souri, and that the provision of the act of
March 3, 1899, limiting the price of armor
to $200 per ton, and the restriction prevent
ing the armored vessels therein authorized
from being contracted for until the armor
therefor is contracted for,' be removed.
Whatever may be the future action of con
gress regarding the establishment of a gov-
ernment armor'factory. It can hardly affect
the^aupply of armor for the Ma!ne? Ghlo
."and Missouri, as it will under any circum
stances be impracticable "to obtain itf-from
such a source in reasonable time to com
plete -the vessels above referred to."
Other Topics.
Secretary Long refers to the returmof
Admiral Dewey and his enthusiastic, wel
come from the whole country. After speak-!
ing of the New York reception and the
sword presentation in Washington the sec
retary sums up by saying it was the na
tion's tribute.
Among the many other topics treated Is
that for fostering the naval reserve, the
consolidation of the naval bureaus of con
struction, engineering and equipment in
the interest of more harmonious action the
construction of barracks for enlisted men,
and a review of the various bureau recom
mendations, the desirability of changing
the material of the League Island and the
Mare Island dry docks from timber to stone
and concrete. The warships claiming
bounty and prize money from their cap-,
tures and engagements .during the
war are- set forth in detail. He says
the survey of the trans-Pacific cable
route indicates that it will be en
tirely practicable. It is intended also to
survey a cable route from Guam to Yoko
hama. Jt is proposed to supply all new
ships with smokeless powder. 'The 12-inch
gun has been so greatly developed that it
has been designated as the heaviest gun
for the latest battleships, instead of the
13-inch gun. Many improvements in naval
ordnance are under way, including uniform
caliber for small arms and machine guns.
Work on the design of gunboat No. 16 to
replace t'he Michigan on the great lakes
ftas been suspended pending negotiations
with Great Britain for a modification of
the treaty. Secretary Long reviews also
the various naval incidents of the last
year.
The secretary gives a table showing naval
construction going on abroad, as compared
with that in the United States. From this
it appears that only Italy and Japan laid
down less tonnage than this country during
the present year, and that Italy alone had
less tonnage under construction. The total
tonnage under construction is: England,
531,680 France, 255,533 Germany, 148,235
Italy, 120,540 Japan, 13,0,000 Russia, 222,976
United States, 123,236. -iXW
OUR MAILS.
Some Extracts from the Report of
the Postmaster General.
Washington, Dec. 4.The annual report
of Postmaster General Charles Emory
Smith is made public. Its chief feature is
a plea for congressional action to stop the
abuse of second-class mail privileges,
which, he says, results in an. annual waste
of upwards of $20,000,000. The financial ex
hibit for the fiscal year shows total ex
penditures of $101,632,161 and total reseipts
of $95,021,384, the deficiency being $2,422,747
less than last year.
Second-Class Mail.
The postmaster general says: "The most
urgent need of the postal service is the
rectification of the enormous wrongs which
have grown up in the perversion and abuse
of the privilege accorded by law to second
class matter. There are many improve
ments and advances waiting development
and. application opportunities for speedier
transmission and delivery fields for broad
ening the scope of the mail service and
bringing it closer home to the people pos
sibilities of reduced postage but above and
beneath and beyond all of these measures
of progress, which experience and intelli
gence are working out, is the redemption
of the special concession which congress
granted for a distinct and justifiable public
object from the fungus growths and the
flagrant evils that have fastened upon it.
This costly abuse, which drags on the de
partment and weighs down the service,
trammels its power and means of effective
advancement in every direction, involves a
sheer wanton waste of $20,000,000 or upward
a year. The postal deficit for the current
year is $6,610,776. But for this wrongful ap
plication of the second-class rate, instead
of a deficit there would be a clear surplus
of many millions. It is not now proposed
to restrict the privileges of legitimate pub
lications or to modify the design of the
law, but only to bring back its application
to its original and just scope.
"It is believed that fully one-half of all
the matter mailed as second-class and paid
for at the pound rate is not properly sec
ond-class within the intent of the law, and
ought justly to be paid for at the third
class rate. This gives the enormous quan
tity of 176,351,613 pounds, from which the
department derives only a fraction of the
revenue to which it is fairly entitled. The
department actually derives a revenue of
14.75 cents a pound for the third-class mat
ter mailed last year, and on this basis
the department would have received for
this wrongly-classed secor.id-rate matter
$26,011,863, instead of $1,763,516 which it ac
tually received, and-the postal revenues
would have been increased by the hand
some sum of $24,248,347." Mr. Smith con
cludes that over one-fourth of the entire
volume and weight of the mails pay as sec
ond-class matter when it should pay third
class, and that this furnishes only one
fifty-fifth part of the postal revenue, and
its carrying, reckoning at eight cents a
pound, costs $14,108,129, while revenue from
it was $1,763,516, thus causing a loss to the
government of over $12,000,000.
"If there is to be a favored class," Mr.
Smith says, "let it embrace all the people.
With this class paying properly even pen
ny postage, with reasonable limitations,
could be applied to letters without entail
ing a deficit larger than that of the last
few years, and possibly with none at all."
Onr Sew Possessions.
Regarding our new possessions the post
master general says: "The presence of
United States troops in the new island pos
sessions and Cuba, in constant communi
cation with home, constrained-the estab
lishment of mail facilities for their needs
and the practical obliteration of the old
local postal system with,the extinguish
ment of Spanish authority compelled a re
construction of the whole service for the
requirementsr three nativel

Ru aolf FeDeivery
"The free delivery of mails in the rural
districts has proved to be one of the most
important among recent developments of
the postal service, and presents in its pos-,
sibilities a question of the largest propor
tions. The results already attained have
been of a significant character, and the
practical evidences bearing upon the feasi
bility of the system, upon the degree of its
self-support and upon the effect artd the
sentiment in the communities where it has1
been tried, deserve the most careful consid
eration. How far the system shall be ex
tended is submitted for the determination
of congress, with a full presentation of
facts upon which to base a conclusion. This
service has been called 'experimental' in
each appropriation made vby congress for
its continuance. It is the opinion of the
officers having it in charge that the experi
mental stage has been passed, and in their
View I coincide. The appropriation for
rural free delivery service for the present
fiscal year was increased from $150,000 to
$300,000, and this amount will be practically
absorbed by the continuance to the end
of the fiscal year of "the service already es
tablished. It is now unsuccessful operation
from 300 distributing- points, scattered
among 40 states and one territory (the only
states unrepresented in the list being Ida
ho, Mississippi, Montana and Wyoming)
giving service to 179,131 people, at an, aver
age annual cost of 84 cents per capita."'

Adopt Reed Rales
The extraordinary thing the caucus
did do was to perfunctorily consent to
the readoption for temporary purposes
of the Reed rules. Col. Hepburn, who
was expected to make a fight on these
rules, failed to do so, and it was taken
for granted that his promise to the
preside nt acted as a permanent check
upon his desire to restore the old par

house worked previous to Reed's reg

ably be a bitter and prolonged fight on
the floor of the house.

There was nothing perfunctory about

taken, and Representative Sulzer (N.

(Ala,) withdrew during the fourth bal
lot without specifying who his friends
ought to vote for, but they near ly all
flocked to Richardson. The contest
opened up so evenly that it looked hard
to pick the -winner. Bankhead had 34
De Armond (Mo.), 39 Richardson, 43,
and Sulzer, 25. There were unimpor
tant variations from these figures dur
ing the succeeding ballots until the
final roll call disclosed that Richardson
had 90 and De Armond, who remained
in the fight to the finish, 47.
The Week in the House.
Washington, Dec. 4.The opening
week of the session in the house prom-i
ises to be crowd ed with stirring events.
There is always a good deal of glamour
in connection with the assembling of
a new congress, whi ch is a social as
well as a political event. The galleries
are always crowded and there is in
tense interest in the election of a
speaker, the swearing in of members,,
at the bar of the house, the reading of
the president's message, the biennial
seat drawing, the introduction of bills
and resolutions -into the legislative
hopper, and the general -clearing of
decks for action later on. But, as the
committe es are not appointed until
just before the holiday recess, no ac
tual business is transacted usually un
til after the recess. This year it will
be different.
The Roberts CasejN?1
A the very threshold of the session
will come the contest over, the admis
sion of Representative-elect Roberts, of
Utah, and later in the week the.house
will plunge into an important'and pos
sibly a protracted debate upon the
ffjiwfftfigaftaft r-Vfc
financial bill which was prepared "by
the republican leaders last spring at
Atlantic City. The Roberts case has
attracted the attention of the who le
countryl,' The republican leaders have
adopted a "plan of procedure whi ch is
designed to prevent Mr. Roberts from
taking the oath of office until after the
charges in connection with his alleged
polygamous practices have been inves
tigated by a special committee. Mr
Taylor, of Ohio, will make the objec
tion to the administration of the oath
to Mr. Roberts, and will offer a resolu
tion of his case to a special committee.
Every member of the house has been
bombarded wi th petitions in the Rob
erts case, and there undoubtedly will
be a large majority, without regard to
party lines, in support of the plan out
lined by the republican leaders. Owing
to the time which will be consumed in
the disposition of the Roberts case, the
drawing of seats, which usually re
quires several hours, probably will be
postponed until Tuesday.
The announcement of Vice Presi
dent Hobart's death will be made prob
ably immediately after the Roberts case
is disposed of, and the house will ad
journ out of respect to his memory.
The drawing of seats and the reading
of the president's message will occupy
Tuesday. Tuesday nig ht the republic
ans will caucus on the financial bill. I
is the intention of the republican lead
ers to make this a caucus measure and
proceed to pass it before the holiday
recess. The caucus will decide, if the
present intention is'followed, not to
wa it for the appointment of the com
mittee on banking and currency, but
to bring the bill into the house forth
with, probab ly under special order from
the committee on rules. The debate
may begin on Wednesday. The leng th
of ti me to be given to debate has not
yet been determined. By some it is
thought that three or four days may
suffice, r-
In the Senate.
While the session promises to be upon
the whole a busy one in the senate, the
first week probably will be marked by
considerable lethargy. Indeed, it
would be exceptional if any actual work
should be done. To-day the new sena
tors will be sworn in, but beyond this
nothing will be done. Ordinarily the
president's message is received on the
first day of the session, but its receipt
will be postponed for a ay this session
out of respect to the memory of the late
Vice Preside nt Hbbart, whose death
Senator Sewall will announce. Tues
day little will be done beyond the re
ceipt of the annual message, the pres
ent purpose being to adjourn imme
diately after the reading of the message
to give the republican senators an op
portunity to hold a caucus over the
eorganization of the committees.
Wednesday and Thursday will be de
voted largely to the, introduction of
bills. There probably will be no session
either Friday or Saturda y.
Among the first bills to be introduced
will be the financial measure prepar ed
by the republican members' of the
finance committee. I will be offered
by Senator Aldrich and will be referred
to the whole finance committee, includ
i ng the democratic members. While
comparatively little time will be spent
in the senate chamber during the early
da ys of the session, much attention will
be paid to getting ready for the impor
tant matters to receive attention later.
These include the financial bill, the po
licy to be pursued in the Philippines
and Cuba, the form of government to
be provided for Hawaii and the ratifica
tion of the various reciprocity treaties
negotiated during the recess, Porto
Rico and the seating of senators ap
pointed by governors.
Up to date only one senatorial ap
pointment has been made. This is in
the case of Senator Quay, but if he is
seated there will be an effort to fill the
vacant seats from Utah, California and
Delaware by the same method s. There
is unusual interest in Mr. Quay's case,
and both his friends and opposing sen
ators are already working zealously.

himself and had lost six er cent, of
his entire force in addition to another
six er cent, in two previous battles,
but he had no idea that he had been
beaten, and has no intenti on of let
ting the enemy or the English people
think so.
Gen. Methuen is not a tactician, and"
he works his men terribly har d, as is
proved by the record of having marched
53 miles within seven da ys and fought
three battles wi th 12 er cent: of his=
entire force killed or disabled, but he
is a fine type of English grit and invinf
cible courage. I seems probable from^-l-
a clew furnished by the Standard corfyd,,
respondent that Gen. Methuen expect-*^!
ed to find the enemy in force, not at'^
Modder river, but Spytfontein beyond5^
and that he was not prepared to meet
so strong an army as confronted him.
When he reached the swollen stream he$^
accepted the challenge to battle at once
and fought from hour to hour until
evening.
Kind "Words for Young Hay. Xr'"!!&*>
Perhaps the brightest spot for Eng
lish readers is the announcement that
President McKinley has designated tJie
son of Secretary Hay to succeed MJV
Macrum in Pretori a. The Daily Tele
graph says: "This appointment is a.
graceful concession on the part of the
United States government to British
feeling. Our countrymen's interests
will be safe in the hands of the nevr
consul."
French Ambassador Depart s,
London, Dec. 4.The French ambas
sador returned to Paris Saturda y. A
report comes from Paris that the Brit
ish ambassador has applied for two
months' leave of absence. The de-^-
parture of the French^ ambassador, it
is believed, is intended as a protest
against Secretary Chamberlain's speech
I is said tie will remain away until,
some explanation or qualification of Mr..
Chamberlain's language has been pub
licly offered by "Lord- Salisbi|ry. The
feeling here is that the relations of the"
two countries are in a critical condi
tion.

The aggregate of casualties among
the noncommissioned officers and men
is 452. The only list of officers so far &
reported was admittedly incomplete,. *1
giving four killed and 19 wounded. One
entire brigade's losses were not in
eluded in the report. This makes the
total of casualties in the Modder river
battle known to be 475, with the Ninth
brigade yet to hear from.- S
Boer Loss Thonght to Be Small.
I is a significant fact that Lord
Methuen 's cablegram makes no men
tion of the Boer loss, which, therefore,
is assumed to be small.
Is Joubert Dead.'
According to a special dispatch fr om
Cape Town, Gen. Joubert was killed
November 10, but Gen. Bullets dispatch
of November 28 showed that Gen. White- i
was in communication wi th Gen. Jou
bert or somebody personati ng him
about November 19. A.'.
Entire Force in Action.
While the details of the battle were
unknown these official data 'threw a
strong light, upon the engagement,,
which had remained for four days an
inexplicable myster y. Gen. Methuen's
entire force was under fire, for casui-yr
alties have been- reported from every
unit of the army, except the North
ampton battalion. After fighting des
perately for ten hours he could only
claim a slight tactical advantage, since
he had succeeded in throwing a small
force across the river, and, in his own?
words, had made the Boers quit their
positions. He was slightly wounded

London, Dec. 4.The week^'opens^-,
without a word of news, which the Brit- *i?j,
ish public is so anxiously awaiting,.:?^
With a larg er army in the field than
the country ever before mobilized, it
can only be said that the loss of 3,50*{||
men, entailed before the enemy's bor- 1*i
ders have been crossed, is a seriousV-^
matter and, while there is no feeling
r"&\
of despondency as to the eventual re-^/s
suit of the war, it is regretfully admit
ted on all sides that the strength of the -'5?
Boer resistance has been woefully un- vhf
derrated. I is now seen that the at
tempt to hold a useless position at
Mafeking was a serious tactical mis
take, as was also the endeavor to keep
