dlcatlng great aatisfactlon with con
cluslon of the exchanges. The ex
change of notea Is based on the Idea

slgnatory powers hae prepared a

the President to acount for havlng', as
they construe It, usurped hls power
In eoncluding what Is practlcnlly a
tieaty wlih Japan wltbout asklug the
sauctlou of the senate. Tho Denio--rais
regard the .lapauese agreement
as serving the Miine pnrposes as a
treaty, and u liealy under tbe constl
t ui I on laust tei-ehe the aanotlon of tho
ennte.
With a vlew of brlnglng tho niatter
ln :m lssue the senate, ou the motloti
of Senator Hacon of Georgia, ranklng
ineinber of the foreign relatiotm coni
tnittee, adopted a resolutlon asklng the
President to seud tlie notes of the
agreement to the senate for its ratl
tlcation. This the President has de
cllned to do, but he sent the notes to
tho senate for "its Informutlon," and
they have been referred to the foreign
lelations coiuiulttee.
Seeretary Hoot has written to Sena
tor Culloni, cliairiuan of the coninilt
tee, asklng lo be ullowed to appear be
fore the i-oininlttee to explaln the scupe
of the notes and tbe reason why the
agreement was luade witli ,lapnn.
When t-'eirelary Kool appt-ars before
the cominltlee he wlll be Mihjeeled to a
sovere exauiiiiutlou by ihe Deniocratlc
ineinhers of the conimiilee.
But the Deinocrals wlll not bo con
lent with nieiely exatnining Seeietary
Root and wlll discuss the ntalter ln tlie
senate. The Kepublirnns will endeavor
lo have tbe debate condueted ln secret
seshlon, but tlie Deinocrals want tbe
largest atnounl of publicily and wlll
stand out for an open debate.
Tbe posltlon of Ihe two partles is
paradoxlcal enoug'h to have appealed to
the fantastlc braln of a ailberl. The
Republlcans assert that tbe dl)lotnatlc
notes are not a treaty, but as tbe de
bate Is In regaid to a tieaty, aud un
der the niles of ihe senate all tieatles
are dlpeusi-ed ln seeiet session, then
thls debate niust also be held with
c-losed doors. The Demoernts, on llie
other hand, contend that Ihe notes
aie a tieaty, but as tlie Republlcans
say Ihal the notes are not a treaty,
then there is no iea:ou why Ihe de
bate sliould lollow tlie oidlnary rules
of tieaty discnssion and he held with
the publie exi-luded lioin Ihe gallerlea
whlch is lalher anuising.
Tbe senate has ihe power any time
to exclude the publie and stt In se
cret session, no niatter what is under
consideration, aud if tlie Repiibllt-ans
declde that it ls better not to lake Ihe
publie iuto thelr confldenee they can
of couise close the gallerlea and tbe
Deniocrats wlll have to siilimll, but
in the case the Deniocrats ian stll
make a good deal of trouble lor the
Hepubllrans by diso.usslng tho subjecl
when an appropriatlon blll or nny oth
er legislatlve niatter ls before the sen
ate, and Republlcans wlll have to be
coustaully on the wau-h to call tlie
offendlng Deniocials lo order.
At any rote Deniocratie senators' say
they intend that the niatter shall be
fully veutllated and the eoiintry shall
Unow how the i-onstiluliiin lius been
disreganled. The senate, they s-ay,
under the constitntiou Is part of tlie
treaty inaklng riowers of the govein
nient and if the senate submits lo thls
new niethod of niaklng treatles by the
exchange of notes and wtthout Ihe
sanctton of the senate, then the con
stitntiou haa been broken down by
cxecutive actlon and tbe senate has
been deprived of its proper functlons.
What partlculnrly angers' certain
benators Is the tone of the European
press, whlch has referred to theso
notes as a treaty and has congratulat
ed the President on havlng found a
way to be Independent of tbe henate
on the condiut of rorelgn relations. Tho
senate ls jealous of all Its prerogatlves
and does not like lo have foreign gov
emments thlnk the President can ne
gotiale withont regard to Its actlon.
The question Is regarded aa an ex
treniely imporlant one from a constl
tutlonal polnt of vlew, and If the Dem
ocrats succeed in getting lt before the
tenate lt wlll undoubtedly provoke a
debate that will becomo hlstorlcai.

Stand for Something
Do Jot Play a False Part
By Dr. O.
J1H gr. atesi thing tbat can be said of a man, no niatter how
uiiich he has uchieved, is Ihat he hus kept his roooid cleuu.
Why is it that, in apile of tho ravagos of tlnio, the ivpii'a
tion ot Lincoln growt, hirger and hls character nieans more
to tl)t world every year? It Is hecause he Uept his lecoid
clean, and never p'ro'stltuted hls ublllty nor gauihled with hls
repututlou.
Where, ln all hlstory, is there an example of a man wbo
waa inerelv rich. no niatter how greni his wealtb, who ex-
ertrd siuh a power for good, who has been siu h a llvlng roiue In civlll.atloti
as this poor backwoods boy? What a powerlul lllusirallon of the fact that
chaiaclor ls tlie gre'ater forcv in Ihe world!
A itinu assuines importanci and bceomes a jiower ln the world Just as
soon as It ls found that he stands for souiuthlng; that he U not for sale; tbut
he wlll not lease hls manhood for salary, or for any ainount of monoy, or for
any iniltiunco or posltlon; ihat he vlll iiol 1. nd hls uanio to "unythlug whuh
he cannot indorse.
The Irouble with so many today is that they do not stand for anjlblng out
sldo thulr voentlon. The niay be well educated, wtll Up Iu thelr t.peiialtlea,
may have a lot of oxpm Unowledge. bul they laiuioi be depended uiHin.
There ls some tlaw iu theni whlch taKes the odge off thelr vlitue. They may
be talrly honest, but you cannot bauk ou theni.
It is not dlllicult lo llnd a laver or a physiclan who knows a gfiod deal,
who is euilnent in hla profession; but lt ls not so easy to tlnd one who Ih a
man before ho is a lawyer or a physlcian, whose name ls a synonym for all
that is clean, rellable, solld, aubstantlal. lt is not dlfllcnlt to llnd a good
preacher; but lt ls not so ensy lo tlnd a roal man, sterllug mnnhood, back ot
tho sernion. lt is eusy to tlnd successful merchants, but not so oasy to tlnd
men who put character above merchandlse. What the world wants is meu
who have prinilple unilerlying thelr oxpertnpsa, princlple under thelr law,
thelr mediciiie, thelr business; men who stand for somethlng ln tbelr cotu
nuinlty, whose very pieseme carrles welght.
Everywhero we see sniait, clever, loug-headed, shrewd men, but how
comparatlvely rare it Is lo tlnd ono whose leeord i. as clean as a houud's
tooth, who wlll not swerve from the rlght, who would rather fall tbau be a
party to a questiouable traiisaoliou.
Everywhere we see liustness men putling the stuinhliiiK-blocks of decep
llon and dlshonest ineiliods. righl acrots tbelr own palhway, tilpplng them
selves up whlle tiylng lo decelve others.
We see men witli inlllions of dollnrs fllled wltb terror, tretubllng lest In
vestlgatlona may uncover thiugs whlch wlll diinin Iheui In Ihe publie estlma
tlon! We see them cowed before the law like whlpped spanlela. catchlng at
any straw thut wlll save them fiom publlc dlsgrace!
What a terrlbte thlng to llve ln the Umellght of popnlar favor. to be en
vied as rich and powerful, to be esteumed as honornhle aud stralghtforward,
and yot to be consolous all the time of not belng wbat the world thlnks we
are, to llve in constant terror of discovery, in fear that soinethlng may hap
pen to unmask us and show us up ln our true llght! Bul nothlng can hap
pen to iiijure serlonsly the man who lives four-square to the world, who has
nothlng to c.over up, nothlng lo bide fiom hls fellowaf who lives a tranapareut
clean llfe, with never a fear of dlsclosures. If all of hls materlal poseesslona
are swept away from hlm, he knows Ihat he has a uionumcnl in tbe hearts
of his coiiiitrnien, Iu the affeclion aud admiration of the people, and Ibal uotli
Iiik can happen to harm hls real t,elf hecause lie has kept hls recoid i-leau.

A Preiiy Siory of a
Seal ?
Ey J. G.
O' N 1880 there lived at
N. I!., a rt-uiai kahle old sea caplain, who possessed an ex
traordinary power In tainlng wilif" blrds and aniinals. A
frlend In pMlubnrgh, wlio kiiew hlm, stuted that the old gen
tlemaii was usiially to he seen walklng down tbe village
streets folloued by a flock of caiiarltts, whlch accompanled
hlm in liia short peregrinatfons ln tbe nelghborbood of hla
house. One day some flsbermeti turprised a half-grown
cotcjiien seal iu tbe miid tlals, and took it lo thu spa captalu
I
who soon trained il with snch success that the poor creature became a per
fect niilsance.
Tlie seal would go eve.-y moruiug into tbe estuary and bunt for flsh and
then make its wu h me over the lnud up lo the house, at the door of whlch
It would knock w pusli wltb its foie-fllppers. Its, fuvorlte restlng place was
the druwing-room sofu. The dally arrival or mud and wet luto the best parlor
wus soon too much for the good captaln'a tidy wlfe, so tbe day cauie at last
when he leluctantb pronilsed lo get rid of the beast in the most humane
fashiou.
A boat was hlred; the captain and his pet sailtd away far out to sea oft
Portobello, where the man bade farewell to the seal. whlch apparently had not
tho smallest Intention of saylng good-by to hlm. The seal swam around th
boat a few tlmes and then dlved, and tho klud-hearted old sea dog sadly
turnod hls boat's lieud ln meward, convlnced that he would never see hls am
phlblous frlend ugaln. A snrprise, however, was In store, for when ho opened
hls cottage door lt was to hear his wife's voice ralsed ln anger; there was
tho seal on the dr&wiug-iooin sufa ouce agalu, sate and sound, and looklng up
ieproachfully with hls Innocent black eyes.
