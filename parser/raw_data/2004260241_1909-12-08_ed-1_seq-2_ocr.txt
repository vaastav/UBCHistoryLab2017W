THE MESSAGE
President Taft's message to
Congress submitted and read
yesterday is more brief than
those submitted by his prede
cessor, and it might well have
been briefer still, so far as Con
! gress is concerned. As a cam
paign document the presidental
message is worth the time spent
on it. but Congress pays about
as much attention as the Cor
vallis city council did to Mayor
Watters' special message in re
gard to salaries raised by that
Council. Congress is concerned
with the president when there is
'' a strong probability of him
vetoing some pet measure, but
at no other time. The presi
dent's message is of chief service
' in assuring the public that some
fellow with a chip on his shoulder
.is still on the job.'
j The most significant utterance
in Pres. Taft's message is in re
. ference to courts and ; legal pro
ceedure. He says a haze of
technicality both delays and de
feats . iustice and - encourages
criminality: Mr.- Taf t says; bur
judicial system is "archaic and
barbarous." Those who know
all about it will agree heartily
With this, and the fellow who
knows nothing about it the fel
low who hasonly a proper con
ception of right and . wrong
Will agree even more . heartily.
. The next most ; worthy . sug
gestion is an insistence ' upon a
bereau of health. We are con
stantly concerned with dollars
and cents and yet health is the
greatest wealth. A government
bureau can not make a sick man
well, but it can give . expert at
tention to the great ; questions
. affecting the. public's health and
be instrumental in bettering gen
eral conditions and perhaps pr-
" ' venting occasional local epidemics
that take a large toll. :;. ---:
President Taft declares in
favor of postal savings banks and
ship subsidies, both of which are
J good.' No nation "can grow: un
less it saves, no nation can grow
' Satisfactorily "unless its ' com
merce is expanded.1 No nation
Will save large sums until' its
citizens can save : in small
amounts. - The Postal - Savings
" banks will offer the opportunity,
and a perfect guarantee to those
with . large ..sums who will not
t, bank. Our commerce is not ex
panding, there are comparatively
' few American ships on the high
"!seas. A ship subsidy or a
merchant marine might relieve
the present difficulty. ' It could
not make the situation worse.
, t The recommendation that per
; : locuciais ana magazines pay a
higher ratevof postage is question-
1 able. Doubtless the ' magazines
r can stand it, but why not cut out
J some of the unnecessary postal
;; expense rather than make ran
extra levy any wLerfe? A dozen
letters and a hunlreM pounds of
reports each year ' (feme to this
office from government depart
ments. Other p&wsparar offices
in the U. S. and ' th$e are 21,-000-are
treated similafifly. This
office . has use for lews than
one one-hundreth partypf his
junk and'only the larger Irofnces

The President would stop the
"white slave" traffic and" asks
$50,000 for a campaign to stop
the recruiting - from among the
immigrants. TheS government
can afford $5,000,000 for this
purpose. ' v.
"The -message closes with a
word of cheer, and an as
surance that there is just now
beginning a great business ex
pansion. The president mentions
the high cost of living, (the great
increase in the cost,) and attri
butes it to the proportionate in
crease of gold, increase of popu
lation, more . expensive mode of
living and the lack of increased
acreage production. - .-. f
. Pres. Taft's massage is mild,
not uncertain, but scarcely over
emphatic. - His "judicial temper
ament" shows in every line ' and
the impression the message
makes depends on. one's con
ception of judges. ;; It is our
distinct impression that it was
the president's aim to say no
thing that would arouse Congress
to criticism or that the American
people could construe as 'play
ing to the. galleries." As a re
sult the message is tamei ' com
pared . with his predecessor's,
but doubtless as v effective,, for
none of them count with Con
gress.'?,. ;. N . : .; " :jy v.; ':-,.; -,'

King' Leopold is reported as
having suffered paralysis of the

mendous and" awful atrocities in
the Congo are even partially cor
rect, Belgium's royal potentate
has had paralysis of the; con

If he had those helpless Congo

Leopold should never die from

up in small bits, a finger : being
