The Farmers Leader
By A. E. LINN.
-Xember South Dakota PreaB Association.-
That portion of President McKinley's
message relating to the money ques
tion is a repetition of previous recom
mendations on that subject, and a re
flection—so far as it dare be—of the
views of the Indianapolis monetary
convention. In brief the president's
recommendations on this line are fairly
answered by the currency bill pre
pared by the republican committee for
presentation to the house. The estab
lishment of the single gold standard,
the surrender to the banks of the. con
trol over the volume of the currency,
the practial retirment of the greenbacks
the authority in the secretary of the
treasury to issue gold bonds at hi8
pleasure—These represent the purposes
and the policies of the administration
with respect to the finances of the
nation. The president approaches the
question of trusts very gingerly, and
when he has taken up that important
question he drops it without having
anid anything. Having wasted a great
many words in the successful effort to.
avoid the trust question the president
concludes with this "recommenda
tion:"
It is to be hoped that such uni
formity, founded in a wise and just
discrimination between what is in
jurious and what is useful and
necessary in business operations,
may be obtained, and that means
may be found for the congress
within the limitations of its consti
tutional power so to supplant an af
fective code of state legislation as
to make a complete system of laws
throughout the United States ade
quate to compel a general obser
vance of the salutary rules to which
I have referred.
"As clear as mud" is the best de
scription of this meaningless bit of
rhetoric. The president touches lightly
on the subject of the Transvaal war.
Be refers to "impartiality of this gov
ernment toward both the combatants."
He neglects to explain, however, the
inconsistency of this statement when
coupled with the reports of the speeches
recently deliyered by our minister to
England, Mr. Choate, from which it is
apparent that there is not, after all, so
large a measure of impartiality. On
the subject of Cuba the president de
clares that the pledge for independence
must be faithfully kept. Then he pro
ceeds to present reasons why the ful
fillment of that pledge must by delayed.
Concerning the Philippines tbe presi
dent boldly announces that independ
ence is not to be thought of. He says
the future of those islands rests with
congress, and then he proceeds to pre
sent reasons why congress should take
no action on the. subject. The presi
dent's message is well described by the
sentence "a plea for gold and empire."
It provides confirmation for the charge
that imperialism is the administration's
policy, and it completely shatters the
hopes expressed by many republicans
that ihe administration would not
oommit itself to an un-American policy.
The American people who fa", a
••conquest of the PhilinpiT"5 Islamic and
,/the substitution ot i_iupuo the
republic of the fathers, and call it ex
pansion, are the laughing stock of in
telligent men throughout the world.
All fully developed men know that the
American forces are in the Philippine
Islands for the purpose of advancing
the interest of an American syndicate
who have formed a co-partnership with
a British syndicate to build railroads
in China. If this syndicate should
abandon its
purposes in China we would
soon find a way to give the Philippines
'their independence. A powerful syn
dicate of multi-millionaires, less than
fifty in number, are controlling the
administration, and forcing the over
throw of the republic and the establish
ment of an imperial government. Ex
pansion as understood, advocated and
practiced in America under Jefferson,
Monroe and other means the acquisition
of lands upon which to build American
homes, and out of which to construct
new commonwealths. To invade over
populated Asia is not expansion. It is
madness.
Bussel Sage recently said that Sec
retary Gage's purchase of 125,000,000
worth of bonds saved the financial
world from a disastrous panic. Upon
what a magnificent foundation our
financial system must be builded when,
in the midst of' 'unparalleled prosperty,'
little prop of $25,000,000 is necessary
to hold it up.
Mr. McKinley now has congress on
his hands, and congress has Mr. Roberts
on its hands, and Mr. Roberts has three
wives on his hands. This seems to be
a great time for hand, outs.
Methuen will not be able to whip any
considerable number of Boers until the
British censor quits killing them by
cable and allows a few live ones to
wander about.
IB may be that Buller is waiting for
Bore Boers to ike the field, the censors
hiving killed off the first installment.
WON'T TELL THE TRUTH.
More Time Given to Misrepresenta
tion Than to Helping
Soldiers.
Dakota Ruralist, Aberdeen: The re
publicans seem never so happy as when
lying about Governor Lee. By con
temptible tactics they captured the
Huron meeting, called to arrange for
the return of the First regiment, and
made all the committees almost solidly
republican. Then fearing they could
not raise the required funds they asked
the governor to call a special session
of the legislature, which he very prop
erly refused to do. The money was
raised by the county boards, all parties
working harmoniously, the xqoney be
ing turned over to the republican com
mittee, as a sacred trust. The only
hitch that occurred was where the
funds of two or three southern coun
ties" got tied up in a republican bank,
which has since failed. From the time
money was raised the whole affair was
grossly mismanaged. No contract was
made till the regiment was mustered
out and the boys were kept at their own
expense at San Francisco after being
mustered out. They were sent home
without any arrangements for feeding
en route, so that the actual cost to
many of the boys was more than if
they had paid their own fare. Further
more a part of the baggage was lost en
route. This mismanagement was vdue
mainly to Chairman Frank Brown.
And now Mr. Brown has the nerve to
tell returned soldiers that the commit
tee is out of funds and that one reason
of this is that Governor Lee subscribed
$600 which he refused to pay!
When it was proposed to call the
legislature together, Governor Lee
said if the money was raised by sub
scription he would head the list with
|500. Following is the correspondence:
"Sioux Falls, S. D., Aug. 25, 1899.—
Hon. Andrew E. Lee, Governor of
South Dakota, Vermillion, S. D.: Hav
ing issued the call for the Huron con
vention parties through the state are
urging us to unite in a request to you
to call a special sesion of the legisla
ture to appropriate funds to meet nec
essary expenses in bringing our regi
ment home. We earnestly request such
action and in so doing we believe we
voice the wish of the people of our
state. —H. H. KEISH,
President Business Men's League.
—Geo. Schlosser, Secretary."
"Vermillion, S. D., Aug. 25,1899. H.
H. Keith, President Business Men's
League, Sioux Falls, S. D.: There are
several things to be considered in call
ing a special session. First is there
an actual necessity that would warrant
calling it second,is there sufficient time
also, can the legislature legally ap
propriate money for this purpose.
These questions must be determined
first. My opinion is that the necessity
for calling a special session does not
exist. There are two way open to raise
this money quickly. One that men in
each county guarantee amounts in pro
portion to population of the' county.
The other to raise it by general sub
scription. I will give five hundred dol
lars if the remainder" can be raised
without calling a special session. Will
guarantee our proportion from this
county. —ANDREW E. LEE."
The funds were not raised by sub
scription and Clay county gave her full
proportion.
Futhermore, when two returning
soldiers applied to Mr. Frank Brown
for a re-fund of fare paid by them
selves, it was telegraphed from this
city, presumably on the authority of
Mr. Brown, that he had arranged for a
half-fare rate for invalid soldiers and
this arrangement had been cancelled by
the governor. This arrangement was
not made by Mr. Brown but by the
governor and has not been cancelled by
anybody, and the correspondence prov
ing this was in the hands of Mr. Brown
at the very time the lying dispatches
were sent out from this city. If Mr.
Brown did not authorize the dispatch
es, he should have been man enough,
when he had the correspondence in his
own hands, to correct them. He and
his committee have wasted $7,000 of
the tax payers' money to make a show
for McKinley and possibly hope to es
cape criticism by lying about the gov
ernor.
When the governor was in San Fran
cisco the Red Cross society proposed to
him to send home at half rates tbe
boys who were left behind in the hos
pital after the departure of the regi
ment. The offer was accepted as will
be seen from the following letter
written by the governor at 'Frisco:
"San Francisco, Cal., September,
1899.—Mrs. F. G. Sanborn, Chairman
Transportation Committee. Dear Mad
am- You are hereby authorized to
provide transportation for all soldiers
of the First South Dokota Infantry, U.
S. Volunteers, who may be discharged
from hospitals after the departure of
the regiment for South Dakota. I will
guarantee the expenditures necessary
and incidental to the point of enlist
ment. Personally and on behalf of the
members of the regiment I beg leave
to extend to you and the ladies who
have so devotedly interested them
selves in the welfare of the soldiers,
our appreciation and thanks for their
noble efiorts. Very respectfully,
—"ANDREW B. LEE,
"Governor of South Dakota."
It clearly appears from this that the
governor instructed the Red Cross peo
ple to send sick soldiers home at the
half rate and that he personally guar
anteed the society against loss on that
account.
Concerning the discharged soldier
who paid full fare the following letter
from Mrs. Sanborn fully explains
*«San Francisco, Cal., Sept. 19, 1896.
Hon. Andrew E. Lee, Governor of
South Dakota. Dear Sir: Wm. G.
Stewart, discharged from the First
south Dakota Vols., came to us for re
duced rate for transportation. This
was before we had secured our present
rate, and hoping we might be able to
do something for him in the way of re
duced transportation he waited a few
days, visiting some friends at Penryn,
California. From there he wrote me
and as I did not get the letter prompt
ly he purchased at Sacramento a sec
ond class ticket to Sioux City for $40.
He will ask you to refund him this
amount, and as he is a poor lad in
broken health, I am happy to know
that you will see that South Dakota re
imburses him. His discharge paper
will not bear the railroad stamp that
is placed on tickets and discharges
when soldiers' transportation is pur
chased in the S. P. office here. But
knowing all the circumstances we will
guarantee that he paid $40 for his tick
et. Hoping to be of substantial service
to the boys you are leaving behind in
the hospital, yours veay truly,
—MRS. F. G. SANBORN."
We have waited before opening up
this matter hoping Mr. Brown would
disavow the lies that have been told in
his name, but he does not appear $o
have the manhood to do it.
But the boys will be taken care of
and all the funds advanced by the Red
Cross will be refunded, no matter if
Mr. Brown's committee is bankrupt.
