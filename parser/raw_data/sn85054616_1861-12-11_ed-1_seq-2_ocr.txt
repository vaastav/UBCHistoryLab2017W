THE MESSAGE WHAT IS SAID OF IT.
The Now York Times says: "President's
Llncoln'sMessage is precisely such a document
as any one familiar with his character would
have anticipated. ' It is clear, unpretending,
frank and perfectly loyal to the declaration
and acts ot his whole political lire. - In regard
to tho question of slavery, President Lincoln
rpcaks with firmness, but marked and con
scientious moderation." With regard to the
negroes whom the progress of the war sets
free and throws upon our hands, ho suggests
the propriety of providing for their colonization
and also of accepting such slaves as mny be
freed by State action in lieu pro lanlo of direct
taxes. We apprehend that tho project of
colonizing the negroes will be' found open to
more objections thaa occur at first sight. They
will be imperatively needed to cultivate the
soil, and tha expense of the scheme would be
beyond any direct benefits to be expected from
fci We think the Government will And it
necessary to establish for them some effective
police government here, at home, and retaining
their labor instead of sending them out of the
country." ' ' '
, The Chicago Tribune intorprcts the Mes
sage by what it knows of the opinions of the
President, rather than by what it says : "The
cautious language which Mr. Lincoln employs,
does not Lido from us, who know tho deep
moral convictions of the man, the purpose that
he has in view. lie has come, if not fully up
to our advanced position, at least within easy
hail of those who have been looking anxiously
back to see what progress We would make.
Congress will take him at bis word. The
members of that body, if we may Judge by
what has transpired already, will interpret his
measing in a way with which we esven shall be
contest. We know not what form their legis
lation will take ; but of this we are assured,
and the Message is a warrant for what we say,
that in the deliberate action of the Represen
tatives of the People, the President will gladly
acquiesce.".
The Delaware County,Pa., Republican, say s s
The Message of President Lincoln to Con
gress is of readable length, no synopsis of it
Js requisite. It is written plainly, and is de
void of that verbiage usually found in docu
ments emanating from high public functiona
ries. The President says just what he means,
and is eminently conservative too much so,
we think in bis recommendations to Congress.
The declaration, however, in the message that
'The Union must be preserved, and hence all
indispensable means mnst be employed," is a
sufficient guarantee to the people that the
power of the Government will be used to that
end. On the subject of our foreign relations
the President leaves no room to doubt the
policy that will govern the Administration, so
far as England Is concerned. The message
meets with general approval."
The New York Commercial is warm in its
praises : "This admirable document is all that
could be expected from the frank, straight
forward and honest pen of the President. It
is Abraham Lincoln in every line ingenuous,
direct, unqualified, cautious, thorough and
loyal to the very core not merely loyal to
the Srs and Stripes, but loyal to the most
sacred principles of the Constitution. It is
the work of a clear-headed man, sensible of
the gravity f the time, and responsive to the
vast burden of trust devolved upon him."
' ! Tho New York World is dolighfed with the
Messaso. It says: "It probably suffers some-
'what from its hasty transmission by telegraph,
but its language is clear, terse and intelligible,
and it is free from tho wearisome j ro'ixify which
'has heretofore made Presidents' messages so
heavy. Tho President assigns to the subject
of slavery its propper rank and subordination
among the questions relating to tho manage
meet of the war. It is not, in his estimation,
a great question, but a minor question."
The New York Herald is delighted. It says :
"The first regular annual Messago of President
Lincoln to the two houses of Congress is do
fore our readers. They will, find it a plain,
concise, unpretending, business-like exposi
tion of our foreign and domestic affairs, and
the reader will lay it down, satisfied from its
intrinsic evidences that the author of this
State pancr is fully entitled to bis familiar
designation of "Honest Abe Lincoln."
In going to war with this country, England
would lose .two-fifths of her exports sho would
lose our breadstuGs, the provisions to feed her,
and our cotton, as heretofore, to cloth her
She would lose the $23,000,000 per annum of
revenue which she derives mainly from our
tobacco. Her revenue would be reduced one
half her own expenditures would bo unable
to pay $130,000,000 per annum as the interest
on the public debt, and at the same time sup
port her government and war expenditures
JShe would encountor revolution from her
starving raillions.and her existing Government
would, be swept into oblivion.
Kansas has 6,000 men in the service of tho
Goveraiueat. The male adult population of
the State capable of bearing arms, reaches
only 25,000. - This shows one man out of every
four in the volunteer service. In addition to
- tbis.the militia has been called out at different
points and nsed for defense. Recruiting is
going on actively. Of the G.000 men m ser
viee, more than one-half of them are in Mis
souri. Of the remainder but a small proportion
aro yet effectively equipped. ,

"RING OF THE TBUE METAL."
Letter of Eon. John Campbell, of Philadelphia,
to Col. Charles J. Biddle.
Philadelphia, November 29, 18G1. .
Sir: My attention has been directed to a
letter of yours, which appeared in yesterday's
Inquirer, and, as anything which cminates from
your pen must interest me, I took especial
pains in reading it to comprehend its scope of
meaning. I confess thatl was much astonish
ed at its contents, although 1 thought I had
schooled myself not to be surprised at any po
litical occurrence whatever. Your Intercourse
and mine has always been kind and friendly ;
itcannot, therefore, bo said that this reply to
your letter is dictated by. either ingratitude or
envy. I stood by you, and led your forlorn
hope in the convention before which you were
a candidate for mayor. We voted for you
against what I then considered a most infamous
political combination. You were defeated for
the nomination. You know how sore I felt at
the result; yet ther5 was no office in your
gift, if elected mayor of our city, that I would
accept from you. . When you were nominated
for Congress, no man felt more rejoiced than I.
The Press newspaper doubted your sincerity
to support the Administration, 1 took a dif
ferent view, and, 1 believe, to a ceraiu extent,
influenced Col. Forney to deal leniently to
wards you at all events, I wrote to him, re
monstrating against" any attack upon you.
Knowing, as I do, Col. Forney's generous na
ture, and his desire to oblige his friends, he
refrained from being severe upon you. I am
certain that my anxiety to have you elected to
Congress had its weight with almost every
person engaged upon The Press. But I did
more, for five successive eveuings after your
Domination, I closed ray place of business
earlier than usual, and travelled the district,
beseeching and imploring Douglass Democrats
to vote for . you, pledging my word that you
would be found, upon the floor of Congress, a
staunch supporter of the Government. I re
gret to say, judging from the tenor of your let
ter, that I was mistaken.. One gentleman
alone, to oblige me, went to unusual trouble,
and got for you twenty-eight votes, besides
his own, allot whom usually voto against the
Democratic party.
I say to you clearly, and distinctly, that you
could not have been elected but for my exer
tions. I say this in no exulting spirit, but
merely to prove that 1 have been j-our warm,
devoted, unselfish friend. I now proceed to
analize your letter, and to me it is a painful
and disazrccahlo task, but I deem it to bo
a duty that I owe to such citizens as were in
fluenced by my representations to vote for
you. If I mistake not, every citizen to whom
your letter is addressed has deen a Breckin
ridge Democrat, except the Hon. A. V. Par
sons.. The Hon. George M. Dallas has been
absent from the country, and I have been in
formed that Mr. Fraley. has repudiated your
sentiments. It appears plain to me that you
have chosen to identify yourself with the
Brcckintidgo school of politicians, and if so,
you will have, for weal or for woe, to abide
the eonsequences. In your letter ofyesterday
you say :
"My political opinions are what they have
f always been. I am a Democrat never more
" one than at tins hour. I rejoice that it was
" with ray name upon your ba nncrs that you
" overthrew the Republican party in this city."
Contrast this with the following :
"Camp Mason asd Dixox's Line, Beyond 1
"Centrcvillo,via Bedford, Pa.,Juno 29 '01. J
"IIos. A. V. Parsons: Tho nomination
" takes ine wholly by surprise. I thank you
" all for this great and unsolicited honor. I
" am, I trust, a true son of Pennsylvania,
ready to serve her when and where and how
" sho pleases, my present position is most
" congonial tome; but I will not place my
" preference In - opposition to the people's
wish. If elected, 1 will serve as soon as I
" can quit the field without dishonor. Phila
" delphia would not expect me sooner. 1 will
" give no partisan pledges. I w ill try to do my
" duty in whatever sphere it may please God
to place me. Cuarles J. Bidple."
Were you less a Democrat in June last than
yor are now, or was it a trick to secure our as
sistance ? Some causes in the interim must
have wrought a wonderful change in your opin
ions. In June you had no partisan pledges to
give ; in November your partisanship is more
offensive than that of even John C. Breckin
ridge. Again you say :
'This, at least," we may say for the Demo-
cratic party it rated at its true value the
" fantastic theories, the whimsies, the "isms,"
" the questions of mere phraseology, that men
calling themselves statesmen, have preferred
" to peace, to union, to the gradual progress
" and development of each section and all
" races, in duo relation to natural causes.
This, too, wo may say lor the Democratic
"party while it maintained its sway, Se-
" cession' was a little, baffled clique ; as the
" Republican party rose, Secession' became
" an army with banners.' "
The Democratic party 'was my party so long
as it stood by the Union and Constitution.
But whenever any party dares to revolutionize
the Government and destroy the Constitution
by armed violence it is time for every loyal
citizen to escape from such a party. I cannot
suppose that you are either ignorant or for
getful of the political transactions of the last
year. I will not suppose that you do not
know that the Southern leaders of the Democ
racy at Charleston ard at Baltimore, aided aud
abetted by Northern cravens and ollice-scck-ers.
not only refused to support for nomina
tion the only statesman that could havo b en
elected President by the Democracy, but, un
der the guidance of Breckinridge, Davis, Yan
cey, and other conspirators, had resolved "to
fire the Southern heart and precipitate the
Cotton States into revolution." I need not
inform you that, to gratify the South, Con
gress was for a tariff; again to gratify her it
was for free trade ; again to gratify her it pass
ed a fugitive slave law : But why recapitulate?
Exaction after exaction was made against the
North until further endurance would have made
slaves of us, the free white citizens thereof-
I need not say to you that the Douglas plat
form was the fairest proposition that could
have baen offered to the South ; nor need I
inform you that the leaders of the Democracy in
that section, and their conferees in iniquity and
treason in this, spurned his constitutional offer.
That the Democratic party has dono great good
in the halcayon days of its power none can de
ny : but when it departed from its high and
holy mission ; when, its leaders became traitors
to its principles and doctrines ; when they ap
pealed from the will of the people constitution
ally expressed through the ballot box, to foul trea
son and unnatural rebellion, it became the
duty of every loyal Democrat to pause and
consider if ho were willing to be dragged to
political perdition, ofjf he should array him
self on tho side of the Government. You say
that "Secession was a little baffled clique so
long as the Democracy was in power." Well,
why not ? Nearly every prominent Secession
ist South was in office, and almost all their
friends North were well provided for, but so
toon as it became a certainty that power was
about to depart from the Democracy its leaders
raised their black and bloody flag to destroy the
best system of government that was ever
lounded by the ingenuity of ' man. I know
that you know all this as well as I do, and I
can only attribute to you tho sentiments ex
pressed in jour letter to your intimate ac
quaintance and connection with the particular
school of Democratic politicians who surround
you. ,
You again say :
"When the national flag was struck down at
" Charleston, and the national capitol was
" threatened by Secession, the North rose like
" one man. The w orld saw with astonishment
" the great uprising ; of the people; Europe
" prejudged the issue in our favor; yet, as if
" smitten with blindness, the Republican lead
" ers seemed striving to waste and dissipate,
" instead of to seize and hsc, the noble mate
" rial for great armies which was, with scarce
" ly any limit, placed at their disposal. The
" soldier who offered himself for the public
" service found that he must ear-wig some
politician before he could be Hllowed the
" priviledge to fight or die for his country.
Men began to say that the war was to be
.." mado'a Black Republican job.'
Well "when the American flag was struck
down at Charleston and the national capital was
threatened by Secession." Who struck down
tho flag ? Certainly not Black Republicans,
but the leaders of the Democracy the leaders
of your party and mine. Can this be denied ?
You ns well as I know that we were taken
aback; that but for the universal upheaving
of the freo States Washington would to-day be
in the possession of the leaders of tho Democ
racy, l'ou and J know that under Democratic
President Buchanan, Democratic Secretary
Cobb robbed tho treasury. Democratic Secre
tary Floj-d robbed the arsenals, Democratic
Secretary Secretary Toucy scattered our fleet ;
you and I know that Democratic Senators Da
vis, Slidell, &c, assisted them in their vil
lainies that Democratic Vice-Presid't Breck
inridge was the pivot of treason. ITou know,
or' ought to know, that Democratic Senators,
and Democratic members of Congress, and Dem
ocratic leaden in the North sympathized with
these traitors ; you know, or ought to know,
that if Secessionists were as strong North as
it has been South, that a man like me would
not get leave to live. Andy Johnson and Par
son Brownlow aro hunted like wild beasts for
defending the Government. Is it not curions
that the vials of jour wrath are poured out up
on the heads of tho Republican leaders, while
you can scarcely spare even a drop for those
who are now in arms against the Government ?
Yon state that "men say that the war is to be
a Black Republican job ?" Pray sir, who are
these men t Let us know by all means who
they are. Yu further state :
"A general, born here among us, restored
to their due supremacy the martial virtues
" that insure success in war ; trained and com
" petant officers second his efforts, scores of
" imoiciles have been pushed out of service,
and this good work still progresses. The
Democratic party will sustain the men the
" McClellans and Duponts who have in
charge the honor of our flag on land and sea.
" Let, everywhere, the people put in oilice
men who will not see the war again become
" a party job;' let the administration of the
" Government be such us to attract, not repel,
" the doubtful States."
Who placed McCIellan and Dupont in their
respective commands 1 Did not the present
Cabinet gladly avail itself of the services of
both these distinguished citizens 1 "The
Democratic party will sustain the men Mc
Clellans and Duponts." Such is your ex
pression. Of course they will, jus; so leng
as the McClellans and Duponts sustain the
Government. The Demncratic party of the
Free States those gallant men who rallied to
the standard ol the lamented Douglas, in 18G0
are true to the Government and to the laws,
and so is the majority of those who voted for
the arch-traitor Breckinridge. Only the mis
erable drivellers who cannot read the signs of
the times are disloyal ; a broken down clique,
which clings to the phantom of power. There
is not a disloyal man to-day, in the Free Stales,
who has not been a Breckinridge Democrat.
My dear sir, every such letter as yours gives
encouragement to the rebels, and induces them
to prolong tho struggle.
1 agree with you in your denunciation of
corruption and incompetency, but you ought
to have been specific ; you should be particu
lar and give to the public the benefit of your
own knowledge ;you should let us know who
are the villains who aro perpetrating the
crimes which you so eloquently portray. It is
not fair to leave us in the dark ; we should be
forewarned againSt these bad men. To retain
this knowledge in your own heart, without in
forming your fellow-citizens who the catitfs
are to whom you allude, is hardly treating us
justly. You create suspicion ; for, if wo aro
not cognizant of the names of tho guilty par
tics, how are we to guard against the rascals
you so feelingly describe ? Above all things,
let us have blazned to the face of the world
tho names of as many of the villains as you
know. I am no advocate of Black Republi
canism ; I do not approve of incompetent offi
cers being appointed in the army ; but, taking
every circumstance into consideration, the
wonder is that an unarmed people has done so
much. If the war bocomes a Black Republi
can Job, wo ought not to forget that Democrat-'
ic traitors forced uuon ns the issue : we ouzht
not to forget that Lyon and Greble, and Baker
andlilsworth none of whom were Democrats
havo given their lives to the Union ; we
ought not to forget that the Government pla
ces its trnst in the McClellans, and Duponts,
and iiutlers, wno are Democrats.
I have thrown my thoughts together hastily,
In the hope that in Congress you will lend a
cordial and hearty support to the Administra
tion ; that you will use your own sound sense,
uninfluenced by any of your Breckinridge ac
quaintances. "1 here is a glorious futuro be
lore you. You are yet a young man ; rely
upon tho people, and the mighty power of
truth ; assist to crush out treason and this foul
rebellion ; do this in no querulous ot caviling
spirit, and no man will try more ardently for
your futuro political advancement than your
humble servant, Joun Campbell.
Rebel Foreign Policy. Tho Charleston
Mercury, of Oct. 2G, has au elaborate article
of the foreign policy of sccessiondom. It
says that three Commissioners were at first
appointed, to England, France, Russia and
Jielgium which was a mistake as one man
would have done just as well. Now two more
are added and the countries specified, and
they are supplied with Secretaries. The Mer
cury docs not have much confidence in this
arrangement, though it thinks that Messrs.
Mason and Slidell have "eminant social fitness
for their respective posts," and it expects
worthy things from them ! But its principal
idea is that the recognition of the Southern
Confederacy will come naturally by its exhibi
tion of de facto Independence, and that any
attempt to hurry up this result by negotiation,
involves the offer of a consideration, an in
ducement, which will-implicate future rela
tions. The article thus seems to confirm the
rumors which come from Europe respecting
the tender of some consideration which was to
have been made by Mr. Slidell, as the prico of
recognition. . .
. Some ton days since, whilst John Madden
was engaged about theEgleton Coal Company's
wharf opposite Farrandsville, he accidently
fell and struck his head against a stick of
timber, with such forco as to cause his death
immediately.
It is reported that several steamers have
been insured in London for a run lroni Ene-4
land to New Orleans.
FE0M CONGRESS.
Mr. Trnmbull or. Thursday, introduced into
the Senate his bill for confiscating rebels'
property, and setting slaves free. This bill
he advocated in a speech. It provides for the
absolute and complete forfeiture to the Uni
ted States ot every species of property belong
ing to persons who, during the existence of
the present rebellion, shall take up arms
against the United States. This forfeiture Is
to be enforced against property in the rebel
lious districts, through the military power,
and against property in other portions ot the
United States, where the judicial power is not
obstructed by the rebellion, though the
Courts, and the proceeds of the property of
each individual seized and forfeited is to be
subject to the just claims of loyal creditors,
to bo held for the benefit of loyal citizens de
spoiled of property by the rebellion, and to
defray the expenses incurred iu its suppres
sion. The bill also forfeits the claims of all
rebels and those who give them aid and comfort
to the persons they hold in Slavery. The bill
declares that slaves thus forfeited 9hall be free,
and makes it tho duty of the President to pro
vide for the colonization of such as may be
willing to go to some tropical country where
they may have the protection of the Govern
ment, aud be secured iu all the rights and
privileges of freemen.
In the Senate on the 4th, Mr. Wiisoa intro
duced a resolution inquiring into the case of
certain colored persous confined in the jail at
Washington. Thereupon ensued a debate
concerning the administration of justico In
the Distiict of Columbia. Upon this topic
Mr. Hale was very severe. The Marshal of
the District was directed to report at once to
the Senate the names of all persons now con
fined in the jail at Washington, tho causes of
their confinment, the names of the magistrates
who committed them, the length of their im
prisonment, and the names of the original
complaints. ;
. In the House of Representatives on Thurs
day, a resolution was adopted directing the
Committee on the Judiciary to inquire wheth
er a telegraphic censorship on the press has
been established in Washington, and, if so, by
whose authority, and by whom it is now con
trolled ; then to report if such censorship has
not been used to restrain wholesome political
criticism and discussion, while its professed
object was to withhold from the enemy infor
mation of army movements..
Mr. Saulsbury ol Delaware on the 4th caused
some amusement in the Senate by offering a
resolution to appoint Messrs. Fillmore, Ever
ett, Dallas, Taney, and some others, a Com
mission on the part of the North to meet a
similarly-constituted Commission from the
South, and bring the war at once to a satisfac
tory termination. After the. Senate- bad
laughed at the resolution it was brushed aside.
In the House on the 4th, Mr. Hutchins of
Ohio introduced a resolution similar to that
offered in the Senate by Mr. Wilson, directing
the Committee for the District of Columbia to
inquire concerning forty-five slaves said to be
at present confined in the jail at Washington,
to discover by what authority they are impris
oned, and to take measures for their release,
and lor the pieventation of such imprisonment
hereafter.
Mr. Cox of Ohio on the4th introduced iDto
the House of Representatives a resolution to
the effect that there had been virtually an ex
change of prisoners during this war, and that
the interests of the army and of humanity de
mand such exchange ; therefo c calling on the
President to take measures to this end.
In the House on the 4th, Mr. Gurley of
Ohio, gave notice of his intention to introduce
a bill confiscating all property of Rebels,
making their slaves free men, giving them
employment during the war, then apprentic
ing them to loyal masters, and finally coloniz
ing them.
Mr. Hale on the 4lh introduced into the
Senate a resolution instructing the Committee
on the Judiciary to inquire into the expedi
ency of abolishing the present Supreme Cfturt,
and of establishing another which shall meet
the requirements of the Constitntion.-
Mr. Holman of Indiana on the 4th in tho
House, offered a series of resolutions reiterat
ing the sentiments of the Crittenden resolu
tions, and reaffirming them. These were
laid on the table by a vote of 71 against Go.
