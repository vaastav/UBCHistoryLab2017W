ALEXAi,;'DEIA, "VA..
WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 7. 1892.
Owing to the opposition of some of
the democratic congressmen to an ex?
tra session of the next Congress, 11???
idea has gotten abroad that the demo?
crats in that body are divided on the j
subject of the tariff, and that if such a 1
Session be held it will be developed
that a trick was played upon the peo?
ple hist fall, and that many democratic
congressman do not think the .McKin?
ley bill as bad us they represented it
upon the stump, and that they are in
favor of giving the protected manufac?
turers at least two yours longer in
which to rob and pillage tin.' people of
tins country by means of the heavy lax
the hill referred to imposts upon the
necessaries of life. Democratic leaders
have often heretofore gone to the relief
of the republican parly in its sore-:
straits; indeed General Graut once
said the republicans could alway relj
upon the democrats to rescue them
from ruin. It is hoped that such maj
not be the case now, but the talk about
the "business interests"' of the country,
indulged in by many of the democrats
in both branches of Congress, is any?
thing else than indicative of the fruition I
of that hope.
both the Virginia Senatorsare, and
properly, in favor of an extra session of
the new Congress, not only that the
promises of their party may be redeem?
ed at once, but that the people may In
relieved of the burdens imposed by the
McKinley tariff bill, and that Daven
portism may be abolished in short or?
der. But of the eight representatives
from the State, interviewed, only two.
.Messrs. O'Ferrall and Lester, tire in
favor of such a sessiou. And yet there
isn't one of them who did not, during
the campaign, denounce lite McKinley
bill and Daveuportism as the sum of
villainies, and urge the election of the
democratic ticket in order that the rob?
beries of the one and the outrages of the
other might lie stopped. 11" stopped,
why not as well next .summer as two
years hence?
According to the latest rumors in
Washington, Mr. Cleveland is opposed
to an extra session of Congress, und the
idea that he is so is the reason for much
of the opposition to stielt a session ex?
pressed by democratic congressmen
who do not want to oppose him, le.-^t
ihey lose their "pull" upon him for fa?
vors. Such rumors can hardly be true,
as Mr. Cleveland is the embodiment of
revenue tariff, and, consequently, must
desire its operation as soon as possible;
and as there can hardly be any demo?
cratic congressman who would deceive
Ids constituents und act against his own
convictions in order to retain the imag
ceuary "pull" referred to.
The Washington newspapers, morn?
ing and evening, contain, each day they
are printed, accounts of brutal crimes
committed by the negroes in that city.
The evil effects of negro suffrage were
so apparent in Washington that every
body there had to be disfranchised in
order to stop it. As the existing laws
are not sufficient to prevent the crimes
referred to, which arc increasing rather
than diminishing under them, others
must be devised. Thirty-nine on the
bare back, certain, would prove a more |
effective deterrent than imprisonment,
or even the gallows, with all the vari?
ous means by which the latter can be
escaped. _
The truest and most apposite crit?
icism upon the President's message
that has been made, is. strange to say.
that of the London Standard. It is as
follows : "Not every one is privileged to
vent his spleen in the form of a state
paper. Mr. Harrison's message is not 1
meant to be gracious. Neither is it im?
pressive. Like the epistle of the re?
jected lover, sincerely trusting that she
will not rue too bitterly the preference
accorded to one unworthy of her affec?
tions, tchabod is written in every sen?
tence."
Commodore Melville, V. s. Navy,
in his annual report, says "put none but
Americans on deck"and that" the Amer?
ican navy should be manned by Ameri?
cans." Good enough. But as there are
not enough American sailors to man
the merchant marine of the country,
where are those who are to man the
navy to come from?
One of the most ridiculous things
about the message Mr. Harrison sent to
Congress yesterday is his twaddle about
the monet?r}'conference, as every body
except himself knows that that confer?
ence will amount to nothing to this
country, except the unnecessary ex
pensc to which it has subjected Ameri?
can tax payers.
THE civil service commission, the
greatest humbug of the age. in its an?
nual report.says "the collection of politi?
cal assessments should be made a penal
offense." It is already such by the civil
?service law; but that law is a dead let?
ter even to those to whom its execution
is entrusted.

The Oyster Question.
The members of the joint commission
appointed by the legislatures of Mary-1
land and Virginia, to confer upon the
oyster bed controversy, reached Wash?
ington yesterday.
The Maryland committee held an in?
formal meeting in the evening, and af?
ter some correspondence with the Vir?
ginia committee, it was Gnaily arranged
that to-day the sub-cominittees will
meet, and if thej' can agree by noon the
two full committees in joint session will
discuss the reports of the sub-commit?
tees.
It is thought that the various sub?
committees, when they meet, can agree
upon some report to make the joint
commission. If not. each sub-commit?
tee will lay its report before the joint
commission, and an attempt at har?
mony will then he made. Should even
this fail, there will be no resort save for
each committee to make its own report
to the legislature of its State. The
Maryland members last night discussed
the report of the Pocomoke sub-com?
mittee. The members of the Virginia
commission discussed the reports of the
sub-committees.
The members of the sub-committee
on tlie culling law are convinced that
there will be no disagreement between
themselves and the members of the
Maryland sub-committee, inasmuch as
the reports of these committees to the
joint commission will agree on all points
under discussion, as the object of legis?
lation in this mallei- is really to correct
an oversight, and to provide for the
same protection to young oysters in
the Potomac that is granted in the
Chesapeake.
The sub-committee on Potomac head?
lands also believes that nn agreement
will be reached. The Maryland com?
mittee claims that tili' waters to and
surrounding Blockston Island belong
to the Maryland mainland. :i proposi?
tion that is not accepted by the Vir?
ginia members. An agreement will be
reached on this point, however, it is
thonght, with difficulty.
The Virginia sub-commil tce will also
endeavor to reach an agreement as to
the powers of either side in the arrest
of criminals and malefactors guilty of
crimes and misdemeanors on the waters
of the Potomac. The report of* the
Virginia committee will also suggest
the prohibition of dredging of oysters
above a line draiwu from Cobb's Point
light to the mouth of Pope's creek.
The two committees, however, will
undoubtedly disagree on the question
arising in relation to the rights of
Maryland to the fishing and oyster
grounds of Pocomo'te Sound. Mary?
land claims that what is Pocomoke
Sound is really Pocomoke river, and
that by a former compact Maryland is
entitled to fishing privileges concur?
rently with Virginia. The Virginia
sub-committee will endeavor to show,
however, that this claim is inconsistent,
and will advance proof that Po
comoke Sound is what it claims to be?
a sound, and not a river.
Speaker Cardwell stated that he felt
sure that the snb-committees of Mary?
land and Virginia would agree in their
reports on the culling law and the Po?
tomac river, but felt-equally sure that
no agreement would be reached in re?
gard to the Pocomoke Sound.

Major Win. T. Sutherlin, president of
the board of agriculture of Virginia,
has completed his annual report and
forwarded it to Gov. McKinney. It is
as follows:
"I have the honor to submit the fifth
annual report of the State board of ag?
riculture, to which your attention is in?
vited. The board has found itself
somewhat embarrassed by the terms of
appropriations, while the amount has
been somewhat increased. There is
lack of authority from the Legislature
to use any part ofthe fund appropriated
directly for immigration. The annual
appropriation of $10,000 has. by the
largely increased work of the depart?
ment, been insufficient for the expenses
in properly carrying out the intention
ofthe Legislature und the wishes oftbc
people. The amount received from fer?
tilizer fees and work in the laboratory
has in the past been put in gross into
the treasury. The lust appropriation
act struck out this proviso. Inn it was
too late in the fiscal year for the board
to avail itself of it fully, and only apart
could he used, and $4,471.62 was return?
ed to the treasury on the ?">?>th of Sep?
tember. Legislation distinct and sim?
ple is greatly needed in regard to fer?
tilizer control and the direct applica?
tion of the money arising front tin- work
of the department laboratory.
''The hoard has been quite success?
ful in holding farmers' institutes in dif?
ferent sections of the Slate, and while
the attendance of farmers bas||bcen
generally small, the addresses of the
distinguished gentlemen invited to ad?
dress these institutes have been so full
and so valuble in the interest of agri?
culture and diversified industries that
the hoard has deemed it proper to pub?
lish most of them in the annual report
for the instruction of the people ofthe
State.
"The inspection and analyses of fer?
tilizer has been much larger than in
any previous year and has been attend?
ed with greatly increased labor and
cost.
"By action ofthe Legislature the ex?
penses of the department have been
considerably increased by the cost of
transportation of all officers and em?
ployes of the department, which was
heretofore granted free of charge.
"The board has taken active meas?
ures to secure at an early day the publi?
cation of a hand-book, as required un?
der the law. It is their purpose to
make this hand-book as full as possi?
ble, embracing a report of each county
in the State as well as a general report
embracing all the information neces?
sary to give a full exhibit of population
and products, &c, of the different
counties anil .sections ofthe State with
an accurate map of Virginia and also
a map and chart of her geographical
deposits with their location, together
with such other literature as may he
deemed necessary for the interest and
information of the farmers of Virginia
and other persons seeking the same.
It is their purpose to publish a sttlJi
cient number of hand-books with an
ample supply of other literature to sup?
ply the farmers and others of Virginia
and also for distribution among tho
visitors at the World's Fair, which
will, in the opinion ofthe board.afford
such facilities for making Virginia
known as she has never been offered
before.
"It is a source of congratulation that the
fanners of Virginia (luring the present vear
have given more attention to diversified
crops than heretofore, and while their surplus
ofthe various products will have to be dis?
posed of at low prices, they will have a better
supply of food at home than for many years
previous.
"We would respectfully submit for your
consideration the enactment of such Laws as
will secure a full and accurate annual statis?
tical report as will furnish reliable informa?
tion as to population, crops of the various
kinds, new industries. &c, as wiil hereafter
show iu all respects the growth and improve?
ment of the Suite in reliable form as is pro?
vided for iu most of the States.
"We would direct your special attention to
the very full and elaborate report of the com?
missioner and the accompanying documents,
and especially his suggestion for the purchase
of an experiment farm, to be operated large?
ly by convict lal>or under tho direction of tile
board.
"This is a new question in this State, and
while the l>ourd is not fully prepared to in
dorse the suggestions of the commissioner they
are of the opinion that under projier regula?
tion of law it might 1>? operated with some
profit to the Stale and the experiments might
furnish the farmers and others in Virginia
valuable and reliable information. The oper?
ation and success iu other States are well
worthy of your investigation in forming a
conclusion on this subject.
"We deem it projicr to state that the com?
missioner and all the employes have dis?
charged their respective duties well and in a
manner satisfactory to the lxjard. We would
most respectfully direct your attention to the
suggestions for legislation on various subjects
for the benefit of the farmers of Virginia con?
tained in our last annual report for such ac?
tion as you may deem proper. We have no
reason to change our opinion upon the recom?
mendations then made, and hope that some
future legislature will take up these various
subjects and give them the consideration we
think they demand."

Wrecked the Durber Shop.
Theodore Petcrman, 3S years old, of
Hoboken, N. J., became violently in?
sane Monday evening. He wanted to
leave the house, but his wife locked
the door. Petcrman made a dash for
^ the window and jumped through it,
earrying sash, glass, and everything
with him. He landed on the awning
of the corner grocery, one floor below.
There was a skylight in the awning
and Petcrman jumped through that,
landing on his feet on the sidewalk.
The crash of the breaking glass at?
tracted a crowd, but everybody was
afraid to approach the crazy man. Pet
erman stood on the sidewalk long
enough to take off his coat and vest.
Then he darted around the corner into
Fifth street. The crowd followed at a
safe distance. There is. or was. a bar?
ber shop in Fifth street, a few doors
below Bloomfield street. Petermau
stood in front of it for a moment, then
made a spring and went through the
window, breaking the sash and glass
as he had done in his own house.
As soon as he was inside he began to
sweep all the cups, bottles, and other
paraphernalia of the shop from the
shelves. He picked up shaving mugs i
and bottles and smasked the mirrors
with them. In two or three minutes
the shop was a complete wreck. The
terrified proprietor made no ellbrt to
save his property. He made a hurried
exit through the door and stood on the
the sidewalk yelling '?murder" and
??police."
By this time a crowd of live hundred
people had gathered. Detective Gal
lagher and Policemen Cross and Breen
pushed their way through the crowd !
and captured the maniac. He made a
desperate tight, but the policemen >uc-1
ceeded in getting him to the police
station. His face and hands were bad?

Dr. McGlynu to be Reinstated.
New York, Dec. 7.?It is said on
the authority of Archbishop Corrigan,
that one of the first fruits of Arch?
bishop Satolli's mission to this country
from Rome, is to be the restoration of
Dr. Edward McGlynn, as a priest in
good standing in the Roman Catholic
Church. Dr. McGlynn was excommu?
nicated by the Pope in 1887for refusing
to go to Rome after his suspension by
Archbishop Corrigan. It is said that
he hx< frequently expressed a desire to
be reinstated in his (acuities iu the
church, and when Archbishop Satolli
arrived in this country he applied to
him. Archbishop Satolli, it is said, in?
duced both sides to make certain con?
cessions. The result was that Dr. Mc?
Glynn is to be received back into good
standing. It is believed he is to make
a public announcement that he is peni?
tent for the manner in which he de?
nounced the Catholic Church authori?
ties after his excommunication.
Archbishop Com<an this morning
made the following statement in regard
to the report which quoted him as say?
ing that Dr. McGlynn's case had been
reopened and that be was coming back
to the church. He said: '"The arch?
bishop repudiates the interview pub?
lished this morning and declares that
he said nothing whatever about Dr. Mc
Glynn, further than to express the
hope that Dr. McGlynn would be
reconciled to the church.''
