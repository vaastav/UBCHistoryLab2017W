STILL THE CRY FOR HOMES
i
HomoEeekers are scouring the town for places to live in, and their demands aro becoming greater as each day
passes. Ask tho real estate men and they will tell you that what tho city needs is a general move in residence
building by property owners. '
The great enterprises of commercial and industrial construction which liavo only just begun here are calling for
more men to do the work. As a rule these men have families and they must have homc3 for their accommodation.
Hundreds of these families have been left behind because of the knowledge that dwellings can not bo had for them
here. When it becomes known that they can be properly housed there will be a general family move toward Salt
Lake.
Can not tho owners of vacant property see that herein is their groat opportunity? Increase of population adds
to tho value of real estate; and property is mado productive by reason of the improvements placed thereon. It will
pay thorn to cover their land with dwellings of all sizes and descriptions thoy will all bo taken, becauso there is
now an iricessant demand for them. Property that is left vacant is only a tax-oaten burden; property that is im
proved is a revenue-producing support to the owner.
There are no two ways about it, Mr. Property Owner; what you ought to do is to immediately put up all
the dwellings you can get on to your lands. It will pay you and will beautify the Attractive American Salt Lakel

Oil OF CONGRESS
IS I0JMWHI m
Many Bills Are Introduced in
Senate; House Passes
Three Measures.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The brief
session of tho Senate today resulted in
the introduction of many bills, resolu
tions, petitions and memorials, and the
receipt of a number of communications
from the cxecutivo department.
Senator Forakcr's insistence that im
mediate action be taken on the pend
ing resolutions for information regard
ing to discharge of negro soldiers of
the Twenty-filth infantry, developed
discussion, but resulted in postponing
action in the matter until tomorrow.
The House today, waiting on tho re
port of the appropriation bills, began
its legislative grind by passing three
measures, incorporating the National
German-American alliance; authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to dupli
cate gold certificates in lieu of ones
lost or destroyed, and the bill amend
ing the National banking laws, per
mitting National banking associations
to make loans on real estate as securtt'
and limiting- the amount of such Joans.
The banking bill has been one of tho
West's favorite measures, and tho
leaders in the House from that section
lined up generally in favor of tho legis
lation, which it was assorted would
go far ioward populariziug the Na
tional banks. The opponents of the
bill, Democrats and Republicans, in
sisted that real estate was not a proper
security for a loan, even though a
limit was placed on the loan. The ad
vocates, of the measure were too strong,
however, and the bill was passed, two
to one.
Tho House adjourned at 2:55 o'clock
jintiLnoon -tomorrow.

The cause of the accident has not ufl

count of the soft track. The train w.13
making about 35 miles an hour when Fl
the derailment happened, and there is
a six-foot fill,' at that point. All the j'S
cars left the track, two mail coaches, rfl
two Pullmans and two day coaches, and '-"1

was sent out from Green River and tho rlH

The lino was cleared and traffic re-
sumed about noon. The train was in lH

raculous. LH
