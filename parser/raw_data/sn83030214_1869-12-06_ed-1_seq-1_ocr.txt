INTmVIl.W OK CUBAN! WITH THE PRESIDENT.
M: HOL 1 Ysser, Echeverr?a, Delinonto and Cisnero
waited on the President on Saturday. Mi. Fesse
stated that his Cuban countrymen asked for no par?
ticular assistance, but objected to the present course
of the (Jolted States as one-sided, and calculated to
help the Spaniards unreasonably. Tho latter could
take all kinds of supplies away from the United
Stat >f>, but the Cubans were not permitted to Bendo?
munitions, provisions or vessels. In answer to aro
miniler of the President that Cuba was not a recog?
nized government, Mr. lesser hoped to have it
other?.s", The United States, he said, tio ono of
our hands, and allow Spain to have both hands free;
only let us have fair play. Mr. Fesser earnestly
pleaded for belligerent rights, but elicited no other
reply from the President than that he conld do
nothing bur curry out the country'? laws. Congicss,
which would soon meet, would, he Kaid, adopt that
course win h would be in its judgment the best.

THE NAT?OS AL HOARD OF TU A DE.
DEBATE ON THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAY?
MENT.
Richmond, Va., Dec. 4.?At the session of
the National Hoard of Trade today, the question of the
resumption of specie payment was taken up. Mr. Hastie
of ( haileston, 8. C.did not think that this was the time
for specie pay incut. The South was not prepared for It,
and it was to her cotton crop lie thought, thnt resump
tum would at last be (Inc. It was better to wait for this
crop, and the general commerce of the country, to bring
the currency to gold value. Ho offered a resolution to
that effect.
Mr. Hopes of Roston stated that while Government
bonds in the last four years had all advanced above par,
yet gold today vas barely lower than it ?.< four years
ago, showing that wlnle confidence in the Government
releed the Taino of its beexle, it dM not permanently
effect the price of gold. Mr. Tr?ves nit DTfted a post
f'oneinent of the matter until the next meeting of the
loard, or at leael until Congress met and tbo President's
message had been heard.
Mr. < ampbell of Newark, ?*. J., said that gov?
ernments cannot legislate their promises |0 pay
into piililic contldence. Their ability to pay is Judged
by the creditors, and if thev are good business tuen they
will not force the.r tardy creditors into bankruptcy. All
this Government wante m time to pay its debts. The
marked d.crease of the publie di bt in the last six months
show? this. Ixt circulation go on for two or four years
without contraction or expansion, and the Government
will be in a condition to resume, and mav then safely re?
sume, by making a gold loan, v. Bit h would make resump?
tion i lay as well us certain. By that time tt would iiavo
bed such eredll In Europe, by the reduction of its
di bt, that a told loan could bo obtained as low as four
per cent.
Mr. II..Iton of Wisconsin thought the only wny to pet
to constitutional money was to get greenbacks out of the
way. They create an Inflation, win. h is oommeretal Im?
morality, and this tan only be cured by a return to a le?
gitimate currency.
Mr. (bittenden of New-York moved ?s n substitute for
all the, propositions that Congress be asked to devise
uiodiilcatiotis of the banking system, and measures for
the suppression of speculations In gold? as are calculated
to rest?lo the credit and honor of the Government, and
promote a return to MPOOM payment as soon as it is con?
sistent with safety. He held that the utmost any body of
private citizens MUM do was to iuipres? on Congress the
importance of aetlng 00 this paramount interest of the
country In preference to the partisan political measures
of their own. Mr. Chlttenden subsequently mod.tied h:n
resolution by striving ont the nllu-lon to the suppression
Of gold ?peculations. He said that be had been informed
that ii distinguished member of Congress would introduce
early in the session a bill to mi three ipeculatlona The
whole subject was then referred to a committee of seven,
consisting:of Messrs. Kirklaiid of Baltimore, Chlttenden
Of New York, RopOS of Roston, Richards of Chicago,
Rolton of Wisconsin. Hooper of Cincinnati, and Hasim
Of Charleston. The following are the propositions :

Stpm, above the inouth of the Missouri, there sliall be one
span MO feet long, and that the construction of piers of
such bridges shall be superintended by Government en?
gincers. Tbo report was received, to be called up lu its
turn.
Tl e thlrtWh proposition, the James River and Ka
nawha Canal, with the report of the special Committee,
was taketi up, which sets forth thai a continuous line of
water communication between the Mississippi River and
the Atlantic sea board is Imperatively needed ; that tbe

tbe Government should grant afB ? then after the canal
d ti m k the money ?Pent OU it by the General Gov?
ernment and the Wate of Virginia, It shall tie a fi
collecting on tolls snfllctent for its repair. Mr. Monroe
of DubUOUe advocated the report. He stated that of
26,000,000 tuns of Western produce there i? only trans?
portation to the Rast for 19,000)000. A water line will
bung this aw i r inn (?Ml than the railroad

Mr. Walbrtdgeof New York nnvocated the report. lie
thought the country, to u bom Virginia had made a mag?
nificent gift, should not refuse hi r now thai s|,o gafc d to
share in its prosperity, and that the North, which had
grown rub by the war,should ant hold backtbishelp
from a State reduced to poverty, and which asked fot
nothing that she was not Willing to give something lu
return for. it was not eltogetbei BflueaUofl of profltaole
investment, but siso one of Justice. fcuiely a threat

Mr. Holton of Milwaukee opposed the report en the

should do the work. Centralization was already threat?
ening this country, and he w ante.I more Work dono by

JefftThon Market Police, Court, wbetV wore
conflued the two principals m the political shooting affray
?John DOMfeM and John Hcaunel?was besieged all day.
on Saturday by a throng of Wurd politicians uiaklrg In?
quiries about their chiefs. In the morning an attempt
Was made to deceive Alderman Ward by presenting a
forged pbysh'lau's certificate from tho house surgeon of
Bellcvue Hospital, alleging that Johnson was out of
danger, upon which It was dioaiandcd that the magistrate
should release John Scannet on bail, hut the Alderman'
saw the trick, Late In the afternoon, however, another
effort was made to procure Beaaeel'a reloaae, aud tho fol?
lowing gennieapaper ?>? presented :

I hereby certify that George Johnson, alias Gotirge
Jackson, alls? Thomas Johnson, was admitted to my rare
on Friday, Utv. 3, tbW suffering from a pistol shot wound
of the neck. The ball has been extracted, and, although
1 consider tho wound a serious one, I hawi good reason to
hop? tlmi he will recover from his injuries. Hlisymptom?

Ah!. Ward then decided to admit Boaanel to bail for

becoming his boudsman. I pen his lufornial examina

arty, WM by occupation? hotel keeper, und asserted his
iniKHei.ee of the charge o? having shot Johnson. H?? left
the Court aorreanded with a noisy crowd of friend?,
some in flashy clothing and epotleea linen, ami some In
the dfrtlest of habllliiieuU. Among them were frUatc
Senators, and ex Senators, members of Assembly Alder?
men, court officials, lawyer?, and small peUtieiaoi beside
theae members of the Kcannel gang wbo were lively
enough ?o escapo arrest. On Friday night, after the Police
Court had closed for the dar, sotno Meoaeof Dooobue
who wait then lock?*! up u. I he cells, procured a certificate
from Dr. J. W. Owley that Dooobue should
be I nt to Bellevue Hosnital for treatment Al?

D.hue to the hospital or to the care of PoUce Justice
Kelly, who offered to be responsible fur the prutoiier's
eppmime??? Dommue was thee taken to his home
accompanied by a police officer, Wbere the ball w?." ex?
tracted rroui his arm. LbMMbee'a friends made p. rsnteut

Coroner Rollins, on Saturday, visited H.llevue Hospital
for the purpose of obtaining Florence Scanners antc
mortees statement, but Beaaael positively refused to
make any statement, and it Is now more than probable
that no further proceedings will be taken in tbe caso.

SERMON Of THE REV. O. B. PROTHINGHAM? THE
RICHARDSON MARRIAGE.
The fiev. 0. B. Frothinxham preached yester?
day morning, in Lytto Hall, from the words: "Be ye
perfect, even as your Father In Heaven is perfect." The
opening part of his discourse was devoted to remarks
on tho various ambitions which Influenced mankind
aspirations for place, for power, for riches, and for learn?
ing. These were commonly called aspiration?, but really
they were not?they were ambitions. To aspire waa to
abase one's self; to bo bumble, and modest, aud do one's
duty quietly. The reverend gentleman concluded his
sermon by alluding, in the following words, to the part
which he had taken In the marriage of the late Mr.
Richardson to Mrs. McFarland :
You know what Is on my mind to-day, and I know what
Is on yours. For these four days past we have heard of
nothing but a great outrage against tho laws of society,
and " a plot to undermine the walla of the commuait v, to
tear up the fonndatlons of all good and virtuous mon."
Ah! friends, to spread abroad ldlo and vain vindictive
gossip; to read garrulous, talkative, and unjust matter;
to vlllify reputable people ; to drag characters before the
public, and put them on the pillory, and pelt them with
rotten, random abuse and malediction, is to break up the
order, peace an?! harmony of society. To fill upa newly
made grave with venom, to cover a pure, lovely, broken?
hearted, distracted woman with reproof?to fix a stigma
which, perhaps, can never be wiped off npon innocent
children standing on tho threshold of life, is to break up
tho order, peace and harmony of society. To Judge con?
duct in advance of Justice, to try to create a public senti?
ment In favor of tho assassin, is an abuso against the
order and decency of society. To anticipate law is an
abuse against the order and harmony and peace of
society. When Phariseeism docks itself In Its whitest
robes and sweeps through the streets with the proudest
m'en, aud makes its philanthropies very wide and con?
spicuous, and drops Its bitter scorn upon innocent and
harmless people, an outrage Is perpetrated against the
order, peace and decency of society. They break up the
foundations of society who break up the fournit tious of
confidence, who make people distrust one another, who
All the air with malignant rumors of poison. My
friends. It is due to you that I should
tell you, In very few w ords, precisely what my position
was and Is In this fearful matter that basso exercised
and agitated the public mind. To the world I have
nothing to say?to tho papers that have abused me
nothing. You wero my friends, I am your servant. To
you I am responsible. You have a perfect right to know
what I did, and why I did It. To you, therefore, let me
say, in all confidence and lu perfect sincerity, these fow
winds. Albert Richardson was my parishioner, seldom
here because seldom In the city, but, when attending
church anywhere In New-York, attending hero. When
ho was shot, as his minister I sent him a word of sympa?
thy and condolence. Had his assassin Instead of himself
be-on my parlshlonerl should have gone with equal readi?
ness to him, and should have tried to bring
the infinite terror and truth aud tenderness
near to his heart. Of Mr. Richardson I know
very little, of the woman I knew nothing. Their
friends I had known for years?gentlemen and ladies, I
knew them, aud count them still, of good character, of
unstained Integrity, of Irreproachable truth. What they
told mo I believed, I still believe. Returning on Tuesday
afternoon to my homo I found a letter stating that Mr.
Blchardeofl was dying ; that there was not a chance in a
thousand that he would live; that his lawyer, a distin?
guished man In his profession, a man eminent for legal
qualities and for pe? sonal character, had pronounced It
eeeeeeary that the marriage should take place, if it waa
to talo- placo at all ; that the surgeon said that be
must dio and the marriage must be solemnized. It was
tlie opinion of law, it was the opinion of all their friends.
The divorce had been obtained ; it was supposed to be aa
lf-gal as such divorces ever are. It fa no un?
common thing for clergymen to marry persons
who have been divorced. I have done it my?
self. I know that other clergymen have done it.
Tlie divorce was granted. It was granted under forms of
law. It was granted in complete acquiescence with the
requirements of law. There was nothing to outrage pri?
vate sentiment ; there was nothing to outrage Christen?
dom. This noto said : "Come at once ; there is no time
to lose ; Mr Richardson desires that you should bo pres?
ent." At once I went. Mr. Beeeher was there. He had
been summoned as I, In order that he, representing the
orthodox faith, might satisfy those members of the fam?
ily who wore orthodox. We had two or three moments
of conversation. We went lu together to the ceremony.
Wo soleinniied the marriage. We took the facts as they
stood - no more, no less. Neither of us knew anything
about the history, or wero concerned In it. Neither of us
had been implicated in tlie toast with anything that had
occurred. It was not our concern. The matter before us
was perfectly simple as a matter of Justice to the man and
to the woman. To the children, to society, It was
dut; t hat that marriage should bo solemnized In a publio
way by responsible people, before responsible people, in
the way that m ver could be galnaayed or taken back. It
was so performed. I was never clearer in regard to my
duty in my life. I never have been dearer lu regard to
my duty ttian I have been in regard to tills. Nothing
has changed my opinion. I acted aa a clergyman and as
a clergyman should. We stood together t)y tne dead ;
there lay the dead body; there were tho weeping friends
around. I avowed then, as I avow no?, that the relation
between that man and that woman was honorable and
innocent. I believed it then; I believed It on what I
considered good evnlenco -the best of evidence?these
gentlemen and ladies who had known both partlea .for
tlie longest number of years aud In the roost Intimate
jm-sililo way. What waa then my position Is my posi?
tion now entirely. I do not say I know it; I do uot say
1 am-ure of it; I am not sure. I am not Judge and
Jury; the matter Is not before the court; there is no evi?
dence. In the proper time, before the proper tribunals,
the evidence will bo summoned, witnesses will be
gathered together, and we will possibly know the truth.
At present nobody knows tho truth except that one
woman. Mr. Richardsou is In his grave, and can say
nothing. The friends may all bo mistaken. That woman's
heart contains tin: secret. Hho alone knows the truth.
It is not for me or for yon, for enemies or for friends, to
sit Injutlgment upon the case. It must bo left where it la
for tho present. Our beliefs mnst bo open to correction,
as mine, I frankly say, is, but, until I seo the evidence, I
shall hold to my present position. It is a maxim in law
that people are to be held innocent until they are proved
guilty. It l*a maxim injustice that people were to be
held clean until ull circumstances nro weighed, until
everything is brought to light, until all the
complications are unraveled, until a fair, clear reason
la flvea for believing the opposite. It is a maxln in relig
1 m that chari'y covers a multim le of sins. As a relig?
ious man, I spread that mantlo of charity, and l will not
allow, if I can help It, any public or private vituperation
le tear It off. As a man who belieVM In Justice and
reason, I wait until Justice and reason shall lie unfolded.
As a man who lespects the law, I abide the r?'sult of tho
legal tribunal. The attitude of religion and of the Chris?
tian minister in such a oaae Is perfectly plain. It is to bo
Just, if possible, to ail. Kind lu tho Judgment to tho man
who is asleep ; kind lu the Judgment to the man who was
sU) lor-weighing temptation and passion lu the bal?
ance, and giving blui their allowance, not casting a stone
heartlessly at him ; kind to that poor woman, whom, God
knows, has enough to bear, her heart broken now
by her strrow, and to bo broken again and
again in the long weary struggle of her lonely life?a
woman upon whose fair name has been heaped immeas?
urable reproach; kind to those poor children, to shelter
them, to stretch over ttn-ui the mantle of charity, to
Maud between them ami the world that Is full of malig?
nity, and to say, " No. these belong to Ood." And, as
Ood knows I am a man, I shall deem It my duty to stand
up for the innocent until they ure proved guilty. To
stand uii for the lonely and the solitary under all cir?
cumstances, and to spread tho vail of charity oven over
those that are suspected. If this story was as bad as tlie
wor?t ?if all were true that has been said or surmised, I
should then fall back on love?upon that great sentiment
of charity wliica remembers human weakuoas aud frailty,
human passion, human sympathy, aud which takes
them all up In tho presence of tho Most
High, the most Benignant Father of Heaveu.

Prophecies may pass away, knowledge may pass away,
tongues may fall, all gculus aud the* talent of the earth
may go down and bo forgotten, but Cod's lovo abides

aud that abides forever. Um day will como wheu tho
