Washington. Deo. 7.—A doctrine of
Pan-Americanism—of full partner
ship between the nations of the west
ern hemisphere in world affairs—was
proclaimed by President Wilson today
in his third annual address to con
gress, the theme of which was pre
paredness by the United Stales to de
fend not only its own independence
but the rights of those with whom it
was made common cause. The mes
sage was read by the president to the
senate and house assembled in joint
Bession in the chamber of the house.
Every recommendation embodied
In the document had to do with com
prehensive plans for strengthening
the national defenses. The program
includes the army and navy plans
already made public by Secretaries
Garrison and Daniels legislation for
government owned merchant ships:
a rural credit law the Philippine and
Porto Rico bills which failed of final
passage at the last session conserva
tion legislation a law giving federal
aid to industrial and vocational edu
cation, and the creation of a oom
tnlsston to inquire Into the transporta
tion problem.
Naturalized and native born Ameri
cans who, sympathizing with belliger
ents abroad, have plotted and con
spired to violate their own country's
neutrality were scathingly denounced
T»y the president, and congress was
urged to provide adequate federal laws
to deal with such offenders.
Internal taxation was proposed as
the means of providing the money
Mcessary to add to the naval and
jtnllltary establishments. Sources of
luxation suggested were incomes,
E»1
line, naptha, automobiles and in
explosion engines, fabricated
and steel, and a stamp tax on
bank checks. Extension of the warj
revenue bill and continuance of the
present, tariff on sugar were recom
mended, and the sale of bonds op
posed. The message follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress: Since
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
Which had then only begun to disclose

international affairs, and now pre
sents a prospect of reorganization and
reconstruction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously
neutral. It was our manifest duty to
do so. Not only did we have no part
or interest in the policies which seem
to have brought the conflict on it was
necessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great fam
ily of nations should keep the process
es of peace alive, if only to prevent
collective economic ruin, and the
breakdown throughout the world of
the industries by which its populations
are fed and sustained. It was manifest
ly the duty of the self-governed na
tions of this hemisphere to redress,
if possible, the balance of economic
loss and confusion in the other, if they
could do nothing more. In the day of
readjustment, mid recuperation we
earnestly hope and believe that, they
can be of infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from the politics of Europe but
also by a clear perception of interna
tional duty, the states of America have
become conscious of a new and more
vital community of interest and moral
partnership in affairs, more clearly
conscious of the many common sym
pathies and interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
Pan-Americanism
I Proved by Record
of Former Years
There was a time in the early days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to independ
ence In Central and South America
when the government of the United
States looked upon itself as in some
sort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water
felt it its duty to play the part even
without invitation from them and I
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and dis
interested enthusiasm for the freedom
a friend to
tender skins
Any soap will clean your skin—
a bar of laundry soap will do if you
do not care what becomes of your
complexion. But yen know that
laundry soapcontains harsh, drying
alkali that would ruinyourskin and
hair, so you never think of using it
for your toilet.
Many toilet soaps contain this
same injurious alkali. Resinol Soap
contains absolutely no free alkali,
qnd to it are added the Resinol med
ication. This gives it soothing, heal
ing properties which clear the com
plexion, comfort tender skins and
keep the hair rich and lustrous.

of the Americas and the unmolested
self-government of her independent
peoples. But it was always difficult
to maintain such a role without of
fence to the pride of the peoples whose
freedom of action we sought to pro
tect. and without provoking serious
misconceptions of our motives, and
every thoughtful man of affairs must
welcome the altered 'circumstances of
the new day in whose light we now
stand, when there is no claim to
guardianship or though of wards but,
instead, a full and honorable associa-
In It no thought of taking advantage
of any government in this hemisphere
or playing its political fortunes for
our own benefit. All the governments
of America stand, so far as we are
concerned, upon a footing of genuine
equality and unquestioned independ
ence.
Put to the Test
in Mexico Have
Withstood it Well
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mexi
co by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advant
age of her in her distress and under
take to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set,
and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American who has drunk at the
true fountains of principle and tradi
tion must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia Bill of Rights, which in the
great days in which our government
was set up was everywhere amongst
us accepted as the creed of free men.
That doctrine is, "That government is,
or ought to be, instituted for the com
mon benefit, protection and security
of the people, nation or community
that "of all the various modes and
forms of government, that Is the best
which is capable of producing the
greatest degree of happiness and safe
ty, and is most effectually secured
against the danger of maladministra
tion and that, when any government
shal be found inadequate or contrary
to these purposes, a majority of the
community hath an indubitable, in
alienable, and indefeasible right to
reform, or abolish it, in such manner
as shall be judged most conducive to
the public weal." We have unhesitat
ingly applied that heroic principle to
the case of Mexico, and now hopefully
await the rebirth of the troubled re
public, which had so much of which to
purge itself and so little sympathy
from any outside quarter in the radic
al- but necessary process. We will aid
and befriend Mexico, but we wHl not
coerce her and OUIJ course with re
gard to her ought to be sufficient
proof to all America that we seek no
political suzerainty or selfish control.
Not Hostile, But
Republics Are
Friendly Rivals
The moral is, that the states of
America are not hostile rivals but co
operating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them
a new significance as factors In inter
national affairs and in the political
history of the world. It presents them
as In- a very deep and true sense a
unit in world affairs, spiritual part
ners, standing together because think
ing together, quick with common sym
pathies and common ideals. Separated
they ate subject to all the crow cur
rents of the confused politics of a
world of hostile rivalries unked in
spirit and purpose they cannot be dis
appointed of their peaceful destiny-
This is Pan-Americanism. It has
none of the spirit of empire in it. It
is, the embodiment, the effectual em-'
bddlment/of the spirit of lawand in-'
dependence and% liberty and mutual

THE GRAND FORKS DAILY HERALD: TUESDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 7. 1519.
Says Conference
Marks a Turning
Point in Affairs
A very notable body of men recent
ly met In the city of Washington, at
the invitation and as the guests of this
government, whose deliberations are
likely to be looked back to as mark
Ing a memorable turning point in the
tlon as of partners between ourselves of America. They were repre
and our neighbors, in the interest of sentative spokesmen of the several in
all America, north and south. Our con
cern for the independence and tros
dependent states of this hemisphere
and were assembled to discuss the
perity of the states of Central and' ?Jlanc'a' commercial relations of
South America is not altered. We re
tain unabated the spirit that has in
spired us throughout the whole life of
our government and which was so
frankly put into words by President
Monroe. We still mean always to
make a common cause of national In
dependence and of political .liberty in
I America- But that purpose is now bet
ter understood so far as it concerns
ourselves. It is known not to be a
selfish purpose. It is known to have
the republics of the two continents
which nature and political fortune
have so intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend tp your perusal
the reports ot^thelr {proceedings and
of the actions
'of th^HStommittees. You
will get from tnem,'"Il think, a fresh
conception of the ease and intelligence
and advantage with which Americans
of both continents may draw together
In practical co-oper4tion and of what
the material foundations of this hope
ful partnership must consist—of how
we should build them and of how
necessary it is that we should hasten
their building.
There is, I venturjb to point out, an
especial significance just now attach
ing to this whole rrtatter of drawing
•the Americas together in bonds of
honorable partnership and mutual ad
vantage because of the economic re
adjustments which the world must in
evitably witness within the next gen
eration, when peace shall have at last
resumed its healthful tasks. In the
performance of these tasks I believe
the Americas to be destined to play
the!? parts together. I am Interested
to fix your attention on this prospect
now because unless you take it within
your view and permit the full signifi
cance of it to command your thought
I cannot find the right light in which
to set forth the particular matter that
lies at the very front of my whole
thought as I address you today. I
mean national defense.
No one who really' comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom
we are appointed to speak can fail to
perceive that their passion is for
peace, their genius best displayed in
the practice of the arts of peace.
Great democracies are not belligerent.
They do not seek or desire war. Their
thought is of individual liberty and of
the free labor that supports life and
the uncensored thought that quickens
it. Conquest and dominion are not in
our reckoning, or agreeable to our
principles. But just because we de
mand unmolested development and
the undisturbed government of our
own lives upon our own principles of
right and liberty, we resent, from
whatever quarter it may come, the
aggression we ourselves will not prac
tice. We Insist upon security in prose
cuting our self-cliosen lines of nation
al development. We do more than that.
We demand it also for others. .We do
not confine our enthusiasm for indi
vidual liberty and free national de
velopment to the incidents and move
ments of affairs whWh affect only our
selves. We feel it wherever there is a
people that tries to walk in these diffi
cult paths of independence and right.
From the first we have made com
mon cause with all partisans of liberty
on this side of the sea, and have
deemed it as Important that our
neighbors should be free from all out
side dbmlnatlon as that we ourselves
should be have set America aside as a
whole for the uses of independent na
tions'and political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a

means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are as
fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation as
of aggression from without. We will
not maintain a standing army except
for uses which are as necessary in
times of peace as in times of war and
we shall always see to it that our mil
itary peace establishment is no larger
than is actually and continuously]
needed for the uses of days in which
no enemies move against us. But we
do believe in a body of free citizens
ready and sufficient to take care of
themselves and of the governments
which they have set up to serve them.
In our constitution themselves we I
have commanded that "the right of
the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed." and our con
fidence has been that our safety in
times of danger would lie in the ris
ing of the nation to take care of it
self, as the farmers rose at Lexing
ton.
Citizens Must
Know How If
Suddenly Called
But war has never been a mere
matter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might. If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting Is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it. The military arm
of their government, which they will
not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their independence secure—and not
their own independence merely but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put In Jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war
for more adequate national defense
were conceived which will be laid be
fore you, and which I urge you to
sanction and put Into effect as soon as
they can be properly scrutinized and
discussed. They seem to me the essen
tial first steps, and they seem to me
for the present sufficient.
They contemplate an increase of the
standing force at the irregular army
from its present strength of five thou
sand and twenty-three officers and
one hundred and two thousand nine
hundred and eighty-five enlisted men
of all services to a strength of seven
thousand one hundred and -thirty-six
officers and one hundred and thirty
four thousand seven hundred and sev
en enlisted men, or 141,848, all told,
all services, rank and file, by the ad
dition of fifty-two companies of coast
artillery, fifteen companies of engi
neers, ten regiments of infantrv, four
regiments of field artillery, and four
aero squadrons, besides seven hundred
and fifty officers required for a great
variety of extra service, especially the
all important duty of training the cit
izen force of which I shall presently
speak, seven hundred and ninety-two
non-commissioned officers for service
in drill, recruiting and the like, and
the necessary quota of enlisted men
for the quartermaster corps, the hos
pital corps, the ordnance department,
and other similar auxiliary services.
These are the additions necessary to
render the army adequate for its pres
ent duties, duties which it has to per
form not only upon our own conti
nental coasts and borders and at our
interior army posts, but also in the
Philippines, In the Hawaiian Islands,
at the Isthmus, and in Porto Rico
Trained Citizenry
is Most Important
Feature of Plan
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale,
should occasion arise, the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of four hundred thousand
disciplined citizens, raised in incre
ments of one hundred and thirty-three
Clear, Peachy Skin
Awaits Anyone Who
Drinks Hot Water
Says an inside bath, before break
fast helps us look and fesl
clean, sweet, fresh.
Sparkling and vly^cious—merry,
bright,' alert—a good, clear skin and
a natural, rosy, healthy complexion
are assured only by pure blood. If
only every man and woman could be
induced to adopt the morning iiuiide
bath, what a gratifying change would
take place. Instead of the thousands
of .sickly, anaemic-looking men, wo
men and girls, with pasty or muddy
complexions instead of the multi
tudes of "nerve wrecks," "rundowns,"
"brain fags" and pessimists we
should see a virile, optimistic throng
of rosy-cheeked people everywhere.
An inside bath is had by drinking
each morning, before breakfast, a
glass of real hot water with a tea
spoonful of limestone phosphate in it
to wash from the stomach, liver, kid
neys and ten yards of bowels the pre
vious da^r's indigestible waste, sour
fermentations and poisons, thus
cleansing, /sweetening and freshening
-the entire alimentary canal before
putting' more food into 4he stomach.
Those subject to sick headache, bil
iousness, nasty breath, rheumatism,
colds and particularly those who
have a pallid, sallow complexion and
who are constipated very often, are
urged to obtain a quarter pound of
limestone phosphate at the drug store
which will cost but a trifle, but is
sufficient to demonstrate the' quick
and remarkable change In both health
and appearance, awaiting those who
practice internal sanitation. We must
remember that inside cleanliness is
more Important than outside, because
the skin does-not absorb impiirttiQl)
to' contaminate the blood while the
pores in the thirty feet of bowels do.
At least BO much by way of prepa
ration for defense seems to me to be
absolutely imperative now. We cannot
do less.
J-
Navy Plan Only
Shortens Time of
Handling Program
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out but it does make definite and ex
plicit a program whlah has heretofore
been only Implicit/held In the minds
of the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to
adopt a comprehensive plan for put
ting the navy upon a completion with
in the next five years. We have always
looked to the navy of the country as
our first and chief line of defense we
have always seen It to be our mani
fest course of prudence to be strong
on the seas. Tear by year we have
been creating a navy which now ranks
very high Indeed among the navies of
the maritime nations,. We should now
definitely determine how we shall
complete what we have begun, and
how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de

training to man the ships which will
be completed early in 1918- It is also
necessary that the number of midship
men at the naval academy at Annapo

three hundred in order that the force
of officers should be more rapidly ad

from civil life.
If this full program should be car

timates of survival and standards of
classification followed by the general
board of the department, an effective
navy consisting of twenty-seven .bat
