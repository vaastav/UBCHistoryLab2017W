OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
SViittoii and compiled for tbe lit 11.11 I?.
Congress has met, organized.and
nail the President s message. The
.-senate has gone to work \v th
Senator Sherman in the Vice PresJ
dent's chair, and the 1 loose ot
l.fpreseiitatives, svith Mr. Carlisle
is presidiug otlieer, is discussing a
ie\ ising of its rules.
The opening scenes of tho Forty
Ninth Congress were similar to
those of the Forth-Figbth, Forth
-s.seiitli FoitlisiMli, and mans
others of the past. There svas the
same rush to the Capitol. Ibero
ssr)e ciowded galleries and corri?
dors, and the same turbulent scenes
on the Moor of the House, to svliich
members old anil nesv contributed.
In tin? Senate tbe old tuno dignity,
decorum ami ?luietude prevailed,
and the old familiar faces were at
their desks.
The opening proceedings of this
CongWOB wet? necesisarily unexcit?
ing, but the session promises to be
a lively oue for hiisnii
Senate at least will bo a working
buis, and it is likely to supply ma
teiial lot much excitement bebue
its close.
The President's message has <>t
ourse been tho chief sol'.iect of
eomment for several days. Opin
ion? expressed even by Democratic
Senators and Members have varied
so much that it would be imposai
ble to tell the drift of their criti?
cism. An almost unanimous com
iinnt and regret was that the pa?
per was too long. Some of tho
more conservative Mepubbeau
Senators have said that tho mess?
age svas Baute valuable for the in
foi mation contained in it than for
pinions o\pressed or policy
advocated, senator I/>gan said he
svould express his views on the
Hoor of tho .-entile. Tho aggress
ive Senator from Kansas, Mr.
Ingalls, characterized the d"cu
nient an an incoherent mass of
dogmatic platitudes, unrelieved by
a single novel idea. The sugge?
tit'iis about silver, he said, wen
old ami shallow.
The financial chapter in the
m? ?s.igf 1,-d to the most criticism.
Tbs ?ilver men of tho South and
>v est aie in arms against the views
of the President ami the Secretary
of the Tieastiry on this a?t
The position of tho Administration
will has?- no effect in ci
the.r polioy.
It beiag admitted that the ta)ill
and silver (|iieations will be dealt
With by this I ougrt'S?, the wide
divergence of opiniou upon them,
BBBOBg mi n of the same party
tends to increase tho inte.-est. The
advocates of silver coinage say the
President has simply repeated the
old won out arguments of Wall
street. Mut I)i mociats, as a rule,
who ditlei from Mr. Cleveland an?
nul inclined to express their antago?
nism publicly.
\ large list of President nomina?
tions made during the recess of the
Senate have been sent in for con
firBBStiea, Somoof them are like

The Senate has many interesting
debates in prosrject, matter for

mnrids is preparing a bill to de?
stroy Mormonism altogether, by
depriving the Church of its tempor?
al power.
Senator Blair has again introdu

rage 00 women, and it is said there
is a desire to precipitate au anima

night, however, the (Ieorgia Pacifli
was somewhat delayed, and wbei
it stopped at the water tank was 01

plying the brakes. Be was unable,
however, to avert the collision.?
The engine tore its way into the
real Ol the coach, and the rear ol
the conch telescoped the one ill

the one ahead ol It. The real
coach was idled with peacongors
many of whom were so pinned
down by the wreck that they wen
unable to stir, and the escapin?
steam soon caused the death ol
Jive or six. The cries of the in
injured rent the air.
afa.ll was darkness, and the state?
ments of those who hastened t?
the scene are to the effect that
words cannot describe the awful
ncss of the situation. As aoon is
possible the Last Tennessee train
W0S backed trom the wreck, and
ihe work of removing the dead and
wounded commenced. Lrom Aus
tell a message was sent to Atlanta,
apprising the officials of the road
of the accident, and asking lot
help. At L'.:.'.. A. M., a tram left
here bearing physicians and several
of the railroad officials. The offi?

B. 6RATZ BROWN DEAD.
St. Luis, Mo., December IS.?
?. l?. Qrats Brown died at
Ins resid? nee, in KiritWOOd, Mo,,
this morning, of heart disease, af
i a brief illness, lie had lately
been appointed master in chancery
?u the i Inited Suites Court, and
v.,is engaged on an important rail
ioad case when he was taken ill.
At liis! a was thought the attack
was only ?i slight one, but ycsler
(lav symptoms of licart-ilis.-a.se do?
reloped, and his condition soon
changed for the worse.
He was a itroag fneud of Ben?
ton's am! in 1858 became involved
m a quarrel with lion. Thomas ('.
Itcynolds, at thai time United
Mates District Attorney, on M
count of his vigorous pro-l'cuton
sentiment?, which led toa duel in
which Mr. Brown received a slight
wound m the leg,while Beynolds es?
caped uninjured.
The deceased was born at Prank?
lord, Ky., in 1826, and was the son
ol ?lohn Mason lliown, at that time
Secretary of the State. He was a
graduate of the Transylvania Uni
versity al Lexington, Ky. Became
to St. Louis in 1851 and was part
proprietor and editor of the afii
?ouri Democrat,
lie was elected to the Legisla?
ture as a Free-Soil Democrat. lie
raised a regiment during the lato
war and served for a short time in
the I nion army. In ISl!.'{ he was
elect c.I to the United Suites Benate,
?uni m 1870 was 'elected Covornor.
He was a candidate lot Viee-I'resi
tltiit on the Crceley ticket in 187-',
but since then has been entirely
out o! politics.
lie leaves a wife and nine chil?
dren well provided for.
l'i'oi?i'KSS.?A correspondent of
the Lynchborg Wetn writes from
Murtiiiaville. Henry county, Va.:
"There is nothing in Southeru pro?
gress more marvelous than the
growth of this place during the
past live years. In 1880 Martins
\ ill?* wee a sleepy little village of
L'-Vi inhabitants. Now our popu?
lation is ^,0(10. In 1880 there was
not a tobacco factory, warehouse
m machine shop In Martinsville.
Now there are nine factories, four
luge warehouse for the sale of
tobacco, three inaehine shops an?!
a foundry, We have some of the
handsomest storehouse and busi?
ness blocks m the State, all now
and inade of brick. Two new brick
(?hinches have been built, and two
mote viill soon be constructed. In

lie was dropsical, but why tbe fluid

1 proposed t<> place him m the hos?

about tlm milky fluid, you know?
but he consented.
" 1 decided upon an investigation
andonTuesday I made an incision
in the abdomen. There was the
milky Hi.id ?quarts ot it. I drain
ed li i m out ami made an opening
six inches in length, laying the in

and found a malignant sore?can?

for his spleen and found it Bllbei

this did not account I'm Ibe milky
eoloi of the secretions, and i
up the lacteal duet, which empties
into the left sub-clavical vein and
round a rupture. The Huid, in?

satisfied. I closed up the opening
