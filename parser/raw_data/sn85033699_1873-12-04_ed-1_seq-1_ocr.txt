PIXCIIBACK.
Special to the Louisville Courier-Journal.
"Washington, Dec 2. Pinehback is
claiming both a scat as United States Sen
ator and a seat as member of the House
from .Louisiana; but the idea of the Radical
leaders is to seat him in the llouse. The
reason of this is that Pinehback :s an im
pudent, loquacious ami irrepressible mulat
to, who if in the Senate would be bouncing
up on all occasions, and illustrating day by
day and hour by hour the beautiful idea of
negro equality. The Radical Senators,
with all their cant, don't want him there.
Hence it is arranged to get him a place in
the House, where he can make $20,000 a
vear easv. and sneak onlv when Mr. Blaine
gives him the lloor, which will be about
once a year perhaps.
UNW0KTIIY THE OCCASION.
The President's Jlcssasc Received
With lMsfhvor- by Republicans.
Special to the Louisville Courier-Journal.
Washington. Dec 2. There was the
usual interest felt in the House to-day, to
bear the President's message. The paper
not being printed prei iously, members, in
order to learn the points of the message,
naturally listened to the reading of the
document by the Clerk, until its stupidity
fairly wearied them out. The general im
pression is tliat the message was utterly
unworthy of a great occasion. Even Re
publicans seem to be asliamed of it, and
are shv of expressing their opinion. De
mocrats are more free to speak out what
they think. The reservation of the cor
respondence on the Cuban question, in
order to await verification of the cable dis
patches, will give the Government time to
receive back tbe Virginius and her captives

FINANCIAL RECOMENDATIONS OBIKCTIHI
TO.
The financial part of it is especially con
temned as muddy and inconsistent, advo
cating specie payment in theory while urg
ing inflation when it comes to action.
The suggestion of a Constitutional
amenihnentallowing the President to veto
any part of a bill luTpleascs, and to approve
. others, strikes every one as a monstrous
step toward despotism, as it would practi
rallv rive the P.esident the entire power
of legislation. In the Confederate Con
stitution the President was empowered to
disapprove any appropriation and to approve
others in the same bill; but this was limit
ed to appropriations, whereas, according to
President Grant, this power would extend
to all subjects of legislation and make his
will the law.
The power of dictating the subjects to
come before the Congress, excluding all
others, for which he also asks, is plainly
borrowed from European examples, and
will encounter scant favor even from this
Congress.
The idea of building residences here for
the Cabinet, Senators, etc,hasalso a decid
ed squinting toward monarchy. Following
these suggestions comes very appropriately
an indorsement of the corrupt Washington
citv ring.
To sav that the message fell flat is very
imperfectly to describe the failure. Such
is the general view of the document, and
it. "is fronerallv conceded that Congress will
proceed to legislate, especially upon finan
cial matters, with very little reference to
what the President has just said to them.
SOMETHING OF A BREEZE.
Ben Hutlcr in n Terrible Rajre A Hit
ter Altercation.
From the St. Louis Republican.
Washington, Dec 1 The back-pay
caucus of the House Republicans to-night
was a lively affair. lis session was pro
tracted and the discussion at times red-hot.
There was a general feeling that something
had got to be done; but the point of di (Ter
ence was, how to do it. The members who
attended it are very reticent as to the de
tails of the scramble, and some of them are
gnim and savage over the result. Free in
dulseucc was had in crimination and re
crimination, and several quarrels were be
gun which promise to recur to the surface
in Congress from time to time during the
session. The fight in the caucus was niost
Iv between Ren Butler, Kasson, of Iowa,
and Hale Tf Maine, while the lesser lights
chipped in as they could get opportunity.
The bold and biliuos Benjamin was in his
element. He slornW up and down and
ripped and roared. He called his colleagues
a pack of infernal poltroons, and said that
while thev might be intimidated and brow
beaten bv "a few beardless boys and super
annuated dead-beats in newspaper row, he
would not. He possessed manhood enough
to brave anv storm, and he never had weak
ened in the" face of clamor, but had always
proudly shouldered the consequences of his
acts. . , .
Vnecnn. nnt. bavin been interested in
Ibe back-pay, rose to champion the cause
of honcstv and economy. He would not
lie browbeaten bv the arrogance of any
member. He had, he was glad to say, a
rcard for the wishes of his constituents,
which iiad never been blunted by ten-thousand-dollar
fees. He should see to it
that the records of the Republican party
were cleared of the stains of the last ses
sion. As further facts about the back-pay cau
cus to-night leak out the interest increases.
The arrangement mentioned in earlier dis
patches is in the bands of a committee,
which is to report to a future caucus; but
the bill reported will be substantially as at
first reported. ThequaiTel between -Butler
on the one hand and Hale of Maine and
Kasson on the other, was the bitterest that
has occurred in a caucus in many years, if
ever. When Kasson threw out his insinu
ation about the. ten thousand dollars, But
ler rose in a l-age and said that no man
who stood branded as a seducer and a vio
later of his marriage vows should be per

who is Zach. Chandler's son-in-law, rose to
nrotest against such unseemly personalities.

among which is chairmanship of Engrossed

The Democrats are allowed the chairman
ships of two committees, namely: Private
Land Claims and Engossed Bills. The
Liberal Republicans have signified a wish
that the Republicans do not class them as
Democrats, and will accept such places as
may be assigned them on committees by
the caucus. Senator Sumner will, it is
said, to-night, be appointed on a com

member of the contemplated new com

Mr. Morrill argued .at length in favor of
the resumption ol specie payments, and
urged upon Congress the necessity of legis

said, wedded to any special plan, but
favored that proposed by a prominent
financier of New York, that the Secretary

the holder; requiring banks to keep a moi

will pay its notes in cash in New York;
authorizing the government to negotiate a
loan of $200,000,000 in coin at 0 per cent.
per annum; the certificates, as last as re
funded, maybe paid out by the Secretary

the government. He hoped soon to submit

NORTH CAROLINA.
State Iloinls Guaranteed by Special
Tax.
New York, Dec 3. The following pri
vate dispatch from one of the counsel em
ployed to conduct the suit of the holders of
the special tax bonds ot JNorth Uaroiina
against that State, was received this fore
noon:
"The special tax bond-holders have
gained a glorious victory. The bonds are
declared unconstitutional J An injunc
tion is refused only because no irreparable
linurv lias been sustained by the plamtuls.
It will undoubtedly be granted on the final
hearing.-'
rThe above is not clear. The bonds
were probably declared constitutional. In
1871 tne treasurer ot the state, unuer au
thority of .the Legislature, appropriated to
the general purposes of the government
$241,978.07, that had been collected to pay
the interest on the bonus Known as special
tax bonds. On Nov. 13 four bills in equity
were filed in the United States Circuit
Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina, praying that the Public Treasurer
be enjoined from paying any money out of
the Treasury until he has nrst replaced tne
above sum to the credit of the fund for
which the same was collected, for the pur
pose of providing for the payment of the m
tercst on the bonds held by the plaintiffs.
A preliminary injunction was granted by
Judge Bond, and Nov. 2S was set for the
hearing of the motion lor a special injunc
tion, the result of which after argument is
now announced by telegraph Union and

London, Dec 4, 5 a. m. The Times in

jausive privileges in regard to freedom
from search claimed tor vessels bearing the
American flag would confer immunity on
an open pirate. Such pretensions are in
deed short sighted for a mercantile
nation. We cannot for a mo
ment believe Congress will adopt
the suggestion to prohibit national banks
from paying interest on deposits. We do
not agree with the iTesident's finan
cial views generally, and think he is
rong in attributing the recent troubles to
the peculiar character of currency. The.

article praises the message for
its moderation of tone in general, and on
the Cuban question in particular. Eng
land will unreservedly support a policy
which requires that Spain must really as
well as nominally control Cuba. The
President's language concerning the Vir
ginius affair is moderate and dignified.
The Daily lelearann seems to regaru
the demand for the abolition of slavery iu
Cuba a menace which will greatly increase
the difficulties of Castelar's situation.
The Standard thinks the only result of

Republican Caucus on tlie Question
of Repealing tlie SalaryJral !".
From the Cincinnati Conunerci.il
WAsitiNOTON. Dec. 1. Tlie Republi
cans of the llouse held a caucus to-night to
deliberate and decide upon a policy with
regard to the repeal of the back pay and in
crease of salaries law. The attendance
was nuite full, and the proceedings, while
they were not embellished with the highly
personal order of remarks that characterized
the Democratic caucus ol baturuay nigiu,
were of a vcrv earnest and absorbing na
ture. It appears that it was thought ne
cessary to call this caucus m order, in the
first, place, to unite on sonic plan and
course of action; and, secondly, to head off
a lai-L'p. number ot virtuous gentlemen wno
are inclinedto be precipitate in reform. It is
not proposed mat tne giory oi iuuouuciug
a bill for the purpose indicated shall be
monopolized by any one individual, but
rathnr Is it thought best tliat it shall rc-
lnnnil to tlm credit of the whole party.
Mr. Eugene Ilale, of Maine, gave consid
pmldp nll'unsn to-dav when he notified the
House nf his purpose to introduce a bill to
morrow, or on the first opportunityto effect
tIiorpnpiil.ftsitwasinougiu.no was ioo
ambitious, if not a little selfish.
This being the state of affairs, there was
nothing to do to-night except, to agree upon
tlm nliiiw to be adopted, and the opposition
to the action was but feeble, although there
was considerable suppressed feoling, which
at times threatened to" break out in open
Knunhhlin?.
Hon. Thitler. backed by Roderick Random
Butler, from Tennessee, was recognized as
the leader ol tne anu-reptai liiuuun, .um
was noted with considerable surprise, that
tlm General did not display that nonciia-
laut and defiant swagger, while discussing
the nmiir. that he assumed when treating
it. in Arniiphusotls during the vacation. If
his convictions as to the' righteousness of
and the back-pay have not
changed, they certainly have as to the tem
per of the people. He was diginhed to a
iiorrreo therefore, last night, and only oc-
nliv he permitted his characteristic
stvle of debate to show itself, and then in
a modified style, n is aaiu mau ms .
disposed, in his remarks, to treat of Eugene
Hale as the son-in-law of his Kither-m-law,
and to otherwise disparage that young gen
tleman, but, on the. wliole, he curbed him
self in a manner tliat did exceeding credit
to his sagacity.
Ihrce of the six colored Representatives,
headed by Rainey, of South Carolina, made
a bold fight against any repeal, but while
they were heard in an indulgent and pat-
roiuzing way, the weight tliat was given to
what they said was not such as they would
have liked from the great Radical party.
Kassou, of Iowa, Tremain, of Xcw York,
and Hawley, of Connecticut, were promi
nent m urging the policy ot repeal. It was
put to tlie humanity of the caucus that in
any action that might be had, nothing ought
to "be done that would rellect at all upon
many truly good but misled gentlemen, not
now members of Congress, who took their
back pay and invested it in a judicious
manner, ureat circumspection was urgcu
in this regard. The final result was the
appointment of a committee, consisting of
Messrs. iasson, llale, ot Maine, Iremam,
Butler, ot Massachusetts, and lhonias, ol
Xorth Carolina, to prepare a bill reducing
the salaries to $5,000 a year, due regard be
ing paid to such a restoration ot the lrank
ing privilege and documents and garden
seeds, and provision being made to secure
au allowance for postage and for other pur
poses, stationery and mileage, as will bring
the pay up to the amount received by mem
bers of the Forty-first Congress, which will
substantially set it back at the old figures.
lhe bill is to be reported to-morrow, it
occasion offers, if the time is not taken up
with questions of privilege. Blame will
innounce the moninig hour, and the cauoi
States will be Iiad. 11ns will give llale
the opportunity to introduce the bill. In
case he should die, however, to-night, the
outlook for the Republican party woidd be
very gloomy, as an unregenerate Democrat
from New Hampshire, the next State to be
called, would most undoubtedly grasp the
situation, aud introduce a bill lnmselt.
Tins, however, was fully considered, and
the contingency provided for by the adop
tion of a resolution submitted by Mr. Kel-
lev. of Pcnnsvlvania, that all othcrthanthe
lull shall oe at once reierreu to tne juuici-
arv Committee. Onlv two or tlirec faint
votes were heard in the negative when final
action was had.
From the Cincinnati Gazette.
Washington. Dec 1 At a call of fif
teen members the Republicans held a three
hours caucus on the salary bill, resulting
in the adoption of the following:
"llesolved. That the act oi tne .hi oi
March. 1873. so far as it increases the sala
ries of members of Congress, and of certain
oflicers and employes of the two houses
onsrht to be repealed.

phairman. to whom all the propositions of-

fered this evening shall ue reierreu, anu
who shall report a suitable bill- to be pre
sented to the House at the earnest opponu
nitv."
Maynanl was m the chair, and Mr. dun-
ckel Secretary. A committee was appoint
ed in accordance with the resolution. It
was composed of Messrs. Kasson, Hale
Butler. Tremain, and liionias, oi xoun
Carolina. The debate was nmiteu to nve
minutes. About tlurty-hve propositions
were offered, but many covered the same
irround.
JUr. Hale wanteu an expression oi me
caucus that the salary of members should
be repealed, and to-morrow, according to
his notice to-day, he. would press his bill
Mr. Kasson wished both the salary
of
members and the 15 per cent, voted em

repeal of the act and the allowance on mile

the reduction take effect on the 4th of

Mr. Kcllev moved to refer everything to
the Judiciary Committee as the more suit
able committee, and provided that no mem
ber should be compelled to vote on any pro
position affecting repeal, till this committee

lillis 11. itODCrts wanted a consiuuuouai
amendment providing that no measure
would be made retroactive hereafter.
The debate was lively, but there was no
unusual wrangling. Xearly all the .south
ern members favored the retention of tho
present rates, as did a number of those who
voted for and took it fropi other sections.
Gen. Xegley spoke in favor ot keeping tho

Messrs. Tremaine, Garfield and Scofield

Among the new members from lhe Xorth
there was a strong seutiment in favor of the
repeal, though comparatively few took an
active part in tlie debate. The caucus w.03
