ANNUA E ME
OF
PRESIDENT R. B. HAYES,
QELTYEttED TO COXGRKSS DE-
CEMBER 1st, 1879.
FEIAOW CITIZENS of tbe Senate and Hoaac of
ttonresentattvcs: The members of tbe Forty*
tixth Congress have assembled in tbe tint reg
ular aeuion, under circumstances calling foe
mutual congratulation and grateful acknowl
edgment to the giver of all good, for the Urge
and -universal measure of national prosperity
which we now enjoy. The moat interesting
svouta which have occurred in our public af
fair* since in last anuttal message to Congress
ate connected with the financial operations of
tbe government directly affecting the business
interests of tho country.
THE ItESOAIPTION ACT.
1 congratulate Congress on the successful ex
ecntion of the resumption act at the time
Used and in tbe manner contemplated by law.
The notea of the United Statca began to be re
deemed in coin since the 1st of Junuary last,
and they have been promptly ledeemed on pre
sentation and in business transactiona, public
and private, in all parta of tbe country. They
are received and paid ont as the equivalent of
Coin. The demand upou tho treasury for
gold and silver in exchange for United States
notes has been comparatively smaller and
the voluntary deposits of coin and bullion in
exchange for uotea have been very large. The
excess of precious metals deposited or ex
changed for United States notes over the
amount of United States notes redeemed, is
abont 940,000.000. The resumption Of specie
payment has been followed by a very great re
vival of business. With a currency equivalent
in value to the money of the commercial world,
we are enabled to enter upon equal competi
tion with other nations in trade and produc
tion. The increasing foreign demand for our
manufacturers and agricultural produefs has
caused a largo balance of trade in our favor,
which has been paid iu cold from the 1st of
July last to November 15 to tbe amount of
about *59,000,UOU.
IlKFUNMNO 0P£1UT10K».
Since the resumption of specie payment!
there has also been a marked and gratifying
improvement of the public credit, bonds of
the government bearing only four per cent, in
terest have been sold at or above par sufficient
in amount to pay off all the national debt
which was redeemable under the present laws.
The amount of interest saved annually by tbe
prosess of refunding the debt since March 1,
187", is 1-1.297,177. The bonds sold were
largely in small sums, and the number of our
citizens now holding public securities is much
greater than ever before.
The amount of tho national debt which ma
tures within less tban two years is $792,121,
700. of whioh 5500,000,000 bear interest at
tbe Tate of live per cent, and the balance is in
bouds bearing 0 per cent, interest. It is be
lieved that thin part of the public debt can be
refunded by the issue rf 4 perut. bonds, and by
tbe reduction of interest which will thus be
effected, about $ 10.0U0.0U0 can bo annually
«aved to the treamuy.. To secure this import
ant redaction of interest to be paid by the
United States further legislation is required,
which it in hoped will be provided by Congress
during the present session.
(10LD AND SII.VEB COINAGE.
The coinage of gold by the mints of theUnit.
ed States duriug tho la.it fiscal year was 400,
986,915. The coinage of ailver dollars since
the passage of tbe ant for tbat purpose, report
ed Nor. 1, 1879, was S45.000.-S50, of which
913,700,311 have been issued from tbe treasury
and are now in circulation and $32,000,500 are
still in tho possession of the government. The
pendency of tho proposition for unity of ac
tion before tho United States and the principal
commercial nations of Europe to effect a
permanent system of equality of
gold and silver in the recognized
money of tbe world, lends me to recommend
that Congress refrain from new legislation on
the general Kubject. The great revival of trade,
internal and foreign, will supply during the
coming year ill own instructions which may
well b( naaited before attempting further ex
perimental roe:i8ures with tbe coinage. 1
would, however, strongly urge upon Congress
tbe importance of authorizing the secretary of
the treasury to suspend the coinage of silver
dollars upon tho present legal ratio. The mar
ket value of 1 he silver dollar being uniformly
and largely leas than the market value of the
gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to
maintain them at par with each other if both
are coinid without limit. If tbe cheaper coin
is forced into circulation, it will, if coined
without limit, soon become the solo standard
if value, and thus defeat the desired object,
which is a currenoy of both gold and silver
which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for
dollar, with the universally recognized money
of tbe world.
ItETTOEMENT OF LEOAL TENDER*.
The retirement from circulation of United
States notes with the capacity of the legal ten
der in private contracts is a step to be taken in
onr progress toward a safe and stable currency,
which should be accepted as the policy of the
government and the interest and security of
tbe people of it. It my firm conviction
that the issue of legal tender money, money
based wholly on the authority and credit of tbe
government, except in extreme emergency, is
without warrant in the constitution and a vio
lation of sonnd financial principles. The issue
of United States notes dnring the late civil
war with the capacity of legal tender between
private individuals was not authorized except
an a menus for rescuing tho country from immi
nent peril. The circulation of these notes for
paper money for any protracted period of
time after tbe accomplishment of this urpose
was sot contemplated by tbe framera of the
law under which they were issued. They an
ticipate the redemption and withdrawal of the
notes at tbe earliest practicable period consist
ent with the attainment of the object for
which they were provided. Tbe policy of the
United Siatca steadily adhered to from the
adoption of the constitution has been to avoid
the creation of a national debt, and v.'hen from
necessity in time of war, debts have been cre
ated, they have been paid off on return of
peace as rapidly as possible. With this view,
and for this purpose, it is recommended that
existing laws for tho accumulation uf a sinking
fund sufficient to extinguish the pnblie debt
within a limited period, be maintained. If
any change of the objects or rates of taxation
is deemed necessary by Congress it is suggested,
experience has shown, a duty can be placed on
tea and coffee, which will not enhance the
price of those article* to the consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars an
nually to the treasury.
MORMONI8M.
The continued deliberate violation, by a large
number of prominent and idn lential citizens of
She Territory of Utah, of the laws of the United
States for tbe prosecution and punishment of
polygamy, merits the attention of every de
partment of the government. Tbis Territory
baa a population sufficient to entitle it to ad
mission as a State. Tbis important change
will not, however, be approved by the country
while tbe citizens of Utah, in very considera
ble numbers, uphold a practice which ia con
demned as a crime by tho laws of all civilised
communities throughout the world. The law
for the suppression of this offense was enacted
with unauimitybyCongreas more (ban seventeen
years ago, but baa remained nntil recently a
dead letter in the Territory of Utah because
of the peculiar difficulties attending, its en
forcement. The opinion widely prevailed
among eitisens of Utah tbat the law was in
contradiction of the constitutional guarantee
of religious freedom. This ebjeetion ia now
removed. The supreme conrt of the
United States has decided tbe
law to be within tbe legislative
power of Congress, binding as a role of notion
for all who ruaide within the Territories. There
ia no longer any reason for delay or hesitation
in its enforcement. I should bo firmly and ef
fectually executed. If not sufficiently stria
gent ia the provision*, it should bo amended,
VOLUME VIII.
and In aid of the purposes in view, I recom
mend mora comprebensionand more searching
methods for preventing as well as punishing
*bia crime, be provided. If necessary to secure
obedienoe to law, tbe enjoyment and exercise
of the rights and privilege* of citizenship in
the Territories of the United States may be
withheld or withdrawn from those who violate
or oppose the enforcement of law on this sub
ject.
raOTXOTIOH OV TUB BAlXOT.
The elections of the past year, though occu
pied only with 8tat« offices, have not failed to
elicit in political discussions which attended
them all over the country new and decisive evi
dence of tbe deen interest which tbe great body
of citizens Uke in the progress of the country
towards a more general and complete establish
ment, at whatever cost, of universal security
and freedom iu the exercise of the elective
franchise. While many topics of political con
cern demand gieat attention from our people,
both iu tho sphere of national and State au
thority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion
I expressed in my last annual message, that no
temporary or administrative interests of the
government, however urgent or weighty, will
ever displace the seal of our people in defense
of the primary rights of citizenship, and that
the power of publio opinion will override
all political prejudices, and that
all sectional end State attachment
in demanding that all over our wido territory
the name and character of citizen of the United
States ahsii mean one and the saiue thing and
carry with them unchallenged security and
respect. I earnestly appeal to tbe intelligence
and patriotism of all good citizens, of every
part of tbe country, however much they may
be divided in opinion on other political sub
lets, to unite in compelling obedienoe to exist
ing laws aimed at the protection of
tbe right of suffrage. I respectfully
urge upon Congress to supply any defects in
these laws which experience has shown and
whieh it is within ita power to remedy. I
again invoke the co-operation of the executive
and legislative authorities of States in tbis
great purpose. am fully convinced that if
tbe public mind can be set at rest on tbe para
mount question of popular rights, no serious
obstacle will thwart or delay the complete
pacification of the country or retard the gen
eral diffusion of prosperity.
OlVn, BEHVIOE BKTOBM.
In a former message I invited the attention
of Congress to the reformation of the civil
service of the government, and expressed an
intention, transmitting to Congress as early as
practicable, a report upon tbis subject by the
chairman of tbe eivil serviee commission. In
view of the fsct, during a considerable period,
the government of Great Britain has been deal
ing with tbe administative problems and
abuses in various particulars analogous to
those present* in this country, and that in
recent years the measures adopted were under
stood to have been effective and in every re
spect highly satisfactory, I thought desirable
to have fuller information upon the subject,
and accordingly requested the chairman of the
civil service commission to make a thorough
investigation for tbis purpose. Tbe result has
been an elaborate and comprehensive report.
Tbe report seta forth the history of the parti
san spoil system in Great Britain,and of the rise
and fall of tbe parliamentary patronage and of
official interference with the freedom of
elections, shows that after long trials of
various kinds of examinations, those which are
competitive and open on equal terms to all,
and which are carried on under the superin
tendence of a single commission, have with
great advantage been established as the con
dition of admission to almost every official
place in the subordinate administration of
that country and of British India. The com
pletion of the report, owiag to the extent of
the labor involved in its preparation, and the
omission of Congress to make any provision
either for the compensation or tbe expenses of
the commission, has been postponed until the
present time. It ia herewith transmitted to
Congress. While the reform measures of an
other government are of no authority to us,
they arc entitled to influence to tbe extent
to whioh their intrinaic
wisdom and their adaptation
to our constitutions and social life may com
mend tbem to our consideration. The views I
have heretofore expressed concerning tho de
fects and abuses in our civil administration,
remain unchanged except in so far as an en
larged experience has deepened my sense of
tbe duty, both of officers and of tbe people
themselves, to co-operate for their removal.
Tbe grave eTils and perils of a partisan spoils
system of appointment to office, aud of the of
fice tenure, are now generally recognized. Iu
the resolutions of the great parties, in reporta
of departments, in tbe debates and proceed
ings of Congress, tho messages of executives,
the gravity the evils has been admitted. To
command the necessary support every measure
of reform most be based on common right and
justice, and must be compatible with the
ht-althy existence of great parties which are
inevitable and essential in a free State.
When people have approved a policy at a
national eleotion, confidence in the officers they
bate selected and tbe advisers who, in accord
ance with our political institutions should be
consulted as to the policies whioh it is their
duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It
is eminently proper they should explain to the
people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the
performance of their official duties. It hardly
need be pointed ont tbat very different con
siderations apply to tbe greater number of
those who fill the subordinate places in the
civil service. Their responsibility is to their
superiors in official position. It is their duty
to obey tbe legal inatruotiona of those upon
whom that authority is devolved, and their
public service consists in the discharge
if their functions irrespective of par
tisan politics. Their duties are the
nunc whatever party is in power, and what
ever policy prevails. As a consequence, it
follows tbat their terms of officio should not
depend upon the prevalenoe of any polioy or
the supremacy of any "party, bnt should be de
termined by their capacity to serve tbe people
most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan
interests. The same considerations tbat should
govern tbe tenure, should also prevail in the
appointment, discipline and ramovol of those
subordinate, The authority of appointment
and removal is not a perquisite wbieb
may be used to aid a friend
or reward a partisan. but ia
a trust to be exercised in the public inter
sat. The only just ground of discrimination
is the meaaure of character and capacity be haa
to make that service most useful to tbe peo
ple, except in cases when upon just and recog
nized principles, it is upon the theory of pen
sions, offices and promotion are bestowed as
Towards for past services. Their bestowal no
on any theory wbich di«regards personal merit
ie an act of injustice to the citizen, as well aa a
breech of that trust subject to whioh the ap
pointing power is held.
In the light of these principles, it becomes
of great importance to provide just and ade
quate means, especially for every department,
or a large administrative office where personal
discrimination on the part of the head ia not
practicable for ascertaining those qualifications
to whioh appointments and removals should
have reference. To fail to provide each means
is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer
taining facts npun which the mmt' righteous
claims to office depend, but of necessity to
dUcoanige all worthy aspirants by
handing over appointments and removals
to mere influence and favoritism.
If fit is the right of the Woithiest claimant to
gain the appointment, and tbe interest of the
people to bestow it upon him, it would seem
clear that a wise and jnst method of ascertain
ing personal fitness for office must needs be an
important and paramount, function of every
wine and Inst government.
It baa long since become impossible in the
great offices ..a those having the duty of nom
ination and appointment to personally enquire
into the individual qualifications of more tban
a small proportion of those seeking office, and
with the enlargement of the civil servioe, tbat
proportion must continue to become less. In
the earlier years of the government the subor
dinate offices were so few in number that it
was quite easy for those making appointments
and promotiona to personally ascertain the
merits of the candidates. Party managers of
methods bad not then become powerful agen
sies of coercion, hostile to the free and just
exercise of the appointing power.
A large and responsible part of the dnty of
restoring the civil service to the desired purity
and efficiency rests on the President, and it haa
been my purpose to do what ia in my power to
advance such prudent and gradual measures of
reform aa will most surely bring abont the rad
ical change of system essential to make onr ad
ministrative methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. By a proper exercise of an
thority it is in tbe power of the executive to do
much to promote such a reform, and it cannot
be too clearly understood that nothing adequate
can be accompliabed without co-operation'
on the part of Congress, and
a considerate and intelligent 'sup
port among the people. Beforme whieh
eba lenge tbe generally accepted theories of
parties, and demand changes ia methods of
departments, are not tbe work of a day. Their
permanent foundations must be laid in sound
principles and iu an experience which demon
strates their wisdom, and apuaca the eriora of
their adversaries. Every woithy officer desires
to make his official action a gain and honor to
bis country, bnt the people themselves, fat
more than their officers in public station, are
interested in a pare, economical aud vigorous
administration.
By laws enacted in 1853 and 18.15, and now
in substance incorporated in the revised stat
utes, tbe practice of arbitrary appointments to
the subordinate grades in the departments was
condemned, and examinations as to rapacity,
to be conducted by departmental I* »rds of ex
aminers, were provided for snd made condi
tions of admission to the public servioe. These
statutes are a decision by Congress that exam
inations of some sort as to attainments and
capacity, are essential to the well being of the
publio service. The important questions since
the enactment of these laws have been aa to
the character of these examinations, and
Whether official tavor and partisan influence, or
common right and merit, were to control ac
cess to the examinations in practice. These
examinations have not always been open to
worthy persons generally, who might wish to
be examined. Official favoritism and partisan
influence, aa a rule, appear to havo
design tied those who slone were
permitted to go before the examiuing board,
subjecting even tbe examiners to a pressure
from tbe friends of tbe candidates very difficult
to resist. As a consequence the standard of ad
mission fell below that which the public inter
eat demanded. It was also almost inevitable
that a system which provides for various boards
of examiners with no common supervision or,
uniform measure of procedure should result in
confusion and inadequate testa of capacity
highly detrimental to the public interests. A
further and more radical change waa obvioualy
required.
In the annual message of December, 1870,
my predecessor declared tbat "there is no duty
which so embarrasses the executive and heada
of departments aa that of appointments, nor
is there any Buch arduous and thankless labors
imposed on Senators and ltepresentatives as
finding puces for constituents. The present
system does not secure the best men and often
does not fit men for publio places. The eleva
tion and purification of the civil service of tne
goiernment will be hailed with approval by
ine whole people of the United States."
Congress accordingly passed the act ap
proved March 3,1871, to regulate the civil ser
vice of the United States aud promote tbe ef
ficiency thereof, giving the necessary authoii
ity to tbe executive to inaugurate a civil ser
vice reform. Aoting under the statute, which
was interpreted as intending to secure a system
of just and effectual examinations under uni
form supervision, a number of eminently com
petent persona were selected for the pur
pose, who entered with zeal upon
the discbarge of the dutiea pre
pared,' with an Intelligent appreciation of the
requirements of the service and regulations,
and who, in their capacity a-i a board, have
been known as the civil ser rice commissioners.
Congress for two years appropriated the money
needed for the compensation and for tbe
expense of carrying on the work
of the commission. It appears from the re
port of the .mmission submited to the Presi
dent in April, 1874, that examinations had
been held in various sections of tbe country,
and tbat an appropr ation of about $25,000
wonld be required to meet tbe annual ex
penses, including the salaries involved. Tbe
report was transmitted to Congress by special
message on April IS, 1874, with the following
favorable comment upon the labors of tbe com
mission: "If sustained by Congress, I have
no doubt the rules can, after tbe experience
gained, be to improved and enforced as to still
more materially benefit the public service and
relieve the executive, members of Cungrcssand
the heads of departments from iuiinences prej
udicial to good administration. Tbe rules, as
they have hitherto been enforced, have result
beneficially aa is shown by the opinions of
tbe members of the cabinet and their subordi
nates in the departments, and in that opinion I
concur."
And in tbe annual message of December of
the same year similar viewa are expressed,
and an appropriation fur continuing the work
of the coinmission again advised. The appro
priation waa not made, and as a consequence
the active work of the commis-uoneis was sus
pended, leaving the commission itself in ex
istence without the means therefor of causing
qualifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or of securing for tbe public service
I he advantages of competition upon any ex
tensive plan.
I recommended in my annual message of
December, 1877, tbe making of an appropria
tion for the resumption of the work
jf the commission. in tho meantime,
I owevcr, competitive examinations umler
muny embarrassments, have been conducted
witbin limited spheres in the executive de
partments in Washington and in a number of
the custom bouses and pnstoffioes of tho prin
cipal cities of the country, with a view to fur
ther test their effects, aud in every inatauce
have been found to be as salutary as they arc
stkted to be under the administration of my
pr deccsaor. 1 think the economy, purity and
efficiency of the public service would be
greatly promoted by their systematic intro
duction, wherever practicable throughout the
entire civil service of. the government, togeth
er with ample provision for their general
supervision, in order to secure consistency and
uniform justice.
Reporta from tbe secretary of the interior,
from the postmaster general, from the post
master in tbe city of New York, where suck
examinations have been for some time on trial,
and also from the collector of the port, the na
val officers and tbe surveyor in that city, and
from the postmasters and collectors in several
of the other large cities, sh JW that tbe competi
tive system, where applied, has in varions
ways contributed to improve tbe public service.
Tho reporta show that the results have been
salutary in a marked degree,
and tbat a general application
of similar rules cannot fail to be a decided
benefit to the service. The reports of the gov
ernment officers in the city of New York es
pecially, bear decided testimony to the utility
of open competitive examination in their re
spective offices, showing tbat these examina
tions and tbe excellent qualfications of those
submitted to tbe service through them have
had a marked effect upon the persona previ
ously in the service, and particularly upon
thi so aspiring to promotion. There has been
on the part of the latter an increased
interest in tbe work and a desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond the par
ticular desk occupied, and thus the morale of
the entire force bas been raised. The examina
tion have been attended by many citizens, wbo
have had an opportunity to thoroughly investi
gate the scope and character of the tests, and
the method of determining tbe results, and
those visitors have without exception approved
the methods 'employed, and several of tbem
have publicly attested their favorable opinion.
Upon such consideration I deem it my duty
to renew tbe recommendation contained in my
annual message December, 1877, requesting
Congress to make the necessary appropria
tions for the resumption of the work of the
civil service commission. Economy will be
promoted by authorising a moderate compen
sation to pt-rsons in tbe public service wbo
may perform extra labor npon or under the
commission, as the executive may direct. 1
am convinced that if a just and adequate teat
Of merit is enforced for ad mlwion to tl.e pnb
liC serviee in making promotions, such abuses
as removals without good oause, and partisan
and official interference with the proper exer
cises of the appointing power, will iu a large
measure disappear.
There aie other administrative abuses to
which the attention of Congress should be
asked in tbis connection. Mere partisan ap
pointments and the constant peril of iemoval
without cause, very naturally lead to an ab
sorbing and mischevions political activity on
the part of those thus appointed, which net
only interferes with the due discharge of official
duty, out is incompatible with the freedom of
elections. Not without warrant in tbe views ol
several of my predecessors in the Presidential
office, and directly within tbe law of 1871 al
ready cited, I endeavored by regulation made
on tbe 23dday of June, 1877, to put some rea
sonable limits to auch abuses.
It. may not be easy and it may never, per
haps, bo necessary to define with precision the
proper limit of political action on the Dart of
federal officers, but while their right to hold
and freely express their opinions can not be
questioned, ilia very plain tbat they should
neither be allowed to devote to other subjects
the time needed for the proper discharge of
their official duties, nor to use the authority of
their office to enforce their own opinions or to
coerce the political action of those wbo bold
different opinions. Reasons of justice and
public policy, quite analagous to those which
forbid the use of official power for the oppres
sion of the privatexitizen, impose upou the
government the duty of protecting ita officers
and agenta from arbitrary exactions.
In whatever aspect considered, the practice
of making levies tor party purposes npon tbe
salaries of officers, ia highly demoralizing to
the public serviee and discreditable to the
country. Though aa officer should be aa free
as any other oituen from using his own money
in aidofhia opinion or bis party, be should
els/ be aa free aa any other citizen to
FREE THOUGHT,FREE SPEECH AND A FREE PRESS.
WORTHINGTOX, NOBLES COUNTY. MINNESOTA. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 4. 1879.
refuse to _make auch gifts. If salaries
are but a fair compensation for time and labor
of the officers it ia gross injustice to levy a tax
upon them. If they are made excessive in or
der that they may bear a tax, the excess is in
direct robbery of the public funds.
I reocommend therefore suoh a revision and
extension of the' present statutes as shall se
cure to those in every grade of official life or
public employment, tho protection with which
a great and enlightened nati should guard
those wbo are faithful in ita service.
FOXttiaK KELATIOHS.
Our relations with foreign eonnries have con
tinued peaceful. With Gre.t Britain there are
still.unsettled questions growing out of tbe
laws of the maritime provinces, and tbe action
of provincial authorities, deemed to be in dero
gation of rights secured by treaty to American
fishermen, the United 8tatea minister iu Lon
don haa been im-trocted to present a demand
for $10,630,502 in view of damage* received by
American citizens at Fortune Bayou the 6th
day of January, 1878. Tbe aabject haa been
taken into consideration by tbe British
government and an early reply is an
ticipated. Upon the completion of
the necessary preliminary examicationa the sub
ject of our participation in the provincial fish
eries ss regulated by treaty will at once be
brought to the attention of the British gov
ernment with a view to an early and permanent
settlement of the whole question, which was
anly temporarily adjusted by the treaty of
Washington.
Efforts have been made to obtain the remov
al of restrictions found injurious to the ex
portation of cattle to tbe United Kingdom.
Some correspondence haa also occurred with
regard to the rescue and saving of life and
property upon the lakes, which has resulted in
important modifications of the previous regu
lation of tho dominion government on this sub
ject iu the interest of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of
the last session of Congress, commissioners
were appointed to represent the TJuitcd States
at the two international exhibitions in Aus
tralia, one of which ia now in progress at Syd
ney and the other to be held next year in Mel
bourne, a desire has been expressed by mer
chants and manufacturers interestedfin the im
portant and growing trade with Australia, tbat
an increased provision should be made by Con
gresB for the representation of our industries at
the Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the
subject iu respectfully submitted to your
favorable consideration.
The assent of the government has been given
to the landing on the coast of Masaaohveetta of
a new and independent trans-Atlantic cable
between France, by way of the French island
St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any fu
ture legislation of Congress on the subject.
The conditions imposed before allowing con
nection with our shores to be established, are
auch aa secure its competition with any exist
ing or future lines of msrine cable,
and preclude amalgamation therewith, and
provide for an entire equality of rights to onr
government and people with those of France in
the nae of the cable, and prevent any exclusive
possession of the privilege aa accorded by
France to the disadvantage of any uturr cable
communication between France and the United
States which may be projected and accom
plished by our citizens.
An important reduction of the present
rates on cable communication with
Europe, which is felt to be too burdensome to
tne interests of our commerce, must necessarily
It.«- from tbe establishment of tbit competing
lipe. The attention of Congress waa drawn to
the propriety of some general regulation of
Congress of the whole subject of transmarine
cables by inv predecessor, in his message of
December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to
Tour consideration the importance of Con
gressional action in this matter.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain growing out of the incidents of tbe
Cuban insurrection, have been, for the most
part, happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably be anticipated that the commission
now sitting in Washington for the decision of
private ca*os in tbis connection, will soon be
able to bring its labora to a conclusion.
Tho lone standing question of East Florida
claims has lately been renewed aa a subject of
correspondence and may possibly require Con
gressional action for ita final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlanda with respect
to consular .-ights and privileges similar
those with oi her powers, has been signed and
ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged
on tbe 31st of July last. Negotiations for ex
tradition treaties with the Netherlands and with
Denmark arc now pending. Some questions
with Switzerland in regard to pauper and con
vict emigrant* have arisen, but it is not doubt
ed that they will be arranged npon a just and
satisfactory basis. A question has also occur
red with respect to an asserted claim
by Swiss municipal anthorities to exercise
tnlilago over persons and property of Swiss cit
IXHIIN, uaturslized in tbis country. It ia possi
ble this may require adjustment by treaty with
the German empire. Frequent qnestiona arise
in connection with the subject of naturaliza
tion and expatriation but the imperial govern
ment has constantly manifested a desire to
strictly maintain and comply with all treaty
stipulations in regard to tbem.
In consequence of the omission of Congress
to provide for a diplomatic representative at
Athena, the legation to Greece has been with
drawn. There ia now no channel of diplomatic
communication between the two countries and
the expediency of providing for one in some
form is submitted to Congress. The relatione
with Anstria. Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey,
and Belgium continue amicable and marked by
no incident of especial importance. A change
of the personal head of the government of
Egypt has taken place. No change, however,
haa occurred in the relations between Egypt
and the United Btiites. The action of tbe
Egyptian government in presenting to the city
of New York one of the ancient obelisks which
possess such historio interest, is highly appre
ciated at. a generous mark of international re
gard. If prosperity should attend tbe enter
prise of its transportation across the Atlantic
its ereotion in a conspicuous position in
the chief commercial city of the nation, will
bo soon accomplished.
JAPAN AMD CBTOA.
The treaty made between Japan and the
United States in regard to the revision of
former commercial treaties it ia now believed
will be followed by similar action on the part
of other treaty powers. The attention of Con
gress is again invited to the subject of the
indemnity funds received some yean since
from Japan and China, which, with tbe ac
cumulated interest, now amount to consider
able snms. If any part of the fnnda ia
justly due to American citizena they should re
ceive it promptly and whatever may have been
received by this government in excess of strictly
just demands, should in some form be returned
10 the nations to whom it equitably belongs.
The government Of China has signified ita
willinguess to consider the question of the emi
gration of its subjects to the United States
with diplomatic fairness and to co-operate in
snvh measures as may tend to prevent inju
rious consequences to the United States. The
negotiations are atill proceeding and will be
pressed with diligence.
A question having arisen between China and
Japan about tbe Lew Chew islands, tbe United
Btates government haa taken measures to in
form these powers o£ ita readiness to extend
its good offices for the maintenance of peace if
they shall mutually deem it desirable and find
it practicable to avail themselves of the
proffer.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
It is a gratification to be able to announce
that through the judicious and energetic action
of the military commanders of the two nations
on each side of the Bio Grande, under the in
(.truciions of their respective governments,
raids and depredations have greatly decreased,
and in tbe localities where formerly most de
structive have now almost wholly ceased. In
view of this result, entertain a confident ex
pectation tbat the continuance of this preva
lence of quiet on the border will soon become
so assured aa to justify a modification of tbe
present orders to our'military commanders as
to crossing the border, without encouraging
such disturbances aa would endanger the peace
of the two countries.
The third installment of the award against
Mexico, nnder the claims commission of July
4, 1868, was duly paid, and haa been put in tbe
course of distribution in pursuance of the act
of Congress providing for the same. The sat
isfactory situation between the two countries
leads me to anticipate an expansion of our
trade with Mexico and an increased contribn
tion of capital and industry by onr people tc
tbe development of the great resources of thai
conntry. I earnestly commend to the wisdom
of Congress tbe provision of suitable legists,
tion looking to this result.
EXXUnUO O* COLUMBIA.
Diplomatio internjurse with Columbia is
again fully restored by the arrival of a minister
from tbat country to tbe United States. This
is especially fortunate in view of the fact that
the question of an inter-ooeanie canal has re
cently sssnmed anew and important aspeetaad
is now under discussion with the Central Amer
ican countries, through whose territory the
oanal, by the Nioaragua mate, wonld have to
pass, it is trusted that enlightened States
manship on their part will see that the early
prosecution of such a work will hugely enure
to the benefit not only of their own citizens
snd those of the United States, bnt of the com
merce of tbe civilized world. It is not doubted
that should the work be undertaken under the
protective auspices of the United States, and
upon satisfactory concessions for the right of
*ay and security by tbe Central American
government, the capital for its completion
WJUld be readily furnished from this conntry

'ailing, prove inaccessible

Diplomatic relations with Chili have also
been strengthened by the reception of a minis
ter from tbat conntry. The war between Peru
Bolivia and Chili still continues. -The United
States have not deemed it proper to interpose
iu the matter farther than to convey to all tbe
governments concerned tbe evidence that the
friendly offices of the government of the United
States for the restoration of peace upon an hon
orable basis wilt be extended in case tbe bellig
er •ntrahall exhibit a readiness to accept tbem.
Cardial relatione emtioue with Brazil and
th Argentine republic, and trade with those
countries is improving. A provision for regu
lar and more frequent mail communication in
our own ships between the ports of this country
and tbe nationa of South America seems to me
to deserve tbe attention of Congress as an essen
tial precursor of an enlargement of our com
merce with them, and an extension of onr car
ryiag trade.
A recent revolntion in Venezuela has been
followtd by tbe establishment of a provisional
government. This government bas not yet
been formally recognised, and it is deemed de
sirable to await tbe proposed action of the
people, which is expected to give it the sanc
tion of constitutional forms.
A navd vessel haa been seat to tbe 8amoan
islands to make surveys and take possession of
the privileges ceded to the United States by
Simoa in the harbor of Pago Pago. A almg

UOCMANIAAND SRBVIA.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with Bonmania and Bervia, now become inde

Consideration and is a subject of diplomatic
aorrespondence.

There is a gratifying iuoreasj of trade with
nearly all European and American couutries,
and it is believed that by judioious ae'.ion iu re

more enhanced, and tbat American product*
and manufactures will find new and expanding
markets. The reports of diplomatic and con
sular officers npon this subject under the sys

much valuable information which been
and will continue to be laid before Congress
and the publio from time to time.
ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with Russia of
March 30, 1867, by which Alaska was ceded to
the United States, provides that tho inhabi
tants of the ceded territory, with the exception
of nncivilized native tribe*, shall be admitted
to the enjoyment of all rights of citizens of
the United States, and shall be maintained and
protected in tho free enjoyment of their lib
erty, prosperity and religion. Tha uncivilized
tribes are subject to such laws and regulations
as the United States .may from time to time
adopt. In regard to the aboriginal tribes of
that country, both the obligations of the treat}
and the necessities of the people demand that
some organized form of govcrumeut over the
territory of Alaska be adopted. Tbi-re appear*

THE TBEASUBV.
Tbe attention of Congress is cA'e to the
annual report of the secretary of the treasury
on the condition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues fium alt
sources for the fisc 1 year end
ing June 30, 187'J were $273,827,184 40
The ordinary expenditures for
the same period were 26C,U17,883 53
Leaving a aurplus revenue for
the year of 6,879.300 98
The receipts for the present fiscal year ending
June 30, 1880, actual ai.il estimated, are aa fol
lows:
Actual receipts for first qintter
commencing July, 1373 79,813,663 61
Estimated receipts for remain

And tbe •"stimMi.'d ordmarv

The large amount expended for the arrears
of pensions dnring the last and the present
fiscal year, amounting to f21,747,249.60, baa
prevented the appropriation of tbe full amount
required by law to the sinking fund for tbe
current year, but these arrears having been
substantially paid, it is believed that the sink
ing fund can hereafter be maintained without
*ny change of the existing law.
THE WAR DEl-ARTMKNT.
Tb secretary of warfreportn that the war|de-
Junee
srtment estimates for tbe lineal vear ending
SO, 1881, are 140,880.428.93,' tbe ssme
being for a less sum of money than any annual
estimate rendered to Congress from that de
partment dnring a period of at least twelve
years._ He concurs with the central of the
array in recommending sneb legislation us .will
authorize the establishment of the full numbei
of 35,000 men for the line of the army, exclu
sive of 3,463 men required for detached duties,
aud therefore not available tor -i-rvit-e io tbe
field.
He also recommend* Uioi Con^reKt be s.^krd
to provide Mi* .I.- ,.,-..,
large|number of nl±mJo'i-.t u.iiiisty pc.^t»
and reservations which, though very valuable
in themselves, have .bi.cn rendered uaeioM
for military purposes by the advance of civili
zaticn and settlement.
He unites with the quartermaster general in
recommending that appropriations be made fot
the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire
proof building for the ssfe storage of a vast
amount of money, accounts, vouchers, clsims
and other valuable reporta now in tbe quarter
naster general's office and exposed to great
risk and to total destruction by fire.
He also recommends, in conformity with the
views of the judge advocate general, some de
sultory legislation in reference to tbe military
statute of convictions as applied to the crime
of desertion.
In these several recommendations I onnenr.
The secretary of war further reporta tbat the
work for the improvement of tbe south pass of
the Mississippi river, nnder contract with
Mr. James B. Eads, msde in pursuance of an
act of Congress, has been prosecuted
during the past year with a greater.meaaure of
success in the attainment of the results tbsn
during any previous years. The channel
through the South Pass, which at the begin
ning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth
of only seven and one-half feet of water, had,
on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of
twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than
200 feet and a central depth of thirty feet.
Payments have been made in accordance with
the contract, as the work has progressed,
amounting in the aggregate to (4,250,000. and
further payments will become due as provided
by tbe statutes, in event of success in main
taining the channel now secured.
Tbe reports of the general of the army and
hie subordinates present a full detailed ac
count of tbe military operations for the sup
pression of hostilities, and praises are justly
awarded the omeera and troops engaged, for
the promptitude, skill and eotuage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost un
broken peace and quiet on the Mexican fron
tier, and. there is reason to believe the efforts
of tbis government and of Mexico to maintain
order in that region will prove permanently
successful.
The department was enabled during the past
year to find temporary though croaded ac
sommodation and safe depository for a portion
its records in the completed east wing of
Ihe building, designed for the state, war and
navy departments. The construction of the
north wing of the building, the part of tbe
structure intended for nse of the war depart
ment, ia being carried forward with all pos
sible dispatch, and the work should receive
from Congress snch liberal appropriations ss
will secure its speedy completion.
THK NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy shows
sontinned improvement in tbat branch of the
icrvioe. During the last fiscal year extensive
repairs have been made on vessels and two new
ships have been completed and made ready for
sea. Tbe total expenditures,ended June30,1879,
including specific appropriations not esti
mated for by the department, were 91,353,
571.09. The expenses chargeable to the year,
after dedusting the amount of the specific ap
propriation, were 113,343,317.79. But tbis is
subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that
amount having been drawn upon warrants, but
not paid ont during tbe year. The amount of
appropriations applied to the but fiscal year
was *14,533,646.17. There was therefore a bal
ance of 1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended
aid to tbe credit of the department on June 30.
1879.
Tbe estimates for the fiscal year endinit June
30,1881, are $14,864,147.93, which exceeds the
appropriations for the present fiscal year $301 ,
SS7.28. The reason for this inoreaae is ex
plained in the secretary's report. The appro
priations available for the present fiscal rear
are $14,502,850.07. which will, inltbe opinion of
too secretaty, answer all the ordinary demands
of tbe service. The amount drawn from the
treasury from July 1st to Nov. 14,1879, was
•5,770.404.12, of which $1,095,440.33 has been
refunded, leaving as the expenditures for that
period $4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of
the remaining two-thirds of the year do not
exceed the proportion for these four months,
thtre will remain unexpended at the end of
the year $477,859.30 of current appropriations.
The report of the secretary shows the
gratifying fact that among all tbe disbnrsing
officers of the psy corps of the navy, there is
not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a
aingle dollar. I unite with him in recom
mending the removal of the Observatory to a
more healthful location. That institution re
flects credit upon the nation and has obtained
the approbation of scientific men in all parts
of the world. Its removal from ita present lo
cation would not only be conducive to the
health of its officers and professors, bnt wonld
greatly increase its usefulness.
DEPARTMENT OF JCSTICB.
The appropriation for judicial expenses which
has heretofore been made for the department of
justice in gross was subdivided at the last ses
sion of Congress, and no appropriation what
ever was made for the payment of the feea of
marshals and their deputies, either in the sen
vice of process or for the discharge of other du
ties, and since June 30 these officers have con
tinned the performance of their dutiea without
compensation from the government, taking
npon themselves the necessary incidental out
lays, as well as rendering their own services.
In only a few unavoidable instances has the
proper execution of process of the United States
failed by reason of the absence of the requisite
appropriations. This couise of official conduct
on the part of these officers, highly creditable
to their fidelity, was advised by the at
torney general, wbo informed them, how
sver, that they would necessarily have
to rely for their compensation upon the pros
pect of future legislation by Congress. I
therefore especially .-ecommend that an imme
diate appropriation be made by Congress fox
this purpose.
The act making the principal appropriation
the department of justice at previous.ses
lions bas uniformly contained the following
clause: "And for defraying the expenses which
may be incurred in the enforcement of the act
approved Feb. 28, 1870, entitled an act to
amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled
an act to enforce the right of citizens in the
United States to vote in the several States of the
United States, and for other purposes, or any
acta amendatory thereof or supplementary
thereto."
No appropriation was made for this purpose
for the current year. As no general election for
members of Congress occurred, the omission
was a matter of little practical importance.
Such elections will, however, take placa during
the ensning year, and the appropriation for the
pay of marshals and deputies should be suffi
cient to embrace compensation for the serviced
they may be required to perform at such elec
tions.
TH28UPBBMB OODBT.
The business of the supreme court is at pres
ent largely in arrears. It cannot be expected
that more cases can be decided than are now
dispose! of in the annual session, or that by
any assiduity the distinguished magistrates
who compose the court can accomplish more
than ia now done. In the
Courts of many of the cironits the business
has increased to such an extent
tbat the delay of justice will call the attention
of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It ia
believed all is done in each circuit which can
be fairly expeeted, and the evils arising from
delay are less heavily felt by the United States
than by private suitors, as ita causea are ad
vanred by the courts when it is seen that they
involve tho discussion of questions of a public
character.
The remedy suggested by tbe attorney gen
eral is the appointment of additional ciicuit
judges and tbe creation of an intermediate
coutt of errors and appeals, which shall relieve
the supreme court of apart of its jurisdiction,
while a larger force is also obtained for tbe
performance of circuit dutiea. I recommend
tbis suggestion to the consideration of Con
gress. It would seem to afford a complete
remedy and would involve, if ten additional
circuit judges ore appointed, an expenditure at
the present rate of salaries of not more than
$60,000 a year, which would certainly be small
iu comparison.with the obj?cts to be attained.
THK FOSTOFTICE.
The report of the postmaster general bears
testimony to tbe general revival in business
throughout the country. The receipts of
tbe postbffice department for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1879, was $30,041,982.86, being
$764,465.91 more than in the preceding year,
and $2,3S7,559.23 more tban in 1877. The ex
pendituie* of the department were $S3,44S,
8U9.45, of which tbe sum of $376,46l.6J was
paid on liabilities incurred in preceeding yean.
The expenditures during the year were $801,
209.77 less than in the preceding year. This
reduction is to be attributed mainly to the ope
ration of the law passed on June 17, 1877,
chauging the compensation of postmasters
from a commission on the valus of stamps sold,
to a commission »n the stamps cancelled.
The amount drawn from the treasury on ap
propriations, in addition to the revenues of
the department, was $303.454.PS. being $3,
'-76,197,86 less than in the proceeding yi-ar.
The expenditures of the fiscal year etiding
June 30, 1831, are estimated at £o9.0'20,0il0,
ud the receipts from ail r-ourccs at $33,210,
COJ, leaving a dehcieucy to bn appropriated for
out of tho treasury of $7,710,91)0.
The relations of the department with tbe
railroad companies have been harmonized,
notwithstanding tho general reduction by
Congress of their compensation by the appro
priation for general facilities, nnd the railway
postoffice lines havo been greatly extended, es
pecially in the Southern States.
The interests of the railway mail service
wonld be greatly promoted and the expendi
tures cou.'d bo readily controlled by the classi
fication of the employes of the railway mail,
as recommended by the postmaster general.
The appropriations for servises with respect to
which tbe maximum limit is already fixed by
law to be made in gross.
The postmaster general recommends an
amendment to tbe law regulating an increase
of compensation for increased service and in
creased speed on Star routes so as to enable
him to advertise for proposals for snch in
creased service and apeed.
He also suggests the advantages to accrue to
the commerce of the country from the enact
ment of a general law authorizing contracts
with American built steamers carrying the
American flag for transporting tbe mail be
tween the United States and porta of the West
Indies and South America at a fixed maximum
per mile, the amount to be expended being
eqnalated by annual appropriations in like
manner with tbe amonnt for the domestic Star
service.
The arrangements made by the postmaster
general and the secretary of the treasury foi
the collection of duties upon books received in
the mail from foreign countries has
proved so satisfactory in ita practical opera
tion that the recommendation is now made that
Congress now extend the provisions of the set
of March 3, 1879, nnder which this arrange
ment was made, so as ,to apply to all other
NUMBER 14.
dutiable articles received iu the mails froi
foreign countries.
THB mOIAKS.
The reporta of the secretary of the interior
and of tbe commissioner of Indian affairs, set
ting forth tbe present state of onr relations
with the Indian tribes and onr territory, tbe
measures taken to advance their civilisation
and prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them, will be found of more tban
ordinary interest. Tho general conduct of
our Inaisn population bas been so satisfactory
that the occurrence of two diatnrbances which
resulted in bloodshed and destrnction of prop
erty, is all the more to be lamented.
The history of the outbreak on the White
River Ute reservation, Western Coloiado, has
become so familiar by elaborate report in the
public press, that ita remarkable incidents
need not be stated here detail. It is ex
pected that the settlement of this difficulty
will lead to snch arrangements aa will prevent
further hostile cot fliota between tbe Indiana
and the border settlements in Western Col
oiado.
Tne other disturbances occurred at the Mes
celaro Agency in New Mexico, where Nieland,
the head of a small band of marauders, after
committing many atrocities, being vigorously
charged by a military force made his way
across tbe Mexican border and ia now on a for
sign soil.
while these occurrences, in which compare
lively small numbers of Indians were engaged,
are most deplorable, a vast majority of our In
dian population have fully justified the expec
tation of those who believe that by humane
and peaceful influences, the Indians
can be led to abandon the habits
of savage life, and to develop
a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.
What tbey bave already accomplished is shown
in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical
Work. The remarkable success which has at
tended tbe experiment of employing as freight
era a class of Indians hitherto counted among
the wildest and moat intractable, and the gen
eral and urgent desire expressed by tbem for
the education of their children, may be taken
as sufficient proof that they will be found ca
pable of accomplishing much more if they con
tinte to be wisely and fairly guided.
The Indian policy, sketched in the report of
the secretary of the interior, the object of
which is to make liberal provisions for the
education of Indian youths, to settle tbe In
dians upon farm lots in severalty, and to give
them title in|fee on their farms inalienable
for a certain number of years, and when their
wants are thus provided, to dispose of by sale
of lands on their reservations, not occupied
and used by them, a^ fund to be formed out
of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians,
which will gradually relieve the government of
the expenses now provided for by annual
appropriations, must commend itself as jnst.
and beneficial to tbe Indisns and is calculated
to remove those obstructions which the exist
ence of large reservations presents to tbe set
tlement and development of the country.
I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment
of a law enabling the government to give Indi
ana a title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five
years, to the farm binds assigned to them by
allotment. I also repeat the recommendation
in my first annual messsge that a law be passed
admitting Indiana who can give
satisfactory proofs by their own
labor of supporting their familiea for
a number of years, and who are willing to de
tach themeelvea from their tribal relations, to
tbe benefit of the homestead act, and to grant
them patents containing the same provision of
inalienability for a certain period.
The experiment of sending a nnmber of In
iian children of both sexes to ike Hampton
normal and agricultural institute, in Virginia,
to receive an elemementary English education
and practical instruction in farming and other
industries, bas led to results so promising tbat
it was thought expedient to turn over the cav
alry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to
the interior department for the establishment
of an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has now 158
pupils, selected from various tribes
and in foil operation. Arrangements are also
made for the education of a number of Indian
boys and girls belonging to tribes on tbe Pacific
slope in a similar manner at Forest Grove in
Oregon. These institutions will commend
themselves to the liberality of Congress and to
the philanthropic munificence of the American
people.
Last spring information waa received of the
organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, the object of which was In
occupation by unauthorized persons of certain
lands in the Indian country ceded by the Chero
kees to the government for the purpose of set
tlement by other Indian tribes. On tbe
29th of April I issued a proclamation warning
all persons against participation in snch an at
tempt and by the co-operation of a military
force the invasion was promptly checked. It
is my purpose to protect the rights of the In
3ian inhabitants of that Territory to tho full
extent of the executive, but it wonld be un
wise to ignore the fact that a Territory so
large, and with a population so sparoe, and so
great a wealth cf unused resources, will be
found more exposed to the repetition of
such attempts aa happened this
year, when the surrounding States are more
densely settled, and the westward movement
of our population look still more eagerly for
fresh lauds to occupy. Under such circum
stances the difficulty of maintaining tbe In
dian territory in its present state will greatly
inorease, and tho Indian tribes inhabiting it
would do well to prepare for such a contin
gency. I therefore fully approve of tbe advice
Riven to tbem by the secretary of the interior
on a recent occasion to divide among them
selves in severalty as large a quantity of their
lands sa they can cultivate, to acquire
individual title in fee instead of the present
tribal ownership in common, and consider in
what manner the balance of their lands may
be disposed of by the government for their
benefit. By adopting surh a policy tbey would
more certainly secure themselves in the vslne
of their porsessions and at the same time pro
mote progress in civilization and prosperity,
than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present
state of things in the Territory.
The qnestion whether a ebange in the control
of the Indian service should be made was in
the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint
committee of both Houses for inquiry and re
port In my last ann al message I expressed tbe
hope that a decision of that question, then in
prospect, would arrest further agitation of
this subject, snch agitation being apt to pro
duce a disturbing effect npon the service as
well aa tbe Indians themselves. Since then,
the committee having reported, the
qnestiona have been decided in
tbe negativo by a vote in tbe Honse
of Representatives. For the reason here stated
and iu view of the fact of further uncertainty
on this point, will be calculated to obstruct
otber much needed legislation, to weaken the
discipline of tbe service and to unsettle salu
tary measures now in progress for the govern
ment and improvement of the Indisns,I respect
fully recommend that the decision arrived at
by Congress at its Isst eession be permitted tc
stand.
TIMBKK THEFTS.
The efforts made by the department of the
interior to arrest tbe depredations on the tim
ber Urds of the United States have been con
tinned and have met with considerable sncccca.
A sargc nnmber of cases of trespass have been
pro'ecuted in the courts of the United States.
Others have been settled, the trespassers offer
ing to make payment to the government for
the value of timber taken by them. The pro
ceeds of prosecution and settlements, being
turned into tbe treasnry, will exceed the
amount of the sums appropriated
by Congress for tbe purpose. A more im
portant result, however, consists in the fact
that the destruction of our public forests by
depredation, although such oases still occur,
baa been greatly reduced in extent, and it ia
possible, if tbe present policy is vigorously
pursued and sufficient provision to that end
made by Congrens,snch trespasses, at least those
on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed
except in the Territories where timber for tbe
daily requirements of the population cannot
under the present state of the law be easily ob
tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten
tion of Congress to the recommendation made
by the secretary of the interior that a law be
enacted enabling the government to sell tim
ber from tbe public binds without conveying
tbe fee, where snch lands are
principally valuable for tbe timber thereon,
snch sales to be so regulated as to conform to
domestic wants and business reqnirements.
while at the same time guarding against a
sweeping reduction of the forests. The enact
ment of snch a law seems to become a more
pressing necessity every day.
THB AOBIODLTDBAI, BUBKAU.
My recommendations in former messages are
renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of
the department of agriculture. Agriculture ia
the leading interest and the permanent indus
try of our people. It is to the abundance of
agricultural productions, as compared with
our home consumption, and the largely in
creased and highly profitable market abroad
whieh we have enjoyed in recent
years, that we are mainly indebted

for our present prosperity as a people We
must look to its continued maintenance for
substantial resource. There is. no branch of
industry in which labor directed by scientific
knowledge yields snch increased production in
comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch
of the-publio service to which tbe encourage
ment of liberal appropriationa can be more
appropriately extended. The ommission to
render such aid is not a wise economy, but on
the contrary, undoubtedly results in the
losses of immense sums annually, that
might be saved through well-directed
efforts by the government to promote this vi
tal interest. Tbe results already accom
plished with the very limited meana heretofore
placed at the command of the department of
agriculture is an earnest of what may be 'ex
pected with increased appropriations for the
several purposes indicated in the report of the
commissioner. With a view to placing the
department npon a footing whioh will enable
it to prosecute more effectively
the objects for which it is
established appropriations are needed*
for a more complete laboratory for the estab
hshrnent of a veterinary division and a division
of forestry and for an increase of force. The
requirements for these and other purposes in
dicated in the report of the commissioner, nn
der the head of immediate necesaitiea of the de
partment, will not involve any expenditure of
money tbat the country cannot with propriety
now undertake in tbe interest of agriculture.
BDUCATION.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau of
education the extent to which educational
privileges throughout the United States havt
been advanced during tbe year. No more fun
damental responsibility rests in Congress than
that of devising appropriate measures of finan
cial aid to education, supplemental to local
action, in the States and Territories, and in
the District of Columbia. The wise fore
thought of the founders of oui
government has not only furnished
the basis for the support of the common school
lystems of the newer States, but laid the foun
dations for tbe maintenance of their universi
ties, and of colleges of agriculture and me
chanic art. Measures in accordance with this
traditional policy for the further benefit of all
these interests and the extension of some ad
vantages to every portion of the conntry it is
hoped will receive your favorable considera
ble.
THE CAPITOL LIBRARY.
To preserve and perpetuate the national
literature should be among the foremost cares
of the national legislature. The library
gathered at thecapitol still remains unpro
vided with any suitable accommodations for
ita rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude
and importance of the collection, increased at
it is by the deposits under the laws of copy,
right, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and
by the scientific library of the Smithsonian
institution, call for building accommodations
which shall be at once adequate and fire proof.
The location of snch public buildings, which
should piovide for tho pressing nece-sities of
the present and for the vast increase of the
nation's books in the future, is a matter which
addresses itself to the discretion of Congress. It
is earnestly recommended as a measure which
should unite all suffrages and which should no
longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commission, created by the act of
Congress of August 2nd, 1876, for the purpose
of supervising and directing the completion of
the Washington national monument, of which
commission the President is a member, baa
given careful attention to tbis subject, and al
ready the strengthening of the foundation
bas so far progressed aa to insure
the entire success .f this part of
the work. A massive layer of masonry bas
been introduced below the oricinal foundation,
widening tbe base and increasing the stability
••f the structure, rendering It punnibl.: to carry
the shaft to mpletion. It is earnestly rec
ommended that such further appropriation be
maac for the continued prosecution of the
W 8
for the completion
of this natiocal monument at an early day.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion
to recommend to Congress the adoption of a
generous policy toward the District of Colum
bia- The rt of ihe commissioners of the
strict, herewith transmitted.-contain consid
erations Bnd recommendations to all of
which I earnestly invite careful attention.
I ask early nnd favorable consideration
of the views which they express sa to the urgent
need of legislation for the reclamation of the
marshes of tbe Potomac and its eastern branch
within the limits of the city, and for the re
pair of the streets of the capital heretofore laid
with wooden blocks, and by delay reudered
almost impassable, and a source of imminent
danger to the hearth of its citizens. The
means at the disposal of the commissioners are
wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of
these important works, and should be supple
mented by timely appropriations from tbe
federal treaaury.
The filling of the flats *n front of tbe city
will add to the adjacent lands and parks now
owned by tbe United States a large and valu
able domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reim
burse its entire cost, and will also, as an in
cidental result, secure the permanent improve
ment of the river for the purpose of naviga
tion.
Tbe constitution has invested Congress with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over tbe
Dit-ttict of Columbia. Its eitizens must of
necessity look to Congress alone for all needful
legislation affecting their interests and as the
territory of this Distriot is the common proper
ty of the people of the United States who,
equally with its resident citizen*, are Interest
ed in the prosperity of their capital. I can not
doubt that you will be am ply sustained by the
general voice of tbe conntry in any measure
yoa may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration of
Congress to the wants of the public schools of
this District, aa exhibited in the report of the
commissioners. While the number of the pu
pils is rapidly increasing, no adequate pro
vision exists for a corresponding
increase of school accommodation,
and the commissioners are without
the means to meet this urgent need. A nnm
ber of the buildings now used for school pur
poses are rented, and are in important particu
lars unsnited for tbe purpose. The cause
of popular education in tbe District of
Columbia is surely entitled to the
same consideration at the bands
of tbe national government sa in the several
States and Territories, to whieh munificent
grants of the public lands bave been made fox
the endowment of aehools and universities.
ROTHKUFORD A S
Executive Mansion, Dec. 1st, 1879.
A Shot it an Incoming Dock.
To stop an incomer," raise the gun
carefnlly in the line of his flight move
qnickly ahead of the duck, when yon
judge him to be in range and, when
you lose sight of head and bill over
your gun, pull instantly. Theflightof
a duck is ordinarily at the rate of about
sixty miles an hour but, when acceler
ated by fear, or a brisk wind, or both,
it is nearly double, and must be experi
mented upon to be fully appreciated.
To become a good pass shot," some of
the requisites are: to be able to judge
distances quickly and accurately to be
able to cover well the moving bird, and
not to check the motion of the gun at
the moment of discharge. Because it
is necessary for most men to hold some
distance ahead of swiftly-flying game in
close range, it does not follow that this
is the best thing to do it shows,
rather, that such a one is in the habit of
checking or arresting entirely the mo
tion of his piece as his finger presses
the trigger. Most sportsmen flinch
at that supreme moment, and, unless
the habit is entirely overcome, they
cannot expect ever to become good
wing shots. The "choke boring" of
guns, in limited nae long ago, has only
very recently come into favor and
rather more general use. Upon the
paw or elsewhere, it adds at least one
fourth more distance to the killing
range of the gun. This ia done by the
effect it baa npon the "pattern made
by the shot, causing the gun to throw a
greater number of shot pellets into a
given circle than can be done by the
oylinder, or straight bore. One barrel
of the duck-hunter's gun should surely
be bored in thismanner.—C A Zimmer
