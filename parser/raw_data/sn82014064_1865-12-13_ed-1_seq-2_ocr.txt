MEXICO.
According" to tbs despatches from Wash
ington, .yesterday, the. Mexican question is
assuming -considerable importance. It has
been anticipated since the close of the rebel,
t, tlon that with the mooting of Congress the
pent up Indignation of the conntir would find
public expression. Hence we are not at lib
erty to be surprised by any number of resoln.
lions -and calls lor information brought for
ward in Senate or House on the subject of
the French usurpation in Mexico. That any
of these movements wOi lead to armed inter
ference on our part, may well be doubted.
The Executive branch of the Government,
whDe firmly-protesting against the" crime
committed by Napoleon and MazimllUan, is
firmly opposed_lo any crusade at the present
lime to rescue the sepulchre of republicanism
in Mcrico from the.,hands.of. the infidels. If
a war against Maximniian had been com
menced immediately after the surrender of
Lee’s army it would have been enthusiasti
cally sustained by the people, and might
have been ended, so far as tbe possession of
Mexico is concerned, In three months.' But*
that time bos passed. The army is In great
part disbanded. A huge nalioual debt con
fronts us. Tbewotmds of our civil war are
not healed. Public sentiment has under-'
gone a change, and we find ourselves asking,-
what should wc do with Mexico if we had ex-?
polled the freebooters ?
Ajnore infamous crime was never perpe
trated-than that which tbe French P™jw.^ r '
consummated when Us legions entered the
capital of Mexico. Perfidy-and cruelty hare
gone hand in hand from the Convention of
La Soledad down to the present hour. If
there ever was, or ever con be, a just cause
for the United States to draw the sword in a
foreign territory that cause exists at the pres
ent limeln Mexico. If wc w-ere prepared for
another war,'reasons for commencing it
would be plenty enough. But in the
existing state of our finances, and tbe uncer
tain mood of the Southern people,
whose friendship wc cannot count upon from
one day to another, and whose enmity wc
might encounter in any severe trial of onr
strength, It seems little short of madness to
thlntof plnnging into 'a new war for any less
cause' than our national preservation. It is
not necessary that we should recognize the
government o! the usuipers, which is yet far
from being established upon a sure founda
tion. If we have financial difficul
ties to r perplex. ns M«rimtii«n ho*
more embarrassments of that kind thnn wc.
If .have. ,a-disaffected population to deal
with, -he has three rebels to onr one, and
Napoleon is not so'secure of home support in
his Mexican* enterprise as he might be. The
attitude of the United States is sufficient to
keep the flame of republicanism burning in
Mexico. The time will come when we can
adjnsl our account*-with the Invaders of our
sister republic, but that time is not now.
men FREIGHTS—THE BKfffny,
The people of the Northwest are rousing to
action. 4)0 tbe enbjoct of railroad freights.
Fanners’ convention* are in session, and an*
nounced in various sections of tbe country,
andwhatever action a.matured and nnped
public opinion sna y deem necessary will ulti
mately be taken. It is agreed tw *h
. y* -• wm- roads between
Chicago and tbe Mississippi are outrageous.
For instance, goods brought from Cleveland,
Ohio, to Chicago, five hundred miles, for
thirty cents a hundred, are charged fifty cent®.
a hundred for the hundred miles from Chi
cagotbßelolt.'Tbereisonof the difference is
simply, that between Cleveland and Chicago
there is competition by water withlhc rail-,
roads,' jrbDeßelolt is dependent on the rail-'
roads' alone. Freights from Pittsburgh to
Chicago—-about six hundred miles—are lower
tlxanlrom Chicago to Sterling, a -distance of
eighty ..miles .-by the Dixon Air Line. Al
though the Ohio Hirer forms no means of
direct communication with Chicago, yet It
undoubtedly serves by Its competition- to
cheapen all railroad freights westward from.
Pittsburgh. -----
But tbe most manifest instance of the effect
of competition between water routes and
railways la seen in tbe fact that the Illinois
CcuU«li»*ow*«r(xin*v'’hcal fmm Dabnquo
to St| Loots, and delivering It at St. Louis fbr
the sane price—twenty cents a bushel—as
the same road, with its connections, charges
for bringing It to Chicago, about one-fourth
the distance. The extra low .rates between
Dubuque .and. St-- Louis are of course owing
solely to the competition of the Mississippi
rivcr,vhile the extra high'rates between Du
buque and Chicago are owing to the absence
of any efficient competing water communica
tion. It ,«m be -seen, therefore, that the
farmers of the entire reglonof Illinois and
Wisconsin lying between Lake Michigan and
the Mlsrissiopi, ’as well as those ©f
lowa, Nebraska and Minnesota, have a
direct personal interest In opening efficient
water communication between the Mississippi
Hircrand Lake Michigan. • This win benefit
them not one-tenth as much by tbe amount of
freight they will send through by water as by
the reduction it would cause la railroad
freight on all roads between Chicago and the
Mississippi Bivcr. But whatever interest the
Northwest Las In such a water highway the
East -bos equally. The manufactures and
merchandize of the Bast can only And their
waylo the tanners upon whom these extor
tions arc practised by paying the same high
rates of freight as the Armen pay on their
produce.. New York, NcwEngland andPenn
sylvanla, and all our railways going
ward, have antnterest identical with that of
Chicago and the Northwest in cheap water
communication between the Mississippi and
Luke Micklpm.. Thi* MUWlshca ana our
westward railway* would all reduce tielf I 1
freights within a.month.
Nature by supplying ns with the IlUnois
river has done much to famish us with gn?h a
channel- The State, in the Illinois and Mich
igan canal, marked out nearly, thirty years
ago, the route which Mississippi freight
might be made to pursue, without rendering
it actually available. For weeks atatimetbc
route hi blocked by low water In the Illinois
nver, which needs to be navigable. The pro
ject of widening and deepening the |,tn,1 i too
has been before the people too long, and has
secured too universally the support of the
leading minds of tbe State to need any addi
tional advocacy Irom us. To perfect oar
water communication with the Mississippi,
is to reduce . our , .Westward ' ran
road freights to one-third their present
figure. The savinc of the people at
large in a tingle year would pay the expenses
of the improvement. But untU onr westward
roads arc made to compote with swift, sure
and cheap water communication, what practi
cable mode of controlling railroad freights is
open to the people*. The establishment of
new railroad lines will end in new consolida
tions, and wfll thus afford only an expensive
and temporary relief. .The directors of our
railroads are chosen by the year; very many
of them own but httle stock In gieyoads they
control, and their highest ambition is to.
make their road earn the highest profits for.
the present year, without regard to the next.
“ Alter.us the drlngc,” ( is their motto. If
they do not kill the goose outright to get the
golden'rggs, they pluck 4t to tbe last pin
feather, so that Its death is a moral certainty.
There are but two remedies for ..the
cvQ, one to require the . directors -to
be stockholders to a larger amount and tor a
longer term than are now required, tbe oilier
to improve and perfect alack water navi
gation of the Illinois River and to complete a'
ship canal therefrom to Chicago. ■
This done and there. .Is no whatever
Wby the trade of .the forced
through Chicago by the war, should : be
diverted to Bt. Louis In aflr degree whatever.'
no more to be compared
with toe Great as a channelof commu
nication with the markets of the world than
a heavy dew is to be compared with the Mis
slsrippi. Chicago, as the head of the system
of Lake navigation, needs only to be -con
nected with of the Upper.Missis
sippi tq increase her supremacy in the trade
and markets of the West. Lei our Fanners*'
Conventions everywhere take this view of the
subject Into consideration, and let the Board
of Trade and tbe people of Chicago give the
needed movements such .ah impetus as'shall
Irvciirg their success. - •

SCFFBiCE IN THE Blllßicr OF
• -■
A Wasbington-*Aksociat«d T*rear'despatch
states that Senator Wilson .presented thepe
- tltion of 2,sofrcolored citizens'of the District
.of Columbiaaskinglor-therightof etifrage*
Says tbe despatch V---- ; r '
The ueUtlonm set forth that a large proportion
of the colored atlrena of the District are property
holders and taxpayer. They claim that as they
are sufflclaitljr Intelligent to build and sustain
churches and institutions of leannng, and* to acco
ptuaic property,.they are■ competent to role; that
Tor years they hare been obliged not only to- edu
cate their own children, but to coutributs ‘to the
support of the schools Is which only white children
were taught; that tbe record of the colored people
as to crime and pauperism is as fair as that of any
other class in the country. Oat of a population Of
las than fifteen thousand, they seat four*thousand
five hundred soldiers Into tbe field, while lhe~while'‘
population oT-oversixfy-ihoosand : flimliil»(f only
r.n««thousand-; -and the colored .■Nldicn -rotaa
- leered without the Incentive or-huirebtrtmtiea.-«tw ■
or promotion.” . - - -- -
There are some telegraphic errors •in the
figures given. The blacks of the district
number about 20,000, and sent 3,500 soldiers
Into the field. -The whiles number,Co,ooo and
cent but 1,500 men to the field. The. white*,
sent morti metric the rebel than to the Uniori
array. The blacks famished *a>rn timet as
many men in proportion to members as* tbe
whites. The-whltes sent one man-to forty In
habitants. The blacks sent on? man to five
and a half inhabiUala.- And,-as the petition
sets forth, the fcolored~soldiers volunteered
without the Incentive of largo bounties, pay,
or promotion, bnt from-pure patriotism and
love of the Union, while the whites received
enormous bounties.
The petition of .the colored citizens, rets
forth other-good -reasons why th 6 suffrage
should he conferred upon them, besides that
of patriotic military .service. .They claim
that-as they are'jmfficlehtly intelligent to
build and sustain churches and school houses
and to accumulate property, they are also
competent to rote. For years tho blacks
have been taxed to educate the children of
Tfhtte people, while their,own childrenJmvh’
been‘cxdndbd from thefreoschools. And ni r
to crime imd^hpcriOT, w the'whiles furnished 1
a;larger per cent than the colored people.
Taken all together,-these certainly constitute
weighty reason* in favor- of -conferring -th e
franchise on them. Bat a majority of the
whites, of .the.-District strenuously-op
pose 'IL .Some *of them- .■go f so- far
aqto propose to surrender the city govern*
men! and charter, rather than let the colored
.citizens enjoy the elective franchise.
The while Republicans of Washington are
warmly in favor of colored suffrage. Ills the
'rebel and Copperhead population who so bit
terly object. If tbe blacks were enfranchised,
they could not rule the District, as they num
ber but one-fourth of the .population; hut
"they would vote the Republican ticket, and
% lhpr votes added to the white Republicans,
would constitute a majority, .aad_thcre is
where the shoe pinches. The Copperheads
and rebels rule the local government at
. IThe thousands'of clerks In'the De
partments aregencraliynot dtlzensofthcDls
trict, butoi the States whence.they,came,--
and, therefore, can not,vote at. charter elec-1
lions.
When the franchise is 'conferred on the
colored- citizens -about 3,500 votes will he
added to the Republican party, which will
enable it to cany the District. *
We do not see hojr any. member of Coa
gress, except Copperheads, can vote against
conferring, the* suffrage on the petloners.
They are cUisent as well as the whiles. They
art more law-abiding and fully as sclf sap-
IKfftiog. They are as moral and religious,
and if somewhat Inferior' in' point of -educa
tion, they arc decidedly superior In point of
lover for the Union and fealty to IhQ Cohstifu
tiqn. Itrfebard totmderstand tm what prin
ciples of right or Justice the 2 ; 003 surviving
colored soldiers _bdonging to the" District
.who have periled their lives and attested
thpir loyalty for the Union, shall be denied
the right of suffrage, while it is freely con
fared on * the 2,000 returned and *paro!led
rebels. Why should not this reinforcement
tojCopperhcadism be otf-scl by an equal re*
inforccmeut to Unionism ? There Is no Con
stitutional question in tbe way. Congress
preserves exclusive and unlimited Jans diction
over Ihcmatter; thcnlct justicebedone, and
that speedily.

Our Washington correspondent gives an In
teresting sketch of the progress of operations
in behalf of the freedmen In the States of
Pczmsylvania, Ohio and Maine, from which it
is eyidont that the cause has taken fast hold
of the popular heart. The writer’s most im
portant reference pertains to the nature of
Gen- Howard’s-forthcoming report from the.
Freedmen’s Bnrcau, presented bnt not yet
published. Jts most proniioeot feature has
tb.do with the suggestion of making the'
work in behalf of these unfortunate people
broad and stable by an adequate Government
appropriation. The writer states with confl
, dence that the recommendation of Gen. How-'
ard for an of Us Bureau
has received the endowment and a supple
mentary report of the Secretary of Wart. It
will not remove the necessity for the loyal
and humane to aid tbc cause with their at- -
most zeal, but it will give efficiency audbaek
bone to their operations. The experiments of
a season or two of free labor-fruriy tried in
tbe South, will set things working smoothly
in these new channels. Until only the
carciof the Commission'and its friends will
eave lhe freedmen from much suffering and
cruelty.
The Washington correspondent of the Cin
cinnati ComiMcrrie? says that the Secretary of
War gave orders to the telegraph offices in
Washington, Philadelphia and New York,
prohibiting them from transmitting any por
tion pf the President’s Message,’ or the ac
companying documents, prior to their pre
sentation to Congress. This is an entire mis
take- Onr own correspondent at 'Washing
ton ipqnircd at the telegraph office in that
city on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, prior
to thp organization of Congress, wnether any
such prdere had been received there, and was
answered in the negative in each Instance!,
The manager of tbe office stated, however,
that should refuse, upon Lis own respoosl
hOity.to sendany suchdispatchcsto thepreas,
on account of their! manifest .impropriety.
All, or nearly, all of the.newspaper corres
pondents in Washington endeavored to tele
graph portions of Gen. Grant’s report on
Monday, but foilied-to accomplish the “breach
of. faith,” because the'manager ” aforesaid
would not let them do so. . They then set up
a unanimous bowl against those newspapers’
which were a trifle more enterprising and sa
gacious than themselves. » ,
There has been no censorship of the tele
graph, other than that which the ofllcere of
the company have chosen to exercise, since
the close of the war., . •
A valued correspondent at Ottawa writes a
letter-, published elsewhere, on the subject ol
monopolies, in which the subject of
Government bonds Is incidentally discussed.
There are two sides to this question, if the
bonds of the - Government are made subject
in the future, to State and municipal taxation,
this fact will be taken into consideration by
the lenders, who.wlll require &' discount to be
made by the Government on their sale cor
responding to their’ apprehensions of the
amount of such taxation. It is doubtful,
therefore, whether anything would be gained
by .making >thcin subject to such taxation.
On the other hand,an clement of uncertainty
would be introduced into the market forGov
eminent securities, which could not fail to
have an unfavorable effect -upon the naHnnal
.credit- It is desirahle that the pdhlicdebt
should be held, as far ar possible, by our own
citizens, but, if the bonds are aubject'to State
■and municipal taxation, we, to effect, otter

TI»o Comlns Debate on tlie Btotu oftfae
Rebel State*—Appearance of the New
House of RepresenlaUres—Effect of
the President** message—Soda! As
pect* ol the Capital.
I From Our Own Correspondent.]
1 Wasmxorox, Dec. 8,1883.
Hie first subject of national import to be
taken up, thorough!/ discussed end disposd
of by Congress, will be the reconstruction
question in Us various bearings. All legtala
tion relating to the public finances. military
• and naval affairs, the PaciQc Railroad.'Xndian
affairs, and.other-important pnblle interests
.*HI be postponed until this grayest, most
; delicate and complicated task before the pres
ent Congress shall be lifted-from the ’shoul
dire bi national Taw-maEcre. The Senate, as
mentioned in my last, will in all probability
be immediately launched upon a protracted,
animated- Mid’ comprehensive ; discussion l of
. r tilts vital Topic when ihe House resolution
for the Committee on the Seceded States
comes up for consideration. It is expected
rthal the debate upon It will occupy the two
weeks, or rather ten working days, remaining
bdibre The adjournment over} the 1 holidays
Thc.Housq vrtmproWbly attend to-sxbordl-'
nate matters until the resolution is returned
the Senate—whiah It will surely be, in
amended form—when it will take up the
-whole reconstruction question and devote all
time and attention*to ilTmtil a floal solution
is reached in one way or another.' *
[There are already positive Indications that
the discussion of reconstruction matters, both
injihe Senate and House, will be of very great
duration. There is hardly a member of cither
body that has not views and- theories of Ms
own as to the wisest and safest inode of re
establishing therebel States-in' thelr former
status within the Union", and will - not bring
them before Cqngreas.in the ’formof.bills or
resolutions, an d enforce thielr real or supposed
consequence by ptp ormorc speeches.' Aper
fe«t deluge of Congressional oratory may be
looked for during the next eight br tea weeks.
The maze of political doctrines to be ad
vanced and remedies to be ■proposed, will no
doubt be so great as to render the progress'!©
ultimate conclusions very measured and slow.
-That the first half of the. sfesslon will be ab
sorbed by reconstruction legislation, seems
Almost certain. The great numerical prepon
derance of Republicans in both Houses will
render a rigorous display of opposition Im
practicable and deprive the debates of much
ofithelr usual spice and liveliness, so that I
would not be surprised: if, before mld-winter,
Jbe public pronounced the session doll.
} APrEAKAXCE OF THE HOUSE.
Theodtapodtlon of the Senate being almost
unchanged* to describe the appearance of its
members would be but to repeat on old story
to your readers.'As to the House, I have had
so | far but one-satisfactory opportunity to
take a survey of the physique of the members-
Bui even this one.view was sufficient to satis
fy me that the loyal' r pebple will hare no
occasion to feel ashamed of its representatives
on account of want of ability or unfaithful,
ness to duty. I would not venture to state
this by first impression," did I not know that
it was shared by intelligent and experienced
'observers, who have learned oftho new mem
bers as much as could be learned in the few
•days since the opening of the session. The
opinion of.all I have met, Indeed, is that a
more substantial,.respectable body of com
: mon sense, matter-of-fact men never sat in
thj south wing 0 f the capitol-
There are, it is true, . but. few
individuals of striking personal* "presence
ammig them. The species of “bandsomemen” :
Is very scantily represented, and those of the
'weaker sex whotrequent the galleries for the
purpose of admiring manlybeauty, will hare
a hard search for worthy subjects. However,,
looking down upon the floor of the House,
one cannot help noticing at once the unusually
large number of; finely formed, • intellectual
heads. The "majority of the faces bear au un
mistakable expression of sober thought, earn
est purpose, good sense: and self-possession
So eccentricities of personal, appearance, in
dicative of erratic,' unpractical ways, arc no
ticeable. The flashy -stylo of hair, whiskers
and dress, so much in rogue in the days of
Southern and Democratic preponderance in
tho halls of. Congress, are entirely wanting 1 . I
donot believe that the.public.wiU.beshocked
by. outbursts'bf violent passion, br cxhibl
liims of bad manners or vicious habits on the
floor of the House during this Congress. 'Al
together, the appearance, of.the Representa
tives ispre-caOnenUy plain and Republican in
the largest sense of the word, ; dnd the coun
try may thank Providence that it is so.
EFFECT OF THE EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS.
X have, delayed so-’ far any stafemeht" as to
the effect of the President’s Message and ac
companying documents upon the minds of
Cohmssmen. It ij nota .abject that can he
fully inveaugutM-ui « of time,'
and I preferred careful inquiry to hasty con
clusions. I have now ascertained the views
of iiu. t»«dto£ members of both Houses, and
feel warranted in saying that, bn the whole
the Message- has been -weU received and has
tie confidence oT Congress in
Oho Executive, While neither all the points
he makes In Ms opening argument astotho
relations of the Central Government to the
States, and vice re ra, nor Us recommenda
tions concerning the future of the Freedmen
are accepted as; CODclurive and satisfactory
the general tone of the message in .regard to
icconstroction has not proved distasteful.
.The passages upon ourforclgn relations are
universally commended. The reports of the
.Secretaries of War and the Treasury have
also given general satisfaction. Both the
President and the Secretaries mentioned have
bean called upbn.,and. congratulated-bya
lar£e number of Congressmen respectively •
upon the Message and the Reports since the

Opinions as to the extent of social gaieties
that may be expected in the Capital during
the winter are very much divided among the
best authorities on the subject. Some con
tend that we are to have a very dull season,
others that It will bemore brilliant than ever!
The number of high officials and-Congress!

cnliyenment of the dreary winter evenings is
not particularly large, but large enough to
realize moderate expectations; Among those
who will hold jugular receptions, and give
' occasional bails and soiries, are Postmaster
General Dennison, Secretary Stanton, Sen
ators Harris, Sherman and Morgan, Speaker I
Colffix and one or two other members. Noth- I

.THE MONOPOLY QUESTION
Railroad Extortions and Government
Bonds.
. Ottawa, December 10,15C3.
Editors Chicago Tribune; -
The next great political Isaac to be canvassed
I and decided in Illinois, and indeed throughout
| the great Northwest, evidently will be be
tween the people and the vast moneyed and
railroad monopolies by which the hard earn
ings of the working classes are absorbed, to
Tiao no harsher word, by those who “ toll not
neither do they spin.” And this contest will
not be confined to the Northwest, for’the
mechanics and factory'operatives of’New
York, Pennsylvania and New England are di
rectly Interested .In the.. question • and
will j enlist in the fight. The shoe
makers of Abington and Lynn, the weavers
of Lowell and Lawrence, as well as the iron
manufacturers and machinists of New York
and Pennsylvania arc the consumers of "West
ern liccf, pork, bnttcr, flour and wool, while
the West consumes their mannlactnres, and
every dollar added to the freight upon these
articles between the producer and consumer
above a fair price,ls an additional burden upon
both classes, which they are unable and ought
not to bear. The Interestsof an workingmen,
East and West, whatever their specific eml
ployment, are then Identical, and not con
flicting, and they should make common cause
against the great Bonking, Railroad and Com.
mcrelal combinations of the country, and hot
allow themselves to be.arrayed against each
other, thereby neutralizing their power and de
feating their common cause.. . The movements
lately Instituted in Morris and DcKalb, in
-Illinois, and' at Hudson, Wisconsin,’ and at
other points In the .West, are in the. right
direction and will go forward. Stealing and
swindling under cover of laws and charters
lobbed through the legislatures by stealth
and bribery will not be submitted to by the
lolling minions of the country much longer. :
The people have decreed the destruction of
slavery, which was a system of unblushing
robbery and-theft, directly perpetrated by
therjehand powerful against rthe poor and
defenceless under the sanctions of law and
religion. The'people : saw the iniquity
through the sham.defenoca of Bible and Con
stitution which were Interposed, and swept
away the rcftige of lies under which slavery
hid itself} and “vested .rights” of railroad
monopolies, which are so boldly put forward
as a defence to the wholesale robbery of the
fanners of the Northwest,' and the mechanics
of the East, will ere long, be where the
“Divine right's” ot slaveholders are. • Let not
the reader infer that the writer charges the
men who enjoy the huge fortunes, wrung out
cflho sweat of labor, by these monopolies,*
with being worse than other men—ail men
are alike. But the mischief Is, that by means
of these corporations, these “vested rights”
to rob and steal by wholesale, secured by
fraud and bribery at the hands of- those who
were chosen as the people’s representatives,

from the Northwest dare, on any pretence,
to rote another dollar of non-taxable bonds,

NUMBERING THE TRIBES.
From recent returns received at the Indian
Bureau, the'varioua tribes of the United States*
are estimated to represent a collective strength'
of 507,800 souls, of which number 6,400 arc
known to have been in the Federal service
during the late war. ■
•Of these 507,800 souls, It Is estimated
, that one-fifth, or 01,580, are warrisra, the
fighting men of the various tribes-The above
-estimate, however, Is based only upon those
tribes who have entered Into treaty stipula
tions with our Government. In addition to
‘ these, there are within the boundaries of the
United States tribes who never yet have made'
application for a hearing in Washington, and
adiare In the annuities annually distributed
: :to the Indians. Add these to those referred
to! above, and we may safely estimate the
whole-number of Indians within the United
j&atesnthalftf million (500,000) souls, or one
hundred thousand (100,000) warriors. How
beet to govern these people, ; and protect the
.Western settlements and routes of travel from
depredaUons, Is one of the great ques
tions of the dixy.
; DirroiENfa or VTEwsr
iThe people of the West whd have suffered
much during the last few years and arc Bill!

whole race u their only safety fi>r (he future.
•They take counselor their prejudices and
desire for revenge, which are
" ■ “More deaf than adders
. ! To the voice of any true decision.”
On the other hand the people of the East jrho
have never experienced'^ahy 'difScutles with'

J . r TUB SOUTH WEST COUNCIL.
1,- 1 ”. ? Connell lield with the South
I n est Indians, so ably-presided over by Judrro
Cooley, Commissioner of Indian Affaire, they
expressed themselves desirous of havinrr a
railroad built through their county, and upon
I the question of the emancipation of. the 6,000
negroes they had held as slaves, when, told
that the President had declared them free 1
and. hcrcatter it would be punished
W.- t0 enslave i - them,
did they, many, of onr Southern
brethren with all their boasted “ chlvaly and
nice sense of.honor,” refuse to accept os one
of the conscQuences of the defeat of the rebel'
I canie; the freedom of the slaves ? Did they
go qutand commence the cowardly assassina
tion and persecution of tbe blacks ? Did they
I compel r the attendance oi a United States
army and Freedmen’s Bureau to protect them
I from outrage; No I Quite the contrary.
( They told the Commission: “If our great
father atWasUngton says it Is wrong to make
these 6,000 negroes slaves, they are free. Wo
wUI give them of-our lands andol onr means.
We p iil protect them, and they may remain
with ns. Tell the great • father ■to send ns an
officer who will be just, and speak the troth,
and to him we leave the settlement of this
I matter, and wo will abide the Issue.” No
negro has been assassinated of even perse
cuted’by* their late'lndian masters. "They
have not even , been compelled to leave the
country or to appeal to any one lor protec
tion. How different it has been in the South !
GEK. EANBOBN’S MISSION.
Gen. John B. Sanborn has been, selected as
the representative of- onr government hi the
settlement of this question between the In
dians and the freedmen. He bas received bis
instructions and ’departed with a single staff
officer and clerk for the Indian country. He
did not even ask that an army might accom
pany him to enforce a settlement. He went
alone, and it is reasonably safe to predict that
he will be successful la bis mission. He has
to deal with Indians andnot with the “ South

j THE HUDSON BAT FUR COMPANY.
The Dodson -Bay Fur Company have had
much to do Kith the Indians of the For West
for the last .thirty or forty years, and yet they
harchad little If any aimcnly Kith. them,
elmpjy for the reason that In the selection of
their agents they hare been careful to appoint
men of integrity who soon gained the un-.

can be said of the Canadian Government.. ~
A. NATIVE AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH,
. Is It not-worth the'attempt to make the
experiment of concentrating all the Indians In
the Southwest, give them a government, bnlld
np a native American (not <r Know Nothing”)
commonwealth, give the 500,000 TndUwa £
. voting representation in Congress, commence
with a Territorial form of government, and as
they advance in civilization encourage them
to organize-&State, and thereby ascertain of
wbat they arc capable as a people ?.
Moke it advantageous'lbr (the Indians on
the plains, and among the whites, to migrate
(as tnc Kansas Indians have already proposed
to do) into the Southwest territory and there
. unite with the 40,000 Cbcrokccs, Seminoles,

legislation and the control of the soil; pro

THE RED STONE MOUNTAIN". > -
- In 1858 our Government in a treaty nude
with the Tanktonssof the' Northwest, stipu
lated that a certain tract of land in Minnesota,'
.upon which a red stonewasfound; from Which
the Indiana made their smoking pipes, should
be reserved for theftee naeof all the tribes,
that U should be considered neutral ground,
and that all Indiana In gotag upon It should
while there bury the hsichet and be at peace
with each other, and no war should ever bo
madenpoait No matter how hostile the
tribes should be toward each other elsewhere,
there they should be fries da Strange as It
may appear, the records of the Interior De
partment show that the Indians 'have faith
fully carried out the provisions of that treaty.
What our Government haa Seen able to do In
a matter of red stone for pipes, can be done
in the more Important concerns of the Indi-
THE DECAT OV THE BACK.
If tho Indians continue to decrease in num
ber as they have since 1806, this Indian ques
tion, in a few years, will_ settle “itself in the
death of the last Indian on the American con
tinent. In 1856," It. was estimated that the
number-of Indians east-of the Mississippi
river was 9,000. They arc .now represented
by not over 9,500. The' Miamls, once a pow
erful tribe, numbered at that time 1,10); now
there ore but 500 of them left.'' The Winne
bagbs, 4,500; how, In round numbers, 2,0J0.
At that time the Sar and-Fnxes rcsldid in
what'is how lowa, west of the Mississippi
river, 6.000-to- IfiOOr strong.- Now they
arp in Kansas and hardly exceed 1,090 In
number. The Pottawatomlea,' 9,000, now ln :
K4n&aa,jmd number. 2,000, a loia of 7,0J0, in
a jingle tribe; in thirty years.- • The Shavnees
and Delawares In Kansas, now* number about
1,000 each, once very powerful tribes. In the
Southwest territory there are now 40,000.
Before the war they numbered nearly 00,000—
a loss 0f20,000 in less than Are years. These
Indians have adopted the manners and habits
ol'jlhe whites to a considerable extent, and
but lew of them lire In what Is known as the
"hunter state. .
In. 1850, at Fort Laramie, Nebraska Terri
tory, 20(000 “ Indians of the Plains,” Cbey
a«nes, Plains, Sioux, Arrapahoes, - Mamlans
and.Cinqbones, were represented. In conncll
folmake a treaty with the United Stales, In
•18p3, on the Upper Arkansas, on the plains, &
treaty was also made with the' Comaoches,
KSowas. and Apaches, .numbering 15,000. It
is bslimaied at the Interior Department that
for the last few years these Indians hare de
creased. temper cent. -The Ule Indians of the
IWcky. Mountains are'divided Into several
bands and it is estimated that a tew years a*o
they numbered 50,000. The Navajoea, now
on a reservation In Now. Mexico, 15,000. The
Blpck Feet, with whom, Gen. Stevens a few
years ago made a treaty, number 4,500.
The Pawnees, once one of the most warlike
-and power ml tribes, at war almost constantly
with all other Indianson the plains and In the
mountains, at lost became so much reduced
l in numbers as to be unable to-copovsuccess
f ully with their enemies. • They -came into
Nebraska, made a treaty with our Govern
ment, and settled upon a reservation near
Fort Kearney. In 1843 they numbered 7,000:
now they will not exceed 4,000. They are
not much given to agricultural pursuits, but
toy the last few years they have furnished sol
diers to assist us m fighting other Indians.
They have also furnished laborers on the rail
roads building In Kansas. - •
The Crows and Apaches of the mountains
are powerful,-warlike and troublesome.

the ambition of one man to ■ remain lo com

upon the lives and property of oar people,
which a little judgment could have prevented,
and the guilty parties severely punished!
Had it not been for'the massacre of Indian
prieoneis at Sand Creek—a massacre which
united all the Indians of the plains against
us; and which has already.invofved a loss on
our part of'soo of oof people—there might
have been saved a vast amount of valuable
property, and an expense to the country of

There was certainly a grave neglect some
where. The citizens of Chicago need only the
opportunity to manifest their profound inter

was devoted to .the claims of the freodmen.

to the warmest terms, and will recommend to
Congress, in a supplementary report, not
only the continuance of the Bureau, but a
liberal appropriation in its behalf; probably
twelve to fifteen millions of dollars.-If Con

(every dollar of the principal might be
returned) more valuable to the next genera

right appropriation of a hundred millions for
ordinary Internal Improvements. Thu great
question with theFrecdmen's Commission Is,
how to provide the necessary real estate ‘for
schools and asylums: the Incomes of both be

of these points Ve most go' a Utile into per*
sohal detail. ' ■
Having occasion to hny.a new., cooking
strive, lor tho reason.that the one In use re*
qulrcd a new grate, that could notbo had,
for the simple fact that, “wo no - longer cast
any parts of that pattern,’* the order was
sent to the city for the best nine-inch hole
cooking stove for the use of soil coal. This
stove came, with a letter "from the dealer,
• saving that it was the “latest pattern in mar
ket, and particularly well* adapted to soft
coal, with an extra grate for wood.- The
price, ISO. la rather high, but Is-the lowest
pricej.for which any oi the new.stoves, are
sold. As yon ordered the best, we send you
I this in preference to any of the old patterns.
The old patterns are going out of date, and
ore sold very low. Wo have'no donbtyou
will bo pleased with this stove.. We also send
■ a pamphlet with Instructions for Its use.” -
Weil the new slave came and Has been In
use.
Thcold pattern at forly-jlve dollars was a
cheaper stove than this would be at twenty,
for that.was a.real coal burning: stove.'
Before it bad been In use two months-it cost-'
seven and n half dollars to repair the worn
out water tank, which had been made of the
thinnest of sheetcoppcr.. , .. T ,
So much Ibr the cost* of the now stove.
Instead of.havlng.large flues for the burning
oftofl coal, and s door for-the introduction
of the fuel. It Is only u'woodstove, with-the
addition ola coal gratetmd lire bricks which
so fill-up the fire box that It requires constant
'attention. As all the coal must go in at the
.top tho covers must be . removed each time,
thus filling the room with smoke. .■ *
Tho result Is that the old stovo has contin
ued in use for baking and washing, as It is in
, fact a coal stove, and. not fitted lor the use of
wood. It may be asked why the stove was
not sent back. ■ Tbe answer- is, that it is a
good wood stove, and is used as an assistant
i the kitchen..
. - The moral of this Is' that the farmer should
first decide what fuel he .uses; If wood, get
.one for wood only—ll coal, one for coal only.
But do not boy one o! those nondescript,
useless things designed for either wood or
coaL
In the next place, have a water-tank for hot.
water, for this ia a labor-saving utensil. The
water never comes to a boll, but Is Just what
is Wanting for dish-washing and cleaning - If
you would aid the kitchen help, do not omit
this.. Another-’kttachmcnt that Is useful ls
the tin dummy: attached - to tho rear of the
stove, to keep things warm—a nice place to
warm your plates oi a cold morning, and to
keep many things In just the right condition
for eating, besides, the broad-rising la fa lost
the right place when fa it. °
The dealers have their stores made for wood
orjcrial, so thakono pattern may suit all cus
tomers, and so long as the public patronizes
thpm la that way, lost so' long will they con
tinue the supply. Now, the difference between
a wood and coal stove is - a- radical -one. .via:
our softdlUnpls coal the volume,of smoke Is
large, and the flues most. he- correspondingly
large or thc'stove.wlllchokc up and ;1

DMlftht thing is a doer throiighwhlcß tofeed
the stove without taking off flie covers. You
caanui make use of-tho - door: at the
end, used for wood, for the reason that you
cannot reach the middle ol the fire box with
tho coal, and when washing,' it is not conven
ient to toko off the holler to replenish the Are.
The farmer will see that o good cook stove
is the most important Implement fa the
kitchen; it U therefore his duly to see that ho
not only has a good one, bnt that It is kept
fa good repair. - He should bear In mind that
a poor stove to the wife is like a poor plough
or poor cultivator tohUcrops; if hecaunot use
thalatlcrhe certainly cannot afford to have
hlsjwife to use tbe former.- He most not al-
tbe stove dealer to Impose upon him any
of the novelties at a higher nrice. Order last
what yon should- have, and* see for yourself
that It is right. .We have bccncnred of send

buy a car load at a time, and get* It direct
from the mine. Allow no coal' dealer -to
make twenty-five percent on yonr fuel. If
so dear the mines that you haul with teams

our farmerswho use coal at the rate of ten to
fiflocn tons a year, get their supply of the
village dealer, by the ton and half ton, mak
ing,' fa the extra costa and extra hauling an
advance ol not less than fifty per cent, or for
the (year a sum of from twenty-five to forty
dollars—an/amount well worth saving! and
onefthat would build a'good coal-house. If
wodd;is used, a wood-shed is indispensable to
comfort. Green br>et wood should never be
used fa a well regulated kitchen, and no
economical fanner will permit it.

AC the State Fair the patent churn men •
filled no small amount of space, presenting
about thirty different patterns of that useful
and Indispensable Implement. ‘ It- may not
please these mien' to tell them that for practi
cal luttcr-maktog not one of these churns
possesses any advantage over the old dash
chum, when used fa connection with a com
mon; thermometer.; In fact, tbe majority of
them are worse than useless, and will produce
less butter from a given amount of cream than
the did dash churn.
The science ot**churning consists In having
the cream at a given tempatnre, which is d£
tennlned by the thermometer. This Is at
about sixty degrees. If too cold, add warm
water to the cream until of tho right tempera- -
tore,: and if too warm* fa summer, odd cold
water from the wen or set the churn fa a tub
of cold well water. Well water is usually at
54® when drawn from the well and will soon
cool tbe cream. Batter will not come when
the cp:om Is below 65 ®; hat fa winter tbe
nearer to CO® the better. A thermometer Is
then a part of the kitchen Implements to be
connected with the chum. The so-called
thermometer - chum became very popular
fromllhls cause, bat the zinc was found to
have ia had eflect on the cream and to-day it
Is less popular wlth tbe dairymen. ;
• The wile who hashad so-mnch trouble with
tbe chum only needs a thermometer, and not
one of the new-fangled patent chorus; When
cream Is put fa one of-these rapid working
chums, the temperature ia raised rapidly by :
tbe motion, and a portion of - tho cream, is
converted Into bntter. and of coarse the -par
ties are pleased with the result. -
We have seen a churning to bo half a:dar
fa process of hotter making’until the patience
of the good woman was exhausted, when the
chum was wheeled behind the stove aadfaft
for the husband to finish fa tho evening, when
to thd astonishment of all, the butter cameln
five minutes. The reason of this, was
the cream had become warmed above 55 deg,.
the butter point, and of course ft came. ■ -
Had the wife. a thermometer, and/warmed
up thfe cream by the addition of warm water, -
she would have saved - nearly all of her half
dav's labor and vexation.
fod small dairies or when cows are kept
only for the family supply of batter, the old
dash chore Is tbeicst, the most easily cleaned
and convenient. Tor large dairies, horse or
dog pbwer Is called Into requisition. -
Butter can be worked in soft water' or that
nearly soft, but very hard water should not
be used for this, purpose. In feet a district of'
hard lime water is never a good dairy dis- r
trict.' . . J - •
Thus far in oar research in the kitchen, w&
have found more need of good management
than pf new implements, bnt the field is a
wide one. and may require more outlay as we

Committee conlerred with the trustee and attorney
of) said heirs - and agreed open a day. for. the
meeting of all persons concerned, to dia
cuss ■ the matter and to make or re
ceive a definite proposition for settlement.
The diy through yoor Committee declined to make
any proposition, bnt asked one from the opposite
party, i The trustee on behalf of the heirs and their
- attorney disclaimed any desire or intention of deal
ing hardlv or unfairly with the city In Its dilemma.
All he asked was justice to the children who owned
the property now in posseation of-the diy. He
(ihe trustee) would askthedty to make an offer
for the said properly, irtbeofierwaasncbaoncas
he could In justice to the heirs accept, he would
filidly accede toll; but If bo coold not accept said
oCcrv-then be rould propose to settlethe same by
arbitration In the usual way, pledging all parlies
represented by him to abide hr the decision
oti the arbitrators. It Is p roper to say
hero- • that there is one' minor heir,
and that great difficulty Is apprehended tn arrang
ing said minor's claim. Your committee, however,
accepted the offer ol arbitration, with the proviso
ibafthe a:y might accept the award of the arbitra
tors or vacate the grounds. This *wa? agreed to by
all parties and fo the matter stands at this time.
ity own opinion is that it all the lot owners who
can be reached, consent, the ground ahoold be va
cated. In order to ascertain if consent could be
obtained, I have called two meetings of said lot
owners In the County Conn room.m (hit city.- -To
allwho came, I mane a- statement of the whole

have readily avreed to the vacai lon upon fair terms.
As the city will propose none other iK«" fajr terms.
1 think there is no doubt that ihe. ground an be
.vacated. In a reasonable time.
Ihe terms proposed by me (depending of course
upon' the concurrence of the Common Conned)
wtaeu follows. town: That each and every lot

lor the tollowlng reasons, viz:
I committee have had a large and very
con vers at ion with all IherepresenS
Uvea of the several Horse Railroad Companies.
from which we have obtained the following items.
That said companies are running all the can they
have, or can get at present, upon all oftbalr several
llD “ of road. Farther, Urn they will give more
and better accommodations as soon as It u possible
fortbemtoget ears;-that they have a tall times

as possible, and will still continue to doso. That

better regulation of thetime-table tor the several

panic* for the present. .
• We therefbre request said railroad companies to
pntonmore cars as toon a* possible, so as to
shorten up the time, morning, noon and night, as
the great rush ot travel seem* to be at those times,
as no complaint la made at other times of the day.
Yonr committee recommend that said companies
nnt npon all their roads * 13 m. car, which ah»n
■lortvo «!«•» town at that time.
ice majority of your tomuiUtee also request that
.there should be alaoa car leave at halFpast twelve
and a car at one o’clock a. m. But the chairman of
Soar committee docs not believe that car* should
eobUged to run after 12a.m. This, however, Is
on tan honest dliTtmnce of opinion of the coiamlt-
We Ihrthia recommend that all employe* open
