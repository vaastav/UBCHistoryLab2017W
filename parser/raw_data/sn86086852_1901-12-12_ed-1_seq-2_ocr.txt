CONGRESSIONAL NEWS.
Washington, Dec. 2. —The 57th ses
sion of congress opened at noon with
a gallery overflowing and flowers so
plentiful as to perfume the second
chambers. Precisely at 12 o’clock
Senator Frye of Maine, president pro
tern, of the senate, rapped for order in
the upper house. The blind chaplain.
Rev. William Milburn, delivered the
innovation, the new senators were
sworn in and the usual resolutions for
a committee to wait upon the presi
dent, fixing a time of meeting, etc.,
adopted. Senator Gamble (S. D.)
formally announced the death of Sena
tor Kyle.
The machinery of the lower house
is cumbrous and set in motion by
laborious process, hut the spectators
evidently did not consider it tedious
as they clung to their places through
the entire proceeings, which lasted
four and one-half hours. The organ
ization was accomplished according to
time-honored precedents. Rev. Mr.
Couden gave the opening prayer. The
election of speaker resulted in the
choice of D. B. Henderson of lowa by
190 to 149 for Mr. Richardson (dem.)
of Tennessee. There were the caucus
choices. Speaker Henderson was
sworn in by Gen. Eingham, “father of
the house,” and after delivering a
graceful speech in recognition of
the honor bestowed upon him he in
turn administered the oath to the
members-elect. A committee of three,
consisting of Messrs. Payne, Bingham
and Richardson, was appointed to
join a similar committee of the senate
and wait upon the president and in
form him that congress was ready to
receive any communication he might
have to make. The rules of the last
house were adopted after a slight jar.
Mr. Richardson protesting, and then
the biennial seat drawing occurred.
Bills covering a thousand subjects
were introduced.
Washington, Dec. 3. —The senate
listened to the first message of Presi
dent Roosevelt and adopted a resolu
tion for the appointment of a com
mittee to cooperate with a like com
mittee from the house to consider by
what token of respect and affection
congress might express the sorrow of
tho nation upon the tragic death of
the late President McKinley. At the
conclusion of the reading of the mes
sage Senator Foraker presented the
McKinley resolution, and, as a further
mark of respect, the senate ad
journed.
Not in many years have the mem
bers of the house listened with such
rapt attention to the annual message
of the president of the United States
as they did to the reading of the first
message of Roosevelt. Several times
there was applause and at the con
elusion there was an enthusiastic
demonstration on the republican side.
On motion of Mr. Grosevnor of Ohio
that portion of the message relating
to the death of the late president was
referred to a committee to consist of
one member from each state to join
a similar committee of the senate to
consider and report by what token of
respect and affection it may he proper
for congress to express tho deep sen
sibility of the nation to the tragic
death of the late president. The
speaker appointed a committee hcad
by Mr. Grosvenor. A hill to punish
assassination or attempted assassina
tion of the president and other high
government officials was introduced.
A measure was also introduce and ex
tending the Chinese exclusion law
twenty years. A more stringent, im
migration law was also proposed
Speaker Henderson may not announce
the house committee assignments
until! after the holidays.
Washington, Dec. 4. —Practically the
entire time of the senate was devoted
to the introduction of bills and resolu
tions. Two of these measures, relat
ing to the suppression of anarchy and
dealing with anarchists, were allowed
to lie on the table so their authors,
Senators McCombs of Maryland and
Vest of Missouri, may bring them to
the early attention of the senate. The
isthmian canal report was transmit
ted to the senate by the president and
several bills providing for the con
struction of waterways, one by Sen
ator Morgan of Alabama, who has led
the movement for the canal in the
past, were presented. Senator Mc-
Comas’ resolution declares that con
gress has the power and should by
I law provide that persons * who wil
j fully kill or assault with intent to
i kill the president or vice president or
both or any officer upon whom the
powers and duties of the president
may devolve shall be punished with
death the federal courts to have juris
-1 diction over such offenses. Senator
i Hoar introduced a bill which provides
i that any person who shall wilfully kill
|or cause the death of a president of
I the United States or any officer thereof,
or who shall wilfully kill or cause the
death of a ruler or chief magistrate of
any foreign country shall be punished
with death; also that the attempt to
commit such murder shall be punished
with death. The president transmitted
the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty for the
isthmian canal. Senator Morgan’s
bill for the construction of the Nicara
guan canal appropriates a sum neces
sary to complete the project. Sena
tor Perkins’ bill on the same project
provides for the perpetual lease by
the United Stdt-s of the right of way
across Nicaragua and Costa Rica and
confers military, police and- anitary
control of the canal route by the
United States. It makes an appropria-;
tion of $120,000,000 of which $12,000,- j
000 is to be expended annually. Sena- J
tor Lodge introduced a bill provid- i
lug that the tariff passed by the
Philippine commission September 17,
1901, shall remain in full force and ef
fect. This covers goods going into
the islands. Senator Lodge also in
troduced a bill providing for the re
moval of the ton years limitation on
the Chinese exclusion act, thus leav
ing the provisions < i the Geary act in
force.
Washington, Dec. 5.- The text of
the new Hay Pauncefote treaty, pro
viding for construction of a canal
across the isthmus of Panama, sent
to the senate Wedn* sday. wan made
public. The canal Is to he free and
open to the vessels of commerce ami
war of ail nations observing the rules
! substantial as embodied in the eon
vention of Constantinople, sigm and!
October 28, 1888, for the free naviga- ;
lion of the Suez canal. The canal
shall never he blockaded, nor shall
any right of war be exercised nor any
act of hostility be committed within
it. The United States, however, shall
he at liberty to police, and protec
and build and manage it.
Senator McComas of Maryland
made an extended speech with
anarchy for his theme and was follow
ed by some brief remarks by Senator
Hoar of Massachusetts on tho dif
ficulties in the way of dealing with
anarchist assassins. Senator Me
Comas maintained that congress had
full power under the constitution to
enact a law punishing with death any
person killing the president or as
saulting the president with intent u
kill or aiding, inciting or procuring
such an act. He favored rigid pro
visions in the immigration laws for
tho deportation of alien anarchists.
Senator Hoar said the difficulty was
that assassins of the kings and rulers
always gloried in their crimes and
were in no wise deterred by the fear
of punishment. For this reason be
thought it w r as almost useless to
multiply punishments. The most |
effective remedy, he suggested, would |
he to have the civilized nations of tue j
world agree upon some desolate spot
on the earth’s surface, to which all
anarchists who upheld assassination
or the overthrow of government
should be transported. In such a
community the anarchists could carry
our their theories of living without
government and the world would he
rid of their presence. Senator Pen
rose introduced a bill for the regula
tion of immigration, prepared by him
self and the commissioner general of
immigration, which looks to a genera!j
revision of the law-s upon this ques
tion. It provides for a duty of $3 per
head on all persons coming Into the
United States from foreign countries,
except those who are citizens of this
country or of Canada or Mexico.
Washington, Dec. 6. —Representa-
tive Gardner of New Jersey intro
duced a joint resolution authorizing
the state department to purchase the
Danish West Indies and appropriating
not exceeding $4,000,000 for that pur
pose. Mr. Crumpacker (Ind.) intro
duced a hill for an amendment to tho
apportionment act so the membership
of the house will be 372, based on the
vote cast instead of on population. It
reduces the representation in the
southern states and makes an increase
in the northern states. Mr. Taylor
(Ohio) introduced a hill to pension
Mrs. McKinley at the rate of $5,000
a year, beginning Sept. 14, 1901, the
date of the death of the late presi
dent. A bill introduced by Mr. Brown
low (Tenn.) for the creation of a
park in the southern Appalachian
mountains, provides that the park
shall he called McKinley national
park and shall contain 4,000,000 acres.
Speaker Henderson announced the
appointment of the following com
mittees:

The Rest Cure Advised.
The busy woman, says Harper’s
Bazar, needs to conserve her nervous
force, and to increase it by every pos
sible means. If her health is excel
lent she will be greatly profited by
moderate exercise, but she will find it
greatly to her advantage to take this
at first in small and divided doses,
only increasing the amount after days
of moderation and rest. If, on the ton
j irary, her winter’s work leaves her
1 n:>t ill. but exhausted, “tired out,”
■ jomplete rest for one or two weeks,
j taken out of doors, is frequently the
j best prescription that can be given.
! The amount and duration of this rest
1 cannot be absolutely specified here,
as it must depend upon individual
c.eeds. In general, at least a week of
“.ying around” will be found very
profitable, in which short drives may
be taken, and a 10-minute easy walk
-n the cool of the day. Many will
improve best by adding a second week
-i out-doors rest to the first, and in
terspersing the hours in the hammock
with a short ride on a wheel, not ex
ceeding 20 minutes at first, or a couple
cf holes on the golf course, or some
equally temperate method of easy ex
ercise.

Washington, l>cc. 6.—The text of the
new Hay-Pauncefote treaty, providing
for construction of a canal across the
isthmus of Panama, sent to the sen
ate Wednesday, was made public yes

ject of the treaty and says:

NEGROES KILLED
IN SMASHUP
Malvern, Ark., Dec. 6.—Three per
sons were killed and thirty-eight in
jured in a head-end collision between
two passenger trains on the St. Louis,
Iron Mountain and Southern railroad
one and one-half miles south of here
last evening. The killed were all
colored.
Train No. 3 was to meet No. 4 at
; Malvern, but the latter was late and
I No. 3 moved ahead, expecting to meet
i the other at the next station. A mile
I and a half south of Malvern the trains
i met in a terrific collision. The en
| gineera jumped in time to save their
' lives. Both engines were wrecked
|and the colored coach on the south
j bound train was badly smashed. It
j was crowded with colored emigrants
' en route from north Carolina, Georgia
; and Alabama to Texas, and it was
among these that most of the casual
i ties occurred.
WRITTEN BY WASHINGTON.
Valuable Letter in Possession of a
Michigan Man.
Winona, Minn., Dec. 6. —Louis E.
Larcon of this city, who has been col
lecting autographs and curios for the
past twenty years and who now has
one of the finest collections in south
ern Minnesota, has just received some
valuable additions through a friend
in Michigan. The most important of
These is an autograph letter written
by George Washington on July 3,177 C
the day before the signing of the Dec
laration of Independence. The letter
is yellow and somewhat faded, but still 1
perfectly legible. It reads as fol- |
lows:
"‘July 3. I77t>. —Sir; We must secure
the sulphur by 7 tonight sur'o. Please
give bearer. Isaac Stone, twenty
pounds specie for same. By order
committee of safety. Thomas Redman,
sheriff. —G. Washington, General.”
On the opposite side is the address, I
"To Israel Pemberton. Merchant In
Philadelphia.” It is also indorsed,
“Paid twenty pounds. 12 carriage
paid.”
Mr. Larson has been investigating
and says that according to historical
accounts at least five of the signers
of the declaration served on “com
mittees of safety.”
Another document which Mr. Uarsoa
secured from Michigan is an autograph
letter of Abraham Lincoln, written at
Washington on April 28. -1864, to T. J.
Pickett of Rock Island, 111. The letter
is a brief one, and merely declares
the inability of the writer to visit
Mr. Pickett at an early date.
Still another autograph letter older
than either of these two, but not writ
ten by so prominent a person, is on#
of that came from the pen of Georg#
Stevenson in 1753. Mr. Stevenso#
being surveyor general of Pennsyl
vania from 1750 to 1768.
The last letter in this collectio*
bears the heading of King George’s
court of honor, and was written im
1814 by Captain Colin Brlckncr of th#
fifth infantry, being addressed to Hon
orable Edward H instead.
Mr. Larson prizes these epistles
very highly, considering the Washing
ton letter the most valuable document
in his large collection.
FIXED FOR THE WINTER
Tampering With the Arrangement**
for a Boy’s Comfort.
Here's a problem for Borough
perintendent of Education Job#
Walsh; “Must a public school boy
change his clothing frequently or does
it make no difference so far as his
right to receive the benefits of our fre*
schools arc concerned?” An earl;
consideration of this question will b
appreciated by a Twenty-fifth wwT
Italian mother and will relieve the
mind of the principal of one of Tweu
ty-fifth ward public schools. The prta
eipal in question has temporarily de
cided the matter in the affirmative for
sanitary reasons. It may not be oflß
cially brought to Superintendent
Walsh’s attention He is at liberty
therefore, to treat this publication of
the matter as he sees fit. For obvious
reasons, the number of the school in
withheld. The question arose in this
way:
Yesterday morning a character!*
tically garbed Italian woman piloted
her 17-year-old hopeful to the school
in question and asked to have him ad
mitted. His face and hands looked
as though they were complete strung
era to water, and instead of a coat tlu
upper part of the body was encased in.
a gunny sack, which had been snugly
fitted to his figure. His name, address
and other qualifications were formally
jotted down and he was about to be
sent to a class room when the observ
ant principal’s eye fell upon his im
provised coat. It looked as if it might
have been intended for an overcoat
The principal turned the hoy over to a
teacher to be shown to the wardrobe
The teacher sought to expedite mat
ters by helping the youth off with hie
coat and was attempting to unfasten
it, when his mother sprang forward
with the ejaculation:
“You hurta der boy. Leave der boy
alone. 1 sewa der boy up for der win
tor.”
“You’ve sewed the boy up for the
winter?” the principal gasped
“Doesn’t that thing come off?”
“Noa; keepa der boy warm all win
ter.”
“You mean that, that bag is put on
him to stay all winter?”
“Alla winter. That way he no catch
cold.”
“When does be wash himself?”
“When der spring comes.”
“Well, you lake him home at once,’
the indignant principal declared, “and
take that thing off him. Then give
him a bath. That is the only way yoo
can get, him in here.”
She took him away, vowing to see
her friend, (he alderman, and “have
ycr broke.”
MRS. HANNA’S OCTOROON.
The Senator’s Wife Has New Protege
Studying With Marches!.
United States Senator Hanna’s wife
lately visited Mme. Marches!, the
noted teacher of singing, in Paris, t
ascertain what progress is being mad*
by two of the latter’s pupils, Amerk
can girls, whom Mrs. Hanna has sup
ported here for tho last two years
while they have been studying musitt
Mrs. Hanna also presented another
prominent singer, a contralto fro*
Washington, the finest type of octo
roon, aged 20, named Lydia Leland
L/dia became engaged aboard ship on
the voyage from America to an Eng
lishman of prepossessing manners
but after investigation Mrs. Hann'J
convinced her beautiful protege that
the fellow was worthless. There wan
quite a tragedy, for Lydia’s impuk
sive leave died hard. But finally as to
Mrs. Hanna was on the point of sailing
back if Lydia remained obdurate, thfc
girl announced that the worst was
ove r and she would henceforth devot'
herself solely to art.
Mme. Marches! says the octoroon'?
voice is a ‘‘perfect wonder.” Mr?
Hanna is unostentatious about these
bnevolences and declines to talk
about them.
