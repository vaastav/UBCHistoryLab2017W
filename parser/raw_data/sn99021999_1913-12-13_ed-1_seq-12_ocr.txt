The tttt of Jury Service.
Spcnklng of Jury troubles and agi
tation for Jury roform, tho Saturday
Evening Post in its current Issua Hits
squarely on tho head a nail which
wo havo already hammered when It
refers t6 oufD&rbarous treatment o'f
Jurors. Tho Poet declares that "In
at least half tho Jurisdictions of this
country, to be summoned as a Juror
in a criminal enso is a calamity com
parable to a flro In the bouse or to
a dangerous Illness of a member ot
tho family," and makes the bold as
sertion thnf'for every hour a guilty
felon spends in mortifying confine
ment some innocent Juror spends at
least forty-flvo minutes in a more
irksomo confinement"
Most ot this abuse is attributed to
thb shocking inefficiency ot our
courts, rnn for tho convenience of
the Judges and the profit ot tho
lawyers, with llttlo caro for Justice
for tho litigant and In total disregard
of the suffdrlngs of Iho Juror. Wo
hero In Omaha, with our new and
modern court house, havo recently
done a great deal to ameliorate tho
condition of tho unfortunate person
caught on a Jtlry panel, but giving
him moro tolerablo physical sur
roundings docs not answer the wholo
purpose Men constantly try to es
cape Jury service oven mora tnan
they do to get away from the tax
collector or to avoid tho pest, which
Is certainly nn odious comparison,
all because the Juror Is ono Indis
pensable cog-in the machinery of our
courts with no ono to protect him
and no power to protect himself.

The Irony of fate sunk Its barbs to the
quick In Dr. Bun Tat Sen, the American
ised leader 'ot tile' shattered republican
forces of China. In a lettor to tho Kew
York Sun describing the collapse ot tha
South China rebellion last May nnd his
oscnpe In disguise to Japan, Dr. Sun
draws a melancholy picture of disap
pointed hope and' ambitions sidetracked
for the present. The exiled first provis
ional president of the republic mentions
his mistaken zeal In relinquishing the
presidency In favor of Yuan Shlh Kal
and his confidence In the tatter's profes
sions Of devotion to tho new China. Ob
servers ot events at th time, knowing
Tuan's unwavering devotion to Xo. 1,
challenged Dr, Bun'n .foresight and his
Judgment of men. The doctor candidly
admits tho Irreparable blunder, and
pleads In extenuation his desire to pre
sent further ravages of Civil war. Pres
ident Yuan repaid tho confidence rev
posed la .him after .tho fashion of his
slaughter of th boxers. Dr. Sun. and
his associates In tbe south were set upon
by spies and hired cutthroats, some were
caught and taken to Peking or "accident
ally" killed on the way, and. those who
evaded the police and army dragnets
were obliged to flee the country for their
lives. Dr. Sun and General Huang Il'atng,
commander ot tho rebels, seeing the
cause hopeless through lack ot means,
dissolved the forlorn army, and suc
ceeded in escaping Yuan's axe by leaving
tho country disguised aa coolies. Since
August last both have been exiles In
Japan. Tho narrative ot Dr. Sun con
firms in detail tho exulting proclamation
issued by tho victorious Yuan threo
months ago: "The rebellion is crushed
and tho leaders executed or cxIIodHn

Cnpe-to-Calro Knllrunil.
Tho dream ot tho famous "empire
builder" of South Africa, Cecil Ilhodes,
Is progressing steadily to realization. A
quarter of a century ago tho Ilarrlman
ot tho tD&rk Continent projocted the
Capo-to-Calro railroad to connect tho two
great spheres-of British power In Africa
and develop the vast area of Umpst un
known territory between Egypt and tho
Cape. Tho project remained a dream for
years. Very little of the lino was con
structed during the lifetime of Rhodes,
because various obstacles had to bo re
moved before the project reached the
practical stage. Wars of conquest In tho
Sudan and in the Transvaal removed the
two main obstacles and tho last ono dlsr
appears with a land concession from the
Belgian government which Insures a
through line from south to north through
British territory. Tho southern exten
sion has now reached a ptaco called
EUsabethvlllo. 2. 0 miles north of Capo
town, to which point trains are running
regularly, From Cairo tho rails have
been pushed southward for a distance of
1.400 miles below itartum, right Into tho
heart of Sudan. If advantage Is taken
ot the navigable waters Ot tho Nile and
Intervening lakes, Jess than. 809 miles of
rails will need to be laid to complete a
through -communication. The most seri
ous obstacle encountered by tho construc
tion ,foroe were' lions, elephants and
.whits ants, tho latter 'morer omnivorous
than wild animals, so riiUch'so that ties

Uermanjrs system Of renresnnl

by the premier, are as follows:
1, The settlement mUst not be humil

X. Ulster's treatment must not be dif

X. Ulster must . retain full protection

Champions Carter Lake Park.
OMAIIA, Dec. IJWTo tho J3dltor ot The
Bee: I read where Mr. Clossom Is
quoted. ' assailing Commissioner Joseph
Hummel at the meeting of the Southwest
Improvement club ior spending an excess
of money on the Carter Lake park.
This Is so manifestly unjust that I Can
not rcfrala from replying. Having .been
Intimately associated with the Improve
ment o( the parks and -boulevard system
of Omaha' for a number 'of years, 'and
especially Carter lake, I would like to
enlighten the centleman and the South
east Improvement club by sajfing first.
that Carter lake "Was donated by Mrs. E.
J. Cornish, she having paid 150,000 for
same, and since the donation she, has
given to tho city outright for the Improve
ment ot this park $30,000., and at the
present time Is contemplating some
$10,000 moro for further .Improvements.
The amount of money expended by thp
park board and' the present pommts
mlfsioners has been less than halt of the
total amount given by Mro. Cornish arid,
expended on 'what Is destined .to be orin
of tho greatest porks, rioC only In Omane,
but In the entire United Statts;
This expenditure should 'not brf lookfd
upon as local; but for the benefit ot every
citizen of Omaha. It Is a park and
waterway that will not be possessed by
any other city -In the United Btates 'so
close in and" Tvlthout doubt will be tho
park ot all parks for the masses.
If the present park commissioner Is to
bo assailed it should be on some other
expenditure than Carter lake Improve
ment To assail him on this betrays a
laoK or knowledge and appreciation of
tho Value ot this park and Its future use
fulness and great value.

Wkr Ho Denounces the Caucus.
AUBURN, Neb., Dec 11. To the Edi
tor ot Th Bee; While our good and
great senator Is getting so much fine,
free advertising through his back-fire on
tho administration and Its currency bill,
tho question occurred to mo as worth
asking, Does anyone with a kernel of
common sense suppose for on Instant
that tho good and great senator would bo
making -all this hurrah but for the fact
that the committee refused to adopt
his trust-busting amendment to tho tar
iff blllT He protends to base his wholo
opposition to the currency bill on te
ground of caucus rule, when everybody
who knows him Is aware that he nover
dreamed of denouncing the caucus any
caucus until ono refused to do what ho
wanted It to. That, and only that, ac
counts for all his sham battle with tho
president, who, however, he doubtless Is
happy of an excuse to fight. But to
morrowand I make this statement ad
visedly f the administration currenoy
forces were to "lay down" and deter
mine on six weeks more of caucusing,
not agsJnst, but with him apd for his
plan,, ho would shut up on his anti
caucus talk so suddenly as to make us
almost forget that he had ever knocked It.

Hon. Woodrow Wilson for this glorious
achievement ot courage ana common
seme!
Chicago Inter Oceans Its brevity a re
freshing departure from tradition. It
will probably be read In full by moro
people, than has any such document
within living memory.
Washington Star: The best feature of
what may be called the Wilson order of
things Is presented today. We have an
annual message to congress which does
not stretch out to the crack of doom.
Chicago Record-Herald: The editor who
has waded through twenty or thirty i
thousand words' of a compilation called
the president's message, who has suf
fered this undeserved punishment year ,
after year, will call down blessings on
the head of Woodrow Wilson.
Kansas city Times: In forcefulness of
speech, la lucidity. In elevation ot mat
ter and manner, In charm ot diction, In
absorbing Interest, this generation knows
few state papers that aro In a class with
President Wilson's address to tho con-'
gress or uic unuea male.
New York Tribunes Now thst President
Wilson has shown hon, everybody will
wonder that It never before occurred to 1
his predecessors to make an annual ran-'
sage short enough to read. And the mes
sage can be read. There Is no "to be i
continued In our next" at the end to de
ter tho public for a presidential snsssoge
is one of - the least thrilling serials that
Is ever encountered.
