or support of any kind.'*
Mr G. A. Proehl, New Portage, Sum
mit County, Ohio, writes: ' My wife
has been sick for about five years. In tire
fir at piace the doctor called it leucorrhcea,
and treated it about one year, and she
grew worse, and turned to ulceration of
the womb, and was treated for that two
years, but she grew worse and the doctor
gave her up. Then I employed Dr. Un
derwood, one of the best do*, tors of Akron,
but under his treatment she grew worse.
She \va ; paralyzed; she had lost ail of the
sen-e of feeling and her eyesight. She
could not walk for nearly two years.
About sis months ago Underwood gave
her up. She tried your Per in a. She
lias taken three bottles, and it did more
good than any other medicine. The pa
ralysis has about left Her. her eyesight is
getting better. We will continue the use
of Prruna until she is well "
Mr.Isaac Nicodemus, Schellsburg, Bed
ford County. Pa ,writes; '1 am induced,
by a sense of duty to the suffering. to make
a brief statement of your remarkable help.
a> a sufferer of catarrh in my head and
throat. I doctored with one of the best
physicians in our place for tiiat dreaded
disease, catarrh, and found no relief. But
in 1 S 33 I lost my speech, and was not able
to do any kind of work lor near three
months. I could neither eat nor sleep.
PurunA and Manai.in did wonders for
me. I used three bottles of Pick l x a and
one of Ma.valjv, and now I am in bei
