CONFERENCE THIS MORNING. j
.-; -
Police Think They Have Over- ]
hauled a Gang Implicated In "~-<
Many Burglaries.
An important conference will be
held at 10 o'clock this morning in the
rooms of the Commercial club for the
purpose of finally determining wheth
er or not "Minneapolis is to be given
the same rate, one cent per mile, for
; the Knights of Pythias convention
! that has been gien to St. Paul for the
\ G. A. R. encampment next year.
j The meeting has been called by
Hon. W. D. Washburn, chairmen of !
1 the railroad- committee for the |
. Knights of Pythias convention, who
! has invited all the general passen-
g er agents Of roads running here to |
I meet the committee and discuss the
rate question.
j Chairman Caldwell, of the Gen-
I eral Passenger Agents' association,
has notified Mr. Washburn of his in
tention to be present, and it is urgent
ly requested that there be a full turn-
I out of merchants and shippers gener
\ ally to meet these general agents and
bring every possible influence to bear
I upon them to grant the one-cent
1 rate, without which the convention
cannot come to this city.
, The members of the railroad sub
-1 committee have labored indefatiga
; bly to obtain the necessary one-cent
rate, and they now ask the mer
' chant, wholesale and retail, and ev
ery jobber and shipper, to attend to
; day's meeting and second the efforts
| already put forth to obtain from the
j railroads the concession so essen
! tial to the securing of the conven
tion.
i If the shippers will only awaken
' to the importance of being present
to bring their persuasive powers to
I bear upon the agents, the commit-
I tee thinks the object sought may be
i secured, but if the business men con
i tinue to manifest so much apathy the
j convention may be lost through in
ability to bring the railroads to
terms. .. "* - ,-. .-.
I Gen. Carnahan, commander of the
! Uniform Rank, in a letter to Mr.
Wheaton, says: "It will not do for us
to dally along with the railroads. It ;
| will be impossible to get our peo
. pie to the encampment unless we can
i secure reasonable rates. i Our men
I will not be very ready to go if the
• railroads are to discriminate in fa
j vor of the G. A. R. encampment
held at practically the same time and
place. I shall be grievously disap
: pointed if we are prevented from
' making a grand success of the stub
: bornness and pig-headedness of the
railroads." :
1 The local knights are exasperated
i over a recent letter of one of the gen
! eral passenger agents concerning the
I question of Pythian rates, in -which :
he employed the following language:
"Your Knights of Pythias will either;
! pay one full fare for the round trip
jto Minneapolis or walk." -*'-. Z
l Pythian organs all over the country .
are aroused, and a bitter fight is al
most sure to follow a refusal of the
railroads to make concessions.
j MAY BE A GOOD LEAD. &,
Police Think They Have. Over

Jim King and Dan Ryan were arrest-"
I ed yesterday by Inspectors Howard and
i Doyle on suspicion of being the parties'
i implicated in the Orth burglary on
' Thanksgiving day. ■"_*. ■'. .:■__;■ -
It is thought in police circles that the
! arrest of these two men will clear lip a
number of mysterious burglaries that
have been committed in this city and
St. Paul In the past two or three
months. :.':...
I A visit to the house occupied by these
two men, on Second street, between
i Eleventh and Twelfth avenue south,
! revealed a large quantity of silverware,
: clothing, jewelry, table linen and vari
ous articles of domestic utility, which
were removed to police headquarters
j and identified late yesterday afternoon
' as having been stolen from the resi
| dence of John Orth and Mr. Clough,
. which were burglarized recently, and
1 also from the home of Capt. Bresette,
j in St. Paul, where the burglars made
| quite a haul. After arresting the two
I men the inspectors brought to
! headquarters a woman who gave
1 the name of Nellie Boyd, and who
was found at the house upon the in
spectors' visit. She is well known to
. the police, and was placed in charge of
, Matron Paine.
i The men offered no resistance what
l ever to arrest, and both they and the
1 woman are disposed to take matters
I very coolly.
•j About one-half the goods taken from
' the residences named have been recov-
I ered, and there is a quantity of silver
i ware yet unidentified, which leads the
I police to think that an important cap
i ture has been made. It is believed that
; these men have been working the Twin
; Cities for some time, and that the rest
I of the stolen property will be recovered.

BRESLAU, Dec. 3.— the dinner
| given yesterday by the Cuirassiers of
' the Guard, in celebration of the anni

i Emperor William said that the hours
! he passed in the society of his com

some and laborious life which he led.
The day, he continued, could not be
better celebrated than by vowing once
more to preserve and defend what the
great emperor and his generals crea
ted at that time. Hie majesty con
cluded:
"The more I go beneath party watch
words and party interests, the more I
count upon the army and the more I
hope the army abroad or at home
will be ready to yield faithful obedi
ence to my desires and guiding will.
I trust for this to the spirit which pre
vails in this regiment and I recall the
words which my grandfather addressed
to the officers at Coblentz, after the
hard times of 1848, when he said:
" 'There are the gentlemen on whom
I rely.'
"Inspired by this sentiment, I drink
to the prosperity of the Cuirassier

honor to the name of the great elec

A Hint of Lavender.
Harper's Bazar.
The extent to which perfumes were
used in old times, indeed in times not
so old at all, would be something re
markable If It were not remembered
that they often took the place of the
absent bath. In the mediaeval days
this was an obvious fact; but In the
days of the Greek and Roman the bath
was so universal a luxury that they
only- supplemented it in the shape of
richly scented unguents. These are as
important a part of the toilet of the
Oriental women today as they were of
the elegant Italians 400 years ago. But
as it came to be recognized that much
of this perfume was used as a dis
guise for uncleanliness, its use about
the person in any strong way was re
garded as a vulgarity, and it was only
thought fine to be odorless.
When this principle had been thor
oughly established, and with it the
habit of tne frequent bath also, the
luxury of life reasserted itself, and
perfumes were again In request, but
in moderate and very dainty and deli
cate form. There are perfumed waters
now in use in the crimping of the
hair, and there are, little sachets to be
worn in the corset, and French dress
makers often shake very fine powders
between the linings, in the bodice of the
gowns they make, so that they shall
give out a mere hint and suspicion as
the wearer passes, as lr sne came from
some land of flowers and brought a
mere dream of remembrance of their
fragrance with her. Anything more
than this hint would be barbarous,
and ■ a return to the crude old habit
when every one who could must have
gone about "dripping with Sabaean
spice." •;-■-. ---: : i ; --v

WASHINGTON, Dec. The first
movement in congress upon the Ven
ezuelan boundary dispute came to
day in the form of resolutions intro
duced in the house and senate, one
by Representative Livingston, of
Georgia, whose name has been some
what identified with the question by
reason of his resolution recommend-
ing arbitration, "which was adopted
by the last congress, and his recent
visit to Venezuela; another by Sen
ator Lodge, and a third by Senator
Cullom. Mr. Livingston's resolu
tion recites that last congress rec
ommended that the boundary dis
pute be submitted to arbitration;
that the action was brought to the
attention of her Britannic majesty's
government by the president, court
eously and with kindly intent, and
declares that her majesty's govern
ment "has failed to give the prompt
consideration to the important re
quest contained in that joint resolu
tion, or to answer the same in any
manner, such as was due and be
coming to the dignity of the United
States as a great nation, and to the
friendly relations existing between
the two governments." . The resolu
tion also recites that after this com
munication the colonial secretary
instructed the government of Brit
ish Guiana to take forcible posses
sion of certain territory of Vene- .!
zuela involved in the dispute, "an
act which has been officially declared
to be the manifestation of an un
friendly disposition toward the Unit
ed States." '.'...
In conclusion, it provides for a
joint committee of two senators and
three members, to investigate and
recommend the proper action to con
gress to vindicate and preserve the
dignities and the rights of the United
States in the premises.
LODGE'S RESOLUTION.
Senator Lodge, of M*?f3sachusetts, to
day introduced the following resolution
relative to the Monroe doctrine in the
senate:
"That the congress of the United
States deem it proper to assert, as a
principle in which the rights and in
terests of the United States are in
volved, that the American continents,
by the free and independent condition
which they have assumed and main
tained, are henceforth not to be con
sidered as subjects for future coloniza
tion by any European powers.
"Resolved, That we should consider
any attempt on their part to extend
their system to any portion of this
hemisphere as dangerous to our peace
and safety. With the existing colonies
or dependencies of any European
power we have not interfered and shall
not interfere, but . with the govern
mentrs who have declared their inde
pendence and maintained it, and whose
independence we have, on great consid
eration and on just principles, ac
knowledged, we could not view; any in
terposition for the purpose of oppress
ing them, or controlling in any other,
manner their destiny, by any European
power, in any other light than as the
manifestation of an unfriendly dispo
sition towards the United States.
"Repolved, That in accordance with
the doctrines laid down as President
Monroe has stated, in the -preceding'
resolutions, the United States declares
that it proposes to maintain the princi
ples embodied in that doctrine, and
will regard any infringement of it or
any attempt on the part of any Euro
pean power to take or acquire new
territory on the American continent,
whether under the pretense of bound
ary disputes or otherwise, as an. act of
hostility to the United States.
"Resolved, That the president be re
quested to communicate these resolu
tions to the governments of all nations
with whom we have relations of amity
and commerce."
Senator Cullom (Rep., 111.) also in
troduced, a resolution enunciating the
Monroe doctrine,
;-. CUBAN RECOGNITION.
Senator Call today introduced the fol
lowing joint resolution: -
"Resolved, That the government of
the United States recognizes a con
dition of public war between the gov
ernment of Spain and the government
proclaimed, and for some time main
tained by force or arms by the people
of Cuba, and the United States of
America hereby declares that it will
maintain a condition of strict neutral
ity between the contending powers, and
accord to each all the rights of bellig
erents in the ports and territory of the
United States.
"The congress of the United States
protest and remonstrate against the
barbarous manner in which the war in
Cuba has been conducted, and the
president is hereby authorized to take
such steps as may be expedient in his
judgment to secure an observance of
the laws of war, as recognized by
civilized nations." 7
Following is the full text of Senator
Allen's resolution on the recognition of
Cuba and the maintenance of the Mon
roe doctrine: '-:ZZ.
"Resolved, That it Is the sense of the
senate, (1), that the government of the
United States of America should
promptly recognize the revolutionists
of Cuba, who are now honestly strug
gling to secure their independence of
the Spanish government as composing
an Independent nation possesing all the
rights thereof according to the laws
of nations; (2), that all islands in close
proximity to the coasts of the United
States of America should as speedily
as possible, by treaties or purchase, be
annexed to this government, as es
sential to our safety in times of war
and the convenience and necessity of
our commerce in times of peace; (3),
that the wise declaration of President
Monroe, known as the Monroe doc
trine, is a well established policy of
the government of the United States
and should be promptly and effectually
maintained by the government; (4),
that while the government of the Uni
ted States should not needlessly or
hastily embroil Itself with any for
eign power, and should only resort to
extreme measures in cases of absolute
necessity, a firmer and more prompt
policy on the part of this government
in maintaining the rights of American
citizens abroad should be introduced
and pursued." • • , '.'.'v.

ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 3.— Cold as
was the weather tonight, the wel
come extended to Secretary of the
Interior Smith, on his appearance
before the general assembly to dis
cuss the financial question, was of
the warmest. Standing room only
was available in the house of repre
sentatives, where both branches of
the legislature, distinguished men
from various parts of the state and
several hundred citizens, including a
number of ladies, were gathered.
Loud and lengthy applause frequent
ly interrupted his remarks. The
secretary confined himself to the
money question, taking strong
ground against the free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and defending
the course of the administration in
financial matters.
Mr. Smith rehearsed the uses and
functions of money and gave a run
ning review of the history of cur
rency in this country. The advo
cates of free coinage, he said, pro
fessed to want.gold and silver treat
ed with equality, and yet the policy
they proposed . would put 100 cents'
worth of one in a dollar, and only 50
cents' worth in the other. He was
not against silver. He wanted just
as many gold and silver or paper dol
lars circulated in this country as
could be kept as good as every oth
er dollar. He indorsed the bimetallic
policy of Thomas Jefferson, he said,
but he did not agree with the bi
metallic fallacy of "Coin" Harvey.
He argued elaborately to show that
the free and unlimited coinge of both
gold and silver at the present ratio
would result in the establishment of
the silver standard and the disap
pearance of all our gold.

Free coinage would benefit no one
and give hardships to all, especially
to the cotton planters of the South,
j who would have to sell their prod
ucts at a gold standard price and
buy their goods at an inflated silver
standard valuation. .
The most significant part of Sec
retary Smith's address was the ref
erence to state banks. The repeal
' of the 10 per cent tax on their circu
lation would, he believed, be one
remedy for our "financial ills. He
: took pleasure in telling his auditors
that, of a great number of great
lawyers in the national capital with
whom he was associated, all were
agreed that the prohibitory tax was
! unconstitutional. President Cleve
land and Secretary Carlisle had both
recommended its repeal to the last
congress, and .. their recommenda
tions would have been renewed, but
it would have been useless to appeal
to the present congress for such ac
tion. He spoke of the provision of
the enabling act passed by the
Georgia legislature, providing for the
establishment of banks of issue
whenever congress should repeal the
tax thereon, and declared that if he
were a member of the general as-
I sembly he would work to repeal that
clause, and if the clause were re
pealed he would be one of a number
to organize a bank and issue notes
and test the constitutionality before
the supreme court.
The applause that greeted this
declaration was long and loud. The
secretary closed by announcing his
assurance that the next national
convention would take advanced
ground against free coinage, and
counselling calmness of discussion
and harmony within party lines, so
that after the battle was over there
might not be so many scars.
