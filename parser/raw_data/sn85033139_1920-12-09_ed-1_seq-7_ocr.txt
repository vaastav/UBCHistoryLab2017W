TEARS SPRING TO HIS EYES
Ohioan’s Presence in the Body Marks
the First Time in History That
Executive-Elect Has Attended
Its Sessions.
Washington, Dec. 7. —Standing at
iii.s desk where he served for six years,
President-elect Warren G. Harding
hade farewell to Hie United States
senate and In a brief speech, choked
with emotion, expressed the hope that
he might have the co-operation of ids
■colleagues In the four yars beginning
March 4’next.
Senator Harding’s presence in Hie
senate marks Hie first time in his
tory that a President-elect lias at
tended sessions of that body us a
member.
Harding Bids Colleagues Farewell.
The galleries were choked with peo
ple and hundreds stood outside un
able to gain admittance. Senator
Harding’s voice was low and husky
as lie began his farewell. His eyes
were dim with tears.
“I am pleased at tills greeting, my
fellow members of Hie senate,” he
rald. "There is still greater satis
faction in having this opportunity to
say to you informally some of the
things in my heart which I could ut
ter In no other way. 1 recognize that
1 am here today under somewhat un
usual circumstances, and there is a
delicacy about it that one in ray po
sition cannot escai>e through some
form of self-effacement which does not
seem quite possible.
“No member of fids body could be
more reluctant to leave it.
"I say to Hie senate that 1 came
here with a very high respect for this
body, and I am leaving it with greater
respect than that which I came. If
one could always direct his own polit
ical fortunes to his liking 1 should
have preferred my membership here
to any office a citizen may hold in
this republic or elsewhere in the
world.
"I like the freedom, the associates,
the patriotic sense of responsibility
which abides here. ! am conscious of
the great place which congress holds
under our Constitution, and particular
ly sensible to Hie obligations of the
senate.
“When my responsibilities begin in
the executive capacity I shall be ns
mindful of the senate’s responsibilities
as 1 have been zealous of them ns a
member, hut I mean, at the same time,
to lie just as insistent about the re
sponsibilities of the executive.
“Our governmental good fortune
does not lie in any surrender at either
end of Hie avenue, but in the co-ordi
nation and co-operation which becomes
the two In a great and truly repre
sentative popular government.
“Senate Oligarchy” Ruction.
“This brings me to the thought par
ticularly in mind. Something lias been
said about the ‘senatorial oligarchy.’
Of course everyone here knows that
to be a bit of highly imaginative and
harmless fiction. But I do recognize
how essential is Hie helpfulness of the
senate in the making of a successful
administration.
"I want to express today the wish of
a colleague for the confidence and Hie
co-operation of the members of this
body In (lie four years which begin
next March 4. Ido not limit this sin
cere request to tills side of the aisle.
One cannot promise agreement in all
things with an opposite party which
is sometimes Insistently wrong, but we
may find common ground In Hie spirit
of service, and hope for that agreeable
and courteous and oft times helpful
relationship with the opposite which
has added to Hie delights of fellow
service during Hie last six years.
"We are facing no easy task. We
have our full part in Hie readjustment
of human affairs, after the world tu
mult. We have our tasks at home,
we have our part in the inevitable
work of the civilized world.
"I am sure that the necessity of wise
solution will Inspire us to work to
gether; to take common counsel, to
be tolerant of one another and give
Hie best which is In nil of us to attain
the ends which become our republic at
borne and will maintain its high place
among tho nations of Hie earth.
"With propriety I can not venture
upon any suggestions now, even
though I am speaking as a member of
this lind,v. Three months of the pres
ent administration remain, and I would
have house ami senate join cordially
In making them fruitful rather than
wasted months."

Urs. Pollywog wilt lie over tomorrow
0 borrow your fountain pen or your
ortolseshell comb, or perhaps she will
•omc visiting for a few days, and the
•ost of entertaining her would buy sev
eral barrels of chicken broth.
“I hate to have anybody do me a
kindness, knowing I’ll tie expected to
return the favor with Interest in one
way or another. When I was a mere
boy my eyes were opened to the fact
that kind actions are a delusion and a
snare. Next door to us there lived an
dd dame named Mrs. Crimp. One day
she came over to our house with a
pair of woolen socks she had knitted
for me. 1 suppose an equally good
pair could have been bought at the
trade palace for fifteen cents, and I
wasn’t overwhelmed with joy. My
mother, who, with all her splendid
qualities, was an easy murk, and in*
dined to find good in everything and
everybody, was enthusiastic over Mrs.
Crimp’s generosity.
“Hut even in my infant years I was
gifted with tlie wisdom of the serpent.
and I felt from the first that there was
some malevolent scheme in the back
ground.
“The scheme was soon developed.
Mrs. Crimp hud many chores to do,
and she hated to do (hem herself.
There was wood to he carried Into the
house, and the cow to be taken care
of, and a hundred other unprofitable
tasks. Every time I’d meet her she’d
say, “Well, my sweet little hoy, with
your golden ringlets and sunny smile,
how do you like the socks I made you?
If you only knew how I worked, so you
would have the best socks in town!
And Hint reminds me of a little errand
1 wish you would do for me. Go to
Mr. Jinks, who lives seven miles north,
and ask him to let you have his saw,
so you can cut some kindling for me
tomorrow."
“First and last, Mrs. Jiggers, 1 put in
.$l,OOO worth of manual labor for that
woman and my y*u(h was poisoned,
and my manhood embittered by It. I
might have forgiven everything had
tin* socks been good ones, but they
were atrocious. The heels always
worked around to my Insteps and the
tojis worked down over my shoes.
“It has been that way all my life.
When a man Insists upon doing me a
kindness I look upon him with sus
picion. When I was laid up In my
room with a broken leg two or three
years ago, I had an excellent time.
The leg hurt only at Intervals, and I
had plenty of novels to read, and
nothing to worry over, atid 1 would
have enjoyed myself splendidly but
for tiresome philanthropists who were
determined to sit by my bedside and
cheer me up. I didn’t need any cheer
ing up, and I tried to convince them
tiiat their visits had the opposite ef
fect, but they wouldn’t take a hint.
They sat by my couch of suffering and
told Idiotic stories, and bored me al
most to death.
"Jim Hlgginbottom was an especial
nuisance. That man simply wouldn’t
go away as long as there was an ex
cuse for staying. lie said his con
science wouldn't allow him to forsake
the bedside of a suffering friend. At
that time 1 carried some accident In
surance. and when my check came Jim
borrowed half of It, and after he got
the money he never worried over my
leg any more. And he never returned
any of the money. I don’t blame him
for that, for I make it a rule never to
return borrowed money, but 1 can’t
easily forgive him for boring me so
many hours, when I wanted to bo
reading.’’
Obeyed Orders.
“Mow Is It 1 have such big telegraph
bills?”
“You told me, sir, to use dispatch In
that correspondence, so 1 wired all the
letters.”
All Have Obligations.
Kvcry citizen has obligations In the
•omniunlty In which he lives. Wheth

tountry.
A Pretty Good Method.
“Why do you encourage your boy to
lend his verses to the magazines? Do
run want him to be a poet?” “No,
nerely want him to get the conceit
narked out of him, that’s all.”
