WEEKLY POST.
HENRY N. BLAKE, - - - Editor.
Saturday, - - - December 8, 1866.
f Our Agents in the di;fi rent towns
and mining camps of the Territory and
elacwhere, ci'il please take notice that the
termn of subscription for the POST bacre
been increased to $3.50 per quarter, $5.00
for six months, and $8.00 fir one year.
TnhE President's message will be found
in the telegraphic news. Read and pon
der, and commend the enterprise of the
POST.
The President's Message and P.licy.
A perusal of the views of the Execu
tive on the subject of reconstruction,
which were printed in the TRI-WEEILY
PoST of the 4th inst., will convince every
reader that the lessons of the elections
have been entirely disregarded. What
is generally known as the policy of Presi
dent Johnson, is still recommended for
adoption, althongh it has been repudi
ated by gigantic majorities at the polls.
The " behests of the people," regarding
which so much bombast has been ex
pended by the Chief Magistrate of the
nation, have been met by insolent defi
ance instead of patriotic acquiescence.
The omissions of the message cannot
fail to excite unfavorable comments.
Although much is said concerning the
admission of "loyal " representatives to
their seats in Congress, there is no con
flict of ideas upon the President's propo
sition, when it is considered abstractly.
But the definition of the term "loyal"
is the foundation of the differences that
exist in political circles. In the public
speeches that were delivered by the Ex
ecutive when he made his inglorious
march from Washington to Chicago, the
voters that upheld the Government in
its struggle with traitors were de
nounced, while rebel generals and poli
ticians and their sympathizers in the
North were distinctly classed as "loyal "
citizens. After evading the real ques
tion that has been pointed out by us, we
need not be surprised to find that no al
lusion is made to the great and import
ant topics of the Constitutional Amend
ment, negro or universal suffrage, and a
proclamation of amnesty. The space
that is devoted to the discussion of the
Mexican empire and the withdrawal of
the French troops, would have been put
to a better use if the subjects which ex
cite the minds of everybody had been
debated. We do not perceive any of the
despicable insinuations against the val
idity of the present Congress which were
uttered within a few months by the au
thor of the message. The expressions
" a body assuming to be a Congress," "a
pack of traitors," " an unconstitutional
assembly of radicals," and similar phra
ses, do not greet our eyes. We infer
that these remarks are inconsistent with
the present position of the occupant of
the white house. He is estopped from
protesting against the legality of a body
which he recognizes by transmitting to
it his official recommendations without
making any objection. The last sen
tence indicates that it was written by
one who had repented and wished to
avoid the commission of past offenses.
The professed desire for "harmony be
tween the co-ordinate departments of
the (overnment" is very appropriate,
but the attainment of this object rests
almost wholly upon the author of the
sentiment. 'We regret that the Presi
dent is determined to perpetuate the ex
isting state of things in the South. The
only hope for peace throughout the
country is the acceptance of the olive
branch which Congress has tendered to
the States. The fears expressed by the
President that ten years will make no
change in the condition of the Union,
and that the admission olthe represent
atives from Southern communities can
not take place in the future, are ground
less. Long before that period arrives,
and perhaps before the Executive retires
to private life, and a more reliable and
patriotic statesman occupies his chair,
national harmony will prevail, and every
star in the firmament of States will glis
ten with renewed beauty and brilliancy.
We reserve other points in the message
for consideration upon another occasion.
Barefaced Deception.
"We have made arrangements with
the Western Union Telegraph company
for special dispatches for the Gazette.
So, our readers will hereafter get as late
news through our paper as from any
other source, if not. later. A continu
ation of the patronage the Gazette now
enjoys, will warrant us in issuing a
daily early in the spring. As a general
news medium, the Gazette shall be
second to no publication in the Rocky
Mountains."-Cazette, 24th ult.
The operator of the telegraph in Vir
ginia City informs us that the foregoing
statement is utterly groundless. The
PosT is the only newspaper in the Terri
tory that pays for the telegrams which
are transmitted by the Western Union
Telegraph company to Montana. Wil
kinson is striving to gain subscribers
and has no hesitation in publishing any
article that will mislead people. The
only arrangements whlich have been
made by the (Garte to obtain "late
news," are evidently the following: To
take from the oolusas of the Post all
it requires and make its readers think
they ae getting the latest dispatches.
Extraordinary Iagsitation.
On the evening of the 6th inst., the
Council passed a law defining the com
petency of witnesses, and prohibiting all
Negroes and mulattoes from testifying
in actions in which white men are par
ties to the record. Every person having
one-quarter of negro blood shall be
deemed a negro within the meaning of
this provision. At a time in the history
of the country, when States that were
recently in rebellion are enacting statutes
which allow individuals to go upon the
witness stand, without regard to color,
it is proposed in the Legislature of Mon
tana to reject the results of the war and
the destruction of African slavery. The
Territory is to be placed in direct oppo
sition to the progress of civilization of
the age in which we live, in order that a
prejudice against the complexion of a
race, that originated in the spirit of
slavery, may be gratified. Will anybody
contend that the intention to utter
words of truth may be determined by
examining the pigment of the skin ? Is
the crime of perjury unknown among the
whites? There is no justice whatever
in drawing the distinction which has
been set forth in the proposed bill. The
proper course which should be observed
in the practice of the courts, need not be
commented on at length. We maintain
that all parties should be permitted to
state under oath such facts as are perti
nent to the cast:, and the jury should
weigh the testimony effecting their char
acter and decide to receive or reject the
evidence. Without submitting an argu
ment upon our proposition, which seems
to be the embodiment of reason, we
would call the attention of law-makers
to other considerations. Congress pos
sesses the power to sweep aside the laws
of the Legislature, and there is a grave
question involving their legality. We
desire most earnestly, as we have fre
quently proclaimed in the colums of the
POST, to see all doubts of this nature re
moved. Suppose this section is read by
the members of the present Congress,
the effect will be injurious to the inter
ests of every resident of the Territory.
The people will be viewed by the repre
sentatives from West Virginia, Tennes
see, Missouri and other loyal states
as hopeless barbarians. The objec
tionable statute could not be ap
proved, and the tendency to measure
the whole code by this standard would
be very strong. We hope that motives
of policy will govern the legislators, if
they cannot overcome their theories of
the constitutional inability of a negro to
be a truthful witness, and that the sec
tion will be struck out. The number of
Africans in Montana is small, and there
is no urgent necessity for the passage of
this statute, even if we concede that the
logical deductions of the friends of the
measure are correct. In conclusion, we
would cite for the benefit of those that
advocate this provision, the first section
of the civil rights Act: "All persons
born in the United States * * * *
of every race and color * * * shall
have the same right in every State and
Territory * * * to give evidence
* * * and to tull and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the secu
rity of persons and property, as is en
joyed by white citizens, and shall be
subject to like punishment, pains and
penalties, and to none other, any law,
statute * * * to the contrary not
withstanding." The Legislature might
as well attempt to repeal the organic
Act, as to trample upon one of the most
just and equitable enactments that was
ever placed upon the pages of history by
the Congress of the United States. The
action of the Council, which called forth
these observations, was reversed upon
the following day, and the bill was lost.
We acquired this gratifying informaticn
when it was too late to exclude our com
ments. We cannot eulogize too highly
the Democratic Councilmen for their
wisdom and patriotic spirit in rejecting
the iniquitous measure.
APPOINTMENT.--Joseph D. Wells of
the District of Columbia, has been ap
pointed by the President agent for the
Flatheads and other confederated tribes
of Indians in this Territory.-Democrat,
6th inst.
We know nothing concerning Mr. Wells
except what is contained in the foregoing
paragraph. We infer, however, that he
is not fitted to fill the important position
because he is a resident of the District
of Columbia. It is very strange that the
government continues to overlook the
claims of citizens of the border States,
who are thoroughly acquainted with the
customs and condition of the Indians,
and selects the agents from the list of
professional office-seekers. As long as
this class of inexperienced persons are
appointed, the abuses of the existing or
der of things will be pepetuated. We
- have no hesitation in asserting that
there are hundreds of men in Montana,
L who are superior to Mr. Wells and bet
" ter qualified to superintend the affairs of
the Flatheads and other. tribes. These
remarks do not apply particularly to the
"powers that be," but may be considered
of a general nature. We trust that a
r much desired reform in the admiistra
tion oT Indian matters will take place,
I but there appears to be as immediate
prospeet of say chbse in the prseat
pOlis.
Telegraphic Dispatches
Reported for the '4 Tri-Weekly Post,"
bythe W. U. Tel. Co.
Report of the Secretary of the Trea.
sory.
NEw YORK, Dec. 3.-The following is
a summary of the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury. The receipts have
exceeded the estimates $89,905,905.
The expenditures have fallen short of
the estimates $200,529,235. lie recom
mends a further diminution in taxes,
and says the present generation with
proper economy can pay the debt. lie
regrets, notwithstanding the large re
duction of the national debt, and the
satisfactory condition in other respects
of the treasury, that little progress has
been made since his last report toward
specie payments. He explains at length
his action concerning the disposal of
surplus gold, and recommends that the
national banks be compelled to redeem
at a single Atlantic city the curtailment
of the currency, and a careful revision
of the tariff to make it harmonize with
our internal taxes. lie recommends the
issue of twenty years' bonds at five per
cent., payable in England or Germany
to an amount sufficient to absorb the
six per cent. bonds now held in Europe,
and to meet the demand there for ac
tual and permanent investment, and the
rehabitation of the Southern States.
He says he is of the opinion that specie
payments may be resumed, or ought to
be resumed as early as the first day of
July, 1868. The public debt on October
31st. 1866, exclusive of cash in the trea
sury, was $2,681,636,966.34.
As to the commercial intercourse with
the British American States, the Secre
tary adheres to his opinion that our rev
enue system should be fully revised and
adjusted to the financial situation of the
country. The remainder of the report
is devoted to statistics of the depart
ment. The fleet of five hundred and
ninety ocean transports maintained at a
daily expense of $82,400, was reduced
before June 30, 1866, to fifty-three ves
sels, costing $3,000 per day, and most of
these have since been discharged. Of
two hundred and sixty-two vessels em
ployed inland at an expense of $3,193,
none were in service June 30th, 1866.
The sale of river transports, etc., during
the year, amounted to $1,152,892; the
cash sales of railroad equipments to $3,
466,737; credit sales. $7,444,073, of
which $1,200,085, principal and interest,
have been paid, leaving due June 30,
1866, $6,570,074. The military telegraph
has been discontinued and sold. All
unnecessary materials and stores have
also been disposed of at satisfactory
prices. The recruiting of the regulars
has progressed, and there is now an ag
gregate of 25,430 men. During the fis
cal year ending June 30th, 1866, $10,
431,004 were disbursed to the army and
military academy, and $2,489,433.13 to
volunteers.
Report of the Secretary of War.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.--The following
is a summary of the report of the Secre
tary of War: The entire number of
volunteers to be mustered out, paid and
transported, in May, 1865, was 1,023,864.
By November 1st, 1866, 1,012,822 were
mustered out, leaving in service 11,042
white and colored soldiers. The aggre
gate reduction of colored troops during
the year has been 7,524, leaving in the
service about ten thousand officers and
enlisted men. Past experience shows
that in national emergencies our armies
could be swiftly organized to at least the
full strength of a million men. From
May 1st, 1865, to August 2d, 1866, over
267,000 horses and mules were sold for
$15,269,075 54. Barracks, hospitals and
other building sold, brought $447,873,
and damaged clothing $9,527,700.
