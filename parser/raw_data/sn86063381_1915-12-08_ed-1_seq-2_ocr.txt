'ntSiCWES JN AL1 THE PRINCIPAL CJT
MESSAGE A TRIUMPH.
President Wilson's message which
he delivered to congress yesterday
was a triumpha triumph of calm
ness and sanity, devoted to the ends
of patriotic action.
Devoted to national /defense the
question of financing the defense,
revenues, the medium for fostering
the most desirable international rela
tions of trade and friendship, a mer
chant marine and the problem of
European intrigue on American soil
it was distinctly a war message
and it was also a distinctly American
message.
During the entire long message
there was but one note of passion and
that was when the president charac
terized the citizens of the United
States who have poured the poison
of disloyalty into the arteries of na
tional life.
The chief thoughts of the message
are as follows:
All the governments of America
stand on a footing of genuine equal
ity and unquestioned independence.
Our concern for the independence
and the prosperity of the states of
Central and South America is not
altered. We still mean always to
make a common cause of national in
dependence and of political liberty
in America.
Whether we have benefited Mexico
by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen.
Conquest and dominion are not our
reckoning or agreeable to our prin
ciples. We will not maintain a
standing army except for uses which
are as necessary in times of peace as
in times of war.
The plans of the war department
contemplate an increase of the standi
ing force of our regular .army to 181,-
843. These are the additions neces
sary to render the army adequate for
its present duties.
The plan also contemplates sup
plementing the army by a force of
40(h000 disciplined citizens.
The program of the secretary of
the navy involves only the:
Pioneerstitutionsr
shorten-
ing of the time within which plans
long matured shall be carried out.
It is necessary for many weighty
reasons of national efficiency and de
velopment that we should have a
great merchant, marine.
There are citizens of the United
States who have poured the poison
of disloyalty into the very arteries of
our national life. Such.creatures of
passion, disloyalty and anarchy* must
be crushed out.
WOMEN EDUCATION IEAfDEES.
Of the 12,000 conspicuous r.posi-:
tions, largely of an administrative
character, listed- in the* 1915-16 edu
cational directory justvissuect' by the*
Bureau of Education at Washington,*
2,500 are held by women. There
are women who are college presi
dents, state superintendents of pub
lic instruction^ directors of!
industrial
training, heads of -departments of
education in colleges and universi
ties, directors of schools for afflicted
and exceptional children and librar
ians.
Twenty-four of the 622 colleges'
and universities listed in the. direct-?
tory are presided over by women. OfI
the nearly 3,000 county superintend-!
ents in the country, 508 are women/
The tendency to fill this position with
women is almost wholly confined to
the West. One state, Montana, has
not one man as county superintend
ent. Wyoming has: only two. Ken
tucky is the only southern state that
utilizes women in this office this
state has 26 women as county super
intendents. On the other hand,
there are only 26 women city super
intendents in a total of over 2,000.
Seventy institutions for the blind
are listed in the directory. Of these
15 are directed by women. Of the
75 state schools for the deat ten are
under the leadership of women and
of the 22 private institutions of the
same character, 16 bave^ women su
perintendents. Of the 31 private in-
&>'f%^g
for the feeble-minded) 20
are unde supervision of women.
Fourteen out of 86 directors of
industrial schools are women and 48
of the 200 schools of art are in charge
of- women. Women -have almost a
monopoly on library positions. Out
of 1,300 public and -social libraries
given in the directory women super
vise 1,075.
The government bureau of educas
tion itself- exemplifies the call for
women in executive educational, posi-
ALL FOR ONE, ANTON FOR ALL.In
(Minneapolis Journal.)
The State Development conference
last week was a harmonious and judg
matical gathering. It .adopted a sys
tematic program for the development
of Minnesota that commends itself
to the public by its breadth and its
practicality.
But the spirit behind the program
was after all, the salient feature of
the conference and the thing that
most inspires hope for the future."
This spirit was that of active, un
selfish cooperation for the upbuild
ing of the whole state. It involves
the sinking of sectional differences,
such as have at times brought about
the pitting against each other of
South and North, of country arid
city. It calls for the sincere adop
tion of the motto of Dumas' immortal
Musketeers"All for one, and one
for all."
The last item on the program,
"More farmers for Minnesota," really
contains the pith and point of the
whole list. It is the supreme pur
pose of which all the other items are
corollaries. Precisely in the propor
tion that more farmers are induced
to settle in Minnesota and cultivate
the soil, will the development of the
state proceed. We have only to as
certain what is necessary to do to
secure more farmers, and we shall
have learned how to bring this great
state into its own.
Obviously, if farming is made at
tractive and profitable, the farmers
will come. With this fact as a foun
dation, the other items of the pro
gram naturally follow. See how
practically every item bears on this
purpose:
Passage of Amendment Number
One means that a revolving fund.may
be established to clear and make
ready for settlement state lands,
which must otherwise remain un
touched.
A soil survey means that incoming
farmers will have made easier for
them the selection of the sort of lands
they want.
A comprehensive system of state
drainage means the reclamation of
vast areas of fertile lands for culti-
vation.
Adoption of Amendment Number
Two authorizing the loan of state
trust funds on farm lands, together
with legislation for a system of rural
credits, means that farming enter?
prises can be easily and safely
financed.
A state system of arterial roads!
the improvement and development o^
rural highways, and the enforcement
of the laws for road-dragging and foij
road maintenance generally, mean1
that the farmer is to have the chance
to get his produce to market cheaply
and quickly, and is thus to net largeij
profits therefrom.
The suppression of noxious weeds!
has an obvious application tor the pur-i
suit of profitable farming.
Forest protection and reforestra-j
tion of non-agricultural lands may be
classed with conservation and.propa-j
gation of fish and game, as measures
that Will help the farmer indirectly
but none the less positively.
And the need of larger appropria
tions for the State Immigration bu-i
reau is plainly dictated by the re
solve to have more farmers in Min
nesota.
Thus considered, the -program
adopted is seen to be admirably fo
cused on the determination to de-j
velop agriculture as the keynote of
state development. The greater suc
cess will follow hard on the heels of
general and energetic co-operation.
