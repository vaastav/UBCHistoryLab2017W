Weliavc the assurance or the Helena^Journal that the Inter Mmintnin need^not feel ^any uneasiness^ concerning^the president's attitude on the silver^MftUon; we hare the Inter Sloiin^tain't ^TCRrets^ that the president *^message Mid not a word in favor of^free coinage; we have history to show^that the president threatened in June^to veto free coinage and the sentence^in the message which refers to free^coinage as ^impulsive^ legislation^therelnre the Inter Mountain mourns^as those without hope, while the assur^^ances of the Helena Journal are not^worth the space they take up in type.
Whenthe floor of congress is the^scene of deadly conflict in the war en-^gaginir this government with the^American Indian, the contest is not^apt to lie bloody but the evidences of^marked personal courage on the part^ol congress are not the less notewori li\.^^lust now Washington is the seat ol^Indian disturbances and the mutt^made a splendid strategic movement^last Thursday by discussing Mr. Mor^gan's resolution, which provides for an^appropriation of ^^^,00u for an investi^gatioii into the causes of the trouble^among the Indians. The most ungen^^erous critic d the government's Indian^methods must admit that, at least, tins^bill means 11 vigorous policy -in lieluilf^of the fellows who study the cause ol^trouble for and in consideration of the^sum of ^^1 to tnem in hand paid.
Oneof yesterday's dispatches from^Chicago is of local interest and tells of^the pleasant ending of a rather (lis^agneable incident. It will be moan^bered that Mr. ^ ullen, of Salt Lake^City, was one of the patrons of the^association meeting held last summer^in this city. The gentleman's hone^was not as fortunate as his bac kers^had anticipated, and in the ilush of the^moment Mr. Cullen indulged in com^^ment regarding the judges which war^ranted them in expelling him from the^association. 0.1 reflection, Mr. ( ullen^became satisfied that there was no war^rant tor his hasty remarks and he took^early opportunity to make ample apol^ogy to the gentlemen who bad |kt^formed the exacting duties incident to^service in the judges' stand. The gen^t 1 man's explanation was entirely satis^MM and it was agreed that tin omt^should not be pressed before the hoard^of appeals. Yesterday's dispttch says^that the petition for the reiiiBtati im nt^of Mr. ( ullen wiis granted: so that,^once more, all's well that ends well.
STS LATEST PHASf S^It would take half of an observing^man's time to keep track of the silver^bills that go pouring into congress.^Thev are of all sorts and conditions,^some of them proposing an entire new^order of legislation, others of them pro^viding amendments more or les* radi^^cal to the lull w hich the hous.' of rep^resetitatives passed in .lime, and^which, after amendment and revision,^Ueime the law under which silver is^now running its erratic course in the^New York stock exchange.
llicreare two reason* Why these^measures are not worthy of particular^review. In the first place, some of^them evidently do not proposi an^effective retredy for a metal Which is^In a sickly way. and, secondly, the in^lerei.ee to be drawn Trom President^Harn- - ,ige, from Secretary^Windoni a report and from the action^ol Speaker Keed is that the republican^majority intends to stand bv last lum^legislation and that when, ju^llinll of next year, the present con^^Mends is^ career, it will be disco*^ered that no change has been tolerate.I^in regard to the policy which the^Ma miii administration Intel is I ^^pursue toward silver. More's the pity^that free coinage wai killed in the^bouse ot its friends; so much the more^deplorable it is that, in the house of^representatives, last summer, con^gressinen trom state* of the North^west lailed at the very BMkWl when^111 senate and house aentimcnt was^ripe for the passage of a free coinage^bill.
Inthe end, silver will probably get^its dues as the result of action 111 con^gress which will essentially be mm^partisan, just as it* interests wen'^effectively promoted by the action of^the M.Louis convention, where parly^lines were ignored. If ^election were^made from members representing the^two political parties, it would Is- eas\^to figure out a majority for the metal^It seems probable that nothing w..;^done during the short session of eon^grew, because the administration and^the political influences that surround it^can MM in check any combination ol^forces that may organize in behalf n|^silver while speaker Heed sits in the^presiding oil cer's chair.
I1 1 MM congress is soon to be or-^famwdL If 111 turn its majority provel
hostileto silver, as is highly improb^^able, a combination of political ele^ments will undoubtedly pass a free^coinage bill, of course, then as now,^it will be in the power of President^Harrison to use the veto power, as he^threatened to apply it last summer, but^a house of representatives so largely^democratic as the next house is to be^will pay no heed to the executive^threat. The desired bill will doubtless^l^e passed, many republicans will vote^for it, and. il the president then with^^hold* ids signature, the incomplete^measure will pass as the obituary^rotneof Mr Harrison's party for the^ye ir im
Themeagre n ference to the -hit^IMtttoa In the annual report of secre^^tary Windoni is the surprising fact in^connection with the current disciiRsion^of the metal. The secretary simply^says that the fluctuations in price are^due to speculation, that the stock gam^bling fraternity can flood the market^at any time, that Ktirope can send in^any quantity of the metal, and that if^the government were to buy up the en^tire stock now in sight it would not be^long before the speculating element^could again flood the market and that^thus the processes which tend to de^^press the price of silver umld be kept^up indefinitely. This is the logic of^the treasury department of the Tinted^states, and all there is of it, Mr. Win^dom enlarging one perplexity of the^situation so as to make it stand for the^situation itself.
Ifthe secretary presents the problem^on its real merit, there is no such thing^as a silver question and all legislation^designed to promote the metal's inter^^est is not only uncalled for but is^Melons us well. However, the advo^cates of silver w ill not surrender until^the fallacy in their cause is demon^strated by a fairer friend than silver^finds in the present secretary of the^t reasury.
THEUNHAPPY OUTCOME.^In the conference of nationalists^held in London at noon of Thursday,^Mr. I'arnell faced some of his friends^and a good many of those who now,by^force ot circumstances, must rank as^his foes in all that relates to home rule^leadership. 1'gly words were ex^^changed in the conference. Some of^them wore aimed with unerring sever^ityat.Mr. I'arnell, while, it must be^said, the unlortuiiate leader's replies^were not uia de in praiseworthy speech.^In view of all the surroundings of bis^case, it seems as if Mr. I'arnell was^rather too exacting in what be de^mantled of his associates. Neverthe^^less, be was permitted practically to^! have his own way. and the case was^I left for linal adjudication until the^ultimatum should come from (ilad-^stone. In any event, Thursday's bitter^utterances will leave their sting and^Inure and more the untoward influence^resulting from Mr. I'arnell's social^lapse will unfold themselves.
Thest.wii vim hoped from the lirst^that, in the leadership, a term of pro^ballon might l^e vouchsafed to Mr.^I'arnell. That course seem* out of the^question now, and the confession must^be made that, by his own conduct^toward (iladstone and the supporters^of home rule, the misguided leader has^hurt the cause and maddened his crit^^ics beyond the point where reconcilia^t ion seems possible.
POSTOrFlCEMETHODS^Many |^coplc 111 this part of the world^will Ik- disposed to take exception to^some ot the mithods which, according^to the postmaster general's report, he^proposes to introduce into the future^mail sen ice of this country. The ptf^^pie of this part of the I 'nion have al^^ready many just causes of complaint^against the manner in which the busi^lies* of the department of which Mr.^Wauamakcr is the head is conducted.^Never 111 the history ot Montana has^the mail service in this state been so^completely unsatislactoi^ as at pros^^At Withil I lew months theSTAMi^Attn has called attention to a full score^of unnecessary annoyances to which^the people in this city and llutte have^In in subjected by lack of attention to^their inti rests on the part of the post^otlice department in W ashington.

Montana'smail service has fared, ill^at the hands of the administration of^Mr Harrison. In every department of^the public service it has been in order^to ignore tin1 claims of this slate, but^this neglect is particularly conspicuous^in relereiice to postal matter*. The^trouble has two sources. In the lirst^place Mr. Wanamaker, like most of the^I. .nil is at Washington, cannot bring^himself to understand the conditions^that obtain in this state. We are too^far removed from the capital city.^Distance obscures our needs. It^is not easy for the staid and^conservative merchant in the Quaker^city to comprehend the rapidity oi^western progress Then, Mr. Wan*^maker is too prone to conduct the^I ol the country as he con^duels Ins dry goods store. Ilismeth^oils are too businesslike. He wants to^^ mak- it pay.^ serving the public is^^lily a secondary consideration. He^forget* that the prime object in the^government undertaking mail delivery^wa* not to make money for the gov^eminent but to serve the people. Mr^Wanamaker ligurea that because the
revenue*of the postal department la^t^year amounted to fHHH^M and the^service cost *ilt'),^M.^),(l^vl that there is^therefore a ^deficit^ of *!S,7Srt,3(lO. He^seems to forget that more than sixty^millions were paid by direct taxation^in the form of postage and less than^six millions out of the general revenue^which is contributed by the people in^general, from the navy there Is no^revenue. Why does not the secretary^of war place the entire cost of its main^^tenance in thedelicit column
Then,in the matter of public build^^ings we are told by this close listed^merchant that ^be favors, whenever^practicable, inexpensive oire-story^buildings.^ Had he been in charge of^affairs he would, upon the same princi^^ple, have built the capitol at Washing^ton like a Front street boarding house.^There is just a shade too much ^busi^^ness^ about this to suit the tastes ol^the greatest nation of modern times.
Aword more. The postmaster gen^^eral must know that while Montana^pays her full share of the postal ieve-^nues in the matter of stamp purchase,^she pins a vast deal more than her^share of his six million ^dellcit.^ Xot^more than four staples produced in this^state are protected, while the |^eople^of Montana contribute to his six^million dollar purse by almost every^article they buy. As a business man^Mr. Wanamaker should see that Mon^^tana Is entitled to more than she re-^reives from his department.

Salttake City is excited over a wild ru^^mor that K. I'. Vining is to be returned to^the truffle management of the I'nion Pa^^cific. The 7Vih^iir enter* a very emphatic^protest against such an act. The truth^is that the I'nion Pacific ha* not yet re^^covered from the shock which Vining^gave to it* I -,uess by hi* arbitrary and^despotic iiiauugi mi nt. He is a petty ty^^rant, ami treated the natrons of the road^as if they wrn- his slaves. Hit reappoint^ment would result in a *tam|^cde of ship-^|iers to the Burlington, the Ris k Island,^the Saute Fe any line in fact to prevent^freight from falling into the hands of^Vining. It would be a virtual boom for^the new Grand Valley route w Inch OotMag^else could give it. For the aakc of Un^^people who are isniipelb-d to patronise the^I'liion Pacific the ,\^tcs ho|ves to sec^some mall placed in the po-itnui, in case^a change is to Ik- made, who has some^slight regard for lommoii justice and
fliftyare not to be entrusted with the^car. nf important official duties .especially^legislation. The poor old senator i* inex-^preisihly shocked at the clean sweep made^by the young men in his state, and lie sees^in it much trouble in the future. Much^as people may be inclined to laugh* at the^ridiculous position thus assumed bg Sen^^ator Hoar, tbey should not forget that he^voices tht gcuerul dislike among republi^^can leaders to ynung men. Progresiire^ideas and a clearer knowledge of the^present sentiment* of the American peo^^ple, who animate the minds of the young^men, are fatal to the reactionary spirit of^the republican party, which, under it*^Bourbon management, lives in the past,^and believe* that the reckle** mothod* in^legislutinn and the conduct of govern^^mental departments, which ^^ r. *ub-^milled to during the Grant regime, will^pa** unquestioned nowaday*.
Republicanorgans have particularly^Inveighed against the influence of the col^^leges on young men, and have deplored^the advanced view* of the college gradu^^ates in economic and tariff subject*. The^democratic party, while ever honoring^and res|k^cting those grand leaders who^bore the burden of the fight in the dark^days when intolerance, corruption and^blind lust of power prevailed at Washing^^ton, look* to its young men as it* maiti-^*tay and supreme reliance. It is the party^of the people, and, a* such, it keep* pare^with the advance cf the people. It has^c.i i behind it the useless lumber of obso^^lete issues, whirl) cannot be regarded as^having any political significance at the^present day, and it devotes itself to the^study of what the people really want and^require. Senator Hoar's wail over the^influence of the young men, while it is in^accordance with the prevailing policy of^his party, can only exclto pity and smiles^from those to whom it is particularly^directed. The young men have entered^the nolitlcal field to stay, and fossils mutt^retire gracefully or be rudely elbowed^out of the way. If the young men are^mainly attracted towards the democratic^party it is because that party represents^the true sentiment* of the American peo^^ple.
