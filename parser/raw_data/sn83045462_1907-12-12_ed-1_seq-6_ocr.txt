????? No Third Term.
The President has done exactly the right
thing in making last night s announce
ment. He has silenced criticism, which he
Kirs felt to be undeserved, of his sincerity
aad steadfastness of purpose. He will
(jl'anrt for his place in history upon the
great record of achievement of his two
terms of service, and will not suffer the
loss of prestige which would naturally
Result from any yielding on his part to
.the "third-term" temptation.
JJy his latest declaration the President
hes put it out of the power of even the
most irrepressible of his admirers to
-Icade further upon his name in connec
tion with the third-term proposition. He
reaffirms his declaration of elections
?ight and the meat of that is this:
l*nder no circumstances will I be a can
didate for or accept another nomination."
The man who now insists on booming Mr.
Roosevelt for next year's republican lead
ership offends against both his chief and
common sense.
MIVhat brought forth this second deliver
ance is one of those subjects in which all
politicians revel. It lends itself to many
theories, and one man's theory is as good
hk another's. The wildest theory ad
vanced may hope for a hearing. The
f'fayton resolution in the House, we are
told, caused the President to quake in his
boots. In fact, so menacing was the
Situation produced by that maneuver that
John Sharp Williams, out of pure com
passion, went to the White House and
advised Mr. Roosevelt to Etand from un
der.
Un the other hand, an octopus victory
is read Into the statement. The Presi
dent has surrendered, after his strenuous
tussle with plutocracy. The trusts have
proved too many for him. Seeing that
be was blacklisted, he withdrew, leaving
It for Mr. Bryan to come in and take
and finish the fight. And bo forth.
These are samples of the explanations
instantly thrown off, and which will mul
tiply as the days go by. The topic Is
good for a long run.
The other point of interest relates to
the field of republican aspirants. Whose
boom is benefited? Whose boom had the
President the desire to benefit? And here
again are theories without number. Taft
will come with a rush now, we are told.
. Faraker scores heavily. Is another guess.
:It will be Hughes if he lives, with some
middle state man for second place. How
.ettn Fairbanks help but sweep things?
"Should not Mr. Cannon enjoy tonight the
best sleep in months?
Jt may be that the President will feel
??the prod now on this score. Has he a
.purpose to impose a favorite on the re
publican convention? And, if so, who is
the favorite? And what form will his
-purpose take? How will he make known, 1
shbrt of a plain announcement, what his
.wishes may be about a successor? Here,
jt majr be seen, is a lush field for rumor
and speculation, and that the laborers
will be many and their activity ceaseless
calls for no assurance. For at least three
months count that day lost which brings
no yarn showing the President molding
?tHe republican convention to his wishes
about the candidate, and using the whole
patronage of the government to compass
his end.
Davis.
^Senator Davis should not be discour
se The President's third term an
nouncement overshadows the speech in the
Senate, but such was not the President's
intention, we may all be sure. It Just so
happened. Another time the senator may
have the stage all to himself. He had
tiglhing to complain of either as to the
size of his audience, or the attention paid
liim. A press agent, working overtime,
cgiuld not have done the senator better
m>,rvice. The chamber was filled upstairs
and down, and those who had come to
?ee remained to hear. An estimate of Mr.
Batvis' power would not be fair from this
..jirst eftort. As a stump speech it had
points of merit, and its delivery was in
the stump style. We uhall hear the sen
ator to better advantage when he discov
ers "that stumping is ineffective in the Sen
ate, and bad form.
It will be pretty hard when it comes to
asking some man who has enjoyed a
?presidential boom to accept the nomina
.tJun fof vice President.
jOi ' ?
?"Rome time will elapse before candidates
present arguments to custodians of a gen
c6r'ai campaign fund that they can be
elected with least expense to the govern
ment.
Financiers ought to be much relieved
io-see the crowds in the shops fighting to
get their money into circulation.

John Sharp Williams wants the demo
crats to work logether. Mr. Williams is
indeed a reformer.
Push the Plaza Tracks Bill!
There is no urgent national business
now.before the Senate. It Is a continuing
body, its committees standing intact aa to
organization save as the personnel
^j^jinges slightly, from session to session
and Congress to Congress. While all bills
not enacted into law expire with the Con
their relntroduction is regarded as
(ffving them Immediate new life. This
year the bill to establish rapid transit car
tracks on the Union station plaza has
been presented anew, with certain changes
suggested by the lapse of time since Con
. gtfess had its last previous opportunity to
act on this important matter. The Senate
TTIatrict committee is practically intact
and in a very few days its vacancies will
have been filled, and it will be in shape
proceed briskly with the consideratioh
measures. The bill liaa been threshed
-out again and again. Everybody under
stands it perfectly. It Is demanded by the
public interest, not by the corporations
Involved. There is no practical reason
why it cannot tw passed by both houses
'bafore holiday adjournment, carrying with
- tt a provision for the installation of emer
gency tracks, to be abandoned as soon as
the permanent-tracks are installed.
,}t is the hope of the residents of Wash
* ington that the Senate committee will set
pace for the Senate and the House
making this bill the subject of a special
order of business and hastening it through
to the point of enactment. If there Is a
disposition to delay its passage by the
proffering of amendments ot a general car*
po rat ion-regulation character, those In
charge of the bill should force the oi)posl
tlon into the open by joining: Issues at
the earliest possible date. Nothing is to
be gained by delaying the bill. If the
votes are to be had to amend it they
should be counted at once. If they are
not to be had, their absence should be
demonstrated. The responsibility for de
lay, In short, should be placed as quickly
as possible where it belongs.
There appears to be absolutely no public
sympathy with the disposition to hold up
this bill for the purpose of attaching
riders upon It, under penalty of indefinite
delay. It is generally understood that the
measure is In the Interest of the people, is
demanded by them, and is not especially
desired by the railroad companies of the
District. That understanding carries with
it the belief that there is no justice what
ever in the effort to utilize the plaza
tracks project as a means to secure the
enactment of general schemes of traction
reform. Any application by the traction
companies for extensions for their own
profit might legitimately be seized upon
as a vehicle for this sort of regulatory
legislation. But there Is no Just warrant
for holding up the public In this emer
gency and causing It to suffer inconveni
ence and even monetary loss in order to
exploit plans for street railway govern
ment which are so far-reaching in their
possible effect that they require separate
and serious consideration.
Foraker and the Senate.
There are several announcements in the
matter of a successor to Mr. Foraker lu
the Senate. Vhe republicans of Ohio have
always had strong men In their ranks,
and have such today, but when it comes
to filling Mr. Foraker's place?If they
should be called upon soon to do that?
they will be confronted by a situation
with two important aspects.
Firstly, there is the question of state
pride growing out of the record. Ohio,
for a good many years, has had at least
one great debater in the Senate. For a
long time she had two. Mr. Sherman in
his day was the leading financial author
ity of that body, while Judge Thurman
was one of the leading lawyers. Serving
together, they gave to the state marked
distinction. Mr. Sherman remained longer
than Judge Thurman, and when he drop
ped out there was Mr. Foraker to con
tinue the Buckeye prestige. Ever since
the "civil war, therefore, Ohio has cut a
commanding figure in the upper house of
Congress.
Secondly, there- is to be considered the
present situation in the Senate. The re
publicans have a large membership, but
not an exceptionally powerful debating
force. Mr. Spooner will be much missed.
He was an all-around debater of many
resources. His long speeches showed re
markable research. His part In the run
ning fire of a day's session was always
effective, and sometimes brilliant. His de
parture was a distinct loss to his party
and to the chamber.
Mr. Foraker Is of the same quality,
and of equal rank. In some particulars
he is a stronger man than Mr. Sherman
was in the latter's best days. His vo
cabulary Is larger, his range wider. He
is what Mr. Sherman was not, a trained
lawyer, equal to all the numerous ques
tions coming before the Senate Into
which a knowledge of the law enters.
In his ten years of service in the Senate
he has demonstrated as high capacity
for that body as any man who has been
a member of It in the past half century.
It follows, therefore, that the filling
of Mr. Foraker's shoes will be a most
difficult matter. Is it possible, indeed?
Admitting the party's resources In Ohio,
where Is the man who could do for the
state or for the party In the Senate what
Mr. Foraker Is doing and will continue to
do while he remains in senatorial com
mission?
It is this view of the case which makes
the course of the Taft boomers so in
excusably stupid and so regrettable.
Why have made the Taft boom anti
Foraker? Why not have appealed to the
state and to the country in the names
of both men?Taft for the presidency
and Foraker for the Senate again? What
could have been more fortunate than for
a Taft administration to have for its
senatorial champion bo virile and so gen
erously equipped a force as Mr. Foraker?
Senator Davis has done everything that
could be expected to assure his con
stituents that he does not intend, to be an
idler.
Bankers who have been accused Qf
hoarding money should immediately take
steps to show why they should not be
classified as undesirable citizens.
Chicago's claims as to the purest drink
ing water in the world have not caused
any serious disturbance In Its traffic with
Milwaukee.
Now and then a big ocean liner by run
ning aground manages to bring the rate
of steamship speed down to a conserva
tive "average.
There is nothing the President can say
about another term that will keep some
of his friends from being incredulous.
Of course it is entirely too early to dis
cuss the propriety of making Mr. Roose
velt a candidate in 1912.
A Modern Knightly Rescue.
Keen dramatic interest attaches to
the story told by a trained nurse who
went from New Jersey to North Carolina
to become the housekeeper of a sup
posedly wealthy planter of the latter
state. She found him to be a crusty,
penurious, insolent old wretch who threat
ened her life and kept her virtually a
prisoner for days, until she managed by
stealth to communicate with friends and
was - finally rescued. Something of the
romance of the ancient days of chivalry
is suggested by the tale. The enchained
princess is a spectacled young woman
with a hospital training. The villainous
captor is a slouchy. whiskered curmud
geon with a strong dialect and doubtless
with a clay pipe in his lips. The castle
becomes a log cabin of two rooms. There
is no moat, no high tower, no stem sen
try. But there is a rescuing champion.
He wears a policeman's uniform and
neath his coat twinkles the star badge
of office. Jle rides upon no prancing
steed, but' travels by train and buck
board. He carries no lance, ready for a
tilt with the monster, but in his hip pocket
a five-chambered revolver awaits his
bidding. He talks In the vernacular of
New Jersey and probably never said
"By my halldome" or "Marry, sirrah,"
in his life. Very likely he has a wife
and family of his own and will never
marry the fair maiden whom he has res
cued from her sad and piteous plight.
And he did not slay the villain, but after
ordering him to hold up his hands he
made off with the hysterical trained
nurse, leaving the mqpster to his fate
at the hands of the excited peasantry.
But somehow or other the peasantry
of Halifax, N. C., are rather slow to act.
We read of no crusade against the
wretched Pender, no marching of an In
dignant populace to the cabin in the
pines and the execution of summary pun
ishment. One might have expected more
brisk treatment of the case. They are
not always so deliberate down in that
neck of woods in matters which touch
upon the brutality of man toward woman.
Instead of organising a posse bent upon
executing summary punishment upon the
scoundrel the good people of Halifax
want tbe young woman to return tram
New Jersey and give testimony In court.
Truly, a perfectly legal measure, and
wholly proper as a means of administer
ing Justice, but strangely out of keeping
with local traditions and perhaps en
couragingly suggestive of the growth of
respect for law and order.
having called the President "the great
White Father," the Indians of Nebraska
refer to Senator Burkett as the "Great
White Uncle." This looks like a deter
mination on the part of the senator's
constituents to boost him into the presi
dential family.
The President's message was at all
events as good as many speeches of equal
length that will be delivered at the Capi
tol this winter.
Vapan appears to be getting ready to
see If it can be as fortunate in commerce
as it has been in war.
SHOOTING STABS.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Approval.
"What do you think of that official's de
cision not to run for office any more?"
"It's all right," answered the implacable
foe. "My only regret is that it can't be
made retroactive."
A Business Man's View.
"Wealth," remarked the man who mor
alizes, "can be made a great influence for
good." '
"Yes," answered Mr. Dustin Stax: "and
yet when you start In with the kind of
a man who has to be hired to be good.
It's mighty hard to get your money's
worth."
The New Member.
He broke the shackles which had bound
His eloquence. He made his bow
And spoke his maiden speech?and found
He hadn't said much, anyhow!
Preferable.
"Do you prefer coins without mottoes?"
"Yea," answered the struggling citizen.
"It's a good idea; infinitely preferable to
mottoes without coin."
In Doubt.
"Even the richest man never knows ex
actly how much money he has," remarked
the economist.
"I suppose so," answered Mr. Cumrox;
"anyhow, not when his family Is out at
tending to Christmas shopping."
"It ain* near as foolish," said Uncle
Eben, "foh a boy to believe In Santy
Claus as it is foh a growed-up man to sit
down and trust to luck."
The Panacea.
We're passing laws to make the careless
people pay their debts,
And regulate their habits as to drinks and
cigarettes.
Perhaps we have discovered in the statu
tory power
A remedy for every crying evil of the
hour!
80 what's the use of hairing snow, or any
kind of storm,
Let's have the weather bureau authorized
to keep things warm.
'Tls very little trouble to bid all the winds
be still?
I guess I'll get my congressman to intro
duce a bill!
There's any number of complaints that I
believe are due;
There's far too little resting, and there's
too much work to do.
There's too much Impoliteness 'mongst
the people that you meet
In shops and cars and offices and on the
public street.
Opinions are too numerous on questions
of the day;
I fall to see the good of most opinions
anyway.
There are too many talking, and there's
no one keeping still?
I guess I'll get my congressman to intro
duce a bill!
Boil Them All Down.
From the Pittsburg Poet.
Who reads the President's recent mes
sage all through? Who is in the habit of
reading such state papers as these in their
unabridged form? Who goes through
from choice, or for his own edification,
any of the annual department reports or
similar governmental publications? Is it
not true that most people now depend for
their impressions of men and affairs not
upon what the principals say In the mat
ter, but what those who condense, analyze
and edit their too prolonged diffuse ut
terances say that they have said?
Demands on Diplomats.
From the New Orleans Picayune.
Another burden of the American ambas
sador or minister abroad is the importu
nity of his fellow-countrymen for social
favors, such as presentation at court, in
troduction to persons of mark and the
like. Every American traveler seems to
feel that the American minister is In duty
bound to look after him, introduce him
into the best society and make him feel at
home. It Is naturally something of a
task to avoid these importunities without
making powerful enemies, who, however
insignificant abroad, yet wield great in
fluence at home.
Write Legibly.
From the Boston City Club Bulletin.
A larger number of checks are received
at the office each day on which it is al
most Impossible to decipher signatures, and
much time is lost In trying to read them.
It will greatly facilitate the work of the
bookkeeping department if members will
exercise care in signing their checks.
Plain signatures will very often prevent
many errors In accounts which otherwise
are unavoidable.
They Will Not Stack.
\
From the Indianapolis Star.
It appears that the new gold coins
won't stack up. A good many people
have found this true of the old coins,
and not because their designs were in
too high relief, either.
Show Mercy.
From the St. Louis Republic.
Give the employes of the retail stores
a chance to enjoy the supreme holiday of
the year by finishing your Christmas pur
chases long before Christmas eve. Don't
fag the?m out with bargain rushes at the
very end.
Modern Inv^htions.
From the Salt Lake Tribune.
Financiers penhapg Imagine that they
are merely keeping up with this advanc
ing age when they invent the groundless
panic and the friendless President.
_ Up Against Competition.
From the Chicago Journal.
In Los Angeles they are building what
Is said to be "the crookedest railroad in
the world." It will have to be a daisy If
it can beat some of the Harrlman cor
porations.
A Fast Man.
F\wn the Detroit Journal.
Secretary Taft went through Berlin, had
lun?h with Ambassador Tower, waved at
the kaiser, drank a stein of beer, had his
picture taken and shook 3.450 hands with"
out losing hie stride.
Tardy.
From the Columbus Dispatch.
By the way, isn't Representative Rich
mond Pearson Hobson a little slow with
his big naval propaganda? A week has
now passed and he has not yet been heard
from.
Should Please Anthony.
From the LoulsTllle Courier Journal.
At any rate the trousered eagle on the
new gold coins will be satisfactory to Mr.
Cooptock.
