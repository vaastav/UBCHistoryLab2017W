Sham Love of Nature.
Praising 'he genuine love of nature
which exists in the hearts of so many
quiet people, who have a real delight
in the silent and exquisite changes,
the influx and efllux of life which we
tall the seasons, an anonymous Eng- ,
lish writer says: "Those who are
fortunate enough to spend their lives
in the quiet country-side have much
of this tranquil and nnuttered love of
nature; and others, again, who are
condemned by circumstances to spend ]
tlieir days in toilsome towns, and yet
have the instinct, derived perhaps
from long generations of country fore
fathers. feel this beauty, in the short
weeks when they are enabled to ap
proach it. more poignantly still. The
fact remains, however, that a love of
natuie is a part of the panoply of culti
vation which at the present time peo
ple above a certain social standing feel
bound to assume. Very few ordinary
persons would care to avow that they
took no interest in national politics,
in games and sports in literature, in
appreciation of nature, or in religion. 1
As a matter of fa'-i. the vital interest
that is taken in these subjects, per
haps in games and sports, is far below
the interest that is expressed in them.
A person who said frankly that he
thought that any of these subjects were
uninteresting, tiresome or absurd,
would be thought stupid or affected, j
even brutal. Probably most of the
people who express a deep concern for
these things believe that they aie giv
ing utterance to a sincere feeling; but,
not to expatiate on the emotions which
they mistake for rea! emotion in the
other departments, there are probably
a good many people who mistake for
a love of nature the pleasure of fresh
air, physical movement, and change of
scene. Many worthy golfers, for in
stance. who do not know that they are
talking insincerely, attribute, in con
versation. the pleasure they feel in
pursuing their game to the agreeable
surroundings in which it is pursued;
but my secret belief is that they pay
more attention to the lie of the little
white ball, and to the character of
bunkers, than to the pageantry of sea
and sky."
Trot Out the "Tumblers."
It appears that x leading society
woman of New York, one of the front
rankers in the extended Four Hun
dred, has decreed that large diamonds
must be worn this season, instead of
small ones. Every little while it is
necessary for some one prominent in
the upper circles to recall the society
clan to a sense of its duty to itself
and an admiring public. It is so easy
to get careless about one's diamonds.
Perhaps a cluster of little dazzlers may
have a more easily inserted pin than
the solitaires at the bottom of thf
casket. And then, again, suggests the
Clveland Plain Dealer, these society
women are apt to seize the firsjt gems
that come to hand, regardless of their
comparative value. A necklace of
stones as large as marrowfat peas
may clasp more ea. ly perhaps than
the ordinary moth-ball pattern, but no
society woman with a proper pride
should permit horsed i<» employ any
such excuse for her neglect of the
politer usages of ihe Newport set.
Bring out the big diamonds, then,
and hang em where they may be seen
of all nii n. Let th< little stones rattle

REPUBLICANS STAND SOLID
Talk of a Split in the Ranks of the
Party Is All Balder
dash.
It is safe to disregard the story from
Washington that the republicans in
congress will split over the question of
railway rate regulation. A division of
opin.on exists now among the repub
lican members of the senate, interstate
commerce committee, but there are ev
idences that this will practically or ac
tually disappear by the time that, con
gress meets, says the St. Louis Globe-
Democrat. Chairman Elkins of that
committee denies that he is opposed to
the principle of the president's plan.
Ho says he differs with the president
only on details, and the details, of
course, are something which will have
to be arranged in congress. The presi
dent has nothing to do with the mi
nute provisions of the regulation
scheme. In his forthcoming message
he will urge the enactment of a lav/
which will give certain powers in the
regulation of rates to the interstate
commerce commission or to some
other board belonging to the general
government, but congress, if it agrees
with the scheme, will frame the meas
ure.
From present indications a majority
of the republican members of the sen
ate interstate commerce committee
will be on the president's side by the
opening of congress. Cullom of Illi
nois and Doiliver of lowa have been
with the president from the beginning.
Millard of Nebraska, who is counted
as doubtful, is also with the president.
Several times in the past ew months
he has made his attitude ..lain to the
country. There is now a reasonable
chance that Elkins will side with the
administration by the time the bill is
framed which will present the matter
to the senate. Foraker's friends say
there is no irrepressible conflict be
tween him and the president on tit
rate issue, which means that they be
lieve Foraker will be over on the presi
dent's side by the time the subject
com?s up in congress. Kean of New
Jersey, who is a new man in the sets
ate, and who has been placed among
the opponents of the president's poli
cy, is reported to lie swinging over to
the administration. The division
among the republicans of the senate
interstate commerce committee will
not te serious enough to give the dem
ocrats any aid and comfort.
At least three facts will prevent a
split among the senate republicans on
the rate regulation question. The peo
ple of the country, by a large majority,
favor that policy. A rate-regulation
bill will pass the house early in the
session, and will receive the votes of
three-fourths or more of the repub
lican members of that chamber. All
the republican leaders of the popular
branch, from Cannon down, are in fa
vor ol a measure substantially on the
lines which the president urges. If
the republicans of the senate fail to
give rate regulation the support which
it needs to carry it through that body
the democrats will do the work. These
considerations will prevent any serious
break among the republican senators
on that policy. A regulation bill in
come shape is sure to be enacted. The
senators who stand out sgiinst that
policy will have a hard road to travel
if they appeal for reelection. The coun
try is resolved to try the experiment
of placing a supervision over railway
rates in the hands oi some govern
ment board, and the people usually
accomplish what they set out to do. On
the rate regulation question as on ail
other important issues th? republican
line in congress is likely to remain un
broken.

The fact is, that under the Dinglcy

It has given splendid service to-day in

Never have the people of the I'nited

FALSE ISSUES RAISED.
Massachusetts Democrats' Plea for
Canadian Reciprocity a Shal
low Pretense.
Whitney, democratic candidate for
lieutenant governor of Massachusetts,
is a successful millionaire. He has run
greac monopolies and knows all about
that sort of business, but obviously he
has neglected to inform himself on pol
itics and especially on reciprocity.
Whitney gave out. an interview the
other day in which he arrainged the
republican party for its failure to in
stall reciprocity with Canada, the fa
vorite shout of Foss and his ciique,
says the Lewiston (Me.) Journal. Sen
ator Lodge got after Whitney in a
speecn on Saturday and wound up Mr.
Whitney, rhetorically speaking, with a
weaver's knot. Mr. Lodge showed that
under Hlaine. when Harrison was pres
ident, effort was made to install recip
rocity with Canada, and Canada would
listen to no reduction in her duties on
manufactured goods. Whitney says
that ten years ago when the demo
crats were in power, reciprocity was
turned down. Certainly it was not 111-
stallel and this is an inconvenient
fact fo: Whitney. I'nder McKinley,
Congressman Dingley and others sat
on a joint commission of the Uniled
States and Canada to see if a treaty
could be developed, for Congressman
Dingle> and others thought something
could be done on a basis of free coal,
but the Canadians rince that time have
proved as intractable as they did un
der the Harrison administration. In
1903, under Roosevelt, again it was in
evidence that the Canadians would al
low no reduction on their rates on
manufactures entering Canada, anil
there has been 110 time in the last
dec-ale when any reciprocity that was
reciprocal was practicable. Meantime
during the last five years American
trade with Canada has increased from
$100,000,000 to $162,000,000. On the
oth-sr hand, the present Dingley tariff
has worked so well that. about 02 per
cent, of the entire foreign trade of
Canada, which amounts to $400,000,000,
is her trade with the United States. If
we had sought for ideal legislation
coul.l we have secured anything more
favorable to our interests than the
Canadian trade with the United States
which has been promoted by the pres
ent tariff? Another boomerang was
fired by Whitney when he complained
that the present conditions were un
fortunate for Boston. Mr. Lodge shows
that under the present treaty arrange
ments Canadian exports come from
Canada in bond, duty free when de
signed for export beyond this country,
and that the foreign trade of Boston
from this source has so increased that
the Allan line has just decided to run
its Glasgow service to Boston. And
Mr. Lodge adds that if Mr. Whitney
wants to benefit Boston he will do well
to Join the republicans in enacting into
law such measures as will upbuild
American shipping, which for years
has been opposed by the democratic
members of congress.
QUIXOTIC QUEST ONLY.
Free Hide Pilgrimage That Resolved
Itself Into a Ridiculous
Farce.
There is an element of the ludicrous
in the free hides pilgrimage of Novem
ber 15. Certainly a new record for
absurdity was established when that
group of footwear producers left their
business for a round trip of 800 miles
in order to solicit the impossible.
Their errand, says the American
Economist, was to persuade the presi
dent to help them get free trade in
hides. They should have known that
the president had no power in the
premises. Congress, not the president,
fixes tariff rates, ana fixes them for
the whole country—not a single state
or section. Of this fact they were
sharply reminded in the white house.
The president has the matter "under
consideration." He vili not, of course,
make any recommendation regarding
hides in his December message. Presi
dential messages do not. deal with
items in tariff schcd 'les. Still less do
they 1•1 ay favorites in detailed tariff
recommendations.
It if hardly conceivable that the
chief executive should resolve himsell
into a perpetual ta.'iff hearing. If lu
were t< do this, his real executive du
ties wi.uld suffer sauly.
Afte> - consenting to take up the ques
tion of 110 tariff on hides he could not
well kfuse to take op the question of
more tariff on some other article ol
domestic production. If persuaded b>
the icctwear industrials to recommend
free trade in hides, how could he es
cape compliance with the demands ol
the farmers for frc trade in leather
and ils finished products?
Probably the fr*.' hide pilgrim?
never thought of ih.'l. It would seem
that Ihere are many things which tin

FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS CONVENES
The Senate Proceedings Were Brief—
The House Was in Session for
More Than Three Hours.
Washington, Dec. 5. —The assem
bling yesterday of the members of the
Fifty-ninth congress for their first ses
sion was marked by no unusual inci
dents, but it attracted to the capitol
crowds of spectators who took a lively
interest in the proceedings.
Senators Allison and Morgan were
appointed by Vice President Fairbanks
as a committee to notify the president
that congress was ready to receive
any communication he desired to
make. The senate was in session only
20 minutes. Senators Aldrich (Ft. I.),
Knox (Pennsylvania), Warner (Mo.I
and Frazier (Tenn.) took the oath of
office and an adjournment was taken
as a mark of respect to the late Sena,
tor Piatt, of Connecticut.
The preliminary steps to organiza
tion were taken by the house. Joseph
O. Cannon, of Illinois, was re-elected
speaker, the members of the house
took the oath of office; the officers and
tloor employes of the body were re
elected: the rules of the last congress
were adopted, and members went
through the formality of drawing for
seats.
A committee was appointed to act
with the senate committee in notifying
President Roosevelt that congress was
ready to transact business, the rules
committee and the committee on mile
age were appointed and the house ad
journed after a session which lasted
three and a half hours, Ln compliance
with resolutions announcing the death
of Senator Piatt, of Connecticut, and
Representative Marsh, of Illinois.
Washington, Dec. <!. —The senate
was in session for almost three hours
yesterday and gave practically all of
its time to listening to the reading of
the president's message. Mr. Branda
gee took his seat as senator from
Connecticut.
House. —President Roosevelt's mes
sage to congress received the atten
tion of the house for two and a half
hours yesterday.
The house received and ordered re
ferred to one of the regular election
committees a protest from the Fifth
congressional district of Illinois, stat
ing that Anthony Michalek, who was
on Monday sworn in as a member of
the house from that district, is not a
citizen of the United States.
Upon motion of Mr. Goldfogle, of
New York, a resolution was read ex
pressing the sympathy of the American
people for the distressed Russian
Jews.
Washington, Dec. 7. —The senate be
gan business in earnest yesterday. The
session was of only little more than
two hours' duration, but in that time
several hundred bills and resolutions
were introduced and referred to com
mittees.
House. —With an opportunity for
unlimited debate on the subject of the
Panama canal, the house exhausted its
.oratory on that subject in a session of
four and three-quarter hours yester
day.
Washington, Dec. S.—An appropria
tion of $11,000,000 was voted yesterday
toward the construction of the Pana
ma canal.
The bill contains beside the appro
priation a provision removing a lax
disability against the proposed bonds
to be issued for the construction of the
canal, thus placing the bonds 011 a
footing with other government bonds
as available for security for national
bank circulation and to reimburse the
treasury for the money appropriated
in the bill.
Senate. —The subject of campaign
contributions by insurance companies
occupied the major portion of the time
of the senate.
The resolution directing the secre
tary of the treasury to report whether
the reports of the national bank exam
iners show that the banks have made
campaign contributions in recent
years was adopted.
THEY ARE INSOLVENT.
C. H. & D. and Pere Marquette Rail
