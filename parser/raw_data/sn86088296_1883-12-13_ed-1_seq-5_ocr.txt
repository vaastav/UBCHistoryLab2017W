THE STATESMAN.
AUSTIN. TEXAS.
Unmarried marriageable girls big

The shadows of the temporary cap

The Republicans are watching
closely and doing all they can to make
the Democrats drop the tariff reform
issue. They would then take it up,
and in 1884 retain thereby their lease
on the federal government.
Organs have had their day, except
those that are the organs of princi

member that of them in connection
with the late race for the speaker
ship. The Statesman as much, if not
more.
Mr. Carlisle interprets his elec
tion as the triumph of a principle
affecting the interests of the great
majority of the people; and he is sat
isfied that from this time forth the
Democratic party would go to the
people with an aggressive and definite
policy, and adhere to it, because it is
right and deserves to win.
The Galveston News records as the
daily papers in Texas that stood pat
for Carlisle: The Statesman, News,
Waco Examiner. Fort Worth Gazette
and the Dallas Times. We do not
put the Times last as least, because it
did some ot the very best work.

The following tribute to the worth
of our townsman is taken from the
Fort Worth Gazette:
The famous Austin artist, II. II.
Marks, has sent to our branch office in
Washington, admirable pictures of the
leading politician and statesmen and
jurists of Texas, for which the Ga
zette proffers its sincere thanks, By
the way, Marks' pictures of Jefferson
Davis, of Hood, Bragg and other Con
federate leaders have been selected
and preferred by the Euro:! u of Con
federate War Ree .ls at Washington
to all others and will bo utd in mak
ing engraved likenesses of these offi
cers for the publications oi' this bu
reau. There is a prospect that an inter
national bi-metalic monetary associa
tion will be formed at an early date
Its object will be to facilitate trade
by fixing the relative value of silver
and gold throughout the commercial
world, thus encouraging the coinage
and exportation of silver, and to en
deavor to promote uniformity in the
money standards of all nations based
on our decimal system. The names
of Gen. U. S. Gi ant, Hamilton Fish,
Henry Clews ana other prominent
political and business men appear at
the head of the movement. It is like
ly that several years will elapse be
fore any definite result is reached.
The Philadelphia Bulletin does not
catch on to Mr. Blaine's nice little
scheme. It says:
"Mr. Blaine's financial project does
not seem to meet with much favor.
Besides the points we suggested yes
terday, are others that are made in
vaiious directions. It is urged that
if the United States is going to col
lect $100,000,000 of taxes, tor nothing
more than to give them away, it
would be obviously fairer not to col
lect them at all. And it is further
urged that there would bo no reason
In making a whisky-producing state
pay for the support of a whisky-prohibiting
state. The bottom objection
to all these projects lies in the fact
that when the United States govern
ment does not absolutely need rev
enue from internal taxation, as it did
during the rebellion, it should not
have any internal taxes."
During November the receipts from
customs were, in round numbers, 813,
400,000, against 15,100,000 for Novem
ber last year; internal revenue 810,
400,000, as against 12,300,000 for No
vember of last year. The total re
ceipts from all sources- for the month
were 826,300,000, as compared to $30,
200,000 for November of last year.
Thus far this fiscal year the customs
receipts are less by 11,000,000 than
they were for the corresponding five
, months the last fiscal year. The in
ternal revenue receipts are less by
811,000,000. The miscellaneous re
ceipts are about the same, hence the
total falling off has been twenty-two
millions in five months, or at the rate
of fifty-four millions a year. The ex
penditures for the five months have
been nearly seven millions less than
for the same period of last year. The
surplus revenues for the first five
months have been thirty-seven mill
ions, as against fifty-two millions for
the corresponding period of last year,

TnE Mormons have over three
hundred missionaries in the field, and
they are gathering converts from all
parts of the United State3, Europe
and the Pacific Islands. The Utah
immigration agent at New York has
had BOOOlEuropean converts consigned
to him in the last four months. Over
1000 have eone to Utah, for the ex
press purpose of joining the Mor
mons, from the Southern States alone,
in the same length of time, and re
cently over 3000 from the Sandwich
Islands landed at San Francisco. The
Mormons are now bolder and more
aggressive than ever before. Their
delegate to Congress comes with in
creased influence and confidence,
backed by a strong lobby. This is the
condition into which Mormonism has
drifted, until it is now a question to
be considered with the greatest can
tion. By proper administration it
could have long ago been made to hold
in reverence the laws of the United
States. As it Is now, danger lurks, in
more than one respect, in its power.

Think of the industries of Kentucky
and Virginia and of one or two other
states being taxed to contribute an-
nually to New York state 9,000,000.
The plan would give Texas as much
money as it raises by taxation, but
where would the justice be in such
robbery and distribution. Let the
people who use whisky and tobacco
pay the tax, while the necessities of
life, are placed on the free import
list.
The business interests of the United
States demand the discontinuance of
a system of taxation which takes mil
lions of dollars, for which the govern
ment has no use, out of the pockets of
the people to lie idle in the treasury,
ana which takes hundreds of millions
out of their pockets to be transferred
to the coffers of favored monopolists.
ihe small protected classes of the
country as the representatives of the
business interests of the country
while it is properly submitted that
they do not represent the growers of
the cotton and grain which constitute
our whole export produce. They do
not represent the once great com
mercial and shipping interests which
their policy has paralyzed; they do not
represent, in fact, a single interest in
which federal resources, intelligent
labor and acquired skill, together with
freedom from the burdens of military
rule, give U3 an advantage over the
people of other countries. They
simply represent those who, by taxing
all to enrich a few, in certain kinds of
industry, have shut the United States
out of the markets of the world and
made all its business interests depend
more or less upon the fluctuating for
tunes of protected industries, which,
confined to a fixed and insufficient
market, march in the vicious circle of
prosperity, glut, stagnation, panic, re
vival, prosperity, glut, and so on. If
the Democratic party be fit for the
tasks of legislation and government
it is bound to offer the country some
thing better than this product of Re
publican tariff revision.
The New York Herald things a con
stitutiomil amendment, prohibiting
polygamy, is not necessary. This is
the view of The Statesman, since it
is patent the amendment would meet
with contempt among Mormons, while
the result would be, that the evil
would grow instead of being sup
pressed. Unless the Mormon meet
with prompt treatment it will, before
many years, result in a war, costing
the country millions of treasure and
tens of thousands of lives. For near
ly twenty-five years the Republican
party has been quietly viewing the
increasing power of the Mormons
until they have grown mighty in
money and in men, and we may be
permitted to say women. Instead of
enforcing a law already in existence
against polygamy, the government
has made but one abortiye effort to
arrest the evil. The time to meet the
question wa3, therefore, years ago.
To present an amendment to the con
stitution now would be dilly-dallying
still, while means are now at hand to
enforce the law. The jurisdiction
over Utah rests in the federal govern
ment. Let it see that its statutes are
enforced. The military could do good
service in Utah in helping to make
them effective.
The supreme court of Georgia de
cides that though a railroad employe
may waive his right to claim dama
ges not caused by criminal negligence,
the waiver would be improper where
negligence is shown. Employes in
that state are in the habit of signing
what is called a "death-warrant," re
leasing the corporation from liability
in case of accident. The wives of em
ployes also sign a pledge aot to sue in
case their husbands are injured. A
brakeman was killed, and his wife
though she had signed an agreement,
brought suit and recovered 3600 by
a jury verdict. On appeal the highest
court affirmed the judgment.
The Kansas City Times declares
that one of the first duties of Con

ence to the leasing from the Indians
of large areas by individuals or syndi
cates, the organization of princely

The president wants the govern
ment to buy up the trade dollar at a

give the speculators who have been

lar, as bullion, is worth more than the
standard dollar as coin. Hence a pre
mium in standard dollars might be
paid on trade dollars. There are now
about 10,000,000 in the hands of
speculators in this country, and their
agents will soon collect the balance in

A FREE BRIDGE.
A correspondent strikes the proper
key when he calls attention to the
fact that there should be a free bridge
across the Colorado river at Austin
Other places of less pretention have
their free bridges, and wisely so, be
cause they tell wonderfully on the
business of a city. Often has The
Statesman advised a public invest
ment of this sort, and it is gratifying
to knowthat its views have endorsers;
and we do know, that, were
a free bridge once estab
lished, there would be no
end of congratulation at the fact. It
would benefit everybody in this sec
tion, not only those in the city and
those on the west side of the river,
but those on the east side as well. It
would enhance the value of property
in the city, because it would cause
more people to settle here, and it
would therefore add to the value of
everything produced in Travis county.
The demand for city real estate would
be increased, more people would live
within its limits, and every article of
production in the rural districts would
command better prices. Austin is
growing with great rapidity; Travis
county is developmg its resources in
a manner paralleled by no other coun
ty in the state, and nothing should be
neglected that will advance city and
county on the high road to fortune.
Can any one doubt the effect a free
bridge across the Colorado river would
have upon the growth, the popu
lation and the consequent inciease
of property values in Travi3 county.
Strangers come here, looking for
homes in the city and country;
they have money to invest in
waste places and to add to the
taxable values of property in
Travis county. They take in the
whole situation, and the fact
that an embargo is placed upon
the community's trade by a toll
bridge across the river often drive
strangers to some les3 crippled
community. The existence of a
toll bridge takes away from Aus
tin, it is computed, 10 per cent
of what ought to be its trade.
This 10 per cent would make an
enormous sum in twelve months and
it shows a waste of profit to Austin
merchants of enough to pay for a
free bridge in a very short
time. But the merchants of Austin
are not the only people to be benefi
cially affected by the establishment of
a free bridge. The increased trade, as
we have stated, would produce in
creased demand, and increasing de
mand would be felt at all local iol-..-of
supply in the immediate vicinity
Besides, the people on the west side of
the river are unjustly discriminated
against. They are forced to pay a
tax from which others of the county
are exempted, and one of the
very first principles of a properly
organized and just society is that
taxation shall be equalized. The
people on the east side of
river have enjoyed Immunity from
this bridge tax for many years,
and it would be but proper that all
should join together and put an end to
a thing that is absolutely damaging
to the entire community. The right
of the county to build a free bridge is
clear, and our county court could take
up no subject, and pursue it to a suc
cessful conclusion, that would give
more general satisfaction than this
one of establishing a free bridge.
MONOPOLY SCHEMES.
The Republican bosses manage to
keep up quite a fuss about what shall
be done with the surplus revenue
They are eager to keep the protection
still In tact, and to do this they would
make the outflow of money out the
back door of the treasury as great as
the inflow is at the front door. Mr.
Wharton Baker some time ago started
the proposition in the interest of pro
tection as it is,- to give the states the
surplus revenue as an annual aid to
education. The plan has had its
many advocates among the Republi
cans, but now comes Mr. Blaine and
hits it an awful lick in t' e eye.
He presents three fatal objections to
the Baker scheme:
First. The utter uncertainty of the
size of the redundant revenue. It
may be 81,000,000 or 8100,000,000, and
unless steady no state tax couia do
remitted on account of tne receipt ot
this aid, while sporadic federal contri
butions to the states would oe wasted,
as was the last distribution of the
federal surplus.
Second. The division of this surplus
would impose on Senators and Repre
sentatives a divided duty. For the
sake of their states they would wish
the surplus to be as large as possible,
which would present a constant temp
tation to withhold appropriations
from objects of a really national char
acter. Third. The assumption of a contin
uing redundancy of national revenue
is opposed to all sound views of ad
ministration. Decause it is sure to
vield to extravagance, corruption and
all manner of schemes for getting rid
of money.
It is evident that Mr. Blaine simply
uses this subject to Dnng nimseir
prominently before the people. He is
anxious to be president and he must
be heard frequently, if not oftener;
he knows the Baker scheme has not a
ghost of a chance of adoption, and his
plan is certainly no improvement on
It Mr. Blaine's plan is nothing more
than another shrewd scheme to make
revision of the tariff impossible.
He wants the whisky tax distri-
buted among the states in proportion
to their population. He wants this
indirect tax, which is not regarded as
oppressive in any sense, used to re
lieve property owners of the burden
of direct taxation. The amount re
received from the whisky tax varies
very little from year to year, and
states would know about how much
this tax would give them, and how
much they would have to raise bv in
direct taxes. In the first place there
is no warrant for it in the constitu
tion, and in the second place all the
whisky tax comes from Kentucky, Ill
inois and a few other states, and they
would certainly object to having their
industries taxed to help pay the taxes
of other states. The constitution is
very explicit about the equality and
uniformity of taxation. There is no
good reason why whisky should go
free, and consumers in fact do not ask
that it be free. The Republicans urge
that both whisky and tobacco be made
free in order to save the tariff. There
is no more reason why hats, shoes,
salt, cotton and woolen goods of all
kinds, and a dozen other things which
the farmer uses and which are neces
saries, should be taxed in order that
whisky may be free, than there is that
farms, homesteads and shops should
be taxed so as to relieve whisky of
tax. The protectionists may as well
accept the situation now as later.
The country will not submit to the
plans of either !?'-. Baker or Mr.
Blaine. They are those of the mo
nopolists. Tariff is going to be cut
down to a basis that will sustain the
government, to one that will not en
rich the few to the distress of the
many.

a few peacable negroes turned the
head of Cox and put the army of Tex

Tns New York Times, having
made a thorough investigation of the
riot preceding the late election in Dan
ville, Virginia, declares that "the facts
show that the collision between the
whites and the blacks in Danville was
not a premeditated affair, deliberately
planned by the Democrats of that
place for the purpose of preventing
negroes from casting their votes for
the Readiuster nominees. They show
that the colored voters of Danville
were not driven from the polls by the
murderous assaults of organized
band?. They show that the Demo
crats of Danville did not deliberately
adopt coercion, by which the colored
vote was suppressed," The testimony
of the Times is valuable in showing
that the riot, while a crime, was not a
political crime. It was no worse than
the Murraysville shooting in Pennsyl
vania, growing out of a quarrel for
the possession of an oil well.
Ben. Butler does not think much
of Mr. Blaine's revenue scheme. The
ex-governor says:
Mr. Blaine proposed to collect a
large amount of direct taxes from a
few states and distribute the money
among all the people of all the states
per capita. 1 hope, before this is at
tempted, somebody will show the con
stitutional warrant for so doing. That
is to say, to give you an illustration:
Some millions are to be collected from
Virginia tobacco in order to pay the
taxes of Minnesota; other milliuns to
be collected off the corn which is used
to make whisky in Kentucky to pay
the taxes of the state of Massachusetts.
Now, according to the published ta
ble of Mr. Blaine, we should be very
grateful in Massachusetts if the corn
and tobacco producing states would
contribute to us the 83,120,000 which
is proposed, being more than double
our present state taxes. But what
should we say if the proposition was
.... 1 .. . ua(1 y -y-hat Would Massa-

point (that is to say, as much as they
will bear witnout DreaKinjz aown tne
collection by smuggling) for the bene
fit of Virginia or Oonnecticutjeaving
Massachusetts no industry to tax for
the support of her own institutions ?
Of courso the attacks made upon
Mr. Blaine's scheme will require of
him a vigorous defense. This is what
he wanted lo be required to do. He
wants to Le in especial notice, hoping
the monopolists will rally to his sup
port and secure him the presidential
nomination. Butler presents a plan
of his own, as follows:
I would abolish the tax on whisky
and tobacco by the United States
when it is no longer necessary, to
help the middle interests, for the same
reason that tax on matches was taken
off for the benefit of the poorer inter
ests, and the tax on bank checks taken
on: tor tne capital class. 1 would tnen
leave the states that have borne the
burden so many years more heavily
than any other states to tax these
commodities to collect their own tax
on whisky and tobacco in their own
way. and thus recuperate from the
disastrous effects of the war.
And now Blaine, in defending his
own plan, may ridicule Butler's, and
both these vain men may get that
amount of notoriety they both so

All About the Bridge.
Austin, Dec. 1, 1883.
Editor Statesman:
I came from the North not long
since, and have been spending some
time in visiting different points in
Texas. I am pleased very much with
your city. Thi3 winter weather, or
rather spring weather in winter time,
is simply delightful. Wherever I may
be I shall never forget the glorious
sunshine, green trees, sweet roses and
blue skies which greet me in Austin
on this most delightful morning in
December.
Nature has srlven you every beauty,
and affords you the chance for every
lnxury. In this dry, delicious air, I
feel my spirits revive. I find your
city flourishing, too, in spite of some
powerful drawbacks to its prosperity.
If vou will not consider it out of place
in me, I would like to mention one of
them, viz.: Lack of a free bridge
across the Colorado. What a beauti
ful location South Austin is for
residences! As the city proper
builds up with business houses
and manufactories, merchants, manu
f acturers, etc., will per force wish to
choose homes on the south side of the
river, as such will be quite healthy
and convenient to business. But the
great draw back is the enormous tolls
and the trouble of paying them. It
is certainlv an outraffe that the capi
tal of Texas, the seat of her asylums
and universitv. should force the resi
dents of one half of the county to
swim, f errv or pav toll for the privi
lege of visiting the city and spend
ing their money here. The business
men, whose pockets are filled by the
trade of that part of the county should
certainly use every endeavor to see
that such a tax is lifted from its Citi
zens.
At Sesmin. I found a tine bnage
acrnss the Guadaluoe river. At Colo
rado Citv. a town only lour years oid
and having a population of only eight
hundred souls, is a free bridge across
the Colorado river; while San Anto
nio has eight free bridges across the
San Antonio river. Can not the
proud and wealthy city ot Austin
afford one ?
I have talked with the managers of
vour bank and other prominent gen
tlemen on the subject. They have in
vestigated the matter and say tnat a
durable bridsre can be built with the
small sum of from 850,000 to 8100,000;
that the constitution authorizes the
levying of a tax of 15 cents on every
8100 for road and bridge purposes.
This tax should be levied
and 10 per cent of it set aside
for building a substantial bridge
over the Colorado river at Austin.
assure vou that strangers, one and
all. are surprised at the negligence of
your citizens in not preparing a free
road between the two portions of
your beautiful city. For my own
part, I feel assured that Austin will
never attain t o the degree of prosper
ity which she deserves, until the er
ror is remedied; and the sooner your
people set about it, tne better it wiu
be tor ner.
Fannie B. Ward writes from Sal-
tillo that at whatever hour a person
dies in Mexico, it is customary to ap
point the funeral just twenty-four
hours later, and that as the mortality
ia jrreatest over all the world at night,
the most of the funeral ceremonies in
Mexico are performed at night, no
women being permitted to attend,

Caught a Tartar.
During the trial of the case of Mrs
Brin vs. The Houston & Texas Cen
tral railroad it came out that Judge
Goldthwaite had taken the deposition
of the plaintiff, and instead of return
ing it to court he took it from the no
tary and kept it himself. Mr. Walton
desired to show this fact, thinking the
saarp practice on tne part ot the rail
road attorney would prejudice the
jury against the delendant and there
by help his case. He therefore
called the judge himself to the
stand and made him the wit
ness by which he expected to show
the sharp practice. The iiudare is a
singular kind of man any way; he
talks well with his tongue.but he does
a deal more with his nose, mouth and
eyes. Whenever he wants to give a
certain meaning to a word he twirls
his eccentric nose into a picture of
startling significance and draws down
the corners of his eyes to correspond
to the twirl of his wonderful nose and
then brings in a mouth fearfully
and wonderfully made upset
in strange curves and ex
pressive grimaces which, added to
the other physiognomy, give his words
a meaning that words from any other
man never had. When he arose to be
sworn he looked at the judge, the
jury, and then at Major Walton, with
a face like a stage in a theatre set for
the occasion. He was a picture of ex
travagant surprise, at the audacity of
the counsel; of withering con
tempt for the purpose he
had in view; and withal a
sort of non-plussed wonder
ment at the novelty of the situation.
He took the stand, and the major
asked him:
"lou took the deposition of Mrs.
Briny" Down came the corners of
the strange eyes; away went the won
derful nose; into ridiculous curves
flew the peculiar mouth, and he said:
"certainly r
That was all: but the one word
struck Major Walton in the pit of the
stomach and completely took away
his breath. It was the stage scenery
of the face, and not the word that
struck the counsel so hard, and
brought a laugh to the faces and jiDs
of the jury. The Major rallied and
asKea:
Then you took that deposition
home and never sent it to court, but
have kept it in your office ever since?"
There was another setting of fa
cial scenery and he replied:
"Certainly." and the mry smiled
again.
"Why did you take that deposition
home and keep it instead of sending it
to court?" asked the major with
haughty dignity. The wonderful face
came down to a picture of astonished
incredulity as he aaswered:
"I had drawn the enemv's fire
(here came a wonderful face
and having done so (another facial
change) I thought it highly to the in
terest of my client to Keep that de
position from the inspection of the
attorneys for the plaintiff that was
the object, sir !" and the wonderful
physognomy that followed the last
word was too much for even the
rave and dignified Judge Walker
e only smiled; the rest laughed.
"But were the depositions not the
records of the court and the clerk the
custodian not the defendant's attor
ney?" asked the Major. Such a face
as followed tnat question was
never set to show off the
meaning of words in the Travis
court house before as he answered:
"Oh, no; they were my private pa
pers, until they were filed with the
clerk, and unless filed with the clerk,
he had no right to them. The notary
was the proper custodian until I got
them, then 1 was their proper cus
todian and have been ever since. I
still ami I did not take them for the
purpose you seem to imagine you
seem to be laboring under the delu
sion they were taken to be used as ev
idence but that is a mistake. I was
simply taking a peep at the en
emy's hand that was alL Playing
little 'Old Curiosity Shop'
all by myself in your game of euchre.
Why, I had to pay 824 for these affi
davits, and, to be honest, major, I
thought if you wanted tne deposition
of your client for evidence in the case
would let your client pay the S24
to get one, and I'd keep mine tor office
use and not me it in tne case at all."
The expression of the judge's home
ly face as he closed this little sally set
the court room in a perfect uproar,
and it was some time before Major
Walton got his breath. When he
did he asked: "Didn't one of
the plaintiffs " attorneys ask ycu
about the depositions and request
them to be returned Into court ?"
After the judge had got his face into
shape he answered, "I met Mr. Hill
and he wanted to know what had be
come of the depositions ? I told him I
had 'em and I guessed I'd keep 'em."
(Laughter.)
" uidn t ne request you to return
them to the court ?"
'Yes he said he wanted to see
them."
"What reply did you make?"
"I told him they had cost me twen
ty-four dollars (laughter) to get 'em,
and they were most too valuable to
make him a present of 'em and if he
wanted some he d better get em nim-
self. "Here the judge was dismissed in
roar of laughter, judge vvaJker
being the only person in the court
who could keep his face straight.
Ostrich Farming in this Country.
Scientific American.!
The ostrich farm in California is
reached over a sandy road leading
from Anaheim, part of the way being
over the old bed of the Santa Ana
river. The land on which the farm is
located comprises 640 acres of alkali
soil. The same kind of soil is found
in Africa, and it was considered no
obstacle. To rid it of its alkaline
properties, it was plowed very deep
and water turned on It, a well 300 feet
deep yielding many thousands of gal
lons of water a day. xne water was
allowed to remain for a wniie, wnen
it was drawn off, taking with it a por
tion of the alkali in solution, xnis
operation was continued until the
land had been washed sufficiently to
be put under cultivation. According
to the San Francisco Bulletin, this
farm has yielded three crops of alfal
fa, and a fourth is ready to be cut.
The twenty-one birds on tne iarm
were brought, in a roundabout way.
some 22,000 miles, part of the distance
by car. wnen young tney are Kin a
and tractable, but after three years
become vicious and deceitful. Blind
folding them generally accomplished
by pulling a stocking over their heads
takes away tneir pugnacity, ana
they will not kick, except they know
what they are kicking at. xne eggs
are not fruitful because, tne owner
states, the birds are becoming accli
matized. Even if all attempts to
hatch the eggs should prove unsuc
cessful, the value of the feathers will
cover the expense of tending the
birds for the year.
The attempt to raise ostriches in
Florida has just been commenced,
three pairs of birds having been taken
there.
Ostrich eggs are about six inches
long by five wide, and are equal in
bulk to twenty-four hens' eggs. The
chick is hatched in forty-two days.
and a few days after reaches the size
of a common hen. A light brown
down covers it, and at the back and
wings are protecting needles, similar
to those of a hedgehog. At the age of
one month the size or a turKey is
reached, and small feathers begin to
appear. At one-half a year the feath
ers have attained a good size, but are
not cast off until the bird becomes a
yearling; young ostriches are kept in
flocks of from twelve to fifteen, and
separate from the old ones. Generally
the feathers are cut off once a year,
but birds which receive special atten
tion yield two or even three crops of
feathers.
The best feathers now come from
North Africa, bnt the crop is insignifi
cant compared with that of Cape Col
ony. Natal and the TransvaaL Since
1862 ostricb farming has greatly mul
tiplied in those countries, and it is
now estimated that there are 100,000
domestic ostriches, which yield feath
ers worth 84,500,000.

THE TERRELL ASYLUM.
There wa3 a meeting of the asvlum
board yesterday to consider some dif
ferences between Building Supervisor
McLaurin and Contractor McDonald
as to how payments for the work
should be made. The board decided
! :'t the contractor should be paid for
an acceptable materbd as furnished,
receiving as a present margin 15 per
cent besides what it will cost to use
tho material in the construction of the
building.
BOARD OF EDUCATION.
The board, as required by law. ha3
presented its report to the governor,
showing the condition of the free
schools of the slate for the year 1882-3.
Accompanying tne report is submit
ted tor the consideration of the legis-
lature an able communication from
Hon. B. M. Baker, secretary of the
board. While some of the members
dissent from some of the recommen
dations therein, it is deemed proper,
they say. to publish the same, as com
ing from one who has given the sub
jects treated much care and thought.
we give some points oi tne report.
The reports are not complete, being
received from only 125 counties and
cities. Public funds were apportioned
to 175 counties including the unorgan
ized counties of Crosby. Dickens. Ed
wards, Fisher. Hardeman, King, Knox,
Wichita and Zavalla and to fortv-live
cities and towns.
Errors in the present school laws
and in the system itself have oc
casioned much difficulty in the ad
ministration of the public schools.
Changes are considered necessary to
conform the law to the amended con
stitution. 1. County judges have not in every
instance distributed all the available
state and county funds at their dis
posal. 2. Many communities organize an
nually and have the fund to which
they are entitled set aside for them in
the county treasuries, and tnen tail to
maintain schools, thereby locking up
in the county treasuries many thous
ands of dollars, from which no practi
cable benefit is derived by any one.
a. xeacners, a3 a rule, cannot be in
duced to make term reports to the
county judges, and of course complete
statistics cannot be sent by the county
judges to this department.
4. County judges, mayors, superin-
tendendents of city schools, county
and city treasurers, in many instances,
fail or refuse to report to this depart
ment at all.
5. The scholastic census is often
badly taken. In many instances chil
dren of scholastic age are overlooked
and children not of scholastic age are
enrolled.
6. The community lists have often
been improperly revised. Some coun
ty judges have revised them by the
assessors' rolls, while some have not
revised them at all. The result has
been that children of scholastic age,
overlooked by the assessors, have not
received the benefit of the school fund,
and children not of scholastic age by
being put on the community lists,
have enjoyed a fund never intended
for them.
7. The amount of pay to which an
assistant teacher is entitled is a matter
of infinite doubt
The report favors the subdivision
of counties into convenient "schcol
districts ;" the qualified property tax
paying voters of such districts be per
mitted to vote such local taxes as they
may deem best, not to exceed the limit
fixed by amendment to the constitu
tion. Each district to elect three
school trustees, to locate schools, de
termine when to open them, employ
teachers and manage the schools gen
erally, subject to rulings from this de
partment on questions referred to it
on appeal. Teachers bhould have pro
per certificates of competency, accor
ding to grades of the schools. A
course of study should be prescribed
for the schools of the several grades.
County treasurers should be continued
as treasurers of the school fund.
District school superintendents are
suggested, instead of requiring the
services of county judges, the fees
paid the judges and assessors being
saved towards the salaries of the su
perintendents. Supervision, Mr.
Baker regards as the greatest need of
our schools, and the plan which he
sus'srests more in detail than is here
given, is what he considers the best
to secure this
I would respectfully recommend
that a "superintendent of public in
struction" or "commissioner of educa
tion" be provided for. If it is deemed
best not to provide for the election of
such officer, it would be vastly better
that the present board of education be
directed hv law to appoint one. He
should supervise, manage, direct and
control the public schools of the state,
and might do so under the supervision
nf t.hft hoard of education. The gov
ernor, comptroller and secretary of
state cannot give the necessary time
from their own offices to manage the
srrowinir school interests of lexas,
Constant, careful and onerous labor
is required for that purpose
in this department The secre
tary of the board of education is
virt.nallv the superintendent, but he
is without the necessary power and
cannot exercise the necessary muu
enca to make the manaeement effi
cient. The name itself adds dignity
to the department, and he who over
looks the expenditure of a million
and a half dollars of the public
monev should be in law. as he is in
fact, tho head of the department. The
superintendent or commissioner
should be ex-oflicio secretary of the
board of education. The board must,
.under the constitution, continue to
annuany apportion ioine scuuoi muu,
but the management of the schools
could under the constitution be con
fided to a superintendent or commis
sioner and would, in my judgement, be
more satisfactory under such an of-
The city schools, it is suggested,
might properly be left under the pres
ent management except that some
provision should bo made to compel
reports from them to this department
under some prescribed penalty for
failure. Teachers' institutes are re
commended to discuss and asrree upon
uniform text books. Mr. Baker re
grets that so many teachera fail to
attend the the teachers institutes pro
vided by the state. The Sam Hous
ton Normal institute is alluded to as
a valuable alley to the common schools
It had been difficult to obtain matri
culates for the institution ready for
trainmsfor instructors. The report
is interestinar m the details as well as
in the general discussion of the sub
jects which it treats.
. LAND DEPARTMENT.
In consequence of the recent decis
ion of the supreme court that the
statute prohibitinar surveyors and
land official clerks from purchasing
lands of the public domain of th
state also prohibitd tho purchase of
public school lands by them, the three
clerks m the land oilice who had pur
chased several sections, have been ad
vised by Commissioner Walsh to yield
their claims witnout incurring the
suits for the lands which the land

general to bring against them. As
their purchases were in good faith the

cannot purchase additional in the
name of his wife.

THE OLl QE3EBAJLS.
Reminiscences of a West Pointer.
Washington Correspondence Boston Adverti
ser, j
Twenty years aaro the North kept in
mind the leading generals on the rebel
side, and discussed their merits witn
as much interest as was shown in the
leaders of its own armies. Many of
them had been prominent in the regu
lar army before the war. Some were
connected with Northern families.
"What has become of these men i" I
asked an old West Pointer and brill
iant general officer the other day. He
thought a minute. "Why, the major
ity ot them are dead," was tne repiy.
Then he went on to take up some of
those historic names. With many of
their owners he had Berved in Mexico
and in Indian wars without number,
"Yes. the greater part of these men
are dead; a much larger proportion
than of our Northern geneTals.
After the war most of them broke
down. The fact was, the rebels suf
fered more than we did. They had a
harder time in the field, lived poorly
and were more disposed to disease
than our men. Lee, Anderson, Bragg,
Magruder,Breckenridge,Hood,Picket,
Forrest. Price, Pemberton, Dick Tay
lor, Pillow, Floyd, Hardee and Eweil
were among them, xne majority nad
been in the regular army. They went
with the south tor state pride ana in
part because they were frozen out. I
shall not forget Anderson. He was a
captain in the dragoons out in Utah.
When his resignation was accepted,
and he went away from the rest of us.
the tears were in his eyes. 'I am go
ing back to South Carolina to raise
hogs and hominy until the war is
over.' he said, 'l win never ugnt toe
old flag.' But in a month the tide was
too strong for him. They made him
military governor of Charleston and
a corps commander in Lee's army. He
died of a broken heart right after the
war. Lee never waited to resign, but.
like Johnston, he was made to feel
that the northern officers distrusted
him. It was so withJohnston. In '61 he
was Quartermaster General, but old
Simon Cameron transacted all bis
business with subordinate officers. At
last Johnston went to him. Mr. bec
retary,' he said, 'you pay no attention
to me.' 'No,' was the reply, 'yott arc
a Virginian, and sympathize with the
rebels.' 'I do not,' answered Johnson,
'but I shall resign, rather than be ig
nored. It is not because I have any
desire to join the south.' Yet in three
months he had drifted into a General's
commission in Dixie. Johnston Is an
old man now, not less than seventy
five. Bragg died several years ago.
at his home in North Carolina. 1
knew him in the Mexican war. He.
was captain of artillery then, and on
of the bravest men in the army. But
he was a martinet, and his men hated
him. At Monterey some of them hid
a lighted six-inch shell under his bed.
The explosion blew Bragg one hun
dred feet and wrecked the tent, but
but he was not hurt. And yet they
had a sort of pride in him. During
the whole war his old battery carried
Braggs artillery' on its guidons.
Some of the volunteers were mad
about it, but in vain. Margruder
died ten years ago. Forrest, the mur
derer of negro prisoners at Fort Pil
low, lived only a little while after the
surrender. So it was with E well, Lee's
bravest lieutenant, who rode strapped
to his saddle in every campaign after
the first Bull Run. where he lost a
leg. He was breveted for bravery at
Cherubusco. xnere was iiaraee. xie
