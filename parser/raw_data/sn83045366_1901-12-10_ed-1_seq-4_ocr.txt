President and Monroe Doctrine
If President Roosevelt really means so
to apply the Monroe doctrine that it shall
operate to prevent the aggrandizement of
any American republio at the expense of
its neighbors, he has cut out a large piece j
of work for this nation. If the new idea
Is carried to the point of actual opposi
tion by the United States to the territorial
aggrandizement of the Central and
South American republics, we shall not
be without -wars for any great length of
time at a stretch. We might just as well,
then, get ready for a war with Chile in
the near future, for that proud and ag
gressive little state proposes to expand by
force of arms, and has no idea of confining
itsel to the narrow western slope of the
Andes.
But quite a different construction can bo
put on the president's words when he
»ays: "Still less is it (the Monroe doc
trine) intended to give cover to any ag
gression by the new world power at the
expense of any other." Is it not more i
than likely that this is a delicate way of j
assuring the Latin-American republics!
that they are in no danger of losing ter
ritory through the expansion of the United
States. There has been a call for just
such a declaration. Mr. Loomis, former i
American minister to Venezuela, has pro
duced a very bad impression throughout j
South America by his advocacy of the con- I
trol of the whole littoral of the Carribean
sea by the United States. The action of
the United States in virtually taking
charge of the Isthmian railway during the
recent fighting between Colon and Pana
ma has also aroused the fears of the
Latin-Americans. Moreover, ever since i
the successful conclusion of the war with
Spain and the cession by Spain of the
JSpanish East and West Indies to the
United States, the Spanish-American na
tions have feared, hated and suspected us.
(Many ridiculous stories have been cir
culated throughout South America pur
porting to outline the designs of the
United States on its neighbors. We are
told that at tho Pan-American congress
the United States delegates have, in large
measure, been left to flock by themselves,
and Mr. Barrett thought it necessary to
make a speech denying that the United
States had any intention of encroaching
upon the other American republics.
Considering these things, is it not rea
sonable to suppose that the president
meant that the nation -which enunciated
and has upheld the Monroe doctrine has
no intention of using that doctrine as a
cloak for aggression against the smaller
end weaker republics? At any rate, the
"United States is included in the inter
pretation that no American republic is to
tie permitted to use the Monroe doctrine
as a cloak for aggression. Our southern
neighbors, .then, cam now assure them
selves, on presidential authority, that the
United States, while filling the role of de
fender of the Monroe doctrine, has no de
signs upon them. That will please them
even if they must take with it the added
meaning that the United States will oppose
territorial aggrandizement of any Ameri
can power at the expense of another
•American nation.
Must we lose the dollar of the daddies?
It looks like it. Here is the director of
the mint telling us that it ought to be
abolished. Probably he is right. But
somehow it seems as if we could hardly
spare those good, old, cart wheels. Used
■very little in the east, the silver dollar is
very common in the west and there is a
Bort of sentimental attachment to it.
Somehow a man feels richer fingering a
pocketful of jingling dollars than
■fumbling a little "wad of green paper.
Will the Opportunity Be Of
fered?
Under the caption "Republican Stupid
ity Is Democracy's Opportunity," the
Brooklyn Eagle discusses the reluctance
of the republican party to approach the
reciprocity question in any direct and
positive manner, and urges democrats to
Beize the issue as a means of rehabilitat
ing themselves.
The Eagle says that the republicans
have usurped the place of the democrats
as advocates of territorial expansion, but
that now by their short-sightedness the
former are likely to make an opening for
the latter to succeed the republicans as
the friends of trade expansion.
We have strong hopes that, before it is
altogether too late, the republican lead
ers will recede from their present posi
tion of rather contemptuous indifference
to reciprocity and will add more laurels
to the great progressive and construc
tive record of the party by using it to
maintain the progress of the nation in
the new economic conditions, with respect
to our foreign relations, that have been
brought about by the amazingly rapid in
crease In the productive capacity of the
country.
New times demand new measures. If
the republicans do not bring forward the
required measures another party will.
Revision of our tariffs through reciprocity,
whether in the form of treaties or legis
lation, is to be the external economic
policy of this country to flt the new con
ditions. The fate of the republican party
depends upon its attitude towards that
policy. If It Is wedded to the high pro
tective tariff policy, eminently suited to
the era when the home market was the
field our manufacturers were striving to
control; if it thinks only of the past and
the immediate present, It will certainly
be creating an opportunity for its politi
cal opponents. *
The mayor Intimates that it is very
diflicult to catch the "big mit" men. It
doesn't seem to be very diflicult for the
unsophisticated stranger to get into a
"big mlt" game on Washington avenue al
most any day. How would- It do for the
mayor to employ two or three clever de
tectives ■who inig'ut play the part of
"innocents abroad" and catch some of
these "big mit" men? That Is, if the
"doctor" -Is really In earnest.
The New Ship Subsidy Bill
The discussion of the ship subsidy bill
and the determined opposition In the west
to the original bill, which conferred such
special favors upon two or three steam
ship lines, seems not to have been with
out its effect upon the advocates of ship
subsidy. Senator Frye's new bill, intro
duced yesterday, is different in several
particulars from that which met defeat at
the last session. It provides for mail
subsidies, to which no one will take ex
ception, if they are properly awarded, but
It still measures the bounties to be paid
too closely by the rate of speed of the
ship subsidized, and omits specific and
definite provisions with regard to the
amount of cargo carried. It adds a per
centage for American-built ships for the
purpose of encouraging shipbuilding in
America, and does not provide for the
American register of foreign-built ships
owned by Americans. It also requires
at least one-fourth of the crew of the
subsidized ships to be Americans.
Congresman Stevens, who has given this
matter more attention than any other
northwestern member by reason of his
committee asignments, calls attention to
the failure to meet western demands as
to the amount cargo carried, and while
he recognizes the bill as an improvement
on tho old, he thinks it will require some
further modification before it can be ac
cepted even by those western members
who approve ship subsidy.
A peculiar thing about the bill is that
rates for mail steamers to the West In
dies, Central America and Mexico cannot
exceed 70 per cent of the maximum rates.
This is the statement of the Associated
Press synopsis, which we understand to
mean that steamers engaged in the South
and Central American trade are not to re
ceive more than 70 per cent of the maxi
mum bounties conferred by this bill.
There is probably some reason for this,
but it is not apparent why vessels en
gaged in that particular trade, which we
are supposed to be most anxious to de
velop, should not receive as much en
couragement as those engaged in trade
with more remote regions. It has long
been understood that one of the principal
difficulties in the way of the growth of our
trade with South America and Central
America was the lack of direct mail and
transportation facilities, yet the Frye
subsidy bill provides, for some reason,
that the bounties paid to ships in this
trade should not be as large as the sub
sidies granted to ships engaged in trade
with other ;>arts of the world.
Mr. Stevens points out a serious defect
in the new bill, one which will doubt
less have to be remedied, and that is its
failure to provide against subsidies to
trusts in ownership or management and
to trusts engaged in the building of ships.
With the tendency in all industries toward
consolidation and combination it would
be a serious mistake for the United
States—if it is to pay ship subsidies at
all—to obligate itself to pay bounties to
encourage American shipbuilding and the
American ship-carrying trade without pro
viding that these bounties should not be
awarded in the event of a trust monopo
lizing the ship-building industry of Amer
ica.
Of the $14,120,963.33 in the savings banks
of Minnesota, $11,599,482.42 is in those of
Minneapolis. The great aid these institu
tions have been to the small savers of
this city should be of some value as an
example to other ports of the state. There
ought to be a number of such banks scat
tered throughout the state. They perform
a function that the ordinary state or na
tional bank does not perform. A savings
bank as a means of discipline in economy
is of the greatest value to the community.
A "Good Thing"
Andrew Carnegie seems to have sim
plified the task of those who have been
j laboring for the establishment of a na
| tional university at Washington. It is re
j ported that he has offered to endow such
j a university with $10,000,000, and that he
I so anxious to make this a potent means of
j promoting his intense desire to escape the
| odium of dying rich, that he merely asks
the government to act as trustee. He will
buy the site and erect the buildings. It
will not cost the government a cent. The
relation of the government to the institu
tion would be much the same as that it
bears to the Smithsonian institute, which
was created by the gift of a million dollars
by the Englishman, Smithson.
It seems to have been pretty generally
agreed that the kind of a national uni
versity contemplated would be a great
benefit to education and would not inter
fere with the prosperity or continued de
velopment of existing universities. The
proposed university is intended chiefly as
a means of utilizing the great stores of
the raw material of scientific and scholar
ly research available in the various gov
ernment departments and institutions and
is to be altogether for post graduate work.
Mr. Carnegie's offer looks like- a "good
thing," ami no reason occurs to us in
favor of rejecting it.
The theory that the wide-open policy
helps business was seriously jarred yes
terday by the statements of business men
on Washington avenue, to The Jour
nal, with regard to the effect of our
present "wide-open" policy upon their
trade. Washington avenue is the favorite
field of operations of the "big mit" crowd
and other varieties of confidence men,
gamblers, thieves, and crooks generally,
who find the leniency of this administra
tion a great help to the prosecuti<//j of this
THE MINNEAPOLIS JOUENAL.
business. If wide-openess and laxity in
the enforcement of law against crime Is a
good thing for business, Washington ave
nue ought to be the tradesman's paradise.
Rents ought to go up on that street and
the stores should be crowded with cus
tomers.
But the merchants on that avenue tell
a very different story. They have got
enough of wide-openeos to satisfy them
that it is positively damaging to business
and means a direct loss to them every
day. With the testimony of these busi
ness men before the court, the plea of the
Ames element in politics that wide-open
ness helps business will have to be aban
doned. The evidence is all against it.
Senatorial Wranglers
Yesterday, In the senate, Senator Till
man of South Carolina renewed his chal
lenge to Senator MtaLaurln of the same
state to resign concurrently with him,
that they "might be able to wash their
dirty linen at home." It Is unusual for
Senator Tillman to seek the privacy o-f his
own state to wash any dirty linen of
which Tie may be seized and possessed, but
he feels that, on the floor of the senate,
he is under more restraint in delivering
his rhetoric of vulgarity and blackguard-
Ism than he would be in South Carolina.
Some months ago MtjLaurln ami Tillman,
as the result of a quarrel, tendered their
resignations to the governor, proposing
that both go ibefore the people of the state
and let the public decide between them,
■but the governor refused to accept the
resignations. The two have not since en
tertained a sentiment for one another
resembling that which controlled the lives
of Jonathan and David. l Tillman would
dearly love to see McLaurin out of poli
tics in South Carolina and lias already
read him out of the democratic party.
The case Is interesting outside that state,
'because of the views which these men in
dividually represent.
Senator (MclLaurin Is the leader in. his
state of the progressive democracy, so
termed because they have recognized the
fact that the south is directly interested
in the broadest and deepest utilization of
the national spirit which has been so
greatly promoted by the remarkable
events of the past three years, the Span
ish war-and the unavoidable expansion of
our territory, bringing us out of a "splen
did isolation" and making us, as c nation,
a factor in world movements, having a
vastly increasing export trade to pro
mote and protect and making southern
mining and agricultural and industrial
activities conspicuously important in the
national growth. Senator McLaurin has
declared that "as a nation with a firmly
established constitutional government and
enlarged national obligations, -we can no
longer abstain from participation in the
affairs of the world-, 'but must take our
share of the responsibility," and he has
enraged Tillman and the bourbon democ
racy by asserting that what the nation
needs "is a non-partizan patriotism and
statesmanship, more devoted to the build
ing up of our common country than to
party success."
This is an extraordinary statement for
a South Carolina democrat to make. It
indicates a height of non-partizan poli
tics -which Thomas Jefferson himself never
reached. There is no doubt that party
success is often slain In the house of its
friends "because there is no statesmen in
the party who has his ear to the ground
listening to the distant rumbling of a pop
ular demand for something the party has
ignored. The late President McKinley
found the popular voice audible to him
self and he gave utterance to it in his
great and final speech at Buffalo. Senator
McLaurin hears it in the south as a voice
gathering strength.
iHe and Tillman have nothing in com
mon save their convictions as to the
necessity of a "white man's government"
in South Carolina, by which they mean
the disfranchisement of the negro. On
all other topics they are antipodal. Mc-
Laurin has the courage of deep conviction
in his nationalism. He has with him the
vast majority of the growers and spinners
of cotton -and o>f all in the south who are
looking for markets for southern iron and
cotton goods. No cracking of the slave
driver's old whip can terrify these people
into submission to retrograde bourbonism.
Not all the student enthusiasm has been
expended on football. The accounts of
the high school debates between Morris
and Glenwood high schools at Glenwood
and between Moorhead and Fergus Falls
high schools at Fergus Falls indicate the
presence and activity of the "rooter" in
quite as large proportions as might have
been expected had these contests been
fought on the gridiron by centers and
guards and backs instead of on the debat
ing platform by leaders and supporters in
debate. A veracious chronicler says that
the "rooters" held sway for fully half
an-hour after the decision was announced
at Glenwood last Friday night, and that
nothing has ever happened in that town
which developed more local pride than the
result of that contest in the series of
high school debates for T.he Jour
nal's prize silver cup.
Big Salaries for Big Men
Congressman Weeks, who has just re
turned from the Philippines, thinks that
the salaries in the civil service there,
from the commissioners down, are too
large. We are not surprised at Mr.
Weeks' lament. We are surprised that
some one has not made the same protest
before now. Whenever a high salary is
paid in the public service where it is
needed and earned, somebody can be re
lied upon to find fault with it. As a rule
the fault-finder's voice is rarely raised
to protest against salaries that really
are too large.
The temptations that surround a colo
nial officer are many and strong. At a
great distance from the home government,
possessed of broad powers, with numerous
opportunities to interest himself in pri
vate business ventures and use his official
position to promote them, surrounded by
the lax floating population of adventurers
without a surplus of scruples, always to be
found in such a city as Manila under
present conditions, an official must be for
ever on his guard. To these external
temptations there should not be added one
growing out of tha official's necessities.
He should receive a. salary large enough
to enable him to live -well and fashionably
and to save something against the day
when his health will no longer permit him
to remain in the tropics.
For a man of Judge Taft's ability, occu
pying such a responsible position as gov
ernor of the Philippines, $20,000 a year is
none too much; $15,000 is none to much
for the other commissioners. The vice
roy of India receives £50,000 a year—
more than twelve times as much as Gov
nor Taft. The government of the Dutch
i JB.-■**•■ todies pays high salaries — much
higher, as a rule, than we pay In the
Philippines. Of course, there is no occa
sion for a governing agent of a repub
lic; which purposes to conduct a govern
ment for the benefit of the governed to
receive any such sum as that paid to the
viceroy of India. But the rule to be ob
served is that the responsible positions
throughout the Philippines must have
salaries that will attract the ablest men
to the colonial service. Such salaries will
necessarily be higher than would be paid
at home in corresponding positions.

Adam's Diary.
Eden, June 1, 4004 B. C—l found myself |
yesterday, on one of th>e finest bits, of land
scape I ever Raw. The horticultural society J
mutt hp.ve been at work on this place for
years. I cannot seem to remember from what
plaee> I dlropped in, or in fact anything' at |
all about my past life. The only possible
theory that seems to cover my case is* that :
of alternating personality. Some cog dn my \
brain must have slipped and I must have lost
myself and come to ■consciousness in this
place as another party altogether. My name ;
Is surely Adam, but tha.t gives me no light
I looked) in the still water of the brook and
thought and thought. Where have 1 seen I
that face before?
What difference does it make, anyhow? ■
This place is certainly a gem; the climate
Kerns salubrious; the animals are harmless
and interesting, and there is no necessity for
work of any kind. "This la Easy street for
Adam," I said to myself. Still there is some- i
thing lacking.

June 2. —I enjoyed a night of sound, deep
and healthful sleep. This morning I was
astounded to see a strange woman In tihe
garden. I waved by hand at her and said:
"I beg your pardon, but I am certainly
gla-1 to ®e3 a friendly face. My name's
Adam."
"I think lam Eve." ehe replied. "But
what is the meaning of all this? I don't un
derstand. How did I get lieie, and what is
this slace?"
"Madam," I replied, "you know just as
mwh about it a-s I do. It gets me. I spent
half a day yesterday trying to reason it out.
Possibly we are in some mortal dream."
"It's rather a pleasant owe," said Eve, look
ing around so fresh and smiling and showing
her whiito teeth.
It Is plain that this fair stranger is mak
ing a terrible hit with your old frk-nd Adam.
I have never seen a woman that I cared for
in this way before. She's got me a-going the
first day. No more clubs and nights out for
Adam. I dug up the tobacco -plants to-day
and threw them over the hedge. She smiled
bewflderlßgly at me when she saw what I
wa3 up to. It is as plain &c the nose on the
face of nature that the woman, has your old

AMUSEMENTS
"The Casino Girl" at the Metropol
itan.
Much of the effervescence seems to have
evaporated from the "The Casino Girl." The
production is one of those fizzy compounds
in which pretty girls, funny comedians,
catchy music, brilliant costumes and light
footed dancing are mingled after a recipe
known only to.the makers of mixed dramatic
drinks. In the nature of things, these com
pounds are unstable, as they say in chemis
try, and in the course of time the carbonic
acid gas goes off in thin air, leaving the
residue rather thin and spiritless. This is
what seems to have happened to "The Casino
Girl." One readiily understands bow, in its
youth, it had a sparkle and a tang that made
it very pleasant to the palate. It is true that
Minneapolis is now getting its flrat quaff,
and might, therefore, be expected to smack
its lips with gusto. And, indeed, the audi
ences thus far seem to have found the pro
duction at least potable. But they are not
enthusiastic enough to revivify the actors,
long since weary of it all, with their old en
thusiasm.
The best thing in the performance is the
song of ennui in the second act, the refrain
of which is "I'm so tired," and by the time
Harry Short, who isn't short at all, gets
his cue to appear and sing it, every one is
in just the proper state of fatigue to sym
pathize with the singer. Mr. Short ia gifted
with an exceedingly funny pair of legs, agile,
attenuated and expressive. His eccentric
dance following the song makes the only
really palpable hit of the evening.
The company is, on the whole, a good one,
and the wonder Is that there isn't "some
thing doing" ofteuer. The desert spots of
tedium are much too frequent and the oases
of enjoyment too far apart. Ben F. Grinnell
and Rud E. Warren are a pair of robbers,
taken bodily out of "Erminie," and they con
trive to manufacture some tun out of the
shadowy and undefined "sltuationa" with
which they have been provided. Prank Ber
nard, as the pasha with a Germau accent
and a penchant for purchasing new wives,
makes the fourth in the quartet of come
dians. Mr. Bernard Is only intermittently
funuy. J. Hayden Clarendon is inert, good
looking-and a fair tenor. Miss Clara Palmer
as the Casino ■glrh exhibits a voice rather
above the average of the company, but seems
listless and without interest In what goes
on. Miss Nellie McNaughton as the St. Louis
heiress is more properly chic and vivacious.
Miss H-attie Arnold as her giddy mother
evokes a laugh now and again by her inal
apropisms. Then there are Miss Carrie Reyn
olds, very nimble of foot, as the dancing
girl, and eke a number of other personable
maidens in minor roles.
The stage pictures are very pretty and the
music, which- is mostly of the tinkling varie
ty, 13 sung indifferently well.
—W. B. Chamberlain.
"MrFadden'i Plats" at the Bijou.
"McFaddien'S-Row of Flats," a fa«-p comedy
which ia avowedly "con«truoted for laughing
purposes only," and which certainly serves
no other end, is at the Bijou this week. The
skit da not n«w to Minneapolis theater-goers,
but some of the specialties are.
"McFadden-'s Flats" belongs to that not un
familiar class of stage productions which de
pend for success upon the Individual ability
of its players to entertain the audience. There
Is ao plot, andi the dialogue is inconsequen
tial. Therefor* It must be judged from the
standpoint of a vaudeville enow, and from
thai standpoint only.
The best features- of the entertainment are
the musical acts of Otto and Eddie Klein and
the Obt brothers, the specialties of Bobby
Ralston and Jerry Sullivan, the two midg
ets; the tramp specialty of Harry Watson
and the excellent work of the chorus in sev
eral concerted numbers.
The musical act is on© of the best things of
the kind ithat hae been heard at the Bijou
for some time. The four men play all sorts
of instruments and play them well. They
"doublo in brass" most effectively, and play
anything from grand, opera to ragtime with
equal facility.
Harry Watson, the bicycle tramp, was with
the company last season, and he has lost none
of hie ability to please. Ralston and. Sullivan,
the dwarfs, are newcomers. Bobby Ralston's
Scotch specialty is very funny, and he Is ably
abetted by his diminutive partner.
The German specialty of George Yeomans
is too long. If deprived of half his time he
would probably suceed in "making good,"
but as it is he becomes tiresome long before
•the close of the act. Miss* Beatrice Gamble
eings indifferently well, and Katie Rooney
contributes an- Irish specialty, in masculine
attire, that takes well with the audience.
The chorus is called upon to bear the brunt
of the battle much of the time, and acquits it
self creditably. "My Lady Hottentot" and
"Where Are You Going, My Pretty Maids,"
were both we-ll sain.?. The latter selection
finds its raison d'etre in the success of the
Florafiora "Pretty Maidens" sextette, after
which it has been patterned.

The stellar position of Miss Gertrude Cogh
lan stems to be stronger than ever since her
successful assumption) of the title role in

the Metropolitan Friday evening. Miss Cogh
lan will be seen on Thursday and Saturday
evenings and at the Saturday matinee as
Becky Sharp in "Vanity Fair."
If imitation is the slncerest flattery, "Floro
dora" has been, much flattered. A number
I of traveling companies are trying to imitate
I the "Pretty Maidens" sextet. Other pirates
| have tried! to imitate "I "Want to Be a Mili
tary Man," "I've an Inkling," "Willie Was a
Gay Boy," land the other numerous catchy
songs of the play. But they give- but sorry
exhibitions of their stealings. There are 107
1 players in the special company to be seen at
■ the Metropolitan, the first four nights of next
week.
"Pudd'nhead Wilson," with William S. Gill
in the title role., supported by an excellent
: company, will be the Metropolitan's bill for
; the last half of next week.
. There its much interest in the engagement
next week at the Bijou of the famous play,
\ '"The IJttle Minister," with Miss Frances St.e
--' ver-is, an actress of artistic ability, in the role
;of Lady Babbie. Few plays of the century
| have met with greater success or been more
; enthusiastically received than this one. Near
' ly every one Is familiar with the famous
novel written by J. M. Barrie, the play being
a dramaitization, of Ms own. story by the au

"THE MESSIAH"
By the Philharmonic Club.
The Philharmonic club opened its twelfth
season last night with the best performance
' of "The Messiah" ever given in Minneapolis.
And this is but a partial statement of the
truth; for most of the presentations of "The
Messiah" in this city have been quite unsat
isfactory- Handel's masterpiece cannot be
successfully rendered by a small chorus, a
meager orchestra, or indifferent soloists. Its
choral work ie planned for the massive ef
fects of many well-trained voices, its orches
tration must needs have comprehensive treat
ment, and its difficult arias and recitatives
are combined in their rendition. It is for
these reasons that performances of "The
Messiah" in Minneapolis have been ap
proached with some apprehensions—which
I have usually been realized.
So, without making comparisons with pre
vious performances, it is but fair to say that
the Philharmonic club presented "The Mes
siah" in a most satisfactory manner. Better
effects might be obtained with a chorus of
from 300 to s(*o voices; but no chorus, large
or small, could have done more conscientious
work. Mr. Ober-Hoffer, the director, Is to
be congratulated upon the results of his
training. The 130 ladies and gentlemen of
the club under Mr. Ober-Hoffer's direction
certainly obtained from the choral work about
all that could be expected from a chorus of
that size. As in most presentations of the
oratorio, the conspicuous choruses —the "Hal
lelujah" and the closing group commencing
with "Worthy Is the Lamb" —gave evidence
of the most careful preparation and were
sung with the greatest enthusiasm. This is
inevitable. They are recognized as the best
that the oratorio affords; every leader tries
to have them perfect. And at the same time
they appeal more strongly to the singers than
some of the earlier choruses. In no part of
the oratorio was the work of the club heard
to better advantage than in the "Hallelujah"
chorus. It was a spirited, well-balanced and
appreciative rendition.
Of the earlier choruses, the club did tho
best work in "For unto Us a Child Is Born"
and "Glory to God"—the latter a composi
tion which seldom falls to stir the performers
to their best endeavors. ■ Perhaps the least
interesting part of the club's work was in
the opening chorus of the first and second
parts. Of the latter, the majestic "Behold
the Lamb of God" suffered as it always must
must when not eung by an organization of
great numbers, and it should be remembered
that the "Surely, He Hath Borne Our Griefs"
is in a way one of the most difficult parts
of the oratorio; but the animated and dra
matic "All We Like Sheep Have Gone
Astray," which follows, seemed to imbibe
some of the llstleseness which had crept into
its predecessors, and was not griven with
that spirit which its beauties and the other
work of the club seemed to warrant.
Throughout, the singinsr of the club was
characterized with precision of attack, even
ness, and failr expression. The parts were
well balanced, the sopranos bein.g, possibly.
slightly superior to the altos and bassos, with
the tenors almost their equal.
Of ; the soloists, Joseph Baernstein, the
basso, earned and received .the honors of the
■evening., j .Of-the bassos now on the stage,
Baernsteln is probably the leader. His voice
is robust, if not particularly clear, and its
range la magnificent. Of course. Us best
work was in the- dramatic aria,: "Why Do the
Nations?" which was done with such power
ami brilliancy as to lead to the only encore
of the : evening. . Mrs. . Genevleve
Clark Wilson sang the soprano
arias with "technical perfection. and in
her usual charming -way, and Miss Mabelle
Crawford of Chicago, rendered the contralto
soles in a ma.n<ner which won the hearts of
her hearers. Her work improved from the
beginning,.amd in the aria, "He. Shall Feed
His Flock,", reached a height jof expression
which had not been , anticipated. A more
sympathetic and tender rendition of this ex
quisite number has seldom, been heard!. The

TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBEE 10, 1901.
si|f\Tj ir-S==yi aflrT-^
Copyright, 1901, by Alexander Bruce.
Up in the dingy office of the Evening Star,
Patrick Ryan, the bookkeeper, was reading a
letter. He smiled brightly, for the writer
was his Dromisod wife.
Down in the underground chamber of the
mine sat David Graf ton, the manager. He,
too, was reading a letter, and his face gTew
black as thunder. He peered closer and closer
to the typewritten sheet, as though he could
scarce believe his eyes. The room waa lighted
by candles in miners' sharp-pointed candle
sticks, ami stray puffs of air made them
flicker badly.
"Jack," he cried sharply, "Ha-ggart writes
that the output must be doubled or the mine
closes "dawn.."
That was the truth, but not the whole truth.
It was the bluff -with which he had decided to
■win Jack over to his side.
"What's that you say?" answered Jack, a
bent and bearded Cornishman.
He was down on. his knees connecting a feed
pipe with a diamond drill sot against the face
of the rock.
"The output must be doubled or the mine
closes dowo," repeated Graf ton In a higher
key.
"Can't do it. It ain't in the Evening Star
to twinkle that bright."
"But it's in the Busy Bee. Our private
borings show it," ■whispered Grafton.
Jack wasn't surprised at the speech. He
knew Grafton well, had worked with him for
years, so he swung ro-und on his knees and
leered: "Going to steal? Eh?"
"We're just taking a loan. If we don't,
the entire bank of cash we've thrown into
this cursed hole is gone, and," as a parting
shot, "your loane go with it."
The old man was silent. A nervous twitch
ing of the mouth betrayed his excitement, and
his hands trembled as he stretched out to
untie the red handkerchief in the can beside
him. He pulled out a sandwich and began
munching at it. Grafton rose and stood
looking at him sheepishly. Neither spoke for
a time.
The 000-foot level of the Evening Star had
been run 100 feet westward from the main
shaft, timbered up solid like a tunnel all the
way. Beyond was the underground room
where the manag-er and the drill hands were
working. Then came five feet of solid rock,
yet unexcavated, inside the boundary line of
the mm*. Beyond that every inch of rock be
lon-ged to the Widow Baird.
The late owner of the Busy Bee had sunk
a shaft and followed the l»adstar lode west
ward with Indifferent success, while all un
known to him iin the eastern portion of his
mine bounded by the Evening Star lay tons
of the wealth which makes men mad. Year
aff?r year of heavy expenditure, poor returns
and a superabundance of litigation had dis
heartened him, so the Busy Bee closed down.
Shortly afterward Baird died. It was said
that disappointment had crushed him. Graf
ton had been the deceased's intimate compan
ion and one of the experts whose advice Baird
had relied upon. Knowing Hie widow's low
financial fctate, he assured Haggart, "We can
buy the mine for a song."
The Evening Star was completely played
out. No one knew that better than Grafton,.
He was drawing a princely salary for his
work, ami the monthly reports to the owner
had been couched in grandiloquent language,
but the latter's eyes were open at last. Graf
ton had approached the widow with a miserly
offer and was staggered at the reply, "The
mine Is not for sale." He knew the woman
had nothing. Her daughter's beggarly earn
ings as a milliner could not keep them both
and pay rent and taxes besides. Some one
was doing It, and the manager swore roundly
at the unknown benefactor.
When the Cornishman finished his scanty
lunch, ho began leisurely oiling the drill
bearings. Grafton stood 'superintending.
"You'ro not with us, then, Jack?"
"I'm mot saying I'm not," war. the sharp
rep^y.
Grafton grinned. He knew from, that the
man would be easily bribed, so he let the
matter rest.
"You'll be on till 8, then?"
"Yes, sir."
"Very good. If Ryan comes down when I'm
gone, don't let him in here. We don't want
him longer. It's as well not to let him see
the position of the drill."
"Aye, aye," muttered Jack.
The manae-er seized a candle and hurried
alang the level to the shaft and entered the
cage, which fame swinging up to the surface.
He had an uncomfortable task to perform
and mads straight for the office. Ryan saw
him coming and crushed the love letter in his
pocket.
"Morning," said Grafton gloomily.
Tne> bookkeeper cheerfully acknowledged
the half-hearted salutation. He had been au
exemplary clerk, and the manager felt it nec
essary to screw up his courage under cover
Daily New York Letter
A Mysterious Airship.
Dec. 10.—A mysterious balloon, which, ac
cording to the testimony of two spectators,
appeared to be propelled by some motive pow
er other than wind, was se*en yesterday at
Moriches, L. I.
Those who saw the airship were H. L..
Terry of Sayville and Alfred Chichester of
Center Moriches. They say the machine was
high up in the air and was coming from the
southeast to the northwest.
There seemed to be issuing from the balloon
rither smoke or Steam from side to side, as
If it contained some kiad of an engine.
A Long: Submarine Trip.
About the only feat as yet unoertatn of ac
complishment in the operating of a submarine
torpedo boat will be attempted to-morrow by
the recently completed but already famous
Fulton, -which -will start from its anchorage
In Long Island sound, on a 650-nrile trip on
and under water from New York to Washing
ton. No submarine boat has ever attempted
such a task be-fore.
The Pulton will make the trip with tte cap
tain, Frank T. Cable, and a crew of seven
men. These -mariners say^that they will feel
safer at sea in a storm than in a regular
oceim-gclng craft, for if the Fulton gets into
a raging sea it will simply turn its nose to
the bottom of the sea, and when it gets to a
depth where the motion of the water is not
felt it will get on- its course again.
The Fulton will be accompanied by the
yacht Giralda. with the Holland's officers.
Anarchists Attack Rooaeveit.
President Roosevelt and his message were
attacked and denounced in the most virulent
manner at a meeting of anarchists last night
at Civic hall in E Twenty-eighth street.
Emma Goldman was the leading spirit of
the me^tins. The Social Science Club, an
organization of anarchists, had called the
meeting. Stepping on the platform. Miss
Goldman introduced R. Grosemann, one of her
most enthusiastic lieutenants. He launched
forth Into a bitter attack on President Roose
velt, hold.lng a copy of the president's mes
sage in his hand.
"The language need by President Roosevelt
In Ms message," said Grossmann, "denoun
cing anarchists, is the language an intoxicat
ed man mighit have used in a Bowery saloon.
Tho whole message Is not only a collection of
misrepresentation, but a pack of downright
lies. Roosevelt says anarchists aim at all
government. This is absolutely correct.
"Roosevelt is a tool of plutocratic crimi
nals and all his talk Is nothing but nonsensi
cal twaddle. I thought he was a man of re
flnemeut a<ni education, but I have now come
to the conclusion that he 'has not enough
brains to think straight."
Grosemann then praised Czolgosz, McKin
ley's assassin. "We recognize in the deed of
Cflolgosz," he cried, "the energetic act of a
warrior taking his proper revenge."

Of the orchestra's part of the concert, it
must be said that it was the weakest part,
but the members deserve commendation for
their conscientious attention to the very diffi

of a pretended search. He pulled out letter
books, ledgers, anything he could lay hU
hands on, and unlocked a sroa.ll private draw
er, drew out a file of papers and began fum
bling among tihem. A small blue print slipped
out and fell unnoticed on the floor. At last
ho closed the drawer -with a bang and turntd
round' abruptly.
"We don't need your services longer, Ryan.
Here's your check. Leave the keys on the
desk. I'll get them when I return."
He glanced at his -watch, muttered "Eleven,
tweuty-nve" and walked out.
Ryan, stunned, stood staring at the check.
He bad been engaged on a week's notice,
and an extra salary was included. How was
he to help Mary and her mother now? He
had been lending them half hia salary to
enable them to hold on to their mine. Posi
tions were scarce In this section of the coun
try, and his spirits sank low. What -would
Mary think of it? Mury was the "beggarly
milliner."
He began, slowly to replace the books which
littered the floor. The blu*> print lay between,
a tattered ledger and a letter book. He picked
it up iand turned it over.
"What's this?"
It -was a private chart Bhowlng the bor
ings through the boundary to the Busy Bee,
and the assays averaged $200 per ton. Ryan
whistled softly, slipped the paper In hia
pocket, closed the safe and tossed the keys
on the desk. Urafton had taken the south
road to Ripple, and Pat didn't want to meet
him, so be climbed the dump on the north
dido of the shaft and hurried down the hill.
A whistle tooted up the canyon.
"That must be the 11:45."
He rushed down the rocky pathway, climb
ing bowlders, dodging spruce stumps, slid
ing on~the dry pine needles, until he reacne 1
• the depot.
"Going to Dunton, Mr. Ryan?" drawled the
station agent.
"Yea," gulped Pat, breathlessly.
The man pushed down the signal lever, and
the roar of the oncoming train lessened as
it swung round the bend, slowed down and
fatopped. Pat jumped in, the conductor
raised the green flag, the locomotive snorted
loudly, and the glittering tracks shot out
iroin beneath.
Up on the miners' ridge a man wae run
ning, waving frantically. Pat recognized
him, but the 11:45 thundered on through the
canyon.
At Dunton depot, two hours later, Pat met
Cuthbert, the chief telegraph operator.
"Hello, Ryan! Business brisk at the mine?'"
"Nothing doing at all; Just been fired."
"Want a job, then? Burke quit this morn
ing. Come right over now. And the affabla
operator grabbed Pat's arm and led him into
the office.
Ryan understood the work. He had serwd
his Lime on the Western Union. He thanked
Cuthbert, threw off his jacket and sat dowu
before the machine. Tick—tick! A message
was claiming interpretation:
"Haggart, Boston Block, Dunton: Exca
vations in western section start immediately.
—"Graf ton.
Pat knew the western section to be worth
less. The blue print and the telegram con
firmed his suspicions—Grafton was going to
steal. On the stroke of C he boarded a car
at the office door and got off at a milliner's
store.
He had scarcely released the spring doon
when a girl's voice cried "Patsy!" and a pair
of doft arms were round his neck, pulling his
head forward and down on the artificial vio
lets on the counter.
The greetings over, Mary surprised him
with unexpected news.
"Mother's just had a proposal. Patsy. The,
gentleman comes for his answer to-night."
"Who is it?"
"Mr. Grafton."
"What!" exclaimed Ryan.
Now ha understood why the man waved so
frantically. Heavens! If he had caught tho
train, there would have been no telegram:
he'd have arrived here ahead of me, thought
Pat.
Next afternoon Grafton called on the wid
ow, but he did not stay long. Later he
boarded the Santa Ke for the Pacific coast,
and Haggart never saw him again.
In the underground chamber of tho Eve
ning Star the black diamonds had pierced
through fourteen feet of solid rock, and the
rich vein of the Busy Bee showed up richer
every foot. The machine was etill dronlnf
noisily when Ryan and his attorney entered!
"Stop that drill!" shouted Ryan.
Jack sprang up.
"You can't come in here; Grafton's orders!"
he roared.
"You are not likely to take further orders
from Grafton," said Ryan quietly.
The Cornishman's face went white.
"What —d'you—mean?" he stammered.
"1 mean the game's up," answered Ryan.
Jack stopped tho drill, and the Evening
Star closed down.
, This stirred up Emma Goldman, -who. Jump
ing up and speaking at the top of her voice,
broke forth Into a eulogy of Czolgosz.
"In standing alone and facing his murderers
at Auburn," said Miss Goldman, "Czolgosx
showed that he was the bravest of men."
Alexander H. Orr denounced President
Roosevelt as a great criminal. Ho ■was re
sponsible, he said, now for all criminal acts,
committed in the United States.
Tammany Cleans the City.
It is the Intention of Tammany leaders to
turn over to the incoming administration, on
Jan. 1, a city as clean morally as It is pos
sible to make it. J Looking to this end, an
order has been issued for the closing of all
poolrooms. It covers tha entire city, from
the Bowery to Fordham, although it Is said
in a few cases an understanding has been
reached that will permit business to be done
1 on the quiet until Christmas week.
A Bank: Combine.
At a special meeting of the shareholders of
the National Citizens' bank end the Ninth
National, it was decided to increase the capi
tal stock of the National Citizens' bank to
$1,550,000 and th« par value of the shares from
$25 to $100. Of the mew stock $360,000 la to be
used in acquiring the assets of the Ninth Na

liabilities of the Ninth.
The Ninth National -will thus be merged
with the National Citizens' after Dec. 31.
The Blue Diamonds.
Every blue diamond known to history will
hang from the branches of American Christ
mas trees, If current gossip among Jewelers
is true. The three largest above ground are
I now In New York and Bold to -wealthy Amer

of generosity. Benjamin P. Cheney of Bos
ton has Just bought from J. Drelcer the sec
ond largest Jewel of this kind known to the
market. This will be his Christmas gift to
his wife, -who Is known on the stage as Julia
Arthur. Her collection of Jewels Is already
famous. By.far tho most famous diamond
in the lot is the Hope diamond, recently pur
chased in London by Joseph Frankels Sons
in Nassau street for, they say, a wealthy
New Yorker as the central figure lor his
family Christmas tree. ..;'.".-,.
Still & third diamond of blue color is said
by Gattle, Stern & Co., to have been pur
chased for them for another New York ous
tomer, and is said to be nearly as large as
the Dreicer diamond. This is still in their
possession, but It Is to tie delivered befora
Christmas.
Blue diamonds are almost as rare as blue
roses, and the history of those of any size
has been full of romance as the lives of the
crowned heads which they have usually or
namented. The total values of the three
Jewels now In this city is estimated at $640,

Jewelers. > • - -
