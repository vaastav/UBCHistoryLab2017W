BELGIAN DEPORTATIONS. If il
Governor-General Bissing let the cat out
of the bag- when he stated that the Belgians
were being deported in order that "the
fewest possible Germans (might) be with
drawn from our front lines to watch over
Belgium;" favorable action on the United
States protest against the practice would
herefore seem a possibility very remote.
-As long as Germany attempted to pal-
iate her actions on economic grounds,
there was a chance that she might bf
brought to see the error o fher ways. But
we now know it is not that the Belgians
aren i worKin, u is mai uic uennans nccu The Germans were so severely
workers ; it IS not that there IS nothipg f or I trounced on the Somme that they are
me ueigians to ao in tneir native country, -e m .
President Wilson with his 2,000
word message, knows how to get into

GREETINGS.
Welcome to Florida, Oh, Kentucky
Hunting Party; welcome ' .to the Happy
Hunting Grounds!
When we think of the playfur trout and
the driving quail and the dainty squirrel
and the unassuming doves and the stal
wart bear and the curving deer that will be
yours, we have visions of the days when we
fared forth in quest of game in other
climes and came back empty-handed not
havng the advantages which you have.
We hope you will like our country as
much as our people like your methods-
This isn't a land selling excursions we
know you have splendid and well establish-
ed farms back in Kentucky, . here the julep
beds are giving way to pasturage, and we
know that you do .not contemplate giving
them up but we would like to have you
stay with us! 'Hie stories that Eubanks
and Godfrey and Jennings and all the rest
brought back show that you are the right
sort. . . '
But tell your friends about West Flor
ida; grub-stake your poorer relatives to a
claim in pur' virgin opportunity; help your
foremen who are thinking of branchings
out for themselves, to establish themselves
in what we are pleased to call God's coun-.
try and hope you will do the same.
Don't Jell them too much about our
climate It has been overdone. We don't
want sick people; we don't want quitters
we don't want hardship dodgers. We want
the strongest and bravest and most capable
men in the country that's why we take
such pleasure in welcoming you; that's the
message we ask you to take back to Ken
tucky when you have studied the work and
play of Sunshine Land. .
THE MARINA EXPLANATION.
Germany has acknowledged torpedoing
the Marina a fact we knew already! and
has made indirect offer of reparation for
the six Americans who were lost which is
the very least that could have been ex
pected. The Marina, it will be remembered, was
trie vessel which was sunk without warn
ing just on the eve of our election. That
President Wilson did not make political
capital out of an opportunty, at a time
when he was most bitterly assailed for his
peaceful, just methods, to take a truculent
stand, solidify the country back of him, and
as.ure his flection, then gravely in doubt,
even if the price was war, is in accord with
onr traditions of internationalism ; and
Germany has given abundant proof subse
quently of an apparently sincere desire to
lespect neutral and non-belligerent rights
at least so far as pertains to the United
States.
But the Teutonic explanation that the
Marina was sunk without warnincr because
the U-boat commander "thought" it .was
a transport, while it is friendly, is not
enough,4 nor can any amount of blood
money, bring the dead Americans back to
life. The German commander should have
krown; his half-cock eagerness to loose the
engines of destruction against innocent
men simply proves that he is unfit for serv
ice, and the least the United States can ex
pect is that he be reduced from his com-
rr.and.
President Wilson has already spoken of
the intolerable position of the neutral a
-fact which is urging us to establish the
League to Enforce Peace, and uphold its
police powers with a strong army and a.
mighty fleet; in the meantime, President
Wilson must insrst that no vessel be tor
pedoed without warning, whether neutral
or enemy, not a ship of war.
President Wilson has invited Bryan
to take a lunch, with him. and the
country is wondering whether any
plums will be served for dessert.
Linotype operators will learn to
their horror that Count Szeptycki
has been appointed commander in the
Polish army.
it is that the Germans need soldiers on
their battlefields.
Every thousand Belgians deported
means that the army of occupation can be
creased just that much; and the substitu
tion of Belgian laborers for German means
that the trenches .will be filled, as the say
ing is, coming and going. A hundred thou
sand Belgians have to date been torn from
their homes, and the outrage is being con-

THAT CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. ,
Of course you are going to dc that
Christmas shopping early that's the
fashion nowadays, and fashion is a good
tiiiner to tollow. even when its amis are
humanitarian and not selfish.
Time was, and not so long ago, that the
stores advertised the lure of shopping by
night. Our scrap book yields up the yA
that the old-fashioned fellow who
used to wait at the church door after
preaching and invite everybody to
take dinner with him, now stays home
to curse' the high cost of living; and
the old-fashioned foot stamping ora
tor refrains because of the high cost
of leather.

It Will Pay
With the present shortage of food
stuff there is no doubt but that Santa

sell every article of food that they
can produce in the next twelve
months at a good price. With this
fact settled there is no reason why
every farmer in the county should
not make his plans to raise a crop of

Why Blood Impurities

. Nature Takes This Means to Get Rid of Them
Modern science has proven that
boils and carbuncles, pimples and un
sightly skin blotches, are danger sig
nals of diseased blood. Scaly skin and
itching Eczema, Scrofula, rashes
all skin diseases are aggravated by
bad blood it's the infected blood
that's dangerous. Don't wait for the
boils. If you have pimples and
blotches, take quick action. Pimples
tell you that your blood is filled with
impurities. You must wash out your
blood, strengthen and stimulate it to
healthy . action with Nature's own
blood tonic, S. S. S. It is the stand
ard blood purifier of the world. Don't
use any drugs, don't use ointments
and salves. S. S. S. reaches the blood,
drives out the impurities. It makes
healthy perspiration the poison lit
erally sweated out through the skin.
Boils blotches, Eczema and the Scrof
ula indications disappear. It does
what salves antHotions can ntver do
it goes to the very root of the
trouble by reaching the blood. Your
skin becomes clear and you soon Yeel
the vigor of the return of perfect
health. S. S. S. is purely vegetable.
You can get it at any druggist's, but
you must take S. S. S. Let us tell
you about blood diseases. (Write for

Stands to Reason
If the cost of living can be reduc
ed as a result of having good road3,
and it is doubtful if any one would
care to dispute the statement to that
effect which has been made by gov
ernment experts after an exhaustive
study of condition,- both before and
after the acquisition of good roads
in certain sections of the country,
then it stands to reason that it is
cheaper in the long run to have good
roads than it is to continue paying
the higher rates that are imposed
where the good roads do not exist.

Danger Signal.
If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help
to put out the fire? It is much the .
same way with a cough. A cough is
a danger signal as" much as a fire
bell. You should no more try to
suppress it than to stop a fire bell
when it is ringing, but should cure
the disease that causes the coughing.
This can nearly always be done by
taking Chamberlain's Cough Kemedy.
Many have used it with the most ben
eficial results. It is especially val
uable for the persistent cou;jh that
so often follows a bad cold or an
attack of grip. Mrs. Thoma3 Reech
ing, Andrews, Ind., writes: "During
the winter my husband takes colds--
easily and coughs and coughs. Cham

medicine for breaking up these at
