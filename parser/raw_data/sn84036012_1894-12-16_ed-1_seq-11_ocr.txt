BUTTS,Dm. 15.^The pulpit's as-^SailrOSOt of tha wm s**m* to^bara M altoswtbar contrary effect^U this tut*. Instaad of bats* wipwl out of^existence by tb^ terrible denunciation of^^ local pastor, tbe theater ess mi to be re-^eairlng a lot of now recruiu and now Ufa.^for Instance tbere Is Herr Band mans of^tbe Bitter Root, who has placed himself^at the head of a company of Missoula^talent, form and beauty, and announces,^with deliberation and premeditation, that^be will come rfcbt to Bona and into tbe^enemy's camp to demonstrate that tbe^theater is not dying quite so rapidly and^surely as tbe reverend Mr. Horrors tried^to make himself bolieva it was.
Andthere te ^Fisky^ Barnett of Great^Falls. Everybody from tbe Butt* county^Jail to Squsdunk knows Fisky. Well,^Fisky go** it let footed that he will make^a few meandertnes over the state with a^newly organised burlesque company of^which Ida Clayton is tbe bead and body.^Flaky is groat at burlesque. He made a^burlesque of a great many things during^his career. Be attempted to burlesque^the law during bis residence in Butte out^Judge Spear wouldn't bare it.
Thenthan is ^Iron Foot^ Johnson,^who has been baring a bard run of it to^bold bis residence in Butte because tbe^polio* seem to think the town could get^along bettor without him. ^Iron Foot^^writes that if permitted to remain in town^a few days longer he will then leave at the^head of a new minstrel company which,^be says, is being organised and of which^be is to bo superintendent and general^manager.
Ofcourse It is hare not at all Intended^to mention Herr Bandmann'e company of^tragedians In the same breath with the^otber two organisations. Tbe latter are^mentioned simply to show tbe effect of^the pulpit's attack on the stage.
Tbegreat Tavary Grand English Opera^company will inaugurate their Butte en^^gagement Monday night, coming here di^^rect from Denver. The advance sale of^scats has been the largest ever known in
cestui in winning; public favor. It was^at Munich that the most interesting^period of the young artist's Ufa occurred.^King Ludwig of Bavaria heard nor sing^and was enamored of her role*. He ap^^pointed her a permanent prim* donna of^tbe Royal opera, and she remained thus^attached until Ludwig's death, after^which ehe became free again to sing In^tbe theater* of all Europe. Ludwig^prised her singing above that of aU others,^and it is a significant circumstance that^bar's was tbe last voice that ever sung to^tbe despondent king just before hi* un^^happy death.
Whn Frederick Warde was last In San^Francisco ho a*k*d William Greer Harri^^son, the man who is called ^playwriter,^waterwriter and underwriter,^ because of^the variety of his engagements, to make^for him a romantic woodland dramy, says^Eddy'i Squib. Mr. Harrison promptly re^^plied that no subject is so suitable for^such a play as the story of Robin Hood,^but he would be afraid to turn that story^into a play, a* it has been so well used in^ballad, in prose, fiction and in comic^opera. Mr. Warde, however, was de^^lighted with the suggestion and usgod Mr.^Harrison to writ* a play upon the legend*^about tbis noble Saxon outlaw of Sher^^wood. Mr. Harrison answered that ha^would write tbe play, but he would make^tbe principal scene the signing of the^Magna Charta at Runnymede and bring^Robin Hood incidentally into that historic^picture, instead of confining the drama to^scenes in the forest, where tbe outlaw^and his companions pierced with arrows^tbe king's game and drank brown October^ale. Mr. Warde suggested that the play^be divided into four acts, each act ^bow^^ing a different season of the year. The^suggestion pleased Mr. Harrison and^in time that could be spared from direct^^ing an insurance business he wrote the^play of ^Runnymede.^ Frederick Wards^has accepted it and will soon produce It,^himself playing the part of Robin Hood^and Louis Jams* playing Friar Tuck.

theamusement history of Butte, and the^interest which baa so far been manifest^must indeed prove gratifying to Manager^Pratt of tho Tavary company. All day^yesterday and to-day tbe sale of seats^continued and at night the sale amounted^far into the thousands. The repertoire is^meat gratifying, and a better selection^than ^II Trovatore^ for the opening night^could not have been msde. On Tuesday^^Faust^ will be sung; Wednesday mat^^inee. ^Carmen^; in the evening, ^Rigo-^istto^; Thursday, ^Rigolstto,^ and Fri^^day night Wagner's immortal ^Lohen^^grin.
Whatwill make tbis engagement of^more than ordinary interest is the fact^that tbis will be tbe first English opera^company to tour tbe United States, ana^tbe assurance that the Tavary company^will be tbe only organisation that will pre^^sent English grand opera in America this^season. There has been so much printed^with reference to Madsme Tavary that^the desire to hear her is most general.^Madame Tavary can be truly called a^great artist. Her achievements in the^past have given ber an enviable position^in grand opera, and her triumphs havo^been repeatedly mentioned In these col^^umns. Born in Cologne, reared in Rus^^sia, and following the bent of natural in^^clinations, ber musical education was be^^gun when but a mere child, and having^passed through the labyrinth of all mu^^sical ordeals she has attained the height^of artistic fame.' The private life of Mane^Tavary, however, discloses much that is^intense and extraordinary, and that reads^more as a story in fiction than of real life.^Tbe transition from ohild'a life on a se^^cluded estate to that of a favored lady at^royal court and prima donna of royal^opera in a few brief years was cert.iinly^wide and romantic. Marie Tavary ^ a^ born^at Cologne in 1802, ber family name being^Basta. Her father was a Russian of nobtu^family, ber mother a singer attached to^the royal court. Herearlv life was patseil^altogether on her father's estate. Early^it was discovered that sho possea so I a^voice of rarest quality and range. Its cult .^ration was begun, ending in tini-wiili^pupilage under Mine. Marclici in Pans^and Lamperli, and linally under Abbe^Lisit. Dramatic action was obtained^through long study with Roger, the^famous French tenor. Her operati^-^career began. She made her debut at^great Li Seals, Milan ns I.vcn. Sue

Youwould hardly believe that a minis^^ter of the gospel would make a deliberate^misquotation or garble it for tbe purpose^of making a point against tbe theater. A^local preacher a few Sundays ago quoted^the great Mac ready a* denouncing hi*^own profession in these words: ^None^of my children ehall ever, with mv con^^sent, enter a theater or have anything to^do with actors.^ What Mac ready may^have said was that tbe theater was no^place for children, but be also said: ^A^theater is a place of recreation for tbe^sober-minded and intelligent.

Sincetbe establishment of the govern^^ment of tbe United ^Ntntes tbe money^power hss sought to control the circulat^^ing medium of tbe country. In 1791 tbey^succeeded in securing a charter for a^United States bank of issuo for 30 ^ eara.^At the expiration of its charter in 1811 It^went out of business. In 1816 another of^the same kind, but on a larger scale, was^chartered for a like period. It was with^this corporation that President Jack^^son hail bis celebrated contest. In 1862,^under great financial pressure and with^the lineal descendant of the old whig^party, (always lenient toward monopo^^lies), in political control of the govern^^ment, the existing national banking sys^^tem was foisted upon the nation. From^tbe first It has aimed at and struggled dis^^cretely but energetically to secure a mo^^nopoly of the circulation of the country. It^is now making a systematic and most^powerful effort to consummate that^scheme.
Underthese circumstances it appears^appropriate to recall the viewj upon tbis^subject of the most eminent statesmen^and purest patriots tint our country has^produced^and especially of them whose^wisdom, ability and ajaj for their coun^^try's we.faro brought tbe democratic^party into existence and guarjed its action^dur.ng tho period of its power and glory.^That their opinions and policy upon this^stt!ijr-c: may be compared witli the policy^^ ^f their political successors^Cleveland,^Carlisle, et at. of the ilein ^ora ^^ faith^^w ho claim to take the laasMngg of theso^ST* it in mi as ttie I tn'lni ir^s an I be icon^liejht* bg whs** S* govern their political^anion at Washington at ''ie pr^s^M day.
Itia letter! ^ Albert 0* 111 test Dec. 1^,^'I liotii is Jefferso'1 uro'e:
Thisinstitution inatioual bank) is
oneof most deadly hostility against the^principles and farm of our constitution^Ought w* then to give further growth to^an institution so powerful, so bo*tile^^* * * Nowwhil* we are strong It Is th.^greatest duty we owe to the safety of ou^constitution, to bring this powerful^enemy to a perfect subordination to^authority. The first measure would b* to^reduce them to an equal footing with^otber banks as to favors of the govern^^ment.^ Jefferson's works, vol. t, pp.
ut-ao.
Not.6,1818, In a tetter to John W. Kpp^,^Jefferson wrote:
Thesubscribers may be one, two,^three or any otber number of individuals^(many single individuals combined being^able to pay in five million), whereupon^this bank olegarchy or monarchy enters^the Held with $30,100,000 to direct and^control the polities of tbe nation. Of the^influences of thee* institutions on our^politics, and into what scale it will be^thrown, we have bad abundant ex^^perience. Indeed England hsrself may^be tbe real, white ber friend and trustee^her* sbaU be the nominal and aol* sub^^scriber.
Agala,in a tetter to John Adams, 'an.^24, 1814, Jefferson wrots: ^I have^oppossd money of banks, not^banks discounting for cash, but those^foisting their own paper into circulation,^and thus banishing our cash. My seal^against the** institutions was so warm^and open at the establishment of tbe^United State* that I was derided as a^maniac by the tribe of bank managers^who were seeking to filch from the public,^thus swindling on barren gains.
Andagain Oct. 15.1815, in a letter to Al^^bert Galliton, Mr. Jefferson wrote: ^We^are undone my dear sir. if this banking^mania is not suppressed. Put down the^banks, and if this country could not be^carried through the longest war against its^most powerful enemy, without ever know^^ing tbe want of a dollar, without depen^^dence upon the traitorous classes of her^citisens, without bearing bard on the re^^sources of tbe people, or leaving the pub^^lic with an indefinite burtheon of debt, I^know nothing of my countrymen.**
Andagain in a letter to John Taylor,^May 28tb, 1816, Mr. Jefferson wrote: ^The^system of banking we have both equally^and ever reprobated. I contemplate it as^a blot in all our con:^' -tons wbieh if not^covered will end in ibeir destruction;^which Is already hit by tbe gambler In^corruption and which ia sweeping away^In its progress tbe fortunss and morals^of our cit sens.
Thocharter of the first U. S. bank bar^^ing expired in 1811, Mr. Jefferson ex^pressed himself as follows: ^The banks^bare discontinued themselves. We are now^without any paper medium, and neces^^sity a* wall a* patriotism and confidence^will make us all agree to receive treas^^ury note*, if founded on specific taxes.^Congress may now borrow of the public,^d without interest, all the money it may^want. * * * In the war of 175) our^state availed itsslf of tbis fund, by issu^^ing a paper money bottomed on a specific^tax for it* redemption and to insure its^credit, bearing interest at 6 per cent.^Within a very short time not a bill of this^amission was to be found in circulation.^It bad been lacked up in tbe chests of ex^^ecutors, guardians, widows, farmers, etc.^We then issued bills bottomed on a re^^deeming tax. but bearing no interest.^These were readily received and never da;^preoiated a farthing.^ ^^^^^
Bankpaper must be suppressed and^tbe circulating medium restored to tbe^nation, to whom it belongs. It is the only^fund on wbieh we can rely; it is tho only^recourse which cannot fail, and it is an^abundant one for every necessary pur^^pose. Treasury biUs bottomed on taxes,^bearing or not bearing Interest, as may be^expedient, thrown into the circulation^will take tbe place of so much gold and^silver.^-Jefferson's Works, vol. 6, pp. 13)^to 241 and 434-5.
Thecharter of the Second United States^bank was to expire by limitation In 183u,^and in 1833 congress passed a bill to re-^cbarter it, and this bill President Jack^^son vetoed and soon after refused to allow^deposits of government fund* with it. In^hi* annual message to congress, Dec. 3.^1833, be said: ^Tbe question is distinctly^presented, whether the people of the^United States are to govern through rep^^resentatives chosen by their unbiased suf^^frages, or whether tbe power and money^of a great corporation are to be secrjlly^exerted to influence their judgment and^control their decisions. It must now be^determined whether the bank is to nave^its candidates for all offices in the coun^^try, from the highest to tbe lowest, or^whether candidates on both sides of polit^^ical questions shall be brought forward as^heretofore and supported by the usual^means. If congress has the right under^the constitution to issue paper money, it^was givsn to it by tbe people to be used by^itself only, and not to be delegated to in^^dividuals or corporations.^ ^ * * ^it^is a corrupt and abominable institution,^buying up the press and interfering with^elections. The national banks openly^claim the power of regulating tbe cur^^rency throughout the United states. In^other words it asserted (and undoubtedly^possessed) tbo power to raako iiiouoy^plenty or scarce at its pleasure.
Againin his message of Dee. 2,1831,^Prest lent Jackson said: ^Circumstances^make it my duty to call the attention of^congress to tho Bank of the United^Stales. Created for tbe convenience of^the government, that Institution has be^^come the scourge of the people. Its inter^^ference to postpone tbe payment of a por^^tion of tbe national debt, that it might^retain the public money appropriated for^that purpose to strengthen it in the^political contest, the extraordinary exten^^sion, and contraction of its accommoda^^tions to the community. Its corrupt and^partisan loans, its exclusion of the public^directors from a knowledgo of its most^important proceedings, the unlimited^authority conferred on its president to ex^^pend its funds in hiring writers and pro^^curing tbo execution of printing, and the^use made of that authority; the retention^of the pension money and bonks after tbe^selection of new agents, have through^bureau channels been laid before con^^gress, esse Events have satisfied^my mind, and I think tbe minds of the^American people, that the mischief and^danger which flow from a national bank^far overbalance all its advantages. Tbe^bold effort tbe present bank has made to^control the government, the distress it^has wontonly produced, the violence of^which it has been the occasion in ono of^our cities famed for its observance of law^and order, are but premonitions of the^Ir.tc which awaits the American people^should ;t bey be deluded into a perpetua^^tion of this institution or the establish^^ment of another like it.
JohnC. Calhoun said: ^Place the^money in the hands of a single individual^or combination and they, by expanding or^contracting the currency, may raise or^sink the price at pleasure, and by pur^^chasing at tbe greater depression and^selling at tho greater elevation, may com^^mand the whole property and industry of^the community and control tho financial^operations. Never was an engine better^calculated to place the destiny of the^many in the hands of a few or less favor^^able to that equality and independence^that lie at the bottom of our free institu^^tions.
Nowsee what democracy's last really^great statesman thought of national banks^of issue. Senator Thomas H. Benton said:^^Tbe government ought not to delegate^this power, if it could. It ia too great a^power to be trusted to any banking busi^^ness whatever, or to any authority but the^highest and most responsible known to a^form of government. The government it^^self ceases to be independent, it ceases to^be safe, when the currency is at the wiU^of a company. *
Thegovernment can undertake no^great enterprise, neither of war^nor of peace, without the consent and^cooperation of tho banks. It cannot count^its revenue six months ahead without re^^ferring to the action of the bank; its^friendship or its enmity, its concurrence^or it* opposition. The people are not^safe allien sucli a bank has such a power^^tbo issuing of tbe money. Tbe tempta^^tion is too great, the opportunity too easy^to put up and put down prices; to make^and break fortunes; to bring the whole^community on its knees to these Nep^^tune* who preside over the flux and reflux^^f paper money. All property is at their^mercy, tbe price of real estate, of every^growing crop, of every staple article in tbe^market ia at their command. Slocks are^the playthings with which tbey gamble^w*tn as little or less morality than com^^mon gamblers.
Andthis is what Chief Justice Sslmon^P. Chsse said, who, as secretary of the^United Stales treasury In 1862. recom^^mended the enactment of the law estab^^lishing the present system of national^banks: ^My agency in procuring tbe^passage of the national bank act was the^greatest financial mistuks of my life. It^has built up a monopoly that effects every^interest in the country. It should be re^^pealed, but before this can be accom^^plished tbe people will be arrayed on one^side and ibo banks on the other in a con^^test such as we have never seen in this^country.
Theparamount political question now^confronting the Amorican people is iden^^tical with that upon which I hare quoted^Jefferson. Jackson, Calhoun and R -nton.
