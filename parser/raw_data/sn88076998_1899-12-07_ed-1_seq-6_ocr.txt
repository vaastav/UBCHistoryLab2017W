A LATE'issue of the London Times
atated that at least a score of persons
perish each year in Switzerland in try

THE Austrian post office is to try a
"telegram card," on which a person
writes a message and posts in the
usual way, but the post office telegraphs
the contents, which are delivered to
the address by the postman. The plan
is a combination of post and telegraph,
and seems useful as having a cost and
speed intermediate between post and
telegraph.
THESE is at present under construc
tion an electric machine which will be
used on the elevated stations for sell
ing tickets. The machine referred to
is to be constructed in such a way that
when you drop your nickel in the slot
you will receive a ticket in exchange.
There will be four of these on each of
the larger stations. The reason why
this system has been adopted by the
railroad trustees Is to do away with
the expense of having an agent on
each station.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, has an electric
tramway, the power for which is de
rived from a hydraulic plant operated
by two horizontal turbines, directly
connected to two three-phase alterna
tors of 360 horse-power each, generat
ing current at 550 volts. This pres
sure, by means of transformers, is
stepped up to 14,000 volts and the cur
rent thus transmitted to a substation
SI miles distant. Here it is transform
ed down to 350 volts and converted in
to continuous current by two syn
chronous converters.
GRANITE is not considered to be an
insulator, but one of the electrical
journals reports that insulators are
made as follows: Maine granite is
crushed and molded: into form and
fused at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It
resists all but hydrofluoric acid, and
does not crush at a lower pressure
than 14,500 pounds per square inch and
gives a tensile strength of 480 pounds
per square inch 56,600 volts were re
quired to pierce one-quarter of an inch
of this material in the shape of cup
insulators.
ERNEST BAUEB, an extensive poultry
raiser of Coffeyville, Kan., having read
in an agricultural journal that boracic
acid would preserve chicken meat al
most indefinitely, assumed that the
chemical Bhould be mixed with the
feed of the fowls and given to them to
eat. He tried the experiment, with
the result that 762 of his 800 chickens
died within 24 hours. He sued the ed
itor of the paper, but the court held
that any man of ordinary intelligence
should have known better than to try
to preserve the flesh of living fowls by
means of chemicals.
JOHN H. PAGE, JB., who was recently
commissioned as a second lieutenant
in the 3d infantry, is the third of the

served in Cuba during the war, taking
part in the fighting about Santiago.
He was the last of the regular army
colonels to leave Cuba. His grand
father, John H. Page, was killed at the
battle of Palo Alto during the Mexican
war. For more than 50 years there has
always been a John H. Page among
the officers of the army.

Washington, Nov. 28.—Gen. Otis re
ports the situation in the Philippines
in the following dispatch to the war
department:
"Manila.. Nov. 27.—Steamer from San

insurgent government money
and other property captured by Lawton's
troops near Tayug on 25th. Wheaton's

five three-Inch muzzle-loading guns, 12
rifles, 12,000 rounds Maxim cartridges, 1,000
shrapnel, 800 pounds of powder and other
property, also 94 Spanish and seven Amer
ican prisoners. Bell, with Thirty-sixth
Infantry in pursuit and will march down

handled by MacArthur they have the
bulk of the Insurgent artillery all of
Which will be captured unless buried.

Young still in pursuit of Aguinaldo who
Is heading for Bangued a few miles east of
Vigan Young with cavalry and scouts is
followed by battalion Thirty-third and by
balance battalion Twenty-second two bat
talions Thirty-third en route for Vigan by
military post road. Yourg's reception by
Inhabitants enthusiastically they give all
aid possible. Aguinaldo has collected more'
than 1,000 of his troops at the north, prob
ably most will desert him. Number small
detachments Insurgent troops throughout
country north of Manila have' been cap
tured and inhabitants manifest gratitude
for deliverance. Indications are that in
surgent force south of Manila disintegrat
ing and troops going to their' homes. Re
ports from southern Islands favorable.
Last Force Scattered.
Manila, Nov. 29. Col. Bell has scat
tered the entire rebel force under Gen.
Alejandrino and all their artillery and
ammunition were captured. This de
feat scatters the last remaining organ
ized portion of Aguinaldo's army. Col.
Webb Hayes and 300 men of the Thirty
first volunteer infantry arrived on the
transport Manauense. The vessel was
struck by a severe storm after she left
Honolulu and narrowly escaped foun
dering with all on board.
Rebels May Give Up.
Manila, Dec. 1.—Insurgent leaders in
the northern portion of Luzon may
surrender to the Americans to-day.
Gen. Lawton, who is in Bambang, seven
miles from Bayombong, in the Cagayan
valley, has been in telegraphic com
munication with the insurgent com^
manders over the wires
which were still
in their possession. The leaders of the
rebels are considering the proposition
which Gen. Lawton has made by tele
graph for their surrender. He demands
an unconditional surrender, but prom
ises that the rebels will not be punished
for treason with the death penalty. It
is expected that the insurgents, who
realize that they can offer resistance
but a short time longer, will accept and
lay down their arms.
Location of Oar Forces.
Gen. MacArthur is now in Bayam
bang (or Bayamban) preparing to
sweep the country on both sides of
the Manila-Dagupan railroad. Gen.
Wheaton is at San Fabian and Gen.
Lawton at Tayug. The cordon from
Sat* Fabian to San Isidro covers all
the roads and occupies all the towns
on the line. The American policy is
to prevent any more insurgents es
caping to the north and- to force them
toward the country west of the rail
road.
Notable Prisoners.
Maj. Johnston, of Gen. MacArthur's
staff, brought here by special train.
Churibian, secretary of the treasury in
the so-called Filipino government, and
Mariana Lin Gap, a Chinese half
breed, director of railways and post of
fices, both of whom surrendered in
Bayambang, with their families and
servants. Their goods filled four cars.
Churibian maintained that civilians
were exempt from imprisonment, and
he was deeply chagrined when he
found himself placed incommunicado
with Bjiencamino.

several American and 70 Spanish pris
oners, and the garrison at Bayombong,
province of Nueva Vizcaya, to Lieut.
Monroe, with 50 men of the Fourth cav
alry.
Washington, Dec. 2.—Considerable
Interest is felt here in the news that the
insurgents at Bayombong have surren
dered, particularly as the number is
Baid to exceed that captured by the
United States troops at any one time.
Bayombong is the city to which Agui
naldo at one time contemplated retreat

capitat, after he was force.d to flee from
Tarlac,butthe American troops pressed
him so hard that he was unable to carry
out his intention.

^THB PENSIOH LAWS.
Secretary HllekMek
RcMMMBlatlMi-Ollicr fa- A
tracts (rant His Report.
Washington, Dec. 2.—The annual report
of Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock,
while summing up the work in all the bu
reaus, is of special interest by reason of
Its statements regarding pension policies.
At the close of the fiscal year there were
Ml,619 pensioners, a decrease of 2,195 dur
ing the year. The average annual value
of all pensions was (132.74. The Spanish
war prbbably will increase the pension roll
during the current fiscal year.
Secretary Hitchcock urges legislation to
definitely construe the act of June 27. 1890,
relating to widows' pensions. Regarding
this he says: "In order to more exactly de
fine the words 'means of support' I approve
the recommendation of the commissioner
of pensions that the act of June 27, 1890, be
so amended that a pensionable status be
granted to widows whose Income, lnde
'pendent of the proceeds of their dally labor,
is not in excess of 1250 per annum." The
report also recommends legislative author
ity for biennial examinations of pension
ers legislation prohibiting the payment of
"any compensation whatever to pension at
torneys and agents for any service in con
nection with any claim or proceeding un
der the pension laws, except such as may
within certain limits fixed by congress be
allowed by the commissioner of pensions
and paid from the pension money as now
provided with respect to 'claims for pen
sion," a,nd for the delivery free of any
part paid letter or packet addressed to pen
sion agencies.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899,
the public lands disposed of aggregated
9,182,413.16 acres.
The total cash receipts- during the year
amounted to $3 070,137.34, an increase of
$792,142.16.
The total area of public lands is approxi
mately fixed at 1,082,138,221 acres, of which
929,308,068 acres are undisposed of and 152,
380,153 acres have been reserved for va
rious purposes.
Excluding 5,320 Indians in New York and
62,500 embraced in the five civilized tribes,
the Indians number approximately 181,586,
as against 180,132 reported last year.
That railroad traffic has increased won
derfully In the. last two years Is shown by
the report. The increase in the net earn
ings for 1898 over 1S97 was $23,000,000 and in
1899 the increase was $9,000,000, being limited
only by the lack of cars to carry products.
MAKES HIS REPORT.
Comptroller Dawes Telia of Banks,
Banking Laira and De
poaita.
Washington, Nov. 28. Comptroller
Dawes' annual report for the year ended
October 31, 1899, has been prepared for
transmission to congress. With respect to
the condition of national banks during
the year, as shown by the five reports re
quired from the banks, the comptroller
says:
"The number of banks in operation on
September 7, 1899, was 3,595, with a paid-in
capital of $005,772,970. The Individual de
posits on that date amounted to $2,450,
725,595.31, and the aggregate resources to
$4,650,355,133.44.. A comparison of the Sep
tember 7 returns with those made on Sep
tember 20, 1898, indicates an Increase dur
ing the year in individual deposits of $419,
271,055.02 in loans and discounts of $340,
789,623.20 in amounts due from other banks
and bankers, $160,391,896.68 in specie, $44,
697,225.44, and in aggregate resources, $646,
844,088.57. On September 7 the net deposit
liabilities of the national banks of the
country aggregated $3,031,463,016.68, on
which a reserve of $890,568,825.90, or 29.38 per
cent:, was held. The composition of this
reserve was as follows: Specie, $338,571,
383.83 legal tenders and United' States cer
tificates of deposit for legal tenders, $127,
754,651 due from reserve agents, $414,126,
660.44 redemption fund with the treasurer
of the United States. $10,116,130.63.*!
Among other recommendations, the comp
troller strongly urges laws authorizing the
incorporation of banks for the purpose of
carrying on international and intercolonial
banking as distinguished from domestic
banking. He. also recommends laws au
thorizing the establishment in small com
munities of national banks with a capital
of $25,000. He repeats his recommendation
of one year ago relative to a modification
of the law restricting loans to any one
individual to ten per cenit. of the capital
of a national bank, and advises the at
taching of a penalty for making excessive
loans after the present section is modi
fied.

Washington, Dec. 2.—The annual report.
of Elihu Root, secretary of war, was made
public Friday. The first half is devoted to
the operation of the army in the^Philip
pines, Cuba and Porto "Rico. The report
gives a full history of the military opera
tions in the Philippines from August 12»
1S98, up to the present time. An impor
tant feature of the report is a comprehen
sive outline of a plan of government for
Porto Rico. It is understood that Presi
dent McKinley is in entire accord with Sec
retary Root on this question, and that the
plan outlined by the secretary will be the*
identicahplan which the president will rec
ommend to congress in his annual message.
Government for Porto Rleo.
Concerning the plan of government pro
posed for Porto Rico, Secretary Root cites-,
the Paris treaty, which provides that con
gress shall determine the civil rights and
political status of the natives of the terri
tory ceded to this government. The scheme^
outlined includes a definite declaration by
congress of what American laws are to.b»
made applicable to the Porto Ricans, fol
lowing which it is recommended that a.
federal judiciary be established.
The form of insular government proposedt
provides for the appointment of a governor
by the president, to be confirmed by the
senate the chief officers of state customary
under our system, and a legislative council
to be compose^ of the chief officers of state
and a minority selected from the people or
the Island by the president. All acts of the
council are to be subject to the veto power
of the governor and to be passed over the
veto by a two-thirds vote. No law is to
become effective until it has remained with
out this approval for 30 days after its pres
entation to congress or the president. It la
suggested that voting right should be 11m
ited to those who read and write or who
own a small amount of property.
The secretary considers it too early toes
tabllsh a local legislature, giving the in
habitants the franchise only in municipal
affairs.
Abolition of the duties between the Unit
ed States and Porto Rico is recommended.
Mllltnry Operations.
The report cites in brief the history of the
military operations in the Philippines,.
Porto Rico and Cuba during the fiscal year
ended June 30,1899. Relief work in all three
places is dilated upon. The transport serv
ice, it is stated, includes SI steam trans
ports', with a saving in work done over or
dinary commercial rates of IS01.000. The re
moval of the dead from Cuba and simllaf
work contemplated from the*Philippines 1*
touched upon.
Favors Larirer Army.
An increased and reorganized regular
army, with many new and novel features
in the system involved, Is earnestly recom
mended. Radical changes, which contem
plate the betterment of the service in.'
every department are proposed. The
changes in the army organization and the
Increase proposed are in the first Instance
specified particularly, while in the second
no definite statement is made except as
to artillery. The present artillery force ist
recommended to be increased five times its
present strength. The increase in officers^
and enlisted men is to be sufficient to man
the equipment in the seacoast fortifica
tions, besides providing for the other
branches of the service.
A War College.
In order that there may be a more gen
eral dispensation of military knowledge to
officers both of the regular army and the*
national guards, the latter of whom It is.
intended to bring into closer touch with
the federal authorities, it is also proposed
to establish a war college. This institu
tion is to be in charge of a staff headed by
the major general commanding. Experts.
are to be detailed for such service for
stated periods. Likewise staff appoint
ments are to run for a specified time, after
which the officer whose term of service as:
such appointee expires must serve one year
in the line before being eligible for stalT
selection.
He points to the bravery displayed by the
regular army officers during the late war
with Spain and the insurrection In the
Philippines, and insists the people have
very thoroughly learned that an army of
fleer, when he becomes such, does not cease
to be an American citizen.
The secretary recommends the enlarge
ment of West Point military academy and
an increase in the number of cadets to be
admitted annually. Especial attention is
to be paid to the artillery branch of the
service in that Institution and in the army.
A ranking officer of artillery is recommend
ed, there being no such officer now.
Deaths In the Army.
The regular army now numbers 61,999 en
listed men and 2,248 officers, maklng a total
of 64,247, and a volunteer force numbering
30,050 enlisted men and 1,524
officers, making
a total of 34,574. The deaths from all causes,
including casualties in action, for the 14
months from May, 1898, to June, .1899, in
clusive, were 6,619. The deaths from disease
from all causes were at an annual deatte
rate of but 25.68 per thousand.

the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, are as
follows:
Civil establishment ...$1,967,7»

academy 87.015,29
