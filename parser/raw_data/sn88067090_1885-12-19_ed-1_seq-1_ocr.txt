Mr. 11. M. Lester and Miss Mollie

at Trinity Church, in that city, on
Wednesday evening of last week by
Rev. W. C. McCracken.
President Cleveland proposes to
provide an office for Mr, Hendricks'
private secretary which will be fully
as remunerative as the One which the
death of the Vice-President compels
him to resign.

Cdpt. B. F. Jones is receiving most
favorable mention by a number of
our exchanges for the position of
Hergeant-at-Arms in the next House,
(.'apt. Jones has heretofore filled this
position with high credit both to him
self arid his party.
An exchange says that Secretary
Lamar was recently mistook by a
drunken man for Ben. Butler. The
editor who hdd cheek enough to iitake
such an assertion will die within less
than a fortnight with a disease known
iis enlargement of the gall.
As has been the custom with that

Some few of our State exchanges
Whose editors are professed Christian
gentlemen holding membership in
their respective churches,are making
war upon the Rev. 8am. Jones. This
looks a little miraculous to us. But
perhaps we aro unacquainted with
the facts that prompt our brethren to
such actions. How is tliis ? Will
someone please rise and explain?

We have been greatly amused with
in the past ten days to notice the
comments upon President Cleve
land's message to Congress, made by
various country newspapers through
out this as well as other States, No
doubt these eminentquill-drivers had
become so addicted to criticising the
President's message udder the long
lease of Republican rule that they
found It impossible to depart from
their former ways, notwithstanding
we now have a Democrat in the chief
executive chair who is u man after
his own ideas and who is In sympa
thy with the interests of the people,
Our confidence in Mr. Cleveland as a
man, a statesman and an executive
officer compels us to admit that he
knows his own business better than
wo do, or better than any out-sider
knows it, and that he is equal to any
emergency that may arise. We are
satisfied that he lias made a thorough
study of all the important national
questions set out in his message, and
this being the case, coupled with his
acknowledged ubility and large brain,
he is more apt to view these subjects
in their proper light than anyone
else. In ancient times each man
knew more about his own business
than anyone else, but in these days
of modern civilization it is in most
cases just tile reverse.
Tho Boy.
See that he always lias somettiing
to occupy liis head and hands. Study
liiH "bent," and keep hi in going in
that direction. He must be a bad
boy who cannot be managed in this
way. Idleness is tlie curse of boy
hood as well as manhood. Few men
who recall their own early experien
ces will fail to confirm tliis statement.
The days in which they had nothing
to do, when they wandered aimlessly
about, a feeling of discontent filled
their hearts, have left impressions
never to be efl'aced. Then bad liahits
were formed—habits of indolence, if
not of \ ieiousnoss.thc effects of which
after years of earnest work have not
corrected. Many a man can trace his
ruin to those idle hours. They are
tlie greatest danger of our boys. They
lead to loafing, bad company,
vices, drinking saloons, gambling
dens, and, at last, to death. They
must he avoided. Otherwise wc can
not hope to save the youth. Country j
lads are not exposed to so great dan-1
gers at this point. They usually find
an abundance of honest and health
ful work to keep them busy. Hence,
country boy» do best. The evil falls
heaviest on those in towns and cities.

Their fathers are often professional
men or laboring men who have no
employment for their sons, or men
engaged in such business that they
cannot readily use the odd hours
which Innig so heavily on the hands
of the boys. How to supply fills lack

A California editor says : Upon t his
story we confidently defy the united
genius of tho ngaregsted press of the
East. A small boy in Quincy,in this
State, went up the mountain side full
of pleasure at the first fall of snow.
At the summit lie slipped and rolled
down tho hill, becoming the nucleus
of a vast showhall which hopelossly
imprisoned hint, lie was.missed nf
ter several hours, und tho searchers j

they could see It lodged in the boughs
of a pine tree. They finally got it,

As the holidays approach the <juau
tity of liquors brought to our pn^ty

gets his little jug and is content.
[while the leading "prolii gets his

saloons arc closed, and the town
sliutteth oft from its revenue, but:
that is all, the liquor gets here all the
same, and we Godforsaken adv
of w hisky, are not the only ones to
get it either. This may cause the
hair to stand straight upon its end on
the heads of some of our "prohi"
a friends, and doubtless some of them
would like to put their prohibition
heel upon our neck and crush us out
of existence for telling the truth,
But we are not ashamed of it. And

We it ave frequently seen state
ments in our exchanges to this effect
but we had hoped and believed lhat
they were untrue. Winona claimed
to be a prohibition town, and for the
peace and well-being of lier people, if
for no other reason, we hated to be
lieve otherwise, but now the authori

Kitchen Experiments.
Ho much is said in these times
about the adulterations of food, that
any simple experiment that can he
tried by tlie mistress of the home is
welcomed. Flour, we are toid, is to
an alarming extent adulterated with
alum. The following test «ill al

tion of adulterated Hour being placed
in a small quantity of clilorform, the
Hour floats, while the alum or other
mineral matter sinks to tlie bottom,
j so, also, in a similar way, alum in
bread may be instantly detected by
placing a small piece of tlie ^inspected
loaf in a solution of logwood and am
luonia, the broad turning blue if any
alum be contained ill it.. Few house
keepers know how the use of am
monia lightens the work in the kitch
en. D is cheaper than soap, and
cleans every thing it touches. A New
England housewife, says:
