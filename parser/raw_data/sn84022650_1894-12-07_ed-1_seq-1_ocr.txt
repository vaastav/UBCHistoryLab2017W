WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 The presi
dent today sent bis annual message
to congress. The message treats at
length of the relations of the United
States with foreign nations, and says:
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
"Our peaceful relations with them at
this time demonstrate the advantage
of consistently adhering to a firm but
just foreign policy, free from envi
ous or ambitious national schemes,
and characterized by entire honesty
and sincerity. A gratifying recogni
tion of the uniform impartiality of
this country towards all foreign states
was manifested by the coincident re
quest of the Chinese and Japanese
governments that the agents of the
United States should, within proper
limit, afford protection to the subjects
of these nations, pending the sus
pension of diplomatic relations during
the state of war. This delicate office
was accepted .and a misapprehension,
which gave rise to the belief that In
affording this kindly, unofficial pro
tection, our agents would exercise the
same .authority which the withdrawn
agents of the belligerents had exer
cised, was promptly corrected.
Although the war between China
and Japan endangeres r.o policy of
the United States, it deserves our
gravest consideration by reason of its
disturbance of our growing commer
cial interests in the two countries, and
the increased dangers which may re
sult to our citizens domiciled or so
journing in the interior of- China-
Acting under certain stipulations in
our treaty with Korea (the first con
cluded with a western power), I felt
constrained at the beginning of the
controversy to tender our good offices
to Induce an amicable arrangement of
the Initial difficulties growing out of
the Japanese demands for administra
tive reforms In Korea, but the unhap
py precipitation .of actual hostilities
defeated this kindly purpose.
Deploring the destructive war be
tween the two most powerful of the
Eastern nations and anxious that our
commercial interests in thi3 coun
tries may be preserved, and that the
safety of our citizens there shall not
be Jeopardized, I would not hesitate
to heed any intimation that our

HAWAIIAN MATTERS.
Of the Hawaiian question the pres
Ident says: Since communicating the
voluminous correspondence in regard
to Hawaii and the ' action taken by
the senate and house of representa
tives on certain questions submitted
to the "Judgment and. wider discretion
of congiies, thp organization of a

arrangement which followed the depb
sitlon of the queen, has been an

operation. The recognition usual in
such cases has been accorded the new
government
REVENUES REPORTED.
Continuing, the message says: The
secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government, from
all sources of revenue during the
hscal year ending June 30, 1894,
amounted to $372,802,498.29 and its
s expenditures to $442,605,758.87, leav
; ing a deficit of $69,803,200.58. There
; was a decrease of $15,9c2,674.66 In
; the ordinary expenses of the govern
n rent as compared with the fiscal
year 93.
The value of our total dutiable im
ports amounted to $275,199,036, being
$116,G57,!25 less than during the pre
ceding year and the importations, free
of duty, arnounttHl to ; $379,795,536,
being $64,748,675 less than during the
preceding year. Our exports of mer
chandise, domestic and foreign,
amounted during the year, to $892,
140,572, being an increase over the
preceding1 year of $44,495,378. The
total amount of gold exported during
the fiscal year was $76,898,061, as
against $108,680,444 during the fiscal
year 1891'.. The amount imported was
$72,449,119 as against $1,174,381 dur
ing ihe previous fiscal year 1893.
The imports of silver were $13,286.
522 aid the exports were $50,451,265.
The total bounty paid upon the pro
duction of sugar in the United States
fr.r the fiscal year was 12,100,208.
It is estimated that upon the basis
of our present revenue laws, the re
ceipts of the govemmtnt during the
current fiscal year ending ne 30,
1895 will be- $424,427,740 and its . cx
oendltures $444,427,728, resulting In
a deficit of $20,000,000.
On the first day of November, 1894,
the total stock of money, of all kinds,
in the country was $2,240,773 888 as
against $2,204,651,000 on the first of
November 1893, and the money of all
kinds In circulation, not included in
treasury holdings, was $1,672,093,422.
or $24.73 per capita upon an esti
mated population of $68,887,000.
, THE ARMY SERVICE.
. Speaking of the army, the president
says: While no considerable increase
in the army Is, in my judgment de
manded by recent events, the policy
of sea coast fortifications in prosecu
tion of which we have been steadily
engaged for some years, has so far
developed as ' to suggest that the ef
fective strength of the army be now
made, at least equal to its
lejial strength. It is hardly
tecessary to . recall the fact
that, in obedience to the com
mands of the constitution and the
Laws, and for the purpose of protect
ing the property of the United States,
aiding . the process of the federal
courts and removing lawless obstruc
tions to the performance by. the gov
ernment of its legitimate functions,
it became necessary in various locali
ties during the year to employ a con
siderable portion of the regular troops.
The duty was discharged promptly
courageously, and with marked dis
cretion by the officers and men, and
the the most . gratifying proof was
thus afforded that the arms' deserves
that complete confidence In Its effi
ciency and discipline, which the coun
try has at all times manifested.
Referring to the natioral guard, the
president says the reports of militia
inspections by regular army officers
show a marked increase in interest
and efficiency in state organizations
and strongly recommends a continu
ance of the policy of affording every
practical encouragement possible to
this important auxiliary of our mili
tary establishment In regard to the
distinguished military service . of
Major-General Schofield,. commanding
the army, the president .says it is sug
gested to congress that the temporary
revival of the grade of - lieutenant
general in his behalf would be a just
and gracious act and would permit
his retirement now near at hand,
with a rank befitting Tils merits.
UNION PACIFIC AFFAIRS.
Another subject of pressing moment,
says the president referrd to him by
the attorney-general, is the re-organization
of the Union Pacific railway
company on a basis equitable as re
gards all private interest and as fa
vorable to the government as existing
conditions vill permit The operation
of a railroad by a court through a
receiver is an anamolous state of
things which should be terminated on
all grounds, public and private, at the
earliest possible moment Besides, not
to enact the neeMod enabling legisla
tion at the present session postpones
the whole matter until the assembling
of a new. congress and ir.e.vitably in
creases all the complications of the
situation, and could not but be re
garded as a signal failure to solve a
problem which has practically been
before the present congress ever since
its organization.
FEDERAL PRISON3.
The president renews his recom
mendation for ' the location and con
struction of two prisons for the con
finement of United States prisoners.
THAT P. O. DEFICIENCY.
To obviate the difficiency existing
in the . - poetoffice ' a ppropriation the
present rate should be- raised on second-class
matter. Existing terms
from time to time, have admitted to
the privileges intended for legitimate
newspapers and pe--?odicals, a sur
prising range of publications and cre
a;ted abuses, the cost of which amonnt
in the aggregate to the total deficiency
of the postoffice department Pre
tended newspapers are started by
.business houses for the mere purpose
of advertising goods, complying with
! the law in form only, and dlscontinu-
- inff the publications as soon as the
period of advertising is overk Paper

required to pay eight times that
amount in sending their publications,
An abuse consists of the free caiTiage
through the mails of hundreds of tons
of seed and grain, uselessly distrib-
uted through the department of agri-
culture. The postmaster-general pre-
diets that if the law be so amended as
to eradicate these abuses, not only
will the postoffice department not
show a deficiency, but he believes that
in the near future all legitimate news- under present conditions by which
papers lend periodical magazines will this reserve, when dangerously de
be properly transmitted through the . plered, can be replenished is through
mails to ' their
subscribers free of
cost
PENSIONS, ETC.
The president agrees with " the attorney-general
that an ' additional
judge of the circuit court of appeals
in each circuit would greatly strength
en that court He also favors the
construction of additional battleships
and torpedo boats for the navy.
The subject of pensions is tieated at
considerable length and among other
things, he says: At the close of the
last ureal year, on. the 30th day of
June, 1894, there were 969,544 persons
on our pension rolls, being a net in
crease of 3,a32 over the number re
ported at, the end of the previous
year. The commissioner of pensions
is of the opinion that the year 1895,
being the thirtieth after the close of
the war of the rebellion, must accord
ing to all sensible, human calculation.
seen the highest limit of the pension
roll and that after ttiat year it must
begin to decline. The names dropped
from the rolls for all causes during
the year numbered 37.951. Amonir
our pensioners are nine widows, and
thjree daughters of soldiers of the
revolutionary war, and forty-five sur
vivors of the war of 1812. "
The accusation that an effort to de
tect pension frauds Is evidence of un
friendliness towards out worthy vet
erans and . a denial of their claim to
the generosity of the government sug
gests an unfortunate indifference to
the commission of an offese which has
for its motive' the securing of a pen
sion, and indicates an i.nwillingness.
blind to the existence of mean and
treacherous crimt-s, which play upon
demagogic fears, and nrake sport of
the patriotic impulse of a grateful
people.
AGRICULTURAL.
A large portion of the. message is
devoted to lhe report of the swretary
of agriculture, which deals extensive
ly with exports of live stock from this
country and the inspection of meats.
There was a fall'ng off in American
exiwrts of wheat of 13,500,000 bushels,
and the secretary is inclined to be
lieve that wheat may not, in the fu
ture, be the staple export cereal pro
duct of our country, but that corn
will continue to advance In impor
tance as an exportation on account of
Cie new uses to which it is constant
ly appropriated.
The exports of agricultural products
from the United States for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1894. amounted
to $628,3S3.033, being 72.28 per cent
of American exports of tvery descrip
tion and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain took more than 54 per
cent of all farm products finding for
eign markets.
THE TARIFF.
The tariff act passed at the last
session of j congress needs important
amendments if it is to be executed
effectively and with certainty.
In addition to such ' necessary
amendments as will not change the
rates of duty, I am still very decided
ly in favor of putting coal and iron
upon the free list and so far as the
sugar schedule is concerned, I would
be glad under existing aggravations
to see every particle of differential
duty in favor of refined sugar strick
en out of our tariff laws. If, with all
these favors now accorded the sugar
refining interest in our tariff laws, it
still languishes to the extent of clos
ing refineries and thousands of dis
charged workmen. It would seem to
present a hopeless case for reasonable
legislation.
Whatave.- else is done or omitted, I
earnestly repeat my r--cor- mei dation,
that additional duty of one-tenth
of a cent per pound laid upon sugar
imported from countries raying a
bounty mi its exports, be abrogated.
It seems to me that exceedingly im
portant considerations point to the
propriety of this amei dment With
the advent of a new tariff policy, not
only calculated to relieve the con
sumers of our land in the cost of
their daily life, but to invite a better
development of -Americin thrift and
create for us closer and more profita
ble commercial relations with the rest
of the world, it follows as a logical j
and imperative necessity that we
should at once remove the chief, if
not the only obstacle, which, so long
prevented our participation in the for
eign carrying of trade of the sea.
The ancient provision of our law.
denying American reglstery to ships
built abroad and owned by Americans
appears in the light of present cond'
tions, not only to be a failure for good
at every point, but to be nearer a
relic of barbarism than anything that
exists under the permission of a stat
ute of the United States. I earnestly
recommend its prompt repeal.
SOME BY-COMMENTS.
A vast majority of the voters of the
land, siiys the president are ready to
ins'st that the time and attention of
those tlivy sch-et to perform for- them
important public duties, should not be
distracted by doling out minor offices
and fhey are growing to be unanimous
in regard to party organization as
something that should be used In es
tablishing party principles, instead of
dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards for partisan activity.-
.
Nuruer.vis additional offices and
places have lately been brought with
in the civil service rules and regula
tions and some others will probably
soon be included. - -
The president recommends the estab-

and speaking of the strike commission
says: Their work has been well done
and their standing and intelligence

Sons . they make are worthy of

careful consideration..
. BLUEFIELD'S INCIDENT.
, ZZ, w; ;.;,;; i.
Referring to the Ulueneias incident
Nicaraguan authorities having given
notice of the forfeiture of concession
to the canal company, on grounds
purely technical and not embraced in
the contract have receded from that
position.
BONDS AND I4CE. '
Referring to the recent bond issue,
the president says, that it is perfectly
: and palpably plain that- the only way
the Issue and sale of the bonds of the
government for gold, and yet congress
has not only thus far declined to au
thorize the Issue of bonds best suited
to such a purpose, but there seems a
disposition in some quarters to denv
both the necessity and power for the
issue of bonds at all. I cannot for a
moment believe that any of our cit
lzeus are deliberately willing that
their government should default in
its pi-c.iniary obligations or that Its
huancial operat'ons should be reduced
to a silver basis. At auy rate, I
should not feel that my duty was done
u i omitted any effort I could make
to avert such a calamity. As long
tnererore, as no provision is made fof
the final redemption, or the putting
aside for currency obligation 5. now
used to repeatedly and . constantly
draw from the government its gold
and as long as no ' better authority for
bond Issues Is allowed than at present
exists, such authority will be utilized
whenever and as often as becomes
necessary to maintain a sufficient gold
reserve and abundant means to save
the credit of our country and make
good the financial declarations of our
government
Concluding, the president says, in
reference to the unsatisfactory feat
rres of our bank and currency sys
tem: 'liie absolute divorcement of the
government from the business of
banking is the ideal relationship of
the government to the circulation of the
currency of the country. This condi
tion rannot be immediately reached,
but as a step in that direction, as a
means of seenring more clastic cur
rency and obviating other objections
to the presMil arrangement of bank
circnVirion, the secretary of the treas
ury presents In his report, a sclieme
modifying the present backing laws
and providing for the Issue of clrcu-
?;ltinjr nrte hv mtJirp hnnlrfs fr frnm
at ion, under certain limitations.
The secretary explains his plan so
plainly and Its advantages developed
by him with such remarkable clear
ness that auy effort on my part to
present an argument in its support
would be superfluous. I shall there
fore content myself with an unquali
fied lndorsenwnt of the secretaryls
proposed changes in the law and
brief and imferfect statement of their
prominent features.
It Is proposed to. repeal all laws
providing for the deposit of United
(states bonds as security for circula
tion; to permit rational banks to issue
circulating notes not exceeding In
imount 75 per cent of tlxjdr paid up
and unimpaired capital, provided
they deposit with the government as
a guarantee furd in United States le
gal tender notes, including treasury
notes of 1890, a sum of equal amount
to 30 per cent of notes they desire to
issue; this deposit to be maintained
at all times, but whenever any bank
retires any part of its circulation a
proportionate part of its guarantee
fund shall be returned to it to per
mit the secretary of the treasury to 1
prepare and kesp on hand, ready for
Issue in case an increase in circula
tion is desired, blank national bank
notes for each bank having circula
tion, and to repeal those provisions of
the present law Imposing limitations
and restrictions thus permitting such
m crease or reduction within the limit
quickly made as emergencies may
arise.
In addition to the guarantee fund
reguired, it is proposed to provide a
3afety fund for the Immediate re
demption of the circulating notes of
failed banks by imposing a small an-
innl tax, say one bfclf of one per eent
.tpon the average circulation or eacn
bank until the fund amounts to five
per cent of the total circulation out
standing. When a bank fails its
guarantee fund is to be paid into this
safety fund and its notes are to be re
deemed, in the first instance, from
such safety fund thus augmented
Any impairment of such fund caused
thereby is to be made good from the
Immediate available cash assets of
said bank, and if these should be In
sufficient, such Impairment is to bo
made good by a pro rata assessment
among other banks, their contribu
tions copstitutins a first lien upon the
assets of the failed bank In favor of
the contributing banks. As a farther
security, it is contemplated that the
existing provisions fixing the individ
ual liabilities of stockholders Is to be
retained and the bank's Indebtedness
on account of its circulating notes is
to be made a first lien on all its as
sets. For the purpose of meeting the ex
pense of printing notes, official super
vision, cancellation and other like
charges, there shall be paid a tax, say
one half of one per cent per annum
on the average amount of notes In
circulation. It is farther provided
that there shall be no national bank
notes issued of less denomination than
ten dollars. Another very important
feature of this plan is the exemption
of state banks from taxation by the
United States in cases where it Is
shown to the satisfaction of the sec
rotary of the treasury and comptroller
of the currency by banks claiming
such exemption, that they have not
had outstanding of their circulating
notes exceeding seventy five per cent
of their paid up and unimpaired cap
ital; that their stockholders are in
dividually liable fpr the redemption
of their circulating notes to the full
extent of their ownership of stock;
that the liability of said' banks upon
their circulating notes constitutes,
under their state law, a first lien upon
their assets; that such banks have
, kePtajd maintained a guarantee fund
" 1 ""V""'
inoludmg United Statesreasury notes
J im equal to thirty per cent of
r Jll
and that such banks have promptly
redeemed their circulating notes when
presented at their principal or branch
offices.
V; V: m- ,..
may be usefully amended In some of
Its details, but I am satisfied it fur.
nishes a basis for very great improve
ment in our present banking and cur
rency system.
I conclude this communication, fully
appreciating that the responsibility
for all legislation affecting the people
or tne united States rests upon their
representatives in congress, and as
suring them, that whether done inac-
cordance with the recommendations 1
have made, or not I shall be glad to
co-operate m perfecting any legisla
tion that tends to the prosperity and
weuare or our country.
ARMENIAN REFUGEES.
(Copyrighted 1S94 by the Associatetd
rress.)
Athens, Dec. 3. The Associated
Press exclusively has been able to
give the world the facts of the terrible
atrocities perpetrated unon the Ar
menlan Christians in Asia Minor, and
today a representative of the Asso
ciated Press succeded In securing ad
ditional information confirming the
previous statements made. The repre
sentative today met twenty Armen
ian refugees who arrived here from
Armenia after a journey full of hard
ships and suflerinsr. This nartv of
Armenians is the first that has escaped
from the districts where the massacres
occurred and it is believed that even
worse remains to be told as to the
horrors described, Avhich are under
stood to have lasted for a lone time
after this party left
Further atrocities were committed
by the Turks at the village of Kelie
heusen. Before dawn this place was
surrounded by soldiers and while the
iniiabitants were still asleep it was set
on fire. Brutal soldiers entered the
residence of. a man named Araket,
who was asleep with his wife, and
tortured them both In a horrible man
ner with red hot Irons. At this vil
lage the soldiers killed an Armenian
priest Margosa, with twenty other In
mates of the house. They were burned
to death. The chief of the village
of Cheneg was captured by soldiers
and bound to his two daughters. All
three were then scalded to death with
boiling water. A detachment- of
twenty-five regulars of the Turkish cav
alry after comlmitting inexpressible
horrors at the village of Sebghank,
went to the village school and rav
ished the girls found there and then
devastated the building.
Ibo Brl, a notorious Kurd brigand.
went with a detachment of the Turk

OCEAN VESSEL STRUCK.
LONDON, Dec. 3. The steamer Al-
bertine from Shields, to this port ar
rived at Yarmouth today with her
bows completely stove in and leaking
badly. Her commander reported she
was in a collision yesterday with a
large paKfcenger steamer. The Al-
bertlne struck the steamer amidships
and the latter disappeared in the fog.
The Albertine returned to the point
where the collision occurred but no
trace of the steamer could be found
and it Is supposed she foundered.
The steamer which was sunk by
the Albertine proves to have been the
Kemtmore of Dundee, which was pre
viously reported to have been sunk
by the steamer Cymballne off South
wold. None of her crew were lost

BUCKING THE SPORTS.
Pendleton. Or.. Dec. 4. There
is
promise that a movement may be in
augurated for the enforcement of the
law against gambling. The immediate
cause for arousing public interest Is
the case of J. M. Johnson, who made
complaint that he was robbed on Sat
urday night in a 63loou of about one
hundred dollars. The money was
really lost in a faro game. Citizens
are taking steps to close all gambling
games. .

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The demo

hours in caucus today and then ad-'
journed, without taking any, action,
to meet Thursday next Tue entire
time was devoted to a discission of
the situation and as to the wisest
course of action for the democratic
party to pursue during the present
session. v
The entire discussion was based on
a series of resolutions, presented by
Senator Daniel, declaring for the clo
ture, committing the party to an
abondonment of all efforts to amend
the tarifl law, and to an effort to re
form the currency in accordance with

KOLB'S WILD MESSAGE.
Birmingham, Dec. 4. R. ,F. Kolb,
who claims to be the governor of Ala
bama, today completed his message
to the legislature, which he signs as
governor and which will be trans
mitted to that body tomorrow. The
message is als3 addressed to -the peo
ple of Alabama and is a long and in
many respeafcj a revolutionary docu
ment as it recommends that bis fol
lowers do not pay their taxes for tt
while. ,
He farther says: "I farther ad
vise those collectors who value the
cause I represent and which will as
suredly prevail, to delay all payments
of state taxes into the treasury until
an impartial hearing has been had of
our complaint under a fair and honest
contest at law."
When it is remembered that the tax
collectors in thirty-eight out of sixty -
counties in the state are Koibites, it
will be seen that if they take his ad
vice the Kolb government will find
strong support and that Alabama is
threatened with anarchy. In his mes
sage Kolb says:
"The revolutionary conditions of our
state government must be the subject
of your con tinned and most anxious
contemplation. The plans of the
usurpers, so alarming to you, are abat
ing in nothing to reduce you to ab
ject and final submission to their un
bridled will and passions."
PITIFUL DRIVEL.
Columbia, S. C, Dec. 4. Benjamin
Ryan Tillman is no longer governor
of South Carolina. At 1:30 p. m. to
day he was succeeded by his chief
lieutenant, John Gary Evans. Several
thousand people assembled in the hall
of the house of representatives to wit
ness the; ceremony of Inauguration. A'
the inaugural procession entered the
band played "Hall to the Chief." The
oath of office was administered to Gov
ernor Evans by Chief Justice McCuer.
Gov. Evans said:
"Gentlemen of the general assembly:
After obtaining the will of the people
In three separate elections, I am here
today :to assume the governorship of
the proudest state on the globe. Thir
ty years ago the election of a man of
my age to the highest honor in 'the
gift of the people would have been
called unconstitutional. A young man
In South Carolina would not have
dared to have aspired to this honor
for fear of gaining the odium of the
class who by reason of age or inheri
tance considered office as their par
ticular property without regard to
popular will.
It is unfortunate that the foundation
of our social and political institutions
is unity of the white people. This
condition was thrust upon us 'by the
emaucipaton and enfranchisement wltb
one stroke of an unfortunate, ignorant,
unfit-to-govern race of slaves, placed
In power by the bayonet forced to
govern their former masters.
We are fast coming to the plight
which Ireland is in. Our great plan
tations are becoming merely hunting
reserves of the wealthy; and the la
borer year by- year is being ground
to poverty and servitude. Th party
that was true to us is the party we
look to in the future, though It has
suffered defeat from one extreme of
land to the other and today not a
democratic state is left north of the
Mason and Dixon line. South Caro

political reform and it remains for us
to set the pace for the nation which
I will ultimately bring relief to the en-
