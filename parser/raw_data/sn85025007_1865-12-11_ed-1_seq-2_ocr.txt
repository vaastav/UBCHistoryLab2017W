The National Intelligencer commenting on
the Republican Cauous resolutions, introduced
and passed ia theHouse of Representatives, and I
deprecating and condemning such action, says:'
"It is not the least singular feafcpean tbis Coc^
gressioaal proceeding, that the Souse has given
to the action of the oaueus the form of a joint
' resolution, so that, by a skin clause of the Constitution,
if it shall pass, it passes in the form
of a bill, of an act; and as such is subject to the
Executive veto. There is something more than
meets the eye in thus hastening, to ohallege an
issue between the -President and Congress."?
The Intelligencer asks, if it can be possible that
the Republicans in Congress intend to carry
out the programme implied by this joint resolution,
by inviting the exercise of the veto power,
and by so arraying themselves, Radicals and
so-called Conservatives, in solid column, that
they will be enabled to j>ass this joint resolution
over the objection of the President, if indeed
the President shall be thus offensively driven
to maintain the position which he has been
forced to assume, in obedience to his oath, in
reference to restoration, under the Constitution
and the laws?
The Richmond Sentinel says: "Hon. A. H.
H. Stuart not being allowed to take his seat in
Congress, as a representative from .Virginia,
has returned to his home. We understand
that all his colleagues will pursue a similar
course. It will meet the general approbation
of their constituents." . That is the proper
course. Return home, and wait patiently the
action of Congress, whatever it may be.
WASHINGTON NEWS,
The Republican members of the Senate last
week were in caucus upon the resolutions of
Mr. Thaddeus Stevens relating to reconstruction.
They are not likely to pass that body
without important amendments.
It is reported that prominent Republicans in
both Houses favor the admission of the Ten
ilCBSCC ucivgavivi'i
It is stated that the Illinois members urge
the donatio* of $100,000 to Mrs. Lincoln, and
that this amount will probably be recommended
by the select committee to whom this subject
was referred. ; ./
The constitutionality of the act of Congress
prescribing a test oath in the Federal courts, is
now before the Supreme Court, on the application
of A. H. Garland, of Arkansas, to be
admitted to practise without taking the oath.
Mr. Grarland was an attorney of the court before
the war, and has received a pardon from
* the President. The case has been set for argument,
Friday, theloth inst. It will be argued
by Mr. Garland himself, Reverdy Johnson and
Matt. H. Carpenter, of Wisconsin, on the one
side, and by the Attorney General, Mr. Speed,
on the other.
Horace Greeley, who is now in Washington,
has expressed himself substantially in aecord
with the President in his reconstruction policy
as announced in his message, and earnestly
deprecates any division of the majority of Congress.
Senor llomero, the Mexican Minister, yesterday
received intelligence from Mexico to the
effect that the French were retreating from
. Chihuahua upou Yera Cruz.
It is understood that General Butler is preparing
a reply to the censure cast upon him by
General Grant, and that it will soon be published.
Cotton.?This staple product of the 4'land
of flowers" continues to come in by the Virginia
and Tennessee railroad. Heavy shipments
are daily arriving. The Orange road is unable
to convey it away as rapidly as it conies in, and
immense piles of bales accumulate about the
depot The canal takes off apoition of this
class of freight, but not enough to relieve the
road. ' We understand that the Southside road
is rapidly pushing forward its preparations for
transporting freight, and will shortlv be in the
field with the rest of the lines.?[Lynchburg

The Augusta Telegraph says that Hon. E. M.
Bruce, formerly a member of the Confederate
Congress from Kentucky, now a banker and
cotton factor in Augusta, Ga., has sent to Gen.
John C. Breckinridge, now an exile from the
land of his birth, a check for one hundred tlious- |
and dollars. Mr. Bruce is understood to have
speculated largely and successful during the
last year of the Confederacy.
On Thursday the Free Will Baptist Church,
Chicago, was totally destroyed, onlv about one
hour after it had been dedicated. There were
several other fires during the day, but the
most extensive one happened about three
o'clock on Friday morning, by which five
houses were consumed, and about twenty
families rendered houseless, causing a loss of
about sixty thousand dollars. ;

The Accident on the Sooth Side R. R.
?A few days ago, we mentioned a late accident
on the South Side R. R. The Lynchburg
Virginian gives the following account of iti
"For some time past hands have been,
engaged in constructing a<; new bridge -at;
Robertson's mill, and had1 made .considerable
progress with .the work. Early in the evening:
of Thursday, it will be remembered, that the
wind was very high ; and between one and two:
o'clock two spans of the bridge, which bad
been put up, but had not been braced, were |
blown down, by a severe gust of wind, while i
the hands were at work upon them. The
crash ed .falling timbers, with men clinging to
them, orleapihg into the water far below, presented
an appalling scene. The bridge must
be some forty or fifty feet above the water.
We are gained to announce the immediate
death, by the catastrophe, of two persons and
the wounding of eighteen others. The killed
were Mr; Garrison, of Petersburg, the constructor
of the work, and a Mr. Barry. Mr.
Garrison, it seems, endeavored to leap to the
bank, a distance of forty feet, and was killed
.1. i tr.

this city while the Virginia and Tennessee
Railroad was in course of construction, upon
which work he was a contractor or engineer.
Among the wounded was Capt. Hannah, of
Appomattox, who received a fracture. Of the
wounded we iearn that most of their injuries
are slight, and will not, probably, result seriously
in any cases. It is almost miraculous
that any of them escaped death."
VIRGINIA ITEMS.
Gen. Lee's family have arrived in Lexington.
They have been living lately in Cumberland
county.
Last week, in Richmond, a case came up
before the Mayor, in which a white man was
charged with assault upon a negro, and all the
witnesses in the case were negroes. The question
arose at once whether the Court could accept
negro testimony. The Mayor, without
the least hesitation, decided that the laws of
Virginia did not admit of such testimony.?
He declined, therefore, to try the case.

In consequence of fears of negro outbreaks
entertained by some of the people of Virginia,
a proposition for the organization of the militia
has been submitted to the Legislature of the

The Baltimore Gazette says:?"The Report
of Lieutenant General Grant to the War Department,
concerning the operations of the
Federal armies after his appointment to* the
chief command, effectually plucks Major Gen.
Butler of his military feathers, and leaves him
as completely bare as a Shanghai chicken exposed
for sale in the market place. The thing
is done, too, with a coolness and insousiance
that is absolutely refreshing."
A dispatch from Wilmington, N. C., says:
"The civil authorities are enrolling home-guard
companies under an ordinance of the late convention.
They are also impressing the arms of
citizens. Their authority is questioned, and
appeals have been made to the military authorities.
General Crook withholds his decision
for the present. The reason assigned for the
enrolment is the fear of a negro insurrection,
of which, however, the dispatch says, there is
no danger."
The "Fenian .Senate" has deposed O'Mahoney,
the "President of the Brotherhood," for
"perfidy and malfeasance in office," and elected
another man in his nlace. The whole concern
seems to be in a "muss." O'Mahooey and his
friends denounce the "Senate."
The resignation of Gen. Butler has been
accepted by the President. There are thousands
upon thousands who will rejoice at this.
Mr. S. W. Glenn, recently manager of the
Norfolk Theatre, who a few days since became
the lessee of the Richmond Theatre, left Richmond
on Saturday last, to go to Petersburg for
some three thousand dollars, which was to be
paid as a part consideration for his future lease
of the Richmond establishment, and has not
since been heaid from. I is believed that lie
procured the money, and it is known that he
left Petersburg for Richmond on Sunday afternoon.

Dr. Hu = t< r. well known in this country

The last number of Mr. Bunnell's Southern
letters published in the National Intelligencer,
says:?*'A cause of Northern complaint seems
to be the result of the elections. The people,
it is said, should in all cases have chosen
those who can take an oath that they have in
<no respect 'sympathized with them in their
recept terrible trials. Perhaps so. Yet it is
natural that the people should prefer to repose
their trust in those who endured and perilled
so much for them. In doing this it by no
means follows that they mean or meditate disaffection
to the Government. They have chosen
such men to comply in good faith with
their oath of allegiance. They have trusted
them with their honor heretofere. Why, if the
Southern people keep their pledges, should,
they be reproached for the choioe of agents ?
Would it not be "simpler "to designate their
representatives than to disfranchise them for
the error of their selection ? Rely upon it,
though an unpalatable truth, the affections of
< 1
! this people can never be regained by suspicion
! and severity. Perhaps some may say it matters
not to regain the confidence or affection of
the people.. Their substance should be taken
to reward those who conquered them. Time
will show the proper course to have been pursued,
but magnanimity is ever wisdom."
Land agents here last week made sales of
12,280 acres of timbered land, in Rockingham
and Augusia counties. They sold 4.000 acres
of North Mountain land belonging to Messrs.
Click and Speck; 6,800 acres belonging to
Daniel Oupp ; and 1,380 acres known as "Union
Springe," belonging to Messrs. Allemong &
Mayers. This land has all leen sold to a
company of capitalists from Carlisle, Pa.
The Levant Herald notices the reappearance
i of cholera at Alexandria and at Trebizond after
having totally ceased. Other places are
afflicted in like manner. There is nonsuch
thing as buying exemption from cholera or
warding off its visitations, except in the observance
of wholesome sanitary laws.
After printing and issuing from the Treasury
Department at Washington many thousands
