and Senate.
MESSAGE IS HEARD.
The Beading Began at 1:35
This Afternoon.
Washington, Dec. 6. At noon today
the first regular session of the 55th
congress began. Simultaneously at
both ends of the capitol Speaker Reed
In the house and Vice President Hobart
in the senate called to order the re
spective bodies over which they pre
side. The weather was propitious. The
sun shone brilliantly from a cloudless
sky. The crowd swarmed into the cor
ridors at an early hour and choked the
marble steps as they ascended to the
galleries from which they were to view
the show.
The hall of the house of representa
tives before the hour of noon arrived,
was filled with jostling, moving- crowds
and before 11 o'clock the encircling gal
leries which overlooked the floor, were
black with peonle.
Chairman Hitt. of the foreign af
fairs committee and Chairman Walker,
of the banking and currency committee,
whose positions will probably bring
them much into the public eye during
the session, were early on the tioor,
mingling with their colleagues. The
floral tributes for the members were
numerous and in some instances impos
ing. One, which probably attracted
more attention than any other on ac
count of its unique character, graced
the desk of Gen. Orosvenor of Ohio. It
consisted of a huge tree of yellow
chrysanthemums, and American beauty
roses under the nodding branches of
which stood an innocent looking toy
lamb. It whs a tribute from the Na
tional Wool Growers' association. Some
one discovered that under the adminis
tration of pressure to a portion of the
lamb's anatomy it would give forth a
sound resemLuing a bleat and much
amusemt-nt and merriment followed
tnis disclosure.
The representation of a huge gavel in
red and white carnations, stood upon
the speaker's table. Anions others
who were remembered with floral of
ferings were General Wheeler of Ala
bama: Mr. I. verier, of West Virginia:
Mr. Dalzell. of Pennsylvania; Mr. C.
W. Stone, of Pennsylvania; Mr. Hen
derson, of Iowa; -Mr. Laeey. of Iowa,
and Mr. Dayton, of West Virginia.
At fifteen minutes lK?fore noon, the
floor was cleared of all persons except
members and orlicers. Soon afterward
Mr. Bailey of Texas, the leader of tne
minority and "Silver Dollar" Biand of
Missouri, entered the hall together. Mr.
Dinl-y, the floor leader of the house,
smiling and affubh as ever came in
just before the speaker appeared. As
th hands of the clock pointed to 12
o'clock. Speaker Iteed. attired in a
black cutaway coat and wearing a red
tie pushed through the green baise
doors from the lobby and ascended the
rostrum. One crack of the gavel sub
dued the din of the floor and the con
versation in the overhanging galleries.
The gavel with which trie speaker
called the house to order was presented
to him by J. C. Groener. sheriff of Knox
county. Tennessee, who sent it in the
name of the "Stalwart Republicans of
Kast Tennessee."
It was formally presented to the
speaker through H. Clay Evans, the
commissioner of pensions. The gave!
is mad- of apple tree wood, which grew
liesMie the log. house in which Farra
gut was born.
In the deep silence which followed
the calling of the assemblage to order,
ti e prayer of the eminent divine. Rev.
Charles A. Perry of Weaver Hampton,
iing., who delivered the invocation,
was solemn and impressive. The speak
er then immediately directed the clerk
to call the roll and this consumed a
half hour.
The roll call showed the presence of
SOI members. There were five vacan
cies from death or resignation during
the recess and the credentials of the
members elect were read by the direc
tion of the speaker who then adminis
tered the oath of office to them. Thev
were P. M. Uritth (Dem.), successor to
the late Judge liolman in the Fourth
Indiana district: H. S. Boutelle (Uep.),
of Chicago, who succeeded Edward IX
Cook, deceased; James Norton (Dem ).
of the Seventh South Carolina district
who succeeded John L. JleLaurin. now
a senator; George P. Iawrence (Rep.),
of the First Massachusetts, who suc
ceeded Ashley B. Wright, deceased,
and J. .". Griggs (Dem.). of the Tnird
Xew York district who succeeded
Francis II. Wilson, who resigned to ac
cept the position of Postmaster at
Brooklyn.
The Salter's credentials had not vet
arrived, but the oath was administered
to him by unanimous consent.
On motion of Mr. Hopkins (Ren., III.),
the clerk was directed to notify the
senate that the house was ready for
business and on motion of Mr, Dinglev.
the floor leader, a resolution was adopt
ed for the appointment of a committee
of three to join the committee of the
senate to wait on the president and in
form him that congress was ready to
receive any communication he des'ired
to make. The speaker selected Messrs
Dmg.ey Maine, Grosvenor. Ohio, and
Bailey, Texas, for this honor.
On motion of Mr. Henderson of Iowa
a member of the committee on rules the
rule at the extra session for three davs'
adjournments, was vacated and daily
sessions to begin at noon each day were
ordered. There being nothing to do but
await the reception of the president's
message, the house recessed until 120
p. m.
When the house reconvened at 1:40 p
m., the committee appointed to await
upon the president come down the cen
ter aisle and Mr. Dingley reported that
the committee had performed its mis
sion. "The president," said he, "was
pleased to send to the two houses his
respectful salutations and to inform
them that he would communicate in
writing."
Mr. Pruden who had followed the
committee into the hall immediately
presented the message of the president,
which by direction of Speaker Reed,
was read at the clerk's desk.
The message was listened to with
great earnestness, especially the por
tions dealing with the question of re
vising our currency legislation and
with our attitude toward Cuba. The
president's utterances on both subjects
seemed to impress the members deeply
but there was no demonstration of any
kind until the conclusion, when the
Republicans joined in a sharp round of
applause. The reading consumed an
hour and 20 minutes.
On motion of Mr. Dingley. the mes
sage was referred to the committee of
the whole and ordered printed.
Mr. Lawrence (Rep. Mass.), then of
ficially announced the death of his pre
decessor.the late Representative Wright
and Mr. Allen (Dem., Miss.), the death
of Senator" George. Out of respect to
their memories, the house then at 3:05
p. m., adjourned till tomorrow.
GORGEOUS FLORAL DISPLAY.
The Senate Chamber Made a Bower
of Beauty by Admirers of Senators.
"Washington. Dec.6. The senate cham
ber at the opening of the session today
was a veritable conservatory. The
floral display was unusually rich and
beautiful, and the odor of flowers was
heavy in the hall.
The Republican members were par
ticularly well remembered with floral
presents. One of the most notable of
the offerings both for size and beauty,
was that presented to Mr. Foraker, of
Ohio, a magnificent tree of American
beauty roses, set in a stand of ever
greens and ferns, from the senator's
"Republican friends Columbus, O."
Among the senators who received flow
ers were Mr. Butler (N. C), a horse
shoe of roses: Mr. Hansbrough, (N.
Dak.), a basket of roses and lilies; Mr.
Deboe, (.Kentucky), roses; Mr. Allison,
(Iowa), roses: Mr. Cannon, (Utah), a
bureh of handsome roses. Mr. Smith,
(New Jersey), American beauty roses
and chrysanthemums tied with pink
silk ribbons; Mr.McEnnery. Louisiana),
a iiandsome crescent of pink roses; Mr.

Mr. Nelson. (Minn.), chrysanthemums
and roses; Mr. Thurston, (Neb.), hand
some jar of roses and ferns; Mr. Mal
lory, (Florida), a stand of American
beauty and brides' roses.
Half an hour before the senate con
vened the public, and executive and
reserved balleries were filled with spec
tators to witness the opening of the
session. The handsome costumes of the
ladies added much to the "brightness of
the scene. Precisely at 12 o'clock the
gavel of Vice President Hobart fell
and the senate was called to order. The
invocation was delivered by Rev. W.
H. Milburn, the blind chaplain. He
made a beautiful and touching refer
ence to our "beloved president" who
awaited news from the bedside of the
mother to whoma he is devoted and
prayed that she might have a peaceful
passage to the ceiestial shore.
Seventy-seven senators responded to
their names on the roll call.
Mr. Morriil of Vermont was first rec
ognized by the vice president. He oi'fer
ed a resolution, which was passed in
the usual form, that the secretary in
form the house that the senate was in
session and ready to proceed to busi
ness. Mr. Allison (Icrtva) presented a reso
lution that a committee of two senators
be appointed to join a like committee
from the house to inform the president
that congress was in session and pre
pared to receive any communication
which he might desire to make to it.
The resolution was passed and the vice
president named Senators Allison and
C.orman (Maryland) as the senate com
mittee. By resolution of Mr. CuIIom (Illinois)
the time of daily meetings of the senate
was lixeil at 12 o'clock noon. On mo
tion of Mr. Hale, (Maine), a recess was
then taken until 1 o'clock.
At 1:30 the senate reconvened and
the committee consisting of Mr. Allison
and Mi'. Gorman reported through the
former. He said the committee with a
like committee of the house had waited
upon the president and informed him
that the two branches of congress were
in session and ready to receive from
him any message he might desire to
present to them. Mr. Allison reported
that the president had informed the
committee that he would immediately
communica te with congress in writing
and he expressed the hope that the de
liberations of congress might result in
great good to the country and reflect
honor upon itself.
The president's message was then
presented by Mr. Pruden, the presi
uent's assistant secretary and was at
1:35 laid before the senate and rea'd.
Senators pive the closest attention to
the reading of the message a majority
of them following it from printed cop
ies. That part of it which dealt with
the Cuban question and outlined the
policy of the administration with ref
erence to that question was listened to
with particular attention.
Tr.e reading of the message was con
cluded at 2:T'. The document v. as or
dered printed for the use of the senate.
Mr. Walthall (Miss.) was recognized
and announced the death of his col

Chicago's General Electric Co. Will
Continue at the Old Stand.
Chicago, Dec. 6. In the United States
circuit court today Judge Grosscup de
nied the motion of Charles A. Bales of
New "i ork, for the appointment of a re
ceiver for the General Eiectric Street
railway. Judge Grosscup however, or
dered that the books of the corporation
be brought into court. Judge Grosscup
also said that any attempt on the part
of the company to lurther dispose of
bonds during the pendency of the liti

immediate appointment of a receiver.
The General Klectrie comroany has an
underground electric franchise covering
several south side streets. Bales who
claims to be the owner of 2.000 shares of
stock charges that attempts were being
made to fraudulently deprive him and
othere stockholders of their stock.
TOO MUCH SAIL
Topeka lias a Police Depart
ment That is Illegal.
Judge Hazen so Decides inCourt
Today.
ONLY CITIES OF 40,000
Are Entitled to Police
geants and a Chief.
Ser
if the Supreme Court Upholds
Judge Hazen's Decision,,
Five Policemen Ktist Go and
Chief Drop His Title.
Judge Hazen played havoc with the
Topeka police force in a decision made
this morning in the case of D. M.Mitch
ell against the city of Topeka.
Mitchell was appointed sanitary ser
geant by the police commissioners and
the council refused to pay his salary on
the ground that the act did not author
ize the commissioners to appoint a san
itary sergeant in cities of less than 40,
C00 inhabitants.
The part of the law under which the
sanitary sergeant is appointed is also
the clause that authorizes the police
commissioners to appoint in addition to
the regular patrolmen, two sergeants,
two jailers, one patrol driver, one po
lice captain in addition to the regular
patrolmen.
Judge Hazen held that the law ap
plies to cities of 40,000 inhabitants, only
and that therefore the commissioners
not only cannot legally appoint a san
itary sergeant but they have no author
ity to appoint a police captain, ser
geants, jailers, or a patrol driver. In
short he held that Topeka is being gov
erned under the law which applies to
cities of 40. COO inhabitants.
The act under which Hazen says To
peka should be governed allows the po
lice commissioners to appoint a mar
shal and one patrolman for every 1.500
inhabitants and that is all. The jailers
and patrol drivers and other ofiicers
must be taken from that number.
There are now 25 policemen employed
excepting the chief of police and under
Judge Hazen's decision this number
must be reduced to 21. The sergeants
now receive $75 a month and they can
be only patrolmen whose pay cannot be
more than $o0 per month. The salary
of the jailers, patrol driver and detec
tives is now the same as those of the
reyular patrolmen so they are not af
fected. Rut hereafter thy must ap
pear on the rolls as patrolmen and the
commissioners will have to dispose of
five or six regular patrolmen.
W. R. Hazen, who is attorney for Mr.
Mitchell, said that he would at once
take the case to the supreme court.
This means that there will be no final
decision before April or May and mean
while the city council will probably re
fuse to pay any salaries which are not
provided for in the law which Judge
Hazen holds is applicable to Topeka.
This will mean a saving of $350 a month
to the city.
If the law were enforced absolutely to
the letter. Chief Steele must give up his
title of "chief of police" and become
Just a plain marshal. The decision will
affect other cities besides Topeka. There
is but one city in Kansas entitled to all
these officers for which Topeka has
been paying and this is Kansas City,
Kan., which is a larger aggregation of
people but not a city in the real sense
of the word, being only a suburb of
Kansas City. Mo., Leavenworth and
Wichita must also dispense with part
of their police forces if this decision is
upheld.
City Attorney "Bird said in discussing
the decision: "This is just in line with
my contention. I have thought for a
iong time that w-e have a police depart
ment which belongs to a city of 40.000
but the question was never before rais
ed. I firmly believe that is the law and
that Judge Hazen's decision wiil be
sustained in the supreme court."

STILL LOOKING FOR 1US.
Preacher Morrison Wrote Ths.t He
wa3 Going to Commit Suicide.
Chief Steele thinks he has the Rev.
G. E. Morrison, of Panhandle. Texas,
located. lie has sent a special officer
to Illinois to capture the preacher who
is suspected of having poisoned his wife
October 8, last. Morrison wrote a let
ter from his hiding place to Sheriff
Holland at Panhandle, telling him that
he was innocent of the crime but that
he could not stand the disgrace and
that he would commit suicide. He ask
ed that the coroner's jury return a ver
dict of vindication over his dead body.
Put the Texas preacher has not sui
cided: at any rate his "dead body" has
not been found. Yesterday Chief Steele
sent John Haisch to capture Morrison.
There is a reward of $300 for his cap
ture offered by Govenor Culbertson. of
Texas. Sheriff Holland was a personal
friend of Morrison and it was only after
the coroner had demanded that Morri
son be arrested, that the sheriff moved
in the matter.

LODGE OF SORROW.
Elk3 Taka an Afternoon to Talk and
Think on Serious Subjects.
Following the custom of all Benevo
lent Elks the Topeka lodge yesterday
held memorial services in memory of
the departed brothers. A large marble
tablet on the wall of the lodge room
contains the names of all the members
for whom this service was held. The
service was conducted by Exalted
Ruler Chase. A quartette sang "Rock
of Ages," "Nearer My God to Thee"
and "Lead Kindly Light." Aaron Jet
more spoke of the good accomplished
by the departed brothers during their
life. Among other things Mr. Jetmore
said: "Realizing, as we all must on this
occasion, the uncertainty of life and all
human pursuits, let us go forth with a
determination to,s.o live that when we
shall be called by the Exalted Ruler of
the Universe to the Grand Lodge above,
our names here on that memorial tablet
shall also stand as a synonym for a
succesful life, tempered with charity,
justice, brotherly love and fidelity.
"We sleep, but the loom of life never
stops, and the pattern which it was
weaving when the sun went down, is
weaving when it comes up tomorrow."
Mr. W. A. S. Bird followed with a
tribute to the departed brothers.
This was the first memorial service
held by the Topeka lodge but it is ex
pected hereafter to hold one each year
and probably in some church.
MORE ENTERPRISE.
Now the New York Journal
Will . Inaugurate War and
Carry it On.
London, Dec. 6. The papers here
give marked prominence to a story
about the reported intention of the
New York Journal to invade Cuba.
The "Westminster Gazette remarks un
der the title, "The New York Journal's
Alleged Plan for Invading Cuba:"
"Mr. Stead told us the other day in
the Review- of Re- iews that the New
York Journal mea it to do things as
well as chronicle things done by other
folks. One thinks of this on reading
the statement that the New York cor
respondent of Correspondencia de Es
pana telegraphs he has obtained con
fidential news that an expedition to
Cuba is being organized by a New
York newspaper, the Journal, and that
if the project is carried out, the results
will be serious.
"The Correspondencia states that
Carl Decker, who rescued Senorita
Evangelina Cisneros, aided by other
journalists, will attempt a bold stroke
in Cuba with the object of bringing
about an international conflict and
perhaps affording a casus belli. It can
not be doubted, adds the correspond
ent, that this attempt will be made un
der the cry of annexation and with the
waving of the United States flag. The
Journal is only waVung the openttigof
congress in order that the excitement
caused by its attempt may facilitate a
solution of the Cuban problem in a
manner favorable to the insurgents."
The Evening News publishes a poem
on the project. while the Morning
Leader interviewed Richard Harding
Davis on the truth of the story. The
public generally attaches much cred
ence to the report, since Stead's story
of the Cisneros affair excited wide
spread interest.
NO WAGES ADVANCED.
Report That George Gould Had Ad
vanced Wages Had No Foundation.
Denver, Dec. 6. Surprise was caused in
railway circles about a week ago by the
announcement that an advance of 10 per
cent in wages had been accorded by Pres
ident Gould to the employes of the Mis
souri Pacific railway. It is now reported
that no such advance has been made by
the Missouri Pacific and that none is con
templated. THOSE ROTTEN BOROUGHS.
Another Case of the Absurd School
District Situation in the West.
A Logan county school teacher will
have the pleasure of going to her
school house constantly during the
next four months, meeting no pupils,
conducting no exercises, simply draw
ing her salary.
This surprising condition has been re
ported to the state superintendent by
Superintendent Hoskins of Logan
county. The directors of a district
contracted with a teacher for a seven
months' school. She has taught three
months and now finds that every pupil
has either moved out of the district or
is unable to attend the regular sessions
because of the extreme distance.
The board and the teacher compro
mised, the arrangement being that she
should now give up her contract, ac
cept pay for five months and release
the board from further obligation,
neither the officials nor the teacher be
ing responsible for the non-attendance
of the pupils. This question was re
ferred to the attorney general, who
holds that no such compromise can be
legally made. Under this opinion, the
young woman will simply visit the
school house, put in the regular time
there and draw pay for amusing her
self through the dreary hours which
she will spend alone in the isolated
school house.
IT COSTS MONEY
And Too Much of It to Get Coal to
Topena Stata Institutions.
The Rock Island railroad, according to a
complaint filed with the state board of
railroad commissioners today, charges the
state $11 to $16 per car for switching coal
from the Rock Island yards to the insane
asylum and reform school in this city.
Years ago the state made an agreement
with the Rock Island under the provis
ions of which the state constructed the
switch spurs from the Rock Island tracks
to the asylum and reform school. the
railroad company furnishing the equip
ment. Preceding October 1, 1S97, the company
charged the uniform rate of $3 per car
for placing coal at the institutions. Upon
that date a change was inaugurated, the
company requiring the payment of 3 cents
per 100 pounds for the service.
The president of the board of charities.
W. L. Brown, today filed a petition with
the railroad commissioners in which it i?
recited that the company's rate at this
time is excessive, unreasonable and ex
orbitant. The board will make an investi
gation at an early date.

Annual Message.

HE WILL SEE TO CUBA.
Advises Congress to Let the
Matter Alone.
Says He Will Take Care of it
When the Time Comes.
Washington, Dec. 6. Following is the
message submitted to congress by Presi
dent McKinley at he opening of the ses
sion: To the Senate and House of Representa
tives: It gives me great pleasure to extend
greeting to the Fifty-fifth congress, as
sembled in regular session at the seat of
government, with many of whose sena
tors and representatives I have been as
sociated in legislative service. Their meet
ing occurs under felicitous conditions, jus
tifying sincere congratulation and calling
for our grateful acknowledgement to a
beneficent Providence which has so sig
nally blessed and prospered us as a na
tion. -Peaoe ecd good will' with all the
nations of the earth continues unbroken.
A matter of genuine satisfaction is the
growing feeling of fraternal regard and
unification of all sections of our coun
try, the incompleteness of which has too
long delayed realisation of the highest
blessings ofthe 'union. The spirit of pa
triotism is universal and is ever increas
ing in fervor. The public questions which
now most engross us are lifted far above
either partisanship, prejudice or former
sectional differences. They affect every
part of our country alike, and permit of
no division on ancient lines. Questions
of foreign policy, of revenue, the sound
ness of the currency, the inviolability of
national obligations, the improvement of
the public service, appeal to the individ
ual conscience of every earnest citizen, to
whatever party he belongs or in what
ever section of the country he may reside.
The extra session of this congress which
closed during July last enacted import
ant legislation, and while its full effects
have not yet been realized, what it has
already accomplished assures us of its
timeliness and wisdom. To test its per
manent value further time will be re
quired and the people, satisfied with its
operation and results thus far. are in no
mind to withhold from it a fair trial.
CURRENCY REVISION.
Course to ba Followed is Plain and
Congress Should Not Hesitate.
Tariff legislation having been settled by
the extra session of congress, the question
next pressing for consideration is that of
the currency. The work of putting our
finances upon l sound basis, difficult as
it may seem, will appear easier when we
recall the financial operation of the gov
ernment since 1801J. On the 30th day of
June of that year, we had outstanding
demand liabilities in the sum of $723, SIS, -447.41.
On the 1st of January, 1S79. these
liabilities had been reduced to $143. SS9,
495.S8. Of our interest bearing obliga
tions the figures are even more striking.
On July 1, 1SCS, the principal and interest
bearing bearing debt of the government
was $2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July,
1S93, this sum had been reduced to Sii-STi,-037.100.
or an aggregate reduction of Sl,
747.294.10S. The interest bearing debt of
the United States on the 1st day of De
cember. 1S97, was $S47.365.620. The govern
ment money now outstanding (December
1) consists of $34G,CH1.01G of United States
notes $107,793,2.S0 of treasury notes issued
by authority of the law of ISM. $-J.903.304
of silver certificates and $G1,2S0.761 of stan
dard silver dollars.
With the great resources of the govern
ment and with the time honored example
of the past before us, ve ought not to
hesitate to enter upon a currency revision
which will make our dema-nd obligations
less onerous to the government and relieve
our linancial laws from ambiguity and
doubt. '
The brief review of what was accomp
lished from the close of the war to 1893
makes ur reasonable and groundless any
distrust either of our financial ability or
soundness: while the situation from 1393
to 1S97 must admonish congress o$ the im
mediate necessity of so legislating as to
make the return of the conditions then
prevailing impossible.
There are many plans propised as a
remedy for the evil. Before we can find
the true remedy we must appreciate the
real evil. It is not that our currency of
every kind is not good, for every dollar of
it is good. Good because the govern
ment's pledge is out to keep it so, and
that pledge will not be broken. However,
the guaranty of our purpose to keep the
pledge will best be shown by advancing
toward its fulfillment.
The evil of the present system is found
in the great cost to the government of
maintaining the parity of our different
forms of money, that is, keeping all of
them at' par with gold. W'e surely can
not longer be heedless of the burden this
Imposes upon the people. even under fairly
prosperous conditions, while the past four
years have demonstrated that it is not
only an expensive charge upon the govern
ment, but a dangerous menace to the na
tional credit.
It is manifest that we must devise some
plan to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions. We
must either curtail the opportunity for
speculation, made easy by the multiplied
redemptions of our demand obligations,
or increase the gold reserve for their re
demption. We have $900,000,000 of cur
rency which the government by solemn
enactment has undertaken to keep at par
with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem
in gold but the government. The banks
are not required to redeem in gold, the
government is obliged to Keep equal with
gold all its outstanding currency and coin
obligations, while it" receipts are not re
quired to be paid in gold. They are paid
in every kind of money but gold, and the
only means by which the government can
with certainty get gold is by borrowing.
It can get it no other way when it most
needs it.
The government without any fixed gold
revenue is pledged to maintain gold re
demption, which it has steadily and faith
fully done and which, under the authority
now given, it will continue to do.
The law which requires the government
after having redeemed its notes to pay
them out again as current funds demands
a constant replenishment of the gold re
serve. This is especially so in times of
business panic and when the revenues are
insufficient to meet the expenses of the
government. At such times the govern
ment has no other way to supply its def
icit and maintain redemption but through
the increase of its. bonded debt. Under
this necessity $262,313,400 of 4!-2 per cent
bonds were issued and sold under the ad
ministration of my predecessor and the
proceeds used to pay the expenses of the
government in excess of the revenues and
sustain the gold reserve. While it is true
that the greater part of the proceeds of
these bonds were used to supply deficient
revenues, a considerable portion was re.
quired to maintain the gold reserve.
With our revenue equal to our expenses,
there would be no deficit, requiring the
issuance of bonds. But if the gold re
serve falls below $100,000.0, how will it
be replenished except by selling more
bonds? Is there any other way practica
ble under existing law? The serious ques
tion then is, shall we continue the policy
that has been pursued in the past.- that
is, when the gold reserve reaches the point
of danger, issue more bonds-,, and. supply
the needed gold, or shall we provide other
means to prevent these recurring drains
upon the gold reserve? If no further leg
islation is had, and the policy of selling
bonds is to be continued, then congress
should give the secretary of the treasury
authority to sell bonds at long or short
periods, bearing a less rate of interest
than is now authorized by law. I ear
nestly recommend as soon as the receipts
of the government are quite sufficient to
pay all the expenses of the government,
that when any of the United States notes
are presented for redemption in gold and
are redeemed In gold, such notes shall be
kept and set apart, and only paid out in
exchange for gold. This is an obvious
duty. IT the holder of the United States
note prefers the gold and gets it from
the government, he should not receive
back from the government a United States
note without paying gold in exchange for
it. The reason for this is made all the
more apparent when the government is
sues an interest bearing debt to provide
gold for the redemption of United States
notes a non-interest bearing debt. Surely
it should not pay them out again except
on demand and for gold. If they are put
out in any other way, they may return
again, to be followed by another Vond is
sue to redeem them another interest
bearing debt to redeem a non-interest
bearing debt.
In my view it is of the utmost import
ance that the government rhould be re
lieved from the business of providing all
the gold required for exchanges and ex
port. The responsibility is alone borne
by the government without any of the
usual and necessary banking powers to
help itself. The banks do not feel the
strain of the gold redemption. The whole
strain rests upon the government, and the
size of the gold reserve in the treasury
has come to be. with or without reason,
the signal of danger or of security. This
ought to be stopped.
If we are to have an era of prosperity
in the country, with sufficient rece ipts for
the expenses of the government. We may
feci no immediate embarrassment from
our present currency: but the (."anger still
exists and will be ever present, menacing
us as long as the existing system con
tinues. And besides, it is in times cf
adequate revenues and business tranquil
lity that the government should prepare
for the worst. We cannot avoid without
serious consequences the wise considera
tion and prompt solution of this ques
tion. The secretary of the treasury has out
lined a plan in great detail for the pur
pose of removing the threatened recur
rence of a depleted gold reserve and save
us from future embarrassment on that
account. To this plan I invite your care
ful consideration.
I concur with the secretary of the treas
ury in his recommendation that national
banks be allowed to issue notes to the
face value of the bonds which they have
deposited for circulation, and that the
tax on circulating notes secured by the
deposit of such bends be reduced to one
half of one per cer t per annum. I also
join him in recommending that authority
be given for the establishment of national
banks with a minimum capital of 125.000.
This will enable the smaller villages and
agricultural regjons of the country to be
supplied with currency to meet their
needs.
I recommend that the issue of national
bank notes be restricted to the denomina
tion of ten dollars and upwards. If the
suggestions I have herein made shall have
the approval of congress, then I would

ST. JOHN IN

Tells His Audience He Will
Vote For Bryan in 1900.
Prohibition Leader Raises a
Number of Laughs
BY HIS WITTY SHOTS
Familiar to All Those
Have Heard Him.
Who
Discusses the Money Question
in a Way
That Evidently Pleases
Colorado People.
Denver, Dec. 6. John P. St. John,
ex-governor of Kansas, famous as a
leader of the Prohibitionists, in a
speech at Coliseum hall Saturday night
declared that he will vote for Bryan
on a Democratic ticket in 1900 if he has
the chance. This declaration was re
ceived by the audience with enthusiast
ic applause. One of the men who had
charge of the meeting, in speaking of
Mr. St. John, said: "I have no au
thority to make the assertion, but I be
lieve I am right, in saying that he vot
ed just as you and I did, for William J.
Bryan."
Mr. St. John, in opening his speech,
said:
"I want to make a correction in the
statement made by Mr. Sprague. He
said I voted for William J. Bryan.
That tots not true. I helped to put a
ticket in the field and I worked for it.
but I say to you now. that I have
reached the conclusion that it is as im
portant to provide a home for tiie de
cent and sober man as it is to pull the
drunkard out of the gutter, and if I
live, and have the chance, I will vote
tor "William J. Bryan in 1'M'J. (Ap
plause.) If one had told me a few years
ago that I would ever vote for a Dem
ocratic ticket I should have said he
didn't know what he was talking about.
But the Bryan Dernacracy is a new
born Democracy. (Applause.) A. -id
if it doesn't rule it right the common
people will oesert it."
Taking up the silver issue Mr. St.
John said:
"As-great a man as Kdward Atkinson
of Boston the greatest man on earth
in his own estimation wrote a letter l
the Toledo Blade two years ago to in
struct us poor western fools on the
money question. He said that lfi tn I
meant the coinage of IS silver dollars to
one gold dollar. While there is no
campaign in progress, this meeting is
entirely appropriate, for eternal vigi
lance is the price of liberty. Ail the
trusts and monopolists want is to be
let alor.e.
"What is money? Strange as it
may seem there are thousands of peo
ple" who do not know what money is.
Bet us understand that gold is not money.
That silver is not money. Tiiat pap -r
is not money. But that gold, ml cer
and paper are simply the :ommodit!es
upon which the ro vernmoU stamps its
money.
"Whenever the devil wants to rob the
people he always invents some catch
word. We hear the phrase fiat muney.'
There never was any other kind of
money. Then there is that favorite
gold-bug argument that you can't make
something out of nothing. Ood sail
let there 1e light, and there was light.
The government says let certain th:ng3
lie stamped money and it is money.
"Abraham Lincoln said let tee slaves
be free, and the slaves were fre-. It
wasn't the parchment that made them
free, but the thought in the mind f
that great and liberty-loving man. In
1896 Mark Hanna said, let McKinley hi
prc;.id?nt, and he was president (laugh
ter), but 1 don't intimate for a singie
second that he thereby created some
thing out of nothing.
"We hear that there are more silver
dollars than ever before. Yes, that is
true. Suppose the government sh iuld
pass a law that no one should preach
the gospel except red-headed preachers.
The conseeiuence would be that every
church would have a red-headed
preacher and don't you see the salaries
of red-headed preachers would go up?
Somebody hears you grumble and says,
'What are you kicking about, there are
as many preachers in the lan I us
there ever were.' Yes, but t::e law
won't allow us to use them. Gold is the
red-headed preacher. There is a dis
crimination in its favor. Just as the
only legal tender preacher. Methodist,
Baptist. Presbyterian, Catholic, is the
red-headed preacher, so gold is given a
monopoly.
"Again we hoar that if we passed a
Tree silver la.v it would Hood the coun
try with pauper labor. Mark Hann t
made that statement a short time ago.
and I imagine I can see the tears tri- k
ling down his checks at the thought of
cheap labor. (Laughter.)
"Another one says: We can't do it.
If there is anything that arouses my
indignation it is to hear a big. broad
shouldered man whimpering about' our
not being able to mind our own busi
ness. Pardon me for criticising one
of your Colorado senators. (A voie:
"Give it to him!") He goes junkeliii-;
in foreign countries and iiurn'fly pre
sents himself before Queen Victoria,
sniveling and blubbering. 'Your maj
esty,' says he, 'won't you please let u
slide on our own cellar door?' tLaugh
ter.) "Yes. but enother says: 'Prosperity
has come.' Dingley bill that's what's
done it. The Dingley bill made a short
crop of wheat everywhere except in
this country and raised the price of
wheat. Yes, it is respector of persc n.
The Dingley bill it reaches out an 1
raises the price of wheat everywhere,
in Canada too. (I.anjjhter. )
"God biess Colorado! Colorado is the
greatest gold country on earth: an J
vet her people are almost solid for f : -e
silver and why? Because they have
humanity. Nov; let me say the Ding
ley bill throws no protection aroun :
the mineral products of Colorado, puts
them on a free trade basis. It's t! c
most infamous measure for fleecing tre
masses and enrich 'tis the few that v.-
ever enacted."
In conclusion the speaker said:
"Ood intended that this government
should be free, and I believe that Wil
liam Jennings Bryan is the man ap
pointed by tlod to lead this people out
of the Slough of Despond."
