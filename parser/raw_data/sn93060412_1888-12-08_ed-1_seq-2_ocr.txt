IEEE TRAVEL ACROSS THE
MISSOURI.
The Intelligencer some two weeks
ago stated that one ot the best things
the people of Lexington could do for
themselves would be to build a pouioou
bridge across the Missouri river, and to
keep it open for passage at a merely
uominal price .
Since then we printed a paragraph
which poluled to the probability ot the
early building of a bridge at this point
by the Atohison, Topeka & Banta Fe
railroad company.
We desire here to show that even if
the latter mentioned bridge should be
made, that the city of Lexington is
fully as muoh Interested iu the con
struction ot the former.
We have nothing here to say against
buildinc the railroad brldire; indeed we
have said much in Hs.favor in the past
and hope to have occasion to advocate
it attain-in the near future. Certainly,
it the Santa Fe desires to cross the
river at all to make Its St. Louis and
St. Joseph connection, this is the place
at which to do it. But our people
particularly need a wagon bridge across
tlie river. As a rule railroad compa
nies do not liko to bave wagon ways
on their bridges. To pat them above
or below the track is very expensive,
to place them on the same level is both
dangerous and inconvenient.
These things being true it will be seen
that even if we shall secure the Santa
Fe bridge there is grave doubt about
our being able to get a wagon bridge
with it. This we ascertained when we
were endeavoring to secure the B. &
S. W. bridge. But there is a plau by
which we can get a wagon bridge, a
good and reliable one, and at a reasona
ble cost, I. e., iu a pontoon bridge. At
first blnsh this seems a visionary idea.
We confess that when it was originally
suggested to us we thought so. Familiar
as ' we were with the convenience,
strength,durability and practicability ot
even long pontoon bridges in military
servlco.still when we heard them spoken
ot for the turbulent aud rapid Missouri
we had grave doubts. Investigation
and inquiry has almost if not quite
removed them from our mind, aud we
desire to enlist the mterest of oar people
In the matter.
Is it doBirable that we should bave a
wagon bridge across the river? We
think the asking of this question
furnishes the roply. For mercantile
purposes Lexington's territory is too
much limited. The semi-clrole on the
south could, by a free bridge, be dupli
cated on the north. Travel would be
attracted and greatly augmented, aud
every branoh of iudustry or commerce,
and all our professional avocations,
would receive new aid and encourage
ment. We believe this of so much im
portance as to justify a very cousidera-
blooutlay on the part of our citizens,
fact the expense
would be. comparatively speaking, a
moderate one.
Is such a bridge safe and praotloable?
Experience, the -best ttacher, indicates
that it is. A pontoon bridge hat for

tbere has been successfully built and
operated over the Missouri river, at
Nebraska City, a pontoon bridge which
meets aud answers all objections, in
the' most convincing way, by proving
to be in everything successful. Tiiis
bridge, to bear out our observation, at
the beginning of this artlole.ls within a
few yards of a railroad bridge. It has
the largest draw in the world, and is
consequently unobjectionable to steam
boats; it permits drift to pass easily
the draw is
opeued and closed by the current; fhe
bridge has two side paths for foot
travelers, and a sixteen toot roadway
for vehicles: its substantiality is all
that could be asked.
A crib bridge was made to cover a
grod portion ot. the distance; this is
1,050 feet long; the pontoon bridge
proper being l,u4 leet. mis is
greater stretch than would be necessary
at this point. Both the crib and pon
toon bridges were built within twenty
eight days, and the entire cost of the
structure was about $18,000.
At Leavenworth and at Liberty the
people are agitatlug the matter of pon
toon bridges, and so successful has been

The Globe. Democrat must bo ironi
cal when it Kays, "the republican puny
will soon resnmo control of national
affairs, and proceed to create a navy
which will bo a credit to tho country."
Whun the republican party went out ol
power after a tenure of twentv-lliree
years its typical naval vessel was the
Tallapoosa, which was sunk by coming
into collision with a coal bargo. That
party worse than threw away $75,000,-
000 in useless repairs of old hulks, and
spent altogether over $500,000,000 on a
navy, which when it lot go did not
havo one single vessel that could copo
with even a third-class English, French,
Italian, or even Chinoee man of war.
Mr. Cleveland's administration hut
laid tho foundation for a good navy, and
with its usual cheek the republican
party will claim tho credit that belongs
to him. As the old farmer arose aud
said after tho graudiloqueut speech of a
republican orator: " In the beginning
God created tho hsaveus and the
earth.' Let us make haste to havo
that well understood, because if we
don't tho republican party will claim
that it did it." Truly as claimcrs the

A just and sensible revision of our

Such a revision should receive the

who believe that the contented compe

Extravagant appropriations of public
money, with all their demoralizing
consequences, should not be tolerated,
