have been discussing this matter
Since long before the election, though since the election there has
been a growing belief that fewer matters will receive consideration
than was generally expected in the weeks just before the election.
Among the subjects of which mere is less hope now than there was
a while ago is tariff revision. According to a leading and well-informed
paper, which in this expresses what other well-informed papers
believe:
"Republican talk of revision is coming to be classed among the
hardy annuals of political topics. Some persons of buoyant temper
ament profess to believe that the party in power will take some heed
of the lessons of the recent election and allow tariff revision to be
' talked on the floor of Congress tliis winter without inflicting- any dis
cipline on the members who are bold enough to proclaim their belief
ibat the existing schedules should be lowered.
"The -most that can be hopeu for now is that the President will
get the consent of the party; leauers to proclaim himself in his mes
sage in favor of a modification oi the Dingley duties. Mr. Roosevelt
puce put such a paragraph in a message,and then struck it out at
.the earnest solicitation of'Speaker Cannon and other "standpatters."
"Last November there was more talk of tariff revision in Wash
ington than there is now, and the way seemed prepared for legislation,
but nothing came of the talk, aow representative Republicans anu
v party organs are expressing the oelief that the time has "nearly ar
rived" when something must be clone to readjust existing inequalities
under the Dingley law. They reason that the coming short session
,wj1I not have .time enough, and that the eve of a presidential election
jjj not the proper time for going into such a matter.
, "The regular long session ot the Sixtieth Congress, they say, will
not be the time, because it might interfere with the congressional elec
tions of 1908. This is the same policy of delay that has been in opera
tion since the spread of the tantf revision sentiment throughout the
country. The real leaders of the Republican party are no more in
clined now to make changes than they were two years ago. There is
nothing to show that the Republican party will lower or readjust the
existing tariff duties until it sees defeat staring it in the face. The
session b.cgmning in 1909 is the earliest probable date for tariff re
form.' Opinions' 'differ as to what subjects will be taken up by Congress
at this session. Some maintain that only the necessary appropriation
uij, U1a wm passeu, anu mat tnc bmoot case will be used
to give members a chance to talk. Others hold that Congress will
not be content with this program, but will endeavor to work through
a mass of important legislation in the three months of the session.
One man's guess is as good as another's.
There seems however to be a general consensus of opinion that
President Roosevelt is expected in his message to recommend more
drastic immigration laws than are embodied in the measure now be
fore Congress.
The bill has in it an educational provision, inserted by the Senate,
which provides that all adult immigrants must be able to read and
write. If the President should urge that the reading and writing clause
be retained, the conferees on the part of the House may agree to leave
the Senate's educational clause as it stands.
Organized labor was in favor of the education test, and so were
citizens who have been looking with apprehension upon the hordes of
illiterates that for years in rapidly increasing numbers have been com
ing from southern Europe. The opposition to the educational section
ot the bill came largely from representatives of the great transporta
tion lines, who saw a loss of immigration, and from men who feared
that the Russian Jews, flying from persecution and massacre, might
hnd the gates of safety closed.
This immigration matter is formidable. (Many sections of the
North are anxious to get rid of the undesirable foreigners. They can
not get rid of them, but they can, if aided, prevent their further in
crease. The South wants white immigration of only one kind, that
from the British Isles and from northern Europe. With the Presi
dent's backing, many Representatives will vote for the educational'
test.
Next to tariff revision, which is unlikely to be touched, and immi
gration, which may go through, comes currency reform. The best
opinion is that nothing will be done in this direction this winter, not
withstanding the substantial agreement of business and financial
todies and Treasury officials on a plan of relief.

ment arc evidence, not alone of a
higher status of taste in a community, but of a growing sense of per
manence. In a new community, in the bubble and mushroom settle
ments of new countries, whether the lure thither be gold or grazing,
utility is the sole consideration in thc early construction. It is not so
because there is entire lack either of sentiment or taste. -But it is
largely so because the sense of permanence is wanting in thc first set
tlers of a community, with rare exceptions. In most cases there is
the thought of speedily securing a competence and returning to the
old home, or to the Fatherland. The Britons of Australia, of even
the third and fourth generation, speak of England as "home." And
colonists the world over have the same feeling. It probably disap
pears much more quickly where the colonist is amalgamated iiito a
population speaking a language different from the mother tongue.
The sense of transitoriness continues in thc newly arriving indi
v'thial long after it has given place to that of permanence in the com
munity. There is a feeling that the "old home" is the permanent
home. But this wears off with thc individual as with the community,
and the evidence of it in the community is the growing desire for
those symbols of permanence which architecture, rightly so called,
and monuments, furnish.
The enlargement of St. Andrew's 'Cathedral is an expression of the
sense of permanence as well as an evidence of growth. More distinctly
is the proposal of the family of thc late Theophilus H. Davies to erect
a parish house as a memorial to him, an evidence of this sense of per
manence. The suggestion of a tower for the cathedral as a memorial
to the late Mrs. Mackintosh, which has undoubtedly taken a strong

hold on the minds of many of her
friends, derives much of Its force from
this sense of permanence. A cathedral
tower built In stone, glves a sense of
permanence which Is the essential ele
ment In a memorial, which other forms
of memorial, such as the endowment of
an institution, do not so readily yield.
Nothing could more suitably typefy
the growing senso of permanenco and
continue In the community than the
plans that have been proposed for the
enlargement and embellishment of St.
Andrew's Cathedral, and for the memo
rials that hav0 been suggested. They
are at once the promise of continuity
and growth. Thoso who have these
plans In charge may Justly appeal to
the whole community for the necessary
