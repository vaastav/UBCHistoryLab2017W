"" SPECIAL NOTICE.
OUBSELVES.
The year in now drawing to a close and we
detiro to liavo our accounts all settled up by
the beginning of the New Year. Our friends,
indebted to us either for work or subscription,
will confer a great favor by calling at onec
and squaring up. Tbe coming term of the Cir
cuit Court will afford nu opportunity to our
Country friends for doing so. and wo hope
they will call on us at that time if not before.
Wo also beg lcavo to announce to our
friends that in view of tlic groat advance in
the price of paper and printing materials gen
erally, wo aru compelled to iucrcasc our sub
scription price.
Wo have forborno doing this as long ns
pOßsiblo, notwithstanding such has been done
by every paper in the country so far as wc
know, and only do it now as a matter of ne
cessity. The price charged the last year bus
actually not paid for the paper alone, and the
slight increase we now intend making to it
will hardly do so. In justice to ourselves
therefore we do ns suggested.
Hereafter our price for subscription will bo
a* Allow :
$9.50 if paid in advance.
$3.00 if paid at any time tboreaftcr.
THE POOR.
BELIEF ASSOCIATION.
In most if not iu all our larger cities there
arc permanent organizations for the relief of
needy and dostitute. These organizations in
the larger cities are permanent institutions.
An effort in now being made in that direction in
our city. Two meetings have been already
held on this subject and the third one is to bo
held this evening at 7 o'clock iu the English
Lutheran Church for the purpose of devising
a plan, and puttifig it into operation, which
shall work effectively and properly for tho ro
lief of the needy and destitute in our midst.
Destitution, poverty and crime are circum
stances to be found in nearly all communities,
and all governments provide, largely, statutes
for the suppression of crime and piovido but
little for tho relief and prevention of destitu
tion and poverty. Crime and destitution aro
But necessarily connected with each other;
though crime too frequently results from des
titution. Sho or he who prevents vice or
crime by relieving tho necessities of the poor
and needy is a benefactor, not only to the ob
jects relieved, but to the community in which
bo or aim has prevented the commission of
crime. The person who in tho hour of sorest
need happens on a fellow creature, who, driven
by the cravings of hunger or the pinching
pangs of cold, is on the verge of destroying the
admonitions of moral teachings, and for the
preservation of the body, is ready to peril the
aoul by plunging into theft or robbery and
affords the needed relief is a ministering angel,
and has saved uu immortal soul, perhaps,
from perdition.
Need aud destitution are not always the
results of a visions education or n criminal
nature. There appears to be a large class of
persons iu this world who have not the qual
ification of management, and many of these
from circumstances of ease, dwindle down into
poverty from no other fault than this want of
management, crime and vice have nothing to do
with their condition but may follow upon their
fall into need. This should be prevented by
affording timely assistance and procuring for
them the means and opportunity of doing
something for their own support, and teaching
them how to keep themselves above want. |
Others through a good sutured confidence and
the villainous uaturo of the cunning aud sharp
are reduced from wealth to poverty, ;tnd per- |
haps unfitted by nature as well as education,
to struggle with tho trials of adverso fortune [
and too weak minded to resist temptation, are
ready to yield ts crime and pollution to pro
long a wretched existence. In these and like >
eases prevention of degradation is a work well
pleasing in the sight of Heaven, and brings
its rewards and its blessings in this world by
saving to society useful members, and pre
venting taxation to support engorged I'cni- j
tentarics and Jails.
Tliere arc also vicious needy among ns wlio"
should still be the objects of kind care as it
may lessen the degreo of their criminality,
and perhaps lead to reformation and useful
ness. If but one out of an hundred be saved
and restored to usefulness in society, it will
be worth all the labor and means that ean he
expended.
To relieve the distressed, to sooth the un
bapyy, to sympathise'with their roisfortuncß,
and to restore peace to their troubled minds,
is the highest duty as it should he the holiest
pleasure of those in whose hands it has pleased
God to place the means of accomplishing such
noble and mighty results.
It is a work which calls for the materia) aid
of nuts and the ministering kindness of true
icornea: Tlte latter-ie always ready and wil
ling to engage in all works cf goodness and
benevolence; but this is a work in Which she
muat be aided by the sterner sex. Shall they
bare it? We know, because we have fre
btiiithe used, that there arc
somo we hope not many, wbo will reply to this ]
appeal, "let the corporate authorities attend to
it, I am willing to pay my share of the tax."
The object of this movement is not to estab
lish a CORPORATION AMIS HOISK OR A SYSTEM
or OUT DOOR PAirfclt PKNSIONBRS II Tt is not
to cultivate a feeling of impudent dependence
on public charity or to make the UNFORTUNATE
NEEDY loose their self respect by becoming
public ptilpcr.t and Urcftfitrt, to bcccino peSts
to society and inmates of Jails and Peniten
tiaries or fancy ornaments of a yalloiri. It is
to relieve the needs of those who by misfor
tune and the adverso circumstances of the
limes have been heti'icred uoabto to meet the
exorbitant prices to sustain until
circumstances shall enable them to help theui
' selves. The object is not merely to give them
the food and raiment necessary to keep body
nnd soul together, but also to devise and fur
nish as far as may be the sources from which
they can sustain themselves without the foel
ing of dependence o Corporation cliarity.
Let there he a ycncral TURN OUT TO-KIQIIT of
(icullemcn and Ladies with minds and hearts
full of KNHIOY, WILL AND KINDNESS. We un
derstand that several addresses may be expect
ed, und the hope is indulged that a permanent
organization will be completed, and requisite
committee's appointed.

IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT BY
THE PRESIDENT.
Hon. S. P. Uhaso of Ohio, Chief Juatico of the
Supreme Court.
On Tuesday, the Cth inat., Mr. Lincoln
sent to the Senate tho natno of Sat.MO.v I'.
GUASE for Chisf Justice of tlio Supremo
Court of the United States, to fill the va
cancy caused by the death of the Hon. 14.
Jl. Taney, and the nomination was imme
diately confirmed This actiou of the Pres
ident will receive the approval of the great
majority of tho people end is a high compli
ment to Mr Chase's admitted fitness for the
placo. We know of no man more worthy or
more deserving of such an exalted position,
and his appointment is a guarantco that the
high character and lofty tono given to this
impartial tribunal by Chief Justice Marshall
and his associates will be maintained in all
its purity.
The nominations of Hon Vi tn. tlunfitson,
for Postmaster-General, and Hon. J. Speed,
of Kentucky, for Attornry-Gcftrraf, were
sent in at the Bamo time and have been con
firmed.
These are also eousided excellent appoint
ments.
FACTS AND FIGURES FROM THE RE
PORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY.
During the late presidential canvnsH, we had
any amouut of misrepresentation by copper
head orators and journals, in regard to the
Public Debt., daily expenditures of the gov
ernment. &e.
It will be a relief to tho nation to lenrn
from ojjicial sources, that these matters have
been magnified to tnoro than double their j
dimensions, and that instead of three or fotlr
thousand millions, insisted upon by the or
ators and journals named, the Publio Dobt
now amounts to $1,740,090,489.49 —that the
interest on this for the current year amounts
to $91,810,215.18, that the portion payable
in coin is $50,000,000 —that tho daily ex
penditure is estimated at about $2,250,000 —
that tho rcreuuo from taxation and other
sources is estimated at $419,412,389, of
which $79,271,091 comes from oustoius,
$249,502,859 from internal revenue, and
$24,020,171 from "miscellaneous sources. 1 '
Mr. Fcssondcn estimates that it will be ne
ccsiarsy to borrow during tho year $020,727,
508.
After making all necessary additions and
deductions, the pnblic dfebt will bo increased
by July next to the amount 'A $482,374,188
or in other words the Public Debt at the time
named, will amount to about $2,200,000,000.
These are some of the facts and figures pre
sented in the Report lately made to Congress
by Hon. W. P. Fessenden, Secretary of the
Treasury, and 1 may be wdied on as correct.
Tbcy arc rather startling in comparison
with statements of tliif kind that we have
been nccustomcd to hear in ordinary times.
This is one of the consequences of the Re
bellion- however, and appalling as these fig
ures may be, every true patriot will willingly
submit to any burden it may bo deemed ne
cessary to impose ii> order to oOfootually crush
it out.
THE NEW RAILROAD.
I Wo learn th*< on the 9th inst., a Corp* of
| Engineers under the direction of W. W. Tay
lor, Esq., the Engineer of the Western Ma
i ryland Railroad Company, completed the
alignment of the route for tho extension of
I tho Western Maryland road from Hagors
| town to Cumberland- The construction of
this road would be a great public benefit, and
we see nothing to prevent it. ThegfevS oro
: mercial interests of Chicago, Pittsburg and
tho Northwest, in conjunction with the Coal
i Trade of Western Maryland, and especially,
| the commercial interests of Baltimore and the
I iutcrest of all property-holders in Baltimore,
all conspire to urge the prompt completion of
tho work from lingers town to Cumberland.
Wo understand that tho length of the road
by tho reeeat survey iS Tfftnileg, and that the
I grades n<e moderate, and can be rcdticed still
I l.Twcr. The lino is entirely on Maryland soil,
I but will not only promote the interests of
, Maryland citizens, but equally award the in
\ terests of New York and other capitalists who
i arc largely concerned in the Coal Trade of •
j Allegany County; as well as the great com-'
I mercial interests of our ontcrpri-ring sister
! city of Pittsbnrg. But above and beyond all, !
; the Pittsburg, Fort Wnyntf and Chicago Rail-'
i road Company are deeply and'dircctly interes
ted in this enterprise, which a connection with i
tho Pittsburg and Connellsvflle Railroad will j
plaCfe Chicago in direct daily communication :

I THE WAR NEWS.
From the Army of the Potomac,
An important rcconnolssance from the
army of the Potomac started out on Wed
' desday morning 7th instant. The column
under command of General Warren, consist--
: iDg of the Fifth Corps, a Division of the
' second corps and two brigades of cavalry ,
which started South on Wednesday morning.
* are known to havo crossed the Mottoway river
and advanced in the diretftioH of Stony Creek
s without opposition. Deserters who catao into
our lines report that Mathen's division had
L been sent to oppose our advance. On Thurs
day afternoon a roconnoissancc was made in
the direction of Hatcher's Creek, and the rebel
pickets were driven into their fortifications. —
' Firing was heard in the direction of Stony
I Creek Indicating that General Warren was at
work. On Friday morning ah Other recon
' noissanco was made in the direction of Hoteli
er's Crook Tho force consisted of both in
fantry and cavalry under command of Gen.
Miles. Tho enemy's breastworks on the fur
s ther side of the rivor were carried by assault,
their forces fulling back to a stronger position
at Armstrong's mill. We held tho position
' gained at the latest advices.
" On the north side of the James Gen. But
ler has also consummated an important move
, nient. On Wednesday morning a body of
1 colored infantry, under Gen. Ludlow, were
i moved across the James river in pontoons to
: the left bank and made a successful lodgment.
> Upon effecting a landing our forces at ODee
captured nnd scattered the Rebel pioketsjalong
that hank While this was being accomplish
ed other forces reached a point beyond the
northern terminus of the canal, were a rifle
! pit was thrown up for protection against fur
ther assault. The position now hold by Gon
Ludlow on the loft side of the river is a strong
one. Soon after noon the enemy's mortar
i batteries, which have hitherto paid their ex
clusive ntteiition to the canal, Opened with
vigor upon Gen. Ludlow's position, effecting
no damage, however. Shortly before dusk
on the evening of 7th, the Rebel rams moved
, down to a point nearer the Hewlett House,
evidently with a view of precautionary mea
sures. Nothing has as yet been heard from
Hi em. The Richmond Dispatch of the Bth
speaks of the movement as an important one,
that mnst " lead to an immediato battle."
The Dispatch of tho 7th says : Wo stated yes
terday that Grant had been reinforced by the
Sixth Corps from Sheridan's army. Itrom
the nninbcr of transports loaded with troops
that have boon passing down the Potomae dur
ing the last fouf days it is probable that the
Eighth Corps is also moving to the James river
We think it quite certain that Grant is muS
tering forces for the long talked of grand at
tack upon the Richmond linos. His concen
tration for this purpose will not occupy him
long ; and if tlio tino weather of the last fcw
days continues ho may bring on a battle this
week..— ■ Baltimore American.
General Warren, who commanded tho re
comioitering column has returned, having ac
complished what he set out to perform, the
destruction of tho Woldou Railroad. We
take the following extract from the account
of the affair written by Win McGregor, the
correspondent of the Associated Press :
•' The move may be considered one of the
most successful of the campaign, and reflects
honor not only ou tho originator hut on those
to whom its execution was entrusted. A
most effective blow has hem dealt the enemy
by the destruction of some fifteen miles of
railroad which they were using extensively,
some one hundred tars passing over it every
day loaded with supplies. The track wits
torn up, tho ties piled in heaps with dry wood
from adjacent fences ami set on tire with the
rails on top, the heat bending ami twisting
them in every shape.
"All the ilt pots along tho roafe were burned,
as well as numerous mills, barns and dwell
ings, from which tho occupants bad fled, or
from tlio cover of which guerillas lud Bred on
our troops. One was caught with a gun near
where a shot had just been fired, it is said
tho troops hung liiin near the Nottawny river.
'•Our loss during the entire tripwii) not ex
ceed forty or fifty in killed and wounded, be
sides a few stragglers who Were captured.
The severity of tlio weather was the principal
difficulty the men had to encounter, but as
thoru was much wood on the lino of march,
and plenty of work for them to do, they
managed to keep themselves from suffering
scveriy ou this account."
Prom Gen. Sherman's Expedition,
The Billowing di-patcii wus received by tlm
Baltimore American from Annapolis on the
10th instant :
The steamer Viclor has just arrived from
Charleston, where all of Colonel Mulford's
fleet are now lying—the point of exchange !
having been chaugod from Savannah to Char
leston, General Sherman and Foster having
interuptod the exchange ,vt the former place.
When tho Victor sailed, on Wednesday,
heavy firing was heard in the direction of
Savannah; indicating either an attack on
Savannah or the railroad between the two
cities. All agree that Savannah must fall.
Prom the Lower Mississippi.
A Vicksburg dispatch dated Dec, 4 and
received at Cairo Dec. 9, says:
Major General Dnnnn, by a successful ex
pedition front Vicksburg, destroyed the Mis
sissippi Central Railroad for thirty miles above
Big Black crossing, including Long Bridge.
At that place the enemy were found in foreo,
but the work was thoroughly done, aud the
troops returned to Vicksburg with a loss of
five killed and forty-one wounded. Two thou
sand five hundred bales of Confederate cotton
and abont §300,000 worth of property were
destroyed.
From Kentucky.
The Louisville aud Lexington passenger train
going west of Plcasantville was thrown fro id
tho track by a rail displaced by guerillas.
Nobody was injured.
Another party of guerillas while endeavor
ing to remove a rail near Beard's Station was
fired on by the guard of a freight train, which
was standing at Hoard's Station. A man
uamcd kilis, from Shelby county, was badly,
if not mortally, wouudod, and three others
are reported to have been wounded.
Thertf was considerable excitement here yes
terday from the arrcnt of gamblers and the
impressment of horscj. The street cars are
temporarily stopped for want of motive power
A gang of Gentry's men took possession of
Lagrange yesterday afternoon, injuring the
railrond sb as to disarrange the trains for a
few days. The Journal says: "It is oul
impression that Breckinridge will Otrn up in']

THE PRESIDENT S MESSAGE.
The following review of this document is
taken from tho American of Thursday last:
The Message of President Lincoln, like
most of his State papers, has the characteris
tic merit of condensation. Within the spa:;e
of little more than two pitd a half of our col
umns he disposes briefly, biit Satisfactorily, Of
topics, the number and Variety of which would
havo filled a large volume if treated in tho
fulsouio mode prescribed by some of his pre
dwjessurs. As a natural result of this brevity
Ins message will "be rea l by thousands of peo
ple who would have shrunk appalled from the
proportions of one of tlio verbose documents
of Marlih Van Buroii or James Buchanan.
The sotiditiou of our foreign affairs is rep
resented as satisfactory. Our relations with
Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Colombia and
the various South American Republics are
adverted to briefly, and the prominent points
of interest clearly shown. Official communi
cation lias been held with Liberia, and it Is
recommended byway of deserved national aid,
to furnish a euuboat as tlio nucleus of a
navy fur that Republic for the effectual sup
pression of the slave trade, the money to be
reimbursed by installments. The proposed
telegraphic connection with Europe byway of
Bullring's Straits, with its grertt trlUlltaries,
has been commenced under favoring circum
stances. Oceanic communication with Great
Britain will also bo again undertaken. Both
of these enterprises foreshadow a high career
of commerce and civilization upon the resto
ration of peace. Mr. Thayer's death iii Egypt,
aud our relations with the Pacha are next
referred to. The Celestial Empire is becom
ing more docllo in its acquiescence with the
establidied usages of rlatlbtlsj nd flVeti Japan
is not quite as capricious as formerly. As
several Southern ports have been opened to
commerce, it is prudently suggested to for- j
cign tuet'ohants that it would bo safer and
more profitable to ship their goods hence than
to be violating by a contraband trade a law
ful hockadc. W illi reference to the difficul
ties vhioh have arisen in Brazilian and British i
porti, a jus( aud conciliatory policy is recoin- i
mctiied. Tri regard to the questions which j
may arise more particularly on the Canadian
border, suggestions are oil'ofuJ for our future |
course which commend themselves to approval.
Euigration is referred to as one of tiio re- 1
plJnlshing streams upon which we must de
psud for reparation of the ravages of war, and
elective national protection is recommended. I
'Hie financial a flairs of tho Governmonr, the)
President thinks, have been successfully ad
ministered. The figures given will interest
our readers, to whose careful study and con
sideration they arc commended. To meet
deficiencies and diminish loans, increased tax
' ition is feconimended, with the legislation
necessary to secure it. The National banking
system is favorably commented upon ns a
' scheme acceptable to both capitalists and peo
ole. Attention is invtted to the Teports of the
, various Departments, which will appear in
our columns as they are received,- Varioua
interesting facts are given from these Bureaus,
particularly those of the Navy and flic Gen
eral Pdst'OfSce. Tho Pacific Railroad, the
gold discoveries in the Sierra Nevada, Indiau
affairs, Pensions and Agriculture all claim an
appropriate share of remark. General Sher
| man's march thruugh the insurgent Region is
; considered the most remarkable feature in
the military operations of the year, hut no
| prognostications are indulged in regard to it.
I Maryland is secure to liberty and the Union
| for all the future. The evidences of imitative
action on the part of Missouri, Kentucky and
Tennessee tf.iouhl not ho overlooked. The
remarks upbu the constitutional abolit'on of
Slavery are all that the most hopeful could
wish." We ;heartily commend them to the
deep attention of our renders. The significant
lessons of tie recent Union victory at tho
polls are reviewed in a comprehensive spirit.
N'o one trnd'fsfittids those lessons or is mora
thoroughly Impressed by them than Mr. f,iu
eoln. Iv.act will he restored when the Rebels
lav down tiffir arms and return to their right
ful allegiance- no sooner. Instead of pro
posing another amnesty as was hinted at by
General BudCf in New York, it is iutiuiated
that persistence in rebellion may eventually
close the door that has so hmg boon open, and
more vigorous measures he adopted In clus=
ing, the President declares that he will not
retract or nullify the Emancipation Procla
mation, and that if it should he made Execu
tive duty to re-enslave persons frood by the
terms of that Proclamation, another and not
he must be their instrument to perform it.
For these liurninsr words ho will receive the
thanks of the world.
RKAPTNG THE MESSAGE IN THE IIOUSB.
The quiet attention given to the reading of
the President Message in tho House was
broken with • applause over tho passage
" Maryland is secure to Liberty aud Uuion
for all the future." A laugh received the
sly hit that on the distinct issue of Union or
no Union the politicians have shown the in
sliuctire knowledge that there is no diversity
of purpose among the people. The applause
was hearty and ioud over the manly paswige
"If tho people sb'orM, by whatever mode or
moans, make Executive duty to re-onslave
such persons, another and not I, must be their
' instrument to perforin it." But the conclud
ing Words of the Message, "the war will
cease on the part of the Government when
ever it shall have ceased oil i!;r part of those
who began it," was received by tho Union
members with a demonstration of true satis
faction that wss full of significance. The
Democrats sat stfilcn in their seats, Waving
the printed copies'of the Message, which had
been distributed when the reading commenced,
unopened on their desks.

POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE,
A AIU 11 AM LINCOLN is the first President from
, the Northern Suites who has been twice
| elected.
| THE I.cpi&laturc of Michigan stands:—
| Union, 03 ; Democratic, 33; doubtful, 8. Lin
coln's majority in the State over 11.U00.
McCi.Rht.Att received the smallest voto of
any Presidential candidate except Pinckncy,
the Federal eundidute iu 1304, who got only
14 votes.
Tite majority in New York Ptnte for Reu
ben JO: Fen ton, who is elected Governor over
floratio Seymour, is nearly 2000 greater than
that for Mr. Lincoln!
Tin Ohiu Soldiers' vote at the October ejec
tion, was (on Secretary of State) Union, 02,-
887 ; Democratic, 4,31)0. For President the
Soldiers' vote will bo much larger.
TUB Hon. H. D. Washburn h6 caused u
j notice to be served upon the lion. D. W.
! Voorhees, of a Contest of the seat he claims in
i Congress, from the Vllth Indiana District.
HON. Schuyler Colfax is likely to be eleetcd
Speaker of the Thirty-niuth Congress, though
Hon. Wm. D, Kelly nnd • Hot). Elihil 11
Wasbburue art also strongly urged for the
position.
ST Louis papers ptlt the Union majority in
Missouri at 20,000. Tlie Congress Districts
are not fully scttlsd, but we conclude that all
the newly elected members afe Unionists,
eiespt from ifitJ Ist District.
THE town of Mount Tabor, Rutland county,
Vermont, in 1800, gave Mr. Liucoln 28 votes,
ami none fur " any other tnau." Ifl 1804 it
ffat*B 36 volcS for Lincoln, and (tone figaitt for
tlio other man. Mr. Lincoln gains a little,
it is true ; but the other uiuu holds his own
wonderfully.
THE Louisville Journal has resolved upon
a new course, consistent willr its inore pro
gressive antecedents, abandoning the ultra
pro-Slavery party of Kentucky, nnd in tnrb
being abandoned by Mr. Paul Shiftman, its
sometime pro-Slavery editor: iltis change is
fortunate flrr the Jtritrrtali Slid it is also im
portant to Kentucky; Where It has been so
iong a leader of Opinion under Pcfltiee. Its
new covenant Is sealed by the grateful admis
sion that slsvery in Kentucky and eTery
where else is doomed.
Ov the twooty-fifc Slates which voted at
the recent Presidential election, thero are
fourteen in which the copperheads will not
have in the next Congress a tingle representa
tive ; and there are three other States, Dela
ware, Missouri and Michigan, in each of which
they will have but one. This is a singular
announcement, and yet it is absolutely so.
As tlio case now standi, tho friends of the
Union will have in the U. S. Senate at the
opening of the next Congress, SW members,
being a majority of three-fourths of each
House.
THE POPULATION OF THE NORTHERN
i STATES.
It would certainly be as useless as it would
be heartless to deny or to undervalue tho im
mense lessee, suffered by the loyal States of the
Union no less than by the Rebellious, in con
sequence of the war. We have among us tens
of thousands of dissohsolate widows and fath
erless orphans We have tens of thousands
of parents mourning (tic JJreipUtUre death of
beloved sons, who were snatched from them
iii tire prime of life. Wc have tens of thou
sands of crippled Soldiers,- who Will never be
restored to the enjoyincflt oi health and the
ordiuary pursuits of life, and we sll have to
bear the burdens of a heavy taxation. Still,
notwithstanding all the misery and deprivation
which tho war has brought upon Us; it is a
remarkable aign of tiro times, that the loyal
States have not suffered yet any loss in their
aggregate population ; hut that notwithstand
ing all the devastations of the last four years
we have at present a much larger population
than in 1880. This appeals conclusively frotu
a comparison of the Votes cast at the Presi
dential elections in 18<54 and 1800. We be
lieve it is fair to assume,-that the vote of 1809
was about as full Ss th-.rt of 1804, and that the
increase in the aggregate voto of the States
may be taken us an index of the increase Of
population; The following list comprises all
the States from which complete return's of the
Presidential election have so far been received,
and sliowa the increase Of voters frurn 18?>0
to 1804 :

It will be seen from this table that there is ;
nn increase in the number of voters )tr cteTy
State, except Ohio.- liven tliie solitary ex
oeption disappears when we add flic soldiers' j
vote, which will largely swell, also, the in
crease of every other State. The aggregate
of this increase itr Hitf thirteen-States enumer
ated in our Art #fll,- meHdiiig the soldier- ,
votes, reach a very high PgSrO
We must add that most of the States not j
embraced in our list show likewise an increase;
that since 1860 we have formed two new
States, Kansas and Nevada, of which the j
former in 13G3 east 15,454, aud the latter j
10,984 votes, and that a number of territories |
arc equaling the two States in rapid progress |
Wo must further take into consideration that I
the immigration from Europe ts assuming !
greater dimensions from day to day, and is |
this year considerably larger thatf last year,
and it mutt be clear to the most inveterate
skeptic that OuT Country has not been drained
yet of men, a*nd that we are as fully able now i
to replenish oUr armies and continue the war
as ever be/or#'.— ft- T. Tribune.
