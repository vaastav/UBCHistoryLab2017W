The tnfmWrM Loth linn?, have ljnin
workliw'ttionl tfwy really lnttntlM to Ao
tdinrlhlofirr ih4 rt..f ot the distresses ot
tlio pensile. jqaMtpiJt LUI1 hare been Intro-
unccti looking w mo restoration ot mo pnoiic
concacDco la tne enrroncy ana banking busi
ness ot the country All tho titrable now
rompltlnodof are traceable to the recent
panics and that panic was simply the demon
s tratlon of a want of confidence In the banks
and bankers of the country. Thli panic was
precipitated by a temporary scarcity of money
just about tho time that tho most currency
was needed for tho tramfer of the crops from
tho Interior to market, from tho producer to
tho consumer. The people took the alarm
at tho failure of a single prlrate banking
lionse and one national bank, withdrew their
roufldcnco momentarily from nil moneyed
Institutions and hoarded their funds at home.
But, our national banking system hating
withstood Ml test, reason Is now rctnmtng,
ana lueso inmls are urala eccklmr clrcnli
tlon In tho community, and it U funnel that
lucre u quite as mocu currency la the coun
try now a thirt was before tho panic 00
Mirrcd. .
Tula experience has shown Congress that
money Is scarce or plenty according as there
mb disposition to hoard it. Iteaily. a clrcn-
litlng medium Is good for nothing to hoard.
It earns nothing. It Is only when passing
from band to hand, In the liquidation of
claims or Mils, that It becomes beneficial.
Therefore the exact amount of tho circulating
medium necessary for the proper transaction
of the t.nlnes of the country depends en
tirely upon the rapidity w 1th which tt tpoeds
on Its way In the liquidation of debts and the
length of time that It Is detained In the hands
of receivers, whether they be Individuals,
bankers, banks or tho Government before It
I again started on Its natursl mission. It
should also bo recollected. In legislating upon
this subject, that remittances are made In
these latter days by railway and telegraph
about tcS times as rapidly as they were thirty
jears ago, when the malls were carried by
slago coaches, and were the most speedy
means of communication. Consequently the
amount of circulation per capita necessary to
Uc proper transaction of the business of the
country, la these days ot cash payments, ond
with a currency equally good In all parti ot
the nation, sarin discounts and exchange
amounting to some millions annually. Is not
nearly as great as formerly. Hut at the
saute tlmo the largo accession of four mil
lions of population In the persons of emanci
pated slates, who as freed men became re
sponsible users of currency on their own ac
count, added considerably to the collective
necessity. If our forty millions of popula
tion ghe eight millions of families, each of
m hlch requires on an avcrago ono hundred
dollars of tho medium for the purpose of
rffmlnff exchanges tetwcrn tho product of
lolor aud means of subsistence. It Is found
that In round numbers we require elgl t hun
dred millions of currency a tho whole vol
ume. Tholabsrcr it ho rcrchc" ten dollars
per week nAkcs that amount cflrit Ids ex
ilianges, while tho shtcvu hundred dollar
1 Icrfc requires thirty dollar, and so on ao
lording to the amount of huslnes transacted
ly different Individual. From this It will be
M-en that It Is the credit system that lrgets
I he supposed necessity of a large volume of
the irrigating medium. Cosh trade Umore
lit rly, and keeps money moving from hand
lo hand In snnll sums n necessities arise.
When the consumer pays rash for Ms goods
he cnnMes the merchant to constantly ro
Un1hhItoik The result Is that the rr
t tiler for ea.h only suffer no loss from
I.! di'M, and can turn over hi llitlo tapl-
Ul threo hundred limes annually. If he nets
nnly lire ptr cent, upon enrh turn Mi capital
tt ill yield him fifteen hundred per cent, rer
anuum, whereas tho rapltillsl who ghes
one month' credit and siiffem oeeaslouol
loupes from bad debts only turns his capital
ncrtwrltc times a jear, andshouIJ net one
liundred and twenty-fito percent, at eah
turning to equal the fifteen hundred per rent,
per annum secured by the small trader re
ferred to al)tc. Tho transaction of busi
ness on the credit system, therefore,
nqutresainueh larger toluinoot currency
than on tho cash basis, because It Is necessa
rily Idle a good portion of tho tlmo reqnlrcd
to accumulate In sulllclent sums to meet the
large payments resulting from largo orders.
Mhllo tho accumulation Is going on the
temptation Is strong to Invest In some out
sldo speculation, m Ith the hope of a safe re
turn with large elns before tho bills of pur
ihoo become dne. Bnch expectations are
ranly reatlzetl, Iho capital thus diverted
f 1 om legilsmate business produces embarrass
ment, perhaps failure. A reilnndancy of
IrredecmaMo currency stimulates prices, In
duces spenulatlon and Imparts a general de
sire on behalf of a largo portion of tho com
munity to make haste to bo rich l.y their
ttltsorlwk, nnd without toll. Industryte
omes paralyzed with neglect. AILprlncIples
that apply to ludlvldual Hoanee and
personal economy are e pially applicable to
lueonomles ana finances of a nation. It
need no wiseacre or sophist to devise ways
and means out of our national dilemma.
Their plans all tend only to mystery and de
lusion. Tho man who has Hooded his torn
munlty with due-bllh payablo at conve
nience 1 an only maintain that circulation by
u fixed sj stem of redemption. Ills extrav
agance ( an I corrected only by a rigid econ
omy. On tho quceiloiof finance It is Indisputa
ble that the I'tcsUcot Is pursuing In a spirit
of honttt, earnest, Inquiry tho right direc
tion, lie would avuld ruinous commercial
revulsions by gradual approaches to the
Ieclo basis. It hit kffoiU ami example are

The carefnlly-prrpared speech delivered in
Iho Senate yesterday by Mr. Morrill, of Ver
mont, was fall of Interesting facts, and will
well repay atarfut rerncsL Tho present
condition of on? currency was f alt bf allde
pleted, together with the evils bywhlh wo
are surrounded, and they were contrasted
with the nnmerons lcnfiu to no iiertred
fromjtretnrn to rpecle payment and Its
accompanying actual values. Onr present
financial sltnatlon was attributed by the
speaker to a redundancy ol Irredeemable pa
ner railed money, and that we persist In
making It the standard of Raines. Mr. Mor
rlllrriargesthat there lino proper effort of
legislation made to remedy this stato of
affairs. And no lnilststbat congress snoum
fix a time not more remote than January 1,
18. for the resumption of specie rayments.
Benator Morrill arpean to have forgotten
that our paper currency readied Its present
vol time during a period of fire Tears, and by
a cradunl process. Our present appreciated
valoes may to flclltlon, but they are no less
arbitrary. Contracts for real and other prop
erty made during the last eight years upon
arbitrary, appreciated price call for a spcel
Ced number ot dollars in lawful money. An
Immediate return to a gold standard would
hare the effect to drpreclato values of
and personal property fully thlrtylhree and
one third per cent. Tho President does not
think It fair that all thl loss should fall upon
the present holders and Involve Ihcm In a
common ruin.
It la an easy miller to dilute alcohol by
the sudden Infmdon of wateri but Its resto
ration to Its orlclnal proof by the process of
redistillation Is more stow and tedious. So
It Is with a diluted currency. If a disturb
ance of commercial and Industrial lalues Is
toboaoldedby tho process of restoration
to tho specie hasl It must bo accomplished
by gradual and easy approaches. In eight
years there has been a gradual reduction In
too market price of gold of about one nun'
dred and fifty, and yet Mr. Morrill says that
we hare made no effort to return to a gold
standard. The gradual reduction of the pub
lic debt, and economy of expenditures by the
administration of President Grant, has ef
fected this with but slight disturbance of
commercial affairs, and If the wise sugges
tions contained In tho President's message re
lating to the currency are followed by Con
gress, and an Interest-bearing postal or other
currency be gradually substituted for tho
legal-tender, non-I nlcrcst bearing Irredeem
able notes, there Is little, doubt that gold and
paper currency will be on a par with each
other much sooner than that event can be
bronght about by any arbitrary enactment
prescribing a Died date. Toe latter course
would open up nn admlrablo field for gold
gamblers In which to make corners, and
would doubtless enable them to depreciate
paper currency and Government bonds far
below their Intrintle value. Legislation can
no more by an arbitrary enactment forco
people to pay In tho gold they cannot obtain
than It can make paper equal to gold In ratne
by the same process.
NEEDED UEFOUIIIH. '
Among tho reforms suggested by tho Presi
dent In his message Is a constitutional amend
ment anthorulng "tho Executive to approve
of so much ot any measure passing the two
houses ot Congress as his Judgment may dic
tate, without approving tho whole, the dis
approved portion or portions to be subjected
to the same rules as now, to wltt to be re-'
ferrcd back to the house In which the meas-
uie, or measures, originate!, and If passed
by a two-third vote ot the two houses, then
to become a law without tho approval of the
President." " I would add to this, says the
President, "a provision that there should be
no legislation by Congress during the lost
twenty-four honrs of its sitting except upon
vetoes, In order to gho tho Executive an op
portunity to cxamlno and approvo or disap
prove bills undcrstaudlngly." It Is almost
too much to expect lmmcdiato action upon
either of these propositions) but there can be
no doubt that ultimately they will ie em
bodied In tho organic law.
The closing hours ot a session ot Congress
arc fruitful In all manner of Jobs. It Is the
hanest tlmeot the lobbyist. In. the hurry
and haste and excitement, the era of good
feeling that generally prevails all manner ot
corrupt measures slip throngh without dne
Investigation and Inquiry. Tho desire to save
Important LIU compels honest memlers to
consent to the passage of "riders to bills
whli ti they kmrt to le wrong, and Intended
solely to tnke money In one shape or an
other out of the Trcnsurj, The Exemilre is
phuvd In somewhat the same position. 80
grett I the necessity or legislation lu this
dlrci tlon that tho constitutional con
vention of Pennsylvania adopted a clause
almo.it Identical w tin. that suggested
by the President, vlr., empowering the Clov
error to veto any portion of a 1111 and ep-
proie of the balance. There Is Tery little
il anger that power of this character would
be abused, that It would be exercised except
In the Interest of the public. Tbe last forty-
eight hours oi a legislative session, National
or State, Is generally rooro dangeronsto tho
people, and fraught with more evil than the
preceding weeks and month put together,
aud too many checks cannot I1 imposed upon
both tho legislative and executive power.
The passage of some such law as that sug
gested by the President would bean cxet I-
lent step In the direction of reform, and It Is
tol hoped tint the coming Judiciary Com
mittee of the Senate or House will at least
report upon tho subject.

It has been dct Ided by a caucus of tho Re
publican mcmlicrs of the House ot repre
sentatives to rrport a bill going back to tbe
old compensation of the thousand dollars a
year for Congressmen. Tho sooner this h
dono tho letter. In Increasing Us compen
sation Congress mado a great and grave mis
take. The whole conn try Is against It, and
It It Idle lo throw the responsibility for the
clamor that has been rl.l In regard to It
npon tho newspapers, ttn political con
ventions that bate Ucn held dnrlng
the lat t or eight months took
eten more decided grjtind than the
Journal of cither parly, and in their plat
form, speeches and resolution were more
outspoken In Us denunciation. Predictions
are already made that this action upon the
part of tho "cauens" Is merely Intended for
effect a seeming deference to tho popular
demand, that It will l sent through the
House Immediately and killed or lost In the
Senate. It thl Is the Intention, 1-rttrr let the
whole thing rest where It Is. The country Ja
In earnest In this matter, and It w III not do to
trifle with It.
Tho mechanic, tho farmer and the merchant
have mado up their minds that flu thousand
iloliars per onnnm Is enough to pay for upon
an average flte months' work. Values are
shrinking every dayj wagea nro being re
duced, real estate Is tumbling from lu fancy
prices, railroad stocks uro selling only for
what they aro really worth, the pay of Con
gressmen nlono Is upon the advance. There
l no reason In tho w orld why, lu tho general
shrinkage of values, the salaries of legis
lators alone should expand. The expenses of
living arc being reduced. Trices arc lower
now than they wero a year ago, as a glance
at tho mirkU report will (ominsivcly show.
i;ui however an thl may be, tiuro is one
thing ftloluttl 4crta1n, that the umntry
