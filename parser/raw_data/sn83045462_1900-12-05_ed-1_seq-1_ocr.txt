RAILWAY TO U110" ]DAY.
The Plan of Decades 4 Anat Takes
Perm.
The plans of decades haye- finally taken
form, and a railway conectl the great
lake with Hudson bay is Wo# ctually un
der construction, aororiil . to United
States Consul Brush at 4ra Yalls in
a report to the State Del int. This
road, which must pluvge ihid4bds of miles
through an unbrokmw.:10ldes, is being
built in a most thorough ma her. Bighty
five-pound steel rails are us and the loco
motives. states Consul rus are of such
enormous size, weighing *5 tons when
equipped for traffic, that they are delivered
at Sault Ste. Marie, whem the railway,
starts, by steam fenMes. bliuse railroad
compantes fear to transpOrl Them on ac
count of the strain on brtd.
Ground was broken 'for e new road
about ninety days ago. but airtady twenty
live miles are competed Laud in use, and
the road Is pushing for-kar4 'f the rate )f
half a mile a day. Three Years is the esti
mated time in which to complete it. The
project is backed In the greater part by
Vnited States capitalists, but the Ontario
government has furthered the venture by
an extensive land grant. -The road will
open up a region rich in n3ineral ore and
in forest woods of all kinds. and a profit
able outcome of the investment is looked
for. The railway also intends to handle
Hudson bay fish products on a large s-alp.
"If the p!nns of the officials are carried
out." savs Consul Brush. in concluslon.
"the new railway to the north. reaching, as
it will, to the very slopes of the Aretic
ceean, will be one of the mnst daring and
pleturesiue attempts to sabjugate a wil
derness known to railway annals."

Th- revem,ie rt-duil'ii bill .'as ibeen eom
pleted by the reliblican liembers of the
ways and means eommittee, and Chairman
Payne will introduce the bill before the
close of the sessiin today. It is under
stood that in a1dition to the abolition of
the stamp taxes on tt-egrams, express re
ceipts and proprietary medicines, hereto
fore reported, there will be a reduction of
the beer tax to $1.10. The present tax is
$:P,a barrel. with a 74 per cent rebate to
$1.S,-, so that the reduction will be 25 cents
per barrel.
Chairman Payne has called a meeting of
the full ways and means committee fur to
morrow to considrr th hill.
The decision concerning hwer was arrived
at after some - division and by a divided
votc. It was first attempted to make the re
duction on tea, but this was not concurred
in. and. the question rovu-ring to beer, the
reduction was <reelded up.n. .The stamp
taxes were almost entirely wiped out, with
th, exception of the starnp taX on stocks.
Chairman Payne expects i ~ have the bill
considered In tile Iflouse af r the army,
ol omargarine and leglilatIR bills are dis
pised of. The doebute probably will begin
iext week, but no pri%amm ha.. been fixed
as to the length of debate and time of a
vote. The chairman expre-sses hope, how
ever, of obtaining a vot- before the Christ
mas holidays. The purpw.;e now is to have
the ways and meani- ommittiee act on the
bill and report it to he flouse tomorrow.

Pre.Ad-ent McKinley's reception room was
crowdei with vIsitors up to noon today.
Mo-t of the callers wekc senators and re7
r("sentatives who had not paid the usual
call of coutesy. The o4hers bad businese.
There was no long conference, howevet.
Serator. Scott and De.1ew were with the
President longer than any of the other
eallers, but Senator Depew took up part of
the timre telling the President some cam
paign stories. That these stories were of
the best, and wholly lacking any of the
charaeteristtcs of the antique chestnut, was
demonstrated by the peals of hearty laugh-.
te'- that came from the President's office.
Spnator Scott, who was in .charge of a
branch of the work of the renublican na
ti4,al. committee at New York during the
tem,)a!gn. talked to the President. about
political matters.
Mr. Munley Coming to Washington.
Joseph Manley of Mairle will be In Wash
ington on Saturday and. *111 call upon the
President. He will at that time be for
mally teniered the position of commissioner
of internal revenue. As he has had time,
smee the mention of his name for the place.
to determine what he will do it is thought
he will he able to gtFe the President a
lunite answer the day he comes here or
soon afterward.
Should Mr. Manley not aecept .e offer
the Pr?sident will lose no- time in appoint
ing John W. Yerk(s of Kentucky. This is
now well understood among the Kentueki
an.s, as well as among the West Virginia.10
who hve been hopeful of landing a man
from their state. Repres?ntative Pugh of
Kentucky saw the President today to add
his request for Mr. Yt-rkes' appointment.
According to) the Kentucky returning,
boards, Mr. Pugh was defeated for Con
grF-ss in the November election by several
hundr,.l votes. His opponent was a popu
-lar young democrat named Keyhoe. The
repulAican leaders are urging Mr. Pugh to
make a contest. He has not deckteri on
what c.ourse he will pursue, but the repub
licans believe a contest will seat Mr. Peigh.
Nebraska Club Ratification.
A committee from the Nebraska Repub
lican Club- of Washington called on thes
President today and Invited him to attend
the eiub's meet-ing on Friday night, when the

Representative Brumm of Pennsylvania.
The Pennsylvania people want a position
for Mr. Brumm, and want the President to
take care of him. The President is willing
to do something for Mfr. Brumm, but will
have to look around for a place.
Mr. Brumm wanted to be chief of the bu
reau of engratving and printing, but the
President did not care to remove that posh
t.ion from the civil service for Mr. Brumm-s
benefit.

the White House a few minutes before noon
to attend the marriage of Miss Mary Mc
Comas and Clinton Goodloe Edgar, at St.
John's Church.
Executive Clemency Extended.
The President. has granted several par
dons. Five of the cases are from the In
dian territory. Four of the men pardoned
were convicted of horse stealtng and
were invariably sentenced to the minimum
penalty prescribed by law for this offense
live years in prison. The Attorney General
considers this sentence excessive for the
cr;me and always recommends pardon. The
five mutn granted pardon under these cir
Cumstances were Andrew Gilbert, John
Luppy, Blunt Martin, John Pool and Thos.
Tudor. The four first named stole horses
and Tudor stole a saddle worth $20. For
this he went to prison for five years. Most
of the prisoners have served half of the
term.
The President also pardoned Marion
Whelhhel and John B. Kimsey, Georgia
moonshiners, who were convicted of dally
ing with whisky making in violation of law.
Since he was sentenced in March Whelchel
has been stricken with paralysis. Kimsey's
"wife and children are in dest.tute circum
stances and his help is needed to care for
them.
* THE ARMY CANTEEN.
Reorganization Bill Forbids Liquor
Sellingr by Any One in the Service.
The caiteen provision in the new army
bill is likely to cause a great deal of con
tention. InAead of being a prohibition of
the sale of liquor, It provides that no army
oflieer or soldier shall sell liquor. The pro
vision Is as follows: "That io officer or
private soldier shall sell intoxicating drinks
of. any kind. as a bartender or otherwise.
in any army past or on any army transport
or in any encamipment or fort or on any
premie.s used for military purpose by the
Inited States,' and the Secretary ul War
is hereby directed to issue such general
or<1er as may be necessary to -carry the
provisions of this section ito full force
and effect."
The Vanteen povision of the present law
is as fbllowp: "That no officer or private
soldier shall be detailed to sell intoxicating
drinks. as a battender or otherwise, i1 any
post. exchange or canteen, nor shall any
oither person be required or allowed to sell
such liquors in any encampment or fort
or on any premises used for military pur
poses by the United States, and the bee
retary of War is hereby directed to. issue
such general order as may be necessary
to carry the provisions of this section into
full force and effect.

ARMY BILL TAKEN UP
Special Order Adopted by the
House.
EIPLANTION AHE BY R HULL
Two Hours Given Each Side for
General Debate.
CONSIDERING CANAL TREATY
Before the House of Representativep met
today the republican leaders decided to
proceed today with the army reorganisa
tion bill, which Chairman Hull of the mili
tary committee reported yesterday.
When the House met the Speaker an
nounced that he had a communication
from the family of Mr. Boutelle of Maine,
resigning his position as chairman of the
committee on naval affairs. He also an
nounced the appointment of Mr. Shaw of
New York as a member of the committee
on Invalid pensions. Mr. Dalzell (Pa.).
from the committee on rules. thin pre
sented the following special order for the
(onsideration of the army bill: "Resolved,
ti,at Immediately after the adoption of th!s
resolution the House shall resoilve itself
into committee of the whole on the state
of the Union to consider Senate bill 4:00),
'An act to increase the eiticitncy of the
military establishment of the United
States.' This rule is not to interferi- with
other special orders."
Mr. Dalzell. explaining the necessity for
the immediate consideration of the army
bill. pointed out the fact that July 1. 1901,
under the present law, the army would be
reduced to 2C0-less than half the num
ber now in the Philippines. Legislation of
some character was imperative, and the
department urged the necessity of haste.
It would take time to recruit and organ
ize the new army which must replaf e the
old.
Objection of the Minolity.
Mr. Richardson (Tenn.), on behalf --f the
minority, said those on his side of the
House recognized the necessity for some
legislation. but they did not agree that this
bill, establishing a permanent stainding
army, should become a law. If an emer
gency exists an emergency should be pro
vided for, a large standing army should
not be established. He would not take
time, he said. to rention all the oh,noxious
features of the bill. But one was funla
mental. It was propcsed to provide an
army which could be expanded at the will
of one man from 58,000 to 14140At. No mat
ter how good or able that man might be he
was not willing to see one -man given such
iowe-r. It was, in his opinion, abdicating
the functions of Congress.
Mr. Richardson said he was ready at all
times to vote to put down rebellin any
where and everywhere that it existed, but
under the stress of an emergency he was
nzt willing to establish permanently a large
standing army.
Mr. Underwood (Ala.) also inveighed
against clothing the President with discre
tionary power to expand or -centract the
army at will.
Favors a Large Standing Ay.
Mr. Grosvenor (Ohio), In support of the
resolution, said that personally he was in
favor of a standing army of W1.0tt men.
The people, he said, were not frightened
when a demagogue said that the purpose In
increasing the army was to station large
regiments near large cities to oppress labor.
They were not alarmed by the cries that
their liberty was to be subverted. As for
the opposition to the "slid.ng scale," the
President always had practically been su
preme in the use of the army. Why should
he not in the use of his discretion have
the power in time of necess.ty to expand te
army? It was a glorious tr.bute to our sys
tem that never had the President of the
United States attempted to abuse his peower
over the army. One of the magnificent acts
of Grover Cleveland had been his assump
tion of his duty to keep the peace in a
great commonwealth by means eof the
United States army when the governor of
that state did not want him to interfere.
Mr. Grosvenor said if there had been a
standang army cf 50,000 loyal men at tre
battle of Bull Run the rebellion would have
ended in thirty days..
Mr. Grosvenor and Mr. Underwood in
dulged in some sharp cross-tiring, after
which the resolution was adopted without
d ivisMion.
Mr. Hull. who was in charge of the bill.
and Mr. Sulzer (N.Y.), on behalf of the mi
nority, then arranged that general debate
should run for four hours, two hours on a
side, and that then the bill should be con
sidered under the five-minute rule. The
agreement was rati!led by the House.
Mr. Hull suggested that the oleomargarine
bill, which was a special order for tomor
row, be- postp~oned until the army bIll was
dlisposed of.
Th's request aroused the friends andl oppa
nents of the latter bill, lest postponement
of the order would give one side or the
other a tactical parliamentary ad vantage,
and Mr. Underwood finally objected.
The House then went into committee of
the whole (Mr. Dtalzeil of Penn-ylvania in
the chair) and took up the consideration of
the army bill.
Statement by Mr. Hull.
Mr. Hull made the opening statement. He,
explained i'he details of the bill, which, he
said, followed practic'aily the scheme al-,
ready tw'ice indorsed by the House of Rep
re-sentatives.
The main objection he had heard to the
organiza.tlon proposed was to the alleged
preponderating influence of the cavalry.
T.h'is, he sa'd, was necessary, because of
the effectiveness of cavalry in operations in
the Philippines. In concluding hIs state
tnent Mr. Hull ridiculed the charges made
luring the recent campailgn by the oppost
Lion to the effect that the republican party'
lesired to fo!st upon the country a great
standing army.
Treatment of Volunteer Omeer.
Mr. Hepburn (Iowa) asked what provislen
he bill made for the transfer of volunteer
fficers to the regular army.
Mr. Hull replied that in the staff volun
:eer officers could be appointed to the regu
ar army without regard to age or grada,
>ut in the line volunteer officers could not
e appointed above the grade of first lieu
enant, and then only when below the age
f th'irty.
Mr. Hepburn asked if Mr. Hull would ob
ect to an amendment providing that ye
:ancies below the grade of colonel oould be
Uled from the list of volunteer officers. and
Leclaring it, to be the prpose of the act to
tlace volunteer officers commilssioned sinee
Lpril 19. 181)8, upon, the same foot.ng wit h
tificers of the regular army.
"I should say,"~ responded Mr. Hull, "tio
typoint volunteer offieer. to the grade of
niajor would do a great injustice to regu
ar anny officers who have served twenty
er t.wenty-Ave years in the army."
Oppened to a Lage Itandlmar Army-.
Mr. Cochran (Mo.), who followed Mr. Hull,
ntr'oduced the political phase of the que'
Ion. He charged that the avowed purpose
if the administration to use an army of
0.400 to enforce its mandaias in the Phi'- E
ppfne. was the very esence of imperial -
sor. He declared it to be4thi. opinion that
1o army that anarched on the face. of the
oh a Wet 'u
Mr 5s m s) aammmmA s eaaler
