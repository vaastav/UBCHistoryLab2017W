The Legitimacy of Mining.
The wise men in the East, some of
whom have grown Immensely wealthy
out of the mines, are crying down
the prescut inclination of the Kasl to
buy mining shares. What Is the
matter? Is It pure philanthropy on
their part? Have they some railway
shares or shares In the Whiskey
Trust or the Bee! Trust, or some
other of the innumerable trusts of
the East, which they wish to unload
at a profit? Have tire men who have
gambled in the shares of any enter
prise they have offered them grown
so rich that they are satlslied and
are willing to let their neighbors get
rich? Or are they turning to mining
with a thought that at least some
mines turn out well and that is let
ter than anything they have tried
while all the great trusts have been
floated?
We want to tell them a secret. Ex
cept a few in the great cities, they
none of them had any money to buy
stocks with until the steady flow of
the money from the mines of the
West vitalized their business, gave
them the credit to build railroads,
which enabled them to market their
products, and generally do a live bus
iness. „ ,
Cbina has no end of rich soil, the
biggest coal and iron mines in the
world, bnt the masses of the people
are awfully poor. Why? Because
they have no money to help them
selves, no transportation facilities,
no means to make their iron and coal
available. Hence with them It has
been a struggle of food, a light
against famine for throe thousand
years.
Now all the money that there is in
the world came out of mines; all
that there ever will be will have to
come from the mines. The dream of
the old alchemists of transmuting
base metals into gold has never been
realized, and there Is no prospect ot
Its ever being realized.

President Roosevelt's message to »»
congress is notable In at least one
particular—it Is accredited with lie
ing the longest document of like
character In recent years. Alter the
preliminary felicitations he savs:
1 again recommend a law prohib
iting all corporations from contrib
uting to the campaign expanses of
any party. Such h bill has already
passed one house of congress. Let
individuals contribute as thev desire;
but let us prohibit in effective fash
ion all corporations from making
contributions tor any political pur
pose, directly or indirectly."
lie recommends a law giving the
government the right of appeal in
criminal eases, for the purpose of
reaching trust magnates In criminal
proceedings, and also to allow the
government to get a decision on the
Constitutionality of acts declared un
constitutional by a lower court.
He admits the abuse of power of
Injunction, and wants Its use
st rioted as much as possible, but
thinks it unwise to prohibit It alto
get her. In this connection he quotes
an opinion of Judge Win. 11. Taft,
which follows:
"The opportunity freely and pub
licly to criticise judicial action is of
vastly more importance to the Isxiy
politic than the Immunity of courts
and judges from unjust aspersions
and attacks. Nothing lends more to
render Judges careful In their deci
sions and anxiously solicitous to do
exact justice than tiro consciousness
that every act of theirs is to tie sub
jected to the intelligent scrutiny and
candid criticism of I heir lellow-men.
Such criticism is beneficial In pro
portion as it is fair, dispassionate,
discriminating, and based on n
knowledge of sound legal principles.
The comments made by learned text
writers and by the acute editors of
the various law reviews upon Judicial
at
in
a
decisions are therefore highly useful
Such critics constitute more or less
Impartial tribunals of professional
opinion before which each judgment
is made b> stand or full on its liter
Its, and thus exert a slroug influence
to secure uniformity of decision.
»»V-.- ..............
But non-professional criticism also is j
by no means without its uses, even :
If accompanied, at It often Is, by a '
direct attack upon the Judicial lair
ness and motives or the occupants of |
the bench; for if the law Is but e* j
sence of common sense, the protest j
of many average men may evidence
a defect In a Judicial conclusion, |
though based cn the nicest legal rea
soning and profoundest learning. |
The two Important elements of mor
al character In a Judge are an earnest
desire to enforce it. In so iar as
fear of public comment does not af
fi-ct tlm courage of a Judge, but only
spurs him on to search his conscience
and to resell the result which ap
proves itself to Ills inmost heart,
such comment serves a useful pur
pose. There are few men, wnether
they are judges foi life or for a short
er term, who do not prefer to earn
and hold the respect of all,
can not be reached and madi
and delllierate hy hostile publie criti
cism. In the case of Judges having
lire tenure, indeed, their very In
andwbO
to pause
dependence makes the right freely to
comment on their decisions of
greater Importance, because ll is

in recommending that Ute punish

at death, he says:
"In connection witli the delays of

prevalence of crime among us, and
above all to the epidemic of lynching
and mob violence that spring up,

plement this by whatever legislation
will add speed and certainty In the
execution of I lie Ian. When we deal
with lynching even more is neces
sary. A great many white men are
lynohed, but the crime Is pecularly
frequent In respect Ur black men.
The greatest existing cause of lynch
ing is the perpetration, especially by
black men, of the hideous crime of
rape—the most abominable in all the
category of crimes, even w,,rae than
murder. Mobs frequently avenge
the commission of this crime by
themselves torturing to death the
man committing it; thus avenging
in bestial fashion a bestial deed, and
reducing themselves to a level with

for rape they speedily extend the
sphere for their operations and lyuch
for many other kinds of crimes, so
that two-thirds of the lynohlngs are
not for rape at all; while a consider
able proportion of the indvlduals
lynched are Innocent of ull crime
Governor t'handler, ol Geoiglu
stated on one occasion some years
ago: "l can say at a verity that

the lives of half a dozen innocent
negroes who were pursued by the
mob, and brought them to trial In h
