The republican party began its career
as a party of progress It was n party of
great moral ideas and reforms , 4\5 such
it rallied around its standard the pro
grosairo elements who did not vouornt0
old entnbliehott institutions because they
tvaro founded by the fathers of the ro
public. The party has now Leap in power
twntytbrco years. The refarnm's who
led it fu its vigorous youth kayo passed
a way , and many of its surviving lenders
nrpmoss Gackod bourbons , who imagine
t hat the only miasan of the republican

kind of 1)ourbontsm. It insists u1)o n

This is liho fitting the jacket of the boy

its mission will soon boauded. Ithas hoer

BRVISIN(1 THIJ LAND LAIVS.
The present congress appears doter.
mined to make A thorough revision of the
lend lass. A uumbar of bills have iii.
ready been introduced in both houses to
reserve rho remaining domain of tits Un-
i ted States for actual settlers. T'ho most
s weeping reforms in existing land laws
have beau devised by Senator Ingalls , of
jCnnsaq , Thrgq 1ills } relating to public
lands , introduced by Senator Ingalli , arc
designed to materially simplify the opor
otters o [ the gcuarnl land ollico , anti
change several important particulars in
rho method of ncgniring title to public
lands , The first provides for the repeal
of the pro omptimt laws , but authorizes
a second homestead entry by persons
who , lhaviug rondo ono homestead entry ,
have for any reason failed to perfect the
title , curl who , at the same time , Hover
rnada n filing under the 1)reomptiom act ,
The second repeals ( ho timber-culture
law , but Permits title to be perfected in
accordance tvttlt the provision of that law
111)011 all claims mitered borate the puts -
sego of iho rapoaling nat. The third an ds
lest of alto antics propose s
to amend the homestead ac t
by prohibiting comtnuintiat tlnm aundc
until two years have elapsed from th
ditto of settlement , ono year of w hicl I
must be of record in the land office. I t
also repeals rho provision law untlor tvhicl n
local laud ollhces are authorized to nests I
ralinquiahnents and immediately thros
rho clnima ralinquishcll open to entry , I'
oll'cet , it requires all ralinquiehmmnts t o
be forwarded to ( ho commissioner of tIn
general land tGlco and approved by hi m
before the land in question is thrown t
opor to entry. The effect of this sari0 e
of measures , if they become laws , will b °
to limit thin amount o [ public lard n sin
gin individual can aacuro to one claim o f
1110 scree , Land may be secured af to :
two years' actual residence thereon 1)3
paying Sl 25 per acre , or attar five years
residence for nothing. The provision it t
respect to raliuiquislimcnts is designed t °
put n atop to the practice of filing ontriu s
upon puhlfa lands and huhliug finest ( o r

every representative from this aectiul t
should heartily support. It is n notoriou s
