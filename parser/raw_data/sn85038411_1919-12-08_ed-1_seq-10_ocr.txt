REVISION
SYSTEMATIC study of the con
stitution of Pennsylvania, to
which amendments have been
■proposed by the dozen in the last
decade, will be inaugurated to-inor
. row at the State' Capitol by the
Constitutional Revision Commission
•of twenty -five recently named by
Covernor William G. Sproul. Few
■documents have . been as much
bused and criticised and even villi
fied in the press and on the ros
trum, in court rooms and legislative
Balls, ss the present organic law,
and altl ough generally believed to j
be in certain features not In ac- ;
cord with "modern thought" it has ,
not wanted for defenders who have
* steadfastly demanded to be shown
t.he faults.
Six times the constitution has
been amended and a dozen tlmas
unsuccessful attempts have been
- made to change it Many of the
propositions were outcropplngs of
the desire of the peoplo for changes,
, some were purely political and
eome were of individual origin.
- Since the legislative session of 1913
there have been expressions favor
ing everything from certain speci
fied amendments to a new conslitu,
tion. In the last Legislature over a
score of proposed amendments ap
peared.
Wisely, Governor Sproul de
termined to have the constitution
, studied and in response the Legis
lature provided for a commission to
prepare for its consideration in 1921
amendments deemed essential for
the welfare of the Commonwealth.
It is this commission, occupying a
■unique position in matters pertain
ing to preparation of law and close
ly, watched by students of govern
ment all over the country, that will
meet hero to-morrow. The Gov
ernor selected its members from his
ripe experience in State affairs 'and
wide knowledge of its people, plac-
ins at its head ope of the ablest
lawyers of the State, a student of
the constitution and thoroughly in
touch with the needs of the hour.
Few bodies have been given a
more splendid opportunity to be of
service to the Commonwealth and.
the recommendations when they
• come next year will represent best
1. in effort.
Skirts are to be shorter next year,
•the dressmakers say. Why not trim
the waists with a ruffe and be done
with it?
THE WHY OF IT
rpHKRK is a reason for the victor-
I ious field, track and football
teams turned out by the Tech
nical High School the past few
years, and it lies primarily In the
recreational facilities offered by the
. park department of the city to Har
rlsburg boys and girls.
Back of the splendid physiques,
> unusual strength, agility and endur
ance of the Technical High School
students are years of activity and
careful training in the parks and
(Playgrounds of the city. It Is not'
generally known, but Harrlsburg is
far ahead of most cities of its size;
In this respect and leads many larger '
cities. For years the municipal play
ground, baseball diamonds, tennis
courts, track and football fields have
given to the boys of liarrisburg op
portunity for physical development
" and training In outdoor sports, and
they have taken full advantage of
the opportunities offered.
This means that Harrlsburg boys
and girls who have bad like chance
to Improve their bodies, even though
they do not rank as athletes, are
bigger and better able to fight life's
battiee because of their truining on
the playgrounds. The money spent
• has been well worth while.
Borne times there are those in pub
lie places who do 'not gee the Wis
dom Of making large expenditures
MONDAY EVENING,
for park and playground purposes.
For such as these the foregoing
facts should be interesting and help
ful.
Do you remember the good old days
when we used to have an egg every
morning for breakfast and complain
if the cook didn't prepare two?
WE MUST SOLVE IT
THE City Club of Philadelphia
wrestled a whole afternoon
with the high cost of living
problem not long since and while
many interesting lights were cast on
the situation the whole thing finally
resolved itself down to the indi
vidual. If we were more careful
about what wc put on our backs and
into our stomachs, experts in econo
my told the club, prices could be
considerably reduced without injur
ing the general prosperity.
There can be no doubt that the
general plcntitude of money has
been in a way responsible for pres
ent high living costs. Instead of
saving our increases in pay, most of
us have put the additional money
into expensive clothes and costly
dishes for the' table. Regardless of
our purses we have bought the
clothing that lias appealed to us,
even though it has been beyond our
means, and we have indulged in
our fondness for rich foods to the
exclusion of cheaper articles of diet.
This has caused prices to go
higher than otherwise they would,
even with the war and the resulting
scarcity of food and clothing. The
City Club is tight. If prices are to
go down the remedy must come
from us. 'We must use less and pro
duce more.
j "BREEDING BOLSHEVISTS"
UJs'DER the caption, "Breed
ing Bolshevists," the current
issue of the magazine. "In
The Open," official organ of the Wild
Life League, protests against the
closing of streams and wild land to
the fisherman and the hunter. "In
the Open" would widen the privilege
of angling and gunning, but at the
same time would have the Legisla
ture enact a new trespass law,
which, while protecting the rights
of the people to iish and hunt,
would at the same time absolutely
protect tho rights of land owners
by providing proper punishment of
those who damage property. Con
tinuing the editorial quoted says:
The land-owner who, for his
own private pleasure or that of
his friends, thus confiscates the
property of ail the people -is
as dangerous an enemy to these
I'nited States as the Bolshevist,
who preaches on the street cor
ner the doctrine that the work
ingmen should control the indus
tries to the-exclusion of the real
owners of the plants. In fact
HE IS A BOLSHEVIST in princi
ple and in action, for lie him
self is participating actively in
a wholesale confiscation of other
people's property, which Is
neither lawful nor American.
In misusing a mere statute to
violate the constitution of the
great Commonwealth of Henn
vania, to steal from the people
their rights, to set aside for
himself and his associates the
sole light to take the game, for
the protection and increase of
which all the sportsmen of the
state have been paying a special
tax. he has made of himself an
inciter of Bolshevism. .
The statute, which is being
used as a cloak to these thefts
of public rights and liberties.
Is to-day the most unpopular law
on tile hooks and IT MLbl BE
MODIFIED AT ONCE.
The writer makes a good point.
The constitution of the State of
i Pennsylvania says that the fish and
| game belong to the people, and that
I being so they should have every op
j portunity to hunt and fish. We had
| an example of the selfishness of eer
| tain owners in Dauphin county last
j Spring when an effort was made to
close the best piece of bunting and
fishing land in Central Pennsylvania
on the flimsy pretext of protecting
a water supply. The effort failed,
but it illustrates the constant vigil
ance the people must use to prevent
invasion of their constitutional
rights.
In Pennsylvania we have much
wild land and many streams that
are'fit only to provide a day's sport
for the lover of trout fishing. In
addition, we spend of dol
lars each year for the propagation of
fish and game and tho stocking of
the streams and the woods. This
must be for the benefit of all the
people, and no such methods as
those used in " Europe, where im
mense "preserves are maintained for
the use of the rich to the exclusion
of the poor, will ever prevail here.
The Wild Life league, is right. The
fishing and hunting privilege must
lie widened rather than narrowed
and if the present trespass law stands
in the way then it must give way
and be replaced by another that will
protect the rights of all concerned.
Restrictions of the rights of fishing
and hunting would breed discon
tent as few other forms of repres
sion, selfishness and greed would be
likely to do, if the people would
I stand for a of that kind,
, which they won't.
JIK WROTE IT
THE Scran ton Times, defender of J
the Democratic faith in its sec- !
I tion of Pennsylvania, begins a
'long editorial designed to prove tliat
President Wilson really wrote the j
latest message to Congress with this |
paragraph:
That testy old dame. -Gossipy
Slander, la busy once more. JCow
she asks, chiefly through Grand
Old Party organs, whether Wil
son wrote his message or whether |
somebody did it for him.
Dear Times, the Telegraph,for one, j
never for a mbment doubted that I
Mr. Wilson wrote the message which I
wait sent to Congress over his name. '
As a ready letter writer the present j
occupant of the White House has no:
equal among his contemporaries. If
some really constructive ideas had
been mixed with the oodles of ver
biage that constituted the document
In question our suspicions might
have been aroused. Put since the
whole message was made up of glit- '
tering generalities, couched in
terms to win public approval, but
without any well thought out plan
,to solve the problem of State and •
society now confronting the govern- j
ment, we know it for Mr. Wilson's
and in his very best style, at that.
T>ezCco uv
By the Ex-Committeeman
Municipal politics is back in its
Playground after something like a
month's vacation, and judging from
what is being printed in the news
papers of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
Scranton and Heading considerably
more thought is being given to local
affairs than to the approach of the
u" e for c ' rc 'ulating petitions for the
May primary or the meetings of the
Nationul councils of the two big par
ties. Changes of administration oc
cur in Philadelphia and two-thirds
of the third-class cities next month,
and in Scranton there will be new
councilmen. Furthermore, the
changes in county offices will be pro
ductive of some feelings in various
counties.
Defeat of the Babcock-Leslie com
bination by the election of Augustus
K. Oliver to the vacancy in the Pitts
burgh council may have far-reaching
effect, it was noticeable that M. M.
Garland, who seconded the Barbour
nomination favored by the Pitts
burgh mayor, was careful to say that
he considered both Messrs. Oliver
and Barbour good men and further
more the councilmen made it unani
mous. From ail accounts, the ele
ment of surprise entered into the
selection of Mr. Oliver. Mayor Bab
cock has been talked of as" possible
gubernatorial timber.
In the other second-class city cer
tain of the new councilmen have
launched a move to take away some
plums from Mayor W. T. Connell.
but the mayor is rather used to that
pastime and the chances are that he
will not suffer. Much attention is
being gi vert in Scranton to the candi
dacy of C. 1.. Council for congres
sional honors on the part of the
Republicans.
—Mayor-elect J. Hampton Moore
went to the center of the political
stage on Saturday night at Philadel
phia when he made what some of
the newspapers style a reply to the
"defiance" of Senator Edwin 11.
Yare, holding that the Moore refer
ences of intention to do things for
Philadelphia and determination to
hit "and hit hard" if attempts were
made to block him meant that he
would not tolerate a fight op his
aspirations to the political leadership
of his city for four years.
—The Philadelphia Record and
North American say that the mayor
elect served notice that he would not
tolerate Interference and that the
Vares are in for a fight if they try
to block him. The Press also takes
a fighting view and in another
article says the new mayor denies
making up a slate of officers for
council and then adds thatv Burch,
an independent and a friend or the
mayor, is likely to win. In discuss
ing Mr. Moore's speech, the In
quirer says lie "apparently deter
mined to make his position regarding
the leadership and control of the
Republican party liere for. the next
four years clearly understood by
friend and foe alike. The dramatic
qualities of the Moore speech were
sensed rather than asserted. The
utterances were spectacular, and
their portent was neither misunder
stood by the political foemen of the
mayor-elect nor misinterpreted by
the guests from without the city. Re
garding local conditiorts and the
work of the administration during
the next four years, he wus equally
emphatic. He said that factional
politics and interna! fighting, which
he declared he .would seek to avoid,
had destroyed the prestige of tlie city
throughout the country and had
brought the birthplace of the Nation
into disrepute."
—Reading is just now one of the
most interesting political centers in
the State and botli the Eagle and
the Herald devote much space to
the situation. Mayor John K. Stauf
fer. Republican, seems disposed to
paddle his own canoe and some tests
of civil service tliird-class city laws
are expected. The Democratic fac
tions are at odds on city and county
matters and have fights looming up
for legislative nominations. Reading
fins also to yvorli to keep Socialists
down and to be. ready to swing into
the second-class city list in 1921. On
top of it all one member of the b-.id-
I get bourd says he will not meet with
another because he is an officer of a
gas company.
—Democratic State machine lead
ers working to avoid tights over se
lection of National delegates have
been given a jolt by the lights loom
ing up in the Lackawanna and
Schuylkill districts. They have de
termined to fight Congressman Ar
thur O. Dewait. of Allontown, who
has started to fight them ami now
face a delegate row. In Schuylkill
Judge H. O. Beehtel will be opposed
for delegate, while there will be a
fight on the Lynett-O'Brien ticket in
Lackawanna.
—The Philadelphia Ledger says
regarding the Republican National
Committee meeting: "Politicians
here expect that the address of Gov
ernor Sproul. of Pennsylvania, to be
made at the opening session, will be
one of the most important declara
tions to be made before that body.
It is said that Governor Sproul has
been in close touch with Mr Hays
for several weeks and that what he
has to say will very largely repre
sent the opinions of the National
chairman. Among the declarations
that the committee is expected to
make will be one for economy on (lie
part of the Government, a position
I already forecast by attacks that have
I been made 011 this yeur's estimates
j in both houses of Congress."
I —The Philadelphia Press prints I
this comment upon State polities
i possibilities, written by Odell Mauser;
"Traces of a tendency toward a new
I lineup in State politics, which in
i volvcs Senator Penrose, Governor
I Sproul, Senator Crow, the Vares, and
j the Grundy Interests as the prin
| c.ipal figures, were noticeable in the
last session of the Legislature,
j though they never crystallized into
anything definite. If the Grundy fight
on Senator Crow is carried through i
I it may have the effect of forcing a
show-down on this alignment, In
which ease the Vares would be one
ot the important elements and would
re-enter into the position of Impor
| tance in State polities they lost when i
I Governor Brumbaugh went out of I
j office."
i —Col. E. M. Young, the Allen
i town banker, will be a candidate for

Literary Notes
Further publications of the Penn I
Publication Company's Juveniles
are: 1
"Don Hale With the Flying i
Squadron," by W. Crispin Sheppard,
being the third volume in the ex
periences of that intrepid young
American. This deals with the late
war.
"Kent of Malvern" is Truxton
Hare's newest book and will be
eagerly read by his many admirers. |
This is the fourth book about Philip
Kent, a student who makes, good in
classroom and on the sporting field.
"Red Ben the Fox of Oak Ridge,"
is the second book of animal
stories by Joseph Whaton Lippin
cott, whose "Bun —A Wild Rabbit"
was so successful last year. This
book is readable by boys and girls
of all ages and by parents also. It
is a veracious account of the fox
who seems to enjoy being hunted.
"The Little Red Soldier," by
Anna Franclii, is a book for thq
smaller ones, those who enjoy pic
tures and prefer to have the stories
read to them. It is the charming
account of a lead soldier—French
—and the tale of his apocryphal
experiences is really symbolic of the
poilu of France who saved civiliza
tion from disaster.
"Fighting With the I*. S. Army,"
by Captain Charles A. Botsford, C.
H. F., is the story of two brave boys
who went from an academy to the
front and had exciting experiences.
The story is told by one who was
there and may be considered au
thentic.
"The Story of .Porcelain," by Sara
Ware Bassett, is another in the
series, which, when complete, will
tell young folks about all of the
principal industries. These books
are written by experts, but in sim
ple fashion and are as instructive
as they are entertaining.
Publications by Lolhrop, Lee and
Shepard Company are:
"The Boy With the U. S. Trap
pers," by Francis Rolt-Wheeler,
which is an exciting account of
hunting wild game under the
proper auspices This lad goes
with members of the Government
Biological Survey, who are out not
to destroy wild animals, but to help
them grow in numbers.
"The Good Cheer Book," by
Blanche E. Herbert, is just what its
name implies. It contains nearly
400 pages of poems and prose ex
tracts from the best authors and all
arranged under various headings.
The idea is to bring to children and
older persons some, of the finest
messages of literature. There is
humor and gaiety and many an
other good thought to be found in
a book which mothers and teachers
will find especially helpful.

Is there shop where he comes not

Or any book he stoops not down

Or song he sings not? Or a golden

Each word stirs up a hundred
echoes dim
Of one he said. Like scene of dusk

Each day spills some new memory
down the air.
And each night ioofs another dream
of him.
What of a road where he has never
come ?
All ways have him. for house and

If they be not, then am I stricken
dumb,
Their ache of fairness makes his

SEES PANIC UNLESS
BUYING ORGIE ENDS
IT IS predicted by William A. Day,
president of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society, that unless tho
American people check their pres
ent habits of extravagance and sub
stitute therefor reasonable thrift and
economy, some such catastrophe as
the panic which followed the Civil
War is certain to overtake them.
Mr. Day Issued his warning at the
annual convention of the Associa
tion of Life Insurance Presidents at
the Hotel Astor. His address was
devoted principally to a discussion ,
of the significance of the increasing
volume of life insurance, but while
he explained that prosperity as a
result of the war has increased the
amount of life, insurance to $7,712,-
000,000, or $"3,010,000,000 more in
1019 than was written in 1918, he
said "the other side of the shield"
showed that general extravagance is
out of all proportion to the thrift
indicated by the purchase of new
insurance policies.
"It is true," he said, "that our
National wealth has increased as
measured in dollars, but this is
largely due to the fact that the evi
dence of wealth has Increased at a
greater rate than the wealth it rep
resents.
"The war thrust upon us an un
natural and unbalanced prosperity
and left us a legacy of inflation,
speculation and improvidence. A
large volume of easy money has
found its way into the National
Treasury and into the pockets of
many people to whom a substantial
cash surplus was a new and tempt
ing possession. There has followed
among those of improvident and
self-indulgent tendencies a passion
l'or expenditure, the pursuit of pleas
ure and the purchase of costly non
essentials, without parallel in history. I
Production Drops Behind
"As a result of the labor shortage
and other war conditions, our prod
ucts have been consumed faster
than we could produce them. Stocks
on hand were reduced or exhausted.
The high prices which inevitably fol
lowed but served to whet the appe
tite of the spendthrift. He protests
as vigorously as the provident man
against the high cost of the necessi
ties of life, but he eagerly pays high
prices for luxuries and other non
essentials, and for early service he
is often willing to pay a premium
above the market price. -
"There has, as every one knows,
been an extraordinary increase in
the price of musical instruments, au
tomobiles, precious stones, furs, silks
and other costly articles of adorn-j
ment, and in the cost of travel and j
amusement, and of fancy foods, candy, j
etc. There are so many people with i
surplus cash who are buying these j
and other expensive luxuries that
the figures of the aggregate sales
Since the armistice would—if they
were available—stagger belief.
"The war almost stopped the con
struction of homes, and prosperity
has caused many people to seek
more expensive quarters. Thus we
find rents reaching exorbitant fig
ures, but many people who cunnot
afford it prefer to pay them rather
than to live in more modest quarters.
"Many thousands of good men who
I have been hoping for years for a
chance to lay by a snug sum each
j month now have that chance, but
Ithey have been seized with the spend
jing mania. They have the illusion
that this golden flow will continue
I permanently and that they will live
j forever to enjoy it.
Spending Craze Spreads
I "Our wasteful spending is not
looming alone from current earnings,
i Many who under ordinary circum
stances would not thipk of indulg
ing in extravagance tre joining In
| this craze to spend,
i "Why wait for adversity to teach
us this' lesson ns we did after our
great civil war? A period of infla

' prices followed that war. The ex
traordinary demand for labor had
■ Increased wages abnormally. A
frenzy of extravagance seized people

a few were willing: to save their sur
plus earnings.
"Our people were Anally brought
to their senses by the great panic
of 1873, which resulted in immense
losses, the prostration of business
and an enormous army of unem
ployed people, all of which finally
led to the great railroad strike and
the acts of pillage and destruction
fo 187 7.
"Our battle -with Improvidence, at
least for the Immediate future, must
be planned with due regard for all
these extraordinary conditions. With
so many people abandoning the sav
ing habit and spending what they
have for pleasure and luxury, with
production far behind the heavily
increasing demand, with a labor
shortage and no sign of alleviating
It —with these and other factors still
operating to maintain the high cost
of living, the imperative need of the
hour is an extraordinary effort to
spread the gospel of thrift and sav
ing among the people."
The convention of life insurance
officials at which Mr. Day spoke dis
cussed the housing problem, the agri
cultural situation, the state of rail
roads and street railways and the I
relation of the funds of insurance
policyholders to all of them.

Kindness
If only all of us were kind.
In thought and action, we would find
This world would more of joy suf
fice,
Than any dreamed-of paradise.
No traveler would find his way
A weary way; no toiler's day
Would and in bitterness or pain
From feeling that it was in vain. |
No grief would come but it would
bring
iTrue sympathy to hpal the sting, !
And every sorrow would be shrined |
In sweetest thoughts, if all were
kind.
If only you alone were kind
In thought and action, you would
find
Full half the grievances you feel
Are all unfounded and unreal,
For thing? most beautiful and good,
By unkind eyes misunderstood,
Appear so full of base alloy
The gazer misses half their joy,
Full half the happiness you know
From your own heart must overflow
And fill with swedt your life and
mind
Or else your world will seem unkind.
—Lee Shipley.
Month of Holidays
I December, taking the world over,
j is a month of bank and public holi
days. No less than 20 of the 31
days of the month are recognized
somewhere as occasions for church
fetes or cessation of business in
celebration of local or national
events.
Christmas, of course, is more
widely observed as a holiday than
any other, but even it is not recog
nized everywhere. Non-Christian
peoples pay no attention to it and in
countries where the Greek Catholic
church prevails the old style Julian
| calendar is used, so that, while
i Christmas is observed as a church
j festival, it comes about two weeks
later than in countries that use the
Gregorian calendar and therefore
| does not occur until in January, as
] we count time.
Social Duties Neglected
lFrom the Boston Transcript.]
A little girl had been taken to
phurch for the first time, and she
was somewhat surprised by the gen
eral style of the building, which
was quite unlike anything she had
previously seen.
"Wh6se house is this?" she asked.
"It is God's house,' 'her mother
answered. The child took another
critical view of the building.
"It is a very nice house," she fln
i ally soliloquized. "We have never
called hore before."
President's Misfit Appointees
[From the Philadelphia Inquirer.]
An esteemed contemporary, which
cannot be suspected of the least in
clination to be censorious where the
President or his administration is
concerned, plaintively remarks in a
recent issue that "President Wilson
has been responsible for any number
of mislits in his selection of men
charged with the work of enforcing
the law of the country." Truer
words were never spoken. Nor
have his misilt appointments been
strictly confined to that category.
His blunders of the kind have been
numerous beyond recall and egre
gious beyond comparison.
They begun almost coincidently
with his first inauguration and they
have uninterruptedly continued. Itj
will hardly have been forgotten how, I
when he embarked on his Mexican!
policy of "watchful waiting," he sent j
as his confidential agent to survey:
the situation and advise him with.
regard to it, a man in the person j
of John Hind, ex-Goverqor of Min-;
! nesota, who knew nothing of the \
I Spanish language, who was wholly
j without diplomatic experience and
I whose only known qualifications for
1 the Job consisted in his being n
I friend of William J. Bryan and a
I "deserving Democrat."
: What Hind did and reported has
never been disclosed, but if the na
ture of the advice he gave may be
I inferred from what the President
i did. it must have been bad indeed. It
I seems to have occurred to Mr. Wil
| son that IJnd had his limitations,
I and that perhaps he had better dls
j patch another emissary to look the
I land ove,r and acquaint him with the
lay of It; and upon whom this time,
did his choice fall? Upon none
other than the William Bayard Hale,
who was subsequently to reappear
upon the scene as a llun sympathi
ser and as a publicity agent for the
German Government, and whose
Mexican appointment had been a
mystery to those who were best ac
quainted with his character and his
record.
During his stay in Paris the Pre
sident's peculiar predilection for the
employment on confidential errands
of persons who in ordinary life
would bo vulgarly described as
cranks was repeatedly exemplified.
One of the two men whom he
named to attend the aborted Prlnk
ipo conference was George Davis
Herron, an ex-professor, who was
obliged to resign from the College
of lowa because the trustees disap
proved of the peculiar doctrines
which he was inculcating.
Some months later it occurred to
the President that he would like to
get some private information about
the situation at Petrograd; and
whom did he select to secure it?
William C. Bullitt and Lincoln Stef
fens, two men whose known opinions
were such that they might safely be
trusted to picture the Bolsheviki in
the most favorable light possible.
Another case in point is that of Fred
erick Howe, the President's selec
tion for Immigration Commissioner
at New York city, the exhibition of
whose protective sympathy for all
kinds of dangerous cranks and an
archists has been a recent news sen
sation.
In the choice of his subordinates
Mr. Wilson, to say the least, lias been
singularly unhappy.
Man, Not Town
[From tho Pittsburgh Dispatch.]
The idea that nearly all the "big"
men come from the small towns has
been Industriously disseminated for
many years, but a census of a rep
resentative group of 100 well known
men In the New York financial dis
trict, reported in the National Bank
of Commerce monthly, does not bear
it out. It was true that 60 per cent,
came from outside New York, but,
taken by towns, it was found that
just, as many came from cities with a
million or more population as came
from towns with less than 6,000 peo
ple. Fifty-one came from towns
under 100,000 population, another
remarkable breaking even.
If this analysis proves anything, it
shows that the man has much more
to do with "getting there" than the
town he came from, which, of course,
everyone who gave any thought to
the matter expected. The "big men
from the small towns" was simply
one of those superficial notions that
get by because nobody stops to an
alyze them. It was flattering to the
bulk of the population who live out
!side New York that the metropolis
| had no monopoly of opportunity. But
who supposed it had?
Bill White Is Suspicious
[W. A. White In the Emporia
Gazette.]
Henry Allen, governor of Kansas,
is about to get his. In about four
days or less the Democratic admin
istration at Washington will see in
him a formidable candidate for the
ticket, and then the Democratic ad
ministration will suddenly wake up.
To get coal? Not at all .but to
| spike Henry Allen. Some sort of a
tangle will be developed between
I the state government and the Fed
eral Government, probably through
I the railroads, which will stop the dis-
I tribution of coal in Kansas. The
, Federal administration will have the
last say, and Allen will be stopped.
This will be a great Democratic
victory .
Watch 'cm spike him .
Jesus Becomes a Nazarene
When Herod the king was dead,
behold, an angel of the Lord ap
peareth in a dream to Joseph in
Egypt, saying. Arise, and take the
young child and his mother, and go
into the land of Israel. And he came
and dwelt in a city called Nazareth;
that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets. He shall l>e
called a Nazarine. Matthew ii,
19 to 23.

Tho first constitutional conven

The Pennsylvania Constitutional
Revision Commission, which will
begin its deliberations preliminary
, l< i '^"""mending*to the legislature
of 19-1 its ideas for changes to the
basic law of the Htate, will be thu
fust important body in the State gov
to havo women in its mem- •
bership. This is the first recognition
in an official way of the fact that
women will have the same voting
powe' as men in the governmental
affairs of the Commonwealth. Mrs
Barclay H. Warburton, of Philadel-
PiVt Jm v, rS> John °- Miller, of
Pittsburgh .appointed by Governor '
' , ( '* Sproul as the representa
tives of the coming voters, will rank
the it"?*® 5"„ th ®' Attorne y General of
- States when it conies to '
passing formally upon propositions
lor changes in the constitution. Both C
are women of unusually extended ex
perience in public affairs and fami
liar with the state governmental
( - on sidering the fact that
° „ ncver been any women
members of the legislature or of
h?Lve .tf n ? V' dt , only in recent years
have the ladies been given represen
tation on State boards and commis
sions. this is all the more striking
to people at the Cupitol. As far as
known, there never was even a sug
gestion of a woman for delegate to
any of the constitutional conventions
nL P ',°?s Sl l for wh '°b the peo
ple of the State declined to authorize
early in the nineties. Owing to the
presence of women on the Commis
sion, which was not expected bv
'" an y men in Polities, the work of
the Pennsylvania board will lo
watched with as much interest out- 9
*5 t !\ e state a!i will the ].lan of
riav ing: the proposed amendments
thought out for the Bcgislature to
discuss.
• *
Under the provisions of the act
creating the Commission, it may rec
ommend addtion to, alteration or
omission of any section, being
charged with the duty of consider
ing the document in the "light of
modern thought." There lias been
110 general plan outlined except that
work will be started promptly to
morrow*. The idea of Attorney Gen -
• eral William T. Schaffer,- designated .
by the Governor as the chairman, is
to have the. Commission organize
after a formal opening, at which sur
vivors of the constitutional conven
tion of 1873 and State officials will
be guests, the public being invited
and thrt-e being no cards of admis
sion. All sessions of the Commis
sion will be open and all will bo
stenographically reported just as a
legislative session. The dignity of
a session of the General Assembly
will surround the open meetings anil
at the inauguration of the session
the Secretary of the Commonwealth
will formally present the appoint
ments. It is probable that Mr.
Schaffer, as the representative of the
Governor, will outline some of the
work to be done, although tut ffir as k
the subject matter of the constitu
tion Is concerned that, will be left
to the committees to disc uss. While
word has come here of one or two
drafts of a whole new constitution
and of very exhaustive amendments,
they are the work of individuals not
connected with the Commission. No
general program has been prepared
by the State. The Legislature did
not provide for one, although when
the bill creating the Commission
passed it was generally understood k
that the amendments proposed in '
the score or more of resolutions ap
pearing each session lately should be
referred to the body. Organization
of the Commission will be effected
through committees. When the of
ficers are selected and rules outlined,
and there will be as few as possible
of the latter, the Commission will
provide for committees on related
subjects and begin work. Addresses,
presentation of the necessary docu
ments and such other ceremonies as
may take place, will not occupy
much over an hour and it is the
hope of the Attorney General to
have such sections as should he al
lowed to stand to be reported upon.
The opening declaration, or "Bill of
Rights," will probably be the first
matter to be considered in open ses
sion.
The recommendations of the Com
mission cannot reach the people be
fore 1924, so it Is held here that
there is ample time for considera
tion of them and that the plan of al
lowing years to pass between pre
sentation and action will be thor
oughly safeguarded. The legisla
ture of 1919 gave, in effect, author
ity to this Commission to make up a
report for the session of 1921 upon
j the necessity of changes to the or-
I ganic law. The Commission must
report to the Begisaturo that will bo .
elected in November of 1920, which
will bo a presidential election as
well, and when the sentiment of
1 the people will be thoroughly mani
fested. Any recommendation that '
1 fails to pass Ihc Hegislature of 1921
; will fall, as the amendment, clause
' of the constitution provides that
• proposals for amendment, must pass
> two successive Hegislaturcs in identi
■ cal form before going to the people,
• The action of the session of 192^will
■ also have a very definite influence on
the amendments. It may reject any
thing that was passed by that of
1921. Furthermore, this Legislature
will be charged with the duty of
providing for the submission of the
, amendments to the people. This sys
. them of checks and provision for
i study in the most deliberate way is
added to by the ruling of the At
j torney General's Department twice
j within a year that, constitutional
; amendments may be submitted only
, at general elections. This means
, only In even-numbered years. The
_ elections in odd-numbered years, un
der the provisions of the constitu
tional amendments of 1919, concern
only county and municipal officials
and questions, unless when a judge
of the appellate courts is to bo
' chosen.
Among the first steps will be io
I recommend changes to accord with
, the Federal Constitution, including
woman suffrage. One of the most (
important subjects for consideration
will be taxation, and it SViil be given
i to a committee which will likely con
sider the. graded tax and other
amendments dealing with this vital
r matter. Local government, classt
lication of counties und munlcipall
ties and] similar topics will likely*
_ have much attention. Under a plnn
discussed, the Commission will meet
f this and next week and then adjourn
over the holidays, reconvening in
January and remaining at work until
it completes its study and outlines a
program when its members can listen |
to suggestions. This will have th
effect of keeping the Commission un
disturbed during its preliminary
I work and enabling persons desiring
to submit ideas to appear and speak
some time during the winter. ,
In the matter of cost, the revision
of the State Constitution will prol*
nbly take unusual rank. Only s<;<>,#
000 has been appropriated for all ex
penses. The members will receive
what they outlav for actual expenses
] and no more. New York Bta|c spent
- a million dollars on its constitution- j
II making convention recently and thes
it fell by the wayside.
