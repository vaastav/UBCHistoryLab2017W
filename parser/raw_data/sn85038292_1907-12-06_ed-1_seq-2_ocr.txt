The Democratic Advocate. ’
WESTMINSTER. MD.
~~ 1
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 6,1907 ,
NOTICE TO DIRECTORS.
The Directors of the Democratic Advocate
Company will meet at the Democratic Advo
cate Office on Monday, December 9, at 10.30
a. m., for the considering of business to be
laid before them.
James H. Bii.lixgslea, President.
Corrupt Practices Law.
One of the most important planks in the
platform of the Democratic State Conven
tion was that whicli pledges the parly to
the enactment of a Corrupt Pratices Law.
This law is aimed at the suppression, and
if possible the total extinction of bribery
at our elections.
If this can be done, and there is no
reason why it may not be accomplished, it
will work a revolution in the politics of our
Stole. Nothing has ever before appeared
in the politics of Maryland that has so
degraded our electorate as the corrupt use
of money at our elections.
It is impossible to measure this demor
alization, and the extent to which it has
gone. Men, who in times past, would
have vigorously resented the barest inti
mation that they would sell their votes,
can now be seen, on election day, standing
around the poling places waiting for the
highest bidder.
Can any one imagine a greater crime
against our free institutions, than the buy
ing and selling of votes; putting up that
which should be considered the dearest
right of our American citizenship, to be
auctioned off to the man who will give the
highest price?
And another effect of this degrading
practice is, that it shuts out from holding
prominent, public office, those who have
not large means, or who are not in touch
with the Corruption Fund.
Under this vicious system of political
management, no matter how brainy or how
capable a man may be, if ho has not mon
ey, or having it, is not willing to use it in
buying votes, he is handicapped in his
effort to hold public office. This ought not
to be, and the Democratic party is pledged
to enact a law that will, as far as possible,
prevent it. The party is to be commended
for this advanced step in the direction of
good government and of good morals.
Now it is up to the coming legislature,
to carry out, in good faith, this pledge,
and to carry it out in the spirit in which
the people understand it. They want this
nefarious business of buying and selling
votes stopped, as far as it can be done by
an honestly framed law.
Our legislators can depend upon it that j
no monkeying with this subject will he
tolerated by the people. They are in dead
earnest about it, and will watch the course
of their representatives with the keenest
interest.
The Congress.
The sixtieth Congress convened on Mon
day last. The President’s message was
sent in on Tuesday and is a voluminous
document, written in true Rooseveltian
style, and ringing from bottom to top with
the idea of more power for the federal
government. This has been the key note
of all the utterances of Mr. Roosevelt for
some time, and he seems determined to
impress them uoonthe American people.
The Democratic party and a great many Re
publicans regard this as a dangerous politi
cal heresy, and we do not believe the
country can ever be brought to adopt or
even favor these radical ideas, so foreign
to the very genious of our constitution.
Academy of Music.
Baltimore theatre goers and book-readers,
who have read the famous“Brewsters”millions
story,G.Barr McCutcheon’s fascinating novel,
will be delighted with the announcement that
the dramatic version ol the book will be pre
sented at the Academy of Music, Baltimore,
next week, with matinees Wednesday and
Saturday. The entire cast and production
that assisted in winning fame and success for
the play during its long runs in New York and
Chicago, will be seen here.
It can be asserted without exaggeration
that the production will be one of the most
enjoyable of the season, and large audiences
are expected for each of the performances.
The compulsory dissipation of a million dol
lars in one year by Montgomery Brewster has
made the whole country laugh.
The claim is justly made that the ship scene
with the storm at sea, in the third act, com
pletely overshadows any other stage picture
ever presented. Frederic Thompson, the man
ager and proprietor of the attraction, has
amply demonstrated the fact in his produc
tions of “A Society Circus” and “A Yankee
Circuaon Mars,”at the NewYorkHippodrome,
tnat he is the greatest living master of startling
stage illusions that this country has yet pro
duced. In the great third-act scene of
‘.‘Brewster’s Millions,” Mr. Thompson has, by
the skilful manipulation of mechanical and
electrical effects, produced the illusion of angry
waves mountain-high, so perfectly presented
and carried out that the audience cau easily
imagine itself on ship-board.
The company presenting “Brewster's Mill
ions” in Baltimore, includes Edward Abeles
in the stellar role, Mary Ryan, Emily Lytton,
Rosalind Coghlan, Grace Arnold, Albert
Sackett, Joseph Woodburu, Jack Devereaux,
Nestor Lennon, Willard Howe and more than
twenty others of prominence on the stage.
For the Advocate.
A Reply from Carrollton.
The false alarm of fire on Thanksgiving
night as mentioned in the locals of last week’s
issue djd not only alarm and bring to the
Fire Hall the citizens of the village of Carroll
ton, but owing to the calmness of the night the
sound reached Westminster and brought from
that city merchants and reporters. After
finding it was a false alarm they concluded to
take advantage ofthe occasion and gogunning.
When they had traveled for some distance
they succeeded in starting a bunny in a corn
field of one of our farmers near the village.
After a considerable amount of shooting they
bagged their game, but it is said they did not
leave enough sound pumpkins in the patch to
make a Christmas pie. In order to make all
right it took them until a late hour before they
started for their native town. Hearing a train
whistle nearing the suburbs of the village they
dropped their light and again aroused the
villagers by the hasty retreat of their foot
steps. After a short investigation the farmers
found their hen roosts unmolested, so they
passed the remainder of the night undisturbed.
The bunny was delivered next day by special
delivery, and judging from the decorations it
looked more like a Teddy Bear returning from
a Fourth of July parade than a bunny. We
have no doubt after having it undressed and
dressed and laid away in Talcum powder for ]
a few hours it made a delicious dish. <
