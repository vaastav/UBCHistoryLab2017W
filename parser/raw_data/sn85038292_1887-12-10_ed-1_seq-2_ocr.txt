He has approached the subject
reform with a boldness that is
in these days of time-serving
Hnidity, pointing out the dangers of alur-
Ikt pursuance of the present governmental
Policy, and advocating a readjustment and
levision of the tariff, so as to reduce the
receipts to an amount corresponding to the
needs of an economically administered
government.

Prohibition Sustained by the IT. S.
• Supreme Court.
Au important decision, and one that will
be far-reaching in its consequences, was
rendered by the United States'Supreme
- Court on Monday in the so-called Kansas
Prohibition cases of Mugler against the
State of Kansas, and the State of Kansas
11 against Ziebold and others. The judgment
e of the Court was pronounced by Justice
t Harlan, who said :
“The general question in each case is
- whether the Prohibition statutes of Kansas
are in conflict with that clause of the four
teenth amendment which provides that |no
i- State shall make or enforce any law which
e shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States; nor shall any
11 State deprive any person of his life, liberty or
property without due process of law.’ ”
y The Court affirms the right of any
State to prohibit the manufacture and sale
. of intoxicating beverages that prejudicially
. affect the rights and interests of the com
j muuity, and that the legislature has the
f power to afford such protection. It also
1, declares that the State has power to pro
s hibit such manufacture for private use,
s otherwise the whole scheme of prohibition
i would fail.
It was contended that property specially
prepared for breweries, when license pre
ii vailed, is now either totally useless or
i 3 greatly impaired in value. Upon this
t point the Court says :
s All property in this country is held under
r the implied obligation that the owners’ use of
5 it “shall not be injurious to the equal enjoy
■ ment of others having an equal right to the
J enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to
the rights of the community. The power
I which the States unquestionably have of pro
e hibiting such use by individuals of their prop
erty as will be prejudicial to the health, the
' morals or the safety of the public, is not —and,
1 consistently with the existence of organized
society, could not be—burdened with the
condition that the State mast compensate
, such individual owners for pecuniary losses
they sustain by reason of their not being per
-3 milled, by a noxious use of their property, to
s inflict injury upon the community of which
they form a part. The exercise of the pelice
power by the destruction of property which
r is itself a public nuisance, or the prohibition
g of its use in a particular way whereby its value
becomes depreciated, is very different from
I taking property for public use or from depriv
ing a person of his property without due pro-
cess of law.”
f Hon. F. T. Shaw on the Message.
0
|j Among the many Senators and Rep
resentatives interviewed on the message of
President Cleveland, was Hon Frank T.
e : Shaw, of this city, our Representative in
s j the lower House. He said—
t “The President has marked out u line of
, policy which the rank and file of the Derao
| cratic party can follow without fear as to the
a result. The message is the language of the
• patriot and not of the partisan. It discloses
Y ! a correct knowledge and the fullest apprecia-
II i tion of the dangers which beset our financial
j J condition. It wisely says ‘lt will not do to
; neglect the situation because its dangers are
■s 1 not now palpably imminent,’ for they only
await the occasion when they may be precip
’ ! itated upon us. Whilst the message not only
- ! plainly sets forth the gravity of the situation,
the means of relief suggested are eminently
wise and conservative. A radical reduction
■ I of the duties imposed upon the necessaries of
) ■ life and the extension of the free list are re
’ commended, and should receive the approval
'• ; of everyone who has a proper regard for the
public weal. Whatever may betide, the Pres
ident has come up to the full measure of his
• duty, and if Congress fritters away its lime in
f ciuarreling over the theories of protection and
, free trade, neglectful of the crisis that is upon
s I us, and disaster follow, the responsibility must
1 rest, in the language of the President, ‘where
e i it belongs.’ ”
Senator Palmer, of Michigan, advises the
Republican party to espouse prohibition,
1 He thinks it “absolutely imperative” io have
1 “some great moral or. sendobeutal issue to
hold the party together.” A generation
has grown up for which the war issues have
lost interest, and “the tariff alone won’t
do.” Hence, in the Senators opinion, the
necessity of a question “that appeals to the
- homes and the hearts of the people of this
t country like the temperance question.”
I He believes that, within six years, the party
3 will be compelled to adopt prohibition as a
- National issue. The Republicau party will
i not live six years, and when it adopts Pro
> hibition the present members of the party
- will not all rally under that banner.
? It may be set down to the credit of the
- I Cleveland Administration that up to Oc
i j tober Ist no less than 45,6(13,394 acres
have been restored to the public domain,
1 from railroads and other corporations that
2 had secured them illegally under Republi
; can rule, and proceedings have been insti
e tuted for the restoration of more than nine
t millions more. These restored lands, in
1 the aggregate four times greater than the
r area of Maryland, and nearly equal to that
-of Pennsylvania, will now be thrown open
- to bona fide settlers.
f The Republican National executive com
i- mittec met in Washington on Thursday and

i- and when the convention meets will raise
a hurrah for the Plumed Knight that is

THE PmDENT’S MESSAGE!
CONFINED TO THE SURPLUS.
Ho Says the Tariff Must be Revised.
To Hu Conyress of the United States:
You are confronted at the threshold of
your legislative duties with a condition of the
national finances which imperatively demands
immediate and careful consideration. The
amount of money annually exacted, through
the operation of present laws, from the in
dustries and necessities of the people, largely
exceeds the sura necessary to meet the ex
penses of the government.
When we consider that the theory of our
institutions guarantees to every citizen the
full enjoyment ef all the fruits of his industry
and enterprise, with only such deduction as
may be his share towards the careful and eco
nomical maintenance of the government
which protects him, it is plain that the ex
action of more than this is indefensible extor
tion, and a culpable betrayal of American
fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted
upon those who bear the burden of national
taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a
brood of evil consequences. The public
treasury, which should only exist as a conduit
conveying the people’s tribute to its legiti
mate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoard
ing-place for money needlessly withdrawn
from trade and the people’s use, thus cripp
ling our national 'energies, suspending our
country’s development, preventing invest
ment in productive enterprise, threatening
financial disturbance, and inviting schemes ot
public plunder.
This condition of our treasury is not alto
gether new; and it has more than once of late
been submitted to the people’s representa
tives in the Congress, who alone can apply a
remedy. And yet the situation still contin
ues, with aggravated incidents, more than
ever presaging financial convulsion and wide
spread disaster. It will not do to neglect this
situation because its dangers are not now
palpably imminent and apparent. They exist
none the less certainly, and await the unfore
seen and unexpected occasion when suddenly
they will be precipitated upon us.
On the 30tn day of June, 1385, the excess
of revenues over public expenditures after
complying with the annual requirement of
the sinking-fund act was $17,859,735.84; dur
ing the year ended June 30, 1886, such
excess amounted to $49,405,545.20, and
during the year ended June 30, 1887, it
reached the sum of $55,567,849.54.
The annual contributions to the sinking
fund during the three years above specified,
amounting in the aggregate to $138,058,320.-
94 and deducted from the surplus as stated,
were made by calling in for that purpose
outstanding three per cent, bonds of the,
government.
j During the six months prior to June 30,
1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large
by repeated accumulations, and it was feared
the withdrawal of this great sum of money
needed by the people, would so affect the
business of the country, that the sura of
$79,894,100 of such surplus was applied to
the payment of the principal and interest of
the 3 per cent, bonds still outstanding, and
which were then payable at the option of the
government.
The precarious condition of financial af
fairs among the people ritill needing relief,
immediately after the 30th day f June, 1877,
the remainder of the three per cent, bonds
then outstanding, amounting with principal
and interest to the sura of $18,877,500, were
called in and applied to the sinking-fund
contribution fc- the current fiscal year.
Notwithstanding these operations of the
Treasury Department representations of dis
tress in business circles not only continued
but increased, and absolute peril seemed at
hand.
In these circumstances the contribution to
the sinking fund for the current fiscal year
was at ©nee complete by the expenditure of
$27,684,283.55 in the purchase of government
bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4J per cent,
interest, the premium paid thereon averag
ing about 24 per cent, for the former and 8
per cent, for the latter.
in addition to this the interest accruing
during the current year upon the outstanding
bonded indebtedness of the government was
to some extent anticipated, and bunks
selected as depositories of public money were
permitted to somewhat increase the deposits.
THE ACCUMULATING SURPLUS.
While the expedients thus employed, to
release to the people the mouey lying idle in
the Treasury, served to avert immediate
danger, our surplus reranutyhave 'continued'
to accumulate, the excess for the present
year amounting on the Ist day of December
to $55,258,701,19, and estimated to reach the
sum of $113,000,000 on the 30th of June
next, at which date it is expected that this
sum added to prior accumulations, will swell
the surplus in the Treasury to $140,000,000.
There seems to be no assurance that, with
such a withdrawal from use of the people's
circulating medium, our business community
may not in the near future be subjected to
the same distress which was quite lately pro
duced from the same cause. And while the
functions of our National Treasury should be
few and simple and while its best condition
would be reached, I believe, by its entire dis
connection with private business interests, yet
when, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly
holds money uselessly subtracted from the
channels of trade, there seems to be reason
for the claim that some legitimate means
should be devised by the Government to re
store in an emergency, without waste or ex
travagance, such money to its place among
the people.
If such an emergency arises there now ex
ists no clear and undoubted executive power
of relief. Heretofore the redemption of three
per cent, bonds, which were payable at the
option of the Goverment, has afforded a means
for the disbursement of the excess of our rev
enues; but these bonds have all been retired,
and there are ne bonds outstanding the pay
ment of which we have the right to insist
upon. The contribution to the sinking fund
which furnishes the occasion for expenditure
in the purchase of bonds has been already
made for the current year, so that there is no
outlet in that direction,
THE POWER TO DISTRIBUTE THE SURPLUS.
In the present state of legislation the only
pretense of any existing executive power to
restore, at this time, any part of our surplus
revenues to the people by its expenditure
consists in the supposition that the Secretary
of the Treasury may enter the market and
purchase the bonds of the government not yet
due, at a rate of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
power could be derived is found in an appro
priation bill passed a number of years ago;
and it is subject to the suspicion that it was
intended as temporary and limited in its ap
plication, instead of conferring a continuing
discretion and authority.
No condition ought to exist which would
justify the grant of power to a single official,
upon his judgment of its necessity, to with
hold from or release to the business of the
people, in an unusual manner, money held in
the Treasury, and thus affect, at his will, the
financial situation of the country; and if it is
deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of the
Treasury the authority in the present juncture
to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vest
ed, and provided, as far as possible, with such
checks and limitations as will define this offi
cial’s right and discretion, and at the same
time relieve him from undue respousinility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating in the Treas
, ury, it should be borne in mind that premiums
must of course be paid upon such purchase,
that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investments which cannot be pur
chased at any price, and that combinations
among holders who are willing to sell, may
unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds
to the Government.
It has been suggested that the present
bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate
of interest, and the difference between the old
and new security paid in cash, thus finding
use for the surplus in the treasury. The suc
cess of this plan, it is apparent, must depend
upon the volition of the holders of the present
, bonds, and it is not entirely certain that the
inducement which must be offered them would
result in more financial benefit to the govern
ment than the purchase of bonds, while the
latter proposition would reduce the principal
of the debt by actual payment instead of ex
tending it.
The proposition to deposit the money held
. by the government in banks throughout the
country, for use by the people, is, it seems to
me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as
. establishing too close a relationship between
the operations of the government treasury
. and the business of the country, and too ex
tensive a commingling of their money, thus
fostering an unnatural alliance in private bus
iness upon public funds. If this scheme
should be adopted it should only be done as
a temporary expedient to meet an urgent ne
cessity. Legislative and executive effort
should generally be in the opposite direction
and should have a tendency to divorce, as
much and as fast as can safely be done, the
5 treasury department from private enterprise.
EXTRAVAGANT APPROPRIATIONS.
Of course it is not expected that unneces
sary and extravagant appropriations will be
made for the purpose of avoiding the accu
- mutation of an excess of revenue. Such ex
j penditnre, beside the demoralization of all
just conceptions of public duty which it en
> tails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvi-
I dence not in the least consistent with the
! mission of our people or the high and benefi
cent purposes of our government.
I have deemed it my duty to thus brim; to
the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as
to the attention of their representatives
I, charged with the responsibility of legislative
relief, the gravity of our financial situation.
The failure of the Congress heretofore to pro
vide against the dangers which it was quite
>f evident the very nature of the difficulty must
e necessarily produce, caused a condition of
s financial distress and apprehension since your
c last adjournment which taxed to the utmost
h all the authority and expedients within exe
i- cutive control and these appear now to be ex
y hausted. If disaster results from the contin
;- ued inaction of Congress the responsibility
must rest where it belongs,
r Though the situation thu? far considered is
e fraught with danger which should be fully
y realized, and though it presents features of
■s wrpng to the people as well as peril to the
'■ country, it is but a result growing out of n
it perfectly palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing the same alarming cir
cumstances —a congested national treasury
n and a depleted monetary condition in the
d business of the country. It need hardly be
d stated that while the present situation de
a mands a remedy, we can only be saved from
c a like predicament in the future by the re
it moval of its cause.
i- Our scheme of taxation, by means of which
this needless surplus is taken from the people
n and put into the public treasury, consists of a
tariff or duty levied upon importations from
r abroad, and internal revenue taxes levied
>* upon the consumption of tobacco and spirit
% ous and malt liquors. It must be conceded
f that none of the things subjected to internal
revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, neces
saries; there appears to be no just complaint
e of this taxation by the consumers of these
• articles, and there seems to be nothing so well
a able to bear the burden without hardship to
any portion of the people.
n THE PRESENT TARIFF LAWS.
’ But our present tariff laws, the vicious,
J inequitable, and illogical source of onneces
t sary taxation, ougiit to be at once revised and
amended. These laws, as their primary and
_ plain effect, raise the price to consumers of
y all articles imported and subject to duty, by'
g precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus
the amount of the duty measures the tax paid
f by those who purchase for use these im
ported articles.
Many of these things, however, are raised
or manufactured in our own country, and the
t duties now levied upon foreign goods and
products are called protection to these home
manufacturers, because they render it possi
• ble for those of our people who are manufac
’ turers to make these taxed articles and sell
them for a price equal to that demanded for
’ the imported goods that have paid customs
J duty. So it happens that while comparatively
a few use the imported articles, millions of
, our people, who never use and never saw any
’ of the foreign products, purchase and use
I things of the same kind made in this country,
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same en
\ hanced price which the duty adds to the im
r ported articles. Those who buy imports pay
' the duty charged thereon into the public
f treasury, but the great majority of our citi
j zens, who buy domestic articles of the same
class pay a sura at least approximately equal
to this duty to the home manufacturer. This
- reference to the operation of our tariff laws is
- not made byway of instruction, but in order
’ that we may be constantly reminded of the
’ manner in which they impose a burden upon
I those who consume domestic products, as well
as those who consume imported articles, and
*j thus create a lax upon all our people.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the
’ country of this taxation. It must be exten
| sivcly continued as the source of the goveru-
I merit's income, and in a readjustment of our
. tariff the interests of American labor engaged
in manufacture should be carefully consider
ed, as well as the preservation of our manu
facturers. It may be called protection, or by
.. any other name, but relief from the hardships
, and dangers of our present tariff laws should
be devised with especial precaution against
imperiling the existence of our manufacturing
interests. But this existence should not
mean a condition which, without regard to
t the public welfare or a national exigency.
\ must always insure the realization of immense
\ profits instead of moderately profitable re
turns. As the volume and diversity of our
® national activities increase, new recruits are
3 added to those who desire a continuation of
the advantages which they conceive the pres
ent system of tariff taxation directly affords
j them. So stubbornly have all efforts to re
-1 form the present condition been resisted by
2 those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged that
they" C3D hardly complain of the suspicion,
t entertained to a WrfaTn'e'sctofit',~that
r exits an organized combination all along the
3 line to maintain their advantage.
3 We are in the midst of centennial celebra
< tions, and with becoming pride we rejoice in ,
1 American skill and ingenuity, in American !
energy and enterprise, and in the wonderful
i natural advantages and resources developed
> by a century’s national growth. Yet when
r an attempt is made to justify a scheme which
) permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer
in the land for the benefit of our manufacture
: era, quite beyond a reasonable demand for
; governmental regard, it suits the purposes of
1 advocacy to call our manufactures infant in
dustries, still needing the highest and greatest
t degree of favor and fostering care that ban be
y wrung from Federal legislation.
3 It is also said that the increase in the price
\ of domestic manufactures resulting from the
s present tariff is necessary in order that higher
• wages may be paid to our workingmen em
ployed in manufactories, than are paid for
r what is called the pauper labor of Europe.
All will acknowledge the force of an augument
■ which involves the welfare an 1 liberal com
r pensation of our laboring people. Our labor,
2 is honorable in the eyes of every American
i citizen, and ns it lies at the foundation of our
s development and progress it is entitled, with
- out affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost
, regard. The standard of our laborers’ life
■ should not be measured by that of any other
t country less favored, and they are entitled to
1 their full share of all our advantages.
EMPLOYMENTS OF THE PEOPLE.
By the last census it is made to appear i
3 that of the 17,392,099 of our population en- j
gaged in all kinds of industries 7,070,493 are |
employed in agricultural, 4,074,238 in pro- j
f fessioual and personal service, (2,934,870 of I
3 whom are domestic servants and laborers,) }
i while 1,810,250 are employed in trade and |
i transportation, and 3,837,112 are classed as ,
r employed in manufacturing and mining.
I For present purposes, however, the last
t number given should be considerably reduc
. ed. Without attempting to enumerate all, it
i will be conceded that there should be deduct
- ed from those which it includes 375,143 car
; penters and joiners, 285,401 milliners, dress
s ; makers, and seamstresses, 172,720 black
- j smiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 102,-
j i 473 masons, 76,211 butchers, 41,309 bakers,
22,083 plasterers, and 4,891 engaged in man
] i ufactunng agricultural implements, amount*
, ing in the aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving
2,023,089 persons employed in such manufac
-3 luring industries as are claimed to be bene-
D filed by a high tariff.
e To these the appeal is made to save their
s employment and maintain their wages by re
-13 sisting a change. There should be no dlspo
e sition to answer such suggestions by the al
legation that they are in a minority among
ii those who labor, and therefore should forego
- an advantage, in the interest of low prices for
B the majority; their compensation, as it may be
affected by the operation of tariff laws, should
g at all times be scrupulously kept in view, and
u yet with alight reflection they will not over
look the fact that they are consumers with
8 the rest; that they, too. have their own wants
i, and those of their families to supply from
s their earnings, and that the price of the neces
saries of life, as well as the amount of their
s wages, will regulate the measure of their wel
(r fare and comfort.
s But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to necessitate
t or justify either the loss of employmenthy the
e working man nor the lessening of his wages;
;1 and the profits still remaining to the raauu
g facturer, after a necessary readjustment,
’- should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of
d the interest of his employees either in oppor
t tunity to work or in the diminution of their
e compensation. Nor can the worker in man
d ufactures fail to understand that while a high
i- tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the
e payment of remunerative wages, it certainly
d results in a very large increase in the price of
■early all sorts of manufactures, which, in
almost countless forms, he needs for the use
d of himself and his family. He receives at the
e desk of his employer bis wages and perhaps
o before he reaches his home is obliged, in a
s purchase for family use of an article which
a embraces his own labor, to return in the pay
y meat of the increase in price which the tariff
:- permits, the hard earned compensation of
s many days of toil.
OPPOSE!) TO THE TARIFF ON WOOL.
The farmer and the agriculturist who man
, ufacture nothing, but who pay the increased
price which the tariff imposes upon every
n agricultural implement, upon all he wears and
upon all he uses and owns, except the in
crease of his flocks and herds and such things
, as his husbandry produces from the soil, is in
vited to aid in maintaining the present situa
tion; and he is told that a high duty on im
j- ported wool is necessary for the benefit of
e those who have sheep to shear, in order that
i- the price of their wool may be increased.
:- They *of course are not reminded that the
II farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme
i- obliged, in his purchases of clothing and
i- woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow
3 farmer as well as to the manufacturer and
■ merchant; nor is any mention made of the fact
that the sheep owners themselves and their
• households, must wear clothing and use other
s articles manufactured from the wool they sell
i at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must
- return their share of this increased price to
the tradesman.
I think it may be fairly assumed that a large
i proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers
t throughout the country are found in small
r flocks numbering from twenty-five to fifty,
r The duty on the grade of imported wool which
- these sheep yield is ten cents each pound if
-of the value of thirty cents or less, and twelve
• cents if of the value of more than thirty cents.
- If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allow
-7 ed for each fleece, the duty tnereon would be
sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be
i taken as the utmost enhancement of its price
7 to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eigh
1’ teen dollars would thus represent the increas
s ed price of the wool from twenty-five sheep,
i and at thirty-six dollars that from the wool
of fifty sheep, and at present values this ad
- dition would amount to about one-third of its
7 price. If upon its sale the farmer receives
J this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his
i hands charged with precisely that sum, which
in all its charges will adhere to it, until it
i reaches the consumer. When manufactured
into cloth and other goods and material for
use, its cost is not only increased to the ex
i tent of the fanner’s tariff profit, but a further
i sum has been added for the benefit of the
i manufacturer under the operation of other
i tariff laws. In the mean time the day arrives
1 when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase
woolen goods and material to clothe himself
1 and family for the winter. When he faces
1 the tradesman for that purpose be discovers
- that he is obliged not only to return in the
t way of increased prices, his tariff profit on the
3 wool be sold, and which then perhaps lies
I before him in manufactured form, but that he
) must add a considerable sura thereto to meet
a further increase in cost caused by a tariff
duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end
he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon
’ a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff
i scheme, which, when he sold his wool seem
j ed so profitable, an increase in price more
p than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff
i-profit he received upon the wool he produced
( and sold.
I When the number of farmers engaged in
wool raising is compared with all the farmers
i in the country, and the small proportion they
i bear to our population is considered; when it
, is made apparent that, ia the case of a large
I part of those who own sheep, the benefit of
the present tariff on wool is illusory, and,
above all, when it must be conceded that the
increase of the cost of living caused by such
[ tariff becomes a burden upon those with
moderate means and the poor, the employed
and unemployed, the sicls and well, and the
’ young and old, and that it coustitutes a tax
which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon
the clothing of every man, woman and child
[ in the laud, reasons are suggested why the re
-5 , moval or reduction of this duty should be in
[ ! eluded in a revision of our tariff laws.
. | COST TO CONSUMERS,
r * In speaking of the increased cost to the
; consumer of our home manufacturers, result
• ing from a duty laid upon imported articles of
i the same description, the fact is not overlooked
1 that competition among our domestic produ
-5 cers sometimes has the effect of keeping the
$ price of their products below the highest limit
r allowed by such duty. But it is notorious
; that this competition is too often strangled by
i combinations quite prevalent at this time, and
I frequently called trusts, which have for their
I object the regulation of the supply and price
of commodities made and sold by members of
s the combination. The people cun hardly
hope for any consideration in the operation
of these selfish schemes.
If, however, in the absence of such com
-1 bination, a healthy and free competition re
duces the price of any particular dutiable
article of home production below the limit
which it raightotherwise reach under our tariff
i laws, and if, with such reduced price, its
manufacture continues to thrive, it is entirely
evident that one thing has been discovered
; which should be carefully scrutinized in an
; effoit to reduce taxation.
• The necessity of combination to maintain
the price of any commodity to the tariff point
furnishes proof that some one is willing to
accept lower prices for such commodity, and
• that such prices are remunerative; and lower
prices produced by competition prove the
same thing. Thus where either of these con
ditions exist, a case would seem to be pro- J
sented for an easy redaction of taxation.
The considerations which have, been pre
sented touching our tariff lay? are intended
. only to enforce anjiarpust recommendation
that the surplus Avenues of the government
r Be prevented by the reduction of our customs
: duties, and, at the same time, to emphasize a
suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose
wo may discharge a double duty to our peo
. pie by granting to them a measure of relief
! from tariff taxation in quarters where it is
most needed and from sources where it can be
1 most fairly and justly accorded.
Nor can the presentation made of such con
i siderations be, with any degree of fairness,
• regarded as evidence of unfriendliness toward
our manufacturing interests, or of any lack of
■ , appreciation of their value and importance. }
These interests constitute a leading and
most substantial element of our national
. greatness and furnish the proud proof of our
i country’s progress. But if in the emergency
that presses upon us our manufacturers are
asked to surrender something for the public
good and to avert disaster, their patriotism,
■ as well as a grateful recognition of advantages
already afforded, should lead them to willing
co-operation. No demand is made that they
shall forego all the benefits of governmental
; regard; but they cannot fail to be admonished
of their duty, as well as their enlightened
| self-interest and safety, when they are remind
ed of the fact that financial panic and col
lapse, to which the present condition tends,
afford no greater shelter or protection to our
manufacturers than to our other important
enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful
and deliberate reform Is now offered, and
none of us should be unmindful of the time
when the abused and irritated people, heedless
| of those who have resisted timely and reason
i able relief, may insist upon a radical and
! sweeping rectification of their wrongs.
DIFFICULTY OF REVISING THE TARIFF.
j The difficulty attending a wise and fair re
-1 vision of our tariff laws is not understood.
J It will require on the part of Congress great
labor and care, and especially a broad and
national contemplation of the subject, and a
patriotic disregard of such local and selfish
claims as are unreasonable and reckless of the
welfare of the entire country.
Under our present laws more than four
thousand articles are subject to duty. Many
of these do not in any way compete with our
own manufacturers, and many are hardly
worth attention as subjects of revenue. A
considerable reduction can be made in the
aggregate, by adding to them a free list. The
taxation of luxuries presents no features of
. hardship; but the necessaries of life used and
consumed by all the people, the duty upon
which adds to the cost of living in every
home, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
npon raw material used in manufactures, or
its free importation, is of course an important
factor in any effort to reduce the price of
. these necessaries; it would not only relieve
them from the increased cost caused by the
, tariff on such material, bat the manufactured
product being thus cheapened, that part of
the tariff now laid upon such product, as a
compensation to our manufacturers for the
present price of raw material, could be ac
cordingly modified. Such reduction, or free
importation, would serve beside to largely
reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how
such a change can have any injurious effect
. upon our manufacturers. On the contrary, it
would appear to give them a better chance in
foreign markets with the manufacturers of
other countries, who cheapen their wares by
free material. Thus our people might have
( the opportunity of extending their sales be
yond the limits of home consumption—saving
them from the depression, interruption in
business and loss caused by a glutted domes
p tic and affording their employees
more certain and steady labor, with its re
sulting quiet and contentment.
The q nation thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached in a spirit
, higher than partisanship and considered in
’ the light of that regard for patriotic duty
p which should characterize the action of those
{ intrusted with the weal of a confiding people.
, But the obligation to declared party policy
; and principle is not wanting to urge prompt
' and effective action. Both of the great polit-
L ical parties now represented in the govern
x ment have, by repeated and authoritative
declarations, condemned the condition of
p our laws which permit the collection from the
p people of unnecessary revenue, and have in
the most solemn manner promised its correc
tion, and neither as citizens or partizans are
our countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of these pledges.
I Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
r not be improved by dwelling upon the theo-
I ries of protection and free trade. This savors
• too much of bandying epithets. It is a condi
i turn which confronts us—not a theory. Relief
from this condition may involve a slight re
duction of the advantages which we award
• our home productions, but the entire with
f drawal of such advantages should not becon
t tcmplated.
The question of free trade is absolutely ir
s relevant; and the persistent claim made in
) certain quarters, that all efforts to relieve the
I people from unjust and unnecessary taxation
• are schemes of so-called free traders, is mis
chievous and far removed from any consido
; ration for the public good.
A DUTY TO THE PEOPLE. ]
The simple and plain duty which we owe
the people is to reduce taxation to the neces
sary expenses of an economical operation of
1 the government, and to restore to the business
of the country the money which we hold in
‘ the treasury through the perversion of gov- j
1 cm mental powers. These things can and
should be clone with safely to all our indus
tries, without danger to the opportunity for
1 remunerative labor which our workingmen ,
need, and with benefit to them and all our ,
people, by cheapening their means of subsis- .
fence and increasing the measure of their |
comforts.
The Constitution provides that the Presi- ]
dent “shall, from time to time, give to the
Congress informatation of the state of the
Union.” It has been the custom of the Ex- J
ecutive, in compliance with this provision, to *
annually exhibit to the Congress, at the
opening of its session, the general condition
of the country, and to detail, with some par
ticularity, the operations of the Executive
Departments. It would be especially agree- *
1 able to follow this course at the present lime, j
and to call attention to the valuable accora- t
plishments of these departments during the j
. last fiscal year. But lam so much impressed f
with the paramount importance of the sub
ject to which this communication has thus far
been devoted, that I shall forego the addition (
[ of any other topic, and only urge upon your r
( immediate consideration the “stale of the r
Union” as shown in the present condition of i
• our treasury and our general fiscal situation, .
upon which every element of our safety and 1
prosperity depends. c
, The reports of the heads of departments, ]
which will be submitted, contain full and ex
} plicit information touching the transaction of
the business intrusted to them, and such re j
commendations relating to legislation in the
public interest as they deem advisable. I
ask for these reports and recommendations
the deliberate examination and action of the r
legislative branch of the goverment.
There are other subjects not embraced in
, the departmental reports demanding legisla
f live consideration and which I should be glad 1
j to submit. Some of them, however, have .
been earnestly presented in previous messages ,
and as to them, I beg leave to repeat prior 1
recommendations.
‘ r As the law makes no provision for any re
port from the Department of State, a brief
history of the transactions of that important r
• department, together with other matters
which it may hereafter be deemed essential 5
| to commend to the attention of Congress, 1
( may furnish the occasion for a future com- '
; munication.
