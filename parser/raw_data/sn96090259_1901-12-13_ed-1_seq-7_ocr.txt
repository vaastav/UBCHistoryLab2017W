Of the last aeven elected President*,
in the third who has been murdered,
,nd the bare recital of this fact is auffl
dent to justify grave alarm' among all
oyal American citizens. Moreover, the
arcumstsnces of this, the third" sssassi
ation of an American President, have a
eculiarly sinister significance. Both
'resident Lincoln and President Garfield
tWere killed by assassins of types unfor
tunately not uncommon in history Presi
dent Lincoln falling a victim to the ter
rible passions aroused by four years of
fivil war, and President Garfield tff the
revengeful vanity of a disappointed office

by an utterly depraved criminal belong

to all governments, good and bad alike,
!Wto are against any form of popular lib
erty if it is guaranteed by even the most
Just and liberal laws, and who are as
nostile to the upright exponent of free
people's sober will as to the tyrannical
«nd irresponsible despot.
It is not too much to say that at the
me of President McKinley's death he
as the most widely loved man in all
le United States while we have never
ad any pubHc man of his position who
as been so wholly free from the bitter
animosities incident to public life. There
could be no personal hatred of him, for
3w never acted with aught but considera
tion for the welfare of others. The de
fenders of those murderous criminals who
to excuse their criminality by assert
that it is exercised for political ends,
ivelgh against wealth and Irresponsible
power. But for this assassination even
this base apology cannot be urged.

When President McKlnley was assas
noted the blow was not aimed at tyran
ly or wealth. It was aimed at one of
strongest champions the wage work

ic rignts and representative government

That there might be nothing lacking
to complete the Judas-like infamy of his

The dhock, the grief of the country, are
Utter in the minds of ah. We mourn a
od and great President who is dead
it while we mourn we are lifted up by
splendid achievements of his life and
grand heroism with which he met his
leatb.
When we turn from the man to the na
tion, the harm done is so great as to ex
,te onr gravest apprehensions and to dc
iand our wisest nnd most resolute ac
on. This criminal was a professed an
archist, inflamed by the teachings of pro
cessed anarchists, und probably also by
the reckless" utterances of those who, on
the stump and in the public press, appeal
•to lie dark and evil spirits of malice and
.creed, envy anil sullen hatred. The wind
sowed by the men who preach such
doctrines, and they cannot escape their
•hare of responsibility for the whirlwind
that is reaped.
The blow was aimed nbt at this Presi
dent, but at all Presidents at every sym
bol of government. Anarchy is no more
expression of "social discontent" than
licking pockets or wife beating. The an
rchist, and especially the anarchist in
the United States, is merely one type of
-criminal, more dangerous than any other
liecause he represents the same depravity
In a greater degree. Thfe man who ad
vocates anarchy directly or indirectly, in
any shape or fashion, or the man who
apologizes for anarchists and their deeds,
makes himself morally accessory to mur
der before the fact. The anarchist is a
criminal who is not merely the enemy of
system and of progress, but the deadly
foe of liberty, lie is not thoVvictim of
social or political injustice. There are
no wrongs to remedy in his case. The
cause of his criminality is to be found in
'his own evil passions and in the evil con
duct of those who urge him on, not in
any -failure t.v others or by the State to
do justice to him or his. He is a male
factor and nctliing else. No man or body
-of men preaching anarchistic doctrines
Should be allowed at large any more than
if preaching the murder of some specified
private individual. Anarchistic speeches,
writings and meetings are essentially se
ditious anil treasonable.

Asiiin«t Anarchists.
I earnestly recommend to the Congress
that lo the exercise of its wise discretion
it should take into consideration the com
ing to this country of anarchists or per
•ons professing principles hostile to all
government and justifying the murder of
tnose placed in authority. If found here
they should be promptly deported to the
Country whence tliey came and far
teaching provision should be made for the
.punishment of those who stay. No mat
ter calls more urgently for the wisest
thought of the Congress.
The federal courts Bhould be given
Jurisdiction over any man who kills or
attempts to kill the President or any man
who by the constitution or by low is in
line of succession for the presideny, while
tho punishment for an unsuccessful at
tempt should be proportioned to the enor
mity of tho offense against our institu
-ttons.
Anarchy is crime against the whole
human race and all mankind should
band against the anarchist. His crime
dhould be made an offense against the
law of nations. It should be so declared
by treaties among all'civilized powers.
This great country will not fall into
anarchy, nml_ if anarchists should ever
become a serious menace to its institu
tions, they would not merely be stamped
Ant, but would involve in their own ruin
•very active or passive sympathizer with
^belr doctrines. The American people are

Country'* Commercial Prosperity.
During the last five years business con
fidence has been restored, and the nation

Shoughnever
abounding prosperity. Such prosper
'can be created by law alone,
it it easy enough to destroy it
liy mischievous taws. Fundamentally the
iWelfare of each citlsen, and therefore the
welfare of the aggregate of citizens
^jrhich makes the nation, must rest upon
(•dividual thrift and energy, resolution
and intelligence. Nothing can take the
place of this individual capacity but wise
legislation and honest and intelligent ad
ministration can give it the fullest scope,
the largest opportunity to work to good
effect.
The tremendous and highly complex in
dustrial development which went on with
ever accelerated rapidity during the lat
ter half of the nineteenth century brings
us face to face, at the beginning of the
twentieth, with vety serious social prob
lems. The upbuilding of the great in
dustrial centers has meant a startling in
crease, not merely in tho aggregate of
wealth, but in the number of very large
individual, and especially of very large
corporate, fortunes. The creation of these
great corporate fortunes has not been due
to the tariff nor to any other govern
mental action, but to natural causes in
the business world, operating in other
countries as they operate in our own. The
process has aroused much antagonism, a
great part of which is wholly without
warrant. It is not true that as the rich
have grown richcr the poor have grown
poorer. On the contrary, never before
has tho average man, the wage worker,
the farmer^ tho small trader, been so well
off as in this country at tho preseut time.
There have been abuses connected with
the accumulation of wealth yet it re
mains true that a fortune accumulated in
legitimate business can be accumulated
by the person specially benefited only on
condition of conferring immense incident
al benefits upon others.
Caution I« Advised.
The captains of industry who have driv
en the railway systems across this conti
nent, who have built up our commerce,
who have developed our manufactures,
have on the whole done great- good to
our people. Without them the material
development of which we are so justly
proud conld never have taken place.
Moreover, we should recognize the im
mense importance to this material devel
opment of leaving as unhampered as is
compatible with the public good the
strong and forceful men upon whom the
success of business operations inevitably
rests.
An additional reason for caution in
dealing with corporations is to be found
in the international commercial condi
tions of to-day. The same business con
ditions which have produced the great
aggregations of corporate and individual
wealth have made them very potent fac
tors in international commercial competi
tion. America has only just begun to
assume that commanding position in the
International business world which we
believo will more and more be hers. It
is of the utmost importance that this po
sition be not jeopardized, especially at a
time when the overflowing abundance of
our own natural resources and the skill,
business energy, and mechanical aptitude
of our people make foreign markets es
sential. Under such conditions it would
be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the
youthful strength .of our nation.
Moreover, it cannot too often be point
ed out that to strike with ignorant vio
lence at the interests of one set of men
almost inevitably endangers the interests
of all. Disaster to great business enter
prises can never have its effects limited
to the men at the top. It spreads
throughout, and while it is bad for every
body, it is worst for those farthest down.
The capitalist may be shorn of his lux
uries but the wage worker may be de
prived of even bare necessities.
In facing new industrial conditions, the
whole history of the world shows that leg
islation will generally be both unwise and
Ineffective unless undertaken after calm
inquiry and with sober self-restraint.
Much of the legislation directed at the
trusts would have been exceedingly mis
chievous had it not also been entirely in
effective. The men who demand the im
possible or the undesirable serve us the
allies of the forces with which they are
nominally at war, for they hamper those
who would endeavor to find out in ra
tional fashion what the wrongs real]? are
and .to what extent and in what manner
it is practicable to apply remedies. Yet
it is true that there are real and grave
evils, ono of the chief being over-capital
ization because of its many baleful con
sequences and a resolute and practical
effort must be made to correct these
evils.
Publicity a Cure for Traits.
There is a widespread conviction in "the
minds of the American people that the
great^ corporations known as trusts are in
certain of their features and tendencies
hurtful to the general welfare. Combina
tion and concentration should be, not pro
hibited, but supervised and within rea
sonable limits controlled.
The first essential in determining how
to deal with the great industrial combina
tions is knowledge of the facts—publicity.
In the interest of the public, the govern
ment should have the right to inspect and
examine the workings of the great corpo
rations engaged in interstate business.
Publicity is the only sure remedy which
we can now invoke. What further rem
edies are needed in the way of govern
mental regulation, or taxation, can only
be determined after publicity has been
obtained, by process of law, and in the
course of administration.
The large corporations, commonly call
ed trusts, though organized in one State,
always do business in many States, often
doing very little business in the State
where they are incorporated. There Is
utter lack of uniformity in the State laws
about them and as no State has any ex
clusive interest in or power over their
acts, it has in practice proved impossible
to get adequate regulation through State
action. Therefore, in the interest of the
whole people, the nation should, without
interfering with the power of the States
in the matter itself, also assume power
of supervision and regulation over nil cor
porations doing an interstate business. I
believe that a law can be framed which
will enable the national government to
exercise control along the lines above In
dicated. There should be created a cab
inet officer, to be known as Secretary of
Commerce and Industries, as provide'd in
the bill introduced at the last session of
the Congress.,, It should be his province
to deal with commerce in its broadest
sense includinc,among many other things
whatever concerns labor and all matters
affecting the great business corporations
and our merchant marine.
Would Exclude Chinese.
With the sole exception of the farming
interest, no one matter is of such vital
moment to our wliaie people as the wel
fare of the wage workers. If the farmer
and the wage worker are well oW, it is
absolutely certain that ull others will be
well off, too. It is therefore a matter-for
hearty congratulation that on the whole
wages are higher to-day in the United
States than ever before in our history,
and far higher than in any other country.
The standard of living is also higher than
ever before. Every effort of legislator
and administrator should be bent to se
cure the permanency of this condition of
things and its improvement wherever
possible. Not only must onr labor be pro
tected by the tariff, but it should also be
protected so far as it Is possible from
the presence in this country of any labor
ers brought over by contract, or of those
who, coming freely, jet represent a stand
ard of living so depressed that they can
undersell our men in tlie labor market
and drag them to a lower level. I regard
It as necessary, with this end in view, to
re-enact immediately the law excluding
Chinese laborers and to strengthen it
wherever necessary in order to make its
enforcement entirely effective.
If possible legislation should be passed,
in connection with the interstate com
merce law, which will render effective
the efforts of different States to do away
with the competition of convict contract
labor in the open labor market.
The most vital problem with which this
country, and for that matter the whole
civiliaed world, has to deal, is the prob
lem which has for one side the better
ment of social conditions, moral and phy
sical, in large cities, and for another side
the effort to deal with that tangle of far
reaching questions which we group to
gether when we speak of "labor." The
chief factor in the success of each man—
wage worker, farmer and capitalist alike
—must ever be the sum total of his own
Individual qualities and abilties. There
must in many cases be action by the gov
ernment in order to safeguard the rights
and interests of all.
I
in migration Itiva Unsatisfactory.
Our present immigration laws are un
satisfactory. We need every honest and
efficient immigrant fitted to become an
American citizen. But there should be a
comprehensive law enacted wijth the ob
ject of working a threefold improvement
over our present system. First, We should
aim to exclude absolutely not only all
persons who are known to be believers
in anarchistic principles or members of
'anarchistic societies, but also all persons
who are of a low moral tendency or ot'
unsavory reputation. The second object
of a proper immigration law. ought to be
to secure by a careful and not merely.
perfunctory educational test some intelli
gent capacity to appreciate American in
stitutions and act sanely as American
citizens. Filially, all persons should be
excluded who are below a certain stand
ard of economic fitness to enter our in
dustrial field as competitors with Ameri
can labor. Both the educational and
economic tests in a wise Immigration law
should be designed to protect and elevate
the general body politic and social. A
very close supervision should be exercised
over the steamship companies which
mainly bring over the immigrants, and
they should be held to a strict accounta
bility for any infraction of the law.
Tariff and Reciprocity.
There is general acquiescence in our
reseat tariff system as a national pol
cy. The first requisite to our prosperity
is the continuity and stability of this
economic policy. Nothing could be more
unwise than to disturb the business in
terests of the countiy by any general tar
iff change at this time. Our experience
in the past has shown that sweeping re
visions of the tariff are apt to produce
conditions closely approaching panic in
the business world. Yet it is not only
possible, but eminently desirable, to com
bine with the stability of our economic
system a supplementary system of recip
rocal benefit and obligation with other
nations. Such reciprocity was especially
provided for in the present tariff law.
Reciprocity, must be treated as the
handmaiden of protection. Our first duty
is to see that the protection granted by
tlio tariff in every case where it is need
ed is maintained, and that reciprocity
bo sought for so far as it can safely be
done without injury to our home indus
tries. Just how far this is must be deter
mined according to the individual case,
remembering always that every applica
tion of our tariff policy to meet our shift
ing national needs must be conditioned
upon the cardinal fact that the duties
must never be reduced below the point
that will cover the difference between the
labor cost here and abroad. Subject to
this proviso of the proper protection nec
essary to our industrial well being at
home, the principle of reciprocity must
command our hearty support.
The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connec
tion with those of our productions which
no longer require all of the support once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach of successful
competition. I nsk the attention of the
Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid
before it by my predecessor.
America's Merch mt Murine.
The condition of the American mer
chant marine is such as to call for imme
diate remedial action by the Congress.
It is discreditable to us as a nation that
our merchant marine should be utterly
insignificant in comparison to that of oth
er nations which we overtop in other
forms of business. We should not longer
submit to conditions under which only
a trifling portion of our great commerce
is carried in our own ships. To remedy
this state of things would not merely
serve to build up our shipping interests,
but it would also result in benefit to all
who are interested in the permanent es
tablishment of a wider market for Amer
ican products, and would provide an aux
iliary force for the navy. Our government
should take such action as will remedy
these inequalities. The American mer
chant marine should be restored to the
ocean.
The act of March 14, 1000. Intended un
equivocally to establish gold as the stand
ard money and to maintain at a parity there
with all forms of money medium In use
with us, has been shown to be timely and
judicious. The price of our Government
bonds in the world's market, when com
pared with the price of similar obligations
Issued by other nations, Is a flattering trib
ute to our public credit. This condition it
is evidently desirable to maintain.
In many respects the national banking
law furnishes sufficient liberty for the prop
er exercise of the banking function but
there seems to be need of better safeguards
agalnBt the deranging influence of commer
cial crises and financial panics. Moreover,
the currency of the country should be made
responsive to the demands of our domestic
trade and commerce.
The collections from duties on Imports and
.Internal taxes continue to exceed the ordi
nary expenses of the Government, thanks
mainly to the reduced army expenditures.
The utmost care should be taken not to re
duce the revenues so that there will be any
possibility of a deficit but, after providing
against any such contingency, means should
be adopted which will bring the revenues
more nearly within the limit of our actual
ineods.
I call special attention to the need of strict
economy In expenditures. Only by avoidance
of spending money on what Is needless or
unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our
Income to the point required to met our
needs that are genuine.
Interstate Commerce.
In 1887 a measure was enacted for the reg
ulation of Interstate railways, cominonly
known as the Interstate commerce act. The
cardinal provisions of that act were that
railway rates should be Just and reasonable
and that all shippers, localities and commod
ities sHould be accorded equal treatment.
That law was largely an experiment. Ex
perience has shown the wisdom of Its pur
poses, but hus also shown, possibly that
some of Its requirements are wrong, cer
tainly that the means devised for the en
forcement of Its provisions are defective.
The act should be amended. The railway Is
a public servant. Its rates should be Just
to and open to all shippers alike. The Gov
ernment should see to It that within Its Jur
isdiction this Is so, and should provide a
speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to
that end. At the same time nothing could
be more foolish than the enactment of legis
lation which would unnecessarily Interfere
with the development and operation of these
commercial agencies.
The Department of Agriculture during the
last fifteen yearo has steadily broadened Its
work on economic lines, and has accom-
Somesticresultsforeign
llshed of real value In upbuilding
and trade. It has gone
Into new fields until It is now In touch with
all sections of our country and with two ot
the Island groups that have lately come un
der our jurlstalctlon, whose people must
look to agriculture /or a livelihood. It Is
searching the world for grains, grasses,
fruits and vegetables specially fitted for in*
traduction Into localities In the several
States and Territories where they may add
materially to our resources. By scientific
attention to soil survey and possible new
crops, to breeding of new varieties of plants,
to experimental shipments, to animal Indus
try and applied chemistry, very practical
aid had been given our farming and stock
growing Interests. The products of the
farm have taken an unprecedented place In
our export trade during the year that has
Just closed.
Protection of the Forest.
Public opinion throughout the United
States has moved stesdfly toward a Just ap
preciation of the value of forests, whether
planted or of natural growth. The great
part played by them fi the creation and
maintenance of the national wealth Is now
more fully realised than ever before.
Wise forest protection does not mean the
withdrawal of forest resources, whether of
wood, water or grass, but, on the contrary.
gives the assurance of larger and more cer
tain supplies. The fundamental Idea of
forestry is the perpetuation of forests by
use. Forest protection Is not an end of
itself It Is a means to Increase and sustain
the resources of our country and the Indus
tries which depend upon them. The preser
vation of our foreBts Is an Imperative busi
ness necessity. At present the protection
of the forest reserves rests with the Gen
eral Land Office, the mapping out and de
scription of their timber with the' United
States Geological Survey, and the prepara
tion of plans for their conservative use with
the Bureau of Forestry, which is also
charged with the general advancement of
practical forestry In the United States.
These various functions should be united In
the Bureau of Forestry, to which thev
properly belong.
Reclamation of Arid Lnnd*.
The reclamation of the unsettled arid pub
lic lands presents a different problem, llerc
It Is not enough to regulate the flow of
streams. The object or the Government Is
to dispose of the land to settlers who will
build homes upon It. To accomplish tliis
object water must be brought wllhln their
reach.
The pioneer settlers on the arid public
domain chose their homes along streams
from which they could themselves divert the
water to reclaim their holdings. Such op
portunities are practically gone. There re
main, however, vast areas of public land
which can be made available for homestead
settlement, but only by reservoirs and malu
llne canals Impracticable for private enter-
Eullt
rlse. TheBe Irrigation works should be
by the national Government for actual
settlers, and the cost of construction should
so far as possible be repaid by the laud re
claimed.
In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the
territory on the traditional American lines.
We do not wish a region of large estates
tilled by cheap labor we wish a healthy
American community of men who them
selves till the farms they own. All our
legislation for the Islands should be shaped
with this end In view the well-being of the
average home-maker must afford tne true
test of the healthy development of the
Islands. The laud policy should as nearly
as possible be modeled on our homestead
system.
It is a pleasure to say that It. is hardly
more necessary to report as to Porto Illco
than as to any state or territory within our
continental limits. The Island is thriving
as nevor before, und It is being administered
efficiently and honestly. Its people are now
enjoying liberty and order under thp protec
tion of the United States, and upon this fact
we congratulate them and ourselves. Their
material welfare must be as carefully and
jealously considered as the welfare of any
other portion of our country. We have
given them the great gift of free access for
their products to the markets of the United
States. I ask the attention of the Congress
to the need of legislation concerning the pub
lic lands of Porto ltlco.
Cuba on the Philippine*.
In Cuba such progress has been mndo to
ward putting the Independent government of
the Island upon a firm footing that before
the present session of Congress closes this
will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will
then start as lier own mistress and to the
beautiful Queen of the Antilles, us she un
folds this new page of her destiny, we ex
tend our heartiest greetings nnd good wishes.
Elsewhere I have discussed the question of
reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, how
ever, there are weighty reasons of moral
ity and of nutlonal interest why the policy
should be held to have a peculiar applica
tion, and I most earnestly ask your attention
to the wisdom, Indeed, to the vital nceil, of
providing for a substantial reduction in the
tariff duties on Cuban imports Into the
United States. Cuba has lu her constitu
tion affirmed what we desired, that she
should stand In International matters in clos
er and more friendly relations with us than
with any other power and we ure bound
by every consideration of honor and
expediency to pass conuncrcial measures in
the Interest of her material well-being.
In the Philippines our problem Is larger.
They are very rich tropical Islands, Inhabit
ed by many varying tribes, representing
widely different stages of progress toward
civilization. Our earnest effort Is to help
these people upward along the stouv and
dilllcult path that leads to self-government.
We hope to make our administration of the
islands honorable to our unllou by making
It of the highest benefit to the Filipinos
themselves and ns an earnest of what we
Intend to do, we point to what we have done.
Already a greater measure of material pros
perity and of governmental honesty and effi
ciency has been attained in the Philippines
than ever before in their history.
The only fear Is lest In our overanxiety
we give them a degre of Independence for
which tliey are unlit, thereby inviting re
action and disaster. As fast as there Is
any reasonable hope that In a given district
the people can govern themselves, self-gov
ernment has been given In that district.
There Is not a locality fitted for self-govern
ment which has not received it. But It may
well be that In certain cases It will have to
be withdrawn because the Inhabitants show
themselves unfit to exercise It such in
stances have already occurred.
Still Troubles Ahea-1.
There are still troubles ahead in the
islands. The insurrection has become an
affair of local banditti and marauders, who
deserve no higher regurd than the brigands
of portions of the Old World. Encourage
ment. direct or Indirect, to these liisurrectos,
stands on the same footing ns encourage
ment to hostile Indians In the days when we
still had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim
is to give to the Indian who remains peace
ful the fullest and amplest consideration,
but to have It understood that we will show
no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so
we must make it evident, unless we arc
false to our own traditions and to the de
mands of civilization and humanity, that
while we will do everything In our p'owcr for
the Filipino who Is peaceful, we will take
the sternest measures with the Filipino who
follows the puth of the Insurrecto and the
la drone.
I call your attention most earnestly to the
crying need of a cable to Hawaii and Hit'
Philippines, to be continued from the Phil
ippines to points in Aslu. We should not de
fer a day longer than necessary the con
struction of such a cable. It Is demanded
not merely for commercial, but for political
and military considerations.
Tlie Uthinitin Cannl.
No single great material work which re
mains to be undertaken on this continent is
of such consequence to the American people
as the bulldlug of a canal across the Isthmus
connecting North and South America. Its
importance to the nation Is by no means lim
ited merely to Its material effects upon oup*
business prosperity und yet with view to
these effects alone, it would be to the last
degree Important for us immediately to be
gin It. While its beneficial effect a would per
haps be most marked upon the Pacific Coast
and the Gulf and South Atlantic States, it
would also greatly benefit other sections. It
Is emphatically a work which It is for the
Interest pf the entire country lo begin and
complete ns Hoon as possible it Is one of
those works which only a great nation can
undertake with prospects of success, and
which when done are not only permanent as
sets In the nation's material Interests, but
standing monuments to its constructive abil
ity.
I am glad to be able to announce to you
that our negotiations on this subject with
Great Britain, conducted on both sides In a
spirit of friendliness and mutual good will
and respect, have resulted in my being able I
to lay before the Senate a treaty wlileli If
ratified will enable us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian canal at any time, and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that It has ever asked In connection with the
canal. It specifically provides that the
United States alone shall do the work of
building and assume the responsibility of
safeguarding the canal, and shall regulate
its neutral use by all nations on terms of
equality without the guaranty or Interfer
ence of any outside nation from any quarter.
Work on the avy u»t Continue.
The work ot upbuilding the Navy must
be steadily continued. No one point of our
policy, foreign or domestic, is more impor
tant than this to the-honor nnd mater a!
welfare, and above ull to the peace, of our
nation In the future. Whether wc desire It
or not, we must henceforth recognize that
we have International duties no .cs-i than
International rights. Ev»n If our II ig were
hauled down in the Philippines and Porto
ltlco, even if we decided not to build the
Isthmian Canal, we should need a thorough
ly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be
prepared definitely and for all time to aban
don the Idea that our nation Is among tho»e
whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Un
less our commerce Is always to be carried
In foreign bottoms, we must have wur craft
to protect it.
Inasmuch, however, as the American peo
ple have no thought of abandoning the path
upon which they have entered, and especial
ly In view of the fact that the building of
the Isthmian Canal Is fast becoming one of
the mutters which the whole people are
uuited In demanding. It is Imperative that
our Navy should be put and kept in the
highest state of efficiency, nnd should be
ninde to answer to our growing needs. So
far from being In any way a provocation to
war, an adequate and highly trained navy Is
the best guaranty against war, the cheapest
and most effective peace Insurance. The
cost
of building and maintaining such a nary
represents the very lightest premium fur In
suring peace which this nation can possibly
pay.
Our people Intend to abide by the Monroe
Doctrine and to Insist upon It ns the one
sure means of securing the pence of the
Western hemisphere. The Navy offers us
the only means of making oar Insistence
upon the Monroe Doclriuc anything bir a
subject of derision to whatever iin
chooses to disregard It. We desire the p. ace
which cotues as of right to the just man
armed not the peace granted on terms of
ignominy to the-craven and the weak.iiig.
It Is not possible to improvise a navy after
war breaks out. The ships must be built
and the men trained long in advance. Some
auxiliary vessels can be turned Into make
shifts which will do In default of any better
for the minor work, nud proportion of raw
men can be mixed with the highly trained,
their shortcomings being made good by the
skill of their fellows but the efficient light
ing force of the Navy when pitied ag:ifnst
an equal opponent will be found alniust ex
clusively In the war ships that have been
regularly built and In the officers and men
who through years of fultliful perforniam-e
of sea duty have been trained to handle their
formidable but complex aud 'delicate weap
ons with the highest efficiency. In the late
war with Spain the ships that dealt the de
cisive blows at Manila aud Santiago had
been launched from two to fourteen years,
und they were able to do as they did because
the men In the conning towers, the gun tur
rets, and the englue-rooms had through long
years of practice at sea learned how to do
their duty.
While awarding the fullest honor to the
men who actually commanded and manned
the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea
forccs iu the Philippines und In Cuba, we
must not forget that au equal meed of
praise belongs to those without whom
lieltlivi blow could huve been struck. Tho
Congressmen who voted years In advance the
money to lay down the ships, to build the
guns, to buy the armor-plate the depart
ment officials and the business men and
wage-workers who furnished what the Con
gress had authorized the Secretaries of the
Navy who asked for aud expended the ap
propriations and finally the ofilcers who. In
fair weather and foul, on actual sea ser
vice, trained and disciplined the crews of
the ships when there was no war In sight
all are entitled to a full share In the glory
of Manila and Santiago, and the respect ac
corded by every true American to those who
wrought such signal triumph for our coun
try. It was forethought and preparation
which secured us the overwhelming triumph
of 1808. If we fall to show forethought
and preparation now, there may couio
time when disaster will befall us Instead of
triumph and should this time come, the
fault will rest primarily, not upon those
whom the accident of events puts In su
preme command at the moment, but upon
those who have failed to prepare in ad
"ance.
No Cessation in the Work.
There should be no cessation In the work
of completing our Navy. So far Ingenuity
has been wholly unable to devise a substi
tute for the great war craft whose hammer
ing guns beat out the mastery of the li gh
seas. It is unsafe aud unwise not to provide
this year for several additional battle ships
and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary
and lighter craft iu proportion for the ex
act numbers und character I refer you to
the report of the Secretary of the Navy.
But there Is something we need even more
than additional ships, and this Is additional
officers and men.
Increase ot* the Army l'nnec3ssnrv.
It Is not necessary to Increase our Army
be.vond Its present size at tills time. But ft
is necessary to keep it at the highest point
of efficiency. The individual units who as
officers nnd enlisted men compose this Army,
are, wc have good reason to believe, at least
as efficient ns those of any other army In the
entire world, it is our duly to see that
their training Is of a kind to insure the high
est possible expression of power to these
units when acting In combination.
Tho conditions of modern war are such as
to make an Infinitely heavier demand than
ever before upon the Individual character
and capacity of tile officer and the enlisted
mail, and to make it far more difficult for
men to act together with effect. At present
the fighting must be done lu extended order,
which means that each man must act for
himself und at the same time act In com
bination with others with whom lie Is no
longer In the old-fasliioncd elbow-to-cibow
touch. Under such conditions a few men of
:lic highest excellence are worth more than
many men without the special skill which Is
only found as the result of special training
applied to men of exceptional physique and
,norale. But nowadays the most va!uah:e
fighting man nnd the most difficult to per
fect is the rlllomnn who Is also a skillful nnd
daring rider. The proportion of our cavalry
regiments has wisely been Increased. The
American cavalryman, trained to maneuver
and light with equal facility on foot ami on
horseback, is the best type of soldier for
general purposes ow to be found in the
world.
A genera! staff should be created. As .r
the present staff and supply departments,
they should be filled by details from the
line, the men so detailed returning lifter
while to tlieir line duties. It Is very unde
sirable to have the senior prudes-'of tlie
Army composed of men who have come to
lill the positions by tlie lucre fact of seniori
ty. A system should be adopted by which
there shall be an cllmlnatinu grade by grade
of those who seem unlit to render the best
service 111 the next grade. Jus tlce to the
veterans of the Civil War who are still in the
Army would seem to require that lu the
matter of retirements they be given by law
the same privileges accorded to their' coni
rnilcs In the Navy.
The pre .ess of elimination of the least tit
should be conducted lu manner that would
render It practically impos-lble to apply po
litical or social pressure on -ehjilf of any
candidate, so that each man may be judged
purely on Ills own mciiis.
Every effort should be made lo bring the
Army to a constantly li.creasing state »f
efficiency. When on actual service no work
save that directly lu the line of such service
should be required. The paper woik In the
Army, ns In the Navy, should N* greatly re
duced. What Is needed Is proved power of
command nnd capacity to work well in the
Held. Constant care is necessary to prevent
dry rot In the transportation and commis
sary departments.
Our Army Is so small and so much scat
tered that It Is very difficult to give the
higher officers (as well as the lower officers
and the enlisted men) a chance to practice
maneuvers lu mass and on a comparatively
large scale. In time of need no amount of
individual excelieuce would avail against the
paralysis whb would follow inalil Ity to
work as a coherent whole, under skillful' and
daring leadership. The Coma-ess should pro
vide means .whereby It will be possible to
have lleld exercises by at least a division of
regulars, and If possible also a division of
naMonul guardsmen, once year
Army
Much good has already come from tlie net
reorganizing the Army, passed early iu the
present year. The three prime reforms, ull
of them of literally inestimable value, arc,
first, the substitution of tour-year details
from the line for permanent appointments
in the so-called staff divisions second, the
establishment of a corps of ariillcry with a
chief at the head third, the establishment
of a maximum and minimum limit for the
Army. It would be difficult to overestimate
the Improvement In the efficiency of our
Army which these three reforms are makiug,
find have In part already effected.
The reorganization provided for by the act
has been substantially accomplished. The
Improved conditions In the Philippines have
enabled the War Department materially to
reduce the military charge apon our reveaa*
and to arrange the number of soldiers so as
to bring this number much nearer to the
minimum than to the, maximum limit ab
llshed by law. Thci'e Is. however, ne of
supplementary legislation. Thorough ilil
tary education must be provided, and in ad
dition to tho regulars the advantages or this
education should be given to the of!1cer» of
the National Guard and others In civil llf*
who desire Intelligently to fit themselves for
possible military duty. The oflWrs should
be given the chance to perfect themselves
by study In the higher branches of this art.
it 1 Point the education should lie of the
kind most apt to turn out men who are good
in actual field service too much stress should
not be laid cn mathematics, nor should pro
ficiency therein be held to establish the right
or entry to a corps d'ellte. The typical
American officer of the best kind need not
be good mathematician but he must ba
able to master himself, to control others, and
to show boldness nnd fertility of rcsuiirc*
in every emergency.
That the Army is not at all a mere Instru
ment of destruction has ben shown during
the last three years. In the Philippines.
Cuba, und i'oito Rico It has proved llself a
great constructs enforce, a most potent Im
plement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civ
ilization.
No other clt'zens deserve so well of the
republic as the veterans, the survivors of
those who saved the Union. Tliey did the
one deed which If left undone would hnva
men tit that nil else In onr history went for
nothing. The lueu who In the last three
years have done so well In the East and ths
West Indies and on the mainland of Asia
have sliowu that this remembrance not
lost, in any serious crisis the I'nlted Stntes
must rely for tlie great mass of its fighting
.men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not
make a permanent profession of the mili
tary career: nnd whenever such crlsla
arises the deathless memories of the Civil
War will give to Americans the lift of lofty
purpose which comes to those whose fathers,
have stood valiantly iu the forefront of ths
battle.
Our Consular Service.
The consular service is now organized ntv
der the provisions of a lnw passed in 1K06.
which Is entirely Inadequate to existing eon
dltlons. The Interest showu by so many
commercial bodies throughout the country In
tlie reorganization of the service is hvartilr
commended to your attention.
The guardianship and fostering of our rap
idly expanding foreign commerce, the pro
tection of American cltizcns resorting to
foreign countriis In lawful pursuit of their
affairs, and the maintenance of the dignity
of the nation abroad, combine to make It
essential that our consuls should be men of
character, knowledge and enterprise. It Is
t"'e that the service Is now, In the main,
efficient, but standard of excellence cannot
he permanently maintained until the prin
ciples set forth In the bills heretofore sub
mitted to the Congress on this subject are
enacted Into law.
I bespeak the most cordial support from
the Congress nnd the people for the St.
Louis Exposition to Commemorate llie Ono
Hundredth Anniversary of the Ixxilfrinna
1 urcbusc. We earnestly hope that foreign
nations will upprcdate the deep Intercut our
country takes In this exposition, nnd our
view of its importance front every stand
point, and that tli»y will participate In se
curing Its success. The natlcnnt govern
men* should lie represented by a full and
complete set of exhibits.
For the sake ot good administration, sound
economy, and the advancement of science,
the Census Office ns now constituted should
be made a permanent government burenu.
Growth of tlie l'osl :I -ervice.
The remarkable growth of the postal seiw
vice Is shown In the fact that Its revenues
have doubled nnd Its expenditures have near
ly doubled within twelve years. Its pro
gressive development coinpeis eonstnntlv In
creasing outlay, but lu this period of busi
ness energy nnd prosperity Its receipts grow
so much faster than its expenses that the
annual detlclt has boon stcadliy reduced
from $11,411,770 in 1807 to S:i,!l2,1.727 In
101)1. Among recent postal advances the
success of rural free delivery wherever es
tablished has been so marked, nnd actual
experience lias made Its benefits so plnln,
the demand for Its extension Is general and
urgent.
It is just that the great agricultural popu
lation should share in the improvement of
tho service. The number of ruriil routes now
in operation Is (!,W9, practically nil estab
lished within thi'co years, and there are
0,000 applications awaiting aciicn. It is ex
pected that the number In ooeration nt tho
close of the current, fiscal year will reach
8,000. The mail will then lie dally carried
to the doors of 5,7(JO.OOO of our people who
have heretofore been dependent upon distant
offices, and one-third of all that portion of
the country which is adapt.-.! to It will be
covered by this kind of service.
The full measure of postal progress which
might be realized has long been hampered
and obstructed by the lienvv burden Im
posed on the government through the In
trenched and well-understood nhuses which
have grown up In connection with second
olnss ninll matter. The extent of this bur
den appears when It Is stated that while
the second-class matter makes nearly three
fifths of the weight of ail the mall, it pnld
for the last fiscal year only s-l.Vll-M-tr, of the
aggregate postal revenue of Slll.t:31-1DK. If
the pound rate of postage, which produces
tho large loss thus cntal c-1, and which was
fixed by the Conirress with the purpose of
encouraging the dissemination of pnbl'c In
formation. were limited to the legitimate
newspapers and periodicals actually con
templated by tho law. no lust exception
could betaken. The I'ost-omce Department
has now undertaken to remove the abuses
so far ns Is possible by a stricter application
of the law and it should be sustained in Its
effort.
Settlement of the Cliineno Emlirnglia
Owing to tho rapid growth of our power
nnd our Interests oil the Pacific, whatever
hnopens iu China must be of the keenest
national concern lo us.
The general terms of the settlement of the
questions growing out of the antiforclgn
uprisings lu China of 11100. having been for
mulated in a joint note adilrc-sed to China
by the representatives of the Injnreil pow
ers in December last, were promptly nc
epted by thi Chinese government. After
.-otraetod conferences the piwnpotcntbirics
of the several powers were able to sign a
final protocol with the Chinese plenipoien
tarlcs on the 7th of last September, soiling
forth the measures taken by China in compli
ance with the demands (if the joint note, and
expressing their satisfaction therewith. It
will be laid before the Congress, with a re
port of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the
United States. Mr. Willtiin Wondvllle ltock
hill. to whom high praise Is due for the tact,
good Judgment, and cnei-.'y lie has displayed
In performing au cxccptionnll.v difficult and
delicate task.
Under the provi.-lons of the joint note of
December. lliOO, China lias agreed to revise
the treaties of coinuierce and navigation
and to take such other.steps for the purpose
of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign
powers may decide to lie needed.
During these troubles our government has
unswervingly advocated moderation, and has
materially aided in bringing aliom an adjust
ment which tends to c.,.lance the wcifars
of China and to lead to a more beucficial
intercourse between the empire and the
modern world while In the critical period
of revolt and massacre we did our full share
In safeguarding life and property, restoring
order, and vindicating the national interest
and honor. It behooves to continue In
these paths, doing what lies in our power
to foster feelings of gocd w:ll, and le.ivtug
no ellort untried to work out ilie great policy
of full and 'air Intercourse between China
and the nations, on a footing of equul r'g!:ts
and advantages lo all. We advocate the
"open door" with ail thai it implies not
merely the procurement of iirarged com
mercial opportunities on I lie co asts, but ac

wlilch China has been so cxt i-.iordindrliy fa

Death of Yictori:*.
The death of Queen Victoria cansrd the
people of the United States d.-ep aud heart
felt sorrow, to which the government g'lve
full expression. Vhen I'il tlcnt MrlCl'-ley
died, our nation »n turn received from every
quarter of the British Kmpire expressions
of grief and symuathy no lixs sincere. The
death of the Empress iiov.v.ger l'rcdcrick
of Germany alsc aroused th.- genuine sym
pathy of the American people: ami this
sympathy was cordially reciprocated by
Germany when the l'l-eshleia was assas
sinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the
civilized world we l-eccivcd, nt the time of
the President's defttb, assurances of such
grief and regard ns to touch the hearty of
our people. In the midst of our nllilction
we reverently thank the Almighty that we
are at peace with the nations of mankind:
and we firmly Intend that our policy Khali
be such as to continue unbroken these In
