Senator Foraker, when seen to

reiterated that there will be no state
hood legislation for Arizona and New
Mexico, unless the senate adopt one
of the other amendments proposed by
him, the other day. mention of which
was made In these dispatches at
tho time. Expert Judgment Is that
certain senators, rather than see the
defeat of Oklahoma and Indian terri
tory's claim to statehood, will assume
sut-h an attitude that will make Sena

and that the former two territories
will be admitted, while Arizona and

DECLARES EQUITABLE IS
TRYING TO BE REVENGED
Makes Earnest Request That Mat
ter of Equitable's Claim Be
Excluded From Hearings
New York, Dec. 14. During the In
surance Investigation today Edward
W. Scott, president of the Provident
Savings Life Assurance society, made
an earnest appeal to Chairman W. A.
Armstrong, of the investigating com
mittee to exclude from the hearing
certain statement bearing on his re
lations with the Equitable Life Assur
ance society of which he was former
ly Australian agent.
Charles E. Hughes, counsel of the
Investigating committee, had asked
Mr. Scott whether the Equitable Life
Assurance society had not a claim of
$100,000 against him. Mr. Scott at
first declared that there was no such
claim against him, and then Mr.
Hughes presented letters that passed
between Mr. Scott and President Al
exander on that subject In 1901, In
which President Alexander asked Mr.
Scott to make a formal admission In
writing that his accounts with the so
ciety, showing balances of $57,933 due
to the society, were accurate. In one
letter President Alexander wrote that
Mr. Scott had accepted the accounts.
Mr. Scott's letters to President Alex
ander proposed a conference, but
made no admissions as to the accept
ance of the accounts.
Scott Makes Earnest Appeal.
When these letters had been read
President Scott, made an earnest plea
to the committee to rulo that this sub
ject was foreign to the Investigation.
He declared that he had been pursued
by enemies for several years; that In
1900 he caused the arrest and Indict
ment of a man who hud engaged with
the Equitable Life Assurance society
to deliver to It records stolen from tho
Provident Savings Life Assurance so
ciety; that a traitorous book-keeper
who was in league with this man was
dismissed from the Provident society's
employ and that it was In connection
with these matters that his (Mr.
Scott's) relations with the Equltablo
were reported to the committee and In
a spirit of revenge.
Though Mr. Hughes did not uncov
er just what the Kultable society's
claim against Mr. Scott was based on,
he brought out from him the state
ment that the Equitable society had
mude such a claim upon him and that
Mr. Scott refused to settle It.
Another Incident In the testimony
of Mr. Scott wus his stutement that
when he bought control of the Provi
dent Savings Life Assurance society's
stock, he used $25.000 which had
been lent by that company to two of
Its agents In order to enable them to
buy loo shares of its stock. They did
not buy the stock and Mr. Scott said
he took over the loan and delivered to
the society a promise to turn over to
It 100 shares of its stock when he got
the stock. It is now held by a trust
company to whom he still owes $50,
000, which he borrowed to buy It.
