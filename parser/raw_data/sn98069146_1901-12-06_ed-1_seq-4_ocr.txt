BEATTLEBORO, VT FRIDAY, DEC. 6, 1901.
THE MESSAGE.
President Koosevelt is always a virile
and interesting fellow, and though in
one of the longest messages with
which the country has ever been af
flicted we find his characteristic stren
uosit) somewhat sobered by a sense
of responsibility, and eprigams sub
stituted to a largo extent for definite
recommendations, it is still an unus
ually readable document, in parts most
admirable in tone, and in purely lit
erary quality unequalled by presiden
tial productions, save perhaps Lin
coln's, John Quincy Adams' and Jef
ferson's. It is only what the Reformer read
ers expected that his much-heralded
fulmination against the trusts should
prove a rlash-in-the-pnn. Roosevelt
does not lack pluck, but he is also
too much of a politician to pro: ose
party suicide by any real attack on
trusts. So after writing brilliantly
about their evils and at the same time
about the great service the "captain's
of industry" are doing the country, lie
sees nothing to recommend for the pres
ent but publicity, enforced by federal
law, regarding their organization and
operations. It is a curious if not wil
ful blindness that sees no responsi
biltv in the tariif or any other govern
mental' action for the existence of i
trflsts, when the truth is that it is i
there exactly that all that is evil in j
them, their monopoly power, gets its ,
footing, and there precisely that the ,
dividing line is to be found for that j
care and deliberation he invokes not
to strike at legitimate enterprise and
progress while fighting what in now
law-guarded extortion. And it is one
of those half-truths as evil in effect
as lies when he points to trusts in
other countries as proof of his posi
tion. It is hard to believe that a man
of his intelligence does not know that
trusts in the sense of monopolizing
production or unjustly controlling
prices, or as anything more than large
firms or companies, are everywhere the
product of tariffs or governmental
favor, and their evil power everywhere
exactly measured by the extent of
their "protection. "
Of course, arguing this way, he ob
jects to any revision of tho tariff,
echoing the old Carey argument, as
often disproved as seemingly supported
by dates, that such revisions cause
business panic. Of course also he is
decidedly un-Rooseveltian in the gin
gerly way he handles reciprocity,
which he wants to be only the "hand
maiden of tirotection." He omits to
sav what
The news from the Columbian revo
lution is rather exciting this week.
The chief issue underlying it all, as
the Reformer has so often pointed out
with regard to South American
troubles, is that of union of church
and state.
It is as a matter of course that pro
fuse charges come of fraud in the late
election in Alabama ratifying tho con
stitutional amendment disfranchising
the negroes. Ex-Gov. Johnston of
that state formulates them in a way
that admits of neither denial nor
doubt. Most of the counties where
the whites are a majority went against
the amendment, but in those in
which the negroes are a majority by
13,877 the mathematicians figured out
a majority of 21,199 for the amend
ment, or in effect that 35,538 negroes
voted to disfranchise themselves.
Quite naturally these majorities were
announced before the election.
Though no official forecast or even
a hint of it can be obtained, Washing
ton opinion is now pretty well set
tled that tho verdict of the late Court
of Inquiry is to be a complete vindi
cation of Schley, or tit least that
Dewey and Ramsey can be depended
on for such a judgment. Tho reason
for this opinion is of course that as
A LONG, BEAUTIFUL LIFE.
Peacefully Closed-Elizabeth Gladden Esta
brook the Last of a Leading Family Gone.
The next to the oldest resident ami
the last representative hero of a lead
ing family of the last century, passes
from among us in tho death, from old
age, of iUrs. Elizabeth Gladden, 95,
widow of Daniel S. Esterbrook, which
took plaeo Sunday night, at the High
street home of her daughter, Mrs.
Azor Marshall, with whom she had
lived for tho last 25 years. The fun
eral was held Wednesday from tho
house, Rev. E. Q. S. Osgood olliciat
ing, with burial in Prospect Hill cem
etery, Mrs. Esterbrook, tin) daughter
of Rovnll and Martha (Roberts) Glad
den, was born May 19, 18(10, on what
was tlien known as the Gladden farm
on the linnnyvalo road, but from
which the buildings are now all gone,
as are all of that name in town, she
being the hist of seven children of her
family. She wedded Daniel b. Ester
brook in 1S32 and they lived in West
Ilrattleboro until 1S49, when they
moved to this village where he died in
lSOil. Their only son, the late O. I).
Esterbrook, died some three years
ago, and Mrs. Marshall is the only
surviving child, with two of three
grandchildren. Mrs. F. K. Harrows
and Miss Edith Esterhook, and two
great grandchildren, Elizabeth and
Oscar Marshall. Their father and her
grandson, the late Cashier O. A.
Marshall, died in 1HM. Mrs. Ester
brook was for many years a member
of the Unitarian church, and of a rare
sunniness and cheeriness of disposi
tion that made the most of good in
life, kept her heart ever young, and
her interest warm in young people and
in current affairs, and her health re
markably good until her last illness.
She filled indeed beautifully the beau
tiful place of "grandmother."
men come to think over the matter!

WILCOX'S
New York Bargain Store
Has been taking on its attire for
the past three months.
We have been buying and re
ceiving one of the largest and
finest lines of
Xmas Goods
we have ever had. Our motto is,
LOW PRICES and sell hosts of
goods. We expect to sell double
the goods we ever sold before.
DOLL DEPARTMENT.
We have the finest
line of DOLLS ever
found in Brattleboro,
and, right here, let me
say for those that are
going to dress Dolls
for Xmas, now is the
time to buy them and
have them dressed in season, and
they see there is absolutely no chance
in reason for any other verdict.
Schley is having a chance to capitalize
his persecution in money out of abun- i
dant offers for lectures, books, ma
zine articles, etc. One of the offers is
.50,0tXI for 10 lectures. Hut the ad
miral has accepted none of them y ft.
j A census bulletin on manufactures
in Vermont has just been issued. It
I show the capital invested to be 1,547- j
9(il, an increase of 4M.' per cent, since1
1SU0, with an increase of .1-1.3 per cent
j in the number of establishments, .'i.1.
: per cent in the number of employees ;
i (now 29,155), 45. 02 per cent in the:
jwages paid (now $12,17,081) and 50.4 '
: per cent in the value of the product, j
'These increases are all larger than in j
the decade previous, or any before'
that since 1870, and shows how the
state is a gainer from the employment
of capital and energy at home instead
of the "Western investments" that1
proved so illusory. The increase in
the number of manufacturing estab
lishments is especially striking, .14..1
per cent in the last 10 years against
5.5 in the 10 years previous. The per
cent of population now engaged in
manufacture is 8.0 against (1.7 in 1S90.
These are figures that mean an arrest
in the define of Vermont farm values
and on the principle of the home
market presage a continuous upward
movement that has already percepti
bly begun.

maker's trade, and, at the age of 21,
accompanied the late William Robert- i

About two years later, he came to

Holhronk and ! essendeii. In those
days, paper was made by hand, but
Mr. Allen lived to see a great revolu- !
tion in the methods of paper making.

General McCullough's friends are
eager to persuade the public that he
did not give that 7KI to the Odd
Fellows home for poliitcal purposes.
But it is little singular that a man of

Tj.,e .;n, r.wmr,! tr, f'nli.t h e sneaks ' ho season or the season to the deed,
like the old manly Roosevelt. He gets
enthusiastic in speaking of her as a
new republic and of the "weighty rea
sons of morality and national interest"
and "every consideration of honor"
that call for lower duties on Cuban
products. The '1 lain duty'" he here
declares means a hard fight with our
tobacco and sugar interests, but we
may expect to see him stand by his
guns.
As to the Philippines there is no
word of a future policy, but a practi
cal admission that civil rule has been
a failure, which means of course a re
turn to military rule. His description
of our purposes as only to "help those
people upward along the stony and
difficult path that leads to self-gov-ernmenf'reads
nicely until we see what
exact an echo it is of Napoleonic and
British self-excuses for similar agres
sions, and without specific recommen
dations it means just nothing. His
comparison of our philanthropic efforts
in their behalf with other conquerors of
tropical peoples is true enough ; but it
was not long ago that the republic
would have felt insulted by being told
she was a little better in this respect
than the old world.
On civil service reform the presi
dent's words again have the true ring,
and performance thus far accords with
promise that we shall again see prog
ress in this line like that of Grover
Cleveland's time.
The paragraphs on anarchy contain
some brilliant writing; his recommen
dations for the regulation of immigra
tion go beyond what is just or i rac
ticable, but his suggestions for mak
ing a distinct crime for federal courts
to deal with, of attempts on the life of
I or he is generous for political pur
poses only.- St. Albans Messenger.
This is hardly up to the Messenger's
' usual level of courtesy and fairness.
Does it claim that Gen. McCullough's
'benefactions are greater or more fr
qtient now than they have been ever
l since be became a man of large
'wealth? Or in other words does it
believe there is anything exceptional
in ihis liiidlow gift? If not, the ob-
ject being worthy and the time one of
; its need, wouldn't it have been an ex
; hibition of cheapness on the General's
! part to avoid or postpone the gift for
fear of "misconstruction?" The man
is not to be blamed because his gener
osities attract more attention when he
is a candidte than at other times. In
fact nothing is to be said against the
generosity of either McCullough or
Webb. The question is which has the
most brains?

Thanksgiving day was a sister of the j
late Kdwin H. Chase of this town, j
She was born here 7 years ago. In ,
her girlhood days, Ilrattleboro was a I
Mecca for many who sought the bene- j
fits of a water-cure which, half a cen- j
fury and more ago, made the little j
Vermont town famous. Society beaux
and belles from many cities gathereli
here and gayety was foun 1 at all j
times. The opening of a railroal was;
an event which drew to Ilrattleboro
many people to celebrate the occasion, j
and from Xew ork with a party of;
young men came Alfred Gaudelet of I
Paris. France, a graduate of the Uni- j
versiiy of l'aris. It was on this visit
that he tirst met Harriet Hooper j
Chase, whom he soon afterward mar
ried, the wedding taking place fifty ;
years ago. They made their home in
Providence, K. I., until 1S70, when ;
they went to Boston. Mr. Gaudelet I
died in l"7"i. I
Mrs. Gaudelet. had an unusual!? 1
happy faculty of making friends of all
with "whom she came in contact, and
her gentleness, her sweet nature, li
refinement, and also her personal ap
pearance, for she was a woman who
retained to the very last the remark
able beauty of her youth, all served to
draw to her side those who visited her
in her home or whom she met else

The Best Plaster.
A picee of Hanncl dampened with
Chamberlain's Pain Balm and bound
to the affected parts is superior to any
plaster. When troubled with lame
back or pains in the side or chest, cive
it a trial and you are certain to be more
than pleased with the prompt relief
which it affords. Pain Balm also cures
rheumatism. One application gives
relief. For sale by Brooks House
Pharmacv.
