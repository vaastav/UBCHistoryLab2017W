At 2 o'clock r. m, by the Domocrnts of Marshall

The only Lope for the salvation of our liberties
and the restoration of peace and order, id in the
thorough organization and succesa of the Demo
cratic r-rty, and thcrj is no time to be lost.'
By order of the Central Committee,
C. II. RCEVE, Chairman.
M. A. 0. Packard, Scc'y.
We hopo our readers will pardon us
for our allusions to the Chicago Tribune;
but, in justice to the community, rvliere
many copie3 of it are read, it should be
held up by every loyal citizen as one of
the most treasonable and scurrilous sheets
published in the Unin. There is not an
issuoof it but teems with the most bittet
hatred of every principle of government,
and every government official, from the
President on down, that does not coincide
with its views on tho i'igser question.
It does not even possess the desirable
quality, when properly used, of firmness,
but is continually changing from bad to
worse, until it now appears to have at
tained the lowest depths of political deg
radation and infamy.
It was but a few short months ago that
the Tribune chose Fremont for its Apostle
and lavished upon him tho most un
stinted laudations. No praise was too
great for him, no opportuniij'of sounding
hia glory was permitted to pass unim
proved. Finally it became evident that
the administration contemplated his remo
val, and one of the Tribune editors was
dispatched to St. Louis to look into the
manner in which military matters had
been managed in that Department. lie
came he saw he believed that Fie
mont ought to bo removed ! lie returned
and related what he had seen. 1Ü3 asso
ciates would not believe, and another one
of them was dispatched to inquira into
the matter. The scales fell from h"i3 eyes,
and ho returned converted man. The
other two would not believe, and the third
went down to see what had changed the
mind3 ot Iii associates, aud lo ! he re
turned convinced. And yet the fourth,
Thomas-'ike, would not believe, probably
because he knew the proclivities of his
associate for lying, and he went and
returned, as did hig predecessors, fully
convinced that Fremont ought to bo re
raoved. The eye-opener which i3 said to
have operated soellectually on the editors
of the Tribunet was Fremont's refusal
to play into their hands in the
manner in which they desired. Pre
vious to thi3 they wero very wroth with
the President for modifying Fremont's
abolition proclamation, but as they held
the Chicago Post Office by suffrage of tho
administration, they curbed lh;ir ire as
best they could, and toon commence'.
abusing Fremont, themselves. Their
course relative to Secretary Cameron
showed the same inconsistency ; they
commenced denouncing him about the
time they were lauding Fremont, and even
went so far as to notiro the number of
times ho was seen riding with beef con.
tractors ! But now, hoar changed ! lie is
ibe only one of the Cabinet entitled to their
consideration, is far superior to the Pres
ident in fine, he h their Alpha and
Omega. What has brought about such a
change? It is because that while Fre
mont has been stricken down and render
cd powerless, as it were, Cameron has
stolen his wooly horse, and is riding him
against the conservative policy of the
President. Cameron ia known to be a
consummate rascal ; he is not actuated by
philanthropic or patriotic motives, and
hence receives the unqualified endorsement
of th Tribune editors. Having given tho
readers the motives which actuated the
Tribune in its opposition to a Constitution
al method of prosecuting the war, we
will fnvo a few extracts from late numbers
of it which will clearly ßhovr that it 19
doing more injury to the government than
any Democratic papar that has been sup-!
pressed for aiding the rebellion. i
The Grst extract which we make from
tho Tribune, U from its issue of Nov. 22,
and is the first item of reading matter in
the papor:
"Nine citizens cut of every ten endorse
the position taken by tho Secretary of
War, and repudiate that assumed by Sec
retary Smith. Tho genuine (Jnion men
all support tho former, and only the luke
warm and rotten sustain the latter. The
people My: Let every loyal man, whatev
er may be his color, have the privilege of
striking for the Union and human liberty.
By that sign they will conquer and the
Republic will be saved. Away with the
llunkies."
The reader cannot fail to s)e that the
Tribune calls the President and all v ho
are against arming the slaves, as pro
tslaveryitcs and flunkic?.
Speaking of the third order of Gen.
Ilalieck, the Tribune, Dec. 5lh, says:
4,li will be time to discover whether
military orders of this kind originate at
the Capitol, or are mainly and more truly
to bo traced homo to tho pro-slavery sym
pathies, and chivalrous prochviiies of o(li
cers who issue them."
"In heaven's name, why should not
his (Cameron's) recommendation (to arm
the slaves) be approved by the adminis
tration as they are by the people?"
But tho following, from the Tribune of
December 2d, is not excelled by anything
which John Brown, Giddings, Garrison,
or Phillips, has said:
LET TIIC PEOri.G MOVE.
The cauie of lids rebellion i? certainlv known
to all loyal men. Those who still deceive them
selves, cannot long retain their wilful blindness.
Congress is soon to come in session for tho most
important gathering it hn seen in the history of
the country. It is no time for makeshift policies,
no time to darken counsel with wordy harangues,
and measure tint fall short of att lining any end.
Slavery is the root of the present evil, and slavery
or the Union must fall. Freedom nrtst triumph
or the Government, with its heavy freight of the
best interests of the race, must perish among iu
lions. Thcro is one tivns the humM'.'-st rc ider of
the Tribune can do. The voice of tho people
shou'd be heard at Washington. Now is the tim
to prepare and procure sign iturei t memorials to
on r Representatives. We append a form of one,
already b'.'ing extensively circulated in other States.
Let every lover of his country sign this, or some
other of similar bearing. This may be cut out or
copied upon a letter shact, and it will be a work all
can engage in, to roll up the list of names which
will give it weight with Congress.
MK.U9MAL OF THE PEOPLE TO CON
GRESS.
" PROCLAIM LIBERTY TIIItoCOIIOUT AI L THE LAND, TO
ALT. TIIK INHABITANTS THEREOF."
TotheConjresiof te United Stales :
Tie undersigned, citizens of , State of
, respectfully subniit-
Thatasthe present formidable rebellion against
the General Government manifestly finds its root
and nourishment in the system of chattle slavery
at tlie South ; as the leading conspirators are slave
holder?, who constitute an oiigareli avowedly
hostile to all free insttutions ;and as, in the nature
of things, no solid peace can be maintained while
the cause of this treasonable revolt is permitted to
exist ; your honorable Lody is urgently implored
to lose no time in enacting, under the war power,
the oial abolition of .slavery throughout the coun
try liberating unconditionally the blares of all
w ho nre rebels, and, while not recognizing the
right of property in man, allowing for the emanci
pated slaves of such as are loyal to the Government
a fair pecuniary award, in order to facilitate an
amicable adjustment of difficulties; an 1 thus to
bring the war to a speedy and bci.efU'ent termina
tion, and in'lissoluljly to unite all sections and uli
interests ot the country upon the enduring basis
of universal freedom.
TIIK CA KS?: KT IMS'Ü- SCJJS.TZKS.
There wa? no little excitement amonir
tho people when the news of the disagree
ment between the President and Secretary
Cameron was received. Tho explanation
which wo publish on the first page of this
i.suc, caused tho abolition, negro-wcrship-ing
politicians to elongate their counte
nances, and the truo Union men to look
up with a new hope that all might yet be
well.
The President's modification of Fre
mont's proclamation, gavo evidence of
more stamina than his political opponents
had generally given him credit for ; but
Lis modification of Cameron's nefrro
equality report elevates him Slill higher in
tho estimation of all who support the war
for tho Union, and not for abolilioniBm.
The paragraphs which the President eras
ed, and inserted a substitute, advocated
the policy of emancipating the slaves, and
arming them to fi'jht for the Union and
liberty. Upon the refusal of tho Secreta
ry to alter or amend this portion of his re
port, tho President proceeded to erase it
and insert a paragraph which has been
f.ptlr termed as "harmless as a sucking
dovo.M The comes of the report which
had been forwarded to tho principal cities,
were recalled by order of the President,
and their circulation suppressed as far as
possible.
No act of the President has given the
country such indisputable testimony that
he intends to conduct the war as near in
accordance with the constitution as cir
cumstances will permit ; and no act of his
has given such heart-felt satisfaction to the
true Union men, as his modification ot the
Secretary of War.
m
In tho ejpressive language of a cotem
porary, we are almost led to exclaim
Uully for Old Abe! When ho kicks
Cameron out of the Cabinet, we will say it
er tain.
We had intended reviewing some por
tions of the President's Message, but as
many of the Republican papers have pitch
ed into it so savagely, wo concluded it
must bo nearly right. It is to be hoped
that the President will get entirely right,
when we may hrtpo for a constitutional
prosecution of tho war, with a prospect of
success.

Cameron's SIvj;rJ.
We prjser.t the views of tho Louisville
Democrat for the consideration of the con
servative citizens of Indiana. It says :
Wo publish this morning tho wicked
est document that ever emanated from the
pen of man ; and, to our shame be it con
fessed, it i by ono holding high position
in liio auonr;i uovernmciii. ii win ue i
seen that Cameron, tho Secretary of War.
has, contrary to our expectations, advoca
ted tiie arming of the blacks. We have
no language sufficiently strong to express
our horror and indignation at such a
scheme, and the bold, shameless effront
ery with which it is advocated. A schema
capable of being conceived only by a
heart utterly depraved, i3 maintained by
arguments worthy of tho mind that
couceived them. The riht to arm slaves
is more than queslior able; it is absolutely
and entirely a damnablo crime. The
proposition fills us with a sickening hor
ror and disgust. Had Great Britian the
right to employ Indians, and to oder so
much for scalps in tho Revolutionary war?
The whole civilized world has denounced
it. English statesmen have branded it
with tho blackest terms of opprobrium.
Yet its whole black depravity is pure as
tho undriven snow before the horrible
proposition of Cameron. It has not one
redeeming feature. It is totally, utterly
wicked carrying with it the utter des
tiuclion oi tho country, in the midst of
brutal horrors which makes even the
popular stories of St. Bartholomew appear
respectable. If the policy is carried out,
then the country is certainly cursed.
There will be no place where tho AmerU
can citizen can remain in safety ; but, in
;ho ashes of ravaged fields, burning cities,
and broken and violated households, ho
will curso tlia hour ho was born. The
wicked, falso impression which tho Secre
tary of War tries to make, that this free
ing and arming will bo injurious only to
the rebels, is too glaringly absurd for dis
cussion. Arm tho blavea of rebels, and
tho act will do as much harm to the Un
ionist as tho rebel. It changes, as we
have 6aid before, tho wholo contest from
a sacred causo of religion and patriotism
to a John Brown raid. It loses, if car
ried into eirect, all the border slave States,
and, wo firmly believe, some of tho con
servative border fre States. It concludes
the war as effectually as if a hundred bat
tles had been gained by the Southern Con
federacy. There is but ono conclusion to which the
people will come, and that is that Mr.
Cameron mu4t bo removed. When this
policy was first broached, wo htated thou
the necessity plainly. Tho developments

Iloport oflho Secretary of tlc In
tcrior. This report, which in not sufficient gen
eral interest to justify publication in full,
furnishes somo interesting statistics re
garding tho operations of lhe General
Land office, the business of which, the
Secretary states, has been sensibly affected
by the decline of business throughout tho
country. On thft 3'Jth September, 1CCI,
there were .r5, 555, 505,25 acres of the
public lands which had been surveyed,
but not proclaimed for public sale. Tho
lands surveyed and offered at public Bale
previous to that lime, and then subject to
private entry, amounted to 7C,CG2, 735,0 1
acres, making an aggregate of public lands
surveyed and ready for sale of 131.213,
33Ü.C0 acres. Tho net income from sales
during the last fiscal year will hardly
reach tho sum of 200,000. The grants
of swamp and overflowed lands to the
States have absorbed a largo amount of
valuabla lands, and have caused a heavy
drain upon tho treasury. The claims of
iho several States cover an aggicgato of
57,C05,577,10 acres' Tho bounty land
warrants and scrip issued under dilfurent
acts of Congress, previous to September
30, ICG I, embrace an aggregato of 71,
717,172 acres of land.
The propriety of issuing bounty land
warrants to tho volunteers is, tho Secieta
ry Hays a subject of discussion, and must
bo determined by Congress He express
es his disapproval of such grants for 1G0
acres to each volunteer engaged in tho
servico would absorb over one hundred
millions of acres and destroy all hope of
deiiving any revenue from tho public
