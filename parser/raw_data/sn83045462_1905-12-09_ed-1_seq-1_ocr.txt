Address to the Emperor.
A delegation from the Tulu Zemstvo yes
terday presented an address to the em
peror as follows:
"We adjure your majesty to rely on the
peaceful millions of the Russian people,
?who desire freedom without lieense. Your
majesty has removed a burden of 80,000 000
of roubles from the peasants, and you have
promised relief In the matter of land. The
Tula peasants expect help, but not from
the senseless promises of the wicked. Your
majesty will hear the truth not from the
revolutionists,_but from the douma, which
we pray your majesty not to tarry in
calling."
The emperor, after thanking the delega
tion. said In reply:
"For a full realization of the liberties ac
corded It Is necessary primarily to restore
order. This Is only possible with the
hear.y co-operation of all the sons of Rus
sia. I know that the needs of the peasants
are great, aswi to relieve them is my con
stant c-ire. What could be done at present
has be?n done, but there Is still much to
be accomplished, and therefore It Is neces
sary to return to peaceful pursuits and to
direct all your efforts to the furtherance of
tl?e objects In view. If others follow your
good example the work of improving the
peasants' condition and the realization of
the reforms will be greatly simplified."

I
A COMPULSORY BILL
Framed by the Commissioners
to Be Introduced.
BOAKD OF EDUCATION
HAS URGENTLY RECOMMENDED
THE MEASURE.
Senate Committee on the District Will
Give It Careful Attention?
Some Provisions.
The Senate committee on the District of
Columbia will give careful attention during
the coming session to a bill providing for
compulsory education In the Dietrlot of Co
lumbia. Such a bill was before the lost
Congress with the approval of the Com
missioners. It was reported to the Senate
favorably by Senator Dillingham, but it
shared the fate of many other measures
that tvere not started on the way through
Congress until a late day. The bill was not
introduced in the Senate until January 5
of the present year, and was reported to
the Senate February 28. But at that late
date there was little chance for the pass
j age of any bill that had not already gone
1 through the House.
The same bill that was reported to the
Senate will again be Introduced by Sena
tor Gallinger. It Is Intended to provide
an effective compulsory education law for
the District in place of the present law,
' which Is regarded as ineffective and obso
lete. The bill has been prepared by the
Commissioners upon recommendations from
the board of education. It is believed to
contain the best features of the most mod
ern state laws bearing upon the subject.
More School Accommodations.
It has not been regarded as practical to
enforce such a law until the provision of
buildings for schools in the District fur
nished accommodations for all who applied
and for a gradual increase in the number
of attendants, it is believed that thaX time
has arrived, although more buildings are
needed. At any rate, the present school
accommodations are sufficient for many of
the children who are now kept out of the
schools. In order that all children can be
accommodated it will be necessary to have
additional school facilities, but at the same
time there is no reason why the work of
bringing in the delinquents should not be
gin at once.
The superintendent of public schools esti
mates that there are 5.0T.0 children of school
ag?- who are not enrolled iii the schools of
the District of Columbia. During the pres
ent term no child applying for enrollment
has been turned away from the schools, and
the number of half-day schools is being
materially decreased. It Is said that there
1b practically no truancy on the part of the
scholars who are enrolled. In the entire en
rollment of about 50,000 it is said that there
are no more than about 130 habitual tru- |
ants. There are no half-day schools be
yond the first three grades, and there will
soon be no more third-grade schools that
do not run the entire day.
Provision of the Bill.
The bill for compulsory education pro
vides that children between eight and four
! teen years of age shall be regularly In
structed in the elementary branches of
knowledge. Including reading, writing, Eng
lish grammar, geography and arithmetic,
unless their physical or mental condition is
I such as to render such attendance or ln
| ?structlon for the whole period Impracticable.
| For failure on the part of the persons hav
ing control of a child to meet the require
ments of this law trial In the Police Court
I and a fine of not more than $50 or imprlson
i ment of not to exceed sixty days are pro
vided.
The bill also provide* that Incorrigible or
vicious children of school age shall be sent
to ungraded schools for Instruction, and
the beard of education is authorized to es
tablish such schools. In order to enforce
this act the board of education is authorized
to appoint seven persons, who shall be des
ignated "attendance officers" and shall re
ceive a salary of $?0<' per annum for such
services. The bill also provides that no
child under sixteen years of age shall be
employed in any factory or mercantile es
tablishment or in any business that will
prevent the child froim attending school dur
ing the day. Any person making a false
statement concerning the age of a child In
this connection may be fined S20. If any
parent or guardian shall be unable to send
a child to school, in compliance with this
act, the board of education may take such
action as in its discretion may be ueemed
necessary.
The Bill In the House.
Next Monday Representative Babcock of
Wisconsin, chairman of last year's District
committee, and who will hold the same
post In this Congress, will reintroduce the
bill providing for compulsory education in
tho District of Columbia.

DISMISSED THE CHARGES.
Allegations Against Hull Inspector
Gordon at St. Louis.
Secretary Metcalf of the Department of
Commerce and Labor today dismissed the
charges made by the World's Fair Naviga
tion Company of St. Louis against Archi
bald Gordon, local inspector of hulls at that
port. The Investigation was conducted by
Assistant Secretary Murray and Deputy
Commissioner of Corporations Smith. Sev
enteen charges In all were preferred, In
general, alleging official Incompetency, mis
conduct and Improper discrimination be
tween steamboat owners, as well as acts of
oppression against particular owners. Both
parties wrre represented by counsel and a
number of witnesses, as well as the records
of the office, were examined.
The report of the committee stated that
they found nothing In Inspector Gordon's
conduct of Ills office wh'.ch would merit
'TWAS A
even censure, much less removal; that wh'!?
hi? made certain mistakes, they were either
errors of law In the necessary Interpreta
tion of some legal questions, or were due to
an earnest and conscientious desire to
bring about a proper condition of affairs on
the steamboats in his Jurisdiction.
The charges were declared to be wholly
frivolous and without merit, and It vai
stated that "In the making of them and 111
the effort to sustain them, there was not
Indicated a genuine desire on the part of
the complainants to improve the efficiency
of the steamboat inspection service, but
rather some other motive having nothing
properly to do with the efficiency or Integ
rity of the inspector's work."

TWO VACANCIES.
Places to Be Filled on the Senate Dis
trict Committee.
There are two vacancies on the Senate
committee on the District of Columbia, Sen
ators Stewart and Foster of Washington
not being in the present Congress.
The committee on committees ia at work

mittee assignments. It Is understood that
Senator Allee desires membership on the

he wifcl obtain it. SenatOT A'lee Is a man of
wide business experience and has expressed
great interest In the upbuilding of the Dis
trict of Columbia to make It a fitting home
of the nation.

AWAITING FRANCE'S BEPLY.
Venezuela Looking for a Response to
Castro's Proposition.
Mr. Veloz-Golticoa. the Venezuelan charge
d affaires, was at the State Department to
Cay, but obtained no news from the offi
cials regarding the reply of the French
government to President Castro's proposi
tion of November S offering to withdraw
his note to M. Taigny provided the lai
tcr's note, which brought It out, is with
drawn at the same time. From the delay
In the French reply It Is inferred in diplo
matic circles that this matter Is regarded
as point d'honneur by the French govern
ment, which. If true, may lead to further
complications. Meantime newB from the
French squadron Is to the effect that It
Is still at Martinique, with no .'ndlcatlon or
hostile action.
NOT A NEW CONDITION.
Diplomatic Relations Between Great
Britain and Central America.
An inquiry in diplomatic circles about the
proposed diplomatic relations between
Great Britain and the Central American
state* shows that the appointment of Mr.
Carden, formerly British consul general
In Havana. Cuba, as minister to all the
Central American states does not create a
new condition In the relations between the
British Empire and those states. Great
Britain has always had but one minister
for those five states, and while Guatemala
| was usually his residence, he spent part of
each year in each of the countries to
| which he was accredited. The other Eu
ropean powers have followed the same rule
and the United States Is the only country
which has two diplomatic representatives
for the Ave states of Central America.

SEIKO II DESERTER
Germans Violate the Sover
eignty of Brazil.
LOCAL LAWS IGNORED
WARSHIPS SENT TO PREVENT A
SIMILAR OCCURRENCE.
It is Believed That Germany Will Give
Prompt end Full Redress for the
Action of the Officers.
The Brazilian embassy in this city has
received a telegram from Baron da Rio
Branco, the minister of foreign affairs, stat
ing that a few days ago several of the
officers of the German gunboat Panther
went ashore in civilian dress and visited a
small fishing town called Itajahy, In the
state of Santa Catilina, and there, without
form of legal process, arrested a man
named SteinhofT, who hid deserted from
the German army, and made him prisoner
on the Panther. Thereupon the gunboat
loft Itajay and went to another state, Kio
Grande do Sul. The three Brazilian cruis
ers, the Almirante Barraro, the Benjamin
Constant and the Tamandare, were sent to
watch the Panther and see that no more
such occurrences should happen, while the
Brazilian government made an official pro
test to the German government.
Relations Have Been Cordial.
Mr. Sylvino Gurgel do Amarai, first sec
retary of the Brazilian embassy, declared
this morning that the relations between
Germany and Brazil have of late been very
cordial, and when the present minister of
foreign affairs, Baron de Rio Branco, left
Berlin, where for several years he had rep
resented Brazil, the enrperor made It a
special j oint to express the utmost good
will. The Panther incident is greatly re
gretted at the Brazilian embassy, though
It is felt thai Germany will certainly give
promfit and full redress for what at tirst
report appeared to be a severe breach ot
international law. It is not known under
whose orders the officers of the Panther
acted, or whether they started out on shore
with the intent of taking Steinhoff a pris
oner, and in that case why they went in
civilian dress. Itajahy is a small fishing
village with perhaps a policeman or two,
and without any power to prevent the cap
ture of the German, who was found in a
small hotel.
Senor Nabuco, the Brazilian ambassador,
called at the State Department shortly be
fore noon and in Secretary Root's tempo
rary absence had an interview with Acting
Secretary Bacon. It is understood the am
bassador communicated to Mr. Bacon, as
a matter of information, the cable advices
he had received from his own government,
but made no effort at this stage to interest
the department.
Opinion in Naval Circles.
The opinion prevails in naval circles here
that if the facts are as represented the Ger
man government will promptly disavow the
action of the officers of the Panthcir in vio
lating the sovereignty of Brazil. Our own
naval practice in the treatment of deserters
in foreign ports is said to involve the con
sent of the local authorities to the landing
of a master-at-arms or a marine guard for
the purpose of arresting deserters. That
consent has never been refused, and In fact
the port authorities frequently themselves
request the commander of a foreign naval
vessel to send ashore and apprehend desert
ers or boisterous sailors.
But if in this particular instance Stein
hoff was not a sailor at all, nor attached
to the Panther's personnel, but simp'y a
deserter from the German army, then ac
cording to United States practice, he would
be regarded as a political refugee and thus
would not be liable to arrest even by the
local authorities.
The affair Is particularly deprecated here
because of the location in southern Brazil
where Germanizing influences are asserted
to have been at work for a long time ex
citing the suspicion of th? Brazilian gov
ernment.
MR. SHAW'S AID.
Will Anticipate the January Interest
Payments.
Secretary Shaw today gave some assist
ance to the financial stringency In New
York by deciding to anticipate the Janu
ary interest payments, which will put over
54,200,000 more money in circulation several
weeks in advance of the usual time. The
statement issued by Secretary Shaw is as
follows:
"The Secretary of the Treasury announces
that he has authorized the payment of the
interest on United States government bonds
due January 1, 1906, on December 15, 1905.
Coupons due January 1 will be paid on
presentation on and after December 15.
Checks for the interest on registered
bonds will be paid on the same date. The
amount of interest anticipated is about
$4,200,000."
WILL NOT APPOINT COMMITTEE.
The Vice President to Take No Action
Regarding the Mitchell Funeral.
Vice President Fairbanks announced to
day that it was his understanding that
friends of the late Senator Mitchell of Ore
gon would not request tiiat a committee of
senators be appointed to attend the funeral
services, and therefore he would not name
one. It has not been determined what
course will be taken by the Senate when It
convenes Monday, but It is assumed that
an announcement of Senator Mitchell's
death will be made by Senator Fulton, and
that he will not ask for the adoption of res
olutions of respect.
This will be the first Instance In the his
tory of the Senate where the customary
ceremony In honor to the memory of a de
ceased member has not been held.

BASIS OF DATE BILL
Measure That May Be Report
ed by Senate Committee.
MR.DOLLIVER'S OPINION
THREE PROPOSITIONS THAT
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED.
Measure Framed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, the Senator
Thinks, Will Be Preferred.
Senator Dolliver is convinced that th?
bill framed by the interstate commerce
commission for the regulation of railroad
uates will b? the basis of the bill to be re
ported from the Senate committee on ln
teietate commerce. That measure will bo
emended, in his opinion, by the committee
before it is reported, but It will be the
basis of the committee's bill.
"There are Just three propositions of rate
legislation in the Senate." sniJ Senator
Dolliver to lay when speaking of rate leg
lslttion In the Senate. "They are the For
aker bill, the proposition of Semtor Elkins
and the interstate commerce commission's
draft of a bill. Neither the Forager bill
nor Senator Elkins" suggestion will meet
gei eral approval In the committee
Probable Action.
"The committee will undoubtedly adopt
In substance, although not necessarily In
form, the provisions contained In what ia
known as the Interstate commerce commis
sion's bill. Much matter will be eliminated
from It, but the central proposition In re
lation'to the powers and duties of the com
mission will constitute the basis of the Sen
ate bill."
"How about the charge that under the
Interstate commerce commission bill tha
commission will be the detective, prosecut
ing attorney and judge?" Mr. Dolliver was
asked.
"Such objections do not arise fiom any
amendment that is proposed to Die exist
ing law. Whatever basis there Is for such
a charge arises l'rom powers conferred upon
the commission by existing law."
The Elkins Proposition.
"What is the defect of the Elkins proposi
tion that mak;is it unsatisfactory as a
means erf securing the results referred to in
the message of the President?"
"The Elkins proposition first provides
that the complaint shall be heard before
the Interstate commerce commission, and
after they have decided it the bill transfer*
the entire controversy to the court*, and in
the process confers upon the courts powers
which they have repeatedly said they can
not constitutionally exercise."
"In what lmportunt respect does the For
aker bill fail to secure the d-.sired re
sults?"
"Those who ilo not ngiee with Senator
Foraker claim that his bill Is impracticable
ns a remedy for the evils of rate-making
that we are seeking to overcome, though
the best lawyers consider It constitutional.
It may be that in so far as it preserves the
most vulnerable parts of the Elkins law of
1903, it can he added to the amendments
now sought to the administrative features
of the existing law. as an alternative rem
edy to be used within the discretion of tba
commission."
