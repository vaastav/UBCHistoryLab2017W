NEARING A QUARTER MILLION
ThM year will' end with the popula
tion of Lo« Angeles marked up to be
tween 820,000 and 225,000.
That statement Is made on the basis
of the same ratio of increase that
marked the year 1904. There Is reason
to believe that the proportionate in
crease has b<»en considerably greater
this year than last, and the figures
Riven above ma/ be regarded as con
servative. Superintendent Mulholland
of the water department, who has Bub
stantlal data on which to estimate the
growth of the city's population, said re
cently; "In the last year we have prob
ably added 80,000 persons to our popu
lation." Lnst spring the population
was figured an 201,249, on a conserva
tive basis, and the Increase since then
has been' sufficient to warrant the es*
tlmate given for the close of the pres
ent year.
The building statistics for the eleven
months onding with November leave no
doubt that T<os Angeles will approxi
mate 225,000 when we bid farewell to
1 Po.">. The totnt value of building Im
provements for the year wilt, exceed
by a good margin $15,000,000. Tho per
mits for building during the year will
go well above the 0000 mark, probably
teaching !)">OO.
A comparative showing of building
statistics for lust year and this ona
leaves no question that the city's popu
lation la Increasing now tn greater
ratio than ever hefore. The permit rcc»
ord for the eleven months of last yenr
ending with November was 6506 und the
value of building improvements for the
same time was $11.881,fifir.. This year
tor a like pefiod the permit record is
Js7fiß mid Iho value record $14,087,686. The
gain this year over last, tlifieforn, dur
ing the eleven months 15\2351 in per
mits and $2,208,021 In value!
Hut go back a little farther and com
pare these figures with those-. relating
to the last two years of tho old cen
tury. For 1899 the number of building
permits Issued In November was 137,
for 1900 It was 146, while for 1905 It
was 543. The value of building Improve
ments represented by the permits was
$15«,651 In 1899, $197,917 in 1900 nnd
$1,259,265 In 1905.
And at this time next yei^r, with a
continuance of present conditions, the
population of Los Angeles will be
above the line of the quarter million
mark.
FRANKLIN K. LANE
The announcement that President
Roosevelt will appoint Franklin K.
Lane to fill a vacancy In the interstate
commerce commission Is creditable
both to the president's discernment and
his Independence. Mr. Lane was the
Democratic candidate for governor in
opposition .to. Dr. Pardee and came
within a few hundred votes of being
elected. .. He la one of California's best
and brightest' representative men. Ho
will succeed a Republican In the com
j mission. -- '- /
It Is exceedingly important to the
great shipping- Interests of the., west
that a Californlan be upon the inter
state commerce board. It la particu
larly important to the Southern Califor
nia citrus fruit interests that such a
representative should, know something
of the conditions in this section and
sympathlz* with the , transportation
burdens that might easily and safely
be lightened. Franklin X.' Lane Is that
kind of a representative and his ap
pointment will be heartily approved,
not only by democrats but by Republi
cans as well.
SAN PEDRO AND ORIENT
The project of a Hteamßhip line to
fily • between San Pedro and oriental
ptrts, to which The Herald has alluded
frequently, Is near the materializing
point. Like all initial enterprises of
that kind, the beginning will be rather
unpretentious, but it will give promise
of early growth. It will be. according
to the plan outlined, similar to the
service established, six years ago be
tween gan Diego and certain parts of
the • orient. That service was intro
duced by the Santa Fe Hallway com
pany in order that It might compete
with the Southern Pacific in transpa
cific freightage. The latter company had
its steamship lino plying from San
Francisco, but the Santa Fe company
nad no ocean outlet, its rail connection
with San Francisco not having been es
tablished at that time.
The proposed transpacific line from
San Pedro, ltke the ono that was ope
rated about a year from San Diego,
will be served, as understood, by steam
ships chartered from a large British
shipping corporation. The service will be
confined chiefly to freightage, the pur
pose for which such vessels are built,
although, a very few passengers may be
taken as waa the case In the San Diego
service.
As heretofore stated in The Herald,
the gait Lake Railway company Is the
reported sponsor for the proposed
steamship line to ply from San Pedro.
The British company probably will ope*
rate the line under charter or other
agreement whereby the Salt . Lake
company guarantees the' supply of
freightage.
The similar plan whereby the San
Diego line was operated gave satisfac
tory results and would have been con
tinued but for the railway connection
to San Francisco which the Santa
Fe company established. If San
Pedro harbor had 'been available
at that time the transpacific service
undoubtedly would have become per*
manent. The having of ISO miles
of railway haul by ueing San
Pedro Instead of San Diego as a ship
ping port would have been an Import
ant matter then, as It will be In the
future.
The primary object of the Santa Fe
company in Ua Nteumshlp enterprise,
was to ship cotton tv Japan, and iin
uieuso quantities of the staple were
shipped while the Hue was operated.
Probably the cotton shipments are a
leading factor In the calculation for the
isun i'udi-o •teanwhlv Hue. The relu.
LOS ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, igos.
tlons 6f the Salt Lake and Southern
Pacific companies nre so Intimate that
It Is quite probable the purpose of tha
latter company Is to save the haul of
Texas cotton from Los Angeles to San
Francisco, and ship Instead from San
Pedro.
It Is said that the Ban Pedro nnd
oriental steamship line will be In ope
ration early In March. It will be the
first of a series of ocean steamship
lines, with San Pedro rs (i loaning
point, that will be In evidence within
the next five years.
THE PRESIDENT'S BACKING
A peculiar feature distinguishing the
present congress Is foreshadowed. It
will be the substantial lining up of
Democratic members In . support of
President Hoosevelt on leading meas
ures that will divide tho Republican
members. That situation Is practical
ly assured In respect to the railway
rating Issue, and It Is likely to appear
In regard to the question Involving
the Panama rnnnl plan. And us this
will be an exceptionally "strenuous"
session, In relations between tho Pres
ident and tin; Republican lenders in
congress, that peculiar situation mny
expand much farther,
Leading Democratic congressmen
express the opinion that but few mem
bers, on their Hide, will be HRuinst a
bill FinboAyliig the President's views
In the matter of railway rate control.
On the other band, It Is known that
a powerful combination exists, led by
the moat Influential Hepubllean sena
tors and representatives, pledged to
kill tho vital Issue In the President's
plan. Thnt Issue Is (lie immediate ef
fectiveness of a ruling by" the inter
state commerce commission. The op
ponents of the president are pledged
to the Foroker plan which holds In
abeyance a ruling of the commission
until the point .'it issue, is vassed upon
by a federal court. That scheme would
hang up a ruling Indefinitely.
The earnc 'Influence which will fight
the railway rating proposition Is like
ly to fight the plan for a lock canal
systeni at the Isthmus. The. railway
companies favor the sea-level plan be
cause it will delay completion of the
canal many years.
And so the Interesting spectacle will
be presented of the Democratic minor
ity lined up rather solidly as backers
of the president In these issues against
a large contingent, at leant, of Repub
lican members.
The San Diego Tribune charges that
the newspapers of Los Angeles are
united In "an organized and systematic
endeavor" to belittle the handsome
city by the sea, and that "no oppor
tunity is overlooked by The Herald of
that city to publish editorial slurs upon
San Diego."' All of which is news to
The Herald. "We have the highest ad
miration for Hnn Diego and had
thought The Herald particularly gra
cious towards Its contemporary. Maybe
the Tribune ia "Jls naturally mulish."
An aerla) ■ - transportation service
across the British channel is announced
by a French aeronaut. This person has
made several airship voyages on the
proposed route and he promises a reg
ular passenger service between Lon
don and Parts. Automobile votaries
will bo patrons of tho line, no doubt, as
it will suggest that pleasing thought,
like auto speeding, "life is but a span."
In a fierce little assault upon The
Herald because It coupled the ports of
San Diego and San Pedro in a compli
mentary mention, the San Diego Union
says: "San Diego is not worrying over
the attitude of any San Francisco in
terests toward the harbor here." No,
probably not. Mr. Spreckels of San
Francisco Is not worrying over Mr.
Spreckels of San Diego, either.
During tho last five years, says Sec
retary Wilson of the agricultural de
partment. In his annual report, "pros
perous conditions and tho better direct
ed efforts of tlir farmers themselves
have Increased tho value of their farms
38.5 per cent, or an amount approxi
mately equal to $(!.133,0O0,OUO." To
paraphrase, "Where the farmer sits Is
the head of tho table."
John T. Brady, whom tho governor
has appointed to till tho vacancy
caused by the death of County Super
visor O. W. • Longdon, is understood to
have been supported for the place by
the local Republican machine. He*bld3
fair to niake an efficient supervisor,
however, and ho will enter upon his
duties with the best wishes of all his
constituents.

Boys Throw Out Hints

The boys have been looking forward

"Should you wish," says the 3adger,
"to send him wearing apparel, a pair
of pink garters would not be out ot

MINISTERS HOLD DISCUSSION
"The Fatherhood of God" Proves an
Interesting Subject for
Pastors
"The Fatherhood of God," a paper
read by Rev. Arthur Johnson of Saw
telle before the Methodist Ministers'
meeting yesterday morning, called
forth a spirited discussion on the sub
ject. Rev. Mr. Johnson contended that
the fatherhood of the Supreme Being
was extended to the spiritual only. To
this the ministers present objected and
a spirited discussion resulted, in which
Drs. Mclntyre, Pltnerand Rider took
part.
Dr. Mclntyre spoke at length, say-
Ing that a child ot God Is always such.
Dr. Mclntyre said that the lost sheep
remained a sheep and not a coyote;
that the lost coin remained silver and
so humanity remains humanity despite
transgressions.
Following the meeting a large num
ber of dlcrgymen enjoyed a luncheon
at the T. W. C. A. and later attended
a lecture by Prof. Wurman on cales
thenlcs.
Tho association will meet next Mon
day at th«i University of Southern Cali
fornia. Prof. Dickson will speak on
"Henry Druminond." Luncheon will
be served.
