Congress Oommenoos.

Washington, Dec. 0. The regular,
or long, session of congress, as it is
called, because there is no constitu
tional limitation upon the period of its
duration, opened at noon to-day. The
leaders and a large majority of the
members of both houses were here to
participate in the opening ceremonies,
and President McKinley had made the
journey to Washington from the bed
side of his dying mother that his ab
sence might not delay the national
legislature at its assembling. The
extra session robs the opening of the
regular session of the excitement and
interest which usually attaches to
it On the eve of a regular
session, ordinarily, Washington
thrills with excitement. The hotel
lobbies surge with place-hunters in
the wake of the various candidates for
speaker, clerk, doorkeeper, etc.; the
members are struggling for committee
assignments and the air is full of. ru
mors and plots and counter-plots. Hut
as the house was completely organized
at the extra session and all the com
mittee assignments were made then,
beyond the natural stimulus pro
duced by the returning statesmen, the
regular hangers-on of legislation and
the outlining of schemes by members
of the "third house," or lobby, Wash
ington lust night was tranquil.
It is the intention of the house lead
ers to proceed with the business of the
session as rapidly as possible. The
committees will all begin their labors
this week, und as all of them have more
or less bills on hand which were intro
duced at the extra session, there will
be no luck of material for the house to
work on after the committee hoppers
begin to grind. The appropriations
committee has been at work for ten
days and Chairman Cannon expects to
pass at least tvvoof the regular budgets
before the holidays the legislative
executive and judicial and the pen
sions appropriations bills. One or tb
other of these bills, it is expected, will
be reported by Wednesday and the end
of the week promises to see the house
down to business.
Among the early general measures
to receive consideration will be the
bankruptcy bill. Whether it will be
the Nelson bill, which passed the sen
ate at the last session, or a modifica
tion of the Torrey bill, depends on the
temper of the judiciary committee,
which will submit the measure to the
house. Deyond doubt there will be
several resolutions of inquiry during
the first week which may be more or
less sensational, and some of the radi-
cal pro-Cuba members will attempt to
get consideration for a Cuban rsolution
before the foreign affairs committee
can act. Congressman Livingstone, of
Georgia, is ono of these. Hut owing to
the nature of the house rules, all these
hasty efforts will prove abortive, and
they probably will take their course.
There will be nothing except indis-
position on the part of the members
to prevent the senate's entering
promptly upon us work, as there is a
calendar already made for it with
about 800 bills reported from commit
tees during the special session. With
the president's message read, it will
remain for the senate to decide
whether it shall enter seriously upon
the work of the session after to-dav.
or begin a system of delay intended to
throw all important questions over be
yond the Christmas holidays. The indi
cations are now for a little more activ-
ity than usual during the pre-holiday
session. This is largely due to the fact
that the supporters of the administra
tion and advocates of annexation are
very anxious to secure the earliest
possible consideration of the treaty
with Hawaii. Senator Davis, chair
man of the committee on foreign rela-
tions, announces his purpose of press
ing annexation at the earliest possible
moment, but it is probable that the
matter will not be taken up seriously
until the committee can have a meet
ing and decide on the details of pro
cedure. The committee will be called
together on Wednesday for this pur
pose. One point which the committee
will be called upon to decide is whether
to proceed to ratify the treaty of an
nexation or to annex the islands by
resolutions. The annexationists have
lost some votes during the vacation,
and there is now apprehension that the
two-thirds vote necessary to assure the
ratification cannot be secured. Some
members of the foreign relations com
mittee who favor annexation advocate
this course, because they say they see
no reason for traversing the same
ground twice, as they would be com
pelled to do in case the matter should
be first considered in executive session,
fail there, and then be taken up in the
form of a resolution in open senate and
house.
The immigration bill, for which Sen
ator Lodge stands sponsor, is practi
cally at the head of the senate legisla
tive calendar and will be considered
early in the session. Senator Lodge
yesterday repeated his intention of
pressing the bill, but he will not an
tagonize the Hawaiian treaty with it
The first bill on the calendar is Sena
tor Gear's measure providing for the
adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt,
but the sale of the Union Pacific doubt
less will have the effect of causing the
temporary withdrawal of this bill and
the substitution of others. Of the 300
bills on the calendar about 200 are pri
vate pension bills, and all of theso
probably will be disposed of at one
sitting when taken up. There are also
several hundred recess appointments
to be considered in executive session.

In the Truest Senna.
Dr. Scth Tozor, of Iola, Who died re
cently while undergoing a surgical
operation at Indianapolis, was a phi
lanthropist in the truest sense of the
word. He had no children of his own,
but during his life he adopted no less
than ten orphaned children, all of
whom he reared into respectable men
and women. When he caino to die at
Indianapolis one of these orphans,
Mrs. Sarah Grady, was there to close
his eyes.
Dilatory Tactic Not Tolerated.
Marion Williamson, administrator
of the estate of Joseph Rao, secured a
judgment of 83,000 damages against
the M. K. & T. railway company in
the district court of Labette county.
The company appealed to the supreme
court and filed dilatory motions. The
court became satisfied that the rail
road company's object was to delay
and harass Rae's heirs in collecting
their judgment and threw the case out
of court. j"
It Catches Them All.
Some of the county ollicials who
took charge of their offices before the
new fee and salary bill was passed by
the legislature and who have still one
year more to serve, are laboring under
the impression that the new law will
not apply to them. Hut Attorney
Ueneral Uoylo has rendered an opin
ion which holds the law applies to of
fleers who hold over as well as the
newly-elected ones.

Cripples the Tower of the Courts.
Judge Simons, in the Hourbon coun
ty district court, held that the new
Kansas contempt law had left the
state courts powerless to enforce any
orders made in chambers. Under the
new law the courts have no jurisdic
tion in contempt cases except during a
term of court. Trial for contempt by
a jury, he said, was impracticable dur
ing a session of court and impossible
in chambers.
Rays She Is a Legal Juror.
Mrs. K. N. Purdue has been drawn
as a district court juror at Fort Scott,
her name being copied from the tax
rolls through mistake. Mrs. Purdue
lived in Wyoming in 1S90, and as wom
en are enfranchised in that state, she
voted for McKinley. Now she insists
that she is a legal juror, and if her
contention is denied she will carry the
case to the higher courts.
The Record of Eleven Tears.
During the past 11 years, including
1887, the farmers of Kansas produced
over 2,000,000,000 of live stock and
grain. In grain the amount runs up to
S909,168,1S6, and the greatest grain
years were 1801-2. In live stock $1,132,
898,1S4 worth was produced, the great
est year being 18S8, when the value of
live stock exceeded 8131,000,000.

A Kick on Freight Rates.
A number of towns in southwestern
Kansas are complaining of the excess
ive freight rates to that portion. The
rates on coal are especially high, be
ing about one-third higher than those
to towns in eastern Kansas on a haul
of the same length. Railroad Com
missioner Lewelling has taken the
case in hand.
Bitter Attack on Senator Barrls.
In his paper, the Pratt Union, Rep
resentative W. F. Brown, a populist,

the railroads to defeat a maximum
freight rate law.
Kansas Indian Lands.
At the Pottawatomie and Great Ne
maha Indian reservations in Kansas
there are about 10,000 acres of surplus
lands in the prairie land reserve that
are likely to be a subject of contention
in the future, and there seems to be a
growing sentiment in the tribe favor
ing their sale.
The Humble Cow.
The butter making industry has
grown rapidly in Kansas in recent
years. The total value of this years'
dairy products aggregate 85,259,752,
and the average value per cow of the
product is $9.53.

Washinoton, Dec. 0. The annual re
port of James II. Eckels, comptroller
of the currency, for the year ended Oc
tober 81, 1897, opens with with a brief
review of the history of the legislation
which coustitutes the present national
bank act, and invites the attention of
congress to amendments to the law
recommended in former reports with
out specifically repeating them. On
the subject of bank note circulation,
the comptroller says:
In the report of every comptroller of the our
rency during the past 1!0 years the wisdom of
changing the existing luw so that the banks,
und through them tho communities in which
thoy are located, might have the additional
beneftt of an added lonnablo enpltal has been
urged. Despite all this the luw still remains
without amendment Not only should the
bank act bo umended In this particular, but
congress should seriously consider such a
change in tho method of bank note issues as
will enable the banks of the country to more
adequately meet the demands of trade and
commerce in all sections of the country.
liotween the competition of tho government
note Issues on the one hand and iho unneces
sary restrictions imposed by law on tho other,
together with the increasing price of bonds re
quired to be doposlted as security, the note
Issuing function of the banks has been permit
ted to become merely an Incident to the con
duct of tho nationul banking associations of
the country. It has been seriously suggested
more than once thut the bank noto issue be
done awaylwlth, and all papor bo llsued by tho
government instead. The danger of sueli a
ooursc Is not to be over-estimated. Tho experi
ence of every government has been that gov
ernmental currency paper is a source of weak
ness and danger. In tho United States, where
there has been the nearest approach to success.
with tho volume of tho federal papor compara
tively limited in amount, the credit of the gov
ernment has been moro than oneo put In
jeopardy through It, and tho business Interests
of the oountry subjected to unnecessary loss
and confusion.
Tho argument that the government, better
than tho banks, can provide for tho redemp
tion of paper noto Issues will not stand tho
test of a careful analysis. The government has
no means of caring for Its demand liabilities
except through borrowing and through tho
levying of taxes. Upon tho other hand tho
banks have assets which oan bo promptly con
verted into cash to meet their outstanding
notes when presented. Their ability to com
mand gold has always been beyond that of tho
government, for In each tinunciul exigency
which has confronted tho government the
banks have furnished to it the amounts neces
sary to maintain Its solvency. It is Impossible
to believo that with a system of bank note
Issues, based In part upon securities and in part
upon bank assets, tho country cannot be pro
vided with sound, safe and elastic bunk note
Issue, always commensurate with und respon
sive to tho demands of trade.
The total number of national banks organ
Ized since the system was put into operation. In
1883, is shown to have been 6,0115. On October
81 last there were In active operation 8,817,
hnvlng an authorized capital of Mil), 230, 295.
Tho total outstanding circulation of the banks
then outstanding was J229, 109.8S0 of which K2U2,-
994,655 was secured by bonds of tho United
States and tho balance by lawful money de
posited with the treasurer of tho United
Statos, The circulation outstanding of all na
tional bonks on October 81 last was 230,13l,0O5,
of which amount 1,S:8,800 was secured by
bonds held for account of insolvent and liqui
dating banks and 126.205,333 by lawful money
deposited for their account and by active banks
reducing circulation. Tho net decreano In tho
amount of circulation secured by bonds during
the year was i2,fim,;4 and the gross decrease
In the total circulation was 14,851,292,
During the year 44 banks were organized
with an aggregate capital stock of 6,420,000.
During the year 71 banks went into voluntary
liquidation.

piled statistics relative to the world's
