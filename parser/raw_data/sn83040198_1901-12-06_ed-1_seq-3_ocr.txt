The following 'is. a comprehensive sum
mary of President "Roosevelt's message to
congress: '
The president begin his fitst annual
communication with an official announce
ment of the death of the late Pres.dent
IdcKlnley, and a eulogy of his. iormer
chief In which he says:
"It Is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKinley's death ha
was the most widely-loved man in all the
United States, while we have-never had
any public man of his position who has
mosities incidenS to public life. His po
litical opponents were tho first to bear
the hfirrit"Kt and most eenerous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity
In public life he united the tender aiTec
tions and home virtues which are all
Important In the makeup of national
character. A gallant soldier in the great
war for the union, he alio shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct In the-most sacred and intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him. for he never act
ed with aucht but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fa!l to
respect him who knew him In public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to ficuse tkeijf
criminality, by asserting that It is txrr
cLsed for political ends inve!h against
wealth and irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this biso apology
cannot be urtred."
"The shock, the grief of the country, are
bitter in the minds of all wno saw !h
dark days while the president yet hovered
between life and death. At last the light
was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the
breath ent from the lips that even in
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
bis friends and of unfaltering trust In the
wilt of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with Infinite sorrow, "but with such
pride In what he had accomplished and in
bis own peisonal character that we feel
the blow hot as struck at him. but as
struck at the nation. Wo mourn a good
and great president who Is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of his' life and the
grand heroism with which he met his
death."
In the same connection, he makes
strong recommendations as to how the
nation should deal witn anarcny. .tie
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
prevent anarchists from foreign countries
landing upon our shores. He would also
"have the federal courts given jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or any
the presidency. He has no fear, however,
that the country wllj ever fall Into an
archy. 8 I t
The federal courts 'should be given Jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who by theconstltutlon or by law is in
dne of succession for the presidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to the
enormity of the offense against our- in
stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
bum an race, and all mankind should band
against the anarchist. His crime should
be made -an offense against - the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade, for it
Is of far blacker Infamy than either. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties wo aid
ive to the federal government the power
f dealing with the crime."
The Trusts.
The president sees cause for congratu
latioa tor the nation in the business condi
tions of the present, but sees in the tre
mendous and highly complex industrial
development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half
of the nineteenth century'' a serious social
Srobiem forcthe present and future. He
oes not believe that the old laws and oid
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes in the business world, op
erating In other countries as they operate
In our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part dot which is wholly
without warrant. It is not true that as
the rich have grown richer the poor have
crown poorer. On the contrary, never be
fore has the average man, ' the wage
worker, the farmer. he small trader,
been so well off as In this country and
t the preeent time. .There have been
abuses connected with the apcumulation
or wealth, yet It remains true that a for
tune accumulated In legitimate business
can be accumulated by the person v spe
cially benefited only on condition of con
rerrlng immense incidental benefits upon
there. Successful enterprise of the type
7"bI?h benefits all mankind can only ex
ist If the conditions are such. as fo offer
areat prizes as the rewards of success
But while he realizes existing condi
tions, he emphasizes the fact that corgress
in providing remedies must act with cau
tion, as the men and corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
railroads across the continent have done
irreat good to pur people, and without
tnem the material development of which
we are so justly proud" could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog

trood the strong and forceful'men upon
whom the success of business operations
inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions will satisfy anyeno
capable of forming a Judgment that the
-personal equation is the mcst important
factor in a business operation: "that the
business ability of the man at the head of
any business concern, big or little. Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking success and hopeless failure."
Another reason for caution in trustlegis
lation which he gives "Is to be found in the
International commercial conditions of to
day. The same business conditions which
nave proaucea me great aggregations of
corporate and individual wealth have
tnado them very potent factors In Inter
national commercial competition. Busi
ness concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are managed
by the ablest men are naturally those
. which take the lead In the strife for com
mercial supremacy among the nations of
the world. America has only Just begun
to assume that commanding position in
tne international Dusmess world which
we TtwliPVA will more nnrl morn tu ho t.
Is of the utmost importance that this po
sition be not Jeoparded, especially at a time
when the overflowing abundance of our
. wn natural resourcs and the skill, busi
ness energy and mechanical aptitude of
. our people make foreign markets essen
tial, unaer sucn conditions it would be
most unwise to cramp or to fetter the
youthful strength of our nation.
Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed
out that to strike with Ignorant violence

inevitably endangers the Interests of all.
The fundamental rule in our national life,
the rule which underlies all others, is that
on the whole and in the long run we shall
go up or down together. There are excep
tions, and in times of prosperity some will
prosper far more and. in times of adversi
ty some will suffer far more than others;
but, speaking generally, a period of good
times means that all share more or less
in them, and In a period of hard times all
feel the stress to a greater or less degree."
He points to the fact that in the past
"the ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective friend of the
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing In dealing with business interests
tor the government to undertake by
crude and ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that it would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
forces with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find out in rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and in what manner it is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies for the Trust Evil.
But while he says the above Is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
chlel is over capitalization,- "because ot
its many baleful consequences." He saysi
"The conviction of the American people
that the great corporations, known t-.s
trusts, are in certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
is based upon sincere conviction that com
bination and concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable limits controlled, and in my
judgment'this conviction Is right."
As a remedy tor these evils he says:
"The first essential In determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations is knowledge .of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the public
the government should have the right to
inspect and examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in Inter
state business. Publicity Is the only sure
remedy which we can now Invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
fit governmental regulation or taxation
can only be determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
in the course of administration. The "first
requisite is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to DroDer erovernmental supervision, and
full and accurate information as to their 1
operations should be made public regu
larly at reasonable Intervals."
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, - though organized In one
state, always do business in many states,
often doing very little business In the
state where they are incorporated. There
is utter lack of uniformity In the state
laws about them,- and as no state has
any exclusive interest in or power over
their acts It has in practice proved Im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore in the
Interest of the whole people the nation
should, without Interfering with the pow
er of the states in the matter Itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporatlpns doing an inter
state business. This is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of Its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency In its
business. There would be no hardship in
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it. and In their case it la now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed it
Is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so-far as Is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them jby so
conservative a state as Massachusetts In
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that It will be
possible to secure' the needed remed'e3
for the trust evil under thj constitution
as It now exists, but If congress thinks
otherwise he recommends that a constitu
tional amendment be subm tted tnat will
eo. f er the po -e? necessary.
In connection with the irusts he rec
ommends legislation creating a cabinet of
ficer, to h kr-own ts seeierary of :ti
n ; nos : ties wouil be to dal
with all qu - scions concern', g comn.crce
later and the merchant manne. - '
Would Exclude the Chinese.
The message Von tains a strong recom
mendation for t! e reenactment at once
of the prvsent Chinese exclusion act. in
which connection he says:
d'Wages are higher to-day in the United
States than ever before in our history
and far higher than in any other coun
try. The standard of living is also higher
than ever before. Every effort of -..s-lator
and administrator should be bent to
secure the permanency of this condition
of things and Its improvement whernver
possible. p Not only must our labor
protected by the tariff, but it should also
be protected so far as It is possible from
borers brought over by contract or of
these who co"a;1n'? freely,, yet represent
a standard of living so decreased thit
they can undersell our men in the labor
market and drag them to a lower level
I regard It as necessary, with this- end
In view, to reenact immediately the law
excluding Chinese . laborers and to
strengthen lt wherever necessary In or
der to make its enforcement entirely ef
fective." He als recommends such legislation, hv
,uiCJ3olt commerce
law. as will protect the labor of one state
from competing with the prison labor of
another state,, and also that the govern
ment cease being "a parly td this competi
tion by not purchasing goods made either
byl?XIct labor or that ln which women
and children are caused to work excessive
hours or at night.
q ln the labor unions of the:present he sees
iimi.il tun is uuuhiu wnicn connection he
says :
"Very great good has been and will be
accomplished by associations or unions
of wageworkers when- managed with
forethought and when they combine in
sistence upon 'their own rights with i
abiding respect for the rights of others
The display of these qualities in such
bodies Is a duty, to the nation no less
than to the associations themselves.
Finally there must also in many cases be
action by the government in order to
safeguard the rights and Interests of all
Under, our constitution there is much
more scope for such action by the state
andthe municipality than by the nation.
Put on points such as those touched on
above the national government can "act.
."When all Is said and done, the rule of
brotherhood remains as the indispensable
prerequisite to success In the kind of na
tional life for Which . we strive. Eacti
man must work for himself, and unlsss
he bo works no outside help can avail
hlm.But each man must remember also
that -ne is indeed his brother's keeper,
and that while 'no man who. refuses to
walk can be carried o with advantage to
himseii or.myone eise, yt tnat each at
times stumbles or halts, that each at.
times needs to have the helping hand out
stretched to him. To be permanently ef
fective aid must always tnkc the form of
helping a man to help himself, and we
can aU best help ourselves by Joining to
gether in the work that is of common in
terest to all."
The Immigration Larva.
He pronounces our present immigration,
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
he says "we need every honest and ef
ficient immigrant fitted to become an
American citizen,- every Immigrant who
comes here to stay, who brings hrre a
strong body, a good head and a resolute
purpose to dc his duty well in every way
and to bring up nis children as law-abiding,
God-tearing members of the community."
But he says: o
"There should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of j working a
threefold improvement over our present
system. First, we should aim to exclude
absolutely not only all persons who are
known to be believers In anarchistic prin
ciples or members .of anarchistic socle
ties, but also all persons who are of a
low moral tendency or of unsavory repu
tation. This means that we should re
quire a more thorough system of inspec
tor n abroad and a more rigid system u'
examination at- our immigration ports,
the former being especially necessary.
. "The second object of a proper 'immi
gration law ought to be to secure by a
careful and not merely perfunctory, edu
cational test some Intelligent capacity to
appreciate American institutions and act '
saneiy as American citizens, xnis wouiq
not keep out all anarchists, for many of
them belong to the intelligent criminal
class, but It would do what is also in point
that is? tend to decrease the sum of Ig
norance so potent in producing the envy,
suspicion, malignant passion and hatred
of order out of which anarchistic senti
ment Inevitably springs. Finally all per
sons should 1-e excluded" who are below
a certalr standard of economic fitness to
enter our Industrial field as. competitors
with American labor. There should be
proper proof of personal capacity to earn
an American living and enough money to
Insure a decent start under American con
ditions. This would step the influx of cheap
labor and the resultlrg competition which
gives rise to so much of bitterness In
American industrial 15fe. and It would dry
up the springs of the pestilential social
conditions in our great cities where an
archistic organisation" have their great
est possibility of growth."
The Tariff.
The president does not desire any change
in the present tariff schedule except where
such may be made in reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Every application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties must never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference between
the labor cost here and abroad. The well
being of the wageworker is a prime consid
eration of our entire policy of economio
legislation.
"Subject to this, proviso of the proper
protection necessary to - our industrial
weir being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of . our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in' the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
in the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those "surplus .products by giving us
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar--iff
as to enable, us to take from them
those products which- we can use without
harm to our own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support onee
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
. we are beyond the reach? of successful
competition.

nrB,ipMCSnr -
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
marine "discreditable to us as a nation and
Insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtop in ' other forms of business,"
and says we "should not longer submit to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our greet commerce is carried -in
our own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely 6erve to build up our shipping in
terests, but it would a.lso result, in benefit
to all who are Interested in the, perma
nent establishment ot "h wider market for
American products ar.d would provide an
auxiliary-force for the ravy. Ships work
for their 'own ccur tries just as railroads
work for their terminal points.. Shipping
linos, If established to the principal coun
tries with which we have dealings, would
be of political- as well as commercial ben
efit. . iTom every standpoint it is unwise
for the United State.' to continue to rely
upon th? ships of competing nations for the
distribution of oik -goods. It should be
made advantageous to carry American,
goods In American built ships."
His recommendation on this subject is
enly that "our government should take
such action as will remedy these inequali
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored to tho ocean."
Finances.
Under this heading the president recom
mends such legislation .as will better safe
guard against the .deranging influences of
cgmmercial- crises and financial panics and
such as will, make -the currency of -.the
country more responsive to the demands
of domestic trade and commerce..
He points out- the lact that the receipts
from duties on imports and internal taxes
exceed the exptiic'turos of the govern
ment, but counsels against reducing the
revenues so that there wbl be the possi
bility of a deficit. o
"But after providing against any
ter providing against any such
contingency .T.eans should be adopted
wnicn win nnrg tne revenues more nearly t
within tne limit ot our actual needs.
He urges'the necessity for strict economy
, cncnittll-oe VT,f that W rotlol
In expenditures, but that -"our rational
needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat
ter f "providing whatever Is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
"Infer-State Commerce.
He points to defects in the interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments .to correct them, in which connection
he says: - c
"Those who complain of the management
of the railways allege .that established
rates are not maintained, that re
bates and similar devices are habitually
resorted to, that these preferences are
usually in favor of the large shipper, that
they drive put of business the smaller
competitor, that while" many fates are too
low many others are excessive and that
gross preferences are made affecting both
locallties and commodities. Upon the oth-
er hand, the railways assert that- the law
by its every terms tends to produce many
of these Illegal practices by depriving car
riers of that right of concerted . action
which they claim is necessary to estab
lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates.
"The act shouldDe amended. The rail
wav is a public servant. Its rates should
be Just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government snouiu ee id
within its Jurisdiction this is
it that
so and
Should provide a speedy. Inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At'the same
time ft must not be torgotten tnat out
railways are the arterjes through which
the' commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows: Nothing could be more foolish than
ths enactment of legislation which would
unnecessarily interfere with the develop
ment and operation- of these commercial
agencies."
As-rlcnltnral Interests.
. The president cites the foresfleglslatlon
of the past' and the great good of fdrest
preserves' to the people, and says they will
Inevitably be of still greater value. Con
tinuing, he says: ' , '
"At present the protection of the forest
reserves rests with tne general land -office,
the mapping and description of their tim
ber with tbe United States geological sur
vey and the preparation of plans for theli
conservative U3e with the bureau of for
estry, which Is also charged with the gen
eral advancement of practical forestry in
the United States. These various func
tions should be united In the bureau of
forestry? to which they, properly beiorg.
The present diffusion of responsibility is
bad from every standpoint. It prevents
that effective cooperation between the
smvprnment 'and the men who utilize the
resources of- the reserves, without which
the interests of both rrrast suffer..,. Ths
tclentiflc bureaus generally should be put
ander the department of agriculture. The
president should have by law the power
of transferring- lands for use as forest re
serves to the department of agriculture.
He already has "such "power in the case of
lands needed by the departments of war
md the navy."
Irrigation.
Irrigation in connection with the waste
lands ot the west is a question to which
the president gives considerable attention,
xud mattes strong recommendations lor
government aisisuii.ee in reclaiming the
waste lands by agisting in their irriga
tion and the control oi water rights wher
ever that is possible, and ot this ne says:
"In the arid region it is water, not land,
which measures production. The western
halt of the United States wou.d sustain a
population greater than that ol our whole
country to-uay it the waters that now run
to waste were saved and used lor irriga
tion. The lorest and .water problems are
perhaps the most vital interna.! questions
ii the United States.
"In cases where natural conditions have
been restored tor a few years vegetation
has again carpeted the ground, birds and
dter are coming back, and hundreds of
persons, especially from the immediate
neighborhood, come eacn summer to enjoy
the privilege .of camping. Some at least
of the forest reserves- should afford per
petual protection to the native fauna and
Uora. safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
-fr.ir..rt!.i B,,m,.?r ,tn
Kir.cs ana tree cam Dinar errouncs for the
en who have learned to find rest, health
and recreation in the splendid forests, and
flower-clad meadows or our mniintair.s.
The forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our peo
ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted greed of a few."
"The, forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save the flood waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking , too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished by the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
interstate problems are Involved, and the
resources of single states would often be
ir.aacqua.te. It is properly a national
function, at least in some of its features.
It is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The.
storms' of th fionris in rpsprvoirs at the
! headwaters of our rivers is but an en
; largement Gf our present policy cf river
control under -which levees are bum on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it docs other
public works. Where their purpose Is to
regulate the Cow of streams the water
should be turned freely into- the channels
In the dry season to take the sanif course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of ,the
arid lands will enrioh every portion" of
our country, just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
perity to the Atlantic states. The in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia will consume the larger food sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chieny in upbuilair.g local centers-
of mining and other industries which
would otherwise not come into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful hdmemaklng is but another
name for the upoui.uirig or, the natiun."
He counsels' against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises. iiat we iet
experience on a smatf plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. He also
cites the conditions- under which the set
tlers of the west ere attempting- to bund
homes on- these arid lands, and says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
tLtles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered in ordinary suits- at
law. With a few .creditable exceptions,
the arid states "have failed to provide for
the certain ard just division of streams in
times of scarcity. Lax ar.d uncertain laws
have made it possible to establish rights
to water in excess oi actual uses or ne

i ssitie and many breams have already

coni-iraicTit tn nvrimhln.
"Whoever controls a stream practically !
controls the land it renders productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water ,
apart from land cannot prevail without!
causing enduring wrong. The recognition ,
of such ownership, wnicn nas Deen per-
mitted to grow up in the arid regions.
snould give way to a more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the pub
lic Jn the control and disposal of the pub
lic water supplies. Laws' founded upon
conditions -obtaining in humid regions,
where water is too abundant to Justify
hoarding it. have no proper application ln
a dry country. '
"In the arid s-tates the only right to water
which' should be recognized is that of use.
In irrigation this right should attach to
the land - reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom.
Granting perpetual water
lights to
other than users without
compensation to the public Is open to all
the objections wnicn apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the publll utili-
ties of the cities-. A few of the western
states have already recoe-nlzed this and
have Incorporated" In their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
of water."
The Colonies.
Considerable attention Is given the col
onies, and especially. the Philippines. This
section of the message begins . by citiner
i the needs. of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of large
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the islands should
be shaped .with this end in view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
afford the true test of the healthy deveW
opment of the islands, u ne iana policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled
; on our homestead system."
of Porto Rico he says the island Is thrivr

her material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends mucb
la the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far noi
with too great-haste. He says: "We hope

But the Idea of the president Is that we ir thorough andcwell-planned system
cannot . leave the islands at this time, ol lc1 -inirnn whn. th -
which he says: -to leave tne islands a i
tKi time would mean
m tnat tney wouic
fall lntd a welter of murderous anarchy.
Such a desertion or cuty on our pari
would be a crime agamst humanity."
But he believes sufficient progress: has
been' made along the lines under which we
have bees working in the islands to war
rant us ln passing new legislation, but In
this connection he urges, the need of cau
tion. He helieves the time has' come when
the Industries ot which the islands are.
capable should be encouraged by granting
franchii,. for their development, and of
this he says:
"Noining better can be done for the Is
lands than to Introduce Industrial enter-
irises. Nothing would benefit them to
nuch as throwing them open to industrial
ieveiopmenL "ice connection between
c'iene&s and mischief is proverbial, and the
jpport unity to do remunerative work is
n of the surest preventives of war. Of
ourse no business man will go into the
Philippines unless it is to his interest to
lo so. and it is 'immensely to the interest
f the islands that h& should go in. It is
.herefore necer-sary 'that the congress
ihouid pass laws by which th resources
if the islands can be developed, so that
Iranchlses (tor limited terms ot years) can
e granted to companies1 doing business in
iiem and every encouragement be given
:o the incoming a& business men of every
tind. o
"Hot to permit this Is to do a wrong to
.he Philippines. The franchises must be
rranted and the business permitted only
inder regulations which will guarantee the
stands against any kind of improper ex
ploitation. But the vast natural wealth
if the islands must be developed, and the
sapital willing to develop It must be given
:he opportunity. The field must be thrown
pen to individual enterprise, which has
een the real factor In the development o(
very "regipn over which our Hag has flown.
It is urgently necessary to enact suitable
.aws dealing with general transportation,
xtislng. banking, currency, homesteads and
:he use and ownership of the lanes and
dmber. These laws will give free play to
Industrial enterprise, and the commercial
ievelopment which will surely follow will
ifford to the people of the islands the
best proofs of the sincerity of our desire
to aid them." -
The construction of a Pacific cable Is
Uso urged, either" that-the government
i Ay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
ihe Philippines, or that an arrangement
j e made by which the advantages ac
: :ruing from a government cable may be
! secured to the government by contract
with a private cable company. This he
lee his necessary for both commercial.
political and military considerations.
The Isthmian Canal.
He calls attention to the need of an
thmian.canal. and savs:
"Its importance to the nation is by no !
Tieans limited merely rto its anaterial et- '
fects upon our business prosperity, and .
yet with a view to these effects alone it :
would be to the last degree important)
tor us Immediately to begin it. Wh:ls its ;
ienericial effects would perhaps be most
narked upon the Pacific coast and the ;
?uit and south Atlantic states, it would :
ilso greatly benefit other sections. It Is I
smphatlcally a work which It is for the
interest of the entire country .to begm
md complete as soon as possible: it is
arie oi those great works which only a
?reat-nation can undertake with pros
pects oi success and which when done
ire not only permanent assets in tfee na
tion's material interests,, but standing
monuments to Its constructive ability."
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with England he says: "I am giad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great Britain,
conducted on both sides in a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted in my being able to
lay before the senate a treaty which if
ratified' will enable us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian car.al at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has. ever asked in connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction ard maintenance of a necessarily
American sh'p car.al. is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United States
alone, shall do the work of building end
a?urne the responsibility of safeguarding
the canal ar.d'shall regulate Its neutralise
bv all nations cn terms of equality
without the guarantee or interference
f any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be Jald before the senate, and If ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give- effect -to the advantages it secures
us by providing for the building of the
canal."
The Jlonroe Doctrine.
The president rets forth the objects of
the Monroe -doctrine, and the spirit In
which It has hern received by other
countries, and is connection with it says
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire, any territory at the expense of
inv of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cnba as a guarantee of our
rood fa'th. He say3 also that "this

forming our international duties as well as
a protection and safeguard for our Inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a first-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy in
keeping with our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being In any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly-trained-
navy ls.the best guarantee against
war. the cheapest and most effective peace
Insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such -a navy represents the very
lightest premium for Insuring peace which
this nation can possibly pay."
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition cf more
officers and men as absolutely necessary,
and says:
"There should be no cessation ln the
work of- completing our navy. So far in
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It Is unsafe and unwl.es
not to provide this year for several addi
tional battleships and heavy armored
cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft

greater vigor. Every effort must be made
to exact the main "function of the officer
the command cf men. The leading grad
uates of the naval academy should, be as
signed to the combatant branches, the
line and marines."
The Army.
No Increase in. the regular army Is
deemed necessary at this time, but there:
are several changes in tnat Drancn or tne
government service which the president
recommends to copsgresa. Chief of these
la the establishment ot a staff department,
and of this he says:
"A general staff, should be created. . As
for the general itaff and supply depart
ments, they should be rUied oy details"
from the line, the men so cttaiied return
ing after awhile to their line duties. It is
very undesirable to have the senior grades
of the army composed of men who bars
come to nil the positions by the mere fact
of seniority. A system should be adopted,
by which there shall be an elimination
grade by grade of those who seem unfit
to render the best service in the next
grade. Justice to the veterans of .the
civil war who are still in the army would
seem to require hvit in the matter of re;
tirements they be given by iaw the samA
privileges accorded to their comrades in
the navy."
Another recommendation which the pres
ident makes in connection with the army
Is for the reduction of the "paper work"
of the service, known to the public as Ved .
tape." Of this, he says: ' .
"JJvery effort should be made to fcrlcs
the army to a constantly increasing sum
o efficiency. When cn actual service, no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. The paper
work In the army, as in the navy, should
be greatly reduced. - What is needed is
proved power ot command and capacity
to work well In the field. Csnstant care
is necessary to prevent dry rot in the
transportation and commissary depart
ments." He also urges the enactment of legis
lation in connection with the militia, and
national guard forces of the nation that
they may be better fitted for active serv
ice In time of war, and says:
"Our militia law Js obsolete and worth
less. The organization and armament of
the national guard of the several stales,
which are treated as militia in the ap
propriations by the congress, should be
made identical with thoe provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard In time of war shoutd
be caretully defined and, a svstem estab
lished by law under which the method of
procedure of raising volunteer forces
should be prescribed in advance. It is ut
terly Impossible in the excitement and
haste of impending war to do this satis
factorily If the arranzementa have -not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilizing in the flrat
volunteer organizations called out the
training of those citizens who have al
ready had experience under arms, and
especially for the selection In advance of
the officers of any force which may be
raised; for careful selection of the kind
necessary is impossible after the outbreaks
oi war.
He praises the veterans of the civil war.
the war with Spain and those who have
rendered the naUon valiant service in the
Indian uprisings of the west and in ths
Philippines, and counsels continued lib
erality in the nation's dealing with them.
The Civil Service.
He recommends the enactment of legis
lation that will place under the rulings
of the merit system many classes of em
ployes not now governed by it. His rec
ommendation for this is as follows:
"I recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service to
the District of Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend it.5
In toy judgment all laws providing, for
the temporary employment of clerks
should hereafter contain a provision that
they be selected under the civil service
law."
He also wishes the merit system to ob
tain In the government service In ths
colonies, and says:
"Not an office should be filled In ths
Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard
to the man's partisan affiliations or serv
ices, with any regard to the political, so
cial or personal influence which he may
have at his command. In- short, heed"
should be paid to absolutely nothing save
the man's own character and capacity
and the needs of the service.
"The administration of these Islands
should be as wholly free from the sus
picion of partisan politics as the admin
istration of the army and navy. All that
we ask from the public servant in the
Philippines or Porto Rico is that he re
flect' honor on his country by the way in
which he makes that country's rule a
benefit to the peoples who have come un
der it. This Is all that we should ask.
and we cannot afford to be content with
less."
Other Recommendations.
Among other recommendations which ths
president makes are those asking for leg-
lsiatio thjl. illn.nm th-
loe al Iines oulned lnbIUs u
at previous sessions, and he cava ihn-
"It is true that the service is now la the
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth In the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on this
subject are enacted Into law."
He believes the time has arrived when
the Indian should cease to be treated as a
member of a tribe, but as an individual,
and recommends breaking up the tribal
funds, putting a stop to the Indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot-
recommends also the establishment of an
industrial educational system, end an en
deavor to encourage the Indians to become
cattle raisers rather than agriculturists
where their lands are ur.suited to life latter.
He recommends liberal appropriations for"
the Louisiana Purchase exposition and an
appropriation covering expenses incurred
Dy tne cnarieston exposition in removrng
government exhibits from the Buffalo ex
position to that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations Is for
a permanent census bureau, as it would In
sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory
work in the interest of business, statistics,
economic and social science.
The Postal Service.
He calls attention to tbe growth of ths
postal system end to the fact that the an
nual deficit ln this department of the gov
ernment service has been reduced to the
small sum of 13,923,727. This, he says, could
luriner ue mcreaseu aim possioiy a surplus
shown but for the fact that many publi
cations are now securing the pound, rate
as second-class mall matter which are Cot
entitled to the same under the law. Of
this he says: .
"The full measure of postal progress
which might be realized has long been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden imposed on the government
through the Intrenched' and well-understood
abuses which have grown in con
nection with second-class mail matter.
The extent of this burden appears when lt
Is stated that, while the second-class mat
ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight
of all the mail, it paid for the last, fiscal
year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal
revenue of J111.C31.I93. If the pound rats
of postage, which produces the large loss
thus entailed and which was fixed -by ths
congress with the purpose of encouraging
tbe dissemination of public information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no Just exception could he taken.
That expense would be the recognized and
accepted cost of a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted, for a justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys ths
privileged rate is wholly outside of ths
intent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evssion of its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of:such wrongly included
matter is estimated by postal experts to
be one-half of the whole volume of second
class mail. If ft be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of- the burden is
apparent. The post office detriment has
now undertaken to remove the abuses so
far as possible by a stricter application
of the law, and it should be sustained la
its effort." .
The Chinese Difficulties.
He calls attention to the satisfactory
settlement of the Chinese difficulties of
last year, and this nation's part in ths
settlement, and says provisions .bars
been made for insuring the future safety
of the foreign representatives. Of ths
promises made by China he says:
"The Chinese government has agreed ts
participate financially in the work of bet
tering the water approaches to Shanghai
and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade in central and northern China, and
an international conservancy board; In
which the Chinese government is largely
represented, has been provided for ths
Improvement tf the Shanghai river and
the control of its navigation. In the sains
line of commercial advantages a revision
of the present tariff on Imports has been
assented to for the purpose ot substitut
ing specific for ad valorem duties, and as
expert has been sent abroad on the part
of the United States to ass'st in thl
work. A list of articles to remain free of
duty. Including flour, cereals and rice,
gold and silver coin and bullion, has alss
been agreed upon ln the settlement..
In conclusion, he mentions ths Pan
American congress, now in session at ths
City of Mexico, sr.d refers to the death ef
Queen Victoria ar.6 the dowager empress
of Germany, which aroused the genuine
sympathy of the people of this country,
which sympathy was fully reciprocated
by the people of both these nations upon
ths assassination of President McKlnley.
