j are expected to arrive tonight The
1 President of theCongiess, Major 'I. H.
| Hudson, of i.ainar. Miss., opened the
I congress with an address of softie 1 ngth
etting forth the demands and wants of
' agriculturists, especially the appoint
ment of a commissioner of agriculture
as a ruemtier of the President's cabinet.
Such an officer, hesai I, could watoh our
foreign relations in respect to this inter
est, which must ever lie greatest: and he
would be enabled to secure to farmers"
latxirs a Imtter result. There is not a
farmer in all this country who under
stands farming as he should, and how
ignorant must be the Cabinet and na
tional oouuclls who have never stuiied
it. Ihe prosperity of the country de
pends on the progress of agriculture.
Such being the stttei'f affairs, a'l de
liberations of national b>dies should
tend towards us salvation. I uis can
not l»e secured until f irmers are brought
into a body. I<et il* therefore teach tho
farmers the r own interest and raise a
crv that will reach the Federal Govern
melit at Washington. We are in sad
need wf scientific knowledge of farming.
Such means should be sweured as would
put this knowledge int*> easy possession
of the tillers of the soil, lie said that
there should be arranged t statement
showing the cause of the prosperity
of various products in various quarters:
thus the farmer would know what land
was best adipted to the piod ictiou of
such crops as he desired. He wocld
his owu povert as compared
with the wealth of bis neighbor. One
Stite would watch another, and the best
interests would be en Lanced by the
nv dry incited by th> se reports, which
would be made monthly. The good re
sults of such a system regarding cotton
showed the gre.tt advantage of such a
proceeding. At the conclusion of the
president's address, and when commit
tees had been appointed for the virions
duties, the congress adjourned. It will
probably be in session three days.

PABIS, Dec. s. —Marquis Tseng com
ments on the statement m ide
berry in the Chnnibfr of Deputies uu
the .list of October, that the French
Government did not believe China
would declare w tr, nor had France any
intention of doing so; that France was
desirous of tiruily est iblUhing herself
in the lt -d river delta by y wuing pos
ses-ion of Sontay and H icmnh, .ndthat
when that was achieved nobody would
be nble to drive her out: that, with
patience, sangfroid and her fi»roes, she
would be proof against everything, and
that a prudent policy would lead to ttie
settlement of the i'onquiu affair. I'he
M irqilirt observes thai this statement
produced a painful impression m l'on
qtiin. If it became a question of pos
session of I'onquiu, furtUer negotiu
tlou would be unless, as it will be im
possible for China to agree thereto. <hi
November :suth Ferry declared that tlie
French Government had not changed
in the last three years the policy guided
by tUe principles which formed the
basis of the treaty of 1H74. The Gov
ernment desired a consolidation of the

the Song Koi river aud security for iu
commercial relations in 'i'ouqum.

oaiupments at Hanoi and at Sontay and
on the bank of the lied river. Ferry
pointed out that Marquis Tseng de
clared ou the Ist of August that there
were 110 Chinese troops 111 Touquiu :
wheruupon ChalUm.l Leooar, the
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, re
plied that there was consequently 110
danger of a conflict. If the Chinese
forces occupied tUe fortress against
which the trench were advancing they
would run the risk of being considered
Annamite auxiliaries. Since then the
situatiou has remained unchanged by
otir own act, and our plan of coiipaigu
has not been mod 1 tied and c tnnot l»e
modified, und the responsibility for a
conflict will not rest witti 11s.

upon Canada and its resources. He
particularly praised the sambrity of the
climate, and said that the fevers which
were too common in the I'm ted States
were unknown within the boundaries of
the Dominion. He lauded Canada as a
held for emigration, and expatiated up
on the marvellous progress 111 vie by the
various towns. Lird Lorue concluded
by HftyuiK that the Canadian iieople are
thoroughly devoted to their connection
with the mother country, otherwise
they w uld long ago have discarded
their alle.ii mee, of which they are
proud. With the Dominion of Canada
aud the Australian colonies 111 close re

At the meeting of the passenger and
ticket agents of tliu dilTeretit roads

tion. held at the Grand Pacific, Chioayo,
the following; were present: (i. K.
Barnes, general agent of the Sortbern

and ticket agent of thu Atc.i-ou, lopeka
and Santa Fe. and P. S. Fastis, general
ticket agent of the Burliugton and Mis
souri liiver. The first question dis
cussed was that of arranging basing
|K>ititß and rates fr..ui Missouri river
terminal points, including St. Paul,
Chicago and St. Ijouis. After consid
erable discussion and the compromise
of numerous conflicting interests,
the following uniform rate from
Chicago aud St. Louts to Portland and
San Francisco was finally settled upon :
First class $ lIKS .7), second d iss f*3 f>o,
third class f .rl 60; Portland rates to ap
ply bv way of the Northern Pacific, and
San Francisco rates only by the Central
and Union PacifioA* | d by ilie Southern
lines. Kates frotu Kansas City aud
< Imaha to San Francisco werw fixed at
#7f» and s4."> respectively for first,
second and third classes. These same
rates are to apply fro"i St. Paul to Port
land, and the rates from St. Paul to Sau
Francisco are to be made by adding to
the rate from St. Paul to Portland the
local rate from Omaha to St. Paul,
while the Portland rate from Omaha
and Kansas City is to be made by adding
to the rates from those points to San
Francisco the local rate from St. Paul to
Omaha. Points east afid southeast
from Chicago and St. Louis will use
Chicago and St. Louis as s»asis points
for making rates to San Francisco and
Portland.
After the regular rates had been set
tled.the following rates on special class
es were agreed to; Theatrical rates, one
way, between eastern and western ter
minal points, for parties of five or more,
and for every increase of tlve in
the party the rates will be reduced s.">
eaoh, with $ 100 as the minimnm figure.
Theatrical parties going over one route
aud returning over another, will be
charged additional for each mem
ber. An allowance of "JOO pounds of
baggage is granted each member. No
further redaction will Is-made to ad
vance agents, but thev will be allowed
to carry 400 pounds of baggage.
For clergymen, missionaries and their
wives, a special rate of between

was adopted, and for correspondent
and editors of import ult papers, a
special rate of S7O.
Military rates for all commissioned
oflioers traveling on leave of absence

their wives and nnuiarried children
under IS and one servant.
Commercial rates lietween (hnaha
and Kans«s City to San Francisco were
fixed at sl>o for the round trip, and l>e
t*een Portland and St. Paul at #l7O.
General Ticket Agent Barnes of the
Northern Pacific mad« a vigorous fight j
to have the •omuiercial rate between St.
Panl and Portland fixed at SIOO, but
falling to m ike his point, had to be
content with the #l7O rate, which is a
concession of #lO in favor of the North
ern Pacific and commercial tnvelers
over its line. Charity rates for all well
authenticated and d«*e»viug cases were
fixed at en»-half the regular nnd
the rate for corpses of one fall aulimi
ted ticket. The rat* to worthy railruid
employees, who present s»tisfjctory let
ters from their sui>erior officers, was
fixed at #.Y) between eastern and west

return by another. Tnese rates are to
cover tourist business only. No passes
will be issued ou acc tunt of theatrical
parties, ar.d the above rules wiil . • avail
ab'e only oa application to tue proper
officers of the various lines.
The meeting also fixes excess b iggage
charges between evsteru aud western
terminals at 15 per cent of first cUss
rates. 1 h*t is. the charges on 1-VJ
