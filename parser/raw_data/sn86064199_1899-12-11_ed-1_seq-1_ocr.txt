OPENSTflE
Great Debate And 'Recounts
The History Of Previous
Legislation On The
Subject.
Washington, Dec. 11. There was
a eparee attendance in the galleries of
the house wbea the Bpeiker's gavel
fell at noon. The number of members
on the floor was. however, large, In
anticipation of the opening of the
week's deba.e on the currency bill.
Mr. Hepburn, of Iowa, was made chair
man to preside over the house during
the debate.
Mr. Overstreel, of Indiana, took the
floor to make the opening speech on
the bill. After declaring that the
gold standard had been recognized in
this country for more than ba'f a cen
tury he pointed out the necessity of
having a law on the statute books de
finitely announcing the gold dollar
to be our standard of value rather
than to leave it to the dis
cretion of any man, whether
president or not, to change the stand
ard. He recounted the history of pre
vious legislation on the subject and said
the purpose of the present bill was to
dispel all lingering doubt that the
money of the United is as good as that
of any nation of the world.
Mr. Maddox, of Georgia, followed.
He pretested against the haste with
which this bill was .being pressed
through under fag law and inquired
whether it was due to ex-Speaker
Reed's suggestion, after the Ohio
election, tbat if the republicans desired
toHwrite "gold" Into the statutes
they hai better go about it right away.
The bill would, Maddox said, be more
injurious to the people of this country
then any measure presented to oon
trrfiss In half . a century. It was
demanded by Wall Etreet, but the peo
ple were not consulted. Under its
provisions in five years every dollar in
silver would be confiscated and practi
cally eent to a junkshop.

" FOX HUNTERS.
The Texas Association to Meet To
day at Blanchard.
Special Correspondence of the Herald.
Blanchard, Tex., Dec. 11. A half
hundred lovers of the chase assembled
here today to take part in the annual
meet of the Texas Fox Hunters' asso

country is sufficiently broken to lend
zest to the sport, and yet it can be easily
traversed on horseback.
The Victory Of The Boers
Encourages The
Bears.
The AttitudeOf President Mc
Kinley On Trusts Also
Had Its Effect On
Industrials.
New York. Dec. 11. The stock
market this morning was wild and
excited and liquidation was enormous,
Sharp losses in some of the leading
stocks at the opening were precipitat
ed by news of a British defeat by the
Boers yesterday and this was taften
advantage of by bears to hammer
everything in sight.
Feeling that President McKlnley's
utterances in regard to trusts would
probably be productive of some legis
tion in congress affecting the present
status of such combination'1 also had
its effects, chiefly on industrial.
After first heavy drop in prices tbere
were a few sharp ral'sss, but few of
these stocks returned to their opening
price?.
The heaviest declines were in Amer
ican Sugar and Tennessee ooal and
iron which dropped respectively from
139 and 104 on Saturday to 133 and
1004.
American Tobacco and Colorado fuel
were also down from 4 to 7 points,
while members of other stocks, chiefly
industrials, shewed considerable de
clined important if true.
New York, Dec. 11. A prlvat9
Washington dispatch received by a
prominent Wall street man this 'morn
ine states that Kruger sent a cable
gram to this government Saturday
asking if it would act as arbitrator be
tween the Boers and England. The
officials, it is alleged, had a conference
with the British minister about the
matter.

the Organization And Two AI
dermanlc Members.
Rome, Dec. 11. Two aldermen of
Palermo are under arrest today charged
with being members of the Mafia, and
additional details of the capture of
Palizzolo, the alleged leader of the
of the organization, tare leaking out.
The information which led to
the capture was furnished by a
special detective from Naples. His
suggestion caused the interception of
all Pallzzolo's mail and telegrams
and when the time came for the serv
ing of the warrant Palizzolo had ab
solutely no chanoe of escape. He sat
down and cried when he found his
house surrounded by officers. Mafia
leaders celebrated several assassina
tions by banquets at Pallzzolo's house.

GATACRE
And Forced To Retreat Be
fore The Boers While
Atacking Storm
borg. MOLTENO, Dec. 10 (Delayed in
transmission) General Gatacre was
completely surprised by the Boers at
Stormborg today, but his column did
not falter under fire. The Royal Irish
rifles and the Northumberland
Puslleers charged the Kopje where the
Boers were located and reached tbe
top. They found Boers on three
sides, however, and were forced down
the hill. The British artillery then
monopolized action until it was seen to
be hopaless, when retreat was ordered.
One shell landed in a group of fifteen
horses, blowing them to atoms.
UNDER-ESTIMATING THE BOER FORCES
London, Deo. 11. The reverse
suffered by General Gatacre at Storm
borg is regarded as another case of
under-estimation of the enemy's forces
and ability which has already cost the
British so much. The many long
forced marches by which Gatacre
reached Stormborg is characteristic of
this commander, whom Ills men call
"Backacher." This Bort of marching
against Indian and Egyptian troops
was usually crowned with 6harp and
brilliant successes, but in the cage of
fighting the Boers, it Is differed.
Gataore's troops were not only sur
prised but were evidently too fatigued
to withstand the terrific fire which
poured over them.
:MAY LOSE PART OP THE EMPIRE.
The military expert of the Morning
Post who has followed the Boer war
critically and dispassionately, warns
England of the darrger of losing part of
the empire through the parsimony
which is displayed in the inefficient
forces with which she attacks the
Boer?. This warning is the first hint
in any British paper of even a proba
bility of final defeat for England in
South Africa.
JOUBERT INJURED AGAIN.
London, Dec. 11. A message from
Durban says that Joubert is 60 badly
injured that he will not be able to
again take the field. The Boer gen
eral, it is said, was severely wounded
in the thigh and his horse was shot
from under him, the falling from his
mount resulting .in a bad injury to
his spine.
, THE CASUALTIES.
London, Dac. 11. Gen. Walker says
tbat Gatacre'a casualty list is not com
plete and in view of the Boers' heavy
fire tbe list will doubtless place the
fatalities at a much higher figure. The
known casualties are as follows:
Rival Irish rifles, six wounded.
Suffolk, one officer and ten men
wounded; missing, three officers and
290 men.
Seventy-fourth field battery, one
officer and five men wounded.
Seventy-fifih field battery, oneoffioer
killed and one man wounded.
Northumberland fusileers, six offi
cers and 306 men missing.
BOERS STRONGLY ENTRENCHED.
Modder River station, Dec. 10.
The Boers ae strongly entrenched on
two ranges of hill?, north of Modder
river, and have also lateral shelter
trenches for convenience of retreating.
Part of the Canadian contingent has
arrived and a majority of these have
been set to work relaying railroad
tracks. .

Another Issue To Overshad
ow It In The 1900
Campaign,
CONTROL OF CURRENCY
Statement Of Col. Thomas B.
Love, The Texas Represen
tative Of The De
mocracy. "President McKinley's message has
been the specific cause of tbe raising
cf another issue in the campaign. He
has given prominence to ths only issue
which can and will overshadow the
free silver destlon."
This statement was male last night
at the Pierson by Col. Thomas B.
Love, of Dallas, who, as the authorized
agent for Texas of tbe ways and means
committee of ths democratic national
committee, has full charge of the
preliminary campaign work and of the
campaign funds in tbe state, afud who
therefore speaks as one having author
ity. As a representative of tha national
committee, he voices tbe political sen
timents of those men 'who will have in
charge' tbe democratic campaign of
1900. His statement shows that free
silver. as an issue will have a minor
importance in demooratio doctrines of
1900.
(The matter in question, "continued
Col. Love, "is th9 president's evident
intention to farm out the control of the
circulating medium of this oountry to
national banks of the government and
tha people.
"This is going to be tbe great finan
cial issue of the coming campaign to
which even the free eilver doctrine will
be subordinate. Tbe democrats will
simply attempt to keep the control of
tbe circulating medium of the country
in ths bands of the people."
"Then, Col. Love, you think the
national bank question will be tbe
paramount issue of the oming cam
paign?" ' -
. "The paramount financial issue only,
superseding the free Bilver question.
Two other prominent questions wiil
over 6hadow this . one. We
will fight the trusts. That
will be democracy's' strongest plank.
And we are also goin j ti make a big
fight against expansion. These are
the two issues of greatast importance.
After them comes this important
question of the control of the circula
ting medium, and it will be tbe real
financial issue of tbe campaign." v

El Paso To Be Adequately
Supplied Within Ninety
Days.
IMPORTANT CONTRACT
Made With The El Paso Mine,
Mill And Smelter Sup
ply House By The In
ternational Co-
El Paso is to be properly lighted. It
is also to be supplied with power.
This within ninety days. It ia almost
certain to have an electric etreet rail
way beforo the end of 1900. These'
statements are the most important for
the growth and development of El
Paeo tbat have been made for months.
On Saturday night the International
Light & Power company, of El Paso,
contracted with the El Paso Mine,
Mill & Smelter supply house, the local
branch houee of the Compania Indus
trial Mexicana of Chihuahua, to put in
at once in El Paso an electric light and
power plant. The plant ia to cost $50,
000." IV will have a capacity of 330
horse power at first, which will ba in
creased as the need, demanls. The
plant is to be. situated at the corcer
of Santi Fe and Fourth streets. Work
oq It ia to be begun this week. ' ,
Negotiations have been pending for
some time between the International
Light and Power company and the
Companialndustrial Mexloana.th rough
Its El Paso branch, upon this contract.
These negotlatiations were carried on
for the Compania Industrial Mexicana
by B. L. Berkey, the companv's repre
sentative in this city. JuauA.' Creel,
representing the Compania Industrial
Mexcana, arrived here last week to
closa tbe contract.
A meetingof President Dieter.Direc
tors Courchesne, Krakauer, Martinez,
and MoCutcheon of the International
company, and Mr. Creel of the Mexican,
company, was held Saturday night and
the contract was signed. By its term
Mr. Creel is to advance the El Paso com
pany $25,000. Tbe remaining 825,000 ne
cessary for tbe construction of the
plant has already been raised by the
stockholders of the 1 Paso company.
Mr. Creel telegraphed orders Satur
day nighty for the. machinery and equip
ment for the plant. He said this morn
ing that it should be here within six
weeks aid that it. will not take more
than two weeks time from the time It
is received to have it installed and in
operation.
The contract for tbe buildings for the
power plant, whioh are to be of brick,
will be let tomorrow or Wedneeday and
the work upon them will be rushed.
Tbe structure for the plant Is to cost
84,000 to 85,000.
The new company is to supply power
aa well as ligbts,as stated above. This
will bo of great benefit to small manu
facturing conoerns and others needing
a email amount of power. Sufficient
power can be supplied by the plant for
the needs of the entire city.
The International company is to sup
ply Juarez as well as El Paso with light
and power, Mr. Courchesne and Mr.
Martinez several months ago secured a
franchise for lighting, Juarez and eup"
plying power. This franchise has been,
turned over to tbe International com
pany, which will extend Its wires across
the river, giving Juarez her first elec
tric lights. The company expects to
do a large business in Juarez, perhaps
30 per cent of its total business. It al
ready has contracts from the city of
Juarez for twenty-five are lights.
The putting in of an electric car line
by the International company is pre
sumably merely a matter of time. One
of the directors said tbia morning tbat
the car line would be put In at once if
the company were able to secure tbe
present mule car line running between
El Paso and Juarez. Most of the etreet
car traffic would, of course, be between
(he two cities. It would be useless for
the International company to attempt
to establish a rival line to the mule
line. According to the Mexican fran
chise, which tie present streetcar-company
holds,a new company could net lay
tracks on tbe same streets it uses in
Juarez. The present company realizes
the grip it bas upon tbe situation and
is not willing to sell for anything litre
