Pfoblem. '
Word came to the headquarters of
The Bee's Free Shoe Fund the other
day of a desperately poor family.
One of the school nurses was sent
to Investigate.
She found a little woman, thin
and weak, bending over a wash tub
in a miserable tumble-down house
of three rooms.' Three little chil
drenged 2, 5 anq 7 years, literally
in rags, were lying in a ragged bed.
The day was cold. The house
was cold. Never was a more hope
less picture of desperate poverty.
And the little woman struggling
hravely against these awful odds.
The father of the family died nearly
a year as:o. -
, ' Warm Shoes Bought.
The Bee's fund was drawn off at
once. Warm shoes were bought for
the three children. The clothes
they had were pieced out and patch
ed up. And today the two oldest,
a boy and girl are in school. And
very bright and happy youngsters
thev are.
The little mother has secured a
position as charwoman and with the
help that The Bee's fund has given
her and her regular income now
from her work in an office building,
the winter does not look so terrify
ing. " Dozens of cases like this are in
Omaha awaiting relief; that can
come.onlv' through charity. The
Bee's fund is the only means pro
vided for buying shoes for poor
children of deserving families, in
nearly every instance the mother is
striving against odds to keep the
family going, with the courage that
is characteristic of inothers.
Help is Needed.

Electric
Cummins Concludes
Detailed Explanation
Of His Railroad BiH
Washington, Dec. 4. After speak
ing three days, Senator Cummins,
chairman of the interstate commerce
committee, concluded a detailed ex
planation of his railroad bill, de
signed to meet condition with the
return of the roads to private own
ership and control. ,
Discussing" the anti-strike provi
sion ol, the measure as proposed by
the committee, Senator- Cummins de
dared "there had been an industri
ous effort to misrepresent the bill."
He denied that it interfered in any
way with railway employes or offi
cials who desired to quit work.
Emphasizing that he was not op
posed to labor organizations, Sen
ator Cummins said the committee in
inserting the anti-strike section felt
that "the civilization of America
cannot continue or endure unless
organized society can find some plan
to preserve industrial peace and or
der." .
President Wilson's message to
congress Tuesday, he declared, was
a direct endorsement of the pro
posed legislation.
Much sentiment developed in fa
vor of curtailing general debate so
as to hasten the bill, but senate lead
ers said no plan of procedure had
been determined.
