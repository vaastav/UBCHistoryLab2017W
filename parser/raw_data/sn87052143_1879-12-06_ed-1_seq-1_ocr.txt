the Narrow Gauge. It will be remem
bered that it was reported several weeks
ago that the Burlington & Southwestern
had been negotiating tor the Narrow
Gauge, but bad not been able to agree
with the owners upon the price. The
report was in the main correct. The
Burlington & Southwestern wanted the
Narrow Gauge, and tried to buy it, but
did not succeed, and now tbU property
has fallen into the hands of Gould. The
negotiations were closed a lew days
ago, Gould buying enough of the stuck
to give him a controlling interest. A
meeting ot tue stockholders will be nelil
in this city next Wednesday, at which
Mr. Gould is expected to be present in
person. Ihe company will be reor
ganized.
The Narrow Gauge is 43 miles long.
the eastern terminus being at Lexington,
antl cost, including equipment. $'480,-
000. The amount paid lor a controlling
interest is not known, but it is under
stood that the property sold well. The
Narrow Gauge is doing a good business
all along the line, and is the principal
outlet for an inexhaustible supply oi
coal at Lexington and in that vicinity
It is suggested that Mr. Gould bought
the road lo keep it from falling into the
hands ot the liurlington & Southwestern
or any other company. However that
may be it will p:iy him to operate it in
connection with the Missouri Pacific, a
branch of which also runs to Lexington
Irom Sedaiia. As a coal road, it can be
made a valuable addition lo that part ol
(he Gould railway system which centers
here.
l tie journal nas it irom tne best au
thority that Gould is about completing
an arrangement f r running Missouri
racihc trains Irom Atchison to at. Jos
eph over the track ol the Hannibal &
St. Josi-ph. This amounts to a virtual
extension ot the Missouri Pacific Irom
Atchison to St. Joseph

mentioned, though all understand that

Wathena and Atchison. Ju-t what he
is going to do with it does not yet appear
When Mr. Mitcnell, president ot th
Kansas City extension ol the Chicago &
Alton, was here a lew days ago, he gave
the report that Gould had bought an in
terest in the Chicago & Alton a broad
denial. He said Gould had not bought
any C. & A. slock, and that there was
no prospect of his getting control of that
line. Yesterday, however, a gentleman,
who makes it a point to keep posted iu
railroad matters, told the Journal that
he had reliable intormation that Gould
bas obtained control ol a large block ol
C. & A. stock, agreeing to pay earn
ings to the amount ol eight per cent.,
and that there shall be no change in the
organization of the company.
A Journal reporter was talking to a

Tito geft i thorny iiitico uciween niary

will form an important direct through
line to be operated a the St. Joseph &
Denver. Waterville, on tne Uentral

h oovernment paid subsidy for the
construction ot these roads, and in the
formation of this new line avoiding the
subsidized portions of both these roads
they avoid paying the government a
percentage on the business done.
It is positively known that an agent
ol tbe Gould interest has purchased the
old road bed and right ol way between
Wathena and Atchison for the purpose
of extending the Missouri Pacific to this
city. The grading is to be prepared,
ami the track laid as soon as possible.
Thus St. Joseph is to be the terminus ol
the Missouri Pacific.
