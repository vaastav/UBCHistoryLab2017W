PLATTS POSITION.
When Senator Thomas C. Piatt was
asked, in the New York insurance in
vestigation, concerning political con
tributions that he had received from
the big insurance companies, he ac
knowledged that he had received an
nually from two of them something
like $10,000 each, and a less sum from
a third. These contributions have been
made every year, he said, for the past
fifteen years, and in emergencies he
could call for more.
In return for these contributions he
was expected to head off any legisla
tion at Albany inimical to the insur
ance companies. This was understood.
The insurance companies were to have
just about what they wanted from the
X'ew York legislature and they have
always got it until the present investi
gation was inaugurated.
Here is what President Roosevelt
says about political contributions from
corporations:
"If they are extorted by any kind of
pressure or promise, express or im
plied, direct or indirect, in the way of
favor or immunity, then the giving or
receiving becomes not only improper
but criminal."
According to Senator Piatt's own
statement in return for the contribu
tions the big insurance companies were
to have their own way in legislation
at Albany. Whether this was express
or implied he did not say, but either
way, according to President Roosevelt,'
it -a criminal.
That is the position in which the
senior senator from Xew York is
Placed by the president's message.
THE KANSAS NEWSPAPER.
There is a movement throughout
Kansas at present to raise the standard
of the weekly press. The country paper
today is printing more local news and
getting it up in better shape than ever
before. Recently the Troy Chief and
the Brown County World have invested
in typesetting machines, which have
heretofore been confined to daily news
papers. Now the Council Grove Guard has
joined the advance movement. It has
made numerous improvements and ex
penditures for the benefit of its sub
scribers, and in summing up it says:
"In other words, this paper has start
ed out to the The Superior County Pa
per. The first day of January, 1906, this
paper is going to be $1.50 a year. There
are too many cheap papers. It is time
some paper in t lie county started out
to rill tho field of being the one county
paper. The county deserves it. Popu
lation, wealth, business, the demands
of progress from year to year call for
a better paper than the county has yet
had. The Guard will try to answer that
call. We have had more requests for
it in the past three months and more
good advice and encouragement for this
move than ever before and it is our main
reason for doing it. We can not be
accused of taking advantage of anybody
or anything in this move. There are
still left in the county, six papers that
may be had for one dollar each. But
the Guard will be worth $1.50 figured
by the others and worth $3 figured by
some of them. It does not pay us to
run a dollar paper. We can do it, but
we prefer to run a better, not a poorer
paper. The Kansas country weeklies
that come to our office from week to
week costing the readers $1.50 a year are
the best papers in Kansas and they are
more than satisfying their readers. Peo
ple have tried the experiment of the
cheap paper and the request for a better
paper rather than a cheap one is now
the rule."
The Guard has the right idea. A few
years ago when times were hard a great
many country papers reduced their sub
scription price to one dollar a year, but
now the people of Kansas have grown
well-to-do and they are demanding the
best there is for their brains as well as
for their bodies. They must have good
reading matter as well as good things
to eat and good clothes to wear. Of
course the best costs more money than
the poorest, but the progressive Kansas
man is willing to pay the price. That is
why there i3 a demand for better week
ly papers, and why the progressive
country editors are supplying the de
ma nsi.
The fame thing is true in the daily
newspaper iield. People are anxious for
the best that is tc be had in the way
of dailies, and progressive thinking peo
ple are willing to pay for it. The State
Journal is meeting this demand in the
daily field in Kansas, as its readers well
know. In the past year it has made
a large number of improvements to
give the people of Kansas the best that
can be made in the way of a daily news
paper, and it believes Kansas people
will appreciate it.
In other words, this paper has started
out to be The Superior State Paper.
There are too many "cheap" papers.
It .w as time some paper in Kansas start
ed out to fill the field of the one Kan
sas paper. The state deserves it. Popu
lation, wealth, business, the demands
of progress from year to year, all call
for a better paper than the state has
yet held. The State Journal will try to
answer that call.
THE LIBERTY OP THE DRAMA.
An eastern playright. with neither
the fear of a multimillionaire nor re
spect for a forcible woman writer in
his heart, has dramatized John D.
Rockefeller and Miss Ida M. Tarbell.
He has taken the extreme liberty of
making Miss Tarbell and the junior
Rockefeller fail in love with -one an
other, but in order to do so it is neces
sary for him to bring in alt sorts of
impossibilities far from the facts in
the case.
This is how it happened, according
to the playright: Miss Tarbell's
father was not an oil producer, ac
cording to the play, but a federal
judge who made decisions inimical to
Standard Oil. This is a departure
from the facts Xo. 1, for can you
imagine the average federal judge in
years gone by deciding against the
Standard ?
For these decisions Rockefeller or
ders Judge Tirbeli's impeachment by
the United States senate on a false
charge of corruption. Miss Tarbell
has x-ritten, under an assumed name.
a Standard Oil novel with John D. as
j the heavy villain, and it so pleases
him that he employs her to write his
personal history, not knowing she is
the daughter of his enemy.
At some previous stage of the game
the playright has conveniently had
Miss Tarbell and John D. Rockefeller,
jr., meet on a ship returning from
Europe. The heir of the house of
Standard Oil falls in love with the
fair authoress, w oos and finally wins
her. But the head of the Rockefeller
household bitterly opposes the match,
and it is at this interesting point that
the authoress enters his household.
She tells him a few truths, quotes
some passages from "The History of
the Standard Oil Company" for his
benefit, and thus gets him to call off
the senate from impeaching her father
and also to consent to the marriage
and they live happy ever afterwards.
These are some of the liberties
which the drama has taken with the
houses of Rockefeller and Tarbell. It
reminds one in a way of the little dif
ficulties that once took place between
the families of Messrs. Montague and
Capulet. as recorded by the late Mr.
Shakespeare, but happily it has not
the. tragic ending of that row.
Sometimes people of a certain class
complain of the liberty of the press.
What do they think of the liberty of
the drama when it makes sport with
facts and families in this free man

Where hunters wildly bang away.
Though many risks they're running.
The same mistakes are being made.
Displaying lack of reason.
As those that have been causing grief

'Tis bad enough when horses, cows.
And mules and pigs are stopping
The leaden pellets from the guns,
And in their tracks are dropping;
But worse, by far, is blundering
That brings about tho aiming
At human targets in the woods.
And ruthlessly is maiming.
A bunch of whiskers on a chin

"A squirrel!" he exclaims, ind fires,
And there's a face shot-dotted.
Some fellow's hat protrudes above
The brush where he is walking;

And there's result that's shocking.
Some unsuspecting passer-by
Is leg or arm displaying.
And as a rabbit he's assailed
By some one bent on alayin-f.
Another who's concealed from view.
By chance soma twigs is breaking.
And then he's sized up as big game,
And sets a fearful raking.
Of course, there are a lot of sports
Who never make a blunder.
And who display a hunting skill
That oft excites our wonder;
But there are many others whom
'Tis wisdom to be shunning.
And they're the chaps who make us think
That many fools go gunning.

A Sculptor's Fable.
Mr. Frederick MacMonnies, the
sculptor, says the World's Work for
December, wrote some fables early in
his student days in Paris that have
never before been published. One of
them is to this effect:
"Once upon a time there were two
little boys, one of them good and the
other bad. The bad little boy used to
go off to the woods every Sunday to
play with the other children in the
fresh air and sunshine. But the good
little boy was obedient and stayed at
home every Sunday, as he was bid,
and learned a verse from the Bible to
repeat in Sabbath school. He often
envied the bad little boy the good
times he had on Sunday, running and
playing and laughing with the other
children and flying his kite in the
open air in the face of providence. But
he comforted himself with the thought
that that was wrong, and that he was
doing right in learning the verses, and
that one day he would be rewarded.
So he learned a verse every Sunday,
until he had memorized 437 of them.
Then, one Sunday, he was called up
before all the other pupils irt the Sab
bath school, and the teacher praised
his persevan.ee and told the others
how hard he had worked, and then,
when he had finished talking, he gave
the good little boy a card covered with
sparkling bits of glass and fringed
with gilt tassels, and on the card was
printed, 'Feed my lambs.' It was the
reward of virtue."

rustic charm. They make a strong ap

the hunter and naturalist is still
greater, for this is one of the most
famous ranges of the huge hairy ele
phants, once so widely dispersed in
temperate North America, Here they
were to be seen in long lines and
numerous herds, wending their way
from the breezy uplands where they
rested in the shade, to the richer bot
tom lands where their favorite food
abounded, and even now as we pass
we may be certain that within a few
miles of the train are scores, maybe
thousands, of these monsters still ly
ing in the shade, but -it is the shade
of their tombs. From "Elephant

little laugh.
"It ought to be better than that." he
declared. "This investigation will at
tract attention ail over the country. It
might even be good for the governor
ship." "But you won't get the senatorship
this election, will you?" persisted the
girl. Candless shook his head.
"We are onlv fairly getting under
way," he explained patiently. "I sus
pect the committee will sit after Christ- !
mas."
"But I thought you were the whole
investigation," she persisted. "What
has the committee to do? Can't you
hurry it up?"
"I am only one of a committee of
five," he said. "I am doing most of the
work, but these things cannot be hur
ried." "You know now that they all stole,"
she persisted.
"But the facts must be legally set
forth. We cannot rush it through."
"I wish you could," she whispered.
"Then we could be married at once."
"I know it. dear," he answered ten
derly. "1 would give anything to hurry
it up, but we must wait."
Harrington, strolling across the ball
room floor, heard and smiled as he
asked Candless for a ten-minute chat.
The younger man went off. proud to be
seen in conference with the man who
really ruled the destinies of his partv.
Three months before Candless would
have shouted at the suggestion that he
might be sent to the senate from his
state. He was merely a young attorney
whose cleverness had gained for hint
a p.ace in the etate legislature. Then
had come the water front investigation.

It couldn't be better," he cried ex
ultingly. 'I ii give you three guesses."
They were inside the library now and
the girl faced him. "Is it the senator
ship?" she half whispered.
Candless nodded as he seized her
about the waist and waltzed her across
the floor to the librarv sofa. He was
like a boy in his exuberance.
"Tell me all about It," she demanded
as she curled herself upon the sofa.
"Was that what Mr. Harrington want
ed of you?"
"Nothing less," exulted Candless. "It
has been decided that I arn the most
available candidate. They will run me
for the state senate with the assurance
that I shall be sent on to Washing
ton." "You'll be awfully busy with the
campaign and the investigation," she
lamented. "I'm afraid I will not see
anything of you at all."
"Harrington has fixed all that," he
explained. "They realize that I icannot
handle both, so Varrick will take over
the investigation. I wanted to keep
on, but Harrington pointed out that I
could not do both and that this was too
good a chance at the senate to be lost."
"And are you going to give up the
investigation? she gasped. Give up
all that has been gained?"
"Varrick can carry it on," he said
impatiently. "We have to make some
sacrifices."
"And you are going to give up the
fight before you have fairly begun?"
she repeated. "You are going to turn
your back on the investigation and let
that fall through that you may go to
Washington?"
"I told you Varrick would take my
place." he said irritably. Marion
turned and faced him.
"Hugh," she said simply, "do you
really think that Mr. Varrick will take
you prace?"
"Why not?" he asked. This was so
different from what he had antici
pated. "I heard Mr. Colqhoon talking to
father last night," she explained. "He
said that the investigation was a com
plete surprise to both parties: that they
had supposed there would be the usual
whitewashing, and that you had made
it a real investigation."
"What of it?" demanded Candless.
"He said." went on Marion, "that
he wondered how they would bribe you
off; that he did not think money could
do it. I was proud of you, then,
Hugh."
"Why not now?" he asked crossly.
"Is it any disgrace to be elected to Con
gress?" "It is a disgrace when you turn your
back on the people who look to you to
right an evil when you sell your
honor for the nomination."
"But I am not selling my honor," he
insisted. "I am simply obeying my
party's call. I am doing, as I am told,
for the best good of the party."
"You mean in running for congress,
but the good of the party means drop
ping the investigation."
"Varrick will carry It on," ho per
sisted. "Not the way you would. Father
said that if you kept on, Harrington
himself would land in jail. Hugh,
don't you see that they are bribing
you. just as surely as though they
put money in your hand?"
The girl watched him curiously as
he sprang to his feet and began to
pace the floor. For a quarter of an
hour nothing was said, then he turned
to her abruptly.
"Marion." he said gently, "you are
right. In my Joy at attaining so soon
what I have so eagerly longed for, I
have blinded myself to the real mean
ing of Harrington's offer. I see now
that he wanted to get me out of the
way. I will go and tell him I will not
run."
He tenderly bent and kissed her,
then rose to his feet and left the
room, while the girl buried her head
ir the pillows.
Harrington stormed and threatened,
but Candless would not be moved,
and in the end, word passed through
the rooms that the announcement that
Candless would abandon the Investi
gation was premature.
Late that evening, after the guests
had gone, Candless lingered in the
library for a good night chat. "I'm
sorry you are disappointed, Hugh."
whispered Marion, "but we can wait,
dear, until your honor comes with
out the taint of suspicion."
"Yes." he said quietly, "even though
it may be a long wait, I will keep my
hands clan."
"Hugh." said Major Sharpless. en
tering through the curtains. "I don't
think you need to wait, my boy. You
have your triumph in being willing ta
forego preferment for your duty. Tnat
is a far greater triumph than the
winning of the senatorship. You may
have Marion whenever you want her."
Hugh turned to the girl. "I want
her now," he said quietly, "for mtf
strength lies in her." -'(Copvrighf.
