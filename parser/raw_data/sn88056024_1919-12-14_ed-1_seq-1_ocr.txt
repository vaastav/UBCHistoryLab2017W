This news will be welcomed with

each afternoon and at 7:10 each morn
ing. It arrives from Huntington at
10:20 a. m. and at 5:45 p. m.
Sunday service between Ontario and
Vale and the afternoon local between
Nampa and Kmmett will also be re
stored.
OTHER TRAINS BACK
Daily service will again be furnished
tlie following points, which under re
duction order have been receiving only
tri-weekly service:
Payette and Kmmett.
Nampa and Lakeport.
Ontario and Crane, Ore.
Ontario and Brogan. Ore.
Nampa and Murphy.
Director Aiahton's wire to the util
ities commission was as follows:
"Have today wired all railroads in
the northwestern region as follows:
'Effective at 12:01 a. m. Thursday, De
cember 18, arrange for restoration of
passenger service to normal basis. If
in your judgment some trains were
removed from service which should not
ba restored for the winter months re
port your recommendation for appro
val. Bxrept as so approved all train
service must be restored not later than
12:01 a. in. Thursday the eighteenth'."
