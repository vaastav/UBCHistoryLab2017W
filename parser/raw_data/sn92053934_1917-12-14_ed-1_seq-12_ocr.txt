SECOND ISSUE OF
BONDS RECEIVED
East "Inline and Silvis are facing a
irrave fuel famine. Dealers said today j
there Is less than 80 tons of coal on
hand to supply the retail trade, and
orders now on file call for many times
that amount of fuel. Of the seven
local dealers in East Moline, four of
tho largest report tlint their coal stock
Is entirely exhausted.
Before Suiidav, unless unexpected
relief comes, the community will ex
perience serious buffering, according
to the prediction of dealers. This
morning one of the dealers offered the
suggestion that residents of the com
munity eonserve the fuel supply to the
greatest extent possible. Those who
ure operating several stoves are ad
vised to cut out all but one. Never
has the sli nation hero been more seri
ous, the dealers say, and they warn
consumers that it may be days be
fore the supply is replenished.
Appeal is to be made to the state
fuel administration. But with the
railway congestion always resulting
from severe cold weather, the trans
portation problem is the most serious,
and the coal men say the outlook Is
gloomy indeed.
Wateriown hospital's coal famine is
over for the time being, though early
iu the week It was very serious again.
Several cars of coal were procured in
East Moline and hi:.uled to the hos
pital liy teams and today another car
v arrived and word came from the fuel
agent, Mr. Fenelon of Galesburg, that
13 cars had been sent forward from
the mines. One car was reported at
liarstow last night. Lr. M. J. Haw
ley, managing oii'uer of the hospital,
reported today that the crisis is
passed, he believes. Though the hos
pital supply was nearly exhausted,
new supply has come each time before
it was necessary to cease operation of
the heating plant.

Charges against F. Much, held in
connection with a recent daylight rob

plea of guilty and his promise to re

method would be to have him paroled
in Moline city court.
There was doubt on the part of
some of the officials as to whether the
city court had jurisdiction in police
court cases, but M. J. McEniry, as
sistant state's attorney, was sure it
had, and it was taken before Judge G.
O. Dietz. The necessary papers could
not be found and a continuance was
taken until this afternoon to secure
them from Rock Island.
Both the complaining witness and
the defendant lived at 1402 Fourth ave
nue, Moline. According to Hickson's
story, his new suit was missing last
night. Mose Zukerman, of whom the
boys rented, thought he had seen Bo
cox leave with the garments on, and
with real sleuth intuition he beat it
for the Burlington station, where he
found the defendant "all dolled up."
Mose attempted to take the clothes off
the back of Bocox. A fight ensued
and the defendant broke and got away,
which caused Mose to call the police,
and the arrest, followed. The defend

Obituary
GERMANS PRINT IRISH
NEWSPAPER IN BERLIN
Amsterdam. (Correspondence of the
Associated Press). The first number
of a new German review, the Irlsche
Blatter (Irish Leaves) has just made
its appearance in Berlin. It is pub
lished by the German-Irish society,
which is under the presidency of Ma
thias Erzburger, assisted by Count
Westarp and Baron Von Richthoven.
The editor of the journal is George
Chatterton Hill, while St. John Gaff
ney, former American consul-general
at Munich, is one of its directors.
The first number contains letters of
congratulation and good wishes from
General Ludendorff and former For
eign Secretary Zimmermann. These
are followed by the "Inaugural Ad
dress" of the German-Irish society,
which says in part:
"The war has proved that Germany
has very few friends. But the Irish
have acted as friends at home as well
as in the United States, and Germany
Miss Edna Ogelsby, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Simpson Ogelsby, former
residents of Moline, has qualified as
a Red Cross nurse in Chicago and ex
pects to iKive soon for New York

Miss .Ogelsby has "been studying in
the Chicago city hospital since last
spring and passed the Red Cross ex
amination Tuesday. She attended the
Moline high school before leaving for
Chicago with her parents, five years
ago. Her father . was a motorman
for the Tri-City Railway company and
the family resided on Third avenue
between Eighteenth and Nineteentc
streets.
Orders have been sent out from
Washington that only Red Cross
nurses will be accepted for service at
the front in Europe. In addition there
is a crying need for Red Cross, nurses
at the cantonments in the United
States. ' .
A Red Cross nurse is a graduate
of an accredited training school for
nurses which is connected with a
hospital with an average of fifty pa
tients each day. If she resides in a
state having a law regulating the pro
fession she must have a state cer
tificate. In addition she must hold
membership in a nursing organiza
tion affiliated with the national nurs
ing organization. She must submit
to a physical examination, and sub
mit a satisfactory thesis on Red Cross
organization and nursing and must
be between the ages of 25 and 40
years.
