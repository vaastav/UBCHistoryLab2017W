Arrested on Minneapolis Charge.
Etchison was arrested in thl* city
last Wednesday night by Detectives
Hughlett and Springmann. Chief of
Police Oscar Martinson of Minneapolis
wired a request for his arrest on a
charge of murder, giving an address on
U street as his place of residence. The
detectives learned that he had left the
U street house some time ago, and
that he had taken an apartment at the
Cavendish.
It was some time after 11 o'clock at
night when the detectives reached the
Cavendish, called at Etchison's apart
ment and informed the occupant that
they wanted to see him.
"Come around in the morning," said
Etchison, starting to close the door.
"Is it the same old affair?" the wife
is said to have asked her husband
when she learned that the callers were
detectives.
Etchison answered In the affirma
tive.
Insists on Delay.
??You can't come in here." was what
Etchison said to the detectives, when j
they addressed him. "Come around in I
the morning and I'll talk to you.
??We've got ot see you tonight" one
of the siuths told him. "and if you
don't open the door there'll be a scene
here in about one second. This is a
matter of importance."
"What is it all about?" asked the
occupant of the apartment from behind
the partly closed door.
"We have a telegram from the chief
of police askinsr for your arrest on a
charge of murder," said Spr'ngmann
sharply, "and we want you."
Etchison opened the door and admit
ted the detectives. He asked permis
sion to write a check for his wife,
which was granted, and a few minxites
later he was behind the bars at the
first precinct police station. When
questioned bv the detectives, who had
not been told anything of the circum
stances of the alleged murder, the
prisoner said he supposed the arrest
was in connection with the death of
Mrs. Price.
Alleged Statement to Police.
The police say that Etchison told'
them that he and Mr. and Mrs. Price
we&t for an automobile ride during No
vember, 1914, and while on the trip ex
perienced tire trouble. According to
Ktchison, he and Price got out or the
machine to fix the tire, and Mrs. Price
also got out to walk while they were
so engaged. When they finished their
work they missed Mrs. Price, and a
search revealed that she had fallen
over an embankment. He denied that
Mrs. Price was murdered, and told the
police that he had been In Minneapolis
several times since the occurrence
without even being questioned by the
police.
The Minneapolis officers left here
Sunday afternoon with Etchison.

SENATOR JOSEPH E. RAN8DELL,
President.
Mobilization of the forces from
all parts of the country, which
for the next four days will discuss
the needs of adequate system of
inland waterways, began here to
day. It was the vanguard of the
thousand or more delegates who
will attend the twelfth annual
convention of the National Rivers
and Harbors Congress, which will
open tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock at the New Willard Hotel
with an address by Secretary Wil
liam C. Redfield of the Depart
ment of Commerce.
The registration headquarters were
opened on schedule at 11 o'clock on the
mezzanine floor of the New Willard, but
none of the delegations had put in an ap
pearance at noon. Two delegations, how
ever, arrived in the city. They came from
Ohio and Oklahoma. It is expected that
the delegations from various parts of the
country will be arriving continually dur
ing the afternoon and night. The regis
tration bureau probably will get its rush
of work tomorrow morning Just about the
time the convention opens, at 10 o'clock.
The Invocation will be delivered by Rev.
Earle Wilfley, pastor of the Vermont
Avenue Christian Church.
Flans Are Discussed.
Plans made by the advisory com
mittee for the convention were dis
cussed today at a meeting of that body
in the office of 8. A. Thompson, secre
tary-treasurer of the congress, in the
Colorado building. Members of this
body reported on the preparations
made and in general outlined the pro
gram. The members of this body are
O. J. Stephens, New York city; Repre
sentatives John H. Small of North
Carolina and William D. Stephens of
California, Capt. W. B. Rodgers of
Pittsburgh, John A. Patten ef Chatta
nooga, Albert Hettinger of Cincinnati,
Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, president
of the congress, and 8- A. Thompson,
secretary-treasurer, the last two ex
officio members of the body.
A popular note Is expected to be struck
in the convention meetings this year
in the relation of an adequate inland
waterways system to a national pre
paredness program. Many of the
speeches. It is believed, will turn to
ward the need of a network of water
ways as an essential part of the na
tional defense program.
Representative J. Hampton Moore of
Pennsylvania will deal principally with
this side of the waterways question in
his address Thursday. Coastal canals,
it is pointed out, will at gziit ut
,?
In modern defensive operations for the
rapid shifting of submarines and tor
pedo boats, and protecttgr them from
risks which they would run if forced
to travel in the outside waters. The
Inland system also would be of consid
erable use for the transportation of
supplies in time of war ana would re
lieve the railroads of traffic Jams In
time of peace.
The outgoing1 board of directors is
scheduled to hold the last meeting of
Its one-year term tonight In the cabi
net room of the New Wlllard. Senator
Ransdell will preside, and will receive
reports from the various directors.
Three Seselons a Day.
Three sessions of the convention, 10
o'clock In the morning, 2 o'clock in
the afternoon and 8 o'clock at night,
?re to be held tomorrow and Thurs
day. The convention is scheduled to
end Friday about noon, following the
election of officers and the passage of
resolutions offered during the proceed
ings.
Following the address of Secretary
Redfleld tomorrow morning. Col. c.
McD. Townsend, Engineer Corps. L. S.
Army, will deliver an address on "The
Utilization of Western Rivers for Navi
gation"; Paul W. Brown of St. Louis,
"Rivers and Rails"; former Gov A O.
Eberhart, St. Paul, Minn., "W ho Is Re
sponsible for the Failure to Develop
Our Waterways." The morning session
will end with the reading of President
Ransdell's annual report.
Illustrated talks on rlvef and harbor
Improvement work will be features of
both night sessions during the conven
tion. ?
Keeping the Great Lakes Open.
Present efforts on the part of the
United States government, with the co
operation of the Canadian government,
to keep the great lakes open to navi
gation in order to facilitate the move
ment of crops is referred to In a state
ment issued by Senator Ransdell of
Louisiana, president of the National
Rivers and Harbors Congress, as an ar
gument for the need of an Inland sys
tem of waterways.
"The great lakes system is practical
ly our only developed waterway." says
the statement, "yet. important as it is.
It does not allow direct shipmnets of
grain to our ocean ports and. In addi
tion. is closed by ice for several months
of the year. The Department of Com
merce evidently appreciates the fact
that the more grain left in the great
lake region at the close of navigation
the greater will be the strain imposed
on the railroads, which are already so
overburdened that serious difficulties
have arisen.
Economic Principle Discussed.
"In view, therefore, of the transcend
ent economic Importance of a means of
moving crops from the west to the
east, the need for economy In federal
appropriations which is accentuated by
the extraordinary requirements of the
defense program should not be permit
ted to cause a serious curtailment of
expenditures necessary to develop the
rivers and harbors ,of the country. Be

be open in 1917 and will facilitate the
shipment of freight to eastern ports,
there should be a means of water
transportation from the great lakes
and the vast territory north and west
of them into the Mississippi river for
freight destined to markets to which
the southern ports are the logical ship
ping points. This is a prime necessity
which has long been recognised by
traffic experts as well as engineers."

National Committee Proclaims
Party Success as the
Watchwordfor-1915.
UNITY OF EFFORT VOICED
BY CHAIRMAN McCOMBS
Committee Organizes and Subse
quently Holds an Executive Ses
sion to Consider Contests.
Harmony, enthusiasm and earn
estness were the keynotes of the
democratic national committee, as j
sounded in expressions of its |
members, upon the meeting of j
that body at the Xew Willard this I
morning. 'Chairman William F.j
McCombs, in calling the meeting
to order, voiced the spirit of the
gathering of these official mana-1
gers of the democratic party.
"This is an auspicious time for hold- j
ing our meeting/* said Mr. McCombs,
"at the beginning: of a democratic Con- i
gress. We are all co-operating for the
future success of the party. This com- j
mittee, representing the states and ter
ritories of the Union, by its close and j
cordial co-operation can have tre- j
mendous influence In carrying the.
party to further success.
"There is no cloud on the party
horizon and it is the duty of this com
mittee to see to it that there shall be I
no cloud on the democratic horizon, i
A* your chairman I shall continue my j
unremitted efforts, exerted through I
five years of association with demo
cratic national politics, for the success
of the party."
A like sentiment was expressed by
Thomas J. Pence, who was elected tem
porary secretary and will be chosen
permanent secretary.
Mr. Pence Lauds Chairman.
In gracefully acknowledging the
honor done him, Mr. Pence took occa
sion to say:
"I deem it only proper at this time
to refer to stories of friction in the
committee, some of them relating to
the chairman of the committee and my
self. These newspaper stories that have
appeared from time to time are base
less and without the slightest founda
tion In fact. Along with all democrats
who know the truth, I have deprecated
them. I want to testify here to the
splendid service rendered the demo
cratic party by Chairman McCombs.
""I have worked in harmony and per
fect co-operation with him in the pre
convention and presidential campaigns,
and I shall do so in the future. I have
at heart the success of the democratic
party, which has an administrative and
legislative record that challenges ad
miration?one that has been so com
pelling that it has received the active
support of members of all parties.
"In conclusion I want to say that I
shall give with heart and soul the best
that Is in me to the party of Jefferson,
Jackson and Wilson."
