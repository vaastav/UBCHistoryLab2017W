TWELVE PAGES.
They Will Go for Chandler, Now.
ENATOR CHANDLER of New
Hampshire will doubtless be the
next to receive criticisms at the
hands of those newspapers which are
finding fault with every movement
which has for its object the investiga
tion of the charges of bribery conne.t
ed with the election of Mr. Clark. Mr.
Chandler introduced a resolution in
structing the senate committee on priv
ileges and elections to investigate the
right of W. A. Clark of Montana to re
tain his seat. Like Fred Whiteside,
Congressman Campbell, Attorney Gen
eral Nolan, Charles S. Hartman and
Governor Smith, Senator Chandler
must now expect to receive a torrent
of abuse from those who are consist
ently opposing each and every action
which seems to be aimed at an investi
gation of the manner of Mr. Clark's
election.
It makes no difference what course
may be pursued in this matter-those
who seem to be afraid that the secrets
of the Clark election may be exposed,
find fault with that particular course.
It makes no difference what men of
high standing may express the view
that Mr. Clark is not worthy of the seat
he is occupying, or may endeavor to
forward an investigation into h:I elec
tion, their actions are sure to be criti
cised by those newspapers which are in
favor oa Mr. Clark retaining his seat, no
matter what crimes may have been
committed to place him there. What
ever course may be pursued to bring
about the investigation of Clark's elec
tion, the objection Is made that that
course is not the right one. Whatever
man may take a prominent position in
this matter, the objection is always
made that it was "bad taste" or "m
proper" for that particular man to have
take part in the proceedings; that some
one else should have takecn the promin
ent part.
It is very apparent that no course
which could have been decided on to
bring about the investigation would
have been satisfactory to those who
want no investigation. It is apparent
that no prosecutor or complainant
would have been satisfactory to those
who want no prosecutors and no com
plainants.
Like Whiteside, Campbell, Nolan,
Gvernor Smith and the rest, Senator
Chandler will probably be able to stand
it.
Unfairness in Debate.
p NY cause that Is a good one, can
be upheld by fair, unevasive
argumentation, and without
misrepresenting either the essential
facts or the position of the opposing
side. When shifty tactics are resorted
to it Invariably creates the suspicion
that the cause is intrinsically weak.
This Is In accord with all human a.x
perience and in every forum of dot'bit.
When a shyster lawyer is :n court
with a had case, he always endavc,rs
to keep as far fromu thot main issue a:;
possible, directing the attention ,f
court or jury to matters of sc-cndary
consequence and frequently of no col
sequence at all. Favorite weapons i1
such cases are abuse, ridicule and mis
statement so far as the latter is possi
ble In a court of law.
Such practice is usually brought up
with an a round turn when attempted
in a court of character and ability.
But of course In debating public ques
tions before the people no arbitrary
restrictions can be imposed. As a rule,
those who essay the discuss!on of such
questions can only be held in check
by their own sense of propriety, and
there is no safeguard against false and
misleading statements except as it may
exist in the discriminating intelligence
of the people.
It is doubtful if any period of our
country's political history furnishes
clearer and more convincing evidence
of the truth of these reflections than
is found in the attitude of parties, In
dividuals and newspapers during the
last year. This evidence has manifest
ed itself in a striking degree in the
treatment of the Philippine question
by Mr. McKinley and his supporters.
As to the president's policy in those
islands we have yet to see the first
absolutely fair statement either of the
merits of the policy itself or the atti
tude of its opponents. In this sweep
ing declaration we make no saceptions,
but include everything which has been
said upon that side whether uttered by
the president himself, one of his cabi
net officers, or the most insignificant
follower.
In his recent message the president
not only makes statements of facts
that are open to the gravest question,
but he completely ignores the very
essence of the controversy. So far as
our right to the Philippines is con
cerned he relies solely upon the treaty
with Spain, by which that country
transferred to us whatever title she
had. Th!s he asserts to be perfectly
good, and to give us a title that can
not be assailed either in law or equity.
In view of the fact that at the time
of the signing of the treaty the insur
gent natives had wrested nearly or
quite nine-nine one-hundredths of the
territory from Spain, and were then in
possession of it, even this technical
argument is far from being conclusive,
especially the "equity" part of it.
But the opposition stands upon a far
higher plane. It asserts the broad
principle that the ten millions of na
tives have just the same natural and
unalienable rights in their own coun
try that we have in ours, and that
their plea for self-government is one
that no American can justly deny. Mr.
McKinley absolutel: ignores this great
princilple, and this attitude of the oppo
sition.
His statement that the vast major
ity are loyal and desirous of submitting
to American rule has no foundation of
proof to rest upon. Every person hav
ing the slightest familiarity with con
ditions in the islands knows that not
only has there been no attempt made
to get a fair expression of sentiment,
but that the American authorities have
never yet come into actual touch with
one-fifth of the population. It is there
fore simply impossible for him to know
what their wishes are, and every rea
Eonable presumption is against his con
clhsion.
It is persistently assumed that the
-,rrosition has demanded and still de
mands that the military and naval
forces of the United States shall be at
once withdrawn from the Islands. No
such demand has been made any more
than in the case of Cuba. The con
tention is that the Filipinos should
have the assurance of self-government
at the earliest practicable day and the
assistance of the United States in main
taining it.
Nor has the opposition objected to
the acquisition ef naval and coaling
stations, or any commercial conces
sions possible to secure by the free ands
voluntary act of the people of the sal
ands. In this way we could have ac
quired every desirable commercial and
naval advantage without any sacrifice
of blood or treasure, and without !n
curring the odium of trampling upon
the liberties of the people of.those dis
tant Isles.
These are the issues as presented
these are the issues that neither Mr.
McKinley nor any of his apologists
have even attempted to squar:ly meet.
On the contrary, we have had eva
slons, quibbles and misstatements,
coupled with the epithets "copperhead"
and "traitor"-epithets which an edu
cated parrot could employ quite as well
and with just about equal intelligence.
Hence the unavoidable conclusion that
the president's policy is a bad one, and
indefensible by fair and candid debate.
Bloodiest of All Battles.
C EýERAL METHUEN'P little dis
• patch to the effect that his bat
tie with the Boers at Modder
river was "the bloodiest battle of the
century" has aroused a controversy in
the press of this country and of Europe.
In proof of Methuen's claim, the Den
ver Republican publishes a table show
Ing the percentage of losses in some
of the great battles of the century. At
Jena 110,000 men were engaged and the
percentage of loss was 20. At Water
loo the number of men engaged was
139,608, and the percentage of loss was
21. At Bull Run the number of men
engaged was 60,527, and the percentage
of loss was eight. At Gettysburg the
number of men engaged was 150,000 and
the loss was 40 per cent. At Sadowa the
number engaged was 291,000 and the
loss 11 per cent. At Gravelotte there
were 396,000 men in the battle and the
loss was 15 per cent. At Sedan the
number was 314,000 and the loss 15 per
cent.
The Republican figures that the per
centage of losses in the Modder river
affair was greater than in any of the
big battles it names. The Modder river
affair, however, could scarcely be char
aecterized as anything more than a skir
mishl. General Methuen's losses, ac
cording to his official report, were 452,
while in the three days' fighting in
ithat vicinity the total reached 965 men.
That is a frightful percentage of loss,
n.'n.sidlcrin;g the cmeparatively small
number cf men engaged, but in the
civii "war, in the Napoleonic wars and
in th IFrancu-Plrussian war engage
ments brilctc tn such small bodies of
men would nt be considered battles
and would hardly be dignlled by an
official rep.r:t to the authlrities.
If the nullitlbr vf Inll lost in prollor
tion to tihe numr,,lr ulgaged, irrespl)c
tive of how large r small the contend
ing forces may have bcell, is to be con
sidered in determlnining what is "the
bloodiest battle of the century." then
surely Custer's battle with the Sioux
and Crow Indians in M.ontana is de
serving of that designation. At Modder
river, as in all the other battles men
tioned, only a portion of the total num
ber reported as "lost" were actually
killed. Many were only wounded and
many were captured. All these are
designated in the oflicial report as
"lost." But in Custer's battle there
were no wounded and no captured. On
that fateful day in June, 1876, Custer's
entire force,261 strong, was annihilated.
Not one was left to tell the story. The
percentage of loss on the side of the
United States army was 100. That was
a bloodier battle than the one in which
General Methuen was engaged.
A Step Forward.
T.HFERE is hope that Butte's School
of Mines will be equipped and
opened before another year has
passed. Steps to effect this most desir
able result were taken at the recent
meeting of the state board of educa
tion in Helena, and the members of the
board seem determined that there
shall be no further delay. At the meet
ing of the board the trustees who had
had charge of the construction of the
school tendered their resignations,
their part of the work having been
completed. A new board of trustees
was appointed, the members of which
are eminently qualified to take up the
work intelligently and energetically
and start the school under such favor
able auspices that it will surely be
come the success which Montana's
school of mines should be. The new
trustees are J. E. Rickards, James W.
Forbis, George E. Moulthrop, W. Y.
Pemberton and J. V. Long.
At the last session of the legislature
the sum of $25,000 was appropriated for
the equipment of the school. If this
amount can be madeimmediately avail
able it should be sufficient to equip the
school partially, and perhaps to such
an extent that it can be opened in the
fall. The trustees will have entire
charge of the equipping of the school
and the selection of the faculty. The
branches taught will be chemistry,
metallurgy, mineralogy, geology, min
ing, mining engineering, mathematics,
mechanics and drawLng. The state
board insists that the school must be
opened by September next.
There will be general satisfaction
that a good start at any rate has been
made towards the opening of the
school. To the traveler approaching
Butte the splendid new building of the
School of Mines is the most consplcu
ous object. It is invariably the subject
of inquiry on the part of all visitors to
Butte. Its possibilities are boundless.
No more time should be lost in getting
the school opened, and the people of
Montana are confident that the trus
te . are possessed of the push, enter
prise and ability which are required to
speed the day when Montana's School
of Mines shall be a reality.
ENRY CLEWS, the Wall street
banker, wants an act passed by
congress which will determine
forever the gold standard beyond any
',quivocatijn. Certainly he doer. So
do nearly all the leading financiers of
the country. So does Secretary Gage
and so does William McKinley. But
how do they expect to get such a meas
ure? Are they ignorant enough to sup
pose that one congress can enact a law
which another congress cannot repeal
if it has a president in accord with It?
The enactment of such a law will give
the gold power an unquestioned advan
tage, because to repeal it will require
the joint action of both houses of con
gress and the approval of the presi
dent. But it can be done.
i---- -
The Question of Quantity.
Sf has been observed, repeatedly, that
every essential argument of the bi
metallists, is admitted by the cham
pions of the gold standard except when
the silver question is under immediate
consideration.
This is notably the case with refer
ence to the quantitative principle. Illu
strations innumerable have been given
showing the truth of this statement.
- We find it constantly exemplified in the
operations of the treasury, in the
I changing conditions of finances in Wall
street, in the conduct of 'the Bank of
England and in fact in the daily busi
ness affairs of every individual.
If, as has been so often claimed, the
extension of credit has had the effect
t of making the quantity of money im
a material, why is not a single gold dol
lar in the United Staes treasury as
3 good as two hundred millions, and why
have the people been burdened with
I two hundred and sixty-two millions of
dollars ad iitlonal interest-bearing debt
in order to keep the gold reserve above
* the one hundred million dollar mark?
'Why does Wall street get frightened
over gold exports? Why is there ever
any talk of "scarce money" in that
center? Why does the Bank of Eng
land put up the rate of discount in
order to protect its gold reserve? Why,
in short, does any business man ever
- fall, if the quantative theory is an
i "antiquated" "pre-historic," "fossil
" ized" and "utterly senseless" Idea?
Why don't banks and business men
bridge over the:r difficulties by merely
extending their credit a little farther?
The answer is plain. They cannot.
They have already gone the limit in
the matter of credit, and have reached
a point at which actual money must
be forthcoming or the credit will col
lapse.
Among the great gold dailies of the
East is the Boston Herald. Only re
cently that paper published an edi
torial ridiculing the quantitative the
ory, and declaring that "quality," not
"quantity," was the great desideratum.
And yet no longer ago than the second
of the present month, in speaking of
the action of the Bank of England in
raising the rate of discount to six per
cent, the Herald said: "The Bank of
England is taking precautions to meet
any drain of gold that may come
through the war in South Africa. This
war is a knife that cuts both ways.
It cuts off the supply of gold from the
Transvaal mines, and it calls for large
shipments of sovereigns to meet the
heavy war expenditure. With this out
10ok the bank Is quite right to put ireit
in a strong position."
Here we have as complete a recog
nition of the quantitatlve principle as
it is possible to put into language. The
man who denies the theory of quan
tity in money, must stand ready to
defend the position that a business man
or a bank can do as much business
with one thousand dollars by simply
increasing the use of credit, as he or
it could with a hundred thonsand. We
may discuss this point for the present
with a very simple query: If the quan
tity of money has nothing to do with
prices and business, why did the recent
shortage of money cause a break In
stocks, and why did Mr. Gage deem it
necessary to throw eighteen million
dollars of additional gold into circu
lation?
~ RESIDENT M'IKINLEY and Ad
miral Dewey have done a highly
commendable action in jointly
undertaking ts pay the expenses of a
preparatory course of study for the son
of Captain Gridley, late commander of
the Olympia. The course of study is
designed to fit young Gridley for ad
mission to a lieutenancy in the marine
corps. Young Gridley is now too old
to enter Annapolis, and the marine
corps is the only place in the naval ser
vice open to him. Admiral Dewey pro
posed to get him appointed to the ma
rine corps and planned to pay the
necessary expenses. When he began
to explain his plan to the president,
however, Mr. McKinley insisted on
being "in on nthe deal." Captain Grid
ley's participation in the battle of
Manila is well known to the American
people. That his son will prove worthy
of his parentage and be a brave de
fender of the flag, no one may doubt.
F-RANCE is having a disagreeable
quarter of an -hour over Mr.
Chamberlain's recent speech, in
which he boasted that England bad
won the affectiods of America and Ger
many. If France were wise, she would
know that the adroit Chamberlain was
talking through his hat. He had to say
something to quiet England's exaspera
tion over her heavy losses in South
Africa. Among his other accomplish
ments, Mr. Chamberlain possesses the
art of "Jollying." He is also something
of a bluffer. It was an exceedingly
clever speech he made, considered as a
speech-shrewd and wily to a degree.
But there is very little fact behind it.
American sympathy is principally with
the Boers. German sympathy, too, is
almost entirely with them. Chamber
lain is an adept in infiuencing public
sentiment in England. To produce a
given result he will say anything.
W HAT the country wants next
year is an honest Census. In
1890 many clues resorted to
wholesale padding. Rumors were per
sistent then, and have not died out to
this day, to the effect that the showing
made by many places was at*ained by
improper methods and by no means
represented the real population. These
suspicions have done the cities affected
more harm than any exaggerated cen
sus could possibly do them good. Noth
ing but transitory benefits can accrue
from a dishonest count. The country
should begin the new century on an
honest basis.
Current Comment.
Bryan's Leo.ership.
From the Salt Lake Herald.
Bryan is stronger with his party to-day
than he was in 1896, and no democrat has
been able to offer a single reason why he
should not be renominated. His cause has
endeared itself to the people. He is tnelr
leader, the champion of their rights and
liberties, the foe of their oppressors. To
change such a leadership would be worse
than folly. It would be a surrender to the
influences that have been encroaching
year by year upon the rights and liberties
of a free people.
Hanna Not a Quitter.
From the Boston Herald.
The announcements of the forthcoming
retirement of Chairman Hanna of the
republican national committees continue
to come in, but it will probably be safest
to await the confirmation of these re
ports by Hanna himself before they are
accepted as true. Hanna isn't much of a
quitter when the fortunes of his friend
William McKinley are involved.
Not a Promising Outlook.
From the Salt Lake Tribune.
The Paris exposition for next year has
not a very promising outlook. The Drey
fus case was a wet blanket upon it, and
now the French press is so bitter toward
England that all England is incensed.
The French press does not confine itself,
to general terms of abuse of England, but
cartoons the queen and the Prince of
Wales shamefully. The prince is the
head of the royal commission of the Brit
lsh section for the fair, and now he pro
poses to resign and cut the whole bust
nuess. That would finish the fair so far
as England is concerned. Then there is
a good deal of lukewarmness in this coun
try. France has not had a kindly word
for the United States since the war with
Spain was brought on, and a good many
people are debattng whether It is worth
while to spend $15,,000,000 on ari exhibit
and in visitlng France or not. If the
French had a bit of sense they would
call down their newspapers.
Bryan's Running Mate.
From the Washington Star.
Then, in 1896, the democrats tripped up
on their vice pr.-sidential nomination.
They selected a man of ability end of ir
reproachable life, but he had no political
following at home, and he failed to sat
Isfy the populist allies. The populists
were so dispislased, indeed, that. they in
sisted on making a vice presidential nono
ination of their own. And thus Mr. Bryan
found himself with one head and two
tails, and at a serious d'.sadvantage on
that account . r. Watson was objection
able to the democruts, and Mr. S.wall
to the popullsts. For next year Mr. Itryan
should have hut i.ne running mat,., and
he should be most Judiciously chosen. And
maybe when matters pass the stage of
mere personlll compliment, and the proper
time comes, the Nebraskan will yield to
tile necessity of expressing a preference.
Must Think For Itself.
From the Missoula Democrat-Messenger.
Congress has become so accustomed to
have all i:t thinking done in the speaker's
chair that it will require some little;, f
fort to throw off its timidity and do a
little thinking of its own
" AOPYING AMERICA.
The lGermans HWae Deolde& to ktabtlih
a Commerlal Museum.
Berlin, Dec. 7.-since the return of
the German delegates to the Philadel
phia exposition deep interest has been
manifested here in the plans for found
ing a commercial museum in Berlin
upon the Philadelphia model. The
btsreau'for the preparation of commer
cial treaties, which is a priyate organ
ization of manufacturers, had a meet
ing -to-day and decided to draw up
plans for presentation to the govern
ment expecting to get a large appro
priation.
Herr Vosberg Rekow, the bureau's
general manager, said in the course of
an interview this afternoon that three
divisions were intended, namely, man
agement, collection and information.
The promoters will try to establish re
lations with the Philadelphia museum.
It is estimated that the annual expense
will be about 250,000 marks,
Other organizations are moving in
the same direction. On Dec. 15 the In
dustrial league will hold a meeting, rep
resentatives of the government attend
ing, to deliberate regarding the estab
lishment of a museum. Herr Vosbeig
Rekow has delivered an address before
the Society of Berlin Merchants and
Manufacturers upon the Philadelphia
congress and museum, in the course of
which he spoke of American achieve
ments in manufactures and in the -ex
port trade.
"The invention and organizing tal
ent of America," he said, "will play an
enormous role in the world's trade. We
Germans must bestir ourselves in order
to keep even.
"American manufacturers, however,
have developed one-sidedly. Many
branches are neglected, but when the
Americans once take up a new branch
they will knock out European methods.
The information bureau of the Phil
adelphia museum is most admirable
and already exercises an influence upon
the whole world, although only founded
in 1894."
PALMER DENIES IT.
He Says He Has Not Come Oat for W. J.
Bryan.
HIowell, Mich., Dec. 7.-The following
letter from Hon. John M. Palmer, who is
at the head of the sound money demo
crats, was written in answer to an alleged
interview asserting that he had came out
in favor of W. J. Bryan. The letter de
nies the Lntervlew as follows:
"Springfield, Ill., Dec. 5.-Isac M. How
ell-My Dear Sir: I have read your favor
of Dec. 1, 1899. I have not seen the inter
view to which you allude and do not know
what it contains, but a real interview
took place when I was in Washington re
cently, in which I said that Mr. Bryan
would be nominated by the democratic
convention and that with him as its can
didate the free silver issue could not be
concealed and that I would not support
him, and I did not predict his election.
"I find that the free silver republicans
entertain the same view that I do, that
on the issue of 16 to 1 Mr. Bryan's opin
ions are known and cannot be glossed
over. Mr. Bryan will lose Illinois by 100.
000 votes in ily opinion. No gold demo
crats will vote for him. Very respectfully,
"JOHN M. PALMER."
MILLER IS FOUND.
He Will Bitterly Fight Proceedings for
Extradition.
New York, Dec. 7.-The Brooklyn
Eagle says that a lawyer intimately
connected with an investigation into
the affairs of the Franklin syndicate
has given the Eagle information that
W. F. Miller, the manager of the Frank
lin syndicate, is under surveillance near
Montreal on a Caladian warrant,
charging him with having in his posses
slon stolen goods brought into Canada
by him from the United States.
The charge under which he may be
arrested is made to hold him until the
proper steps can be taken to complete
extradition proceedings which have
been begun. It will take four days to
finish the extradition papers, it is said,
and get them to Canada, so that he
may be brought into this country for
trial. It was also said that Greenshields,
the Canadian criminal lawyer, has been
retained by Miller to fight any extradi
tion proceedings that may be brought.
Gen. Young Heard From.
Washington, Dec. 7.-To the relief of
the war department General Young has
been heard from after a week's ab
e.ence in the interior of Luzon. General
Otis cabled this morning as follows:
"Manila, Dec. 7.-General Young re
ports his arrival at Vigan on the even
ing of the 5th, having encountered a
force of the enemy at Narbacam, 12
miles south of the city, whom he drove
to the eastward of the same into San
Quentin canyon. His troops are now
pressing them back. The country Is
extrtmely roughand strongly intrench
ed. About 600 prisoners who escaped
reported the insurgents allowed all but
Americans and prominent Spanish
prisoners to escape from Bangued. La
ter the insurgents were driven back to
the mountains. Will send transporta
tion with subsistence and medical sup
pl:>s to-morrow to Vigan to bring the
prisoners to Manila and to supply
Young's troops with the necessary
quartermaster's stores. Our casual
ties were one killed and 12 wounded,
the wounds being mostly slight. The
enemy left in the trenches 25 dead, a
few rifles, several thousand rounds of
small ammunition and 40 shrapnel.
Young has sufficient troops to meet all
difficulties."
China Claims Damages.
San Francisco, Dec. 7.-The Chinese
and Portuguese governments, through
their local consuls, will join in a joint
claim against the United States and J.
R. Dunn, chief of the Chinese bureau,
for $50,000 as compensation for the
death of Ho Mun, a native of Portugal
and a subject of China. The complalnt
will be filed to-day with Collector of
Customs Jackson, and recites that Mun
died by reason of the negligent treat
ment of the United States government,
through its agent. J. i. Dunn. The
case proceeds under the treaty of 1894,
based on 'the convention of 1.80. Direot
charges against Dunn will be sent to
Collector Jackson and Secretary Gage.
Ho Mun was in this port, an applicant
for admission, when he was taken sick.
Were Illegally Arrested.
Washington, Dec. 7.-United States
Consul Dudley at Vancouver, B. C.,
has informed the state department that
after an inquiry into the circumstances
attending the alleged kidnaping of the
American, Everett. across the Cana
dian line from the town of Republic,
Wash., he has concluded that the man
was wrongfully arrested. He has
mailed a detailed report to the state
department as a basis for action in this
case, probably a demand for 'the re
turn of the man to the United States.
Everett was charged with stage rob
bery and the consul shows that the
officials of Ferry county, Washington,
were chiefly to blame and not the Can
adian officers for 'the kidnaping.
