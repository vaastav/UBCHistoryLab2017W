WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President
Wilson's address at the opening ses
sion of congress today was wholly
devoted to domestic subjects, princi
pally the problem of railway legisla
tion. In the hall of the house, with sena
tors and representatives assembled
In joint session, President Wilson, in
accordance with the custom he began
at the opening of his term, read his
address from the clerk's desk.
The president not only renewed
his recommendation for legislation
to prevent a nation wide railway
jtrle or lockout before there has
been opportunity for investigation,
but defended it againHt the attack of
organized labor as nothing arbitrary
or unjust and the "justifiable safe
guarding by society of the necessary
processes of its very life."
Aside from recommendations for
the passage of the Porto Rico gov
ernment bill, the corrupt practices
bill and the Webb bill to lesallKe
American collective selling agencies
abroad, the president's address was
devoted wholly to the railroad situa
tion. The only feature which had
not been forecast was the elimination
of the proposal that congress give
explicit approval to consideration by
the Intei-state Commerce commission
of an Increase in freight rates to
meet additional expenditures by the
railroads caused by the operation of
the Adamson law.
Interstate Commerce
Today, the president took the posi
tion that "the power of the Interstate
Commerce commission to grant an
increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is Indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem
to draw in question the scope of the
commission's authority or Its Inclina
tion to do justice when there is no
rauou to doubt either."
The other recommendations on the
railroad tlluatlon made In a special
manage during the last session.
which were not put into law, were
renewed today. They Include:
"Immediate provision for the en
Itrgtment and' administrative reor
gulutlon of the interstate Com
merce commission along the lines
embodied in the bill recently passed
by the house of representatives and
now awaiting action by the senate
la order that the commission may be
enabled to deal with the many area!
end various duties now devolving
upon It with a promptness and thor
oughness which are, with its present
constitution and means of action,
practically impossible.

tratlon of such controversies as the
present by adding to it a provision
that, in case the methods of accom
modation now provided for should
fall, a full public investigation of the
merits of every such dispute shall be
Instituted and completed before a
strike or lockout may lawfully be
attempted.
"The lodgement in, the bands" of
the executive of the power, in case
of military necessity, to take control
of such portions of such rolling stock
of the railways of the country as
may be required for military use and
to operate them for military pur
poses, with authority to draft Into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials aa the circumstances
may require for their safe and effi
cient use."
Compulsory Investigation
The renewed recommendation for
compulsory Investigation of labor dis-
putes on railways before strikes or
lockeuts are allowed, which has
aroused the opposition of the railroad
brotherhoods, and of the American
Federation of Labor, was defended
In the president's message. He de
clared he would hesitate to recom
mend a law which would force in
dividual workmen to continue in an
employment which they desired to
leave, but that no such principle was
Involved in the suggestion that the
operation of the railways of the
country should not be stopped by the
concentrated action of bodies of men
until ' a public investigation for the
benefit of the public has been In
stituted. Powers of Employes
"It Ir based upon the very different
principle," he continued, "that the
concentrated action of powerful
bodies of men shall not be permitted
to stop the industrial processes of
the nation, at any rate before the

No other cigarette can give you this new enjoyment
(satisfy, yet mild), for the good reason that no cigarette

nation shall have bad an opportunity
to acquaint itself with the merits ot
the case between employe and em
ployer, time to form its opinion upon
an impartial statement ot the merits,
and opportunity to consider all prac
ticable means of conciliation or ar
bitration. I can see nothing In that
proposition but the justifiable safe
guarding by society' of the necessary
processes of its very life. There is
nothing arbitrary or unjust in It
unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly
done. ' It can and should be done
with a full and scrupulous regard for
the interests and liberties of all con
cerned, as well as for the permanent
Interests of society itself."
"At the last session of the congress
a bill was passed by the senate
which provides for the promotion of
vocational and Industrial education,
which is of vital importance to the
whole country because It concerns a
matter too ?ong neglected, upon
which the thorough Industrial prep
aration of the country for the critical
years of economic development im
mediately" ahead of us in very large
measure depend. May I not urge its
early and favorable consideration by
the house of representatives and its
early enactment into law? It con
tains plans which affect all interests
and all parts of the country, and I
am sure there is no legislation now
pending before the congress whose
passage, the country awaits with
more thoughtful approval or greater
Impatience to see a great and ad
mirable thing set In the way of being
done.
DEATH OF A CANDELARIA

PARIS, Dec. 5. At a secret con
sistory held yesterday, which was at

dict announced the nomination of 10

the work. His holiness concluded
