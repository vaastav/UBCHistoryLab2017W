The American Elise —Their Man
ners.
• For now these many days we have
been hearing a great deal about the
famous "Four Hundred of New York."
These superfine aristocrats embrace all
the blue blood of Gotham, although,
upon occasion, by special grace as it were,
there have been balls given in the metro
politan city with the approval of the
augnst McAllister, which embraced as
many as eight hundred of tbe nobility of
the land. Bat this appalling figure—
suggestive of many a plebeian interloper
waa only eked ont by admitting the
friends of the elite of New York from the
various sections of the Union. Still it
was a concession of doubtful wisdom,
and has done much to impair tbe exclu
sive character of the blue bloods of New
York.
The Naw York World of a late
date records a new departure of the
aristocratic Four Hundred. It appears
that they bave lately adopted a practice
of paying the mass of their social obli
gations during the opera. That is to say,
the gilded youth during the progress of
the music keep up an interminable
trampling from box to box, and the aris
tocratic voices of both sexes maintain a
terrible clatter, several hundred people at
once talking in an ordinary conversational
tone, utterly drowning the singers izi
knocking the orchestra galley-west. Not
long ago, an impudent and presumably
cultivated plebeian sitting in the gallery,
who had paid his vulgar dollar to hear
the music, got np in his place, squared
round on the Four Handled aud said it
was an outrage that such a clatter
should be kept up. The importunate
wretch continued that if the aristocratic
portion of the audience had no more
knowledge or appreciation of music than
80 mauy hogs, that was no reason why
they should interrupt the enjoyment of
those who had. For the moment this
Goth disturbed the self-pjesession of the
Four Hundred, and there was v hnsh of
amazement. They quickly caromed on
their cheek, however, aud after an in
stant's pause the hubbub was as great
as ever.
Ie ia true that in European theaters
there is a good deal of social intercourse
at the opera, but it is almost etitirel y
between acts, and the conversations are
conducted in well-bred undertones, For
any demonstrative intercourse the foyer
is availed of. There is no attempt to
marshal multitudes through the exigen
cies of acknowledging calls. Tae whole
Four Hundred in movement at once, with
their loud, vulgar ways, make it very
binding for the quiet lover of music. He
feels like getting down in his boots or
reaching aronnd for a dynamite bomb to
hurl into the disturbing quarter.
Verily, the Four Hundred, with the
illustrious Ward McAllister at their bead,
are a mighty institution. They are aris
tocratic to the tips of their dainty finger
nails. The success with which they can
dig up coata of arms and quarterings of
nobility almost makes them oblivious of
their real origin. Some of them can
produce irrefragable evidence of having
had a grandfather, although the number
who can do so is limited.
It is true that most of these aristocratic
people are the sons or grandsons, daugh
ters or grand-daughters, of soap boilers,
lager beer sellers, tobacconists, trades
men of various sorts, and other people of
low degree. One of the daughters of old
Commodore Vanderbilt once turned up
her nose at a lady, with thereruaik,
"She's nobody." The Commodore, who
never lost his good sense, quietly re
mark ad, "My dear, your mother once
sold beer by the glass." Disgusting ob
servation! Unfeeling man! To thus
interrupt the flight of his gifted daughter
to the aristocratic empyrean ! The tor
family also settle down in their secure
aristocratic ease in the eclectic Four
Hundred with a luxurious sigh of enjoy
ment, notwithstanding that old John
Jacob, who built up the multiform mil
lions that make the triba, once peddled
pretzels and things in New York City.
Oreat are the Four Hundred and their
affiliations throughout the United States,
installing California, and in Europe. The
THK LO3 ANGELES DAILY HERALD: TUESDAY MUKHIISTQ, DECEMBER 17 1889.
newspapers a short time ago were fnll of
the suit for'libel brought by Mrs. John
W. Mackey against an English news
paper man, who had blasphemously ac
cused that lady of having had low as
sociations—of having done washing or
something of that kind. The lady
resented the allegation with becom
ing spirit. In the numerous biographies
of Mrs. Mackey we are as
sured that she waß a daughter
of Col. Hungerford, a veteran of the
Mexican war. Grand old man! He
was as good a barber as ever wielded a
razor in Virginia Oity or elsewhere, and
his title of Colonel was one of those
pleasing figments of the imagination so
common in the United States. He was
just as much of a Colonel as he was a
Bishop. Neither more nor less.
On the whole our American aristocracy
is making great progress. On the Pa
cific Coast it is largely known as the
Irishtocracy. A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.
Ir considering ;the great diversity of
manufactories that can' be successfully
established here, we are astonished that
no practical movement has yet been
made to erect smelting works. Los An
geles has by far the most attractive
situation in the State for the profitable
establishment of such works. She is in
rail connection with a mineral territory
that would now furnish ores enough to
supply smelting works of the largest
class. All tbe smelting ores of Arizona,
Calico and the Lava Bed districts could
be smelted here at a saving of
five hundred miles of transportation.
The works at Melrose, Alameda county,
and those of Selby in Contra Costa
connty, are the nearest to the mines of
this region of country. When we have
rail connection with Pioche,' a vast
extent of mineral country, abounding in
rich smelting rock, would give So great
an impetus to the business of smelting
works here that their capacity would
have to be enlarged indefinitely. The
logic of successful smelting would
be to enlarge the facilities of
the establishment so as to in
clude separating and refining works—
indeed every branch connected with a
complete metallurgical establishment
would inevitably follow the successful
operation of smelting works. To initiate
a great enterprise of this character, it is
only necessary that the company should
start ont on a comparatively small scale.
Its tendency would be to grow and
expand, and the men who inaugurate an
enterprise of this character will confer a
boon of inestimable value upon our city.
If carefully managed and developed to
the capacity which our tributary mineral
districts would warrant, ten thousand
men would find constant employment in
these works before many years had
passed away.
Tbg Cronin jury, contrary to expecta
tion, found a verdict, and a carefully con
sidered one, quite evidently. O a its face
it is the result of a compromise. Mr.
Cnlver evidently made his eleven obsti
nate fellow jurors realize the enormity
of their conduct. It would Beem to those
who are outside of the hurly-burly of
the passions which agitate the citizens of
Chicago that all these paople ought either
to have been hung or turned loose.
They were either guilty of conspiring to
assassinate Dr. Cronin—a conspiracy
which was consummated—or they were
not. If they were there could be i?
fractional guilt. The slightest knowledge,
with connivance, made all these men as
guilty of murder as if each indi
vidually had struck the blow that
killed Cronin. There is grave reason to
doubt whether, in the present condition
of pnblic sentiment in Chicago, these
men could have got a fair trial. While
the presiding judge was impartial and
masterly in his charge, the District At
torney and the Police Department from
the openicg stages showed a determin
ation to press the machinery of their
offices to the last extreme to bring in a
verdict of guilty. It may be said that
not only were the prisoners prosecuted
but they were persecuted with a skill,
vigor and animosity seldom equaled.
There are great undercurrents of hate in
the local politics of Chicago, and it is
quite likely that these figured to a quite
appreciable desree in the late trial.
The Board of Supervisors have started
out to prosecute the bondsmen of the
celebrated San Fernando vaquero, El
Hyder Hammond, of happy memory and
elusive presence. This is an altogether
praiseworthy move, and the wonder is
that they were not proceeded against
lone ago. What pleasing visions of gay
and festive revelings at the expense of
the county the name of El recalls! He
justified tbe oriental prefix to his name.
.Like a French poet described by
Daudet, Hammond could have exclaimed,
"I believe in love as I believe in God."
He was a model exemplar of the party of
all the intelligence and all the decency.
The misfortune of the people of Los
Angeles was that he made them pay for
the lascivious pleasings of the lutes which
played for his entertainment on Ala
meda street to the tune of $9,
--000. Ha was one of the benefactions
given to the people of Los Angeles
county by "the party of great moral
idea 3." That $9,000 recovered would
help the taxpayer out not a little.
The citizeps of Los Angeles will en
tertain Col. J. C. Robinson at a banquet
at the Maison Dorrs tonight. Whilst
thus complimenting Col. Robinson, the
able, efficient and tireless Superintendent
of our great street car cable system, our
people accentuate their appreciation of
the enterprising capitalists of Chicago,
whose faith in Los Angeles has war
ranted them in giving our city the finest
system of street cir accommodation in
,the United States.
We would submit to property holders
living upon streets that have been
washed oat by the rash of waters
from the receat rains, and now find
their gravel facings swept away, that
they wonld secure themselves psrma
nently against such inroads in the future
if they would adopt the rock asphaltum
pavement. Hope street, which is today
gutted by the great overflow from the
Arroyo de los Reyes, would have
carried all the water of tbat stream
off nicely, without damage to their street
or its curblngs, if tbey had only paved it
with bituminous rock. In the end such
a pavement would have subserved the
purpose of economy, as well as have
avoided a very "distressful" state cf
their thoroughfare.
Mayor Hazard is soon likely to gain
quite a reputation as a fulminator of
vetoes. He yesterday vetoed the pro
posed cut of forty feet on Bnena Vista
street, on the ground that a tunnel would
be better, and he vetoed the license ordi
nance on the ground that taxing the
wholesale dealers at the came rate as the
retailers would multiply the number of
saloons. His veto of the ordinance
making manufacturers pay a license of $5
a month, will be approved by everybody.
We certainly ought to throw no impedi
ments in the way of starting industries in
this city.
Wh at a cold, formal, insipid letter of

AMUSEMENTS.
"Uncle Tern's Cablu" Produced at
the Loa Angeles.
The Los Angeles theater was opened
last night, with a new version of Uncle
Tom* Cabin as the attraction. This
dramatization is by F. E. Griswold, and
is said to have received the particular
approbation of Mrs. Stowe, the authoress
of tbe story, as the nearest to a true his
trionic representation of her own con
ception of the incidents in the book. It
certainly differs much from the other
plays based on that story.
The affair in any form seems to be
pereunial in its attractiveness for a cer
tain portion of the people of the
North. For many months theatrical
business has bean dull here as
compared with what it had
been for a few years past. Notable com
panies have visited the city and gone
away somewhat disappointed. When
Robson came here with The Henrietta, be
waß surrounded by an unusually fine lot
of artists. The play is very ninth above
the average; but it failed to crowd the
Grand. The Duff Opera Company is
the best on tbe road, but it did not fill
the same house to suffocation by any
means. Last night the Lob Angeles
seats were very well filled in all points
by an audience that simply went wild in
its enthusiasm over a play nearly every
one present had seen countless times be
fore. The cruel and exaggerated
incidents of the story elicited
burst after burst of applause,
and yet it is not a strong cast taking it
all in all. Those who have seen Stock
well play "Marks" must have been dis
appointed in Mr. Sommers. The same
ia true to some extent of all the cast.
Yet the big audience was pleased to a
most remarkable degree.
It becomes an interesting psychologi
cal inquiry how long this story will con
tinue to exercise such sway over the
minds of so large a portion of the popu
lace. It was natural enough in anti-tie I
lam days when the New York Tribune,
Wendell Phillips and the other Abolition
ists kept the North in such a state
of mental tension on the negro,
that Mrs. Stowe's book and the
dramatic versions of it should be a sort
of political bible with its mystery plays
founded on it. But it is now nearly a
generation since the African in the
nation's mid t became no n»or* a chattel,
oilf a vot.tuu.G "man and brother.*'
This great fact has been potent in driv
ing negro minstrelsy from the American
stage. In the old slave days the planta
tion melodies, with their weird pathos,
exercised a potent spell on the minds
of the people of the States where slavery
was known only by report. The old
Christie Company in New York
was a very popular entertainment.
This lasted until the war was over and
the negro free. At once the plantation
melody and the burnt cork artists lost
their charm. All sorts of fantastic ex
pedients had to be resorted to in order
to please tbe playgoers of the country.
Thus came Billy Emerson, with his Irish
policeman, instead of "Ole Black Joe;"
and so Johnson and Slavin came with
their ebony hued Hamlets, Aritonios
and Romeos of gorgeous array to replace
"Massa's in the Cold, Cold Ground,"
"She Says Now Don't Be Foolish, Joe,"
and "Mary Blame." But even these
expedients could not keep the breath in
the moribund body of minstrelsy from
which the soul had fled. The other
day DocksUdter failed from lack of
patronage, aud had to flee to
Canada. Johnson has boen forced to
leuve Ms favorite branch of his profes
•iju and uk* refuge in comedy. Billy
Emerson is K»tting old. Charlie Reed is
doing lioyi'd plays, in which the negro
does not appear. No yonng candidates
for histrionic laurels are seeking the
coveted wreath by means of the burnt
cork. In fact, the days of minstrelsy are
passed,not to return, and it is time some
one wrote its "Last Lay." How long
will it be before the came influences will
banish Uncle Tom'i Cabin from the
American stage? From the cnpwds that
throng the Los Angeles this week, and
make the ceiling ring with their applause,
the time does not seem very near.

THE CLAYTON MURDER.
A resolution was introduced by Laeey,
of lowa, directing the Committee on
Elections to inquire into the contested
election case of Clayton against Breck
inridge, of Arkansas (Clayton having
been assassinated while preparing his
case).
Breckinridge, of Arkansas, said it had
been bis intention to offer a resolution
of the same import, but since the ad
journment of last Congress proceed
ings had been taken in the United States
Court in his State, relating to matters of
current report in the district he repre
sented. Inasmuch as those proceedings
seemed to bim to be conclusive, and as
the court was one not organized by his
party or any member cf his party, but
was throughout its whole organisation a
Republican court, it had appeared to
him the proprieties of the case de
manded that the iniative should be
taken by tho other side as it had been,
lie trusted a proper disposition would be
made of the resolution, and the action of
the Committee on Elections would be
such as to give amplest range of inquiry
tbat was proper under tbe jurisdiction of
the House.
Crisp contended that the resolution
must go to the Committee on Elections,
but he was overruled and the resolution
was adopted.
