i VICT0RI0U8 IN DEFEAT.
The message of President Harrison,
which is ' published ' in the dispatches
to-day, ia the hut ono which he will
deliver to the people as executive of
the nation, and is a document worthy

dentias done this with facts and
figures that cannot be controverted.
It must be a source of pride with
Mr. Harrison, as it is with every Re
publican in the United States, that
after thirty years of practical test
given to the principles - which form
the groundwork of thejparty, Buch
prosperity can be shown in every do-

partmect or industry, xne uetno
- - crats may attempt with ; ridicule to
' laugh down the marked increase of
wages, 'of employes, and of amount of
money in savings banks; but these
will not down at their bidding, and
will be a veritable Banquo's ghost in
.1896. There "never haa been such an
era of prosperity as has been witnessed
during the past ten years, and the
purchasing cower of money haa never
been so high, or labor as well paid.
The future historian cannot ignore"
these facta, and if another Republican
president does not occupy the . White

The Telegram, if it ia an annex of
the Oregonian, is sufficiently Demo
cratic to be distinguished from the
: great paper to which it owes its exist
ence. - In commenting on the remark
of Senator Stewart that the president's
message is an overdrawn picture of the
prosperity of tbe country, it says: "By
comparison we are morn prosperous
than a good manv other natioas. Yet
our degree of prosperity is far below
wnat it would have been if our tariff
and financial legislation had been in
.the interest of the masses instead of
in the interest of the classes. McKin-
leyism has been a blight upon our com

been achieved by the protection policy
in the history of the country for the
past thirty years, and if the doctrines
of the Democratic cartv had been fol
jowea since iovi wcuia the coun

it is ' now t v These are perti
ment questions, and which the Tele
gram may readily answer. . When the
greatest financial depression has been
suffered by other countries, the United
States has been effected tbe least, and
has always had the balance of exchange
with foreign countries in her favor.
Given tbe same conditions as existed
in 1865, and, would the doctrines ad
vocated in the Chicago ' platform in
1892 have met the contingencies aa
readily aa did the protective policy of
the Republican party? That legisla
tion has been for the masses w proved
by the fact that there has been a large
increase of wages and -more earned per
capita under the last ten years of high
duties than ever before in the history
of the country. Times are ood, and
much better than they will be after a
few years of Democratic rule. We
shall wait patiently and see if the
Democracy has the temerity to at

A'long account is published in the
dispatches regarding the marital infe
licity of Mr. and Mrs. Storey, previous
to her divorce from him, and this will
be read with avidity by a morbid pub
lic so soon after her tragic death. This
depraved appetite to eagerly devour
every slimy morsel of scandal in
reference to anyone whose lips are
closed by . the portals of the tomb
from explaining or refuting, is fed by
the pres3 that catere to the vicious
taste. Mr. Storey should have had
sufficient respect for his former wife
and the mother of his children to cover
her frailties, whatever they may be,
with the mantle of pilence, and by
giving publicity to matters in which
people generally have no interest ex
cept idle curiosity, and whicti should
be forever hidden from the public, be
has proved himself less a man and an
unfit husband for a refined and sensitive
wife. But very probably there will
be chapter after chapter of this stuff
until readsrs become suifeited and de
mand something new and more palata
ble.-
With the opening of the sprir.g
business may be expected to be brisk
at The Dalles, for indications point to
many factors of development being pu t
in operation. . As soon as the contract
is let work will be begua At tbe Loc ks
with the greatest activity, and the
portage railway above this city will be
under way if the necessary appropria
tion can be procured from the legisla
ture, which is . very probable, These
improvements will make this point
what nature designed it to be the
great distributing center of the inter
ior and if growth and prosperity do
not result the blame will rest with our
own people. As often stated in these
ci.amns, The Dalles haa all the nat
ural resources for a great inland com
mercial and business point, and in the
near future these will be developed
and wealth will flow in the wake of
enterprise. . Our citizens should pre
pare for the inauguration of good
times, and the ,best preparation is to
keep abreast of the car of advance
ment.'-
Seattle has an unenviable reputa
tion for tragical endings to love affairs,
and within the past few days tw
people have met their death at the
hands of jealous' suitors. Mr. Boyd,
intelligent and well connected, was th
victim of his neglected wife's pistol
and more recently Mrs. Storey, a tal
ented and accomplished musician, met
her death by Moulton, whom she re
fused to marry. This high tension of
nerve and fever heat of blood cannot
be the result of the sluggish, misty
climate ot the Sound, but must be
from some other cause. ' Perhaps the
excitement of "booming" real estate
may have unbalanced the mental eqni
librium of our neighbors by the Medit
erranean of the Pacific, and the facul
ties may not have settled down to a
normal condition yet.
Dr. Parkhurst, as president of the
Society , for; the Suppression 'of Vice,
may be euccessful in throwing -sunlight
upon hidden corners in - the great city
of New York, and in showing that the
police have winked at violations of
law in this regard he will have accom
plished his oljecr. But Superintend
ent Byrnes proves by statistics that
New York is less vicious than other
large cities, and this ia some commen
dation for her police force. The war
has begun between the custodians of
the peace of New York and thia emi
nent divine, as president of the society
named, and further developments may
be expected in relation to the high
ways and byways of the metropolis of
the new world.'. .
The election is over, and now is tbe
appropriate time to advocate laws re
stricting immigration. Before election
it might injure either party to make
an onslaught on the foreign element
in our population; but now that the
ballots have been counted it cau do no
injury. It is, perhaps, a fact that
great good would result to the country
by closing the gates to the undesirable
cla se-; but .it would accomplish
greater good to pass laws to regulate
the elective franchise. There are too
many ignorant voters in tho country,
and if these were debarred from the
privilege of electors their power of
msking mischief would be greatly cur
tailed. .
xne prevailing query among the
people is in regard to the weather, and
if the winter will be a hard one. Of
course this is a problem of difficult
solution; but heavy snowfalls will be
very beneficial to the" country, and
would insure abundant crops next
season. it baa been demonstrated
during the past few years that fall and
pring rains will not produce good har
vests, and snow in winter, which grad
ually melts and soaks in the ground, ia
the one thing needfuL Therefore, the
best interests of this portion of the
state will be subserved by continuous
snow 8 tor m s for the next few weeks. '
ITS USE AND ABUSE.
The death of Mr. Jay Gould has
furnished the text for many long edi
torial sermons in the press against the
prevailing ambition in the minds of
American youth of, accumulating
wealth by any means or atthe sacri
fice of many of the pleasures of life.
These sermons are well-timed, and es
pecially so when the possessor of a
colossal fortune passes out of existence
without leaving behind him the least
kindly remembrance, except . with the
immediate members of his family.. .If
Mr. Gould had devoted his wealth,
like Peter Cooper, or other philan
thropists, for the amelioration of his
fellow man, his memory would have
been cherished by posterity, and the
world would have been much better
for his having lived; but, aa it ia, it
gave no comfort or happiness except
to himself, and the monument which
marks hia last resting place will re
rsivfl liltle veneration. That he was
an extraordinary man, is demonstrated
by bis executive ability and financial
management in accumulating such im
mense riches from such' an humble be
ginning; but if these faculties had
been in youth bent in a different di
rection he would have accomplished
more lasting good, and would have
been moradonored and lamented in
his death.
But the ambition to acquire riches
in the youthful mind, and in which
Mr. liould proved himself so success
ful, cannot be blamed while money is
considered the only passport to social
and politica honors in this country.
It seem3 to be the "open sesame" to
the higher plane of existence, and the
philosopher in home spun occupies a
lower position in the opinion of man y
than the ignorant ass in broadcloth
The ancients first discovered the truth
of the old aphemm, "The love of
monev ia the root of all eviL" While
poverty i8 considered criminal and
wealth a legitimate excuse for vice, it
will so continue, and men and women
will strain every nerve to hoard up
the shining dollars. So long as stand
ing in society, position in politics, and
exemption from the ordiuary burdens
incident to an honest life can be pur
chased by gold, the- highest desire of
all will be in that direction. - In this,
Mr. Gould has simply successfully car
ried out the ambition of nearly every
schoolboy and schoolgirl in the land.
of many statesmen and scholar?, of
legislatora and lawyers, of 80,010 judges
and divines, and he is a pattern wor
thy of their imitation. The end justified
the means with him as it does with
them. They will never reach the
hight he attained, and may employ less
fruitfnl ways; but the same hopes and
heart-yearnings after the accomplish
ment of the object permeate them as
him, anfl like him they sacrifice every
pleasure in life and trend under foot
the better and higher feelings of them
selves and fellows in this unceasing
race after the golden guinea. "
But money 13 necessary in every
walk of life, and its possessor has the
means of accomplishing great good. It
should be used as the means to accom
plish desirable ends, and not the only
object of human existence, to which
all others are to be slavishly subser
vient. The man who has not suf
ficient appreciation of its value to
provide for himself and family, under
favorable circumstances, has no claims
upon society and a very meager right
to exist at all. It is an excellent
servant; but, es a master? it brutalizes
every feeling in the human heart;
blunts the sense of honor and integ
rity, and gives free vent to passion,
duplicity and -vice. There are many
noble attainments, the acquisition of
which raises the - man. or woman to
higher plane of existence, w.hich may
be acquired by its 'use; hut its' pos
session alone leaves ' one as poor in
mind and soul as when he was born
into the world. '

y . EDITORIAL -NOTES.
Congress haa assembled, but haa
done no business other than the for
mality of opening. . -
An open river by the government
and a portage railroad from The
Dalles to Cehlo by ' an appropriation
from the Or6gon-legislature are tbe
demands of Eastern Oregon, and must
be heeded. ...
' The roads of Oregon should be im
proved by convict labor, and the next
legislature should enact laws that these
criminals who are fed . at the expense
of the state should be put where they
would do the most good. ;-;
There has been considerable space
given to cabinet-making aincethe elec
tion; but Mr. Cleveland has sufficient
individuality to make hia own choice
in the matter of advisors during his
administration of public affairs.
The Oregon delegation are at their
posts in Washington City, and we
have perfect confidence that work on
the locks wilf not be unnecessarily de
layed." A word to Senators Dolph or
Mitchell or Representative Hermann
will cause a seaiching investigation.
Our people are waiting patiently in
reference to letting' the contract for
work on the locks, and it is time that
something was done .in the matter
we are satishad the Oregon delegation
will carefully watch, this subject and
see that there is no unnecessary delay.
The few months of Republican rule
in congress -will be very unfruitful of
an results. Every measure originated
in the senate will be butchered by the
obstructionists in the house, and the
people may expect little beneficial leg
islation except it is Democratic in its
inception.
The monetary conference in session
at Berlin is making little progress in
reference to bi-metallism. Labor as
the basis of all values and gold as tbe
standard of monetary exchange seem
to be economic principles too well
settled among commercial nations to
be easily changed.
Another race after public lands, like
that at Oklahoma, may be expected
when the Nex Perces reservation, near
Lewiston; Idaho, is open for settle
ment. - T'he Lapwai agency has many
desirable acres, and it seems a prevail
ing idea among Americans to own a
farm, when ita possession co3ts little
or nothing.
Oar legislature convenes next
month, and the papers of Eastern
Oregon should continuously advocate
the portage road above thia city to
overcome the obstructions to naviga
tion in the Columbia river. Thia de
mand for an open river will be heeded,
for behind the press are the people,
who are unified in regard to the import
ance of this needed improvement.
Look In all English papers and see
the positive demand for relief for the
starving thousands which London
papers declare countless, which are
unemployed. And such is the out
look that the government has issued
circular letters to county and munici
pal authorities demanding immediate
help and relief or the direst colamitj
must follow.
The fight against the Union Pacific
by other transcontinental lines is only
interesting to the people in the fact
that it may reduce rates to the mini
mum, and this cannot come too quick
ly to suit producers. When railroads
begin to fight each other shippers may
expect fb reap the benefit, and for
this reason the public will nay, let the
fight go on, and let it wage fiercely
The annual report of Postmaster
General Wanamoker gives a good
showing for his department, and never
in the history of the country were pos
tal matters under better business man
agement, or furnished better facilities
to the people. - In connection with the
excellent administration of President
Harrison, the historian will accord him
well merited praise for the selection of
an honest and capable cabinet.
The French chamber of deputiesare
attempting to let sunlight shine upon
the crooked transactions in relation to
the Panama canal. It seems that sev
eral in connection with . the scheme
have made surprising .dividends to
their own advantage, and some of the
deputies desire an accounting. But
investigation in relation to the fraud
J practiced may be fruitless of results,
except to mystify tbe transactions and
shield tbe thieves.
Tbe present congress will be of
short duration, and the civil service
will soon be changed from Republican
to Democratic control. Already there
are many applicants for positions not
yet vaesht, and by the time President
Cleveland ia inaugurated there will be
more than enough office-seekers to fill
every public trust that the Democracy
desires to dole out to favorites. The
average citizen may vote for the prin
ciples which he honestly ei-dores, but
the trained politician has a keen out
look for remuneration for labor given

Father Neri, commenting on the telegram,
said that there was po tradition of this money

he believed there was no truth in the story,
and another is that the society never amassed

- Two Brave Vlrls. -
.t
Tacoma, Dec. 8 Two brave girls, with
a lantern, saved a heavily laden Southern
Pacific passenger train from total des
truction, near Grant's Pass, Or., Wednes
day evening. The wreckers had re
moved tbe outside rail over the high
trestle across Cow creek canyon, and had
not the engineer been signaled just as be
was approaching it, tbe entire train
would have plunged to tbe bottom nf tbe
roc lev gulch, 45 feet below. The fu 1
story of tbe attempted wreck, which tbe
Southern Pacific evidently suppressed, is
told here to-night by Dr. G. V. Calhoun,
one of tbe Washington presidential elec
tors, wno arrived this evening from Cali
fornia. He says tbat tbe displaced rail
was discovered by two young ladies wbo
crossed the trestle with a lantern just be
fore the train arrived. They were horri
fied tt the discovery. Just then the train
was heard approaching. One of the gir's
instantly rushed up tbe track: swinging
the lantern over ber bead, seeing which
the engineer stopped tbe train at the ap
proach of tbe trestle. The train con
sisted of 13 cars containing 250 passen
gers and. Dr. Calhoun says tbe loss of life
would have been frightful bad the train
not been stopped. The wreckers did the
work quick y, as the tr irk was all right
when the waichman passed over the 'res
tie half an hour before train time When
the passengers learned of their narrow
escape tbey made up a puise and ap
pointee a committee to learn tbe'ldentity
of the brave girls and buy each an appro
prlate Christmas present.

tor of tbe Church of the Savior, in Pierre
poot street, tbat city, wbo disappeared
from bis board it) g houre Thursday last,
and it is generally believed be is dead.
Police Superintendent Campbell bus re
ceived no further tidings of the missing
man. Mr. Millelt, ot Boston, a brother
io law of Mr. McCleary, is said to bave
expressed tbe opinion, while here looking
for tbe minister, tbat everything the
missing man did before going away in
dicated be was carrying out a settled
plan ot action. He was careful to pay
every cent be owed before he left Brook
lyn. It bag been said that tbe young
minister's mind was affected by the
poverty and suffering be found among
tbe poor of Brooklyn. Many people
came to him witn sad tales of want and
distress, and his knowledge tbat there
was so mucb mibery around bim and that
bis power to .relieve it was limited,
preyed on bis mind. It is said be used
to walk tbe floor of his room for hours
talking aloud about thia state of affairs

The following facts and figures show the
progress of the country under the administra
tion of President Harrison, and the success of
the policy of protection:
In submitting my annual message to con -gress
I have great satisfaction in being able to
say that the general conditions oflecting the
commercial and industrial interests of the
United States are in the highest degree favor
able. A comparison of the existing condi
tions with those of the most lavored period in
the history of the country will itself show that
such a degree of prosperity and so general a
diffusion of comforts of life were never beforo
enjoyed by our people. The total wealth of
the country in 1S60 was $16,159,615,068. In
1890 it amounted to $62,610,000,000, an in
crease of 287 pei cent. The total mileage of
the railways in the United States in i860 was
30,626. In 1890 it v.as 187.741, an increase
of 448 per cent, and it is estimated that there
will be about 4000 miles of track added by
the close of the year 1892. The official re
turns of the nth census and those of the 10th
for the 75 leading cities furnished the basis
for the following comparison:
Capitii invested in tnanurg, 1S80.... 41,232 839 670

Value of pr-Hluct, 1880 2',7ll679!aO
Value of product, 1b90 ,8B0,28(i,737
THE INCREASES SHOWN.
I am informed by the superintendent of the
census that the omission of certain industries
in 1880, which were included in 1890, ac
counts in part for the remarkable increase
thus shown. But after making full allowance
for the differences of method, and deducting
the returns for all industries, not included in
the census of 1880, there remain in the re
ports from these 75 cities the following in-creases:
Capital employed
Value of product i

Ji umber wage earners
..... $1,5-22.745.60
... 2,0J4,23,I6S
.... O77,33,02
856,029
The wage-earnings not only show an in
creased aggregate, but an increase per capita
from $386 in 1880, to $547 in 1890, or 41:71
per cent. The new industrial plants estab
lished since October 6, 1890, up to October
22, 1892, as partially reported in the Ameri
can Economist, number 345, and the exten
sion of existing plants 108. The new capital
invested amounts to $40,449,050, and the
number of additional employes to 37,285.
NEW FACTORIES BUILT.-
The Textile World for July, 1892, states,
that during the first six months of the nresent
calendar year 135 new factories were built, of
which 40 are cotton mills, 48 knitting mills,
26 woolen mills 15 silk mills, 40 plush mills,
and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills, 2T
have been built in the Southern states. A.
B. Shepperdson, of the New York cotton ex
change, estimates the number of working
spindles in the United States September I,
1892, at 185,000,000, an increase of 660,000
over the year 1891. The consumption of
coiton oy tne American mills in 1891 was
2,396,000 bales. From 1869 to 1892, in
clusive, there has been an increase in the
consumption of cotton in Europe of 92 per
cent, while during the same period the in
crease of consumption in tbe United States
has been about 15 per cent
THE TIN- PLATE INDUSTRY.
The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of the
treasury department, shows that September
30, 1092, there were 32 companies man u lac
toring tin and tin-plate in the - United States.
and 14 companies building new works for
sucn manntacture. I be estimate ot tbe in
vestments in buildings at the close of the fis
cal year, June 30, 1892, if existing 'conditions
were to be counted, was $5,000,000, and the
estimated rate of production 200,000,000
pounds per annum. The actual productySn
for the quarter ending Scptembet , 30 1892,
was 10,952,725 ponnds.
