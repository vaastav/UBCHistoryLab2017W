uary of President Roosevelt a message to
congress: ,
The president begins his first annual
communication wnu umi. c.......
tnent of the death of the late President
McKinley, and a eulogy of his former
chief In which he aays:
it nnt too much to say that at tne
- r Praoint Mjctniev's death he
was the most widely-loved man In all the
United States, while we have never had
in nubile man of his Dositlon who has
been so wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities Incident to public life. His po
litical opponents were the first to bear
the heartiest and most generous tribute
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty Integrity
In public life he united the tender affec-
tions and home virtues which are all
; Important In the makeup of national
. character. A gallant soldier In the great
war for the union, he also shone as an
armnlj tn alt mil- ninnl because Of hlS
conduct In the most sacred and intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act
ed with aught but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fail to
respect him who Knew mm in puuuu
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality ny asserting uuu ij " .
cised for political ends Inveigh aSWnst
wealth and irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
The shock, the grief of the country, are
bitter In the minds of all who saw the
dark days while the president yet hovered
between life and death. At last the light
was stilled In the kindly eyes, and the
breath went from the lipa that even In
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
his friends and of unfaltering trust in the
will of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with Infinite sorrow, but with such
pride In what he had accomplished and in
his own personal character that we feel
the blow not as struck at him, out as
struck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who Is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of his life and the
grand heroism with which be met his
death."'
In the same connection he makes
strong recommendations as to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchv be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
prevent anarchists from foreign countries
landing upon our shores. He would also
have the federal courts given Jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or any
person who is in line for succession to
the presidency. He has no fear, however,
that the country will ever fall into an
archy. Tie Trusts. ..
The president sees cause for congratu
lation for the nation in the business condl-
' mendous and highly complex industrial
Bi oinnmpnt whirh went on with ever ac-
-' celerated rapidity during the latter half
nf the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the present and future. , He

customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes in the business world, op
erating in other countries as they operate
' In our own." In this connection he says:
) ''The process has aroused much antago
nism, a treat part of which is wholly

at the present time. There have been
abuses connected with the accumulation
UL weaiin, yei 11 remauii iruo mai a lor-
tur.e accumulated in legitimate business
can be accumulated by the person spe
cially benefited only on condition of con
ferring immense' Incidental benefits upon
others. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only ex
ist if the conditions are such as to offer
great prizes as the rewards of success."
But while he realizes existing condi
tions, he emphasizes the fact that congress
in providing remedies must act with cau-
tion, as the men and corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
railroads across the continent have done
great good to our people, and without
them the material development of which
- we are so justly proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog-
. nise the immense Importance to this ma
terial development of leaving as unham
pered as is compatible with the public
good the strong and forceful men upon
whom the success of business operations
, Inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions will satisfy anyone
capable of forming a judgment that the
personal equation Is the most important
factor in a business operation; that the
business ability of the man at the head of
any business concern, big or little, Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking success and hopeless failure."
He points to the fact that in the past
"the ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective friend of the
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing In dealing with business interests
for the government to undertake . by
crude and ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that It would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the Impossible or the
umlMlraKU .a. a V lit., nf thA
forces with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor . to find out In rational fashion
what the wrnnn rejillv are and to what
extent and in what manner it Is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies (or the Trnai Evil.
But while he says the above Is true, he
j et rees meny evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
chief is over capitalization, "because of
it many baleful consequences.' lie says:
"The conviction of the American people
that the great corporations, known aa
trusts, are in certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
1 based upon sincere conviction that com
bination and concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable U toils controlled, and la my
judgment this conviction is right."
As a remedy 'or these evils he says:
"The first essential in determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations Is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the public
. the government should have the right to
Inspect ana examine tne workings 01
thA grat corporations engaged in inter
state business. Publicity is the only sure
remedy which we can now Invoke. What
further remedies are needed In the way
f governmental regulation or taxation
ran only be determined after publicity
hao been obtained by process of law and
In the course of administration. The first
requisite Is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world. , , '
"Artlllcial bodies, such aa corporations
and Joint atock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate information as to their
operations should be' made publics regu
larly at reasonable intervals."
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
state, always do business in many states,
often doing very little business in the
state where they are Incorporated. There
is utter lack of uniformity in the state
laws about them, and aa no state has
any exclusive interest in or power over
their acts it has in practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore In the
Interest of the whole people the nation
should, without interfering with the pow
er of the states in the matter itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doing an inter
state business. This is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency in its
business. There would be no hardship In
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it, and in their case it is now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed it
is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as is now the pase with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts in
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that it will be
possible to secure the needed remedies
for the trust evil under thj constitution
as it now exists, but if congress thinks
otherwise he recommends that a constitu
tional amendment be subm tted tnat will
coi.fer the po-ev necessary.
In connection with the trusts he rec
ommends legislation creating a cabinet of
ficer, to bo known as secretary of ;nm
ne.ee, whose di ties would be, to deal
with all qn iitlons concern', g commerce,
later and th mfcbant mauno.
Would Exclude the Chinese. '
The messace contains a strong recom
mendation (or tie reenactment at once
of the present Chinese exclusion act, in
which connection he says:
"Wages are higher to-day In the United
States than ever before in our history
and far higher than In any other coun
try. The standard of living is also higher
than ever before. Every effort of legis
lator and administrator should be bent to
secure the permanency of this condition
of things and its improvement wherever
possible. ; Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but it should also
be protected so far as it is possible from
the presence in this country of any la
borers brought over by contract or of
those who. coming freely, yet represent
a standard of living so depressed that
thev can undersell our men in the labor
market and drag them to a lower level.
I regard it as necessary, with this end
in view, to reenact immediately the law
excluding Chinese laborers and to
strengthen it wherever necessary in or
der to make its enforcement entirely ef
fective." He also recommends such legislation, by
an amendment to the interstate commerce
law, as will protect the labor of one state
from competing with the prison labor of
another state, and also that the govern
ment cease being a party to this competi
tion by not purchasing goods made either
by convict labor or that in which women
and children are caused to work excessive
hours or at night. ... f
He pronounces our present Immigration
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
he says "we need every honest and ef
ficient Immigrant fitted to become an
American citizen, every immigrant who
comes here to stay, who brings hire a
strong body, a good head and a resolute
purpose to dc his duty well in every way
and to bring up nls children as law-abiding,
God-fearing members of the community."
The Tariff.
The president does hot desire any change
in the present tariff schedule except where
such may be made in reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says: -
"Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our Industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
in the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those surplus products by giving us
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to our own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us. '
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the aupport once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach of successful
competition. '
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
"The president pronounces our merchant
marine "discreditable to .us as a nation and
Insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtop in other forms of business,"
and say we "should not longer submit to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce is carried in
our own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to build up our shipping In
terests, but it would also result in benefit
to all who are Interested in the perma
nent establishment of a wider market fot
American products ar.d would provide an
auxiliary force for the ravy.v Ships work
for their own countries just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
liner, If established to the principal coun
tries with which we have dealings, would
be of political as well as commercial ben
efit. From every standpoint it is unwise
for the United State to continue to rely
upon the ships of cotnpet'ng nations for the
distribution of ou. goods. It should be
made advantageous to carry American
goods in American built ships."
Finances.
Under this heading the president recom
mends such legislation as will better safe
guard against the deranging influences of
commercial crises and financial panics and
such as will make the currency of the
country more responsive to the demands
of domestic trade and commerce.
He points out the isct that the receipts
from duties on imports and internal taxes
exceed the exptitc'turos of the govern
ment, but counsels against reducing the
revenues ao that there will be the possi
bility of a deficit.
"But after providing against any such
contingency .T.eans should be adopted
which will bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs." .
Inter-state Commerce. .
He points to defects In the Interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct them, in which connection
he says:
"The act should be amended. The rail
way la a public servant. Its rates ahould
be Just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should see to It that
within Its jurisdiction this is so - and
should provide a speedy, inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time it must not , be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries through which
the- commercial lifeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
. . - hi. .'i. Avalnn.
unnecessarily interrere wim
ment and operation of these commercial
agencies." . - ;-; '': -'
.tKrloultaritl Interests.
ThA President cites the forest legislation
vUauly "e of Still greater value. Con-
vey and the Preparation of P orftne
onnKprvattve use with tne oureau 01 i"i
estrv which is also charged with the gen
eral advancement of practical forestry in
the'unUed".1. These various June
tions should be united in the bureau or
forestry, to which they properly belong.

the interests of both must unfr-h."!
scientific bureaus generally ilf J
under the department of agriculture. The
president should have by law the power
of transferring lands for use as forest re
serves to the department of agriculture.
He already has such power In the case 01
lands needed by the departments of war
and the navy." . , .
Irrigation.
Irrigation in connection with the waste
lands of the west is a question to which
the president gives considerable attention,
and makes strong recommendations lor
government assistance In reclaiming tne
waste lands by assisting in their irriga
tion and the control of water rights wher
ever that is possible, and of this he says:
"In the arid region it is water, not land,
which measures production. The western
half of the United States would sustain a
1 t- an,A- tvin that of nur Whole
JlUjlUldllUll , IttkLl Ll.ua. - -
country to-day if the waters that now run
to waste were saveo ana ueu im n.. ac
tion. The forest and water problems are
perhaps the most vital internal questions
of the United States. -
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save the flood waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished by the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
interstate problems are involved, and the
resources of single states would often be
Inadequate. It is properly a national
function, at least in some of its features.
It is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The
storing of the floods In reservoirs at the
headwaters of our rivers is but an en
largement of our- present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other

regulate the flow of streams the water
Bliouia oe turned ireeij im '""VJ-""""
In the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow. ,
"The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion ot
our country, Just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
perity to the Atlantic states. The in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate Industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia will consume the larger food sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chiefly In upbuilding local cen
ters of mining and other industries which
would otherwise not come into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaking is but another
name for the upbuilding of the nation.
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises that we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. He also
oltes the conditions under which the set
tlers of the west are attempting to build
homes on these arid lands, and says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendwed in ordinary suits at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
the arid states have failed to provide for
the certain and just division of streams in
times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws
have made it possible to establish rights
to water in excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"In the arid states the only right to water
which should be recognized is that of use.
In irrigation this right should attach to
the land reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom. Granting perpetual water
rights to other than users without
compensation to the public Is open to all
the bbjections which apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the public utili
ties of the cities. A few of the western
states have already recognized this and
have Incorporated in their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
of water."
,, The Colonies.
Considerable attention is given the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins by citing
the needs of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of large
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community ' of men
who themselves till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the islands should
be shaped with this end in view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
afford the true test of the healthy devel
opment of ths islands. The land policy
should as nearly as poasible.be modeled
on our homestead system."
Of Porto Rico he says the island is thriv
ing as never before, and is being adminis
tered efficiently and honestly.- He deems
no legislation necessary except that con
cerning the public lands of the island.
He calls attention to the fact that in
Cuba the Independent government of the
island will soon be in control, and in the
same connection urges strongly the need
of reciprocal trade relations with the new
nation, upon which subject he says:
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application, and I moet earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction in the- tariff duties on'
Cuban imports into the United States
Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand In Inter
national matters in closer and more friend
ly relations with us then with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures in the interest of
her material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends much
In the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste. He says: "We hoDe
to make our administration of the islands
honorable to our nation by making It of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves
and as an earnest of what we intend to do
we point to what we have done
Already a greater measure of materiel
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained in the
Philippines than ever before in their his
tory." He says we do not desire to do for the
Islanders "merely what has elsewhere been
done for tropic peoples by even the best
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
sny people of the tropics to make them
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the Idea of ths president is that We
cannot leave the Islands at this time, of
which he says: "To leave the islands at
this time would mean that they would
fall Into a welter of murderous anarchy
, BuLd along the lines un$er which we

The construction of a Pacific cable is
also urged, either that the government
fav such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippines, or that an arrangement
be maVby which the advantage ac
cruing from a government cable may be
secured to the government by contract
with a private cable company. This he
deems necessary for both commercial,
political and military considerations.
! The Isthmian Canal. ; '
He calls attention to the need of an
isthmian canal, and says:
"lS importance to the nation Is by no
means limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business Prosperity, and
yet with a view to these effects alone it
wVuld be to the last degree important
for us immediately to begin it. While Its
beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, it would
also greatly benefit other "ections.. It . is
emphatically a work which it is tor the
interest of the entire country to begin
and complete as soon as possible, It Is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with pros
pects of success and which when done
are not only permanent assets in the na
tion's material Interests, but standm
monuments to Its constructive
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with England he says: "I am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great Britain
conducted on both sides in a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted in my being able to
lay before the senate a treaty which if
ratified will enable us to begin preparations
for an isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked in connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated, " spe
cially provides that the United States
alone shall do the work of building and
assume the responsibility of safeguarding
the canal and shall regulate its neutral use
by all nations on terms of equality
without the guarantee or interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and If ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages It secures
us by providing for the building of ths
canal."
The Monroe Doctrine.
The president sets forth the objects ot
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in
which it has been received by other
countries, and in connection with It ss!ys
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
any of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith. He says also that "this
doctrine has nothing to do with the com
mercial relations of any American power
save that it in truth allows each of them
to form such as.it desires." That "we
do not ask for any exclusive commercial
treaty with any other American state."
He says of this: . .
"The Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy of
all the nations of the two Americas as
it Is of the United States. Just 78 years
have passed since President Monroe in
his annual message announced that 'the
American continents are henceforth not
to be considered aa subjects for future
colonization by any European power.' In
other words, the Monroe doctrine Is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-American
power at the expense of any ' Ameri
can power on American soli. It is in no
wise Intended as hostile to any nation in
the old world. Still less is It intended to
give cover to any aggression by one new
world power at the expense of any other.
It is simply a step, and a long step, to
ward assuring the universal peace of the
world by securing the possibility of per
manent peace on this hemisphere." ,
- The Navy. .
' The president urges the continued up
building of the navy aa a means of per
forming our International duties as well as
a protection and safeguard for our inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a first-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy In
keeping with our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being in any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly
trained navy Is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such a navy represents the very
lightest premium for Insuring peace which
this nation can possibly pay."
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men as absolutely necessary,
and says: -
"There should be no cessation in the
work of completing our navy. 60 far in
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It Is unsafe and unwise
not to provide this year for several addi
tional battleships and heavy armored
cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft
In proportion. For the exact number and
character I 'refer you to the report of the
secretary of the navy. But there Is some
thing we need even more than additional
ships, and this is additional officers and
men. To provide battleships and cruis
ers and then lay them up, with the ex
pectation of leaving them unmanned un
til they are needed in actual war, would
be worse than folly. It would be a crime
against the nation.
The Army.
No kicrease in the regular army Is
deemed necessary at this time, but there
are several changes In that branch of the
government service which the president
recommends to congress. Chief of these
ia the establishment of a staff department,
and of this he says:
"A general ataff should be created. As
for the general staff and supply depart
ments, they should be filled by details
from the line, the men so detailed return
ing after awhile to their line duties. It Is
very undesirable to have the senior grades
or the army composed of men who have
come to fill the positions by the mere fact
of seniority. A system ahould be adopted
by which there shall be an elimination
grade by grade of those who seem unfit
t?. jender the best service In the next
grade. Justice to the veterans of the

Is for the reduction of the "paper work''
