REFERENCE IN THE president's message to
the Japanese question is provoking bitter crit
icism among Californians. They do not take kind
ly to being called "wicked" because their board
of education has made an order prohibiting adult
Japanese from mingling with white children at
public schools. California republican congressmen
Bay, had the president's message been made public
before election day, the republicans would have
suffered great losses if not defeat. In behalf of
the San Francisco board of education, it is stated
that "many so-called Japanese children are men
from twenty to twenty-five years old, who have
no right to attend schools for boys and girls;" that
Americans of that age are not admitted to public
schools.
IN AN INTERVIEW given to a representative
of the Associated Press, Mr. Altman, president
of the San Francisco board of education, refer
ring particularly to the president's message, said:
"With all due deference to President Roosevelt,
I must say it Burprises me that with all the min
uteness of detail of information furnished to Vic
tor H. Metcalf, who came to San Francisco as
the special representative of the president in this
matter and who on his return to Washington
must have undoubtedly placed all of this informa
tion at the disposal of the chief executive of the
country, there should be such a display on the
part of President Roosevelt as to state in his
message that Japanese pupils are barred from the
public schools of this city. This would lead peo
ple outside of San Francisco to believe that we"
refused an education to the Japanese children.
Japanese children have not been excluded from
the schools of San Francisco. The impression
already gone forth that the Japanese were ex
cluded from our local institutions of learning
arises from the fact that a section of the school
law of the state of California providing for a
separate school for these children has been put
into force and effect. In other words, far from
barring the Japanese children from the public
schools of Sap. Francisco, the board of education
has merely said to them: 'Attend this particular
school and there find all the advantages and fa
cilities which are provided our own white
children.' "
BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER, of the University
of California, undertakes to smooth things
over in California, although declaring that in
most respects he agrees with President Roose-
velt. Mr. Wheeler says: "Cordial relations with
Japan, both commercially and otherwise, are of
prime importance to the Pacific coast, particularly
to San Francisco. The school question is really
in itself a small matter, at least in volume, for
only a small number of pupils is involved. Many,
if not most, of these are adults, and adults should
not be allowed in the lower schools, no matter
of what race. If it had been only children in
volved I can not think the question would have
been raised. The question that is disturbing us
as a people concerns the rapid immigration of
Japanese laborers, and this question you must
surely know is safe in the hands of the presi
dent, who is at once the well proven friend of
' Japan, and a thoroughgoing American in full sym
pathy with the needs and aspirations of the peo
ple of the Pacific coast. The immigration of
Japanese coolies will have to be restricted in the
interest of conditions here, in the interest of good
understanding between the two nations and ulti
mately, as we believe, Japan will see it in the
interest of Japan herself, but this is a delicate
ma.tter requiring delicate treatment. Japan is a
first rate power and whatever is done will have
to be done with her consent and co-operation. It
is best not to be disturbed about the president.
He understands our situation and when the clouds
roll by he will be found our best friend, too."
THOSE WHO TAKE the Japanese side of the
' question 'say that the Japanese are very
sensitive concerning their children and that their,
pride was wounded when Japanese children were
denied the public school privileges which .were
cheerfully conferred upon children of other na
tionalities. The United States district attorney at
San Francisco has boon instructed to assist the
attorney representing the Japaneso in the court
proceedings which will bo to compel the San
Francisco board of education to admit Japanoao
pupils. In behalf of tho Japaneso it Is pointed
out that our constitution provides: "This con
stitution and tho laws of tho United States which
shall bo mado in pursuance thereof, and nil
treaties made, or which shall be mado, under the
authority of the United States, shall bo the su
premo law of tho land, and tho judges in every
state shall be bound thereby, anything in tho
constitution or laws of any state to tho contrary
notwithstanding."
THE TREATY entered Into between the
United States and Japan in 1895 providos:
"In whatever relates to rights of residence and
travel; to the possession of goods and effects
of any kind; to the succession to personal estate,
by will and otherwise, and the disposal of prop
erty of any sort and in any mannor whatever
which they may lawfully acquire, the citizens or
subjects of each contracting party shall enjoy in
the territories of tho other the Bame privileges,
liberties and rights, and shall be subject to no
higher Imposts or charges in these respects than
native citizens or subjects or citizens or subjects
of the most favored nation."
SOME PEOPLE IN San Francisco were greatly
disturbed because of this paragraph In the
president's message: "Even as the law now is
something can be done by the federal government
toward this end, and in the matter now before
me affecting the Jhpanese, everything that it is
in my power to do will be done, and all of the
forces, military anil civil, of the United States
which I may lawfully employ will bo so employed."
Washington dispatches say that tho president has
assured members of the California delegation that
that did not mean that ho would use the mili
tary forces of the United States to force the
Japanese into the California schools. He meant
that he would use the military forces to protect
the Japanese against' mob violence.
JOHN HURLEY, OF Litchfield, Conn., a student
J of Gaelic Etymological history, declares that
Virgil and Shakespeare were both Irishmen. A
Winstead (Conn.) correspondent- for the New
York American quotes Mr. Hurley as saying:
"The same country that produced 'Erin-go Braugh'
was also responsible for the birth of Virgil and
Shakespeare. I have been delving into the de
viations of Shakespeare's name for more than a
quarter of a century. His mother, Mary Arden,
was unquestionably of Irish origin, for the name
of Arden had its beginning in the Emerald Isle.
Early in the fourteenth century a Lord Arden,
clearly traced as Shakespeare's mother's ances
tor, was a member of the Irish parliament." Hav
ing settled Shakespeare's origin Mr. Hurley proves
that the great Latin writer of epics was also an
Irishman, as follows: "The name of Virgil is un
doubtedly an Irish name. In fact his real name
was Fearghall, now shortened to Farrell, and we
only know him as Virgil because that is the
Latin synonym, of the Irish name. Farrell, or
Virgil, the Roman author, was connected with
one of the- greatest events known to history be
cause he was related to the Irish astronomer of
the same name who in the eighth century discov
ered that the earth is round. He was also a rela
tive of the Irish king, Fearghall and there is every
proof to show that his ancestors belonged to one
of the Irish settlements founded long before his
birth."
THE "POLITICAL propaganda" as advocated
by President Gompers, of the American
Federation of Labor, was overwhelmingly en
dorsed at the Minneapolis convention. For some
weeks prior to the convention a report was In
dustriously circulated that the Federation would
not endorse President Gompers' policy. When
the convention met It was evident that influences
were at work to prevent an endorsement, but
the feeling in favor of endorsement was soon
discovered to be very strong. That portion of
?fS n,pors ann,,nl rcnort baling with
the political idoa was llstenod to witli cIoh. n
tuition and was loudly applauded ImidHt sconeH
of great enthusiasm the committee MmK
report made rotum of its roco mmond "tIon S
swrs ism ;S
five hour, and was then adopted by ni a most
nanimous vote. The report was a foUows
"We recommend that tho action taken by The
officers of the American Federation of Labor dur
ins tho last campaign be Indorsed and wq QxnvQm
our approval of tho campaign carried on ngaE
the enemies of labor with tho small means at ho
tl?? 0f V10 'I1C0r8 of th0 Moiuon. Wo r
gard with pleasure the recent political action of
!!,? org!V1,zcd worklnginon gf tho country and by
which they are determined to exhibit their no
litical power. Wo are In full accord with and
recommend to organized labor throughout to
country that they persist In their effort! to ori
izo as an independent political force."
TWO YEARS AGO tho Nebraska legislature
X passed a new revenue law. For a long time
the railroads have contested a largo amount" of
their taxes In Nebraska. One clause in tho now
law authorizes tho impounding of rocolpts of tho
ra UrondH upon failuro to pay this amount. On
this clause action may bo taken on December 1.
It remained for a democratic treasurer to enforce
this law. C. E. Bowlby Is country treasurer of
Saline county, Neb., and son of C. J. Bowlby,
editor of the Crete (Neb.) Democrat, one of tho
best known of western newspaper men. On Do
comber 5 Treasurer J3owlby dornanded of four
Burlington railroad station agents the surrender
of the receipts of their offices, the same to bo
applied on tho railroad's taxes. Those demands
wore refused, whereupon Treasurer Bowlby filed
charges against the station agents. These agents
were arrested and applied for release by tho
habeas corpus. District Judge Hurd refused to
order the release and tho Issue will doubtless
be thoroughly tested In the courts.
