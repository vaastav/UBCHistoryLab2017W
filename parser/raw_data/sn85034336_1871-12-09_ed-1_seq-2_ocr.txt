The Death of Oscar J. Dunn-Its exta
Political EReet. ence
i The
At the very moment of writing modii
our recent letter from New Or- the ls
leans; and while speculating as he a
to the fhture political fortunes of to a
Lieut. Gov. Dunn, that distin- relie
guished representative of the in th
black race was closing his mor- Ame
tal career. To most of the pee- of 1
ple of the city the news of his whet
death was the first intimation offi
they had of his illness. There thor
appeared some.plausibility in the Dem
speculation which at once pre- nest
wailed, that Dnnn liad been poi- subji
soned, and the suspicion to that men
effect was -by no class so strongly urge
entertained as by the deceased's with
owni poltical followers. But the of tl
certificate of the attending phys- It
iahtns, (of whom there were tisaw
enough to physic a battalion,)
setting down the death of Mr. a qu
Dunn to the account of conges- our
tion, dissipated the suspicion in jorit
the minds of the more intelli
gent, though, perhaps, it still ex- intel
ists;in the minds of the negroes, gate
who are loth to realize that they and
could have lost their leader by theo
any other than by foul means. TI
The funeral was largely attended, fon
whites and blacks mingling their to:
grief and their tears. gag
ro agree.
ag there were some els
mourners who mingled their the
smiles and their rejoicings, too. on
Of course, it was strictly a po- otl
litical funeral, none but Republi- UI
cans participating. ed
What effect the death of the th
leader of the anti-Warmoth par- sha
ty will have, politically, has been me
and still is a matter of general bu
conjecture. It is conceded that to
it was a severe loss to that party, W
or faction, the extent of which, el
we are persuaded, its leaders of
have not fully realized. They th
must seek his successor, not ex
among the whites, but among b
the blacks, if they intend to re
tain their strength in the coun- pc
try. Who this Joshua is, is a on
puzzling problem, since there are as
no blacks in either wing who eO
have the influnence Dunn had, or ti
are so favorably circumstanced sa
every way as he was. We should oa
be pleased to help the Custom- TI
house people out of their dilem- th
nia, but fear their only reliance ha
now is the President, to keep it
them from disintegration. Pos- th
sibly, this is all sufficient. Let th
us hope so, at any rate. th
Another consideration of some to
moment connected with Mr. is
Dunn's death, some think, is the TI
increase in chances for the im- ye
peachment of Warmoth, now co
that he is no longer likely to be is
succeeded by a negro. We may Sc
as well confess at once that there sa
is no chance to convict the Go(v to
ernor before the Senate. In a lit
count of senatorial noses, the en
k- Governor's list includes about th
fifteen, five or six more than he
requires for acquittal. He is safe, Il
therefore, on conviction. But it hi
is probable that the move ot his 'Y
" opponents will be impeachment,
followed by suspension, to last he
during the remainder of his term. m
This will make the House the tc
actual judge of guilt or inno- pl
cence. How the members are
divided, we presume, no one
knows. Of one hundred and two jc
members, twenty-seven are Dem- ti
ocrats. With anything like an 1
even division among the Repub- et
licans, these twenty-seven hold P
the balance of power, and it hap- in
pens to be at this juncture a very fl:
grave and momentous responsi- et
bility. Let these Democrats take T
care they are not sold by either n
opposing faction, :and that they i
do not concentrate, by a false gi
step, all tihe power and cunlning e
of our foes. J

Important Decisions.
A Two highly important deci- Th

i The first decision was rendered with
in a suit to set aside the will of frien
Daniel Clark which made Mrs. tlemi
a Gaines his universal legatee and by I
I which was recognized as valid by may
a the U. S. Supreme Court. Judge ized
a Collens in a lengthy and well- mear
a written opinion decided that Mrs. indu
D Gaines is the illegitimate child of are I
Clark, by Zulimne Carriere; that broa
t, will, which was lostordone away Mini

recognized her as legitimate or inter
n have made her his universal leg- iarli
e atee and that all that could have ity i
been legally bequeathed to her ent
g was the portion of an illegiti- of C
i. mate child. Itali
i- The second decision of tihe two in,
t- alluded to, was given in the case Beft
d of the Mississippi Navigation Duk
ir Company vs. the Governor. We rece:
'e learn from the Bee that the ob- to 1

the the reason that the subscription
would be " violation of the con- I
he stitutioril restriction of the debt to

ce, Judge Emerson decided that the his

The President states that the tat,
relations of the United States
with foreign powers continuesstl
F friendly. He refers to the set- tle(
tlement of the Alabama dispute sis,
by the treaty of Washington, sell
and says the example thus set spo
may be followed by other civil- pro
ized nations, and finally be thel
Smeans of returning to productive -
industry millions of men who
f are now retained to settle a Na- N
tional dispute by bayonet and
broadside. He commends the
 Minister and Consulate at France ,
e for his course in protecting the rit
r interests of German subjects in"'"
Paris during the late war. Ile
informs Congress that in conform- '
O ity with the esteblished preced
r ent he has recognized the change
- of Government in Rome and the m
Italian States, and speaks of con- ;,
tinuned friendly relations between Isip
Russia and the United Statcs. ,
o Refers to the visit of the Grand .
La Duke Alexis and the hospitable ji'
o reception given him ; in relation `
to Minister Catacazy, the Presi
dent says that the inexcusable B1
course of the Russian Minister
had rendered it necessary for the
President to ask the Minister's F
recall, and decline to receive that
functionary any longer. IIe says.-'_

four in China, and he gives the
tat history of the difficulty in China,

his affairs he says that he instructed
a the American naval conmmander
ar- in Cuban waters to protect tie
or- lives and liberty of all bona fide ,
ro- citizens of the United States and
tat maintain the dignity of our flag,
ek- and expresses the hope that all
in pending questions between lhe I
in- United States and Cuba, may be E
,er, adjusted in that spirit of peace
tc- and conciliation which has here
tofore guided both powers. lie 4
a recommends Congress to take
lm- measures to support the lines of
ore steamships between San Francis
co and China and San Francisco
ive and Japan : also to take steps to t
ass bring about a speedy return to
the specie payment, and also to unite
the telegraph system with the
eet postal system of the United
States. Hie defends the policy
pursued in reference to the stop
page of the Ku-Klux outrages,
expresses the belief that out of
the numerous arrests nlade ino
innocent person is now under ar- 1
rest. In regard to Polygrainy in
Utah, he relates the action of the
Federal Courts and authorities
there, and says that the nMormons
will not be permitted to violate
the laws under the cloak of reli
re- gion, but suggests whether the
eial children already born under the
n i1 Mormon system should not be
uth legitimate. lie recommends ablol
had ition of all the Internal Revenue
