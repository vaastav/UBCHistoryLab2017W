THE SEWS.
Congress was Mty organized yesterday
and at noon to-day will receive the Presi
dent’s Message. The opposition are appa
rently thoroughly demoralized and with
out a leader, and, hclcful, and hating ona
another, they hare only managed hy their
course thus for, in roasting the current of
events, to show their own malice and
weakness. The people may look for speedy
attention to important public measures
connected with this war, which will not
his time, wc trust, he postponed until the
heel of the session.
The great Gauds in various departments
of public business will, we hope, be exposed
with an unsparing hand, and the knife and
cautery be freely used. Let a terror tail
upon the bloodsuckers that have fastened
upon the nation ,to gorge themselves in a
season of public trial like this. A Covodc
'investigation should reach and parity all
these un&agnmt spots, and make an exam
ple of all guilty parties.
By all means,dear out the useless Major
■Generals and Brigadier Generals, and those
pretty gentlemen, their staff officers. The
■condemned corral of army officers is a
xnost expenrive institution, and cannot too
soon be emptied. If Little Mac and his
fidlpws arc worth anything in shoulder
straps, set them at work,or else restore them
to civil life. It will save a heavy drain on
the public treasury, and open the path for
better men to rise. Let the work begin.
Ben. Butler again strikes a toy note. The
blacks most be used. The war has need
of all of them, and Gen. Butler nrges that
black and white should bo paid alike. So
say the people. And let Congress give
such end to legislation on this point.
"Wanted, men to kill rebels. Complexion
■of applicants no object No distinctions
in pay.
The Cliief Quartermaster at SL Louis de
serves the thanks ofloyal men. He grasp,
cd and strangled a knot of knavish con
tractors, put the hay market under military
law, secured the Government from rohhety
and good prices to the producers tbe while
lie brought a soulless gong of knaves to hit
ter grief. Head onr St, Louis dispatch.
A very numerous delegation from onr
regiments in the Held has come home to
offer to able bodied men exemption from
the draft. There is rro better nor more
honorable way to avoid conscription than
to face if, musketin hand, and on your
cap the battle-honored number of one of
our gallant Illinois regiments. That is how
to htngh at the Provost Marshal and
men.
Gold bad on uneasy day of it yesterday
fluctuating among tbe fractions, starring at
49, falling off once, and again, recovering,
and again receding, at last showing on ad
vance of half a cent on the first above
flamed rate.
•.The S3OO clause will doubtless be re
pealed, and with the amendment, Congress
should secure others, looking to a classifi
cation of citizens, a discrimination in favor
of men of family, the admission of blacks
to full pay and light to serve as substitutes.
Tbe people hare outlived squeamishness.
They wish the war finished up. They
care not whether black aims or white push
-home the bayonets. Let aH bimezs of
prejudice be removed- Let us have an ar
my as the result of this dratij whose full
jutmbers will strike mortal terror through
the lean Confederacy and whose force will
~be irresistible to sweep rebellion from the
land.
The Richmond papers, ns evidenced else
where, are in deep depression and* will not
Be comforted. Their doleful damps are all
the worse in'being well based, with darker
.days to come.
The Army of the Potomac is doubtless
to have a new deader, bat no announce
ments hare been made. If loyalty was all
that was needed, Meade is not to be sur
passed- It confidence of people and army
were all, then McClellan would have need
ed no successor. ‘What is demanded and
waited for in a leader of the Potomac
Army, is euccess, and the qualities that go
to make it, are as rare as the task is grave,
land the reward shining.'
General Brajnum.
A. few days onr dispatches announced
the arrest of Brig. Gen. Mason Brayman of
tiii« State, in command at Comp Chase, Co
lumbus, Ohio. No explanations were given,
but the many friends of this excellent officer
have in Ms behalf confidently awaited some
further details. The following letter from
Gen, Brayman sets the whole matter at rest
and relieves Mm of a charge that would be
grave were it not ridiculous:

Mv experience In early life, oe a journalist, sug
gest* the many ways in which erroneous etato
xnenta find their way into the newspapers. Of
Jhia character are the paragraphs found in the
papers of the past few days, announcing me
as haviuabcco under arrest, removed from my
command, ordered to report to a court-mar
i«l. A c.
one paper kindly attributes the charges against
me to ‘‘personal controversy.’’ My military life
has thus far been wholly free—ls now free, and
will, I trust, remain free from personal controver
sies. In the wav of official duty, 1 have a contro
versy with rebels and their sympathizers cvery-
On assuming command at this post, I found se
rious complaints existing against persons In hos-
SUal employment, for disloyalty, theft and other
1 Borders. "I undertook to secure an investigation
and a remedy. „ , .
The very trifling charges preferred against me,
arc recognized as -one of the ways adopted to de

I was kindly furnished a copy of these charges;
but was not arrested, removed from command,
ordered to report, nor asked to explain. On
making inquiry. I was advised that a court,
had been called, dissolved, and all papers or
dered to Washington. That Is all. The effort
to defeat investigation proves its necessity.

be misled, I respectfully request the loyal papers
to publish *ht* note. M. BnaratAX,

FROM THE SOUTH.
New Tore, Dee. B.—The Richmond Whig
of the 3d lost., titika in the following plain
fahsion
With no other motive or thought than
lo advance the public interest, we would
tignin suggest to the President the advantage
of reconstructing his Cabinet, and calling to
his aid the very ablcstintcllecU of the coun
try. Wc have a department of state that
has not able for nearly three years to
establish anyTclations with any other State.
A Treasury Department that has failed to
keep Us finances from running .to ruin. A
War Department in the hand of a chief whose
studies and course of life has been purely
and peculiarly civic. A Navy Department
without a navy. A Post Office Department,
with a very shocking system of mails. A
Department of Justice vacant The business
of each department separately shows the
wont of a more master! v hand, and the pow
ers of their chiefs in Cabinet councils, if
councils arc ever held, fail to supply the
quantum of wisdom the country needs.
We are getting in too deep waters, and a
feeling of dread Is shaking the souls of the
people. There is nothing the President can
do unit will so reanimate their hearts and
eliminate their confidence in affection for
him ns the calling to his side as his daily ad
visers, a cabinet of the wisest, truest and
most experienced men in the country, re
gardless of what may have been their former
political associations.
• The time Is propitious. The occasion ur
gent, and the people anxiously expectant, and
for his own continuing complicity for useful
ness and future fame, us well as on account
•of the sorely ncceaslUouß and exigent condi
tion of the country, we earnestly press this
recommendation.

Some months since a colored man came
from Missouri to Indianola, Warren county.
About two weeks ago he; employed two
white men to take their teams and go with
Mm to remove his family to Indianola. On
their way back with Ms family,-when within
ten miles of the lowa State line, and camped
for the night, they were attacked by a party
of about fifteen pro-slavery radians. The
colored man escaped to the brush, bearing
one of the ruffians say to Ms companions,
“Damn yon, yon won’t ran off any more,*
and simultaneously three pistol shots were
fired. The colored man returned home and
told the story, and a detachment of home
guards left Indianola yesterday for the bor
der to investigate the mutter.
Great excitement prevails at Indianola, the
belief prevailing that the white men were
murdered and the colored family taken back
into slavery.

Several days ago the Secretary of tbc Union

dressed a remonstrance to Gen. Allen, chief
Quartermaster .of the West, against the
threatened slrnrc of hay, unless the Govern
ment was freely supplied by dealers at $33.00
per ton.
The response of Gen. Allen is a scathing
exposure of the combination of speculators,
who endeavored to swindle the producers
and impose on the Government, by running
np the price fifty per cent, in less than a
fortnight
The General says that he did not contem
plate forcible impressment, but that the
order Los nevertheless worked well in bring

the OMo River and elsewhere, offered to Mm
at the price fixed by the advertisement He

cast-off Clerk (Etheridge) tbeln candidate,
but some of their number refused to vote
for him; while, for other offices, they could
not unite their strength on any one candi
date. They tried the game of nominating

his former friends to vote for him, and so run.

REPORT OP THE SECRET ART OP THE If AW.
This report embraces 30 pages, and begins
with the blockade. The extent of the block
aded coast is 3,549 miles, with 189 harbor
mid river openings, and much of the coast
presents a double shore to be guarded. In
addition to the blockading fleet, more than
one hundred vessels have been employed in
patrolling the rivers. The distance patrolled
on the Mississippi and its tributaries
is 5,G55 miles. On the Gulf and the Atlantic,
2,000 miles of sounds, rivers and inlets, have
also been penetrated and watched with un
ceasing vigilance.
The blockade is becoming more effective
and complete. There has been progress in
repelling the rebels from the coast. The un
principled traders who successfully violated
law and public morality in illicit traffic with
the rebels during the early part of the war,
have found their operations daring the past
year most disastrous.
Admiral Leo continues to command the
North Atlantic Squadron. ThcMghest enco
miums are passed on the naval officers as men
of sleepless vigilance and bravery. It is not
known that any vessels elude the vigilance of
the South Atlantic Squadron,
More than a year ago operations were com
menced with a view of interdicting all traffic,
and if possible of capturing Charleston itself;
but by reason of delays and difficulties in
lilting out the iron-clad fleet, a demonstra
tion was not made till the the 7th of April.
A Mstory of the operations before Charleston
is then given.
The Secretary then alludes to the conflict
that took place in Warsaw Sound, between
the Wcchawkcn and the Atlanta, and con
dudes that tMs remarkable result was on ad
ditional testimony in favor of the monitor
class of vessels for harbor defense and coast
service, against any navy vessels that have
been or are likely to be constructed to visit
onr shores.
It appears to have extinguished whatever
lingering hopes the rebels may have had of
withstanding our naval power by naval
weapons. . ' *
‘ Admiral Bailey continues to command the
Eastern Gulf squadron. Then follows a his
tory of the Southern Gulf squadron under
Admiral Farragnt. Had a land force been in
readiness to co-operate with the fleet Vicks
burg could have been captured alter the oc
cupation of New Orleans. The blockade of
the Gnlfis satisfactory, and recently the reb
el traffic through Matamoras has become in
significant slice the capture of Browns
ville.
Admiral Portci', in command of the Missis
sippi squadron, is complimented as an officer
of great energy and extraordinary vigor. It’
is but a little over two years since wo. had
not a naval vessel on all the Western
waters. . Now we. have a hundred
vessels carrying 463 guns and 5,500 men.

New Yobe, Dec. B.—-The New York
Tribune's 'Washington special says: Although
the President’s Message is ready, it is proba
ble that it will not be sent to Congress be
fore 'Wednesday, as there is considerable
doubt whether the Honse will be ready to
receive it before two or three o’clock to
toOlxow, by ‘which time the very,
likely have adjourned. The most Important
and interesting portions of the Message, are
those which deal with the subject of slavery
and the restoration to the Union of States
that have been in rebellion. In what the
President says regarding the former topic,
he considers the Emancipation Proclamation
as an accomplished tact: He holds that the
Proclamation has liberated all the slaves
within the territory which it embraces, and
all futnre action must be based upon that
supposition. In a word the President docs
not and will not adopt the policy which fails
to give a slave a vested right in himself.
The plan Mr. Lincoln proposes for the
restoration of the loyal people of truant
States to their former position in the
Union, Is represented to be purely his own,.
and unlike anj now before the public. Not
confining himself to general outlines, he en
ters with some minuteness into details. In
nnotber part of the Message the President
alludes to the victories gained daring the
Jear over the rebels, and dwells at some
ength upon the progress and present aspect
and prospects of the war.
'“The bill creating the office of Lientenant
General, of which notice was given to-day
by Mr. Washbnrnc, of HI., is intended to
give Gen. Grant the position to which his
talents and his victories arc generally thought
to entitle him.”-
The Washington special of the New York
■ Tines says: Chase’s report will
be transmitted by special messenger to the
Northern press to-morrow. He adopts all
the recommendations of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue in regard to whisky
and tobacco, and suggests the propriety of a
still further increase of the tax on those arti
cles, in order that the revenue may be in
creased, as it has fallen considerably below
the estimates of the framers of the law. The
receipts from this source for the last year
will fall short of $60,000,000.

air. POWELL of Kentucky thought
that the whole question depended
on the fact whether the Legislature
of Missouri hod really adjourned sine
t/i>, or only took a recess before coming to
gether lately and electing a Senator.
If the Legislature of Missouri adjourned
without electing a Senator, the appointment
of the Government held good until the pro
per assembly of the Legislature and election
by that body. It had been said, however,
that the Legislature only took a recess. Ho
would therefore like to have the Judiciary
Committee Inquire into the facta.
Mr. TRUMBULL of Illinois moved to amend
the resolution by declaring Wilson was not
entitled to a seat in the Senate.
Mr. WILSON, of Moss., gave notice of a
bill to Increase the bounty lor volunteering,
and to make an appropriation for the same.
The amendment of TRUMBULL was agreed
