Fress.
Berlin, Pec. 12.—The treaties of com
merce are now practically passed in prin
ciple and detail by almost the unanimous
voice of the Reichstag. The minority,
drawn from Ultra-Conservatives and mem
bers of the Keichspnrtel who opposed the
proposed measures, found themselves too
feeble either to divide on the first reading
or to try to cause delay by referring the
treaties to the committee. Chancellor yon-
Caprivi caused it to become known that he
would brook no dallying in committee, and
that the details of the treaties would in no
way be modified. In language of complacent
acceptance Ilerr Singer (Socialist), Prince
yon Uatzfeldt and Baron Manteuffel (Con
servatives). Ilerr Oeehetluuser (National
Liberal), Ilerr ltickert (Freisinnige), Ilerr
Oerterer (Centrist) and Ilerr Decken
(Guelph) supported tho treaties. The Chan
cellor dwelt upon the necessity of passing
the treaties before Christmas. The results
of their operations, he declared, would soon
show that no preference had been given to
other industries over that of the agricultur
ist, lie with great difficulty kept the corn
duties as high as three and a half marks.
Be concluded his address by announcing
that the Government, in the view of meet
ing the dearth of labor in the rural districts,
was preparing amendments to the laws re
a'.inc to the maintenance and housing of
rural laborers. Upon conclusion of the
Chancellor's speech the Reichstag decided
to take a second reading of the treaties in
the full sitting of the liouse.
EFFECT ON THE BOURSE. .
On the Bourse the opinion is general that
the conventions will have little effect upou
the general"aspect of business for a long
time to come. Tlie term .Z dlverein as ap
plied to the treaties is consldeiel a mis
nomer. Each of the five States contracting,
while making some concessions, retains a
string of heavy duties against the others.
The value of the measures cau only be
shown by time. The new tariffs when an
nounced hardly caused a momentary throb
on the Bourse. In Vienna, however, the
prospect of an increase in various traffics
under the new tariffs led to a large buying
of railroad securities aud gave a general
Impetus to business, ln the course of a re
cent interview with the editor of the Lu
be<k Eisenbahn-Zeitung Prince Bismarck
accused the Government of hurrying the
treaties. The Prince would not tike a part
in the debates because the members of the
R-n'chstsg had not been given sufficient time
to study the proposals. Referring to the
inscription, "SupreniaLex Itegis Voluntas,"
Ei;Kied in the golden hook of Munich Dy
uiperor William and to otlier recent auto
cratic utterances of his Majesty, Bismarck
said lie had never been a supporter of abso
lutism and lie regretted that the Emperor
bad made such expressions.
TESTING AMERICAN TORK.
Agrarian pa: ers continue their endeavors
to keep up the fiction that American pork is
diseased. Dr. Brmekbuseh, a noted scien
tist, has made public the results of hi-, exam
ination of three thousand specimens of
American pork. He louud traces of trichi-
Etc iv about 2;,0 per cent of the specimens
which passed through his hands. He ex
perimented with cats aud dogs, trying to
infect them by feeding them with the dis
eased meats, but failed entirely. This the
doctor considers positive proof that thichinte
survive but a short time after the death of
the infected animal. He holds that Ameri
can oorst, even'of a poor quality, Is per
fectly harmless when it has reached Ger
many.
The German textile exhibits for the
World's Fair promise to be extensive. The
Iron and steel manufacturers and the jew
elry, toy and china firms are making great
F reparations. The Deutsche Bank and the
nternationale Bank fur Deutschland will
support the project for the erection, be
tween Jackson aud Washington parks. of a
medieval German village.
A noted aristocrat. Prince Ysenburg, has
gone to the bad. He dissipated a large for
tune, contracted heavy debts and then tied
the country.

RUSSIA'S DISCONTENT.
An Uneasy State of Affairs in the Czar's Do
main.
London, Dec. 12.— The Chronicle's St.
Petersburg correspondent says: Matters
here are drifting from bad to worse. The
whole energy of the Department of Finance
seems centered In manipulating the funds
on the Berlin and Paris exchanges. Despite
the reports of gold Imports the Imperial
Bank return does not show an increase.
There is nothing to show whether the gold
is locked in the war chest or what became of
it. All classes are discouraged because of
tbe half-heartedness of the measures taken
by the Government to cope with the famine
difficulties. The consequences of the am
ine are only beginning to be realized. Mer
chants complain that the prohibition of
grain exports locked up capital and there is
no circulation of money; the nobles are un
able to collect their revenue and therefore
decline to pay what they owe the shop-keep
ers; the cessation of couit festivities causes
distress to small tradesmen ; the famine
funds are frittered away by local authori
ties; grand remedial measures exist only on
paper; complaints of enormous expendi
tures on the army and navy are taken ad
vantage of by those unfriendly to the Gov
ernment, and the whole empire appears to
he a seething mass of discontent.
THE ST. JOHN . DIVORCE CASE 1
lie Plaintiff and Her Friends Deny Her
Hatband's Charges.
London, Dec. 12.—1n the bt. John divorce
ease to-day Mies St. John was called In re
buttal. She denied the story of ber Inti
macy with Cohen, the corespondent. After
also denying the testimony of her maid and
the theatrical-dresser, given yesterday, Miss
St. John admitted she had driven, dined,
supped and gone to balls and parties with
Cohen, but she did Dot like him any more
than she did other people. She did not
think Cohen loved her, although he greatly
admired her. Miss Samuels, Cohen's sister,
said she never saw anything improper In
the conduct of her brother and Miss St.
John. Others gave similar testiinonv.
The deposition by a Mr. Mayer,"a New
York theatrical manager, was read. lie
slated that lie engaged Miss St. John for
her American tour. Arrangements for her
tour had been made with Marius. The lat
ter never complained to the deponent of his
wife's conduct. The deponent said he bad
seen Miss St. John and Cohen together four
times. Site always behaved as a lady should
to a gentleman. It was the custom for lead
ing actresses to receive their friends in their
dressing-rooms. The court then adjourned.

In Carlton House Terrace to | Mrs. Charles
Yates who gave a private concert at high
society prices to celebrate her recovery from

I did nd even take the trouble to contradict

CHILEAN BRUTALITY.
Additional Stories of the Cruel Treat
■
ment of American Seamen.
New York, Dec. 12.—The special corre
spondence of the Associated Pres? from
Valparaiso, under date of November 12th,
tells of the continued ill-treatment of
Americans, of the refusal of the lntendente
of that city to promise police protection to
the market boats of the Baltimore, necessi
tating the provisions being scut out by
private boats to the cruiser. At the date
of the letter there was living on the Balti
more a Doctor Stanley (a British subject),
who had been a resident of Chile a number
of years. He was a witness to the attack
upon Turnbull, the Baltimore sailor, who
received twenty knife-wounds in the affray
last month, and afterward died. Dr.
Stanley defended the man as well as he
could, and afterward took him to the hospi
tal and cared for him. It was kuown that
his testimony would be damaging, and a few
days later he was assaulted and arrested.
Efforts were made to pievent his testimony
being taken, but when he was released from
prison he went aooard the Baltimore for
protection. A number of the crew of the
Baltimore subscribed nearly SSOO in gold
and purchased a monument, suitably in
scribed, to place over the graves of Biggins
and Turnbull.
ANOTHER CASE OF CRUELTY.
Another case of cruelty to an American
seaman has attracted attention. The Ameri
can steamer Keweeuaw, from New York
for Sau Fraucisco, stunned at Valparaiso
for repairs in October. One nf her crew,
Patrick Shields, was arrested for drunken
ness. The man admitted that be was
drunk, but says he was given no hearing at
all and was refused permission to communi
cate with bis captain on the vessel or with
the United States Consul. He was kept at
work cleaning iho street fur more than a
week and was brutally beaten by tho police.
When released he was scarcely able to
walk, his back and aims being a mass of
bruises, and according to the statement of
the surgeon who attended him lie received
internal injuries which will prevent him
working fur several mouths. Consul Mc-
Creery took the man to the lntendente to
show the latter his injuries, but the In
teudente declined to look at him, though he
promised to Investigate the ma ter. No con
clusion had been reached in the case up to
the date of the letter.
IIATTA'S MANIFESTO.
The Herald's Valparaiso cablegram says:
The circular letter prepared by Minister of
Foreign Affairs Malta for distribution
among the Chileau legations of Europe and
America gives Chile's side of the
difficulty with the United States, grow
ing out of the Baltimore outrage.
lie say-: "With reference to the report of
the Secretary of the Navy and the message
of the President of the United States, I
think it opportune to say that the Informa
tion upon which the report and message is
grounded is erroneous or deliberately incor
rect. So far as the refugees are concerned,
they never have been threatened with
cruelty, nor has any one attempted to take
them from the legation, nor has their de
livery beeu ordered; nor has the house or
person of a foreign Minister be. molested
iv spite of the dallying and intentional
provocation. This is proven by eleven
notes of September, October and November.
Concerning the sailors of tire lialtimore
there is want of exactness and frankne-s
in the statements made in Washington.
The affray took place in the had quarter
of the city, the 'Maintop of Valparaiso.'
and among people by no means models.
When the police and the other forces inter
fered and calmed down the tumult there
had already been several hundred
men engaged, and it had spread to
a distance of ten blocks or mire lroui the
place where it commenced. Mr. Kgau pur
posely communicated to us a note in i.^iires
sive and violent language on October 2tJth,
as shown by a copy and a note, which
were answered October 27th. October 18th
began the summing up, which was suspended
on account of the non-appearance of the
crew of the Baltimore and on account of
the illegal! pretenses and denials of Egan.
There has never been any provocation com
menced or accepted by this department,
ami it has always maintained an attitude of
firmness and prudence."
A CHILEAN" DEFENSE.
"It never bad an aggressive policy, and
will never approve of a humiliating one.
Notwithstanding the fact that interested
parties may try to make their conduct ap
pear honest and try to dodge the issue by
erroneous accounts, whatever may he said
or may have been said in Washington, the
telegrams, notes and papers sent you contain
the truth, and the whole truth, about what has
happened in regard to this affair, and the
111-will and subsequent conferences and pre
tensions have not proceeded from this de
partment. Mr.Tracy and Mr. Harrison have
been led intoerrnrconcerning our people and
Government. Their instructions of impar
tiality and amity have not yet been complied
with. They are not now, nor have they
been before, and if no complaints have been
made again-t the Minister and sailors it is
because the public and notorious facts in
Chile and thn United States could never
have been made use of by our confidential
agent", even when well established.
Balmaeeda's demands and concessions
were made in June and July. The
whole Itata affair, the San Francisco
in Quintero Bay and the matter of the
cable company are proofs of it. It has
been purposely misstated tint the North
American sailors were attacked in various
localities at the same time. No final sum
ming up having been concluded, it remains
unknown who and how many are the guilty
parties. Your Excellency should uamo the
note of November Oth, In answer
to Minister Egan, as well as the other note
asking for evidence which he did not like to
give, although he said he had proofs to show
the murderers and the other guilty parties
of October lGtb, and also the other notes.
Your Excellency should have them trans
lated and published. In the meantime
please deny all that appears to the contrary.
We are sure of your punctuality as we are of
the right and propriety of Chile's acts and
nf the final result, in spite of intrigues that
descend so low and threats that come from
so high in this contingency.
AN EXPLANATION DEMANDED.
Senator Gondarillas asked last night for
an explanation from Malta of his letters to
the American Government, referred to by
President Harrison in his message as in
sulting.
In reply, Matta replied that there was not
the least truth in the characterization.. lie
never penned an Insulting reply to the
United States Administration. On tho other
hand Kuan's tellers to the Chilean Foreign
Office were Insulting to a marked degree.
Matta then went on to maintain the truth
of data contained in the circular letter to
the Chilean Legations in Europe and
America. Ile add- d, with vehemence,
that Chile would act in every way
with strict justice, and scored Egan
and Consul McCreery for alleged withhold
ing of evidence necessary to arrive at a clear
understanding of the merits of the Balti
more case, lie said nothing would prevent
Chile from fully investigating the affair and
panishing those found guilty in accordance
with the laws of tne hind.
Ilerr Gutschmidt, the German Minister,
Is doing all in his power to stir up ill-feel
ing against the Uulted States Government.
It is said that he promised the
Chilean administration the support of Iho
German fleet in the event of war between
Chile and the United States. The entire
correspondence between the United States
and Chile on the political refugee and Balti
more outrage questions is published to-day
in'the official organ,

■reels) to Tin Morsimo Cam,
Denver, Dec. 12.— strike of the
miners at the mines of the Colorado Coal
and Iron Company at Crested Butte has re
sulted seriously. Since the men— ltalians
and Austrian*— been out they have
been very ugly, refusing to allow the com
pany to bring ln new men. They stopped
the pumps and fans, allowing the mines to
fill with gas until there Is danger of the
mines blowing up, and have paraded tho
streets heavily armed, threatening death
to any oue attempting to assist the com
pany.
Yesterday Sheriff Shares of Gunnison ar
rived with a posse of twenty-five meu to
take possession and guard the mines. No
sooner had the Sheriff and men alighted
from the train than they were attacked by
200 armed Italians and Austrians, who be
gan firing with Winchesters. The officers
held their men for a moment, and then or
dered them to return the fire, which they
did, with deadly effect, killing Mike Copui
cine, Mike Minnelon, Mike Quercio, Mike
Warn and John Poche, all Italians. George
Simonioi and Grahake, Austrian?, wero
fatally wounded.
After the firing the miners retreated and
the posse took possession of the mines and
threw up redoubts. The miners swear venge
ance upon every friend of the coal com
pany and the town is upon the verge of a
riot. Further trouble was feared to-night.
The Governor has called out the State
militia, and the troops are now at their
armory ready to start for the scene by spe

DR. HAVES' TRIAD.
Medical Experts Examined as to the Cause of
Mrs. Barnaby's Death.
Denver, Dec. 12.—Most of to-day's ses
sion of the Graves trial was occupied by
testimony of various medical men connected
with the case as to what caused Mrs. Bar
naby's death, the effects of arsenical poison
ing, etc. Dr. Buckman, who performed the
autopsy, thought the primary cause of death
was arsenical poisoning, the immediate
cause being congestion of the lungs. To
gether with Dr. Grant ht said he yesterday
examined Mis. Worrell. They found the
muscles of her feet very much degenerated.
no sensation in portions of her feet ami in
tl urination of the toes of one foot. Inflam
mation ol the nerves was a direct cause of
those symptoms, and only three things
brought this about—arsenic, alcohol or
syphilis. In his judgment this condition of
Mrs. Worrell was caused by arsenical
poisoning.
K. B. Carrier, a brother-in-law, and sten
ographer to Worrell, testified to his getting
a package out of the Postoffiee and taking
it to Worrell's office, where, three or four
days later, he opened it for Mrs. Barnuby.
Worrell said he would carry It home for her,
aud the next day after Mrs. Barnaby had
been taken ill. The witness was requested
to bunt up the wrapper and stamp, which
had been thrown in the office waste-basket.
The defense endeavored- to prove that the
stamps saved by Worrell were those taken
off one of the packages whicl) Dr. Graves
did send inste.id of from the one containing
the poi-on. An adjournment was taken
while this point was being argued.

tnat in the near future British Columbia
will have a fast line of mail steamers to
Australia, touching nt Honolulu. Every

Blame's Influence on American
||| Policy.
Lack of Intelligence of London Journals.
Xy False Reports From Chile—The
l-y Royal Betrothal.
Special to Thk Moeniso c-At.r,«. .
New York. Dec. 12.—The Tribune's
special correspondent in Loudon cabled to
day as follows: President Harrison's dis
cussion of foreign affairs in his message
brings home to the Briton more forcibly
than ever the "wickedness" of Blame.
The United States, he sorrowfully exclaims,
never used to have any foreign affairs, but
for the last three years that Blame has been
Secretary of Slate it is his "fidgety activ
ity" which has created them all. Of course
It Is Blame who murdered the Chief of Po
lice at New Orleans, and then murdered his
murderers aud then wrote all the Italian
dispatches on the subject. He was at the
bottom of tbe revolution in Chile. He sent
Egan there when that country was con
vulsed by civil war. This last is what a
Tory organ seriously asserts. Ho perse
cutes the Jews in Russia and then remon
strates against the persecution and snubs
; himself for meddling in matters which do
not concern him. He Is egging on the Ven
ezuela quarrel with Great Britain. All
these and other offenses he commits, not, as
you might suppose, from pure cussedness
and because his name is Blame; it is be
cause "he came in on the crest of the Irish
vote" and his policy is an expression of
"the thraildom of the Republican party to
the Irish bosses." Such is the degree of in
telligence with which one of the three ablest
papers in England discusses American af
fairs; such the depth of its knowledge of
American politics. -s *
CONCERNING CHILEAN AFFAIRS.
The passage in the President's message
relating to Chile has the advantage of ap
pearing side by side with a dispatch from
the Santiago correspondent of the Times,
who renews his attack' on the American
Minister and accuses him of writing insult
ing notes in Santiago, apparently to the
Chilean Government, and of sending inac
curate-telegrams to Washington. He fol
lows this next day with the prediction that
the President's message will produce a pain
ful impression in Chile, and the statement
that the American colony In Valparaiso are
highly Indignant at the action of the United
, States representative, which they declare is
I based on interested personal motives, such
as "gambling on the exchange." He adds
that if the whole truth were known
a message of apology from President
Harrison would be necessary. In the
meantime his own ; apology for sending
and that of the Times for publishing such a
stream of libels on America and Ameri
cans ate still unaccountably delayed. If
the gentleman wants to get up a war be
tween Chile and the United Stales the value
•t his friendship for the Chileans is open to
uuht. He and even some of his more sober
colleagues on the English press seem to
' orok i ,at Chile ts men- a match
i f„ii her .fellow-republic In North America.
Til «-.4 the opinion of a lay amateur. The
hlghe-s,, or almost the highest, naval au
thority iv this country, who knows the
forces of both countries, has expressed his
belief that the Baltimore and Charleston
would knock the whole Chilean navy into
"a cocked hat" in half an hour.
THE ROYAL BETROTHAL. •_--.•'-'
The betrothal of Prince Eddie to Princess
May (I give Hum the names by which they
are commonly called) is on the "whole popu
lar. hat is said of it in the press is more
or less conventional and some of the rapt
ures are in too high a key, but monarchy is
still a great force in this country and seri
ous people feel that it will be sc, and think
it no light matter when the future heir to
the throne chooses a partner who will share
it with him. To be the King and Queen of
England is a great destiny. If Prince Eddie
has not yet become a great figure lv public
life, it is partly because bis father continues
to discharge with efficiency and to the gen
eral content of the community nil the duties
of ceiemouy which devolve upon him, and
many which are more than duties of cere
mony. You heard much last summer of his
unpopularity; probably too much. The
English press, in its unusual attitude of a
moralist on gambling, overdid the matter.

CIIUUCH AND STATE.
The French Government's Policy Sustained
by the Deputies.
Paris, Dec. 12.— 1n the Chamber to-day
the debate on Hubbard's motion of yester
day was very heated. Premier de Frey
ciuet said ho would never allow the preten
sion of the clergy to go unbound by laws.
He affirmed that the present state of affairs
must bo changed, but stated that the Gov
ernment was opposed to the separation of
church ami state. In January the Govern
ment would introduce a bill relating to as
sociations. Tho measure would not be es
pecially directed agaiust the clergy, but they
must take warning. . .
The Chamber rejected Hubbard's motion,
340 to 181, amid much excitement.
Ribot then proposed a vote of confidence,
pledging the Government lo use its powers
to compel the clergy to submit to the law.
The resolution passed by a vote of 343 to 223.

BRITISH TRADE.
Comments on the Effect of the McKinley
Tariff.
New York, Dec. 12.—A London cable
gram says: English comment as to the do
mestic part of President Harrison's message
is all colored by irrepressible prejudice
touching the tariff and free trade. The
free-traders are astonished by his figures—
so much astonished that one amiable critic
suggested that they had probably been
"cooked." English free-traders believed,
as one of them says, that the direct and im
mediate result of the McKiuley tariff would
be to diminish the total volume of Ameri
can exoort and import-trade. Both have
nevertheless shown their disregard of eco
nomical laws by increasing. What resource
have the doctrinaires, except to sug
gest that the Presidential statistics aro
open to a good deal of criticism? The In
crease of free imports by $100,000,000, and
the decrease of dutiable imports by the
same amount, are additional blows to
the, doctrinaires. " Why," tbey ex
claim, "this is just what the pro
tectionists desired and predicted. They
wanted to keep out the foreigner
where he competes with home industry and
let him in where he does not." But the
triumphant protectionist need not be too
triumphant. Tho free-trader has had an
answer ready. "A more accurate analysis
will soon disclose that much of that increase
in the volume of trade is emphatically bad
trade." Why want • for more accurate
analysis? Why not say at once that all
trade is bad, which is got free trade?
That is what he means. No trade in
America can be good which does not enrich
the British manufacturer at tlie expense of
tbe American. Let that be understood
once for ali; The advantage of this method
of economical criticism ls obvious; it
renders the lree-trade critic independent of
all facts aud figures which do uot support
his theory.

Roogli Experience of the Steamer
Wetmore.
Captain Eastings Tells How She Tossed
Rudderless on tne Ocean Until Picked
Up by tbe Zambesi.
U rrial to Thk Mobninq Caul.
Astoria. Dec. 12.— Captain Hastings of
the whaieback steamer Wetmore furnished
the following report from the ship's log to
night: Ou Sunday morning, December 6th,
the barometer commenced to fall rapidly,
with increasing wind from the south-south
west, the sea rising with a heavy westerly
swell during the forenoon. We had no
difficulty in steering a good course, but as
tho wind and sea increased the vessel
steered badly until 7:30 o'clock in the even
ing, when the vessel refused to answer her
helm. By this time It was blowing a gale,
but we experienced no difficulty in heaving
the ship to and bringing her head to the sea,
which position was maintained during the
night, the steamer riding the seas easily.
The wind Increased to a hurricane. The
sea became so heavy that the steamer fell
off into the trough of it and while between
the seas the sails would become becalmed.
By daylight on the morning of the 7th we
succeeded in bending the starboard anchor
to a harbor tow-line tt try and club-haul
her off shore, but iv consequence of tlio force
of wind and sea it had no effect. We kept
the engiues ngmg astern all Monday night
aDd thus prevented the shin driving on a lee
shore, which at this time was less than two
miles distant. By 4 o'clock on the morning
of the Bth the weather and sea moderated
some. At 6 o'clock we stopped the engines
to try and bring the vessel's bead to the sea
and this time succeeded in doing so, and,
when she headed off shore, hauled in our
anchor, started the engines ahead and kept
her going further off shore. '/.£. ■_•
during the night we bad all hands working
on the temporary rudder which we at
tached to the rudder chains. At 6 o'clock
we had this work going aud the ship under
control, the first time since Sunday night.
At 10 o'clock the British steamer Zambesi
was sighted heading for us. The weather
was in' derating, but as the barometer was
lower than it ha 1 beeu any time during the
gale, Captain Hastings decided to get towed
into the nearest port and have the rudder
fixed, fie hoisted signals, signifying that
his rudder was damaged and the ship could
not be steered, and asking the Zambesi for a
tow into Astoria, where she was bound, to
which the captain of the Zambesi signaled
"Yes."
We then lowered the Wetmnre's boat and
passed our hawser to the Zambesi, when
she commented towing on us, our engines
working ahead. After towiug for about two
hours we arrived off the Columbia Kiver
bar, when the Zambesi displayed the signal
"the bar cannot be crossed until daylight,"
and she hove to until morning. At day
break the captain of the Zambesi made a
start, and before a fair strain could be got
on our hawser a nine-inch man ilia, it
parted in our towing chock. The Zambesi
came around and we put our. small boat out
azain and gut the tow-line attached. The
Zambesi kepi to wing us around while waiting
fur a pilot. The pilot boarded the Zambesi
from a pilot schooner before starting in
over the oar. At 8:30 P. m. we started to
cross the bar, the Zambesi steering us, and
the Wetmore- working her engines. At 4
o'clock the warp parted, which made no
perceptible difference in our progress or
steering. We crossed the bar safely, and at
9 o'clock anchored at Astoria,
DAMAGED BY STORM.
Effects of tiie Blow on Orchards and
Buildings.
Pasadena, Dee. 12.— worst storm
that has ever visited Pasadena made its ap
pearance between 2 and 3 o'clock yesterday
morning. The wind, which blew hard all
day Thursday, developed into a fierce gale at
about the hour mentioned, and swept every
thing before it. The storm lasted for three
houis, and it did incalculable damage to
orange orchards and property in the busi
ness section. The roofs of several of the
largest buildings were torn i ft' and carried
some distance. Scores of windows were
smashed in and the streets cleared of all ob
structions, such as signs."
The churches suffered most. The First
Methodist Church was completely wrecked.
The estimated damage is 815,000. The
Christian and North Congregational
churches were razed to the ground. Several
houses Id course of construction were blown
off their foundation. Many noble shade
trees were blown down and valuable plants
destroyed. The orange crop was greatly
damaged. At least half the crop is on the
groumi, and the fruit on the trees is bully
bruised and unfit for marketing. Many
trees are torn up by the roots.
The telephone and telegraph wires are
down. It was uight beiore communication
was established with Los Angeles. The
Raymond Hotel was damaged somewhat by
falling chimneys. Forty thousand dollars
will probably cover the damage to the prop
erty. The loss to the orchardists cannot be
estimated. .. r y. :i
Pomona. Dec. 12.—The severest storm
that ever occurred in this valley began
Thursday, continued all day and till next
morning. There was no damage to build
ings. A lew signs and awnings were carried
away in the city. Tho damage was confined
to shade and ornamental trees aud that was
not much. .Orange orchards were damaged
some, but few trees were destroyed, cer
tainly not one In five hundred. The loss on
fruit is large, being estimated at a quarter
of the crop, caused by whipping oranges off
and bruising many left on trees most heavily
loaded, which accounted for much less loss
th.in was reported yesterday. A few Dourly
built houses were blown down in Lordsbum,
three miles north of Pomona. No damage
was done at Chino to the southeast. The ■
wind came from the north directly over the
mountains the same as in 1887.
