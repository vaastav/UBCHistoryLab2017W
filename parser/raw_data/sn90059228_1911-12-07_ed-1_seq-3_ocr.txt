Washington.President Taft's annmal
message, whloh was read In both houses
(pith
congress Tuesday, deals exclusively
the anti-trust statute. The message
la part Is follows:
To the Senate and House of Represent
atives: This mesag-e Is the first of sev
eral whtoh I shall send to congress during
Ike Interval between the opening of Its
tegular session and Its adjournment fee
the Chrtotma holidays. The amount of
Information to be communicated as ta
the operations of the government, the
lumber of important subjects, calling'for
gomment by the executive, and the tyems
Snlssion to congress of exhaustive re
aorts by special commissions, make It Im
possible to, include |n one message of, a
Seasonable length a discussion of the top
ics that ought to be brought to the at
tention of the national legislature at Ma
rat regular session.
Doolaions of 'Supremo Court.
In May last the Supreme court handsel
Sown decisions In the suits In sanity
brought by the United States to enjoin
the further maintenance of the Standard
Oil trust and of the American Tobaooo
trust, and to secure their dissolution. The
Decisions are epooh-making and serve ta
advise the business world authoritatively
Of the scope and operation of the anti
trust law of 1890.- The decisions do not
depart in any substantial way from the)
previous decisions of the court In constru
ing and applying this important statute,
but they clarify those Important decisions
by further defining the already admitted
exceptions to the literal construction of
the act. By the decrees, they furnish a
useful precedent as to the proper method
of dealing with the capital and property
Of illegal trusts. These decisions sug
gest the need and wisdom of additional
or supplemental legislation to make It
easier for the entire business community
to square with the rule of action aal
legality thus finally established and to
preserve the benefit, freedom and spur
of reasonable competition without lose of
real efficiency or progress.
It has been said that the court, by In
troducing into the construction of the
Statute common law distinctions, has
emasculated it. This Is obviously untrue.
By its judgment every contract and com
bination in restraint of interstate trade
made with the purpose, or necessary ef
fect of controlling prices by stifling com
petition, or of establishing in whole or la
part a monopoly of such trade, is con
demned by the statute. The most ex
treme critiics cannot instance a case that
ought to be condemned under the statute
which is not brought within its terms as
thus construed.
The sugestlon is also made that the Su
preme court by its decisions in the last
two cases has committed to the court the
undefined and unlimited discretion to de
termine whether a case of restraint of
trade is within the tfrm of the statute.
This is wholly untrue. A reasonable re
straint of trade at common law is well
understood and is clearly defined. It does
not rest in the discretion of the court. It
must be limited to aoomplish the purpose
of a lawful main contract to which, in
order that it shall be enforceable at all,
It ii ust be incidental. If it exceeds the
needs of that contract it Is void.
Methods of Dissolution.
In the Standard Oil case the Supreme
ind circuit courts found the combination
OA and maintained" through thirty-seven
different corporations, the stock of which I
was held by a New Jersey company. It
In effect commanded the dissolution of i
this combination, directed the transfer
and pro-rata distribution by the New Jer
*ey company of the stock held by it in i
the thirty-seven corporations to and
Svmong its stockholders, and the corpora
tions and individual defendants were en
joined from conspiring or combining to
restore such monopoly: and all agree- I
jnents betwen the subsidiary corporations
sending to produce or bring about further
JTiolations of the act were enjoined.
In the Tobacco case, the court found
that the Individual defendants, twenty
ine in number, had been engaged in
successful effort to acquire complete do
jninion over the manufacture, sale, and
distribution of tobacco in this country
And abroad, and that this had been done
by combinations made with a purpose
and effect to stifle competition, control
prices, and establish a monopoly, not
only in the manufacture of tobacco, but
also of tin-foil and licorice, used in its
manufacture and of Its products of ci
gars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco
suit presentend a far more complicated
and difficult case than the Standard Oil
suit for a decree which would effectuate
the will of the court and end the viola
tion of the statute. There was here no
Single holding company as In the case
of the Standard Oil trust. The main com
pany was the American Tobacco com
pany, a manufacturing, selling and hold
ing company. The plan adopted to de
groy the combination and restore comple
