-would bo as sparsely inhabited as Nebraska
and the territories are to-day, an(Lit is ex-'"-
'tremely improbable tliat our western bound-
ary would lave been pushed beyond the
Mississippi. It is the emigrants who' arc
filling up' the Great West at the present
moment, and rendering it possible to
.construct the great continental railroads
-which are destined in time to give
J lis the -commercial supremacy of the
world. As to the strictly financial value of
'Immigration, all will concede that an emi
grant is worth precisely as much to the
country as it would cost to produce a native-born
laborer of the same average abili
ty. It is computed that an average Ameri
can fanner of skilled laborer costs about
$1,000 before he becomes self-supporting.
. but for various reasons not necessary to re
cite here, Mr. Kapp estimates the money
-value of each immigrant at $1,125.
"2fow there came into the country during
last year (1870) according to official re
i turns, 280,27S emigrants who, at the aver
f "j-age rate named above, added the enormous
sum of $310,312,750 to the aggregate wealth
of the nation This was for one year only,
it is to be recollected, and for a year which
fell much below the average. The total
number of immigrants who have come into
the country since the formation of the gov
ernment have been worth a little over $10,
000,000,000. Mr. Young, of the Bureau of
Statistics at Washington, differs a little from
Mr. Kapp fixing the average value
of an immigrant at $800; but even
? -at the Litter figures the total of
value reaches the stupendous sum of
$0,243,002,000. Still another fact remains
to be considered boforc we can arrive at a
conception of what our immigration is really
-worth to us. The above figures, startling
as they are, only indicate the value of the I
immifrratita' brain anil misfln in thn trarnf I
future productiveness. But careftd records
Tiave been kept, and these show that each
Immigrant brings with him about $60 in
cash, which, with a yearly immigration of
300,000, amounts to $18,000,000 annual
ly. The Germans alone bring into
the country $11,000,000 on an
; -average every year. Willi such a source of
7 "wealth infinitely more valuable than all
. the gold and silver mines and petroleum
wells in the land it is no wonder tliat the
United States progress with the enormous
. strides tliat have characterized their past
"history. But when we look upon a man
like Carl Schurz and recollect that the
ancestors of most of our leading men
came over but a short while ago, who
will deny that the financial is but a frac
tional part of the real value of immigration?"
A STKOSG (JOTEKSMiaX
Senator Sherman claims tliat through the
efforts of the Republican party " it is now
conceded tlia. we have one of the most
powerful Governments on the face of the
globe." Tes, the Government is powerful,
but how about tho people? Russia and
Austria have "powerful Governments,"
but they are not to our taste at all! A
powerful Government," in the sense that
tho term is employed means one that is ar
bitrary and irresponsible in its character.
The fact is tliat Sherman's party has made
our Government "powerful" by weaken
ing the power and rights of the people. Our
Revolutionary fathers would liave none of
these strong and "powerful" Governments.
Sherman says that " the rights of every
citizen have been defined and placed under
fhe National Government" during tho
Republican ascendancy. They were under
that protection for the seventy years before.
What Sherman really means is tliat the
"National" as he miscalls the Federal
Government, has usurped some of the
rights of the States, and is endeavoring, in
an imperfect manner, to exercise powers
that could bo better done by tliem. We do
not want, Cqt instanoe, the Procrustcau bed
tliat would suit New England to be the
measure of tho South and West.
BABBITS AND MICE IS YOUXG OB
CIIABDS. It is very disheartening to discover, dur
ing or at the close of winter, scores of
thrifty young apple and pear trees girdled
by vermin, Precautions might be taken
which would prevent it, did the owner sup
pose there was any real danger, yet it usu
ally lappens tliat, after years of exemption
from harm, mice or rabbits appear, or not
appearing do untold damage unseen.
There havo been many suggestions made
and plans devised to protect trees.
Blood sprinkled or painted upon
tho stems near tho ground ivjll
keep off rabbits; this is easy to obtain about
Christmas. If there is a plenty of it, it
may bo used freely, for no more valuable
jnatuire could be applied. It is feared, how
ever, that what is so disagreeable to rabbits
would only collect uie mice, lor wiuch it
Mould be choice viands. Tho attacks of
rabbits are made above the surface of snow,
jrhiiemiec usually operate beneath and
'4osetn the ground. They often eat tho
bark fglhe rootswhicharepartiaJIy covered
by graSand soil. This, however, is not very
damaging to the trees. An experienced lior
ticulturisthasfoundthatthe best protection
;w could apply was roofing paper or "felt,"
which is used as a surface of the so-called
''gravel" roofs. Tarred sheeting paper used
(or the side walls of houses, though tighter
would answer an equally good purpose.
The stems of the trees are surrounded by
pieces of this tarred paper passed around so
as to fit snujy, and fastened with carpet
tacks. ' licit way is to gash the lower
edge of tne4 trafew times, and digging
put the soil close to the stem, put the paper
4own below tbe surface, and cover it a little.
Tliis will effec;ually prevent mice gettingito
itf 10 tree, and is very quickly done. It will
provent harm from rabbits, also, provided
fho snow does noffcll too deep.

St. Lorns, Dec 5. The Republican
State Convention met to-day, and adopted
a resolution instructing the Liberal Bepub-

f tion, and they only on the

, subsequently voted for the following:
I Resolved, That we now adjourn to meet

'Committee, not for the nromotion of the
unite with them in a joint call for a conven
tion at an early day of all Republicans In
the State, regardless of past differences, to
nominate delegates to the National Repub

Tho two committees then met in joint
session and unanimously adopted a call for
a State Bepublican- Convention, to be held
at Jefferson City on the 22d of February.
Mcssa-jc or B. Grntz Brown.
St. Louis, Dec 5. Tho Missouri Legis
lature meets to-morrow at Jefferson City.
Gov. Brown's message is devoted largely to
State affairs. Referring to his appointments
to office he declares them to be representa
tive rather of fitness and capacity than of
partisan favor. This branch of subject is
so treated as to bear iuferentially upon civil
service reform in the country at large. He
recommends a radical revision of the reve
nue laws, and payment of gold interest on
State bonds. He also recommends a con
stitutional ordinance embracing a charter
for the city of St. Louis whose provisions
will thereby hare some permanancy and
not be altered and mutilated at every ses
sion of the Legislature.
He deTotes cousiderable space to national
affairs and deprecates the tendency towards
centralization at tho expense of local State
government. He draws a distinction be
tween Republican principles .and the Re
publican party, and from this stand-point
frames a scathing indictment of the national
administration. The results of last election
in this State are referred to, and a contrast
drawn between the condition of our people
under liberalism, and those of the South.
The railroad interest of the State is fully
discussed, and statistics of each company
given. He also recommends the establish
ment of reform schools for boys.

SOUTH CAROLINA.
Kn-Klux Trial Stanbory's Arg-amciit
Columma, Dec 0. In the Ku-Klux
trial to-day, Stanbery for the defence moved
to quash the indictment against Crosby and
others upon Uie grounds tliat the persons
injured are not mentioned in the indict
ment; tliat the grand jury had decided as to
the law instead of the facts; that the indict
ment was defective in stating a deprivation
of the right to vote as taking place at a fu
ture date; that the Constitution and laws
do not secure any citizen the right to vote
and that the State, not the Federal Courts,
must redress the personal grievance com
plained of. Stanbery argued for two hours
in support of his objections. Cinber, for
the Government, replies to-morrow.
Tbo State Finances.
In the Legislature to-day a number of
financial measures were introduced, among
which were bills for the cancellation of all
unsigned State bonds, for obtaining posses
sion of the sterling bonds now in New

usual resolutions distributing the portions.
or tiiei, message among the appropriate
committees were offered by Mr. Davis and
adopted.
Are There Any Insurrectionary States?
Before the-vott was taken Wood inquired
whetlicr there was any such committee as
the Committee on Insurrectionary States?
Dawes replied tliat there was a commit
tee which went by tliat name, and which
was raised last session for the purpose of
considering the subject which it was now
proposed to refer .to it, tho Ku-Klux out
rages.
Wood said this committee was brought
into existence for tho purpose of visiting the
Southern States to do certain tilings. When
that committee had reported to the House,
it liad no further functions. He was there
fore opposed to reviving it for the whole
Congress in this surreptitious manner.
Mr. Dawes stated in reply to Mr. Wood
tliat the terms by which the Coinmitteo was
constituted provided it should continue
during the present Congress, but even if it
were not so, there had been yesterday re
ferred to that Committee some measure
which would have revived had it not ex
pired. Mr. Wood protested against the contin
uance of a committee which was only
useless but promotive of disorder and dis
traction throughout tho country.
Postal Telegraph.
Mr. Randall thought the question of union
of telegraph and postal service and all ques
tions of subsidies should go to the Co'mJ
mitteo on Commerce or Postofiice Commit
tee instead of to select committees. Ho
had seen the evil of creating select commit
tees to consider special subjects; he rememS
bered tliat when the first Pacific Railroad
Committee was established the Speaker of
the House made it up in the interest of the
roads and that the committee was prepared
to give away all tho land of tho nation.
Mr. Farnsworth moved that the subject
be referred to the Postofiice committee as
the only one having proper jurisdiction.
Mr. Dawes said this was a great subject
worthy the consideration of the country,
and which was being forced on its consid
eration by the events and tendencies of the
age. If anything required a special com
mittee which would liave time to consider
it fully, it was this subject.
Mr. Niblack suggested that the project
wouidentail an immense patronage on the
Administration which would hav the ap
pointment of at least 8,000 employees to take
charge of the telegraph business, which fact
made the proposition an appalling one to
him and would control his vote against it.
Mrr Farnsworth understood it was pro
posed to incorporate with every consider
able postofiice in the country a telegraph
office and make every postmaster a tele
graph operator, or appoint an expert to
operate the telegraph. The Government
would thus havo cognizance of all the pri
vate, confidential and financial business of
the people. Every member of Congress
would be importuned by his consti
tuents to make their postofiice a
telegraph station. The postofiice Commit
tee had been appointed without refer
ence to this subject, and might therefore be
presumed as fair as one appointed specially.
He was willing to admit tliat ho had gone
over the whole subject, and was against the
whole scheme The success of the system
in England or any thickly settled old coun
try, where no new postofiice had been es
tablished for fifty years, formed no criterion
for this country. The whole thing was
monstrous in auy way it could be regarded.
Mr. Banks remarked that the question of
ocean cables was in the jurisdiction of the
Foreign Committee, and moved that that
point be stricken from the pending resolu
tion. Mr. Dawes assented and the resolution
was so modified.
Mr. Banks thought it best for the interest
of the country to avoid a special committee
where there was a permanent standing
committee to whom a subject could be re
ferred. Mr. Beck a member of the special com
mittee of last Congress, said the cost and
effect of the project had been understated
wrong. There were 5,000 stations in the
country with 77,000 miles of line and 7,000
employees. Under the gevernment plan
there would be at least 20,000 telegraph
offices, 150,000 miles of line and 25,000 em
ployees. He believed the proper committee
to be tliat of Appropriations who would be
very careful in recommending anything
that would take from the people not $35,
000,000 but nearly 570,000,000. He did
not believe the committee would ever sanc
tion such a scheme or even consider it for a
moment,
Randall wished to stop this scheme of
plunder at the threshold. He was informed
tliat originally the whole of the telegraph
lines did not cost over two or three millions,
and now the company had the effrontery to
ask Congress to take its property at the
present appreciated value. He woidd op
pose the scheme because it would place the
whole private and busniess transactions of
the people under the scrutiny of the Govern
ment officials. He hoped the House would
squelch the thing a. once.
Mr. Dawe? did not understand tliat any
project recommcuded tho statement by Mr.
Randall tliat the Telegraph Company asked
Congress to purchase its property at an
enormous rate. He showed that tho gen
tleman did'nt understand the relations of
the matter more than many. The West
ern Union Company was trying itself with
all its power and influence against any such
proposition.
Mr. Beck remarked tliat wliile tLo West
ern Union Company opposed the project in
the last Congress, he understood it had
changed position and now is anxious for it.
Mr. Dawes said tliat fact did not com
mend the matter to his approval, but this
was not the time to enter on the merits of
the whole subject.
After further discussion by Mr. Palmer
and Mr. Garfield in favor, and Mr. Colraar
and Mr. King against a special committee,
the subject was rcfered by 105 to 08 to the
Committee on Appropriation,
The resignation of Washburn, of Massa

To Clean a Carpet.
If brooms are wet in boiling suds once a
week they will become very tough, will not
cut the carpet, last much longer, and always
sweep like a new broom. A very dusty
carpet may be cleaned by setting a pail of
cold water out by the door, wet the broom
in it, knock it to get out all the drops, sweep
a yard or so, then wash the broom again as
before and sweep again, being careful to
shake all the drops off the broom, and not
sweep far at a time. If done with care, it
will clean a carpet very nicely, and you will
be surprised at the quantity of dirt in the
water, The water may need to be changed
once or twice, if tbe carpet Is tery dnsty.

The Provisional Lesrislatnro Will the
Orleans Princes bo Admitted ?
Pakis, Dec 5. The National Assembly
effected an organization to-day by the re
election of President Grevy and tho Vice
Presidents of last session.
The report that Thiers had sent a mes
sage to the Assembly was premature. Al
though its contents are known, it is not yet
been received or published. It is presumed
tliat Thiers withholds the document be
cause he is against declaring himself in fa
vor of the admission of the Orleans Princes
to the Chamber, and some avowal on the
point is expected in the forthcoming mes
sage, more especially as it is supposed that
he" has received a notification that the Prin
ces intend to claim a right to their seats as
the legally elected representatives of the
people.
The status of the Orleans Princes prom
ises to be one of the leading questions before
the Assembly. Bills restoring to them their
confiscated estates, and all their rights as
citizens of France, are preparing, and will
be introdued at an early day. It is antici
pated that these measures will give rise to
long and exciting debates. The extreme
left wing will meet them with propositions
for a general amnesty, which, setting free
the thousands of Communists still held pris
oners, will only be considered an act of jus
tice, as that proposed to bo done to the
house of Orleans.
Paws, Dec 5 Evening. Thiers ap
pears to havo made up liis mind to oppose
the admission of the Orleans Princes to the
National Assembly, for the Princes to-day
waited upon Thiers for the purpose of lis
tening to an exposition of the reasons in
fluencing him against their taking seats in
the Legislature and of endeavoring by argu
ment to change his decision. The Presi
dent received the Princes courteously but
owing to the pressure of public business
was unable to hear or reply to them to-day.
He however appointed an interview for
Friday next, at which time he will be pre
pared to develope fully his reasons for re
straining them from taking seats in the As

A great lire occurred to-day in the arcades
of the Hotel Du Louvre, which contained

What He Says.
Correspondence Cincinnati Conjmerclal.
GREKJfEVTLLE, TKHW, Nov. 23, 1871.
As long as Andrew Johnson lives' he will
be an object of interest to the American
people, and his views will command atten
tion, if they do not at all times command
respect. It will remain for history to prop
erly estimate his character and fix his status
in the galaxy of the nations' great, and any
attempt to do so now would bo premature.
At present he is over-damned and over
praised mostly over-damned. His ene
mies are not conficed to any portion of the
earth's surface, but are scattered about in
profusion in every direction, and arc known
irrihe newspapers, as Rebels and Radicals.
It happens that extremes meet over the
head of A. J., and both ends pommel him
without mercy. This would be a recom
mendation if both sides were not so strong
that few people are left to see the beauty
of It.
No matter what may have been John-
sou's faults since the war, his omissions and
commissions, his ihort-comings and over-
goings, it is clear to every unprejudiced
mind that the American people owe him an
everlasting debt of gratitude for his unflinch
ing, unhesitating and unselhsh loyalty to the
cause of liberty and the Republic during the
war. His service to the nation can never
be estimated. From tha eastern end of
this State it is no large estimate to say that he
carried twenty thousand men into tbo Fed
eral army. His influence among tho mass
of tho people of East Tennessee was almost
unbounded, and when he declared for his
trovernment he struck the cohorts of rebel
lion a blow that they never recovered from,
and have never forgiven. . No less a per
son than the ex-Vice President of the
Southern Confederacy told me, a little over
a year ago, that but lor Andrew Johnson
the South would have gained her indepen
dence, and that his great Union speech in the
Senate at the beginning of the war was the
most masterly eflort ever delivered on earth
1 ms may be, anu probably is, an over
estimate, but the fact of Johnson's great
service at a time wnen service was -needed,
remains, and the American people should
not forget it. He may have been a traitor
to his party, but he was never a traitor to
his country. He fought for the perpetuity
and integrity of the Republic at a time
when the hosts of treason, disunion and se
cession were marshalled for its destruction,
and it cannot be denied but what he did
herculean service through four long years
of trial and despair.
JOnNSON 1JT HETIKEMENr.
Hearing that Mr. Johnson was at home, I
determined to stop over a day and see liim.
He sticks close to his rural home "among
the Sabine hills," taking no part in political
affairs except to read the papers, and talk
with liis neighbors.
.Late yesterday evening l arrived at the
Greeneville depot, and took the only convey
ance at hand for the hotel, namely, a long
plank sidewalk. Greeneville looked drear in
the gathering mists of twilight, heavy clouds
overhead, muddy streets below, and damp
atmosphere all around. I passed by the
large, red brick house of Mrs. Williams
where John Morgan passed his last night on
earth, passed the garden where he was shot,
passed the fence that was torn down to take
liis body out, and up the long street through
which the cavalry came who killed lum.
The only hotel in Greeneville Is kept bv
one Mason, a genial Irishman, who learned
his trade that of a tailor under Andy
Johnson. I asked him how Andy was.
"He is just as he always is he is all
right," he replied, and it might be added
that most of the Greeneville people are of
the same opinion.
JOtR'SOX'S STORE.
I walked up the street toward the large
brick store owned by Johnson's son-in-law,
and presided over by Johnson's only living
son. The ex-President spends most of his
time in this store, he being tho owner of
the building, and perhaps having an inter
est in tho merchandise. Through the back
door I saw him in the back room, punching
up the fire with a long poker, and evidently
in condition to receive company. He re
cognized me instantly, offered me a cliair,
gave the fire a few more pokes, and Inquired
the news.
The ex-President appears to be growing
old only in years. To my eyes he does not
look a month older than he did two years
ago. His form is a3 erect, liis face as free
from wrinkles, his step as firm, and liis eye
as bright as two years ago. His liair Is a
little thinner and a little grayer, and that is
all that indicates the ravages of time.
Johnson has a constitution like a giant, and
vigor and long life is stamped in every linea
ment of his full, round face. He is tempe
rate in eating and drinking, reports to the
contrary notwithstanding. It is an error to
suppose that he drank all the whisky tliat
was consumed in Washington Litv during
his, administration. Others occasionally
took a little for the stomach's sake, and per
liaps do to this day.
GKAXT AND A SECOND TERM.
It is pretty well understood by this time
that Johnson hates Grant and Grant hates
Johnson. There has existed an unpleasant
ness between these two distinguished men
for a long time, growing out of the fact that
they have repeatedly accused one another
of telling falsehoods.
"Grant," said Air. Johnson, as he gave
the fire a vigorous poke, "Grant is entirely
absorbed in self. He is bent on having an
other term, for he is making a fortune out
of liis office, and don't want to give it up.
About four years more will finish his fortune
if it don't the country. He is tho first
American President who ever tried the ex
periment of getting rich In office, and he
wants to make it a success. It is humiliat
ing to an inU'nse degree to see the highest
officer of our Government grabbling for
riches like a pawnbroker. If the country is
to be afflicted with him another four years,
it would be well to find out bow much
money ho wants, and make It up and give
it to him. Let him set his figures, and let
the people shell out the amount, and, if
possible, stop the bribe-taking, gift-taking,
office-selling and horse speculation propen
sities of this little whiffit."
FRED. GRANT SAILING ON THE TEOrLE'S
MONEY.
"Why sir, as time advances, this little
horse-jockey gets worse. Ho either has no
brains at all or else he is lost to all sense of
decency perhaps both. Twenty years ago
for a President to have sent his son off to
Europe at Government expense would have
shocked the country like electricity. The
principle of tho thing, the feeble attempt
to ape foreign court customs is damning.
What right has Fred. Grant to go to
Europe at Government expense any more
than you or I? Who is Fred. Grant?
The son of a worthless horse-jockey Presi
dent, educated no, attempted to be educa
ted at Government expense, and now sent
off on the 'staff' of Gen. Sherman at full
pay and mileage. Why, sir, it is a clear and
a monstrous violation of law, and that, too,
by a man who has sworn to protect the
laws. It is deliberate and premeditated
stealing from the pockets of the people.
Going on the staff of Gen. Sherman! What
business has Sherman running off to
Europe? Why don't he stay at home and
attcod to his business, if ho has got auy, or
else resign and go at his own expense?
The whole thing is a fraud and a swindle,
and illustrates the evil times into which we
havo fallen.
"It is not enough that the national horse
jockey should have his entire worthless fam
ily connections saddled on the governjnent
from A to Z like so many paupers, but" his
son must draw money from tho Treasury to
go to Europe on a pleasure trip. Twenty
years ago it would have been as much as a
President's official head was worth to have
attempted it, but now the people quietly
submit, close their eyes, and mutely allow
themselves to be robbed. It's a small mat
ter, but'tlere is a great principle involved.
The people have burdens enough to bear
without having all of Grant's worthless
relatives pensioned upon them."
TIIE WRITE UQCPE AS A HEALTHY PI.ACE.
"I see, Mr. Johnson, that Grant's excuse
for being away from the scat of Govern
ment so much, is that the White House is
not healthy. How did you find it?"
"Not healthy 1 Well, he manifests a
strong inclination to stay in it four years
longer, if it ain't healthy. Why, my health
and that of my family was as good there as
h"Te or elsewhere. He make3 that an ex-
w to shirk duty and gad around tho
mtry with gamblers and horse-jockeys.

with, and the opposition casting aboui, in

sears the outside, wliicli shuts in the juices,
and the rapid application of heat soon cooks
