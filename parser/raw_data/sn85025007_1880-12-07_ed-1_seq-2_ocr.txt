PUBLISHED DAILY & TRI-WEEKLY BY
EDGAR SNOWDEN.
TUESDAY EVENING, DSC'B. 7, 18S0.
Mr. Hayes io the last annual message he Kill
seDd to Congress says; "Tho disposition to rcfaso
a prompt and hearty obedience to tho
equal rights amendments to tho Cocstitulion,
:?n ?!io trno ftf a ftftmnlelo
IB All bum LIU V* Diauua IU kuw n ?J _
obliteration cf s ctiocal lioes io oar politioal
oootcsls." And yet, is a reasonable man, ordinarily
informed regarding the condition of bis
country, bo mast know that there is no dispo
aiticn to refaso a prompt obedience to the
equal rights amendments to the Constitution,
at least io tho Sooth, but that even if
there were, tko implaoablo haired of the
illiberal and narrow minded bigots of the
North, and the ways and means resorted to by
the republican politicians of that section to keep
themselves in effioo, would bo moro than euffi
oient to perpetuate sectionalism. Io another
portion of his message, be says: "It will bo
the duty cf tho Esecutivo to prosecute unsparingly
all who have been engaged io depriving
citizens of tho rights guaranteed ibem by the
Constitution." We hope therefore ho will
commenoc at onoo upon the rioh employers at
the North, who oan bo oonvioted without any
trouble or delay of foroing their poor employees
to vote for Garfield under pain of instant dis*
obarge, and (bat he will oecso his peisroutioo
of election judges io Virginia who, in accordacoo
with a judicial decision specially applied for,
refased to accept illegal ballots. He a'so says:
"Wherever general eduoatioD is found, peace,
virtue and social order prevail, and civil and reK.inn.Cko.ln
rtra ernifa " \Vrt ftm ftH mnoh

io favor of proper education as it is possiblo to
bo, bat, most a-snrodly, ore cot mado so by a
comparison of tbe peace, virtue and social order
that exist among tbe negroes of the Scnth now,
ooder tbe influence of free schools, with thosa
ojeditions as they prevailed amocg them when
as slaves they did'et know b from bull's foot.
In tho trite expression quoted Mr. Hayes also
rans directly oounter to tbe better formed views
of so good a republican a's Mr. Richard Grant
White and numerous other loss notorious,
bat more conscientious republicans than him
self. As to %,relifiicu3 liberty" being sccaro
whero ichools abcuod, wo havo ODly to point to
ex Governor Garoolon, of Maine, who W39 driv
en from bis church for attempting to cxecu'e
the written law cf his State, and tbo more re*
oent attempted political prescription of Mayor
Grace, of New York, bccauso be is a Catholic.
Inspecting civil service, about which, for bis
own sake, bo should never open his mouth, 1 o
says that "by competitive examinations all aro
BUljeot to the carno tests, and tho result is freo
from prejudice by personal favor or partisan
influeno?." Now no ono knows better than
Mr. Hayes that satisfactory examinations cro
as octbicg compared with personal favor and
partisan icfiaonoc, for in innumerable instances
bo has exerted his cwo pctont official influocoo
and given positions to tboso wbo bad been
proved deficient in preference to tboso wbo had
answered oorrectly every question asked them.
Competitive examinations as Dowoondaoted aro
regarded by all wbo know anything about thorn
as tbo baldest farces when the applicant bas
either personal or partisan icfliencc in his favor.
When it is remembared that in the recent
campaign be allowed tbo govoromont employees
to be plandered, and discharged if tbey did'et
deliver their parses readily to the political as
sessors. the following extraot from his message
will strike most readers as the eablimest travesty
:
"I also recommend sccb legislation as, while
leaving every officer aa froe as any other citizm
to express bis politioal opinions aDd to ase bis
means for tbeir advancement, shall also enabb
him to feel as sifo as any private oitizjn in refusing
all demands upon bis salary for politioal
purposes. A law wbioh should thus guarantee
true liberty and jastioo to all who are eogaged
in the public service, and likewise oontaia
stringent provisions agairnt the use of official
authority to coerce the political action of privato
cit'z3ds or of official subordinates, is greatly to
be desired."
While on bis suljsot ho avails himself of tbo
opportunity it affords him of giviog a blow at
the Conkliog faction, by recommending the p:s
sago of in act aifijiog the relations of members
of Congress with respect to the appointment
to office by the Prosident. No body but
the tao ion referred to will objeot to this, for
with euoh autocratic powers as the President
bas, to deny him tbelsmall privilege of making
euoh appointments a9 he may ohooso is simply
ridiculous.
Mr. Hayes rcndeis himself absurd bysayiog,
"it is the right and duty of the United
- States to avow and maintain suoh supervision
and authority over aoy inter oceanic canal
across the Isthmus that coDo'eots North and
South America, as will protoot our natural interests."
The Isthmus cf Panama belongs to
the territory of the United States of Colombia,
and this oountry has no more right to interfere
with a oinal through it than it would have with
one in the moon.
His reoimmendation of measures that
will oondooe to the development of
our foreigo oommeroial exobanges and the
building up of cur osrryiog trade, we trust
moans that the tariff may be reduced so as to
permit foreign orders to bo paid for in foreign
goods, and thereby be increased tenfold, and
that Americans may be enabled to buy ships in
the cheapest market, though we are painfully
aware it does not.
His recommendation about the retirement of
the greenbacks is excellent, and that about increasing
the value of the silver dollar good,
tbongb it would bo better to stop the coinage
of that ooin altogether at least for the present.
He caps the olicnax by reoommeudiog an act
by Congress making General Grant Captain
Alexandra
General cf tho Arm?, with pay euitabh to that
rack, thus setting at dcfiico?, net only the
apitit, fcat tho very word?, cf tho faQ'J&mental
law of tho land.whioh sjyathsfc doltsatcd pernor
must ratnra to tha paopb. Tho wfco'.o pepir,
wa are constrained to say, is a fi'liog iccidjot
of the olosing days of a fraudulent and dis
gtaoofa! administration.
Thero is no doab: aboat tho political independence
cf Col. Piatt, and that he can seo in
what dircolicn tho true interests of tho South
lie, oven better than many of his Southern
coDtGoporfliieF, i3 proved bytfco follcwingexIracS
from ono of bis articles in last Sunday's
Washington Capital:
'"What tho South ought to do ii to (reds di

their castomors. Lot thero bo formed a Southern
league ibat will make the South solid?nol
for political purposes, but for material interest
and advantages?and the socer will dio nut,
and bo replaoed by a look of sickly anxiety."
Iho weather since Sunday morciog Las beer
very cold throughout tbo Northwest, with high
wiads. A light snow fell at Cbioago yesterday,
and snow was reported i-a Michigan, Illinois,
Wisconsin and Iowa. Tho lowest temperature
wos ia Nebraska, whero it was 8 degrees below
ziro. Scow has fallen throughout Canada.
Tho sadden cold has fi:cd tbo (Joiled States
mariao hospitals with frostbiiteo siilcu. The
medical officers io charge ct tho marino hospitals
at Chicago and Detroit havo been obliged
to telegraph lor authority to purchase addition
al beddicg.
General Moorhead, who Las been proxi
oently mentioned for the Uoitcd States senatorship
from Pennsylvania to succeed Mr. WaU
lic.\ makes the announcement tbst ho Devei
BDugbt tho position, will not seek it, end will
only accept it if it oomcs to him wirhcut brckcring,
quarrels and disiensioD. General Moorhesd's
position in regard to tho position in
question is unquestionably the oorrco, one, but
es politics ero new conducted in Peoosylfacii
and elsewhere it is doubtful whether it will prove
a niuuirg uaia.
The official term of Comp;rcllcr John Kslly(
of New York city, expires to-day. Mayor
Ccoper has tho power to ncminato Lis successor
to tho Board of Aldermen for o.ufi:matioD,
and, as tho republicans and aGtoTammansites
have a mbjority io tbo board, a saccsjar to Mr,
Kelly could perhaps bo confirmee; bat it is pes
siblo Mayor Cooper will leave ibo cominatioc
tn Mr. Gric?, io whio'a event ic is likely Mr,
Kelly will bo reappointed.
Mr. Hayes recommends io his meessjjo that
Grant bo mado captain general of tho army ol
tho U. 8. and then immediately retired, whioh
would moke him a pensioner apon tho govern*
mont at a salary of about $12,000 p:r annum.

It is said Here to-day by gentlemen from the
7th Congressional district of Virginia that the
Allen amendment to the debt bill was the sole
cause of the recent election of Paul in that district.
and that aimr (L. any otter democrat, Dr.
Moffelt, Mica jab Woods, the present member,1
La Grazette an
Judge Earris, or any body o'se, tut Mr. Allen,
would have boon elected.
The prevailing impression about the payment
of tbe deputy marshals is that they will be paid
by the present Congress,for the reason that there
are enough democrats in each bouse to give the
republicans the requisite strength.
There is ?ov:o talk that an investigation of the

ot the oxpeDsea for clerk hire, &c , whic'i
are thought to be considerable larger than tbe
receipts ol tho^e cffices now warrant. The effect
of this action would, doubtless, be to discourage
the "outs" in their efforts to dislodge
tbe present incumbent at Alexandra.
