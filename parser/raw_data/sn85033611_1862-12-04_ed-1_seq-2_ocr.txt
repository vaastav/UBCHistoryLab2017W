The President's Message.
JFellow citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives :
Siuce your last assembling another
year of health and bountiful harvests
has passed, and while it has not pleased
the Almighty to bless as with a return
e ...... i.oniint tint iirpw ri ,

wise way.
all will be well.
The correspondence touching for-;
eign affairs which has taken place du-
ring the last year, is herewith submit-
ted, in virtual compliance with a re-'
quest to that effect, made bv the Honse I
oi representatives near the close or tne
past session of Congress. If the con
dition of our relations with other na
tions is less gratifying than it has usu
ally been at other periods it has cer
tainly been more satisfactory than a
nation so unhappily distracted as we
are, wight have reasonably appre
ended.
In the month of June last there was
some grounds to expect that the mari
time powers which at the beginning of
our domestic difficulties so unwisely
and so unsuccessfully as we think, re
cognized the insurgents as a belliger
ent powers,
would soon recede from
that position which has proved only
lee injurious to themselves than to our
country, but the temporary reverses
which afterwards befel the national
arms and which were exaggerated by
our own disloyal citizens abroad have
hitherto delajed that act of simple
justice.
The civil war which has so radically
changed for the moment the occupa
tions and habits of the American peo
ple, has necessarily disturbed the so
cial condition and affected very deeply
the prosperity of the nations with
which we have carried on a commerce
that has been steadily increasing
throughout a period oi halt a century
It has at the same time exc
. 1 l-,-
ltetl polltl-
cal ambitions and apprehensions which
i i a r j ,.
have produced a profound agitation
throughout the civilized world
In this unusual agitation we have
forborne taking part in Mj controversy
betweeu parties and factions in anv i
such StaJ.es. We have attempted no
propagrandism and acknowledged no
revolution, but we have left to every
nation the exclusive conduct and man
agement of its own affairs. Our stru
gle bas been of course contemplated
by foreign nations with reference less
to its own merits than to its supposed
and often exaggerated effects and the
consequence resalting to those n;ilins
themselves. Nevertheless, complaint
on the part -of this government, even
if it were jnst, would certainly be un
wise. The treaty with Great Britain for the
wppressi.jn of the slave trade has been
put into operation with a good prospect
of complete success. It is an occasion
of especial pleasure to acknowedge
that tbe execution of it on the part of
Her Majesty's government has been
marked with a jealous respect for the
authorities of the United States and
the rights of tiieir mural and loyal citi
zens. The convention with Hanover for
lhe abolition of the State dues has been
carried into full effect under the act oi
Congress for that purpose.
A blockade of 3,000 miles of the sea
coast could not be established and vig
orously enforced in a season of great
commercial activity like the present
without committing occasional mis
ta"kes, aud inflicting unintentional in
juries upon the fsTei-gM nations and
their subjects. A civil war, occurring
in a countty where foreigners reside
and carry on a trade under treaty stip
ulations, is necessarily fruitful of com
plaints of the violations of neutral
rights. All such collisions tend to ex
cite misapprehensions and possibly to
produce national reclamations between
nations which have a common interest
iu preserving peace and friendship.
In clear cases of these kinds I have,
so far as possible, heard and redressed
complaints which have been preferred
by friendly powers. There is, how
ever, a large and augmenting number
of doubtful cases upon which the Gev
rnment is unable to agree with the
Governments whose protection is de
manded by the claimants. There are,
mereovor, many cases in which the
United States or their citizens suffer
wrongs from naval and military author
ities of foreign nations, which the Gov
ernment of these States are not pre
pared to redress.
I have proposed to some of the for
eign States thus interested mutual con
ventions to examine and adjust such
complaints. This proposition has been
made especially to Great Britain, and
to France, to Spain and to Prussia. In
such case it has been kindly received,
but has not yet been formally adopted.
I deem it my duty to recommend an
appropriation in behalf of the owners
of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. For
ciens Kioia, which vessel was in May
1861, prevented by the commander of
the blockading force off Charleston,
from leaving that port with a cargo,
notwithstanding a similar privilege had
shortly before that been granted an
English vessel. I have directed the
Secretary of State to cause the papers
jn the cae to be communicated to the
proper committee.
Application 3T been made to me
by many free Americans of African
descent to favor ItK'ii emigration, with
a view to such colonization as was con
templated in recent acts P Congress.
Other parties, at home and abroad,
some from interested motives, ot. ers
upon patriotic principles, and still oth
ers influenced by philanthropic senti
ments, have sug.ge.sUd similar measures;
while on the other band several of the
Spanish American Republics have pro
tested against the Bending of such col
Onies to their respective territories.
Under these circumstances 1 have
declined to move any such colony to
any St:de without first obtaining the
oonsent of the Government, with an
agreement on iu pai t to receive and
protect sucti emigrants in an ..s1'
as freemen, and I have, at the same
time, offered to the several States situ
ted in the tropics, or having colonies
there to negotiate with them, subject
to the advice and conseut of the Seu-
ate, t favor liie voluntary emigrants
or portions of that class to their res
pective Territories, upon conditions,
which shall be equal just and humane.
Liberia and Hay ti are yet the only
countries to which" colonists of African

sncll persons, contemplating coioiuza-
tion, do not seem so willing to em
grate to these countries as to someoth-
ers. nor so willing as I think their in-
tercet demand.". 1 believe, however,
that the opinion is improving, and that,
ere long, there will be an augmented
and considerable emigration to both
uiese countries rrom me uimuu o-.mh.-p
The new commercial treaty between
the United States and the Sultan of
Turkey has been carried into execution.
A commercial and consular treaty has
been negotiated, subject to the Sen
ate's consent, with Liberia, and a sim
ilar negotiation is now pending with
the Republic of Hay ti. A coimidera
blo improvement of the national com
merce is expected to result from these
measures. Our relations with great
Britain, France, Spain Portugal, Rus
sia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweeden, and
Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Borne,
and the other European States, remain
undisturbed. Very favorable relations
also continue to be maintained with
Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan.
During the last year there baa not only been no
change of our previous relations with the Indepen
dent States of our Continent but more frieudly
sentiments than have been heretofore existing are
believed to be entertained by those neighbors
whose safety and progress are so intimately con
nected with our own. This statement especially
applies to Mexico, Costa Hica, Nicaragua, Hon
duras, Peru and Chili. The commission under the
convention with the Republic of New Grenada
closed its session without having audited and
passed upon all the claims which are submitted to
it. A proposition is pending to revive the conven
tion that it may be able to do more complete justice.
The commission between the United States and the
Republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors
and submitted its report.
I have favored the uroiect of connecting the
cnueu mates with t,uroic bv
an Atlantic tele
olaPn- aud a similar project to extend the tele
graph from Sau Fransisco to connect bv a Pacific
itic
telegraph wire with a wire that is being extended
across the Russian empire.
The Territories of the United States, with unim-
portaut exceptions, have remained undisturbed bv
the civil war, and chey are exhibiting such evi
dence of prosperity as justifies an expression that
some of them will soon be iu a condition to be or
ganized as States and be constitutionally admitted
into the Federal Union.
The immense mineral resources of some of these
Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as pos
sible. Every step in that direction would have a
tendency to improve the revenue of the Govern
ment and diminish the burdens of the people.
It is worthy of your serious consideration wheth
er some extraordinary measures to promote that
end cannot be adopted. The measuie which sug
gests itself as most likely to be effective is scienti
fic exploration of the mineral regions in those Ter
ritories, with a view to the publication of its re
sults at home and in foreign countries results that
cannot fail to be auspicious.
The condition of the finances will claim your
most diligent consideration. The vast expendi
tures inenieutal to the military aud naval opera
tions required for the suppression of the rebellion
nave nuiiei to ueeu met witn a promptitude and
certainty unusual iu similar circumstances, and the
public credit has been fully maintained.
The continuance of the war, however, and the
increased disbursements made necessary by the
inaugurated force now in the field, demand" out
best reflection as to the best mode of providing the
necessary revenue without injury to business, and
with the least possible burdens upon labor. The
suspension of specie payment bv the banks, soon
after the commencement of your last session, made
large issues of Luiied States notes unavoidable.
In no other way could the pavuieut of the troops
and other just demands be so economically or as
well provided for. The judicious legislation of
Congress securing the receivability ol these notes
for loans and iuternal duties, and making them a
legal tender for other debts, has made them uni
versal mm reucy, aud has satisfied, partially at least
and for the time, the long-felt Wiiit of a uniform
circulating medium, saving thereby to the people
immense sums in discount aud exchange. A re
turn to specie pavmeu's, however, at the earliest
period compatible, with a due regard to all inter
ests, should be kept in view.
Fluctuations in the value of currency are always
injurious, aud to reduce these fluctuations to the
lowest possible point, will always be a leading pur
pose in wise legislation. Prompt and certain con
vertability iqto coin is generally acknowledged to
be the best ajod surest, against them, aud it is ex
tremely doubtful whether a circulation of the
United" States notes, payable in coin, aud sufficient
ly large for the wants of the people, can be perma
nently, usefully and safely maintained. Is there
any other medium which the necessary provision
for the public wants can be made, aud the great ad
vantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?
I know of uoiic which promises so certain results,
and at the same time so unobjectionable as the or
ganization of bauking associations under a general
act of Congress well guarded in ! provisions.
Tu sucii associations the Government might fur
nish circulating, notes on the-security of United
States bonds deposited in the treasury. These
notes prepared under the supervision of proper of
ficers being uniform in appearance, and "security
and convertible always with coin, would at once
protect labor against the evils of a vicious curren
cy, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe ex
chaatffs. A moderate reservation from the inter
esfn the bonds would com- p nsate the
bnited States for the preservation and distri
bution of the notes, and a general supervision
of the system, would lighten the burden of that
part of the public debt employed as security. The
public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved
and the negotiation of new loaus greatly facilitated
by the steady market demand for government
bonds, which the adoption of the proposed system
would create. It is au additional recommendation
ol the measure, of considerable weight in my judg
ment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all
existing iuterests by the opportunity offered to
existing institutions tor asecureu uniform national
circulatmp in place of the local and various circu
lation, slcured and unsecured, now issued by them.

I therefore content mvself with laying the re

them.
It aivtja m,e pleasure to report a decided im
provement in the financil condition of the Post
0 flier Department as compared with the several
preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year

lhe
ine expenditures show a suit more tavoraoie

606,799.11. For the last year the amount has been
about iS.487.00O In the expenditures, as compared
with the preceding year, or about 3,750,o6o, as
compared witn me nscat year ot I860.
The deficiency iu the department for the pre
vious year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal
year it was reduced to $2,112,814,57. These fa
vorable results are, in fact, owing to the cessation
of mail conveyance in the insurrectionary States,
aud in part to a careful review of all expenditures
ot that department, in the interest of economy.
The efficiency of the postal service it is believed
has also been much improved. The Postmaster
General also opened a correspondence, through
the Department of State, with Foreign Govern
ments, proposing a Convention of postal repre
sentatives, tor the Durooseof simplifying the rates
of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign
I mails. This proposition, equally important to our
adorted citizens and to the commercial iuier;-
of this country, has been favorably entertained
and agreed to by all the Governments from whom
replies have been received. I ask the attention of
Congress to the suggestion of the Postmaster Gen
eral in his report respecting the further legislation
required in his opinion for the benefit of the postal
service.
The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows
in regard to public b.nds :
The public lands have ceased to be a source of
public revenue. From the 1st of July, 1861, to the
30th of September, IMS, the entire cash receipts
from the sales of public lands were $187,475.26
a sum much less than the expenses of our land
system during the same period.
The homestead law, which will take effect on the
1st of January next, offers such inducements to
settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to
an extent sufficieut to meet the expenses of the
general land office, and cost of surveying and
bringing the land into market.
The discrepancy between the sums here stated
as arising from the sales of public lands and the
sums derived for the same source as repot ted from
the Treasury Department arises I understand, from
the fact that the periods of time, though apparent
ly, were not really prominent at the beginning
point. The treasury report includes a considera
ble sum now which "had previously been reported
from the interior sufficiently large to greatly over
reach the sum derived from the three mouths now
reported upon by the Interior, and not by the
Treasury Department.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during
the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordina
tion, and'at several points, engaged in open hostil
ties against the white settlers m their vicinity. The
tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kan
sas renounced their allegiance to the United States,
and entered into a treaty with the insurgents.
Those who remained loyal to the United States
were driven from the country . The chief of the
Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of
restoring the former relations of the tribe with the
Uuited States. He alleges that they were con
strained by suerior force to enter into treaties
with the insurgents, and that the United States
neglected to furnish the protection which their
stipulation required.
In the month of August last, the Sioux Indians
in Minnesota attacked the settlers in their vicinity
with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately
men, women and children. This attack was wholly
unexpected, and therefore no defence had been
provided. It is estimated that not less thau 800
persons were killed by the Indians, and a large
amount of property was destroyed.. How this out
break was' induced' is not definitely Known ; and
suspicions, which may be unjust, need uot be
stated.
Information was received by the Indian Bureau
from the different sources, about the time hostili
ties were commenced, that a simultaneous attack
was to be made upon the white settlements by all
the tribes between the Mississippi River ami the
Rocky Mountains.
The State ot Minnesota has suffered great injury
from the Indian war. A large portiou of her ter
ritory has been dejiopulated, and a severe loss has
been sustained by the destruction of property. The
people ui iiiai .luiu luainit-M muni miAn-i mm iiit-
reinoval of the tribes beyond the limits of the State,
as a ifuarautee against further hostilities
The Commision of Indian Affairs will furnish
full details.
I submit for your special consideration whether
our Indian system shall not be remodeled. M any
wise aud good men have been impressed with the
belief that this can be profitably done,
I submit a statement of the proceedings of the
commissioners, which shows the progress that has
been made iu the enterprise of constructing! the
Pacific Railroad and thus suggests the earliest
completion of the road, and also the favorable action
of Congress upon the project now pending before
them for eulariring the capacities of the canals in
New York and llliuois, as being of vital and rap
idly increasmg importance to the whole nation, aud
especially to the vast interior region hereafter to
be noticed at some greater length.
I propose having prepared and laid before you
at au early day some interesting and valuable sta
tistical information upon this subject. The mili
tary and commercial importance of enlarging the
Illinois Hiver, is presented in the report of Colonel
Webster to the Secretary of War, aud now trans
mitted to Congress. I respectfully ask your atten
tion to it.
To carrv out i he provisions of the act of Congress
of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Depart
ment of Agriculture of the United States to be
organized. The Commissioner informs me that
within the period of a few months this department
has established an extensive system of correspon
dence and exchanges both at home and abroad,
which promises to effect highly beueficial results
in the development of a correct knowledge of re
cent improvements in agriculture in the introduc
tion ol new products, ana in me coiiecnou oi ag
ricultural statistics of the different States ; also,
that it will be prepared to distribute largely seeds
ocreals, plants and cuttings, and has already pub
lished aud liberally diffused much valuable infor
mation.
In anticipation of a more elaborate report which
in due time will be published, embracing some val
uable tests in ahemical science now iu progress at
the laboratory, the creation of Ihis department was
for the more immediate benefit of a large class of
our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the lib
eral Imais nnon which it has been organized will
not only meet your approbation, but that it will re
alize at no distant dav all the fondest anticipations
of its most sanguine friends, and become the truit
ful source of advantage to all our people.
On the 22d of September last a proc
lamation was issued bv the Executive
a copy of which is herewith submit
ted. In accordance with the purpose
expressed in the second paragraph of
that paper, I now respectfully recall
your attention to what may be called
compensated emancipation. A nation
may be said to consist ot its territory
its people and its laws. The territory
is the only part which is of certain dis
ability. "One generation passeth
awav and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth forever." It is
of the first importance to duly consider
and estimate this ever enduring part
That portion of the earth's surface
which is owned and inhabited by the
people of the United States is well
adapted to the home of one national
family. It is not well adapted for two
or more. Its vast extent, and its var
iety of climate and productions are of
advantage in the age of one people,
whatever they might have been in for
mer ages. Steam, and telegraphs and
intelligence, have brought these to be
an advantageous combination for one
united people.
In the Inaugural Address, 1 briefly
pointed out the total inadequacy of dis
union as a r.enedy for difficulties be
tween the peoi4 of the two sections.
I did so in language wmcn i cannot
improve and which, therefore, I beg to
repeat.
One section of our country believe
slavery is right aud ought to be exten
ded, while the other believes it to be
wrong and ought not to be extended.
This is the only substantial dispute.
Thp fugitive slave clause of the Con
stitution and the law, for the suppres
sion of the African slave trade, are
each as well enlorced, perhaps, as any
law can ever be in a community where
the moral sense of the people imper
fectly support the law itself. The
great body of the people abide by the
legal obligations in both case find a
few break over each. This think

tion. while fnrritivo. r, a..1v n.rti.Ilv I

at all to the other.
Physically speaking, we cannot sep
arate, we cannot remove our respective
sections from each other, nor build an
impassable wall between them. A
husband and wife may be divorced and
go out of the presence and beyond the
reach of each other, but the different
parts of our country cannot do this.
They cannot but remain face to face,
and intercourse either amicable or hos
tile must continue betweeu them. Im
it possible then to make that inter
course more advantageous or more sat
isfactory after KimraUon than before.
Can aliens make treaties easier than
friends can make laws f Can treaties
be more taithfully enforced between
aliens than laws can among friends.
Suppose you go to war, you cannot
fight alwavs, and when after much loss
on both sides, and no gain on either,
you cease fighting the identical old
questions as to terms of intercourse
are again upon you. There is no line,
straight or crooked, suitable for a na
tional boundary upon which to devide.
Trace through from East to est, up
on the line between tbe free and slave
country, and we shall find a little more
than one-third of its length are rivers
easy to be crossed, and populated, or
soon to bo populated thicklv, upon
both sides, while in nearly all its re
maining length are merely surveyors'
lines, over which people may walk back
and forth without any consciousness of
their presence. No part of this line
can be made any more difficult to pass
by writing it down on paper, or parch
ment, as a national boundary.
The fact of separation if it comes,
gives up on tne part ot the seceding
section, the fugitive slaee clause, along
with all other constitutional obligations,
upon the section seceded from, while I
should expect no treaty stipulation
would ever be made to take its place.
But there is another difficulty, lhe
great interior region bounded east by
the Alleghanics, north by the British
Dominions, west by the Rocky Moun
tains, ami south by the line along which
the cultivation of corn and cotton
meets, and which includes part of Vir
ginia, part or lennessee, all ot tt.cn-
tncky, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Il
linois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnes
ota, and the territories of Dacotah,
Nebraska and a part of Colorado have
tbove ten millions ot people, and will
have fifty millions within fitly years if
not prevented by any political tolly or
mistake. It contains more than one
third of the country owned by the re
volted States certainly, more than
one million of surface miles, one-half
s populous as Massachusetts already
is. it would nave more man seventy-
five millions of people. A glance at
the map shows that territorially speak
ing it is the great body of the Repub
lic, lhe other parts are but marginal
borders to it. The magnificent region
sloping west from the Kocky Moun
tains to the Pacific being the deepest
anl also the richest undeveloped re
sources in the production of provisions,
crrain, grasses, and all which proceeds
from them.
This great interior region is natural
ly one of the most important in the
world, ascertain from the statistics the
small proportion of the region which
has as yet been brought into cultiva
tion, and also the large and rapidly in
creasing amount of its products, and
wc shall be overwhelmed with the mag
nitude of the prospect presented.
And yet this region has no sea coast
and touches no ocean anywhere.
As part of one nation, its people now
may find and may forever find their
way to Europe by New York, to South
America and Africa by New Orleans,
and to Asia by San Francisco. But
separate our common country into na
tions, as designed by the present rebel
lion, and every man in this great inter
ior region is thereby cut off from some
one or more of these outlets, not per
haps by a physical barrier, but bv em
barrasing and onerous trade regulations,
and this is true wherever a dividing or
boundary line may be fixed. Place it be
tween the now free and slaue country, or
place it south of Kentucky, or north of
Ohio, and still the truth remains that none
south of it can trade to any port or place
north of it, and none north of it can trade
to any port or place south of it, except
upon terms dictated by a Government for
eign to them. These outlets East, West
and South, are indispensable to the well-
being ot the people inhabiting, and to in
habit this vast interior region.
Which of the three may be the best is
no nroner question. All are better than
either, and all of right belong to that peo
pie and their successors forever. Ture to
themselves, they will not ask where a line
of separation shall be, but will vow rath
er, that there shall be no such line.
Nor arc the marginal regions less inter
ested in these communications to and
through them to the great outside world
They do and each one of them must have
access to their Egypt of the West without
paying toll at the crossing of our national
boundary.
Our national life springs not from our
permanent past, not from the lands we in
habit, not from our national homestead.
There is no possible swerving of this but
would multiply and not instigate evils
among us. In all its applications and at
titudes it' demands union, and t-bhors sep
aration. In fact it would ere long force
reunion however much of blood and
treasure the seperation might have cost.
Our strife pertains to ourselves, to the
passing generations of men and it cannot
without convulsion be hushed forever,
with the passing of one generation.
With this view I recommend the fol
lowing resolution and articles amendatory
to the Constitution of the United States :
Resolved, By the Senate and House of Repre-
gress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses con-

1 beg indulgence to discuss these pro
posed articles at some length. Without
slavery the rebellion should never have
existed ; without slavery it could not con
tinue. Among the friends of the Union
there is great diversity of sentiment and
policy in regard to slavery and the Afri
can race amongst us Some would abol
ish it suddenly and without compensation
and some would abolish it gradually and
with compensation. Some would remove
the free people from us, and some would
retain them with us, and there are yet
other minor diversities. Because of these
diversities we waste much strength in
struggles amongst ourselves. By mutual
concession we should harmonize and act
together. This would be a compromise
atnonj; the friends and not with enemies of
the Union. These articles are intended
to embody a plan of such mutual conces
sion. If the plan shall be adopted, it is
assumed that emancipation will follow, at
least in several ot the States.
In the first article the main points are :
First, The emyncipation. Second, The
length of time for consurnmrting, in
years : and intra, ine compensation.
The emancipation will be unsatisfactory
to the advocated or perpetual slavery, but
the length of time should greatly mitigate
their dissatisfaction. The time saves both
races from the evils of sudden derange
ment, while most of those whose habitual
course of thought will be disturbed by
the measure, will have passed away be
fore its consummation. They will never
see it. Another class will hail the pros
pect of emancipation, but will deprecate
the length of time. They will feel that
it goes for little to tho now living slaves,
but it really gives them much. It saves
them from the vagrant destitution which
must largely attend immediate emancipa
tion in localities where the circumstances
are very great, and it gives the inspirit
ing assurance that their posterity shall be
free forever.
The plan leaves to each State choosing
to act under it to abolish slavery now or
at the end of the century, or at any inter
mediate time, or by degrees extending
over the whole or any part of that period ;
and it obliges no two States to proceed
like. It also provides for compensation,
and geneially the mode of makiug it.
This, it would seem, must further miti
gate the dissatisfaction of those who fav
or perpetual slavery, especially those who
are to receive compensation.
Doubtless some of those who are to pay
and not to receive will obieet to it. That
the measure is both just and economical
is certain. The liberation of the slaves
is the destruction of property acquired
by d sceut or by purchase, the same as
any other property It is no less true for
having been often said, that the people of
the South are no more responsible for the
introduction of this property than are the
people of the North ; and when it is re
membered how unhesitatingly we all use
cotton aud sugar, and share the profits of
dealing in them, it may not be quite safe
to say that the South has been more re
sponsible than the North for its continu
ance. If, then, for a common object, this
property is to be sacrificed, is it not just
that it be done at a common charge ?
And if with less money, or money more
easily paid, we can preserve the benefits
of the Union by this means, than we can
by the war alone, is it not economical to
do it?
Let us consider it then ; let us ascer
tain the sum we have expended in the
war since compensated emancipation was
proposed last March, and consider wheth
er, if that measure had been promptly ac
cepted by even some of the slave States,
the same sum would not have done more
to close the war than has been otherwise
done. Tf so, the. measure would save
money ; and in that view, would be a pru
dent and economical measure, certainly.
It is not so easy to pay something as it
is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a
large sum than a larger one.
The aggregate sum necessasy for com
pensated emancipation of course would be
large, but it would require no ready cash
nor bonds any faster than the emancipa
tion progresses.
This might not, and probably would
not close before the end of the thirty
seven years. At that time we shall prob
ably have 100,000,000 people to share
the burden mstead of dl,000,000as now,
and not only so, but the increase of our
population may be expected to continue
for a long time after the period as rapidly
as before, because our territories will not
have become full. I do not state this in
considerately. At the same ratio of in
crease which we have maintained on an
average from our first national census in
1790 until 1860, we should in 1900 have
a population of 1 03,208.4 1 and
may we not continue that ratio far beyond
that period.
Our abundant room, our broad national
homestead, is an ample resource. Were
our territory as limited as are the British
isles, certainly our population could not
expand as stated. Instead of receiving
the foreign born as now, we should be
compelled to send part of the native born
away, but such is not our condition. We
have 2,863,000 of square miles, with a
population averaging 73 J persons to the
square mile Why may not our country
at some time average as many ? Is it less
fertile? Has it more waste surface by
mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts and other
Is it inferior to Europe in any
natural advantage ?

This shows an average decimal increase of 34.-60-100
per cent, in population through the seventy
years from our first to our last census taken.
It is seen tnat tne ratio oi increase at no one oi
these seven periods is either two per cent, below
or two per cent, above the average. J nus showing
how inflexible and consequently how reliable the
law of increase in our case is. Assuming that it
will continue, it gives the following result :
Years. Population.

1890, 76,677,872

1910, 138,918,526
1920, 186,984,336
1030, 251.680,914
These figures show our country may be as popu
lous as Europe at some point between 1920 and
1930, say about 1925. Our territory at 73 to the
square mile being of capacity to contain 217,186,
3t4. This future we relinquish by the folly and
evils of disunion, or by along exhausting war,
springing from the only great element of discord
among ns, while it cannot be forseen exactly how
much one huge example of secession, bringing
lesser ones, would indefinitely retard the popula
tion, civilization and property.
'o one can doubt that tne extent of it would be
very great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would shorten this
war, perpetuate peace, insure the increase in pop
ulation, and proportionably the increase in the
wealth of the country. With this we should pay
all that emancipation would cost, without our otner
debts, easier than we should pay our other debts
without it.
If we had allowed onr old national debt to run
at 6 per ceut. per annum, simple interest, from the
end of our revolutionary struggle till to-day, with
out paying anything, either principal or interest,
each mau of us would owe less upon that debt now
than each man owed upon it then, and thus because
our increase of men through the whole period has
been greater than six pet ceut., and has run faster
than the iuterest upon the debt.
Thus time alone relieves a debtor
nation so long as its population in
creases faster than unpaid interest ac
cumulates on its debt. This fact would
be no excuse for delaying the payment
of what is justly due, but it shows the
great importance of time in this con
nection, and the great advantage of a
policy by which we stall not have to
pay until we number 100,000,000, what
by a different policy we would have to
have now when the number is 31,000,
000. In a word, it s1kws that a dol
lar will be much harder to pay for thv
wary than a dollar for emancipation
on the proposed plan, and then the lat
ter will cost no blood, no precious life.
It will be a saving of both.
As to the second articles I think it
would be impracticable to return to
bondage the class of persons therein
contemplated. Some of them doubt
less in the property sense belong to loy
al owners and hence provision is made
in this article tor compensating such.
The third article relates to the future
of the freed people. It does not oblige
but merely authorizes Congress to aid
in colonizing such as may consent.
This ought not to be regarded as ob
jectionable on the one hand or on the
other inasmuch as it comes to nought
unless by mutual consent of the people
to be deported and the American vot
ers uiroucn tneir representatives m
Congress.
I cannot make it better known than
it already is, that I strongly favor col
onization, and yet I wish to say that
there is an objection against the col
ored persons remaning in the country,
which is largely imaginary, if not some
times malicious. It is insisted that
their presence would injure and dis
place white labor and white laborers
if there ever could bo a proper time for
mere arguments that time surely is not
now. In times like the present, men
should utter nothing for which they
would not willingly be responsible thro'
time and eternity.
Is it true, then, that the colored peo
ple can displace any more while labor
by being free than by remaining slave?
If they stay in their own places, they
jostle no white laborers. If they leave
their old places, they leave them open
to white laborers. Logically, there is
nither more or less of it.
Emancipation, even without depor
tation, would probably enhance the
wages of white labor, and, very sure
ly, would not reduce them. Thus the
customary amount of labor would still
have to be performed. The freed peo
ple would, 6urely, not do more than
their old proportion of it, and, very
probably, for a time, would do less ;
leaving an increased part to white la
borers bringing their labor into great
er demand, and, consequently, en
hancing the value of it. With depor
tation, even to a limited extent, en
hancing wages to white labor is math
ematically certain. Labor is like any
other commodity in the market. In
crease the demand for it, and yon in
crease the price of it.
Reduce the supply of black labor by
colonizing the black laborer out of the
country, and, by precisely so much,
you will increase the demand for wages
for white labor.
But it is dreaded that the freed peo
pie will swarm forth and cover the
whole land. Will liberation make them
any more numerous? Equally distribu
ted amongthe whitesof the wholecoun
ty and there would be but one colored
to seven whites. Could the one in any
way greatly disturb the seven. There
are many communities now having
more thau one free colored person to
seven whites, and this without any ap
parently consciousness of evil from it.
The District of Columbia and the States
of Maryland and Deleware are all in
this condition. The District has more
than one free colored to six whites, and
yet in its frequent petitions to Congress,
I believe it has never nrpapntn.l tho
i
presence of free colored persons as one
of its grievances.
But why should emancipation in the
South send the freed people North ?
reopie ot any color seldom run, unless
. .
1 there 18 something to run frona.
Here
tofore colored people have fled North,
to some extent, from bondage, and now
perhaps from both bondage and desti
tution; but if gradual emacipation and
deportation be adopted, they will have
neither to flee from. Their own mas
ters will give them wages, at least till
now laborers can be procured, and the
freed men in turn will gladly give their
labor for wages, till new homes can be
jouna tor them in congenial climes,
and with people of their own blood and
race. This proposition can be trusted
on the mutual interests involved, and,
in any event, cannot the North decide
for itself whether to receive them.
Again as praticed proves more than
theory in any case, has there been any
irrnption northward because ef the ab
olishment of slavery in the District of
Columbia last spring ? What I have
said of the proportion of free colored
persons to the whites in the District of
Columbia is from the census of 1860,
having no reference to persons called
contrabands, nor to those made free by
the act of Congress abolishing slavery
here.
The plan consisting of these article!
is recommended, not but that a restora
tion of the national authority would be
accepted without its adoption, nor will
the war or proceedings under the pro
clamation of September 22d, 1862, be
stayed because of the recommendation
of this plan. Its timely adoptation I
doubt not would bring restoration, and
thereby stay both, and notwithstanding,
this plan.
The recommendation that Congress"
provides by law for compensating any
State which may adopt the emancipa
tion act before this plan shall have been
acted upon, is hereby earnestly re
newed. Such would only be an ad
vance part of the plan and the same ar
guments apply to both. This plan is
recommended as a means not in con
clusion of, but additional to all others
for restoring and preserving the nation
al authority throughout the Union. The
subject is presented exclusively in its
economical aspect.. The plan would, I
am confident, secure peace more speed
ily than can be done by force alone,
while it would cost lest considering
amonnts and manner of payment and
times of payment, and the amounts
would be easier paid than will be the
additional cost of the war if we rely
solely upon force. It is most likely
that it would cost no blood at all.
The plan is proposed as permanent
constitutional law. It cannot become
such without the concurrence, first, of
two-thirds of Congress, and afterwards
three-forlbs of the States. The requi
site three-quarters of the States will net-
essanly include seven of the slave States.
I f obtained, it will give assurance of
their severally adopting emancipation
at no distant day, on the new constitu
tional terms. This assurance would
end the struggle now, and save the-.
L'nion forever.
1 do not forget the gravity of a paper addressed
to the Congress of the nation, nor do 1 forgetthat
some few are mv seniors, or that many of you have
more experience than 1 in tbe conduct of public
alluirs.
Vet I trust that in view of the great responsibil
ity resting upon me, you will perceive no want of
respect to vourselves in any undue earnestness I
may seem to display.
Is it doubted then that the plan I propose, if
adopted, will shorten the war, and thus lessen its
expenditure of money and blood Is it doubted
that it would restore the national prosperity and
perpetuate both indefinitely ?
Is it doubted that if we here, Congress and Ex
ecutive, can secure its adoption, the good people
respond to a uuited and earnest appeal from us ?
Can we, can they by any other means so certain
ly or so speedily assure these vital objects ? We
can succeed ouly by concert.
It is not can any of us imagine better, but still
the question recurs, can we Jo "better ?
The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to
the stormy present. The occasion is piled high
with difficulty, und we must rise with the occasion.
As our case is new, so we must think and act anew;
we must disenthral ourselves, aud then we shall
save our country.
FeUow-citizens: We cannot escape history. We
of this Congress will be remembered in spite of
ourselves. No personal significance or insignifi
cance can spare one or another of us. The fiery
trial through which we pass will light us down in
honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We
say we are for the Union. The world will not for
get that while we say this, that we know how to
save the Union. The world knows we do know how
to save. We, even we, hold the power and bear
the responsibility.
In givingfreedom to the slave we insure freedom.
to the free. Honorable alike in what we give and
what we preserve, we shall nobly save or meanly
lose the last best hope of tbe earth.
Other means may succeed, this could not fail.
The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just, a way
which, if followed, the world will applaud, and Uodl
must forever bless.

Washington, Dec. 1, 1862.
Two Important Facts.
The New York Times calls attention
to two important facts, going to show
the constant superiority of the Eederal
power in the contest with the rebellion.
The first is, that, with the exception of
Sumter, the rebels have never gained a
single position by force of arms. All
the positions that came into their pos
session before or at the beginning of
the war, experienced that fate simply
because there was nobody to defend
them. The second fact is, that what
the rebels once lose they never regain.
In not a single instance since the war
opened, have they wrested back from
us a position of any account which we
nave once carried.
The Empire State Backs Down !'
New York has "caved in" on furnish
ing her quota of men for the war, eith
er by volunteering or drafting. She is
about 38,000 short. Relief will be
asked from Congress. What is the use
of having her Governor Morgan made
a Major General, if he cannot enforce
the requirement of the Federal Gov
ernment? Is he afraid of the Sey
mour secesh party ? The Empire
State ought to come up to the mark, or
else drop her proud title. Other States
have done their duty, and will continue
to do it, however great the sacrifice
may be.
