THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow citizens of the Senate and
Home of Representative! : In the midst
of unprecedented political iroubles, we
have great cause of gratitude to God for
unusual good health and abundant har
vests. OIK FOR El G.N RELATIONS.
You will not be surprised to learn that,
in the peculiar exigencies of the times,
our intercourse with foreign nations has
been attended with profound solicitude,
chiefly turning upon our own domestic
affairs. A disloyal portion of the Amer
ican people have during the whole year
been engaged in an attempt to divide and
destroy the Union. A nation which en
dures factions or domestic divisions is ex
possd to disrespect abroad, and one party,
if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to
invoke foreign intervention. Nations
thus tempted to interfere are not always
able to resist the counsels of seeming
expediency and ungenerous ambition, al
though measures adopted under such in
fluencet seldom fail to be unfortunate and
injurious to those adopting them.
The disloyal citizens of the United
States, who have offered the ruin of our
country in- retern for the aid and comfort
which they have invoked abroad, have
received less patronage and encourage
ment than they probably expected. If it
were just to suppose, as the insurgeants
have seemed to assume, that foreign na
tions, in this case discarding all moral,
social, and treaty obligations, would act
solely' and selfishly for the most speedy
restoration of commerce, including espe
cially the acquisition of cotton, those na
tions appear as yet not to have seen their
way to their object mors directly or clear
ly through tho destruction than through
the preservation of the Union. If we
could dare to believe that foreign nations
are actuated by no higher principle than
this, I am quite sure a sound argument
could be made to show them that they
can reach their aim more readily and
easily by aiding to crush this rebellion,
than by giving encouragement to it. The
principal lever relied upon by the inour
gents for inciting foreign nations to hos
tility against us, as already intimated, is
the embarrassment of commerce. Those
nations, however, it is not improbable
saw from the fust that it was (he Union
which made as well our foreign as our
domestic commerce. They can scarcely
have failed to perceive that tha effort for
disunion produces the existing difficulty,
and that one strong na'.iou promises more
durable peace and a more extensive and
reliable commerce than can the same na
tion brokeu into hostile fragments.
It is uot my purpose to review our
discussions with foreign states, because
whatever might be their wishes or dispo
sition, the iutegiity of our country and
the stability of our government depends
uot upon them, but upon the loyalty, vir
tue, patriotism, and intelligence of the
American people. The correspondence
itself, with the usual reservations, is
herewith transmitted. I venture to hope
it will appear that we have practiced
prudence and liberality towards foreign
powers, averting cause of irritation, and
with firmness maintaining our own rights
and honor.
DEFENSIVE PREPARATIONS
Since, however, it is apparent here as
in every other state, foreign dangers nec
essarily attend domestic difficulties, I
recommend that adequate and ample
measures be adopted for maintaining the
pubiio defenses on every side. While
under this general recommendation, pro
vision for defending the coast lino readily
occurs to the mind. I also, in the same
connection, ask the attention of Congress
to our great lakes and rivers. It is be
lieved that soma fortifications, with har
bor and navigation improvements at well
selected points, would be of great impor
tance to the national defense and preser
vation. I ask attention to the views of
the Secretary of War, expressed iu his
report upon the same general subject.
RAILWAY TROJBCT.
I deem it of importance that the loyal
regions of East Tennessee and Western
North Carolina should be connected with
Kentucky and other faithful parts of the
Union by railroad. I therefore recom
ville, or in some still different line, can
easily be determined. Kentucky and the
general government co-operating, the
work can be completed in a very short
time, and when done it will be, not only
of vast present usefulness, but also a val
uable permanent improvement, worth its
cost in all the future.

NEW TRKATIKS.
Some treaties designed chiefly for the
interests of commerce and having no
grave political importance, have been
negotiated and will be submitted to
the Senate for their consideration.
Although we have failed to induce
some of the commercial powers to
adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor
of maratime war, we have removed all
obstructions from the way of this humane
reform, except such as are merely of a
temporary nature.
THE CLAIMS AC.AINST CHINA.
I repeat tho recommendation of my
predecessor in his annua! message to
Congress in December last, in regard to
the disposition of the surplus which will
probably remain after satisfying the claims
of American citizens against China, pur
suant to the awards of the Commission
ers under the act of the 3d of March,!
1859. If, however, it should not be
deemed advisable to carry that recom
mendation into effect, I would suggest
that authority be given for investing the
principal over the proceeds of the sur
plus referred to in good securities, with a
view to the satisfaction of such other just
claims of our citizens against China as
are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the
course of our extensive trado with that
empire,
MILITARY COMMISSIONS TO MERCHANT
VESSELS.
By the act of the 5th of August last,
Congress authorized the President to in
struct the commanders of suitable vessels
to defend themselves against and to cap
ture pirates. This authority has been
exercised in a single instance only. For
the more effectual protection of our ex
tensive and valuable commerce in the
Kastern seas especially, it seems to me
that it would be advisable tu authorize
the commanders of sailing vessels to re
capture any prizes, which the pirates
may make of the United States vessels
and their cargoes, and the consular courts
established by law in Eastern countries,
to adjudicate the cases, in event that this
should not be objected to by the local
authorities.
RECOGNITION OF HAITI AND LIBERIA.
If any good reason exists why we
persevere longer in withholding our rec
ognition of the independence of Hay ti
and Liberia, I am unable to discern it.
I am unwilling, however, to inaugurate a
novel policy in retard to them without
the approbation of Congress. I submit
for your consideration the expediency of
an appropriation for maintaining a charge
d'affai res near each of these new States.
It does not admit of doubt that import
ant commercial advantages might be se
cured by favorable treaties with them.
NATIONAL FINANCKS.
The operations of the Treasury since
the period which has elapsed since your
adjournment have beeu conducted with
signal success. The patriotism of the
people has placed at the disposal of the
government the large means demanded
by the public exigencies. Much of the
national loan has been taken by citizens
of the industrial classes, whose confidence
in their country's faith, and zeal for their
country's deliverance from her present
peril, have induced them to contribute to
the support of the government the whole
of their limited acquisitions. This fact
imposes peculiar obligations to economy
in disbursements and energy in action,
The revenue from all sources, includ
ing loans, for the financial year ending
on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,
980 27 j and the expenditure for the
same period, including payments on ac
count of the pubiio debt, were $84,578,
034 47, leaving a balance in the treasury
on the 1st of July, 1861, of $2,257,065
80. For the first quarter of the finan
cial year, ending 30th September, 1861,
the receipts from all sources, including
the balance of July 1st, were $102,532,-
beyond the resources of a loyal people,
and to believe that the same patriotism
that has thus far sustained the govern
ment will continue to sustain it till peace
and Union shall again bless the land.
TUB ARMT.
I respectfully refer to the report
of the Secretary of War for infor
mation respecting the numerical strength
of the army, and for recommendations
having in view an increase of its efficien
cy and the well-being of the various
branches of the service entrusted to his
care. It is gratifying to know that the
oatriotism of the neonle has proved eo.ua!

to the occasion, and that the nnmber of rouml w,lu tnB clrcu" courl"' wou,u
create a court altogether too numerous
1830, to six millions one hundred and
fifty-one thousand four hundred and five,
in 1860. Besides this, the country gen
erally has outgrown our present judicial
system. If uniformity was at all intend
ed, the system requires thai all the states
shall be accommodated with circuit courts
attended by supreme judges, while in
fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,
Florida, Texas, California and Oregon,
have never had any such court. Nor
can this be well remedied without a
change of the system, because the adding
of judges to the supreme court, enough
for the accommodation of all parts of the
troops tendered greatly exceeds the force
which Congress authorized me to call in
to the field. I refer with pleasure to
those portions of his report which make
allusions to the creditable degree of dis
cipline already attained by our troops,
and to the excellent sanitary condition of
the entire army. The recommendation
of the secretary for an organization of
the militia upon a uniform basis, is a sub
ject of vital importance to the future safe
ty of the country, and is commended to
the serious attention of Congress. The
large addition to the regular army in
connection with the defection that has so
considerably diminished the number of
its officers, gives peculiar importance to
his recommendation for increasing the
corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of
the Military Academy.
CHAPLAINS FOR OOSPITALS.
By mere omission, I presume, Con
gress has failed to provide Chaplains for
the hospitals occupied by the volunteers.
This subject was brought to my notice,
and I was induced to draw up the form of
a letter, one copy of which properly ad
dressed has been delivered to each of the
persons, and at the dates respectively
named and stated in a schedule contain
ing also the form of the letter marked A,
and herewith transmitted. These gen
tlemen, I understand, entered upon the
duties designated at the times respective
ly stated in the schedule, nod Lava lu
bored faithfully therein ever since. I
therefore recommend that they be com
pensated at the same rates as chaplains
for a judicial body of any sort. And the
evil of it will be one that will increase
as new states come into the Union. Cir
cuit Courts are useful; if useful no state
should be denied them. If not useful no
state should have them ; let them be
provided for all or abolished to all.
Three modifications occur to me, either
of which I think, would be an improve
ment upon our present system. Let the
supieme court be of a convenient num
ber in every event. Then first let the
whole country be divided into circuits of
convenient size, the Supreme Judges to
serve in a number of thera correspond
ing to their own number, and indepen
dent circuit Judges to be provided for all
the rest ; or secondly, let the supreme
Judges be relieved from circuit duties,
and circuit Judges provided for all the
circuits ; or thirdly, dispense with circuit
courts altogether, leaving the judicial
functions wholly to the district courts and
an independent supreme court.

general provision be made for chaplains
to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments.
TUE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the
Navy presents in detail the operations of
that branch of the service, the activity
and energy which have characterized its
administration, and the results of the
measures to increase its eflioiency and
power. Such have been the additions
by construction and purchase, that it
may almost be said that a navy has been
created and brought into service since
our difficulties commenced. Besides
CODIFICATION OF THE STATUTE LAWS.
I respectfully recommend to the con
sideration of Congress the present con
dition of the statute laws, with the hope
that Congress will be able to find an easy
remedy for many of the inconveniences
and coils which constantly embarrass
those engaged in the practical adminis
tration of them. Since the organization
of the Government, Congress baa enacted
some five thousand acts and joint resolu
tions, which fill more than six thousand
closely printed pages, and are scattered
through many volumes. Many of these
acts hare been drawn in haste and with
out sufficient caution, so that their pro
visions are often obscure in themselves,
or in conflict with each other, or at least
so doubtful as to render it very difficult
for even the best informed persons lo as
certain precisely what the statute law
really is. It seems to me very impor
tant that the statute laws should be made
as plain and intelligent as possible, and
be reduced to as small a compass as may
consist with the fullness and precision of
the will of the legislature and the perspi
cuity of its language. This, well done,
would, I think, greatly facilitate the la
bors of those whose duty it is to assist in
blockading our extensive coast, fl"'- the administration of the laws, and would
rons, larger thin ever before assembled j be ft ,asting bene(it (Q ,ie peopa by pa(.
ing before them in a more accessible and
intelligible form, the laws which so deep
gress provide for the construction of such
a road as speedily as possible. Kentucky
will, do doubt, co-operate, and, through
her legislature, make the most judicious
selection of a line. The Northern busi
ness must connect with some existing
railroad, and whether the route shall be
from Lexington or Nicholasville to the
Cumberland gap, or from Lebanon to the
1 rnnr sre jinif i:i the direction of Knox-
leaving a balance on the 1st of October,
1861, of $4,292,776 18. Estimates for
the remaining three quarters of the year,
and for the financial year of 1862, to
gether with bis views of the ways and
means for meeting the demands contem
plated by thera, will be submitted to you
by the Secretary of the treasury. It is
gratifying to know that the expenses
mRdc necesary by the rebellion am n;t
under our flag have been put afloat, and
performed deeds which have increased
our naval renown. I would invite spe
cial attention to tho recommendation of
the secretary for a mora perfect organ!
zation of the navy by introducing ad
ditional grades in the service. The pre
sent organization is defective and unsat
isfactory, and the suggestions submitted
by the department will, it is believed, if
adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to,
promote harmony and increase the ef
ficiency of the navy.
TIIK SUPREME COURT.
Thr.re are three vacancies on tha
bench of the Supreme Court two by
the decease of Justices Daniel aud Mc
Lean, and one by the resignation of Jus
tice Campbell. I have so far forbore
making nominations to fill the vacancies,
for reasons which I will now state: Two
of the outgoing Judges resided within
the states now overrun by revolt, so that
if successors were appointed in the same
localities, they could not now serve upon
their circuits, and many of the most com
petent men there, probably, would not
take the personal hazard of accepting to
serve, even here, upon the Supreme
Bench. I have been unwilling to throw
all the appointments northward, thus dis
abling myself from doing justice to the
South on the return of peace, although I
may remark that to transfer to the North
one which has heretofore been in the
South, would not, with reference to ter
ritory and population, be unjust.
During the long and brilliant career
of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into
an empire, altogether too large for any
one judge to give the courts therein more
than a nominal atteudance, rising in pop
ulation from ona million four hundred
seventy thousand and eighteen, to
ly concern their interests and their du
ties. I am informed by some whose
opinions I respect, that all the acts of
Congress now in force, and of a perma
nent and general nature, might be re
vised aud re-written, so as to be embrac
ed in one volume, or at least two volumes
of ordinary and convenient size, and I
respectfully recommend to Congress to
consider the subject, aod if my sugges
tion be approved, to devise such plan as
to their wisdom shall seem most proper
for the attainment of the end proposed.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE
INSURGENT STATES.
One of the unavoidable consequences
of the present insurrection is the entire
suppression in many places of all ordina
ry means of administering civil justice by
the officers and iu the forms of existing
law. This is the case in the whole or in
part of all the insurgent states, and as
our armies advance upon and take pos
session of parts of ihose states, the prac
tical evil becomes more apparent. There
are no courts nor officers to whom the
citizens of other states may apply for the
enforcement of their lawful claims against
citizens of the insurgent states, and there
is a vast amount of debt, constituting such
claims some have estimated it as high
as two hundred millions of dollars due
in large part from insurgents in open re
bellion to loyal citizens, who are even
now making great sacrifices in discharge
of their patriotic duty to support the
government. Under these circumstances
I have been urgently solicited to estab
lish by military power, courts to admin
ister sumary justice in such cases. I
have thus far declined to do it, not be-1
cause I had any doubt that the end pro
posed, the collection of the debts, was
just and right in itself, but because I have
been unwilling to go beyond the pressure
of necessity in the unusual exercise of
power. But the powers of Congress, I
suppose, are equal to the anomalous occa
sion, and therefore I refer the whole
matter to Congress, with the hope that a
plan may be devised for the administra
tion of justice in all such parts of the in
surgent states and territories as may be
under the control of the government,
wheliser by a voluntary return to allegi
ance and order, or by the power of our
arnts. This, however, is not to be a per
manent institution, but a temporary sub
stitute, and to cease as soon as the Courts
can be re-established iu peace.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
It is important that some more con
venient means should be provided, if
possible, for the adjustment of claims
against the government, especially in
view of their increased number, by rea
son of the war. It is as much the duty
of the government to render prompt jus
tice against itself in favor of its citizens,
as it is to administer the sam3 between
private individuals. The investigation
and adjudication of claims in their nature
belong to the judicial department. Be
sides it is apparent that the attention of
Congress will be more than usually en
gaged for some timo to como with the
great national questions. It was intend
ed by the organization of the Court of
Claims mainly to remove this branch of
business from the halls of Congress, but
while the court has proved to be an effec
tive and valuuble means of investigation,
it in a great degree fails to effect the ob
ject of its creation, for want of power to
make its judgments final. Fully aware
of the delicacy, not lo say danger of the
subject, I commend to your careful con
sideration whether this power of making
judgment final may not properly be given
to the court, reserving the right of appeal
in questions of law to the Supreme Court,
wiih such other provisions as experience
may have shown to be necessary.
THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
I ask attention to the report of the
Postmaster General, the following being
a summary statement of the condition of
the department. The revenue from all
sources during the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1861, including the annual
permanent appropriation of $700,000 for
the transportation of free mail matter,
was $9,049,296 40, being about two ppr
cent, less than the revenue for I860.
The expenditures were thirteen millions
six hundred and six thousand seven hun
dred and fifty-nine dollars and eleven
cents showing a decrease of more than
eight percent, as compared with those of
the previous year, and leaving an excess
of expenditures over the revenue for the
last fiscal year of over live hundred and
fifty-seven thousand four hundred and
ixty-two dollars and seventy-one cents.
The gross revenue for the year ending
June 30, 1803, is estimated at an in
crease of four per cent, on that of 1801,
making eight millions, six hundred and
eighty-three thousand dollars, to which
should be added the earnings of the de
partment in carrying free matter, viz. :
seven hundred thousand dollars, making
nine millions three hundred and eighty
three thousand dollars. The total expen
ditures for 1863 are estimated at twelve
millions five hundred and twenty-eight
thousand dollars, leaving a deficiency of
three millions one hundred and forty-five
thousand dollars to be supplied from the
treasury in addition to the permanent
appropriation.
TUB BOUNDARIES OF TUE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
The present insurrection shows, I think
that the extension .ot the district across
the Potomac River at the time of estab
lishing the cupitol here, was eminently
wise, and consequently that the relin
quishment of that portion of it which lies
within the State of Virginia, was unwise
and dangerous. I submit for your con
sideration the expediency of reclaiming
that part of the district, and the restora
tion of the original boundaries thereof
through negotiations with the State of
Virginia.
OPERATIONS OF THE INTERIOR DEPART
MENT. The report of the Secretary of the
Interior, with the accompanying docu
ments, exhibit the condition o! the sev
eral branches of the public business per
taining to thtt department. The depress
ing influence of the insurrection lias been
especially felt in the operations of the
Patent and General Land offices. The
cash receipts from the sales of the public
lunds during the past year have exceed
ed the expenses of our hind system onls
about two hundred thousand dollars.
The sales have been entirely suspended
in the Southern States, while the inter
ruptions to the business of the country,
and the diversion of large numbers of
men from labor to military service, have
obstructed settlements in the new States
and Territories of the Northwest. The
receipts of the Patent Office have decli
ned in nine months about $100,000, ren
dering a largu reduction of the force
employed, necessary to make it self-sustaining.
The demands upon the pension office
will be largely increased by the insurrec
tion. Numerous applications for pen
sions, based upon the casualties of the
existing war have already been made.
There is reason to believe that many who
are now upon the pension roll and in
receipt of the bounty of the government,
are in the ranks of the insurgent army
or giving them aid and comfort. The
Secretary of tho Interior has directed
the suspension of the payment of the
pensions of such persons, upon proof of
their disloyally. I recommend that Con
gress authorize that officer to cause the
names of such persons to be stricken
from the pension roll.
countries when the federal officers arrived
there. The abundant natural resources
of these territories, with the security and
protection afforded by organized govern
ment, will doubtless invite to them, a
large immigration when peace shall re
store the business of tho country to its
accustomed channels. I submit the res
olutions of (he legislature of Colorado,
which evidence the patriotic spirit of the
people of the territory. So far the au
thority of the United States has been,
upheld in all tho territories, as it is hoped
it will be in the future. I commend thesa
interests and their defense to the gener
ous care of Congress.
THE INDIAN TRIBES.
The relations of the government with
tha Indian tribes have been greatly dis
turbed by the insurrection, especially in
the Southern Superinlendency and that
of New Mexico. The Indian country
south of Kansas is in possession of the
insurgents from Texas and Arkansas.
The agents of '.he United States appoint
ed since the 4th of March for this Super
inlendency have been unable to reach
their posts, while the most of those who
were in office before that time have es
poused the insurrectionary cause, and
assume to exercise the powers of agents
by virtue of commissions from the insur
rectionists. It has been staled in the
public press that a portion of these Indi
ans have been organized as a military
force, and are attached to the army of
ihe insurgents. Although the govern
ment has no official information upon the
subject, letters have been written to the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs by sev
eral prominent chiefs, giving assurance of
their loyalty to the United States, and
expressing a mish for the presence of
tho federal troops to protect them. It is
believed that upon the possession of Ihe
country by the federal forces, the Indians
will readily cease all hostile demonstra
tions and resume their former relations
to the government. I
TllF. AGlilCULTUItAI. AND STATISTICAL
BUREAU.
Agriculture, confessedly the largest
interest of the nation, has not a depart
ment nor a bureau, but a clerkship only
is assigned to it in the government.
While it is fortunate that this great in
terest is so independent in its nature as
not to have demanded and expected more
from the government, I repectfully ask
Congress to consider whether something
more cannot be given voluntarily with
general advantage. Annual reports, ex
hibiting the condition of our agriculture,
commerce, and manufactures, would pre
sent a fund of information of great prac
tical value to the country. While I
make no suggestion as to details, I ven
ture the opinion that an Agricultural
and Statistical Bureau might profitably
be organized.
THE AFRICAN SLATE TRADE.
The execution of the laws for the
suppression of the African slave trade,
has been confided to the Department of
the Interior. It is a subject of congrat
ulation that the efforts which have been
made for the suppression of this inhuman
traffic Lave recently been attended with
unusual success. Five vessels being fit
ted out for the slave trade have been
seized and condemned. Two mates en
gaged in the trade and one person en
gaged in equipping a vessel as a slaver,
have been convicted and subjected to the
penalty of fine and imprisonment, and
one captain taken with a cargo of Afri
cans on board his vessel has been convict
ed of the highest grade of offense under
our laws, the punishment of which is
death.
THE TERRITORIES.
The territories of Colorado, Dacotab,
aud Nevada, created by the last Congress,
have been organized, and civil adminis
tration has been inaugurated therein un
der auspices especially gratifying, when
it is considered that the leaven of treason
was found existing In some of these new
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
I recommend to the favorable consid
eration of Congress the interest of the
District of Columbia. The insurrection
has been the cause of much suffering
and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as
they have no reprefentative in Congifcss,
that body should not overlook their just
claims upon the government.
THE WORLD'S FAIR.
At your late session a joint resolution
was adopted, authorizing the President
to take measures for facilitating a proper
representation of the industrial interest
of the United States at the Exhibition of
Industry of all nations, to be holden at
London in the year 1862. I regret to
say I have been unable to give personal
attention to this subject, a subject at once
so interesting in itself, and so extensively
and intricately connected with the mate
rial prosperity of the woild. Through
the Secretaries of Slate aud of the In
terior, a plan or system has been devised
and partly matured, which will be laid
before you.
DISPOSAL OF CONTRABANDS COLONI
ZATION RECOMMENDED.
Under and by virtue of the act of
Congress entitled "An act to confiscate
property used for insurrectionary pur
poses," approved August 6, 1861, the
legal claims of certain other persons have
become forfeited, and numbers of the
latter, thus liberated are already depen
dent on the United States, and must be
provided for in some way. Besides this,
it is not impossible that some of the
Xtales will pass similar enactments for
their own benefits respectively, and by
the operations of which persons of the
same class will be thrown upon them for
disposal. In such case I recommend
tWat Congress provide for accepting such
persons from such States according to
some mode of valuation in lieu porlanto
of direct taxes, or upon some other plan
to be agreed on with such stales respec
tively, that such persons or such accept
ance by the General Government be at
once deemed free, and that in any event,
steps be taken for colonizing both classes,
or the one first mentioned, if the other
one shall not be brought into existence,
at some place or places in a climate con
genial to them. It might be well to con
sider, too, whether the free colored peo
ple already in the United States could
not, so far as individuals may desire, be
included in such colonization. To carry
out the plan of colonization may involve
the acquiring of territory, and also tha
appropriation of money beyond that to
be expended in the territorial acquisition.
Having practiced the acquisition of ter
ritory for nearly sixty years, the question
ot constitutional power to do so is no
longer an open one with u. The power
was first questioned by Mr. Jefferson,
who, however, in the purchase of Louisi
ana, yielded his scruples on the plea of
great expediency. If it be said that ths
only legitimate object of acquiring terri
tory is to furnish homes for white men,
this measure effects that object, for the
emigration of colored men leaves ad
ditional room for the white men remain
ing or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, how
ever, placed the importance of procuring
Louisiana more on political and commer
cial grounds than on providing room for
population. On this whole proposition,
including the appropriation of money
with the acquisition of territory, doea not
the expediency amount to actual neces
sity ; that without which the government
cannot be perpetuated, the war contin
uing. THE SUPPRESSION OF THK RFBILLION.
In considering the policy to be adopted
for suppressing the insurrection I have
been anxious and careful that the inevit
able conflict for this purpose shall not
degenerate into a violent aud remorseless
revolutionary struggle. I have, there
fore, in every case thought it proper to
keep the integrity of the Union promi
nent as the primary object of the contest
on our part, leaving all questions which
are not of vital military importance to
the more deliberate action of tho legisla-
