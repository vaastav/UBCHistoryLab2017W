THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's big stick has been wielded officially for probab
ly the last time and he has hurled his -words of denunciation broadcast.
He asks for a continuation of "my policies," which a year ago shook the bus
iness world of this nation and incidentally the whole world. He takes up
a great deal of space in his last message with criticism of the courts and
intimates that there is need for reform there. The last session of congress
comes up for force caustic raps, as do the railroads. The message is alto
gether Rooseveltian. It is characteristic of the president and as many of
those in high position read it, they will sigh with relief as they reflect that
Mr. Roosevelt will not be president after the fourth of March. Much of
what the message contains has been said before, but it comes again .with
the hammerlike blows of a series of amazing documents that Mr. Roose
velt has given to the nation. His critics will have ample room in the mes
sage to use plenty of vitriol in denouncing certain parts of it and his ad
mirers can find just as much to praise.

PLAYING AT WAR.
Whenever the federal government orders the army or navy to take part
in war manouvres, there is always a loud protest from a hundred sources,
against the expense incurred. Playing at the game, of war is not altogether
a new undertaking, but it still too much of an innovation to be appreciated
by the rank and file of persons who know nothing about the army and
navy. Demonstrations have proved that all the drilling and practicing that
can be done, do not equal the war manouvres on land and sea. It is true
that it is an expensive business but it must be remembered that our fight
ing forces represent a tremendous yearly expenditure and that they are
worthless unless prepared for any emergency at a moment's notice. This
country has now provided itself with a fleet of warships that is excelled
only by one other nation. It would be a case of penny wise and pound
foolish. for us to curtail the legitimate expense of maintaining it as it
should be and deny it the same advantages as enjoyed by other navies.
HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
DANGEROUS TEACHERS.
The writer's attention recently has
been called to certain peripatetic
"teachers" who are said to be exploit
ing the doctrine that it is sinful for
men and women to live with one an
other in any other way save that of
"the spiritual life."
Beware of these wolves in sheep's
clothing!
They have broken up many happy
homes.
The best advice one can give is this:
Should this sort try to make disciples
in your community see that they are
sent away.
Charlatans of this kind have ruined
homes in many places.
They peddle a kind of cult that ap
peals at the first blush to Intellectual
persons, women in particular. After
ward, when the disciple Is believed to
be "strong in the faith," the inner
teaching Is revealed.
There is much talk of "exoteric and
"esoteric" teaching, the outside for the
world, the inside for the faithful.
First comes the piously put declara
tion that "the life of the spirit" Is the
only true life.
Then comes the Inner teaching the
delicate suggestion of "spiritual affinities."
And then destruction.
It may seem strange that sensible
people should become devotees of these
cults and be victimized by apostles of
such teaching, but It should be remem
bered
Every normal human being is hun
gry for spiritual food. The craving is
just as keen as that of the physical
appetite. And the appetite itself is
not always the most accurate Judge of
what is best.
The fads exploited by many of the
long haired itinerants are not danger
ous. They are for the most part sub
limely silly. But
There is a specious plea that does
attack the heaven ordained relations
of husband and wife and that leads
to HELL. ON EARTH.
Thousands of poor derelicts on the
sea of life have been wrecked and set
adrift by pious pirates.
Society needs to keep an eye on
dangerous social Interlopers who mas
querade in the guise of religious
prophets.
Whenever and wherever the sanctity
of family life Is imperiled by the prop
aganda of any preacher, prophet, me
dium, professor or what not

Some facetious reader, who we fancy is trying to be a little sarcastic
at our expense, pleads for the remedy for success. Well, it is just this
way: You have to be a sort of a second sight phenom. Never be caught
napping and always be there with the goods. WThile the other fellow is
thinking how he will play the game just fall to and trim him with beautiful
completeness. Be prepared. Some folks are too prone to wait until the
thing happens before they act. That's the down and out policy. The
thing is to act before the thing happens. If a coarse man threatens to dis
locate your headpiece and you are sure he'll do it, don't leave it all to

Which is a good brand of success.
A YEAR AGO the real estate market in Lake county was quiescent. It
was even worse than that in some parts of the county ; it was dead. Now,
that prosperity has recovered sufficiently to get up and take notice, the
real estate market has come out of the cyclone cellar and is getting busy.
The story of the activity of real estate in Hamond will be hailed with joy
in business circles. Twenty-four lots have been sold in one addition for a
sum aggregating ten thousand dollars and the addition is a new one and
has not been advertised as yet except in the columns of the TIMES.
THERE IS A GANG of young toughs and boors who attend Hammond
theaters and who for years have succeeded in making life miserable for
the patrons of playhouses. It is a common thing for some of them to be
yanked out of the gallery and ejected. This is not enough. The toughs
laugh at this. They should be marched down to the police station and
jailed and then subjected to a heavy fine and a few days sojourn in the
prison at Crown Pofht. That is the lesson that the smart Aleck needs.

A green leather case containing $15,000 worth of jewels belonging to Mrs.

office yesterday afternoon and found an hour later in an elevator shaft, where
It had been thrown by the thief. City and railroad detectives attempted to
find the robber without success.
The only unexplained feature of the affair is whether the robber was one
of the employes of the railroad or an expert "dip" who worked his way Into
the baggage room unnoticed. The latter view Is taken by the railroad officials.
Mrs. Martin was about to take the Twentieth Centory Limited for New
