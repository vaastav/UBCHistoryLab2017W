Andrew Carnegie is to g-ive $10,000,
000 to the cause of university exten

ment of this great gift to education
will be made at the White House on

few- days ago and took luncheon with
President Roosevelt, when details of
the plan were fully discussed.
Mr. Carnegie has thought best to
create a national board to handle this
munificent benefaction. President
Roosevelt will probably name such a
board for Mr. Carnegie, or at least
set in motion the machinery which
shall lead to a national organization.
Mr. Carnegie is expected here Tues
day, and fuller details of this gi
gantic enterprise will soon become
public.

succeeded Seth Low at the head of

tional organization is to have its
headquarters in Washington, but its
operations are to extend throughout
the United States, the work to be car

White Sulphur Springs, Mont., Dec.
9. The fate of George Hayes and a
party of three prospectors who left
here to prospect in the Philippines, in
1S99, has been revealed in a letter
just received in this city. The party
has been missing since March, 1900,
and every effort to locate the miners
lias been futile up to this time. Rev.
J. C. Lenhart, formerly a minister at
Hawaii, residing at Manila, was in
duced by friends of the missing men
to take up the search. Diligent in
quiry on his part disclosed the fact
that the party, disregarding the
warnings of the military not to ven
ture beyond their lines of defense,
had gone into the mountains of cen
tral Luzon. Later the bodies of th-i
four men were found literally
chopped to pieces by bolomen. The
heads and arms were severed from
the bodies and the bodies were other
wise horribly mutilated. Hayes and
James Brown were identified by pa
pers they had upon their persons.

I'nir Anion); the AitiaticM.
St. Louis. Dec. 9. The orient is
awakening to the importance of the
World's fair in St. Louis in 1903.
China has already formally accept
ed the invitation, and the officials of
north and south China have received
their instructions to proceed with
the preparations for the exhibits at
St. Louis.
Communications direct from the
Corean officials and from prominent
Americans in Seoul indicate that
Corea will furnish a most attractive
exhibit, beneficial to itself and in
structive to Americans.
The American minister to Tokio,
Hon. A. E. Buck, writes encouraging
ly about Japan. He says he is doing
all in his power to advance the inter
est of the World's fair with the Japa
nese government. Kogoro Takahira,
the Japanese minister at Washing
ton, and Toshire Fujita, Japanese
consul at Chicago, write that they
have made strong ofheial representa
tions to their governments in favor
of the World's fair. Letters from
Hon. E. C. Bellows, United States con
sul general at Yokohama, state that
the coining session of the Japanese
parliament will probably consider
favorably the question of making an
appropriation.
Similar reports come from the
United States minister at Bangkok.
These point to a first-class exhibit on
the part of Slam at the exposition.
The king and the minister of foreign
affairs have expressed a high degree
of interest. There is also a strong
probability that the king of Siam.
Chulalonkorn I., one of the ablest
statesmen of Asia, will visit the Unit
ed States in 1903 and make the
World's fair his objective point.
Regarding India, a long letter from
THE FLORIDA.
United States Consul General R. F.
Patterson, at Calcutta, has been re
ceived. It is to the effect that the
leading chambers of commerce of In
dia are taking up the matter of the
World's fair and developing plans for
a worthy participation at St. Louis.
It is also expected that the viceroy,
Lord Curzon, will give his support to
the movement.
The consul general at Singapore,
Straits Settlement, O. F. Williams,
writes that he has made recommen
dations to the sultan of the Malay
states asking them to participate in
the World's fair, and that he is quite
hopeful of good results.
The American consul at Auckland,
Frank Dillingham, writes that he lias
laid the matter before the New Zea
land cabinet, and that he is endeav
oring to forward the interests there
to tlu end that New Zealand will
not only erect a building, but will
send an exhibit which will surprise
the people of the United States in re
spect to New Zealand's resources and
possibilities.

Ayres On the Fatal Mtflit.
Washington. Dec. 9. Judge Ander
son, before whom Mrs. Lola Ida
Ilonine is being tried for the murder
of James Seymour Ayres, Jr., sus
tained the objection of the district
attorney to the hypothetical ques
tions submitted to Dr. Carr, an ex
pert, on Saturday. The court stated
that to admit the question as put
would only cloud the situation and
embarrass instead of instruct the
jury. The question was reframed and
the witness answered that in his
opinion the location of the" hip
wound, such as received by Ayres,
could not be materially influenced in
its hight or direction by the fact that
deceased was or was not walking or
running. Dr. Carr was on the stand
during a major portion of the day,
his testimony relating manly to the
relative positions of Mrs. Bonine and
Ayres when the killing took place.

mated production of gold in the Unit
ed States during the calendar j'ear

TENNESSEE STATE NEWS
State Finance.
With the retirement of six small
konds purchased yesterday hy State
Treasurer Folk, the State Funding
Board has bought and cancelled
bonds to the amount of ?597,400. Of
this amount $223,600 were purchased
under the administration of Former
Treasurer Craig and $373,S0O under
Mr. Folk's administration.
The funding act was passed by the
General Assembly of 1S99 and went
into effect January 1, 1900. It re
quires the Comptroller to credit the
sinking fund with 10 per cent, of
monthly receipts, not including that
derived from maintenance of convicts,
and provides that all funds in the
treasury on the first of each January
that are not needed to meet outstand
ing indebtedness, or are not other
wise appropriated, shall also be cred
ited to this fund. The last General
Assembly passed an act amending
this, giving the funding board au
thority to anticipate any surplus and
to use general funds for the purchase
of bonds. The board has already
done this by using $170,000 of the
general funds with which to retire
bonds.
Besides the bonds that have been
cancelled the board has taken up $850,
000 floating debt, making nearly a
million and a half that has been
spent in this direction during tha
past three years.
State Asked to Offer Reward.
Citizens of Dyer county have made
application to the Governor for a re
ward for the arrest and conviction of
the three men who attempted to rob

twice without blowing. The shots at

zens, who, on going to the bank to
investigate the matter, had a pistol
battle with the burglars, who escaped
unhurt. The damage to the vault and
bank building was $1,200, and officers
of the bank have offered a reward of
$500 for the apprehension of the bur
glars. Murderer Seeks Release.
Dock Martin, colored, recently sen
tenced to hang by the Criminal Court
at Clarksville, charged with murder
ing his wife, has, through his attor
neys, applied to Judge Bell of the Cir
cuit Court for a writ of habeas cor
pus against Sheriff Stafford. Martin
seeks to secure his release on tha
ground that the act of the last Ten
nessee Legislature establishing the
Montgomery County Criminal Court
was unconstitutional, and therefore
he is being held and was convicted
of murder by an unconstitutional trib
unal. Martin's case is now pending
before the Supreme Court.
