THE RETAIL GROCER
WAS DOING A THRIVING BUSI
NESS INSAN ANTONIO UNTIL
LANDED ON BY THE GOVERN
MENT AGENTS
Herald Special
San Antonio Texas Dec G Gov
ernment officers at the instance of
the postoffice inspectors have broken
up the San Antonio cowboy factory
which for the past two weeks has
been doing a land office business all
over the United States For 2 ac
cording to the advertisement of the
Factory real cowboys would be
made and placed on the great Rin
con Ranch The receipts o the
Factory from aspirants for the
whirling lariat and the life on the
lange according to the United States
marshals office reached several
mndred dollars a day
The Factory comprised one man
Carl Smith who had an office on Sole
dadstreet A piinted letter distrib
uted and mailed by agents of Smith
in the large cities especially in the
not tli and east served to bring in
the dollars The letter read in sub
stance that the great Rincon Ranch
near San Antonio as a matter of
fact there Is no such ranch was in
need of additional cowboys and that
energetic strong young men differ
ent from the old fashioned Texas cow
boy were needed Good wages and
comfortable quarters in addition to
the fascination of a life in the open
wilh all the adventures and pleasures
of the range were the inducements
Air Smith in his letters distributed
in Ghicago approached the prospect
ive cowboy in this language
Your railroad fare will be in the
neighborhood of 3000 from ChicagoT
We are so in need of cowboys that we
are willing to advance you your rail
vroad fare by return mail after we
receive from you a remittance of 2
as an evidence of good faith on your
part Send me the 2 and I will send
you ticket from Chicago to San An
tonio
The idea of a cowboy factory say
the government officers after a talk
with Smith who is lodged in the
Bexar county jail originated in the
interest maidens In the north are
evincing in Texas cowboys Governor
Cairipbell of Texas and Postmaster J
J Stevens daily receive scores of let
ters asking them to furnish the names
of cowboys eligible as husbands The
idea q a cowboy factory then occur
red upon the publication recently of
some letters to the young man on
Soledad street From the way in
which his letters met with 2 re
sponses it is evident there are many
youths whose ambition is to ride the
range and punch cattle While the
cowboy is still an institution in South
west Texas he has practically disap
peared from the vicinity of San An
tonio the cutting up of the large cat
tle ranches into farms relegating him
to the pages of fiction or history or
driving him to the still remaining
large ranches in Northwest Texas

In Picking Appointees to United

Senate Disagreeable
Herald Special
Washington D C Dec 6 A dif
ficult task seems to confront President
Taft in his effort to pick appointees
to the United States supreme court
The senate progressives have the
power to tie up the appointments and
it is known that none of those so far
mentioned are acceptable to them
Judge Alexander P Humphrey demo
crat of Louisville Ky is the latest
name to leceive serious consideration
from the president in this connection
and he would be acceptable to the mi
nority members of the senate He is
a prominent lawyer and when Taft
became president Humphrey was
