WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 7, 1921. :
Settlement of the Irish Question.
On June 22, when the controversy!
wafc most bitter over the Irish ques-'
Hon, King Georoe made a remark-1
rble speech at the opening of the1
Northern Parliament in Belfast. He<
was speaking not merely to the
l lstermen within the sound of his
oice but to all Ireland when
ho said:
"T appeal to all Irishmen to pause, I
to etretoh out the hand of forbearing
and conciliation, to forgive and 1
to forget, and to Join in making for !
the land which they love a new era
of peace, contentment and good will."
And when the King said that it
was his earnest desire "that in Soutli rn
Ireland, too, there may ere long
akc place a parallel to what is now
passing in this hall," there was left
no doubt of the Crown's belief that
he situation, desperate as it then appeared.
was not beyond hope.
We may well accept the King's
peech as the very beginning oS the
hapter which has closed so happily.
He had struck a note higher, clearer
nd more human than any of his
'rime Minister's utterances, for he
was speantng not as me leaaer 01 a
omporary Government hut as the
end of a vast empire. Irishmen remembered
that speech months aftercard
when hope of a settlement
remed to be drowning in a sea of
'echnicalities. They remembered it
gain on Monday night when, as the
last glimmer of peace seemed to fade,
be King again summoned Mr. Lloyd
'Ikoroe for a conference which was
oon followed by an agreement beween
the Government and the Sinn
"'eln representatives.
So. assuming that this is the end
if seven centuries of her bitterness.
Ireland has much to thank King
horct: for. He saw. with an. 1m ifrial
vision reminiscent of his
ather. the chance that had come, the
hance that was slipping, the chance
hat might never come again or come
nly after more and futile years of
rebellion and bloodshed: and he
anH tnnl. if This as lie
saw it, was the great opportunity?
not merely for England or for either
~nd of Ireland but for all of the
British Empire and all of the world.
An for Lloyd George, none will
minimize the task he undertook, the
-tubhornness with which he perseuted
it or the wonderful patience
h? displayed at trying moments.
There were times, such as his speech
t Carnarvon, when he seemed almost
willing to throw the whole
problem hack into chaos; but there
were other times when his temperate
'reatnient of exasperating situations
-aved what ground had been gained.
His exchange of notes with Mr. Dr
Valera in August and September is
one of the most remarkable exhibits
of dialectic fencing in diplomatic
history. Had the rremicr been less
patient the whole structure of peace
negotiation would have fallen.
Mr. De Valf.ra and his associates
most of them more Irish in blood and
characteristics than himself, must be
congratulated upon obtaining for
Ireland the status of a "free state."
There could he, at least In this generation.
no Irish republic. De Va11.ra
Knew that. He tacitly admitted
li when, at the close of his long and
dexterous correspondence with Llotp
OnoRTiK. he accepted the Prime Minister's
invitation to a coftfereace
'with a view to ascertaining how
me association of Ireland with the
community of nations known as the
British Empire may hest he reconciled
with Irish national aspirations."
That quoted phrase was Limn
?ifXJHOt.'s, Ingeniously designed to
; moofh over the delicate situation.
And that phrase very well describes
ihe outcome of the negotiations. Ire
land's national aspirations are reeog
nisod. She is not a republic, but she ip
a free state with powers practically
like those of the existing Dominions
She is winning more than O'Cowr.u
r Or vita* dreamed of achieving f<c.
her. She Is to have liberty In
greater than Pvknui or Rkdmouc
ever hoped for. She does not become
a separate Power, but she attains the
dignity of association with the Brit
ieh Empire.
As the agreement stands there is a
trtnlted Ireland. It lies with tHste>
i to say w hether it shall remain uuitec
j or he divided. The Ulster problem
which seemed as baffling as that ol
! the South, finds a solution which can
uot offend Ulster's dignity. She h
I not to be coerced. If she chooses sh<
may go her own way and content
herself with such pqwers as she hai
now; powers with which she has pro
leased to be satisfied. It is up to th<
South of Ireland, In its desire for s
united Ireland, to persuade theNortl
not to sever the bond.
Here, then, is a victory in whict
none is vanquished. Here is the first
real peace in a war which has ragec
for centuries and spread far beyonc
the islands of the principals. It
ought to be encouraging to the whoh
world, which seeks peace every
where, to see the seemingly lmpos
sible come true.
President Harding's Message.
President Hahdi^o delivered t.c
v wiiRicoa vcoiciuajr a inconaf>rr nunu,
of remarkable interest throughout
has four high peaks of Importance
These are his recommendations as tc
national control of strikes and other
forms of industrial war, establishment
of organized and cooperative
selling and distributing agencies foi
the farmers, support of American
[shipping without discriminating du
ties against foreign bottoms, and a
provision for an elastic tariff system
capable of meeting special emergen
t ies or abnormal conditions without
the uncertainties, disadvantages and
dangers of the so-called American
valuation scheme.
The President's stand as to the
control of both parties to Industrial
warfare is so Just in its conception
and so clear in its logic that the
American public can be counted for
it whether the present Congress shall
be or not. "When he says there should
be no question as to the right oi
labor to organize, to bargain collec
tively and to act together in other
ways, he says no more of it than he
says of organized capital and no more
than is a legal fact as to organized
capital. When he says organized la
aa anoh should not be nermit
ted to conduct itself to the injury ol
the general public again he says nc
more of it than he says of organized
I capital and also no more than is s
! legal fact as to organized capital.
And there is nobody that will fai
to recognize the simplicity and forc?
I of his parallel between the world now
| seeking for its self-protection suit
able procedure to adjust difference;
! among nations without recourse t<
| war and the country also seeking
for its self-protection to adjust dif
ferences between organized labor ant
; organized capital "without resort t<
| those forms of warfare which w<
recognize under the name of strikes
j lockouts, boycotts and the like."
In the matter of the agricultura
problem it is plain to see that th<
President's heart is fervently witl
! the nation's tillers of the soil, wh
labor through the year to feed th
nation, only to find after the harves
that it is worth little or nothing ti
those who produced it by the swea
j of their brow.
When Mr. Harping bespeaks for th
i farmers of the United States a nn
tionally encouraged cooperative ma;
i keting programme he suggest
something which Tun Nkw Yori
Herald feels is as sure to come a
the rising suns of the days afte
this. The sooner it comes the bette
for the farms, the cities and the couri
try. because the whole hangs upon th
: existence and welfare of the agrlcul
i tural Industry and the sturdy sot:
j of America who must continue li
that industry If the nation is to ccr
, tinue in the path which thus far ha
been its destiny.
As frankly outspoken as he is t
Congress about agriculture and laboi
President Harding is still mor
open, even hold, with his declara
tion as to the Jones act, directin
the Executive to give notice for th
termination of existing cominereia
treaties, so as to enable this countr
to set up differential import charge
against any goods brought to us i
other than American bottoms. H
tells Congress that he has not corr
plied with the legislative cotnman
of Congress, as President Wilson als
did not comply with it. because to >1
so would "involve us in a chaos o
trade relationships" and make ou
Industrial and commercial trouble
worse than they already are.

Is working out 8 plan which, "thoug
yet too crude to offer it," promises t
save the American merchant marim

i "the only promising alternative (to Inl
i the American valuation), namely, a Qh
provision authorizing proclaimed -m

t conditions on any given list of ar- cel
1 tides Imported."
1 This would seem to answer the erf
t serious objection of American Importi
ers and merchants to the uncertain
ties of duties to be paid under the ab'
- American valuation plan. The "pro- cai
claimed" duty of the President undoubtedlv
would be payable only
after the giving of due notice as to i
( when it would take effect. Tn this
way the Importer could know when
he did his buying what duty he would ^
need to pay as he scarcely ever could
, know under the Fordney American
. valuation plan.
The President suggests, also, an ^

would prevent the future issuance of .

ices for pirates and freebooters, of
sslonary heroism and of South sea
ventures. Among the original setxs
were many freed or escaped
nvicts from the penal colonies of
istralla or New Caledonia. Almost
jm the first there was a strong
:alrv between the French and Briti
settlers in recruiting natives for

Some First Hand Memories of the' su*
Famons Singer. 'J14
m ? the
To Thi New York Herald : Though G[
known by repute to all except the very tlei
youngest, probably few erf the habitues ere
of the Metropolitan Opera House had an
ever heard Christine Nilsson, whose
death was announced tihe other day and j?*'
whose name had headed the roster of
artists engaged for the Initial season. tio
I remember her in Europe in the late mu
'70s, but even then she had abandoned coi
most of her youthful rOles, suoh ns or?
Luoia, Violetta and Ophelia, for more P'a
dramatic parts. Her voice at that time,
though it had undoubtedly lost some thj
very high notes which enabled her In
the '60s to sing the music of the Queen ?
of Night in "The Magic Flute," had
gained in power and easily filled the
auditorium. It was not at all of the
Italian type, like Pattl's, but of a dis- ,
tlnctly northern timbre, as Jenny Lund's
undoubtedly was, being heard at Its best
In the Jewel Song in "Faust," wtiich
has never been so brilliantly rendered
save perhaps by Melba In her prime.
On her last visit to America during
the season of 1883-4 Nilsson appeared
as Marguerite in "Faust," Margherita
and Helen of Troy in "Meflstofele," Elan j ,
in "Lohengrin," Mignon, La Gioconda.
Donna Elvira in "Don Giovanni" and '
Valentine in "Lea Huguenots." I heard j .
her in all. Her impersonation of;
Goethe's heroine, both in Gounod's opera |
and in that of Boito, seemed to please ]
the public most. As Helen of Troy she I
was Incomparable, and (her queenly pres- :
ence will never be forgotten by those 1
who saw her. One night at the Metro- | ,
politan the brief duet "La Luna Immo- ]
bile," In the second part of "Meflstofele" ' (
had to be given five times, so exquisite
was the art of the singers (Nilsson and j
Trebelli). The duet for T.a Gioconda
and Laura (Mme. Fursch-Madl) in the i <
second act of Ponehlelli's opera was a!
most equally tine in a omerem way.
Rattl was pre-eminently a singer of
Rossini's music. Xilsson was not. '
though occasionally in London she ap
pcared as Desdcniona in that composer's
"Otello." which has not been heard here
for over half a century and should not
bo confounded with Verdi's opera of the
same name. She was, however, a Mozart ?
specialist, having sung the rfiles of Che- 1
rubino and the Countess in "The Mar- . .
riage of Figaro," the Queen of Nii/lit in
"The Magic Flute," Donna Elvira In '
"Don Giovanni" and, I believe, on a i <

flrho makes the programmes for the
icerts of the Beethoven Association
not'disclosed by the modest publicity
orts of the organize! ton. But if music
eis giv? due consideration to the
tes of the presiding officer, Harold
uer, they are likely to suspect him
exercising a potent influence over the
king of tBe lists. In last evening's
icert given in Aeolian Hall Sehunn's
piano quintet and the Brahms
ntet for clarinet and strings were the
ge numbers and Mr. Bauer lias long
?n known as an apostle of both com
icrs.
L'hc Schumann quintet makes its apiranee
not infrequently In the cliam
music entertainments of this town,
t the Brahms clarinet qu'ntet had
n permitted to rest in silence since it
s given on November 11, 1913, at a
icert of the Kneisel Quartet. On that
:asion the clarinet player was Henri
an Be Roy, then first clarinetist of
: Philharmonic Society. Bast evening
i clarinetist was George Grises.
.Vithout doubt the programme maker
J in mind ihe artistic relation 'hesen
Schumann and Brahms, a relation
ich historians mention spontaneously,
which to the casual music lover Is
haps not clear. But since both were
nanticists, since both composed piano
1 chamber music, as well as aymrnies
in the classic forms. Into which ,
>y poured the fresh feeling of the :
er school, one readily accepts the j
icrtion that they belonged to the same
ritual brotherhood, albeit their 1
thods of expression differed in strik- ;
: manners.
It has been noted that Brahms wrote
clarinet trio and quintet with the
ying of Richard Muehlfeld in view.
1 it is also certain that in the second
the two works his inspiration reached
level of independence which asked no
rgestions from the distinguished vir>so's
art. The trio paved the way for
i quintet. The composer's assimilation
the technic and expressive pessibilin
of the clarinet made the quintet a
iRtion in which the specialisation of
Instrument was incidental. It is one
the supreme masterpieces in the dertment
of chamber music. The flrst
0 movements are greater than the
rd and fourth, but the whole composln

The hills have a healing;
Sweet winds without number
About them go stealing,

And dreams of revealing.
Rapt visions of wonder
Rise up from their hollows;
When night bursts asunder
And ecstasy ?follows.
The soul Is swept yonder

The fair slopes before them
Are steps to their altars;
The skies that lean o'er them
Hold songs for their psalters;
And those that adore them?
Their faith never falters.

Diverse and diurnal.
Come sun-time or shower-time,

With glimpses eternal.

They strengthen the spirit;

'Aren't I?" and "An't 1?"
urtit of the Dictionary Shod on an
Imported Phrase.
To Tub New York Herald: Has the
t of consulting the dictionary become
lost art that we are asked, "Why seek
r authority for the use of the expresin
'Aren't I?' other than the force of
more or less general use?" While I
tirely agree with your correspondent
hnson S. Field when he says "There
n bo no authority derived from gramit
ical construction." I do not agree
th him when he concludes with "or
>nt the correct derivation of words in
Is Instance."
The usage of the most careful speaki
nnd writers of an age Is standard
thorlty. There Is no such authority
the use of the expression "Are IV" or
are." "Am TV" Is the only correct
rm. "Aren't" Is used for "Are not"
leu the subject follows, as "Aren't
ii'"' "Aren't tliey?" The best convertional
usage contracts the verb when
e subject precedes "We're not" .
'ou're not." The recent Importation
im England of the phrase "Aren't IV"
an erroneous Anglicism for "Am I
tV" which Is due to thoughtlessness
d arises out of a confusion of the
is?s. No educated person says "Arc
" or "T are "
By consulting the dictionary one
irns that "An't TV" Is the correct conictlon
for "Am not. IV" and that
iron't" Is correct only when used with
pronoun of the plural number. Sir

The rule that the grammarians have
Id down Is that the verb must nlwnys

Hints to Women in Choosing
Evening Gown.
A Kachclor in Fxmdon Daily Hall.
A mid-Victorian lady of my acqua!
anco once declared to a qompany
young people, touching the matter
evening frocks, that in nine cases
.if ten light blue was the most attr
tive color.
Close observation during the ye
that followed the old lady's dictum
i.ntised me to wonder at her wisd.
For it is undeniably a fact, and d
r ot vary with other changes of fash
| that. In the eyes of men the aver
good looking, healthy English girl lo
more attractive in light blue than
any other color.
I had a remarkable confirmation
; this a short time ago. A cousin of m
: granddaughter of the lady whose vi<
f have quoted, arrived in London al
an absence of two years, eager
i iancing. She- is a pretty girl, 26 ye
' of age, and a very good dancer.
I took her to three dances in
week. On the first occasion she w
an expensive frock of black and g
in which she looked fine but sophl
1 cated. She was without partners
five dances.
On the next occasion she wore
filmy yellowy sort of frock, equally
pensive and fashionable; yet the da
was a disappointment. While she 1
painfully wondering what to wear
the third evening there arrived by i
a frock from lier mid-Victorian grand

was cut high at the neck, light blu?
color, with a plain belt of gold relle
by a bunch or buckle of red stuff,
nature of which 1 cannot at the
inent recall.
It was severely simple, but reve:
a reasonable amount of ankle. A
trying It on. my cousin exclaimed : "'W
it makes me look like an unsoph
cated schoolgirl."
At any rate, she wore it that ever
with astonishing success. She was
sieged for dances hv men of every
and altitude and might have filled
programme twice over. She had. in
dition. ttic joy of rejecting two \
poaals of marriage.
Tt may he objected that the color <
frock should depend on the partici
wearer and that a girl who might 1
! very attractive in black would 1

I occasionally. Yet as k general r
i whatever the color of a girl's eyes
the style of her beauty, provided eh
j not a person of large dimensions, r
plfclty and light, blue will attract i
t very where.
Pink is. In my judgment, second :
orite. and black the third. It is cur
to observe how a certain tjpe of i
Is carried away by a pretty blond)
a black frock.
I A dispute between two silk merchi

fact that plain black Is the most popi
of all colors; various plain shades
