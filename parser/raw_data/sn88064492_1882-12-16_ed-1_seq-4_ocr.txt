TELL-TALES.
Oh ! don't you remember,
Loll" time ago,
When tlie path was in December
Covered o'er with snow ?
Then we bad a little walk.
Then we hail a little talk.
But jealous eyes lid soon divine
The footsteps there were not till mine.
Oh ! the snow,
The tell tale snow,
Long time ago 1
Oh ! don't you remember
On that evening lair.
When the jesaminc flowers you brniked
In the raven hair 1
Homeward then I thoughtless strayed
And the jasmine flowers betrayed ;
For well th" jealous glances knew
No jesaniine in our garden grew
till ilie flower.
The tell-talo flower.
Long time ago !
And when we were both forbidden
Ever more to meet,
Silly little notes were hidden
By the willow seat;
But vainly for a note we sought—
Could we each other have forgot !
Ah ! others knew as well as we
The secret of tha t hollow tree.
Oh ! the tree, the hollow tree.
It betrayed both you and me,
Long time ago !
WASHINGTON LETTER.
From Our I.'egular Correspondent.
Washington. D. C. December. 27tli, 1882
The First Performance. A view fr- m
the Reporters' Gallery. Sneaker
Keifer's Trials.
A "first performance," be it theatrical m
parliamentary, always forms a great attrac
tiou for the spectacle-loving Washingto
nians ; and especially for the large number
of transient visitors always in the city. It
was therefore, not surprising on this first
day to find the galleries of the House cr -w
ded within, and its portals surrounded by
a throng of sight seers.
The opening scenes in the House and
Senate were such as have been often dcs
cribed. There was great confusion outlie
floor of the House both .before and after
the opening of the session. Members gree
ted one another with great effusiveness
and joked ami laughed loud, or talked se
riously in pairs or groups. The Senate on
the other hand maintained that dignity
for which it is renowned.
By half past eleven o'clock, both houses
had answered to the roll call, and then
members and senators made themselves as
comfortable as possib'e. while they listtn
cd to the monotonous drowl of the clerk
reading the Presidents message.
There ig much talk and speculation in
official and political circles in relation to
the course of legislation during the pre
sent session. Neither party has as yet
Jield a cancas or manned out its nro.
gramme. From conversation with differ
ent Members and Senators, one is couvi.r
ced of wide and apparently irreconcila
ble differences of opinion especially on the
snbject of the reduction of taxation. All
agree that there must be reduction, but
how t that's the question. Individual
Democratic members and Senators have
expressed the opinion that the better
policy for them is to oppose legislation on
this question so that the comirig Democra
tic House can have a clear field. But
others among the most experienced and
practical of their party, express the opi
nion that such a course would he dange
toub. They say that the Democratic par
ty m Congress will commit a serious mis
take if it undertakes to stop blindly any
reduction of taxation : that* if nothing in
this line is accomplished at this session of
Congress, tbo House Democrats, when the
next Congress meets, will find themselves
confronted with a grave problem, the dif.
Acuities of which they will snrely find
themselves unable to surmount, as the re
publicans, with their Bplendid leadership
and organization in the Senate, will ha
rasa and embarass them at every turn.
The result will be that the republicans
will havo'au effective rallying cry to go to
the country within the presidential cam
paign of 1884, and the Democrats will
again be put on the defensive, than which
there can be nothing more fatal in polities
If the reduction in taxation which the
country demands, and demands speedily,
be accomplished this winter, the responsi
bility will, in a great measure, be divided,
and both parties will share the praise
These views will be impressed upon Sena
tors and Members of the Democratic party
and will have much weight- The strong
.probability is, therefore, that there will be
material i eduction in taxation before the
adjournment of Congress on the 4th, of
March.
On account of the repairs that are being
made in the White Honse, the .President s
receptions will not begin until alter the
holidays.

THE SUN.
SEW YORK, 1883.
More people have read Tlie Sun during the
year .just now jiassiug than ever before since
it was first printed. No other ncwsjiajier pub
fished on this side of the earth lias la-en
bought and read in auy year by so many men
and women.
We are credibly informed that people buy.
read, anil like The Sim for the following rea
sons. among others:
Because its news columns present in attrac
tive form ami with the greatest possible accu
racy whatever b.-ts interest tor humankind;
the events, the deeds and misdeeds, the wis
dom. the philosophy, the notable folly, the
solid sense, the improving nonsense—all tlie
news of the busiest world at present revolving
ill space.
Because people have learned that in its re
marks concerning [arsons ami affairs The
Sun makes a practice of telling them the ex
act truth to tin- best of its ability three him
tired and sixty five days in the year, before
election as well as alter, about the whales as
well as about the small fish, in the face of dis
sent us jdaiuly and fearlessly as when sup
porteil by general up|irovul. Tlie Sun lias ab
solutely no purposes to serve, save the infor
niation of its i cadets aud tlto furtherance of
the common good.
Because it is everybody's newspaper. No
noau is so bumble that The Sun is indifferent
to his welfare aud his rights. No man is so
rich that it cuu allow injustice to he done
linn. No man, uo association ot men, is pow
dim chough to lie exempt from the strict ap
plication ot its principle* of right and wrong.
Because in politics it has fought for a dozen
yi-ar^ without iuH-fiuifsivu and s<»iu?t iacs
most alone among newspapers. the fight that
has resulted in tlie recent overwhelming pop
ular verdict against Robesonism and for lion
est governmeut. No matter what party is in
power, The Sun stands aud will continue to
staud like a rock for the interests of tho peo
ple against the ambition of bosses, the en
croachments of monopolists, and the dishon
est schemes of public robbers.
All this is what we are to'd almost daily by
our friends. One man holds that The Sun is
the oest religious newspaper ever published,
because its Christianity is undiluted with
cant. Another bolds that it is the best Re
publican newspaper printed, because it has
already whipped halt of the rascals out of
that party, and is proceeding against the oth
er half with UDilciniuislied vigor. A third be
lieve it to be the best uiagagaziue of general
literature in existence, because its readers
miss nothing worthy of notice that is current
in the world of thought. So every friend of
The Sun discovers one of its litany sides that
appeals with particular force to his individual
If you already know The Sun, you will ob
serve that in 1883 it is a little better than ev
er before, ll'youdonot already know The
Sun, you will find it to he a mirror of all hu
man activity, a storehouse of the choicest pro
ducts of common sense and imagination, a
mainstay for the cause of holiest government,
a sentinel for genuine Jeffersonian Democra
cy, a scourge for wickedness of every species,
aud au uncommonly good investment for the
coming year.
