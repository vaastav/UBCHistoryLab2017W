Petersburg, Dec. 10. ? Thirty thous. ;
and homeless people huddled am
shivered about the ruins of fire-swep
Hopewell, the mushroom powde.
town, today, while seven companie
of Virginia militia patrolled the burn
ed area to prevent looting.
All telephone and telegraph com \
munication with the devasted tow j
was destroyed by the flames, and : i
complete estimate of the loss in lif j
and property has not yet been coir J
piled. The property less is estimat I
ed at $1,000,0017.
Reports reaching here today sai 1
one negro was lynched for lootinf \
while, several others, including a:
Italian who went crazy over the loss c
his money in one of the two ban* .
destroyed by the flames, were sh< j
"down by soldiers. According to info
mation brought here by persons rc j
turning from Hopewell, five persor
were shot by another Italian who wr
fired upon when'he attempted to er
ter a burning bank.
Hopewell, Dec. 10. ? Thousands c <
people were left homeless and witf
out shelter and probably 800 build
ings were destroyed yesterday whf
fire swept across sixty of Hopewell' I
eighty acres, doing a property dair I
age estimated at more than $1,000,00'
As far' as could be learned, ther r
wot-. pa ef- life fer
minor accidents. Report that a nf
gro had been lynched for looting wa
unconfirfimed.
At 8 o'clock last night seven milit;
companies from Richmond arrived o
the scene on a special train, and mai
tial law was proclaimed.
The fire raged from '1:45 o'cloc1
until nearly 9 o'clock' at night, df
stroying fifteen blocks. Available finlighting
apparatus "was utterly inade
quate t<r;cppe with tire situation, th ,
flames eating'their way through th
flimsy frame ..structures .thrown uduring
the early boom of the powdo
town last summer like so much tine'
cr.
The exit from Hopewell was almo?
equal to an evacuation. Long beforthe
.shadows of evening began to fa1
families." individuals and small par.,
ties'of friends and "strangers wer- seen-,
to \ be ^leaving, carrying wit1
themUhe possessions which they ha'"
saved. ;The 'Wore -fortunate- occupie-'
motors, ;somc -got-, away '/in horse
draw conveyances, while many trudg
ed along on-'foot. * Some; of -thes^
found refuge at' Du Pont City, .which;
was at no. time: threatened; other ;
went to Gity<-Point,i: but most mad*1
their way to Petersburg.

which started m a restaurant yeste*, j

joining building? in Hopewell, th
du Pont boom Jtown,: twenty mile |
from here. Last night practically ever? |
business house, hotel ; and rostau- i
... . i
rant in the town had been wiped out {
First estimates placed the loss at
SI,000,000.
The du Pont plant was in. no dan- f
per. being located .500 yards -fi-on |
the milroad crossing, which separa-1
tes the company's property from the
tc<\vn proper.
Fully 10,000 employes are homeless.
Special trains are bringing their,
to Petersburg and Richmond.
Just as a special train, carrying
the Richmond Blues and two companies
of the Richmond Grays rolled
into Hopewell yesterday evening, a
negro was hanged for looting.
The wildest excitement prevailed'
throughout the- afternoon and citizens
wired . Gov.. Stuart for troops.
Companies from Richmond and Peter; j
burg we're-ordered to the scene.The
itrtT^swcpt the business section
of Broadway, Poythr'ess street
and Railroad avenue, cutting ? dia**

long*. j
The du Pont lire corps and the
Petecsbiu-g department were called
upon for assistance, but long before
they d'ould arrive the flames had
gained such headway that the town j
was doomed. j
Stories of Heroic rescues are record, j
ed. Adam Drum, an 11-year-old rcicnmond
boy, rushed into a blazing building
and appeared at a window on the
second floor with an infant in hi?
arms. While men were arranging, a
blanket to catch the babe, the boy
leaned forward and with a cry fell
Adth the infant in his arms. An in;tant
later the mother of the baby
rushed from the building, her clothng
afire, just in time to see the boy
md the baby land safely in the
aakeshift lifenet. A moment later the
joy rescued another baby from the
juilding next door.
Whether the origin of the fire was
icendiary has not been determined.!
Town and State authorities will make
thorough investigation. The arrest!
f the suspected German spy within'
he confines of the Dupont plant yes.
jrday morning caused people to be eve
the fire was incendiary. The
lan has not been able to communi- j
ite with persons on the outside. It j
i said that he has maps ami mue j
rints of the Dupont plant in his J
ockets, and that he was attempting;
> set off chemicals in a warehouse |
led with pun cotton ready for ship-1
ent. None of these statements are!
rified by government officers. The j
ame of the man is kept a secret, j
The Hopewell Hospital was in the i
ath of the flames and all patient' i
are rescued. Infants and children
>und on the streets were sent to the
upont Hospital, where they are bc g
cared for.
The fire was still burning late last I
ght, but had spent its fury, as there I
as nothing left but ruins. . j
The city council of Petersburg last J
ig-ht, threw open the school build- j
gs and churches opened their doorsj
the refugees from Hopewell. Every i
Tort is being made to aid tne home- j
ss. Iic-lief funds are being raised j

The population of the new town is j
tinaated at 30,000. Most of these j
re men who are hardened to the t
wgh.Jife incident to the .building ofj
new city of this character. The Du j
ont munitions factory has a pav!

mded that the limit ; of expense j
ould be ?10,000,000. The establish.
ent, already has cost S25,000.000 to
lild arid equip.
It is said that the Du Ponts have
nwoivi <vf sonnnnnnnn in wnr muni-!
tons contracts. Their contracts, too j
ro to run for three years. At the j
nd of that time the -'management
as given out the .strongest indicaons
that the plant will he continued J
robably on a more moderate scale,
or .the manufacture of such munions
as will be needed by the United
tates government, and also for the
manufacture of dye-stuffs and other j
hemicals.
An electric line is in course of con-'
truction from Petersburg to Hopeveil.
The Norfolk and Western Rail*
oad is building a double track into
he new: city, and has purchased 57
meres to be used as a freight yard.

lave been made for better wharfage

s understood that the Duponts have
jbtaincd a franchise for a bridge nc.
ross the James River.
As it now stands the Du Pont facory
is the largest guncotton plant
n the world. It is also the ' largest
litrating plant in the world, and will
soon be the largest sulphuric plant.
Thousands of the workers sleep in
tents and shacks. It is estimated that
5,000 each night make their way to
Petersburg, 9 miles away, in order to
find sleeping places. The place was
very much crowded for sleeping accommodations
before the fire. Tho
conditions are infinitely worse now.
and due to the winter cold the suffering
is intense.

before tin- State Legislature
his winter was the claim made when'
he first suffrage convention ever j
.eld in Richmond opened its first ses-1
;ion yesterday at the Jefferson Hotel, j
Perhaps the most notable event of;
he day was the visit of a delegation j
o the Governor in the afternoon, tcj

o the suffrage amendment to he!

Yanklin Street from the Jefferson i

o the Capitol. Mrs. B. B. Valentine,;
- , f
hi State president, headed the coi-.
mn, bearing a yellow "Votes for j
Vomcn" banner in her hand. The
elegation, nearly 200 in number, fil
3d the Governor's cilice to overflow- (
njr. j
Before introducing the speakers, !
Irs. Valentine said: "We women,1
rem all over the State of Virginia.;

The lirst speaker was Mrs. John

Miss Mary Johnston, the novelist j

Miss Roberta Wellford, who renre-1

to the fact that over half of the
desirable properties in her town is
owned by women, who do not even
have a vote on a matter so vital to
their interests as a bond issue.
Mrs. W. W. King. from Staunton,
scored a point. She began by saying
"I come from a stronghold of democracy."
The Governor interrupted her tc
say, "Not a very recent one,' alluding
to the recent Republican victory
in tJfcat district.
"You have anticipated what I was
going to say," answered the suffragist
quickly. "1 was going td suggest
rhat perhaps the reason for democracy's
defeat there has been the fail,
ure of its advocates to advance the
principles of democracy in their fullest
sense." .

"You will remember that I have

I did not recommend the

I will say this?if the Legislature

It was also stated that the. position

that such acts will not be repeated,
is that no matter whether a merchantman
stops upon the firing of a

The text of the note was not made
public, as it had been indicated it
would be. Officials of the State. Department
refused to discuss the communication
in any way, declining
even to admit that it had been sent.
