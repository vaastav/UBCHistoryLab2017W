THURSDAY,DKCKMIIKK 10. 1*H.
Mr.WaiianiaktT has falU'ii off the^platform adopted by Ins party in 1SS8.^When, in national convention assem^^bled, the republicans nominated Mr^Harrison for the office of president,^they put in the platform these words:^^We demand the reduction of letter^postage to one cent an ounce.^ Now^comes Mr. Wananiaker. and he says^that there s nothing in the cry for one-^cent postage. That figure, he says,^would involve an annual loss in the^postal service of t^L'1,^^^).^^^^. Xn ob^^jection to the AVanamaker ultimatum^comes from the press of his party.^Probably the republican editors have^forgotten that their party^s convention^ever made any '^demand^ lor the one-^cent rate.
Ourrepublican contcni|^orarieR ap^^pear to be anxious about Congressman^Dixon's coming committee relations.^From all that comes to his constitu^^ents, it appears that the new congress^man is not spending his time in an ef^^fort to look out for Dixon, but that as^soon as he arrived in Washington he^undertook to carry through the depart^^ments several matters of iui|Hirtanceto^the people. Kvety eiti/.eii of Montana^knows that Mr. Dixon will serve the^state faithfully and well. (^ue thing is^certain- his anxiety for a government^oflice and for official favor will never^prompt him to |icrmit the bosses to^pair him with a man who would, were^he present, vote for free coinage any^^way, nor will he skip into the cloak^room when the house lakes a test vote^on silver.
Themanagers of the state peniten^^tiary have lieeii freely criticised by the^state press for excluding secular news^^papers from the literature to which the^convicts arc granted access. It docs^not appear, however, that it is the in^^tention of those in control of the insti^^tution to leave the prisoners in dark^^ness and ignorance. A school is about^to be organized, and Warden McTaguc^requests from the public contributions^of old school books, expressing his will^^ingness to pay the freight on thetn to^Ileer Lodge. The hcIiooI is deserving^of all success, and the donations of^text lxHiks should It immediate and^liberal. If the curriculum of the new^school is to include history, we would^suggest to the promoters of the enter^prise that conteuipory history is ut^once more interesting, more compre^^hensible, and more profitable every way^than ancient or mediaeval. A good^new s|^a|^er is itself a means of liberal^education.
ABOUTTHE MESSAGE.^Was President Harrison's strong^argument in favor of reciprocity lost^in transit'^' The country was told to^exiicct brilliant passages in discussion^of that subject. It is a live question;^in all the columns of the message we^tlnd no argument about it.
Asis customary, the message refers^to the reports of the momliers of the^cabinet for detailed statements regard^^ing the business of the government^for the year. The president announces^that the troubles incident to the Alas^^kan fisheries have been tixed up in a^satisfactory way. that new trade rela^^tions have been established with Ilia^zil. with !^an Domingo and with the^Spanish West Indian possessions, that^the American hog, of the four-legged^variety, has unquestioned right of way^in France, tiermauy, Austria, Denmark^and Italy, that revised treaty arrange^^ments have been concluded with^Mexico, and that the routine work in^the various bureaus of (lie government^has been faithfully discharged.
PresidentHarrison is of the opinion^that the Mckinley hill js u |n4 scheme,^in spite of the popular condemnation^which overtook that measure at the^polls. He asserts that American citi^reus sojourning in China shall he pro^tected, he is of the opinion that it^would be wise on the part of the gen^^ral government to gi\e the Nicaragua^canal a lift, he finds that legislation^will lie needed in order to rid the coun^^try of Chinamen who steal into this^country across the Dominion line, he^suggests that something must he done^about railroad debts to the govern^ment. but makes no recommendation^regarding the refunding plan proposed^in behalf of the Cuinn I'ucilic. he^points out the fact that tins country jg^rapidly equipping itself with a navy^Which will lie the wonder of the World.
Theparagraphs in the message thai^relate to Chilian atlairs are not as^aensational as gossip had promised.^The Itata aflair is reviewed at length^and the course pursued l^\ this govern^nient is broadly defended. In regard^to the troubles grow ing out of the^assault on American sailors, the presi^dent says that our government is^putting itself in lull |Missession of,all^the facts, that the answers which have^come from the Chilian government to^inquiries put by the I'nited States an^not satisfactory, and that, when the^facts are in, another message will Is^^ent to congress.
TUereading public will lull tore
fleetingover the suggestive passage in^the president's message which says^that, during the year, the work of the^pension bureau has la-en characterized^by ^great diligence.^ No doubt of it.^A department which scatters one^hundred and thirty millions a year^where, on the testimony of men like^tiartield and Grant, forty millions^would be ample such a department^must indeed lie ^diligen*.^ The head^and front of the department has^passed an eventfully active year^Haunt has hud all he could do to hold^his place in the face of the scandals^involving his pension adminstration.
Inthe communities w here the STAX-^MM has most of its patrons, the |ias-^sage of the message relating to free^coinage will be carefully sought out.^The paragraph on this subject is^pointed. It will Is-read with painful^disappointment by western constituen^^cies which supported Mr. Harrison for^the office of president, because his^party's platform promised restoration^for silver. ^I am still of the opinion,^^says the president, ^that the free coin^^age of silver, under existing conditions,^would disastrously affect our business^interests at home and abroad.^ To this^is added the old song that this country^must have the co-o|H-ration of Durope^before silver gets its due we take^notice that the message makes no sug^^gestion about securing t he co-operation^which, under the goldite theory, is^necessary.
Thethemes thus briefly referred to^are among t he topics of chief interest^which are discussed in the president's^annual talk. Most of Mr. Harrison's^state papers have merited commenda^^tion for precision of style and for th^ ir^compact Kuglish. It has given the^STANPAItK pleasure to commend many^of them. We shall not he accused^of partisan prejudice if we say that the^message printed this morning is hardly^up to the staildaid of the president's^average efforts. This may lx-accounted^for. perhaps, by I he fact that on many^topics which are engaging public^thought the message lacks suggestion.^This may in turn Is- due to the fact^that tin- president in framing flu- mes^^sage kept constantly in view the fact^that his immediate audience is a con^^gress in which the majority has passed^to a party not in sympathy w ith the^one whose most conspicuous represen^^tative he is.
thedeterrent inlluence of such laws.^When crime is punished certainly and^severely, there will be less crime and^fewer criminals.
Whatwill silver-advocating editors^in the woolly West do with the an^^nouncement that the portrait of Sena^^tor .lohu Sherman has been placed in^the directors' room of the bank of^Knglaudy It hangs there, unques^^tionably in grateful recognition of this^leading republican's distinguished^services in the interest of thegoldbugs.
Thedispatches tell us that the^government forces of China ^are fol^^lowing up their victories and Un^^complete annihilation of the rebate|a^expected in a few days.^ Somehow^that sentence has a familiar sound. A^few mouths ago Komethiug very like^it was sent out to the world daily from^Valparaiso, particularly were ila- dis^^patches to that effect thick and fast^just la-fore the efforts looking to Un^^complete annihilation of the rebels^were completely annihilated by the^reln-ls. The same sentence too was^given out so frequently and so |wr-^sistently from Washington during our^own civil war that its component parts^icquired in their enti rety the^dignity of household words. The ac^^complished war correspondents in ( hiiia^should try to separate facts from^opinions, especially opinions issued^U|hiii governmental authority. The^imperial forces may 1* having every^^thing their own way, and the end of^the war may lx- in plain sight, but it is^well enough tor those interested in the^outcome to hear in mind which side^has control of the w ires.
Thereis no doubt about Mr. Crisp's^democracy, and therefore there can he^no quest ion 1 hat he is for tarill reform,^lie is opposed to the sophistry on^which McKinleyism rests, and thus lie^is in close sMiipalliy w ith people in this^part of the world there are very few^high-tarill nien in Montana, the num^^ber of them in (he republican party in^this state is very small. Then.too, Mr.^Crisp is on record as the friend of sil^^ver he lost the vote of a prominent^democratic member from Massachu^^setts because he would not promise to^oppose legislation friendly to free coin^^age. The West evidently has a friend^in Sjieaker t 'risp.
ONEREASON OVERLOOKED^There has been no end of comment^over the fact brought out at the late^prison congress that crime is increas^^ing relatively in the I'nit.-d MUtM and^decreasing elsewhere. In twenty \ears^the prisoners coni'mcd in Kngland and^Wales have fallen from P.'.ols to \2.nrj,^although there has lieen a Inge in^crease in pnpnlat ;on. w hereas in the^I'nited states in ten years our prison^pspulatioii has grown from IfaflW to^l(.*..'^:tH. Two principal explanations^have la-en nffcriil. but neither is fully^satisfactory. It is asserted that I'.ng^laud is doing away with imprisonment^to a large extent and substituting lines^therefor, and il is further insisted tha'^the improvement in Kngland's stowing^and the determration in that of the^I'nited states are due to iiuiniiri ition.
Hutin answer to the lirsl of these^reasons British statistic!.ins claim that^in the actual number of crimes commit^^ted Great liiitam is doing ^attar than^twenty ^o ns.igo. As t-i ihi-second of^the leas.,us. it is unqiie-.tlooablf li ne^to a certain extent, hut il does not^fully account for the increase of pris^^oners; the prison records fail to prove^that ^nek In all probability no small^part of (hi- increase is due to laxitv in^the enforcement of the criminal li-.ws.^thereby in largo measure destroying
Thenegroes of the country ap|^ear^to lie considerably exercised over a^judicial decision denying negro Imivs^admission into Girard college. Hiiladel-^phia. They have been led to believe by^the courts that they are entitled to all^the rights and privileges enjoyed by the^whites, and they, at least some of their^leaders, profess to be alarmed at the^present decisn.n as a blow to their^equality. That this alarm is needless,^and that the suit they brought against^the trustees of the college for refusing^admission to the negro youth was ill-^advised, ure self-evident projiositions^to any one in intelligent possession of^the facts. In founding the college^Stephen Girard stipulated that his^money should lie spent on white hoys^only, and the court says that he had a^jH-rfcct right to do so, and that the^state cannot interfere and force the^negro youth into the institution. If^Mr. (iirard had left his money for the^founding of an asylum for cats, it^would have la-en equally absurd to pe-^t it ion the court to tfJM its doors to^dogs as well.
