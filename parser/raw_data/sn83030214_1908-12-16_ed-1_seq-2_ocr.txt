Tr. th* act approved June M. IMt, "To provide

•"Congress provided as follows:
" THat the President of the United States is

It thereupon became the duty of the Presl
id-nt «:i execution of this statute, to purcnase
the property specified from th- New Panama
'Canal Company, of France, provided he could
obtain a satisfactory title. The Department of
Justice was 4rißtructed to examine the title, and
; afl such an examination Attorney General
•Knox reported that a satisfactory title could be
'obtained Payment of the purchase price was
thereupon made to the New Panama Canal

THE NEW PANAMA COMPANY.
The title to the Panama Canal Bropertieg wa«
Vested in the New Panama Canal Com] of
Franc*, which was tho legal mvnrr thereof, and
th* olrl or so-called I)e Liesseps Company had a
larre equity theroin. The title was not in a
New Jersey company nor In any othor American
company, nor «iid this government have any
<lealirsff3 with any American company through
out the affair.
The exact leeal ■ tua. to th. most minute de
tail, arpears In the exhaustive opinion of Attor
ney reneral Kno\ approving the title to be
«r:\»r, to the United states, which clearly estab
lishes that tho only party dealt with was tho
»w Panama Canal Company of France (with
th«* concurrence of the liquidator of the old
company) and not any American rporatlon or
fc-yndleat".
The action of the Unitod States government
v-as. of course, wholly unlnfiuencs-d I y and had
nothing whatever to do with any question as to
srko were or srl had boon the security holders
<if either the new or the old company. Who
*ueh security bold< rs were was not our affair.
If. as a matter of fact, the canal ♦ panics,
either or both, had beesi owi ed bj American
citizens or by citizens of any other nationality
Jt would not liave altered in tho slightest degree
the action talsen by this government. Our con
corn was to gf-t tho canal property which was
owned by the rench company, and to se% tliat
tho title was Hear. Our transactions were car
ried BJ openly and were published In detail, arid
■we dealt solely [so far as the inteiestp of the old
Panerna company were concerned > with the

DISTRIBUTION <iF PAYMENT.

to the liquidator of the old company and 77,400,-
IKK) francs to the New Panama Canal Company
of Prance in liquidation. In these payments we
followed to the letter the decree of the govern
mental tribunal of France whu h had the author
ity to make such a decree, the Civil Tribunal of
tlie Seine We had neither desire nor authority
to go behind this decree of this proper govern
mental body, as all the conflicting rights of the
security holders of both companies had been set
tled by the decree of said court by ratification
of the" arbitration which resulted In that divi
sion.
I wish to make as dear as possible, and us
emphatic as possible, the statement that we did
not have anything to do with* t he distribution
of a dollar of the $40,000,000 we paid as re
gards any stockholder or bondholder of the
French companies, save that we followed out
the award of the arbitrators appointed in ac
cordance with the decree of the French couri
which had dealt with the subject in awarding
a certain proportion to the old company and a
certain proportion to the new company Any
question concerning the stockholders, bond
holders, or other beneficiaries' of the proc&eds
Of sale was purely a question for the Civil Tri
bunal of the Seine, the French governmental
body, with which this nation had nothing what
ever to do.
NO CONCERN WITH MR. CROMWELL.
Under these circumstances there was not the
slightest need for Mr. Cromwell to give any in
iormation on the subject of the companies for
which he had been counsel. This government
has no concern with Mr. Cromwell's relation to
these companies, or either of them, or with the
amount of his professional compensation; it was
not the affair of this government to inquire
who were the security holders of the compa
nies. Nevertheless. Mr. Cromwell, of his own
accord, has fubmitted to me, together with a
copy of his statement published on the 11th
inst , and which I transmit herewith, a full list
of the stockholders of the New Panama Canal
Company of France on January 15, 1900 ur n"
bering over six thousand), and a list of all
stockholders who were present Rt a special
meeting 6f the company held February °>. IWJZ,
Immediately after the cable offer of the com
pany was made to the United States (January
I>-11 10U2), to accept the appraisement of f40,
000,000 made by the Isthmian Canal Commis
sion and to sell for said sum the Panama
Canal, concessions, and other property, and the
shares of the Panama Railroad Company. He
has also furnished me a certified copy of the
final report of the liquidator of the old com
pany, which was filed on June 25 last and for
mally approved by the Civil Tribunal of the
Seine together with a summary account pre
pared and signed by said liquidator as late as
the 24th ult. I also transmit a translation of
the two resolutions, with the vote upon them,
adopted at a meeting of the stockholders of the
new company beld on April 23, UH.H, rrrr the
purpose of finally ratifying the sale.
All these documents I herewith transmit as
a part of this message. It appears from them
that the creditors of the old company number
ir_'«". 29<> parties who nave received dividends
out of the funds in the hands of the liquidator,
who. in his letter, states that in this present
month of December the second and last dis
tribution to the creditors will be begun, and
that the average dividend heretofore paid to
each individual was 782 francs, or $l.*>ts. No
payment whatever was or will be made upon
the stock of the old company, as it was worth
less from the day De Lesseps failed, and this
cuts out from consideration all misleading
statements regarding a possible purchase by
anybody of the stock of the old Panama Canal
Company. It has not received, and will not
receive, "a penny. Even upon the bonded In
debtedness the "dividend, I am thus Informed,
will amount, in the aggregate, to only about
10 per centum. It likewise plainly appears
that this distribution by the liquidator of the
old mpany has been openly conducted at hi*
office in Paris. No. SO Rue EtHnne Marcel.
where all the receipts, accounts, and records
of his payments are on file.
The New Panama Canal Company of France
is in iquidation. As the accompanying papers
set forth this liquidated company received as
Its proportion of the $40,000,000 the sum of
77.400.000 francs, and this- amount was dis
tributed by the liquidation In three payments
through four leading banks of Paris, covering
a period of the last four years, and to share
holders numbering about 6,000. Every step
of the transaction was not only taken publicly,
hut was. contemporaneously therewith, adver
tised in the legal and financial papers of
France, and the banks making the payments
took proper receipts from all the parties to
whom payments were made, as is customary
in cuch cases.
The capital of the New Panama Canal Com
pany of France wa<= R5.f100.000 francs, and the
distribution thu* made amounted to about 130
francs on each share of I<«> francs. No divi
dends were paid during the ten years of the
company's existence, it therefore resulted that
the - areholders only recovered their original
investment with annual interest of about •'•
per cent.
The accounts and records of this liquidation,
which was concluded In June last, are on de
posit with the rrtdtt Lvonnaise. of Paris, as a
proper custodian tvf the same, appointed upon
<=uch liquidation. Recently a request was made
hv a private Individual to Inspect the records of
• he«e payments, but answer was made >y the
custodians that they saw no proper reason for
grant. such request by a stranger, arid, In
asmuch as there is not the slightest ground for
ETispicion of any bad faith In the transaction, it
hardly spftns worth while to mnke the requests:
but if the Congress ilesires, T have no doubt
that on the request of oui Ambassador In Paris
th*« lists of Individuals will be shown him.
As a matter of fact, there i° nothing; what
ever, in which this government Is interested, to
invf-stigate about this transaction. So far as
this government Is concerned, every step of the
<=lig!it<*«=t Importance has been made public by
Its Executive, and every step Taken in France
has there been made public by the proper of
ficla's
The Congress took the action It did take after
the moat minute and exhaustive examination
and dl* • on. and the Executive carried, out
the rectlon of the Congress to the letter.
Every act of this government, every act for
hien this government had the slightest respon-
Eibillty. whs in pursuance of the act of th*»
Congress here, and following out the decree of
the Civil Tribunal of the Seine in France.
Uurthprmorp. through the entirely voluntary
net of Mr. Cromwell. I am now able to present
to you full Information as to these actions in
France, with which this government did not
have an} concern, and which are set forth In
the accompanying papers
JHOW PRICE WAS FIXED.
It may bt well to recall that tho Ne\>. Panama
Canal Company of France did not Itself propose
or fix the figure $40,000,000 as the valuation of
thY nal and railroad properties. That sum
was Brst fixed b> our Isthmian Canal Commis
sion In its reports to the Congress after two
years of investigation and personal Inspection
of a!l the properties ar.d work already done,
whereby the properties and the work done were
In detail appraised at that sum as their value
to the United States. The French company
stoadily refused for over two years to make
any oflVr whatever In answer to the many writ
ten requests of the Isthmian Canal Commission;
and when its president did approach the ques
tion of price, it was on the basis of J109.000.000.
Later, und»»r idltlone not necessary now to
rehearse, thr- company, by cab!', accepted the
appraisement of $40,000,000 made by our com
mission. This government, therefore, acquired
all the prop' rties and concessions, both of canal
and railroad, at its own valuation and price,
tin* Congress pprovlng the prir-.-, ri.i author
izing tho exp< nditure of the rnonry. aftor the
most exhaustive examination and discussion.
I transmit herewith lists of tho documents In

Department of Justice and the Department of
War, ■o that, If tho Congress sees fit. It may

NEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER lfi, 1908
-THE WORLD'S' REPLY.
•The World" this morning publisher the M
lowtng editorial on President Roosevelt* Pana
ma message:
Mx. Roosevelt Is mistaken. He cannot tnu«-
Zl While nY°a r mount of billingsgate on his part
can alter our determination to treat him with
judicial impartiality and scrupulous fairness,
we repeat what we have already *aid-tha the
Congress of the United States should m«k«»
thorough Investigation of the whole Panama
transaction, that the full truth may be knows)
to the- American people.
It is a most extraordinary circumstance that
Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand such an
inquiry. All his protestations of outraged virt
ue all his torrents of Imprecation and de
nunciation, end with the amazing nf^rtlon
that "there is nothing whatever in which this
government is interested to invesUgate about
this transaction." 
"The World" fully appreciate* the compli
ment paid to it hy Mr. Roosevelt In making it
the subject of a special message to the Con
gress of the United States. In the whole his
tory of American government no other Pres>l
dent has ever paid such ■ tribute to the power
and influence of a fearless Independent news
paper.
"The World" likewise appreciates tho impir
tance and significance of Mr. Roosevelt's state
ment when he declares to Congress that the
proprietor of "The Work]- "should b* prose
cuted for libel by the governmental authori
ties," and that "the Attorney General has under
consideration the form under which the pro
ceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought.
This is the first time a President ever assert
ed the doctrine of lese. majesty, or proposed, in
the absence of specific legislation, the criminal
prosecution by the government of citizens vho
criticised the conduct at the government or the
conduct of individuals who may have had busi
ness dealings with the government. Neither the
King of Great Britain nor the German Emperor
would venture to arrogate such power to him
self. John Adams's attempt to enforce the sedi
tion law destroyed the Federalist party In Amer
ica. Yet Mr. Roosevelt, In the absence of law.
officially proposes to use all the power of the
greatest government on earth to cripple the
freedom of the press on the pretext that the
government itself has been libelled — and he is
the government.
We arf aware that for many years Mr. Roose
velt has been savagely displeased with the edito
rial conduct of "The World." It is tiue that we
have criticised him rharply and frankly when
ever we believed the public interest required.
Just as we have heartily commended and sup
ported him whenever we believed the public in
terest would thereby be 'advanced. Mr. Ro< -
velt's attacks on "The World" can be explained
only on the theory that he believes he can
muzzle the paper, and our recent Impeachment
Of his veracity seems to have been the last straw
that broke his autocratic back.
It is true that "The World" printed the public
reports concerning the Panama Canal affair
which resulted from William Nelson Cromwell's
appeal to the District Attorney's offlcei during
the recent campaign to prevent the publication
«>f a story which was said to be in the hands of
the Democratic National Committee. It was
Mr Cromwell's own action which raised the
issue in the campaign.
It is true also that when Mr. Roosevelt made
his attack upon Delavan Smith "The World" called
attention to certain statements which Mr.
Roosevelt must have known to be false or mis
leading, and appealed to Congress to end all
scandal by a full and impartial investigation.
If this be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the
most of it.
Mr. Roosevelt's lamentable habit of inaccurate
statement makes it impossible to accept either
his judgments or his conclusions. In his mes
sage he does not state correctly even so simple
a matter as the pretended causes of his griev
ance.
He says, for example, that "The World" as
serted that there was "corruption by or on be
half of the government of the United States."
No such charge was made by this newspaper.
He says it was asserted that there were im
proper dealings of some kind between agents of
the government and outside persons." No such
charge was made.
He says that "among tho»*e persons \\h>>. it
was alleged, made huge, profits' were Mr.
Charles P. Taft. a brother -'f Mr. Williai H.
Taft. then candidate for the Presidency, and
Mr. Douglas Robinson, my brother-in-law." No
such charge was made.
"The World" has never said that Charles P.
Taft or Douglas Robinson made any profits
whatever. Mr. Taft denied that he was con
cerned in the transaction in any way, which
denial "The World" published and accepted.
It would have been equally glad to print Mr.
Robinson's denial could it have succeeded in
obtaining one from him. as it frequently at
tempted. "The World" has no evidence that he
was associated with Mr Cromwell, and would
accept ttis word to that effect; for Mr. Robin
son is an estimable gentleman of high- charac
ter. whose reputation for veracity Is infinitely
better than that of his distinguished brother
in-law.
If "The World" has libelled anybody we hope
it will be punished, but we do not intend to be
intimidated by Mr. Roosevelt's threats or by
Mr. Roosevelt's denunciation, or by Mr. Roose
velt's jwwer.
Mr. Roosevelt's seething Indignation shout
"The World's" "libel upon the United States
government" is an exquisite indictment indeed,
coming as it does from a President who less
than a week ago officially insinuated in his
message that the Congress of the United States
was composed of scoundrels who amendM an
appropriation bill because '"Congressmen did
not themselves wish to be investigated by
Secret Service men."
No other living man ever so grossly libelled
the United States as does this President, who
besmirches Congress, bulldozes Judpes. assails
the Integrity of courts, slanders private citi
zens, and who has shown himself the most
reckless, unscrupulous demagogue whom the
American people ever trusted with great power
and authority.
We say this not in angpr but In sincere sor
row. "Th*» World" has Immeasurably more
respect for the office of President of the United
States than Theodore Roosevelt has ever shown
during the years in which he has maintained a
reign of terror and vilified the honor and hon
esty of both public officials and private citi
zens who opposed his policies or thwarted him
in his purposes.
So far as "The World" is concerned its pro
prietor may go to jail, if Mr. Roosevelt suc
ceeds, as he threatens; but even in \-,u\ "The
World" Will not cease to be a fearless champion
of free speech, a free press and a free people
It cannot be muzzled.

WILY INSURGENT MOVE
RILES ATTACK IX HOUSE.
Effort to Have Special Committee
Xarned Barely Defeated.
[From The Trlbun* Bureau.]
Washington, Dec. 15.— Representative Augustus P.
Gardner, of MBMftchOMtta, came within 13 votes
at bringing about the. passage of a resolution In th<s
Houee to-day which would have required the ap
pointment of a. committee of eight to con»lder the
necessary changes In the rules, and which would
have capped the onslaughts of the -insurgents"
with victory, for this session at least.
Mr. Gardner firßt moved to discharge the Commit
tee on Foreign AfTalrs from further* consideration
of the resolution calling on the Secretary of Stala
for a statement as to whether he ha* in his posses
sion information as to whether or not the British
House of Commons has appointed a committee to
report on the advisability of changing its rules, and
that the resolution be eonsldeced by the Ho'.se.
The motion of Mr. Gardner prevailed, 14fi to 143,
and thereupon lie offered an amendment eliminat
ing all reference to the demand on the Secretary
of State for information, and leaving in the resolu
tion simply the provision for the appointment of
eight members to report on the question of revising
the rules. .
Messrs. Payne (Sew Tork) and Dalzell (Pennsyl
vania) were quickly on their feet with points of
order! Mr. Fitzsorald (Democrat, New York) up
held the contenfion of Mr. Gardner.
In an elaborate opinion the Speaker sustained
H MI Dalzell and Payne, holding that the char
acter of the resolution had been changed in such a
way as to render It non-privileged. Mr. Payne
moved to lay the appeal on the table, and on that
motion a rollcall was forced. By a vote of yeas
143 nays ISS, "present 4," the Speaker was sustained.
The resolution then, on motion of Mr. Gardner,
after he had further attacked the rules of the
House, was laid on the table. 167 to 42, which has
the effect of killing the whole proposition.
After having lain dormant for many months the
bill to codify, revise and amend the penal laws
of the United States wm again taken up for con
sideration In the House to-day. A good deal of
discussion was at once aroused over an amendment
by Mr. Garrett (Term.) 'prohibiting the trans
mission through the mails of any advertisement or
other information bearing on futures in connection
with stock transactions where the product or
article which is the subject of contract could not
actually be delivered
Following an explanation of his amendment by
Mr. Garrett, Mr. Campbell (Kan.) assailed ths
Xew York Stock Kxchange, d'ciaririg; that less
than 10 per cent of its business was legitimate.
Jlis statement was challenged by Mr. Fitzgerald
iN. V.), who read from a message o; President
Roosevelt in which the President paid that th«
great bulk of the business of the New York ex
change was legitimate.
Mr. Campbell disputed the assertion Rnd declared
that he wa3 urgririK the adoption of the amend
ment "in the interest of legitimate business on th*
New York Stock Exchange." Hta vigor of speech
put the House In a turmoil, and th* debate be-
Oa Me e S sfs en Ga!ne S (Term.). Henry ,Tex.» and Will
lams(Miss.) advocated the amendment, whUe
aiJ=si<= Parson* (N, V.>, Alexander tN. V.). Moon
fpenn I and Madden- (lit) argued aiainst it. The
Bubjwt whs still pending when the House ad
journed.
AT ODDS OVER CHANGES.
New Constitution of Municipal Art
Society Finally Adopted.
After an exciting discussion, the Municipal Art
Society last evening, at h meeting In the. National
Arts Club, adopted, v.ith some changes, the constl
tution Of the society, redrafted by a committee ap
pointed on October 12. Nearly every section, as
changed, was the subject of critical opposition, as
was shown by the numerous amendments offered
and warmly debated.
An amendment by John Martin MM finally adopt
, l;l that the object of the society should be "to
advance in .very possible way municipal art."
A lively debate was excited over the article In
the constitution providing that of the eighteen dl
rectorr. three should be architects, three painters
and three sculptors. It was finally carried.
An amendment changing that section of the new
constitution providing that the president and two
vice-presidents phall not be eligible for election for
more than two successive terms to "three suc
cessive years." called forth n hot protest from.
Frederick S. Lamb.
"It la all very well." exclaimed Mr. Umb, 'for
Iconoclasts to suggert royal roads to heaven, *>ut
leaders must Wsad. If this opposition his anything
to show, let It come forward and twsea the whole
Class Of directors out of existence."
H. Van Buren Magonlgie said he could not com
pete with Mr. Lamb in heat or eloquence, but since
he had been a director be had learned of consider
able dissatisfaction in the society. He thought
three years was long enough for a director to serve.
Mr Lamb's speech, however, had its effect and the
nmendment to the new constitution wal lost. The
n«\v constitution provides that fifty members shall
constitute a Quorum.

SCHWAB OX THE TARIFF
FAVORS PRESEXT DUTIES.
Say* Donmward Revision on Steel
Schedules Would Do Harm.
IFrom Th» Trlbun* Bvrsaa 1
Washington. Dec. 15.— The testimony of Charl-s
M. Schwab, presidpnt of th<* Bethlehem Steel Com
pany and ex-president of the United States Steel
Corporation, before UM Ways and afCaBS Commit
tee to-day, was considered by most of those who
heard his answers and observed his ability to give
figures which seemed to stand a rißld cross-exam
ination as decidedly effective. Mr. Bchwall said
that he came voluntarily, but that his appearance
was not without some coercion by the committee
was evidenced by the fact that he had no formal
statement to make when he took the stand, but
contented himself with answering questions. After
b« had submitted to four hours' examination, all
Of which was conducted In the best possible spirit,
Mr. Schwab announced that he favored a continu
ance of the present duties on steel and iron, and
that he was afraid a radical downward revision
would resuli In great damage to the business in
terests of this country.
\vhii« Mr. Schwab practically a lmitted that th*
conditions which existed 'nine years ago would have
permitted a reduction in the steel schedule at that
time, he said that the cost of every item enterins
Into the manufacture of steel rails had Increased
to such an extent that the present conditions must
be chanced to permit of tariff reduction.
"in five years there will not be a BesMßMr steel
converting worlu left in the United States," Mr
Schwab predicted. "Bessessef steel will be of r.>>
use. The same is true of structural steel as well
as rails. They will all be made by the 'open
hearth' process of manufacture. Costly changes
In the construction of the plants will be necessary
to make the Improvements in the method of man
ufacture."
Mr. Schwab also declared that within tea years
the "open hearth" process would be superseded by
the electric system of manufacture which was be
ing developed in Germany.
"These changes in the pro. of manufacture in
crease ths« quality of the steel,* 1 he continued, "but
they also slightly Increase the cost of production."
Mr. Schwab said he was not In favor of any
change in the tariff on steel and steel products. "A
moderate change would not make a material differ
ence." he said, "but a radical chanfte might da
considerable harm."
Chairman Payne ai the outset asked Mr. Schwab
about a letter which had been referred to by a
previous witness. This letter was written by Mr.
Schwab to Henry C. Frick on Hay 16, IMk and
said that rails were being made for le«s than |U a
ton, or nearly $7 less than the cost in Kngland. IB
the letter Mr. Schwab predicted that the Carnegie
Steel Company, of which he wag then president,
would be able to Increase Its net sarnmff to $3,000.
000 a month, and said It could sell all of its surplus
production abroad at a profit nearly equal to the
profit on domestic sales. The steel man said that
the letter in regard to which he was betas. Ques
tioned had been prepared at Mr. Krick's solicitation
and was written in an optimistic vein.
Mr. Bchwab i:hvi a detailed statement ->f the cost
of making pig iron and steel rails, whles indicated
that the present cost of manufacturing pis iron
was* $14 a ton. as compared witl $8 a ton In 1X99.
while the cost of -!•••' ratla to-day was $21 M a ton,
.is i ompared with $12 a tori nine .years ag".
Mr. Schwab said that h«» was not aware ■■' any
understanding among the I'nited States Steel Cor
poration, the German steel syndicate and the Kng
llsh steel rail syndicate. He said that there was
not as much competition asaong the domestic
steel manufacturers In the home market i* tn the
foretcii nM»rk.-i
Mr Bchwab saM that the pries of steel raj was
fixed t>\ m<>-<t of tli** American manufacturers at
$2S In 1395 i>r laW; that in ISPS, during the "steel
war." this price was not maintained, but that fol
lowing the war II wi again agreed ti> maintain,
that price. Since then n<> stanufacturei had at

Mr. Schwab declared that the average manu
facturer* was entitled to ■ profit i>f from 10 to a»)
per cent, and thai the nost successful manufact
urers should ha\e ■ pet csnt net profit. He said
thai Ike railroads wire not la favor of a . luctton
