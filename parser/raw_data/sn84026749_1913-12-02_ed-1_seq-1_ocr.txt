FULL TEXT OF THE
MESSAGE
Gentlemen of the Congress :
In pursuance of my constitutional duty to "give to the Congress
information of the state of the Union," I take- the liberty of address
ing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me, particu
larly to engage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of all who
study the welfare and progress of the Nation.
I shall ask your indulgence if J venture to depart in some degree
from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the
many matters which have engaged the attention and called for the
action of the several departments of the Government or which look
to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long,
very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which I should
have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of
the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in care
ful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention
of your committees and of all Members of the Congress who may
have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as con
stituting the very substance of the business of the Government, makes
comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.
The country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world,
and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cor
diality and sense of community of interest among the nations, fore
shadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more
readily each decade do the nations manifest their willingness to bind
themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes
of frankness and fair concession. So far the United States has
stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope
and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to
u oco nF intfimotinnql frientiShin bv ratifvinz the several treaties
l-IW V"JW Ul -.. ..-.-.-...-. -.-
of arbitration awaiting renewal by
it has been the privilege of Uie Department.of, State togain the assent
in principle of no less U-sn'thirty'-on? nions, reprcsent'rig four-fifths
of the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which
it shall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy
arise which can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplo
macy they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by
a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation determines its
course of action.
ONLY ONE CLOUD UPON HORIZON.
There is only one possible standard by which to determine con
troversies between the United States and other nations, and that is
compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obliga
tions to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily
to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obliga
tions and the interpretation of those already assumed.
There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself
to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain
prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered
his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on all hands,
indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or
dealt with by the Government of the United States. We are the
friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than
its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our
neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of
our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty,
Mexico has no government. The attempt to maintain one at the City
of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been
set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national au
thority. It originated in the usurpation of Victoriano Huerta, who,
after a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional President, has
at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself
dictator. As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in
Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary
and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the citizens
of other countries resident within her territory can long be success
fully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long continued, to imperil
the interests of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands imme
diately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his
purposes, in despite of the constitution of the republic and the rights
of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and
hateful power, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose
eventual downfall would have left the country in a more deplorable
condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the
respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time
willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been completely
isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling,
and the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged
to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end
comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed
Mexico by the concert and enepry of such of her leaders as prefer the
liberty of their people to their own ambitions.
URGES HASTE ON NEW CURRENCY LAW.
I turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under
consideration a bill for the reforn of our system of banking and cur
rency, for which the country wais with impatience, as for something
fundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free
from, arbitrary and artificial restrants. I need not say how earnestly
I hope for its early enactment int) law. I take leave to beg that the
whole energy and attention of the Senate be concentrated upon it till

Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, commander of the British
cruisers in Mexican waters, expected to meet General Huerta today.
Cradock, who is quartered at the British legation, had an appoint
ment with Foreign Minister Moheno, and was informed that Huerta
expected to receive him after that. The Britisher made it plain that
his call at the national palace would be merely a courtesy.

fourth time since he became the Na
tion's Chief Executive, appeared be
fore a joint session of the Senate and
House id the chamber of the latter
body shortly after 1 o'clock; today to

Jhe President received a general
ovation when he entered the chamber
t 1:07 .o'clock. d. proceeded tstlb
Speaker's rostrum, at the rear of
which were seated Speaker' Claris'
and Vice President Marshall.
Applause Is General.
The applause which greeted Mr. TnJ
son today was -more general than that
which, had been accorded upon pre
vious occasions, and conUnued for fully
a minute. Senators and Congressmen,
regardless of party ' affiliation, and
pracUcally every spectator In th,gal
Jery Joined In the demonstration. The
scene was truly Inspiring.
With her face wreathed In smiles,
lira. Wilson sat in the executive gal
lery. Across the rail. In the diplomatic
gallery, was the Secretary of State,
who Joined vigorously in the hand
clapping. Various other members of
the Cabinet were seated on the floor
below.
T he President began the actual read
ing of his message at 1:08 o'clock and--absolute
stillness Drevallpd In thA
chamber except for the sound of his
voice. hWen Mr. TVIIson reached that
portion of his message devoted to .Mexi
co, however, the applause was re
newed and the assembled legislators
I were evidently In srmDathv with th
I .valtlng game now played by the Preol-
dent and his predicUon that the fall ot
the Huerta government is near.
Secretaries Redfleld and Houston
were the first of the President's offi
cial family to reach the CapltoL They
took seats on the House floor and wera
followed by Secretaries Lane. Daniels,
and McAdoo, and Postmaster General
Burleson. Secretary Bryan went direct
to the Diplomatic gallery, where a num
ber of diplomats already bad assem
bled, -v.
Listen Eagerly.
The wife of the President was accom
panied by the Misses Margaret and
Eleanor Wilson, and Miss Helen Wood
row Bones. Members of the president's
family followed attentively the readings
of the message, which was spoken in
clear, firm tones, by the Chief Exe
cutive. The United States Senate entered the
House chamber at 1 :0t o'clock, and tho
I senators took seats asslgnea to tnem la

President of the United States."
As he mounted the rostrom. President
Wilson shook hands with the Speaker
and Vice President, and then turned and
bowed to the assembled legislators Who
stood upon their feet cheering.
Usual Curious Crowd.
The usual crush of the curious, who.
vainly sought entrance to the gallerled
of the House chamber, was seen for
more than an hour In advance of tho
anval of the President.
Although this was the fourth occasion
upon which the President appeared be
fore a Joint session of the legislative
branches of the Government, public In
terest held up. members of Congress,
doorkeepers and police officials were be
sieged with requests for admittance
cards.
Women predominated in the throngs
which assembled about the entrances
at the House end of the Capitol, and
many attempted to cajole the guards
Into permitting Just a peek Inside. The
rule is nonflexlble. however, and no
oody got Into the galleries except upon
the presentation of one of the cards
which were distributed among Houso
...id Senate members.
Kadi member of Congress recelvai
one ticket, and there was no 8Tftr
erowdlng of the galleries, as upon tha
day when President Wilson read hla
tariff message and made, his first ap
pearance before the Congress. Upon
that occasion two cards were allotted
each legislator and the galleries would
not hold all those who presented tickets.
When the House convened at 13 o'clock
the galleries were rapidly filling. An
.l-rht-mlnute business session w .-!..
after which the House took a recess
until 12:1a. at which hour it -was an
