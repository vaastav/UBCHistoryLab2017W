TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1S3S.
A Timid Leader.
We are afraid all Republican news
paper admonition to the present Con
gress ivlll toe wasted. The same
c-onsideiatioiis that have made of the
President's message a document with
out character will affect the Republican
leaders. From the prominent men and
journals of the country not bound by
partisanship to applaud everything
that comes from a Republican Presi
dent, there are only expressions of sur
prise and disappointment at the lack of
spirit and courage in a message that is
supposed to outline the policy of the
Administration which it is the custom
of a faithful Congress to promote. That
the majority In the House looks upon
the President as the party leader was
apparent when it required the services
of the Democratic minority in the pre
ceding session to force his reluctant
feet to take the final step against Spain.
Save under such pressure, nine-tenths
of the Republicans will go only so far
us the President suggests In his commu
nications to Congress. Therefore It was
expected even by those who are ac
quainted with the timidity of his lead
ership, that yesterday's message would
indicate his policy in relation to many
subjects that have been under public
discussion notably the government of
our new possessions, currency and tar
iff legislation, both domestic and insu
lar, and the Nicaragua Canal.
If Congress is guided by the Presi
dent's suggestions, only or chiefly, there
will He nothing to make this session
memorable, although it follows the
most memorable period in our national
l:fe since the close of the Civil "War.
There is no reason to look for anything
heyond the routine of appropriation
lh1s with idle discussions of matters of
no geneial interest. The Speaker of the
House is known to oppose the policy of
expansion that is the most important
feature of the McKinley Administra
tion and will not lend his aid to efforts
io strengthen the popular sentiment.
Those who stand by the President have
received no encouragement from him to
maintain the high tide of enthusiasm
his preservation of the fruits of victory
has aroused among the people. His
careful exclusion from his message of
everything that would lead his ardent
supporters in the House to promote his
ideas, is a wet blanket to their hopes
and a distinct encouragement to the
Senators who are opposed to the ratifi
cation of the treaty with .Spain.
Foreseeing this rebellion, it was the
part of a strong leader to declare his
poliey with vigor and firmness and in
such terms as would have disposed
of all opposition in the Senate.
Instead, he reveals in every line his
shrinking timidity his own seeming
lack of enthusiasm ana confidence.
Thus he invites attack and depresses
those who, under a positive declaration
of war against the unpatriotic provin
rialists, would go Into the conflict from
lh first with a rush that would make
victory easy and glorious. The
President has virtually announc
ed that he is afraid, and trusts
to personal work among the leg
islators for support rather than to the
conspicuous merits of his cause. After
leading this message no one will be
surprised that he allowed Shatter to
command an invading army and tliat
he did not incontinently remove or sus
pend his Incompetent Secretary of War.
He does not show a single quality of a
leader. He has left open a rare oppor
tunity for a Democratic minority. Un
der the guidance of a spirited expan
sionist, the Democrats could enforce in
stant discussion of an insular policy
and wrest from the timid Republicans
the credit of the grandest achievement
for America since the successful revo
lution that secured its independence.
The President has rejected his great op
portunity. A message that c t fined it
self almost exclusively to the fruits of
the war and insisted on the Importance
and magnitude and eternal benefits of
the coming of age of the grandest re
public in all time, would have set the
country on fire with the enthusiasm of
a destiny splendidly advanced. It
would have been the subject of Repub
lican eloqueno. in Congress and would
have cowed nrii repressrd every ad
verse critic it ' Senate or In the
Speaker's chair Tt: President is not a
leader and his message is .a virtual
confession that he is embarrass d lw
an achievement that should be his
boast and his fortress.
The Horrors of Havana.
Among the Inexplicable mysteries of
the war, the conditions of the surren
der of Manila are not the most perplex
ing and exasperating. The apparent in
difference or impotence of this Govern
ment as to the situation at Havana ever
since the signing of the protocol is
easily first In importance, chief in the
seriousness of its consequences and un
paralleled in the absence of a conceiv
able cause The protocol provided for
the Immediate evacuation of Cuba by
the Spanish army. American title was
established by the signing of that docu
ment by M. Carabon. That the Presi
dent regarded his authority as instantly
supreme appears from the directions
which he issued for the admission of the
supplies for the starving carried into
Havana harbor by Miss Barton and a
little later by agents of the Govern
ment. The refusal of Blanco to admit
the supplies except under impossible
conditions is known to have angered
the President, who proposed to make a
j practical assertion of his authority, but
did not do so. When Blanco of
fered to allow the provisions to enter
as a matter of favor the President de
clined, refusing to acknowledge Spanish
sovereignty and Its power to confer a
.favor, affirming that it was this nation
that was alone supreme In Cuba.
Yet in spite of this attitude, he sent
the supplies elsewhere, leaving the
wretched of Havana to starve. He left
Blanco in full command to Insult, over
ride and Ignore the American Commis
sioners; to sell public property that no
longer belonged to Spain; to collect Im
ports on duties and local taxes that be
longed to Cuba; to rob the banks, keep
political prisoners in jail and arrest
Cubans wlio cheered the American flag;
to persist In the Weyler policy of murder
by starvation; to prohibit business and
prevent the Cubans from working their
farms; to issue proclamations slander
ing the American nation, promote dis
trust and hatred of Americans and dis
tribute arms among the Cubans to en
able them to resist American occupa
tion. !3"anco maintained the unsanitary
conditions which threatened the lives of
natives and Americans and which mur
dered Colonel Waring. His troops and
the undisciplined volunteers were per
mitted to terrorize the community and
threaten the looting and destruction of
the city. When, at last, the rebellion of
his unpaid regulars frightened him, he
resigned, gathered up his plunder and
with a parting expression of his veno
mous hatred and defiance of everything
American, fled to Spnin. lie left the
community in a horrible plight. Besides
the unpaid regulars, liable at any mo
ment to become riotous and massacre
the people, he failed to disarm the un
paid and undisciplined volunteers who
are worse- even than the Spanish sol
diers. Among the police Inspectors he
left the worst criminals who had been
imported from the penal colonies to ter
rorize Havana.
His going did not make any change in
the intolerable situation. Our Govern
ment, through its Commission, has
recognized his successor to exercise the
sovereignty of Spain, and has shown no
disposition to rescue the wretched city
from its suffering and its increasing
great danger. It seems that we are not
to interfere with the progress of Wey
lerlsm until the Spanish troops are em
barked for Spain. The conditions to
cure which we entered into a Avar with
that country have been allowed to con
tinue four months after the signing of
the protocol, which provided for the
immediate surrender of Cuba. Thou
sands of Cubans have died and other
thousands have suffered the persecu
tions that spin-red us to war, during
these four months. Why?
The news from Havana gives a
faint indication of the situation.
A little child is brutally murdered by a
Spanish soldier for singing a Cuban
song, and the fiend is acquitted by the
Spanish coui;ts. Where that is possible,
what undescribed horrors must there
be? Why they are permitted nobody
has attempted to explain.
In its fears that the Congressional in
vestigation into Secretary Alger's malad
ministration of the war will not be thor
ough and Impartial, the New York Times
forgets that most members of Congress
have been at home, away from the influ
ence of the Secretary of War. for five
months. They know just how fierce pop
ular indignation is and those who have
talked with returned soldiers know how
just the demand is for an Investigation.
On the whole, we are inclined to think
it would be better for Mr. Clioate to seek
an elective ofllce of some sort In a place
where there is a good, large, and sanguine
Irish-American constituency. Since the
London papers have unearthed his speech
in 1893, In the course of which he exhorted
all sons of Erin to go home and cut the
throat of the cruel and bloodthirsty lion,
it is doubtful if Choate would be alto
gether persona grata at the Court of St.
James. What he said may have been ut
tered in the "heat of argument" and only
for local and temporary political effect.
But it is also probable that objection to
his distinguished personality will also be
made In the "heat of argument" in Eng
land and that the argument in question
will be eminently conclusive.
Senator Faulkner and the others who are
now serving In their last Congress have
the comfort of knowing that they will not
sit in the chamber after Depew begins
his blighting legislative career. Ills com
ing is a foregone conclusion, though the
Vanderbilts have made no friends In
Washington by choosing this method of
getting rid of him.
For some centuries man has had more
or less sport with the gamecock; but a
few days ago, in Uniondale. N. J., a
gamecock started out with the inten
tion of turning the tables and having
sport with men. He strutted off his
owner's premises one afternoon and
started out to sec the town. The first
representatives of the town that he saw
were a lot of school children, whom he
frightened quite seriously. Emboldened
by his success, and probably much
amused at the spectacle of several large
beings scampering away from his aggres
sive beak and spurs, like, let us say,
chickens before a man, he continued on
his way and presently met an old gentle
man named William Green. The bellig
erent bird flew at Mr. Green, with the
evident Intention of reducing his antago
nist to a nutmeg grater. Mr. Green
kicked. So.did the gamecock. The lat
ter varied the process by flying over Mr.
Green's hejrd, knocking off his derby hat,
and ? -'-- " - ios. so that It
looked like considerably less than thirty
cents. The agile bird dodged between
its opponent's legs, tackling like a foot
ball player, and Mr. Green found out how
much real fun there Is In a thoroughbred
gamecock when he is out for the purpose
of amusing himself instead of his human
backers. Finally the owner of the fowl
appeared on the scene, and by the base
method of overpowering the Insurgent by
force of numbers two human beings to
one bird secured the runaway and car
ried off a squawking armful of feathers,
muscle, and needle-like spurs.
Of course, the encounter was Incon
venient for Mr. Green, who swears that
ho will make the gamecock's owner pay
for his spoiled headgear; but It Is a useful
object lesson for all that. It Is good for
us to remember now and then that the
human race has not all the bravery there
is In the world. An old hen flying at
a dog who Is worrying" her chickens
shows as much courage as an American
woman would In attacking an elephant.
Despite his final defeat, It looks as It tho
gamecock had rather the best of It In
this New Jersey combat.
Tlie President has asked almost nothing
of the Congress which, has entered on Its
last session nothing except an appro
priation for a new Temple of Justice. It
is sorely needed and the recommendation
ought to be adopted without trouble.
Colonel Lee, the chief quartermaster at
Chickamauga, does not agree with most
of the witnesses who have testified as to
the neglect of requisitions there. He
thinks he was efficient and that the de
partment was well managed. So far he
is alone in that opinion.
If ex-Chief McCullagh, of the New York
police, intends to organize the police force
of Havana his first act should be to ar
rest and export the criminals who are
now acting as police inspectors there.
These men are the most brutal murderers
and all-round criminals that could be
found In tho African penal colonies of
Spain. They were Imported by AVeylcr
to add the terror of their presence to the
horrors of starvation.
CAPTAIN CARTER'S CASE
WILL BE LOOKED INTO
Step to He Taken to Find Out Why
Vo Kieeutive Action Him
Heen llml.
Congress Is going to take a peep into
the mysterious cabinet in wMch the ca'.e
brated court-martial case of Capt, Car
ter, of the army engineers, is supposed to
be concealed, with a view to forcing fi
nal action. It is understood that a reso
lution will be introduced in the Senate
calling upon tne President or the Secre
tary of War to inform the Senate w!-at
steps have been taken to prosacute Capt.
Carter upon the charges made against
him in connection with the river and
harbor Improvements in the Savannah
River. The resolution will also state that
if proceedings have becrlhad against the
offending otlicer the Senate d'sires to
know what the findings of tho court
martial are and why there has been so
much studied delay in the formal pro
mulgation of the findings of said court
martial. There is no special disposition upon tho
part of the friends of the resolutions to
persecute Capt. Carter, but In considera
tion of the reluctance on the part of the
War Department officials to take the re
sponsibility for the unaccountab'e de'ay
in announcing the decision In this p cu
liar case there seems to be no other way
of protecting other river and harbor ap
propriations to be provided for during
the coming session of Congress.
The President tho Secretary of War
and the Attorney General, for some un
explained reason, are not ai xlous to let
go of the case, and yet those v. ho are offi
cially responsible for the delay refuse to
admit that the status of the case is fully
established. Under the circumstances
there is no telling when the case will be
promulgated through the usual channels
of the War Department, simply because
Capt. Carter's friends possess sufficient
influence to prevent final action by the
President.
ALGEit RELIEF BOARD
HAS A VERY DULL DAY
Colonel Ilecker mid the I'nyiunMtvr
Gene-nil Expected n Witnesses,
Hut Failed to Appear.
There was nothing done by tho Alger
Relief Commission this morning In the
way of taking testimony. It was an
nounced that Col. Heckcr. of the trans
portation division of the quartermaster
general's office, who recently returned
irom Cuba, and the paymaster general,
would give the committee the benefit of
their observations, but neither one put
in an appearance up to noon.
The members of the committee spent
the morning hours discussing facts al
ready obtained and what may 1)3 obtain
ed during the remaining days of its
work.
It is now said that the committee hopes
to hear all testimony before the begin
ning of New Year, and that as soon
thereafter as the work can be done make
its report.

ENGLISH COMMENTS
UPON THE MESSAGE
The Tall Mall Gazette Considers It
CoiiMpIcnoas Uecnu.se of Its
Moderation.
London, Dec. 2. The Pall Mall Gazette
says that considering tho circumstances
under which it was composed and the na
ture of the events with which it is neces
sarily concerned, President McKinley's
message made be said to be conspicuous
in respect of Its moderation. Speaking of
the Nicaragua Canal, the Gazette says
the two nations stand upon an equal foot
ing in respect of its control, and this fact
will afford the United States a ready
made opportunity for practically demon
strating her present assurances of friend
ship. "We are convinced," the paper adds,
"that when the time comes there will be
no disposition on the part of the United
States to question our position of friend
ly equality."
The St. James Gazette says that new
issues have been faced in a broad-minded
way and the solution of various problems
suggested upon largo and generous lines.

SOKE PBESS OPINIONS ON
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
New York Herald: "Pity the President
had not said more or written less in his
message to Congress!
"True to his habit of throwing down the
.reins, the President in this inspiring mo
ment of our history has nothing to sug
gest, takes no Initiative, strikes the key
note ot no new policy, lie merely collates
a dreary report presenting numerous
facts, and leaves the rest to Congress and
to God. There are some facts, however,
which he does not give.
"In the 7,000 words devoted to a history
of the war one searches in vain for any
expression of sympathy or regret for the
gallant soldiers left to suffer, and many,
alas! to die Of starvation and fever In hos
pital and camp through official Indiffer
ence or incompetence. On this subject,
which so deeply moves the heart of tho
people, nothinjf.is said, 'i hre is no sucn
word in the message as Alger or 'Alger
ism. New York Journal: "President McK nley
has a habit of 'disappointing expeeta:icn.3
in his messages, and in thf portentous
document submitted to Congress yea erday
he did not ileviaie from the ru'.e. 'i he
unprecedented circumstances of tho tima
invited and seemed to compel the produc
tion of a state'paper that should tank as
one of the colossal landmaiks of our po
litical history. But Mr. McKinley suc
cessfully resisted every inducement to pro
duce such a paper. The proof sheets
of all the 'M,Wi words of the message
might have been left unguarded over
night without tempting any journalistic
burglar to appropriate them.
New York World: "The public interest
in the President's message centers In . is
observations on the war and its settle
ments. "As the proclaimed object of the war
was to pfcure the fre-dom and Independ
ence of Cuba, the first Inquiry wl 1 natu
rally be as to the President's attitude
toward that island, the sovereignty of
which has been surrendered by Spain.
Even the most captious foreign critic
must admit that the President stands
squarely by the resolutions of C)tgre. s.
"Next in order and of more immediate
interest and Importance are tho Presi

Baltimore Sun: "The President's mes
sage reviews the controversy which led
to the war with Spain and discusses the
military and naval operations and the
measures which were taken to prosecute
tho war to a successful close. It will
prove a distinct disappointment to tho-e
who expected that It would fully outline
the policy of the Administration in regard
to territorial acquisition and other im
portant issues connected with the war
with Spain.
"The President makes no recommenda
tions in regard to the future of our new
possessions or the form of government to
be established therein. Discussion of this
subject, the President says, will be ap
propriate after the treaty of peace shall
be ratified. 'In the meantime, and until
Congress has legislated otherwise,' he
will 'continue the military governments
which have existed since our occupation,
and give to the people security in life
and property and encouragement under a
just and beneficent rule.' "
Philadelphia Inquirer: "The me.-sase of
the President to Congress is largely a
summary of the events or the past year.
There are some recommendations, nota
bly regarding an increase or the aimy and
navy, the building of a merchant murine,
tho reissue or the United States notes
only in exchange tor gold, and an appeal
for an appropriation large enough to
make a suitable exhibit at the Paris Ex
position. That there are not more recom
mendations, and especially devoted to
problems growing out of the war, is be
cause the treaty of peace is not yet sign
ed." New York Tribune: "It is the distin
guished lot of President McKinley both to
make and to write history wirii a master
hand. For more than twenty months he
has been the central figure, active, puis
sant and triumphant, in one of the most
gigantic dramas of the age. Today he
lays before the world the written record of
his deeds, impartial, dispassionate, con
cise, comprehensive, marked throughout
with the mature judgment generally found
only In the historian in posterity. The
message is. In Its major part, a volume
of authoritative history; a sequel to that
of a year ago. It sets forth few theories,
there Is no need of them when we have
already reached the stage of accomplish
ed practice. It contains few arguments
save those which are most direct and con
vincing of all, the arguments of deeds and
facts. Self-restrained, self-reliant and
frank and lucid in an exceptional degree,
it is the typical utterance of one who is
at once a man of action and a man of
thought, and always and above all a man
of principle.
"To everyone who wishes to have right
knowledge of the oilgln and circumstances
of the colossal crisis through which this
nation has just passed, and from which it
is at this moment emerging resplendent
and victorious, the Presldeut's words are
to be commended as a manual as authori
tative In history as their author has been
and is In the statecraft of the nation."
New York Sun: "The well-known facts
concerning the origin of the war with
Spain, its energetic prosecution, and its
triumphant conclusion, occupy somewhat
more than one-third of President McK n
ley's second annual message to Congress.
"The first passage which indicates poli
cy for the future follows directly after
the President's announcement that he
hopes to be able soon to lay before the
Senate a definitive treaty of peace. The
Indication is negative, but not the less
significant.
"The word Imperialism does not occur
in this modestly phrased .record of an .1
lustrious year In an Administration that
will be forever memorable; but the spirit
of imperialism in the new American sens-2
is there, in every line of the document."

and silver by the various countries of the
world, during the calendar year 1S&7, as
follows:
The total coinage of gold and silver by
the various countries of the world during
the calendar year 1S97 was as follows:
Gold, $437,719,345; silver, $167,700,297. Total,
$605,479,642.
The total metallic stock and uncovered
paper in the world, as estimated on Janu

$2,322,S0O,0O0. Grand total, $10,919,300,000.
The report recommends the discontinu
ance of the Carson mint and the St.
Louis assay office, and suggests the erec
tion of a suitable building in Seattle for
the assay office there, to accommodate
the Increased gold deposits there. Atten
tion Is called to the deficit in the bullion
accounts In the mints In San Francisco,
Philadelphia, New Orleans and Carson,
amounting In the aggregate to $530,681.67.
During the existence of the national
banking system up to the close of the
year ended October 31, 1S5S, 5,151 national
banks were organized. The number In
operation is 3.59S. Of the closed associa
tions, 1,194 were placed in voluntary liqui
dation by the shareholders, and 359, insol
vent, in charge of receivers. On October
31, 1S97, there were in active operation
3,617 associations. During the past year
56 were organized, 69 placed in voluntary
liquidation, and 7 failed, including one
of tho banks In liquidation, above refer
red to, making a net reduction during
that period of 19 banks.
Referring to loans and currency, the re
port says that the interest-bearing debt
July 1, 1897, included unmatured United
States bonds outstanding in tho amount
of $517,320,000. fto material change ap
peared in the debt statement In the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1S9S, but on June 13,
a circular was published inviting public
subscriptions for $200,000,000 3 per cent
bonds authorized by the act of June 13,
189S.
The public response to this invitation
was not confined to any section of the
country, and during the thirty days pre
scribed in the circular as the period for
subscriptions there were received 232,224,
of $500 and less, accompanied by" full pay
ment for the. bonds, and over SS.flOO. In
sums greater than $500, 'accompanied In
each Instance by a derkfsit of '1 per cent
ot the amount subscribed. The total of
subscriptions of $500 and less wa3 $100,
444.5C0, and the total In greater amounts
than $300. including certain proposals
guaranteeing the loan, amounted in the
aggregate to more than $1,400,000,000.
As provided by the circular, the allot
ment of bonds to subscribers cf amounts
greater than $500 began Immediately upon
the close of the books July 14, the smallest
subscriptions being first allotted until
those of $4,400 and less had been reached.
There was a residue, ascertained to be
about $2,500,000. which was allotted pro
rata among the subscribers of S4.5C0, each
subscriber for that amount being award
ed the sum of $1,390.
The foreign commerce of the fiscal year
is shown to have been phenomenal. The
exportatlons of products of both field and
factory exceeded in value those
in value those of any ,
and tile grand total of
,. t
preceeding year,
exports was tne largest ever
recorded. ;
jurciKii commerce ine yesr s expiriiuuns ;

in connection with the operations of the
tariff the report says:
"D-oraer:ic Industrial enterprises are un
qucbtionab'y benented by the tariff act of
liS J, designed as well to encourage home
industries as to increase the revvnurs of
the Government. By reason of the fact
that importers. anticIpaLng the passage
cf the act referred to, provided themselves
with large stocks of merchandise of every"
description, the tariff or 1S97 cannot be re
garded as fairly tested by the receipts Im
mediately following Its passage. As an
illui-tration of the correctness of this view,
it may be stated mat during the first four
months cf the fiscal year 1S the receipts
from customs (exclusive of the duty on
tea provided by the war revenue law)
amounted to $52,776.00, which is $4.e33.02S
in excess of the receipts for a similar pe
riod in any year since 1592.
"A reciprocal commercial agreement has
been entered inlo between the United
States and France, under the provisions of
sccticn 3 of the tariff act or 'tf, and ne
gotiations with a similar object In Uew
are in progress with otlur countr.c-s.'"
Considerable space is given in the re
port to the enforcement q.f the law gov
erning the importation, manufacture and
sale of intoxicating liquors in the terri
tory of Alaska. The ditiiculties of such
enforcement are set forth and methods
adopted by the department to suppress
the Illicit trafile are described. The sal
mon fisheries in Alaska are also referred

the- United States.
Thf- British sealing Sleet, however, has
continued Its operations during the past
year, both on the northwest coast and in
Behrlng Sea. From the copy of the ap
proved minutes of the Canadian privv
1 council, transmitted to this Government
( in accordance with the provisions of the
I Paris award, it appears that 30 British
sealing vessels operated on the northwest
j coast during the past Spring, as coni
, pared with 32 British vessels sealing dur
; ing the Spring previous. The total catch
during the Spring cf 1SGS was P15S1. in-
viuuiiiir a canoe eaten ov iiwunns or &r.
as against G.ioft skins taken by the same
fleet during the season of 1S97. which
number included a canoe catch of 1.01S.
The only hope for the preservation of
the Pribilof Islands herd of seals, it is
believed. lie- in the complete cessation of
pelagic sealing. With this accomplished,
and the breeding females allowed to bring
forth their young without molestation
from deep-sea hunting, natural causes
will operate to bring about a rehabilita
tion of the rookeries and restore a valu- j
able Industry to Its former importance.
During the patt year work has tca
prosecuted on forty-three buildings, of
which fifteen have been completed. No
new buildings have been authorized since
the last report. The total amount expend
ed on public buildings during the year
ended September 30. 1S9S. was $3,795,709.15.
The necessity for a hall of records In
this city. In which may be safely stored,
against accident from fire, the large ac
cumulation of valuable documents whicn
now encumber the files of this- and co
ordinate departments, is again called to
the attention of Congress. The Secretary
of War, in 1S7S, called attention to the
dangerous situation of records of great
value in the quartermaster general's of
fice. At various times Congress has recog
nized the situation and has enacted legis
lation, the earliest being in the sundry
civil bill, approved August 7. 1S2. in which
the supervising architect of this depart
ment was directed to make a report to the
following session of Congress, in regard
to the matter. The supervising architect,
on January 17, liS3. reported 'n favor of a
site known as "Armory Square," between
Sixth and Seventh Streets southwest.
Plans and specifications were prepared for
the building on this square, and it wa
estimated that the probable cost would
be $1,036,054.
January 4. 1S9S, the Secretary of the
Treasury, the report says, addressed a
letter to the secretary of the Senate Com
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
reporting on the Senate bill authorizing
the acquisition of a site at the corner of
Ohio Avenue and Fifteenth Street. Objec
tion is made to the site in the present re
port, however, owing to its remoteness
and the fact that It is liable to inundation.
Tho finances of the District of Columbia
are referred to as. follows:
The net expenditures on account of the
District of Columbia for the fiscal year
1S9S were JG.319.725.S4. The net revenues de
posited in the Treasury on this account
for the same period were $3,727.S93.10.
Under the operations of the sinking
funds, the net reduction of the bonded
debt during the year was $611,600, and of
the annual Interest charge, $21,442.
The District appropriation act approved
June 30, 1S9S, authorizes and directs the
Secretary of War to resume work on the
Aqueduct tunnel, and reappropriates the
balance remaining of the appropriations
for increasing the water supply, to be ad
vanced out of the revenues of the United
States, and not subject to the conditions
of the capital account created by the act
of July 15, 1SS2. and also appropriates an
equal sum out of the surplus general rev
enues of the District of Columbia. These
appropriations were made immediately
avallable.
The immigration question is referred to
at some length. The report says:
"The report of the commissioner general
of Immigration shows that 229,23) immi
grants arrived during the year, a de
crease, compared with the preceding fis
cal year of 1,533. The number of those de
barred and refused landing was 3,22?. as
compared with l.biO for the preceding
year, and was composed of 417 alien-contract
laborers, 2,261 paupers, 25S diseased
persons, 1 Idiot, 12 Insane. 2 convicts. 70
assisted Immigrants, and 199 who were re
turned within one year after their ar
rival, having become public charges.
"More particular attention has recent
ly been given to the cases" of Immigrants
suspected of being afflicted with disease.
During the fiscal year ended June 30. 1S97,
only one Immigrant was debarred as be
ing afflicted with a "loathsome or danger
ous contagious .disease," while during the
last year 25S were denied admission on
that account. These exclusions have fre
quently resulted In the separation- of fam
ilies, the debarred immigrant being re
turned to the country of his nativity,
while his relatives are permitted to jour
ney to their destinations in this country.
Having the prevention of tlfis in view, and
to establish a more efficient guard against
the adwission of "loathsome or dangerous
contagious diseases." the commissioner
general of immigration suggests the expe
diency ot examining immigrants at va
rious ports or embarkation, instead of
after their arrival in this country.
"The recommendation that Ieg's'atlv
provision be made whereby the bureau of
Immigration may be put in communlca-

tion with State immigration organiza
tions, with a view of effecting a better
distribution o arriving immigrants. Is ap
proved. There Is beyond question ten
dency on the part of Immigrants toward
the cities, just as there is sneh. a tenden
cy among our rural population. AT social
problem involving relief to unemployed
labor at congested centers of population
may be partially solved by efforts direct
ing Immigrants to fields where their ser
vices may be in demand. This course will
also lesen the likelihood of their becom
insr public charges."
The total number of Chinese" persons ad
mitted to the Cnlted States In the last
hscal year Is shown by the report to
have been 7.1&5. Of thla number 5,273 were

FORCIBLE REMARKS
OF SENATOR DAVIS
CiinHtU- I oniment on Recent Refer
eneex of Senor Sna.Htn. Convcrn-
1i:k Work la 1'nriM.
Paris, Dee. 5. Senator Cushmn K. Da
vis, chairman of the American Senate
Foreign Relatione Committee and a mem
ber of the International Peace Commis
sion now in session here, mado some un
official remarks yesterday concerning tha
recent diatribe of Senor Sagasta. in which
the Spanish premier declared that tha
work of the American Commissioners had
been shameful In its character, together
with other discourteous references ta
America and her representatives.
Senator Davis adds:
"Sagasta's declaration is malapropos.
His specific accusation of spoliation oa
our part is senile. We won our new pos
sessions in a war provoked by Spain.
"We have been more than generous la
Paris, just as we were too forebesrin in
Washington before the war. Giving lib
erty to oppressed peoples is no spoliation.
No other nation would give Spain $,90a,
000, or even twenty cents. The European
nations, whose abstention Sagasta be
wails, would have stultified themselves
had they Interfered.
"Sagasta says the work of our Com
mission is the 'greatest shame in history."
The 'shame is that Spain has been per
mitted to keep her abominable yoke upon
millions of our fellow-men so long. When
Spam capped the climax of her historic
shame by wholesale plunder, heartr ndiig
starvation and appalling murder in Cuba,
tho hitherto sluggish conscience of our
people w at length sufficiently aroased
to put a P to tho most red-handed
crime of "hi and. perhaps, of any other
age. ,
Sacata threatened the revelations of
the Red Book. They have no terrors for
us. Granting liberty to Cuba, Torto Ri
co and tbe Philippines, so far from being
what the Spanish minister calls the re
estabMVihment of brute force. Is one of the
crowning works of the closing century.'
