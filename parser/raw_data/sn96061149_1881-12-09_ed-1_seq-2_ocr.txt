Contemporary Comment.
A "Washington dispatch of the
7tli inst. says that comments on
tho President's message among
Senators and Congressmen of all
shades of political belief appears
to be that it is a very able docu
ment. Opinions as to the correct
ness of its conclusions vary, of
course, according to party affilia
tion and individual sentiment, but
there is a general agreement that
in clearness of style, dignity of
tone and force and freshness of
argument, it is far above the aver
ago level of the annual presiden
tial messages for a number of
years, and that it indicates the
possession by its author ot a much
higher grade of ability than has
heretofore been commonly attrib
uted to him. There is some disap
pointment among Pacific coast
representatives at the absence of
any hearty recommendation for
lcjrislative action to restrict Chi
nese immigration, especially as the
President takes pains to suggest
that Congress should carefully re
gard the '"interests and suscepti
bilities'" of the Chinese govern
ment in legislating upon that sub
ject. On the other band it is
noticed with gratification that the
message does say that legislation
is necessary to carry the treaties
into pffoct, and also that the Presi
dent significantly (though not so
openly as might be desired) refers
to the evils of unrestricted Chinese
immigration when he says that our
government "views with concern
the efforts to seek replenishment
of the diminished population of
the Sandwich islands from outward
sources."'
President Arthur's vigorous ut
terances upon the Mormon ques
tion have given unalloyed satisfac
tion to tho Pacific coast people
and all other opponents of polyg
amy, and will probably have a de
cided influence upon the result of
pending contest in regard to ad
mission of Campbell as an anti
ATormon delegate. It is considered
highly probable that the Republi
can members of the house will
solidly sustain speaker Keifer in
the position taken by him to-day
in favor of Campbell, and these
combined will also, it is believed,
bo re-in forced by Democratic
members whose abhorrence of
Morraonism will lead them to fore
go the possible advantage of em
barrassing the Republican speaker,
which is apparently the purpose of
the opposition led by ex-Speaker
Randall, so that on the whole
Campbell's admission seems to be
pretty well assured.
The message was generally re
ceived with satisfaction and com
mendation. Some disappointment
was expressed that he did not
more distinctly and definitely
enunciate a policy. This feeling,
however, seems confined to those
who hope for the domination of a
faction of the party. Republicans
generally think that the President
means to entirely ignore factions
and to heal dissension, and are
glad that he refrained from saying
anything that would be seized
upon by either faction. Western
Republicans, especially those from
silver-producing states, are not
pleased at the recommendation to
limit silver coinage, but they con
sole themselves with the belief
that Congress will not carry out
that recommendation.
The Canadian Globe of the 17th
says President Arthur's first mes
sage certainly does not err on the
score of a lack of comprehensive
ness, for its author surveys mankind
from China to Peru, with most ex
amplary jairuess. Canadians will
be pleased to learn that United
States troops have orders to avoid
all communications with British
Indians crossing the frontier in
quest of sustenance. Mounted po
lice ought at once to have similar
magnanimous instructions extend
ed them. Referring to the Pana
ma canal, the President maintains
the perfectly indefensiblo doctrine,
that the building and control of
the canal concerns the United
States and not European powers.
If this doctrino is insisted upon
ard the United States attempts to
enforce it -trouble is inevitable.
None of the European nations can
consent to any one power domina
ting over so important a highway
as this canal will be.
NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
Good Advice.
Every one who is half a century
old must have heard or read of
"Tom Corwin, rof Ohio," who,
twenty-five years ago, was one of
the most noted and popular men
in the United States. While he
was Secretary of the Treasury a
young man presented- himself to
him for a clerkship. Thrice was
he refused, and still he made a
fourth effort. His perseveranco
and spirit of determination awak
ened a friendly interest in his wel
fare, and the Secretary advised
him, in the strongest possible
terms, to abandon his purpose and
go to the west, if he could do no
better outside of the Department.
"My young friend," said he, "go
to the northwest, buy 1G0 acres of
Government land or, if you have
not the money to purchase, squat
on it; get you an ax and a mat
tock; put up a log cabin for a
habitation, and raise a little
corn and potatees: keep vour
conscience clear and live like
a freeman your own master,
with no one to give you orders,
and without dependence on any
body. Do that and you will be
honored, respected, influential and
rich But accept a clerkship here,
and you will sink, at once, all in
dependence; your energies be
come relaxed, and you are unfitted
in a few years for any other and
more independent position. I may
give you a place to-day, and I can
kick you out to-morrow; and there
is another man over there at tho
White House who can kick me
out, and the people, by and by,
can kick him out; and bo we go.
But if you own an acre of la;id,
it is jour kingdom, and 'our cabin
is your castle you are a sover
eign, and you will feel it in every
throbbing ojf j'our pulse, and every
day of your life you will assure
me of your thanks for having thus
advised you.1' The advice holds
good to-day.
The river Tyne has been deep
ened and improved of late years,
till, from being a comparatively
unimportant point Newcastle now
ranks third among English ports,
13,717 vessels having entered there
last year.
