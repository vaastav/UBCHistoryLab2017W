THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President McKinley sent hi9 first
annual message to Congress Monday,
it is a very lengtliy document and
deals thoroughly with all the im
portant affairs of the Government.
The President congratulates the
people that the Nation is at peace
with all the world and that prosper
ity, lxavirony and good will reign su
preme within our borders.
After tubing a shy at the Dingley
tariff law in which he says its full
effects have not yet been realized,
the President tabes up the currency
question and discusses it from the
standpoint of the powers that elected
hioi. Below will be found his re
commendations on this and other im
portant questions now before the
people:
t ."I earnestly recommend as soon as
the receipts of the government are
quite sufficient to pay all the ex
penses of the government, that when
any of the 'United States notes are
presented for redemption in gold and
are redeemed in gold, such notes
shall be kept and set apart, and ouly i
paiu out m exchange for golti. TIdh
is an obvious dniy. If the holder of
the United States note prefers the
gold and ge's it from the government
he should reeeivo back from the gov
ernment u United S.aies note without
paying gold in exchange for it. The
reason for this is made all the more
apparent when the government is
sues an interest hearing debt to pro
vide gold foe the redemption of Unit
ed Sta.es notes?u no i-iutereat bear
ing debt. Surely, it should not pay
them out again e::cepton demand and
for gold. If they are put out in any
other way they may retuvu again to
be fol'owed by another bond issue to
redeem them?Alio'her iuterest hear
ing debt to redeem a non-interest
bearing debt.
"In my view it is of the Utmost im
porinnce that tho government should
be relieved of the business of pro
viding for all the gold required for
exchanges and o:;por.s. This respon
sibility is alone borne by tho govern
meut without any of the usual and
necessary banking powers to help it
self. The hanks do not f el the strain
of the gold redemption. The whole
strata rests upon the government, and
the size of the gold reserve in the
treasury lias come to be, with or with
out reason, the s-gnal of danger or
security.. This ought to he stopped.
"Jf wo are to have an era of p-os
perity in the country, with suilicient
receipts for the expenses of the gov
ernment, wo mny feel ro immediate
embarrassment from our present cur

will be ever present menacing us as
long as the existing system contin
ues. And besides, it is in times of
adequate revenues and business Iran
quility that the government must pre
pare for the worst. We cannot avoid
without serious consequence, the
wise consideration and prompt solu
tion of this question.
"The Secretary of the Treasury has
outlined a plan in great detail for the
pu-pose of removing threatened re
currence of a debted gold reserve and
save us front future embarrassment
on that account. To this plan I in
vito yohr. en reful' consideration.
"1 concur with the Secelary of the
Treasury in his recommendation that
national banks be allowed to issue
notes to the face value of .the bonds
which they have deposited for circu
lation, and that the tax on circulating
notes secured by deposit of such bonds
be reduced to ono half ono per cont
per annum. I also join him in recom
mending that authority bo given for
the establishment of national banks
with a minimum capital of &?,*>,000.
This will enable the smaller villages
and agricultural regions of the coun
try to be supplied with currency to
meet their noeds.
A
t
"1 recommend that the issue of Na
tional Hank notes oe restricted to the
denomination of ten dollars and up
ward. If the suggestions I have here
in made shall have the approval of
Congress, then I would recommend
that national banks be required to re
deem their notes in gold."
The Cuban question is discussed at
co-.siderable lengcli. The President
regards the recognition of the bollig
ereucy of me Cuban insurgetsas now
unwise and therefore inadmissable,
but spy8 that i? this *tep hereafter be
deemed wise as a measure of right
and duly, the Executive will take it.
The President urges the ratification
of the treaty for the annexa
tion of Hawaii, and puvb thai
the questions that have arisen be*
twoen Japan and Hawaii are in a
fair way of settlement.
The President urges the speedy
cons'ruction of the Nicaragua canal

He merely states tlmt he ap

opto this time no agreement line

Alaskan matters ere discussed. A
hotter system of government for the
pou'do of that mecctj of the gold soelf
er is urged. Tlie TTesiuent says that
i' the reports <>f the sufferings of the
people now there be further verified'
every effort at any cost should be
uiade to carry them relief.
The President lakes up the salo of
the Union Pacific Railway and says
the Government received the full
amount of its claim against that road.
1 n regard to the sale of the Knusas
Pacific rodroad, the* President urges
that the Government be authorized to
qualify as a b>dder at the sale in or
der that its rights may be protected.
To qual'fy the Government will be
compelled to mako a deposit of $900,
000 and the President believes that
under the act of J887 the Government
has the power to mako the deposit
and in the absence of any action by
Congress ho would direct the Secre
tary of the Treasury to mako the nec

we've had some "big- men In the show at
one time and another. One of the big
gest we ever htfd used- to^eomb his hair
with a section of a picket.fence. That
was a part of the street show when we
mode the parade in a town. Usually
we bad an arrangement Infadvan'ce with

A French PliyBlclwn Say* Rnrnl Peo
ple Suffer Mont from Cancer. .
A medical student, before he can
begin active service in France, must
write a treatise, on some medical sub
ject which will be approved by the gov
ernment experts, says the City'
Journal, Dr. Noel, who recently ob
tained his diploma, wrote ft treatise on
cancer, which has attracted the atten
tion of scientists. According to his
opinion cancer is due to vegetable
germs, which infect the human sys
tem, either through manual contact or
through absorption or inhalation of
the poison with water or food. Ac
cording to statistics cancer prevails
more in districts surrounded by for
ests and along the banks of rivers than
in places where vegetation is scarce.
Dr. Noel began a careful investigation
around his home at Lyons. Birch, elm
and willow trees predominated. He
tested the sap from thousands of these
trees and in a score of specimens found
| cancerous germs. A dbg, inoculated
; with these,?in a few days showed every
symptom of cancer. Dr. Noel states
that the percentage of deaths from
cancer is much greater among persons
whose business it is to handle wood
and vegetation than those employed in
trades where wood is not used.

All 8ii|)|crlber? Should Rend the
Following Law and Avoid 'trouble.
* ' ' v* "1, , ,
1. All subscribers whb do not
give express notice to the contrary
are considered wishing to continue
their subscription.
2. If subscribers order, the discon
tinunnoe of their periodical the pub
lisher may continue to send it until
all arrearages are paid. ' A
3. If subscrioers refuse or neglect
to take their periodicals from the
office to wttldh they are directed, they
are responsible nntil they have set
tled their bills and ordered them .dis
continued.
4. Subscribers moving to other
places without informing the pub
lisher, and the papers are sdnt to the
former address, they are held re
sponsible. V-. y
5. The courts have decided that
refusing to take periodicals from the
offioe or removing and leaving them
uncalled for, is prima facie evidence
of iutended fraud.
6. If subscribers pay in advanoe
they*are bound to give notioe at the
end of the time they do not wish to
oontinue taking it, and the subscriber
