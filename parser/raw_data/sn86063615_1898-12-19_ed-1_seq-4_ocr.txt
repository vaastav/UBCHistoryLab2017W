THE PIIEMIIEVP IN THE SOI TU.
The bnef tour of President McKinlej In
ic South will exert a good iniluence. not
nly upon the people with whom he came
i contact, Dut upon all Americans. Tiie
ourageous aid patriotic utterai ccs of the
resident and the manner in which the-e
cclaratior.s were received were eloquent
manifestations of the national sentiment
that has been growing stronger ard
stronger in recent ears.
The most gratifying aspect of the various
demonstrations made in honor of the pres
ident is the evident acceptance of h-s pro
found slnccritv. The strifes of politics are
apt to obscure the better natures of men
and the nobler actuations of nation- It
Is difhcult for the head of a great political
partj . even when he becomes the head of
the whole government, to secure full cred.t
for exalted impulse. President SBKinley
lias been s-ingularlj fortunate inuillis re
ipcct. He has. from the beginning of his
political career, enjojed the confidence and
inspired the regard of political opponents
as well as of political allies There has
been no utterance or circumstance to com
promise the popular estimate of his pat
riotism. There has been nothing to raise
e question as to his personal sincentj and
cthcial honestj in giving full recognition
to the South. The people of Atlanta, of
Montgomcrj and of Savannah have re
ceived the president, not as a Republican,
not as a Northerner. not as a politician,
but as an American an American broad
enough to embrace with ommon frater
nity the whole people, regard!c-s of the
past.
Southern comments upon the president's
speeches are cloquentlv reciprocal in fellow
feeling. They recognize the boldness and
the authority and vet the delicacy of the
chief executive's woid- Another might
have meant as well and jet given the im
plosion of patronizing.
President McKinlej ha", at various
times, shown himself to be a great dip
lomat, but in this instance in delivering
a delicate and patriotic message to a
sensitive people he owes hi- great success
to liis goodness of heart rather thin to
his skill in dlplomacj.

In Ills message to congre-s President Mc
Kinley declared in relation to the Nica
ragua canal that "our policy more impera
livelj than ever calls for the control of
this canal b our countrj," and this is as
sumed in English circles to mean that with
out further ado the Americans intend to
nhrogatc the Clajton-Bulwer treatv. Mr.
Henrj Norman, the London correspondent,
Eavs: "To those who understand the ques
tion the president's words came as a
thuniJerlKjlt. It is possible that the full
text of the message will show that Englisn
"leelings are without foundation, but as
;abled it simplj places the president in the
position of deliberated ignoting the -olemn
nati engagement. Public comments nave
xea peilectlj dignified and fricndlj. but a
lrong feeling Is nevertheless underliirg
hem '
The Clajton-Bulwer treatj was mad" in
509. und it dealt with the building of a
Sinai across the Central American isthmus
ts terms aie strong enough and binding
nough, so far as that goes, for it pro
Ides that "neither partj shall ever obtain
or itself anv exclusive control over in
hip canal, or elect or maintain fortlhca-
ions in lis vicinity, or oecupj- or fortify or
- -olonize or assume or exercise any domm
on over Nicaragua, Costa Rlc , the. Mos
lulto coast, or anj part of Central Aincri
a, nor will either make use of anj' prolec
ion which either affords or maj- afford for
ha purpo-e of erecting or maintaining any
uch fortifications, or of occifpjlng, forti
jiug, or colonizing Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
be Mosquito coast, or anj part of Central
unerlca "
There are Tnanj other sections liesldes the
ne we have quoted, and eacli bears upon
lie Intended agreement that England, and
he United States should alwajs have joint
outrol over anj canal that might be built.
ut tha whole gist of the treatj- is found
j the quoted section together with tlio stip
1 at Ions under which most Americans coll
ider the treaty abrogated. England v. as
rst to break the letter eif the agreement,
he established colonies and fortifications
n the Mosquito coast, and it is the Amcri
an contention that she thus forfeited anv
Ights or claim of rights that otherwise
he might have had. The treatj has never
een formally annulled, however, and. while
aera has been correspondence about It in
desultory way for manv jears, no satls-ictorj-
agreement has been reached bj the
tate departments.
That tb English people are disposed to
ssurrect this old treatj and make trouble
)r the proposed American canal Is not a
5regone conclusion by anj means The
'.atement by Mr. Norman that Great Brit
ln baa taken offente at President Mc
lnley'a message is not borne out by the
ondon papers The London Spectator, in
hat Is said to be an inspired artlrle, takes
ic position that England, without wall
m to bo asktd bj- th American people,
loiild ablegate tha treatj. "America."
ijs this papir, "will be compelled bj its
astern interests to keep a larj,e Hut in
ic Pacific The Americans will also need
large fleet in the Atlantic Promptlj to
oblllze thee llccts and concentrate their
rength, theie must be a canal across the j
isthmus. Now, by the Clajton-Bulwer
treaty America cannot exercise complete
control over such a. canal. The treat has
prevented the making of the canal No
private company can undertake the con
struction of it without the assistance of
some great government. America will not
allow Germany or Trance to dig it, ind
Englard will rot do the work alone or in
conjunction with anj other government.
Then let us do the sensible thing and allow
the Claj ton-liuluer treatj to be abrogated
after tne u-ual diploni itic formalities."
In the course of it- argument the Specta
tor speaks verv bluntl of the contingencies
of possible war "If v e were at war with
the United States, and we owned the canal
jomtlv, she could seize it befoie we could
and u-e it to our disadvantage If England
were at war with anj other power America
would be neutral, and therefore the canal
would be neutral. If the canal should be
under the control of Nicaragua or Colom
bia. France or Germanj or Russia could
seize it in war Hut America owning it,
such a seizure would be impossible. There
fore if the canal is ever to be built. Amer
ica, according to our interists, ought to
control it '
In conclusion, the Spectitor advises Eng
land to t-ke the initiative with a propo-al
to declare the treatv off before the Amer
icana get around to asking it, "for when
they are forced to ask for a thing the
sometimes are not polite about it I-et
England take this step of her own accord
and it will make America a still stronger
friend of hers '
Presuming that the Spectator speaks for
the English government, and the presump
tion is a reasonable one, it becomes appar
ent that Johnny Bull does not propose to
make any diflicultie- over our government
building the Nicaragua canal and that in
all probabihtj the CIijton-Bulwer treatj
will soon become a r. minisccnce.

Manv- Democratic joun als are just now
having .spasms over the sjstem of govern
ment proposed for our new territorj, the
islands of Hawaii Before considering the
nature of thise attacks it will be prolitable
to review bnelly the main features of the
territorial government as recommended bj
the Hawaiian commission.
The legislature of the terntorv is to
consist of fifteen senators elected for four
j ears, and thirtj representatives elected
for two j ears. The qualifications for a
senator are that he shall be a male citizen
of the United States, 30 jears of age, must
have resided In the territory three jears,
and mjst be the owner in his own right of
$2,00) worth of property or have a early
income of $1 0i) A representative must be
25 jears old and possess propertj worth
$y) or a j earlj Income of $J3 Voters foi
representative are required to be able to
speak, read and write the English or Ha
waiian language, and those voting for sen
ator must, In addition. pose-s propertj
valued at $1,0"0, or an income of $o00 The
bill covering the commissioners recom
mendations fixes the status of citizenship
in the following paragraph: "All white
persons, including Portuguese and persons
of African descent, and all persons de
scended from the Hawaiian race, on either
the paternal or maternal side, who were
citizens of the republic of Hawaii nnme
dlatelj prior to the transfer of the sover
eigntj thereof to the United States, are
hereby declared to be citizens of the United
States '
In effect thus bill excludes the Chinese
and Japanese from citizenship, and estab
llshes both propertj and educational qual
ifications as a requisite to the right of
franchise, and It Is on account of this ex
clusion and the establishment of these suf
frage requirements that tl e Democratic
journals of the I'nited States are having
spasms. As an example of what Democrat
ic papers aie "-ajing m this regard we
quote the few following sentences from a
recent editorial in the Nev. 'i ork W orld
"The plan proposed for Hawaii is about
the most astonishingly un-American thing
that our history ha- vet produced It is a
combination of ollgarchj and absolutism.
Under it a great part of the population
is entirelj disfranchised More important
still, it is disfranchised because of 'race'
a thing forbidden bj the constitution in
anj state of the Union The proro-al is
therefore that the national government shall
do in a terrltoij what the constitution for
bids anj stttc to do within its own borders
But the bill not onlj cieates an oligarchy
of voters representing a mlnoritj of the
population It cst-ibhshes prescriptive qual
ifications for suffrage."
In the first place the bill does not pro
scribe voters from voting on account of
race. It merelv prohibits cert Un races from
acquiring citizenship, just as the Chinese
are now prohibited In the United States
and there is a wide difference between this
and the act of denjing a citizen the ngut
of sutirage on account of race. The con
stitution sajs that no citizen shall be de
prived of the right to vote on account of
race, but the constitution does not sis that
men of all races hive the right to become
citizens
Aside from the fact th it m inj of the
states have in more or less degreo estab
lished propel tj and educational qualifica
tions to go with the light ot voting, .nil
without stopping to argue that tne be-t
sentiment of our countrj Is coming to re
gard these qualifications as highlj essen
tial, it maj be said that such an objection
comes with ill trace from the jour.ials
of a partj ll at has been doing its best
for thirtv- j c irs to di-franchise the negroes
of the United State- These journals ma,
find under their very no-es Southern laws
and Southern constitutions which have
for their purpose the disfranchisement of
large bodies of citizens on account of racs
and thej need not go to far-olt Hawaii to
find examples of a voters' oligarehj No
longer ago than Iat summer a constitu
tional convention in the state of Louisiana,
made up almost entlrelv of Democratic
delegat. , adopted a constitution vvli'h
has for Its avowed purpote the disfran
chisement of negro voters, and the twl-ts
and turns made bj this remarkable instru
ment in order to evade the provisions cf
the national constitution are sinuous
enough to be amazing.
In order to disfranchise the negro this con
stitution provides both education il and
propertj qu iliftcations for the right of vot
ing, and jet it fixes the conditions so that
the poor and ignorant writes ma., not in
anj- large measuie be deprived of suffrage
Filst, tho voter is required to it-id and
write some 1 inguage, but this is not made
ib-xlutel esscntij fur .ui lllliriale per
uiii is allow eil to vote if ir j.ajs taxes f II
as much as Sj) worth of piopeitj. Caa
sldeied together thee requitements would
disfranchise SO WO negroes and 2i,ia whites
out of a total voting popul itlon of lJ)Cci.
nnd It became necessarv to twist the instru
ment in order to allow these whites to vo.e.
So the following provision wus incorporat
ed: "No male person who was, on Janu irj 1,
1S57, or at anj date prior thereto, entiiM
to vote under the constitution or statutes
of anj state in the Union wherein be then
resided, and no son or grand-on of anj
such person not les than 21 jears of ago
at tho dato of the adoption of this consti
tution, shall be denied the right to register
and vote in this state bj reason of his 'all
ure to pos-ess "the edueatlonal or propertj
qualifications prescribed bj this eonstita
tion "
As the negro was not enfranchised in ls(T7,
his son or grandson cannot vote without the
required qualifications, whereas this section
so nearlj admits all of the illiterate whites
that not more than 2 per cent of the 1 X
will be deprived of the right of suflrage.
It is not necessjrj to eliaracteiize a partv
which permits and indorses such an outrage
as this in one of the states, while making
a virtue of its opposition to the disfran
chisement of Chinamen in one of the terri
tories. "IPiTYUT coaiEitons."

The reception President McKinlej 1- hav
ing in ihc South is one. of the most -Inking
illustrations given of the influence a
winning persoinlitj has in polities In his
journej southward, Mr. McKinlej has not
passed through j. state which gave him an
electoral vote Everj one of the cities lie
will visit are oppo-ed to him politlcallj
If the Issues of ls'-G were presented again
for decision next week it 1 almost certain
th it all these states and cities would cast
a vote overwhclminglv- agilnst the partv
Mr McKinlev repe-ents But notv. lth
standing this fact thev are giving him a
reception which for heartiness and cordiality-
could not be surpas-ed in a stronglj
Republican state or cltj.
The expl ination cannot be found in the
natural tribute of respect a people pavs
to power and to the man who temporanlj
wields it. A Democratic president visited
the South a few vears ago. but while
crowds were present ti receive him thre
was a noticeable lack of spontaneous en
thusiasm He came, saw and went away
again The impression lie made was ut
terlv negative The real reason for Pres
ident McKinlej s popularltv wherever he
goes is his personal!! This has given
him a vastlj wider influence and has stood
him in crises to better purpose than his
other qualities as a statesman It was
Mr. Cleveland s utter lack of this qualitv
which made h s administration such a fail
ure and will leave it in historj as an
interim diring which the countrj valtd
impatientlj for the time to come for him
to retire to private life Had be possessed
a winning personahtv Mr Cleveland would
not to-dav be almost forgotten and his
partj a wreck on the -ea ot politics Mr.
McKiiIej's possession of this quilitj is
i
shown bj the fact that his partj is
strorger aid more united and enthususiic
than it was the dav he was elected
Onlv a tew presidents in Amenean hi
torv have had this char leterl-tic in a
in irked degree Mo-t of them hive been
men of individu ilitj but tnev lacked a
winning per-onalitv. The presidents who
have had this qualitv are Washington, Jef
ferson, J ickson, Lincoln and McKinlej.
A ashlngton s personalis dominated the
firjt eight veais of the government. As
long as he was president antagonisms were
held in abejance and pirtj strife was
smothered Jefferson was the next pre
ident whose personalltj was the dominat
ing force in American politics lot jears.
Then came several negative presidents be
fore Jail. son, with his strong character
and stuping perso'ialitv, ."ppeared upon
the scene. It was his abilitv to v in and
hold friends more than his firmness and
aggre-sivmess that gave him his great iti

generuion a good sinre of which was a
witntss of the mastciful iniluence it gave
him After I liieoln no pipsulent with a
winning pe'--onaht appe ired until Mr.
McKinlej was iniugurited
It is noticeable tint the longest and most
peimanert advances in national aggran
dizement have been made during the administration-
of these presidents, whoe
per'Wnalitj gave them a forceful influence
In politics During "vv ashlngton s two
terms the government was orgamzfd out
of chaotic material Jefferson made the
greatest and most valuable addition of ter
ntorv to the Union lackson ass. rted the
doctrine of unitv and aroused a national
spirit which had never been evident be
fore Lincoln saved the government and

been done bv McKinlev to assure his place
among the epoch-making presulentr The
popularltv which this persom'Itv gains a
president is an important factor in gain
ing and u ing political iniluence Everv
one of the-e ; crsonah' j- presidents except
Tackson, was accused of weakness and
