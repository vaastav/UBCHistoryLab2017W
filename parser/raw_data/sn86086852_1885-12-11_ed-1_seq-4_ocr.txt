PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Continued from first page.
SIGNAL SERVICE
has been pro* *c.*ted during the last year with re
gulU of inert sing benefit to the country. The
field of instruction has been enlarged with a view
of adding to it* usefulness. The number or
stations in operation June 3fi, 1885, was 489.
Telegraphic reports are received daily from 100
stations Reports are also received from 75 Cana
dian stations, 375 volunteer obsei vers, 52 army
surgeons and military pests, and three foreign
stations. The expenses of the service during the
fiscal year, after deducting the receipts from Ue
military telegraph, wo* $707 502.97. In view of
the fact referred to by the secretary ef war, that
the work of this service is ordinarily of a scien
tific nature, and the further fact that it is wwh"*
ing larger proportion- t
more and lucre unsuited ' the fi-vri rules whicn
must govern the army, I f.~ .edned toag %
with him in the opinion that AJauiir be
ly established. If this is done, the Hcope ano ex
tent of it* operations should, as nearly I w I■
hie, lie definitely prescribed by law, and aiw*.
capable of exact ascertainment.
THE MILITARY ACADEMY
of West Point is reported as being in a high state
of efficency, and well equipped for the satisfac
tory accomplishment of the purposes of Its main
tenence. The fact that the class which graduates
next year is an unusually large one, has con
strained me to decline to make appointments to
2d lieutentancles in tho army from civil life, ho
that where such vacancies exist In these places
may lie reserved for such graduates, and yet it i<
not probable that there will i>e enough
vacancies to provide positions for them
all when they leave the military school
under the prevailing laws, and usage. Thoe not
thus assigned to duty never actively enter the
military service. It is suggested that the law n
this subject b'* changed, that such of these young
men ha are not at once assigned to duty ati r
graduating may be retained a a second lieutcn
ants in tin* army. If they desire ir, subject to as
sigrirnents when an opportunity occurs under
the rules as to priority of selection. The expen
diture* on account of the military academy of
the last fiscal year, exclusively of the sum taken
for purposes of appropriation lo the support of
lie army were 712 07.
Thu act approved March 5 IHHS, designed to
compensate officers and ♦ nlisUd men for the loss
of private properly while in the service of the
United Slat •*, is so indefinite in its terms, and ap
parently admits of • o many claims, the adjustment
of widen could wot have been contemplated, that
If it Is to remain on the statute ss>k, it needs
amendment
There should he a general law of congress pro
hibiting the construction of
mu no EH OVER NAVIOAIII.E
wiif. ry, in such manner as to obstruct navigation,
with provisions for preventing the raine. It
seems that under the existing statutes the gov
ernment connot intervene to prevent such a con
struction when entered upon without Its consent,
though when such consent is aske i and granted
upon the condition that the authority to insist
upon such a condilion is clear.
Thus It is represented that while the officers of
the government arc with great care guarding
against the obstruction*of navigation try a bridge
across the Mississippi river ui Ht, Haul, a large
pie, lor a bridge hits been built just below this
place, directly in the navigable channel of the
nver. If Hindi things are to *• permitted, a strong
argument is presented against the appropriation
of large Mums of money to improve the naviga
lion of tins and other important highway* of
commerce.

w hen our ua\ y w ill he such as befits our standing

THK COSTA . AKltVicr.
Tin* affairs of the postal service are exhibited
bv tin' report of the postmaster general. which
will be laid before you. Tin'postal revenue whose
tale of gam upon tin' using prosperity of 1 S>-
aml l.Vvl outstripped the increasing expenses of
onr guv wing service, w is checked by the reduc
lion m (he rate of letter postage, which took
effect with tin* iH'gntiing of October in the
latter c:ise, and it. diminished during the two
past fiscal years C\’ MO.iHHi in the proportion
*f f-VNiMXV in ism. to S22O,iHM in ISSS.
Natural growth and dev'U*pement have mean
time increased ex|H*ndltures, resulting In n de
fieiei ey in the roM'ime to nuvt the extvmn's of
I ho department of llv e and one fourth millions dol
lars forth** year 1 ssi, mid eight and one-third
million in the hist llscal year. The anticipated
iiKl natural revival of the revenue has been
oppressed and retarded bv th*' unfav*'n\ble bust
in*ss condition of the country, of which the p *stal
service is a useful calendar. Hie gratifying fact
is shown however, by th** report, that oiir return
mg prosperity isnmtkcd by again of £lSO.iVd in
the revenue of the latter half of hist year, over
th*’ corresponding period of tin preee*lmg year
The change in the weight of first class matter.
from a half ounce to nn on new and the reduction
bv one half of the rate of newspaper postage
which, under recent legislation, began with the
ciire nt > car, will oj*crate to restrain the aug
mentation of the receipts, winch otherwise might
have been exi'oeted to such a degree that the
■>cah' of cx|*ense may gain upon the revenue and
■ lux' nn increased deficiency l* b* shown at its
. ! se Net after no long period of reawakened
prosperity and by proper economy it is confident
iv anticipated that even the present low rates.
i;**w ns favorable as any country affords, will be
adequate t > sustain the cost of the service
The operation of the use of th* post office de
pari incut Is for the convenience and benefit of
ili*' people, and tin* method by which they pay
th* * hargvs of il ls useful arm of their public
service so that it may bo iust and impartial, is of
less importance I*' them than the economical ex
penditure* that the means they provide for its
maintenance and the duo improvement of its
agency, so that they may enjoy its highest use
tulnvss. A proper attention has been directed to
the prevention of wastu or extravagance, and
good reeulta appear (torn the report to have al
ready been accomplished.
1 approve the recommendation of the post
master general to reduce the chargee on domes
tic monev orders of live dollars ami less from
eight to five cents. This change will materially
aid those of our people who most of all avail
themselves of this instrumentality, but to w hom
thtf element of cheapness is of greatest import
ance. With this regulation the system would
still remain selfsupportuig, The free delivery sys
tem has been extended to seventy nine additional
eitiea duriag the year, and 178 now enjor its con
veniences. Experience has commended it to
those wboenjoy its beneflta, and further enlarge
ments of its facilities is due to other communi
ties
In th * cities where It has been establisded,
taken together the local postage exceeds its
maintenance by nearly one million tnree hundred
thousand dollars. The limits to which this system
is now confined by law has been nearly reached
and the reasons given just ify its extension which
is proposed. U was decided with my approba
tion after a sufficient exaxnin Hon, to ’be Inexpe
dient for the postoffice department to contract
for carrying
OC* rO&KIGS MAILS
under the additional authority given by the last
congress. The amount limited was oadeqnato to 1
pay all within the purvieu of the law the full
rate of fifty cents j*er mile. It would have U*en
unjust and unwise to have given it to some and
denied it to others. Nor could contracts
have been let under the law to all at a
rale to have brought the aggregate with
in the appropriation without such prac
tical arrangement of terms as would hare
violate*! the rate of sea and inland postage
which was proffered under another statute
clearly appears to be a fair compensation for the
desired service, being three times the price net*-
esary to secure the transportation by other ves
aels upon any route, and much beyond the
charges made to private persona for service not
leas burdensome.
Borne of the steamship companies upon the
refusal of the post master-general to attempt by
the means provided the distribution of the sura
appropriated as extra compensation, withdrew
the services of their vessels and thereby occa
sioned slight inconvenience, though no consider
able injury. The mails have been dispatched by
other means. Whatever may be thought of the
policy of subsidies of the line of public convey
ance or travel. I am satisfied should be done un
der cover of an expenditure incident vo the ad
ministration of a department, nor should there be
any uncertainty as to the recipients of subsidy or
any discretion left to an executive officer as to
tbe'distrlbution
If such gifts of public money are to be made
for the purpose of aiding any enterprise in the
supposed interests of the public. I cannot but
think that the amount to be paid and tne benefi
ce aries might better be determined by congress
thin ia any other way. The international con
gress of delegates from
THE POSTAGE ISIO.V COUNTRIES,
convened at Lisbon, in Portugal, in February
last, and iJler a session of some weeks the dele
gates signed a condemn amendatory of the
present postal union The convention, in some
particular, designed to advance its purposes. This
additional act has had my approval and will be
laid before you with the department reports.
I approve the recommendation of the post
i)tarter general that
ANOTHER ASSISTANT
be provided for hi* department. I invite your
consideration to the se.teral other recomraenda
tions'‘ontained in his report.
THE REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
eontaiiK a history of the conduct of that depart
m* ut of justice during the last year, and a num
ber of valuable suggestions as to the needed leg
islation, and I incite your careful attention to the
Si me. The condition of business in the courts
of the United States is such that there seems to
ie an imperative necessity for remedial legisla
tion on the subject.
Some of these courts are go overburdened
with pending causes that the delays in determin
ing litigation amounts in time to a deninal of jus
iiee. Among the plans suggested for relief is
one submitted by trie Attorney General. Its main
feature* are. the transfer of all the original juris
dictions of the circuit courts to the district courts
and an increase of judges for the latter when
necessary and additions of judges to the circuit
courts and constituting therein exclusively courts
of appeal and thus reasonably limiting appeal
thereto.
Further restrictions of the right to remove
the cause from the state courts to the federal
courts, permitting appeals to the supreme court
from the courts of the District of Columbia and
the territories only in the same cases as they
are allowed from state courts, and guarding
againrt an unnecessary number of appeals from
the <#f*uit courts. 1 approve the plan recom
mended and the legislation necessary for its
application to our judicial system.
marshal's fees.
The present mode of compensating United
State* marsh*ls and district attorneys should, in
my opinion, l>e changed. They are allowed and
charge agamst the government certain fees for
services, their income being measured by the
amount of such foes within a fixed limit as to
their annual aggregate. This is a direct Induce
ment for them to give their fees in criminal cases
as large os possible, in an effort to reach the max
imum sura permitted as an entirety. The natural
consequence is, unscrupulous marshals are found
encouraging frivolous prosecutions, arresting
people on petty charges of crime and transporting
them to distant places for examination and trial,
for the purpose of earning mileage and other fees,
and district attorneys uselessly attend criminal
examinations far from their place* o f residence,
for the express purpose of swelling their accounts
against the government. The actual expenses
Incurred in these transactions are also charged
the government. Thus the rights and
freet ofp of our citizens are outraged, and public
expenditures Increased for the purpose of fur
nlshing public officers pretexts for Increasing the
measure of their compensation. I think m ir
slials and district attorneys should be paid sala
ries adjusted by a rule which will make them
commensurate with the services fairly rendered.
In connection with this subject 1 desire to sug
gest the advisability, if it be found not obnoxious
lo constitutional objection, of inverting the Uni
ted Slates commissioners with the power to try
and determine certain violations of law within
the grade of misdemeanors. Such trials might
lie made to depend upon the option of the ac
cused. The multiplicity of small and technical
offenses, especially under the provision* of our
internal revenue laws, render some change in our
present system very desirable in the interests of
Humanity ns well as economy.
The district courts are now crowded with prose
cutions involving punishment on conviction of
only a slight fine The parties accused are
hai rasstvl by an enforced attendance upon courts
held hundreds ef miles from their homes. If
poor and friendless they are obliged to remain in
jail during months perhaps tuat elapsed before
a session of the court is held, and are finally
brought to trial surrounded by strangers, and
with but Id lie real opportunity for defense.
In the meintime frequently the marshal has
charged against the government his fees for an
arrest for Hie transportation of tho accused and
ibe expense of the same, and for summoning
witnesses brio re a commissioner of a grand jury
and a court. The witnesses have been paid from
l he public funds large fees and traveling expei s
•*, and Hu* coimniHsioner and district attorney
have also made their charges against the gov
eminent 'I his abuse Ir the ad mi (list ration of
our criminal law should bo remedied and if the
plan above suggested is not practicable some
other should lie devised.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report of tho secretary of the interior con
taining uu account of the operations #f this im
portant department and much interesting infor
mation will bo submitted for your consideration.
The most intricate an I difficult subject in charge
of this department i*
TIIK TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INDIANS.
I am satisfied that some progress may be noted
in their condition as a result of prudent admin
istration of the present laws and regulations for
(heir control.
Hut it is submitted that there is lack of a fix
ed purpose of policy on this subject which should
be suppled. ll is useless to dilate upon the
wrongs of the Indians, and as useless to indulge
in the heartless belief that because their wrongs
are revenged in their own altrocious measures,
therefore they should be exterminated. They
a r e within the care of our government, and their
rights a. e, or should he protected from invasion
by the most solemn obligation. They are prop
erly enough called the wards of the government.
And it should (k) borne in mind that this guard
ianship involves on our part, an effort for tho im
provement of their condition and tho enforce
ment of their rights.
There seems l i < .1 „ : cral concurrence in the
proposition that iha ultimate object of their
treatment should be their civilization and citizen
ship. Fitted by these to keep pace in the march
of progress with the advanced civilization about
them will readily assimilate with the mass of
population assuming the responsibilities n cess ary
to ibe protection incident to their condition. The
difficulty appears t< bo in the selection of the
means to be at present employed toward the at
tainment of this result
Our Indian population exclusive of those in
Alaska, is reported as numbering 2Tio.iH)d, nearly
all being located on land set apart for their use
and occupation, aggregating over 131,m0,000 of
acres. Tlicsolauds an* include 1 in the boundar
ies of 171 reservations of different dimensions
scattered in 21 states and territories, presenting
great variation in ellumte and the kind and mini
ity f their noils. Among Indians upon tliese
several reservations there exist fin* most marked
differences in national traits and disjne
Mtion and in their progress tow;;.ils civilization.
U Into some are lazy. \ Iclous and stubborn, others
are industrious, peaceful and intelligent, while a
p itum of them an* self supporting and inde
pendent, and have so far advanced in civilization
that thc> made their own laws, administered
through officers of their own choice, and cdu
eated their children in schools of their own es
tablishment and maintenance. Others still re
tain in squallor and dependence almost the sav
ttgery *'f their natural state.
In dealing w ith this question thegdesire manl
festetl by tin* Indians should not lie ignored. Here
again we Hint a great diversity. With some of the
the ribal relations is cherished the utmost te
nacity. while its hold mvii others is considerably
relaxed. The love of home is strong within all,
ano yet there are those whose attachment to a
p irticnlar sociality is by no means unyielding. The
ownership of their laud in severally*is much de
sired by •me. while by others, and sometimes by
>b the most civilized, such adhtributiouwould U*
m tcrlv opposed
! he v.n mi ion ef their wants grow ing out of and
connected w itli the character of their several lo
cations should be regarded. Some are upon
reservations most lit for grazing, but without
Mocks <>r herds, and some on arable land having
n agricultural implements, while some of the
res, in aliens are double the size necessary to
maintain the number of Indians now upon them.
In a few cases perhaps they should be enlarged
\dd so nil ibis difference in the administration of
the agencies; while the same duties are devolved
up n all. the disposition of the agents and the
manner ef their control with the Indians have
touch to do w ith their condition and welfare.
The agent who perfunctorily performs his dmv
and slothfully neglects a'l opportunities to ad
\ ilit •* their moral and pinsteal improvement and
fans to inspire them with a desire for better
things, wdd accomplish nothing in the direction
of t heir civil eat •> n. w htle lie who feels the burden
of ids imp, rtant trust, and has an interest in his
w ork, w ill by consistent example, from yet con
siderate treatment.and wed directed aid an 1 cn
ecuragement. constantly lead those under hs
charge toward the light of tkeir enfranchise
nieni.
TheTibt.r\ of all the progress which has been
made in the civilization of the Indian, I think
"ill disclose the fact that the beginning has
been religions teachings followed by an accom
panying secular education, while the self-saen
! -cmg aid pious men ami women who have aided
m tins good work by their independent endear
, r ha\c r i*r their rewanL the beneficent results
* f tb.cir la'H'r and t!w* consci nsness of Christian
dots wo I > erfomttsl. Their valuable services
- - uM Ih fully acknowledged by all who. under
n • laws are charged with the cvntrol and man
affluent f our liuih\u wards.
What lias been said indicates that in the profi
t'd condition of (he Indians no attempt shou'd
i e made to apply a fixed and unyielding plan of
action to their varied and varying needs and
c ic instances, an 1 the Indian bureau, burdened
a> i >s with their general oversight and with the
detail* of the establishment, can hardly pcs'ess
'b If of the minute particulars of th* cases
nettling treatment, and thus the propriety of
treating an iustru mentality auxllliary to those
a ready established for the care of the Indians
Mnrgesifi itself.
I recommend the passage of a law authorizing
ihe appointment of six commissioners. three tf
w ho.u shall In* detailed from the army, lo be
euarged w ith the duty of a careful inspected,
from time to time, of all the Indians upon pur
* ervations, or subject to the care and control*

•t nr • x.ict condition and needs, and determining
w fiat shall l* taken on behalf of thv govern
n.cnt to improve their situation in tie dnvctioii

fiat they are certain from such inspection what,
if mv. reservation may bo reduced iu area, and
in such cases what part not needed for Indian
C • upation may l>e purchased by the government
irom the 1 nd.aos and disposed of for their benefit
What if any lnd*acs*may with their consent be
remove 1 lo #fherres rvatioos with a view of their
eoncer (ration and the same on tbeir behalf of
ih<i*- a.*andoned reservations. What Indian lands
U" held a common should be allotted in se*er
aity in what manner and lo what extent Indians
upon the reservation can be placed under the pro
tection of our law* and subjected to their penal
lies and which (if ary) Indians should he Invested
with the right of citizenship. The powers and
functions of the commissioners iu regard to these
subjects should be clearly defined, thoagh ther
should be in conjunction with the secretary
the Interior, be given ad the authority to deal
definitely with the question present od xnd deem
ed safe and consistent.
They should be also charged with the duty
of ascertaining the Indians who might prop
* rly be furnished with implements of ag
nculture and of wnat kind, and in what
esses It e support of the government should
be withdrawn; where the present plan of dis
tribution of Indian supplies should be changed,
where schools may be established, and whe*e dis
continued; the conduct, methods and fitness of
agents in charge of reservations; the extent to
which reservations are occupied or intruded upon
by every unauthorized person, and generally all
matters relating to the welfare and improvement
of the Indians.
They should advise with the secretary of the
the interior concerning these matters of detail in
management, and he should be given power to
d*-al with them fully, if he is not invested with
such powers. This plan contemplates the selec
tion of persons for commissioners who are inter
ested in the Indian question, who have practical
ideas on the subject of their treatment.
THE EXPENSE OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
during the last fiscal year was more than six and
one-half million dollars. I believe much of this
expenditure may be saved under the plan pro
posed that Its economical effects would be in
creased with its continuance: so the safety of our
frontier settlers would be subverted under its
op-rat ion. and that the nation would be saved
through its results from the importations of
inhumanity, injustice and mismanagement ia
order to -arry eut the policy of allotment of
Indian land* in severalty, and when deemed ex
pedient it wi 1 be necessary to have surveys com
p ete of the reservation. and I hope tbat a pro
vifh n wifi be made for the prosecution of this
work.
THE APACHES.
In May of the present year, a small portien of
the Chiricahua Apaches, on the White moun
tain reset ration, in Arizona, left the reservation
and committed a number of murders and depre
da uosupon tne settlers in that neighborhood
Though prompt and energetic action was taken
by the military, tbe renegades eluded capture
and escaped iuu Mexico, the formation of th
country through *hich they passed, through ac
quaintance with the lame, the speed of their
esc Apr* and t‘e manner in which they scattered
a n i coo ealed themselves among the trouu
*ans. near the scene of their outrages
put ur soldiers at a great disadvantage in their
cfT >rts to capture, though the expectation is still
entertained that they will be utiraately taken and
punched for their crimes. The threatening and
disorderly conduct of
THE CHEYENNES
of the Indian Territory, early last summer,
caused considerable alarm and uneasiness.. In
vestigation proved that their threatening attitude
was due in a great measure to the occupation of
j the land of their reservation by immense herds
i of cattle which their owners claimed were right
fully theirs under certain leases made by the In
dians.
Such occupation appearing upon examination
to be unlawful, and notwithstanding their losses
the intruders were requested to remove with
cattle from the lands of the Indians by executive
proclamation. The enforcement of this proc
lamation had the effect of restoring peace and
order among the Indians and they are now quiet
and will behave. By an executive ord t issued
February 27, 1885, by my predecessor, a portion
of the tract of country in the territory known as
tbe
OLD WINNEBAGO AND CROW CREEK RESERVATION,
was directed to be restored to the public domain
and opened to settlement under the government
and law s of the United States and a large number
of persons entered upon those lands.
This action alarmed the Sioux Indians who
claimed the territory as belonging to their reser
vation under the treaty of 1808. This claim was
determined after careful investigation to be well
founded and consequently the executive order
, referred to was by proclamation of April 17,
18S5, declared to l>e in operative and of no effect
j and all persons upon the land were warned to
| leave, This warning has been substantially com
j phled with.
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
had its origin In cessions of land by the stales to
the general government. The first cession was
made by the state or New York, and the largest
w hich in area exceeded all others by the state of
Virginia. The territory, the proprietorship of
which became thus vested kito the general gov
ernment extended from the Western line|of Penn
sylvania, to the Mississippi river. These patri
otic donations of the states were incumbered,
witli no condition except that they should be
held and used for the common benefit of the
United States.
By purchase with tho common fund of all the
people additions were made to this domain until it
extended to the northern line of Mexico, the Pa
cific Ocean and the Polar Sea. The original trust
for the common benefit of tho United States at
tached to all the execution of that trust the policy
of many homes rather than large estates was
adopted by the government. That these might
easily obtained and be the abode of security
and contentment, the laws for the .acquisition
were few and easily understood and general in
their character.
But the pressure of local interest combined
with a speculative spirit have in many instances
procured the passage of laws which marred the
harmony of the general plan, and encumbered
the system with a multitude of general and
special enactments, which rendered the land laws
complicated, subjecting the titles to uncertainty
ami the purchaser often to oppression and
wrong. Laws wdiich were intended .for the
“common benefit” have been perverted, so that
large quantities of land are vesting in single
ownerships. From tho multitude and character
of these laws they seem incapable of correction
by mere administration.
It is not for the common benefit of the United
States that a large area of the public lands should
be acquired directly or through fraud in the bands
of a single individual. The nation's strength is
in tho people, and the nation's prosperity is in
their prosperity. The nation's glory is in the
equality of Imt justice. Tho notion's perpetuity
is in the patriotism of all her people. Hence as
for practicability the plan adopted for the disposal
.f (ho public lands should have in view the origi
nal policy, w hich encouraged many purchasers of
those lands for homes, and discouraged the mass
ing of largo areas, exclusive of Alaska. About
three fifths of the national domain has been sold
or subjected to contract or grant.
< )f the remaining two fifths a considerable por
tion is either mountain or desert. A rapidly in
creasing population creates a growing demand
for homes, ami the accumulation of wealth in
spires an eager competition to obtain the public
land for speculative purposes. In the future this
collision of interests will be more marked than iu
the pasts and the execution of the nation's trust
in behalf of our settlers will be more difficult
I therefore mmend to your attention the re
commendation contained in my report of the
secretary of the interior, with reference to the
repeal and modification of certain of our land
laws.

THE PENSION SI U.IKCT.
It appears from the reporter the Commissioner
of pensions, that there were on the first di\ *•!
Jmy 1 s.V), :ii.\Uss Demons bourn upon the pens*on
rolls, who were classified as follows; Armv In
valMs, 11, ir<; widows, minor children and de

navy invalids. ; navy wid- w-?. minor chihlreii
and dependants I.UJO. Survivo.-s of the war of
181 ; and widows of those who served in the
war, 17,212. About one mania leu of all those
who enlisted in the late war are reported as re
ceiving pensi**ns exclusive of the defendants of
deceased soldiers.
On the first of Juiy, 1875, the number of pen
sioners was 234,821, and the increase within the
ten years number thereafter While there
is no expenditure of tlie* public funds which
the jM'ople more cheerfully approve than that
made on the recognition of the services or our
soldiers, living and dead, the sentiment underly
ing the subject should not be vitiated by the in
troduction >f any fraudulent practices. There
fore it is fully as'iniportant that the rolls should
Ik* cleared of those who by fraud have secured a
place thereon and that meritorious claims should
be speedily examined and adjusted. The reforms
in the methods of doing the business of this
bureau which have lately boon inaugurated prom
ise letier results in bulli the-v* directions.
OPERATIONS OF THE PATENT OFFICE.
The operations of the patent office demon
strates the activity of the inventive genius of
the country. For the year ending .lunw 30. 1885.
the application for patents, including e-issues
anil the registration of trade marks and labels
number 35,688. During the same period there
were 22,928 patents granted and re-issued. and
1,429 trade marks and labels registered The
number of patents Issued during the year 1875
was 11,887. The receipts during the last fiscal
year w ere $1,074,914.35, and the total expenditures,
not including contingent expenses, $934,123.11.
There w ere 9,788 applications for patents, pend
ing on the first day ef July, 18Jv4, and 5,780 on the
same date in the year 1885. There has been con
siderable improvement made in the prompt de
termination of applications and a consequent
relief to expectant inventors, A number ot sug
zest ions and recommendations are contained in
the report of the commissioner of patents, which
arc well entitled to the consideration of congress.
IN THE TERRITORY OF UVAH
the law of the United States passed for the sup
pression of polygamy has been energetically and
faithfully executed during the past year, with
measurably good results. A cumber of convic
tions have been secured for unlawful cohabita
tion, and in some cases pleas of guilty hate been
entered and a slight punishment imposed, upon
promise by the accused that they would not again
offend against the law, nor advice. counsel, aid or
atet in anv way its violation by others.
The Utah commissioners express the opinion,
based upon such information ns they are able to
obtain, that bnt few polygamous marriages have
taken place in the territory during the last year.
They further report that while there cannot be
found upon the registration lists of voters the
name of a man actually guilty of polygamy,
and while none ef that class are holding’ office,
yet at the last election in the territory all the
officers elected, except in one county, were men
who, though not actually living in the practice of
polygamy, subscribe to the doctrine of polyga
mous marriages os a divine revelation and a law
unto all higher and more binding upon the con
science than any human iaw. local or national
Thus is the strange spec*acle presented of a corn
community protected by a ret üblioan form of gov
ernment to which they owe allegiances sustaining
by their suffrages a principle ana a belief which set
at naught that obligation of absolute obedience to
the law of the land, which lies at the foundation
of repiablicann institution*. The strength, the
perpetuaty. and the destiny of the nation rest
upon our homes established by the law of God,
gaurded by parental care, regulated by parental
authority and sanctified by parrolal love.
i hose are not the homes of polygamy, ine
mothers of our land, who rule the nation as they
mou and the characters and guide the actions of
their sons, live according to God’s holy ordinance
and each, secure and happy in the exclusive love
of the father of her children, sheds the warm
light of tru* womanhood, unperverted and un
related, upon ali within her pure and whole
some famuy circle. These are not the cheerless,
crushed and unw manly mothers of polygamy.
Tne fathers of cur families are the best citizens

practise, or the system which sanctions it, which
& not opposed to all that is of value is our trail
tut ions.
There should be no relaxation in the firm but
just execution of the law now in operation, and I
should be glad to approve su.'h further discreet
legislation as will rid the country of this b'oi
upon Its fair fame. Since the people upholding
our territories are re-enforced b*

that a law be passed to prevent the Importation

cient to accomplish this protection I recommend
their amendment to the necessities'f the situation,
and I‘comme td to the consideration of congress
die suggestions contained in the report of the
commissioner of agriculture calculated to in
crease the value and efficiency of this depart
ment. The report of the
CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
which will be submitted contains an account of
the manner in which the civil service law has
been executed during tke last year, and ♦ inch
vai table information on this important subject.
i am inclined to think that there is no senti
ment more general in the minds of the people of
our country than a conviction of correctness of
principle upon which the law enforcing civi* ser
vice reform is based in its present condition.
The law regulates only a part of the subordinate
public positions throughout the country. It ap
plies the test of fitness to applicants for those
places by means of a competitive examination
and gives a large discretion to the commissioners
as to the character of the examination and many'
other matters connected with its execution, thus
the rules and regulations adopted by the com
missioner have much; to do with the practical
usefulness of the statute with the results of its
application.
The people may well trust the commission to
execute the law with perfect fairness and with
,-.g little irritation a- is possible. But of course
no re'axatlon of the principle which undrriies it
and no weakening of the safeguards which sur
round it can be expected. Experience in its ad
ministration w ill probably suggest amendment
..r the methods of its execution, but I venture to
hope that we shall never again be remitted to the
system to which distributes the public position*
purely as rewards for partisan service.
Doubts may well be entertained whetberour
government could survive the strain of a continu
ance f this system which upon every change of
abn nitration, inspires an immense array of
claims for office to lay siege to the patronage of
ihe government, engrossing the time of public
officers wlte their importunities, spreading abroad
the contagion of their disappointment and filling
their air with the tumult of the discontent.
The allurments of an immense number of of
(ices and places exhibited by the voters of the
■ and and the promise of their bestowal in recog
u;tion of partisan activity debauch the suffrage
and rob political action of its thoughtful and de
liberate character. The evil would increase with
he anultiplication of offices consequent upon
ur extension and the mania for office holding
rowing from its indulgence would prevade our
- pulaiion so generally that patriotic purpose
Ihe support of principle, the desire for the public
00.1 and solicitude f*r the nations welfare
would be neailv banished from the activity of our
partv contents and cause them to degenerate into
Unoble, selfish and disgraceful struggles for tne
possession of office and public place.
Civ 1 service teform, enforced by law, came not
100 soon to check the progress of demoralization,
one of its effects, not enough regarded, is the
freedom it bringe lo the political action of those
conservative and sober men who, in fear of the
confusion and risk attending aa arbitrary and
sudden change in all the public offices with a
charge of party rule, cast their ballots against
Hindi a change. Parties seem to be necessary,
and will continue to exist, nor can it be now d
that there are legitimate advantage* not dis
connected with office holding, which follow party
supremacy.
While partisanship continues bitter and pro
nounced bmi supplies so much of a motive to
nt and action, it is not fair to hold public
officials in charge of important trusts, responsi
ble for the best result* in the performance of
tneir duties and yet Insist that they shall rely in

fo in does not exact this nor does it r quire that
those in subordinate positions who fail iu yield
ii g their best service or who are incompetent,

The whining of the clerk discharged for indo

spoils system, suddenly discovers that he is en

benefits without protest, nor are they unmindful

the civil service commissioners bo increased to a
sum more nearly commensurate to their impor

THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY.
It is a source of of considerable and not un
nat ra' discontent that no adequate provision
has yet b*en made for accommodating the prin
cipal library of the government
Of the vast collection of books and pamphlets
gathered at tin* capital, numbering >ome TOOOOO,
exclusive of manuscripts, maps and the prod nets
ot the graphic arts.also of great volume and value,
only h'hvii three hundred thousand volumes, or
less than half the collection, are provided with
shelf Ii the others, whi*h are increasing at
tin* * ate o' fmm 000 to .‘IO,OOO volumes a year,
ore i o only unaccessaMe to the public, but are
su‘-je*t to serious damage .md deterioration from
other causes in their present situation
A consideration of the fact that the library of
the capital has twice been destroyed or damaged
b> lire, its daily'increasing value and its iiuport
auce as a place of deposit of books under the law
relating to copyright, make manifest the neces
sity •<! prompt action to insure its proper accom
modation and protection
My attention has been called tea controversy
which has arisen from the condition of the law
relating to
RAILROAD FACILITIES IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON,
which has involved the commissioners of the dis
trict in much annoyance and trouble. I hope the
difficulty will be promptly' settled by appropriate
legislation.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The commissioners represent that enough of
the revenues of the District are now on deposit
in the treasury of the United States to repay
the sum advanced by the government for sewer
improvements, under the act of June 30, 1881.
They desire now an advance of the share which
ultimately should be borne by the District of the
cost of extensive improvements to the streets of
the city. The total expense of these couteni
plated improvements is estimated atone million
dollars, and they are of the opinion that a consid
erable sum could be saved if they had all the
money in ham!, so that contracts for the .vholo
work could be made at the same time.
They express confidence that if the advance
asked for should be made, the government would
be reimbursed for the same within a reasonable
time. I have no doubt that their improvements
could be made much cheaper if undertaken to
gether, and prosecuted according to a general
plan. The license law now in force within the
District is deficient and uncertain in some of its
provisions, and ought to lie amended. The corn
missioners urge with go**d reason the necessity of
providing a building for the use of the district
government, which shall belter secure safety and
preservation of its valuable books and records.
The present condition of tile law in relation to
the succession to the presidency in the event of
tile death, disability or removal of both the pres
ident and vice-president is such as to require
immediate amendment. This subject his re
peatedly been considered by congress, hut no
result has been reached. The recent lamentable
death of the vice-president, and the vacancies at
tlie same time in all other offices the incumbents
of which might immediately exercise the func
tions of the presidential office, has caused public
anxiety and a just demand that a recurrence of
such a condition of affairs should not be permit
ted.
is coscursios
I commend to the wise ard thoughtful atten
tion of congress the needs, the welfare and the
co operation ot an intelligent and generous
nation. To subordinate these to the narrow ad
vantages of partisanship er the accomplishment
of selfish aims, is to violate the people's trust
and betray the people’s interests. But an indi
vidual sense of responsibility on the part of each
of us and a stern determination to perform our
duty well must give us place among those who
have added in their day and geneiatioc to the
glory and prosperity of our beloved land.

Boston, Dec. 7. —The colored league
of Massachusetts held a public meet

Ruffine presiding. Resolutions were
adopted callin' upon the colored vot
ers of the country to act for themselves
in the future, independent of political

Senate.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The senate
was called to order at 12 o'clock, and
after prayer, Mr. Edwards nominated
Senator Sherman for president of the
senate and Mr. Voorhees moved to
substitute the name of Mr. Harris. The
ayes and nays were then ordered upon
Voorhees motion, and the amendment
was lost by a strict party vote. Where
upon Sherman was elected without fur
ther division's. Committees were ap
pointed to notify the president and the
house of representitives of the organi
zation of the senate. Then, on motion
of Edmunds, at 2:25, the senate took a
recess of half an hour to await the or
ganization of the house.
Upon request of Secy. McCook, Sher
man was escorted to the chair by Ed
munds and Voorhees and the oath was
admicisteied bv Edmunds. Sherman
then said:
I return you my grateful thanks for the high
honor wnich you have conferred on toe. In com
mon with all the people of the United States I
feel profound sorrow for the sudden death of the
vice president who is also by the constitution de
clared president of the senate. The contingency
has now arrived when it becomes the imperative
duty of the senate to elect a president pro tem.
In accepting the position assigned me. I feel
that many senators on either side of the house
are more apt in the discharge of the duties ef
this position, and more experienced in the rules
and orders of the senate than myself. Still I ac
cept with sincere thanks, and 1 hops to be able to
enforce the rules with kindnes- and impartiality
so as to ascertain if possible the sense of the
majority of the senate, and give to the minority
its full constitutional right and protection, and
with a sincere desire to so perform this duty I
appeal to each individual for courtesy and for
bearances.
Cullom then presented the credentials
of Djgan’s re-ehetion as senator from
Illinois, and Pike nresented the creden
tials of Blair of New Hampshire. The
credentials were read and Logan and
Blair were at wnc? sworn in by the pres

by Sen. Voorlms.
Resolved, That the senate has received with
profound sorrow the intelligence of the death of
Thomas 4. Hendricks the late vice-president of
the United States, and for a number of years a

Resolved, That the business of the senate be
suspended in order that the eminent public ser

Resolved, That the secretary of the senate be

Sen. Voorhees as ed that the resolu

Sen. Harrison then moved an immed

HOUSE.
Washington, LLc. 7 The heme
chamber presented a pleasant .cane,
a bright red carpet lending an air of
cheerlulness and warmth to the hall,
which had been thoroughly renovated
since last spring, while a number of
dtsks, including the speaker's, were
decorated with flowers. Here and there
were groups of members chatting and
laughing, political animosities being set
aside for the time being, while the
members took advantage of the occas
ion to extend their acquaintance among
their older and more “xperieaced col
leagues. The chief part of the conversa
tion was the proposed change of rules.
The galleries were crowed with the ex
ception of the executive galh.ry, which
was only partially filhd. The majority
of P'e spectators were ladies.
At noon the house was called to o-d
--er by J. B. Clark, chief clerk, and the
first session of the -fihh congress began.
When order was secured the clerk pro
ceeded to call the roll of the members
elect.
While the roll was being called a
page walked down the aisle bearing in
his arms a huge floral design represent
ing a section of a canal navigated by a
canal boat laden with diminutive bags
of grain, the whole being inscribed,
“Hennepin.” He placed is on the desk
of Murphy, of liwa, the special champ
ion of the Hennepin canal project. The
home broke out into applause and
laughter.
The call disclosed the prrsence of 320
members, the only absentees being Mil
ler of New York, Henderson of North
Carolina, Aiken of South Carolina,
Craig cf T.xir-, and Croixtor of Vir
ginia.
Nominations for speaker were then in
order, and Tucker, of Virginia, present
ed the njms of Carlisle, of Kentucky.
Cannon, of Illinois, then placed Reed,
of Maine, in nomination, and the result
was announced as follows: Carlisle,
177; R*e3, 138; and amid loud applause
the cierk declared Carlisle elected, and
he appointed Tucker and Rec-d as a
committee to conduct the speaker to
the chair.
On taking the chair Mr. Carlisle said:
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives
—ln assuming the duties and responsibilities of
this place for the second time I beg leave to ex
press my most profound thanks for this mani
festation of your continued confidence. It is a
compliment which I shall always look upon w ith
pride and gratitude. No where else in the world
can there be found a legislative assemblv with so
great a constituency as that represented by this
house. Certainly no stir ilar body consisting of
an equal number of members its superior in
point of ability and devotion to the interests en
trusted to it.
The privilege of presiding over the delibera
tions of such a body is a very high and honorable
distinction, the highest and most honorable it
can confer upon its members, and I appreciate it
as such. But gentlemen my full appreciation of
your action to day can best be shown by a con
scientious and impartial discharge of rnyoffice
duty. Although it may not be wise to make
pledges in advance I venture to promise that to
the fullest extent of my ability the law governing
the proceedings of the house shall be evenly ad
ministered.
We are about to enter upon the work of an im
portant session, more important perhaps, than
any that has preceded it for many years The
political relations heretofore existing between the
two sides of the house and the executive depart
raout of the government have been reversed, and
this of itself imposes new duties and obligations
on both. Under a popular form of government
like ours a political change in the execu
tive branch necessarily, to a greater or less ex
tent. involves altered methods of administration,
inaugural of the new legislature policy and con
sequently the presentation of new questions for
the consideration of the people and their rep
resentatives. It is probable, therefore, that
many subjects not heretofore prominent in our
deliberations will enjoy a larg£ shaie of 3*our
attention during the present congress. It may
reasonably be anticipated also that differ
ences of opinion w.ll exist on many of the
questions resulting in a long, earnest and
perhaps exciting contests on the floor. It may be
that these differences will not always be defined
by recognized party lines. Under these circum
stances proper appreciation of the integrity and
patriotism of each other, a sincere respect for
honest opinions of opponents in deba e and the
cultivation of a spirit of mutual forbearance,
will be necessary to enable the house to conduct
its proceedings with order and deliberation and
avoid the unpleasant incidents which are always,
in my experience at least. mo*t seriously regret
ed by those who participate in them. And now,
gentlemen, before taking oath of office allow
me to renew the exp*eßsion of my sincere ac
knowledgment of the great honor you have
conferred, and the great trust you have conferred
to my hands. I accept both with the proper sense
of obligation they impose, and certainly with
an earnest desire to discharge these obligations
without prejudice to any public interest. (.Loud
and long continued applause.)
The election of house officer* resulted
in the election of those chosen by the
democratic causus. The usual com
mits e was then appointed to join one
from the senate to announce to the
president the organization of the two
branches of congress.
DRAWING FOB SEATS
The house proceeded, on motion of
Mr. Sp.inger, of Illinois, to draw for
seats.
Mr. Mills, of Texas, asked th unani
mous consent thst Mr. Kelley, of Penn
sylvania, the ‘‘father of the house,” be
permitted to choose his seat in advance
but Mr. Bennett, o: North Ciroliaa ob
jected.
Mr. Reed then suggested that Mr
Kelley leave h s hat upon his desk and
assure 1 him his wish would be respect
ed.
The members then retired behind the
circle of desks and awaited eagerly
while a bliad-folded page drew from a
box numbered marbles which corres
ponded to numbers attached to their
names. The first marble drawn was
237 and Mr. Stahlhecker, cf New York,
proved to be the lucky man. He select
ed a seat on the democratic side, a little
to the left of speaker Carlisle and Three
rows from the front. Mr. B-ckesridge,
of Arkansas, was next, and be took
possession of bis old desk. The next
dozen names drawn were those of new
members, and the faces of the elder
members lengthened a* they saw their
chances of securing prominent seats
lessening.
On the democratic side, however,
Warner, of Ohio. McAdoo, of New Jer
sey. Springer and Eden of Illinois, and
Biand, of Missouri, were all able to se
cTJe good positions. Tiie name of Mr.
Mahon*-y, of New York, was called in
time to allow that gentleman to obtain
a front seat, but he contented himself
with a seat far in the rear. Mr. Adams
of New York is located in tbe- main
aisle directly in the rear of Mr. Weaver
the greenback member from lowa
Randall was fortunate enough to ee
cure bis old position, while Mr. Hdman
obtained a commanding place . Penn
sylvania was the luckv state on the re
publican side. Messrs. Negley, Harmer,
Bingham, and Boyne being among the
first called.
Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, chose a seat
in Mr. Kelley's neighborhood in close
proxmity to Messrs. Brown, of Indiana,
Goff, of West Virginia, and Parker of
Nw York. Mr. Payssn. of Illinois,
will present railway legislation from
his old desk, while Reed wdl be obliged
to take pan in the debate from a rear
seat. MV. McKenley, of Ohio, was able
to secure a front seat, but too far to the
side to be desirable. He was however,
more fortunate than his colleague But
terwonh who was relegated to the last
row, where he wa? soon joired by His
cock. of New York. Tucker, of Virginia.
Hewitt, of New York, and Morrison,
were in having their names drawn, but
nevertheless secured rather good seats,
the New York: members taking a posit
ion well to the front on the extreme
right of the speaker. Morrison also
secured a front seat. Tucker preferred
a back seat on the main aisle.
Among the last names called was
that of Kelley, and he took the seat
which his hat and the courtesy of h>s
fellow members had reserved for him.
Long, of Mass,, and Phillips, of N. J.,
were obliged logo far to the left and
finally located in McKinley’s neigh
borhood. Van Eaton, of Miss., was the
first democrat who was obliged to look
for a resting place on the republican
side, where he was soon joined by Gib
son, of West Va., i,and Townshend. of
111., the latter of whom was obliged
last congress also to take a position
among his political enemies. The last
ea e called was that of Ueddes, of
Onio. Holdraan, of Ind., then rose and

Training Servant Girls.
The Congregational!;!.
If a majority of matrons would
qualify themselves and then try to
impart to servants their knowledge of
the various trades that are comprised
in housework, the aggregate advance
would in a short tunc be great A
girl with common sense can learn lo
cook all plain food in two or three
months. It would cenainly pay to
send her to the laundry for a few les
sons.
Half a dozen lessons in ‘second
woik,” followed up by a not too op
pressive supervision, will make a cun
petent housemaid. This tutorage will
indeed consume a considerable amount
of time, but it does not upset the
family as and es ihe recurring aid
dread period of “changing girls.’’
We all know .• f households wher<.
seasons all follow in quick succession,
year after year. The lady thinks she
in unfortunate with hei servants, and
fi ally concludes they are all natural
enemies to the c in fort and best in
terest of their employers. The kind
husband sympathizes in an impatient,
despair in the idea that all servants
are worthless.
Bat the fact that some women have
so much worst luck with girls than
others cm only be logically explaiutd
by the supposition th tthey are worse
mistresses. “But what are we to eat
while Bridget is learning?” inquires a
new little wife, before whom the
problem looms darkly in the domestic
horizon. It is no woise to bear the
blunders of oue who is improving all
the time than lo be experimented upon
by a dr z?n strangers, none of whom
are competent. And who can doubt
that the father and the boys will pre
fer to excuse mistakts smoothed over
by kind and hopeful crds from the
mistress to hear a running fire of
weak complaints, month after month,
from a house mother who does noth
ing to better affairs?

Milwaukee, “ points with pride ” to her
many homes, from the humble dwellings
of the laborers to those beautiful houses of
the more wealthy citizens which glorify the
city by the lake. It is a fine showing
and Milwaukee may well be proud of it,
for in the home, wherever it may be, rather
than in the crowded tenement or the more
luxurious flat, are bred those strong and
simple virtues which are the bulwark of
the republic and the state. Among these
happy homes is that of Mrs. C. W. Brown,
at No. 143 Sixth street. Happiness reigns
there because the daughter of the house
has been snatched from the very jaws of
death by what seemed little less than a
miraculous cure. As the case has excited
great interest among Mrs. Brown's friends
and neighbors we give that lady's account
of the whole matter just as she herself told
it to a visitor. She said;
“ We give the credit to Athlophoros for
having our daughter alive and well. She
had inflammatory rheumatism in such a
serious form that we did not know but that
she would die every minute. But I will
tell you just how it all was, starting at the
beginning. She was first taken with what
seemed to be nothing but an ordinary stiff
nock. 1 treated her with the usnal reme
dies in such cases, thiukingthat the trouble
would soon pass off; but alas, such was not
the case. The disease seemed to spread
very quickly over the whole body, giving
her the most excruciating pains. These
seemed almost beyond her endurance, even
for a short time, and caused her to give
vent to violent screams, every one of which
seemed to pierce my heart.
As soon as the disease took this form I
at once sent for a physician. Upon ex
amination he pronounced the case a very
bad form of inflammatory rheumatism. He
made every endeavor to give my daughter
relief, but could not. The disease was
steadily growing worse and she began to
feel it around her heart. As this was the
vital part,and 1 feared thatthechild might
die before we could give her relief, I said:
“ ‘"Doctor, 1 am not satisfied. This child
must have relief at once or she will die.
She cannot stand this torture much longer.’
“ I thought there must surely be some
thing to give her relief, lhad read some
time before this of the cures made by the
use of Athlophoros. On the impulse of the
moment I said to my husband:
“ ‘ I am going to try this Athlophoros.
It will Jo her no harm, even if it does no
good.’
“ I at onco sent after a bottle and began
giving her the medicine. To my utter sur
prise after giving her eight teaspoonfuls
she had relief, and in two days she was up
and around and did not suffer a pain. All
she used was the one bottle.”
“ Do you not think it a wonderful cure?"
“Yes; Athlophoros is the victor. 1
wish I could tell all sufferers from rheu
matism to use Athlophoros. I feel that it
has done so much for me by saving my
child’s life.”
Mr. T. E. Chatfield, the well known con
tractor, of 365 Eleventh avenue, Milwau
kee, was prevented from attending to busi
ness on account of rheumatism, he says:
“After using about two-thirds of a bottle
of Athlophoros my rheumatism went away
as if by some magic power, and in a ft?tv
days I was entirely well and wtnt about
my work.”
If you cannot cot Athlophoros of your drug
gist, re will send it express paid, on receipt of
regular price—one dollar per oottle. We prefer
that you buy it of your druggist, but if ho
hasn't it, do not be persuaded to try something
else, but order at once from us as directed!
