give him better Jesuits than they would
Drown. Hut the, surmise proved wrong.
In the Tenth precinct of (lie Fourth

change In the lead. In the Second ot
the Fifth the court throw out two

Charge Against Peacock
Dismissed Because
Of Error
1IUL OF 01HERS
AKRfcSIED IS POSTPONED
HEADS OF FIRMS BROUGHT INTO
COURT ON WARRANTS IS
SUED AGAINST COR
PORATIONS An error In the manner of making
nut and serving tho warrant against
W. C. Peacock & Co., charging that
firm with selling adulterated liquor re
sulted In tho dismissal of tho chargo
against tho head of I lie firm, V. C.
l'eacoclt, In Police Court this morning.
Attorneys Dreckons and Ashford rep
resented tho defense in tho cascH
against Peacock, Chu Hut llln and
Sing I.oy.
When Clio Hut Hln's case was call
ed Ashford Immediately moved that
the defendant bo discharged from cus.
tody on tho ground thero was no war
rani against mm. Tno warrant on
which ho was arrested was sworn out
against tho Wing Chung Lun Co., and
the attorneys for' the defense claimed
that tho urrtniofone or-the supposed
members of the firm was Illegal.
"There Is no charge against this man,"
said Ashford, and he Is not here by
duu process of law. Wo demand thai
ho bo released.
Andradu opposed tho motion on tho
ground that Clio Hut llln was not yet
charged before the court. Judge Whit
ney continued tho case until tomor-
ow.
In tho coho against W. C. Peacock
the 'same arguments wero advanced.
but with better Biiccess for the de
fense. Dreckons argued that Peacock
was Illegally arrested since tho war
rant was directed against tho corpora
tion ot which Peacock was supposed
to bo thu president. "Thero Is a wny
III which thu corporation may be
brought Into court on such a charge,"
ho aald. "but a single member of tho
firm cannot be tried for au offeuso
committed by the firm."
Andrado did not strongly oppose tho
motion for dismissal In this case, hav
ing apparently come to tho conclusion
that nothing could be gained by trying
the case In Its present form. It Iff
probable that new warrants, not open
to the same objections, will be Issued.
Harry Juen and Joo Clark did not
have tho same excuse, of being only
co-partners In a firm, and will prol
ably have to stand trial. Doth asked
ror a continuance in oruer 10 ouiain
counsel, and their cases wero contin
ued. Clark's case was set for Decern-j
Ler 18 and Juen's for the 12th.
Sing Loy, charged with thu samo of
fense, was also represented by Dreck
ons and Ashford, who entered a plea
of not guilty and demanded Immediate
trial. Andrado objected 011 tho ground
that the prosecution was not ready,
anil Judge Whitney set the case for
December 11.
