THE POSTAL SERVICE.
, Extract From the Annunl Report of l'ost
intiHter General Wilson.
! WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. —A vigorous pro
test against the abuse of the postal scrvioo
I is made in the annual report of Postmas-
I ter General Wilson, which has just been
made public. He quotes figures which
j show an excess of expenditures over re
i ceipts of $8,127,088 for the last fiscal year,
, which, however, is a decrease in deficiency
| as compared with the previous fiscal year,
I of 111,679,956.
This satisfactory exhibit for the last
j year has been made possible, the postmas-
I ter general says, by a vigorous policy of
I bringing suit or pushing collection on
bonds immediately after default, which is
the only safe practice for the interests of
the government and those of tlie obligors.
The postmaster general says ho thinks
j congress may properly grant relief in cases
of hardship and injustice following oollec
l tion, after the lapse of years, by a general
bill or otherwise.
i The report says: "There is no necessity
, for this annual deficit. It has its chief
source in the transmission at second class
! rates of a large and rapidly increasing vol
i nine of matter never In the contemplation
J of the law which gave the nominal rate of
I 1 cent a pound on such mat vr."
The average cost of receding, transport -
| ing and delivering each pound of mail
; matter of all classes was about 10 cents.
I Matter of tlie third and fourth class
' probably paid for Its handling, with posrl
j bly a slight profit on fourth class matter,
j At the average postage revenue of 93 cents
| a pound, gre it profit accrues to the gov
ernment on first class matter,
i The proposed 1 cent lettor rate, the
cheapest postage in the world, Mr. Wilson
I says, would yield a great profit, but it is
' idle to talk of such reduction while two
| thirds of our mail matter is handled at a
i small frartk • of its cost.
! lie chare ... l'l/.es the loss sustained ' *
j the franking privilege in transmittii
i serial libraries, etc., as indefensible.
! The estin OH for the current fiscal year
j and the year 1898 follows: Estimated r
I enuo for 18'7, $89,099,145.07; expendl
I turos, estimated, for 1897, $99,571,504.21:.
deficiency for 1897, $8,472,419.15; osti-
I mated reve-"o for 1898, $90.227,070.0 l ;
expenditures estimated, for 1898, $97,515,-
! Ill.lo; deficiency for 1898, estimated, sl,-
| 288,384.47.
I Discussing the merits of the postal sys
| iom, the postmaster general says the pc
j pie of the United States may foliciteV
| themselves that in no important respect
are they IIOIIMUI any other country in their
' postal faciliti s, and in many things they
! are in the van.

J IS ANNUAL MESSAGE |
THE PRESIDENT SENDS HIS FAREWELL !
EPISTLE TO CONGRESS.
The Cuban Rebellion the Principal Topic
DiHcutsed—Time Not Yet Kipe, 110 Say*, |
For Our Intervention—Spain Warned j
Tliat Hostilities Must Soon Cease.
WASHINGTON, Due. 7. Tlio United j
States began the second session of the Fif- j
ty-fourth congress with crowded galleries i
and with that aecompnniment of activity
and of greeting that usually attends the
reassembling of congress. But the tipper
brunch of congress never puts aside its
dignity, and the meeting developed no
demonstration or dramatic incidents. The
reading of the president's message was the i
feature of the proceedings, and beyond
tliis. no attempt was made to enter .upon
the business of the session. To many of
the foreign representatives occupying the
diplomatic gallery the message had special i
interest and significance owing to the part
they had taken in the conspicuous foreign
events to which thz president referred.
While the scenes attending the opening
of t lie house were both brilliant and inter
esting in the crowds thut thronged the
galleries and the conspicuous personages
present, the proceedings themselves were !
dull and spiritless, being distinctively
routine.
The house met, tlio chaplain invoked t he
divine blessing on the work of the session,
tlio roll was called, a committee consisting
of Mr. Gannon of Illinois, Mr. Payne of
New York.and Mr. Turner of Goorgla was
appointed to wait on the president, and
the hitter's annual communication was
read. The reading consumed about two
hours. It was Mr. Cleveland's farewell
message, and there was much curiosity as
to his views on Cuba especially, but there
was no demonstration, either of approval
or dissent throughout its reading. The
holiday nature of the opening season was
saddened by the announcement of the
death of ex-Speaker Crisp, which Mr. Tur
nor of Georgia formally made to his asso
ciates. Out of respect to the memory of
the distinguished Georgian, the house,
after adopting appropriate resolutions, im
mediately adjourned.
The Pre*i<lent'a Message.
The most vital topic in the president's
message and the one of most general inter
est is the Cuban question. The situation
in Cuba and our relations with Spain are
reviewed at length, but the president docs
not think the time has yet arrived for in
tervention on the part of this country or
the recognition of tlio insurgents as bel
ligerents. He says:
"Jt is difficult to perceive that any
progress lias thus far been made toward
the pacification of the island or that the
situation of affairs as depicted in my last
annual message has in the least improved.
If Spain still holds Havana and the sea
ports and all tlio considerable towns, tlio
insurgents still roam at will over at least
two-tlilrds of the inland country. If the
determination of Spain to put down the
insurrection seems but to strengt hen with
tin l ? lapse of time and is evinced by her
unhesitating devotion of luroely increased
military and naval forces to tlio task, there
is much reason to believe that the insur
gents have gained in point of numbers and
character and resources and are none the
less inflexible in their resolvo not to sue
cunib without practically securing the
great objocts for which they took up arms.
If Spain has not yet re-established her au
thority, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to lie regarded as an
independent state. Indeed, as the contest
lias gone on, the pretense that civil gov
ernment exists on t he island, except so far
as Spain is able to maintain it, has been
practically abandoned. Spain does keep
on foot such a government, more or less
imperfectly, in the large towns and their
immediate suburbs."
Favors Autonomy For Cuba.
After referring to the political grievances |
of the Cubans the president says:
"It is in the assumed temper and dispo
sition of the Spanish government to reme
dy those grievances, fortified by indications
of iniluentla' public opinion in Spain, that
tliis government has hoped to discover the
most promising and effective means of
composing the present strife with honor
and advantage to Spain and witli the
1 achievement of all the reasonable objocts
. of the insurrection. It would seem that
if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine
autonomy—a measure of homo rule which,
while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements of 1
! her Spanish subjects—there should bo no 1
I just reason why tin* pacification of th*
i island might not ho effected on that basis. :
"Such a result would appear to bo in the '
true interest of all concerned. It would |
at onto stop the conflict which is now con- I
sinning the resource.- of the island and j
making it worthless for whichever party
may ultimately prevail."
Referring to the efforts of the adminis
i tration to bring about a cessation of hos
tilities, the president says:
* "It was intimated by this government
to tiie government of Spain some months
ago that, if a satisfactory measure of home |
rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents
and would be accepted by them upon a
s guarantee of its excution, tlio United
s States would endeavor to find away not
f objectionable to Spain of 'furnishing such
> guarantee. While no definite response to
1 this intimation lias yet been received from
the Spanish government, it is believed to
i lie not altogether unwelcome, while, as al
f ready suggested, no reason is perceived
l why it should not ho approved by the in
-1 j snrgents.
8 j "Neither party can fail to see the impor
-1 tail*'*! of early action, and both must realize i
t hat to prolong the present state of tilings !
for even a short period will add enormous- !
ly to the time and labor and expenditure
neceessary t • bring about tlio industrial
recuperation of the island,
y "It is therefore fervently hoped on ull
~ grounds that earnest efforts for healing
■ the breach between Spain and the insur
r ( gent Cubans upon the lines above indi
- j eated may lie at once inaugurated and j
' pushed to un immediate and successful j
issue.
Our Friendly Offer*.
"The friendly offices of the United
States, cither in the manner above out- |
0 lined or in any other way consistent with
( our constitution and laws, will always be
' at the dispos dof either party.
p " Whatever circumstances may arise, our :
policy and our interests would constrain
; us to objoet to the acquisition of the island j
or an interference with its .control by any
other power,
j "It should lie added that it cannot lie
reasonably assumed that the hitherto ex- j
pcctant attitude of the United States will j
bo indefinitely maintained.
"While wo are anxious to accord all duo
respect to the sovereignty of Spain we
\ cannot view the pending conflict in all its
features and properly apprehend our in
i evitubly close relation to it and its possi
'• ble results, without considering that by
the course of events wo may be drawn Into
! such mi unusual and unprecedented condl
! tion as will fix a limit to our patient wait
j ing for Spain to end the contest, either
alone and in her own way or with our
j friendly co-operation.
"When the inability of Spain to deal
i successfully with tlie insurrection has be
come manifest, and it is demonstrated
I that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for
all purposes of its rightful existence, and
! .when a hopeless struggle for its re-cstab
lishiuont has degenerated into a strife
which means nothing more than the uso
i less sacrifice of human lift; and the utter
destruction of the very subject matter of
the conflict, a situation will be presented
; in which our obligations to the soveroign
j ty of Spain will bo superseded by higher
I obligations, which we can hardly hesitate
! to recognize and discharge.
Defend ng the choice of ways and mcth
, ods until the time for action arrives, wo
should make them depend upon the pre
cise conditions then existing, and they
should not ho determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
! involving our honor and interest or the
international duty we owe to Spain,
j "Until we face the contingencies sug-
I gested. or the situation is by other Inci
dents imperatively changed, we should
| continue in the line of conduct heretofore
pursued, thus in all circumstances oxhib
i iting our obedience to the requirements of
public law and our regard for the duty
| enjoined upon us by the position we oeeu-
I py in the family of nations,
i "A contemplation of emergencies that
may arise should plainly lead us to avoid
their croation either through a cureless
disregard of present duty or even an un
due stimulation and ill timed expression
of feeling.
Time May Come For Intervention.
"But I liavo dccmo.l it not amiss to re
mind the congress that a time may arrive
when a correct policy and care for our in
terests as well as a regard for the interests
of other nations and their citizens, joined
by considerations of humanity and a de
sire to see a rich and' fertile country inti-
I mutely related to us saved from complete
j devastation, will constrain our govern
ment to such action as will subserve the
interests thus involved and at the same
tiino promise to Cuba and its inhabitants
j an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of
The message deals with the atrocities in
Turkey in no delicate way. The president
expresses his own indignation and that of
the people at tiie wholesale massacres of
Armenian Christians, but points out that
no American citizen has boon harmed and
states that claims have been made to the
Turkish government for damage to mis
sionary property. Nothing will be omitted,
ho says, to bring about the settlement of
these claims.
The Venezuelan boundary dispute is dis
missed brieliy as a matter now practically
settled, wliilo it is stated that negotiations
between this country and Great Britain
for a treaty of general arbitration promise
to be successful.
Financial conditions are reviewed at
some 1 ngth, though the recent campaign
is rob rrotl to in the onening of tho mes
sage briefly as "a political contest involv
ing momentous consequences and creating
aggressiveness so intense as to approach
bitterness and passion." There is a note
of congratulation for the poaceful solution
of tho contest.
Tariff matters are dealt with In a review
of the workings of the present law, which
i the president pronounces good as far as it
i goes. He points out that tho present law,
I if given an opportunity, will yield a fair
| revenue and thinks that the payment of
deficiencies of revenue from the surplus
J treasury fund is perfectly legitimate.
The president is convinced that "we can
have no assured financial peace and safety
until the government currency obligations
upon which gold may be demanded from
the treasury are withdrawn from circula
tion and canceled." National banks
should redeem their own notes, he says,
and the government should abandon the
i banking business and confine its financial
j operations to revenue and expenditures.
Proceedings of Congress.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1). —Tho notice of the
opening of a Cuban discussion was about
the only feature of interest developed at
the brief session of the senate, which last
ed only 2.5 minutes. Senator Cullom gave
notice of a speech on Cuba tomorrow.
The senators had expected to start tho
wheels of actual business, but tho appear
ance of a house resolution relative to the
death of ox-Speaker Crisp led to tho ous
j ternary adjournment as a mark of rospoet.
I A large number of bureau reports were
"ocoived, including that of tho government
.tractors of the Pacific railway.
I Senator Mills has prepared the following
resolution for introduction in tho senate:
j "Joint resolution directing the presi
! dent of the United States to take military
i possession of tho island of Cuba and hold
I it until its inhabitants can institute such
I government as they may wish and organ
; ize and arm such forces as may lie neces
sary to protect them against invasion.
! "Resolved, by the senate and house of
i representatives of tho United States of
i America, in congress assembled, that the
president of tho United States is hereby
directed to take possession of tho island of
! Cuba with the military and naval forces
J of tiie United States and hold the same
; until the people of Cuba can organize a
' government deriving Its powers from tho
I consent of tho governod and arm and
i equip such military and naval forces as
I may ho necessary to secure them against
j foreign invasion."
The house, without wasting time, pro
irecded to business and before tho session
| closed had passed three bills of consldora
| bio importance and tho first of tho regular
j supply bills—that for pensions.
Three of the bills related to postal mat
ters. One provided for tho use of private
mailing cards of the same general size and
j character as t he present postal cards when
I t cent stamps are allixod. Another pro
vided for a limited indemnity of $lO for
tho loss of registered mail matter and the
third provided for a private carrier service
' in cities, towns and villages where no free
; delivery exists. It provides that on appli
i cation of 20 persons receiving their mail
> through the same office, the po.stnmstcr
shall appoint such persons as arc willing
. to undertake the collection and delivery of
i mails at a charge not to exceed 1 cent for
each letter and that the charge shall be
paid by the beneficiaries. The j ension bill
was passed without factious opposition,
but Mr. Grow (Rep.)of Pennsylvania took
occasion in the debate to submit some
j views in favor of higher tariff duties boned
upon that portion of tho president's mes
sage relating to the tariff. The bill car
ries $111,2(18,880.

SPANIARDS INSIST THAT ANTONIO
MACEO IS DEAD.
1
According to Spnniili Advices, Ma ceo Died
Heroically Fightlug For Cuba's Freedom.
r
[ Apparently on the Kve of a Great Victory.
Gome/ s Son Also Reported Dead.
HAVANA, DOC. 9. —lt is stated in most
P positive terms by the Spanish authorities
f that Antonio Maceo, the great insurgent
I leader and the heart and soul of the Cuban
cause, has been killed in Havana province
after having effected tho passage of tho
western trochu near Mariel at its northern
extremity. With tho Cuban leader died
the youth, Francisco Gomez, son of Maxi
mo Gomez, who uccompanicd tho mulatto
general on his passage of tho troeha.
Most explicit details of the finding of
the corpses of the fallen Cubans and of the
facts relied upon for their identification
are at hand through the report of the
Spanish commander, Major Cirujeda, who
contested the passage of the trochu unsuc
cessfully on Dec. 4 (last Friday) with
GENERAL ANTONIO MACEO.
Maceo and who sustained another oonfiict
on Monday with tho forces under the in
i surgent leader. It was in a reconnoissmico
; after the latter engagement that the Span
- iards found the two corpses, not separated
in dentil, which they have identified as
those of Antonio Maceo and Francisco
i Gomez.
. The authorities now permit tho publica
tion of Major Cirujeda's official report,
that the engagement with Maceo on Dec.
4, when lie forced the trochu, was "a fear
ful combat," which is the first official ad
mission that Maceo brought with him
across tho. troeha a considerable and well
equipped following and fought a hot en
gagement to effect his passage.
After the Cubans bad passed into Ha
vana province tho Spanish commander
effected a fresh concentration in that prov
ince and awaited the arrival of-Macoo. Ho
hud received confidential information of
the proposed movements of the Cubans
and arranged his forces accordingly. He
had in addition received a detailed de
scription of tho horse which Maceo was to
ride as well as of its cajiarisons.
Tho expected I sit tie occurred Monday,
but no details of the engagement are given
out for publication hero.
After the fight tho Spanish troops made
a roconnoissance of the ground previously
held by the Cuban forces. Hero were
found the two corpses lying together, and
indeed almost locked in an embrace in
death. The one body was thut of a mulat
to, a stout man, with gray, crisply curl
ing hair and tho other that of a slender,
dark haired youth.
Maceo'a Identification.
Both wore dressed in white linen duck
suits. When the linen suit was removed
from the corpse of tho elder of the two, he
was found to have on a fine undershirt
I with tho initials "A. M." upon It. The
pair of black silk socks on this body con
tained the same Initials, worked in rod
silk. There was a gold ring on the finger
' containing on tho inner rim the engraved
inscription "Antonio y Maria.". A re
volver with an ivory handle and marked,
together with a small gold mounted tele
scope, wore also found on tho body.
The head of tho young man's body was
resting upon tho body of the first. There
was found on it a silver watch, an ammu
nition bag, several handkerchiefs bearing
tlie initials "F. G., M a traveling valise, a
portfolio containing a number of papers
and a small book, which had apparently
boon bought in New York, judging from
the marks on it.
\ Among tiie papers was one containing
a daily record of the fights in which the
force of the insurgents had boon engaged,
' beginning with Nov. 24 and closing with
I an entry for Dec. 7. According to this
i record, Maceo's forces had made a prelimi
nary exploration of the line of tho troeha
on Dec. 2. The passage of tho troeha is
recorded under date of Doc. 4. On Dec. 5
p they encountered Lieutenant Vasquoz with
r his forces. On 800. 0 again thoy mot Colo
i nel Acosta and Colonel Sartorius and on
Dec. 7 General Sanchez. Horo tho record
f ends.
' On the body was found, it is said, a per
> sonal letter signed "M. Gomez."
Heroic Young Gomez.
. It is stated, in addition to tho above
? particulars, that there was found on the
, body of the younger man a letter written
L in pencil saying that he dies rather than
abandon the eorpso of his general, Maceo.
Such are the details of the identification
upon which the Spnnish officials rely for
their firmly expressed conviction that An
tonio Maceo has mot his end. No news
that lias been received since tho outbreak
of the insurrection lias caused so great a
sensation in Havana or has been deemed
so encouraging to the Spanish cause. Since
the famous raid of the Cubans across the
whole of the island last year, when Maceo
invaded Pinar del Rio, while Gomez re
turned to the eastern provinces, tho mulat
to general has hold his own in the wostern
province against tho utmost efforts of the
Spaniards to dislodge him. He transferred
the whole seat, of war from tho east to the
west, and while his enemies claimed ho hod
run into a trap and built a strong troeha
across the island to keep him there, ho
continued his indefatigable campaign and
J confidently claimed always that he could
cross tlie troeha when he wished and effect
; | a junction with Gomez again in the cast.
