Solicitor Lof tin Should
Be Invited to Help.
It would seem proper. In view of the
developments before the board of
county commissioners last Wednesday
Vmotnitig, that County Solicitor Lof tin
' fee Invited to help Investigate the sher
iffs office and the acts of the sheriff
and his deputies during: the past few
months. If the revelations are" the re
sult of onlj a casual examination of
jthe sheriff's accounts, as stated by
i County Auditor llacgibbon, then the
j county solicitor may exercise these
j powers conferred upon him by the
?tate and make a thorough cxamina
jtion of al! matters relating to the of
'fioe. . ,
, The solicitor has the power of a
! grand Jury. He can have witnesses
! summoned and examine them under
joath. He can cause the production of
records and papers and he can force
'the attendance of officers as -well as
citizens to give testimony if he sus
pects there have been any irregulari
ties. The county auditor says the sher
iff has charged mileage for many miles
.never traveled and that he has sub
mitted bills for the taxpayers of Es
:' cambia c.ounty to pay where service
was never rendered.
Charges of grave character have
been made and the county auditor says
he stands ready to prove them. The
proposed inquiry by ,the county com
missioners will be beneficial in clari
fying the situation. The audit of the
'sheriff's books and accounts by a state
auditor wilLl If the governor sees lit
,' to "send one here, further satisfy pub
lic curiosity as to the facts. But what
Is really needed, in justice to both -the
eherlff and the(taxpayers, is a thorough
jod rigid Investigation by the county
solicitor. 1 '
The Journal suggests that, at this
coming meeting, the county commis
sioners invito Solicitor Loftln to be
present and assist them in the in
vestigation. He Is familiar with the
criminal costs system and with much
t the work connected with the sher
iffs office, and he can be of gTeat as
sistance in securing all of the facts.

Disgusting and Cowardly
Speech By a Man.
The woman suffrage campaign in the
United States is conducted on a high
plane and by able and dignified i lead
ers. Whatever may be said of the
suffrage methods in England no one
can charge that the suffrage leaders
in, this country have done anything
that would in any way bring reproach
upon the name of American woman
hood. It has remained for one of the man
opponents of the equal suffrage cause
to make a small, cowardly and alto
gether unmanly attack upon the good

women who are fighting for the bal
lot. Last week a delegation of women
appeared before the committee on
rules in the bouse of representatives
to ask tliat an equal suffrage commit
tee be appointed in the house. An op
position delegation aJso appeared and
one of the spokesmen was a man from
New York, who referred to Dr. Anna
iJhaW president of the national wom
an's suffrage organization, in these un
manly terms:
When I saw this person here ycater
dav shake her clinched fist and de
clare, "W demand our risrhts," I said
to niyeelf. "Clinched fists mean fight."
The manhood of this nation has been
trained to respect and revere woman
hood and I claim that for American
womanhood today, but if we are chal
lenged to flsht this movement there
will be blows to give as well as blows
to take.
What decent man would be guilty of
such talk as that? Who but a coward
would talk about "giving blows" in a
contest where any woman good or
bad is an opponent?.
It may be that "this person." Dr. An
na Howard, is leading a cause that
does not find favor with all men or all
women, but in addition to being a
woman she Is one of the bralnest,
most conscientious, and devotedly
Christian characters whom the Am
erican platform has ever known.
Such cowardly and disgusting ex
hibitions as the New York man .maue
of himself should earn for him the
contempt of all decent men.
FLORIDA'S CAMPAIGN FOR
UNITED STATES SENATOR
Many Papers For Stockton
Kx-governor Albert W. Gilchrist,
who anonunced his candidacy for the
United States senate, to succeed Sen
ator Fletcher, eeveral weeks ago, has
withdrawn from the race. John N. O
Stockton is now the pnly candidate
aea'r.'t Senator Vletc- an " e r o
promises to be intereating. Many state
papers have announced for Stock :on
and a prreat many are yet to be heard
from. Like City Inclex.
Excellent Generalship'
The T npa Tribune of this morn
ing contains the announcement of Ex
Governor Gilchrist's withdrawal from
the senatorial race. The general has
shown excellent generalship and rare
good sense. Bartow Courier Inform
ant.
Congratulations to Fletcher
Senator Fletcher is . be congrat
ulated that his Mntiring efforts on
behalf of the establishment of the
rural credit system which will result
in moro substantial benefit to a larger
number of the people of this country
than' any measure now on the demo
cratic legislative program,' received the
full and cordial endorsement of the
president in his message to congress
on Tuesday. With Senator Fletcher
pushing the bill which he has already
introduced in the senate and the pow
erful proarressvie support it will un
doubtedly receive in the house, and
with the endorsement and assistance
of the president, the rural credit sys
tem seems to be In a fair way to be
come an accomplished fact before the
end of the present session of congress.
Bartow Courier Informant.
Plenty Time and Money
Hon. Albert Gilchrist has retired
from the race for the U. S. senator al
most before he started. He gives as
his reason that his other busines will
take all of his time and that he would
have no time to devote to the- sen
atorial business. Albert need not worry
about the time of a senator. They us
ually have plenty af time and money,
and what more could a man wish for?
Sanford Herald.
Boosts Charles Parkhill
The Tampa Times, referring to the
withdrawal of Ex-Governor Gilchrist
from the senatorial race, says: "We
are deeply., and vitally interested lo
cally in this matter. Tampa has in
terests that will be directly and per
haps prejudicially affected by the con
tinuance of the monopoly of both seats
by a rival city; South Florida and
the rest of the state outside of the
northeast corner are ready to revolt
against the Jacksonville grab and
greed. Now Is the time for some South
Floridian with grit, vim and stead
fastness to shy his hat into the ring."
Without any disparagement to the
other candidates, if South Florida must
have a candidate for United States
senator, the very strongest man that
section could possibly put forward for
the position is Hon. Chas. B. Parkhill.
He is the peer of any man In the
country, both in point of mental abil
ity and oratory. He is especially pro
ulsr in Wt Florida, where he for
merly resided until resigning" as a
rnemoer of the supreme court and re
moving1 to Tampa, and If South Flor
ida gave him the support which the
Times indicates a South Florida man
would receive, Charlie Parkhill would
be hard to beat. Gainesville Sun.
Sorry He Has Withdrawn
The Star is sorry that ex-Governor
Gilchrist his withdrawn from the sen
atorial race. Some man may be shoved
in to take votes away from Fletcher
or Stockton who in the case of his
election would not make as good a
senator as Mr. Gilchrist. Ocala, Star.
How Traveling Men Think

it hns ever occurred to our contempo
raries that the traveling men Don't
Uphold Fletcher. Zolfo Springs Truth.
t Fletcher's Prominen
Alore than any other, public man
in this country is Senator Fletcher
of this state identified with the pro
posed financial legislation in behalf
of rural credits which win make it
vossible for farmers to sret loner time
loans at low interest. Senator Fletcher
studied this system in Europe and
is now its chief advocate In this coun
try. Yesterday President Wilson in
his message to congress definitely en
dorsed this system and it goes without
saying that our senior senator Is feel
ing mighty good to get such strong
backing" for his measure. Lakeland

Very Sensibly
Ex-Governor Albert W. Gilchrist has
very sensibly announced his withdraw

Congratulate Gilchrist
We congratulate the "Gentleman
from DeSoto.for withdrawing from
the senatorial race, for he undoubtedly
showed more wisdom in withdrawing
than he Ud in entering the game.

Miss Delphine Moore.
Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 12. Two
thousand one hundred and sixty-seven
Arkansas boys must banar their heads
in shame they were beaten in the
annual competition for Boys' Corn club
prizes by a girl, Delphine Moore of
Washington county.
Only two boys were able to show
a better record, on the form required
by the United States department of
agriculture, than little Miss Moore,
she taking third -prize for work in
Arkansas.
Many of the boys are riled over the
record of Miss Moore and want to
know how she "got into a boys' club,
anyhow." This expression shows the
bitterness of their draught, for when
Miss Moore entered the contest in
Washington county it was considered
somewhat as. a joke. Miss Moore raised
101 bushels of .corn on an acre, at a
cost of i2 cents per bushel, and mace
up for the lack of high-priced ferti
lizers by hard work on the Foil.
More than two boys secured a higher
yield from an acre than did MLss.
Moore, but it was either at a greater
cost per bushel, or there was a laxness
In keeping the record re""red by the
government, so the general all around
work of this energetic farm girl, won
for h&r the third prize, $50, over so
mtny competitors.
Before entering the Boys' Corn Club
contest. Miss Moore made a bargain
with her brother, also a contestant,
that if ha would plow the land as
she directed, she would hoe and weed
his acre of corn. The brother agreed
and on the last day of ApriL she se
lected the kind of a plow she wanted
used and stood by to see that tae
ground was turned to a depth of
twelve inches. The ground was then
thoroughly harrowed and the first oa
of May the corn was planted in rows
tree feel and a half apart.
Miss Moore followed another idea
of her own in the plowing of the corn.
Four weeks after planting she had
her brother plow the corn to a depth
of six inches, and the following day
she hao it gone over with th plow
again. On the last day of May the
com A-as thinned and hoed for the
first time
Six weeks after the planting of the
corn it received the third plowing, fol
lowed by another shallow plowing ten
days later. Twice following this last
plowing the corn was harrowed and
the weeds pulled out. No more work
was done on the corn until the crop
was gathered in October.
