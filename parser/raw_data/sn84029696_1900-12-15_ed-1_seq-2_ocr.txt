THE SAHTll.FEmEfflUPHEItS
Their Strike Was Sudden But Had
Been Prepared For.
MEN CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
Wichita, Dec. 11. J. A. Newman, of
this - city, who is general chairman of
the Santa Fe division of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers, including the
entire Santa Fe system, issued an or
der to workers for the Santa Fe to stop
work, invoice their offices and guard
them until some official of the road
should check them out. The .strike
has been brought about by the trouble
between the operators on the Gulf,
Colorado & Santa Fe and the officers of
the road, and the general strike was
ordered in sympathy to the cause of
the Gulf operators.
Mr. Newman, who has been employ
ed in the Santa Fe division office here
for about ten years, says that there are
something like 1,300 telegraph em
ployes on the Santa Fe system and it
will be utterly impossible for the com
pany to fill their places. y We are out
and will stay out until we win all of
the conditions, in which case we will
return. One of the conditions is that
all of the non-union operators must be
dismissed from the service of the San
ta Fe.
Topeka, Dec. 11. When the strike
order was received here the operators
in the general offices and at the depot
quit work with only a very few ex
ceptions. C. G. Sholes, superintendent
of telegraph of the Santa Fe went to
work at the key and so did General
Manager n. U. Mudge, and there were
others found in the departments, suffi
cient to do the most important work.
Mr. Mudge said that he anticipated
no especial trouble in the operation of
trains as most of the trains are run
ning on time table schedule, and that
a great many new men had been se
cured already and more of them are
constantly applying for positions. He
said: "The whole trouble hinged cn
the rules and regulations. The wage
scale was up for consideration, but the
road agreed to arbitrate on that point.
The rules and regulations have been
up and were not settled. The road
would not agree to the rules which
were asked by the men, and the strike
is the result."
The operators in Topeka say they are
sure to win in this case and feel cer
tain that they will interest the other
railway organizations in their behalf.
L. C. Badgely, assistant local chair
man of the telegraphers' order, says
that the fight between the operators
and the Santa Fe is a fight to the fin
ish. They feel that they will win, and
will hold out until the matter is
settled. "There is no doubt but that
we will interest other railway organ
izations in the cause, and are at pres
ent arranging for meetings with
them."
Paul Krnger'8 Faith.
London, Dec. 10. The Daily Mail
publishes the following from its corr
respondent at The Hague: "When I
asked Mr. Kruger whether he would
renew his request to Emperor William
to offer arbitration, he replied: 'Yes,
but my faith remains in the King of
Kings. South Africa will save itself. '"'
Kroger M ill Remain at The Hague.
London, Dec. 10. Mr. Kruger has
abandoned all the proposed journeys
to other capitals, says the Brussels
correspondent of the Standard, and all
further diplomatic efforts to secure
arbitration will await at The Hague the
development of events at the seat of
war.

It is a Question of Which Woman
Told the Truth,
MORGAN'S DEPOSITION REC'D.
El Dorado, Dec 10. When Jessie
j Morrison took the witness stand, she
was weak but she met the crisis with
firmness. As usual the spectators were
mostly women. Witnesses for the de
fense first testified contradicting' a
number of statements made by wit
nesses for the state.
The deposition of J. A. Morgan . was
then introduced. Is a canvassing agent;
was canvassing El Dorado on June 22;
on that morning visited the house of
the deceased, Mrs. Castle; after leaving
heard a knocking on the inside of the
door screen; thought he was being
called back and looked that way; saw
Mrs. Castle was not looking at him but
at a small lady who did not stop until
Mrs. Castle said to her "Jess, come in.
I want to talk to you." Before he was
out of hearing he heard a scream, and
started back, and saw the small lady
brought out of the house. He then
left and the next morning left the
town.
Jessie Morrison then testified. Knew
Olin Castle; he called on me from once
to three times a week; often took me
buggy riding, and took me to parties.
He always furnished the conveyance.
She went to Excelsior Springs to visit
her sister. Never said to Castle "111
fix you." Did not make any threat
when she asked Castle for her letters.
Never wrote Castle an anonymous let
ter; never wrote him that she was in
trouble and for him to remember his
promise. Never wrote him about any
'scheme." Castle gave me a mirror
and he said Clara would make a scene
if he told her about it. She denied
every statement made by Castle in his
testimony. She had never got a razor
at the Racket store and never tried to
do so. Had no razor or knife in her
possession the fatal morning. When she
left Mrs. Davis' with the collar pattern
she started home, had no thought of
stopping at Castle's. Mrs. Castle called
her in. There was a man on the side
walk. Said nothing to Clara about
any letter. Was shown the razor; said
she had never seen it at that time; had
no sharp instrument in her pocket; had
no thought of trouble with Clara when
she went m.
Miss Morrison then related the story
of the fight.
During a quarrel had dropped her
handkerchief and while picking it up
Clara had cut her throat. Then the
fight commenced, during which the
witness had taken the razor away from
Mrs. Castle and while Mrs. Castle was
on top of her, both on the lounge and
OTl the floor. Mrs. Castle received the
slashes from the razor m the hands of
the witness. She saw only one razor.
Mrs. Moberly was the first one to enter,
she asked '-What is the matter;" I re
plied, "she tried to kill me." Mrs.
Spangler came in and asked the same
as Mrs. Moberly and I replied, "Clara
called me in and tried to kill me and I
am afraid I have killed her." "I
6tooped down to take my skirt from
under Clara and to put on one of my
slippers." "Did not try to conceal any
thing in my skirts." I had two hat
pins in iny hand when I was going
home from Castle's, which had dropped;
had nothing else in my hands."
Q. At the time you used the razor
on Mrs. Castle did you believe your life
was in danger? A. I did. There was
nothing said about a letter by either
of us when I went into the house. Did
not ask Mrs. Castle if there was any
one about the house." I did not cut
myself."
In answer to cross examination she
said: Was never engaged to Olin Cas
tle. There was no promise on either
side. Had no intention of going to
the Castle houe when I left home.
When I dropped my handkerchief and
before she cut me I heard her jump
toward the stand but I did not see her.
Mrs. Castle's first conversation com
menced with "You know that I hate
you."
Judge Shinn's charge to the jury
was considered to be, in effect at least,
very lenient and favorable toward
Jessie Morrison.

Sali'bury's tltlmatam.
London, Dec. 8. Premier Lord Salis
bury in replv to bitter criticisms from

"Anything resembling independence

"The war must "proceed to its inevitable
issues. We must let it be felt that no
one, by the issue of an insolent and
audacious ultimatum, can force the
British government to abandon its
richts. Not a single shred of inde
pendence must be left. How soon the j
Transvaalers have safeguarding powers j
depends on themselves. It might be j
years and it might be generations."
