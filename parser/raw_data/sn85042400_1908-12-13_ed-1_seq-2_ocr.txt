IN A CLASS WITH BUTCHERS
Entered a second-class matter July 30, 1506, at the postoffice at Astoria,
Oregon, under the act of Congress of March 3, 1879. ;
Orders for the delivering of The Morning Astorian to either residence
or place of business may be made ty postal card or through telephone.
Any irregularity in delivery should be immediately reported to the office
of publication.' "

AS WE HEAR IT.
The Morning Astorian feels itself
justified, on unimpeachable authority,
this morning in nuking the broad
declaration that neither Mayor-elect
A. M. Smith, nor Police Commission
er W. C Logan, are committed to
an open-town policy. Both gentlemen
have expressed themselves unqual
fiedlv as in favor of police regulation
and holding the city at its present
status on this score. This is good
news to many people who have had
more or less reason to draw other
conclusions in both these grave mat
ten
The source of our information is
of such a character as to leave the
situation at this pass, until one or
both have signified their programs
personally, either through these col
umns or other, agencies at their
hand.
It means much to Astoria to know
this. It is a matter that lies close
to the public conscience, and this
announcement is made in the faith
that sanctions it
disturbing. By arousing public opin
ion to the srrave political dangers
arising from monopolistic and corpo
ration abuses President Roosevelt
did his country an inestimable service
the value of which will be infinitely
more appreciated in the future than
at present The dose he adminis
tered was a bitter one, but the pa
tient needed it. The period for agt
tation, however, is now over; Mr.
Roosevelt has done the work for
which he was best fitted, and the
work of crystalliiing an awakened
public opinion into intelligent and
eouitable legislation regarding corpo
rations must soon be begun. It should
be left to the judicious action of con
gress, aided as far as practicable by
the tactful Mr. Taft, who stands
pledged to the Roosevelt policies of
reform."
CLEWS ON ROOSEVELT.
Commenting upon the present bus
iness situation in the country, Henry
Clews, the veteran banker, pays a
high tribute to the work that has
been done and to the results that
have been achieved by the Roosevelt
administration. Mr. Clews is one of
the financiers of the country whose
opinion is valued highly; his opinions
are formed conservatively and are
not often expressed enthusiastically;
yet this review of the Roosevelt
work is that of an appreciative
critic: " "";
"Congress opens, fortunately, with
much less apprehension than usuaL
President Roosevelt will of course
adhere to his well known policies re
garding corporations, but as this
will be his last message, and as he
has but three more months in office
his utterances are not likely to be
136 YEARS AGO.
It was on December 10, 1672, that
the first postal service was establish
ed between Boston and New York; a
mail was dispatched once a month
and the round-trip of the messenger
was a matter of weeks. As time
eoes. it was not so very long ago
that the first mail carrier started on
this route: Europe was old then and
across the ocean 1672 does not seem
as remote as it does with us. But
measured by the development that
has taken place in this country dur
ing the years that have elapsed since
that postal service was -inaugurated,
it is a long time. Our nation has been
born and has grown to occupy a
place amongst the foremost powers
of the earth. Contrast this first mail
service with our present postal facili
ties and you realize how great our
growth and development have been.
It is the most remarkable m history.
The best feature of the develop
ment of the conservation plan is the
fact that everybody is becoming
eager to help.
