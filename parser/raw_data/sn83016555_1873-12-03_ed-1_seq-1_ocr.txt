Upper City Raiirond.
. Our city has, of late years, been steadily
increasing in width. More particularly is
this noticeable in the Fourth District.
While land, rents, houses and living gener
ally has heen cheaper hack in the swamp
suburbs, a drawback has heen felt in the
way oi ready access to their homes by resi
dents of those localities. To supply this
want, a number of public spirited citizens
have organized the Upper City Railroad
Company. The route of this railway will
he from the corner of Water and St. An
drew streets out St. Andrew to Coliseum,
down Coliseum to Felicity, out Felicity to
Magnolia, up Magnolia to Jackson, out
Jackson to Roman, up Roman to Third
through Third to Water street, and along
Water street to the starting point.
The company has organized by electing
the following ollicers and directors: Presi
dent, William Bogel: vice president, John
M. Wiemann, directors, Captam B. T.
Walshe, Messrs. Thomas Sheehan, James A.
Gresham, Samuel Manning Todd and E. H.
Adams.
We understand that a considerable amount
has already been subscribed to this enter
prise, and in view of the great need ot
transverse tran-portation in the Fourth
District, we doubt not that a successful
issue will be arrived at iu a very short
time.

Bargains 'at Holmes'.—A ll the world
knows that the great dry goods house of D.
II. Holmes never indulges in claptrap nor
catchpenny advertising. Whatever the
heads of that establishment advertise they
mean from the first to the last lin£, in every
sense and particular. Therefore our lady
reader6 can well understand from the tenor
of the advertisement which we publish this
morning, emauating from that concern, that
there are bargains to be had there—that
one of the most varied stocks of goods in
the country has heen so far reduced iH price
that will now buy what it formerly took
? 1 to do. This is not because the goods are
inferior., but because there has been an im
mense shrinkage in values. Therefore we
say to such as really want bargains and no
humbug, go to Holmes' great store.

Science in the !>ouih."
Under this head a fellow citizen con
tributes the following interesting ' paper to
the St. Louis Globe:
May 1 reeuest of you the privilege of cor
recting a iew inaccuracies in tbe report
matie in your paper of my remarks in the
St. Louis Acaileniv of Sciences lest Monday
evening ! In the paragraph, "Science in the
South." auy remarks, a» reported do not
convey the facts as I intended to preseut
tiieui. and as I think they were understood
by the Academy. Dr. Emile Lamm, a citi
zen of Xew Orleans, and a Fellow of the
Xew Orleans Academy of Sciences, while
experimenting with ammonia as a motive
power, somewhat accidently discovered
that water, heated under pressure, retained
its caloric for a length of time much greater
tiiau had heen previously supposed, and
that by proper conditions of insulation this
retention could be utilized so as, lor muuy
purposes, to supersede the us.- of ammonia
cs!- gas as a motor. He had successfully
brought the latter into use as a tre -tor of
street cars by liquifying it under p essure,
and allowing it to expand in passing
through the cylinder of lus engine,
paneled in the proportion of one thousand
volumes ot gas to one of liquified ammonia,
and instantaneously taking advantage of
the affinity ot this gas for water by allow
iug it to be absorbed in a vessel of that
liquid receiving the discharge. This was
an acknowledged success, and achieved his
purpose as a facile motor for street cars.
But, being a chemist, he knew that water
stood at the head of the series of materials,
either fluid or gaseous, for its capacity for
caloric. Upon reflection, it occurred to him
that if he held water as a liquid, by a strong
pressure, while he subjected it to great heat;
it would, upon every lessening ot the pres
sure, Hash into steam, to just the extent
aiiowed by the diminished pressure, a«d,
therelore, with proper insuiation to retard
radiation, he could give to the world a much
more economical motor for all classes of
vehicles, under conditions allowing of a
reasonably frequent resupply, than could
be done by his cherished ammonia discov
ery, or by ary other agency known to
science
The apparatus of this thermo-specific mo
tor now in use consists ot a strong local
boiler capable for sustaining a pressure of
200 pounds to the sauare inch, or something
like this, conveniently located either at an
extremity of a railway of moderate length,
or iu the middle of a longer one, for charg
ing the reservoirs or tanks of the small
trucks that draw the cars. Upon the same
truck there is placed a smalleugine, makiug
the whole something like a miniature loco
motive. hut with this important difference,
that there is no furnace, with its accompa
niments of fire, smoke, etc.
These tanks are partially, generally three
fourths, tilled with water, which is then
charged with steam from the local boiler to
the extent ot about 150 to 175 pounds press
ure to the square inch aud a temperature of
about 360° Fahrenheit. This charging is
done with such facility that iu practice now
it is found that one aud one-halt minutes is
surtioient for its completion, while the
"rraetor," or "dummy," or ••tireless locomo
tive," as it is variously called by the several
companies now using it in our cities, is in
active and constant use. The steam enters
a tube lying along the bottom of the hori
zontal tank, which tube is perforated
tuiuttgkout its length by small iuramira
equal at least iu their aggregate area to
that of the tube. By this arrangement the
steam is diffused iu the quickest possible
time to all parts of the volume
ot water, and almost immediate
ly elevates its temperature to 360°
Fahrenheit. But as not much room has been
allowed lor the conversion of the water
into steam, the great hulk of it remains a
fluid, just as ammonia would be under
similar pressure at the usual temperature
of the external atmosphere. But, haviDg
availed of the capacity of wat:-r for caloric
under these conditions, you have stored up
in itself the agent that will expand it into
steam just rs you, by the action of your
engine, give it permission, i. e., relief from
pressure, to do so. So long as the tempera
ture remains about 212 Fahrenheit, upon
opening ihe throttle valve it will generate
steam with a promptitude aud power corre
sponding with the temperature. This steam,
of course, enters the cylinders and is
worked through the valves precisely as if
it had heen generated in an ordinary tire
locomotive.
The X'cw Orleans tireless dummies ere
comparatively smajl machines hut suffi
cient to draw one or two of the ordinarv
sized passenger cars loaded. They usually
have the local boiler charged to about 125
pounds to the square inch, and return from
a six mile circuit with about sixty pound
pressure, sometimes more. They sometimes
charge up to 175 pounds.
Ammoniacal gas, liquified by pressure,
eau he kept for auy length of time at the
ordinary atmospheric temperatures, in the
apparatus constituting Dr. Lamm's am
monia propeller, as was proved by the long
detention of one of the cars thus equipped,
lasting some six or seven weeks, during an
overflow in Xew Orleans. On opening the
throttle valve the liberated gas instantly
responded, putting the englue and the car
in motion as if no interruption bad oc
curred. Valuable as this discovery is for
louger routes, it can not compare with the
detached steam in regaru to economy and
facility tor street cars, canal barges, aud
any species of vehicles where a great num
ber can be supplied from one boiler. It is.
therefore, successful as it really was, laid
aside and held in abeyance for the present.
Now. Messrs. Editors, you will pardon
me it some laudable pride in the science ot
the South has impelled me to ask this op
portunity to correct the report of my re
marks. As I have no interest in these dis
coveries, but do retaiu my admiration for
my fellow academician, the discoverer, who
so unfortunately met his death by accident
a few months ago. and a« I know you prefer
to be correct in scientific expositions in your
paper, I the more freely submit it to your
consideration.
Injustice to the gentleman reporting my
remarks, I may say that my Scotch accent
probably misled him to understand me as
saying I would "open the boiler" when I
really said, instead of "boiler." f lie "throttle
valve." Very respectfully, JOHX ROY.
Tooched at Key West.
A dispatch to the Xew York Trihunt
from Key West, dated November 28. states
that the steamer Liberty, from Xew Or
leans for Baltimore via Havana, touched
there that day. tearing fo go to Havana
w ithout ascertaining whether war had been
declared or not.
The reported arrest of Professor Caneio
Bello, ex professor of Spanish in Harvard
College,is confirmed by letters from Havana.
Professor Bello went to Havana at the in
vitation of the Spanish authorities in rela
tion to his property, which had been se
questrated, promising to restore it on the
payment of a certain sum. he to relinquish
his claims. He was earnestly requested
not to go to Cuba and imperil his life, as it
was only a Spanish trick to get hold of him
and imprison him. He was arrrsted on the
arrival of the steamer City oi Xew York
in Havana recently, with some sixty others,
some of whom were in the steamer and
others were already in Havana. Professor
Bello is in prison on charge of conspiracy
against the Spanish government, and his
friends entertain fears that false witnesses
will be trumped up against him. and that
the Spainiards may treat him as the did the
Virginias captain.

OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
The Jnckson, for Boys and Girls.
A visit to these schools yesterday was
a pleasant one, and proved to us that
both are in excellent condition. The
buildings are in tolerable repair, and
were constructed for the purpose to which
they are devoted. The furniture is very
fair, and all the surroundings are neat and
comfortable.
In the girls' school are nearly 300 intelli
gent pupils, well dressed, and happy in ap
pearance. In the tiret room, Miss I. Sim
nions, principal, exists an air of comfort
and quiet which speaks well for the teacher.
It is evident that the children are improv
ing rapidly, applying their entire attention
to I heir lessons. Just now they are lull of
active preparation for the coming examina
tion, and have departed from the genera
routine. Miss Simmons has so well per
firmed her arduous tasks that she will have
twentv five pupils competent to enter the
High School. That is sufficient praise itseli
especially when it is considered that these
twenty-five constitute nearly one-half the
number of scholars in the principal's room
These girls are certainly as bright and am
bitious as any that can be found in either
of our public schools.
In the other rooms the advancement is
apparent, aud the teachers are animated
with a proper desire to improve their
classes. All things in and around the
building look compatible and quiet. In
deed, this is one qi the best schools, public
or private, in Xew Orleans.
Dr. Russell, director, makes almost daily
visits, taking a deep interest in the general
welfare.
The following are the teachers: Miss
Simmons, principal; Miss E. Tobin, first as
sistaut; Miss M. Calder, adjunct assistant
Miss O. Carter, second assistant; Misses L,
P. Green and M. Durainde, third assistants.
The boys' building adjoins the girls', but
is entirely distinct, and is tolerably well lo
cated. Each room is quite up to the aver
age standard, for the most of the lads de
sire advancement. The teachers are ear
nest in their work, toiling zealously to ful
till the duties they have assumed. The
children are of the better classes, neatly at
tired and cleanly. Xearly all the boys in
the principal's room are well up in their
books, seeming to understand the necessity
ot close application. At least ten in the
first class will be transferred to the High
School. Parents are informed that their
hoys will do as well or better here as in any
private school, and it is suggested that if
mothers and fathers will occasionally visit
the building, both teachers and pupils will
feel pleased.
The following are the names of the teach
ers:
Mr. G. H. Gordon, principal: Miss J. A
Trott, first assistant; Miss R. T. Murphy,
adjunct assistant: Miss M. L. Dolan, second
assistant: Miss E. B. Brown, third assist
ant; Mrs. S. Mather, third assistant.
The President's Message.
In this morning's Republican we present
the annual message of President Grant to
Congress. It is fully equal to the former
State papers of the President, and every
line of it is worthy the careiul perusal and
mature retlection of our readers. The views
of the President on the condition of our na
tional finances, liis reference to affairs with
Spain, and his vigorous allvision to the out
rages perpetrated upon our commerce by
the unlicensed authorities in Cuba, call for
special attention.
The various recommendations in behalf of
the departments are of an interesting char
acter, while the collected information the
message contams is most valuable, as show
ing the progress our country has made and
is making.
AMUSEMENTS.
Academy of Music.
Two mort performances of the popular
drama of "Bertha, the Sewing Machine
Girl," will be given at the Academy. One
to-day noon, lor the matinee extra, and one
for the regular evening entertainment. Our
lady readers are thoroughly informed of
the attractions offered them for the mat
inee. In addition to the play, the change
of obtaining a hundred dollar sewing ma
chine for fifty cents will cause the theatre
to lie filled. Even should the actors fail,
the prize will draw. Each fifty cent ticket
sold at the box office will receive one num
ber chance in the sewing machine. Half of
the numbered tickets will be deposited in a
box at the door, the oilier half will be re
tained by the purchaser. A child, to be
selected from the audience, will draw one
number from the hex at the close of the
performance, and the person present bold
ing a corresponding number takes the ma
chine.
The Opera.
Donizetti's grand opera "La Favorite,"
was given last night with the same excel
lence that has marked its representation
heretofore. As Alphonse 31. Devoyod
w as impressive anu grand. As Fernand
31. Gadilhe was graceful and impas
sioned. .Mile. Denaiu was in fine voice and
sang most charming. Leonore is not an at
tractive character, but Donizetti has woven
on a soiled, discolored web pearls of mel
ody that may well divert criticism. Mile.
Denain by her beauty and great art pre
sents us a Leonore that appeals to our sym
pathy and admiration.
To morrow night "11 Trovatore" will be
given. Announced to he soon presented
are the operas "Robert le Diable,"
"Charles VI." and "La Murtle;" also, "Les
Mousquetaires," and the opera bouffe
"Barbe Bleu."
St. Charles Theatre.
"Maum Cre" continues to attract good
houses at the St. Charles Theatre, and the
play, and the excellent acting of Mr. Joseph
Murphy, in the various characters he as
sumes therein, deserves the Datronage it
receives. The play will be repeated to-night.
Sunday night will be set apart for the ben
efit of the funny man of the company, Mr.
J. S. Delaney.

CUBA.
Hew the Protocol Is Received by the Hn
vnnese—Jouvellar's Proclamation.
Havana, December 2.—The publication
ot the protocol signed by Secretary Fish
and the Spanish minister caused intense
agitation and general indignation here, but
the popular feeling is calming down under
the conviction that the Spanish government
will defend Spanish honor, and under the
confidence which is placed in the sense,
justice and prudence of the people of the
United States. There have been no violeut
demonstrations, and the peace of the city
is undisturbed.
The people and the authorities are in full
accord, and the reports of the resignations
of the higher officers of the island are posi
tively contradicted. The authorities are
determined to save the country and pre
vent foreign interference. Captain General
Jouvellarnas issued the following proclama
tion to the inhabitants of Havana:
It is my duty to prevent public opinion
from going astray. I consider it opportune
to address you as a friend, recommending
the utmost calmness under the present cir
eumstances.
The Virginius question has given Spain's
enemies an opportunity to spread false ru
mors and alaiaiing news, certain that
they would produce an effect on your
ardent and unimpeachable patriotism,
while their only object was to promote the
rebel cause. It is true that treaties have
been made, and that I have received com
munications in relation to them; but, if I
have managed to inspire you with my con
fidenee, give me proof of it by your reflec
tion and tranquil behavior.
Be assured 1 will do everything possible
in behalf of the interest of the province and
dignity of the nation which, like yourselves,
I hold in higher esteem than life.
JOUVELLAR.
The proclamation is exclusively distrib
uted in the theatres, cafes and other public
places, and the excitement is subsiding.
The Virginius remains at the arsenal
afloat, and is in good condition.
An Ecclesiastic in Rebellion.
The ecclesiastical authorities of this city
have issued an edict, ordering the priests to
refuse P. dro L. Lorente, archbishop of San
tiago de Cuba, their assistance or coun
teuance if he celebrates any religiuus cere
mony, and not to permit him to enter any
church under their charge, because he (Lo
rente) is in open rebellion against the Holy
See, and has been excommunicated.
An order of the College of Cardinals re
places as vicar Priest Obéra, who was ex
pelled by L. Lorente.

maining here. He has telegraphed Consul

shot, had occurred, and that if the Ameri
can government demanded a surrender of
the prisoners no difficulty would be expe
rienced in obtaining them.

DISASTER.
Further Particulars Concerning the Dis
aster of the Ville du Havre.
London, December 2, 5 A. M.—Captain
Urquhart, of the Tramontane, reports that
when he met the Lochearne her bowsprit
was gone and there was a large hole in her
bow above the. water line. The boat con
tinued around the place where the steamer
went down for six hours.
The rescued people do not blame the
Lochearne for the collision. Her officers
and crew did their utmost to save life, and
only two of the survivors remained on the
Lochearne, one of whom went mad and
could not be removed. The first boat from
the Ville dn Havre was sent to ascertain if
the Lochearne could render any assistance.
The Ville du Havre is insured in London
for £90,000.
The four boats lowered by the Lochearne
found the passengers and crew floating on
the waves, holding to planks, buoys, spars
and whatever could be syged ae the wreck
went down. Many of the women saved
were floating on the water.
The captain of tùe Ville du Havre is re
ported to have heen quite exhausted by his
three days and nights of uninterrupted
duty. The officer who was in command
when the collision took place was lost.
The sufferings of those who were rescued
were intense, the cold being very severe.
3Iany persons were nearly insensible, and
would have utterly perished in a few min
utes more. The rescues were nearly all a
matter of haphazard, as time permitted no
organized effort or attemot at choice. The
purser of the steamei says in a few minutes
the ship began to sink amid great disorder
anil frantic terror; the scene was awful be
yond all description; the air was rent w'.rh
shrieks, but some were heard saying calmly:
"As we must die, let us die nobly."
The water rushed into the hold with in
credible velocity. I undressed myself, aud,
with a companion, jumped overboard aud
swam toward the Lochearne, then half a
mile distant; as I jumped 1 heard the shij
cracking, aud looking back saw her gi
down with one plunge forward. For a mo
ment the shrieks were terrible, then all
was silent. Alas ! it was the silence of death
No StouthernerN on (be Ville du Havre.
Washington, December 2.—No Southern
names appear among the Ville du Havre
lost. Among the rescued were ten women
How tbe Passengers Met Their Fnte.
New York, December 2.—Special dis
patches give the following of interest about
the loss of the Ville du Havre : Most of the
passengers were too terrified to try to sav
themselves. Many prayed, and many laid
down with the calmness of utter despair
Some, hearing the water pouring into the
ship, never quitted their staterooms. Whole
families thus went down together.

A Romance ef the Treasury.
A correspondent of the Louisville Courier
Journal furnishes the follow ino interesting
episode of the Treasury Department at
Washington:
In this connection I will write all the
pleasant things that hare been told me by
one who recently visited an ex-treasury
lady, iu her baronial castle near Autwerp.
It is one of the few instances where the
foreign alliance has been a success. It ia
another romantic treasury story, taken
from the National Asylum for Distressed
Females.
In ante-bellum days there was a rich
Washington widower with two sous and
two daughters who married a wealthy
widow lady with one daughter, from Lou
isiana. They lived and flourished until
several more children were added to the
joint stock concern, aud then the husband
suddenly died and the cruel sheriff came m
and claimed the house and furniture. All
the wealth which the former husband had
left to his widow and child had mysteri
ously disappeared. The poor woman was
wretchedly ill when ail this transpired,
which was during tlie thickest and hottest
of our national conflict. A lady who had
been a perfect stranger fo the family when
, in affluence heard of their great distress and
called upon them, offering to share her home
with the two girls, then sixteen years of
age and who were step-sisters. Other
friends came forvard and the family were
distributed arouad. The gitls soon found
employment in the printing bureau of the
treasury, from which, in course of time,
they were transferred to more congenial
positions.
There was a wonderful development of
talent, industry aud heroic virtue displayed
by the girl who is the subject of this
sketch. .She took a house and gathered all
the family together. She rented all the
rooms she could spare. Before entering
upon her official duties in the morning she
purchased the marketing and superintend
ed tlie household, for her stepmother wag
a helpless invalid. After office hours,
which was 1 P. M., she returned home and
eat down to the scaring machine to convert
into clothing for the younger children, who
were half sisters, the material bought with
the money she earned.
Fully rive years were passed in thi-• way,
The gill was beautiful and tinelv educated,
ana with all the natural instincts for be
coming dress and elegant society, yj-r she
never indulged in either, but wore a simple
black dress, with plain linen collar stud
cutis. One day some strangers were pass
ing through the different rooms iuthe treas
ury sight-seeing, and one, an attache ol the
Belgian legation, caught sight of the fair
young face, intent upon documents that
were strangely at variance with the refined,
ladv-like appearance of the girl. To out
the story short, he found a way to her ac
quaintance, and also to her heart. After
allowing nome time for him to order the
trousseau trout Paris, the wedding day was
fixed. Then arose the obstacle of a dif
ference in faith. He was willing to abjure
the Catholic view of marriage being a
sacrament, and be content with the Episco
pal service, but while marriage from that
prayer book is quite sufficient in this eoun
try, It is not valid in a Catholic country.
The representative of the Church of Rome
in this city refused to marry the couple if
the Protestant ceremony wa» to succeed the
Catholic. The inlatuated lover considered
that stratagem was lawful and right in such
a case, so he took his betrothed and a tew
frieflds to St. Aloysius, a distant church,
and there, with a few white lies about
themselves, they induced the priest t > tie
the knot. A few days afterward this ori
vatc marriage was publicly solemnized in a
crowded Episcopal church.
The next Sunday 'he man who had defied
the canons of Kmue wan publicly excom
municated. And now, after six years have
elapsed. I will repeat what I was told by a
gentleman who, in June, went to Kur<q>e
with the syndicate. iTe and the ladv had
served th»» government together in the'saice
bureau. He says: "When I arrived *n Ant
werp I sent my card to Mme. Von Harre I
soon received a note from her inviting me
to dinner. Of course I accep'ed. Site re
ceived me in her boudoir, as io-t little daugh
ter (the third child) was only three weeks
old. She was elegantly »iress» -i aud looked
both happy and beautiful. AM the <thi!dr»-n
weretonuly shown the baby brmgcoiupic'e
'y enveloped in old Flemish lace. The es
tate is one of the fitjest in the court ry,
and the house sumptuous. The dinner waa
served in a dining room that war grand
with silver aud rare pictures. Four ser
vants in livery waited on the table, and
there were nine different wines The lady
assured hint tha' everything he ate was
raised on the. estate from American seed.
The corn and other vegetables, the fruits,
and even the turkey was of American
parentage. After a pleasant renewal of
their old friendship, and the Baroness had
extracted all the news about the old office
and those still there, the Major rose to t tko
his leave. She bail sent her own carriage
and liveries for him, and returned him 'o
bis hotel the same way. Who will not «ay
she deserves all her good fortune and ha;v
tinessl Her friends rejoice to hear that her
tusband is man enflugh to appreciate hid
treasure and good luck iu obtaining so
noble a woman for his wife.
A rheumatic grocer living up town » now
spoken of as the most polished gentlemaa
here. Hi* wife bathed him thoroughly
with what she supposed was a°babamift
preparation for his_
