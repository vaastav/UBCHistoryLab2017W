RECOMMENDATIONS MADE
FOR MORE EFFICIENT NAVY
The Report of a Board Appointed to
Suggest Revisions
it Advises a Cliimge In
J,,e i UUI
dlidsliipmait.
Washington, Dec. 6. The examina
tion of the navy list discloses a condi
tion of affairs under the present law,
that seriously affects the efficiency
f the service and constitutes a grave
menace if not a positive danger to pub
lic interests. This statement is briefly
;he conclusion of the naval personnel
hoard under the presidency of Assist
ant Secretary Newberry, appointed
1 ist August -to suggest such a modin-
ation In the law affecting- the com
missioned personnel of the new navy as
might seem advisable.
The board recommends a remedy for
two serious evils, namely, the absence
f opportunity for officers of the flag
rank to familiarize themselves by ac
tual experience, with their duties as
commanders of fleets. In the short time
to elapse before their retirement for
!,; also an impending period of great
stagnation in promotion. The board
says that unless congress takes imme
diate action, the lower grades of serv
ice will become so congested that a
midshipman now in one of the lower
classes at Annapolis may possibly not
be promoted to become a lieutenant
until he. is between 43 and 50 years old.
The board regards as important that
there should be three vice admirals and
twenty-one rear admirals on the active
list.
An active list of officers is recom

A FRISCO GRAND JUROR
NATURAILY PRF JUDICtD
So Strong the Evidence of Municipal
Graft the Foreman Says He Is
Hardly Able to Proceed with Inquiry.
San Francisco, Dec. 6. B. P. Oliver,
foreman of the grand jury in the mu
nicipal graft investigation, was on the
witness stand this afternoon. In reply
to questions by attorneys for Duffy and
Nichols as to whether the grand juror
had any bias or prejudice against the
defendants. Oliver said: "From the
testimony I have just heard In the
'grand Jury room I am convinced that
j tho corruption of the present municipal
I administration is so great that any
jone of the grand jury will hardly be
able to complete a tnorougn investiga
tion. The more testimony I hear th
more I am astonished at the conditions
which obtain in the municipal govern
ment." Oliver stated that he wis not preju
diced against Duffy from what had
been transacted in the grand Jurj
room. On the contrary, he said lie felt
sympathy for DufTy. whom he consid
ered, only a tool in the hands of his
employers.
Something sensational developed
when C. G. Burnett, secretary of the
grand Jury, testified that he had en
trusted the records of the grand jury
to an employe of Assistant District At
torney Heney, after being assaulted
on Fillmore street. Burnett explained
this by saying that he was In con
stant fear of assault, as rough looking
characters brushed against him on hl.
way home, with the records. He
stated he believed they wanted to get
possession of them.
Mendel Rothenburg, another Juror,
volunteered a statement on the stan i
I that he had seen no evidence of graft
on the part of the supervisors. The
examination of the grand jurors will
be resumed tomorrow morning.
On five charges of extortion found
against each of them, Schmitz and
Ruef were today arraigned in the su
perior court before Judge Dunne. At
the urgent request of counsel for the
defense the case was continued until
next Monday for trie purpose of giving
the accused further time in which to
plead. When Schmitz and Ruef ap
peared there was a dramatic scene.
Schmitz stood as the Indictments were
read, but Ruef declined to stand up
until the court commanded him to
do so.

Mr. Bryan says: "The message con

Two Resolutions of

Washington. Dec. 6. The senate to

and Secretary Taft to furnish all infor
mation compatible which the public In

negro .troops of the. Twenty-fifth In

complish this request, one to the presi
dent and the other to the secretary of

Thla action followed a debate of two
hours In which the merits of the dis
charge of the soldiers received atten
tion. Senator Morgan of Alabama, devot
ed two hours to a discussion of his
resolutioixto secure control of the Pan

RESOLUTIONS OP- INQUIRY.
The Senate Addresses Two on the Sub.
ject of Negro Troops.
Washington. D. C. Dec. . The sen
ate adopted the Penrose resolution ask
ing the president for Information re
garding the discharge of the negro
troops of the Twenty-fifth infantry and
also the Foraker resolution directing
the secretary of war to transmit Infor
mation on the same subject. Both res
olutions carried an Identical amend
ment by Senator Culberson, asking
specially for an order to Major Pen
rose, commandin'g the troops which di
rected him not to turn over to the Tex
as authorities certain troops demanded.
This action followed a two hours de
bate on the propriety of asking the
president for information or directing
the secretary of war to furnish it. Mr.
Foraker produced the printed testimo
ny of the case, extracts of which he
read to show, as he said, that It was
"unsatisfactory. Incomplete, and of a
flimsy character." Mr. Culberson took
an opposite view, but both agreed that
with "unsatisfactory information" it
was useless to discuss the case. Mr.
Penrose Introduced his resolution in the
Interest of a negro constituency of
Pennsylvania that had addressed it to
the president. Because the action had
been by the president he regarded it as
a matter of courtesy to ask him for
Information.
During the debate a report was cur
rent among the senators that the pres
ident had felt that It would be a mat
ter of courtesy If a resolution should be
addressed to himself and so strong it
was said, was this feeling on his part,
that he had intimated that unless this
course was taken there would be no re
sponse. STOOD FOR STATES RIGHTS.
