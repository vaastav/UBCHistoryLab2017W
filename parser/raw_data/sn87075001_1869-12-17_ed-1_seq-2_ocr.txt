In eon, in before yon for the flntt limes
Clii-f Magistrate I thi great nation, it is
Willi grntitnde to the Uiver of All Good for
the many benefit we enjoy; we are blessed
with pcs'c at home, ml are witlmnt ruling

with It nitorjr unsurpassed in fertility, of

1 tH'TMid the requirements of the govorrrncut
Hijiplv, harmony ia being rapidly retoied
within on own border, msnufaclures
hitherto unknown in onr country are apriug
fng up iu all direction, producing a degree
of national indcpondi uce uncqnalcd by that
of any other power. These blessins, Mil
eonutli a others, are lnttuated to your caro,
and more, lor fe keeping fur the brief pe
ril d of your tenure of oillco. In a ehort
time we rimt each of n return to tho rank
of the people who hare conferred upon in
our honor, and account to tnem for our
stewardship. I earnestly desare that nrllher
Ton nor I may becoudenied by a free and en
lightened oonatituency, nor by our own con
science. Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic mag
nitude, aided a it was or tuo auipaiiiy ami

her constitution, republican in form, elocted

a Btatfl Legislature, and all oth

and performed all Ilia lota tbun required
of thorn bv the reconstruction ax is of Con-
' gresa. Biibaequently, however, in violation
of the constitution which thev had lust rati
tied, a auica decided by the Supremo Court
of the state, they unseated the colored mem
ber of tbe Legislature and idmitted to scats
some members who were disqualified by the
third clause of the fourteenth amendment to

The lose of our commerce iu the only result
fit the lato rebellion which ha not received
sHflicient attention rroin you. tonus sut
tect 1 call X our cariiust attention. I will not
now aiiggeit plans by which this object may
be etfccn .l, but will, if naoesury,muke It the
hliopiet oi a special uiessuHU uunu uiu bus
aiou of Congress.
At the March term, Congress, ly a Joint
resolution aiillivriz. ,1 the executive to ord
vleetioiia in tti stitlca of Virginia, Missiseippl
and Texas, to suouni to them llio voiiKtim
tiona which each had previously in conven
tion framed and snbuuUu ': the c'ontilutions.
t illier enlire or ill peratu parts, to be voted
upon, at Ihv discretion oi ine executive,
t'uder this authority elections wore called,
In Virginia the election took place on the (jlh
of July, lsiiu. Tho Governor and Lieutenant
(ioveriior eUcted have bceu installed. Tho
Jj'K'i-miure no t aud did all roquirod by this
resolHtiou and bv all the reconstruction nctj
of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful
authority. 1 recommend that her Senators
ainliCcpreiitativcs be admitted to Congress,
and thai the statu bo fully restored to its
place in the family of states. Klectious wcro
called in Missiseioiii and Texas to commence
on the 30lh of November, lnu'J, and to last
t wo days In 3usnissippi ana ruur days in Texaa.
The elections have taken place, hut tho re
sult is not known. It is to be hoped that the
acts of the Legislatures of these states, when
they meet, will be such as to receive your ap
proval, and thus cloao the work of reooustrno
tioo. Among the evils growing out of tho
rebellion, and not referred to, is that of in
-redeemable currency. It is an evil which I
nope will receive your most earnest atten
tion. It la 1 dill y.andono of the highest du
' ties of the Government, lo secure to the citi
zens a medium of exchange of fixed aud un
varying value. This implies a return to a
specie bni,iand no substitute for it can be
devised. It should be oommenced now, and
reached at the earliest practicable moment
consistent with a fair regard to the interest
of the debtor class. Immediate resumption,
if practicable, would not be desirable. It
would compel the debtor alas to pay beyond
their contracts the premium ot guld at the
date of their purchase, aud would bring
bankruptcy aud ruiu to thousands. Fluctua
tions, however, in the paper value of the
measure of i l values, gold, is detrimental
to the interest ot trade; it makes a mau of
business an involuntary gambler, for m all
salt wktre lutura payment is
to b made both parties speculate a
t j what will be tho value of the currency to
be paid and received. I earnestly rcc immoiid
to you, theu, such legislation as will insure
a gradual return to specie payments, and put
an Immediate, stoplo fltictuationainthe valne
of currency. The method to secure these re
mit are as ntimerons a the speculators ou
political scunomy. To secure the latter I
see but one way, and that is to authorize tke
trtasury to redeem Its own paper at a fixed
price whenever presented; to withhold from
circulation all sued eurrenoy redeemed unti
sold a); am for gold. The vast resources of
Ilia nation, both developed aud nndovelopcd,
ought lo make our credit the best on earth.
With a lias burden of taxation than the citi
zen has endured for the six years past, the
entire public, debt could bo paid iu'leu years;
but it is not desirable thai people should
uo isxe-u iu pay it in mat time, iear by year
the ability to oav increases in a ranid rii
but Ilia burdxu of interest ought to be re-
uuueu as rauidir a can tie done without the
violation of conlraot. The public debt is rcp
reaenud in j,rest part by bond having fiom
uTo iu ten suu rrom ten lo lorty yeara lo run,
beariug interest at the rate of six pel cent,
and live oer cent, reanectivelv. It is ontiimsl
with the Government to pay theso boiida at
any period alter the exp ration of the least
time mentioned upon tneir Tacv. The time
has expired when a great part of Ilium may
be taken up, and tho time is rapidly ap
proaching when all may he. It ia believed
that all which are now due may be replaced
vj uoiuis uearuig a rate oi mitreni not ex
ceeding 4 j per tent ', and, a rapidly a the
remainder beooui due. tint thev uiav be re
placed ui tbe same way. To accomplish this
it may be necessary to authorize tho in
terest to be paid at either of three or four of
the money centre of Kurope. or bv tbe A'
; slstant Treasurer of the United Htatos.at the
option of the holder of the bond. I suggest
.this subject for the consideration of Con
gress, sua also, simultaneously with this, the
I iropriety of redeeming our currency as oe
ore suggested, at its ruarkU vatuo at the
time the law goes into ellsot, increasing the
rate at which currency will bo bought and
sold from day to day, or w.u k to week, at the
aamo rale of iuturcst as the government pays
upon it bonds.
I The snbjeet of tariff and interns! taxation
srlll neutosarily receive your attention. The
reruuue of thu country are greater thau th
'requirements, and may with safety be reduo
, ad; but a tbe funding ot lbs debt in a 4 oMJ
f.tr oi ot . would rucloc th annual cuncnic
argely, llio, after funding and Justifying a
greater reduction of luxation thau would be I
now expedient, 1 suggest a poatpdneiueut of
this question until the uexl lueuliag of Cou-
f:rs, a It msy be advisable to modify taxa
idu aud tarllt In Instance where unjust or
burdensome, discriminations am made by
resent laws, although a general revision of
the law regulating the subject mav be lieu
essarv, still I recommend the postponement
of il for th present. I also suggest the re
newal of the ui on incomes, but at a reduced
rate, lay of three per cent., this tax to expire
iitibiuti ituuawUilU the fuiuhug of tho us
a
of
oy
a
ill
Clonal debt a here suggested, I feol safe In
saying that the tsxe anil revenne irom im
ports may be Trdnrrd fly from sixty to
Ightv millions per annum at once, and till
further redneed from year lo year as the re
source of the country are developed. The.
report ff the Keerelary of lh Treasury show
tho receipt of the Government for Ihe fiscal
rear ending JnneHOth, 119. to be 370,93.
717, and the expenditures, Including interest,
bounties, Ac. to ho 321,4),.V.7. Tho estim
ate for the ensuing year are more favorable
to the Government, md will, no doubt, show
1 large decresse of the pnblic debt. The re
ce tits in the Treasury beyond the expendi
tures have excetdeil tneamnnni necessary
lo pluoe to the credit of the linking fund, as
provided bv law. To lock up tho surplus in
the Treasn'rv ind withhold II from circula
tion, would "lead to such 1 contraction of th
corn ncv a to cripple, trad and erlonsly
aff. ci lb piosperlty of tho country. Under
these circumstances, the Secretary of the
Trenrv and mvsell heartily concurred in
the prop'rictv of using all the surplus cur
renev in the Treasury in the purchase of Gov
emnieut bonds, thus reducing the interest
bearing debt of the country, and of submit
ting lo Congress the question of the dis
position lo bt mad of the boad so pur
chased.
The bond now held by the i reasury amount
to about 7i,iKl,0U0, including those belong
ing to the sinking fund. I recommend that
tin whole be placed to th credit of tbe link
ing fund. ....

will place the ollica on a footing of dignity
commensurate with It imnorlanc and the

A the United State I the freest of all na
tions, so too, its people ympatuio witn all
piople itrngglitvg for liberty and aelf-govern-nteut!
hut while, ao avmpathiicing. ii Is due
to our honor thai wo should abstain from en
forcing our view iiixin unwilling nations,
and from taking an interested part, without
invitation, iu the quarrels betwton different
nations, or botween governments and their
eubiect. Our course should a'way bo in
conformity with atrict Inatico and law, Inter
national and local. Huch has been the policy
ot the administration In dealing with those
nnestions for more than a Tear. A valnablo
province of Hpain, and a near neighbor of
ours, in whom all of our people cannot but
feci a deep interest, has been atrnggling Ivr
independence anu ireeunm. ine people ana
nnvcrnmcut of the United aitite entertain
the tame warm feelings and sympathies for
the poopi or t uuain tneir panning struggle,
that thev manifested throughout the pravi
ons struggle between Hpain and the former
colonies in behalf of the latter, but the con
tsat at no time assnmcd the conditions
which amount to a war in
the sense of International law, or which would
show th existence of a i rVicYu political
organization of the insurgent sufficient to
justify a recognition of belligerency. The
principle I maintained that tins nation is ita
own itidge when to accord the rights of bel
ligervnry either to a people struggling to
rree themselves roiu a government tuev nc
licva to bo oppressive or to indepondeni ni
tidis at war wiUi each other. The I'niled
Htilcs have no disposition to Interfere wdh
the existing relations of Spain lo her colonial
possessions on this continent. Thev believe
that in due time Hpain and other European
power will lltd their interest in terminating
those relatione and establishing their present
dependencies a independent powers aud
member of the family of nation. Those
deuendencie are no longer regarded a sub
Ject to triusfor from ono Eiirupein nation to
anotuer. vrnen ine preaeut relations oi ine
colniiios ceaao thev ire to become indepen
dent power, tx' reining the right of choice
and of self control in the determination of
their inlin e condition and relation with oth
er power. The I'nito l Mates in order
to tint a stop to bloodshed in Cuba,
tnd in the interest of a neighboring
pcop.e, proposed tneir good otuce lo prt
the existing contest, to a termination, i

Which we believed could be reccivod by Cu
ba, was withdrawn. It is hoped tint the
good offices of the United Mate msv yet
prove advantageous for tho aottleinentof this
unhappy strife. Meanwhile a number of
illegal expeditions against Cuba have been
broLoa up. It ha been the endeavor of the
administration t j exeoutu the neutrality law
In good faith, no matter how unpleasaut the
task, made so by the sulTcring we hav en
dured from lack of good faith towaida ua by
other nation, the united mates schooner
Lizzie Major was arrested on the high sea
by a Knanish frigate, aud two passengers
taken from il aud carried is prisoners to
uuoi. ucpreauuiauous oi muse laei wore
mnnu by inn Npaniau government as on a
official information of them leached Wash
ington. The two passenger were aet at
Ilburtr, and the Hpitiish government assured
me Lulled Mate mat me captain or the
iiii-'atu, iu making tho capture, had acted
without law; that he had been reprimanded
fur the irregularity of hi conduct, and that
tho Hpanish authentic in Cuba would not
sanction an act that omld viola1 e the right
or trine, with the sovereignty or tills nation.
The question of the seizure of the brig Ma
ry Lnwoll. it one of the liahami Islands, bv
the Hpanish authorities, i now the subject of
correspondence outwesn tin government
and those of Hpain and Great Britain. The
Captain General of Cuba, about May last, is
sued a proclamation authorizing aiarch to be
made of vessels on the high seas. Iiutnedl-
ito remonstrance, was made against this,
wneronnon tne uaptain uenerai issed a new
proclamation, limiting the right of search of
vessels of the United Mates so far as author
ized under the treaty of 17;i5. This pioda
niation, however, wa iiumediatuly with'
drawn.
I have alwav felt that the most Intimate
relations should be cultivated between tho
republic of the United Hlates and all iudu,
ueudent nations on this continent. It may
be well worth considering whether new trea
tie between th United Htati and them may
not oe proniaoiy entereu into to secure more
intimate re atious friendly, commerced and
otnerwise.
The subject of an Iiiteroccania canal, to
connect me Aiianuo aim I'aeiuo uoeaus,
through the Isthmu of Uarien, is one iu
which commerce Is greatly Interested. In
struetions have been given to our minister to
the Iteimtilic of Hie l ulled Mates of Co um
bis, to endeavor to obtain authority for i stir
vey by this government, iu order to duter.
miue the practicability of such an nndertak-
'ni euwuui mr tun iigu ui way to

Iii order to comply with the igrecruoiit of
the Uuited Htitea as tot mixed commission at
iiimi for tne idiustmeut of claims, il bucaiuo
nccossary to scud a cumiiu-sioner and
secretary to Lima in August
last. ."o appropriation having been
made by Congress for tint pn'pose, it Is now
asked that one be made covering the past and
future expenses of the commission,
The good offices of the United States to
bring ibout a puioe betwoen Hpain and the
.South American republics, with which she is
at war having been accepted by Hpain, l'eru
and Chili, a comrress baa been invited t hs
he 1.1 in Washington during the preaeut win
ter. A grant has been given to Europeana of
an exclusive right or transit over th territory
of Nicaragua, to which Coata Itica ha given
it assent, which, it is lileged, ooiirliots with
th vested right of citizens of the United
Htatcs. The I pirtraent of Htalo hi now
tins auniuct under consideration.
Tbe Minister of l'eru having made repre
sentation that there wa a state of war be
tween Peru and Hpain, aud that Hpain wa
constructing in slid near New York thirty
gunboats, which might b used by Hpalli in
sucli a way as to relieve the naval fore at
Cuba, so as to operate against Peru. order
were given ui preveul lliolr departure. No
further step having been lakm by th rep
resentative of tii Peruvian Government to
prevent tho departure of those vessel, and
not fueling authorized lo detain the property
a nation with winch wu are at peace ou a
mere executive order, tne matter ha born
referred to tho court to ducidu. The con
duct of I ho war between the allies aud the
republic ol Paraguay liai mule the inter-
oourae Willi that country so dilhx.-ult that it
pas ueen aavisaiue to withdraw our represen
tative from there.
Toward the close of the last administration
convention was sigued at Loiuhm for the
settlement of all outstanding claims betwem
Great lintain and th United Htates, which
railed to receive the advice and consent of
the Helmut to It ratillcVion. The lime and
the circumstances attending the negotiation
the treaty were favorable to it acceptance
me people or lb united mates, and It
provision wero wholly liiadeouata fur lha
settlement of Hi gray wrong that bad
been sustained by this government, as well
by its citizens. The injuries result
ing to tho United Htate by rcison of the
course adopted by Great liiitaiu during our
lato civil war in Increased rates of insurance,
the diminution of exports and iuipurls.anil
other obstruction to domestic Industry and
production, in It effect upon the forolpn
oonimeroe of th country, and in Ihe de
crease and trans rer to ureat r.ruain oi onr
commercial marine, in tho prolongation of
the war, and Increased cost both in treasure
and In lives of Its suppression, could not be
adjusted and satisfied a ordinary commer
cial claim which continually arise between
commercial nation; and yel Ihs conven
tion treated them limply a such ordi
nary claim, from which they d.lTer
more widely In the gravity of their character
than in the magnitnd of their amount, gre it
even a that difference Is. Not a word wa
f und In the treaty, and not an Inference
could I drawn from It, lo romov tho sense
of unfriendliness of the course of Great
Britain in our strnggle for existence, which
had universally Impressed itself upon the
people of this country, lirllvving that this
convention, thus misconceived In its arnpn,
and made Inadequate in its provisions, would
not nave produced the hearty, cordi il settle
ment of th prnding questions Which alone
ia consistent wiih th relations which I dent re
to have established between the United Htats
and Great lirilaio, I regarded the action of
the Senate, in the rejection of the treaty, to
have been wisely taken In the interest of
peace, and a neoeasary step in the direction of
a perfect and cordial' friendship between the
two countries. A sensitive people, ecn-cion
of their power, are more tt case under a great
wrong, wholly nnatoned. than under the re
straint of settlement which satifflc neither
their idea of Justice, nor their grave aense
of the grievance. The rejection of the treaty
wa followed by a atato of publio feeling ou
both aides, which I thought not favorable to
an Immediate attempt at renewed negotia
tions. I accordingly so Instruct d the Min
ister ol th Unitod Htates to Great Britain,
and fonnd that my view in this regard were
shared by Ilor Majesty's minister. I hope
that th time may soon arrive when Iho two
government oan approach the solution of
this momenton question with an assuranoe
of what la due to the right, dignity and hon
or of each, and with the determination, pot
only lo remove the cause of complaint in the
pist, but to lay the foundation of a broad
principle of publio law. which will prevent
future differences, and lend to Biol and
continued pcaee and friend-hip. This. is
now the only grave quertion which tho
United Htates have with any foreign nation.
Th question of a treaty of reciprocity be
tween th UniUd Htates and the Untish
Province on thi continent has not been fa
vorably considered by tho Administration,
Tho advantage of such treaty would bo
wholly In favor of the liritish producer, ex
cept possibly few epgaged In tho trade be
tween the two sections. No citiicn of the
Unitod Htatc would be benefitted by the
reciprocity. Our Internal taxation would
provo a protection to British producer
aimoat equal to th protection which onr
manufacturer now receive from tho tariff.
Homo arrangement, however, for the regula
tion of commercial intercourse between the
United Htate aud the Dominion of Canada
may be desirable.
The commission for adjusting Ihe claims of
the Hudson nay and rugci's Mound Agri
cultural Company upon tho United H'.atcs,
ha terminated it labors. Tho award of
of tilM.OOO ha been made, and all rights
and title of tbe company o,i lue territory of
the tinted Htate have been txtingiiii-liid.
Deeds for tbe property of the ooiupany have
have been reouivod, An appropriation by
Congress to moet this sum is asked.
Tho commissioner for determining tht
northwestern land-boundary betwoen tire
United Htate aud th Ilrit'iab Possessions
under the treaty of lSjfi, liavo compl 'ted
their labor, and the commission ha d1
solved. In conformity with the recommendation of
Congress, a proposition was early ma le lo
the liritish Government to abolish the mixed
court created nndur tho truaty of April 7.
18.03, for lha suppression of tho slave
trado. The subject still under nrgoiia-
f "Si
ll having come to my knowledge that a cor
fiorato company, organized under liritish
aw, proposed to laud upon the shore of
the United Htate, and to operate there, a
snb-meilne cable., nnder a cone, salon from
HI Majesty the Emperor of the French, of
an exclusive right, tor twenty year, of tele
giaphlc communication between '.Ui shore
of Franoo. with tho very ob ojtlonable fea-
lura of ftubjeoting all mossagca convoyed
thereby to the sovereignty aud control of the
French Government, I caused tho French
and liritish legation at Washington to
bo made acqua'nted with the pmbiblc
policy of Control on tho suMoct,
as fornshadjwed by the bill which
passed th" HciiaIu in March last, This mew
rrom tno representatives oi ine company au
agretment to accept as a basis of their ope
ration Ih provisions of the bill or of such
ther enactment on the auhleet a might bo
passed during the approaching session of
Congress; also to use their lnu iencs to se.
oure from the French Government a modifi
cation of their concession, so aa to permit
the lauding upon French soil of any cable
belonging to any company incorporated by
the authority of the United Htates. or of any
state in the Union, ami on their part not to
oppose ine eeraouaumeni oi any sueti caoio.
Iu consideration of this agrocuicnt, I direct
ed tho withdrawal of all opposition by the
United Htat a authorities to the landing
of the cable and to tbe working of it
until the meeting of Congress. I
regret to say that tbore has been no
modification made in the company's conoi s
ion. nor. so far as I can learn, havo thev at
tempted to ccnra ny. Their concessions
exclude the capital tnd citizen of thu United
Htate from competition upon the shore of
France. I recommend legislation to protect
the right of citizen of tho United Htates,
a well as the dignity and sovereignly of tbe
nation agaiust such assumption. I shall al o
endeavor to secure by negotiation and aban
donment or the principle of monopolies in
ocean telegraph cables. Copies of thi cor
respondence at herewith furnished.
The unsettled political condition of other
countries less rortunato thau our own somo
t imes induces their citizen to come to the
United Htate lor the sole purpose of bo,
coming naturalized. Having secured this,
they return to their native country
and reaide there without disclosing
ineir cnaug oi aucgiinco. 'jucy ao
cept offioial positions of trust or honor,
which can only be held bv citizeua of their
native land; they Journey undur passports
uescrioing timu a aucn citizens, auu it is
only when civil discord, after perhaps year
of quiet, threatens them or threatens their
f eraons or their properly, or when their na
ive atate drafts them into it military ser
vio, that the fact of their change of allegiance
is made known. They reside permanently
from tbe United Htates; thev contribute
nothing to it revenue; they avoid the duties
of its citizenship, and they ouly make them
selves known by a claim of protection. I
have directed thn diplomatic tnd Consular
otnotri or tne united htilcs to scrutlnizd
carefully all such claim of protection. Thu
citizen of the United Htates, whether native
or adopted, who discharges hi duty to
bis country, is entitled to ita complete pro
tectioa. wiulo I havo a voico lu the direc
tion ol aflaira I shall not consent to impair
the eocrcd right by conferring it upon llcti
tiou or fraudulent claimants. Ou the accca
siou oi tne present aunuuisiratiou, 11 was
found that the minister for North Germany
bad made propositions for negotiations for a

ARRIVAL OF CHINESE.
Importation of a Herd of Women—
Scenes at the Wharf—A Revolting
Practice.
[From the Van Francisco Bulletin, Nov. 23.]
At 8 o'clock a. m. yesterday the steamer
from China and Japan came np the harbor.
As soon as she came in sight there was a
general excitement and stampede in the
Chinese quarters. Men and women piled
into backs, express wagons, or cars, and
all went hurrying to th landing place, cor
ner of First end lb-annas streets. Many
special and regular policemen and officers
of the Society for tb Protection of Chinese
wer with them, and before tbe steamer 1 ad
reached her moorings a crowd of about
2f H) people, white and Asiatics, bad as
sembled in front oi,tbe gates. Ouly snch
mon is showsd pass or bad some busi
ness on the wharf, were allowed to pass
the gates; bat whenever the door was
oponed there was a rush for it from all
sides, which tbe keepers could scarcely
withstand, and to keep tbe anxions ones
back, rosewood clubs were used with great
freedom aud stnnning effect. On the
wharf abont half-way down from the gates
a rope was drawn across, and beyond that
none bnt officers, custom house inspectors
and the "eleot" of the Celestial were allow
ed to go. As soon as the steamer's clanks
were down the Chinamen began to come
off and deposit their Inpgnge on the wharf.
An exciting scene opened wnen me in
spectors of Cnstoms commenced opera
tiona on the lnggage, looking for contra
band opium, ailk. eta. Kanh man's pro
perty was gone throngh by them, and with
a rapidity and recklessness which evidently
oewuaerea tne uninamen. Alacn or the
baggage was broken needlessly. Valuable
camphor wood cheits were kicked open,
even while the owners were reaching for
the keys. Carpet bags were torn open and
their contents scattered on tbe ground, fre
quently when there was no opium In thorn.
Home of th people were roughly bandied,
particularly where trace of opium were
discovered.
One man made bis appearance and was
alking very coolly away. An officer
though! bis clothing was too heavy, and
that he bad on too many coata lie there
fore stopped bim, took out bis knifo and
sloshed into the garments, much to the as
tonishment of the Celestial, lie had five
