Washington, Dec. 4,1871.
Meotiag af Cssgresa?Bffrct of the President's
Message and Keeeameadatiene.
The meeting of Congress to-day had many re
markable reatnrcs, the great question* or taxation
and of political supremacy being most prominent.
Although the readers of tne Herald had been
already informed of the principal points In the
President's Message and the leading names on the
Honse committees, still there was great interest to
see the document itself, in the one case, and tne
list In the other. The effect of the Message was
plainly felt both m and out of Congress. It is re
garded In all circles to-mgnt as a strong Message.
Especially do the recommendations In regard to a re
duction of taxation give geueral satlslaction, ana it Is
tbonght may yet compel the retirement of Mr.
Boutwell from the Cabinet, notwithstanding the
trimming coarse he adopts in his report. The pre
diction was freely indulged during the last few
days that the President would not dare to set him
self in such complete antagonism to the well known
policy of the Secretary of the Treasury, as was
indicated in the synopsis of the Message printed in
the Herald a week ago. Kow that he has done so,
however, everybody is ready to applaud, and all
recognize in his recommendations a new departure
which cannot fail to prove successful. Another
point which elicits much comment Is the favor the
President gives to the general amnesty and the ex
treme moderation of ills tone regarding the Kn
Klnx.
The Senate was as decorous as ever, and all the
great guns-Sumner, Morton. Cameron, Wilsou,
Sherman, Scott, Edmunds, Anthony, Tfaurman,
Kenton and Conkllng?were early at their places;
bnt there was no scene, and a little hand
shaking was the only evidence that this was
the Drat day or the session. Dr. Newman
made toe prayer, taking care to nold up
the example of Tammanr before the good
giver even of Senates. The new Senator from Mis
sissippi, Governor Alcorn, waa then sworn In, but
there was no chance for a scene in this, and so the
spectators turned in despair to the political ma
noeuvres which at once began to develop them
selves?Prank Blair s movement upon tne admin
istration on the Kn Klux question, Senator Sumner's
well wern championship of the negro race and his
taunt to the Treasury Departineut In the speech
f with wbieh ho introduced hie bill to substitute com
pound interest notea for legal tenders, and Mr. Ed
monds' bill to provide for civil service reform.
Biair Indicated that he was ready to light the ad
ministration on the Kn Kinx, Snmner enunciated
the specie payment views, which of late have
so often appeared in the Herald, Edmunds
reminded the Senate that Andy Johnson was not
ret entirely (orgottco, and this was all. There was,
of coarse, the Utile byplay of receiving the customary
Message from the House of iiepresentatives, of
sending the customary committee to the other
end or the avenue and receiving the Message from
tne President, Mr. Gorbam, the Secretary, read
mat document In a slow and measured voice, con
turning nearly an hour In the task, and then every
body went home, content with the day's work.
Senator Blair's resolution of inquiry in relation to
the President's authority for suspending the writ
of habeas corpus In South Carolina is generally re
garded as completely answered by the Message,
. and there Is a disposition to await the report of the
Attorney General and of tne Joint Comm tteo to in
vestigate alleged southern outrages before passing
lodgment on the Executive actlou.
There was some little remark on the President's
illusion to the question of polygamy, and a slight
disposition is manifested to criticise the vigorous
rone which he adopted both in condemning the
Mormons and in praising the United States Courts
of Utah, lint the subject on which criti
cism is most freely Indulged is In regard
to Mr. Catacazy, until recently the Russian Minister
here. The severity of the President's words is not
so much dwelt upon as the questionable taste or
mentioning the name of the discarded Minister.
Many persons, among them many Senators aud
Representatives, think or atrect to think that any
allusion to the unrortunatc quarrel was out of
place. But President Washington htmseir set the
precedent in the case or Mr. Genet, who was the
Minister of the Prenon republic, and, luce Mr,
Catacazy, had made bimsetf repugnant to the ad
ministration. Genet's case, however, was in every
way more flagrant than Mr. Catacazy's, and if tho
precedent proves anything it Is contended it
oognt to have been rltndly followed. President
Washington did not speak of the French Minister
by name, and it is said by those who Interest them
selves in the subiect that neither should President
Grant have mentioned the name of the Russian
Minister. The reference to the quarrel is a godsend
among the gossips, and diplomatic circles espe
oially are happy over so frnltrul a theme.
The Mends of the administration are jubilant.
Thev regard the President's recommendations In
respect to general amnesty as having completely
taken the wind out of Greeley's sails; while his
coarse in regard to civil service, it tt claimed,
will lay Schurz on the sheir. But they are not
even content with these victories, and believe tdat
the new taxation policy will deprive Sumner of all
the glory of his specie payment resolution. It can
not be denied, however, that the thrust of the Mas
sachusetts senator at Secretary Boutwel! in his
little speech to-day was exceedingly neat. His
taking occasion to say that the paymeut of the na
tional debt was a feather tn the cap of the adminis
tration, but that H was only a leather, was a sar
casm which nothing but the extreme frankness of
the message could have relieved. The prospect now
is that we shall have low taxes and specie payments
in a very short lime. Both wings of the republican
part? have suddenly taken advanced ground, ami
on all questions of fluanoe and taxation all tnc
factious stand to-day whero yesterday it would
have been thought impossible to place them. This
Is certainly a great deal lo accomplish on tnc flrst
day of a session of Congross, and everybody is hope
ful ?Congress which assembled for political
purposes merely wiu achieve something useful. If
the long intended conference oi| the republican
'??soreheads" now takes place, as everybody is say
ing it is to lake place, it win oe found iliat not even
u Mir go Wilkes, with all his genius for effect, can
ga'vautze life Into (he movement which Is Intended
to mage Greeley or Trumbull President, insteud of
Grant. As a part of the wonderful success of this
day, whieii leaves parties as they were before^ and
yet completely changes their attuude betorff the
country, tnc composition of the new Committee of
Way and Means is important.
time ago ttifl JUE"ai.i> said Mr. Dawes would I
be lta chairman. The partisans of Kelley not only
denied this, bat denied U with a rampant rigor
that was refreshing. To-day Kelley was ruthlessly
slaughtered lu the very house of his friends, and at
Biauie wants to follow in the footsteps of his smit
ing predecessor and go from the Speaker's chair to
the loftier seat of the President of the Senate, he
took his cue from Grant, and made this
committee, as these despatches yesterday said
he would make it, a most potent enemy
of extreme protection. Dawes lost no time in
stepping forward as the leader of the House, and be
made himself so busy throughout the day in moving
tne reference of bills to tneir approp-late commit
tess, and in playing the part of bellwether to an in
congrous Hook, that he bad no time to think of his
own queer, If not incongrons, comml'tee. Mr.
Blame ingeniously pitted all the tariff and antl
tariff elements against each other, and whdo he
allowed the second and third plnc:s to Maynurd and
Keiley he associated Mr. Roberts, of New Vork, with
as them as a man wno wonld not go so far as either
the Tennesee or the Pennsylvania Representative,
but would more nearly accord with Ula chief.
The Speaker seems to have grouped these men
together as a quartet who wonld favor a remission
of the duty on tea and coffee, and placed them op
posite to another eqnallr happy quartet of the
democratic persuasion who will not be content
with any such remission, but want to take free
trade as well-organized Americans take their whls -
key, "straight." The democracy ef Mr. Brooks, of
New York, Mr. Kerr, of Indiana, and Mr. Beck, of
Kentucky, is so well established that Mr. Flnkeln
burg, of Missouri, who Is a strict tschurz man, but
an extreme revenue reformer, may not binsh to be
associated with them. The result of this carious
arrangement Is to make Mr. Bnrchard, of Illinois,
the real chairman of the Committee of Ways
and means, for, while he is a republican,
he is snch an exceedingly moderate or
very low tariff man, that he has actually on all
questions the casting vote In committee, and
holds in his nands the balance of power for this
administration.
Grant always goes to Illinois for his states
men, and this time he has sandwiched htm
number six on the Committee of Ways
and Means. The Speaker's shrewdness is
made sttll further manliest by the manner la wbieh
lie has contrived. In tne makeup of committees, to
gratify the pride of each section. Though the long
experience and ability or their representatives
compel the giving of the chief prizes to Massachu
setts and Ohio, yet the Mississippi Valley
States are lully recognized. Massachusetts has
lour imporiant chairmanships -those of Ways and
Means, Foreign Affairs. Banking and Currency and
Accounts. Connoctlcut, Maine and Vermont have
two eaob?those on the District of Colombia and tho
House branch of the Joint Select Ka Klax Investigat
ing Committee being tne Important ones. New York
has two of lmport&nco?Paclflo Railroad and
Public Lands. The latter Is or great signiOcance In
view or the land grant lobby that wait in the bails
of the House. Pennsylvania has fonr chairman
ships, Naval Affairs and Patents being Included.
Ohio takes five places, and includes Appropriations,
Judiciary and Commerce. Michigan and Wisconsin
have the lead on four oommlttees, that of
Claims, with ex-Governor Blair at Its head, being
well handled. The Illinois. Indiana, Missouri and
Nebraska delegations have ten chairmen. These
include Elections, Post Offices and rost
Roads, Manufactories, Military and In
dian Affairs, tue Territories and In
valid Pensions. Mr. Blaine has thrown a
considerable Vice Presidential sop to the southern
Cerberus, and given seven radicals from that sec
tion chairmanship or Indifferent committees, the
most important of which is that on Education and
Labor.
The most apparently disappointed man Is
Mr. Hooper, of Massachusetts, who gets
only the Committee on Banking and Currency
while he thinks he should have been made the
leader of the House. Tho mo9t displeased would
seem to be Mr. Lynch, of Maine, who onght to have
been chairman of the Committee on commerce, and
only gets a place so far down that the cojntry will
be scandalized.
The gossips say a personal pique has something
to do with Mr. Lynch's appointment. While bewail
ing the fate of General Butler, Mil this sympathy
was wasted, however, for Bntler is as happy as a
clam. Indeed, he has again perpetrated one of
bt bnge Jokes, and Intends, even as Chairman
of the Committee on the Revision of the
Laws, to prove to the House ana the country
that where MacGregor sits is the head of the table.
This committee is the nearest approximation to
that old English parliamentary custom of referring
all bills to a judicial committee, wnose function it
Is to inqnire into the evil a bill is designed to
remedy or the good It is Intended to promote; to
ascertain whether the bill will effect its object, and
to see what Is the existing legislation on the sub
ject; above everything else to secure freedom
Irom ambiguity or dispute as to tbo intent and
meaning of a new law. If Butlers Committee
had been allowed to perrorm Its proper duties
In the past, such egregious blunders as were
pointed out in the Hrrald a year ago In
regard to Mr. jenckes' unintentional repeal of the
Bub-Treasury act could not have occurred. Till
Mr. Pollard, an eminent jurist, came to the
head of the committee, It was In no
way among the working committees of the House.
Boiler, in his bellicose way, can improve upon It, as
it comes to him from Mr. Pollard's hands, and
It is said he la in a temper not only
to revise and improve upon everybody else's
bills, but to exert the really great power of his
committee to introduce any measure to which
he may choose to give its sanction. Unaer
these circumstances it Is no wonder he
is so wonderfully complacent, and before a
month he may be even moving the refer
ence of bills to his committee for revision,
and playing tne aeuce generally, as if be, and not
Dawes, had been named tbe leader or the House.
There is in this selection the promise of great fun;
and the session promises to be as dramatic and as
funny as those whose suddenly Inspired hopes are
that it will prove naerol.
K very body believes, from what took place to-day,
that this Is to be indeed a rare Congress,'and even
the lowering skies and railing rain could not damp
the ardor either of the multitude near the skylights
or of tne legislative graces on the floors of the two
bouses.
The scene on the floor of the House for an hour
before the Speaker's gavel fell was a lively one.
Greetings between members, congratulations and
courtesies being freely exebanged. Specula
tions on the formation of the committees
were tbe principal topics of interest, quite
overshadowing the President's Message,
and vanons members received congratulations
upon their prospective positions. At twelve o'olock
the Speaker's hammer was heard, and Mr. Blaine,
in a few words, called toe House to order. The
chaplain prayed at length, giving the usual Instruc
tions to the Almighty and suggestions to members
in regard to their dotles as Christian legislators.
To the roll call most of the well known
voices responded, there being only about thirty
absentees?six from New Tork, three from Pennsyl
vania, one from Indiana, one from Louisiana, one
from Virginia, two from South Carolina, two from
Georgia, ono from Alabama, two from Tennessee,
two from Indiana, one from Illinois, one from
Missouri, one from Wisconsin, one from Nevada.
Mr. Sargent, of California, failed to pat In an ap
pearance, as did also Dan Voorheet, of Indiana,
and Mr. Scofleld, of Pennsylvania. Mr. Hooper, the
genial delegate from Utah, was a special object of
attention among his many fTlenda, and be received
tbe quiet jokes made at his expense wttn his usual
good nature during the call of the roll. The roll
tiidshed Mr. Chaffee, of Colorado, was the first to get
in a motion providing for the appointment
of a Territorial delegate en the Commit
tee on Territories. The usual course or
legislation soon began to flow in its accustomed
channels. Various bills?some new, others left
from the last congress?were offerod In order and
referred to the different committees. General Bat
ler called for 20,Su0 copies or the Treaty of Washing
ton to be printed. Mr. Beck, 01 Kentucky, offered a
resolution asking for information in regard to the
authority upon which the President acted in sus
pending tbe wnt of habeas corpus in fkmth Caro
lina, Mr. Dawes objecting, and it not being in order
to ask unanimous consent It was referred. Mr. Cot
.attciuited to get in aiesoiwion on Bout well's eyn
dicate. which was also referred. The announcement
of ihe committee waa received without visible
effect upou the nerves of members deeper than the
j surface ripples. Genera Butler and Mr. Dawes were
I observed In friendly chit-chat, but the cougratula
. Hons ceased as the interest in the committees died
away. Pennsylvania did not forget, however, that
Pennsylvania tariffs were slaughters 1.
A larger number of members were In their seats
than is usual upon the ooening day of Congress,
1 and the body wore a decided business air. The
reform accomplished in the ventilation of
the hall dur.ng tne recess Is a matter for
devout thanks. The seats of the members
' have been raised, and the floor regulators
which served for so long a time as solttoous lor
tobacco chewing Congressmen have been removed.
The ventilation and heat are now supplied through
the narrow openings left in each of the steps of
the raised platform, upon which are placed
the seats of the members. The new carpet, which
is neither gay nor gaudy, presents a fresh appear
ance, toning down the glided glaro of the walls and
, cc-liings, and the entire surroundings are decldeuly
au improvement over those or last year.
The humored Cabinet Chances? Attorn oy
(leiwral Akrrmae to Retire.
The rnmors that have recently been circulating
as to a personal disagreement In the Cabinet
have finally settled upon Attorney General
I Akerman as the offensive Minister. It is
, charged that the present bead of the Judl
' clal Department is quite self-opinionated,
! tenacious or tils own views and rather disagreeable
1 in considering those of others. Such traits have
made htm so uncomfortable a colleague that bis room
is considered more preferable thau bis company. The
special impulse to this expected change is, however,
declared to be a distinct difference of opinion on the
Ku Klux polio/, Mr. Axeman designing tnat it
shall be made more offensive than at present, an
, opinion with which the President does not seem to
agree. Who Mr. Akerman's successor is to be is not
known, and the change will not be made till after
the first report of the Department of justice Is sent
to Congress.
The Alakam Claims and the Gcusva Con
ference.
The complete statement of the American side of
the so-called Alabama Claims, as prepared by the
agents of tho United States for submission to
the Geneva Conference on the 17th inst.. Is
contained In eight octavo volumes, covering over
six thousaud printed pages- Seven of these
volumes are fiUed wltn the legal aspects of the
case as presented tn the diplomatic cor.
respondenoe, with a full history of the cap
ture, bonding or destruction of Ameri
can merchant vessels by Confederate pri
vateers, a complete and accurate account of the
building of the Alabama and other rebel cruisers,
with the terms and contracts nnder and npon which
they were built, equipped, manned, armed
and sent fortn to prey upon American
commerce without the lormality of visiting
a southern port to gain the semblance
of a national character, and with tho depositions in
mil oi over six hundred wltne-ses on behalf of the
American claimants. The eighth volume Is printed in
English and French, and the latter Is pronounced to
be a masterpiece ot lalihtal translation lroin
the English text, the proofs having been six times
corrected. It will probably be also translated from
the original Into the Portuguese tongue to enable the
Brazilian member of the Conference to gain the most
exact knowledge of the case upon which he is
to arbitrate, still another translation into German
is talked of, both as an act or courtesy to the Ger.
man Emperor, who was to have designated a mem
ber in the event of the Powers flnt named falling to
respond, and may yet have to make such designa
tion should a vacancy occur in the repre
sentation of Switzerland, Italy or Brazil.
The total amount of the claims is fie,021,
423 si. But it is expected that additional
claims not quite ready for submission w.li some
what increase the amount. The eighth volume just
referred to contains the brief of the American coun
sel. It opens with a citation of those points of the
Treaty of Washington and its protocols
that bear upon the subject or the
claims and tho modes and rales oi
their settlement. Next follows an exhaustive an
alysis of the case, with copious references to the
exhibits contained in the other seven volnmes.
Then comes a comprehensive digest of all the
known authorities favorable to the American posi
tion, drawn from every International source that the
counsel have been able to discover, and concluding
with the most forcible arguments that these authori
ties would bear to establish tneir applicability to
the points now to come up for adjudication. These
eight volumes were printed at the government
printtng office, and complete success was
gained on maintaining the required secrecy
while the work was In progress. The brief
of the counsel bos been confidentially
submitted to several eminent lawyers, whose opin
ions were known to be weighty, and whose judg
ment was believed to be Impartial, and they all
agree In pronouncing it to be not only an honor to
the legal profession of the country bnt Incontro
vertible as an argument m on the material points of
the case.
Revision of the Tariff and laternal Revenue
Lawn.
The Finance Committee of the Senate have ma
tared a programme revising tue tariff, and, it is
believed, the laternal revenue laws also, but only
for suggestion and conference with the new House
Committee of Ways ana Means.

Washington, Dec. 4, 1871.
The Senate met at noon, with nearly a fall attend
ance of Senators and well-filled galleries, notwith
standing the Inclemency of the weather.
NOTIFYING THE PRESIDENT.
The customary resolutions for the appointment of
committees to notify the House and tue President or
the United States of tue senate's readiness lor busi
ness were adopted.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO.
Several resolutions were introduced, among them
one by Mr. Morrill, (rep.) of Vt., directing an in
quiry as to the expediency or Immediately rebuild
ing public buildings m Chicago.
GENERAL TLB A SON TON APPEAL*.
Mr. Fenton, ?rep.) of ti. Y., asked leave to present
the petition of General Pleas on too, Doing, as be
stated, somewhat In the nature of an appeal from
tho action of the President in suspending film. Mr.
Fenton said be offered the petition by reqneat* with
out expressing opinion as to its merits.
Subsequently, on the suggestion that the matter
belonged to the secret session, he withdrew tue
petition.
CTVIL SERVICE REFORM.
Mr. Edmunds, (rep.) of vt., introduced a bill to re
store Gilbert Walker to the naval service, and in
connection with It a 0111 to reiorui the civil service
(Mr. Jtnckes' old bill). He reviewed briefly tho his
tory o* the attempts at civil service reform during
tne past few years, and said that although the com
mission appointed to draw up ruiea for the guid
ance of the Executive in making appointments in
the civil service was making satisfactory progress
and would undoubtedly lie aoie to bring abont suo
siaotial reforms under the existing administration,
yet. In view of the possibility of a change of admin
istration. it was desirable to guard by direct legisla
tion against a recurrence to the old system of re
moval and appointment.
BUHNER'S FINANCIAL SCHEME.
Mr. Sumner introduced the following mil to au
thorize compound interest notes as a substitute lor
legal tender notes:?
Motion l.-Be It enacted that Ibe Secretary of (be Treasury
It hereby authorised and directed to prepare for circulation
compound Internet note# equal In amount to the outstand
ing legal lender notea and fiactional currency of the Cnlisl
Btatea, and In all ret pert, atmilar to tbeee heretofore tanned
under tbe act approved March 8, I'**, en Hied -'An

That them notes of different deaomlntlons, to tbo
amount of f ie,OUO,uOO, shall ho dated on tbe em day of en oh
month, commencing with the fliel day of July nest ensulug,
when the amount shall be ready for Issue, and then after
ward, on the drat day of each month until the requisite
amount shall be furnished.
Ssc. 8. The notes thus provide I shall he raid ont for all
disbursements of the Treasury except those due In com, so
long as they aresnfllcleat for lbs [MiriNiac, and If tbe whole
monthly instalment Is net thus disposed of It (hall lie
Mm duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to exchange the
surplus for the present legal note* so far at practical le,
that the lull sum uf ten millions may ba put Into circulation
each month. . .
RBc. A?That H shall be the dnty of the Secretary of the
Treasury to cause the destruction of legal lenders each
month to an extant equal to the notes issued under this act.
Hnc. A- That tbe notes issued under this act shall, at Ibe
option of the holder, be convertible at the end of two years.
In sums of ilWi or Its multiple. Into bonds of the United
Stales, not having tea* thxii ten nor more than fortv years to
run, and bearing Interest at the rat* of tire p?r evnt, and the
Secretary of the TVaaturr i < hereby authorised to Issue such
bonds.
Sec, 0.?That whenever ibeio notes and the bon ?? into
which they but be converted cm he eetd at per Id gold the
bein In inch lume ae
Secretary of the Treasury may sell tbein
may be called for aud apply the proceeJe In cold to cancel
legal tender notes as they are paid into the Treasury.
Btc. 7.?That the notei Issued under this act shall eonstt
tnte no part of tbe legal currency reserre required by the
national banks.
Mr. Sumner?Compound Interest notes nave been
already tried, so that their operation is known. It
Is their pecuil.tr quality tbat at tbe tluie of Issue
tbev enter into tbe national currency aud become
part of tbe active circulation; but as tbe interest
accumulates tuey are gradually withdrawn and
| held as securities, so long as there is little appre
ciable accumulation or interest, these notes pass ,
Iroui baud to band as ordinary greenbacks; but this j
ceases with their increase in value. Now, if these
are made a substitute for greenbacks the currency 1
is gradually contracted, according to the laws of
trade, uutll It is ou a par with gold and we arrive at
specie payments. Until mis Is established tbe ,
nation is bankrupt, and its outstanding notes
are uo bettor than failed paper. Beyond
the stigma lumeted by this condition there Is
a derangement 01 affairs and consequent einbar- i
raMtuieut in commercial relations abroad. Our !
business is out of gear wun tbe business of tne
world, while at home a vicious speculation runs
not. fins lias beeu allowed to go on loo long.
During the war it cou'd uot have been prevented, I
but it should have ceased with tho war. The sus
pension 01 specie payments was a war measure, like
Hie suspension of Mm h&Ceas corpus or the droit, ,
au.l, like tnose. It snould have discontinued at ouce. I
I Bo long as it is allowed to pr. vail we nave a war ?
measure projected lute a period of peace, ana, as ?
such, It IS out of place aud out ot season. I am uot
inseuslbie to tho credit otxalned by a swift pay* j
, went of the national debt, but this is superficial i
, only. It does not enable us to refund i
1 our debt without extraordinary and abnormal of- |
fort. Let there be specie payments and the debt I
will refund itself, Tue payment of the national
debits a leather tu our cap; but instead ol taxing
? or r ?
the people lor the sake or tins feather I would re
duce taxes, and apply the irresistible energies or
tho government to make paper equal to com. llere
Is another equality before the law which 1 would es>

TUE HAUKAS C'OIM'VS QUESTION.
Mr. Blair, idem.) ol Mo., offered tne lollowing re.
solution: ?
Reso.ved, That tbe President of the United States bs and is
hereby requested to inform tne Senate uuder what provisions
ol the law of April 20, 18J1, If any, aud If not. under wtiat
law and by what antbority lie has caused the eousti.ution

To tiib Senate and Hoi.sk ok Representatives:-*
Id addressing my third annual Message to tlx*
law-making brunch of the government It Is gratify
ing to be able to state that during the past year,
success has generally attended the effort to oxecuta
all laws found upon the statute books. The policy,
has been not to Inquire Into the wisdom of tltff
laws already enacted, but to learn their
spirit aud intent, and to enforce them ao
cordingly. The past year has, under a
wise Irovldence, been one of general prosperity to
the nation. It has, however, been attended with
more than usual cnastlscmeut in the loss of Ilia
and property by storm and tire. These disasters
have served to call forth the best elemonis of
human nature In our country, and to de
velop a friendship for us on the part of
foreign nations which goes far towards alle
viating the distress occasioned by the calamities.
The benevolent who have so generously shared with
the victims of these niisloriunes will reap their re
ward In the consciousness of having performed a
noble act, and in receiving tne gratelul tbanks of
men, women and children, whose sufferings they
have relieved.
The relations of the United states with foreign
Powers continue lo be filendly. The year has been
cventlul in witnessing two great nations, speaking
one language and baving one ltnease, settling by
peaceful arbitration disputes of long standing and
liable at any time to brlug those nations Into
hostile conflict. An example has thus boen set
which, U snccesslul in lis final issue, may be fol
lowed by other civilized nations and lie finally tno
means of returning to productive industry millions
01 men now maintained to settle the disputes of
nations by the bayonet aud the broadsword.
THE TKBATT OP WASHINGTON.
1 transmit herewith a copy of treaty alluded laj
which has been concluded since the adjournment of
Congress, with tier Britannic Majesty, and a copy
of the protocols of the coherences or the Commis
sioners by whom It was negotiated. This treaty
provides methods for adjndioatlng the questions
pending between the two nations. Various questions
are to be adjusted by arbitration. 1 recommend
congress si an early day to niaee the necessary
provision for the Tribunal at Geneva and lor tho
several commissions on the part of the Untied .States
called for by the treaty, liis Majesty the King of
Italy, the Presideut of the Swiss Conference and His
Majesty tho Kmperor of Brazil have each consented,
on the Joint request of the two Towers, to name an
arbitrator for the Tribunal at Geneva. 1 have
caused my thanks to be suitably expressed
for the readiness with which the joint
request has been complied with by
the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and
learning to these Important positions. His Majesty
the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to com
ply with the joint wish of the two governments,
and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the
disputed water boundary between the United States
and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the
treaty have undertaken to regard us between them
selves certain principles of public law lor winch the
United States have contended irom the commence
ment of their history. They have also agreed to
bring these principles to the knowledge of the other
maritime Powers, and 10 invite them to accede to
them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of
the note by which the luvitatton is to be extended
to the other Power.
the Canadian fisufrifs and tub boundary
LINE.
I recommend the legislation necessary on the part
of the United Slates to bring into operation the arti
cles of the treaty relating to tno fisheries and to
the other matters touching the relations ol
the United States toward (he British North
American possesions, to become operative
as soon as Hie proper legislation shall be bad on the
part of Great Britain and Its possessions. It is mucn
to be desired that this legislation may become co
operative before the fishermen of the United States
begin to make tneir arrangements for the coming
season.
1 nave addressed a communication, of wnich a
copy Is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon tho govern
ments of those states respectively the necessary ac
tion on their part to carry into effect the object of
the article of the treaty which contemplates tne use
of the cuaala on either sido connected with the navi
gation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary
on terms of equity by (be Inhabitants of both coun
tries.
It is hoped that the Importance or the object and
the benefits to flow thereirom wilt ensure the speedy
approval and legislative sanction of the States con
cerned.
I renew the recommendation for an appropriation
for determining the true position of the forty-niuili
parallel of lattitude where It forms tne boundary
between the United State* and the British North
American possessions between the Lane of tho
Woods and the summlr or the Kocky Mount tins.
The eariy action of Congress on this recommenda
tion named would put It in the power of the War
Department to place a force m tho field during the
next summer.
PROTECTION To ORRMANS IN FRANCS.
The resumption of uipiomatio rolattons between
France and Germany have enabled me lo give
directions for the withdrawal of the protec
tion extended to Germans in France by tho
diplomatic and consular representatives of the Unit
ed stales in that country. It is just to add tnat tho
delictus duty of this protection lias been performed
by the Minister and Consul General at Paris and the
various Consuls In France under tne supervision of
the latter, with great kindness as well m
with prndence and tact. Their course has
received the commendation of the German govern
ment and baa wounded uo susceptibility of tin)
French.
OKRMANT, AUSTRIA AND llF.VflART.
The government of the Emperor of Germany con
tinues to manliest a friendly n-eiing towania tho
United states, and a uoslrc to harmonize with tho
moderate and just policy wldch tins government
maintains In Its relations with Asiatic Powers as
well A* with the South American republics. I have
given assuraifces thai the friendly feelings of toaj
