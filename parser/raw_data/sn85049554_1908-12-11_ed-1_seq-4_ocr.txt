DO YOU KNOW ONE?
The closing year has been one ex
Cremeiy profitable to tradesmen in tlie
middle west where the effects of the
panic vanished the moment the banks
resumed casli payments and the farm
ers found ready access to their bank
accounts. Indeed the .panic scarcely
ers had money" then, they sold corn at
75 cents later and hogs and cattle and
oats, at high prices and the cash ac
count grew. Generally speaking the
merchants of Iowa, close to 'the farms
and away from hard times, have en
I joyed the most prosperous and proflt
able year of their history.
In all these stocks of merchandise are
hundreds of articles, comfortable cloth
ing, dry goods and useful articles that
have been carried over—P. Ms. the shoe
I man would call them. Why not search
them out for the needy. Here in the
midst of prosperity there are many ill
clad children, pinched with cold, poorly
fed and needy. Why should not the Hnois
.merchandizers search their shelves
the charity that their .prosperity should
suggest?
Not only for the necessities but for
toys and pleasure makers. Hundreds of
toys in the stocks might -as well go to
the empty stockings as to be carried
over year after year. The Jewelers
might find many little things that have
been laid away and forgotten. Christ
mas is not all woolen stockings and new
caps. The empty stocking craves dolls,
knicknacks, sweets and the ephemera
of Christmas.
In Marshall town no little child
should waJfe up Christmas morriing to
an empty stocking. As a city of pros
perous people we should see that it
can not occur. Think of it, a little child
ead, hopeless, weeping on Christmas
morning when other children are

against the 'pane and the look of long

THE CLEANSING OF COUNCIL BLUFFS.
Some months, ago the newspapers ex
ploited the cleansing of Council Bluffs.
Gambling houses from which the city
lhad derived large revenue from time
immemorial, were closed. The state
laws and state officials had helped. A
new era had dawned. Council Bluffs
had ceased to be the paradise of the
bunco stieerer, the capper and the tin
horn. The ministry exulted. The sa
loons and their supporters were down
cast. No more would the western
stockmen flock In from South Omaha
with rolls big enough to choke a cow.
There was 35,000 of revenue, the
city's share of robbery and rake-off
gone glimmering, and the mulct and
other special taxes were likely to rise
or at any rate be strictly collected.
Still, they had hop£s.
The hope seems to have been fully
justified. Tales of bunco and confidence
games wherein operators turned the
trick for small fortunes come from
Council Bluffs. Yesterday a boy who
had earned a .winter stake corn husk
ing, lost it all in a Council Bluffs
gambling den, took laudanum and came
near accomplishing his suicidal pur
pose. The itinhorns waited awhile.
They always do when agitation is on
or the grand jury in session. But
the harvest time has come again to
the green fields of chance where lambs
gambo! to he shorn.
Council Bluffs as a center for gam
blers, bunco steerers, and their dia
mond thieving, burglarizing pals, has
become a by-word and a hissing in
Iowa. The city seems content with
its nefarious partnership. The state
is not, and the outfit should be chased
out and kept out, if in the power of the
commonwealth to accomplish it. Gov

The Creston Gazette made some
slighting remarks about the appoint
ment of H. E. Eaton as commissioner
of pharmacy, saying that he was em

commendation was that he at one time

should not be so hasty. There is prob

state for the position than Mr. Eaton,
the only state university man on the
board. As to his former alignment in
the party differences we have only to
say that the time has passed to bring

Eaton was a loyal republican in the re

detailed answer to recent publications
regarding the purchase of the Panama

was false, and his further declaration
that the United Staites did not pay
one cent of that money to any Ameri

News as giving the New York World
as its authority for the statement It
made.
Mr. Cromwell calls attention to the -^r
