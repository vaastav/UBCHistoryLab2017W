AN ANOMALOUS SITUATION
Why is Senator Stone, of Missouri, chairman of the
wfate foreign relations committee? Stone is a pacifist.
he is not a German sympathizer he has succeeded
admirably in disguising his real sentiments. He

obviously Senator Stone was not chosen for this
j^ition because he is a suitable man for the job under

A RICH MAN'S WAR?
(From Minneapolis Journal.)
A favorite saying with those who do
not think, or who do not think
straight,, is that tktys is a rich man's
war, that the capitalist is making
money out of the war, while the
workingman a'nd the farmer are
carrying the load. The saying was
originally "made in Germany" and
has been circulated with sinister in
tent by the German propaganda in
this country.. It has been repeated by
those Who t{o easily adopt the state
ments of others without investigation.
That there is not the slightest foun
dation for the assertion, any main may
readily demonstrate for himself in a
moment with a lead pencil and some
figures. Let us 1see:
A few years "ago, when a creditor
loaned thousand dollars to a farmer
on, mortgage security, it took a thou­

trying to avert wfcr, and lt closed its %yes to the facts

That Is but one incident. Thiers are scores of- Oth

active' lnthe United
States. Th6 Austrian flag has been used With the-con
s^nt of the Austrian -government on submarines en
gaged in unlawful warfare.V But lt is'not worth while
to try to recall incidents. Austria, whether willingly
or unwillingly, is the associate and ally of Germany.
She has. participated in the reprehensible, work of cS"n~
spiracy against .the Unltedr States. She has given'her
full adherence toi rae illegal methods of Germany. Her
soldlera are fighting side by side with those'of Germany
against the soldiers of our allies.
It has been evident-from th» beginning that waf
with Austria, would come of necessity as soon as the
United States had any considerable number pf men in
the field and'had begun .to take a^ really-active, part in
the war. The-'time has come for such a declaration
now, and, the president has made it clear that he is
ready to' recommend war with 'the other j^twb members
of the central alliance whenever that step is' called
POOR JIM/
Townley is at- his old trick of emitting prison./j*rob
ably^ he can't help it. When the poison glands are' at
work all the time there must"6e an outlet, and if the dis
charge is stopped for a time there is just that mu£h more
of which to be relieved later on. Just* now it is .the .Rus
sian' loan that provides a subject for Townley. Of course
he is a loyal American. He isi (Utterly opposed to Ger
many. He is in favor of the Vigorous prosecution of-the
war. He supports'the government.. He haiT said .so. But,
returning- to his former method of insinuation, .he sug
gests that inasmuch as the government has loaned mil
lions to'Russia with which to pay the M1I» of American
munitions makers, the government, might do a .little/for
the poor farmer.
But every demogague over-reaches himeelf,occaslonn
ally, and Townley mak^s himself ridiculous by citing the
alleged experiences of one Jim Larson, who is-said to
live near- Willmar, Mirin. Jim is having a hard 'time:
He is 'up against it. It is tru^—so he says—that he raised
some stuff this year.t He Murvested a little matter of
8,000 bti'shels of wheat and 11,000 bushels of flax. Those,
two crops should have been worth to him something like
$J?0,000. But Jim explains that "market conditions and
the necessity of paying his debts had swept everything
away from him. A feed shortage is taking his herds. All
Winter his family will go without meat or wheat unless he
gets aid." Isn't it awful. Jim must be about the same
kind of farmer that Townley is.
Does anybody believe a yarn of- that sort? Imagine
passing 'round the hat for the relief of farmers like Jim
who have harvested a $50,000 drop in'a single season/in
41 district not given to bonanza farming!
THE WAR AND PARTY POUTICS
The war has ltot ended political partisanship in the
United States, and there' are "indications that the party
spirit is to be quite active during the present session of
congress unless something is done to hold that spirit in
chQck.
,.The Democratic party received no mandate from the
people of the United States to conduct a war. President
Wilson was re-elected largely because "he kept us out
of war," and because he was expected to continue keeping
us out of war. The Democratic majority In each house
of congress is not due to any command which the people
have laid on the party to conduct the nation through
a war The wai- has come upon -us since the elections,
and the party which had been invested with power for
other purposes automatically^.took hold of the war.
So long aa one party assumes charge of the conduct
of the war that party will inevitably be held responsitile
.for all the mistakes of the war, and mistakes will be
many and for all the disasters, if disasters there* be. The
can. The Republicans' will &ust them, if they can
There should be som* way of decl^rivg a truce in
party politics during'the war. This is not.a party war
it is a national war. It should be possible for the presi
dent to select as his agents and advisers the ablest men
in the country, regardless of party, knowing that wfcfen
he did so he would not be promoting the fortunes of
either party but simply doing the best thing for the na
tion. There are in both parties men of statesmanlike'
qualities and men fitted for high executive positions.
Party affiliation should be no bar to the services of such
men, and It should' be possible for men to be chosen to
responsible positions without thought of the political ef
fect that such appointments would have. These things
should be possible, but apparently they are not.
sand bushels of the farmer's wheat
to. pay off the debt. The creditor could
take that thousand bushels of wheat
into the market and with Its proceeds
could bfly a thousand dollars' worth,
of merchandise of the same/relative
value.
Today the farmer takes but .five
hundred bushels of his wheat to pay
his thOusand-dollar loan, while the
creditor can buy only half as much
merchandise as before with" the thou
sand dollars realized1 from the wheat.
In short, -the resources of the creditor
have by the war conditions.,been re
duced one-half, while the resources
of the farmer have been increased
one-half-
Take jthe wage ctt the laborer. It
[has, roughly speaking, doubled in the
last few years. On the whole. It ha»
kept pace with the increasing cost of
merchandise. The workingman Is
probably living today on a better basis
thpn When he received half as much
wages., But the creditor can buy'only
half as much with what he has, be
cause his money has been'cut one
half in purchasing power.
The two classes that have^ehiefly
prospered by the war are the/farmers
Mid the workingmen. By pursuing
tne example of the thousand dollar
transaction into--larger-figures, it will

their money rapidly,

Bismarck, N. D., Dec. «.—Governor
Lynn J. Frazler has "remembered
Casey."
A certificate of the appointment of
Patrick M. Casey of Cass county, to be
a member of, the state board of con
trol was filed with Assistant Secretary
of State Wilder late' Monday evening
by Governor Frazier. Casey succeeds
S. Lewis, former chairman of the
board, whose resignation- took effect
December1. The new member's
term of office dates from December 1.
Patrick M. Casey was the only
league candidate for state office Who
fell by the wayside in the Townley
land'.slide one year ago. John Steen
bumped Pajtrlck by some several huh
dred votes. Pat ran on the democraty
1c ticket, and, though the league
printed up a lot of literature to show
voters just how to scratch Steen In
the republican column and jump over
into the democratic division and vote
for Casey, not a sufficient number of
leaguers "remembered Casey."
The governor however, has not for*
f-
Casey. Casey announced in
argo Monday that he- would be the
new member of the board, andthe
governor apparently reached the
luslon at about the same time.
Although th^ commission was filedrin
