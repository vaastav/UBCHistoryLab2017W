Vienna, December 10.—The Hun

lating the common affairs of the dual

common Hungarian delegation held a se
cret silting yesterday. Count An
drassy protested against the ex
planations of the foreign policy, given by
so-called semi-official organs. He said
another factor besides treaties should l)e
considered in connection with the rela
tions between European powers, namely
force, which alone could make treaties
valid. As to allegations concerning the
triple alliance, he said Austria was the
arbitrator of her own destinies;
no European state could more
securely count upon the recognition of its
reasonable and just demands. He de
clared himself strongly opposed to the
idea that in compliance with external
prejudices the Christian popula
tion of Turkey must be
continued under Turkish misrule.
He denied that Austria was acting under
the influence of Germany, and declared
that no power in Europe could under
take the settlement of the eastern ques
tion without the co-operation of Austro-
Hungary.

Proclamation to Persons Who Smoke.
In a proclamation addressed “ to the
smoking public,” by which we do not
understand that it is meant to l)e inti
mated that the public is just now in a i
smoking condition, but merely to con-1
nfie the address to those jersons who use
cigars, an association of cigar manufac- j
turers have made it pretty plain that a
good many of the cigars which are sold i
in the shops are chemically flavored
eounterfieiC, a good many others are un
wholesome, and a good many positively
nasty. As the buyer and smoker of
cigars is left in pleasing uncertainty as
to what cigars are properly to be avoid
ed as counterfeit, which are unwhole- i
some and which are nasty, the present
appears to be a particularly good time
for a general swearing of! - . Wise smokers
will abandon the use of cigars and adopt
the pipe instead, as the Scotchman re
fused to drink wine, preferring whisky—
the more, he said, because there is noth
ing against it in Scripture. Perhaps
still wiser smokers will abandon the habit
altogether, as one which is in itself un
cleanly and unwholesome. —JWtc York
