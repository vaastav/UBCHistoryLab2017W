CANAL NEUTRALITY.
The request of Col. Goethals, gov
ernor of the Panama canal zone, for
['two gun boats to be used in enforc
ling law at the canal, is a very im
japortant eplBode at this time.
jfi The talk and meetings for univer
Tyal peace were postponed in this coun
'Ify while the people were so busily
/engaged collecting boat loads of pro
visions and money for the Belgians,
land ship loads of Christmas presents
for the children of the war stricken
[.countries. Many of those ship loads
rof goods have been sent on their way,
land Just as congress convenes and the
I politicians and citizens could again
[take up the discussion of whether we
[should make the canal zone one of
strict neutrality and absolutely un
[fortified, the action of some English
poats have made that discussion
fibout impossible.
What will be the use of a lot of
jiternational agreements as to the
|anama canal zone if there is no way
j/o make nations live up to the agree
pment?
What good will it do to enact laws
if there is no power to enforce them?
I" How can a representative of our
nation be placed in a more embar
1 rassing position than is Col. Goethals?
Boats arrive and drop their anchor
or tie up to the wharves of the canal
zone and do as they please without
observing even the health regulations
when they arrive, or any of the usual
[requirements when they leavft. They
jspap their fingers at Col. Goethals in
command there, and he is helpless.
It is the irony of fate that in spite
of the fact that England raised the
Igreatest protest of any nation in re
gard to the exemption of canal tolls
tor the boats of the United States,
iuat her boats are the first ones com
plained of as to violations of the neu
,r rality of the canal zone. It was very
^largely due to the attitude of Eng
land that President Wilson repudiated
kjhis -utterances in his campaign
speeches regarding the canal zone, and
flso repudiated the democratic plat
form on the same proposition. It
Uems that England regards herself
Is the "favored nation" in the Pana
ma canal matter.
It is ridiculous to claim that the
-Jnglish commanders involved did not
Mcnow the international rules govern
ing such nations. They did know
what they were doing. But England
Is at war with other nations and it is
not going to let gome formality stand
in the way of winning.
Neither would the United States if
fit was at war.
When an individual is fighting for
•hiB life, he is going to save it if he can.
If, in his effort to do so he runs against
Rgome bystander and knocks him down,
\it will simply be reckoned by the one
Iwho is fighting as something that hap
Fpened in his effort to save himself.
Nations are composed of individuals.
This makes the nation depend upon
[iindividual efforts. Collective effort is
psimply the effort of a group of in
dividuals acting in unison. Different
Jjgroups are under the leadership and
(/direction of different men. Some men

that natioii will difTer as to whether
his action should or should not be en

people of that nation should decide
to endorse the action of the official,
even to the extent of enforcing its de
mands then such action might at any
tfne
result in war. If a large majority
of the nation condemned his action,
then the proper authorities would be

We cannot help but feel that ex

he said that there could be conditions
arise between nations which could not

I Furthermore, we feel that it is daily

lils necessary to keep battleships at

1 MAKING STRAW MEN.
5
President Wilson in his message,
and ex-President Taft in speeches
during the last two weeks, are not
lidding any to their prestige by set
ting up straw men of their own manu
facture and knocking them down.
They know that the people who are
advocating that the United States in
crease its military equipment, do not
want to make a military nation of this
country. They know that the demand
for more military training than we
now have and a larger standing army
than we now have, is not inspired by
any desire to make this a military
government in the sense that militar
ism is regarded in Germany or Rus
sia. They know that it is just the
same feeling that makes a man put
locks on the doors and windows of his
bouse. That ia all there is to it—just

Washington, D. C., Dec. 17.—Post
master General Burleson's annual re
port shows that he haB not abandoned
his scheme of forcing the clerks and
carriers in excess of eight hours in
one day without extra pay, providing
that the total of the week does not
exceed 48 hours. Nor he has given
up his plan of abolishing the immedi
ate repayment of the weekly day of
rest when employes are kept at work
seven days together. He also asks
that clerks above the 11,200 grade be
made to accept reductions in pay at
any time that the receipts of the of
fice fall off, as shown by the annual
report of revenues. He suggests that
promotions for the clerks drawing
from $800 to $1,200 be made only once
in two years, instead of annually, as
has always been the rule. Substitute
carriers, who in Chicago have been
shown to average about $25 per month,
he would have reduced in pay, for
the express reason that there is an
abundant supply of applicants seek
ing the work.
Thus far the house committee has
rejected or indicated its disapproval
of Burleson's policy, as set forth by
Assistant Postmaster General Roper.
It particularly vetoed his plan of let
ting out the rural delivery business at
contract. Some of the committeemen
took the position that the contract
"system would bring to Burleson's per
sonal and irresponsible control about
35,000, forming a polltic&l machine of
almost incalculable influence.
Iowa yielded 8,023 returns of per
sonal income tax, out of the total of
357,598 for the entire United States,
according to the annual report of the
commissioner of internal revenue, Of
the total for the state there werb 2,698
incomes between $2,500 and $3,333 2,
697 between $3,333 and $5,000 1,870
simply the ordinary precaution for
safety.
But President Wilson and ex-Presi
dent Taft, in order to make their
point, put up their own words on both
.sides of the question to do so. They
speak of those who simply want the
nation to be able to command respect,
as if those persons wanted the nation
to go into military business on a
wholesale scale.
The record of human history, as
far as nations are concerned, is one of
broken obligations on the part of na
tions. To a great extent the record
of human history is also the record
of war. There is no use to try to ignore
these facts. They cannot be ignored
in practice as much as we would all
like to do so.
WHO KNOWS?
A half dozen or more times heavy
firing has been heard in the North
sea. The telegraph reports have told
about the firing of big guns being
heard at different points in England.
But the British authorities have never
told what was the cause of but one
of these artillery outbreaks and that
was a submarine attack only five or
six miles from the coast. Js it pos
sible that England has lost many
more boats than the public knows
about? It is a fact that the English
authorities kept secret as long as they
could the news of the sinking of the
great battleship Audacious. The hold
ing back of that fact makes one won
der how many more such incidents
have been held back by the English
press censors. There is reason to
wonder just how many of England's
boats have been destroyed, but it is
evident that there are yet enough of
them around Heligoland to keep the
German navy behind the cover of the
forts there and in the Kiel canal.
Nevertheless if Germany keeps on
performing such feats as she did in
the case of the Audacious, how long
will England be able to hold Germany's
fleets in check?
A WORTHY PRISONER.
A prisoner in the Michigan peniten
tiary at Jackson, sent two dollars to
a charity Christmas fund in Detroit.
He says he wants the money to help
make some worthy little children
happy on Christmas day. He has two
little girls of his own. He asks noth
ing for them. But something should
be done by the people of Michigan for
them and when he gets out of prison,
something should likewise be done
for him, something that will put him
on his feet again and let him make a
new start in life.
One of the crying needs of this
country is an efficient organization
that will help a man as soon as he
comes from prison, after he has serv
ed his sentence. That is a time when
he needs help most but seldom gets
it.
BOOM IN COTTON MARKET.
Prospects for the southern cotton
planter are picking up very. much.
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin informs
the state department that there is
practically an unlimited market for
cotton in Germany, so that as many as
two million bales can be disposed of
in the empire in 1915. From Vienna
comes a report that 800,000 bales can
find a market in Austra-Hungary. Mr.
Gerard says the price of cotton in Ger
many ranges from 13 to 18 cents a
pound aftqr allowing two cents a
pound for insurance, freight and other
charges.
Ambassador Page at Rome has in
formed the state department that Italy
is in the market for cotton. Officials,
therefore, hope for a speedy restora
tion of the cotton trade to a normal
basis.
WOMEN STUDYING TARIFF.
The women who live in states
where women vote, are now studying
tariff matters. They realize that the
tariff will be the issue of the 1916 cam
paign, the beginning of which is only
aboui. a year ahead.. If Iowa women
are expecting any of their friends from
the suffrage states as visitors they had
better post up on the issue.

A new charitable society known as
thefc "Black Cross" is being formed.
Its contention is that Americans are
neglecting their own sufferers and
poor people to help the suffering Bel
gians. They contend that Germany,
having taken practically all the mon
ey of Belgium^ in the form of war
levies and fines, the task of feeding
the starving and penniless Belgians
therefore should fall upon the Ger
man authorities.
The people in this country who are
opposing immigration, must not for
get that the greatest commercial activ

yet for law abiding foreigners who
want to come and make this land their
home.

St. Louis Globe Democrat: The

quired a 10-cent tax on marriage cer
tificates. A dime does not look large
to a bridegroom until after the honey
moon.
Davenport Times: Iowa's share of
the value of the cattle killed to stamp
out the foot and mouth disease in the
state is about $30,000. This amount
will be asked of the legislature to pay
the claims. That's one appropriation
bill over which there should be no de
bate.
La Crosse Tribune: The railroads
in Kansas are asking for a rate in
crease on the ground that there are so
many automobiles in the state that
their passenger traffic is dwindling.
The railroads should worry so long as
the farmer doesn't take his hogs and
corn to market in the family limou
sine.
Des Moines Capital: The secret of
the successful Christian life will be
the degree of determination with
which the new convert listens to the
whisperings of the spirit which guides
unto all truth rather than to the voice
of the world, which is oftentimes a,
discordant and misleading voice—a
voice which can often flatter but is
powerless to comfort in the hour when
help is needed and sorrows come and
the gathering shadows admonish us
that the death angel is near at hand.

I believe further that the shadow of
starvation is hanging over all those
people and their armies. We have un
limited amounts of food. I believe
that the pressure of the necessities of
those people and their armies will be
so great that they will be tempted to

Peoria Star: Good news to hun
dreds of rural school teachers comes
in the decision of the circuit court in
Springfield that a teacher, at her dis
cretion, may punish a child for infrac
tion of the school rules. The ordinary
boy fears the rod more than he does
moral discipline. Willard Herin, a
school boy at Buffalo, was whipped by
his teacher, and his father sued her for
$2,000. The court decided that there
was no chance for legal action, no
matter how excessive the punishment.
Philadelphia Bulletin: Congress
man Charles C. Carlin of Virginia,
credited with being a personal as well
as party Mend of President Wilson,
expresses his belief to the New York
Herald that when the European war is
over "there will need be a revision of
the tariff, so that the millions of men
who are now in the armies and who
will then be released for employment
at any wage they can get, may not
dump cheap products on the American
market in competition with American
manufactures."
That is orthodox protection doctrine
to come from a democrat, whether or
not his personal acquaintance with
President Wilson counts for anything.
But it is the more interesting because
sentiment of that sort has been find
ing expression in democratic quarters
with suggestive frequency of late, in
dicating that the protection propa
ganda of Norman Mack is finding con
siderable response in the democratic
party.
'New York Post: Owners of British
tijamp steamships are. deriving great
profit from the war. Fof weeks past
fjreights have been rising not only
steadily., but sometimes rapidly, and
tney now are on a very much higher
level than when the war began. For
instance freights for grain from the
Plate have risen from 13s a ton to 29s
6d a ton, while freights from the Pa
cific coast of North America have ad
vanced from about 35s to 45s.
The rise is due largely to the ac
quisition of many vessels by the gov
ernment. Many of the finest British
liners have been converted into armed
merchant cruisers or have been em
ployed as troop ships some have
crossed the Atlantic packed with
horses many have been chartered for
the carriage of stores or to act as col
liers. British shipping has not only
been doing the bidding of the British
government, but it has been at the
service of the French and Russian
governments as well.

Chicago, Kansas City & Gulf highway
which passes through Ottumwa, has
just returned to his home after being
in different cities southwest of here
for the purpose of addressing several
gatherings on the questions of good
roads, which are live ones for him.
Mr. Carson went first to St. Joseph,
Mo., where he had been asked to ad
dress a meeting of the "Pike's Peak
Ocean to Ocean Highway," members,
with regard to the marked highway
and good road work in general. From
there he went to Kansas City where
he attended a rousing meeting of the
Chicago, Kansas City and Gulf High
wayassociation and presented proposi
tions for further development of this
route which passes through this city
and which has been discussed a num
ber of times at different meetings held
here and attended by Mr. Carson.
Mr. Carson states that the automo
bile club of Kansas City as well as the
chamber of commerce there are giving
this movement their heartiest cooper
ation and the secretary of the cham
ber of comerce said that it was the
next best thing to a steam railroad or
an interurban for Kansas City. The
Pike's Peak route meeting in St

from Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Mis

Number of British Recruits
Allies Now on the Offensive
London, Dec. 17.—The German naval raid on the east coast of
England has had the effect of stimulating recruiting in the British
Isles. The increase in the number of men joining the colors today is
attributed almost solely to this cause.
In the western arena of the war, especially in Flanders, the roles
of the contending armies would appear today to have been clearly re
versed. All the recent official communications Issued by both the
allies and the Germans, refer to the allied offensive from Ypres to
the sea. Consequently the Germans are on the defensive.
A British squardon Is still standing off the coast and has aided
the attack in the vicinity of Nleuport, but nowhere has marked pro
gress been noted. It may bo said, nevertheless, that the attempt
of the allies to push the Germans out of Belgium has definitely begun
and that the results so far recorded in Flanders have converted the
German line into a series of tenaciously held positions rather than a
straight front at many points, however, the aHied wings have been
driven In.
Russia claims to have checked for the moment the movement of
the Austrlans across the Carpathian passes shq contends also that
she has pushed the Germans further back towards the East Prus
sian frontier, at the northern extremity of the eastern front. West
of Warsaw, however, the Germans continue their advance.

The dates are December 21 to 25.
That the Ottumwa poultry exhibit Is

elsewhere in this section of the state
is evident from the fact that a number
of other cities In southeastern Iowa
have either given up the thought of a
show thiB year or postponed the exhibit
until later in the season. Richland will
not hold a show this year, nor will Os

Arrangements are being made for a

prizes but their surplus stock. Bggs for
hatching will be in demand.
It is expected that the fanciers from
all over this part of the state will ex

and will be given every courtesy. Judge

fancier 1b Judge Dagle,. who for years
has been one of the foremost breeders
of Buff Plymouth Rocks. These men
are competent and square and no
further recommendation would be
needed to assure those who enter their
birds at this show a fair decision and
a score as high as the individual bird
will merit.

possible that the clerical work can be

Beginning with this evening, all ofl
the stores in the business district will,
be open until 9:30 or 10 o'clock and
Ottumwans may have the opportunity
of shopping after supper In addition to
the advantages of the excellent display
and offerings of well known merchan

The stores will all be open now dur

their finest, the interiors present
boundless array of goods and tlje
streets themselves are timely in their
gay holiday'garbs with the pretty ever
greens jauntily lighted by the varl-col

festooned between the trees.
So pronounced has become the holi
day rush in the local retail establish
ments that it has been found necessary
to keep open at nights to give the Ot
tumwa people sufficient time to make
their selections. The heavy transient
business has made it difficult for the
stores to give the proper attention to
all of the patrons and It Is suggested by
some of the larger stores that Ot
tumwans shop early in the day or In
thq evening to get the best service. The
big rush of out of town shoppers In
Ottumwa begins in the forenoon and
continues until the afternoon is well
spent. Thus it will be seen that local
shoppers who' visit the stores early In
the morning or late in the day or even
ing will have better facilities for seeing
and purchasing their holiday goods.
