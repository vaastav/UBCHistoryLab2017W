HARDING'S ADDRESS
BROADCAST BY RADIO
Thousands In distant cities listened
in on President Harding's address to
congress, broadcast by radio through
the naval station at Anacostia, and
passed along through various relay
stations to a good part of the country.
It was the first time the new voice
amplifying device in the house of
representatives had been connected
up willi the wireless.
One of those who heard the address
without attending the Joint session
was Mrs. Harding, who had a special
receiving set installed in her sick
room at the White House.
It things keep on, the roads of the
United States can be paved witli used
homo brew bottlo caps and all of the
swamps and low places can be tilled
with the discarded "mash."
HARDING'S MESSAGE
President Harding in his annual
, message delivered to congress in per
son deals with nearly a score of sub
jects, chief among tliein prohibition,
turm ci edits, thetransportation prob
lem, child labor and immigration. The
evocative announces his purpose to
invite the governors of the states and
, territories to an early conference
with the federal executive authorities
I with a view to adopting definite poll
i cies of national and state co-operation
j In administering the prohibition laws.
He says the day is unlikely to come
when the prohibition amendment will
be repealed and that the nation
should adapt Its course accordingly.
Americans, while sympathizing with
Ktuopenn financial distress, are nat
urally curious to know how much Is
due to bad business management.

$9,000,000 For
Dry Enforcement
Far in ndvnnco of the usual tlmo,
the house Saturday passed the trcaH
ury appropriation hill, tho first of tho
big supply 'measures.
It carries $115,000,000, of which
$9,000,000 will bo for prohibition en
forcement. Tho measure was passed
without a record vote and virtually
without change, tho only material de
parture from tho commltteo recom
mendation being in tho elimination
of the appropriation for an under-sec-retnry
of tho treasury.
A provision of the bill authorizing
tho bureau of engraving to Install
power presses In order to reduce tho
number of plato printers resulted In a
three-hour parliamentary battle Sat
urday, but finally was approved.
A final effort by Representative
Tinkham, Republican, of Massachu
setts, to have the bill recommitted be
cause it did not require civil service
examination for prohibition enforce
ment officers was dofeatcd, Mr. Tink
ham and Representative Hill, Repub
lican, of Maryland standing alono in
support of It.

Tho demand for dressed poultry has

haTo reflected tho condition quickly,
somewhat lower prices prevailing.
Quito n targe surplus has been placed
in storage for sale later.
Tho United States Department of

Arrivals of live poultry at 'eastern
markets have been lighter following
Thanksgiving, but as quito a few cars
wero carried over from last week,
there has been a full supply available.
Deliveries of cream are about nor
mal for this soason of tho year, but
the market pendency has been high
er and this has been reflected In the
higher1 prices for butterfat through
out the producing sections. Consump
tion of butter is not as heavy as a
few weeks ago and any further de
crease in consumption or increase In
production would have a tendency to
make for lower prices.
The supply of fresh eggs continues
light. Considering the demand, prices
have re-acted a little from the high
point, and buyers are taking a more
conservative position, duo to pros
pects of some increase In production
throughout the west and southwest.

CAROLINA WAYS
What tho governor of Noith Caro
lina hald to tho governor of South
Carolina, touching cm an obsolete
hospitality, has long been history, but
probably will long remain as a color
ful story of the old south.
Tho governor of North Carolina,
however, has risen to tho occasion
again and In opening the Democratic
state campaign in tho Tarheel state
Mild:
"Wo authorized $50,000,000 for
roads. Tho people wero paying auto
mobile tax anyway. Wo Increased It
sotnu, not much; put 1 cent par gal
Ion on gauollue, and converted It all
into an interest paying fund, and in
Htend of rltteriug as It camo, trying
to build roads with it. wo aro soiling
the bonds and building tho linost sys
tem of highways in America. We
did not lucreabo tax on anybody to do
it except tho automobilo owners, und
on him little. We simply npplied
sound buslnoss principles to the situ
ation and behold tho magic-like con
struction of tho system."
To which tho Kllzabethtown News
has made the following - pertinent
comment:
This Is just the proposition which
was defeated In tho Kentucky legisla
ture last winter because It was drag
ged Into politics.
If North Carolina can carry and ar
range to pay a $50,000,000 bond issue
for roads by automobile taxes and a
tax on gasoline, so can Kentucky.
There are more automobiles in this
state than in the Old North Stato and
wo consume more gasoline. The. as
sessable wealth is greater In Ken
tucky and so Is tho population.
It was not made a political Isbiio in
North Carolina and It should not be
inoilo one In Kentucky. The News Is
heartily In favor of submitting the
bond issuo for roads to tho peoplo by
tho next legislature whether the Re
publican party or Democratic party
lias control of tho affairs of tho state.
Politics has boon tho bane of Ken
tucky and wo want nono of It In the
load proposition.
Until Kontucky takes over and
hpullds nil tho principal highways
and maintains them, which is provid
ed for in tho act. the counties cannot
build roads lending into thorn.
Tako Hardin county for instance
When tho Dixie highway is built
through tho county and tho Hards
town and Leitchfleld roads aro alno
constructed tho county's road .fund Is
to mouger that it is not bufflcient to
build turnplkos Into those roads.
When the state can tako over and
maintain this 100 miles of road then
the county can build roads loading
Into them.
Tho News trusts that tho bond Is
suo will be submitted to the peoplo
by the next legislature and If the
cost per inilo is properly limited and
proper safe guards aro placed around J
tho expenditure of the money wo
think tho peoplo will voto for it, as
wo are satisfied tho automobilo and
gasoline taxes will rettro the bonded
debt In thirty years and maintain tho
roads as the aro built.
North Carolina certainly sot a good
exnmple for Kentucky. Kdltorlul In

steps for
Jackson day dinners on or about Jan;
nary g throughout the United States
In order to promptly and properly
utilize tho frultst of the recent Dem
ocratic vjctory and to Initiate the
Democratic presidential campaign of
1924.
He also suggests that other Demo
cratic anniversaries and appropriate
occasions bd, utilized In the same way.
Chairman Hull had addressed a let
ter to Democratic national commit
teemen jnd state and county chair
men suggesting that Jackson day bo
made the ocasiou for gatherings of
Democrats in every section as means
of inspiring members of the party to
keep alive the eternal principles and
bound policies of the Democratic par
ty ahd 'to renew their activity for
tho restoration of that party to com
plete power in 1924.
He intends, so far as it lies in his
power, that the Democratic party in
the nation shall be a militant party,
und there can be no more appropriate
time to infuse tho spirit of militancy
Into party organizations everywhere
than on the birthday of the greatest
of the militant Democratic party
leaders.
Recognizing the great part played
by the press of the country in the re-'
cent campaign undor his national
leadership, Chairman Hull Is desirous
of the fullest co-'operatlon between
party leaders and the Democratic
press in making the greatest success
of the kind In tho history of the par
ty, He believes that the keynote of
victory in the 1921 campaign is a
united democracy. From the begin

voted much or his time rind ability to

element and fusing them into a har
monious whole. Tho results of tho
late election bear evidence of sound
ness and success of this organization
policy.
If tho plans of Chairman Hull for
the Jackson day dinners throughout
tho nation shall lie carried out in tho
manner In which they are conceived,
the leading Democrats of tho nation
as well as Democrats ot local promi

occasion, and with the aid of the
