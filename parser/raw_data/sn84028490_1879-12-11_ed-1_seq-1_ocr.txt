New York, Deo. 7. Repeated warnings by col
lision at sea with other vessels, and the danger ot
them with Icebergs, have led to the suggestion
that an electric light carried by steamships would
lessen the danger. The cost and bother of an

The Inmau Line have, however, decided to test
the use of the light, and will place one on the
bows of the City of Berlin on her next voyage
hence, which will be about Christmas time.
Bhould it be successful they will thus equip ev

T. DEWITT TALMAGE.
THE SPIRIT CHRIST ONE OF
GENTLENESS.
"Let Him That is Without Sin Cast the First
Stone."
Brooklyn, Dec, 7. There wu unusual Interest
felt In the services at the Tabernacle to day, for
several reasons. It was Communion Day, a large
number of new members were to be received, and
It was known that Dr. Talmage woulA announce
his decision In the matter of the Trustees of the
Tabernacle for withdrawal from tbe Presbytery
because of Its persecution of the pastor and his
people. After tbe opening services Dr, Talmage
replied to the petition of tbe Trustees in a few
sentences. He admitted the outrages complained
of were grievous and hard to bear, but expressed
his love for' and devotion to Presbyterianlsm,
advised delay, and expressed his willingness to
remain provided the persecution! cease. The
following wag the sermon In full:
SUBJECTâ€”DISPOSITION OF CHRIST.
TEXT-Pblllpplans li., 6: "Let this mind be in
you which was also In Christ Jesus."
There Is nothing more desirable than a pleasant
disposition. Without it we cannot be happy our
selves and we cannot make others happy, When
we feel that we have be n vexed an,d have lost
our temper, or have been Impatient' under-tome
light cross, we wake np to new appreciation of
proper equipoise of nature. We wUli that we had
been born with self balance. We envy the bear
ing of that man who Is never thrown into pertur
bation. We live under the feeling that as years
pass along our character will be mellowed and
ripened, and we will become more self controlla
ble, forgetful of the fact that an evil left In our
nature uneradlcatcd grows to more offensive pro
portions, and that a transgression not cast out
may become the grandfather of a great generation
of Iniquities. It Is possible to have oar disposi
tions all made over again. Because we do not
believe this our dispositions do not Improve. A
man says, "I am Irascible and I can't help it," or
"I am revengeful and I can't belp It," or "I am
Impulsive and I can't help It." You can belp it.
We may have our dispositions mado over again
evil uprooted, rlgr Implanted. If It is ever done
at all, my friends, It will be by having the dispo
sition of Jesus Christ set down In our nature. I
shall this morning discourse to you about the dis
position of the Lard Jesus.
In tbe first place, the spirit or Jesus was a spirit
or Ren Hon ess. I know that sometimes be made
wrathful utterances against the hypocrite and the
Pharisee, but for tbe most part His words and His
demeanor were gentle and loving and kind and
patient and Inoffensive and pleasant. When you
consider the faot that be had an omnipotence
with which he might have torn to pieces the as-
sailers or Hi! character, it makes His gentleness
seem more remarkable. Little children, who
always shy off from a rough man, rushed Into His
presence and clambered on Him until people had
to tell them to stand back. Invalids, so sore with
disease that they shuddered to have any one come
near them, asked Him to put His band on their
wounds. It was to very soothing. There was not
a mother, with to sick and delicate a babe, that
she was afraid to treat it In the Savior's arms.
His footstep was to gentle It would not wake up
the faintest slumber. Some rough people bustled
a bad woman Into bis presence and said, "De
nounce herl Blast heil Kill herl" Jasus looked
at her and then looked at the assailants, and said;
"Let him that is without alu cast the first stone."
When a blind man sat by the wayside making a
great ado became be had no vision, the people
told him to hush up that he was bothering the
Master; but ( hrlst came to wntie ne was anu sain
to him. "What wilt thou that I do unto thee?"
Gentleness of voice, gentleness ot bard, gentleness
of foot. We all admire it though we may not
have It. The rough monnlaln blui), the great
scarred Headland loves lo loos aown into ine
calm lake at its feet, the stormiest winter loves to
meree Into the sunshiny spring, and the moBt Im
nulslve and Dreclntate nature must be attracted
by the gentleness of Christ. Tbe calmness of hie
look shamed boisterous Gennesaret Into placidity.
How little of that gentleness you and I have. Let
us confess it. It is a tendency ol ouc door life to
stroke our dispositions tbe wrong way. i ne tnun
der of tbe world's scorn sours the milk of human
kindness. The treachery, tbe extortion, toe igno
blenesa of mean men take the emoothnor- s out of
our nature, and we become suspicious and hypo
critical, and stuck all over with nettles, and
frowns come to tbe brow, and harshness to the
voice, and blnntnees to the manners. Wbat an
utler and almost unlverssl lack of gentleness. So
that we do not know bow to talk to tbe sick, lo
Ihe troubled, nor care for the poor. We have our
words Of sympathy pitched on the wrong key. I
had a sister whose arm was put out of ioint. and
the neighbors came, and they seized bold of tbe
arm and pulled mightily and pulled until her
angulsn was great, out tne Done went not into tne
socket. After while a surgeon oame In and with
one touch it was all right. So we go down to our
Christian work with so rough a band and so un
kind and unsympathetic a nature that we miser
ably fail, while some gentle Christian soul comes
along and with one touch the ten llgamants are
healed and the disturbed bones are rejolnted. O,
tor something of the gentleness of Christ! There
is more power In such gentleness, than in a life
time of high pretention. The dew of one summer
night does more good than ten Carrlbeat whirl
winds. Still further: Tbe Spirit or Christ was a spirit
of sell sacrifice, No young man ever bad opening
before him brighter opportunities than opened
before Christ. If He had chosen to follow a
worldly ambition He might have gained fortunes
of wealth in the time He spent tending the s.ok,
With His power to attract men and ponulsilie
Himself. He might have gained any official posi
tion: No orator ever won snch plaudits he might
have won from sanhedrim and Synagogue and
vast assemblages on the seaside. No physician
ever acquired such a reputation for healing power
as Christ might have acquired If He bad per
formed bis wonderful cures in tbe presence or
the Roman aristocracy. I recite these things to
you to show what Paul meant when he said: "He
pleased not Himself," and to show you the splen
dor of His self sacrifice. No human power oould
have thrown Christ Into the manger if he had not
chosen to go there; no Sitanlo strength could
have lifted Christ onjthe cross if be bad not elect
ed himself to Ihe torture. To save our race from
the raspings and turmoils of Its guilt He faced the
sorrows of earth and Ihe woes of bell. All moth
erly, fatherly, brotherly, filial, self-sacrifice paling
Into nothing before this extreme of Divine gen
erosity. Suppose you, my bearer, by a straight
course of conduct could win a palace, while by
another conrseof conduct you might alvantage
your fellow men, but finally would have to come
to assassination which would yon choose tbe
palace or aseaasluatlon? Christ chose the latter.
Ob, bow little self sacrifice we have I Wbat la U?
Wby, It is taking from my comfort and add ngto
yours. It is walking a long Journey to save you
from fatigue. It Is lifting a heavy weight In order
that you may not be put to tbe strain. It Is the
substractlon of my ease and prosperity that there
maybe an addition to your ease and prosperity.
How little of that spirit any of us have I Two lit
tle ohlldren. on a cold day, were walking down
the street, the boy with hardly any garments at
all, and the girl In a coat that she bsd outgrown,
and tbe wind was so sharp she said, "Johnnie,
come under my coat." He said, "It is too short."
"Ob," she said, "It will stretch." But tbe eoat
would not stretch enough, so she took It off and
put it on the boy. That was self-sacrifice, There
was Christ taking off His robe for yon and me,
beggared for eternity without Him, When the
plague wu raging in Marseilles, and they were
dying by seores and hundreds from It, tbe College
of Surgeons decided that there must be a post'
mortem examination in order that they might
know how to meet and arrest that awful disease.
And there was silenoe in the College of Surgeons
till Dr. Onion rose and said: ' I know It it certain
death to dissect one of those bodies, but some
body must do It. and I shall. In the name of God
and humanity I will do the work." He went
home, made out his will, then went to tbe dissec
tion, and in twelve bours died. That was self
sacrifice that the world understands. Oh, the
more wonderful sacrifice of the Son of God. Hi
walked to Emmaus. Hewalked from Capernaum
to Bethany. Hewalked from Jerusalem to Cal
vary. Hnw far have you and I walked for
Christ? His bead ached, His back ached, His
heart ached for us How much have we aohed
for Him? Let us tbls morning look over all the
year of our life and see the paltry list of our self
sacrifices, Not one deed in my life or in your life
worthy tbe name,
Still further: TheHpIrl I of Christ was a spirit or
humility. The Lord of heaven and earth In the
garb of a rustic I Ho who poured all the waturs of
the earth out out of his hand bending over a woll
to beg of a Samaritan woman a drink! He who
spri-xt out the canopy of the heavens and set the
ears for Ills footstool, lodging with one rilmon, a
tanner I He whose chsrlot the winds are, walk
ing with sore feel! Jostled as though be were a
nobody I Purs'nod as though he wero a criminal
outlaw I Nicknamed I Struck at I Hnll out
Hashing the tempests, and yet sitting down with
out any assumption, in the cabin by the dlsclplss,
as though He bad done no more than wipe she
sweat from His brow lo His father'! carpenter
ibopl Taking foot of death off the heart of Lai
arus and breaking the shackles against the grave
month, and yet walking home with Mary and
Martha as thougt he were only a plain citisen of
Jerusalem going out to stay the night In the su
burban village of Bethany I Omnipotence under
a countryman's garb I Walking In common san
dals, seated with publicans and slanen-l Ob, the
hum'.llty or the Son of Ood I How little you and
I have of It. We gather a few more dollars than
other people have, or we get a little higher social
position than someone else has, and bow we strut
and want people to know Ibelr places, and
cry out, "Is sot tbls great Babylon that I have
built for tbe might of my majesty and tbe honor
of my kingdom?" Wotnd to God that we might
get something of the humility of Christ.
Still further: The Spirit of Christ was a spirit of
prayer. Prayer on tbe mountains; prayer in
Gethsemane; prayer on the lake; prayer among
theslck; prayer on tbe cross I Why, you cannot
mention the name ot Jesus without blng obliged
to think of prayer. - Prayer for little ohlldren: "I
thank Thee, Oh, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that Tboa but hidden these things from
the wise and prudent, and bast revealed tbem
unto babes," Prayer tor his friends: 'Father, I
will that tbey be with me where I am." Prayer
for his enemies: "Father, forgive tbem, they know
not wbat tbey do." Prayer lor all nations: "Thy
kingdom come," How little of that spirit you and
I have. How soou our knees get tired. Who Is
there that for len minutes can keep bis mind
away from the store, Ihe office and tbe shop, and
concentrate it In supplication? Wheie are the
vials full of odors which are the prayers of the
saiuu? Oh, we want more prayer In the house,
more prayer In the nursery, more prayer in the
parlor, more prayer in the social circle, more
prayer lu the Church mora prayer In the legisla
tive hail, more irayer among tbe young, more
prayer among the old. Lord, leach us how to
pray I We have not tested Its power yet, The
very moment when the Diet of Nuremberg were
signing ineeaiotinaigaveaenverance to tne trot
estants, that very moment Martin Luther was
kneeling dowu In his private room praying for
the accomplishment of the oblect. Without anv
communication between the dletol Nuremberg
and the room where Martin Luttaer was praying
fortbat grand accomplishment, Martin Luther
rose from his kness with a shoul, rushed out into
tne street, ana cneo: -we nave got the victory;
the Protei-tants are free I" That was prayer get
ting tbe answer straight from the throne. We
need to pray like Daniel with our face toward the
Holy uuy. we need to pray use tne BH.unan.sml
ting our htart. We need lo pray ll?.; 'il, "Oh,
wri-tched mau that. I am, wr-.Sj daiijer me?
We need to pray likeStephe inglntote)aven.
We need to prav like Cbrlnt. w.io first emntled all
the life-blood out of bis heart, and then filled that
heart with the sighs and the ufOanBand the wants
ana tne agoD les or an generations. ,
"Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witnessed the fervor of his prayer,"
Still further: The spirit of Christ was the
spirit oi work, mere was not a lazy moment in
all His life. Whether he was talking to the fish
ermen on the beach, or preaching to tbe sailors
on tbe deck, or addressing the rustics amid the
mountains, or spending the summer evoningln
the village, He was always busy. Shaving in the
carpenter's shop! Helping the lame man to
walk without a crutch I Curing tbe child's fits !
Providing rations for a hungry host I Always
busy He was. Tbe hardy men that pulled out
the net from Gennesaret full of floundering trea
sures; the shepherds who hunted np tbe grassy
plots for their flocks to nibble at; the shipwright
thumping away In tbe dockyards; the wine
makers of En-sedi, dipping up the Juice from tbe
vat and pouring It Into tbe goat skins none of
mese were nan so ousy as ne woose nanas ana
bead and heart were all full of the world's work.
From the day on which he stepped out from the
caravansary of Bethlehem to the day when He
set his oross in lis socket on the bloody mount, it
was work, work, work, all tbe way. II la not so
with us; not to with you; not so with me. We
want me ouraen to ne ngnt tr we are te carry it;
the church new soft if we are to sit in It: the work
easy if we are to perform It; the sphere brilliant If
we are to move in it: we religious service snort
if we are to survive it. On tbe way to heaven,
rock, us, fan ns, sing us to sleep, dandle on the
tips or your nugers, nana us up out or mis austy
world toward beaven on kid eloves and a silken
sunshade I Let the martyrs who waded tbe flood
and breasted the fire get out of the way while
this colony of tender footed Brooklyn Christians
come np to get their crown I Oh, for mo.-e of that
Detter spirit wntcn starts a man heavenward, de
termined to get there himself and to take every
body else with him. Busy in the private circle,
busy in tbe Sabbath -school, busy in church, busy
everywhere for God and Christ and beaven, O,
Christian toul, what bas Jesus done against thee
that thou hsat betrayed Him ? Who gave thee si
much riches that thou canst afford to despise the
rewards of the faithful? At tbls moment, when
all the armies of the earth, and beaven, and bell,
are plunging Into tbe conflict, bow can you de
sert the standard?
I have shown you that the spirit of Christ was
a spirit of gentleness, a spirit of self-sacrifice, a
spirit ol humility, a spirit of prayer, a spirit of
wora nve points, win you rememoer tnem ?
And are you ready for the tremendous conclusion
of the apostle: "If any man have not tbe spirit
ol Christ, he Is none of His." Overpowering
statement I Who can stand before it? Not I, not
you; a id yet this subject ought not to throw any
Christian Into a despairing mood. Thnngh we
are all well aware of tbe lact that we have not
these traits of character as Christ had them, yet I
think we have the seeds planted In our souls.and
the harvest after a while will come. Glory to
God, you have the blessed beginnings In your
nature, and, though you are painfully aware day
by day of your shortcomings, 11 Is your earnest
prayer: "Give me this spirit of Jesus!" Aim
high I I would not this morning say one dis
couraging word lo you. I really think you have
some of the favorable symptoms of a complete
and eternal recovery from this malady of sin.
Watch! Pray! Study! Compare I On toward
the prize I sheath not your sword till you have
gained tbe last victory 1 Higher and hiirhpr till
you reach the celestial bills I Crowns radiant
ana immortal tor all the victors, but eternal
death to every deserter I

In the hands of the people.
Ftsolml as the sense of tbe Senate, That such
agitation Is detrimental to tbe publio Interests,
calculated to unsettle values, confuse and dis
turb business, shake publio and private confi
dence, and thru It calls for Immediate and un
qualified condemnation.
Ketoived, That the true Interests of the country
require free and unlimited coinage of both gold
and sliver on conditions of exact equality, and
that It is the part of wise financial policy to
maintain tbe United Slates legal tender circula
tion comm- nly known as greenbacks In volumes
not less than now exists, and to preserve its ten
der quality unrestricted as to amount and unim
paired In legal effect. Ordered printed and laid
on the table, to be called up by Mr. Voorheos.
FINANCIAL DIFFERENCE AMONG
REPUBLICANS.
[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune]
, Washington, Deo. 5. Representative Kelfer, of
Ohio, who la a strong personal friend or President
Hayes, said to-day that the financial recommen
dations In tbe message would, If adopted, disrupt
the Republican party beyond all hopes of recov
ery, It was the most unfortunate advice ever
given in a Presldeut's message, "Mr, Sherman
has diminished his chances for the nomination
for the Presidency by at least 20 per cent." said
Mr. Kelfer "by asking Congress to take away from
greenbacks their legal tender character." If that
Issue bad been made lu Ohio this fall, Mr. Kelfer
'hlnks, tbe Republicans would bave lost by 10,000
votes, and Illinois would, on the same Issue, give
a Democratic majority of 50,000. When asked if
tbe barm done by the Administration was incura
ble, Mr. Kelfer replied that what had been sa!4
could not be recalled. Tbe mistake had been
made, tbe whole country has become aware of It,
and lis penalties must fall upon the headsof those
who made It. The Republican party Is safe, he
thinks, only so long as It ntterly disregards wbat
tbe President and Mr. Sherman advocated as the
policy for the Government to adopt.
Mr. Reed, of Maine, a representative of tbe ex
treme Eastern school, takes the opposite view.
Tbe country, he thinks, is really in great danger
from a threatened Inflation of the paper currency
No country has ever yet tried tbe experiment of
making paper legal tender without encountering
disaster at some ttage of It. If we escape it shall
be tbe only exception In a thousand years. Now,
he thought, a good time to retire that dangerous
element of our monetary system. "Frederick the
Great oarrled on a war in comparison with which
ours was a flee blte for four years without issuing
paper legal tenders. We let go of sound money at
tbe end of the first year. We have been fourteen
years In resuming. France resumed In seven."
He saya he feels ashamed whenever he compares
our country with France, that we, in spite of our
advantages, should have so llttlo Judgment. The
Greenbaukers in Maine had put to route the in
telligence and wealth-of the Republican party.
How, he could not say, Their orators were
tramps, Ignorant, ragged and dirty, aud Ihe peo
ple look upon them, as the prophets of old were
regarded, with fear. Mr. Reed is astonished that
the Republicans should not take this opportunity
of financial prosperity to get rid of the greenbacks.
HEIRS TO $200,000,000.
The Robinsons, of Ottawa, and other helm of
Hannah and Betsey Taylor claim 1,500 acres of
laud on whlcn a part of the olty of Philadelphia
la built, eleven square miles of land on the banks
of the Hudson river, a large tract or coal lands In
Pennsylvania, and scattered properties In New
York and elsewhere. The Canadian heirs value
the whole estate, Including the Philadelphia
property, at 1200,000,000. According to the Cana
dian story three generations ago the two married
daughters of Colonel William Baker settled near
Ottawa, and In 1801 inherited the property of tbetr
father, to whom his two brothers had bequeathed
their estates. The delay In claiming the estates
was due to the Ignorance of the daughters of their
father's death at the time of Its occurrence, and
their children's Ignorance that such an estate
waited for them. There are 30 clalmauta in Can
ada and Northern New York. There are 57 other
heirs at Brookville, O. These mnke out tbat Col
Jacob Baker died Intestate at the residence of bis
brother in Canada, leaving in possession of rela
tives his discharge from tbe army, uniform,
cocked hat and sword, all of which are still In
their possession, thoflgh tbe Csnadlans declare
that tbey know nothing about tbem, and that the
Colonel did not die there, nor did bis brother ever
gothere. There were several brotben, according
to the Ohio heirs.

HAYES AND SHERMAN RIDICULOUS.
LOUS.
Taking Back Their Own Financial Recommendations.
Washington, Deo. S.-It appears that the Presi
dent and Secretary Sherman have become alarmed
at tbe ex'ent of tbe opposition manifested by Re
publican member! of Congress toward their re
spective proposition! In regard to the retirement
of the legal tender notes and restrictions upon
stiver coinage, and that these twe hlgb officers are
laboring to Impress Congressmen with the Idea
that the utterances contained In tbe message and
the Treasury report on those sutjecti are mere
sentiment and not Intended as any indication of
policy on tbe part of tbe Administration.
Several members of Congress had interviews
with the President to-day In referende to the par
agraph of the message in which he says: "Tbe re
tirement from circulation or United States notes,
with tbe capacity or legal tender In private con
tracts, Is a step to be taken In our progress toward
a safe and stable enrrency, which should be ao
cepted as the policy and duty or the Government
and tbe interest and security of the people." Some
of these interviews were, at the request of the
President, with pronunced opponents of the doc
trine enunciated In the message, like Messrs. Fort
and Price.
Tbe President explained that he did not want
It understood among the Republicans that the
languape used lu the message In reference to the
retiren entof the greenbacks foreshadowed a set
tled fillcy on the part of the Executive In refer
ence to tbis question; that It wasemploysdslmply
togiro expression to his opinion, and that If the
Republicans should formally express their dis
approval of that opinion by passing the Fort reso
lution, be would not regard It as furnishing cause
for complaint on his part.
The President tacitly admitted at these
Interviews that he made a mistake-in virtually
recommending at this time the retirement of
United States notes, and as expressing the hope
that nothing would be done by the Republican
members to lead the country to believe that there
were (serious differences between himself and
tbem on this questiou.
Secretaiy Sherman Is represented as having
expressed himself In similar terms to those Re
publican members with whom he convened to
day, i-
This (homing conductor the President and
Secretary Sherman Is the subject of adverse criti
cism, and cannot tail to introduce confusien In
the counsels of tbe Republicans, and to assist in
perpetuating a system, which in the language of
the President, "Is without warrant In the Consti
tution and a violation of sound financial princi
ples." It should not be understood that the Pres
ident, in bis conversation of today, denied tbe
correctness of the piluclples set forth In his mes
sage touching the continuance of the circulation
of legal tender notes. On the contrary, he reiter
ated his convictions as therein expressed, but ex
plained that he had no opinion to expresses to
the exaet lime when the step should be taken
"In oui progress toward a safe and stable cur
rency." That was a question entirely for the de
cision of Congress, and should bis party friends
determine tbat the retirement of the legal lenders
would not be accepted as the policy and tbe duty
of tbe Government, he would wipe out his words
In the same way tbat Mr. Bland once threatened
to wine out tbe national debt with a sponge.
This Is not tbe language used by the President,
but it Is what bis languge Implies. The advocates
of the legal tender notes are, of sourse. greatly en -couraged
with the explanation of tbe President
and Secretary Sherman. They will not, however,
permit the Fort resolution to die, but will press It
to a vote at the earliest practicable day.
WHY ARE THEY NOT ENFORCED!
WHY ARE THEY NOT ENFORCED! A Congressman's Comment on Hayes's Treatment
of the Polygamy Laws.
Washington, Deo. 5. In referring the parts of
Mr. Hayes's message to appropriate committees in
the House, a question arose as to the proper dispo
sition or the parts or the document concerning
polygamy. The subject was sent to the Judiciary
Committee. Members or tbe House say that they
do not know wbat further can be done toward the
suppression of polygamy, "The most strlngeut
laws to pievent polygamy have been enacted. The
Supreme Court has decided that these laws are
constitutional. What more remains to be done?''
said a member to-day, "Mr. Hayes says that the
continued violation of these laws demands the
attention of every depaitment of the Government.
It appears to me that the legislative and Judicial
departments bave done all tbat lies In their power
to do. The laws to suppress polygamy are on the
statute books. If Mr. Hayes bas all the power at
bis back that be baa told about in bis veto mes
sage at the extra session why does he not use same
of It In Utah to enforce the lawt-?"
FOUR PERSONS KILLED BY A LOCOMOTIVE.
Harrison, O., Dec. 9. A shocking accident oc
curred this evening about 5:40 o'clock at Long
necker Station on the Whitewater Railroad, three
miles north of this place. It was tbat of the kill
ing of four persons and badly hurling a fifth by
a construction train bound south. George and
Martin Singer, brothers, In c- mpany with their
sister, Maggie Singer, Seter Nuse and Carrie Hur
ley were In an ordinary Bpring-waeon. and when
cror-slng t e railroad at Longnecker Station, the
venicte was struck Detween the wheels, tearing
the running gears to atoms, but did not damage
the bed but little. George, Martin and Maggie
Singer were killed outright, aop Nuse expired a
few minutes later. Tbe girl Hurley was found
lying under the platform at the station, somewhat
mangled and terribly frightened, but upon exam
lnatlou by Dr, West she was found not to be seri
ously hurt, and will recover.
DAVID CONVICTED.
Warren, O., Dec. 7.-The trial of Davis, the horse
thief, bas been one of tbe most Interesting In
orlmlnal court here. Davis, about whom so muuh
has been said In the papers, stole seven horses In
Hubbard last July and was chased, shot and ar
rested In Akron. The Jury valued the property
stolen at i'JOO In the first count and at 1400 in the
second. A verdict of guilty was found after a
retirement of only a few moments. Davis is no
stranger to the Penlteosiary, and will probably
get a heavy sentenfe.
