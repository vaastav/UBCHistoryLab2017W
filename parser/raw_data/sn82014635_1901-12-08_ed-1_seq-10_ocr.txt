OPINION IS
IN A TUMULT
IN OKLAHOMA'
Complex State of Feeling
Over Political Changes.
SORROW FOR JENKINS
And Endorsement of President
Found Side by Side.
Guthrie. O. T., Dec 7. If all the politl
cal campaigns of Oklahoma we"re "rolled
Into one at this moment, , the tumult of
public opinion would not equal what Jt is
today. ,
Resident Roosevelt's removal of Gov
ernor Jenkins, his manner of doing this
nnd the appointment of Thomas Fergu
son has caused a cyclone" of public and'
private utterances, whicn contradict, re-s-rfmHate,
and collide everywhere and
coincide nowhere. Xo definite line of
thought predominates, or continues long
enough to be followed to any conclusion.
An attempt t classify points brought out
Jn newspaper articles on the situation and
in street and office opinions results in
this:
1. Complete sorrow for Governor Jen
kins and an insistence that he did not
consciously do wrong.
2. Endorsement of the action of Pres
ident Roosevelt in removing Governor
Jonkins.
3. : Partial demand for a thorough in
vestigation of the sanitarium deal.
4. The most savage attacks in Demo
cratic newspapers on the new governor,
Tom Ferguson.
5. Enthusiastic praise by the Republi
can papers of the personal qualities of the
new governor.
fhder the first head hardly a newspa
per in the territory falls to .express sor
row for the deposed governor; the Demo
cratic papers are doing so in some in
stances for fancied political effect. The
Republican papers hold that Governor
Jenkins is entitled, to the fullest sym
1 Hlhy and that his mistake was thought
lfness of the appearance of segregated
Sanitarium stock.
Unc"er the second head none of the Re
publican papers say that President Roose
velt did wrong; mostly they ascribe to
him the determination to exact avoidance
of all appearance of evil from, federal
officials, a stand which is approved.
Under the third head comes a demand
from all th Democratic papers and some
of the Republican papers which have been
close to Govern6rlenklns, that the whole
Sanitarium dealfrom beginning to end
be -revealed. Carrying out this idea, re
ports that thegbvexnment has secret
special agents $rfrtl3e territory sifting the
matter to the bottom are referred to
with satisfaction.
Tender th fourth head comes the at
tack on the new governor by the Demo
cratic press. JCo such volume of abuse
has ever been poured out on a human
being in th territory. In his day Dele
gate Flynn has been assailed ferociously,
but the attack on Governor Ferguson sur
passes anything in Oklahoma's history.
His personal Integrity, or his honesty is
not assaulted. But he Is abused for he
sentiments he holds. His friendliness for
the negro provokes from the Democratic
' ;upers, the bitterest denunciation. One
reason for the attack is that he has al
ways been a man of most vigorous opin
ion and fearlessness in expressing himself
r nd has antagonized the Democratic party
In jill its tenets.
Tender the fifth head the Republican pa
pers unanimously approve of the new gov
ernor. Their expression s sincere testi
mony that be will make a capable gov-
raor; that his administration will be
free from scandal, will be able, and con-
Conjectures of the means by which the
present crisis was brought about In Wash
ington have practically ceased. The be
lief is growing that the act of the presi
dent's was hte own, purely and simply,
and that nothing could have stayed his
hand. Some of Mr. Jenkins' friends talk
i. ( conspiracy but no one can And a con
spiracy, if there was one. Judge Merrick
would know it, and it Is a well known fact
that Merrick acted practically alone In
the matter. No one doubts but that he
lias had a smrce of information for filing
the charges, but he wilt not say so.
One of tho most lucid explanations of
the-cafe of Governor Jenkins Is from
the pen of Jacob -Admire. He writes:
The outcome of the Gov. Jenkins' case
is deplorable. Any mas who--can -r-.
.loirc ami exult over it, either for per
sonal or political reasons, must have a
hard heart, indeed. Go ernor Jenkins was
putlty of a breach of official duty, the
gravity tvliicJi. dul'not seem Co.-tin-(Urstand.
There is no? evidence of in
tentional wrong doing, and no one, who
1' in a position to speak with authority,
has charged him with wilful and premed-
ii. ited dishonesty. It would even s.'em
t li ytt all the parties to the sanitarium
transaction regarded it- as legitimate,
T litre hns leen no effort, po far as the
public knows, to cover anything up in re
;tfbn ti it. and no one seems to have
been thuchtful enough to suggest to
Uoverm.r J. nkinsythat his course in hav
ing a portion b.the? capital stock of the
i rtetprise set apart,' subject to his order,
was improper. If "Mr. Jobes, who suc
c etied t Ui stock, had been one of the
; riginal stockholders; without the known
Intervention of Governor Jenkins in his
U&iif, winie rhbiSj would have becu,
w'.Mj gno.l T-.-son. some fault-finding, the
matter -aculil pfabably never have taken
mfih serious nirn as It did.
Anil had it ndV- been for a quar-rer1-
over another matter, even as
Jt wa. nothing; wu'id have prob
ably bn s.dd abeuc.it. The motive of
thflrattJik upon Governor Jenkins is not
indicative or the highest type of otis?n- j
ship. Ever since the facts in regard to '
the transuctioa rarft-e been known, few
men of i.uliiRtnce dojbted the re.--.ilt.

Mr. Jenkins slip In this instance to lack
of judgment generally or to downright
and wilful dishonesty. Neither is true.
Generally his career affords an emphatic
contradiction of the one, and the facts in
tho case will not tolerate the latter con
clusion. For, if his jmrpqse had been to
secure a fmarfcial, atfvtTntaEe b'y a pre
mediated act of dishonesty, nothing could
have been easier than to cover the matter
up beyond all ganger of discovery. The
whole affair simply discloses a cu
rious phaso of1 mrfral conception that is
not, at all. uncommon among much wiser
men than Mr. Jenkins. It is really a moral
eccentricity. Jenkins is of a peculiar and
eccentric make-up. His intentions are up
right, he believes in himself implicitly
and cannot understand why there should
tbe two opinions on this proposition. In
the sanitarium transaction, he saw vary
plainly, what seemed to be-a 'gdc-a thing.'
But there was no special reason for be
lieving that it was wicked because it was
substantially in Hne with the contract
which had heretofore existedbetween the
territory and the owner of t,he sanitarium
property. It did not occur to Mr. Jen
kins that .the territory was to suffer or
the Inmates of the asylum to be short pofc-
.ted either In their rations or otherwise
for the purpose of adding profit to the
stockholders. The property was esti
mated, to .bo worth fully fifty thousand
dollars with this contract Is said to have
cost more and the stockholders were buy
ing it for half that amount. Here was
a plain and direct profit to start with of
100 per. cent, and it was calculated that
the business of the sanitarium would pay
a handsome dividend on the face value of
the stock. The sanitarium is a private en
terprise, the property does not belong to
the state as is tho case usually, and it
is valuable only" so long as it can be prof
itably used for sanitarium purposes. . It
.was built in the first place, and the
contract was. awarded to.Dr? Threadgill,
not only for the purpose of caring for'the
unfortunate, but for the special purpose
"making money" for its owner. Based
upon experience, it was aemea to De
better and less expensive for the terri
tory tp make this contract with Dr.
Threadgill, tljaa to send our Insane into
distant states to "be cared for. By this
arrangement the territory would "make
money," as well as the owner of the San-
Itariuni. It ' was ' a "money-making"
scheme all around. 'Dr. Threadgill never
nosed as a nhllanthronisL Now. this is
the way Mr." Jenkins regarded this whole
matter. He saw a chance, as the saying
is, to kill two birds with one stone. He
explained that lib' firsrdesired to have
the chief ownersTiip 6f the 'asylum lodged
in the' hands' Vjf "men in whose integrlty
he had implicit confidence. C. S.' Jobes,
of Kansas, 'ex-bank examiner of that
state, who stands high, not only as a
public official, but as a business man,
was such a man as Mr. Jenkins desired
to have connected with the ownership
and management of the Sanitarium. In
addition to this fact, 'Mr. Jenkins was
under obligations' to Mr. Jobes for past
favors of a substantial character, and
was desirous of discharging this obliga
tion so far as he could. Here was a
chance, as before said, to kill two birds
with one stone. Mr. Jenkins did not re
alize that he himself was the third bird
in the transaction, whose political' and
official death would present one of the
most melancholy tragedies iq the history
of the country! He could not see any
moral difference between the appointment
of a capable man to- a profitable rifficeh
cott-lnmnnf nt an Ilhl1(1lf Intl flTl1 fHvSn!'!
him a profitable 'job of a wholly" differ
ent character for the same purpose.
But, there is a wide difference, and one
which -the law has always recognized and
insisted upon. Statutes have been on
acted in every state and territory of
the Union which forbid public officers
from profiting, directly or indirectly, from
contracts over which they exercise con
trol. The absence of such statutes would
open the doors to fraud, speculation and
jobbery, and the outrages even now per
petrated upon the public by subtle eva
sions of the law, would be Increased a
hundred fold. Mr. Jenkins did not -see
any wrong In the Sanitarium transaction,
and he does not now. His own conscience
being clear' of wrongful purpose, he does
not see how anyone could be so blind as
to not understand matters as he did. He
feels that he Is the ionqcent victim of an
unmerciful judgment. AVe pity him and
his family tram the bottom of our heart."
SIMMERING IT DOWN.
One Man Who Wanted the Sanitar
ium Deal Explained.
Guthrie, O. T., Dec 7. A great many
people in the territory are still misty on
the details of the Sanitarium deal, and
the Edmond Enterprise tries to supply a
general demand with the following:
One of our friends from out in the
black-jacks came in the other day and
asked us what all this fuss over the
governor business was about, and to
tell him in about a minute, as he wanted
to get back home. We told him we had
been reading three Oklahoma daily pa
pers and Brown's Observer for a month
past, and the tiling "was so mixed up that
we couldn't tell him tbe particulars inside
of several hours, and then we wonuldTiave
to make it a continued story and finish
it the next f5me he came to town. "H 1,"
the fellow replied. "Simmer er down and
give it to ub In next week's pttper," and
slam went the door and 'our searcher af
ter knowledge was gone. If n"e will Tead
on another page of the Enterprise he,
will find what President Roosevelt said
as he told Jenkins to go away back and
set down. As the Enterprise sizes up
the situation, there was a syndicate form
ed to buy tne insane asylum at Norman
and get the contract from the territory
for the care of the insane. They capital
ized the concern for double the amount
of the money they put up and told Gov
ernor Jenkins that he codi place $le,t300
worth of the stock for $5,000 (the same
proportion the rest were payirp if he
had any friend that he wanted interested.
Governor Je-rtkine thought favorably of it.
took the stwk and turned It over to C.
S. Jobe?. a frhno at Wichita. Kansas, for
SS.WO. Now, he-ousht'to have sold the
Stock for $10.00 and made S3.0. But it
is said he didn't, and a man wV.o wouldn t
do that is -not in a armory wi?h tV his
tory n( Oklahoma politics. Judging from
the history of- both political parties
since the organization of the territory.

THEY BROKE
OUT ALL ON
ONE NIGHT
Reign of Footpads in the City
of Pawpee.
WORK.
RIGHT AND. LEFT
Holding Up. Citizens and Even
Tackling an Officer,
Guthrie. O. T., Dec 7. The Pawnee
Times-Democrat reports a curious out
break in that city. It says: More highway
robberies and attempts at highway rob
bery occurred in .this city Wednesday
night than Pawnee has experienced since
the year of the opening, when such ex
ploits were not Infrequent. The footpads
wer three or more in number, and they
operated in groups and singly, beginning
shortly after dark. . They first stationed
themselves alongside the Round-Porter
Lumber company's yards, near the depot..
Three different persons were held up
there before 8 o'clock; Two of the pedes
trians who were robbed are employes of
the civil engineer's oilice and are connect
ed with the. Eastern Oklahoma extension
to Ralston. They .were robbed separate
ly, their aggregate losses amounting to
more than $30. The third victim, whose
identity Is not known, lost 20 cents.
"About 3 -o'clock a supposed member of
the original party of footpads" tried to
hold up S. J. Mcllaughlln, manager of the;
Pawnee Commission comparry, who rooms,
at his place of business on the north side!
of the -square The foodpad stopped Mr.
McLaughlin in front of Peter & Caldwell's,
implement store, flashed a revolver on
him and demanded his money. McLaugh
lin said he wag "broke" and passed on.
He was not further molested at this time.
Vanco Larmer, who rooms with Mr. Mc
Laughlin, entered the commission com
pany's place of business about midnight,
having been detained in the country on
business. He had no sooner locked the
front door Gian a man came and tried to
kick it open, at the same time demanding
admission. "When asked what he wanted
he repeated his demand for admission, and
said he was looking for a policeman. He
was told to look elsewhere, and soon went
away.
Doc. Patton, the ex-deputy sheriff, who
had been searching for the footpads dur
ing the evening, was the last man to be
molested. He was on his way home, be
tween 1 and 2 a. m., when three men, at
the alloy back of the hotel, at the north
east corner of the square, commanded him
to throw up his hands. When Patton's
right handr went up it contained a six-'
shopter, arid ho fired five shots at his
threatened! assailants, jvho fled up the
nlkiv.' An? immediate search was made
for tliem, l?ut they could not be found.
Tjie .iqcai ponce lorco is ouikiiik eeiy ei
forff to 'tret 5n thb track of the footpads,
and w.ill maintain, the- utmost vigilance ;
until rthey catoh tliem or the highwaymen
cease operations. In tho meantime it is
not a bad Idea for a man who has to be
out late at night to carry a weapon with
which to greet these desperadoes. If one
of the footpads gets killed the highway
robbery sport will lose much of its ap-1
parentpopularity. J
IS TANGLED PROPOSITION. I
Horace Speed Tells of the Difficulties
of Statehood.
- -GUtirie, O. T., -Dec. 7.--JJnited States At
torney Horace Speed returned yesterday
from Washingtpn, where he lias been for
somo time on'busIness pertaining to Ok
lahoma affairs. It was but a short time
after ho arrived in the city that the wait
ing room in his offices Was crowded with
people anxious to converse with the man
man who was in Washington. Outside of
"seeing people," Mr. Six xl had little time !
for anything else in a business way. To j
tile correspondent for the Eagle Mr. Speed j
gave out the following interview on tho j
situation at Washington in regard to j
statehood :
"In regard to statehood. Mr. Flyrm his
presented a bill in Congress, and exports i
a good statehood bill to bp passed b-fore. i
Congress adjourns m xt summer. The bill ,
is substantially like other bills introduced j
several times in former years. Th-se bills j
are based upon what the leading men in i
Congress have tohl rur peoplr- for the j
past It years must be in the bill in order j
to have It passed. Th re is r.o possibility
of getting a bill passtd for statehood f.,r
Oklahoma alone, without reference to In- j
dian Territory, and th. ro is no possibility 1
of cettlnjr through a "i:ll for statehood for i
Oklahoma and Tndi.in Territory over tho
protest of tne 'people in ihe Indian Terri
tory. And nt the present time a cor-sid-erable
part will unqurstlnnal ly object,
antl an attempt to force the passage of a
bfll against their objection would r-ult j
in their never being conttntfd or satisfied j
in statehood, and such a bill can not go
through. If a bill i6 passed this spring, as
now seems possible, statehood will not be
an accomplished fact for about two years.
A oill. to succeed, must provide that the
state lins shall include such parts of In
dian Territory as the peorie txpress in
some proper way their assent to be made
some part of the state.
"Air Flynn ia too experienced a man to
attempt the impossible, and his bill has
been carefully drafted along lines whieh j

Asked relative to charges having been

stated that he had had no Jntimationof
anything of tho kind.
BLAMES THE" ADVISERS. "
What James D. Maguire Thinks of
Jenkins' Affair.
Guthrie, O. T., Dec. 7.-James D. Ma
guire of Norman has been interviewed
on the situation by the Norman Trans
cript: . "What do I think of the removal of
Governor Jenkins?" said he, in answer to
a question by the reporter.
"Well, the president proved hfs reputa
tion for quick and decisive action, when
he was satisfied in his 'Own mind that a
change was necessary or desirable."
Mr. Maguire, do you think it possible
that a conspiracy existed, having for its
purpose tho removal of Governor Jenkins 2
That charge is frequently made, said the
reporter.
"There is, or could be. nothing In such a
charge," was the answer. "The president
distinctly stated that the removal was
dictated by Mr. Jenkins own letter, de
tailing his connection with the sanitarium
contract, and this would preclude all
possibility of a conspiracy. f'ho advised
or devised the change in the sanitarium
contract I do not know, nor Is It material
now. It is unfortunate for Mr. Jenkins
that he lacked the quality so requisite
in a successful public man that of pick
ing out good advisers; for" no man in a
high public position1, no matter how up
right his purposes, will fully discharge
his whole duty to the state and to him
self unless he possesses the tact, or the
talent, or whatever you may call it,1 of"
surrounding himself with good advisors.
Itvdqes not follow that good advisers
'sh6uld ie church deacons or lay readers,
elttfef; :"but men of -sound and cautious
"habits of thought."
What" Is your dplnlon of the new gover
nor, IMr. Maguire?
"He Is a(man of strong character and
positive convictions, and I predict for
him a successful administration. Ke has
counted the broncho, arid if anyone can
rido it, he's the man. I have known Tom
.Ferguson intimately for ten years, and
that acquaintance leads me to the above
conclusion. He is a strong, stalwart, hon
est, broad minded man; perhaps not as
courtly as Leslie Niblack and other dudes
would wish, but what we want is a man
not "a dude.' He is an Abraham Lincoln
sort of a man; one of the common people,
sturdy and true, with a big heart and a
"big brain. We love him for the enemies
he has made for those e.iemies are and
always have been the enemies of every
clean, honorable, upright man in the
Territory. The appointment is especially
pleasing to me because it is a recogni
tion of our delegate in congress and the
organization and republicanism they rep
resent. Mr. Ferguson will have the united
and hearty support of the Republican
party, for his appointment meets with it's
unanimous approval."
PECULARITiES OF THE CREEKS.
Immense Work is Expected of a
Baby's. Uncle.
Eufaula, O. T.i Dec 7. Now that the
land in the Creek Xafion are being open
ed to white settlement, the customs and
manners of this tribe are of interest.
Charles Gibson in an article in the Jour
nal, writes of their early "traits as follows.4
"The Creek people were a great "deal
like the negroes 3n the fallowing respoct,
they had lots of uncles and cousins. In
the old times the uncles and not the fath
er and mother were rulers of tho child
ren. The uncle came around maybe once
a month and made inquiries of the chil
dren's behavior in his absence. The
mother always gave a correct report good
or. bad. If gjpod all were happy. If bad,
then things began to look blue for kids.
The uncleten would go down Into .his
tobacco pouch which be always carried
on such trips and somewhere-in the con
fines of this. article was found the lower
or upper jaw of a small gar fish which
are always furnished with more or less
sharp teeth. The culprit was stripped of
his buckskin legglns and about a dozen
mark made on each calf of the leg. Then
maybe A couple of dozen marks on the
thighs which marks streamed with blood.
After which his arms wore treated in like
manner. Then the. uncle gave tho cul
prit a sound lecture for having misbe
haved, telling him that he would receive
the torture if the crime was repeated.
The little naughty girl was punished in
nearly the same wajvonly not so much.
"This way of ruling-'the children of the
Cre-eks was an "ld custom and was as
good or better than whipping them. After
a time the Creeks used the cambric need
bs of the whites for this purpose by shov
ing the needles just enough into a wild
goose or turky quill to enable them to i
penetrate the human hide and bring blood, j
i.ne oHi ur.ncs were worn to rii me nine
brats that the scratching would give th-m ,
nw blood and harden their muscles and !
make strong men and women of thc-m.
Very often the little feliows volunterd I
to take a scratching just for the gc-xl
that the old uncle told them it would do
for thir health. The marks f this cus
tom can be found on the bodies of lots of
the oldest Creeks today, although the cus
tom has been abandoned ny the Creeks
long since.
Another custom among the Creeks was
when a squaw left her husband and went
off with another buck the law was tor th?
nearest kin of Ihe discarded husband to
gather up and. as tne saying is. csrop- on
the trail of the runaways until caught
and use a lot of hickory withes on the two
wayward ones to the number of a hund-

part of the nose of hth raRWactorH was

Belief that "Jenkins Aspires
to Be Governor of State,
FRIENDS HOPE FOFi HIM
Holding That Public Sympathy
for Him is Profound.
Guthrie, O..T., .Dec. 7. It is believed
here- that Go ernor Jenkins from this
time on is an aspirant for the first gov

friends are talking of a vindication
through this channel. It is now believed
that by 139i Oklahoma will be a state, and
will have her owm election, at which state
officials will btf'Selected by the people.
Tho friends -df the deposed, governor be
lleve that the sympathy for Mr. Jenkins
throughout the territory is profound, ami
that it will endure. He has always been
more'er ltss prominent in politics, in Ok
lahoma as well as in Kansas, before he
came here. He has a Hklug if orvparty or
ganization, rarely misses' a cauou3 or pri
mary 'and never an -election, .arid- he will
be a lender in Kay county affairs.
i Knowing this, his-friends believe that
'by the time Oklahoma: becomes a state.
his aspiration will havo a peculiar hold on
the people; and that 1J he goes before the
public seeking a vindication, he will get It.
It1 is now frequently remarked -by lite
friends that the next ihlng to be striven

Jenkins has always had the guber-
inatorial ambition. When .he was first ap
pointed secretary he desired the govern

covernorship came along1, he took It read

HOW HE PILED IT UP.
Instance of the Progress of the Qkia
ma Farmers.
Enid. 0, T.r Deo. 7.-The people of, jHte
city are now well contented with tlui
share of prosperity that is being bs
stowed on them and this. Garfield, county.
The Eagle gives acase that is very re
markable and Is only one of many such"
cases In Oklahoma:
A case In point is that of Val John
son, of Hackberry township, who came
to the countjt. on the opening day with
one horse aW a cart. By -his individual
efforts Mr Johnson has cleared $15,000 io
eight years. He made homestead entry
on the northeast quarter of section-15,
township 21, range C As a rasult of two
years of good crops, he purchased tha
southeast quarter of the same section.
The land was improved with a fijoe or
chard, purchased of our homo nurseryjnan
J. A. Lopeman, fenced, and put In shape
for profitably raising stook. Two years'
ago Johnson purchased an SO-acre tract-
adjoining the half-section.
A week ago the half-section was sold
to Charles Stewart of Arqulse, Iiynois,
for ll.OftO good American dollars. There
is tlll left the SO-acre tract, worth $3,000.
besides 15 head of young mules, 30 head of
horses, 20 head of cattle, 1S60 bushels of
wheat and 40 fat hogs. In addition to the
saving, Johnson has paid $700 debts that
he owed when he came to this county.
He has also been out $1,000 In cash for
surgical operations for himself and his
wife, made necessary by a chronic dis
ease contracted before coming hero.

Sons Who Wander Away, Return and

Guthrie, O. T., Dec. 7. One evening last
week, when Mr. J. M. Hanes, of Noble,
returned home, says the Norman Trans
cript, he was treated to a pleasant sur
prise. His son, Sylvester, who left home
seven years ago, and from or of whom he
has not heard in all that time, greeted
I him. Ho had left a stripling of a boy.
j but returned a stalwart man, and one to
I be proud of. He was never more than 2!V)

came home well-to-do. wearing good

circumstances at Shawnee recently. .The
chemist stated, .that he found enpugh
poison in the stomach to kill ten men. He
also found poison in the small vial, of

The circumstantial evidence against the
