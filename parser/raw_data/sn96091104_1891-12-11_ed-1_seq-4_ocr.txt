the branches so as to restore the rest
destroyed by the root mutilations
that are always inseperable from re

moisture until the new rootlets can

by neglecting the proper cutting back,
thus leaving too much work for tht
crippled roots to accomplish.
The scarcity of food in Kussia Is
said to have prevented the sowing of
the full acreage of small grain during
the recent planting season. The
peasants, fearing famine, kept back
for food every thing that they possi
bly could. This will, of course, oper
ate against a full crop the coming sea
son, and to some extent again pre
vent Russia from becoming our com
petitor in the graiu markets of the
world.

the fleece has made a good growth
again, the lime will Injure the fiber
of the wool, i These facts should bt
made widely known, as we see cer

farmers to prepare for themselves

The dairy farmer who means to ex
tract the maximum profit from his
business should pla-e certain ideals
before bim and work steadily toward
them. Ooe of these euould be the
three hundred pound cow. li tne
cows were all up to this average, the
dairy would have to be managed very
oad indeed in order to fail to pay, aud
dairvmeu who have of this class are
not often bad managers. Another
im should be to keep a cow to each
acre. Then the land as well as the
cows will pay. This is not impossi
ble to attain, for 10 good acree well
farmed should produce quite enough
iiay, roots, ensilage, etc., to feed 10
good cows. Of course, some grain
ould need to be bought, but this
vt'ould pay because it would go to
making the land continually richer,
,mi an hi tn nroduce more. Ten
good cows upon 10 acres of land would
make a combination that should
afford a comfortable . sustenance to
any man, aua upon iuis uoi
would be enabled to conduct the
dairy business with a degree of satis
faction that is never reached by the
nan who keept a cow to five acres.
Intensive methods may be followed
in the dairy a well as anywhere else.
A move in the right direction, so
far as our agricultural colleges an
concerned, is that recently taken in
Minnesota, where a practical dairy
school is now In operation. Fifteen
thousand dollars were appropriated
for the purpose of preparlug a suit
able building in connection with the
University, and tne scnooi wiii w
conducted In such a manner as will
ive farmers' boys proper instruction
in the care of the heard and tbe
t of the home dairy, and
fo factory men instruction in the beet
methods of manufacture. Dairy
chools in other countries have beeu
proven of the very greatest practical
Hjuefit, and in Sweden e?pcially
have been the means of increasing
the quautity and value of the product
enorinouxly. We mention this mat
ter particularly because it is a good
-ign that our agricultural schools are
netting away from the purely theore
tical courts ana aowu w imui;i
methods of instruction. The theoreli
ial, techuifial aud scientific work ia
not of less value, only it must be in
co-ojertio!i, with practical appli na
tion in fuc ways as will serve to
bring the farmers in direct contact
with the ii.Htructors. A dairy school,
or aiiy other school in which the
work of the farm is actually per
formed, U of incalculable benefit in
affoiding a common ground on which
thv ran meet. Money expended in
this wav i well spent, aud appropria-
for such purposes win aiwajs
the hearty support of farmers
after they have onco seen the work
ines of such institution. A cae ii
point is the sugar expe iment Btatiou
or sugar manufacturers' school of
Loniiaua. This is so much appreci
ated by the planters of the State that
thv make it a noiut to see that it
never lacks for funds. If the appro
priations for any given period are
not sufficient to carry on the work to
the fullest extent, any lack is at once
made up by private subscription. It
is a practical institution, where prac
tice and science go hand in band.
Height of Cruelty.
Nervous women seldom receive the
sympathy they deserve. While of
ten the pictures of health, they are
constantly ailing. To withhold sym
pathy from these unfortuuates is the
height of cruelty. They have a w ak
heart, causing shortness of breath,
fluttering pain in side, weak and hun
gry spell, and finally swelling of
ankles, oppression, choking, smoth
ering and dropsy. Dr. Miles' New

One of the least variable of farm
products, so far as price from year to
year is concerned, is standard cream
ery butter This may be'seeu by com
paring quotations of about the same
date. For four years past Jat Elgin,
Otjtober 8, 1888, butter sold at 24 cents.
October 7, 1889, at 25 cents; October
18f0, at 24 cents; October 5, 1891, at
28W cents. This shows that one
may have a tolerably certain basis
uion which tA figure, in going into
the dairy business, It they manufac
ture a good grade of creamery butter.
There is perhaps no other product of
the farm which has fluctuated bo lit
tie In price or upon which we can
calculate the price for a year ahead
with any degree of certainty. If we
could now - eliminate tne uncertain
element of cost of production we cou Id
have at least one branch of agricul
ture upon as firm and business-like a
foundation as Is any manufacture in
the country. We wish the same uni
formity of price could be brought to
apply to the product of the private
dairy. Perhaps It will In time-when

An old man stumbled and fell near
the corner of Church and High streets
oue afternoon last week. He was
bruised by the fall, and tbe blood
dripping from bis face feli on the
tattered sleeve be painfully placed
under his head. He was unable to
get up. He was too old and weary
and week. Strong men gathered
urnunil bim and then passed on.
Other strong men and healthy men
and tall men came and stood by, gaz
iog idly at the prostrate form. Sev
eral ladies at a respectable distance
asked if the man was drunk. Notone
hand was lowered to lift the bleeding
head, not a voice asked his name, not
an eye expressed sympathy. , The
man lay still a moment and then
made a motion to rise he did raise
to arm's length, almost to a sitting
posture. His hands slipped and he
fell back to the pavement. Thecrowd
surged along the pavement. A young
mau with scarcely more than the
uiolesceut down of early youth upon
his cheeks approached. He walked
faster as he neared the bleeding man.
He kneeled, spoke a few words and
helped the stranger to his feet. He
looked abound for assistance. The
otronar men had gone with the crowd.
He wiped the blood away with his
own kercheif aud the two slowly
disappeared down the strett, age lean

in a hurrv of hurrying faster to

but without success or hope of iraccesa.
"United we stand; divided we fall,
was the shibboleth of the : Tennesseean
supporters. They felt that, they held
the balance of power, and the key to the
situation. Springer's support was . re
duced to a dozen on the twenty-fourth
ballot by the desertion of McClellan of
Indiana, who voted , for Crisp. The
twenty-fourh ballot stood Crisp, 101;
Mills, o;. ICJULUaa. iv; Byruivir, ,
Stevens, 1. - ' "
Repeated assaults on the solid McMil
lin column resulted in another confer
ence of the nineteen, and it was again
decided that there should be no deser
tions. ...
Three more ballots were taken witn
out changing a single vote. A motion
to take a recess was made, just after the
ending of the twenty-sixth, by a Springer
man, but it was withdrawn before being
put to a v te. A conference between
the Springer and McMillin men failed of
materializing results, and it became
obvious that nothing could be done. A
conference . betwen the leaders of the
four factions was then held, and a de
cision reached that a recess should be
taken. Accordingly Mr. Durburrow, a
6upporterof Springer, movea tnat an
ninnrnment betaken until 8 o clock
and this was agreed to without opposi
tion. . . ' ' '''
Much active proselyting was done by
the lieutenants of Mills and Crisp during
the recess from 6 to 8 o'clock. The
Springer men held a conference in a
committee room. Mr. Springer was not
present. The result of this conference
was shown on the twenty-eighth ballot,
the first taken after the beginning of the
evening session, when four of the Spring
er men deserted his ranks. Many earn
est conferences endeavored to make a
break in the McMillin ranks, but they
wereunsuo. ssful. The utmost excite
ment prevailed, and rumors that Spring
er and McMillin had formed a combina
ir.T, nroro HronlatedL No auorum was
nreaent when the caucus was called
order, and a recess of fifteen minutes was
At the expiration of fifteen minutes a
quorum appeared and the call of names
was proceeded with. The result of the
nnfre-nfe of the Swincrer men made
itself plain by the desertion of Springer
by Babbitt and Miller, of Wisconsin,
who went to Mills, and Durburrow, who
voted for Crisp. Capehart, of West
Virginia, was prevented from attending
the caucus by illness. The vote on the
twenty-eighth ballot stood: Crisp, 103;

one change Stahlnecker, of New York,
deserting Mills for Crisp, and so that
vote stood: Crisp.- 104; Mills, M;
Springer, 8; McMillin, 18; Stevens, 1.
The most exciting, incident of the ex
citing day happened then. Before the
calling of the roll on the thirtieth ballot
was begun Mr. McMillin, after a hasty
consul tuation with some of his adher
ents, entered the chamber of the house
and announced his withdrawal from the
contest. The announcement came like
a thunderbolt from a clear sky-, and for
a moment the members - present were
taken aback. - Mr.' McMilfm made his
announcement in a speech of about fiye

of congratulation that were
wild uproar or voices. -
When the last name had - been
jailed, it was found that Crisp had 1 13
votes lacking one of nomination. Be
fore the result of the ballot was an
nounced, Mr. Springer, who had been
waiting in the lobby, entered the caucus
and called out to Chairman Hohnan?
"I desire to have my. name called. "
This was the signal for an outburst of
applause, and when the clerk had called
Mr. Springer's name and he had respond
ed: "I vote for Mr. Charles F. Crisp,"
the Crisp men broke loose in one wild
unrestrained yell. They mounted desks
and chairs, and yelled at the top of their
voices. Books, handkerchiefs and
pieces of paper were thrown into the
air, and for a few minutes pandemonium
reigned supreme. Crisp men hugged
each other in joy and shouted out words
Out in the ante-room of the committee
on appropriations, where Judge Crisp
was sitting surrounded by supporters
who were not members, the news was
brought with the shouts of the crowd
outside the lobby door. Cheer after
cheer went up from the crowd, and it
was taken up by those inside the Crisp
headquarters. Judge Crisp took the
news of his election quietly. The with
drawal of Mr. Springer caused some
change in the vote that was about to be
announced. Four of Mr. Springer's sup
porters Bryan, of Nebraska; Snow, of
Illinois, and Martin and Patton, of In
diana allowed their names to stand re
corded in favor of Mr. Springer, but
Messrs. Busey and Steward, of Illinois,
and Holnian, of Indiana, voted for
Crisp. The vote was then announced:
Crisp, 119; Mills, 103; Springer, 4;
Stevens, 1.
On motion of Mr. J. D. C. Brown, of
Indiana, the nomination of Mr. Crisp
was made unanimous.
Ex-Congressman Kerr, of Pennsyl
vania, was placed in nomination for
clerk. There were no other candidates
named and he was. nominated by accla
mation. The remainder of the ticket
agreed upon is as follows:

The silver question in various shapes
was pending when the Fifty-first con
gress . terminated and there was an in
vestigation into the workings of the Mc
Kinley tariff act in progress by a com
mittee of the senate. Should the result
of that investigation be actively brought
to the front it might precipitate a tana
debate in the senate. There is a dispo
sition, however, on the part of leading
senators of both parties to leave the
initiative tariff matter to the house
where it belongs and not to force the
fighting in the senate on any issues
which will enter into the presidential
contest of 18S4?..
Senators believe that a very large in
terest of the coming session will be cen
tered in the executive sessions. Inter
esting information is expected in regard
tx rriT relations with Chili. If in the
time that has gone by or at the present
time our relations witn tnai country

endangered or which still endangers

senate either by public message or by

Tnfnrmarini will nndoubtedlv be laid
before the senate as to the proposed
arbitration of the Behring sea question
rit, rinuit P.ritain. The correspondence
nn this subiect. when the senate last
heard of it, had reached a stage whe
aat Britain Tirooosed to limit arbitrs
tion to the question of what rights Great
Britain had conceded to Russia in the
Behring sea before the purchase of
Alaska bv the United States, and to
limit United States authority over
Ttahrinsr sea by the decision thus to be
orrivAd at. To this the United States re-
nlied that such a form of submission
nrnTii. nnt. Vm calculated to assure a con
elusion satisfactory to either party, and
proposed, instead,., six points of arbitra-
3TBs'rHf What exclusive jurisdiction as
to seal fishery did Russia exercise before

: Second How far did Great Britain
acquiesce? .,',.'
Third Was Behring sea included in
the phrase ''Pacific ocean" used in treaty
of 123J , ' '
Fourth Did not all Russia's rights pass
to tbe United States? s
Fifth What are now the rights of the
United States in the seal . fisheries out
side the three-mile limit T
, Sixth What International regulations
are necessary fer a closed season ? ,
The senate will probably be informed
to what extent Great Britain has agreed
to submit th e questions to arbitration.
This is expected to be done in a special
mAsaaire. .
Jn the matter of confirming appoint?
ments the executive sessions of the sen
ate are likely to be important. The
names of nine new circuit judges of ap
peals, two interstate commerce commis
sioners and a secretary of war will prob
ably be among the first nominations sent
in.
Changes in the personnel of the senate
will necessitate a complete reorganiza
tion of the senate committees. Senators
Edmundsj Evarts, Ingalls, Payne, and
others who have hitherto borne a large
share of the committee work, have left
their places to be filled by others.
The element of new membership will
play a still more important part m the
organization of the house. Of the 235
Democratic members entitled to enter
into the organization of the house, 105
have never before occupied a seat in
congress. : Nearly every state in the
union is represented on this list of new
members. . ,
When to these are added twenty-eight
new Republican members and eight
Farmftrsr Alliance men it will be seen
that the speaker will have a herculean
task before him in ascertaining as far
as possible the preference of 141 new
members who know , nothing about
fommittee work and making assign
ment that will be satisfactory to all of
them. It is not in the least likely that
the committees can be arranged and the
house be organized for legislative busi
ness nntil after the Christinas holidays.
On whatever basis the house commit
tees may be eventually organized it is
reasonably certain from official pro
nrmncrments already made by all the
nartv chiefs, that the five or six com'
mittees which share with the committee
on appropriation the control of the ex
penditures will be organized witn a
view to cnttincr down the appropriations
