President Has Fight on Hand
Over the Japanese Question
Our Delegation at Washington
Stirred to Resentful Mood
"WASHINGTON, Dec 4. — That part of
the President's message dealing with
the Japanese question aroused the
greatest interest of the members of the
CrJifornia delegation in Congress and
ca-need a. feeling of displeasure, to say
tb« least, among them all. There is no
difference of opinion in the delegation
:*STardlng the sentiments expressed by
the President. All the California rep
resentatives united in their denuncia
tion of the position taken by the ex
ecutive. They were especially resent
ful of that paragraph in the message
In which the President suggests the
ti« of the military forces of the Gov
ernment In enforcing the rights of
aliens.
It is probable that the delegation will
soon hold & conference for the purpose
«f determining- their future course of
action in this matter In case the ques
tion comes squarely before Congress.
All members of the delegation expressed
practically the same sentiments in their
comments on this part of the Pres
ident's message, although ihey were
careful to tone down their remarks for
publication.
Senator Perkins said:
I agree with the President in the ab
stract. A treaty is the supreme law of
the land. Neither California nor any
citizen of the State has violated in let
ter or In spirit our treaty with Japan.
I am opposed to the naturalization of
the Japanese. There will be no war or
serious trouble over this matter, which
the people of California are amply able
to work out and adjust to the satisfac
tion of all concerned.
SMITH IS IXDICXAVT.
Representative Smith said:
It would be difficult to imagine a
document in which the language was
tnore offensive to a portion of the coun
try than this message in its treatment
of California's attitude toward the Jap
anese. TVhen a few aliens in birth and
blood are segregated and put in sepa
rate schools we are told that it is "the
sure mark of a low civilization, a low
morality" and that it is "most discred
itable to us as a people." To treat the
Japanese no worse than we treat those
having a trace of negro blood is to ex
hibit a "most unworthy feeling," and
such an act Is a "wicked absurdity" and
a "confession of Inferiority in our civ
ilization// The recommendation that
Congress pass an act "specifically pro
viding for the naturalization of Japa
nese" is wholly gratuitous. •
Representative McKinlay said:
The feeling against the Japanese in
California will, not be allayed by the
President's message, and should any
display of force be made it would only
aggravate the situation.
Representative Hayes said:
The California delegation will cer
tainly oppose with all their -vigor any
bill providing for the naturalization of
the Japanese. -The people of California
have not violated anj' provision of the
treaty and have not subjected them
selves to any threat of the use of the
military forces of the Government in
enforcing that treaty.
Representatives Kahn and Knowland
expressed similar views on the ques
tion.
London Finds Much in the
Message to Approve
LONDON," Dec. s."— President Roose
velt's message to the American Con
gress otcuples the most prominent
place in the leading newspapers this
morning and has attracted widespread
attention from , Government officials,
diplomats and the public The pre
vailing tone of t|he comment Is favor
a.ble. The newspapers emphasize the
President* 8 warning of a possible use
of the Federal forces for the protection
of Japanese.. This feature of the mes
sage has given especial satisfaction in
official Japanese, quarters, where it Is
pointed out that Japan is satisfied to
await outcome of the issue between
the State and the Federal authorities.
The Telegraph says the -President
speaks out resolutely and fearlessly.

knowing that the democracy likes a
man who is not afraid to be its master.
The Standard says the most signifi
cant feature of the message is that the
President Is constantly finding himself
"up against" the American constitution.
Far-sighted observers have long since
seen that the United States has out
grown Its cradle, yet the conservative
sentiment of the most conservative
people on earth clusters strongly
around the constitution. If there are
to be reforms they can only result from
a drastic reconstruction of the political
system, and the prospect of their re
alization appears somewhat remote.
The News says the President seems
to be wrestling with forces he can
comprehend but not control.
The Dally Express gives the message
a strong demonstration of the fact that
the main currents of the national life
In England and America are sweeping
forward in parallel "lines, namely, to
the struggle of nationalism against
anti-nationalism.
New Embassador May Ad
just Bering Sea Question.
LONDON, Dec. 4. — President Roose
velt's reference in his message to Con
gress to the negotiations .between the
U^ted States and Great Britain over
the Bering Sea relative to the long
pending efforts made to adequately
protect the seal herds. The negotiations
have been conducted chiefly at Wash
ington, witlf the co-operation of the
American embassy here. and. appear to
be part of a general plan to close up a
number of outstanding questions in
which Canadian Interests are involved.
The recent trend of the negotiations
have been toward having Canada re
linquish such rights as she possesses
in Bering Sea in consideration of ade
quate compensation or concessions on
other pending questions.
However, these exchanges have not
made any notable advance, as Oiinada
regards her rights In Bering Sea in the
light of a national asset, and while
disposed to make a reasonable adjust
ment she does not appear to be ready
to give up her interests^on the basis of
the concessions thus far teutatively
proposed.
The negotiations, therefore, lack re
cent definite development, although the
Government officials here hope that the
appointment of a new Embassador to
the United States may lead to clearing
.up this and other pending questions.

THE M
M any California Newspapers
Express Vigorous Protests
Subjoined are editorial expressions
of the press of the State. ln the issues
of last evening and .thisi- morning on
that part of the President's message
dealing with the Japanese question:
Big : Stick Not Big Enough
• to Cow Galif ornia
Sacramento Union
The President has dealt with this
matter . Impetuously; • he ..has argued
from wrong-, premises and he has
reached wrong conclusions. ' To speak
of California's deliberate and conscien
tious attitude in excluding the Japan
ese from her . public schools as a
"wicked absurdity" is inconsistent with
the judicial and well-informed utter
ances that should emanate from a
President of the United States, and to
treat California in general as though
she were animated by a merely stupid
and reasonless race prejudice, to scold
her as a needless f omenter of . racial
discords, is not only a gross Injustice,
but represents one of the least admir
able and least lovable aspects of the'
President's character.
If President Roosevelt had taken
sober second thought he would have
remembered that the day of enforcing
upon a people that which their judg
ment and their taste have rejected has
long since passed. Not even the .big
stick is big enough to compel the peo
ple of California to do a thing which
they have a fixed determination not
to do.
Congressman Hayes* Paper
Toasts the Executive
San Jose Mercury
President Roosevelt should not : be
surprised if he learns very shortly and
very positively that the people of Cali
fornia are not the obsequious subjects
of his dictatorship, as he 'Imagines
them, to be. \u25a0 They believe him. to. be 'a
man of good Intentions, with occasional
flashes of greatpess: and perhaps, a
measure of wisdom not to be expected
in one as demonstratively impulsive as
he, but when'he declares that the white
school children of this State must share
the classroom with the brown chil
dren of another and different race he
is either mistaken , in his estimate of
the self-respect of Callfornians 'or ut
terly misinformed or uninformed of the
reasons why we object to the conver
sion of the State Into a dumping
ground for the yellow nordes/ of the
Orient. '/;""?!'
Is It Not Enough to Give
Them a Free Education?.
Los Angeles Herald
\u25a0 The question . is fan' important -. one,
but the President can see but one- side
to it, \u25a0 which Is .that: no "State^ or,,.' city,
has 'the" power.'; to make; orl'enforce
any" law. that ( will \u25a0 be ) in / contravention
of treaty. 1 rights, with favored' nations."
Every lawyer will concede that much.
Japan Is a favored nation, and - our
treaty with her requires us to grant
to Japanese In this country all "the
"rights of residence" which citizens of
the United States enjoy. •'•'\u25a0 * • ••
But what is a "right of residence?"
Does it include free education at the
expense of' citizens?. That's the ques
tion which must be determined. :In
San Francisco, as we understand" It,
the right to a free education. has not
been denied by the school board to
the Japanese, but only that • the Jap
anese shall attend a free school main
tained for foreigners.
Sentiment of Whole State
Is Against Exclusion
Los Angeles Times
If a vote could be taken covering the
whole State as to the exclusion of
\u25a0Japanese laborers : from * California,
there is scarcely a 'shadow of doubt
that ,it % would be ' overwhelmingly
against any such ' proposition. The
question of excluding the ' Japanese
from the public -schools In San Fran
cisco is purely local. There Is no doubt
that grave reasons do exist why the
Japanese pupils should in numerous in
stances be excluded from close asso
ciation in the public - schools with
white children. \u25a0 .' ' < '\u25a0
Naturalization Would Tend
to Deßase Citizenship
Stockton Independent
President Roosevelt's message' to
Congress will be received in California
with great surprise and with much - in
dignation -. by a .vast majority. That
part of the message that treats of the
Japanese in San Francisco is based on
erroneous information and- might' be
excused on that ground if the President
had not followed It up by . recommend
ing • that Congress provide for the
naturalization of Japanese.
Such a law will be regarded by resi
dents of the Pacific Coast as a meas
ure that would tend to the debasement
of ' the boon of . citizenship and to or
ganizing disintegration.

and Czar-like when there Is no,neces

December 6. 1904, l declaring what
would be done with: the. Central and
South American republics if they did
not pay their debts. .-
As he has completely reversed hlmV
self on that proposition, let us hope
that he will also soon see the Japanese
invasion of our common' schools in Its
proper light. . .. / ./
East Does Not Know Little
Brown Men as We Do., .'i
San Bernardino Sun
The people of the United States will
not look with favor -upon 'any Immigra
tion which does not offer.the'possibili
ties of citizenship, and in this regard
the Japanese is fully; as objectionable
as the Chinaman. Ho is always the
subject of the Mikado; and : hopes for
nothing else. - .
The President has a wrong, premise
at the foundation ofj-his argument
when he suggests the.; assimilation of
the Japanese. If Calif ornians are most
pronounced in these opinions it Is be
cause they know the Japanese better
than do the citizens of other States.
Situation Does Not Gall for
the Language Used
Eureka Times
Probably the most 'striking part of
the message to the people of the Pacific
Coast is that severely condemnatory of
the people of San Francisco for their
.refusal to admit' the 'Japanese to the
public schools. Surely the .language
seems too strong for the occasion. The
people of the South V segregate tha
negroes and escape • such excoriation,
and certainly San Franciscans should
have the same right. ,
, The right of the matter- is. .hot af-'
fected by the fact that Japan has war
ships with which;to:make threatening
demonstrations and the negroes have
not. " ' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ' " v>. \u25a0 \u25a0. . \u25a0•.—-...;

ALLEGED COMBINE

DENVER, Dec' 4.— lnterstate Com
merce- Commissioner E. E.' Clark took
evidence in Denver today in the inves

tain whether certain corporations of
Colorado f and Utah enjoy privileged
rates from the. railroads and whether
there is in existence in these two
States combinations in' restraint of

J. A. Relder, auditor of the' Colorado

crimination of ' railroads In regard" to
cars either In favor of or. against the

Welborn said that the Colorado Fuel

it was necessary; for; the Colorado Fuel
