WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 16, 1908,
It is ia generally admitted by both the
politic al friends, and enemies of Presi?
dent Roosevelt that be made a bad
break yesterday when he sent ii special
message to Congress containing a vicious
attack upon Jcseph Politz-r, editor of
the New York World, who, it appears,
is guilty of nothing more serious than aa
publisher of a newspaper in a free
country, called attention to a matter
wbich concerns every taxrayer in the
country. The World's reply, published
else wherein tbe Gazette, is virtually
unanswerable wben viewed from the
stand-poi nt of America's free Institutions.
Mr. Roosevelt is pawing the zenith ol
hia career, a recession has set io and be
la likely to go oat witb a bad smell. He
bas for some time brought odium upon
his high position by his ii judicious talk
and actions, and most people have
grown tired of bis domineering spirit;
hence they will bri nth sher tbe fourth
of next March wben his successor ahall
have been inaugurate.
Evkry male citizen of tbe Uoited
States between the ages of 1* aod 4. is
to become a part of the military force of
the country and liable to perform mili?
tary duty, under tbe terms of thebiil the
pass-fe of whicb has been recommended
by the president in one of his many
?pecial messages to Congress during the
past ten days. Tbe bill provides an
elastic organization and, as the president
?ays, under its provisioirs it would be
just as easy to raise an army of two mil?
lion men as one of 50,000. The army,
in time of wer, is to consist of three
branches ti be respectively designated
the regular army, the National Guard
and tbe volunteer army. Mr. Roose?
velt would bave the Uoited States be?
come a great military power, patterned
after the European ta*.'ids and his pro?
posed nie limit shows tba', if men do
not volunteer tbey will be drafted to
aerve time ia tbe army, as is done in
Qf rmany and Russia. This is very re?
pugnant to A ni r fans, however.
A disi'Atch lo trie Biston Herald
from Washington taja that William
Nelson Cromwell received $220,000 for
hia services in bringing about the sale
of the Panama canal property to the
United States. This, it is said, waa al?
lowed by the French c outt. No Ameri?
can name appears in the list of canal
stockholder* but there are several ways
of killing a dog besides shooting it. Mr.
Cromwell may not have received a cent
for the psit he mk ia the deal but, as
a rule, he is nt in business for his
health. If he got all the money for en?
gineering the P-tjama secession and tbe
sale of the canal property to the U. B,
government tbat some people say be did,
he could well alford to make the big con?
tribution to the national republican cam?
paign fund with wbich he was credited.

EPISCOPAL COUNCIL.
The special council called by Bishop
Gibson for tbe election of a coadjutor
bishop ia tbe Episcopal Diocese of Vir?
ginia met In St. Paul's Church, in thia
city, at 10 o'clock thia morning. The
c uncil opened with the celebration of
tba holy communion by Bishop Gibson,
assisted by Rev. P. P. Phillipe, rector
of tbe church.
Tbe council convened for business at
half-past eleven with Biahop Gibton in
tbe chair. The mil of clerical and lay
delegates was tben called by tbe secre?
tary, Rev. E Meade, of Pohick Church,
and 70 clergy and 57 laity were fonnd
present.
Rev. E. B. Barwell, Honorable R.
Taylor and Mr. W. C. Marshall were
appointed on committee of credentials on
the lay d'legatee preaent.
Bishop Gideon then announced tbat
thi' special council ia convened in thia
old city of Alexandria and in this
church of God, fur the election ofa co
adjotor-bisbop, which ia a deeply re?
ligious matter. The council mast re?
member tbat it ia assembled not only Cai
tbe electioa of a coadjutor in Virginis,
but for tbat of a biahop io the church of
G d. Bishop Gibson aaid that he had
been led to tbia decision from careful
thought on his part and from no outside
suggestion. Tbe work of tbe diocese
distinctly demanded a coadjutor at tbia
time. After the announcement had
beeo made on bia part at the last coun?
cil, it waa judged beat to have a special
council devrted to the one work of elect
log a coadjutor. A great part ot tbe
clergy feit the necessity of tbis, and tbe
standing committee acting as the proper
council of advice, gave its opinion as to
the strong advisability of calling thia
council.
The biahop then showed the remark?
able development of tbe diocese aad wat
glad to tay tbat nearly every (arish was
now filled. But in addition to the regu?
lar and growing work ot the diocese the
bishop reminded the council that the
legislation of the last general convention
demanded more doti's on the part of a'l
bishops such aa those arising in connec?
tion w.th the new canons on divorce,
the calling of rectors, and decisions
coming np under canon XIX, which
allows special addressee to be made by
"Christian m6n" in Episcopal churches
subject to tbe approval of the bishop.
Then tbere are special dotiee in coonee
tian with board ard others meetings
which make many demanda upon a
bishop's time. Si every condition in
the diocese shows tbe neceasity of elect?
ing a coadjutor, and the bishop trusted
that the council woold now undertake
this solemn responsibility ia Ihe spirit
of Christ. The duties he would assign
to the coadjutor, are tbe following:
Tbe visi'atlon of all parishes once in
two years; at every visitation to call
the attention of tbe congregation to
diocesan missions, and fake ap an offer?
ing for the same; and to be a member ot
tbe bishop's official family.
Mr. James Oaskie, of Richmond, then
offered tbefollowing resolution; Resolved.
T .at a committee of seven be appointed
by the bishop which committee shall be
selected from the various sections of the
diocese, at least one member to come
fr)m each convocation wbo shall ascer?
tain and report at the next meeting of
the council to be held in Leeaburg the
judgment of the diocese (1) as to the
necessity of a biahop coadjutor for the
dioceae;(2) aa to the ability of the diocese
to meet tbe expense of raid office. Pend?
ing a vote on thia wbich was called for
by orders, Jadge Norton moved that
the finance committee make its report
ao that tbe council might act intelligently
in its decision with reference to tbe
election of a coadjutor bishop. The re?
port of thia committee waa then made
by Mr. Caakie, after which the council
took a recess, until 2:45 o'clock.
