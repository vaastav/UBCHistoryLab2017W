RICHMOND MEETING
RICH IN RESULTS
Theories of Penology Are
Discussed at Conference
of Executives
RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 3.—-In the
name of the state of South Carolina
Governor Blease served notice to the
governors' conference here today that
lynchers of negro assailants of white
Wp en in his state would go un
punished.
Governor Blease warmly defended
his use of pardoning power as well aa
declarjng that In 22 months he had
pardoned or paroled approximately 400
persons and that he hoped the number
at the end of the second term would
be 800.
"I have said all over South Carolina,
and I say it again, now," he declared,
"that I will never order out the militia
to shoot down their neighbors and pro
tect a black brute who commits the
nameless crime against a white woman.
ONLY GET THE RHiHT MAN
"Therefore, in South Carolina, let it
be understood that when a negro as
saults a white woman all that is needed
Is that they get the right man, and
they who get him will neither need nor
receive a trial." *
Governor Blease justified the use he
had made of his pardoning power, he
Bald, by conditions he had found in
penal institutions in the state.
Flogging, in some cases, for chll
tflren; the whipping post for violators
of certain laws, and sterilization of
assailants of women, were advocated
by Governor Baldwin of Connecticut
In an address delivered this afternoon
before the governors' conference here.
In his speech Governor Baldwin de
clared that he was more in sympathy
With the "classical school of penology"
than the "new or noisier one. mainly
jmade up of sentimental humanitarians
or theoretical psychologists."
The former school, he said, maintains
that criminals should ordinarily be
punished by subjection to some form
of suffering; the other that they should
ordinarily not be made to suffer for
their misdeeds except as nature forces
it upon them through the mind, but
that their treatment by the state should
be aimed primarily at their moral im
provement.
Governor Baldwin's address followed
address hy Governor Shafroth W
<f~ ->rado. In which Governor Shafroth
■ rated lenient but certain punish
ment to criminals and cited his own
state as an example where this system
had worked well.

25 votes hy the proposed recanvass.

clerk.
The fact that a delay might result
from the issuance of a writ which

another factor upon which the court
based its refusal. The case differs from

FATHER, 80, SUES SON .
FOR MONTHLY SUPPORT
Parent, Bent and Crippled, Seeks Court
Order Requiring Heir to Keep
Promise of Aid
An appeal to the superior court to
compel hia son to pay a share with
three others toward his support was
made yesterday by Jacob Miller, who
describes himself as a bent and crip
pled man of 80 years. The son is John
Meller, who, according to the father, is
able to pay his share of $10 a month for
support of the aged man. but has failed
to do so. Joined with the father are
two other sons, William M. and Ernest
M. Miller.
The father, after pleading his Inabil
ity to support himself, asserts that
John Miller owns a house and lot at
468 Thirty-first avenue and receives
good wages. He declares, however,
that for two years the son has promised
to pay his share, but that the young
man failed to keep his promise.
Meantime the father lives with Wil
liam, who, with the other brother, is not
able to meet the entire amount neces
sary for the care of their parent. The
plaintiffs ask judgment against John
for his share, and also an order direct
ing that $30 a month be paid by the
three sons toward the father's keep.

FOREIGN POLICY
OF THIS NATION
TO BE VIGOROUS
In Annual Message Presi
dent Points Out That the
United States Has Be
come World Power
AMERICAN CAPITAL
MAY AID DIPLOMACY
This Country Assumes Po
lice Powers Over Central
American States
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. —President
Taft's first message to the last session
of congress in his term was received
with close attention by both branches
when legislative business began today.
Dealing entirely with foreign relations
and American progress in foreign trade,
the message paves the way for others
the chief executive will send later deal
ing with the big questions of legisla
tion and government.
A note of warning to European
powers, which, by indirect means, con
tinue tew discriminate against American
trade; a strong appeal to congress to
uplift the great foreign policies of
America above mere questions of par
tisanship; a triumphant vindication of
the diplomacy of the administration,
which is characterized as that of "dol
lars versus bullets"; a masterful pride
in the enormous expansion of American
trade as a, result of the foreign policies
of his administration, and an earnest
appeal for joint action by congress and
the executive to open new markets for
American industries —these are the
more striking features of President
Taft's fourth annual message sent to
congress today.
GOOD RELATIONS ABROAD
The message Is the first of a series of
such communications which he will
make to congress in the early days of
the session, and deals entirely with the
foreign relations of the United States.
Beginning with the usual reference to
the existing good relations with foreign
powers, the president adds that these
have been strengthened by "a greater
Insistence upon justice to American
citizens or Interests wherever it may
have been denied, and a stronger em
phasis of the need of mutuality In com
mercial and other relations."
For the first time in Its history, says
the president, the state department has
obtained substantially the most favored
nation treatment from all of the coun
tries of the world. Therefore, he says,
it is only natural that, competitive
countries should view with some con
cern the expansion of our commerce.
Hence the warning: "If in some in
stances the measures taken by them to
meet it are not entirely equitable, a
remedy should be found."
To this end the president strongly
recommends the enactment of the bill
recommended by Secretary Knox last
December, permitting the government,
instead of imposing the full maximum
rates of duty against discriminating
countries, to apply a graduated scale
of duties up to the mixlmum of 25
per cent.
"Flat tariffs are out of date," says
the president. "Nations no longer ac
cord equal tariff treatment to all other
nations, irrespective of the treatment
from them received. • * • It Is
very necessary that the American gov
ernment should be equipped with
weapons of negotiation adapted to mod
ern economic conditions."
STATE DEPARTMENT ARCHAIC
The state department, "an archaic
and Inadequate machine," at the be
ginning of this administration, the
president says, has become a new or
ganization, with highly specialized bu
reaus and experts dealing with every
phase of American trade and diplo
macy. Holding that the essence of this
reorganized service is found in the
merit system, which President Cleve
land is credited with having intro
duced, President Taft makes a strong
appeal to congress to make this ma
chine permanent by giving the force of
statutory law to the executive orders
governing admission to and promotion
In the doplomatlc and consular services.
To show that these appointments
are already largely nonpartisan, the
president points to the fact that three
of the present ambassadors are hold
overs; that of the 10 he has appointed,
five were by promotion from the rank
of minister; that of the 30 ministers
appointed, 11 were promotions; and
that in the consular ser-ice no less
than 55 per cent of the consuls ap
pointed by him were from the southern
states.
"The diplomacy of the present ad
ministration has sought to respond to
modern ideas of commercial , inter
course," says President Taft. "This
policy has been characterized as sub
stituting dollars for bullets. It is one
that appeals alike to idealistic humani
tarian sentiments, to the dictates of
sound policy and strategy, and to le
gitimate commercial aims."
The president adds that "because
modern diplomacy is commercial, there
has been a disposition in some quarters
to attribute to It none but material
istic aims.
"How strikingly erroneous Is such an
impression may be seen from a study
of the results by which the diplomacy
of the United States can be Judged,"
says the president.
FRIENDLY OFIHCES EXTENDED
He mentions the arbitration treaties
with France and Great Britain, which
ailed of confirmation in the senate; the ,
successful tripartite mediation of the i
Argentine Republic, Brazil and the J
United States between Peru and Ecua
dor; the arbitration of the Panama- '
Costa Rica boundary dispute; the inter
vention between Haiti and the Domini- I
can republic on the verge of war; the
suppression of the Nicaraguan war; the
halting of internecine strife In Hon- j
duras; the adjustment of the celebrated >
Tacna-Arlca dispute between Peru and j
Chile, and the adjustment of the Peru- |
vian-Ecuadoran boundary Issue.
In consequence of these things, says '
the president, there has been a general I
easing of international tension on the !
west coast of South America. He also
adds that the diplomacy of the United
States is active in seeking to assuage

"Dollar Diplomacy" Defended
Tariff Is Weapon of Trade War
"Substitute dollars for bullets," was the phrase used by President
Taft in his message on foreign relations, urging that the government
support American enterprise abroad. He recommends help by Amer
ican bankers in Central America to remove the menace of foreign
creditors and revolutionary disorder, and financial investment in China.
The amendment of the maximum and minimum provisions of the
tariff to allow the president to apply duties so as to meet nations dis
criminating against this country was urged, as was also the enactment
or an opium law to stamp out the traffic.
"Patient nonintervention" was the characterization of the govern
ment's policy in the Mexican troubles, recognizing constituted
and attempting to care for American interests. In regard to Chinese
conditions, Taft stated that he United States maintained full and friendly
de facto relations with the provisional government, while for the present
Balkan situation he referred to the protection of American interests by
sending a squadron to the scene.
His general recommendations include a merchant marine, good
American banks in South and Central America and a permanent and
well paid foreign service.
the remaining ill feeling between" this
country and Colombia.
Taking up some of the details of the
year's diplomatic work, the president
refers with expressions of pride to
China, where "the policy of encouraging
financial investment to enable that
country to help itself has had the result
of giving new life and practical appli
cation to the open door policy." The
consistent purpose has been to encour
age the use of American capital in
China, says the president, to promote
the reforms to which that country 1b
pledged by treaty with the United
States and other powers. There has
been a vigorous assertion also, he says,
of the equal right of the United States
to a voice in all questions pertaining
to Chinese loans and developments.
AFFAIRS IN NICARAGUA
President Taft. makes the direct
charge that the terrible events recorded
in Nicaragua recently, the useless loss
of life, the devastation of property, the
bombardment of the principal cities,
the killings and the tortures and suf
fering, "might have been averted had
the department of state, through ap
proval of the loan convention b$- the
senate, been permitted to carry out its
now well developed policy."
"In Central America the aim has been
to help such countries as Nicaragua
and Honduras to help themselves," says
President Taft.
While they are the immediate bene
ficiaries, the profit to the United States
Is twofold, he adds. The Monroe doc
trine is more vital In the neighborhood
of the Panama canal, and such coun
tries should be relieved of the jeopardy
of heavy foreign debts likely to pro
voke International complications.
The financial rehabilitation of these
countries by American bankers and the
protection of their custom houses from
being the prey of would be dictators,
says the president,, would remove the
menace of foreign creditors and revo
lutionary disorder. Furthermore, the
United States would profit largely In a
business way through the development
of the great natural resources of Cen
tral America.
PROFESSIONAL REVOLUTIONISTS
Commending the successful results of
the application of the new neutrallty
Jaws to Mexico and other troubled
countries, the president suggests that
means be found in addition to prevent
the professional revolutionists from
making American ports "foci" for rev
olutionary intrigue. He reiterated his
determination to adhere in the case
of Mexico to the "patient policy of
nonintervention, steadfast recognition
o*f constituted authority, and the exer
tion of every effort to protect American
interests."
Other paragraphs of the message
point to the increase of American do
mestic exports by $200,000,000 during
the last y*ar, making the greatest
total ever known, $2,200,000,000; to the
agricultural credit system which he
thoroughly indorsed; to the probable
necessity of an amendment of the fur
seal act to permit limiting killing of
seals; to a meeting of the arbitrators
In Washington next year to adjust the
pecuniary claim between Great Britain
and America; to negotiations with
Mexico for the distribution of the
waters of the Colorado river In the Im
perial valley section, and to the finan
cial rehabilitation of Liberia.
There is merely historical reference
to the Chinese revolution; to the Santo
Domingan troubles, the rebellion in
Cuba and the Balkan war develop
ments, in which it is said the United
States is not involved.
The message concludes with an earn
est appeal to congress to co-operate
with the executive in Its efforts to
apply the old principles of diplomacy
which have governed the country, to
the momentous new situations of today,
when America finds itself at the thresh
old of her middle age as a nation:
"too mature to continue in Its foreign
relations those temporary expedients
natural to a people to whom domestic
affairs are the sole concern."

BEARS QUIET DREAMS
Rev. H. A. Musser Gives
Point to Teachings by
Marksmanship
Rev. H. A. Musser, an American mis
sionary who returned fronulndia Mon
day on •the liner Tenyo Maru, is an
exponent of muscular Christianity, die
is reputed to be a first class boxer and
was one of the best shots with a rifle
in the vicinity of Nagpur, in South
Berars, where he was stationed for
four years.
Surrounding Nagpur was an exten
sive swamp Infested with big bears
that lived In caves dug by mother na
ture in the banks of the river that
meandered through the swamp. The
natives were in deadly fear of these
animals, which annually collected a
heavy toll of human lives. They used
to leave their caves at nightfall and
wander down in groups to the water
wells. -
Every once in a while a native who
had neglected to lay in a supply of
water by daylight encountered a gang
of these bears, and as a rule the native
died.
The British government having dis
armed the natives, they were helpless
to retaliate. They appealed to Musser,
■who maintained a well equipped hunt
ing arsenal. He made up a party and
one moonlight night visited one of the
largest caves and fired a challenge into
its depths.
Without stopping to inquire who was
there, an enormous bear rushed from
the cave. The animal was less than
two feet from the missionary when
Musser let fly with a heavy rifle and
ripped out a section of bruin's wind
pipe. Musser slipped, and but for a
native who grabbed his leg would have
toboganned down the river bank with
the dying but still fighting bear. They
killed four bears that night, and before
he left Nagpur had thinned the colony
considerably.
There were tigers also in the vicinity
that occasionally carried off a few ns
tives. He d-d not hunt the tigers. The
killing of them, except strictly in self
defense. Is reserved for the civil and
military officers of the British govern
ment. Who visit, Musser says, with their
displeasure any foreigner who presumes
to kill any of this royal game.
Musser, who is on his way to his
home in Ohio, was accompanied by his
wife and two children.

HAWTHORNE MINE
ONLY HOLE, SAYS
EXPERT AT TRIAL
Egineer Swears Machinery
Had Been Removed From
Shaft Promoted by
Author
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.—Nothing but "a
hole in the ground" was what John M.
Henderson of Waterbury, Conn., saw
when he visited the Temagami-Cobalt
mines, one of the properties promoted
by Julian Hawthorne and others on
trial for using the mails to defraud.
Henderson, a mechanical engineer, so
testified today, stating that he had
paid $480 for 1.250 shares in the Tema
gami-Cobalt, and had also subscribed
for 1,200 shares of Elk Lake Cobalt, an
other Hawthorne property. The wit
ness said he visited the Temagami
mines in June, 1910, and found that
work had ceased and all the mining
machinery was being packed ready for
shipment.
A prima facie case "that several per
sons were induced to part with real
money for stock of the Temagami-Co-
bait mines seems to have been suffi
ciently established," was a ruling by
Judge Hough after several other wit
nesses had testified.
The court held it unnecessary to put
in further similar evidence.
