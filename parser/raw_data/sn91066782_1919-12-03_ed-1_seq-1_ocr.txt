PROTOCOL AND

V: ' '
The Allies Come Face to Face With a Serious
Situation, as a Result of the Recalcitrant
' Attitude on the Part of the Government at
' Berlin. .
GERMANY IS TRANSFORMED,
SAY TRAINED OBSERVERS
They Assert That the Reason for the Change
Was the Failure of the United States Senate
to Ratify the Treaty of Peace The Supreme
Council Sends Note.
Paris, Dec. 3. Germany has decided not to sign the protocol
presented to her by the allies as a condition for putting the
peace treaty into effect, the peace conference has been notified.
It was learned only to-day that Baron Kurt von Lersner,
head of the German delegation here, called on Secretary Dutasta
of the conference on Monday and told him that Germany had
made such a decision. ,
This attitude is taken as confirming
the reports of a sharp reaction in Gcr-
many within the lust fortnight.. Trained
observers of Gorman developments have
ex pressed to member.') of the peace con
ference the view that there has been a
complete transformation of the situa
tion in Germany, brought about, in
their opinion, by the failure of the
United States .Senate to ratify the
peace treaty.
These observers declare! that while
the vast majority of the Germans, be
fore the Senate's adjournment, desired
the peace treaty ratified as soon as pos
sible, they are now supporting the gov
ernment's attitude in resisting the de
mands of ,i he allies for indemnity for
the, pinking, of the German fleet at
Sespa Flow, recompense for which was
provided tor in the protocol
The question upon which the German I
representatives here, however, appear !
mod spnsiuve, is me insisience upon
the trial of German officers accused of I
the commission of crimes in France
and Belgium.

KANSAS COAL IS
MINED RAPIDLY
Speeding Up Process by Volunteer Min

Railroad Men Decide To-day
Whether They Will Handle
the Non-Union Coal.
Pit tsburg," Kan., Dec. 3. Speeding up
of work in the strip pits by volunteer
diggers, shipment of more coal to west,
crn Kansas and a call for a meeting of
local railroad brotherhood members to
determine their attitude toward hand
ling the coal which the volunteers are
taking out were developments to-day
in the district, where state receivers
are operating mines to relieve the fuel
shortage occasioned by the miners'
strike.
The meeting of the railroad men was
set for late to-day and resulted from
one on Monday night which protest
was made against handling coal mined
by the. non-union labor. A request for
authority to refuse to handle the coal
was telegraphed to national brother
hood otlicials, but no reply had been
received early to-day.
No disorders have been reported from
the coal district which is being po
liced by federal and state troops.
Another contingent of volunteer min
ers is expected to arrive in the district
during the day and state officials an
nounced that several more pits would
be in operation by nightfall.
'"Before the week is over we will be
getting out ubout 7" cars per. day,"
Governor Henry J. Allen said, "and by
the end of next week we will probably
double that amount." The strip pits,
it is said, will be operated at full ca
pacity in a short time and "new pits
will also be opened up, increasing the
output to about 300,000. tons per
month, according to the governor's fig
ures. REFUSES TO GIVE BAIL
AND WON'T COMPROMISE
Writes William 0. Jenkins in Letter to
John B. Edgerton of Lebanon,
Tenn., Concorning His
Treatment in Mexico..
Xashille, Tenn., Dee. ,"."1 am now
in prison, because I refuse to give bail
for one cent and will not even compro
mise with them under any circum
stances," W. O. Jenkins, the American
consular agent at l'ucbla, Mexico, de
clared in a letter received to-day by
John P. Fdgeiton of Lebanon, Tenn..
who was captain of the Vandcrbilt
football team when Jenkins played
tackle. (
Writing in the Puebla penitentiary,
Jenkins said:
"I regret very much the great noto
riety that haa been given to my hard
luck in bcinpr carried away by some
bandits who live near here, but. it hus
been unavoidable, although the incident
would have been forgotten if the au
thorities had not tried to cover up
their criminal responsibility in allow
ing this city to be unguarded by charg
ing me with my own abduction, bo
they have used every means possible, to
get certain evidence to cover up their
absurd pretensions.
"I have never, in all my life, seen
such a farce as they are carrying out
here, for I have been condemned with
out being allowed to present a single
witness in my behalf, though I had
them ready and even presented hem to
the courts, but was told that they
were too busy to hear them. At the
present moment (Nov. 21), the secre
tary of the embassy of Mexico City is
here taking this testimony that it may
be presented to the state department,
inasmuch as the courts refuse to ac
cept it;. '
"I have plenty of testimonies to off
set any false evidence that they can
possibly produce, but, as I say, Mexi
can justice is of a certain brand at
the present time and it can't be
changed."

Affairs of Peace Nego

Paris. Dec. 3. The American delega
tion to the oeace conference, with the
greater part of the personnel of the
mission, will sail for the United Elates
from Brest next week. The precise
date of the departure has not been
fixed..
The question whether one of the
peace delegate shall remain to contin
ue the American participation in the
work of the supreme council rests, it is
stated, entirely with the state depart
ment in Washington.
The understanding here, from the
best obtainable information, is that If
none of the delejfite is left here, Am
b&ssadr Wallace will be given such
powers as will make the American par
ticipation in the subsequent, work of
the peace conference as effective a.s if
the. delegates were to remain.

present plans were for the delegation to
leave Paris on Dec. 0, leaving Ambas

MAY CUT OFF TRAINS
TO CONSERVE COAL
Many More Industrial Concerns Face
Shutdown as Result of Contin
ued Coal Strike.
Chicago, Dee. 3. Further disruption
of national industry because of the fuel
shortage brought about by the strike of
bituminous coal miners was in pros
pect to-day. Regional directors of rail
roads had authority to annul passen
ger trains where the public would be
least inconvenienced and many addi
tional manufacturing plants through
out the country faced shutdowns ei
ther through exhaustion of their coal
supplies or the strict regulation re
quired by the federal fuel adminis
trator. State executives who, under appeals
from their constituents for aid, have
sought ways and means for replenish
ing the dwindling fuel supply to-day
virtually were without encouragement
as regards increased production. Only
in isolated instances were there reports
of a change of front on the part of
the miners. Generally the workers ad
hered to their attitude of remaining
away from the mines until better terms
than the 14 per cent, wage increase de
creed by the government were forth
coming.. Optimistic reports were received from
operators of the district embracing
southern Kentucky, Tennessee and Vir
ginia that, the backbone of the strike
there had been broken. Miners at one
mall mine in Slisnouri returned, to
work with the statement that they as
Americans couhfnot see their neigh
bors suffer. Miners of one West Vir
gina sub-district adopted a resolution
favoring a general return to work un
der the 14 per cent wage increase "un
til a satisfactory adjustment is made."
On the other hand, cutting off of
electric advertising and other non-essential
use of power and fuel with the
added prospect of further curtailment
of industry brought to the general pub
lic a rather gloomy outlook. Some
regional coal directors estimated that
with reductions of working staffs al
ready made or threatened, should the
strike not. be broken immediately, the

Cummins and Representative Esch,

pending railroad bills, it was said to
day at the White House.
It was intimated that the status of
the legislation might be such that the
president would not regard it as neces
sary to address Congress on the sub
ject. Leaders in Congress are deter
mined to press the bills, but they have
expressed doubt that their enactment
could le completed before the Christ
mas holiday.
Faelt of the measures provides for
the return of4he roads to private oper
ation within a specified time, but thev
are different yi other respects, partic
ularly as to the method of dealing with
strikes and lockouts, and these differ
ences will have to be composed in
conference.
Jn view of the president's statement
to Congress yesterday that he expected
to treat the railroad question in a
separate message, there has been spec
ulation in official and railroad circles
as to whether he intended to adhere
to his previously announced plan to re
turn the railroads to private operation

deliver Herkman and Goldman at F.llis
Island by Friday noon, sail that his
two clients and some three score other
radicals might stay at the island in
definitely, unless the I'nited States
recognized soviet Russia soon. , It is
his opinion that this country can de
port no one to that country without
such recognition. Nearly all the radi
cals at Kliis Island have offered to
pay their own way to soviet Russia,
according to their counsel, Isaac Shorr.
Camminetti' telegram, the attorney
aid, also made it clear that radicals
would be delivered to red guards in
Russia, when deported and not to the
hostile white guards.

stay of the surrender of lierkman and
Goldman till M on lay,- was refused to
