TUB SUGAR FACTORY.
Tlio Norfolk Industrial company has
decided that a sugar factory could bo
made to pay hero. The president of
the company now holding the old sugar
factory property believes this and
would , under certain conditions , bo
willing to organize ft company to es
tablish a sugar factory bore. There
nro no doubt others In the country who
would bo Interested If their attention
were brought "to the nmttor.
If n local company could bo orga
nised under conditions , an opportunity
Is presented to the Commercial club
to try and arrange the necessary con
ditions. If no local company could bo
organized , then the chance Is given to
the Commercial club to advertise the
possibilities.
CONVENTIONS FOR NORFOLK.
The efforts of tlio Madison county
commissioners to Madison county and
Norfolk , are 'along the right line and
will meet with the hearty co-operation ,
In Interest at least , of this section.
It Is a line nlong which the Norfolk
Commercial club ought to have been
working for some tlmo past and would ,
no doubt , with an active head.
Secretary Hanson of the Fremont
club pointed out to Norfolk the value
of state conventions , especially con
ventions of hard-headed , thinking men.
County commissioners nro specially
qualified as guests because they are
shrewd business men , picked in their
several communities by virtue of their
good business judgment. They would
readily see the good points of the city
they visit , and would go homo and talk
about these good points. It Is good
advertising , cheaply gained.
There are many other state conven
tions which could bo secured for Nor
folk during the year , and they are all
worth while. The Commercial club
lias funds and If the president were to
outline a campaign of this sort , many
such assemblies could no doubt bo
gained.
This is ono of the many reasons
why Norfolk should own n good active
Commercial club.
THE STOUER AFFAIR.
President Roosevelt will have the
country's sympathy in the Storor mix-
up. The president , It appears from the
Vatican's semi-ofllclnl statement that
several persons appeared before the
pope representing to como from the
head of the American government , did
lot abuse bis position in connection
vlth tlio appointment of a cardinal ,
resident Roosevelt will generally bo
olioved when he says that ho refused
i > meddle in the matter and that ho
omoved the Storors because Mrs.
\orer was too much interested in af-
irs that wcro outside the otllclal
Opacity of herself and husband.
President Roosevelt has been sub-
l ! ted by the Storers to a violation of
unwritten law of fair play , which
s that no private letter shall bo
dished" without the consent and
j iwledgo of the writer. President
yjsevelt had been a. friend to the
yers , both politically and personal-
paj For this reason , in his communl-
olipn to the Storors , ho blended the
thoonal with the ofllclal , which wns
Bennder that he now appreciates. It

to the Storors. Ho lost patience , and
none will blame him. There como
moments when human patlonco snaps ,
for It IB pofislblo to "egg on" the most
dc'llbcrato of men to a point of danger.
The SlororB , not the president , have
suffered from this attack on their part.
CORTELYOU'S REPORT.

canrn of the postal dollclt. Elllcloncy.
not money piollt , according to Mr. Cor-
telyou. In what Is needed first of all ,
and the government ought to look at
this plume of the sorvlco rather than
at the necessity of playing oven. To
leduro postage rat her than to Increase
It , Is the high Ideal set by the post
master general. In discussing the
railroad contracts , ho declares that
while II Is his Impression that too
much money Is being spent for trans
portation , he Is not ready to make a
statement to this effect , nor Is ho will
ing to recommend legislation covering
the point.
The recommendation In this report
for better roads throughout the nation
will bo met with enthusiasm by farm
ers of the tuition as well as by people
living In small towns In the rural dis
tricts. All of the departments of the
federal government are seeking to get
national funds laid aside for better
roads , but thus far they have failed to
Interest President Roosevelt In the
movement and ho hns declared , ac
cording to some of the friends of good
rends , that the subject bores him.
The general tendency of the govern
ment Is toward benefiting the farmers
and the rural districts. The country
Is awaking to the fact that the coun
try's prosperity depends upon the soli
and its products and the sentiment
of James J. Hill for federal experi
ment farms , as well ns the expressions
of all of fie various departments of
the government for bettor roads , are
outgrowths of this recognition which
Is now being given to the American
farmer.
VOLUNTEER FIREMEN.
Three volunteer Ilromon , all of them
prominent business men of Ithaca ,
Now York , are dead as n result of
their efforts to save the burning Chi
Pal fraternity house , In which , besides
these men , four students lost their
lives. The heroism of those volun
teer firemen , and their sacrifice , is
slgnltlcant of the spirit that Is shown
by all volunteer firemen and should
cause the small towns of this country
to stop and think over for a. moment
the deeds which their own neighbors ,
volunteer firemen , are over ready to
do in case of emergency. Norfolk has
a lire department that would give up
Just as much as did the volunteers at
Hhaca , should occasion demand. It
Is a protection that should be appre
ciated In the fullest sense by any com
munity.
Out in the cold night , tlmo after
tlmo , the Norfolk lire boys have gone
to fight against flames that threatened
destruction to whole blocks of the
business portion of the city. Only
last week a case of this sort occurred.
The keen north wind came down with
biting force and drove the chill
through and through the firemen who
had responded in the early morning
hours to that alarm. Water from
three streams of hose soon sprayed
over all of the fire fighters and still
they clung to the struggle , soaking to
the skin. And , best of all , they re
stricted llnmes which scorned suroof
spreading Into adjoining structures , to
the ono building In which it originat
ed.
ed.Wo
Wo seldom stop long enough to ap
preciate the work that the volunteers
in flro sorvlco are performing for a
community. The sacrifice of three
lives in Ithaca shows to what limits
they will go if necessary.
COLLEGE SPIRIT.
Four students perished In the fra
ternity house lire at Cornell. Seven
others wore injured , of whom at least
oio , it was thought , must die. Among
the dead and Injured were bravo young
fellows who faced the flames with de
liberate risk , that they might help res
cue their fellow students. Ono young
Cornell undergraduate re-entered the
burning building after it had been cre
ated into an Inferno , in a futile effort
to rescue his room mate. Ho was so
badly burned that ho , too , died within
an hour. Football players who have
earned sweaters on the Cornell team
and whoso nerve on the gridiron had
made them favorites , responded to the
call of danger In this flro ns though
it were n football signal , and fought
against these flames just as courage
ously ns though they hnd been an op
posing Princeton lino.
Hero It was that the manhood and
Iron nerve and unselfishness wrought
out in football training , made Itself
apparent to good advantage. Hero it
was that gridiron heroes , acting on In
stinct gained In inter-collegiate bat
tles , leaped Into the perilous situation
for the sake of their comrades and
died for them.
Seven lives , lives of extraordinary
value ) were glvoii up In ( hat ftro and
the beautiful Chi Psl lodge , built at a
cost of $130,000 , IH n heap of'nslies ,
but the action brought out In tb'at aw
ful hour will stand as n long-time
monument to the memory of the dnad.
It was a beautiful Illustration of the
nobleness of heart that seems to bo In
the very air of the great universities
of this country. It was a splendid
picture of thu depth of feeling that
those college boys hold down In their
hearts for their mates their frater
nity brothers.
It was a sad day on the campus of
old Cornell , but n day replete with
truest heroism a heroism that shnll
llvo forever In college annals around
that campus.
INSANE HOSPITAL NEEDS.
The report made by Dr. Young , su
perintendent at the Nebraska state
hospital for the Insane , shows that the
Institution Is very much over crowded
and that more room Is needed as a
matter of economy on the part of the
stnto. Nobrankn owns the Institution
niul will take care of It In the most
economical way. For tills reason It
Is believed that the coming legislature
will bo glad to make an appropriation
of at least $90,000 , asked for by Dr.
Young , for ropnlrs nnd nddcd build
ings.
It Is snld Hint the death rnto hns
bocn high because of the cramped con
dition. Every family who has an un
fortunate kin in the Institution will
bo anxious for the added room and
will help toward gaining that added
room by bringing to the notice of va
rious state senators and representa
tives , the pressing need.
It has been said that , from the con
stantly Increasing number of patients
for Insane hospitals In Nebraska , the
Norfolk institution will require addi
tional room every year for ton years
to como , before the demand for room
is properly filled.
SHAW'S ELASTIC CURRENCY.
Secretary Shaw has como forth with
a form of elastic currency that Is all
his own. Ho will deposit $10,000,000
in various banks of the largo cities ,
half of the loan to bo returned Janu
ary 20 and half on February 1. Ho
discusses money stringency from a
viewpoint that can not bo sympathized
with by the west. Nebraska bankers
recently took action Just opposed to
the lonn which Is to bo mndo by'tho
sccrotnry of the trensury , when they
voted solidly against the proposed cur
rency reform.
Secretary Shaw says , speaking of
his plan :
"There Is no occasion for alarm , but
I believe there is occasion tor relief.
"This I have decided to grant in' ' the
following manner :
"I will deposit $10.000.000 In exist
ing depositaries in tlio cities designat
ed below , to ho secured by bonds ac
ceptable for savings bank Investment
under the laws of Now York and Mas
sachusetts , taken at DO per cent , of
their value , those deposits to be re
turned one-half on the 20th of January
nnd the remainder on the 1st of Febru
ary. I will also buy $10,000,000 of the
bonds of 1907 at the following prices :
Registered bonds , ox-Interest , nt 101
nnd coupon bonds at 102. In the event
that the bonds purchased are now held
as security of the character above In
dicated will bo accepted in lieu there
of. Not more than $1-000,000 worth ,
however , will bo purchased from any
single institution under these condi
tions. The deposits will bo mndo as
follows :
"Now York and New Orleans , $1-
500,000 each ; Uoston , Philadelphia ,
Baltimore , Chicago and St. Louis , $1-
000,000 each ; Cincinnati. Louisville ,
Atlanta and Memphis , $500,000 each. "
The following explanation of the
nlleged situation will not particularly
appeal to the western farmers , be
cause they have enough money of their
own to get along on :
"From the best Information I can
got I think the following describes the
situation fairly well :
"Our blessings are the real cause of
the actual stringency In money recog
nized everywhere. An unexpectedly
largo crop and industrial activity have
caused an unprecedented demand for
monoy. The world is everywhere pros
perous nnd money is in great dcmnnd
throughout Europe ns well ns in the
United States. Wo never had such n
volume of credits , and they are based
on an unequnled volume of assets.
The manufacturers of cotton are buy
ing that staple by the train load. The
cotton planter , unlike the western
farmers , demands actual cash and
carries It homo In his pocket. The
western fanner Is paid In checks ,
which ho deposits in the bunk to his
credit , nnd therefore does not nbhorb
actual money as does the cotton plant
er. This money should bo returned to
the banks when the planter settles
with his merchant soon after the first
of Januaryt but between now and then
the cotton consuming country as well
as the cotton producing country Is
short of money.
Now England has sent millions to
the south and the manufacturers of
cotton throughout the south have ex
hausted the capacity of local banks
and nro trying to borrow elsewhere.
BRYAN AND OWNERSHIP.
The announcement made by Mr.
Harrington of O'Neill In Norfolk that
n convention of government owner-
* ' " r
i *
ship clnba In Nebraska will bo hold
nt Southi Omnhft on December 31 ,
brings northern Nebraska prominent
ly Into national politics , so far as the
presidential nomination In the demo
cratic party Is concerned. Mr. Bryan
has apparently selected three northern
Nebraska men to launch his candidacy
and It Is not two much to assume from
this announcement that government
ownership will become the paramount
Issue , so far as Mr. Brynn is concerned -
corned , In 1908. From the present In
dications , It would appear that Mr.
Bryan will carry his ownership slogan
with him Into the democratic national
convention and It Is to bo expected
that ho will cling to the Idea , regard
less of the south with Its .Tim Crow
cars , regardless of the conservative
element In democracy , nnd carry It
with him Into the race.
The fact that Senator Allen , Mr.
Harrington and Judge Edgar Howard
have united In the plan looks ns
though Mr. Brynn has hoped to unite
In a national fusion the populist and
democratic parties for his race.
Mr. Bryan has been comparatively
silent silent for him since election
with the exception of expressing his
opinion upon the president's message ,
nnd It Is believed thnt this meeting
which Is to be pulled off at South
Omahn on the thirty-first of this
month , behind which are prominent
northern Nebraska political leaders ,
will carry more significance than the
mere announcement might Indicate.
The ropubllcnn pnrty could hope for
nothing better than the adoption of
this wnr cry of Mr. Brynn In 1908. In
the first plnco it would furnish a paramount -
mount issue. Paramount issues hnvo
become highly essential to the presi
dential campaigns In which Mr. Bryan
takes part , and it is anticipated that
ho will work the battlecry to the limit.
But the1 south , the solid , democratic
south , with Its Jim Crow car tp give
it personal Interest in the contest , will
fight the head of the ticket on such a
movement. Mr. Brynn at ono time ,
after his Madison Square speech , de
clared down In Georgia that ho wns
no more In fnvor of government own
ership of railroads than President
Roosevelt , and thnt he did not believe
the people would over force the Issue.
Yet here In his own state , and prob
ably not without his knowledge , the
Issue Is to bo forced.
The government ownership fallacy
hns been receiving jolts of late thnt
promise to mnko It n hnrd bnnner to
cnrry. A prlvnto publisher , highly re
sponsible becnu&e he is n man of many
millions , has recently guaranteed to
take over the postolllco department
nnd run it more economically than it
Is now being operated. Yet the post-
office stands ns n high typo of federal
ownership utility.
Omaha has had a sorry experience
witli government ownership on a large
scnlo. The water plnnt built there wns
appraised at six million dollars after
the city hnd determined to contlscnto
the institution nnd opernto It. The
nctunl value Is said to bo about three
million. And now the ownership fad
dists In that town hnvo determined to
build n now plnnt and operate it under
municipal ownership , so that the city
may have two water plants instead of
one , nnd with n prospect of getting , in
the end , none Instead of two.
It Is a question whether the present
water board in that city can legally
annul the former decision to buy the
old water plant , so that the plot has
merely thickened , nnd the taxpayers
are growing tired of the game.
For the sake of republican success
In 1908 , It Is to bo hoped thnt the con
vention of "ownership clubs" to beheld
held In South Omnha on December
31 , will hnvo a nntlonal slgnlficnnce.
AROUND TOWN.
You never know how n law suit is
coming out until the verdict Is ren
dered.
A little boy visiting In Norfolk the
other day , from California , and who
had never seen snow , was amazed
when a flurry of flakes nppenred.
"Grnndmn , " ho cried. "The snow Is
downing. "
Chrlstmns rudely Interferes with hu
man comfort. Ono man In Norfolk the
other day asked his wife to give him
buckwheat cakes for breakfast. "I'm

The Norfolk bar has taken Madison

Certain "Knignts 01 Norfolk" hav
ing been criticised by the "Fnlro Ln-

dyes from sundry entertainments , the
knights last Saturdny eve refrained
from mingling In a quiet party and
comforted themselves with the thought
that now nil would be fnlr snlllng butte
to their dismay , they found the falro
ladyes had taken reproof into their
owns hands by going onmasso to the
said festivities. The Holy Sabbath
day wns largely given up to negotln-
tions , embassies and secluded confer
ences. At times It seemed the irrec-
oncilables would raise the ensign of
revolt. But diplomacy worthy of n
Macchlavelll prevented a cessation of
amicable relations nnd now , though
the situation Is somewhat strained It
Is believed by these most conversant
with affairs , thnt n crisis has been
averted.
Encircled by the sentinel trees in
a bend of the Elkhorn Is n rise of
ground upon which , screened from the
railroad by a grove , stand the farm
buildings just as they stood nineteen
years ago , when a fifteen-year-old boy ,
in felt boots and a hallowe'en cap , was
picking up cobs , which the hogs , ac-
commldntlng creatures , had shelled
out of their wrapping of grain.
The vision thnt hnd nil day been be

man whose manner had made It n
pleasure for the youth's father to pass
over $105 as part payment for a bind

for a couple of winters.

And that was his first encounter
with the busy outside world. Soon ,
John was In the shops in Minneapolis ,
then in some knitting establishment ,
but the microbe of electrical science
had fastened upon him , and now after
carrying a half dozen trunks of knit
goods over the country for years , ho
will at almost every stopping place ,
unless his appartment is in the sky
parlor in the summertime or in the
shed room in thp winter , spend every
moment his business will allow with
a miniature electrical laboratory , that
travels everywhere with him in an
Innocent looking grip , and ho may one
day tell the world where electricity
comes from and maybe what it is , and
then true progress In the world's his
tory will begin.
In passing the old farm house , he Is
usually recognized by the mother and
young brothers , so a greeting is ex
changed far oftener than ho can stop

John is only ono kind of traveling
