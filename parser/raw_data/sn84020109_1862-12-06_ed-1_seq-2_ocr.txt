Rnniored Removal or Burnside.
There is a rumor in town, brought ly
passengers from St. Joseph, and said to
bo a dispatch in the St. Louis Republi
can of the 3d, purporting that Burnside
has been removed. We received papers
by last evening's mail of as late date as
the Republican, but they did not contain
anything of iu Gen. Hooker is said to
succeed to the command of the army of
the Potomac.
Nebraska caYalry.
The mustering officer passed up on the
stage for Omaha, ve understand, cn
Thursday last. The regiment is now
nearly or quite full. More companies
were offered than were accepted. Two
more companies would have formed here,
if the Governor would have granted
commissions. It is mcch easier to raise
ti r 1 1 1
a lull company or one nunarea. men,
(where all will have a chance either to
get an office, or to assist in electing some
of their friends,) than it is to' raise ten
men to fill up a company already organ
ized. Judge Wheeler intends starting for
Omaha with the requisite number of
men to complete Lieut. Keith's company,
early next week.
Companies "C" and 'E," from this
county, have lost several men by death
and otherwise. Recruits to fill them will
start up probably on Monday.
The Republican notices the arrival of
the Richardson county company, one hun-

Small Currency.
The premium on Gold and Silver his
driven almost all small change out of
circulation. To meet this deficiency,
Government has provided the Pcstoffice
currency ; but so great is the demand
that its existence is hardly noticed. In
answer to inquiries, it was telegraphed
to Cincinnati a few days ago, that no
more could be furnished the West for
8reral month?. In this emergency the
bankers of Ohio are discussing the pro
prity of issuing checks in denominations
of five, ten, and twenty-five cents. The
law there is severe against issuing shin
plasters but they intend evading the law.
In this territory merchants, to meet the
wants of community, have issued dueUils,
in small sums, printed on cards See. In
orne places they have been indicted for
evading the law, but as the law is not
literally broken, and as the whole com
munity is interested, we think the in
dictments will not amount to much.
St. Louis Republican. In another
column we publish the prospectus of this
journal. We are gratified to again num
ber it among our exchanges. It is an
exceedingly conservative paper, yet even
it has been impelled by the current of
public opinion to progress a little. It now
denies being pro-slavery It is in favor,
however of letting slavery entirely a
lone. It is extremely careful to do no
thing or favor no measure that could pos
sibly cither directly or indirectly injure
the peculiar institution. The Republican
has always assumed a high tone, and, ap
parently, at least, treated all subjects
with candor. It is a pretty go$d index
of public opinion in Missouri. If Mis
souri should be largely and decliedly in
favor of canibalism or any other great
evil, the Republican would say no word
against it, or if it did, it would be very
moderate and very dignified in its re
proaches. During the last Presidential
campaign, the Democracy of Mo. were
nearly unanimously for Douglas, the Re
publican was, therefore, quite hostile to
the Breckinridge party and to secession
isra. But in the spring of 'Gl,- when it
was thought doubtful as to which side
Mo would take, when Claib Jackson, to
use his owu words, was trying to "take
the State out of the Union, or take her
her to h 1," the Republican was waver
ing some of its articles bordering on
treason as much as it dare make them,
Again, when Fremont was assigned the
Department of Missouri, the Republican
condescended to give him its support, and
regretted that the President saw fit to
remove him. But now, since it is part
of the democratic programme to laud
McCIellan, and abuse Fremont, the Re
publican does not hesitate to kick the
dead lion.

Letter from (Jen. Craig's Division.
Fort Halleck, Nebkasxa, )
Novem ber 3.1th, 3SG2.
Fbiesd Fisher: In my last "epistle"
I spoke of a dog feast to come off in a
short time, but on account of the scarcity
of the animal it has been indifiuitely
postponed. Wre have a few in camp of
the lean kind, none fat enough for the
occasion, a lact to be regretted. I was
thinking what a fine time we could have
if we only had "stuff-gut," a beautiful
creature that belonged to Sut Lovegood.
Notwithstundmg the sad disappoint
ment, I have just returned from a sump
tuous feat prepared by Weboloquah, wife
of Nicholas Ianis. The leading dishes
were Eviyauns, Bangssovije, and Bou
daire, all French or Indian. I can only
remember the component parts cf the
Boudaire, as it suited my taste to a charm,
being of delicious flavor, and already
prepared for digestion, an important con
sideration in the absence of JJolars." I
state the components, as stated to me, by
the proprietor of the "lodge," a3 follows:
Beef, Antelope, Beaver, and Wolf. On
investigating the reason for using the
wolf-meat, I was told that the nice flavor
was imparted by it. This being a well
established mountain fact, and having
experienced it myself, I will take v:olf
in "mine," in the future.
The climate cf Halleck is dry and cold,
and as to wir.d it has no equal. Many
appear, at the constant and terrific
"blows," quite astonished ; but when I
found out that Halleck was in Nebraska,
my astonishment subsided. We have
snow riA full view from the end cf one
year to the beginning of the other, and
I am informed ice half an inch thick is
common in the month of July.
Through the medium of the "tlectic
fiuid it is known here, among the "first
settlers," that James Coleman, II. M.
Atkinson, and T. W, Bedford are anx
ious to "bleed and die,"' in defence of
Nebraska against "domestic, bad, and
hostile Indians." In consequence of this
item of news, Big Smoke, Little Tliun-
1 1 11 "ITU T t in
uer, uiacic jear, leuow iiair, nne
Face and Crow Feather, are coming into
the Forts to make peace. When such
intelligence is "flashed along'! the line,
it is hih time the Indian tribes wore
"fleeing to the Mountains." Next
summer it is thought the Government will
let contracts for killing off hese unwor
thy 'children," and I hope the Nebraska
Second will be the successful competitor
for the contract. The compaign against
the thievirg and marauding bands of
savages that roam through these moun
tains and plains, will commence, I am in
formed by the President, at some indifi
nite period ia the future. It may be well
for the Government to be cn hand with
a full supply of "presents" early in the
spring to remunerate the Indianfor.the
lives and properly taki'ii this winter.
Scalping men, women and children, and.
stealing stock of various kinds, is a small
matter. A few blankets, etc., smooths
the affair, and thus the "Great Father"
at Washingjon shows the f irit of Chris
tianity by ''overcoming- evil with gooJ."
Religion is a stroug feature in our Gov
ernment: so say all of us at Halleck.
What of the war ? Has the rebellion
been crushed ? I fear, in the language
of Ayer's American Almanac, "we have
not seen the beginning of the end" of
cur National struggle. Comparatively
speaking only a drop of blood has crim
soned the battle field : oceans must, no
doubt, yet be poured out! Gcd grant
that war may cease, and our nation be
once more united !
What of Brownville ? Are you all
dead? If so, will some of you be kind
as to send the news? If the proprietor
of the "Squatter Pill" has not worked
himself out of Nebraska, tell him prairie
dog oil is a certaia cure for a peculiar
"illness," and can be used for "man and
beast," but is useful for the rest of crea
tion. Is the Colonel cf the First Indian
Regiment all right? Hope he is win
ning laurels of fame in behalf of the Con
stitution "as it used to was," Da Com
mander of the D. I's.
The infernal wolves are barking and
howling near my cabin like a pack of old
and young devils, disturbing my nerves
so much that I must seek my "downy
couch," which, in the language of moun
tain men, means "down" on the ground.

Omaha, Ni:s:;assa, Nov. 23, 1802. J
Friend Fisher : To-day the wind has
blown a perfect hurricane up here where
we are quartered. It is as much as a
person can do to keep from being blown
over by the wind. On Wednesday, (the
2Gth) the Nebraska City company, under
Capt. Laboo, arrived here and encamped
about two miles from town. It is not
quite full, but they expect some more re
cruits this week. There are now nine
companies ready to be mustered into the
service. On Wednesday evening I went
up to Florence, where company "C" is
quartered. The boys are do'in fine ; all
in good houses, and their horses in sta
bles. They are all in gocd spirits
would rather fight rebels than Indians.
Some of our boys are pretty wild, and
do not think the officers have any control
over them until they are mustered into
the service, and they do not mind their
superior officers ; but after we are rnas
sered in, the boys will net have such an
area for fun as they have now. We drill
twice every day, but as lam laid up with
a sore foot, I have to put my time in in
reading and writing.
The company from Falls City is ex
pected here to-day, as they were in Ne
braska City night before last. Inside of
two weeks the regiment will be full to its
maximum number.
Our minor officers do not quite under
stand their business. Some of them fall
asleep and let the guard stay on all night
Such a case happened last night: the
men were put on at 9 o'clock, and stood
until 4 this morning. All are anxious
to know where we will go when mus
tered in. The majority of the regiment
would rather go South and fight, than to
stay up North here doing nothing. I
doubt whether we will have a fight with
the Indians in our whole nine months,
without going west of Ft. Laramie on the
road to Salmon River Gold Mines.
It has been pretty cold since we came
here. The men do not feel it, but our
horses have suffered extremely. Wre
have moved them down in a big hollow,
and the cold does not effect them at all
now. I believe I have written all the
news. Will write again soon.
Yours respectfully,
Corporal.
For the Nebraska Advertiser.
Diversity or Human Races.
Mr. Editor: I have frequently heard
this topic debated in' conversations, and
even lately: some maintaining the affir
mative on the subject, and others . the
negative. It is a falsehood, exclaimed
some men. with vehemence, that all men
have the same origin that all men are
descendants of Adam and of Noah. We
have already, at least, seven or eight
species of men upon earth, viz., the
White, the Negroes, the Moors, the
Tartars, the Laplanders, the Patagonians,
the Albinos, the American Indians.
Shall we give to all these different spe
cies cf men the same origin ? As well
give a common origin to dogs and wolves,
to rabbits and foxes, which are cf a diff
erent species, and of which one does not
come from the other.
The difficulty of which it is a question
here was for a while, and is, even now
with some pprsons, like a cry of war; if
we may so exprees ourselves ; but a
more enlightened philosophy has and
does reject such a futile and ruinous doc
trine. In the following assertions and
remarks, I intend to throw some light
and fix some ideas on the diversity of
human races, as far as I am able, and
you may publish them if you think
proper :
Assertion 1st. There is, onihe whole
known surface of the globe, but one and
same species of man.
Epplas atiox. All the inhabitants of
.
our globe, from North to South, from
Jast'lo West, have everywhere the same
essential constituting elements, the same
dbtructive and specific characters, name
ly: the fame structure of bones, of mus
cles, of nerves, of fibers, of flesh ; the
same order, the same arrangement, the
same destination in all the fundamental
parts of that admirable edifice ; the same
construction and the same formation in
the organs, destined to offer to our view-
sensible objects; the same way and the
progression in the formation, the nuiri
tion, the growth and the decline of the
iridi.'idual ; the same means of preserv
in g, of reproducing, of multiplying their
species; the sirne number of intellectual
faculties, designed to enlighten them on
the present, on the past, on the future,
on animate and inanimate objects, on
physical and rural good.
The organization on which depend
mostly, in all men, the action and play of
all intellectual and sensible faculties, is
more perfect in soma than in other ; for
instance, in the Europeans than in the
Africans, in certain individuals than in
other individuals, according to the. diver
sity of the climates they inhabit, of the
air them breathe, of the food they take,
of the mode of life, they lead, of the edu
cation they receive, of the temperament
they have ; but the fundamental part of
the organization is everywhere the same;
and this fundamental part diflers but ac
cidental) by a little more cr a little less
delicacy or strength, suppleness or rigid
ity, mobility or torpidity in the organs.
All men, black or white, civilized or
uncivilized, are perfectible, not only in
the physical and mechanical play of their
organs, but also in their ideas, in their
tho's, in thoir sentiments, in their man
ners, in their morals ; and this constitutes
in them the intellectual 'perfectibility per
fectibility which essentially distinguishes
them from every other living species.
This intellectual perfeclibility is not equal
in all nations and in all individuals ; but
everywhere it exists, and everywhere it
shows itself and is felt, either in the way
of knowledge, or in the way of senti
ments, to a certain degree, in man, at the
expulsion of every other living and ani
mate species.
One and the same construction, one and
the same organization, one and the same
intellection, one and the same destination
of the whole and every part of that
whole, evidently demonstrate in all hu
man races, one and the same nature, one
and the same species; therefore there is
but one and the same species of men;
therefore human species is not suscepti
ble cf any fundamental subdivision ia the
way cf nature. t - '';..
Remarks. 1. In the animal kingdom
and sometimes in the vegetable kingdom,
we call individual, a being caique, isola
ted and circumscribed in its own nature.
Such is Aristes, such is Sylvia, in the
human species. - Such' is Bucephalus,
such is Rossinaates, in the species of
horses, et cetera: Eus individum, sen
ens in naiura sua indivisuw.
2. The collection of all the individuals
which have a nature consimilar in all that
nature requires as essential and funda
mental, are a species.
In the animal kingdom, we call ani
mals of the same species, those among
which the union of the male and female
procreates a similar animal, capable of
being reproduced in the same way. We
call animals of different species those
among which the union of the male and
female, either is impossible or never pro
creates anything, cr produces a mongrel
called mule, which takes after both par
ents, and which, united to his like, is
never reproduced.
3. A term which expresses, or an idea
which represents several different spe
cies, is a genus. Genus is to species what
species is to individuals. However, in
common language, mankind and human
race are two terms perfectly synony
mous. A. G.

tains, and hotr it Is Received in
Washington.
IVAsmifGTOx, Nov. 27. Reports re
ceived here from the front to-day locate
Jackson's advance jruard at Bealstown,
on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad,
near the Rappahannock, in a position to
endeavor to hold Sigel's force from ad
vancing or to fall upon the rear of Rurn
side's army, as may be most adrisable.
Other reports scatter his forces along
along the eastern base of the Blue Rndjre
from the Rappahannock to Snicker's
Gap, placing the bulk in advance, leav
ing parties in the rear to observe and
harass our lines.
Washington, Nov. 23. We have but
little news from Fredericksburg beyond
the fact that all is quiet. An officer from
there who arrived this evening, and who
who was over in Fredericksburg under a
flag of truce, says Lee is massing the
bulk of his army there, and that the reb
els already have earthworks more for
minable than ours. The river might
have been crossed a week ago, perhaps
with ease, but it cannot be denied that it
would be a serious undertaking now.
No signs of immediate, active hostilities
are visible.
Oa the other hand another officer from
Fredericksburg brings the somewhat im
probable story that he yesterday heard
Burnside himself say that he would bring
on an engagement next week.
Gen. Grant' recent orders putting the
whole cotton trade, ia. the scat of . war, in
the .hands of the Government, and secu
ring the enormous profits of the trade to
the Government or its agents, are be
lieved here to be the forerunner of the
adoption of a similar policy throughout
the entire region in which our armies
are operating.
Amusement continues lo be expressed
on the unexpected feature of the contra
band demonstration yesterday. Senator
Poineroy had been making a speech urg
ing his CUiriqui Colonization scheme'. A
negro replied very vigorously, denoun
cing the scheme and all who had any
thing to do with it. It has not yet been
ascertained whether Pomeroy intends to
continue the debate.
Washington. Nov. CO. Commission
er Dole has written a letter to the Sec
retary of the Interior for the President,
which will be published in the morning,
on the subject of the proposed execution
of the condemned Indians in Minnesota,
protesting against it and taking the gen
eral ground that the instigators of the
outbreak should be hung, but that the
mere followers, no matter how barlarous
their deedss, slumld be pardoned ; and
urging that this course will have a much
more beneficial effect on the Indians than
a wholesale hanging.
The President's message was printed
at two this evening. It discusses at some
length the compensated emancipation
scheme, and our complicated foreign re
lations, and is understood to come out
vigorously in the defense of the emanci
pation proclamation. It is celieved, also,
that it will renew the recommendation
for a military railroad to Cumberland
Gap and Point of Rocks. It is not im
possible, however, that it may yet be
changed in one or two particulars.
There is no prospect of a speedy move
ment on Frederickahursr.
The rebels are still throwing up forti
fications. WSsiiingtox, Dec. 1. The Presi
dent's Message is spoken of on all hands
as the best written and the best consid
ered of any he has ever submitted. Tht
radical Republicans are not particularly
well pleased witfi his lengthy argument
in favor of compensated emancipation,
but the becession sympathizing members
are far worse pleased with the quiet way
in wuica he treats the emancipation proc
lamation as a thing accomplished, and
with which Congress has nothing to do
It commands much attention.
LATER rilOM RICHMOND.
A Panic In the Itebcl Capitol
Matistical fzsiormation ol the
Rebel Army iiurnside Confi
dent of Success.
Washington, Nov. 30. The people
of Richmond have been having another
panic for the last two weeks. The re
moval of McCIellan aud the rapidity of
Uiirnsuo s movement were the first
causes. At ihe time of Burnside's move
ment. Longstreet wa3 in Richmond on
his way to North Carolina the cam
paign in Virginia being supposed to be
over for the winter. Part of his corps
were with him. They were put on the
works around Richmond at once, while
he took the cars for Fredericksburg to
hold the Rappahannock line if possible ;
and if not, to retard our movement till
Lee came up. There are now from
20,000 to 2-5,000 men in the works
aroud Richmond, and but 80,000 north
of there, iucluJing Lee's aud Jackson's
forces.
Jackscn has been recalled, with Hill
and Stu trt, from the Yalley, to form the
left Hank of Lee s army.
Jackson was opposed to coming, and
wanted to keep up a division of our for
ces by raids in Maryland and Pennsyl
vania, but was overruled by Lee and
Davis. The Cabinet at Richmond have
ordered Lee to thrown his whole army
on the Rappahannock, and dispute eyery
foot of ground thence to the rebel capital.
They have plenty of raw provisions,
and millions pounds of beef, pork and
flour are accumulating at Richmond.
Vessels with clothing are running the
blockade every week, but their army is
still suffering terribly.
Numerous recent events have served
to inflame the Richmond panic, such as
Lee's suddenly changing from the offen
sive to ihe defensive; his telegraphing
daily for more men to save the capital ;
petitions and appeals of their army for
clothing; General Dix's capture of their
pickets on the Chickahominy ; the dis
covery that thf?y have lost from 60,000
to 100,000 men in the last 95 days by
battle, sickness and desertion, and indi
cations of slave insurrections at holidays.
Burnside and Government are believed
to have full acquaintance with these facts,
and Burnside regards his present force
ample for the work before him.

says General Geary made another fuc
cessfui reconuoissance from Harpers Fer
ry yesternay, in which he destroyed a
a t l.f f
cloin mill, ano tool: possession ot some
flour belonging to the rebels. It was
