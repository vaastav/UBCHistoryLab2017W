Wood and Coal Wanted!
"Cannot some one who owes ns on

Wood? We have been withont wood

some other one to bring in wood. So
we get none. Some man can do us a
favor by starting a load.
A BASE SCOUNDREL EXPOSED!
LIES OF A DRUNKEN BLACKGUARD
REFUTED!
In last week's Journal, McDcth, no
dcubt under the influence ot more bad
whisky, makes base, lying, slanderous
and libelous charges agaiost rs, and
whi:h should coneigti the author and
his co-workers to the lowest depths of
infamy, for such malignant, base
hearted and unwarranted attacks upon
any citizen, knowing as all concern
ed most know that they are base
falsehoods, in every attack made on
our character.
In the first place, McBeth acknowl
edges the "drunk," and says we ap
ohgised. Our apology, if it was one,
cotisisted of telling him, when we
met him nt Chillicothc, that "the boys
in our office had thrown the squib out
about 'spirits' having control of the
'half sheet and that we were not at
home, being at Waverly. This lie
Beth knew bat he evidently wanted
nn excuse to get into his only sphere,
intellectually, to wit: personal abuse ;
for be has never yet besn charged by
Lis friends of being capab'e of pre
senting any subject to Lis readers in
an argumentative manner.
The public will mark his charge,
tome two weeks ago, was 'that we
had swindled a number of laboring
men in and about McArthur.' We
called on him to name them, aud he
has done it. Hear him:
First we, whn in the Drug Store,
'gave whisky to others to drag them
down," and this malicious devil, as
Ida Satanic master of old, quotes
Scripture for his purpose. Now, a
refutation of this to our town citizens,
would be useless, but as others out of
McArthur might believe it, we say
that wo never, when iu the Drug
Store, sold any liquor, as Mr. Leahey
was always there, and attended to the
business of ourself, as well as Dr,
Condee. We recollect very well one
Sabbath morning of McBeth coming
into the Drug Store and getting some
liquor, representing tiiat his wife was
sick, and that her physician, Dr. Wolf,
we believe, had prescribed it." We
supposed him sober, and he got the
liquor. When McButh first came to
, our town, Mr. Leahy let him have
liquor, not knowing at that time that
he was in the habit of getting drunk,
and when he. found out that fact, he
refused it; whereupon McBeth abused
Leahy in unmeasured terms.
Second The next awful swindling
of laboring men, is in our reply to the
committee of ladies of citizens of
McArthur, whom McBeth, we sup
posed, informed and misled into the
belief that we were selling liquor as a
beverage. Tuis bloated carcas says,
vhon the ladies requested us to desist
from our infamous traffic, we 'did
not treat them in a gentlemanly man
ner.' The ladies were Mrs. David
Jones, Mrs. Chester French, Mrs. J.
K. Will, Mrs. James Ma'.one, Mrs.
McBeth, and others, to whom we
confidently refer, believing that they
will all say that we treated them in a
courteous and gentlemanly manner.
We have no doubt the ladies called
under the falsa impression that Dr.
Condee and ourself, had been selling
liquors as a beverage; because it has
ever been the course ol McBeth end
his co-laborers in scandal, to first pre
pare the public mind of McAtthur to
believe certain thing,baibre 'hey acted
on the damnable consummation of
their designs. It will be borne in
mind, that at this particular time,
McBeth, David Jones, Dr. Fell, and
a few other worthies, were engaged
in a great Temperance reformation,
all members, and attempting to co
erce every man, woman and child iu
to their dogmas ; and to carry out
their designs some of the eamo crow
a
became members of tba Methodist
Church. Whether they approached
the altar in a spirit ot awe and hem
bling ornot, wecacnutsay. Whether
their reformation has reformed our
citizens or not, it is not our province
to jndge. But this much we can say
to our citizens, that all should be on
the look out, tor McBeth now comes
out as t ho Generalissimo Rbfonner of
our town! When mm put on the
cloak of morality and religion to serve
the devil in, it ts time for our people
to be on their guard
We refer to the statement of Mr.
Leahy, given below, for the facts in
connection with the Drug Store and
the ladies' committee. There were
many other of our citizens present,
who will vouch for its truth; but this
is sufficient to brand the Journal man
with giving out two infamous lies,
manufactured by McBeth & Co. :
j
.
McARTHUR, Nov. 29, 1861.
In justice to E. A. Bratton, I wish
to say, that wliilo ho was connected
with the Drng Storo, It did not him
self, nor did he authorize me, to sell
iutoxicating liquors to any mau who
was in tho habit of getting drunk ;
nurliae any been sold, knowingly, as
a beverage, since the Drug-Store start
ed, nnlebs they imposed on me. Mc
Beth has bought liquor before I kuew
he was in the habit of using it to ex
cess. The committee ol ladies who
called at tho Drug Store were rvceiv
cd in a gentlemanly and friendly
manner. They insisted 'that liquor
had been sold at the Drug store as a
beverage, and to persons intoxicated.'
ibis was of course contradicted, as
it was not the truth. Whereupon,
Mrs. David Jones and Mrs. McBeth
insisted 'that Bratton and myself were
not telliog the trnth.' After some
considerable conversation, one of tho
ladies said to Bratton, 'as he had
children of his own, he should feel in
this matter as other parents whose
boys were getting drunk:' when Brat
ton replied, that he 'had a number of
babies, and he entertained a high res
pect for ladies who staid at home to
attend to their babies.' This was all
that was said from which anybody
could take offense.
T. K. LEAHY.
Third Hie statement in regard to
our getting a deposit of $200, or
contracting, at auy price, to build a
house; to taking a bureau or hog
(we don't mean "Toodlea") from Mrs.
Alexander, or that we swindled her
out of one cent, is a malicious.
black-hearted lie, manufactured ont
of whole cloth by this scoundrel, who
wishes to bring the private dealings
of all concerned, J. C. 1 Brown, II.
S. Bundy, Mrs. Alexander, and my
self, before the publ c. The following
brands him a liar:
McARTHUR, Dec. 2, 1861.
I wish, iu referenco to the charge
agaiuBtMr. Bratton in the last Jour
nal, to say that Mr. Bratton never
swindled me out of one cent, that
am aware oi, ana mat l insisted on
him selling my bureau for me aud
1 . t . W i .
I
buying tne pig, to be applied as a
payment on my property. I have not
yet got the deed, but am satisfied I
will get it, as I have a bond lor the
deed trom Mr. Brown,
A. ALEXANDER.
Mr. Aquilla Dowd got the bureau
and paid $20 for it in notes. The pig
we got. It weighed 24SR3., live
weight, and we paid $9 for it.
a a
as to our taxes, we believe we
have the right to pay our taxes when
we please, and have paid more than
twenty times as much taxes as this
scullion of the Journal. But, by his
reasoning, every man that don't pay
his taxes is a swindler I What do
the men of Vinton think of this po
sition of this nigger organ I Yes, ye
are all swindlers lor not being able to
pay your taxes; this charge, too,
from a man who has earnestly labored
bring us all ts poverty for the sake
of a few negro slaves 1
Fourth The Journal also says:
"Bratton told the man (a German)
that Damarin, Tarr & Co. were about
broke." This is a most infernal lie.
told for only one object, namely, to
prevent ns from getting business as
an attorney. What other object could
this scoundrel, or the man who furn
ished the btatement to McBeth, have
for concocting such a lief We have
always believed this firm safe, and be
lievod Mr. Damarin to be worth hun
dreds of thousands. We had Mr,
Damarin's confidence, and he was one
of the first men, years ago, to put ns
on our guard as to enemies we had in
McArthur. McBeth says before
week, we went to Portsmouth and
traded this note of over $300 for
groceries. We have been to Forts-
month and bought there several thou
sand dollars worth of goods; but it is
lie that we were there and traded a
$300 note Sot groceries and shipped
them here to W. E. Bratton, or any
person else but ourself; but, on the" re-
verse, W. E.Bratton went and bought
Lis own groceries, in hie own name,
wo being in the mercantile business
at the same time ; so this mean and
contemptible insinuation that we were
putting property into our son's hands
to avoid our debts, is another base
lie!
rrr . t r- a Ttrt
n no is me ucrman i v ncn was
the note given for collection I If you
give us dates and names, Mr. Dama
rin & Co.'s books will show np your
lying. We have collected for a great
many Germans, and it is impossible
to tell who is meant by such base in
sinuations. We wish, in earnest, to apologise
to our readers for bringing "Toodlee"
before them in such length, and will,
in the language of Clay to Randolph,
dismiss his rotten carcas, leaving it to
"Shine and (link, tod ttink nd thine,
Like rotten mackrel by moonlight I"
To Our Friends.
We ask as a favor, that our friends
contradict by a direct denial, the
slanderous and libellous charges of
the Whang doodle of the Journal of
list week. There is not a word of
truth in McBoth's article that reflects
on our character, from beginning to
end. Of thil we can satisfy any of
our friends or citizens iio doubt our
word, by calling on us, as we have the
evidence on hand. The object is on
ly to injure ns in a pecuniary point of
view. McBeth is not responsible or
we wonld settle it in a court of jus
tioe.

Joshua R. Giddings—His Foolish Conduct.
The Montreal (Canada) Advertiser
of Saturday last contains the follow-
4,Col. Dawson an English gentle
man of wealth and position, now stay
ing in this city, recently applied to
Mr. Giddings, the United States Con
sul, tor a passport to pass through the
United States en route for Halifax, to
visit his daughter, married to an offi
cer of one of the regiments there. Mr.
Giddings, not content with relhsing a
passport, did so in the most offensive
manner, telling Colonel Dawson that
British subjects had no right to ex
pect favors from the Government of
the United States, when they gave aid
aud sympathy to the rebels; and fi
nally, getting into a furious passion,
the connsul declared il Eugiand want
ed to fight, that she might come on,
tho United States was ready for her."
biddings ought to be removed trom
office at once tor such rudo and un
becoming conduct, outrageous at any
time, but specially foolish considering
the delicate state of our foreign rela
tions. When Giddings was sent to
Cauada, the reason given was that we
Bbould be rid of a mischievous agita
tor, who would be harmless in a for
eigu mission, but would be dangerous
if he remained at home But it seems
"Old Gid." is as troublesome in the
former capacity as in the latter, and
even more so. The Canada paper
from which we quote adds :
"It is quite evident that Mr. Gid
dings is insane; the excitement of re
cent events has been too much for his
mind; and his friends should remove
him to an asylum before he does him
self some mischief."
We have thonzht Giddings wasia-
sane for many years, but it must be
confessed there is "method in his
madness." It is high time the Ad
ministration closed his carreer in Can
[Enq.
Slavery and the Kentucky Legislature.
The New York Times of Friday,
after copying the indorsement of the
Frankfort (Ky.) Commonwealth of
John Cochrane's and Cameron's pro
posal to arm the negro slaves, says:
"This is onlv one ofthe many inai-
cations that this question of slavery,
in its relations to tne rebellion, may,
for the present, at least, be wisely and
safely left to the action of the loyal
slave States most directly concerned.
We mentioned yesterday a fact, which
we have learned from the very high
est authority, that a bill "be speedily
introduced Into tbe Kentucky Legis
lature for the confiscation ot the prop
erty of rebels, including slaves; and
tbat there is every reason to believe
that it will become a law. Once
thoroughly enlisted in the fight for
the Union, the people of Kentucky
will take such steps as will best pro
mote their cause. They have far more
at stake than we. The war, with all
its horrors, comes much closer home
than it does to ns. Brother there is
armed against brother father against
son neighbor against neighbor. In
each a war, where defeat involves ut
ter and irretrievable ruin, we need
have no fear that Union'raen will nee
lect anv weanon which can c!a tlmm
aid. If striking at slavery will help
them, they will strike the blow.
They know, moreover, when to strike
and where to strike much better than
we do.
DCr'Congreas met on last Monday,
organized, and cothiog of importance
was done except the introduction of a
resolution to free negroes.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We received the President's Mes
sage just as wo wem going to press
and it will appear in full in our next
issue. It is a straight forward busi
ness-iike docuinoot: and starts out
with onr foreign relations. Recom
mends fortifying our Lake ports and
Atlantic sea board. This looks like
danger from abroad. It recommends
the acknowledgement ofthe indepen
dence of Dayti, a negro nation on one
of the West India Islands. This is a
part ofthe programme of tho N. Eng
land Abolitionists long ago set forth
by Red path, in order to form one of
tbe links of tbe cordon tbat surrounds
slavery in the U. S. So it is not an
original idea, with the President. It
also recommends the independence
of the Government of Liberia, another
Negro Government. It is a pity there
wasn't a few more Negro Govern
ments to ackcowledge the indepen
dence of. Hayti has been a Negro
Government for 60 years, and has not
been recognizea by any ol our frost
