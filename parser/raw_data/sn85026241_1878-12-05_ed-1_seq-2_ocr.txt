THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
An Able Paper With the Right
Ring.
Fdlow Citizen of tie Seiuile auJ Ibm e
of liepr&stntatittz:
Our heartfe lt gratitude is duetoth
Divine being, who holds in His hands
the destinies of nations, for the con
tinued bestowal, during the last year,
jf countless blessings upon ourcouutry.
We are at peace with a.l oilier na
tions. Our public credit has greatly
improved, and is, perhaps, cow strong
er than ever before. Abund.iut har
vests have rewarded the labors of tha-iti
who till the soil, our manufacturing
industries are reviving, and it Is be
lieved that general prosperity, which
has been so long looked for, is at ltst
ffithin our reach.
THE YELLOW FEVER.
The enjoyment of health by our peo
ple generally has, however, been in
terrupted, during the past season, by
the prevalence of a fatal pestilence, the
yellow fever, in some portions of the
Southern States, creating an emergen
;y which called for prompt and extra-
ordinary measures of relief. The dis'
jase appeared as an epidemic at New
Orleans and at other places on the low
it Mississippi, soon after midsummer.
It was rapidly spread oy fugitives from
.he inlocted cities and towus. and did
lot disappear until early in November.
The states of Louisiana, Mississippi
ind 1 ennessee have suffered severely
About one hundred thousand ca-es are
oelieved to have occurred, of which
tbout twenty thousan 1, according to
ntellizent estimates, proved fatal. It
is impossible to estimate with any ap'
proach to accuracy the loss to the courr
:ry occasioned by this epidemic. It
to be reckoned by the hundred millions
f dollars. The suffering and destitu
sion that resulted, excited the deepast
-ympathy in all parts of tho Union
Pnysicians and nurses hastened from
jvery quarter to the assistance of the
ifilllcteu communities. Voluntary e.m
cributions of money and supplies, ia
every needed form, were sp;edi!y and
onerously furnished. The (Jjvern
meat was able to respond in some
measure to the call for help, by provi
ling tents, medicines, and food for the
ik and destitute, the requisite Uirve
tionsfortbe purpose beinjr given, in
:Le confident expectation thit tlris ac
cion of the Executive would re.ceiv
the sanction of Gmgress. About 1800
tents, and rations of the value of about
$2-5.000. were sent to tho cities aad
;owns which applied for then, full de
tails of which will be fumisned to V a
iress by the proper Dpirtment.
The fearful spread of this pestilence,
aas awakened a very gnnerai puon
4entlment In favor of national smiu
t.lminlstration, which shall not only
tontrol quarantine, but hve the satu
tary supervision ol internal commerce
in times of epidemics, and hold an ad
visory relation to the State and muni
ipal health authorities, with power to
leal with whateverendangers tne pub'
lie health, and which the municipal
nd State authorities am uunable t5
regulate. The national quarantine uc
approved Aoril 2!). 188. which was
riaased too late in the last session ol
C ingress to provide the means for car
ryiug it into practical operation.during
the past season, Is a step in the l;ree'
tlon here in'iicated. In view of the
necessity for the most effjetive mens'
ures, by quarantine and otherwise, for
the protection of our seaports, and the
country generally, from this and other
epidemics, it is reeommended that
Congress give to the whole subject ear
ly and careful consideration.

ELECTIONS IN THE SOUTH.
The permanent pacification and. the
complete protection ol all citizens in
every civil and politic il right eouunut-s
to be of paramount interest witii the
great body of our people. Every step
in tnts direction is welcomed witn puo
lie approval, and every interruption of
steady and uniform progress to tne de
sired consummation awakens general
uneasiness and wide-spread condemns'
tion. The recent Congressional elec
tions have furnished a direct and trust1
worthy test of the advance thus far
made in the practical establishment ot
the right of suffrage, secured by the
Constitution to the liberated raceiu the
Southern States. All disturbing influ
ences, real or Imaginary, had been re'
moved from all ol these States.
The three constitutional amend
ments, which conferred freedom and
equality of civil and polilicnl rights
upon the colored people of the South,
were adopted by the concurrent actiou
of the great body of gotKi citizens who
maintained the authority oitiieiNa
tional Government and the integrity
and perpetuity of the Union at such a
cost of treasure and life, as a wise and
and necessary embodiment in the
organic law of the just results of the
war. Thepeopleof theforuier slave
holdiBg States accepted these results,
and gave, in every practicable form,
assurances that the thirteenth, four
teentb, and flfteeetb amendments, and
laws passed in pursuance thereof,
should, in good faith, be enforced,
rigidly and impartially, in letter and
pint, to the end that the humblest
citizen, without distinction of race or
color, should, under them, receive full
an i equal protection iu person and
property and in political rights and
privileges. By the constitutional
amendments, the Southern section ol
the Union obtained a large increase of
political power in Congress and in the
Electoral College, and the country
ustly - expected that elections would
proceed, as to the enfranchised race,
upon the same circumstances of legal
and constitutional freedom and protec
tion which obtained in all the other
States of . the Union. The friends of
law and order looked forward to tie
conduct of these elections, as offering w
the general judgment of the country
an important opportuniiy to measure
the degree in which the right ofsuff
rage, could be exercised by the colored
people, and would be respected by their
teliow'citizens; but a more general en
joyment of freedom of suffrage by the
colored people, and a more just and
generous protection of that freedom by
the communities oi which they form a
part, were generally anticipated than
the record of the elections discloses. In
some of those States in which the color
ed people have been unable to make
their opinions felt iu the elections, the
result is mainly one to; influences not
easily measured or remedied by legal
protection; out in the States of Liouisr
ana and South Carolina at large, and
some particular Congressional dia
tricts outside of those States, the records
the elections seems to compel the
conclusion that the rights of the color
voters have been overriden, and
their participation in the elections not
permitted to be either general or fre,
It will bo for the tJongress for which
these elections are held, to make eu h
examinations into their conduct as may
appropriate to determine tne
validity of the claims of members to
their seats. In tho meanwhile it be
comes the duty of the Executive and
Judical Departments of the Govern-
ment, each in its province, to inquire
into and punish violations of the lawB
the United Slates which have oc
curred. I can but repeat what I said
this connection in my last message,
that whatever authority rests with mt
this end I shall not
hesitate to put forth, and I am unwill
ing to forego a renewed appeal to the
legislatures, the courts, the executive
authorities, and the people of tho Slates
where these wrons have been perpe
trated, to give their asaistancG toward
bringing to justice the offenders and
preventing a repetition of the crimes.

ENFORCEMENT OF ELECTION LAWS.
It is to be observed that the principal
appropriation made for the Department
of Justice at its last session contained
tne following clause: "And for defray
ing the expenses which mav be incur-
rd ia the enforcement of the act ap
proved February twenty-eighth, eigh
teen hundrel and seventy-one, en
titled 'An act to amend an act approv
ed May thirtieth, eighteen hundred
and seventy, entitled An act to enforce
the rights of citizens of United States
to vote in the several States of the
Union, and for other purposes,' or any
ai ts amendatory thereof or supplemeu
tory thereto.
It is the opinion of Attorney-Gen
eral that the expenses Of these proceed
ings will largely exceed the amount
which was thus provided, and I rely
confidently upon Congress to make
adequate appropriations to enable the
Executive Department to enforce tht
laws.
I respectfully urge upon your atten
tion that the Congressional election-",
in every district, in a very Important
seuse, are justly a matter of political
interest and concern throughout the
whole country. Each State, every
political party, is etui: led to the share
of power which is conferred by the
legal and Constitutional suffrage. It is
tne right of every citizen, possessing
the qualifications prescribed by law, to
cast one uutimidated ballot, and to
have his ballot honestly counted. So
long as the ex-rcN .f t;,h power and
tne enjoyment of ims i;;it arecom
mon oud tq jai, prucl'caliy as well as
formally, subpiission to the results ot
suffrage will be aceorded loyal;y and
oheerfuily, and all the departments ol
Government will feel the true vigor ol
the popular --iil thus exyresed. No
temporary or administrative interests
of Govern niut, however urgent or
weighty, will ever displace the zeal of
of our people In defence of tho primary
rights ol citizenship, l hey understand
that the protection of liberty requires
the maiutainance, in full vigor, of the
manly methods of free speech, free
suffrage, aud will sustain the full
authority of Government to enforce
the laws which are framed to preserv

heads oi the several departments, be'

The report of the Secretary of the

of the operations ot that department of

ever, a substantial compliance with the
conditions ol the law. By its terms.
tne public debt should have been re
duced betweau 1862 and the close of
the last fiscal year, $-j1S,361,806.2S; the
actual reduction of the ascertained
debt, in that period, has been 720,644,
739.61; being in excess of ihe reduction

$202,282,933.33.
Th i amount of tha public debt, less

12,024,200,083. 18-a reduction since the
same date 1 ist year, of 23,150,613.30.
Ihe progress made during the last
year, in refunding tho public debt at
lower rates of interests, is very gratify
ing. The amouut of 4 per cent bonds
sold during the preseat year prior to
November 23,188, is $10O,27O,9OO,and 6
per cent bonds, commonly known as
five-twenties, to an equal amount. have
been or will be redeemed as calls ma
ture. It has been the policy of the depart
ment to plac3 the 4 per ceut bonds
within easy reach of every' citizen who
desires to invest his r-avin r3. Whf ther

Secretary of the Treasury reco.nmeuds
that the law be so modified, that small
sums, may be Invested, and that

nity may ne given in all parts of the
coun'ry lorsui-h investments.
1 lie best mode suggested is. that the
leparimeiii oe authorized to issue cer
tificates of deiio.-it, of the denomin i
tion ot ten do.lars, bearing interest at
rate of 3.0jper cent per annum, and
coiiveriioio at any time Wltnin one
year after their iisue into tho 4 per ct.
bonds authorized by the refunding HCt.
to be issued only in exchange for
united states notes sent to the treasu
by mail or otherwise. Such a pro
vision of law, siu.ported by suitable
regulations, would enable any person
readily, without eo-t or rislc, to convert
money into an interest-bearing se
curity of the United States, and the
money ho received i-ou.d be applied to
redemption of six per cent bouds.
The coinage of gold during the but

the
fiscal year was $52 798,030. The coin
age of silver dollars, under tha act
passed Feb. 28, 1S78, amouoted on the
23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550,
of which amount $4,084,847 are in cir
culation, and the balance, $14,829, 003,io
still in the possession ot the Govern
ment, With views unchanged with regard
to the act under which the coinage of
silver proceeds, it has been the pur
pose of the S-.creUry faithfully to ex
ecute the law, and to afford a fair trial
to the measure.
In the present financial condition of
the country, I am persuaded that the
welfare of legitimate business aud in
dustry of every description will be best
promoted by abstaining from all at
tempts to make radical changes in the
existing financial legislation. Let it be
understood that during the coming
year the business of the country will be
undisturbed by governmental interfe
rence with the laws affecting it, and
e may confidently expect that the
resumption ot specie payments, which
will lake place at the appointed time,
will be successfully and easily main
tained, and that it will be followed by
a healthful aid enduring revival ol
business prosperity.
Let the healing influence of time.the
inherent energies ot our people, and
the boundless resources of our country,
have a fair opportunity, and relief from
present difficulties will surely tollow.
The report of the Secretary of Wai
shows that the army has been well and
economically supplied, that our small
force has been actively employed, and
has faithfully performed all toe service
required of it. Tne morale of the ar
my has improved, and the number of
deserters has materially decreased du
ring the year.
PRESERVATION OF TIMBER.
I invite the attention ot Congress to
the recommendations made by the Sec
retary of the Interior with regard to
the preservation of the timber on the
publ c lands of the United Slates. The
protection oi the puouc property is one
of the first duties of the Government,
The Department of the Interior should,
therefore, be enabled by sufficient ap
propriations, to enforce the laws in
that respect. But this matter appears
still more important as a question oi
public economy. The rapid destruc
tion of our forests is an evil lraught
ith the gravest consequences, espe
cially in the mountaiuous districts.
here the rocky slopes.once denuded ol
trees, will rainaiu o forever. Tuere
the injury once done, cannot be
repaired. I fully concur with the Sec
retary of the Interior in the opinion
that, for this reason, legislation touch
ing the public timber iu tho mountain
ous States and Territories of the West,
should be especially well considered
aud that existing laws, ia which the
destruction of the forests is not suffici
ently guarded agaiust,should be 3 peed i
ly modified. A general law concerning
this important subject, appears tome
so tie a matter of urgent public noces'
sity.
AGRICULTURE.
From the organization of the Gov
eminent, th-.i importance ot encourag
iug, by all possible means, the increase
of our agricultural productions has
beeu ackuowleged and urged upon the
attention of Ceagress aud the
people as the surest aud readiest means
ol increasing our substantial and en
during prosperity.
the words ot Washington areasap
plicable to'day as when, iu his eighth
annual message, be said: "It is not to
be doubted that with reference either
to individual or national welfare, agri
culture Is of primary importance. In
proportion as natious advance in popu
lation and other circumstances of
maturity, this truth becomes more
apparent, aud renders the cultivation
ot the soil more and more au object ot
public patronage. Institutions for
promoting it grow up, supported by
the public purse and to what object
can n be dedicated with greater
propriety? Among tbe means which
have been employed to this end, none
haye b3en attended with greater suc
cess than the establishment of boards,
com p'ised of proper chir acters, charged
with collecting and ilirtusiug in tor to a
tion, and euabled, by premiuums and
small pecuniary aids, to encourage and
assist the spirit oi discovery und lm
provement, this species of establish
ment contributing doubly to the in
crease of improvement, and by draw
ing to a common centre the . results
everywhere of individual sciil and
observation, and spreading them
thence over the whole uation. Ex
perience accordingly hath shown lhat
they are very cheap instruments of im
meuse uatioual benefit."
The great preponderance of the agri
cultural over any other interest iu the
United States entitles it to all the con
sideration claimed for it by Washing1
toa. About one-half of the Lobulation
of the United States is eugigi-d in agri.
culture. The vuiui of tne agricultural
products of tue United States lor tbe
year 1878, is estimated at three thou
sand millions of dollars. Ihe exports
of agricultural products for the year
1877, as appears from the report of the
iiuruau of Statistics, were rive hundred
aud ttveutylour millions of dollars.
Ihe great extent ot our country, ,wifn
its diversity of soil aud climate, en
ables us to produce within our own
borders, and by our own labor, not
only tho necessaries but most ol the
luxuries that ate consumed in civilized
countries, let, notwithstauding our
advantages of soil, climate, and inter
communication, it appears irom statisti
cal statements in the report of the Com
nissioner of Agriculture, that we im
port .ntinually from foreign lands many
millions of dollars' 'vorth of products
which could he raised in our own
country.
.Numerous questions arise in the
practice of advanced agriculture which
cm only bo answered by experiments,
often costly and) sometimes fruitless,
which are byotid the means or private
ndividu-ils, and are j ist and proper
cinrge on trie whoio nation lor the

and introduce now agricultural indus

ORIGIN OF "THANKSGIVING."
How It Was Born in New England.
glillHl.
From the Boston Herald.
TliaiiKsgiving d iys, or thanksgiving
occasions, .v.ere uo doubt ot very early
origiu. aud it is more than probable
that the'Jewish Passover, Pentecost or
Whitsunday was the origin of "feast
ot thanksgiving for tne harvest."
which is -aid to have commenced im
mediately alter tho Possover. it fjr-
ebce is al-o made to thanksgiving oc
casions in various countries. Its orig
in ia this c juntry, if in fact it was
not Dr,u-nt ovr ry the nigrum, .was
not a tti I'lksiiviug day, butn thanks
giving occMsion. Th.J present custom
ota ttmnk-'giving.State or National, we
imigiu', is itrictly an American in
stitution, aud is generally so regarded,
and has grown out of the custom of
thanksgiving occasions. Ai early is
1Mb, and possibly at au earlier day. the
Allowing order was passed -by the
Court:
"New Plymouth, N.iv. 13.1636-
Where is at His Ma'tios Court, held
the 1 h m 1 5th of O.-tob'r in the 12th
yoare of the reigne of our sov. Lord
Uharls by thn grace of Go 1 King of
E ig He is,. if.-, it Id. D itoudor of the
ffaith," & ;., it w is "ordere i that it be
in the povver oi the Governor & Asst's
to co mm ml solemn dak's of hum lia
cou by fasting, and also tor thanks
giving as ojca-dou shall be offered-"
One or those occasions arose during
the Cromwellian wars in England .and,
uuderdito of Mirch 2. 16512. "the
court hade desired that a publicke day
ol thanksgiving throughout the colo
nies may bd observed therein to give
thanks to U ) l lor the great victories
graunted to the army ia behalfe of the
Parliament and Commonwealth ol
England."
In 1663, October 22, "The court take
ng notice of tho goodness of G xl to vs
in the continuance of our civil and re
ligious liberties, the general health
that wee hau enjoyed, and that it
bath pleased God in some comfortable
moasuro to bless us in the fruites of the
earth, doe conceiue that these and oth
er favors call upon us for returns of
thankfulness to the Lord, &a., propose
that the 2oth day ol November be kept
as a solemao day of lhauksgiuing with
respect to his goodness in the p'ticu
ares abouemenstoued, and what par
ticulare places and psons may propose
to themselues as causes of thankful
ness."
This, probably, was intended an the
regular Thanksgiving Day for the
year, which appears to have been es
tablished. In 1680 the General Court,
in somewhat similar terms, "doe pro
pound the twentieh day of October
nextensueing to becellibrated as a sol
emne day of thanksgiveing by all the
congregations in this colonic, " etc. In
1686 Thanksgiving was on the 3d of
November, and in 1089 on the 27th of
June, without any assigned reason
The next year it was in November, as
is now the custom, in lbsz it was en
acted "that none shall presume to at
tend servile worke or labor, or attend
any sports, on such days as aro or
shal- be appointed by the court for hu
miliatioo by fasting and prayer or for
public Thanksgiving, on penalty of
five shillings."
Thanksgiving Days and occasions
have been continued annually and oth
erwiso, and has for many years been
truly said of JNew Hineiand Thanks
