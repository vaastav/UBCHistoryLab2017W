The report of the secretary of the navy
shows continued improvement in that branch
of the service. During the last fiscal year
extensive repairs have been made upon ves
sels, and two new ships have been completed
ami made ready for sea. The total expendi
tures ended June :J0, H71). including specific
appropriations not estimated for by the de.
paltuient, were I ,:i."i:l..r7 1 M'.l. The expense

propria! ions available for the present fiscal
year are $ I t,5l)-J,2.iO.i7, which wili, in the
opinion of the secretary, answer all the or

secretary show the gratifying tact that among
all the disbursing ollicers of the pay corps of
the navy there is nut one who is a delimiter
to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with
him in recommending the removal of the ob
lervatory to a more healthful location. That
institution reflects credit upon the nation and
has obtained the approbation of scientific
nu n in all parts ot the world. Its removal
from its present location would not only lie
conducive to the health of its ollicers ami pro.
tensors but would greatly increase its useful
ness. Dl'.l'AHTMLYI' OK .ll'STtCK.
The appropriation for judicial expenses,
which has heretofore be"ii made for the de.
partment of justice in gross, was sub-divided
at the last session of congress and no appro
priation whatever was made for the payment
of the fees of marshal's mid their deputies,
either in the service of process or for I herds,
charge of other duties, and since June III)
these ollicers have continued the performance
of liheir duties without compensation
from the government, baking upon them
selves the necessary incidental outlays as
well as rendering their own services. In only
a few unavoidable instances has the proper
execution ol process of the I'nited Stales
Tailed by reason of the absence of the reipiis.
ite appropriation. This course of ollicial
conduct, on the part of these ollicers, highly
creditable to their fidelity, was advised by
the attorney general, who informed them,
however, that they would necessarily have
to rely for their compensation upon the pros,
pect of future legislation by congress. I
therefore especially recommend thai an im
mediate appropriation be made by congress
for tins purpose. The act making the prin
cipal appropriations for the department if
justice at previous sessions lias uniformly
contained the following clause, "and for de
fraying the expenses which may be incurred
m the enforcement of the act approved Feb.
28, 170, entitled, "an act to amend an act
approved May ;(), ly70, er.titled, "an net to
enforce the right of citizens in the I'nited
States to vote in the several states of the I'nit
ed States, and for other purpose, or any acts
amendatory thereot or supplementary iherc.
to." No appropriation was made for this
purpo-e for the current year. As no general
election fir members of congress occurred,
the omi-simi was a matter of little practical
imponsnee. Such election will, however,
taiie p!;ice during the ensuing year and the
aj.propriiti'in for the pay of marshals and
pu'.:'-s should be Mifiicicnt to embrace com-:j-
t .on for the wrvices they may be re-

THE MI'KKMfc COlllT.
TLr bMsine-s of the t-upremo court is at
r,re.;nt brg-Iy in arrears. It cannot be ex
p'twt that more cases can be decided than
are now di.ip-M-,! of m its annual session, or
that by any aviiduity the distinguished mag
istrate who compose the court can iiccoiii
plili more than ia now done in the courts of
many of the circuit. The tmsinesa has in
f rea.scd to such an extent that the delay of
justice will call the attention of congress to
an appropriate remedy. It is believed that
all in done in each circuit which can fuirlv
be exited, and the evil arising from de
lay are less lnwmlr felt by the United Males
titan by private suitor as its causes are ad
vanced by the court, when it is seen that
the involve the discussion of questions of
a public character. The remedy suggested
by the attorney general is the appointment
of additional circuit Judges aud the creation
of an intermediate court of errors and up.
peals, wUicfi shall relieve the supreme court
of a part of iu Jurisdiction, while a larger
force t-, also obtained for the performance of
circuit duties. 1 recommend this suggestion
to the consideration of congress. It would
seem Ui afford a complete remedy, and would
involve, if ten additional circuit judges are
appointed, an expenditure at the present rate
of salaries of not more than 0U,0uo a year
which would certainly be atnall In coinparb
son with the object to be attained.

testimony to the general revival or business
throughout the country. The receipt of the
postoffice department for the fiscal year end

$764,465.91 more than the revenue of the

sum of jf:i7tl,4;i.(i:S was paid on liabilities in
curred in preceding years. The expenditures
during the year were .f soi.'O!) 77 less Hum
in the preceding year. This reduction is to
lie attributed mainly to the operation of the
law passed on June 17, ISIS, changing the
compensation of postmasters from a commis
sion on the value of stamps sold to u com
mission on tin value of stampsc anceled. The
amount drawn from the treasury on appro
priations, in addition to the revenues of the
department, was $:i.i)::i,4"il.!)ii, being $'-V-7ii,-l!7.Ni

the department with railroad companies have
been iiaruioui.eil, notw ithstanding the gen.
era! reduction by congress, of their conipeii-
cation by the appropriation lor general fa
cilities, arid the railway poslolllce lines have
been greatly extended, especially in the
southern states. The interestsof the railway

the expenditures could he readily controlled
by the classification of the employes of the
railway mail service, us recommended by tin
postmaster general, the appropriations for
service with respect to which the maximum
limit is already llxel by law to be made in
gross. The postmaster general recommends
an ameielmeut to thu law regulating an in
crease of compensation for increased service
and increased speed on star routes, so as to
enable him to advertise tor proposals for such
increased service mid speed. Hi: also sug
gests llie advantages to accrue to the com
merce ol the country trom tne enactment ol
a generl law authorizing contracts with
American built steamers carrying the Ameri
can flag for transporting the mail between
the I'nited States anil parts of the West In
dies and South America at a fixed maximum
price per mile, the amount to be expended
being regulated by annual appropriations in
like manner with the amount for the domes
tic star service. The arrangements made by
the postmaster general and the secretary of
the treasury lor the collection or duties upon
books received in the mail from foreign coun
tries has proved so satisfactory in its practi
cal operation that the recommendation is
now irade that congress extend the pro.
visions of the act of March J!, 1S71I, under
which this arrangement was made so as to
apply to all other dutiable articles leceived
in the mails from foreign cnuntries.
TUB INDIANS.
The reports of the secretary-of the interior
and of the commissioner of Indian affairs,
setting forth the present state of our rela
tions with the Indian tribes on our territory,
the measures taken to advance their civiliza
tion and prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them, will be found of more
than ordinary interest. The general conduct
of our Indian population tias been so satis
factory that the occurrence of two disturb
ances which resulted in bloodshed and dis
traction of property is all the more to be la
mented. The history of the outbreak on
the White river I'te reservation m western
ddorado h is become so familiar by elabor
ate reports in thu public press that its re
markable incidents need not be stated here
in detail. It is expected that the settlement
of this difficulty will lend to such arrange
ments as will prevent further hostile contests
between the Indians and the border settle
ments in western Colorado. The other dis
turbances occurred at the Mescalero agency
in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of
a small baud id' marauders, after committing
many atrocities, being vigorously chased by
a military force, made his way across the
Mexican border and lsnmv on nforeiirn soil.
While these occurrences, in which a com
paratively small number of Indians were
engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majori
ty of our Indian population have fully justi
fied the c.vpections of those who believe that
by humane and peaceful inlhiences, the In
dian can he led to abandon toe habits of sav
age life, and to develop a capacity for useful
aud civili.ed occupations. What they have
already accomplished is shown in the pur
suit of agriculture and mechanical work.
The remarkable success which has attended
the experiment of employing as freighters a
class of Indians hithertu counted among the
wildest, and most intractable, and the gener
al and urgent desire expressed by them for
the education of their children may be taken
as sufficient proof that they will be found
capable of accomplishing much more if they
continue to lie wisely and fairly guided. The
Indian policy sketched in the report of the
secretary of the interior, the object of w hich
is to make liberal provision for the educa
tion of Indian youth, to settle the Indians
upon farm lots in severalty, to give them ti
tle in fee in their farms inalienable for a cer
tain number of years, and when their wants
are thus provided for to dispose by sale of
the lands on their reset vat ion not occupied
and used by them, a fund to be tunned out
of the proceeds for the Indians, which will
gradually relieve the government of the ex
penses now provided lor by annual appropri
ations, must commend itself ws just and ben
eficial to the Indians, and as also calculated
to remove those obstructions w hich the ex
istence of large reservations presents to l lie
settlement ami the development of the coun
try. I therefore earnestly recommend the
enactment of a law enabling the government
to give Indians a title in fee inalienable for
twenty-live years to the farm lands assigned
to them by allotment. I also repeat the re
commendation in my first annual message
that a law be passed admitting Indians who
can give satisfactory proof of having, by
their own labor, supported their families for
a number of years, and who are willing to
detach themselves from their tribal relations,
to the benefit of the homestead act, and to
grant them patents containing the same
provision of inalienability for a certain pe
nisl. The experiment of sending a number of
Indian children of both sexes to the Hamp
ton Normal and Agricultural Institue in Vir
ginia, to receive elementary Knglish educa
tion and practical instruction iu farming and
other useful industries, has led to results so
promising that it was thought expedient to
turn over the cavalry barracks of Carlisle,
in l'ennsylvania, to the interior department
for the establishment of an Indian school on
a larger scale. This school bos now one
hundred and titty-eight pupils, selected from
various tribes, mid is iu full operation. Ar
rangements are also made for the education
of ii uumlHTof Indian boys and girls belong
ing to tribes on the I'aeilic slope, in a simi
lar manner, at Forest drove, iu Oregon.
These institutions will commend themselves
to tfie lilierality of congress and to the phi
lanlhropic munificence of the American peo
ple. hast spring information was received of
the organization of an extensive movement
in the western states, the object of which
was the occupation by unauthorized persons
of certain lands in the Indian territory ced
ed by the Chcrokees to the government for
the purpose of settlement by other Indian
tribes. On the 'Jllth of April 1 issued a
proclamation warning all persons against
participation in such an attempt, and by the
cooperation of a military torce the invasion
was promptly checked. It is my purpose to
protect the right of the Indian inhabitants
ot that territory to the full extent of the ex
ecutive; hut it would be unwise toMgnore
the fact that a territory so large aud so fer
tile, with a population so sparse, and to
great a wealth of unused resources, wiil be
found more exposed to the repetition of such
attempts as happened this year when the aur
and the westward movement of our popula
tion looks still more cacerly for fresh lands
to occupy. Under such circumstances, the
dilllcully of maintaining the Indian Terrlto.
ry in its present slate will greatly increase,
and the Indian tribes inhabiting il would do
well to prepare for such a contigency. 1
therefore approve of th advice given to
them by the secretary of the interior on a re
cent occasion to divide among thcm-elves,
In severally, as large; a ipiantity of tneir
lands as ! 1 1 y can cultivate, to aeipiire indi
vidtlal title in fee, instead of their pre.-enl
tribal ownership iu common, and consider
iu what manner the balance of their lands
may be disp"sed of by the government for
their benefit. Uy adopting Mich a policy
they would more certainly secure for them
selves the value of their pos-'esnions, and a'
the same time promote their progress u civ
llization and prosperity than by endeavoring
to perpetuate the present state of timers in
the territory.
The question whether a change in tic- con.
trol of the Indian service should l.e made,
was, iu the forty-fifth congress, referred to a
joint committee of both houses for iniUirv
ami report. In my last annual inwssaue I
expressed the hope that the decision of that
question, then in prospect, would arrest fur
ther agitation of this subject, such agitation
being apt to produce ndisturbing i licet upon
the service as well as the Indians themselves.
Since then, the committee having reported
the question has been decided ill the nega
tive by a vote in the Iiomsu of representatives.
For the reason here stated, and iu view of
the fact that further uncertainly on this point
will be calculated to obstruct other much
needed legislation, to weaken the discipline
of the service and to unsettle salutary ineas.
ures now in progress for the government
and llie improvement of the Indians, I re
spectfully mainlined that thu decision ar
rived ut by congress at its last session be
permitted to stand.
TIMI1KK TIIKKTS.
The ell'orts made by the depaitinent of
the inferior to arrest the depredations on the
timber lands of the United Stales have been
continued, and have met with considerable
success. A large number of cases of tres
pass have been prosecuted in the courts ot
the I'niteu Slates. Others have been settled,
the trespassers olfering to make payment to
the government for the value of Hie timber
taken by them. The proceeds of these pros
ecuions and the settlements turned into the
treasury far exceed in amount the sums ap
propriated by congress for this purpose. A
more important result, however, consists in
the fact that the destruction of our public
forests by depredatson, although mch cases
still occur, has been greatly reduced in ex
tent, and it is probable that if the present
policy is vigorously pursued, and sullicient
provision to that end made by congress,
such trespasses at least those on a large
scale can be entirely suppressed, except in
territories where timber for thedaily require
ments of llie population cannot, under the
present state of the law, be otherwise ob
tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten
tion of congress to the recommedation made
by the secretary of the interior, that a law
he enacted enabling the government to sell
timber from the public lands without con
veying the fee where such lands are princi
pally valuable for the? timber thereon, such
sales to be so regulated as to cnulorm to do
mestic wants and business requirements,
while at the same time guarding against a
sweeping destruction of the forests. The
enactment of a law appears to become a
more pressing necessity every day,

My recommendations in former messages
are renewed in favor of enlarging the facili
ties of the depaitinent of agriculture. Agri
culture is the leading interest and permanent
industry of our people. It is to the abun
dance of agricultural product ons, as com
pared with our home consumption and the
largely-increased and highly-profitable mar
ket abroad which we have enjoyed in re
cent years, that we are maiuly indebted for
our present prosperity as it people. We
must look to its continued maintenance for
substantial resource. 1 here is no branch of
industry in winch labor, di reeled by scien
tific know ledge, yields such increased pro
duction in comparison w ith unskilled labor,
and no branch ol the public service to which
the encouragement of liberal appropriations
can be more appropriatly extended. The
omission to render such aid is not a wise
economy, but on llie contrary undoubtedly
results iu losses of immense sums annually
that might be saved through well-directed
efforts by the government to promote this
vital interest. The results already accom
plished, with the very limited means hereto
fore placed at the command of the depart
ment of agriculture, is an earnest of what
may be expected with increased npproprio
tions for the several purposes indicated in
the report of the commissioner, with a view
to placing the department upon a footing
which will enable it to prosecute more ef
fectively the objects for which it is estab
lished. Appropriations are needed for a
more complete laboratory, for the establish
ment of u veterinary division and a division
of lorestry and for an increase of force.
The requirements for these and other pur
poses indicated in the report of the commis
sioner, under the head of "Immediate Neces
sities of the Department," will not involve
any expenditure of money that the country
cannot with propriety now undertake in the
interests of agriculture.

It is gratifying to learn from the bureau
of education llie extent to w hich educational
privileges Ihroiighocl the United States
have been advanced during the year. No
more fundamental responsibility rests upon
congress than that of devising appropriate
measures of financial aid to education, sup
plemental to local action In the slates and
territories, and iu the District of Columbia.
The w ise forethought of the loiinders of our
government has not only furnished llie basis
for the support ot the common-school sys

IMS IKK T I IP I -ill, I Mill
In former messages, impressed with the
impoi lance of the ubj-ct, I have taken oc
caMon to recommend to cotc'iv the adop
tion of a generous policy toward the lbs.
trict of Columbia. The report of the com
missioned herewith transmitted contain
suggestions and recommendations to all ot
which I earnestly invite your, careful atten
tion. I aK your early and favorable con.
sider it ion of the view which they express
as to urgent need of legislation for the recla
mation of the uiai'she-i of llie i'oloniae and
its eastern branch within the limits of the
city, and for the repair of the streets of the
capital, hen toforc laid with wooden blocks,
and by delay rendered almost impassable
ami a source of imminent danger to the
citizens. The means at the disposal of the
commissioners are wholly inadequate for the
accomplishment of these important works,
and should be supplemented by timely up.
propriatioiis from the federal treasury. The
tilling of the flats in front of the cfty w ill
add to the adjacent lands and parks now
owned by the United States a large and val
uable domain, siiliVicut, it is thought, to re
imburse its entire cost, and will also, as an
incidental result, secure the permanent im
provement of the river for navigation. The
constitution having invested congress with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia, its citizens must, of
necessity, look to congress alone lor all need
ful legislation all'ecting their inteiests, and
as Uu; territory of this district is the com
mon properly of the people of the United
States, who, equally with its resident citi
zens, are interested in the prosperity of their
capital, I cannot doubt that you w ill be am
ply sustained by the general voice of Uie
country for any measure they may adopt for
the purpose.
1 also invite the favorable consideration of
congress to the wants of the public schools
of the district, as exhibited in the report of
the commissioners. While the number of
pupils is rapidly increasing, no adequate
provision exists for a corresponding Increase
of school accommodations, and the commis
sioners are without means to meet this urgent
need. A number of the buildings now used
for school purposes are rented, and are in
important particulars unsuited for the pur
pose. The cause of popular education in llie
District of Columbia is surely entitled to
the same consideration at the hands of the
national government as in several states and
territories, to winch munificent grants of
public lands have been made for the endow
ment of schools and universities.

Sckiu.nkk's MoNTiir.r. (Scritmur fc Co., New
Vork. 4 year.) Half a dozen or more year
ago New York commented thu ereetiou of iiBtate
capitol building ut Albany to cost four or five
miliums. As usual w ith huge public structures,
nnaeeoiuit in the original estimates was tuken
of the inevitable "(dealings" involved In such a
job, and the building has already cost over eight
millions, though fur from being completed. It
lias made sufficient progress, however, to show
wliut it is to be like, and in the December Serib
ner Mr. Montgomery Schuyler, with the aidofli'i
splendidly executed engravings, tells us all about
it. He ssys it is the finest building in the coun
try ami ''the most honorable work of public, ar
chitecture, it has to show." The John Hopkins
University ut Haltimore is the subject of a well
written paper by Mr. S. 15. Ileniek, and tells us
all about one of the most unique and valuable
educational Qirencie of the country. Mr. Hoyc-
sen contributes a very entertaining account of
"Two Visits to Victor Hugo," with a striking
porirsit of the latter. Herbert H. Smith con
cludes bis interesting series on Brazil by a paper
on Coffee Culture In that country. Hev. K. P.
Koe, the eminent horticulturist, contributes a
cental paper on "Success with ftnall Fruits."
The concluding half of K. C. Httdmau's critical
study of Iiayurd Taylor is given; and in the same
literary vein Mr. John Korroughs, in a charm

one collection some twenty poems by American
women, including many of our most prominent
writers.
In Action, Mr. James's "Confidence" progress

A New Kind or Watch Case,,
New because It Is only w ithin the last few years that it hs
been Improved and brought within the reach of everyone;
old In principle because the first Invention was made and
the first patent taken out nearly twenty years ngo, and cam-
made at that tlins and worn ever since arc nearly as goj
as new. Head the following, which is only one case of luab
hundreds. Your jeweler can tell of similar ones:
Mansfiklh, Fa., May 3sih. 1RTS.
I have a customer who has carried me of floss's Talent
Cases Ittteen vsars and 1 knew It two years before begot it,
and It now appears good lor ten years longer.

Remember .las. Boss's is the only Tau nt Case made of
two plates of solid gold (one outside and one Inside cover
ing every part closed to wear or sight. The great advan
tage of these solid plates over electro-gilding is apparent ts
every one. Iloss's is the only patent Case with which there
ts given a written warrant,
