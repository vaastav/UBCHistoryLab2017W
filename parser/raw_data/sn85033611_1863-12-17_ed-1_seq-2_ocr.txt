TBI fKtKRIOB REPORT.
1 fefer yon to the report of the Sec
retary of the Interior, which if here
with laid before you, for useful and
varied information in relation to the
public lands, Indian fFlrs, patents,
pension, and othr maltem of public
concern pertaining to tins department.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
The quantity of land disposed of du
ring the U.t, and the flret quarter of
the present fiscal year, was 3,641,549
acres, of which 161.91 1 acres w ere sold
for cash; 1,456,514 acres were taken
Vp under the hoiiietead law, and the
residue disposed of under the laws
granting lands for military bounties for
railroad and other purposes.
It appears that thv sale of the public
lands is largely on the im-reare. It has
Jong been a cherished ooinion or some
of our wiseat statesmen that (h people
of the United States had a higher and
more enduring interest in the early
settlement and substantial cultivation
of the public land, than in the amount
of direct revenue to be derived from
tire eate of them. This opinion has
had a controlling influence iu shaping
legialation on the subject of our nation
al domain. I may cite-, as evidence of
this, the liberal measures adopted in
eterence to actual settler. The grant
to the States of the oveiflowtd lauds
within their limits, in order to their be
ing reclaimed and rendered fit for cul
trvsAtoji; and the grant to railroad
contyaiUtifl of alternate sections of land
Upon the contemplated lines of their
paafc wlien completed, will, too, large
ly multiply the facilities for reaching
our distant posaensions. This policy
has received its most aigual, and bene
ficient illustration iu the recent enact
ment granting homeotea Is to actual
settler. Since the 1st day of January
last, the before mentioned quantity of
1,456,514 acres ot laud has been taken
ap under its provisions. This fact, and
the amount of sales, furnish gratifying
evidence of increasing settlement upon
the public land, notwithstanding the
great -etruggle in which the energies of
nation .have been engaged has re
quired so lare a withdrawal of our
aittaeoe from their accustomed pursuit.
I cordially concur in the recommen
dation OT fhe Secretary of the Interior,
suggesting a modification of the act in
favor of those engaged in the military
and naval service of the U'dted States.
I doubt not that Congress will cheer
fully adopt nch measures a will, with
out essentially changing the general
featares of the system, secure the
greatest practical extent of its benefits
to those who have left their homes in
defence of the country in this arduous
prists.

THK INDIANS.
The measures provided at your last
session for the removal of certain In
dian tribe have been carried into effect.
Sundry treaties have been negotiated,
which will, in due time, be submitted
far the constitutional action of the Sen

itinguishing the poaaeaeora rights of
the Indians to large and valuable tracts
of land. It is probable that the effects
of 'these treaties will result in the es
tablishment of a permanet friendly re
lation with such of these tribes as have
been brought into frequent and bloody
-collisions with our outlying settlements
and emigrant.
Sound policy, and our imperative
duty to these wards of government,
demand our anxious and constant at
tenrTon t their material well-being, to
theii progress in the arts of ci vilization,
aud, above all, to that moral training
Kk4oh, under the blestdng of Divine
Providence, will confer upon them the
.avejtlasfHkg and sanctifying influence,
the hope and oouaolgtiocs of the
Christian faith.
I suggested irT my last annual mes
sage the propriety of remedying our
lu iian yiem. S4cqacot events
have satisfied me of its necessity. The
Retails set forth in the report of the
Secretary, will evince the urgent need
for immediate legislative action.

THK SHIP CANAL.
The attention of Congress, during
the last session, was engaged to some
e-xim with a proposition for enlarging
the water communications between the
Mississippi River and the northeastern
Seaboard, which proposition, however,
failed tor some time. Since then, upon
a call of the greatest respectability, a
convention has been held at Chicago
upon the same subject, a summary of
whose viewa is contained in a memorial
addressed to the President and Con
gress, and which I no have the honor
o lay before you. That this interest
is one which, era long, will force its
own way, I do not entertain a doubt ;
while it is submitted entirely to your
Wisdom as to what can be done now.

subject by actual commencement of
work upon the Pacific. Railroad under
auspices so favorable to its rapid prog

great road.

I transmit the second annual report
of the Commissioner of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, aidtingyour atten

interest of the nation.
THK REBELLION'.
When Congress assembled a year
ago, the war had already lasted nearly
twenty months, ahd thefe had been
many conflicts on both land and sea,
with Varvinor results. The rebellion
had been pressed back into reduced
limits ; yet the tone of public feeling
Ind opinion, at home and abroad, was
not satisfactory. With other signs,
the popular elections, then just passed
indicated uneasiness among ourselves,
while amid much that was cold and
menacing, the kindest words coming
from Europe were uttered in accents of
pity that we were blind to surrender
our commerce, which was suffering
greatly from a few arnied vessels which
were built upon and furnished from
foreign shores ; and we were threatened
with such additions from the same
quarters as would sweep our trade from
the sea and raise our blockade. We
had failed to elicit from European gov
ernments anything hopelul upon this
subject.
The Emancipation Proclamation,
which was issued in September, was run
ning its assigned period to the beginning
of a new year. A month later the final
proclamation came, including the an
nouncement that colored men of a suit
able condition would be received into
the war service. The policy of eman
cipation and employing black soldiers
gavo to the future a new aspect, about
which hope and fear and doubt con
tended in uncertain conflict. Accor
ding to our political system, as a mat
ter of civil administration, the General
Government had no lawful power to
effect emancipation in any Stale, and
for a long time it had been hoped that
the rebellion could be suppressed with
out resorting to it as a military meas
ure. It was all the while deemed pos
sible that the necessity for it mightcome,
and that, if it should, the crisis of the
contest would then be presented. It
came, and, as was intended, it was fol
lowed by dark and doubtful days.
Eleven months have been passed. We
are permitted to take another review.
The rebel borders are pressed still fur
ther back, and, by the complete open
ing of the Mississippi river, the coun
try dominated over by the rebellion is
divided into distant parts, with no prac
tical connection between them Ten
nessee and Arkansas have been sub
stantially cleared of insurgent control
and influence, and the citizens in each,
and owners of slaves and advocates of
slavery at the beginning of the rebel
lion, now declare openly for emancipa
tion in their respective States. Of
those States not included in the eman
cipation proclamation, Maryland and
Missouri, neither of which, years ago,
would tolerate any restraint np:n the
extension of slavery into the new Ter
ritories, only dispute now as to the best
mode of removing it withiu their own
limits.
Of those who were slaves at the be
ginning of the rebellion, fully one huud
red thousand are now in the United
States military service, about one-half
of which number actually bear arms
in the ranks, thus giving the double
advantage of taking so much labor
from the insurgent cause, and supply
ing the places which must otl'erwise
be filled with so many white men. So
far as tested, it is difficult to say that
they are not as good soldiers as any.
No servile insurrection, or tendency
to violence or cruelly, has marked the
measures of emancipation and arming
the blacks. These measures have been
much discussed in foreign countries,
and, contemporary with such discussion
the tone of public sentiment there is
much iinprovd. At home the same
measures havo been fully discussed,
suported, criticised, and denounced;
and the annual elections billowing are
highly encouraging to those whose spe
cial doty it is to boar the country
through this great trial.
Thus we have the reckoning. The
cirtds which threatened to divide the
friends of the Union is past. Looking
now to the present and future, and
with reference to a resumption of the
national authority withiu the States
wherein that authority has been sua
pended, I have thought fit to issue a
proclamation, a copv of which is here
with transmitted. On examination of
this proclamation, it will appear as is
believed, amply justified by the Con
stitution. True, the form of an oath is
given, but no man is coerced to take it.
A man is only promised a pardon in
ra.-e he voluntarily takes the oath, the
Constitution authorizes the Executive
to grant on such terms as are fully es
tablished by judicial and other author
ity. It also provides, that if in any
of the States named a real goverment
shall be in the mode prcsuriped set up,
such goverment shall be recognized
and guaranteed by the United States,
and that under it the State shall be
protected against invasion and domes
tic violence. The constitutional obliga
tion ot the United States guarantees
to every State in the Union a Repub
lican form of Goverment, and to pro
tect the State in the case stated, is ex
plicit 'and full; brt why tender the
benfits or this provision only to a State
goverment set up in this particular way?
This section of the Constitution con
templates wherein the element within a
State favorable to a Republican govern
ment in the Union may be too feeble
for an opposite and hostile element in
the exterior, and even within the State.
Such are precisely the case with
which wo are now dealing.
An attempt to guarantee and protect
a revised Slate Goverment constructed
in whole or a preponderating part from
the very element against whose hostil
ity and violence it is to be protected, is
simply absurd.
There must be a test by which to
seperate opposing elements so as to
build only from the sound, and that test
is a sufficiently liberal one which ac
cepts as sound whoever will make a
sworn recantation of his former un
soundness. But if it be proper to propose as a
test of admission to the political body,
an oath of allegiance to the Constitution
of the United States and the Union
under it, why not also to the laws and
proclamations in regard to slavery?
These laws and proclamations were
devised and put forth for the purpose
of aiding the snnuression of the rebel
lion and to give them their fullest effect I
there hsd to be a pledge for their mam-1
tai nance. In my judgment they have
aided, and will further aid the cause
for which they were enlisted. To give
up this principle would be not only to
relinquish a lever of power, but would
also be a cruel and astonishing breach
of faith.
I may add at this point that while I
remain in my present position I shall
not attempt to retract or modify the
Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall
I return to slavery any person who is
free by the terms of the Proclamation,
nor by any act of Congress.
For these, and other reasons, it is
thought best that the suport ot these
pruvmions snan oe included in me oain,
and it is believed that the Executive
may lawfully claim it in return for par
don and restoration of forfeited rights,
which he has clear constitutional power
to withhold altogether, or grant upon
the terms which he shall deem wisest
for the public interest.
It should bo observed, also, that
this part of the oath is subject to the
modifying and abrogating power of
legislation and supreme judicial deci
sion. The proposed acquiescence of
the National Executive in any honora
ble temporary State arrangements for
the freed people, is made with the view
of possibly modifying the confusion and
desolation which must at first attend
all classes by a total revolution of labor
throughout the whole States.
It is hoped that the already deeply
afflicted peoble in these States may be
somewhat more ready to give up the
cause of their afflicton, and to this ex
tent this vital matter is left to them
selves. While no power of the Na
tional Executive to prevent an abuse
is abridged by the proposition, the sug
gestion in the proclamation as to man
aging tho political framework of the
States, or what is called reconstruction,
is made iu the hope that it may be
good without the danger of harm, and
will save labor and avoid great confu
sion. But any proclamation upon this ques
tion is beset with the conflicting views
that the step might be delayed too long,
or taken too soon. Some elements for
resumption seem ready for action, but
remain inactive apparently, for want
of a rallying point or a plan of action.
Why shall I adopt the plan of A rath
er than of B ; and if A and B should
agree, how can they know that the
general Government, hero will respect
their plan? By the proclamation, a
plan is presented which may be accep
ted by them as a rallying point, and
which they are assured iu advance will
not be rejected here. This may bring
them to act sooner than they otherwise
would.
The objection to a premature presen
tation of a plan by the national exe
cutive, consists in tho danger of com
mittal, or what could be moro safely
left to further developments. Care has
been taken to so shape the document
as to avoid embai rassment from this
source.
In saving that on certain terms cer
tain classes will bo pardoned, with their
rights restored, it is not said other
classes on other terms will ever be in
cluded.
In savins a reconstruction will be
accepted it presented in- a specified
wav. it is not eaitl it will never be ac
cepted in any other way.
The movements in State action for
emancipation in several of theStatesnot
included in the Emancipation Procla
mation, arc matters of profound grati
fication ; and while I no not repeat in
detail what I have heretofore so earnest
ly urged on this subject, mv general
views and feelings remain unchanged,
and I trust that Congress will omit no
fair opportunity of aiding these impor
tant steps to tho great consummation.
In the midst of other cases, however
important, we must not lose sight of
tho fact that the war power is still oar
main reliance, lo that power alone
can we look yet, for time to give confi
dence to the people in the contested
regions that the insurgents power will
not again over run them. Until that
confidence shall bo established, little
can be done anywhere for what is called
"Reconstruction." Hence, our chief
care must still be directed to our army
and nany, who have thus far borne
themselves so nobly and well. And it
may be esteemed fortunate that in giv
ing the greatest efficiency to their in
dispensable arms, we do also honora
bly encourage tho gallant men, from
commander to sentinel, who compose
them, and to whom, more than all
others, the world stands indebted for
the home of freedom disenthralled, re
generated, enlarged and perpetuated.

1st, lt2.
The President's Message.
We give in this issue, the annnal
message of President Lincoln, and the
supplementary proclamation thereto
addressed to repentant rebels. The
message is a remarkably straight-forward
and statesmanlike paper, and will
commend itself to every loyal man.
After devoting the first half of the
Messnge to the disenssion of usual and
ordinary topics of public business, the
President gives a calm and thorough
review of the rebellion, what has been
done for its extinguishment in the past
year, and then comes to the important
topic of its radical cure, and the work
of reconstruction. This having been
discussed in the Message, is formally
embodied in the Proclamation. It will
gladden the heart of every loyal man
to know that the Emancipation Proc
will be sus tained by all the power of
the Government. No slave freed under
its provisions will be reduced again to
servitude.
The plan proposed by the President
in the proclamation offering amnesty
and pardon to the main body of the
rebels, will, we think, commend itself
to the sober consideration of the coun
try, and be very generally approved
by earnestly loyal men everywhere.
We ask for the entire document the
earnest perusal of our readers.
The Classes Under the Draft to be
Abolished
It is now believed that Congress will
repeal not only the $300 clause in the
Conscription Act, but al60 the clause
dividing men into two classes. All
able bodied men between the ages of
20 and 45 would then be placed on an
equality, and bo liable under tho first
draft. Such a proposition is now un
derstood to be beforo the House.
It is altogether likely, therefore, that
the approaching draft, if we don't fill Bp
our quota with volunteers, will apply to
those between 35 and 45 years of age,
as well as to their younger brethren.
idff The Chesapeake steamer ply
ing out of Portland, took on board a
few days since a full list of passengers,
who proved to be rebels in disguise,
whose purpose was, and was carried
out, to seize the steamer and convert
the boat and cargo to rebel uses. The
plot succeeded well, and the captor?
got a rich prize. The utmost exer
tions are being made by our naval au
thorities to recapture the missing ves
sel. No full details of the daring ad
venture are yet given, though the Cap
tain and crew of the Chesapeake, put
ashore at St. John's N. B. havo reached
Boston. Tho captors were armed, and
ready for any emergency or resistance.
Instead of being deemed a strange and
incredible occurrence, it is only won
derful that the rebels have not before
now resorted to this obvious to this ob
vious, and not extraordinarily danger
ous, mode of seizing passenger steam
ers running out of Federal ports. The
chase of the Chesapeake is embarked
in by a score of Federal vessels, and
she may be recaptured. A dispatch
reports her at a port in the Provinces,
where she unsuccessfully attempted to
procure coal.
t seems at last certain that
John Morgan did not go to Toronto,
but "on the contrary quite the reverse1'
set his face towards Dixie, where ere

for fresh mischief. He will take good
care however, that this propensity does
not again tako him north of tho Ohio

Amnesty and Pardon to all Lesser
Traitors.
Whereas, In and by the Constitu
tion of the United States, it is provided
that the President shall have power to
grant reprieves and pardons for offences
against the United States, except in
cases of impeachment, and
Whereas, A rebellion now exists
wherebv the loyal State governments
of several States have for a long time
been subverted, and many persons
have committed and are now guilty of
treason against the United States ;
and
Whereas, With reference to said re
bellion and treason, laws have been
enacted by Congress, declasing for
feitures and confiscation of property
and liberation of slaves, all upon terms
and conditions theiein stated ; and also,
declaring that the President wan there
by authorized at any time thereafter,
by proclamation, to extend to persons
who may havo participated in the ex
isting rebellion, in any State or part
thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such
exceptions and on such terms and of
such conditions as he may deem expe
dient for the public welfare, and
Whereas, The Congressional decla
mation for limited and conditional par
don accords with well-established judi
cial expositions of the pardoning pow
er; and whereas, with reference to
said rebellion, the President of the
United States has issued several proc
lamations, with provisions in regard to
the liberation of slaves; and,
Whereas, It is now desired by some
persons heretofore engaged in said re
bellion to resume their allegiance to the
United States, and reiuaugurate loyal
State Governments, within and for
their respective States,
Therefore I, Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, do pro
claim, declare, and make known to all
persons who have directly, or by impli
cation, participated in the existing re
bellion, except as hereinafter excepted,
that a full tardon is granted to
them, and each of them, with restora
tion of all rights, if third parties shall
have intervened, and upon the condi
tion that they, such persons, shall lake
and subscribe an oath, and thencefor
ward keep aud maintain said oath in
violate, and which oath will bo regis
tered for permanent preservation, and
shall be of the teuor and effect follow
ing, to-wit:
the oath.
I do solemnly swear, in the presence
of Almighty-God, that I will hence
forth faithfully support, protect and de
fend the Constitution of the United
States, and the Union of States there
under, and that 1 will in like manner
abide by and fuithfullv support all acts
of Congress passed during the existing
rebellion, with reference to slaves, so
long and so far as not repealed, modified
or held void by Congre,or by decision
of the Supreme Court, and that I will
in like manner abide by, and faithfully
support all proclamations of the Presi
dent made during the existing rebellion
having reference to slaves, so long and
so far as not modified or declared void
by decisions of the Supreme Court, so
help me God.
The persons excepted from the ben
efits of the foregoing provisions, are :
1. All who are or have been civil or
diplomatic officers, or agents of the so
called Confederate Government.
2. All who have left Judicial sta
tions under the United States to aid
the rebellion.
3. All who are, or shall have been,
military or naval officers of the rank of
Colonel in the army, or Lieutenant in
the navy.
4. All who left seats in the United
States Congress, to aid in their rebel
lion. 5. All who have engaged in any way
in treating colored pcrsous, or white
persons in charge of such, otherwise
th?n lawfully as prisoners of war, and
which persons may be found in the
Uuited States service as soldiers, sea
men, or in any other capacity.
I do further proclaim, declare, and
make known,
1st. That whenever in any of tho
States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Geor
gia, Florida, South Carolina and North
Carolina, a number of persons, not less
than one-tenth of the nuqjber of jjjj
votes cast in such State at the Presi
dential election ot the year of our Lord
1860, each having taken the oath afore
said, and not having since violated it,
aud being a qualified voter by the laws
of the State, existing immediately be
fore the so-called act of secession, and
excluding all others, shall establish a
State Government, which shall be re
publican, and in no wise contravening
said oath, such shall be recognized as
the trfie form of Government of the
State, and the United States shall re
ceive them under the benefit of the
constitutional provisions which de
clares that the United States shall guar
antee to every State in the Union a re
publican form of government, and shall
protect each of them from invasion,
aud on application of the Legislature,
or the Executive when the Legislature
canuot be convened, against domestic
violence.
Second I do further proclaim, de
clare, and make known, that any pro
vision which may bo adopted by such
State Government, iu relation to the
freed people of such State, which shall
recognize and declare their permanent
freedom, and provide for their educa
tion, and which may yet be consistent
as a temporary arrangement with their
present condition as a laboring, land
less and homeless class, will not be ob
jected to by the national Executive,
and it is suggested as not improper
that in the construction of aloval State
Government in any State, the state of
tne boundary, the subdivisions, the
constitution and the Federal code of
laws, as before the rebellion, be main
tained subject only to modification,
made necessary by the conditions here
in before stated, aud such others, if any,
not contravening such conditions which
may be deemed expedient by those
framing the new State Government.
To avoid misunderstanding, it m3y
lc proper to say that this proclamation,
so far a it relates to State governments,
has no reference to States wherein
loyal State governments have all the
while been maintained ; and for the
same reason it may be proper to say
that, whether members sent to Con
gress from any State shall be admitted
to seats, conventionally rests exclusive
ly with the respective Houses, and not
to any extent with the Executive, and
still further, that the proclamation is in
tended to present to the people ot the
States wherein the national authority
has been suspended and loyal State
governments have been subverted, a
mode by which the national anthority
over every loyal State Government,
may be established within said States,
or any of them, and while the mode
presented is the oest the Executive
can suggest, with his present impres
sions, it must not bo understood that
another possible mode would not be
accented.

side of the stream in full force. His
position, naturally a very strong one,
was found to be entrenched along his
entire line, his works being a continu
ation of those on the Rapidan, to turn

The enemy's position was too formida
ble to be carried by assault, aud after

to the north side of the Uapidan on

as well as the impracticability of the
