SWEETWATER, THURSDAY, DEC. IS, 1SG9
The Convention Bill.
A roecut act of the Legislature provides
thai an election shall be held at all desi"
noted places for holding elections in the
respective counties of the State, at which
every male citizen who has resided in the
county in which he may offer to vote, six
months next preceding the dav of election
bhull have tho right to yote for "Conven
tion" or. "No Convention," and at the
same time, and on the same ticko, to vote
for one delegate from each county, Mon
roe is entitled to one delegate, and if a
majority of all tho votes given in the State
are for "Convention' the law provides
that the delegates elected on that day
shall assemble in Nashville, to revise and
niueud the Constitution, ou the second
Monday in January next.
The law also provides: That all laws
requiring test oaths to enable persons to
becomo candidates for office, or requiring
judges and clerks of elections to take said
oaths, shall not apply to the election to be
held under this act.
That tho Constitution or form of gov
ernment which said Convention may adopt,
shall not Le of any Liuding furce or effica
cy until the same has bceu submitted to
and ratified by tho people of the State,
in such muniicr nnd at Buch time as the
Convention t-hall provide.
That in u 1 1 cases where the commission
er or sheriff fails or refuses, or from any
other cause fails to hold said election, it
shall be lawful for any freeholder to hold
said election, by summoning as many by
standers as may be necessary to hold said
election, all of whom shall 1 j freeholders.
Virginia.
Thero seems to be no doult, from the
Washington dispatches, that a bill will bo
passed by Congress, next week, for the ad
mission of Virginia into tha Union, and
soon thereafter the United States Senators
and Representatives will be sworn in, with
the exception of Messrs. Booker and Mc
Kenzic, whose seats are contested. It is
probable the admission of Virginia will bo
coupled with the condition precedent, that
tho State Constitution shall uotbe amend
ed by tho present Legislature. Ex-Governor
Wells recommends the passage of
the amnesty bill.
Convention or no Convention-
The Naslnillo Union anil American, says :
The friends of a Convention must bear in mind
that the Legislature 1ms not called a Convention
nor authorized its convening, but has only sub
mitteil tho iiiestion of Convention or No Conven
tion to the people, to be determined in favor of
the one or the other by their votes. It is there
fore absolutely necessary for the friends of a
Convention not only to vote for the candidate of
their choice, but also to have on their tickets in
plain words : "For Convention." The return
ing otlicers will also bear in mind that it is an
essential part of their duty to liiako duo return
of the votes fur an 1 against Convention, in the
same way that they make return of the votes for
candidates. The printers of tickets are also es
pecially requested to bear this in mind, and all
those who arc for a Convention will remember to
print it on tho ticket. ' '
Southern Steamship Line to Europe,
The Norfolk Board of Trade held a
meeting on the 3d iust., and passed reso
lutions pledging the aid of the Board to
the Mcditeranean and Oriental Steam Nav
igation Company, of New York, in estab
lishing a lino of Steamships from Norfolk,
Port ltoyal, Brunswick and other South
ern ports; approving of the bill to be pre
sented to Congress to incorporate and aid
the Company, and praying its passage by
both houses, and its approval by the Pres
ident. The bill referred to guarantees to this
company the conveyance of tho mails to
Southern States, which bonds are to be de
posited in the Postoffice Department ; pro
vides fur the carriage and proper treat
ment of immigrants; obtains the privilege
of purchasing steamships from tho govern'
meut condemned as useless to the Navy De
rartment, and guarantees that all opera'
tions of tho company "shall be carried on
in steamships built in our own country,
out of native material, by our own mo
clianics, and sailed under our own flag, by
our own citizens, nnd governed by laws
enacted by Congress.
The Fifteenth Amendment.
The I'nion and American says that the Radi
cals are playing a bold game to secure the rati
fication of the fifteenth amendment. They are
under the impression that one State is lacking
to complete the work, (iovernor liullocK is in
Washington laboring with terrible energy to se
cure this end, and accordingly wc find that Mr.
Morton, of Indiana, introduced a bill in the Uni
ted States Senate to provido for the reconstnic
tion of (ieorgia. It provides for the convening
of the old state Legislature, with the conditions
that no person shall be ndmhted to membership
who is unqualified under the fourteenth amend
ment, nor shall any one be excluded therefrom
on account of race or color, and then provides
that if said Legislature thus organized shall rat
ify the fifteenth amendment the State shall bo
admitted to representation in Congress. Now
Congress has just as much-right to reconstruct
the State of Kentucky in order to secure the as
sent of that State to the ratification of the fif
teenth amendment, as it has to reconstruct
Georgia. ""' ' '
The first bill to go to the President this session
for his denature is one for the relief of a man
interested in a patent fur the improvement of
pistols. It passed the Senate last March, and
was put through the House on the 9th, and sent
iu to the White House in the afternoon.
The President's Message.
President Grants' message is before the
people of the country. For the beueGt of
our readears, who have neither time nor
disposition to wade through it, we present
a summary.
The President recommends the prompt
admission of the Senators and Represen
tatives from Virginia, and expresses tho
hope that tho result of the elections in
Mississippi and Texas has been such as
will meet the approval of Congress.
He suggests the removal of tho tax on
incomes, but at a reduced rate, say three
per cent., aud the tax to expiro in three
years.
Ho says the immediate resumption of
specio payments is not desirable, though
it should be reached at tho earliest con
venient moment with a fair regard for the
interests of the debtor class. He recom
mends such legislation as will insure a
gradual return to specio payments and put
an end to fluctuation in tho value of cur
rency. To end tho fluctuation iu curren
cy values, ho recommends that authority
be given to the Treasury to redeem its
own paper at a fixed prico whenever pre
sented, and to withhold from circulation
all currency so redeemed until sold again
for gold. Our national rcsonrccs, devel
oped and undeveloped, should make our
credit the best in the world, aud the pub
lic debt could be paid in ten years, but it
is not desirable that the poople should be
taxed to pay it iu that time.
The message says: "As the United
States is the fieeest (?) of all nations, so
too its people, sympathise with all people
struggling for liberty and self-government ;
but while sympathizing it is duo to our
honor that we should refrain from enforc
ing views upon unwilling nations and from
taking an interested part without invita
tion iu the quarrels between different na
tions, or between Governments and their
subjects. Our course should strictly con-
'onn with strict justice and international
and local law. Such has been the policy
of tho administration in dealing with these
questions."
Regarding Cuba tho Presideut says :
"Notwithstanding the warm sympathy
entertained for her, tho contest at notime
assumed the conditions which would war
rant the existence of a de Jaclo political
organization of the insurgents sufficient to
justify a recognition of beligercncy. The
principal is maintained, however, that this
nation is its own judge when to accord the
rights ot beltgerency either to a poople
struggling to fico themselves from a gov
ernment they believe oppressive, or lo in
dependent nations at war with each other.
Ihe I nitcd States have no disposition to
interfere with tho existing relations of
pain to her colonial possessions."
Sweetwater,
We find the following article iu the
Kuoxvillc Whig of last Friday which will
explain itself:
I am glad to see you making such a val
uable paper for the masses. It suits the
merchant, the farmer, mechanic, trades
man and all. Every family should take
a copy.
It we believe what wo read in your pa
per, your city is improving rapidly. But
you 'must not forget there are two or more
live places along the lino of railroad in
East Tennessee Sweetwater aud Morris
town. I see your pork men have slaughtered
only about 1,000 hogs, while- here in our
little town and vicinity, boyd & Vaughn,
Browdor & Walker have slaughtered about
1,1500 and are still slaughtering.
Since our old friend Gen. Vaughn has
returned and commenced busiuess here,
the trade has been very fine. A great
many waggons have visited this market
from the near couutios in North Carolina
aud returned home loaded with merchan
dise from this place. The house General
Vaughn is in charge of, has sold as high
as 1,200 worth of goods in one day, while
other houses here have had a fine trade
also. No town on tho line of railroad has
a finer trade, from Bristol to Chattanoo
ga, nnd none is improving faster.
We have a live newspaper here, and bur
merchants advertise liberally. Old Mon
roe county is all right. Wc have nomi
nated James A. Coffin for tho Convention
who will be elected and make a good mem
ber.
We are proud to sea Col. Jos,' A. Ma-
brv running tliS race in your county. A
truer man to his friends don't live under
the sun, and a more noble, generous heart
ed man cannot bo found. Many poor reb
el prisoners can testify to his kind gene
rosity in aiding aud lending them money
while in Northern prisons. I kuow that
no true soldier should vote against him
Ho is a man that all have to love when they
find him out, and we know old Knox will
give htm a fine vote. Last Tennessee
.. . -. c
We sometimes meet with siiuplo and
ingenious expressions, of which it is hard
to say whether they should bo ranked with
the sayings of Jocrissc, or whether they do
not contain concentrated sense under the
appearance of a blunder. A young lady,
sent to a school where there was but one
other boarder, wrote home "Wo have so
many rules here that it is very hard for
only two girls to keep them. This sounds
like a bull, but on further rcfloction we
see that the larger the number of pupils
the more opportunities each one has for
evading the school regulations.

Secretary of State.
Tennessee in Washington.
Tho Washington -. telegraphic corres
pondent of the New York Tribune gives
us an intimation of what we may expect
from Congress relative to our local affairs.
The voters of the Stato having by an over
whelming majority rejected " Radicalism,
the effort is to be made in Congress to
have the State government "run" hy fed
eral authority. This correspondent un
der the date of Deo. 3, says :
"The Tennessee Republicans are to be
represented here, during the coming ses
sion of Congress, by several prominent
gentlemen from Nashville and other places
in the State, who have been selected to
present to the public men here the condi
tion of affairs iu their State. The Ten
nessee members are a unit in the denunci
ation of the conduct of the Tennessee Leg
islature, and tho policy by which they ob
tained power."
The following further extract from the
same correspondent, will show tho charac
ter of the representations which are being
made in Washington by the distinguished
Tennessee Republicans now there:
"It is stated that they are systematical
ly, though cautiously, repealing tho laws
by which equal rights to all tho citizens
of tho State have beon guaranteed. Re
cently an attempt was made to repeal the
law protecting the colored oitizens iu thoir
right to sit on juries or hold offico ; thirty
one votes out of seventy-two were obtain
ed for the repeal, but tho law is practi
cally a dead letter. The Legislature has
just re-cuacted the old vagrant law in an
offensive shape, providing that laboring
persons, who have njt contracted by t tin
first of Jatiu 'i-y for tho ensuing year, s'mll
bo hired or sold for that period to the
highest bidder. By another law the ten
ant of laud is not allowod to roiuove or
sell the crop until the landlord has beon
paid. Tho object is to keep colored far
mers under the land-owneis' heel. A law
inflicting penalties on common carriers has
been repealed, whioh protected the colored
person iu traveling; hereafter he can be
charged first-class fare, and put into any
sort of car, and no remedy exists. An
other law forbids voters from casting their
ballots elsewhere than iu the district where
they live. Heretofore the colored man
could go to tho county town, whero ho vo
ted with others of his. class, nnd. stood a
chance of protection ; now he must voto
under the eye of his employer, or run the
risk of being driven off if. ho was to vote
contrary to his wishes. . The representa
tive Republicans assert that every law now
on the statute-books' of their State sustain
ing equal rights before tho law will be re
pealed or nullified. Lcsdiug papers ad
vocating the election of delegates to tho
proposed Constitutional . Convention who
are opposed to negro suffrage, free schools,
and other rights now in possession of tho
people, ihey assert that more thau one
half of tho present Legislature are disqual-
inou iy tf.o fourteenth nmendmcntand tho
State constitution. Acoording to the
statements of those who , hold this view,
the principal Northern men who have been
active in Tennessee are leaving as rapidly
as possible, and tho condition of publio
sentiments and affairs generally grow worse
daily. It is the intention to secure pro
tection irom congress, and already a bill
to meet the caso in view has been pre
pared, and will, ,1)9, present(lvinvbqth
Houses at an early day;", t. ? ' ,t
now the Radicals carried IYIiasia-
sippi. ; ' '
The Vicksburg Times says the citizens
were unutterably surprised at tho uublush-
ing corruption, intimidation and fraud ex
ercised at the polls on the day of election.
Every avenue 'to tho ballot-box was
completely covered by a crowd of men, In
utter disregard of 'tho election order of
Gen. Ames. That order distinctly -de
clares that no voter, except in tho act of
depositing his vote, shall stand within
thirty feet of the polls. This regulation
was wholly ignored yesterday. But this
is a mere feather in weight of atrocity per
petrated by the Radical leader and their
tools. '
At the Courthouse, one of the principal
voting places in this city, the entrances to
the building itself (not the voting room'
were guarded by colored policemen ; and,
while the white Radical politicians were
permitted to circulate freely within tlie
building'nnd distribute Radical 'tickets
among the voters, the uatioual Republi
cans were refused admittance by Sheriff
Furlong and his subordinate caitihV'
On the Sheriff i enjoined the duty Of
enforcing the. election order of Gen. Ames,
but at no Voting place did wd find a single
white deputy ot4' policeman'. ''We' have
had occasion to commend heretofore the
good conduct of soma of our colored 'offi
cers of the -la w in -'Certain ''places and at
proper times, but that Wiey should have
been placed in exclusive charge of the
peace and, good 'order1 at the- jiolls," a t! 'a
timo like the" pfefienty id an election where
both whites and blacks vote, is too flagi
tious a piece of conduct on- the part of
tWe whose duty it 'was to( not otherwise,1
to be easily passed Over.' "' y" "''' y
At another placed one of the most im
portant polls of the city-i-oornorof Wash
ington and Crawford street The 1 Rev.
School 'Fund Stringer stood unmolested
teithin six feet of the Board of Co'mmis-'
stoners themselves, taking anil examining
the ballot of every colored voter1 iiud
changing the same whoit his sanctimonious
highness thought fit. Within the' very
door of the polling 'room, touobing the
very elbow ef ode of 'the-Commissioners,
stood another dusky leader of the Radi
cals, who a second time examined the bal
lots of the colored voters, before they oould
reach the ballot-box. , ' ' .
The State Penitentiary.
The following message from the Gover
nor, in reference to the Penitentiary, was
read in the Legislature on Thursday :
Gentlemen of the Senate and House
of Representatives : I feel that my duty
to the State as well as to tho inmates of i
your State prison, demands that I should
call your attention to the peculiar condi
tion of the institution, and urge upon your
honorublo body that some definite and
prompt action be taken in reference to tho
sauio before your adjournment for the hol
idays. (The condition of your Stat prison is
ilaming,'both from the fapid increase in
lumbers and for the want of means to sup
port them ) and especially so when it is
impossible, as your honorable body is well
aware, under the present status of the pris
on, to work tho couvicts. Tho report of
the Directors, made to the present session
of the General Assoiubly shows: That
tha numder of convicts in the State prison
t J be 551, and that the State owes to va
rious parties for the support of the same,
as set forth in page 30 of said report, tho
sum of $19,908.22. Two mouths have
only elapsed, and my information nt pres
ent is that the number of convicts now con
fined is GOG, and that the debts of the in
stitution amount to $80,000. Many per
sons who have extended credit to tho State
heretofore, by furnishing supplies for the
use of prisoners, refuso to d-i ny lonrer,
and it is bec'i'm ng very ditiiu ili to procure
tho actual necessaries for the institution.
I trust that the iiupnrcanc J of t: c I'.H-rs
will be diemtd a suffi .toiii t-u ..- : t 'r my
respectfully r.oi stm your only actiuu
