INCREASE THE LICENSES.
Billings is now facing the question
of saloon regulation. Many of the
saloon men, as well as the temperance
advocates, declare there are already
too many saloons in Billings, although
a certain class of the liquor interests
have been seeking to increase the
number. Undoubtedly some means
will have to be devised to prevent
an increase in the number and to
reduce the amount that already ex
ists.
One way to prevent an increase is
by continuing the policy the present
city administration has adopted, that
of not granting any additional licenses.
It seems to be a good idea. Another
way to regulate the number of saloons
is by increasing the license to such a
sum that only people who will con
duct first-class places will be able to
take out a license. This plan has al
ready been suggested by some of the
aldermen, and The Gazette believes it
is a good one. If.the saloon license
for the city was raised to $1,000 or
more per year it would undoubtedly
be the means of eliminating many of
the lower class of saloons, the ones
which are always the source of most
trouble to the police officers. It would
also prevent the continual springing
into existence of saloons conducted by
irresponsible parties. Then it would
add a large sum to the annual reve
nues of the city, and thus help to over
come a deficiency that usually exists
because of the enormous cost of con
ducting a city government.
It is said that the councilmen al
ready have the matter of raising the
saloon licenses to $1,000 per year un
der consideration. It is to be hoped
they will take such action. The first
of the year is fast approaching, and
there is no more opportune time to
make the change than now.
THE NEW OPERA HOUSE.
Billings has suffered so long a fam
ine in things theatrical that the an
nouncement that the new opera house
will probably be opened the latter
part of this week will be welcome
news. The completion of the mag
nificent new structure is certainly a
cause for congratulation. It is a build
ing to which every "Billings Booster"
can point with pride, for, undoubtedly,
it is the most scientifically constructed
theater in the northwest, as well as
one of the largest and most artistic.
Colonel Babcock and the men who
have promoted the new structure have
paid careful attention to detail. They
have made a study of the causes of
accidents and catastrophes in other
theaters, and have builded the Billings
theater in a most substantial manner,
and succeeded in erecting a structure
on scientific lines that is as nearly
fireproof and as safe as it is possible
to construct a theater. All the known
probable causes of fire in theaters
have been eliminated in the Billings
structure. The concrete has been re
inforced in the most scientific man
ner, and the structure itself is of steel
construction and tested to support
millions of pounds more than can pos
sibly ever be required of it. With the
opening of the new theater the dan
ger of any theatrical catastrophe in
Billings will pass.
But, besides being substantial, the
new theater is also artistic. The dec
orating and ornamentation was done
by one of the most skilled workmen
in the world, and is something to
which the owners of the building can
point with pride.
Colonel Babcock and his associates
are to be thanked for the magnificent
structure they have erected. It is one
of the finest buildings in Billings, and
one of which the .citizens will be
proud. People who see it will agree
that Billings possesses one of the
finest opera houses, for its size, in the
country.
-----------o-------
FAITH IN BILLINGS.
One of the best recommendations
any town can present to intending in
vestors is the faith of its own citizens.
If the residents of the community are
spending their money in real estate,
new buildings and new industries and
are thus displaying faith in its fu
ture, then investors from the outside
will assuredly be willing to invest.
They realize that if the people who
live in the town are willing to risk
their own savings then the town is
bound to grow. For after all it is the
people themselves who make any city
'what' it eventually becomes.
The faith which the people of Bill
ings have in the future of this city is
ope of its strongest boosters. There
is not a town its size in the country
where home capital is erecting such
ma Iflent structures as are going up
ia 5.UIpIq. Bilintgs men alone dur.
i~ at year have ;spent In tlhe
. ie$ po of $750,000 and plrow
bly $1,000,000 in buildings in this city.
There are the new magnificent opera
house, which. will cost 'as it now
stands, fully $250,000; the Northern
hotel, which will cost even a larger
sum; the Smith block; the Indepen
dent telephone building; the Natato
rium; the Y. M. C. A.; the Masonic
temple; the Merris block, and the
scores of new residences. Nearly ev
ery cent put into these buildings has
been Billings capital. There is not a
better recommendation for investing
here than such faith shown by the peo
ple of Billings.
The men who have invested in these
buildings have not only had faith in
the present, but in the future of Bill
ings. All of the larger blocks have
been constructed with an eye to the
future. The plans have been made
much larger than the buildings have
been constructed, but the foundations
and walls have been made so that the
plans could eventually be carried out.
As an example of this is the new op
era house block. When the plans
were drawn it was for a seven-story
structure, the walls, foundations and
lower stories were built with that end
in view, but for the present the build
ing is to be but two stories high,
though in the near future the entire
plan will be carried out.
Planning such. a structure as the
new opera house and carrying it to its
present completed state in times
when other communities are com
plaining and when the money markets
are tight shows that Colonel Babcock
and his associates have faith in Bill
ings and her future. They demon
strate that they are the right kind of
"Billings Boosters."
CANNON AND GOMPERS.
Speaker Cannon took advantage of
the visit Saturday of a committees of
trades unionists with a resolution of
commendation for the speaker to ex
press his sentiments toward union la
bor and particularly toward Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, who opposed Mr.
Cannon as a candidate for re-election,
in his home district and for speaker.
There could hardly be a statement
more in line with the views of the
general public than the one made by
Mr. Cannon. He asserts tjat the la
bor union is an excellent institution
and if he were a craftsman he would
join one; he pays a glowing tribute to
the ability as an organizer of Samuel
Gompers, but strenuously ,objects to
one man trying to dictate the votes of
2,000,000 workingmen of the nation
and criticises him for censuring a per
son, who does not agree with hinm.
Mr. Gompers has made the mistake
that scores of other labor leaders and
radicals have made. Because some
man in public life does not agree with
their views on some public matter
they proceed to declare that he is an
enemy to everybody, that his views
are wrong and that because he pos
sesses them he should be shunned by
all laboring men.
What rot. Mr. Gompers is entitled
to his opinion. Mr. Cannon is enti
tled to his. Every fair minded Amer
ican person is entitled to, should have
and when the occasion arises should
express an independent opinion and
each opinion is deserving of the. same
respect that is accorded the views of
others. The records of such men as
Speaker Cannon speak for themselves.
Because they do not agree with Mr.
Gompers is no reason why the work
ingmen should condemn them, for
among the 2,000,000 members of or
ganized labor it is safe to say that
1,500,000 do not agree with the polit
ical views of Mr. Gompers. If they
did there would be a peaceful revolu
tion in the conduct of public affairs.
For his ability as a leader, for his
excellent work In uplifting the condi
tion of the workingmen and women in
this country, Samuel Gompers is to
be thanked. But when he wants to
dictate the politics of the entire na
tion and drive from public life some
of the best types of American man
hood, simply because they hold opin
ions different from his, which have
never been tried, he is to be censured.
The very fact that his appeals have
come to naught against such men as
Congressman Littlefield, Speaker Can
non and .a score or more leading
statesmen of the nation proves that
he himself was wrong. And being
wrong, the American workingmen, for
all real Americans are workers, re
fused to stand by him.
--------o-----
WE LIVE TOO FAST.
Hardly a day passes but what the
Associated Press dispatches chronicle
the suicide of some person of note,
some banker, some lawyer, some act
ress or actor, some statesman, some
one who has been closely engaged in
a calling that has drawn public atten
tion to them. The number of such
suicides is really alarming.
Yesterday morning we read of the
death of Mrs. Clara Bloodgood, an
actress, by her own hand. As in near
ly all the other cases a breakdown or
fear of a break down, is said to have
been the cause. The close application
the woman is known to have given
to her work is said to have under
mined her nervous system. There
have been few men of note take their
own lives in the past few years, whose
suicide could not be directly traced to
such a nervous condition brought
about by too close application to one
line of duty. Their mind has been so
long wrapped up in one pursuit that
it snaps, the victim becomes pros
trated and then takes his life.
We seem to have forgotten the les
son of the "Simple Life," the book
which was so popular a few years ago
as a result of praise by the president.
We are entirely too strenuous. We
have permitted business to engage en
tirely too much of our time and atten
tion and as a result we are fast reach
ing the nervous break down condition.
The recent suicides had already reach
ed it.
It is well to bear in mind, that the
human mechanism demands a change
The all wise creator did not intend
that man should devote his entire
time to some one object, but he in
tended that'man should require a var
iety in his pursuits. And man must
have this variety. Unless he gets it
he will become morose, nervous, ill
tempered and those who do not pos
sess a wonderful physical make up
will become prostrated. It has been
this lack of variety, this close appli
cation to business that has caused so
many of the recent suicides. It has
caused the undermining of the health
of thousands of the brightest men in
the world.
It is well to have a change. When
a man is busy at labor all day he re
quires a change when night comes.
He should go to the theater, romp
with his family, or do something that
will entirely remove his thopghts from
the vocation he has followed during
the day. It is absolutely required.
Only by so doing can he hope to give
the best that is in him to his daily
work and to humanity.
----o----
LEAP YEAR IS NEXT.
It is only 23 more days till the year
1907 will have passed into history and
1908 will be at hand. It is well to call
the attention of the single young men,
the ones who have withstood the
smiles of woman for the past few
years, that 1908 will be leap year.
They should certainly be prepared for
the ordeal through which they are
doomed to pass. Undoubtedly many of
them who have not had the courage to
speak for themselves will as a result
of its being leap year enter the state
of matrimony.
The following excellent emergency
"don'ts" have been compiled by Edi
tor Poindexter of the Dillon Exami
ner and they are submitted to the
young men of the Yellowstone valley
with the suggestion that it would be
wise to heed them:
"If proposed to, don't refuse. It's
probably your last chance. Take it.
Take the chance even though it be a
big one. That's the policy we intend
to pursue, that is, of course, if the op
portunity presents itself.
"If not prepared to say 'yes,' don't,
for goodness sake, say 'This is so sud
den!' That's antiquated and over
worked by the girls. Just say, 'I'll
take your number and the matter
will be considered with due delibera
tion.' That will make her think you
have had several other offers and
will put her on the anxious seat.
You've been there and know how that
feels.
"If invited to a reception, ball or
theater, don't refuse. You've got it
coming and by all means accept all
the perquisites. Bouquets, bon bons
and buggy rides all come under this
head and by custom are decreed to
be yours.
"Don't refuse anything. Don't over
look anything. Don't be bashful.
Don't get left."
FOOTBALL'S CASUALTY LIST.
The wisdom of adopting the present
football rules is shown in the sum
mary of the casulties during the past
season. Only 11 players lost their
lives in playing the game, which is
the lowest record since the game of
football became popular in America.
Of these all were 20 years and young
er, down to fifteen. Two were college
students and the others generally
schobl boys. While the statistics of
minor accidents have not been com
piled, it is said that they were also
small when compared with the num
ber in previous years.
It seems that the style of open play
has somewhat decreased the danger
of the game. In 1906 there were 17
fatalities as a result of the game. In
1905, under the old rules, there were
21, and in 1904 there were 16.
The fatality list of 1907, small as it
is, is proof that there is still consider
able danger to the lives of the boys who
play football. But it will be found on
investigation that all manner of sports
offer similar dangers. Even base
ball annually has a fatality list as
great or almost as great as the foot
ball fatality list for 1907. And yet no
one would think of arguing that the
playing of baseball should be stopped.
The only thing that can be done is to
adopt rules that will miminize the dan
gers, and then let only the strong and
robust participate in playing it.
----
ALL SHOULD REGISTER.
The time for registering for the
special election to vote for signing a
contract to light the city and granting
a franchise for a gas plant is fast
nearing an end.
As yet the registration has been ex
ceedingly light. It is even smaller
than the registration for the special
election called to vote on granting a
street railway franchise. The voters
of Billings seem to have absolutely
no regard as to how their franchises
are disposed of or what contracts the
'ity may engage in, judging by the
way they take advantage of the op
portunity offered to instruct the coun
cil how to vote.
It is too bad that the people should
have so little regard for the safe
guards which the legislature has seen
fit to surround the granting of special
privileges and making of agreements
by the city. Every man who has a
right to vote on the matter, owes it as
a duty to society to which he be
longs, that he exercise the voting fran
chise and become registered. In the
few days that remain for registration
it is to be hoped that many will be
come entitled to .vote ... . .
Uncle Sam has just harvested the
largest crops in the history of the na
tion. The crops for 1907 are valued
at $7,412,000,000; which is a gain of
10 per cent over last year, and a gain
of 57 per cent over 1899. The crop
value is nine times the capital of all
the national banks of the country and
eighteen times their surplus. It
amounts to twice the total of all de
posits in the savings banks of the
whole country and totals two-thirds of
all the deposits of all the savings
banks of the world.
