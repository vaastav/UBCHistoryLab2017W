A.n Intelligencer representative made
effort to interview him, but was unable

i is very indignant at the allegations
ade in the Cincinnati Enquirer dispatch,
produced by the Intelligencer, that he
unpopular among members of the West
irginia bar.' They assert that he has no
ea of making a Senatorial canvass for
r. Davis' seat by manipulating a combin
on.witb Republicans of the Legislature

The prevailing feeling nmong West Viraia
Democrats now in the city is that if
e Democrats combine and abide by the
ucuB rule, John Kenna is the-coming
in, although the friends and admirers of
r. Davis are not without hope that he
ay yet be tendered a re-election and juiced
to accept, One of Senator Davis'
08t energetic strikers expressed the
union 'to-day that ho would accept if the
lislaturo could not harmonize on any one

It can be authoritatively stated that

Lincoln, Iseb., December 2.?Tho statuory
provision known as the Slocum HighLicense
Liquor law went into effect in 1
Tune, 1881, since which time it has been 1
n successful operation in all the principal j
rities and towns of the State. Tho law
places the license for tho sale of intoxicatng
liquors at $1,000 in cities of the first
jlass and cities having over 10,000 population,
and $500 in cities of the second class
having a population less than 10,000. A 1
bond of $5,000 is required of overy appli- \

"The law previous to this was a tnunici- j
ml one, and in this city the same as now j
equireu?a liccnse oi $1,000. This law ]
iau been in operation about six years, and (
ook the place ?of the $300 license law, (
vbicli latter dated back to the early days ,
>f the city, or when Lincoln was a small ,
tillage. There was at that time more i
iaioous in a village of 3,000 people than j
here are now of a city o? 18,000 popula- j
ion. The ditference between the $1,000 ,
nunicipal law mid the present State law is j
n the fact that the latter is strictly en- ,
breed, while the former was not The f
lew law was accepted as a compromise <
jetween prohibition and low, license or {
'no license." The liquor element of the ]
State stoutly and persistently labored to i
lefeat this Jaw in its passage through the j
legislature, and for sometime thereafter in
nany instances,'notably in Omaha, they
efusedto obey it; but, now that the char- <]
icter of the law is understood and doubt
10 longer exists of its eflectivenesss, there
s absolutely no trouble in its enforcement ,
inywhere in the State.
In the matter of revenue, there is a de- J
iided increase under the present system of
state license over the old law. In Omaha (
done, with its ninety saloons, the sum of (
>90.000 is annually contributed to th? C
miaty school fund from the saloons of that 1
iity?an increase of at least $30,000 over 1
lie low-license system of two years ago. t
because of this law there bre not now one- (
bird as many saloons in the State as in the 1
lays of low license. In towns where there ]
vere fifteen or twenty small doggeries there 1
ire now two and three ..well-kept saloons. ]
[n a number of towns, ranging in popula- \
ion from'jjOO to 3,000 people, prohibition J
ixists. It maybe seen from this that tliero *
s one of local option, high license, and t
prohibition. In this city, with a popula- <
ion of IS,000, there are now ten saloons, <
ill of them conducted by respectable men, J
igaiust whom a judgment in court is col- '
ectab?e, and who live strictly up to there- J
luirements of the law. There is some "j
trunkenness in the city, but not as much ]
is in former years when low license was <
he run.. The saloons aro closed on Sunday
ind after 12 o'clock at night, according to
aw.
Several of the saloons are simply palatial (
mrlors, and all much above the average j
aloon in other States. Not only is this the .
aiso in Lincoln and Omaha, but elsewhere J
n the State. If there is such a thing as i
espectability in connection with this i
msiness, it may be found in this State
inder the prevent system of high licence.
)nly among the ultra-prohibitionists is the
lew law looked upon with disfavor. To a
nan, saloonkeepers regard the law as a c
;ood one, and would not return to low
icense if they could. It is also a fact that c
nany of those who opposed the law at
ts beginning look, upon it now as the best j
icense system in existence. The sa- .
ooiis nro more orderly than heretofore,
md there is lees rowdyism, Those who .
:eep saloons are better men, and there is 1
ess drunkenness. The latter is accounted c
or from the fact that saloon.men, in order
o make a living, are not obliged to court r
he custom of professional dvuukards, as 1
vas the case under tho reign of low license, g
[t is also claimed that less of poor liquor is
ioJ<l thpn heretofore?this because of the t
ivalry ia business for the best pustpfp. j
Caking this city as an example, the present l
ligh-hcense law is, in the opinion of a ^
7cry large majority of respectable citizens,
he* best, most effective, and most unob- .
actionable liquor law in existence.
