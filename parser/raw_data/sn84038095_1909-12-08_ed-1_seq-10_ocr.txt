Washington, Dec. 7.—In his annual
message, read to congress, President
Taft said:
To the Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives:
The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have con
tinued upon the normal basis of amity
and good understanding and are very
generally satisfactory.
Europe.
The American rights [in the fisheries
the north Atlantic coast] under the
fisheries article of the treaty of 181S
have been a cause of difference be
tween the United States and Great
Britain for nearly seventy years. The
Interests involved are of great impor
tance to the American fishing industry,
and the final settlement of the contro
versy [by the permanent court of ar
bitration at The Hague] will remove
a source of constant irritation and com
plaint This is the first case involving
such great international questions
which has been submitted to the per
manent court of arbitration at The
Hague.
Negotiations for au international

Japan and Russia. The attitude of
the governments interested leads me
to hope for a satisfactory settlement of
this question as the ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.
The Near East.
The quick transition of the govern
ment of the Ottoman empire from one
of retrograde tendencies to a consti
tutional government with a parlia
ment and with progressive modern
policies of reform and public improve
ment is one of the important phenome
na of our times. Constitutional gov
ernment seems also to have made
further advance in l'ersia. These
events have turned the eyes of the
world upon the near oust, in that
quarter the prestige of the United
states has spread widely through the
peaceful influence of American schools,
universities and missionaries. Thefe
Is every reason why we should obtain
a greater share of the commerce of the
sear east since the conditions are
more favorable now than ever before.
Latin America.
One of the happiest events in recent
pan-American diplomacy was the pa
cific, independent settlement by the
-governments of Bolivia and Peru of a
boundary difference between them,
which for some weeks threatened to
cause war and even to entrain im
bltterments affecting other republics
less directly concerned.
Our Citizens Abroad
This administration, through the de
partment of at
at and the foreign serv
ice, is lending ail proper support to
legitimate and beneficial American cu
terprises in foreign countries, the de
gree of such support being measured
by the national advantages to be ex
pec
ted. A citizen himself cannot by
contract or otherwise divest himself
of the right, nor can this government
escape the obligation, of his protec
tion in his personal and property
rights when these are unjustly la
fringed in a foreign country. To av."id
ceaseless vexations it is proper that in
considering whether American enter
prise should be encouraged or supps-T-S
•ed in a particular country the govern
ment should give full weight not cnJy
to the national as opposed to the indi
vidual benefits to accrue, but also to
the fact whether or not the govern
ment v* the country in question is in
Its adn mistration and iu its diplomacy
faithfu .to the principles of modera
5 tlon, equity and justice upon which
alone spends international credit in
^Uploa^/iy as well as in finance.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The pan-American policy of this
government has long been fixed in its
principles and remains unchanged.
With the changed circumstances of the
United States and of the republics to
the south of us, most of which have
great natural resources, stable govern
ment and progressive ideals, the ap­
^Vi
prehension which t?ave rise to the
Monroe dot-nine ma.v be said to have
nearly difcuppeiiivd. and neither the
llocUino as it exists nor any oilier doe
trine of Ainerii-an policy should be
permitted n. operate for the perpetua
tion of irresponsible government, the
escape of just obligations or the insidi
ous allegation of Ooiuinatlng ambitions
oil the part of the United States.
My meeting wiili President Diaz and
tile ^reeling exchanged on both Amer
ican and .Mexican soil served. 1 hope,
to signalize the close and cordial rela
tions which so well bind together this
republic and the great republic imme
diately to the south, between which
there is so vast a netwi.rk of material
interests. S:?V
1 am liapp.v to say. that all but ohe
of the cases which for so long vexed
our relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight
ened regime now directing the govern
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
case before The- Hague tribunal.
On July 30, liHifl, the government of
Panama agreed, lifter considerable ne
gotiation, to indeiiiiiify the relatives of
the American officers and seilors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having, indeed, been killed by the
Panaman police this year.
This government was obliged to in
tervene diplomatically to bring about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica
ragua. which it had long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. A settle
ment of this troublesome case was
reached by the signature of a protocol
on Sept. 18, 1909.
Many years ago diplomatic interven
tion became necessary to the protec
tion of the interests in the American
claim of Alsop & Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation in the case and had prom
ised this government to settle it. There
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov
ernments of the United States and of.
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
and friendly relations upon which both
set such store, have agreed by a proto
col to submit the controversy to defin
itive settlement by his Britannic majes
ty Edward VII.
The Nicaraguan Troi ble
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the gov
ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America in
constant tension or turmoil. The re
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States on account of
its relation to the Washington conven
tions have been at all times conserva
tive and have avoided, so far as possi
ble, any semblance of interference, al
though it is very apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub
stantial American interests iu Central
America give to the United States a
special position in the zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patieut
efforts'of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re
publics, efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya himself. They were offi
cers in the organized forces of a rev
olution which had continued many
weeks and was in control of about
half of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to tne modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations,
At Vl? 5
they
were
.entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
of war.
At the date when this message is
printed this government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made
public in a communication to the for
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and
is intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity, its duty to American in
terests and its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization. It
may later be necessary' for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
congress in a special message.
'i
In the Far East.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its policy of support
ing the principle of equality of oppor
tunity and scrupulous respect for the
integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged the interest
ed powers of both east and west.
By the treaty of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of China, this
government Is endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty power:).
When it appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project It was obvious
that the governments whose nationals
held this loan would have a certain
direct Interest in the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
In question. The administration deem
ed American participation to be of
great national Interest. Happily, when
It was as matter of broad policy ur
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the indispensable instrumental
ity presented itself when a group of
American hankers of international
reputation and great resources agreed
at once share iu the loan upon pre
cisely such terms as this government
should 'approve. The chief of those
terms was that American railway ma
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other'nationals join
ing in the loan in the placing of or
ders for this whole railroad system.!
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at
last assured.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there
was a provision which caused consid
erable public apprehension iu that1
upon its face it was believed in some
quarters to seek to establish a monop
oly of mining privileges along the
South Manchuriai! and Antung-Muk
den railroads and thus to exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter
prise. to take part in which they were
by treaty with China entitled. After
a thorough examination of the conven
tions and of the several contextual
documents the secretary of state reach
ed the conclusion that no such monop
oly was intended or accomplished.
This government made inquiry of the
imperial Chinese and Japanese gov
ernments and received from each offi
cial assurance that the provision had
no purpose inconsistent with the poli
cy of equality of opportunity to which
the signatories, in common with the
United States, are pledged.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. The arrangement of 1908 for
a co-operative control of the. coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily. The
matter of a revision of the existing
treaty between the United States and
Japan which is terminable in 1912 is
already receiving the study of both
countries.
The Department of State.
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able action of the congress the esti
mates submitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla
tion suggested in the secretary of
state's letter of this date whereby it
will be possible to develop and make
permanent the reorganization of the
department upon modern lines in a
manner to make it a thoroughly ef
ficient instrument in the furtherance
pf our foreign trade and of American
interests abroad.
Under a provision of the act of Aug.
5, 1909. I have appointed three officials
to assist the officers of the government
in collecting information necessary to
a wise administration of the tariff act
of Aug. 5. 1909. As to questions of
customs administration they are co
operating with the officials of the
treasury department and as to matters
of the needs and the exigencies of our
manufacturers and exporters with the
department of commerce and labor in
its relation to the domestic aspect of
the subject of foreign commerce.
As a consequence of section 2 of the
tariff act of Aug. 5, 1909, it becomes the
duty of the secretary of state to con
duct as diplomatic business all the
negotiations necessary to place' him in
a position to advise me as to whether
or not a particular country unduly dis
criminates against the United States
in the sense of the statute referred to.
Government Expenditures and Rev
enues.
Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented to this administration
is that of economy in expenditures and
sufficiency of revenue.
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30.
1910, will exceed the' estimated re
ceipts by $o4.070,020. If to this deficit
are added the sum to be disbursed i'Or
the Panama canal, amounting to $38,
000,000, and §1.000,000 to be paid on
the public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditnres will be In
creased to a total deficit of $73,075,020.
This deficit the secretary proposes to
meet by the proceeds of bonds issued
to pay the cost of constructing the
Panama canal. I approve this pro
posal.
The Panama Canal.
The policy of paying for the con
struction of the Panama canal not
out of current revenue, but by bond
issue, was adopted in the Spooner act
of 1902, and there seems to be no good
reason for departing from the princi
ple by which a part at least of the
burden of the cost of the canal shall
fall upon our posterity, who are to
enjoy it, and there is all the more rea
son for this view because the actual
cost to date of the canal, which is now
half done and which will be completed
lau. 1, 1910, shows that the cost of
engineering and construction will' be
$297,700,000 instead of $139,705,200, as
originally estimated. In addition to
engineering and construction, the oth
er expenses, including sanitation and
government and the amount paid for
the properties, the franchise and the
privilege of building the canal, in
crease the cost by $75,435,000 to a
total of $375,201,000. The increase In
the cost of engineering and construc
tion is due to a substantial enlarge
ment of the plan of construction by
widening the canal 100 feet in the Cu
lebra cut and by increasing the di
mensions of the locks, to the under
estimate of the quantity of the work
to be done under the original plan and
to an underestimate of the cost of la
bor and materials, both of which have
greatly enhanced In price since the
original estimate was made.
Government Economy.
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments in the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possibl^conslstent with im
perative governmental necessity. The
result has been, as I am advised by
I
W 6 Utter TO W6W suoscnucrs inu ACView iruiii i^uw oanuai yi iaii'i^Ui- iu|rripi»«y05
the secretary of the treasury, that the
estimates of the expenses of the gov
ernment for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1911—that is, for the next
fiscal year—are less by $55,003,000
t!:'.li the total of appropriations for
the current fiscal year and less by
$.31,000,000 than the estimates for that
year. So far as the secretary of the
treasury is able to form a judgment as
to future income, there will be no
deficit in the year ending June 30, 1911.
but a sfnall surplus of $712,000.
In the present estimates the needs
of the departments and of the gov
ernment have been cut to the quick.
For the purpose of securing informa
tion which may enable the executive
and the legislative branches to unite
in a plan for the permanent reduction
oi the cost of governmental adminis
tration the treasury department has
instituted au investigation by one of
the most skilled expert accountants in
the United States. The object of the
investigation is to devise means to in
crease the average efficiency of each
employee. There is great room for im
provement toward this end, not only
by the reorganization of bureaus and
departments and in the avoidance of
duplication, but also in the treatment
of the individual employee.
Under the present system it constant
ly happens that two employees receive
the same salary when the work of one
is far more difficult and important and
exacting than that of the other. Su
perior ability is not rewarded or en
couraged.
Civil Pensions.
As the degree of efficiency in all the
departments is much lessened by the re
tention of old employees who have out
lived their energy and usefulness It.
Is indispensable to any proper system
of economy that provision be made so
that their separation from the service
shall be easy and inevitable. It Is im
possible to make such provision unless
there is adopted a plan of civil pen
sions. We carfnot, in view of the ad
vancing prices of living, hope to save
money by a reduction in the standard
of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change
is made in that regard au Increase
rather than a decrease will be neces
sary, and the only means of economy
will be in reducing the number of
employees and iu obtaining a greater
average Of efficiency from those re
tained in the service.
Frauds In the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city, in which a number of
the subordinate employees in the
weighing and other departments were
directly concerned and in which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining company and others. The
frauds consisted in the payment of du
ty on underweights of sugar. The gov
ernment has recovered from the Amer
ican Sugar Refining company all that
it Is shown to have been defrauded of.
The sum was received in full of the
amount due which might have been
recovered by civil action against the
beneficiary of the fraud, but there was
an excess reservation in the contract
of settlement by which the settlement
should not interfere with or prevent
the criminal prosecution of every one
who was found to be subject to the
same.
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officers. The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers, including the
officers and employees of the compa
nies who may have been privy to the
fraud. It would seem to me that an
investigation of the frauds by con
gress at present, pending the probing
by the treasury department and the
department of justice, as proposed,
might by giving immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment in se
curing conviction of the guilty parties.
Maximum and Minimum Clause In
Tariff Act.
Two features of the new tariff act
call for special reference. In order
that the maximum duty shall be charg
ed agaiust the imports from a country
it is necessary that the executive shall
find on the part of that country not
only discriminations iu its laws or the
practice under them agaiust the trade
of the United States, but that the dis
criminations found shall be undue—
that is, without good and fair reason.
No one is seeking a tariff war or a con
dition in which the spirit of retaliation
shall be aroused.
Tariff Readjustment.
The uew tariff law enables me to ap
point a tariff board to assist me in con
nection with the department of state in
the administration of the minimum and
maximum clause of the act and also to
assist officers of the government in the
administration of the entire law. 1 be
lieve that the work of this board will
be of prime utility and importance
whenever congress shall deem It wise
again to readjust the customs duties.
If the facts secured by the tariff board
are of such a character as to show gen
erally that the rates of duties imposed
by the present tariff law are excessive
under the principles of protection as
described in the platform of the suc
cessful party at the late election I
shall not hesitate to invite the atten
tion of congress to this fact and to the
necessity for action predicated there
on. Nothing, however, halts business
and interferes with the course of pros
perity so much as the threatened revi
sion of the tariff, and until the facts
are at hand, after careful and deliber
ate investigation, upon which such re
vision can properly be undertaken. It
seems to me unwise to attempt it.
War Department.
In the interest of immediate econ
omy I have required a reduction in
the estimates of the war department
for the coming fiscal year which
brings the total estimates down to an
amount forty-five millions less than

Value of Rubies.
Rubles are more valuable than dia
monds and are practically indestruc
tib'e, except by fire. While a flawless
diamond of one karat may be worth
roughly about $100, a perfect ruby of
the same weight would be worth at
least $200. With Increase of size the
difference becomes much greater. A
diamond of 10 karats is worth, per
haps, $4,000, while a ruby of that
weight would be worth any price up
to $70,000, which was the value placed
on a unique stone exhibited at the
Franco-British exposition in London
last year.

Words cannot express my praise for
your tonic. I weighed only ninety
pounds before taking Pernna, now ono
hundred nineteen pounds."
