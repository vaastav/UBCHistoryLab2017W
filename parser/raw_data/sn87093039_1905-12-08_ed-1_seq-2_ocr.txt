FRIDAY, HI iI 11 III.v 8, 1905
Til PHI'SMIKXT 1 MESSAGE,
There is do uncertain ring
about the declarations of the
president in his message to con
gress on the three great ques
tions that are uppermost in the
minds of the American people
today. The transportation
question, the trust problem and
the life insurance scandals have
each come in for treatment in
that plain and forceful manner
for which President Roosevelt
has become famous. There- is
nothing of the equivocal or am
biguous in his utterances on
these burning questions. The
man who does not agree with
his recommendations will not
hesitate to admit that his stand
is broad and patriotic—that in
the message he has given his
sincere conclusions.
If congress will take these
platters up in the same spirit—
deal with them frankly, honest
ly and promptly, as the people
will expect congress to do, it
.will go far in the direction of al
laying the spirit of opposition
and hostility to great corpora
tions.
It is not in the nature of hu
man affairs for the strong to give
in voluntarily to the weak. In
controverted points between the
corporations and the people, in
their individual capacity, ; the
great corporations will always
win.
The great corporations must
be met by the people in an or
ganized form —by the govern
ment, before impartial jus lice is
done between the individual and
the corporations. To this end
the Inter-State Commerce Com
mission should be given the
power to adjust differences be
tween the people and the rail
roads.
Just so should the affairs of
the industrial trusts and the life
insurance companies be subject
ed to governmental supervision
and regulation.
President Roosevelt's message
meets the expectations of the
great mass of the people.
EX-JUDGE MARTIN
t'l««il to Appear Before Superior < our
to Show Cause Wfaf He Should
Not |Ie Disbarred*
Proceedings were commenced In the
superior court la-it Saturday before
Judge Steiner, signed by Henry Crass,
Fred Hoover, A. N. Corbin, Sam Sum
ner, Ira Thomas. John D. Dill, W. A.
Grimihawr, Kirk Whittd, R. W. Cutts,
O. W. Parr, B. J. Williams, Frank
Reeves, Daniel U. Pearsall, C. L. Hol
comb, S. D. Griffith, Lewis J. Nelson
and J. J. King, moving that C. Victor
Martin be disbarred from the further
practice of law, for a*revocation and
cancellation of his license to practice as
an attorney and counselor of law in the
state of Washington. The plaintiffs
allege he is guilty of unprofessional
conduct, and that he has violated the
jaws of the state relative to barratry,
violated the oath which he took as at
torney at law and that ho violated the
laws of the state by practicing law
while he held the office of judge of the
superior court. 'I , ;; , ,
' Fifteen specifications were given In
the oomplaint In which the relutors
allege that Mr. Martin has solicited
eases, both civil and criminal, from
persons In the county. The plaintiffs
allege that Martin, when the report
came to his ears that attorneys of the
county were investigating rumors of
wrong doings on his part, presented a
paper to Harry Const.intine, whose
business he is alleged to have solicited,
stating that Martin h,ad not asked Con
tttantine for the case. The plaintiffs
allege that Constantino was asked to
sign the paper as a necessary part of
law business. Upon Constantino's re.
(using to sign the paper Martin is al
leged to have made i\ threat to dismiss
tie Hpi'oal to the supreme court in
fvbkli Constantino had been oonvicUd
of aellleg liquor to a minor.
' Judge Sit hie r has ordered Martin
Into court on the 83d day of December,
1005, to Hii'nv cause why he should not
be iliabmrtd from the further practice
of law and why tiis licence to practice
as an attorney of law should not bo re
voked.
This matter has beeji brewing for
sometime. That a movement of this
nature has lieen umlor contemplation
by the Bar Association of Cheltin
county for several months, the Echo
has known, but it was only last week
thnt the mutter came to a head by the
tiling of the necessary papers to bring
the whole matter to the judicial know
lodge of the superior court. The out
oorae will be watched with a good deal
of interest by the people of the county.
If Judge Martin has been living
under an undeserved imputation it is
both right and proper that a court of
competent jurisdiction should pass on
the matter. If on the other hand ha
has been guilty of unprofessional con
duct and has violated the law he should
be made answerable and suffer the con
aequfiices of his conduct. Not only for
the honor of the profession but the.
public good.
Gets Badly Hurt While Coasting
Gaylord Bawling the twelve year
old son of Mrs. M. A. Rawlins, pro
prietor of the Hotel Clifford received a
very ugly gash in the top of the heau
last Monday evening while coasting
down the long hill just beyond the
bridge on the road to the mill. He and
several other boys had their sleds
hitched together and were coming down
the hill when they hit an obstruction
which upset the front sled on which
was the Rawlins boy. It is supposed
that a runner of one of the rear sleds
struck Gaylord on.the head. He re
mained unconcious for several hours.
Dr. Hoxey was summoned and had to
take seven stitches in the gaping
wound to close it up.
At the lime of going to press the boy
is considered out of danger.
William Ldoyd Garrison.
We arc close upon the centennial an-
Ulversary of the birth of an American
reformer whose weapon—the pen—had
a mighty reach In affecting the destiny
ol a race. William Lloyd Garrison
narrowly missed bclug an immigrant
iv the land where he came to high hon
or, for very shortly before his blrtb
at Newhuryport, Dec. 10, 1805, his par
ents emigrated to this country from
Nova Scotia. Garrison began to work
for himself nt fourteen years of age
as an apprentice iv a newspaper office.
At twenty-live he was working for oth
ers in a paper which be had founded
with such zeal and energy 1 that he was
mobbed and imprisoned and a price
set for his capture.
In the first issue of the Liberator,
which (Jam.- mi published in Boston
lor thirty-five years and until the form
of slavery which It was his life mis
sion to wage war upon was destroyed,
he said: "I am In earnest. I will not
equivocate. I will not excuse. I will
not retreat a single inch, and I will be
heard." Early iv the autislavery move
uient v division arose In the councils,
aud Garrison became the leader of the
party devoted to moral agitation as dis
tinct from the political autislavery
men. His followers refused to take
part in a government which bound
them by oath in certain contingencies
to support slavery.
Although differing in methods, there
was no rivalry and no dissension
among the two classes. Political unti
slavery leaders recognized the value
of moral agitation, and men of that
faith supported Garrison's work with
liberal contributions. The Liberator
made no appeal to the passions of the
slaves, but aimed to stir the con
sciences of the slave owners and es
pecially of the citizens of the free
states. When the civil war broke out
In ISOI Garrison aud his associates
labored to induce the Lincoln adminis
tration, which was Itepubllcan and
committed to antlslavery legislation,
to place the war upou an avowedly
autislavery basis to the end that slav
ery should be forever excluded from
the restored Union. In this crisis feel
lug In the ranks of the two elements
of antislavery men ran high. Lincoln
was for a restoration of the Union at
any price, while the Garrison men
frankly declared that a Union with
slavery retained was not worth re
storing. The fortunes of war favored
bqth parties. Lincoln emancipated the
slaves in the territories which had se
ceded, and they camo back as free
states.
Garrison's zeal was inspired by n
temperament which made him keenly
sensitive to human suffering. In Eng
land he was honored as the founder of
the antislavery movement In the Unit
fd States. This country naturally ex
alts the memory of the martyred eman
cipator. When men come to study
philosophically the times In which Gar
rison lived and the work he wrought
his largeness as a national force will
be appreciated.
}f the man "who makes two blades
of grass grow where only one grew be
fore" Js a public benefactor there Is lit
tle danger of piling honors too thick
on the memory of J. Sterling Morton.,
the tree planter of the prairies. It
was once supposed that the fqrestlu
tion of the American prairie was im
possible. Morton persisted to experi
ments when others gave It up, and not
alone towns and cities of the plains,
but extensive farm lands where his
example was followed, have shaded
streets and avenues or groves of vigor
ous forest trees.
