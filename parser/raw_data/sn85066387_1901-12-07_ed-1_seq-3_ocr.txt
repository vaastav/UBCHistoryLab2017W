ROMANCE ENDS
FOR WILHELMINA
Consort Eats Too Much
Drinks Too Much
and Hunts.
Holland Queen Binds Wounr
of a Man Her Hus
. band Injured.
LONDON, Dec. 6.— A dispatch to the
Evening News from The Hague, published
to-day, says: "Peace reigns again at the
palace, and the happiest man in Holland
is Major Van Tets, who was wounded in
defense of Queen W'ilhelmina by Prince
Henry, or, as all Dutchman now con
temptuously call him 'the German.'
'•Van Tets is one of the ten noble
youths who formed the body guard of the
smiling young Queen when she was mar
ried in February, and who have been since
at their royal mistress' beck and call on
every occasion. They pride themselves on
iheir servitude, and in this matter-of-fact
twentieth century their chivalrous devo
tion to Queen Wiihelmina is a pretty thing
to see.
"It is whispered that every man of the
ten handsome youths who surround her
Majesty's carriage when she drives
abroad, skate with her when she skates,
ride with her when she riaes end dance
attendance on her generally, has been at
one time or another over head and ears in
iove with the dainty little lady in whom
-tioiiaiid's hopes are centered.
■'Official contradictions notwithstanding,
nobody at The Hague doubts for a mo
ment that the Queen and her consort have
been at loggerheads practically since the
wedding, .frince Henry is an unpleasant
person. He eats too much, drinks too
ireely, and hunting occupies him far more
than his wife. Wiihelmina, on her side, is
jjot a woman to allow herself to be neg
lected with impunity. It is said that she
stanched Van rets' wound with her own
hands and insisted on her husband beg
ging pardon of the Jonkherr as well as of
herself, before she would forgive him. All
the romance of the marriage of Wilhel
xnina and the man she herself chose has
disappeared."
I.OXDOX. Dec. 6.— A dispatch to the
Central News from Amsterdam says that
Major Van Tets died last Thursday even

rZLZGATSS DISCUSS
LAW OF PROFESSIONS
Pan-American Congress Votes on
the Question of State
Diplomas.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 6.— The session to
day of the Pan-American conference was
taken up with a discussion of Chile's
proposition » regarding the practice of
learned professions, chiefly whether, even
if accepted, the convention would be of
any practical value. These doubts were
strengthened by the explanations of C. M.
Pepper of the United States delegation to
the effect that in his country" this mat
ter came under State legislation, over
which the Federal authorities had no con
trol.
Gil Fortoul of Venezuela asked Pepper
whether a professional diploma issued in
one of the States of the United States
was recognized in the others. Pepper re
plied that each State made its own terms
and that there was no obligation on the
part of any of them to recognize diplomas
issued in another. Gil Fortoul said that
that was really very serious and he did
not see the use of going any further.
The question was whether the delega
tions were in favor of the proposed con
vention in a general way. This being put
to a vote the convention in general was
accepted by seventeen votes. Bolivia vot
i-g adversely and Uruguay's representa
tive beins absent.
John Barrett of the United States dele
gation presented a letter from E. S. Good
win, director of the Pacific Commercial
Museum of San Francisco, asking that the
branch of the projected Pan-American
Bank be established at San Francisco,
which would enlarge trade relations of
the entire Paciflc Coast with South Amer
ica. The letter was referred to the Pan-
American Bank committee.

SAVES CHILDREN
FROM THE FIRE
Heroic Father Battles
Against Advance of
Flames.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 6.— Two persons were
burned to death and ssven injured in a
fire at Carnegie, Pa., this morning. The
dead are:
MRS. SARAH KLEE, aged 43 years.
MARY KLEE, aged 9 years.
The injured are: Samuel Klee, aged 50
years; Ida Klee, aged 20; Anna Klee,
aged 17; Rachel Klee, aged 14; Eva Klee,
nged 10; Jennie Klee. aged 6; Harry Klee,
aged 4.
The Klee residence was a two-story
house on Broadway, the ground lioor
front being de voted to a grocery store
kept by .Kiee and the rest of the house
being occupied by the family.
The tire was discovered about 4:40 this
morning by the grocery clerk, Morris
Fizis. He immediately gave the alarm,
but the Hames spreaa so rapidly that. the
occupants of the upper story were shut
off trom the stairway. Klee and his wife
realized that the only way to save the
chllaren was to drop them from the win
dow, a distance of about twenty feet.
One by one the children were brought
to the front window and dropped to -the
ground by the father. All of them, were
more or less seriously injured, but all es
caped death from the flames except Mary.
By* the time Harry, the baby, was
reached, the father was almost exnaiisted
and the little one's face and feet and
hands were blistered and burned. He
was snatched from the flames just in
time and it is thought he will survive.
After rescuing his baby, the father
looked around for his wife and being un
able to locate her, he became almost dis
tracted. It seems that while the father
was rescuing the youngest and most
helpless child his wife was making an
attempt to save the life of Mary, and In
doing so gave up her own life. <
The House was destroyed. The charred
I remains of the mother and daughter were

to Try James W.

of one more juror the State will be ready
to .proceed with the trial of James W.

and Daniel Yantis near Lookout. In all
probability this twelfth man will be
sworn to-morrow and the opening state
ments of counsel will be made on Mon
day.
Venireman Theodore Lee, during his ex
amination to-day, said that he believed
lynching to be justifiable when the vic
tims were assailants of women,; but in
such caso only. He was sworn. H. P.
Read and "W. L. Smith were both passed
after brief examinations. Read later
asked that he be excused . from serving
on the jury. Under re-examination he
said that he believed his opinion would
influence his verdict, as he believed the
defendant was guilty. Read was the first
talesman to express an opinion unfavor
able to Brown. Deputy Attorney Gen
eral Post asked for an order of court
that Read remain in Alturas as a wit
ness for the people.
/W. T. Smith was sworn to try the case,
making the ninth juror. A. F. Spicer was
passed by both sides, although he said
that he would not believe an Indian's tes
timony. C. H. Caldwell was closely ex
amined by the prosecution as to his sym
pathies with Lookout people, as he lives
near that place, and especially as to his
feeling toward Eades and Levanton, two
of the defendants, with whom he said he
was on very friendly terms. He was
passed by both sides. S. A. Billlck was
passed. He testified that he did not be
lieve in lynch law. Billlck was formerly
a guard in Folsom Prison and testified
that in enforcing law there his
term 'he was obliged with two other
guards to kill a prisoner to prevent a jail
