NO HYSTERIA IN THE MESSAGE.
Congress is again in session and the j
president's message Is the principal
news from the national capital. There
is no disappointment in the message;
it is a strong state paper. President
Roosevelt has not been hiding his opin
Ions on public questions under a bushel j
and the people have been reasonably i
certain of what the message would
contain for its salient points, and tlieir
expectations have been met.
For many months the trend of news
from the national capital has been to j
the effect that the railroad question
■would be the paramount issue of the
annual message. There are those in
and out of the republican party who
would favor radical changes in the
tariff schedules but the attitude of the
administration has clearly shown that
there were weightier questions in the
balance than the question of tariff
schedules.
The key note of the president's dis
cussion of the railroad question is fed
eral supervision of all corporate in
terests. He makes it clear that he does
not seek government interference of
private affairs except to regulate public
abuses. The president is no enemy of
the corporations. There Is no populism
in his attitude. The lines that he has
marked out will never lead to govern
ment ownership nor any other of the
socialistic ends. He believes in the
corporation as a power for good, but
since the corporation is powerful and
Its interests in the hands of selfish men,
may be used to the injury of the people,
he argues for some effective power of
corporate supervision. This power
should be lodged in the government
which represents the people as a whole,
and is a sovereign strong enough to
control the corporations. The corpora
tion is a fixed factor of national growth
and development. It has come to stay
and the government has no desire to
usurp its powers. The president makes
this point clear and seeks only for au
thority to check abuses.
The tenor of the message is far re
moved from the hysteria that many
people have been proposing to deal
with the Interests of the big corpora
tions. The president emphasizes his
■doctrine of a "square deal." It is to
the interest of the best type of railroad
men, for the best type of shipper, no
less than of the public that there
should be government supervision and
regulation of this great corporate in
terest. It is the square deal and the
high moral influence of the doctrine
that the message emphasizes, and the
tone of it is far removed from frenzy,
and will appeal strongly to all classes.
If the railroads hoped th
would fall into the error of an intem
perate attack lipon their corporate in
terests. they have been mistaken. The
ground taken is in accord with sound
business Judgment and some beneficial
legislation will probably result as the
work of the present session.
THE RED MAN NOT A FARMER
The best commentary on the Indian
ns a farmer as deduced from the report
from the rentals of Indiaft lands pub
lished In this issue is that the Indian
Is not a farmer and except in rare in
stances never will be. He does not
care to take the initiative nor the re
sponsibility. The Indian does not ob
ject to making hay while the sun shines
but he takes no pride in its being his
own hay. and he is still farther re
moved from the desire to work contin
uously and consecutively from the seed
time to the harvest. He is several gen
erations yet removed from labor as a
means of preparation for ttie future,
work for the thrift that lays up some
thing for a rainy day. His work is in
termittant and irregular, a forced and
unnatural condition the result of stern
necessity and not of choice. The idle*
leisure of an Idle race still runs riot
In his blood, and except In rare In
stances will for many generations yet
to come.
Inexcusable as It may seem. 58 people
have been killed by Los Angeles street
■cars, and 430 injured in 23 months. One
would infer that it were safer to walk
than to patronize Los Angeled trolley
•cars.
"An Unmuzzled Republican Paper" is
the black-type motto at the head of the
editorial column of the Council Ad
vance. L. S. Cool is editor. There is
often much in a name, and in this in
stance, may his tribe increase.

O
RAILROAD'S SIDE OF THE
QUESTION.
From "Railroad Rebates," by
Ray Stannard Baker, in the
December McClure's.
00000<XXXXXXXXXXX530<X)00000
If a man is too conscientious to pay
rebates and break the law at the de
mand of Armour or of Pabst of Mil
waukee, be is eliminated and a less
honest han takes his place—a man who
is willing to make terms with his con-,
science, to "do as the Romans do," or
fine some shady device that can lie fur
nished up by the legal department to
look lawful. The railroad man, in
deed, makes a pretty strong case for
himself, showing that he is the victim
of his own defenselessness which the
shrewd trust shippers well know. I
quote from an excellent address by J.
W. Gleed, an attorney for the 'Frisco
system,
"A railroad must have tonnage;
herein lies its weakness and defense
lessness. It is an investment that cah
never produce but one commodity,
namely, transportation, and that com
modity must be consumed where the
railroad lies. It cannot be stored in
July to be sold in November. Its In
vestment is permanent and the ex
penses run on, traffic or no traffic.
Bankrupt though it becomes, its wheels
still turn in desperate hope: and the
worse its financial plight the more
reckless and dangerous Us competition.
Most western roads could carry twice
their present tonnage, with compara
tively slight increase of total annual
expense. In this fact lies the great
weakness and temptation of a railroad.
A railroad man says: T can sell this
one shipper transportation at a frac
tion of a cent a ton and yet not be out
anything, because I can easily pro
duce more transportation.' "
James J. Hill, undoubtedly the fore
most railroad man in the country tu
day, said ^acently in an interview
"As the raatter now stands and has
stood for a number of years the prac
tice of rebates lias enabled the big
shippers to hold a club over the rail
roads. The more tills question is
studied, the more it will be found that
after all, ttie railroads need some pro
tection."
It Is hardly surprising, then, with
this natural weakness of the railroads,
combined with the greedy demands of
great shippers, that traffic morals have
come to lie so easy in this country.
And yet, when the public says to the
railroad man. as It is saying now, "see
here, you are the victims of your own
property and of the greed of powerful
shippers; let us pass laws that will
arm us both against the predatory
trusts." the railroad man takes wild
alarm, fearing that Ills power and his
profits in some way will be lessened.
But until the present methods of con
spiracy-breeding secrecy and wholly
irresponsible private control of the
railroads are utterly revolutionized we
cannot hope to have a fair system of
rate taxation, we cannot hope to grap
ple with the trusts, and, far more im
portant than that, we cannot secure a
condition in which decent business
morals are even possible!
One of tiie very worst results of the
payment of rebates to favored shippers
lias been the corroding growth of sus
picion atul distrust throughout the rail
road business. It is a hard thing to
say, but one cannot look into the ques
tion at all closely without reaching the
conclusion that the honor of a promise,
"the word of a man." has disappeared
in the railroad freight business. A
promise—even a signed contract—will
not stand for one moment, if by break
ing it a railroad agent can secure one
car more of freight. These are strong
words, but every man in the service,
down in his heart, knows that they are
true. I have listened to these men tell
ing with absolute glee how they got to
gether, all promising, even swearing—
a "gentleman's agreement"—not to give
a rebate to a certain shipper, and how,
the moment they got out of the meet
ing, every man used his best wits to
break his oath as quickly as possible.
Surely, a system which produces such
dishonesty is wrong, wrong from the
bottom to the top.

How a sneeze saved a baby's life is
related by an eastern exchange. A
fourteen-months-old child was ill with
croup, and its tmdition had become so
serious that she had been given up.
and a dozen neighbors, men and
women, had gathered to comfort the
parents.
While the child was gasping for its
breath and apparently passing away,
the entire assemblage began to sneeze.
Tin* air in the room seemed charged
with something that kept, up the sneez
ing, and the child in the bi d began to
sneeze also, and when the doctor ar
rived he found all hands sneezing and
the infant so much better, on account
o? the sneezing, that he pronounced her

Consul-General Guenther, of Frank
fort, reports a novel footwear made of
asbestos. It is supposed to save sol
diers from tiie sensitiveness of the skin
so often the cause of Inconvenience in
the past to armies on the march. He
writes:
Doctor Hogyes, an Hungarian army
physician, has demonstrated by
thorough investigations that the
marching ability of soldiers, which is
the most important requirement for an
army in the field, is less endangered by
fatigue than through the sensitiveness
of the skin of the feet against leather.
This sensitiveness, which has hereto
fore been well recognized, the Hunga
rian physician has tried to avoid by a
peculiar remedy, namely, through lin
ing, or socks, of asbestos. The Hun
garian army has already adopted this
innovation, and it is now proposed to
put the article upon the market for the
public. The absestos industry may
thereby find a new use for its product.
