BOARD OF TRADE MEETING
WIIkOH 7
Leon Frank is either an innocent
man or a consummate actor.. In the
Atlanta courtroom Wednesday, when,
before sentencing him to death, the
judge asked him what he had' to say
for himself, Frank replied in the fol
lowing words: ' A
"May it please your honor, this is
a momentous day a . day of far
greater importance to the state of
Georgia and to the majesty of the
law even than to myself, for under
the guise of law your honor is about
to pronounce words that ' will con
demn to death an innocent man.
Transcending in importance the, loss
of my own life is -the indelible stain
and dishonor resting upon the name
of this state by reason of its judicial
ly murdering an innocent man. The
jury's verdict on August zo, iyii,
finding me guilty of the death of
Mary Phagan 'did not then and does
not now speak the truth. I declare
to your honor and to the world that
that verdict was made in an atmos
phere seething with mob violence and
clamor for my life a verdict based
on evidence absolutely false, which
under other circumstances Would not
have been given a moment's credence.
' "I deeply sympathize with the par
ents of Mary Phagan. The brute
that brought so much grief upon
them ' has plunged me into sorrow
and misery unspeakable and is about
to accomplish my undoing.
"But this I know, my execution
will mark the advent of a new era in
Georgia 'where a good name1 and
stainless honor count for naught
against the word of a vile criminal;
where the testimony of Southern
white women of - unimpeachable char
after is branded as false by the pros
ecution, disregarded by the jury and
the perjured vaporings of a black
brute alone accepted as, the .whole
truth; where a mob crying for blood
invaded the courtroom and became
the dominant factor in what should
have been a solemn judicial trial. Oh,
shame that these things be true!
"Life is very sweet to me. It is not
an easy thing to give up the love of
dear ones, of wife and . parents, of
every - loyal friend. Though this be
true, death has no terror for me. I
go to my end in the full conscious
ness of. innocence and in the firm
conviction that as there is a God in
heaven, my full' vindication must
come some day. With the dawn of
that day there will come to the peo
ple of Georgia .full realization of

Saturday evening Nov. 14, the
friends of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Holly
were made sad to learn that Mrs,
Holly had passed away. ,v For more
than three weeks loving friends had
waited with , anxious hearts ' news
from the sick, room, some times faint
hope being given for her recovery,
only to be. blighted Vagain in a few
short hours, and on Saturday . eve
ning at 2 o'clock, . peacefully as a
babe falling asleep at its ; mother's
breast, her spirit returned to the. God
who gave it. Being young arid hav
ihg seemingly so much to live for, we
cannot help but ask why she had to
die, " but God wo'rketh in mysterious
ways his wonders to perform. She
was born April 18th, 1893, being only
a little more" than 21 years of age.
Her girlhood was spent at the quiet
country heme of her parents. At the
age of fifteen, she went to Atlanta to
school, where she remained two win
ters. A few weeks - after returning
home she wTas married to Mr. Ray
Holly, tlfe marriage proving to be a
most happy one. Two little girls had
come to bless the home,, one less than
a month old at the time of its
mother's- death. Mrs. Holly pos
sessed a most beautiful , disposition,
loving, and sun-shiny always with a
happy smile and jolly word for every
one. She will be sadly missed. Be
side the devoted young , husband and
children, she leaves father, mother,
brother and sister to mourn-'her: loss;

of Trade headquarters. The meeting
was called to order by President
MacKay, and minutes of last meet
ing were read and adopted.
Young Fish for Lake Weir
Secretary Rooney made a verbal
report on the work of th.e United
States agricultural department's pro
gress in placing fish in Lake Weir.
He stated that the first consignment
jf bass and sun fish had been receiv
ed during the day and that he with
several, other citizens had been to the
lake to see that they were properly
handled and cared . for. They - were
put in the lake at Woodmar. ,' Sev
eral shipments will be ; made later,
and these will be distributed to other
parts of the lake. He stated that
those put in the water yesterday had
reached here in fine shape, only "one
of . the bass having died-, in transit
from the hatcheries. , .
The Power Company's Proposition
The Florida Power Company's
proposition for furnishing electric
current to the city, which has been
advertised for ' the past few, days in
the city papers was read,, as was also
a letter from Mr. R. C. Camp, presiT
dent of the company. Mr. Camp's
letter cites -that his company has an
investment of $600,000 in its; hydro
electric development, and that if the
city built its plant and generates
800,000 K. W. 11'. per yeai at 3 cents
per K. W. H. the annual loss between
this figure and the one he proposes
to furnish the power at will be $8000
per annum. In his letter, and also Jh
his verbal eplanation of the propo
sition Mr. Camp says: f t
"I do not ask the city to accept
either of the propositions made. I
only ask that the citizens go into the
matter, investigate and ;determine
that which As best for the city."
Mrl Camp explained his reason for
the placing, of this letter before the
board. He said that it appeared that
the board of governors were anta
gonistic to the plan. :.
Mr. MacKay, speaking for the
board of .governors of the Marion
County. Board of Trade, i said that the
impression of Mr. Camp that that
body was Antagonistic to the plan was
erroneous. He said that the board
would take pleasure in considering
any proposition looking to the wel
fare of the city, and that the present
communication wras the first that had
been submited to the board on the
subject. Mr. Rooney al6 spoke in
defense of the board of governors,
stating, that the matter had never
been laid before the Board of Trade
for action or consideration. He
stated also that he believed the new
ly elected councilmen, a majority of
whom are memberk of, the Board of
Trade, would be able better to act in
unison with the board than had been
the case in the past, and felt that any
matters that came up for their joint
action would be , more amicably
handled "in the future, on all public
questions.
Messrs. Frank Harris, Louis Long,
Walter Hood and others made short
alks in which they urged the investi
gation of the power company's prop
osition, and its adoption if it, was
found to be an improvement upon
the present methods of lighting the
city under municipal ownership.
