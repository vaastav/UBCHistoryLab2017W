vision Fails of Adoption
Washington Dec 16The hopes
of the socalled insurgents in the
house of representatives for a re
vision of the rules of that body were
dissipated for the time being at

of an amended resolution calling for
the appointment of a committee of
eight members to consider the sub
ject and report the changes they
deem necessary By a substantial
majority the house voted to take
away from the committee on foreign
affairs consideration of the resolu
tion which In its original form sim
ply called for information from the
secretary of state regarding what the
British house of commons had done
In that regard A ruling by the speak
er that the amendment of Mr Gard
ner changed the character of the res
olution in such a way as to not make
it privileged was sustained and the
resolution then was laid on the table
After passing some bills relating to
the District of Columbia the remain
der of the day was taken up with the
bill to revise the penal laws of the
United States which was considered
at length during the last session
