FIFTY - FOURTH CONGRESS
Both Branches Organized Without
the Slightest Jar.
MR. REED IS AGAIN SPEAKEK
Other Officer of the Republican Caucus
Are Elected -Tho Reed Rulea Are
Adopted Largo Attendance at
Organization of the Senate.
Special to the Scranton Tribune.
Washington. Dec. 2. It wa a notable
audience In the presence of which Clerk
Kerr converted the Fifty-fourth con
gress at noon today. The events usual
In opening of congress occurred, but the
crowds present wcra much larger than
the house officials counted on and many
people were turned away. I'robably
the most Indifferent person In the tu
mult and excitement of the occasion
was the man from Maine, who received
the honor thrust upon him with calm
demeanor. Heed was sworn In by Gen
eral Hnemnr, w ho succeeds that other
distinguished Philadelphlan, Hon.
Charles O'N'ell, father of the house.
Thla is Central Hasmer's twelfth con
secutive term as representative and
this was not overlooked today by his
colleagues, who crowded about him to
extend congratulations. In the drawing
of seats all of the Pennsylvanlans in the
house came early on the list and secured
desirable placeB.
Ex-Speuker Crisp did not receive the
unanimous vote of the party. Repre
sentative Cain, of Texas, still smarting
from his chagrin of the Inst congress,
which the refusal of Speaker Crisp to
give him a committee appointment he
sought engendered, bolted the candi
date his party in caucus had nominated
and cast his vote for Judge Turner of
the Lone Star state. Much adverse
criticism is being directed at Cain be
cause of hl3 action.
, Speculation as M Committees.
Speaker Ree-d will not announce his
committees for several days. He said
today he had not campleted his list of
committee appointment. When the
committees are announced there will
be some surprises. Reyburn. of Phila
delphia, for Instance, who was on the
committee on rivers and harbors in the
last congress, will hardly be on the
committee again although he wants
the appointment. Congressmen Ache
son and Helner. both from districts in
the western end of the state, want
to aret on the committee. Senator Quay
has expressed a preference between tho
two, and Acheson, whose district lies
on the Mononprahela, which water way
may be Improved, Is his choice. Reed
may respect his wishes In the matter.
Dalzell, of Pittsburg, Is still hoping
against hone that Reed will make him
chairman of ways and means. Nobody
knows who is Reed's choice, but Reed
and he wont tell. The chairman of
comniittee on the Judiciary may be
Colonel W, A. 6 tone, of Allegheny, and
Hicks, of Altoona, wants to be chair
man of the committee on public build
ings and grounds. Pennsylvania will
likely get the chairmanship of the com
mittee on labor. Apsley, of Massachu
setts, Is the ranking Republican mem
br, but he said today he had other
preferences, and with the Massachu
setts man out of the way, Congress
man Phillips, of the twenty-fifth dis
trict, will be the ranking member.
Phillips was most active as- member of
the committee during the last congress.
He is from an - Industrial section of
the state, and is the best equipped man
the house has for the place. There will
be surprises in Keed's lists of comniit
tee appointments. W. R, B.
MACHINERY IN MOTION.
The House Organized Without a Ripple
of Olseord.
Washington, Dec. 2. The machinery
for the organization of the house of
representatives worked today very sat
isfactorily and without the slight
est Jar. Mr. Reed, of Maine, in pur
suance of the unanimous decision of the
Republican caucus, was elected to the
speakership by a vote of 234, as against
95 for Mr. Crisp, of Georgia, the Demo
cratic candidate; 6 for Mr. Bell, of
Colorado, the Populist candidate, and 1
for Mr. Culberson, of Texas, Democrat.
The six votes for the Populist candidate
were given by Messrs Baker, of Kan
sas; Howard, of Alabama; Kem, of Ne
braska, and Schuford, Rtanner and
Stroud, of North Carolina.
The one vote for Mr. Culberson was
flven by his colleague, Mr. Crane
this being the only deviation from party
programmes. Mr. Reed's speech, in
taking the chair, was brief and Incisive.
He would not speak for the past, he
said; the past could speak for itself.
Nor should he speak for the future, as
thpy were not putting off the harness,
but putting it on. But he suggested
that those who had acted with wisdom
in the past might be fairly expected to
act with wisdom in tho future. After
the oath of office had been adminis
tered to the speaker and all the mem
bers, the next step irt the Republican
programme, the election of the house
officers, was taken, and Messrs. Mc
Dowell, of Pennsylvania; Russell, of
Missouri; Glenn, of New York; McEl
roy, of Ohio, and Conden, of Michigan,
were chosen as clerk, sergeant-at-arms,
doorkeeper, postmaster and chaplain,
respectively.
The rules of the Fifty-first congress
(popularly known as the Reed rules)
were adopted for the government of the
house in the present congress, after an
assurance from Mr. Cannon (Republi
can, lllnols), who had pffered the reso
lution, that they would hereafter be re
ferred to the committee on rules and
that the house would nave an oppor
tunity to discuss the report of the com
mittee. That assurance seemed to sat
isfy Mr. Crisp (Democrat, Oeorgla),who
had raised the question, and the mat
ter went through Without further con
tention. After some further preliminary pro
ceedings and a drawing for seats in the
usual manner, perhaps somewhat In
contravention of the anti-lottery law,
and in which drawing many of the
prizes fell to some of the least known
of the members, and many of the blanks
to some of the most distinguished, the
house at I.3S p. m. adjourned until to
morrow. Deiaoerstle Caucus.'
Three hours) were consumed by the
house Democrats In caucus this af
ternoon, selecting? the four officials of
their party, which they are entitled
by their minority representation.
The veteran OhloUtn, Colonel Isaac
Hill, who was the deputy serjeant-at-arms
of the last congress, was elected
special employe over H. W. Moler, of
Illinois, who held the office of cashier
In the fifty-second congress. The of
fice of special employe makes its pos
sessor the legislative, "whip" of the
minority, and Is worth 11,500 per year.
After a long discussion, interspersed
with numerous roll calls, George L.
Browning, of Virginia, and Thomas
Cokley, of (New Tork, were elected
special messengers with salaries of
$1,200 each. Mr. Cokley is a well-known
member of the Tammany society and Is
widely popular about the house.
The caucus finished Its work by elect
ing James F. English, of California,
page.
The Senoto OrsaniieJ.
There was an unusually large attend
ance of senators when the Fifty-fourth
congress convened today, the only re
corded absentees being Mr. Hill, of
New Tork; Mr. Lindsay, of Kentucky;
Mr. Wolcott, of Colorado, and two sen
ators from Lousiana; Mr. Palmer, of
Illinois, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas,
were absent during the first part of
the proceedings, but came in in timo
for adjournment. The only Interesting
feature of the proceeding was the
swearing in of the new senators. Be
ing unofficially advised that the presi
dent's message would not be delivered
till noon tomorrow, the senate imme
diately thereafter adjourned till that
time.
Will Movo to tho tVlilto House.
Now that congress has assembled the
president will move to the white house
from his country home, "Woodley,"
where he wrote his annual message
without disturbance. If tomorrow is a
good day Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland and
their children will take up their resi
dence for the winter at the executive
mansion.
MUS. HOWELL'S TRIAL
Important EvUlenco for the Common
wealth in the Poisoning CaselsKultd
Out by the Court.
Wellsboro, Fa., Dec. 2. The trial of
Mrs. Charlotte Howell, charged with
poisoning Miss Elizabeth Knapp, was
resumed this morning and tho counsel
for both sides spent most of the day In
citing authorities and urging the points
to whether certain test letters printed
by Mrs. Howell In the district attorney's
office should be admitted as evidence or
not. The commonwealth relied upon
these test letters to prove that Mrs.
Howell wrote all the threatening notes
to Miss Knapp and the prosecuting at
torneys claim that Mrs.Howell betrayed
herself in consenting to print with a
pencil In capital letters the phrases dic
tated to her. She printed the letters so
readily and so remarkably like the
batch of original letters thut It makes
a very strong point. The Judge held to
his decision of Saturday and ruled out
these letters.
It has been shown by the testimony of
Dr. H. H. Boom, an expert chemist of
Philadelphia, that after an analysis he
found three and three quarter grains of
white arsenic in the stomach, bowels
and liver of the dead girl.
Tomorrow morning the taking of evi
dence will be resumed and it will be
several days before the prosecution
completes its case,
DEADLY SCISSORS WIELDED
St. Louis Man Tiics as the Result of Ills
W ife's Rage.
St. Louis, Dec, 2. Andrew Hulen,
aged 61, died at the city hospital last
evening from erysipelas of the brain.
Sunday he and his wife, Rachel, quar
reled at their home, on North Twenty
second street In her rage she picked
up a pair of scissors and threw them at
him. One of the points entered his
right eyeball. Monday he was taken
to the hospital Buffering Intense pain.
His eyeball had been bo badly lacerat
ed that the tissue protruded from tho
wound. The face was badly inflamed
and swollen.
His serious condition prevented an
operation, so soothing lotions were ap
plied. Erysipelas set in, however, and
attacked the brain. Hulen then became
delirious, and never regained con
sciousness. His wife Is now in Jail,
charged with murder.

in locating the heirs.
The Swedish government has the

PARDONS THEFT FOR BREAD
Governor Matthews Explains Ills Appar
ent Soft-llcurtednesa.
Indianapolis, Dec. 2. "I woutd never
pardon a man who stole for himself,"
said Governor Matthews today, "but
when it can be shown that a man
through misfortune Is brought face to
face with want, and he steals In order
that his wife and children shall, not go
hungry, I will pardon him every time."
,Thls statement was brought out by
recent criticisms of the governor's ac
tion In granting pardons, it being said
that he was too soft-hearted and parol
ing too many prisoners. The governor
answered his critics In the foregoing
statement and added that he pardoned
but three classes men drawn Into
crime by accident, convicts known to be
dying of disease and men whom he be
lieved have been wrongfully convicted.
JOE WALCOTT DEFEATED.
The African Boxer Is Knocked Out by the
"Ssglnaw Kid."
Empire Athletlo Club, Maspeth, L. I.,
Dec. 2. The 15-round contest between
Joe Walcott, Tom O'Rourke'a colored
protege, and George Lavlgne, better
known as the "Saginaw Kid," attracted,
one of the largest crowds to the club
that has been seen since the club was
opened. '-.
By a previous . arrangement between
the. lads, the decision was to go to
Lavlgne If he should be' on his feet at
the end of fifteen rounds. The colored
boxer, was favorite 'at 10 to on.
Lavlgne won.
IN THE 0TI01H EMPIRE
Powers Kill Insist Upon the Presence
of Extra Guard Boats.
THE LOCH KAXN0CH APPAIR
Turkish Version of the Firing I'pon a
British Sbip-The Flight of Mural Boy.
Information Regarding Armeni
an Troubles Suppressed.
Constantinople, Dec. 2. Contrary to
the general impression tho powers seem
to be unanimous In the resolve to insist
upon their demand for extra guardshlps
at the entrance to the Dardanelles. In
discussing the temporary withdrawal or
the British gunboat Dryad, a Turkish
official Intimated that the matter was
a very slmpleone.thesubstance of which
was that the powers objected to any
one power taking the lead In any action
In Turkey, as such a step would be cal
culated to give that power an outward
advance In prestige, which was not part
of the agreement of the powers. In
other words, if action Is to be taken, it
should be combined action upon the
part of the powers, and not the Isolated
action of Great Britain. Thus, It is in
timated that If the passage of the Dar
danelles la to be enforced, it should be
done by the warships of all the powers
interested. This was according to the
original understanding.
The alleged recent firing upon the
British ship Loch Rannooh, In the Dar
danelles, is said by the Turkish of
ficials to be a matter of little Import
ance and easily explained. They say
that the Loch Kannoch arrived after
sundown, and instead of anchoring, at
tempted to proceed, and was signalled
from the shore by a gunshot to bring
up. As she did not do so, a Bccond shot
was fired, and the Loch Rannoch let
go her anchor. Tho shell which is said
to have whizzed over the head of tho
captain a pronounced to have been
nothing more than the wad from tho
signal gun ashcre. This Is the Turkish
explanation of the matter, and is be
lieved to be about correct.
Concerning tlie EvSnltnn.
A great deal of excitement was
caused here today by the report that
ex-Sultan Mohnmmed Murad, who was
deposed on the ground of Idiocy on
Aug. 31, 1ST6, only three months after
he succeeded his deposed uncle, Abdul
Aziz, had escaped from the Ylldiz
Kiosk, where he was kept a close pris
oner. The ex-Sultan, although a cap
tive for nineteen years, Is said to enjoy
good health and to have been Intriguing
with the Young Turks party. As a re
sult, his quarters are examined dally,
sentinels are stationed at all the doors
of his apartments, all his letters are
read before being handed to him or
posted, and at night the keys ,of his
rooms are taken to the Sultan for safo
keeping. He still wears a uniform,
however, is addressed os "Your. Majes
ty," and has a good table, a small libra
ry, and a small hall converted Into a
mosque, as part of his apartments.
The report, it appears, grew out of
the flight of Murad Bey, the Imperial
commissioner of the council of the pub
lic debt, who was also suspected of hav
ing relations with the Young Turks
party. Murad has been watched by the
police for some time. He was suddenly
summoned, to the palace to give an ex
nlanation of his conduct, political and
administrative. He went there In con-
Biderable alarm, ana gave me uuuan
what appeared to be a satisfactory ex
planation of the charges brought
against him, but, the matter being
pressed further, his friends warned him
that his life, a well as his liberty, was
in danger. He therefore fled on board
a Russian ship, and is now well on his
way to Russia.
Information Suppressed.
From the provinces not much news Is
forthcoming today. The Turkish offi
cials are apparently doing everything
possible to suppress any Information
except that which is favorable to tho
government. The utmost secrecy Is ob
served regarding the movements of the
Turkish troops operating from Marash
or Zeltun, and as the latter place is now
reported to be garrisoned by quite an
army of Armenians.the complete silence
as to what Is going on In that district
causes much Interest and anxiety.
If Armenian reports are to be belle-wed,
the Turks will have to lay siege to iel
tun before they will have any chance
of capturing the town, which Is said to
be well supplied with provisions and
ammunition. On the other hand, the
Turks claim to believe that the Arme
nians will surrender at the appearance
of the Sultan's troops.
The Sultan Is Nervous.
London, Dec. 2. The Standard's
Vienna correspondent telegraphs that
he learns from a trustworthy source In
Constantinople that the Sultan Is In
dally fear of sharing the fate of Ismail
Pasha. His courtiers declare that the
Powers have decided to depose him, us
ing for this purpose, the forces aboard
by the second guardshlps, which they
demand shall be permitted to enter the
Bosphorus.
The Berlin correspondent of the
Standard says that if It Is necessary
the warship Hagen will be sent to
Constantinople, the schoolshlp Moltke
being ordered to continue her training
cruise.
NO BIG TARIFF CHANGES.
Speaker Reed Opposed to Any Radical
and Hasty Poller.
Washington, Dec' J. As all legisla
tion relating to revenue and tariff must
originate in the house, ana as Speaker
Reed will have control In a great meas
ure of all Important legislation affect
ing the government finances, his utter
ances in accepting the speakership as
to the duties of congress, are regarded
as significant. If his counsels prevail,
as they probably will, there will be little
legislation excepting the finances and
the tariff, or that will In any manner
disturb or unsettle the business Inter
ests at the coming seston.
The leading Republican members wrio
have talked with him on these subjects,
and who rather favor some tariff legis
lation, such as an Imposition of .a duty
on wool and other articles, including
agriculture, are in much doubt as to
whether he approves of attempting any
tariff 'legislation. . He has said to one
and all who have talked with him that
congress must wait and ascertain what
President Cleveland and Secretary Car
lisle have to say In taelr communications
to congress. If It Is found that It will
bo necessary, to raise mora revenue to
meet existing and future - deficiencies
the Republican leaders can then deter
mine what line of policy shall be pur
sued In order to raise the necessary rev
enue. It 1j evident from what Speaker Reed
has said that whatever is formulated
relating to these questions will be based
entirely, on Republican lines, and car
ried out by the united action of the Re
publican party.
EDITOR GOES TO JAIL.
Sr. Paul Man Refuses to Testify Against
One of Ills Friends.
St. Paul, Dec. 2. Ed. A. Paradis, edi

one of the suburban pnrks of this city,

SEX1T0K PALMER OBJECTS.
Thinks tho Climax of Democratic Idiocy
Would Be tho Nomination of tirover
for a Third Term.
Chicago, Doc. 2. "The Democratic
party litis done many loollsh iIiI.iikh, no
doubt, but In heaven's name let ua not
Violate our most sacred tradition by
nominating Cleveland for a third term."
Bo said Benator John M. Palmer today.-
He said: "I don't think he would ac
cept, but whether he would or not, we
should not think of nominating him
again. I am a supoprter of Cleveland,
but not for a third term either Cleve
land or anybody else. Iet us have a
Western man next time .Morrison, if he
wants it, Carlisle If he will take it.
Legislation this session? There will
be none to speak of, either from cur
rency or to make up the deficiency. We
will be in session about fight months,
president-making. I would not be sur
prised if the sesiun were to bring out
some presidential timber on both Hides
thus far unknown."
Senator Palmer scoffs nt the talk of
war with England over Venezuela, and
says thut If the Cuban Insurgents rep

are fighting for the liberty of the whole
people, lxCt with them. . He believes
that Tr-nner will be tho next governor

TO PROBE ARTESIAN WELLS.
Proposed' Investigation to Ascertain
South Dakota's Wator Supply.
Vermillion, S. D., Dec. 2. Professor
Todd of the State university of South
Dakota, Is at work here upon a plan by
which he expects to determine, by In
vestigations in Wyoming. Montana and
South Dakota, whether or not the arte
sian water supply of thia state is inex
haustible. He was the first geologist
to make a comprehensive study of the
artesian system of South Dakota, and
the importance to the state of such a
determination as he now proposes to
reach, cannot be overestimated.
He has outlined his plan in a general
way to the director of the United States
geological survey, but in cose the mat
ter Is not taken up by the general gov
ernment he will submit it to the next
legislative resslon and ask the nld nnd
support of the state in carrying out his
project.
DIED OF HYDROPHOBIA.
Genuine Case of the Disease Is Reported
from Shamokin.
Shamokln, Fa., Dec. 2.--Oeorge
Shoey. Jr., aged 30 years, died this
morning from hydrophobia. Nine
months ago Shoey was bitten by a mnd
dog but up to Saturday last he felt
no 111 effects from the wound. On Sat
urday Mr. Shoey complained of feeling:
nervous. As the hours passed his ner
vousness Increased and he paced the
floor in agony of restlessness. 'His wife
and two children did all they could to
soothe him. but he grew worse. He
complained that his flesh folt as though
It was being pricked by needles. Tow
ards midnight he began to bark, snap
his teeth and froth at the mouth.
By this time Mrs. Shoey had sum
moned a physician, who, with the aid
of fourmen, tied Shoey down. The un
fortunate man rapidly srrew worse and
went from paroxysm to paroxysm un
til he died.
PROF. DYCIIE'S AMBITION.
He Desires to Make Another Search for
the North Pole.
Kansas City, Mo Dec. 2. Prof. Dy
che, of the Kansas University, said to
day that he had practically decided to
make another trip to the Arctic ocean
In search of the pole, having received an
offer of assistance, but he declines to
name the source of the offer. It Is sup
posed that American museum,1 under
whose auspices he Joined the Peary ex
pedition, has something to do with the
offer, .
The professor said the Insufficiency of
the food supply has been the sole cause
of the failure of previous expeditions
and that given plenty to eat he will get
to the North Pole as enslly as he Kot
within 800 miles of It. His present plan
Is to creep around the west coast of
Greenland and then make a dash for the
pole by sledge or boat.

MAY CONTROL THE SENATE
Yesterday's Caucus Demonstrates the
Republican Strength.
SILVER SENATORS FAVORABLE
There Seems No Question That Four of
the Populist Senators Will Vote with
Kcpubllcans on tho Reorgani
zation of the Body.
Washington, Dec. 2. The caucus held
this afternoon by tho Republican sena
tors, although devoid of positive action,
demonstrated the fact that probably
a successful attempt will soon be made
to reorganize the senate In both com
mit tes and elective ofllcers. The sena
tors were pot in snusion moro than half
an hour, but during that brief period
there was a ueneral clearing of tho at
mosphere, which had been somewhat
obscured by the action of a few senators
who met Saturday nlftht for the pur
pose of preparing a plan of action that
should result In takltis th" mnnnpo
nicnt of tho senate out of tho hands of
the older members.
Tiie result of this afternoon's talk
Is ix reconciliation of conflicting ele
ments and the establishment of n sin
cere desire on the part of nil those pres
ent to do that which Is for tho best
Interest of the whole party.
Senator Frye was surjw steil as pres
ident pro tern, nnd no otlier name wan
mentioned. He will bo nominated, but
it was deemed useless to do anything
in the matter today for the reason that
no president pro tern, enn be elected so
long os the vice president fills the
chair. If the Republicans can show
the Democrats that they have enough
votes to elect the president pro tern, the
selection will be held. :t Is understood
that Mr. Sherman is to consult with the
opposition caucus rhalrmun and ar
range for a timo for this vote to bo
taken. If. by that time the Republi
cans have agreed upon a candidate for
the other offices, the whole ticket will
be placed In the field.
Populist Support Certain.
Of course In order to organize the sen
ate the Republicans must have two
votes outside of those In their own
ranks mid Senators Stewart nnd Junes,
of Nevada, are generally locked upon
r.s the men who will vote with the Re
publicans on organization. It was point
ed out that tho silver men were en
deavoring to secure an organisation on
monetary lineB; that the Populists were
considering a ticket and that tlie Demo
crats were not prepared to surrender
their control. The silver Republicans
and Democrats thl3 morning Informed
the PopuliBls thnt they could not Join in
any effort to organize on silver llnes.and
as soon asthel'opulists.whoarethemuln
advocates of the plan, are convinced
they cannot be successful, it 1st claimed
that they will divide, according to their
predilections for tho two great parties
Messrs.AiJen und Kyle with tlie Demo
crats, and Mesrs. Jones, Stewart, But
ler nnd Peffer with the Republicans.
The Republicans need two out of these
four votes. The Republicans say that
all differences will be removed and that
when they place a ticket In the field It
will have tho necessary majority. It Is
hardly probable, however, that this re
organization will be effected before the
holidays.

knocked a glass of water out of Orano's
hand. That same night the young men
met under Mlda Alfaro's window and
words led' to blows. . The result - was
a challenge Jby Orano, which was

rest went ashore.
