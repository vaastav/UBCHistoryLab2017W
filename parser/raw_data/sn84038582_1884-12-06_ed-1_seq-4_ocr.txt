THE MESSAGE.
valfilicMiy liu'siuge of
The val.'illctoiy liiesisugo oi iit'Miie
Arthur will 1l fouiul on our inner page
iiml Is worthy of a careful perusal. It give
an iinusii'illy t'leur aud coini'ieliensive re
view of tlie condition of tli country in it
domestk' and foielirn relations, and cover
a "i-eat vailetv of topics, some of whl
must coin eiitnite the attention of the conn
ti-vfura i'ixl while to c Hue. The tariff
excise tax ami other .source- ot national re
venue are overhauled; the construction
a navy, the- opening of channels of foreig
trade' tin reform of the civil service, th
revision of the ele toial laws, the Mormon
Mrolilcm. our currency difllcultles, the Mex
lean treaty, the new Spanish treaty, th
Nicaragua canal, aud a variety of other
subjects U lnotight forward, enough to oc
atipy the attention of congress and the exe
cittive lor another lull presidential term
Instead of the meager ninety days remain
lug to Mr. Arthur.
The Message.it is almost needless to say,
Is more satisfactory to the Democrats tha
to the Hepubllcims. Ou the tariff and reve
title questions the President's sympathies
are manifestly against the high protection
Ideas of Maine and his followers, and lein
to the deunx ratic side of taritT reduction
mid revenue reform; aud while he appar
ently despairs of accomplishing these ob
jects by direct legislation, his earnestness
iu pie-slug the necessary legislation to car
ry iuto effect tbe Mexican treaty, his advo
cacy of the speedy confirmation of the new
Snanish treaty, and his argument In favor
of entering Into similar liberal commercial
treaties with all the South American states
Indicate that he would rely rather on the
treaty making ower than on congress to
bring atiout a more liberal policy In regard
to our foreign trade.
The Republicans are not backward in
seeing that this policy of entering lutotrea
ties like the Mexican and Spanish treaties
will prove only an entering wedge to free
trade, while the democrats are ready to ad
uitt that inch treaties with the South Ame
rican states at least have been In the line of
democratic policy for years.
Heiieattng his former recouimeudatious
lu regard to the suspension of silver coin
age, and the revision of the naturalization
laws so that they shall cease to afford pro
tection to criminal enterprises against the
peace of nations with which we are friend
ly ; urging the enactment of a uew bank
rupt law, and the abolition of the territorial
government of Utah, the President grace
fully concludes a message evidently pre
pared with great care, by thanking congress
and the country for the good will and sup
port both have given him during his occu
pancy of the executive chair, to which he
was called under such painful circum
stances and with si many misgivings.
BUSINESS 0UTLO0K-
There U leally a gleam of hope from
prominent industrial centers at the east, of
brighter times ahead. The Pittsburg Iron
manufacturers report orders for their prod
uct on the Increase, and prices improvln,
Two rolling mills, which had suspended
operations for a month or two, w ill resume
on Monday. A Hint glass factory In the
tame city, which had decided on a reduc
tion of wages lias canceled the order. The
Kdgar Thompson Iron works, w hich em
ploy live thousand men, will resume with
the 1st of January. Iron is a fair index of
general business, being In such general
use. So that should the prospect of this
commodity continue to improve we may
look for a general revival of business.
While there Is no sympathy for that ar
rant old humbug, Signal Ortlcer Haen, on
account of the "dressing dow n" he gets in
the lat annual report of Secretary of War
Lincoln, it may be well questioned whether
the latter has kept within the bounds of
good taste or official propriety In the mat
ter. den. Ilazen, in hit renrt, had under
taken to criticise the course ot the Secre
tary of War and of the Navy in lss;t In
ef using, after the wreck of the Portens, to
send a second expedition to the relief of
the (Jreeley party, maintaining that there
was time to do .so and that such an expedi
tion would have been successful. Secre
tary Lincoln justly characterizes such an
expression of opinion on the part of the
Signal Officer as a piece of Impertinence,
and then shows, by the finding of the court
of inquiry iu the Porteua cae, that the sug
gestion is as wim ami Irrational us it is im
pudent. Secretary Lincoln, however.
should h ive lememltered that the Signal
Officer I a sulmrdinate of the Secretary of
War aud makes his report to the latter,
who, it would seem, at least, ought to have
returned Ihzen's reit and insisted on
the offensive imrtioii lielng stricken out
rather than have lowered hiiuell by pro
ceeding In this llio-t ex'raonliieii v wiy to
give him a "drcss'.tiic down."
The nWncf of W. 1). Kelly, the 2ieat
Penu-ylvanla champion of protei tion nnd
"father of the House," at the opening
-ion of Cotigre at Washington on Mon
day was generally remarked, and accounted
for on the srore of old age and failing
health. The truth appear1- to lie, however,
that he is grief stricken over the marriage
of his daughter to a Russian Nihilist. He
had snt her to n famous -chool in rma
ny to be educated aud she was making
progress that delighted her father's heart.
Then came the news of her clandestine
marriage to a man of whom her parents
knew nothing except that he was driven
out of Uussia as a Nihilist conspirator. If
Mr. Kelly had acted consistently w ith his
protection teachings, and patronized home
universities instead of the cheap universi
ties of Kurope, he might never have been
visited by such an affiictlon.
The Poi'i i.Ait Vote. The total vote ot
the U. S., cast at the late Presidential elec
tion, was 10,4t)l,16S. The Kepubllcan pa
pers are publishing a table of this vote, by
which they figure out a majority of .VH3
In favor of Maine over Cleveland. To do
this, however, they deduct from Cleve
laud's vote the vote cast for the mixed
Cleveland and Uutler tickets In Michigan
&c, and credit the vote to Hutler, while
no such deduction Is made from Maine's
vote in Missouri, West Vlrglula and other
states where there was a fusion on Maine
and Hutler electoral tickets. Figuring the
vote a it was actually cast, without at
tempting the obvious impossibility of sep
arating the Hutler from the votes for Cleve
land or Maine votes in the luslon states,
and the exact majority for Cleveland over
Maine ou the popular vote Is oll.aso.
THE LEMAN-3RAND CASE.
The Leman-Brand case In Cook county,
involving the senator for the sixth district,
was terminated for the present on Monday
by the heroic action of Gov. Hamilton in
deciding that the majority shown for llnind
on the face of the returns was fraudulent
and issuing the certificate of election to
Leman. The Governor justifies hi action
by a w ritten argument nearly as long as the
President's message, but it is needless to
say that whatever justification he Is able to
present for his action, he utterly fails to
show by what authority a purely minister
ial officer, charged w ith the simple duty of
footing up the returns regularly laid before
him and Issuing certificates of election to
the jiersons appearing to b elected on
their face, can go behind the face ot those
returns, and decide a contested elec tion
case over which the constitution gives the
body to which the contestants claim to
have been elected (In this case the state
Senate) the exclusive jurisdiction. It i
ertaln that not only the attorney geueral,
but other eminent lawyers of both parties
in Springfield, advised the Governor that
he had no such authority. The reason for
the law is, that If the Governor has the
power to judge and determine, in advance
of the organization of the chambers, w hat
persons shall be admitted to seats, it is
plain that the chambers may be composed
according to the wish of a governor who Is
not afraid to "take the bull by the horns."
It Is obvious, then, that the power which
Governor Hamilton has asserted and exer
cised strikes a fatal blow at the very foun
dation of popular legislative government.
The action of Governor Hamilton In the
case, however, will probably escajie much
of the censure It deserves from the fact,
now pretty generally admitted, though yet
by no means demonstrably proved, that the
majority In favor of Brand on the face of
the returns was really the result of a fraud
In the 2d precinct of the lXth ward. The
trongest presumption In favor of the fraud
s the fact, that from the tickets found in
the ballot lo.x It appears that Leman's own
father and brother-in-law had voted against
him though both had worked for him at
the polls. Then It Is also proved that certain
jwrtles pnxmred to be engraved and printed
number of tickets which were an exact
fac simile of the Kepubllcan ticket used
on election day, mid the procuring of such
tickets in a clandestine way Is inferred to
have no honest purjHise, though in what
way they were used and how they could
ave gotten into the ballot box Is a great a
mystery as ever. However, Brand himself
idmits that appearances are so greatly
gainst the honesty of the majority in his
favor, that he makes no objection to the
Governor's Issue of the certificate to Leman,
though he will insist on the matter being
lfted to the bottom bv the Senate, in
hlch he will contest Leman's right to hold
the seat.
The great sensation just now in New
Orleans Is the partly successful attempt,
last Sunday, of two sisters to kill two young
men, their betrayers, by shooting them on
the street. John Logan, engaged in the
foundry business, and Joseph Devonshire,
deputy I". S. Marshal, two well-to-do
iiing men, had made the acquaintance of
osephine and Georgian:! Conway, two
beautiful young ladies, sister, of respeet-
ble family and moving lu good society.
Having by promises of marriage succeeded
u ruining the sisters, and then casing
them off, the latter armed themselves w ith
mil dog pistols, and ou Sunday meeting
the young men on the street opened hreon
them. One of them Logan was fatally
hot, but the other escaped with slight
ounds. The girls are In the lockup but
ill doubtless escape on the plea of "emo
tional insanity.
The I'ulversltv of Wisconsin, at Madi

The Week.
Foreign.
Gladstone has won a victory for his suf
frage extension scheme In the British par
liament by coupling w ith It his "distribu
tion" bill, by which Is meant what iu this
couutry would be called a reapportionment
of the country iuto districts for the election
of members to parliament. The bill wipes
out the last of the 11 rotten boroughs" and
apjtortlous representation in parliament in
accordance w ith jiopulation. The scheme
seems to find tavor with Parnell and the
Irish members because it dhides the lar
ger cities Into districts or wards, thus giv
ing Irishmen a chance to elect members
in England In many districts where the
Irish predominate. The indications are that
b ith this bill and the franchise bill will be
passed at an early day.
Gen. Wolsley, in bis effort In Egypt to
reach Khart U u w ith an army for the re
lief of Gen. Gordon, has worked his way
up the Nile as fai as Shendy, but does not
expec t to reach Khartoum before February.
Meantime messages from Gordon show
that he is in no imminent danger. A re
port comes to Wolsley for the dozenth
time that the El Mahdl is dead, but nobody
believes it.
Frauce has given up all hope of peace
with China, and has sent forward 13,000
reinforcements to the army In Towpiin.
China seems to have got her mad up and
will coutinue the fight a httrnee, as the
French say.
Domestic.
Congress re assembled on Monday with
a quorum present In both houses. There
was so little Interest that the galleries were
not more than halt full In either hi use. In
the Semite Gen. Logan seemed to be the
object of most attention, aud his seat, like
that of some other Senators, was gorgeous
ly decorated with flowers. Beyond reading
the president's message, on Monday no
business was done In either house except
the formal announcement of the death of
Senator Anthony In the Senate, and of Dun
can and Evans in the house. The proceed
ings in both houses up to Thursday, when
they adjourned over to Monday, have been
equally barren of Interest. A few new
bills were introduced In the senate, Includ
ing the inevitable one to stop the coinage
of silver. A breezy discussion arose in the
house on Wednesday over a resolution
which was adopted to Investigate the con
duct of Lot Wright, l S. Marshal at Cin
cinnati, for his introduction of Johnny
Davenport ways at the October election In
Ohio. A bill wis passed to mane tempo
rary provision for the navy, and a session
was spent in discussing the Reagan later
state commerce bill. It seems to be under
stood that the present democratic majority
lu the house Is averse t the consideration
of any important business at this session
outside of the appropriations, and it would
not be surprising, therefore, if a recess of
two weeks was assented to to enable the
members to attend the opening of the great
exposition at New Orleans.
Among the many reports laid before the
present congress none perhaps Is more re
markable than that of the I'tah Commis
sion, appointed two years ago, and which
now submits its first report. Considering
the lugubrious nature of Its contents, how
ever, It Is nut strange that they have been
iu uo hurry. In spite of their continued
presence in the territory, they say, commis
sioned to enforce to the letter the Edmunds
bill, which is espec ially directed against
polygamy, there were more Hilygaiuous
marriages during their stay there than in
any other period of a similar length. The
Insolence of Mormon! m Is something ap
palling. It d'ul not deign even to veil its
most hideous features when cont'ronteu by
the representative of the party of the
gixxl, the tine, and the beautiful. If pos
sible, this aggravates the offense of polyg
my, and should bring down on it condign
punishment. The commission, however,
have no remedy to propose but the pa
sage of more laws, w hich, as the stringent
law- already passed have utterly failed,
seems to offer little hope of success as a
mean to circumvent the wicked polyga
mist. Secretary Lincoln reports that during the
past year no soldier has fired a musket at
an Indian. He states that constant hand
ling of the rolls In the office ot the adjutant
general has made their reoopylug necessa
ry. a takwhich will require the services
of one hundred clerks for three years.
There is no use of .sending bull pups,
tame bears, or presents of that kind to
President Cleveland. To an enthusiastic
admirer in Brooklyn, who sent him a fine
Newfoundland dog, the new president
writes a very courteous note, declining the
present aud advising the doner that the an
imal has been carefully returned tree of
charge. He will accept of no presents of
any kiud from a bull pup up to a palatial
Philadelphia mansion.

8E0RETAEY McCULLOCH'S REPORT.
Next In rank and Importance to the Pre
sldent's Message, among the documents
sent to congress at the opening of the. ses
sion, is the rcjxirt of the Secretary of the
Treasury. To him pertain the great ques
tlons of tariff, revenue, trade, currency, &c,
topics which always occupy the leading
place in party platforms and are the prin
cipal themes of discussion in all our great
political campaigns.
Yet It Is uot a little curious that while In
the late presidential campaign the Repub
llcan party txk high protection ground on
the tariff question, the finance secretary of
the same party, In his first communication
to congress after the campaign is over, un
ceremoniously steps down from thnt stilted
platform aud virtually takes his place on
that of the opposite party. Whereas all
good republicans who believe In the gospel
of Pennsylvania as preached by Blaine re
gard home Industry, home markets and
home consumption as the prime objects
to strive after aud believe that the Atlantic
should have been made an ocean of fire and
not of water, Mr. McCulloch places before
the couutry as the great question to be con
sldered, the finding of foreign market? for
our manufactured gotxlsand the restoration
of our balance of trade w ith Brazil and the
South American republics.
Instead of wanting more protection, he
says our manufactures are suffering be
cause, pampered by extreme protection
they have grown and multiplied until they
make more goods of every description than
our home demand warrants, and on account
of irrational impositions on raw materials
and obstructive shipping regulations, they
are debarred from competition with Eng
land and other countries In foreign mar.
kets. "If the duties on raw materials are
an obstruction, they should lie removed,"
he says. "If the duties on other articles
(by unnecessarily raising their price) are an
obstruction, they should be modified." The
great points to be aimed at, he holds, are, 1
"That the public revenues shall not be In
excess of what Is required for the support
of the government ; and, 2d, that our man
ufactures which under the fostering care
of the government have attained such gl
gantic proportions, should not be put In
jeopardy by radical changes in the tariff,
but that reductions of import duties should
be made with a view to their ultimate ad
vantage by opening to them markets from
which they are now in a large degree ex
cluded." Why, Is not this copying with a
closeness borderiug on plagiarism the very
words of Speaker Carlisle In his speech at
the free trade dinner In New York last
winter? Like Speaker Carlisle, he holds
that 'free trade Is Impossible because of
the necessity which exists for levying im
port duties to meet the wants of the gov
ernment, but though such duties should be
levied for revenue only, they must necessa
r'.ly be largely protective."
"For revenue only!" Well, no one will
think of looking for that phrase In a repub
lican platform, though It may not be found
in every democratic platform.
As a cotemporary observes, it was thought
wheu President Arthur bad such a s rlous
; struggle to find a man for Secretary of the
Treasury that he might have gone so far as
to appoint a republican, but he seems to
have been seeking a man of genius, and he
certainly found one who has opinions
in abundaace, boundless Information and
the courage of his convictions, however
dangerous they may be to the maintenance
of the harmony of the republican party.
The war lu passenger rates between the
East and West, which has been raging with
more or less violence for several weeks
past, continues with unabated fury. Tickets
between New York and Chicago are now
selling at $7.o0, the scalpers cutting about
half a dollar below those rates. The roads
leading ofliu the strife arefhe West Shore
and Erie, the New York Central and the
Delaware and Lackaw ana, though the B. &
O. and Pennsylvania Central are obliged to
onform partly to the low rates.
At the same time the war between Chi-
cago ami m. units ami .Missouri river
points was brought to a close on Tuesday ,and
a new agreement entered Into which re
stores all passengers rate between Chicago
tnd Missouri river xdnts, between Chi
cago and St. Louis, and between St. Louis
and the Missouri river. The agreement
fixes the new rates between Chicago and
Missouri river points between Council
Bluffs and Kansas City at 12..0; between
Chicago and St. Louis, $7.o0; between St.
Louis and Missouri river points, $7.50. The
old rate before the war were $14.70, f$.70,
and f ..-0, respectively.
No doubt Gen. Logan feels quite as bad
over his defeat as Blaine does, but he has
tbe grace and sense to take It good humor
edly and not to vent his feelings in howls
of iuipoteit rage. He told a reporter as he
passed through New York the other day
ou hi way to Washington. "I feel," said
the General, "like the man who stublied
his toe. and replied to a sympathetic neigh-
bor, 'I'm tixj big to cry. and It hurts text
bad for me to laugh.' " Logan Is a sound
er philosopher and a lietter man than

. Washington Letter.
Washington, Dec. 1, 1884. The House
and Senate convened to-day In the usual
way. The galleries were crowded with
Interested spectators who looked down on
the legislative bcxlles below, and comment
ed upon the ajqiearance of well known
public men, or tried to read In their faces
the history of the battles they had fought
since the adjournment five months ago. 1
fancied the Democrats looked less elated
than the Republicans lcxked depressed.
The defeat of Blaine was aterrlole and un
expected blow, and to those Republicans
who live by politics, it means ruin. It is
the opinion of shrewd politicians with
whom I have talked that the Republican
party will never again make an effective
rally. It has lost Its money chest the
United States Treasury; It has lost the
prestige of victory. Since Appomattox
the party has had no mission, no ralson
d'etre. It has no means of livelihood and
nothing to live for. Why should It live at
all:
Democratic members of congress natur
ally make the incoming administration
their chief topic of couversatlon. They all
think the president elect will hasten slow
ly. A great scramble for place will, of
course, occur, and many changes will be
made in the federal offices, but the
changes will not be made until after delib
eration and until sufficient time has been
taken to select the right man. The good
of the service requires numerous changes.
The post ofllces of the south are filled with
men who are politicians and partisan wor
kers firsn last and all the time. The care
of the post offices is turned over to the
clerks, while the post master devotes him
self to politics, such as persuading the col
ored people that Democratic success mjans
negro slavery.
These and other political worken will
go sans ceremonle. The barnacles that
have accumulated on the ship of state dur
ing her long cruise of twenty-four years
will be scraped off.
In the several departments here the pre
vailing idea Is that at first only the heads
of departments, bureaus aud divisions
those whose authorities and responsibilities
are of a character that will render it 1m
portant for them to be la political accord
with the executive, will be removed. Then
it is thought that such changes w ill grad
ually follow as the newly appointed chiefs
will reommend as necessary to the efficient
administration of their various offices.
One prominent democrat, whose relations
with his party management during the re
cent campaign give him facilities for know-
ing what the plans of the President elect
are, has written to friends and constituents
who have sought his aid in obtaining office,
that hurry on their part will not accomplish
anything. He has advised his friends that
Gov. Cleveland is determined not to give
his attention to matters presidential until
he is freed from the office and duties of
Governor.
There Is a wide spread misconception in
the minds of department people upon the
earing of the civil service and rules upon
the subject of removals. It is believed by
many that in some way classified clerks
are "protected" from removal, except "for
cause," by the act and rules made to carry
It Into effect. The truth is that there Is
not a word in the act bearing upon remov
als. The whole machinery Is constructed
to regulate admissions. It was not design
ed to treat of removals. Under our consti
tution, It Is a very difficult matter to limit
the power of removal. So far it has not
even been attempted.
Congressmen are besieged with ques
tions as to the coming cabinet. While
none express any positive convictions, all
agree that those who may be chosen by
Mr. Cleveland will be chosen ior their fit
ness, capability and honesty, and nothing
else.
Mr. Randall and his committeemen in
tend to keep the House busy with appro
priation bills during the early part of the
session, and to dispose ot them as rapidly
as possible. But little Is proposed in the
way of new legislation to those bills, and
an effort will be made to postpone all im
portant changes in the laws relative to the
organization of the Government until next
. r- . rr
year, wuen tne rresmeni aim iiouse oi
Representatives may be expected to be in
harmony.
