larec'ully Commended— Fanon
und Fiuit Kaisern,
Washington, Dec. 3.—The message of
President Cleveland to the members of
the second session of the Fifty-third
congress was read in the house by Clerk
Kerr and in the senate by Secretary
Cox. The reading began at 1:30 and con
sumed about two hours. Following is
the message in full:
Message to the congress of the United
States:
The assemblage within the nation's
legislative hall of those charged with
the duty of making laws for the benefit
of a generous and free people, impress
ively suggests the exacting obligation
and inexorable responsibility involved
in their task. At the threshold of such
labor now to be undertaken by the
congress of the United States and in the
discharge of an executive duty enjoined
by the constitution, I submit this com
munication, containing a brief state
ment of the constitution of our national
affairs and recommending.sueh legisla
tion as seems to me necessary and
pedient.
The history of our recent dealings
with other nations, and our peaceful
lations with them at this time, addi
tionally demonstrates the advantage of
consistently adhering to a firm but just
foreign policy, free from envious or am
bitious national schemes and character
ized by entire honesty and sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a
law of congress, commissioners were ap
pointed to the Antwerp Industrial Ex
position. Although the participation of
American exhibitors fell far short of
completely illustrating our national in
genuity and industrial achievements,
yet it was still creditable, in view of the
brief time allowed for preparation.
I have endeavored to impress upon the
Belgian government the needlessness
and positive harmfulness of its restric
tions upon the importation of certain
of our products and have strongly urged
that the rigid supervision and inspec
tion under our laws are amply sufficient
to prevent the exportation from this
country of diseased cattle and unwhole
some meat.

BRAZILIAN MATTERS.
The termination of the civil war* in
Brazil has been followed by general
prevalence of peace and order. It ap
pearing at an early stage of the insur
rection that its course would call for
unusual watchfulness on the part of
this government, our naval force in the
harbor of Rio de Janeiro was strength
ened. This precaution I am satisfied
tended to restrict the issue to a sim
ple trial of strength between the Bra
zilian government and the insurgents,
and to avert complications which at
times seemed imminent. Our firm at
titude of neutrality was maintained to
the end. The insurgents received the
encouragement of an eventual asylum
from our commanders and such opposi
tion as they encountered was for the
protection of our commerce and was
clearly justified by public law.
A serious tension of relations hav
ing arisen at the close of the war be
tween Brazil and Portugal by reason
of the escape of the insurgent Admiral
Da Gama and his followers, the friend
ly offices of our representatives to
these countries were exercised for the
protection of the subjects of either with
in the territory of the other.
Although the government of Brazil
was duly notified that the commercial
arrangement existing between the
United States and that country, based
on the third section of the tariff act of
1890, was abrogated on August 26, 1894,
by the taking effect of the tariff law in
force, that government subsequently
notified the United States of its inten
tion to terminate such an arrangement
on the first day of January, 1895, in the
exercise of the right reserved in the
agreement between the two countries.
I invite attention to the correspondence
between the secretary of state and the
Brazilian minister on this subject.
The commission organized under the
convention which we had entered into
with Chile for the settlement of the out
standing claims of each government
against the other, adjourned at the end
of the period stipulated for its contin
uance, leaving undetermined u number
of American cases, which had been
duly presented. These claims are not
barred, and negotiations are in progress
for their submission to a tribunal the
17th of March next.
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AN1) JAPAN
Friendly Offices of Our Government to
Effect Peace.
The new treaty with China was signed
at Washington and on August 13 it
received the sanction of the senate.
Ratification on the part of China and a
formal exchange are awaited to give
effect to this mutually beneficial con
vention.
A gratifying recognition of the uni
form impartiality of this country tow
ards all foreign states was manifested
by the coincident request of the Chin
ese and Japanese governments that the
agents of the United States should,
within the proper limif, afford protec
tion to the subjects of the other, dur
ing the suspension of diplomatic rela
tions due to a state of war. This deli
cate office was accepted and a misap
prehension which gave rise to the belief
that in affording this kindly unofficial
protection our agents would exercise
the same authority which the with
drawn agents of the belligerents had ex
ercised was promptly corrected.
Although the war between China and
Japan Indorses no policy of the Unit
ed States, it deserves our gravest con
sideration by reason of Its disturbance
of our growing commercial interests
in the two countries and the increased
dangers which may result ,to our citi
zens domiciled or sojourning in the in
terior of China. Acting under a stipula
tion in our treaty with Corea (the first
concluded with a western power), I
felt constrained at the beginning of the
controversy to tender our good offices
to induce an amicable arrangement of
the initial difficulty growing out of the
Japanese demands for administrative
reform in Corea, but the unhappy pre
cipitation of actual hostilities defeated
this kindly purpose,
destructive war between the two most
powerful of the eastern nations and
anxious that our commercial interests
in the countries may be preserved and
that the safety of our citizens there
shall not be jeopardized. I would not
hesitate to heed any intimation that
our friendly aid for the honorable ter
mination of hostilities would be ac
ceptable to both belligerents.
OTHER RELATIONS.
A convention has been finally con
cluded for the settlement by arbitra
tion of the prolonged dispute with Ec
uador, growing out of the proceedings
against Emilio Santos, a naturalized
citizen of the United States.
Our relations with the republic of
France continue to be such as should
exist between nations so long bound
together by friendly sympathy and
similarity in their form of government.
The recnt cruel assassination of the
president of this sister republic called
forth such universal expressions of sor
row and condolence from our people
and government as to leave no doubt
of the depth and sincerity of our attach
ment. The resolutions passed by the
senate and house of representatives on
the occasion have been communicated
to the widow of President Carnot.
Deploring the
EMBARGO ON MEATS.
Acting upon the reported discovery of
Texas fever in cargoes of American im
portations of livestock and fresh meats
from this country,
against them has been revived,
hoped that Germany will soon become
convinced that the inhibition is
needless as it is harmful to mutual in
terests.

The German government has excepted
against that provision of the customs
section of the tariff act which imposes
a discriminating duty of one-tenth of a
cent a pound on sugars coming from
countries paying an export bounty
thereon, claiming that the enaction of
such a duty is in contravention of Arti
cles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1826 with
Prussia. In the interests of the com
I
merce of both countries, and to avoid
even the accusation of treaty violation.
I recommend the repeal of so much of
the statute as imposes that duty, and
I invite attention to the accompanying
report of the secretary of state, contain

by the German protests.
PROTECTION TO SEALS.
Early in the present year an agree
ment was reached with Great Britain
concerning instructions to be given
to the naval commanders of the govern
ments in Bering sea and the contiguous
North Pacific ocean, for their guidance
in the execution of the award of the
Paris tribunal of arbitration and the en
forcement of the regulations therein
prescribed for the protection of seal life
in the waters mentioned,
standing has also been reached for the
payment by the United States of $425,
000 in full satisfaction of all claims
which may be made by Great Britain
for damages growing out of the contro
versy as to fur seals in Bering sea, or
the seizure of British vessels engaged in
taking seals in these waters,
award and findings of the Paris tribu
nal, to a great extent, determined the
facts and principles upon which these
claims should be adjusted, and they
have been subjected by both govern
ments to a thorough examination upon
the principles as well as the facts which
they Involve. I am convinced that a
settlement upon the terms made would
be an equitable and advantageous one,
and I recommend that provision be
made for the prompt payment of the
stated sum.
and Portugal have signified their wil
lingness to adhere to the regulations es
tablished under the award of the Paris
tribunal of arbitration.
BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan
boundary and a preparatory examina
tion of the question of protection of
food fishes in the contiguous waters of
the United States and the Dominion of
Canada are in progress
The boundary of British Guinea still
remains in dispute between Great Brit
ain and Venezuela. Believing that its
early settlement on a just basis alike
honorable to both parties is in the line
of our established policy to remove from
this hemisphere all causes of difference
with powers beyond the sea, I shall
renew the efforts heretofore made to
bring about a restoration of diplomatic
relations between the two disputants,
and to induce arbitration, a resort
which Great Britain so conspicuously
favors in principle and respects in prac
tice and which is earnestly sought by
her weaker adversary.

EXTENSIVE FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Hawaii, Mexico, Nicaragua and Other
Nations Touched Upon.
Since communicating the voluminous
correspondence In regard to Hawaii and
the action taken by the senate and
house of representatives on certain
questions submitted to the Judgment
and wider discretion of congress, the
organization of a government in place
of the provisional arrangement which
followed the deposition of the queen has
been announced, with evidence of its
effective operation. The recognition us
ual in such cases has been accorded the
new government.
Under the present treatise of extradi
tion with Italy, miscarriages of justice
have occurred, owing to the refusal
of that government to surrender its
own subjects. Thus far our efforts to
negotiate an amended convention obvi
ating this difficulty have been unavail
ing.
Apart from the war In which the isl
and empire is engaged, Japan attracts
increasing attention in this country
by her evident desire to cultivate more
liberal intercourse with us and to seek
our kindly aid in furtherance of her
domestic affairs and full equality in
the family of nations. The Japanese
empire of today is no longer the Japan
of the past and our relations with this
progressive nation should be no less
broad and liberal than those with other
powers.
WITH MEXICO.
Good will, fostered by many interests
in common, has marked our relations
with our nearest southern neighbors.
Peace being restored along her north
ern frontier, Mexico has asked the pun
ishment of the late disturbers of her
tranquility. There ought to be a new
treaty of commerce and navigation
with that country to take the place of
the one which terminated thirteen
years ago. The friendliness of the in
tercourse between the two countries
is attested by the fact that during this
long period the commerce of each has
steadily increased under the rule of
mutual consideration, neither being
stimulated by conventional arrange
ments or retarded by jealous rivalries
or selfish distrust.
An indemnity tendered by Mexico as
a gracious act for the murder in 1887
of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen,
by a band of marauders in Durango,
has been accepted and is being paid in
installments.
The problem of the storage and use
of the waters of the Rio Grande for
irrigation should be solved by appro
priate concurrent action of the two
interested nations. Rising in the Col
orado heights, the stream flows inter
mittently, yielding little water during
the dry months to the irrigating chan
nels already constructed along its
course. This scarcity is often felt in
the regions where the river forms a
common boundary. Moreover the fre
quent changes in its course through
level lands often raise embarrassing
questions of territorial jurisdiction.
BLUEFIELDS INCIDENT.
Prominent among the questions of
the year was the Bluefields incident, in
what is known as the Mosquito Indian
strip, bordering on the Atlantic ocean
and within the Jurisdiction of Nicar
agua. By the treaty of 1860 between.
Great Britain and Nicaragua, the form
er government recognized the sover
eignty of the latter over the strip and a
limited form of self government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to
be exercised according to their custom
for themselves and other dwellers with
in its limits.
The so-called native gov
ernment, which grew to be largely
made up of aliens, for many years dis
puted the sovereignty of Nicaragua
over the strip and claimed the right to
maintain therein a practically inde
pendent municipal government. Early
in the past year the efforts of Nicaragua
to maintain sovereignty over the Mos
quito territory led to serious disturb
ances, culminating in the suppression
of the native government and the at
tempted substitution of an impractica
ble composite administration, in which
Nicaragua and the alien residents
were to participate. Failure was fol
lowed by an insurrection, which for a
time subverted Nicaragua's rule,
polling her officers, and restoring the
old organization. This in turn gave
place to the existing local government,
established and upheld by Nicaragua.
Although the alien interests arraigned
against Nicaragua in these transactions
have been largely American, and the
commerce of that region for some time
has been and still is chiefly controlled
by our citizens, we cannot for that rea
son challenge the rightful sovereignty
of Nicaragua over this important part
of her domain. For some months be
fore and during part of the time two of
our naval ships have been stationed at
Bluefields for the protection of all legit
imate interests of our citizens.
In September last the government at
Managua expelled from its territory 12
or more foreigners, including two Amer
icans, for alleged participation in the
seditious or revolutionary movements
against the republic at Bluefields al
ready mentioned, but through the earn
est remonstrance of this government,
the Americans have been permitted to
return to the peaceful management of
their business. Our naval commanders
at the scene of these disturbances, by
their constant exhibition of firmness
and good judgment, contributed large
ly to the prevention of more serious con
sequences and to the restoration of quiet
and order.
I regret that in the midst of these oc
currences there happened a most grave
and irritating failure of Nicaragua jus
tice. An American citizen named Wil
son, residing at Rama, in the Mosquito
territory, was murdered by one Ar
guello, the acting governor of the
town. After some delay, the murderer
was arrested, but was so insecurely con
fined or guarded that he escaped, and,
notwithstanding our repeated demands,
it is claimed that his recapture has
been impossible by reason of his flight
beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nicaraguan authorities, having
given notice of the forfeiture of the con
cession to the canal company on grounds
purely technical and not embraced in
ex
the contract, have receded from that
position.
SYMPATHY FOR PERU.
Peru, I regret to say, shows
symp
toms of domestic disturbances, due
probably to the slowness of her
recuper
ation from the distresses of the war of
1881.
Weakened In resources, her diffi
culties in framing international obli
gations invite our kindly sympathy and
Justly our forbearance in pressing
long-pending claims. I have felt con
strained to testify this sympathy in
connection with certain demands
gently preferred by other powers.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
The recent death of the czar of Rus
sia called forth appropriate expressions
of sorrow and sympathy on the part of
our government with his bereaved fam
ily and the Russian people. As a furth
er demonstration of reciprocal friend

Occasion has been found to urge upon
the Russian government equality of
treatment for our great life insurance
companies, whose operations have been
extended throughout Europe. Admit
ting, as we do, foreign corporations to
transact business in the United States,

for our own interests in ample fields of

THE EZETA CASE.
The government of Salvador having
been overthrown by an abrupt popular
outbreak certain of its military and
civil officers, while hotly pursued by
infuriated insurgents sought refuge
board of the United States warshinp
Bennington, then lying in South Ameri
can ports. Although the practice of
asylum is not favored by this govern
ment, yet in view of the imminent peril
which threatened the fugitives and sole
ly from considerations of humanity,
they were afforded shelter by our naval
commander, and when afterwards de
manded under our treaty of extradition
with Salvador for trial on the charges
of murder, arson and robbery, I directed
that such of them as had not voluntar
ily left the ship be conveyed to one of
our nearest ports, where a hearing could
be held before a judicial officer, in
pliance with the terms of the treaty.
On their arrival at San Francisco such
a proceeding was promptly instituted
before the United States district judge,
who held that the acts constituting the
alleged offenses were political, and dis
charged all of the accused except one
Cienfuegos, who was held for an at
tempt to murder. Thereupon I was con
strained to direct his release for the rea
son that an attempt to murder was not
one of the crimes charged against him,
and upon which his surrender to the
Salvadorean authorities had been de
manded.

SPAIN'S IMPOSITION.
The unreasonable and unjust fines
imposed by Spain on the vessels and
commerce of the United States have de
manded from time to time during the
last 20 years an earnest remonstrance
on the part of our government. In the
immediate past exorbitant penalties
have been imposed upon our vessels
and goods by the customs authorities
of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical er
rors of the most trivial character in
the manifests or bills of lading. In
some cases fines amounting to thous
ands of dollars have been levied upon
the cargoes or the carrying vessels when
the goods in question were entitled to
free entry; fines have been exacted
even when error has been detected and
the Spanish authorities notified before
the arrival of the goods in port. This
conduct is in strange contrast with the
considerate and liberal treatment ex
tended to the Spanish vessels and car
goes in our ports in like cases. No sat
isfactory settlement of these vexatious
questions has been yet reached.
The Mora case, referred to in my last
annual message, remains unsettled.
From the diplomatic correspondence on
this subject, which has been laid before
the senate it will be seen that this govern
ment has offered to conclude a conven
tion with Spain for disposal by arbitra
tion of outstanding claims between the
two countries, except the Mora claim,
which, having long ago been adjusted,
now only awaits permits as stipulated,
and of course it could not be included in
the proposed convention. It was hoped
that this offer would remove the parlia
mentary obstacles encountered by the
Spanish government in providing pay
ment of the Mora Indemnity. I regret
to say that no definite reply to this offer
has yet been made and all efforts to se
cure payment of this unsettled claim
have been unavailing.
ARMENIAN TROUBLES.
in my last annual message I adverted
to the claim on the part of Turkey of
the right to expel as persons undesira
ble and dangerous, Armenians natural
ized in the United States and returning
to Turkish jurisdiction,
questions in this relation l\gve arisen.
While this government acquiesces in
the asserted right of expulsion it would
not consent that Armenians may be
imprisoned or otherwise punished for
no other reason than having acquired
Numerous
without imperial consent American citi
zenship. Three of the assailants of Miss
Molton, an American teacher in Mos
sul, have been convicted by the Otto
man courts, and I am advised that an
appeal against the acquittal of the re
maining five has been taken by the
Turkish prosecuting officer.
CONVENTION WITH VENEZUELA.
A convention has been concluded with
Venezuela for the arbitration of a long
disputed claim growing out of the seiz
ure of certain vessels, the property of
citizens of the United States. Although
signed, the treaty of extradition with
Venezuela is not yet In force, owing to
the insistence of that government that,
when surrendered, its citizens shall in
no case be liable to capital punishment.
COLLISIONS AT SEA.
The results for the prevention of colli
sions at sea, which were framed by the
maritime conference, held in this city
in 18S9, having been concurrently in
corporated in the statutes of the United
States and Great Britain, have been
announced to take effect March 1, 1895,
and invitations have been extended to
all maritime nations to adhere to them.
Favorable responses have thus far been
received from Austria, France, Portu
gal, Spain and Sweden.
SAMOA AND ITS GOVERNMENT.
Combined Military Force Necessary to
Preserve Peace.
In my last annual message. I referred
briefly to the unsatisfactory state of
affairs in Samoa under the operation
of the Berlin treaty as signally illus
trating the impolicy of entangling al
liances with foreign powers, and on
May 9, 1894, in response to a resolution
of the senate, I sent a special message
and document to that body on the same
subject, which emphasized my previous
ly expressed opinions,
renees and correspondence in regard to
them, which will be laid before con
Later occur
gress, further demonstrates that the
government which was devised by the
three powers and forced upon them
against their inveterate hostility, can
be maintained only by the continued
presence of military force and at no
small sacrifice of life and treasure. The
suppression of the Mataafa insurrec
tion by the powers and subsequent
banishment of the leader and 11 other
chiefs as recited in my last message,
did not bring lasting peace to the
islands.
Formidable uprisings con
tinued and finally a rebellion broke out
in the capital island, Upolula, headed by
Aana, in the western district by the
younger Tamasese and Inatua, in the
eastern district by other leaders. The
insurgents ravaged the country and
fought the government troops up to
the very doors of Apia. The king again
appealed to the powers for help and
the combined British and German na
val forces reduced the Atuans to ap
parent subjection, not, how;ever, with
out considerable loss to the natives.
A few days later, Tamasese and his
adherents, fearing the ships and the
marines, professed submission. The re
ports received from our agent at Apia
do not justify the belief that the peace
thus brought about will be of long du
ration. It is their conviction that the
natives are at heart hostile to the pres
ent government: that such o„f tjjem as
profess loyalty to it do so from fear of
the powers and that it would speedily
go to pieces if the warships were with
drawn.
In reporting to this government on
the unsatisfactory situation since the
suppression of the late revolt by foreign
armed forces, the German consul at
Apia stated that the idea that peace
will be lasting is hardly to be presumed.
The lesson given by the firing on the
Atua was not sufficiently sharp and
incisive to leave à lasting impression
on the forgetful Samoan temperament.
In fact conditions are existing which
show that peace will not last and is
not seriously intended. Malietoa, the
king, and his chiefs are convinced that
the departure of the warships will be a
signal for a renewal of the war. The
circumstance that the representatives
of the villages of all the districts which
were opposed to the government have
already withdrawn to Atua to hold
meetings, and that both
Aana have forbidden the inhabitants
of those districts which fought on the
side of the government to return to
their villages and have already partly
burned down the latter, indicates
that a real conciliation of the parties is
still far off. In a note of the 10th ulti
mo, enclosing a copy of that report for
the information of this government,
the German ambassador said: "The
contents of the report awakened in
the imperial government apprehension
that under the existing circumstances
the peace concluded with the rebels
will afford no assurance of a lasting
restoration of tranquillity in the isl
ands."
The present government has utterly
failed to correct, if indeed it has not
aggravated, the very evils it was in
tended to prevent. It has not stimulat
ed our commerce with the islands. Our
participation in its establishment
against the wishes of the natives was
in plain defiance of the conservative
teachings and warnings of the wise
and patriotic men who laid the foun
dations of our free institutions, and I
invite an expression of the judgment
of congress on the propriety of steps
being taken by the government look
ing to the withdrawal from its engage
ments with the other powers on some
reasonable terms, not prejudicial to any
of our existing rights.
Atua and
CONDITION OF OUR FINANCES.
Treasury Funds, Imports, Exports, Taxes
and Deficiencies
The secretary of the treasury reports
that the receipts of the government from
all sources of revenue during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1894, amounted to
$372,802,498.29, and its expenditures to
