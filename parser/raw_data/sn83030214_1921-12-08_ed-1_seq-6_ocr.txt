Dangerously Low, He Says
WASHINGTON", Dec. 7.-"Realization
of the full measure of national defense
preparations of the army awaits the
moment ?when the American people,
"throw themselves wholeheartedly into '
The ?work,'" Secretary Weeks maintains.
?r? his first annual report, made public
to-night. ;
"Plans-now initiated for preparation
? ??-,?? natiOOttl defense contemplate a
more complete state of preparedness
'han at any previous period in the
neace-time history of our country,"Mr.
Weeks says. "We have provided a
rr.mework for defense prepared after
??aireful study. We have on administra?
tive body qualified to direct and con?
trol the constructive development of
the framework. And. finally, we have
prepared the plans of development. All
of this is, however,, of alight value
until the American people, who arc the
source of material for the body of our
defensive structure, throw themselves
wholeheartedly into the work.
"To insure success they must lend
financial support to the limit of the
insurance demanded. The younsr men
of the country must train themselves
to be fitted into their places in the na- i
tional reserve. The industries must j
prepare to co-operate in war-time pro-1
duction.
"The American people have started
along this path, and they cannot afford
to turn bark.
Present Period Important
"The present period, marking a transi?
tion from the high efficiency which we
achieved during the World War at the j
cost of a great initial waste of life and
treasure as the penalty of unpreparcd
r.ess, must be characterized as one of
the most important in our history by
virtue of the duty which it imposes
upon us of insuring that the lessons
of the World War are not lost, but
that they are perpetuated in enduring i
forms of organization and continuing;
policy."
While outlining fully the extraordi- j
1?_ry steps taken by the department to !
reduce expenditures, und renewing I
pledges to keep a firm hand on the !
purse strings in all that is done, Mr. :
Weeks points out the places where, in |
his opinion, too cr??t a limitation upon
appropriations will strike down the
machinery of self-defense that has I
been devised and make lessons of the i
war vaiueles;; to generations to come.
Step by step he tells how the new
army the regulars, the National
Guard and the organized reserve?has
bec-r. brought into being. The "major
function*' of the regular army, he s?ys,
is to provide corps of trained >R
structors in order that the reserve ele?
ments ?if tho force shall not be "sub?
ject "d to the excessive dangers that
confront raw troops" if called for a
war emergency. . ,
For this purpose it was essential,
Mr. Week:? says, that the regular army
have a large surplus, of-officers to ?d ?
this training. He adds that even if ;
the regular army "is maintained at
its present dangerously low strength"
with many officers released for train-,
ing work by consolidation of units '**Efte
present commissioned strength wilt be
insufficient to fulfill the functions re?
quired by our national defense policy
when that policy attains it3 realization
through acceptance of military training
by the American people."
Army School Too Small
Declaring that at present the nation
can obtain from the Military Academy
approximately only one-third of the
requirements for the peace time or?
ganization of the army, Mr. Weeks ex?
presses the belief "that the question
of the advisability of doubling the
capacity of this institution in the near
future should be given consideration."
Asserting that there Is "no longer a
doubt" that graduates of the Reserve
Officers Training Corps machinery will
constitute the main source of supply
for reserv? officer material needed to
fill out the skeleton organization! Mr.
Weeks says the appropriations now
available for the summer training
camps for such officers limit the work
to a total of 11,085.
Paralleling the plans for mobiliza?
tion of the army in the event of war,
Mr. Weeks shows, runs a similar work
in connection with industries which is
meeting hoary co-operation among
business interests. Also there is going
forward a study of all mechanical and'
other developments in order that there
?halt be no "lagging in the technique
of war behind the technique of peace?
ful industry." Pilot types of new
equipment, "from the Infantry hand
grenade to the heaviest gun of the
artillery," the report says, are being
produced, and as they are fully tested
and approved will gradually supplant
existing standard types both with the
troops and in the scheme of quantity
production ih war that underlies the
department's efforts.
Similar studies in the poison gas and
chemical warfare matters generally are
in progresa, Mr. Weeks says.
In dealing with the air developments
of warfare Mr. Weeks says:
"We are already much behind the
tpaci?3rs in such development, and there
it thus in our present project for na

WASHINGTON', Dec. 7. -President
Harding transmitted to Congress to?
day the annual report of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, !
"I think there can be no doubt," the |
President said, in a message which ao
companied the report, "that the do- j

first and most important of which is
that a bureau be established in the
Department of Commerce for the reg?

A bill to create such a bureau is nowi
pending before the House Commerce

The report, which supplemented one
made last April to the President,
recommended continuation of the air

such payments and to pay o?T the i
mortgage lien.?.
Plan for Ke-Leaaing
Until the completion of the pay-1
ment?? by the city, and as additional j
security therefor, Mr. William.-', sug?
gested that the properties be leased
back by the city to a corporation named
by tho sellers, upon the following
terms:
"The lessee to operate the proper?
ties, subject to the supervision of a
board of control, and after paying
operating expenses (including taxes
and rents, if any), interest and amor?
tization on existing mortgage liens,
and providing suitable reserves, to pay
over the balance of income to the city.
"All funds required for addition?,
improvement und extensions (capital
expenditure.-1 to be furnished by the
city.
"Rates of fare to be fixed by the
board of control, but not to be less
than sufficient to permit the lessees to j
make the deductions from revenue
authorized in paragraph above and
so far as practicable and reasonable
to be uniform throughout the city.
"The board of control to consist of
three persons, one appointed by the
Mayor, one by the lessee companies
and" one by the Governor, and to have
general supervisory and regulative
power., including that of audit and ac?
counts."
In support of his idea, Mr. Williams
maid:
"The plan which I have suggested
would, more than the - commission's
plan, eliminate politics from the trans?
portation problem. 1'tie city and the
operators would have a common aim.
Hostility, lack of co-operation, public ;
prejudice and suspicion would have no
justification. The receivership, or near-,
receivership, of the companies would :
fscilitate such an arrangement.
End Transit Speculation
"I can. see no insuperable obstacle
to carrying it out, providing the valua?
tion of the properties is fair and ample
safeguards surround its payment. All
speculation in traction securities would
cease. The various companies would
take from the lessee company repre?
senting them the interest and amorti?
zation paid on any existing bonds and
pay it over to the bondholders or their
representatives. They would likewise
receive from the city the payments to
be made it and apply them in liquida?
tion of the remaining equity. When
all should be done they would quietly
pass out of existence."
George McAneny, chairman of the
commisaion, said the criticism of Mr.
Williams was the most constructive
that had been made thus far, but he
and Mr. Shearn contended his plan did
not- possess the merit of that of the.
commission. Both aides went into an
exhaustive interchange of views re?
garding the commission's plan and that
suggested by Mr. Williams.
Mr. Shearn declared no reliance could
bo placed upon the co-operation of the
city government, which he said already
had requested $100,000 to fight "any
plan" the commission proposed.
"It won't lift a hand," continued Mr.
Shearn. with a show of heat. "It won't
do anything but throw wrenches into
the machinery. So what's the use of
talking about being able to pool it
through co-operation of the city,"
"If you take that attitude publicly,"
smiled Mr. Williams, "I am not sur?
prised the city opposes the plan."
"I think," Chairman McAneny inter?
posed, "that Judge Shearn referred to
the disposition of particular gentlemen
now in ofnu??, not to the right or power
of the city government to share in tho
use of this plan. The plan inviten the
closest co-operation of the city govern?
ment at every turn, and so far as we
are concerned we propone to antat into
that co-operation whenever wo ca3i
properly do so."
"When 1 speak of tho city." explained
Mr. Shearn, "I am referring, of course,
to the city as administered and as it
is going to lie administered for some
years to come-! That has to be taken
into account."
Mr. Shearn informed Mr. Williams
that the matter of tvunsferi'ing the
lines directly to the city and taking the
leases hack was debated by the commis?
sion for week:--.
"There are two reasons why the
mechanism that we propos?? differs
from that which you propose," Mr.
Shearn went On. "One, that opposition
to having anything constructive ?lone
might, have wrecked the plan. Second,
a very serious doubt about the legal
phase of the question involved in tho
loan of the city'? credit."
"If the latter obstacle can bo uuc
cessfully overcome and it were pre?
ferred on the part of the city to have
those properties loaded directly to it
1 think I could say at once that we
would be glad to take that view. But
we have to face actualities and exist?
ing conditions, and we are bound t?>
relieve, the situation, and, above all
thingi--, must succeed without increased
fares.'*
"All I want to do is to help you to
the extent of my ability," assured Mr.
Williams, but. he persisted in his criti?
cism of the board of control.
Immunity Waiver Signed
When-Mr. Williams first was calle?!
to the stand he was asked if he had any
hesitancy in signing u waiver of im?
munity.
''Not, the slightest," ho answered.
Mr.' Shearn said fie wished to nial-e
clear that, there was no implication
against the B. It. T. directors in asking
this formal requirement.
Questioning the witness regarding
the 1017 dividends, Mr. Shearn asked if
the main purpose of their declaration
was to create a favorable market for
all B. R. T. securities.
"I think it was a minor considera?
tion," replied Mr. Williams.
"You had in mind then that some
Ciw.OOO.OOO worth of your notes were
Coi, i ;<?? to maturity in July, 1918?"
"Ye_, we understood that."
"And it*, was vitally necessary to
finance those notes either by an issue
of bonds or by a new loan'"'
"We assumed by that time that the
bonds would hav-*- been salable and
that the city's part of the construction
of the dual system contracts would have
been so far advanced that the earning
capacity of the bonds would have been
demonstrated."
Mr. Williams declared that dividend
payments always had been made on the
strength of an apparent surplus. Mr.
Shearn agreed that this was so in con?
nection with the B. R. T., but that it
was not true with the subsidiary com?
panies.
Dividend Action Upheld
Asked if he did not consider the dec?
laration of the dividends a mistake in
view of what he knew conditions to be
at the time they were declared, the
witness said definitely:
"On the strength of the information
we then had at hand 1 would not have
changed my attitude in the slightest."
Turning to back pages in the history
of the company, Mr. Williams suid ih;U
the refunding mortgage of lOO!!, which
amounted to $150,000,000, had been
crcrated under the advice of a group of
railroad authorities, including E. H.
Harri man.
"Mr. Harriman," he said, "used to
pride himself on financing the railroads
with which he va? connected with
bond? bearing a low rate of interest.''
Mr. Williams admitted, however, that
a mistake had been made in limiting
to 4 p-sr cent the interest rates on the
refunding mortgage of 1902.
Justifying the company's borrowina
of $4,000,000 in 1917. Mr. William:;
said:
:'l don't know of any railroad com?
pany, unless it is particularly rich, that
carries a sufficient working ca?ital to
take care of all its demands. They are
constantly borrowing, and some times
they borrow in ordsr to furnish the
money with which to pay dividends:
not because, the dividend?, have not
been earned, but because the money
representing the dividends has been in?
vested in some other way."
Mr. Williams seid it was his opinier
a bad impression would have been cre?
ated by the company if it had carried
an accumulating surolus of fron
i 85,000,000 to $fi,000,000 a year on the
?books without distributing'dividends.
! "It is a dangerous thing," he wenl
on, "for a street railway company tr.
accumulate any surplus that is 'get-at
able' by public taxation or by public
restriction of one kind or another. Ii
has seemed to me in late years that
the only safe surplus of street railwnj
companies &x a general proposition is
what is in the pockets of the stock?
holders."
Referring to a chart which shower
thut B. R. T. stock rose from 38 ?t

if they were trading in B, R. T. stock.;
Mr. Williams said he had bought j
stock whenever it was low, adding:
"But unfortunately I did not sell

He followed up with a firm Statement \
that the directora never had declared i
a dividend for its effect, upon the mar- j
ket price of the securities.
In taking up the affairs oi" the New

operates the B. lt. T. subway and ele?

1917 and ?918 the surplus had been?
pared down from $3,366.000 to $2,074,- !

Payment Called Coincidence
Mr. Williams explained that the com?
pany had been earning surpluses for
some years and not distributing them
in dividends until they periodically
reached about $4.000,000.
In declaring that the last dividend
paid by the New York" Consolidated
was coincident with the appointment'
o:' a receiver December 31, 1958, Mr.
Williams said the date payable had
been fixed in September, when the com- |
pany had no idea of a receivership;
Mr. Williams presented a detailed
statement of the capitalization of the
