The Penal Code Effort to Enforce the
Sunday Law in Uew York and Brook
lyn.
New York, Dec. 3. Some scores of men
and boys were arrested in thia city to-day for
alleged violations of the Sunday clauses of
the new penal code, but no serious disturb
ance was reported. The attempt to enforce
the law was little better than a broad farce,
and in its enactment the weak, poor and
those without influence were the victims,
while no serious attempt was made to inter
fere with the avooations of persons in a po
sition to maintain their rights. A police or
der was issued to close telegraph and tele
phone offices, but these corporations showed
fight and the order was rescinded. The same
result ended the attempt to stop the running
of street cars, elevated trains and ferry
boats. Bootblacks, newsboys, ragpickers,
proprietors of apple stands and cigar stores
and other small dealers were the only victims
of the police wrath. The officers seemed to
be at sea as to the precise nature of their du
ties, and numerous arrests were made which
certainly were not contemplated by the penal
code. There was also an absence of unity of
action among the police magistrates who dis
posed of the prisoners, some justices hold
ing that shaving, selling newspapers, black
ing boots and disposing of milk, bread and
other edibles were matters of necessity,
while in other courts the exact . reverse was
held. Business was livelier than usual in the
liquor saloons, and no serious attempt was
made to close them. The increased trade
was accounted for by ths fact that men who
usually bought cigars from tobacconists were
forced to patronize the saloons for the pur
chase of smoking material.
About a hundred persons were arrested and all dis
charged except cigar dealers and clothiers, who were
held in nominal bail. Several of the German concert
halls had concerts for charitable purposes and thus
escaped arrest. Harry Hill and the manager of the
Atlantic Garden were not so fortunate and were held
to appear before a magistrate to-morrow. The city
was quiet up to midnight. Not a single aot of vio
lence was reported to the police. In the Germania
Theatre Hermann Linde gave a recitation for the ben
efit of the sufferers by the recent floods in Germany
and was not disturbed. In Central Park the men
agerie was cloBod and no vehicles of any description
except private conveyances were permitted to enter.
On the road a small number of vehicles were out, and
quite a'nuinber of sleighing parties among them. The
tiabbath vigilant committee were active from early
morning, but were not obliged to intrude their per
sonality in many cases.
Bbooklyn, Dec. 3. The Sunday provisions of the
new code were generally observed in this city. All
saloon keepers, owners of barbershops and other
places that have been generally kept open on the first
day of the week were notified on Saturday night tbat
they must remain closed or take the risk of arrest.
So generally was this warning heeded that but three
arrests of storekeepers were reported during the day
at police headquarters. Eight Italian ragpickers
were utaken up" for searching barrels in the street.
The police stopped the newsboys from calling in the
street', but did not interfere with those delivering at
the residences of customers.

Train Robbers Foiled A Desperate
tempt by the Kreebooterd.
Dai-las, Dec. 3. When tlae north bound express on
the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe road stopped for
water at Blum station early Saturday morning a dar
ing but unsuccessful effort was made by a large gang
of desperadoes to rob the train. Three men boarded
the engine, presented revolvers at the engineer and
compelled him to pull out. After running two or
three miles a torpedo which had been placed on the
track exploded as a signal to a half dozen
confederates who emerged from the brush and
attacked he train. The railroad officers had
been expecting such an attempt for weeks
and had made preparations to meet it. The guard
stationed in the express car opened Are on the rob
bers with telling eflect. Xae nre was returned ana
about seventy-live shots were exchanged. In the
meantime the men on the engine having gone to the
assistance of the others the engineer threw the throt
tle wide open and the train flew northward, leaving
tbe would-be robbers in the lurch. rJo one oh the
train was injured, but it is believed several of the
robbers were killed of wounded. There is an uncon
firmed report that two of the bandits have been cap
tured.

A Desperado's EndRiddled With Bul
lets From a. n Officers Posse.
Chicago, Dec. 3. The usual Sunday quiet in this
city was rudely disturbed this afternoon by the re
port of the tragic arrest and shooting of the notorious
Bill Allen, the Republican desperado, who murdered
Officer Clarence E. Wright on last Wednesday night
while resisting his arreBt and made his escape. The
entire police force of the city has been searching fov
the murderer ever Bince and several arrests were
made in this and neighboring cities, but Allen suc
ceeded in concealing himself until this afternoon,
when he went to the bouse of a friend in the heart of
the city and demanded food. A little girl recognized
him and informed the police, who surrounded the
house. Allen finding himself in a trap fought like a
wild beast at bay, emptying his revolvers on the offi
cers and dangerously wounding Policeman Melville
in the head. The police returned the fire and Allen
was riddled with aillets,receiving six mortal wounds.
The news of his death caused much excitement.
The news of the tragic death of the negro who has
braved the entire police force of the city for months
past spread like wildfire. A mob of thousands of
people from all parts of the city assembled at the
place of the shooting and under the impression that
Allen was only wounded made a concerted attempt to
seize the dying man and lynch him. Over one hun
dred policemen were called to protect him from fur
ther violence and convey him to the station. The
police were compelled to awe the mob with drawn re
volvers before it would give way. The crowd steadi
ly increased, aud although the murderer died before
he reached the station, it was found necessary to sat
isfy the mob by exhibiting his body bleeding fram a
dozen wounds through the grated windows. The
ghastly sight was viewed until late at night by thou
sands of morbid sightseers. It is thought that the
wounded officer may recover.

ing of certain contract bonds, but denies
ever having certiHed auch bonds where the Star
route defendants were interested or having impeded
the trial in any way. He also admits expressing views
derogatory to McaVeagh andJames and says he did so
because he had received injury at their hands and
has no apology to make therefor. He concludes by
saying that a man may be ruined by his own acts, but
not by the act of another even it that other be an
Attorney General or a President.
The Post will to-morrow publish an r tervlew with
Secretary Blaine in whioh he opposes the proposition
to appropriate $75,000,600 for an iater-oceanio canal
in Nicaragua, as set forth in Kasson's report, and the
bill regarding it as an extraordinary proposition for
this government to expend that amount of money In
a country where we have no control, and while under
the terms of the Olayton-Bnlwer treaty we cannot
fortify the canal when built In any manner whatso
ever. He is of opinion that the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty is still in foroe and to terminate it would work
to the disadvantage of the United States.
It is reported here that a bill to relieve Chester A.
Arthur, former collector of the port of New York, of
a government claim of $5,000 against him caused by a
defalcation by one of his subordinates during his ad

X)nahed through Congress by the friends of the Presi
dent at the coming suasion.
The claims allowed.by the Garfield board of audit
have been reported. For professional services the
physicians are allowed $27,50D,of which Dr. Bliss gets
$fi,500, Dr. Agnew $5,000, Dr. Hamilton $5,000, Dr.
Keyburn $4,000, Dr. Boynton $1,000 and Dr. Susan A.
Edson $3,000. For services and supplies the allow
ances foot up $5,929.93, and for extra services by
government employes $3,440. The grand total is $38,
Ht0.93. The total appropriation to pay claims against
the Gurlield estate was $57,500, of which amonnt $35,
5'J0 was specially appropriated for i hyaicians
and medical attendance. It will be seen
that the allowances for the phy
sicians, &c, are $8,000 leBS than the amount appro
priated aud that the allowances for outside claims are
about $11,000 less than the amount available, making
a total balance of nearly $19,000 out of the entire ap
propriation of $57,500.

Sentenced to Daath The Penalty of
Arabl'i Jteb el lion Ills 'gvatnnce Com
muted to Exile.
Caiiio, Dec. 3. On Saturday last Lord Dufferin at
a meeting with Cherif and Riaz Pasha and Arabi'fl
counsel informed the Egyptian ministers that the
process submitted to him of the f case against Arabl
completely failed to support the charges of incendia
rism and pillage and that the English government de
sired that he should be given an immediate trial on
the charge of rebellion only, Reouf Pasha presiding.
The counsel for the prosecution refused to appear on
the ground that the trial would be a farce. The en
tire proceedings occupied but a few minutes. Arabi's
counsel read his plea of guilty to -the charge of rebel
lion and the court then adjourned. It reassembled this
afternoon, when sentence of death was pssaed upon
the rebel leader. This Judgment was immediately
commuted by the Khedive to exile. Arabi Pasha and
the other leaders of the revolt will be permitted to
choose a suitable retreat within the British empire.
