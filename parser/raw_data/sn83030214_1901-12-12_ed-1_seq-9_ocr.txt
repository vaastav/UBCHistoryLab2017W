MUSIC.
SON"S RECITAL^.
Tbers are two phenomena in the musical activi
ties of the musical season just opened which are
worthy of record because of the widely different
tendencies which they Illustrate. Two singers who
have mads their mark in opera, Mm<?. Lillian Nor
dic* and Mme. Emma Nevada, are "on tour," giv
ing concerts In many an out of the -way town
which heretofore has never enjoyed the thrill of
tearing a singer of world-wide repute. They are
•'•barnstorming," and so widespread is the feeling
of prosperity In the country that financial success
it following their footsteps, and enterprises which
would have been considered extremely venturesome
experiments have proved to be business triumphs.
There Is a large difference in the style of their
entertainments, however. Mme. Nevada, with an
operatic repertory belonging- hopelessly to the past,
is giving operatic concerts of the old fashioned or
der. A flautist, violoncellist and pianist are with

• her; they play pretty bits and she sings operatic
airs. The larger cities used to enjoy concerts of
this character, and the Brooklyn Institute occa
sionally manifest* a desire to restore them, but
they have been relegated, practically, to the coun
try districts of the provinces. Mme. Nordica. on
the contrary, is carrying the dominant phase of
metropolitan concert room activity into cities and
trwns alike. She is a survivor of the old operatic
regime, but also an ornament of the new, and she
give* song recitals The recital as a form of mu
sical entertainment has much to commend It. In
any of its forms, as sonar, pianoforte or violin re
cital. It Is admirably determinative of the artistic
status ci the performer. A poor singer or player
may be endured as one of several factors in a con
cert, but is intolerable in a recital. So recitals are
a blessing. They can be given more cheaply than
oid fashioned concerts, and may therefore tempo
rarily increase the number of entertainments call
ing for attention (not always discussion) on the
part of the- reviewer of the press, but their in
fluence Is purgative and reformatory.
Recitals have stolen into musical life so insidi
ously that it will surprise many to learn that com
paratively a few years ago they were all but un-
! known. Mr. William Mason, in his book of mu
sical memories, claims to have been the first pianist
•who ever undertook a recital tour in America.
That was nearly fifty years ago. Gottschalk had
; travelled ■*«*£ the country giving concerts, but
always had with him a. singer or associate of some
kind. But what Mr. Mason did forty-six or forty
seven years ago was so far from being the rule in
>.>w-York fifteen years ago that nearly all the
concerts given by pianists contained vocal or
.violin music as well. The recitals recorded in "The
;Revlew of the New- York Musical Season, 1535-*SS.~
are nearly all organ recital. non-portable and free.
There Is cot a single record of a song recital in
■ th« book. Now the miscellaneous concert is the
exception arid the recital the rule. And it is well,
for it has whetted appreciation for a higher order
of song literature than was cultivated fifteen years
•go.
The home of the song recital Is Mendelssohn Hall.
There Mr. Heinrica Meyn disclosed his talents on
Monday afternoon and Mr. Francis Rogers on
•Tuesday, and there Mr. George Hamlln will lntro
tjtsee a new phase of the form this afternoon, sing
ing songs by ore composer exclusively. New-York
made the acquaintance of Mr. Rogers In December,
iSSS. His habitat, we believe, is Boston. That he
was the possessor of a high barytone voice of fine
quality, also of good taste. Intelligence, dignified
purpose and sincere feeling, his recital two years
«go demonstrated. All these admirable qualities
were again brought to notice on Tuesday, and also
the gratifying proofs that some technical slack
which then adhered to the fine metal of his art
had been put aside. Mr. Rogers does not rise to
great height in his singing, but never for a mo
ment is he vulgar or commonplace. He reads his
texts painstakingly and intelligently In all lan
guages, and his enunciation is delightful. His pro
gramme was not hackneyed, and he gratified the
lovers cf Dvorak by singing the entire set of gypsy
songs from which that prime favorite, "Als die
JUte Mutter," is taken.
Mr. George Hamlin, who Is to give a recital of
Btratiss songs this afternoon, is an American
singer, born, brought up and educated in the
TiJted States. He is best known in the West, but
ie has sung in New-Yorrk. Boston. New-Haven.
Providence, Worcester and other Eastern cities.
Eli interest in the song compositions of Richard
fcraoss was awakened by Mme. Teresa Carrefio
*I»ut five years ago. The eminent pianist is a de
wed admirer of the songs. She played them for
Jtr. Hamlin In private, and offered to play the
accompaniments for him in public if he would give
Staass recitals in Germany— a proceeding which

Song recitals are as yet an aristocratic form of
entertainment, but Mr. David Bispham seems de

NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 12. 1901.
-THE PAPERS DID IT. V — (Richard Croker.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.
"THE RILE OF BROTHERHOOD."
To the Editor of The Tribune.
Sir: A sentence in President Roosevelt's Message
confirms an Impression that has been growing in
my mind during the last few months, that the year
'T»"i will hereafter be regarded as a pivotal year in
American history— the beginning of a distinctly
new era in its social, industrial and political life.
He says: "The rule of Brotherhood remains as the
indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of
national life for which we must strive."
The President here sums up, in his terse and
forceful way, the principle which has been gradu
ally evolving and taking shape since Lincoln DW
of this year. On that day. in an address before the
Massachusetts Legislature, Senator George F. Hoar
expressed his conviction that the Golden Rule la
the only basis for a stable and permanent civiliza
tion. Acting upon this suggestion, the managers
of the Baron and Baroness de Hirsch Monument
Association, which was formed for the purpose of
honoring the spirit of the. Golden Rule as exem
plified by those two philanthropists, called a meet
ing for discussing the precept. It was held In Cal
vary Baptist Church (the Rev. R. 9. MacArthui-s),
and the Golden Rule was discussed by a Confucian
(the Hon. Wu-Tlng-fang), by two Jewish rabbis and
by Christians of different shades of faith. Two
practical steps were unanimously agreed upon by
the vast audience there assembled — (1) to organize
a permanent Golden Rule Brotherhood (which was
done a fen- weeks later) and (2) to recommend an
annual Golden Rule Day. not only in America but
throuphout the- world. Thia Idea was formally
promulgated from a mn—anlnMwi meeting held In
connection with the Pan-American Exposition at
Buffalo. It was also empl>as<lz»-d by the remarkable
Golden Rule spirit mantftsttd by Pr*s'.<>nt Me-
Kin'.py. who. as state.l in Mr. BooasvelfS rr. -- (i
"even In mortal agor.y utterej n<> wordo mv» of
forgiveness for his murderer, of loie for hl3 friends
and of unfaltering trust for the will of the Most
High."
If all earnest citizens of our republic will em
phasize the "Ruse> of Brotherhood" as President
Roosevelt has done. It can scarcely be doubted that
our nation will as truly bo reborn morally and
spiritually in 1901 as it was bom politically In 1776.

New- York. Dec. 5, 1301.
A PROTEST FROM ORANGE.
To the Editor of The Tribune.
Sir: Some of us who are interested in securing
civilized conditions in this community In the mat
ter of the treatment of contagious diseases read
in this morning's Tribune with a feeling of disap
pointment and exasperation, the caption which you
put over the cut of the Orange Smallpox Hospital.
Just erected, "The Orange Pest House." Why
should a paper of the calibre and prestige of The
Tribune cater to the ignorance and misinformation
of the public? The institution tne cut of which
you give is a comfortable, well equipped and
sanitary hospital. It is small, to bo sure, and a
portable building, but it is thoroughly equipped In
every way. A trained nurse is in residence, also
a capable physician who has had many years' ex
perience in the treatment of smallpox and other
contagious discuses. There is telephone connection
and electric lighting. It Is distinctly not a "pest
bouse," and the Board of Health has decided that
it shall not be one. in any sense.
The Tribune can help the cause of clear thinking
and sanity by repudiating the term "pest house"
altogether. There is no more necessity for the
modern community erecting a. "pest house" for the
treatment of contagious diseases than there is for
it to erect a "mad house" for taking care of the
Insane. Both are relics of the Middle Ages.
A. W. M' DOUG ALL.
Orange. N. J.. Dec. 10, 1901.
Common usape sanctions the expression "pest
house" for a hospital for contagious diseases, and
The Tribune had no intention of exasperating the
public spirited citizens who are peeking to serve
the Oranges.
DR. JOSEPH PULLMAN DYING.
HIS PHYSICIANS FEAR HE WILL. NOT RALLY—
OPERATION WOfLD NOT SAVE HIM.
[BY TKLEGRAm TO TUX TUBCKX.]
Stamford. Conn., Dec. 11.— The condition of the
Rev. Dr. Joseph Pullman, presiding elder of the
Methodist Church in this district, has become very
critical. Since Monday evening he has sunk rapidly,
and his physicians have fears that he will not be
able to rally. He is now unable to leave his be.l.
The administration of soothing medicines is neces
sary to allay the great pain which the presiding
elder suffers. Since he- returned from Scney Hos
pital. Brooklyn, on October 19. no hope has been
entertained that Dr. Pullman would recover. His
ailment coulfl not be eradicated by an operation,
and it was realized It must sooner or later overcome
his vitality.
On Monday evening of this week he was sud
denly taken worse. His son-in-law. Dr. Lauder,
of Bridgeport, and Dr. Pierson have been in almost
constant attendance on him since that time. When
the midyear assembly of the New- York East Con
ference was in session Dr. Pullman sent to that
body a letter in which he spoke of his illness. The
following is an extract:
Brethren: 1 am not rebellious; I am thankful for
thirty-eight years In the ministry and forty-iiva
years as a lover of Jesus Christ-nay. I have alvajs

be able to attend to the duties of secretary after
he entered upon his work as Corporation Counsel.
He presented his resignation to take effect upon
the appointment of his successor. Nothing was
done looking toward the selection of a successor,
but there was a little season of complimentary
speeches laudatory of Mr. Rivess character and
services. Mr. Cadwalader made a sp«ecb in this
DM which received hearty applause, a thing almost
unheard of at the meetings of the board. Buth Mr.
Cadwalader and Mr. Rives have held tlw position
of Assistant Secretary of State of the L'nlted
States. Mr. Rives was formerly a member of the
board of trutees of the old Astor Library, but he
resigned that position while he was Assistant Sec
retary of State during Mr. Cleveland's first ad
ministration. After that he was chosen a member
of the board of trustees of the Lenox Library.
Once the consolidation he has been a member of
the board and the secretary of the New-York Pub

The resignation of Daniel Huntington was re
ceived. Mr. Huntington is the only surviving mem

THE PASSING THRONG.
"In the last twenty-five years," said G. B. Law
rence, of Philadelphia, at the Holland House yes
terday, "the wealth of this coun-
INCREASE try has increased by leaps and
OF PUBLIC bounds. This wealth is collective
AND PRIVATE in that the country at large has
WEALTH. Increased In fortune during this
period, and it is also individual, as
Is shown by the vast increase in the number and
size of the private fortunes. In ISSO Plttsburg. while
already a great money making centre and having
a fair proportion of moneyed men among its in
habitants, did not then, nor even ten years later,
give indication of what was to occur. The great
increase In the coal. iron and steel trades and
various" other industries, that found their centre
In this smoky city of Western Pennsylvania, has
made of Pittsburc. in proportion to Its
sire, the wealthiest place upon the American
continent, which is equivalent to the truth
which I« that it Is the richest place of Us
size in the world. The growth of fortunes there
has been of the order of marvellous, and the truth
ful s tolies° of their erection and the 'time consumed
therein read like the romances of the Baron Mun
Cl^n memory of men living ta 'Scotland there
lived a 'puir laddie- who. with his family. <f m '£ ra'

to become the greatest Industrial monarchy wor a
business made Mr. Carnegie Wkal he «M and is.
"The time, however, is past when his career could
be repeated, certainly In an established line of busi

BE ANOTHER an equal success in a new line, but
CARNEGIE? in the old established ones compe
tition is too keen and the present
day methods too vigorous and well denned for
business careers like those of Thomas A. Scott in
railroading and Andrew Carnegie in steel to be
duplicated. It took long "ears for England to con
sider seriously America as a competitor In steel.
even after our country had made gigantic progress
In the manufacture of the metal. England looked
upon steel as peculiarly her own bond servant, and
never feared but that her surplus product would
always find ready and eager purchasers when aught
of It was for sale. That America would seri
ously compete England never really believed . that
American steel would ever drive tha ' of England
out in competitive trade England is still loath to
believe, and yet the first has already come to pass
and the second seems in a fair way to happel}
"lndeed. England seems for many years to have
remained In wilful, almost criminal( Ignorance of
the progress America was making . in steel ana
other industries. When Mr. Carnegie, in > ' 1 *» n 8
freedom from business cares, first began his pr«e«
annual habit of a European vacation, he "^}™
England as a stranger in a strange land To-daj,
his name is as much a household word In the
British Islands as it Is in the United states. But
twenty and odd years ago this was not ..and
Mr. Carnegie landed in 'Lunnon town as a well-to
do but unheralded and comparatively unimportant
citizen. Like gravitates .to like, and so in the
aural course of events he fell in and roregath
ered with the steel men of Albion Even at that
time a distant rumor had reached pig.and that
Mr Carnegie was an iron founder of importance in
\mprica but of how great importance our Bttfflfeh
cousins knew not. md as the event proved wofully
underestimated. In order to show the visiting
American how the steel business was conducted on
the other side and also, it is to befMKdjln the
spirit that was colored with boastful pride. Mr.
Carnegie was one day conducted through the great
est of the English steel plants.
•The journey was a long and painstaking one.
The visitor was ably clceroned. and no detail of
the business was neglected. From
STEEL PLANTS end to end of the vast plant the
COMPARED BY party travelled, and each and all
AN EXPERT. of the wonderful mills and every
piece of the intricate machinery
therein employed came in for its full share of at
tention. When the Inspection was finally completed
•he Englishmen glowed with the feeling that they
had shown the American how useless must prove
any puny effort? of his when made in competition
uith the titanic endeavors of which they had shown
him they were capable. Mixed with their »«»faC
tlon was just a tinge of disappointment that Mr
Carnegie had not been more visibly impressed^ and
when he thanked them for their trouble and praUed
th° Plant but naught else, this filing found voice.
• 'You don't.' complained the spokesman to tne
American, seem much impressed. Now. be honest;
"have you ever seen a plant as great and complete
*"» 'Ye- I have ' was the quiet reply, 'a number,
and what is more. I personally own one that Is
fully four times as large and far more complete
"ThN 'abounding statement was received with a
cool Incredulity that In some of the party became
oren derision. For all tha:, the statement upon in
vestigation was found to he literally true. That
happened many years ago. and since that day the
«teel industry in this country in general and the
("arnegle end of it in particular has been steadily
Increasing In size."
