ions a better Idea of the spirit of the con
flict than tnany dry reports or careful' nar
ratives of events; and. this part may be
called the gossip; the fun, the pathos of the
war. This illustrates ine characters or th
leaders, the humor of the soldiers, jtbet de
votion of women, the bravery of men. the
