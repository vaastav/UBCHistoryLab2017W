Wabiunoton, Deo. 1. Thoro were
many attractive Thanksgiving sermons
delivered In Washington Thursday,
but tho one which fell from the lips of
Bishop Hurst, of tho Mothodist Episco
pal ohurch, so woU known and beloved
in Cincinnati, attracted tho greatest
attention. Bishop Hurst preached at
the Foundry Methodist Episcopal
church, which is but two squares dis
tant from tho whito house, and ho
talked straight from tho shoulder
against the pro-Chinese policy of tho
government He took as his text this
olauso f rom Jcromiah xvili, 7-10: "Every
nation is the arbiter of its own destin
ies." Ho scored tho government se
verely for Its anti-Chinese policy, and
warned the pcoplo that a oruol govern
ment, as well as a person or people,
would fall.
Among other ultra sentiments ut
tered by the great Methodist Bishop
were these:
"We have never committed a crime
as a people for which we have not had
to make full payment, and tho Chinese
government has just as complete a
right to exclude Amorican missionaries
from landing as we havo to keep the
unincse iroin our country. Tho Amer
ican missionary oxpects to send his
savings back to America for invest
ment He expects to return to
America as his final home. He
does not adopt the Chinese costume.
He never becomes u citizen of China.
He is an alien, wherever ho lives, and
remains such until he leaves or dies. If
the Chinaman in this country retains
his native costume, sends his savings
back to China, and never becomes a
citizen, and obeys the laws as well as
the avcrago citizens, he onlv daces
himself 'on a par with the American
in China. Yet the Chinese government
treats tho American missionaries with
justice and respect, and has' never
passed an exclusion law, or one requir-
Ing them to produce letters of identity
or exiums meir pnotograptts.
lhero is ono respect, however, in
which the parallell is broken. When
... ummB.i tuium iicre iie hibiccs no
war upon tne unrlstlanity of tho
United States, but when the Amer.
lean missionary goes to China ha
wages a bitter and unrelenting
war upon the national .faith of the
land that has been followed since the
days of Confucius. Loud indeed would
be the wail In our congress If five hun
dred Chinamen should be going up and
do,wn this city haranguing people at
street corners and building chapels and
schools, and carrying on a ceaseless
propaganda against tho faith we love
so dearly. But we do not hear that
the Chinese government has yet noted
a prohibition against the Christian
missionaries who have never ceased
their evangelistic campaign. Let us be
careful to stop this great iniquity, and
escape the danger of God's avenging
justice."
THE ADMINISTRATION
Will Not Forco tho Tollcy of Restoring
tho Queen to tho Throne.
Washington, Dec. 1. At last Sec
retary Gresham has consented to tako
tho public into his confidence enough
to announce that the administration
has precedent for its remarkable course
in Hawaii,
Secretary Gresham told an official
friend that when President Harrison
entered into tho arrangement with the
governments of Germany and England i
"for the forcible enthronement of an
objectionable king, Malieotoa Laupcna
in 1889, and brought about the depos
ing of King Mattiafa, he established a
precedent which has been taken up by
this administration for the re-enthronement
of Queen LiliuokalanL"
Secretary Gresham has a lot of cop
ies of President Hudson s proclamation
of May 31, 1890, upon "neutrality
toward the autonomous government of
the Sainoan islands," and places it in
tho hands of every out-of-town friend I
who calls for ono of these copies.
But what is most significant is tho
remark made by tho secretary of state
to the friend to whom he sent tho
above, that he did not tnink the admin
istration would force the policy of
restoring tho queen to her throne. Ho
thought the efforts already made were
sutljcient to show good intentions.
nnd
that nothing further would be done
just at present. This is taken as mean
ing that the administration has yielded
to public opinion, and will let things
take their own course on tho islands.

CANADA'S TARDJP.
it
Will Follow Redactions as Wo Slaks
Them.
Piotou, N. a, Dec. 2. Sir John
Thompson and Sir Charles H. Tupper
addressed a great political demonstra
tion here. Tho premier said that the
Canadian government was for genuine
tariff reform.
Referring to tho tariff bill submitted
to congress by tho democratic commit
tee, tho premier dwelt on the fact that
Instead of being in tho direction of free
trade tho democrats were clinging with
might and main to tho protective pol
icy, and that tho duties under their
proposed tariff reform were much high
er than the duties now levied by Can
ada under its protective system.
He did not believe that there would
be any reciprocity treaty between the
two countries. "Still," continued the
premier, "for every step the United
States congress takes In reducing or
abolishing duties on Canadian products
wo will take
a corresponding step in
reducing or abolishing our tariff at
American ports so far as tho require
mouta of our revenue will make it pos
slblo without sacrificing our commer
cial independence or our attachment to
the mother country."
SENDING IT AWAY.
The Whisky Men Exporting Their Goods,
to Be Brought Back at tho Ninety-Cent
Rate.
Washington, Dec. 3. Treasury de
partment figures show that in anticipa
tion of possible increase in the internal
revenuo tax on distilled spirits, consid
erable quantities of spirits are being
taken out of bonded warehouses and
being exported, and large quantities of
newly distilled whisky are being
placed in bonded warehouses, to bo re
deemed hereafter at the present rate of
tax of 90 cents a gallon.
The whisky being taken out of bond
is that which has been in the ware
house for nearly three years, at the ex
piration of which time tho tax has to
be paid. If exported, even though it
should be sent no further than Bermu
da it can bo imported at the pleasure of
tho holder at any time on payment of a
corresponding duty to the tax at the
time of its departure, namely 90 cents
per gallon.

ARm? BILL DELAY.
Sugar, Whisky and the Inoomo Are)
the Causos.
Dlitlllera Wnnt tin Unlimited Ilonded Pe
riod Thin Would Defcnt the Adminis
tration'! Purpose Sugar Schedule
nnd Wlilnky Tux Are Tied Dp.
Washington! Dec. 4. Sugar, whisky
nnd the incomo tax are tho sources of
tho dolay In completing tho portion of
the tariff bill which is to raise revenue.
Tho contradictory reports on tho sub
jects of tho whisky tax and tho incomo
tax are Bimply tho results of the con
stant changes of plan by tho committee
Itself. Secretary Carlislo Sunday In
formed tho majority members who
visited him, that ho had delayed final
revision nnd completion of his report, in
the hopo that somo decisive action
would bo taken by tho committee, but
that, in view of its failure to reach
any conclusion, ho was now compelled
to submit his report without any dis
cussion of the relief that would bo af
forded tho treasury from taxation of
whisky. Tho difficulty that now con
fronts Mr. Carlisle, as well as the ma
jority of the members of tho commit
tee, in dealing with the whisky tax is,
that tho distillers, while content
with only an incrcaso of ten
cents a gallon, if no moro can
bo obtained, aro at work among
the members of the house creating a
strong movement in favor of an un
limited bonded period. Should this
succeed it would defeat tho very pur
poso which the administration would
have in viow, If It sought to raise ad
ditional revenuo by an increase of the
whisky tax, since, if the bonded period
is made unlimited, Instead of three
years as at present, whisky distillers
could export all their whisky and store
it at Bermuda, or any other foreign
port, and bring it back to the United
StateB only as the trade demanded.
Thus tho government would derive
even less revenuo than at present
Mr. Cleveland is believed to favor an
increase on whisky of thirty cents, but
he opposes any extension of the
bonded period, or any other step which
will be of financial advantage to the
whisky distillers. The sugar schedule
is intimately tied up with the whisky
tax. There is a growing belief that
the house or failing in the house,
then in tho senate will rejeot tho
Wilson bill provision for tho gradual
abolition of the bounty. It Is under
stood that Mr. Cleveland, while sanc
tioning it, Is not Irrevocably w edded
to the bounty, and that Its rejection in
the house is thereupon not impossible.
Should tho bounty project be wiped out
and a duty of one cent a pound levied
on raw sugar Instead, an entire remod
eling of plans for raising revenue
would be imperative, since the treas
ury would have millions every year in
not being compelled to pay bounties,
and would besides derive an enormous
incrcaso from the raw sugar tax. In
this case there would bo no need
of an increased tax on whisky.
The question of an income tax
has not yet progressed sufficiently
to bo criticised into a bill, because
that subject, too, is found in the final
determination of the revenue what
will flow into tho treasury from sugar
and whisky. In a word, tho democratic
party is to-night on the eve of its first
regular session, as hopelessly at sea on
the manner of carrying out its tariff
reform pledges, as it was nearly four
months ago on the eve of the extraordin
ary session on the subject of silver.
LYNOHBD.
The Dead Body of a Negro Fonnd Hanging
to a Tree.
Atlanta, Dec 4. The deady body
of Lucius Holt, a negro, was found Sun
day morning three miles from Concord
hanging to a tree. Over five hundred
bullet holes were found in his body,
the amount of lead in him rendering it
difficult for four strong men to carry
the body to a wagon, in which he was
hauled away. Tho lynching grew out
of tho murder of Arthur Bcynolds, com
mitted Thursday night Arthur Rey
nolds, white, 21 years old, lived at
Mcriweather across tho river from Pino
county, He went over to Concord
Thursday evening with a load of cotton-seed.
He sold It and started home.
Ho was taken from the wagon, beaten to
death and robbed of his money. Holt
was arrested and confessed his guilt
At tho preliminary examination Holt
was declared responsible for tho
tragedy. When tho two constables who
had Holt in charge were within a mile
of Zebulon, they were surrounded by'
over a hundred armed men, who de
manded possession of the prisoner.
They told Holt that tho time had como
for him to pay tho penalty of his
crime. He described the murder.
Tho regulators, after hearing the pris
oner's story, adjusted the ropo and
swung him into the air. The crowd
exhausted the contents of their re
volvers at tho swaying body and dis
persed. There was a large number of
Negroes in tho lynching party.

THE SECOND SESSION
Of
the Fifty-Third CongroM N'ow Hcnily
lor BualncM.
Washington, Dec. 6. The second'
icssion of tho fifty-third congress, ns
this first regular session of congress
will bo officially known in tho locords,
apened Monday in both houses with
ill the quictudo that wtm brought
about by a lack of anticipation of ox
cltymont, and by an indifference on tho
part of those present that has seldom
been equaled. Only that portion of
tho gnlloilos which is open to tho gen
eral public, and which in these cold,
biting days of December is popular
with tho homeless portion of tho local
population, wns filled. Tho galleries
reserved for tho members' fam
ilies for the diplomatic corps
nnd for tho whito houso
family were almost cmply, tliero was
littlo of thnt effusive handshaking nnd
welcoming Unit usually murks the first
day of a now session because It was
only a few short weeks ngo that the
members sopnrntcd. The general
knowledge that the tariff bill would
not bo brought Into tho house for sov
eral days to come completed tho gen
eral Indiffcrenco and llstlcssncss of tho
scene which ushered lu the new se ion.
Tho presence of tlio destroyer, Di..'.h,
was evidenced by the heavy draperies
and tho mass of whito flowers that
marked the desk of Gen. Lilly, the de
ceased congressman at largo from
Pennsylvania.
A simple sheaf of ripened wheat,
symbolic of the life and activity of the
man, lay on the desk of the late Con
gressman Oncil. As the business of
the house began and tho reporters for
the press association had bent down to
their work at tho littlo tables just be
neath tho speakers, veterans of the
house noted with a pang of regret tho
absence of "Charlie" Hayes who for
nearly two decades had reported with
Intelligence the proceedings of the
house for one of tho great press as
sociations. The usual etiquetto of notifying tho
president by a committco from branches
of congress that a quorum of members
was present and awaited any commu
nication ho might have to make, was
followed by the equally conventional
report to each house, that tho president
would forthwith communicate to them
"a message in writing." Behind Sena
tors McPherson and Sherman, the lat
ter of whom by tlio way was the most
remarked man In the senate to-day
because of the large whito chrys
anthemum in his button hole
stood Maj. Pruden, tho executive clerk
of tho White house holding in his hand
the "message In writing."
After delivering tho message to the
senate Mr. Pruden delivered the samo
document to the house. Tho reading
in both houses was begun at half-past
one o'clock.
In neither house did the reading of
tho message command serious atten
tion. This was partly du& to tho un
interesting nature of tho document it
self and partly to tho wretched deliv
ery of the reading clerk in each house.
After the reading of the message in
the house, Pennsylvania congtessmen
formally announced the death of their
colleagues, Lilly and O'Neill.'- Under
ordinary circumstances this statement
would have been made earlier in tho
day, immediately after the reading of

BALLOTS OR BULLETS?
An Incendiary Speech By u Prominent St.
I'nul l'HKtor.
St. Paul, Minn., Dec. S. Speaking
to a meeting of laboring men Sunday
evening, Rev. John W. Crooks, pastor
of the Burr Street Baptist Church,
made what is regarded by many as a
very incendiary speech. Ho said:
"Everything runs to trusts. Just think
of flour. Wheat has been selling all the
fall at about fifty cents a bushel, one
half the usual price. But I ask in God's
name, who has teen biding flour at
about one-half the usual price'.'
"The flour barons of the republic are
not satisfied with the whole hog, but
they want hog, pen and swill-pall
thrown In. Sooner or later thoro will
come an explosion. It came in Franco
in the days of her communism, and tho
blood of her tyrants flowed like water
and fertilized the fields. It came In
England under Cromwell, nnd tho
heads of kings and nobles fell liko
snowflakes. Whether the present in
equality will be wiped out with ballotb
or bullets 1 can not tell, but I pray by
ballots."

SOME VJffiWS
Of Prominent Legislators on the
President's Message.
Wilson Pleased at What He Says on
tho Tariff Question.
ConerrsMiinn Dnlrrll Snyatho President's
View on tho Tnrlir Aro In Lino With
Thoio Jllthi-rto Lnlcl Down by Him
Itccil Snyn It Is Disappointing.
Washington, Doc. 4. Some of tho
vlows of the prominent legislators on
tho president's message nro sot out ns
follows: Mr. Wilson (dem W. Va.),
chairman of tho ways and means com
mittee, snld: "I am especially pleased
at what ho says on the tariff ques
tion." "Able and appropriate," was the
comment of Mr. McCreary (dcm., Ky.),
chairman of tho house foreign affairs.
"It contains much valuable Informa
tion." '
Dr. DaVell (rep., Pa.): "Tho presi
dent's vlows on tho tariff seem to bo on
tho lino heretofore laid down by him.
Ho thinks a protective tariff invariably,
increases tho cost to tho consumer.
Wo know that such Is not the
case under tho interpretation oi
tho McKlnloy law, a fact that would
havo been apparent to tho president U
ho had scon fit to read testimony
taken before tho ways and moans com
mittee. Of course, as was to bo ex
pected, ho is still after the markets ol
tho world, a very desirable thing ii
present conditions continue, because
there won't bo any market at home oj
any money to spond in them. The mosl
astonishing thing in the message is
that an income tax has bcon agreed
upon. That is news. I happen to bo 8
member of tho minority of tho wayi
and means committee, but it is the ftrsl
time I know such a tax has been agreed
upon, although I have Inquired dill
gently about it every day. So far ai
tho tariff Is concerned tho message it
not a valuable contribution to the di
cusslon. What ho says is not new, al
though he says somethings that an
strange."
Mr. Bynum, (Ind.) "It is a very eon
clsjj, but clear statement of thoattltudi
of the questions which congress will b
called on to consider."
Mr. Springer, (dcm., 111.) "Tho mes
sage is a concise and able opposition ol
the present condition of tho country."
Mr. Heed: "It is exceedingly disap
pointing both in matter and manner.
It is largely made up of a wearlsomi
resume of tho reports of his secretaries
which have have hardly Improved bj
condensation. One tho Hawaii questioi
we were left as much in tho darl
as ever, and must await thi
news of the next steamer jus'
as wo have been for a long time. Thr
president's message which relates ti
the tariff is most surprising It asser
vates that the house committee ii,
charge of the t subject had formulate
plans nnd devised methods of taxatloi
which, as a member of the committee
I have never even heard proposed. I1
is a rather unusual sensation to lean
of the deeds of the committco not ii
tho committee room, but from tin
president of tho United States. Senu
tor Sherman and Senator D. It. Hill ro
fused to express opinions, while Sena
tor Murphy, of New York, said: "It i
an able document."

This is a swamp, caused by hot springs,

by me as tho most loathsome spot I
