POSSIBLY A CHANGE OF BASE.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 4.
declined this morning to talk In regarc
, Ic the published report that the revenue
cutter Corwln was to carry a message
for the state department from Sai
Francisco to Honolulu. Oresham war
busy yesterday with dispatches which
are to go on the Corwln. Of what thest
contain nothing can be learned. Tin
faat of dispatching the Corwln so
hastily leads to a surmise that the
ministration has changed Its policy
towards the Islands.
Washington, Dec. 4. The first senate
session of the fifty-third congress as
sembled at noon. On many of the desi.t
were floral tributes fiom the admirer:
of Jtha respective occupants. Vice

berel with a large basket ot roses.
Bunches of roses lay on the desk ol
Dolph, and the doughty champion ol
the white metal, Stewart, wr.s th r
clplent of a basket of beautiful Murcne
Nells. The galleries were vM illSI
and a tou.'h of color was lent to th
scone by the bright winter toilets o'
the ladles present. Koll-cull showed
fifty-six senators present. After the
ircttminary business had been trans
acted, tti President's message was
' read.
The galleries were filled when Speake'
Crisp rapped the house to order at
noon, with fully 300 members In seatB
The ciiiiimittee on appropriation!

officials engaged In the enforcement
( f the Chinese deportation and regis
tration of a. resolution for the appoint
ment of a committee to Investigate the
Lehigh railway strike. Kllgore ot

disappointment that so little space wa;
allotted to the H.iwallun question.

situation. Since my arrival contlngen
cles have arisen about which nelthe
the United States government nor my
self were aware when I left Washing

else of the discretion allowed me, ti
submit these matters to Washlngtoi
before proceeding further to carry ou
my original Instructions. I forwards
my dispatches to Washington by to
day's steamer, and until I receive nt
answer to them no change will tiilu
place In the present situation, nor wl!
any be allowed."
"What do you mean by the expres
slon, 'nor will any be allowed?' "
"I mean Just this: That until tin
time comes for me to carry out my In
structions, the peaco and good ordei
of this community will be kept undls
turbed In the Interests of humanity;
that any attempt by any person ot
porsons to make trouble will be prompt

vvaslilngton, Dec. 4. The views o
members of both houses concerning th
message are freely expressed. E
speaker Reed said: "It Is exceeding!;
disappointing, both In matter and rr.ari
ner. That part of the message whlcl
relates to the tariff asseverates that
the house committee In charge of tha
subject has formulated plans and le
vised methods which, us a member o'
that committee, I have never ever
heard proposed. It Is rather an tin
usual sensation to learn the deeds o:
the committee not In the committee
room, but fromi Uie president of th
United States. Has that committee
ceased In form to be composed of bot!
parties, and has it without, even th
formality of a word In open ceimmltte
Informed the president of Its deterntlna
Hon In such a way that the preslden
can officially communicate It to the
house? How lemg has It been part oi
our system that a committee of an in
dependent branch, and above all, :
committee wnlen controls the purse
shall report to congress through the
president? Is this the result of hc
uniored blending of the nppolntive will
the legislative power? It Is bad enough
to have tho tariff bill made up by t
little coterie, but to have it communi
cated to the president before It ever,
reaches the committee, still less the
house, shows a determination to be
moved by no facts and modified by ne
arguments, which makes apparent the
absurdity of appointing republle-ans or.
the committee of ways and means ut
all."
Mr. Springer approved the reference
to Hawaii as the only course consistent
with international honor and conilly
Clear, of Iewn, sa-3 the president
gives away the ways and means com

Doutelle It Is the first executive loc

Dalzell, of Pennsylvania That, portion
on the tariff shows that facts weigh
nothing with tariff reformers.

Jones, of Nevada There Is no hope
