WASIUJMTON . D. C. , Dec. ) 1(5.1 (
General Frank Whcalon , U. S. A. , colonel
f the Second infantry , stationed nt Fort
Omaha , arrived yesterday afternoon in the
city. UonorulVheaton is a prominent can
didate for the hngadlor generalship to bo
nindu vacant by the promotion of General
Kuutz o.i the 4tli of January. Ills name was
presented sonic Urao ago by the Nebraska
delegation and also by Iho donation from
Hhodo Island and strong Influence has been
brought to boar on the president to consider
the ease fully. The mugnlllccnt service
which is attached to General Wboaloii's
name since his first connection with the army ,
long before the war of the rebellion , is
rauch In his Interest. Doth Senators Pud-
flock and Mnnderson nave hau interviews
with President Harrison on this subject ana
have urged In the strongest posslblo manner
recognition by the executive of one of the
low remaining ofllcors of the army who
commanded a division during Iho war and
participated In ulinoil every great hattlo of
the army of the Potomac.
Thnro has boon a prevailing Impression
here for some time that the promotion would
bo given to Colonel Otis , now on recraiting
service In Now York , and it has been stated
that tno president was already committed ,
tnrough Iho inlluenco of Senator Proctor ,
ex-secretary of war. to Colonel Otis' candi
dacy. There are some reasons for doubting
this statement , although it Is generally hourd
lioro in Washington ,
General Wlieuton'H Claims.
It Is known that Secretary Proctor has fa
t vored Colonel Otis on the ground that ho
would only endorse such men for positions of
blirti rank as wore physically ablu to tulco the
field in case of war. As Colonel Otis in this
re.poet , has no advantage over General
Whcaton , it cannot bo soon now how the
argument will apply In this caio. General
Wheaton was actively engaged in the last
campaign at Wounded Knou and has n record
of active service so superior to Colonel Otis'
that his friends trust ho may not bo over
looked. There will bo n btrong effort made
bv his friends to bring his case prominently
before the chief executive.
A Inrgo i.umDor of Nebraska ofllco holders
connected with the various departments of
the government are contemplating the forma
tion of a Nebraska Republican association In
Washington , the object of which shall bo to
give such aid and nssistnnco us tier , wttnin
their power In promotion of republican In
terests and the election of republican candi
dates in the state which they are accredited.
Most of the other states have associations of
this character. The movement has already
been inaugurated and it 1 expected that before -
fore the week closes the organization will bo
accomplished.
IlurduiiH oPO/TlL-clioldors.
The fact that all the republican candidates
for congress [ rum Nebraska were defeated at
the lost election has throun upon the two
senators Irom'that'2MateJifnnnverWhelmlnB ' >
burden of puuno busi _ - s which
was heretofore divided between the
throe representatives from tab three
districts. The most burdensome I
nil Is the daily recurring of postolllco ap
pointments and postoflico locations , and the
iivtcrmlniiblo quarrels pertaining to matters
of this character. At the close of the last
congress Senators Mnmlerson and Paddock
agreed that they would divide thcso burdens
equally between themselves , taking iho
Platte river as the division line of domarkn-
tlnn , Senator Mandorson attending to the
POiitolllccs on the north and Senator Pad
dock giving his attention to those on the
Foutn. When it is understood that each ton-
ntor receives from forty to fifty letters per
day about postoflico matters which ,
during the Pifty-llrst congress , was
divided among the throe representa
tives , all three being republicans ,
it can ho soon how great was tno necessity
for some division of this labor upon all mai
lers of state importance In connection with
postofllccs and upon all questions involving
general state interests. There Is the freest
consultation and oxctianco of views between
Senators Mandorson and Paddock.
Senator Kyle Hxpluin.s.
\ Senator ICylo's notion of yesterday nt-
tnictod wldo attention today , but the com
ment was no loss severe than It was yester
day , and the Impression prevails that the
South Dakota senator , by trying to work both
Bides of the chamber lor committee places ,
has not succeeded In establishing himself
on easy terms in the senate. Senator Kyle
lias unwisely attempted to enter a denial.
} lo said today that all tins talk about him
was untruo. Ho denied that ho had made
any request of the republican caucus or of
republicans for committee places nnd as-
Bcrted that the republicans sent for him and
if they had not ho would not have knocked at
the door of their caucus room yesterday.
A question of veracity arises between Son-
ntor Kyle nnd several republican senators ,
notably Senator Cullom of Illinois. It was
( Jullom who was called out of the republican
caucus by Kyle yesterday and when ho re
turned made the statement that
Kyle asked the same consideration
of the republicans that bad been ac
corded to Scnntor Peffor. * Last nliilit
Kyle said Cullom had cent for him. The
JlHnoisan llatly dottles this. Ho says that
When ho arrived at the capitol yesterday
morning ho was informed that Kyle was
looking for him and ho told ono of thenfllcors
of the sonuto Unit ho would bo in the repub
lican caucus nnd bo know nothing more
about Kylu until ho was called out of the
caucus. ThU Is substantiated so far as cir
cumstances are known by other republican
senator * Ilko Mantlorson. Humidors and
Washburn , nnd there Is no question hut what
Kyle had Indicated his desire to bo tnkeu
care of by the republican causus after the
democrats had made assignments for him.
Already In Trouble.
The court of private claims , which was es-
tabllihed under the authority of an act In the
last impress , has already gotten Itself into
rather an unpleasant predicament. Tno law
provides that the act under which the court
wua organized should be published In thu
01110.1 of Denver , Santa Fo nnd Washington ,
Chief Justice ) Hold of the now court In
structed tils clerk to make the necessary ar
rangements to have the publications made
according to law , and the clerk , without con
sulting the uttorncy general or anyone else ,
authorized the publication In the cities
named in the net. The law was printed In
full In Spanish mm English for ninety days ,
lllllni ; up almost ono entire side of tbo Wash
ington Post.
Now the bills for this publication have
conio in and the local paper hero asks $ ' ,1,411) )
for Ha space. The Denver paper wants
ti.KXi : ( ami the Santa Fo paper tO.OOO. The
accounts have cone to Attorney General
Miller , who positively refuses to pay thorn.
Ho say * that no contract was entered Into ;
that the papers have boon allowed to charge
Jtibt whatever they saw lit , and that lio-tms
no money with which to nay the bills. The
total bill for advertising Is upwards of ? 18-
000 , while Iho ontlro appropriation made for
the court Is only fCiO.OOU. 'Iho attorney gen
eral tavs that the claimants must go to con-
EresH , und It li likely that tbolr bills will bo
very materially scaled down unit that they
will wait nuny years before receiving tbelr

Congressman Culborson of Texas , to whom
tbo president tendered tbo ofticoof uoromcrca
commissioner to succeed. Mr , Bragg of Ala-
called upon tbc ureildcnl today uud
declined the ofllco. Mr. Culbcrson. It Is un
derstood , gave as the reason of his declina
tion the faet that his pcoplo "protested"
against his leaving congress. It is under
stood , however , that the real reason why Mr.
Culbor on will not accept tlio ofllcc Is be
cause ho harbors senatorial aspirations. The
Texas legislature , which will meet some time
next spring , must elect a successor to Scn
ntor Reagan. Mr. Mills' recent defeat for
the spcakorshlp has made him n candidate
for that ofllco , but now that Air. ( Julborson

his success Is by no means as certain as bis

Bureau or Amcrlu'in Republics.
1'rosldnnt Harrison today sent to the senate
ate a letter from the secretary of state , en
closing a copy of Iho llrst annual report of
William E. Curtis , the director of the
bureau of American republics. Mr. Curtis
says that tbo immense number of applica
tions received for Information about South
American countries gives atnplo evidence of
an awakened Interest In the commerce and
the conditions of the neighboring countries
that Is encouraging to these who nro endeav
oring to promote social commercial relations
between the American republics.
The report refers to tbo rapidly increasihg
export trade to tbo Central and South Aiuor-
icnn renu biles , ana says that many United
States manufacturers who have never at
tempted to sell merchandise in the continent
now have agents in those markets to intro
duce their goods. The merchants of Mexico
and tno cllloi of Centrr.l and South America ,
who have heretofore purchased their goods
In Europe exclusively , are now coming to
the United States , and invariably discover
that they can llnd hero nearly every nrtlulo
tboy need , ot a bettor quality and at no
greater cost than they can bo obtained in
Gro.at Britain , Germany nnd France. The
recently negotiated reciprocity arrange
ments , it is said , also afford them opportuni
ties that are beginning to bo understood and
appreciated.
Mr , Curtis refers to the work undertaken
by tire bureau of interesting the governments
nnd the people of Latin-America In the
World's Columbian exposition. The Invita
tion extended to them to participate in the
exposition bus , ho says , been cordially ac
cepted by evorv republic and colony. Nearly
every ono of the southern republics will erect
upon the exposition grounds n building of its
own , upon a design typical of Its peculiar
nrchlit'cluro , and surround It with practical
illustrations of tbo lifu and industries of its
people.
The bureau lias been enabled to prepare
for exhibition at Chicago a historical collec
tion illustrating the discovery , tbo con
quest and the settlement or Latin-
America , the colonial period , and tbo epoch
of the revolution for Independence. A
naval otllcor is now in Spaih superintending
thu construction of a caravel , which Is to
ha the exact fao simile nf that in which Co
lumbus made his tlrst voyage of discovery.
It U to bo equipped in the same way and
manned by Spanish sailors In tbo costume of
400 years ago. The vessel will bo brought in
time to participate in tbo naval review that
1s to take place at New York in April , IblO ,
and will bo towed through tbo lakes to Chicago
cage lo remain during tlu < exposition. U will
then return to Wasnlngton and bo perma
nently moored In the river south ot tbo ox-
ecullvu mansion.
It is also proposed , Mr , Curtis says , to prepare -
pare for the exposition a commercial exhibit ,
illustrating the various classes of mcrchaii-
dhu host adapted to tbo wunu , und most ac
ceptable to the tastes , of consumers In Mexico
ice , Central and South America , and ttio
West Indies. This exhibit , it is proposed , nt
the close of tbo exposition , shall by perma
nently established either In Washington or
Now Vork.

"Tho Line Drawn Between tbo Creamery or

Ing , " a paper prepared by II. E. Heath of
the Nobrasua Farmer , was road in that gen
tleman's absence by T. J. Hillo. The two
were shown not to bo antagonistic , but
rnthor helpful to each otbor.
J. H. Monrad of Chicago introduced the
question of the millc test , its importance to
creamery mou , and thu discussion took a
wide range , covering all the objectionable
and commendable features of the system ,
tfon , A. C. Tuppor , .stat9 dairy commissioner
ot Iowa , delivered an interesting nnd
thoughtful address on tbo subject of "What
State Laws Are Needed for the Protection
and Encouragement of the Dairy Industry. "
"Dairy Schools and Tholr Work" was tlio
subject of a flno address by PrcA C. L.

with hearty approval by all present.

entitled , "Xingnrelll. " Ono of tbo best and
most entertaining addresses of tbo conven
tion was that of Colonel J. E. Simpson of
this cltv. His subject was , "If Iho Farmer
WillTiikoCaroof the Cow , the Cow Will
Take Care of the Mortgage. " The address
was practical and proved , from the actual ox-
pcrionco of many , that its title was an
absolute truism. D. C. Asnburn was pn-
vented by illness from being present
to give bis paper on "Tho Dairy
Industry nt the World's Fair , " but
it was read by Secretary Uansett. It was
road in connection with a letter from Com

ninonc other things that while tbo national

--llns unchanged , the dispatchers nnd

until their domauds are acceded to. After n
thorough Investigation Into tlio sentiment of
the people nf this community , it is found
that the course of General Superintendent -
intondont Gnbol , as well ns the
general management of the com
pany , is pretty freely endorsed by well-
meaning nnd level-beaded citizens. The report -
port Is current that the company would
prefer to lay oft ttio 350 men now employed
In the shops in this city and every man along
the vast line of its railroad than accede to
what U considered the arbitrary nnd Im-
porlous demands of the telegraphers now
out on a strike. Mr. Gabel has exhausted
every resource to bring about an nmlcablo
settlement , but the strikers refuse to enter
tain any overtures , preferring to show their
strength rather than to act in reason.
General Superintendent Gabcl has just re
ceived authority by telegraph fiom Presi
dent Manvel to sign the schedule under an
equitable agreement , which provides that
tlio men shall rcstimo work at once upon tbo
schedule being signed , subject to such con-
clustvo action us may bo decided upon later
by the board In proper negotiation with rop-
rcsoitatlves of the Order of Telegraphers.
It is understood that in the telegram of In

wish to sco Superintendent Gabel as soon as
possible in order that ho mik'ht tale up the
whole question with him for tbo purpose of
arriving at a friendly aud equitable adjust
ment of all differences.
