The Navy
T T is not for tho purpose of starting anew
?1 the rivalry in armaments between nations
that Secretary of the Navy Daniels, in his
annual report, urges Congress to proceed with
tho great naval program which has been pre
sented to that body. On tho contrary, lie
expresses t he earnest liopo of all Americans
when he foresees the day?soon or late?
when an1 international agreement of binding
effort can make possible a general disarma
inent. Hut Mr. Daniels would bo negligent ,
indeed were he to shape the naval policy of
this country at the present-Aime of uncer-i
taimy according to (lie pattern of what, after'
all. is nothing more, for tho moment, fTian a
general desire.
America stands ready to disarm as soon
as tho other nations bind themselves to the
same course. Not only this, but it is willing
to lend its effort to uny practical movement
among nations that will lead to such an
agreement. But tho one lesson that has been
impressed indelibly on our minds during tho
past year and a half of feverish preparation
is that, so :ong as the possib'iity remains for
any nation or group of nations to assail our
liberties in a test of strength, wo cannot af
ford to go baclc to the state of unprepared
ness to which, thanks to the neglect of by- j
gone administrations, wo had been reduced. I
So much for the main recommendation in j
Mr. Daniels's report, which recommendation j
Congress can hardly ignore. As to the record J.
he portrays of the participation of our naval j
contingents in the world conflict, it is com
plete and most satisfying. Truly it is a record
of which all Americans can be proud, for
while the temerity of the German high seas
licet did not ponni. that great sea battle for
which every American jackie yearned, the
American navy performed its appointed task
with >ui efllciency that left nothing to be de
sired. Whether it was tlie business of guard
ing transports from tho lurking enemy sub
marines, or laying mine barrages, or speed
ing up the work of its yards, the navy never
failed to make good. Its marine contingents
in Fiance wrote a (laming page of heroism
into the history of our country; its giant
naval guns, placed on flat cars, poured into
(he back areas of (lie Hun armies a fire that
was terrible in its effectiveness.
It is a late day, but not too late, to appre
ciate to (lie full extent tho part which Mr.
Daniels himself ha.-, contributed toward the i
present efllciency of the navy. From the
very lirst, when much thai he did was scoffed
at because it was now or because of the in
nate unfairness of his critics, his aim has been '
to build up teamwork in the navy. He was told
by liis critics that (lis efforts to raise the stand
ards an 1 status of tho enlisted men would
completely disrupt discipline, and unfriendly
c\ '?(;>oi!is pictured him as growing wistaria
vI:? ?- ,i ng the sides of Dreadnoughts be- j

should bo objection to tho adoption of ordi

it would be neces&ary to pay such an agent
it is ccrtain that a tromendous annual saving
could bo offocted through tho co-ordination

West Virginia soldiers encampod at tho
Fair Grounds have set au example worthy
of emulation by tho people of Richmond.
They gladly havo foregono anticipated pleas
ures and donated the whole of their canteen
fund to their wounded brotliers-in-arins who
aro patients at the Westhampton military
hospital. Will Richmond permit such an ex
ample of patriotic unselfishness to pass un
followed? Tho Christmas season is almost
here, and Richmond has as its honored guests
hundreds of young men who followed the
colors in France, who dared all, and have
como back inaiinod or ill. For months they
havo been unpaid by tho govorrunent, and
temporarily they aro without funds. They
must not be without friends. Richmond, of
course, is eager to honor, and does honor,
these returned heroes, but there must be
something more substantial than lip aervicfe.
Tho Christmas time must not pass without
those more material tokens to cheer these
sons of the United States. Why not a general
Christmas fund, whereby their comfort and
happiness may be increased?
The ex-Crown Prince of Germany protests

Richmond always welcomes now industries

be noted in the decootying industry about to

Health Talks, by Dr. Wm. Brady
'l'ht Old F. 1?. and (he New 1?. II.
(Copyright. WIS. I>y National Newspaper Servtce.)
Federal. State and city health departments
aro constantly encroaching nioro and nioro on
the family physician's province. A considerable
part of the activities of these public health de
partments nowadays Is directed toward tho
treatment of Individuals for various ills. In
some cities, in fact, the health departments run
regular advertisements in the papers seeking
patients to treat. That l? going further than
tho old family doctor over ventured.
Public health administration, after all, is
nothing more or less than an elTort to teach in
dividuals how to avoid Illness and, if necessary,
to forco Individuals to comply with the health
or sanitary laws and regulations.
Public health departments arc always calling
on tho family physicians to assist them. They
aro quite impotent, indeed, without tho assist
ance and support of the practicing physicians
in the community. Nay, the sickness rato and
death rate in a given community is determined,
not by tne elllciency of the public health ollicers
of that community, but by the honesty and
generosity of the practicing physicians of the
community. An honest physician never forgets
or neglects to make a prompt report of any
communicable disease ho diagnoses or suspects,
thus enabling the health olllcer to take prompt
action to protect tho people .against the spread
of tho disease.
The family physician has been contributing
ills services to the State for many years, and in
return the State has accepted the services and
rested the matter there. It Is about time for tho
State to recognize the Indispensable aid oT the
practicing physician by compensating him as It
docs the health olllcer and his Various assistants,
for services rendered. There Is no question that
the State would receivo Infinitely better servlco,
and the health of the community would bo vastly
Increased, if lite family doctor were so recog
nised by the State lCvery physician licensed by
the State to practice his profession bhould there
by become a public health seYvani answorahle
to the State precisely as tho public health office
holder now is. Instead of ono health olllcer for
a city, there should bo as many health ollicers
as there are reputable physicians, eve.-y one of
tliem eager to prove himself more eflicient than
his neighbors.
Public health Is too big a problem for one
man or one group to manage. It Is big enough
to be entrusted to the whole healing profession,
all schools, only so the practitioners arc legally
qualified.

voice. Hut, alas, 1 have moved, and lost the
recipe. Would you be good enough to repeat
the formula? C. II. B.
Answer.? It was a formula originated by J. \V.
ICngiand and used in the Philadelphia Hospital:
Potassium chlorate. 120 grams; boiling water,
four tluid ounces: powdered alum, one drani;
stronger rose water, two fluid ounces, live
drams; glycerine, sirup, of each, four lluld
drains; lluid extract of red gum (eucalyptus ros
trata), three fluid drams. Dissolve tho potas
sium chlorate in the boiling water, cool and re
serve. Dissolve the alum In tho. strong' r rose
water, add the other three ingredients in order
named, then add this to the reserved portion.
(If fluid extract of red gum cannot bo obtained,
one and one-half fluid drams of fluid extract of
kino (which is ollieial in the U. S. Pharmaco
poeia) may bo substituted.
Directions: Mix a tablospoonful with an equal
volumo of water for gargling, overy three or
four hours, or on<*o or twice shortly before
using tho voice. (The preparation should be a
ruby red liquid of agreeable odor und taste.)

"Competition is tho life of trade ;
used to be printed on placards and
hung In the windows of all the stores
on Main and Broad Streets In Rich

the maxim almost hb a religion. Con
ditions and development have taught
us that frequently competition Is the
death of trade. When it is excessive
everybody suffers In the long run and
commercial crashes come. Everywhere
in this country are middle-aged and
old men who were ruined by pass
books. In tho competition for business

masses of the people, every family had
its pass-book. Tho people who paid

"The Jackson Monument" in The

it encumbent upon the veterans, as
well as upon tho Confederate societies
of tiie Daughters, to send a speedy and ,

of history regarding Jackson's death, ,
by correcting the inscription on the
pedestal of the monument, soon to be

How will the phrase "Killed nt
Chance Dors villa," tally with extracts
from the "Idle and I.otters of Stone

having a wide circulation. In the ex

that Jackson lived eight days after
