PEN GIRLS IN THE
UNIVERSITY PLAY
, . LAST NIGHT
The presentation of "Mrs. Bump
stead Leigh, ' at the Orpheum theater
'.lust night was witnessed by a large
audience
An amateur production It was call
ed and "Amateur' a right when
one thinks of the true meaning of the
word, which means "one who follows
the pursuit of an art for the love of
, It" without remuneration and whose
work may be equal or superior to
that of the professional " So it
proved last night for the. work ot
thl6 fine Utah amateur dramatic or
ganization could easily meet profes
sional criticism, and much credit is
due Professor Maud May Babcock
and Luanc G Hunt for the excellence
and completeness of the presentation
of ' Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh "
Those who saw America s foremost
actress, Mrs. Flske, In the same pro
auction several seasons ago. could
trace a great elmilarlt of interpreta
tion of the work of Miss Llla Eccles,
who played the title role, to that or
the famous star ftlisi Eccles, who
If a daughter of Mrs David Eccles
of Opden. has pleased her friend
man times before by her fine read
ings, but a person would not have to
be acquainted with her to appreciate
pnd enjoy such a splendid character
ization of 1 Mrs Bumpstead Leigh,
as she gave last night, for her work
was almost faultiest
Two other Ogdon girls also did
much to make the production success
ful Jennetta Stephens gave, a studied
delineation of the role of Miss Raw
bon, the sedate old ma'd. with the
family tree of w h i ch she was so
proud, and Edyth Barlow scored a big
hit In the comedy bj playing the part
of Mrs. de Salle, the Hoosicr matron
who tried to cover her provincial
manners and dialect In the garb or
high society with a naturalness that
was praiseworthy
As Peter Swallow, the monument
salesman, Herbert Maw proved him
self to be an excellent comedian
Hiss Armorel Dixon who took the
part of Violet de Salle, one of the
most trying roles in the piny, did
plendid work and her Ingenuous
manner of flirting with the Rawson
I hoys and betraying the real ancestry
Ls Of her mother was one of the most
pleasing features of the production
Henry Ruggerri handled the role
of Mr. Ievitt in a masterh way, and
Annie Staines played Mrs Levitt In
a most charming manner Allen
Thurman made a fine cowboy and
his work was greatly appreciated.
Grover Giles was acceptable In the
part of the young business man, his
lcvemaklng with the maid being ex
ceptionally well done Miss f'lnra
Kimball, as the maid, looked and act
ed the part
The characterization of thp stem
father gien by J. A Peterson, was
a high compliment to his ability as
an actor and was one of the best In
the cast. Vernon Snvder, as the but
ler, carried his part as though he had
been "In service" mo6t of hl6 life.
