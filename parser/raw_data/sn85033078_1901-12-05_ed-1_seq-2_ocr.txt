MESSAGE.
RECIPROCITY gIS IN FAVOR
Abuses in Mails Great and Correction
Is Demanded —Generous Treatment
of Cubans Suggested. Trusts and
Anarchy Treated of and Many
Other Subjects Considered.
Washington , Dec. 3. —President
Roosevelt’s message read to congress
today was 22,000 words long, and in
the opening an eloquent eulogy was
paid to William McKinley, who was
spoken of as “the most widely loved
man in all the United States." Then
the question of anarchy is considered
and the president urges a more rigid
exclusion of undesirable foreigners.
It is also recommended that the federal
courts be given jurisdiction over any
man who kills or attempts to kill the
president or any man who by the
constitution or by law is in line of suc
cession for the presidency.
TRUSTS.
During the last fire years business con
fidence. continues the president, has been
restored, and the nation is to be congratu
lated because of its present abounding
prosperity. Such prosperity can never be
created by law alone, although it is easy
enough to destroy it by mischievous laws.
Then follows a consideration of the trusts.
The creation of great corporate fortunes
has not been due to the tariff nor to any
other governmental action, says the presi
dent, hut to natural causes in the business
world, operating in other countries as they
operate in our own. The process has
aroused much antagonism, a great part of
which is wholly without warrant. It is
not true that as the rich have grown richer
the poor have grown poorer. On the con
trary, never before has the average mnn.
the ' wage-worker, the farmer, the small
trader, been so well off as in this country
and at the present time. A chief reason
for caution in dealing with corporations is
to be found in the international commer
cial conditions of today. The same busi
ness conditions which have produced the
great aggregations of corporate and in
dividual wealth have made them very po
tent factors in international commercial
competition. Business concerns which have
the largest means at their disposal and are
managed by the ablest men are naturally
those which take the lead in the strife for
commercial supremacy among the nations
of the world. It cannot too often be
pointed out that to strike with ignorant
violence at the interests of one set of
men almost inevitably endangers the in
terests of all.
There is a widespread conviction in the
minds of the American people that the
great corpoi'ations known as trusts are in
certain of their features and tendencies
hurtful to the general welfare. Corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
should be regulated if they are found to
exercise a license working to the public in
jury. It should lie as much the aim of
those who seek for social betterment to
rid the business world of crimes of cun
ning as to rid the entire body politic of
crimes of violence. The first essential in
determining how to deal with the great in
dustrial combinations is knowledge of the
facts—publicity. In the interest of the pub
lic, the government should have the right
to inspect and examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in inter
state business. Publicity is the only sure
remedy which we can now invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way of
governmental regulation or taxation can
only be determined after publicity has
been obtained, by process of law, and in
the course of administration. The large
corporations, commonly called trusts,
though organized in one state, always do
business in many states, often doing very
little business in the state where they are
incorporated. There is utter lack of uni
formity in the state laws about them; and
as no state has any exclusive interest in
or power over their acts, it has in prac
tice proved impossible to get adequate reg
ulation through state action. Therefore,
in the interest of the whole people, the na
tion should, without interfering with the
power of the states in the matter itself,
also assume power of supervision and regu
lation over all corporations doing an inter
state business. The president believes that
a law can be framed which will enable the
national government to exercise control
along the lines above indicated, profiting
by the experience gained through the
passage and administration of the inter
state-commerce act. If. however, the judg
ment of the congress is that it racks the
i constitutional power to pass such an act,
' rhen a constitutional amendment should be
submitted to cornier the power.
There should be created a cabinet officer,
to be known as secretary of commerce and
industries, as provided in the bili intro
duced at the last session of the congress.
It should be his province to deal with com
merce in its broadest sense 1 , including
among many other things whatever con
cerns labor and all matters affecting the
great, business corporations and our mer
chant marine. If possible legislation should
he passed, in connection with the interstate
; commerce law, which will render effective
the efforts of different states to do away
with the competition of convict contract
labor in the open labor market. In all in
dustries carried on directly or indirectly
for the United government women
and children should be protected from ex
cessive hours of labor, from night work,
and from work under unsanitary condi
tions. Tire government should provide in
its contracts that all work should lie done
under fair conditions, and in addition to
setting a high standard should uphold It
by proper inspection, extending if neces
sary to the subcontractors. The govern
ment should forbid all night work for
women and children.
IMMIGRATION.
Our present immigra-trion laws are un
satisfactory. We need every honest and
efficient Imm igra nt fitted to become an
American citizen, every immigrant who
comes here to stay, who here a
strong body, a stout heart, a good head,
and a resolute purpose to do his duty well
in every way aud to bring up his children
as law-abiding and Bod-fearing members
■of the community. But there should he a
'•omprehenslve law enacted with the object
of working a threefold improvement over
our present system. First, we should aim
to exclude absolutely ot only all persons
who are known to he believers in anarchis
tic principles or members of anarchistic
societies, but also all persons who are of a
low moral tendency or of unsavory reputa
tion. The second object ought to be to se
cure bj a careful anti not merely perfunc
tory educational test so-iue intelligent
capacity to appreciate American institu
tions and act sanely as American citizens.
Finally. all persons should be excluded who
are below a certain standard of economic
fitness to enter our Industrial field as eom
perloors with American labor. There
shouM be proper proof of personal capacity
to earn an American, living and enough
to insure a decent start under
American conditions.
TfTK TARIFF.
There is general acquiescence in our pres
ent tariff system as a national policy. The
first requisite to our prosperity is the cou
rt rrwity and stability of this economic pol
icy. Nothing could be more unwise than
t-o disturb the business interests of the
country by any general tariff change at this
time. Yet it fs not only possible, but emi
nently desirable, to combine with the
stability of our economic system a supple
mentary system of reciprocal benefit and
obligation with other nations. Such reci
procity is an incident aud result of the
firm establishment and preservation of
our present economic policy. It was spe
cially provided for in the present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as the hand
maiden of protection. Our first duty Is to
see that the protection granted by the
tariff in every case where it is needed is
maintained, and, that reciprocity be sought
for so far as it can safely be done without
injury to our home industries. Just how
far this is must be determined according to
the individual case, remembering always
that every application of our tariff policy
to meet our shifting national needs must
be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that
the duties must never be reduced below
the point that will cover the difference be
tween the labor cost here and abroad. The
well-being of the wage-worker is a prime
consideration of onr entire policy of eco
nomic legislation. Subject to this proviso
of the proper protection necessary to our
industrial well-being at home, the princi
ple of reciprocity must command our
hearty support. The natural line of de
velopment for a policy of reciprocity will
oe in connection with those of our produc
tions which no longer require all of the
support once needed to establish them upon
a sound basis, and with those others where
either because of natural or of economic
causes we are beyond the reach of success
ful competition.
MERCHANT MARINE,
The condition of the American merchant
marine is such as to call for immediate
remedial action hy the congress. It is dis
creditable to us as a nation that our mer
chant marine should be utterly insignifi
cant in comparison to that of other nations
which we overtop in other forms of busi
ness. We should not longer submit to con
ditions under which only a trifling portion
of our great commerce is carried in our
own ships. To remedy this state of things
would not merely serve to build up our
shipping interests, but it would also result
in benefit to all who are interested in the
permanent establishment of a wider mar
ket for American products, and would pro
vide an auxiliary force for the navy. Ships
work for their own countries just as rail
roads work for their terminal points. Ship
ping lines, if established to the principal
countries with which we have dealings,
would be of political as well as commercial
benefit. From every standpoint it is un
wise for the United' States to continue to
rely upon the ships of competing nations
for the distribution of our goods. It should
be made advantageous to carry American
goods in American-built ships.
At present American shipping is under
certain great disadvantages when put in
competition with the shipping of foreign
countries. Majy of the fast foreign steam
ships. at a speed of 14 knots or above, are
subsidized: and all our ships, sailing ves
sels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of
slow speed and mail carriers of high speed,
have to meet the fact that the original cost
of building American ships is greater than
is the case abroad; that the wages paid
American officers and seamen are very
much higher than those paid the officers
and seamen of foreign competing coun
tries; and that the standard of living on
our ships is far superior to fhe standard
of living on the ships of our commercial
rivals. Our government should take such
action as will remedy these_ inequalities.
The American merchant marine should be
restored to the ocean.
The gold standard is endorsed and econ
omy is urged but it is suggested that care
should be taken not to reduce the revenues
so that there will be any possibility of a
deficit; but, after providing against any
such contingency, means should he adopted
which will bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of ont, actual needs.
The interstate railway act should be
amended, says the president. The railway
is a public servant. Its raves should be jusi
to and open to all shippers alike. The gov
ernment should see to it that within its
jurisdiction this is so and should provide a
speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to
that end.
AGRICULTURAL DEi*AKT.MEXT.
The department of agriculture has stead
ily broadened its work on economic lines,
and has accomplished results of real value
in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade.
It has gone into new fields until it is now
in touch with all sections of our country
and with two of the island groups that
have lately come under our jurisdiction,
whose people must look to agriculture as a
livelihood. It is searching the world for
grains, grasses, fruits, and vegetables spe
cially fitted for introduction into localities
in the several states and territories w T bere
they may add materially to our resources.
By scientific attention to soil survey and
possible new crops, to breeding of new va
rieties of plants, to experimental ship
ments, to animal industry and applied
chemistry, very practical aid has been
given our farming and stock-growing in
terests. Public opinion throughout the
United States has moved steadily toward a
just appreciation of the value of forests,
whether planted or of natural growth. The
great part played by them in the creation
and maintenance of the national wealth is
now more fully realized than ever before.
Wise forest protection does not mean the
withdrawal of forest resources, whether of
wood, water, or grass, from contributing
their full share to the welfare of the peo
ple. but, on the contrary, gives the assur
ance of larger and more certain supplies.
The fundamental idea of forestry is the
perpetuation of forests by use. Forest pro
tection is not an end. of itself: it is a
means to increase and sustain the resources'
of our country and the industries Avbicb
depend upon them. The preservation of
our forests .is an imperative business neces
sity. The president should have by law
the power of transferring lands for use as
forest reserves to the department of agri
culture. The forest and water problems
are perhaps the most vital internal ques
tions of the United States, declared Mr.
Roosevelt.
The forests are natural reservoirs. By
restraining the streams in flood and re
plenishing them in drought they make pos
sibie the use of waters otherwise wasted.
They prevent the soil from washing, and
so protect the storage reservoirs from fill
ing up with silt. Forest conservation is
therefore an essential condition to water
conservation. The forests alone cannot,
however, fully regulate and conserve the
waters of the arid region. Great storage
works are necessary to equalize the flow of
streams and to save the floi/d waters. Their
construction has been conclusively shown
to be an undertaking too vast for private
effort. Nor can it lie best accomplished* by
the individual states acting alone. Far
reaching interstate problems are involved;
and the resources of single states "would
often be Inadequate. It is as right for the
national government to make the streams
and rivers of the arid region useful by en
gineering works for wafer storage as to
mate useful the rivers and harbors of the
humid region hr engineering works of an
other kind. The storing of the floods in
reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers
is but an enlargement of our present pol
icy of river control, under which levees are
built on the lower reaches of the same
streams. The government should construct
and' maintain these reservoirs as it does
other public works. Where their purpose
is to regulate the flow of streams, the
water should be- turned 1 freely into the
channels in the dry season to take the same
course under the same laws as the natural
flow.
The reclamation! of the unsettled arid
public lands presents a different problem.
Here it is not enough to regulate the flow
of streams. The object of the government
is to dispose of the land to settlers who
will bui'M homes apoiv ft. To accomplish
this object water must be brought within
their reach. There remain vast areas of
public load which can be made available
for homestead settlement, but only by
reservoirs and mam-line casuals imprac
ticable for private enterprise'. These irri
gation works should he built by the na
tional’ government. The lands reclaimed by
them should he reserved by the government
for actual settlers, and the cost of con
struction* should so far as possible be re
paid by the land reclaimed. The distribu
tion of the water, the division of the
streams among irrigators, shoirfd be left to
the settlers themselves in conformity with
state laws and without interference with
those laws or with vested rights. The pol
icy of the national government should be
to aid irrigation in the several states and
territories in such manner as wifi enable
the people in the- local communities to help
themselves.
In the arid states- the only right to water
which should lie recognized la that of use.
In iriigatfon this right should attach to the
land reclaimed amJ be inseparable there
from. Granting perpetual water rights to
others than users, without compensation to
the public. is open to all the objections
which apply to giving away perpetual
franchises to the public utilities of cities.
A few of the western states have already
recognized this, and have incorporated in
their constitutions the doctrine of per
petual state ownership of water. Onr aim
should be not simply to reclaim the larg
est area of land and provide homes for the
largest number of people, but to create for
this new industry the best possible social
and industrial conditions; and this requires
that we not only understand the existing
situation, but avail ourselves of the best
experience of the time in the solution of
its problems. A careful study .-hould be
made, both by the nation and the states,
of the'irrigation laws and conditions here
and abroad. Ultimately it will probably be
necessary for the nation to co-operate with
the several arid stares in proportion as
these states by their legislation and admin
istration show themselves fit to receive it.
HAWAII AND PORTO RICO.
In Hawaii orr aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of large es
tates tilled by cheap labor: we wish a
healthy American community of men who
themselves till the farms they own. All
our legislation for the islands should he
shaped with this end in view; the well
being of the average home-maker must af
ford the true test of the healthy develop
ment of the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled on
our homestead system.
It Is a pleasure to say that it is hardly
more necessary to report as to Porto Rico
than as to any state or territory within our
continental limits. The Island is thriving
as never before, and it Is being adminis-
tered efficiently and honestly. Its people
are now enjoying liberty and order under
the protection of the United States, and
upon this fact we congratulate them and
ourselves. Their material welfare must be
as carefully and jealousy considered as the
welfare of any other portion of our coun
try. We have given them the great gift of
free access for their products to the mar
kets of the United States. The attention
of congress is asked to the need of legisla
tion concerning the public lands of Porto
Rico.
CUBA. '
In Cuba such progress has been made
toward putting the independent govern
ment of the island upon a tirm footing that
before the present session of congress
close® this will be an accomplished fact.
Cuba will then start as her own mistress:
and to the beautiful queen of the Antilles,
as she unfolds this new page of her destiny,
we extend our heartiest greetings. In the
case of Cuba there are weighty reasons of
morality and of national interest why the
policy of reciprocity should be held to have
a peculiar application, and the president
most earnestly asks your attention to the
wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of pro
viding for a substantial reduction in the
tariff duties on Cuban imports into the
United States.
THE PHILIPPINES.
The Philippines are rich tropical islands,
inhabited by many varying tribes, repre
seuting widely different stages of progress
toward civilization. Our earnest effort is
to help these people upward along the
stony and difficult path that leads to self
government. We hope to make our admin
istration of the islands honorable to onr
nation by making it of the highest benefit
to the Filipinos themselves. It is no light

tion. Our aim is high. We do not desire
to do for the islanders merely what has
elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by
even the best foreign governments. We
hope to do for them what has never before
been done for any people of the tropics—to
make them fit for self-government after the
fashion of the really free nations.
History may safely be challenged to show
a single instance in which a masterful race
such as ours, having been forced by the ex
igencies of war to take possession of an
alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants
with the disinterested zeal for their prog
ress that our people have shown in the
Philippines. To leave the islands at this
time would mean tnat they would fall into
a welter of murderous anarchy. Such de
sertion of duty on our part would be a
crime against humanity. Tim character of
Gov. Taft and of his associates and subor
dinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the
sincerity of our effort to give the islanders
a constantly increasing measure of self
government, exactly as fast as they show
themselves fit to exercise it. Since the
civil government was established not an ap
pointment has been made in the islands
with any reference to considerations of po
litical influence, or to aught else save the
fitness of the man and the needs of the
service. The only fear is lest in our over:
anxiety we give them a degree of independ
ence for which they are unfit, thereby in
viting reaction and disaster. As fast as
there is any reasonable hope that in a
given district the people can govern them
selves, self-government has been given in
that district. There are still troubles
ahead in the islands. The insurrection has
become an affair of local banditti and ma
rauders, wbo deserve no higher regard than
the brigands of portions of the bid world.
Encouragement, direct or indirect, to these
insurrectos stands on the same footing as
encouragement to hostile Indians in the
days when we still had Indian wars. Ex
actly ns our aim is to give to the Indian
who remains peaceful the fullest and
amplest consideration, but to have it un
derstood that we will show no weakness if
he goes on the warpath, so we must make
it evident, unless we are false to our own
traditions and to the demand's of civiliza
tion and humanity, that while we will do
eyerything in our power for the Filipino
who is peaceful, we will take the sternest
measures with the Filipino who follows the
path of the insurrecto and the ladrone.
The heartiest praise is due to large num
bers of the natives of the islands for their
steadfast loyalty. ne Macabebes have
been conspicuous for their courage and de
votion to me flag. The president recom
mends that the secretary of war be em
powered to take some systematic action in
the way of aiding those of these men who
are crippled in the service and the families
of those who are killed.
The vast natural wealth of the islands
must be developed, and the capital willing
to develop it must be given ttse opportuni
ty. The field must be thrown open to in
dividual enterprise, which has been the real
factor in the development of every region
over which our flag has flown. It is ur
gently necessary to enact suitable laws
dealing with general transportation, min
ing, banking, currency, homesteads, and
the nse and ownership of the lands and
timber.
Attention is called to the eed of a cable

tinued from the Philippian to points in

FOR AN ISTHMIAN CANAL.
No single great material work which re
mains to be undertaken on this continent
is of such consequence to the American
people as the building of a canal across the
isthmus connecting North and South Arne;
ica. Its importance to the nation, is by no
means limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity; and yet
with view to these effects alone it would
he to the last degree important for us im
mediately to begin it. While its beneficial
effects would perhaps be most marked upon
the Pacific coast and the gulf and South
Atlantic states. It would also greatly benefit
other sections. It is emphatically a work
which it is for the interest of the entire
country to begin and complete as soon as
possible: it is one of those great works
which only a great nation can undertake
with prospects of success, and which when
done are not only permanent assets in the
nation's material interests, but standing
monuments to its constructive ability. The
president is glad to be able to announce
that our neaotiations on this subject with
Great Britain have resulted ii; a treaty
which if ratified will enable us to begin
preparations for an isthmian canal at any
time, and which guarantees to thi- nation
every right that it has ever asked in con
nection with tut canal. In this treaty, the
old Clayton-Buiwer treaty, .so long recog
nized as inadequate to supply the base for
the construction and maintenance of a nec
essarily American ship canal. Is abrogated.
It specifically provides that the United
States alone shall do the work of build
ing and assume the responsibility of safe
guarding the canal and shall regulate its
neutral use by all nations on terms of i
equality without the guaranty or interfer- i
enee of anv outside nation from any quar- ]
ter. The signed treaty will at once be laid ]
before the senate, and if approved the con- j
gross can then proceed to give effect to the
advantages it secures us by providing for
the building of the canal.
THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
The Monroe doctrine should be the cardi
nal feature of the foreign policy of all the
nations of the two Americas, as it is of
the United States. The Monroe doctrine is
a declaration tha ; there must be no ter
ritorial aggrandizement by any non-Ameri
can power at the expense of any American
power on American soil. It is in no wise
intended as hostile to any nation in the
old world. Still less is it intended to give
cover to any aggression by one new world
power at the expense of any other. It is
simply a step, and a long step, toward as
suring the universal peace of the world by
securing the possibility of permanent peace
on this hemisphere.
NAVY UPBUILDING.
The work of upbuilding the navy must be
steadily continued. No one point of onr pol
icy, foreign or domestic, is more important
than this to the honor and material wel
fare. and above all to tne peace, of our
nation in the future. Inasmuch as the
American people have no thought of aban
doning the path upon which they have
entered, and especially in view of the fact
that the building of the isthmian canal is
fast becoming one of the matters which the
whole people are united in demanding, it is
imperative that our navy should be put and
kept in the highest state of efficiency, and
should be made to answer to onr growing
needs. So far from being in any way a
provocation to war. an adequate and highly
trained navy is the best guaranty against
war, the cheapest and best peace insur
ance. Our people intend to .abide by the
| Monroe doctrine and to insist upon it as
! the one sure means of securing the peace
of the western hemisphere. The navy of
fers us the only means of making our in
sistence upon the Monroe doctrine any
thing but a subject of derision to whatever
nation chooses to regard it. We desire the
peace which comes as of right to the Just
man armed; not the peace granted on
terms of ignominy to the craven and the
weakling. At very great length the presi
dent discusses the need of a stronger
navy.
The naval militia forces are state organ
izations, and are trained for coast service,
and in event of war they will constitute the
inner line of defense. They should receive
hearty encouragement from the general
government. But in addition we shovrld at
once provide for a national naval reserve,
organized and trained under the direction
of the navy department, and subject to the
call of the chief executive whenever war
becomes imminent. It should be a real aux
iliary to the naval sea-going peace estab
lishment, and offer material to be drawn
on at once for manning our ships in time
of war. It should be composed of gradu
ates of the naval militia, officers and
crews of coast-line steamers, longshore
schooners, fishing vessels and steam yachts,
together with the coast population about
such centers as life-saving stations and
light-houses.
The American people must either build
and’ maintain an adequate navy or else
make up their minds definitely to accept a
secondary position in international affairs,
not merely In political, but In commercial
matters, it has h"en well said that 'there
is no surer way of courting national dis
aster than to be “opulent, aggressive, and
unarmed.”
ARMY BIG ENOUGH.
It is not necessary to increase our army
beyond its present size at this time. But it
is necessary to keep it at the highest point
of efficiency. The conditions of modern war
are such as to make an infinitely heavier
demand than ever before upon the indi
vidual character and capacity of the officer
and the enlisted man, and to make it far
more difficult for men to act together with
effect. At present the fighting must he
done in extended order, which means that
: each man must act for himself and at the
: same time act in combination with others’
with whom he is no longer in the old
fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under
such conditions a few men of the highest
excellence are worth more than many men
without the special skill which is only
found as tue result of special training ap
plied to men of exceptional physique and
morale. But nowadays the most valuable
lighting man and the most difficult to per
fect is the rtOrman who is also a skillful
and daring rider.
A general staff should be created. As
for the present staff and supply depart
•inents, they should be filled by details from
the line, the men so detailed returning after
awhile to their line duties. It is very un
desirable to have the senior gx-ades of the
array composed of men who have come to
fill the positions by the mere fact of
seniority. A system shoirkl be adopted by
which there shall be an elimination grade
by grade of those who seem unfit to render
the best service in the next gratTe. Justice
to the veterans of the civil war who ax-e
still in the army would seem to require that
in the matter of retii-ements they be given
by law the sa* ie priviliges accorded to their
comrades in the navy. The process of
elimination of the least fit should be con
ducted in a manner that would render it
practically Impossible to apply political ox
social pressure on behalf of any candidate,
so that each man may be judged purely on
his own merits. Pressure for the promotion
of civil officials for political reasons is bail
enough, but It is tenfold worse where ap
plied on behalf of officers of the army or
navy. Every promotion and every detail
under the war department must be made
solely with regard to the good of the ser
vice and to the capacity and merit of the
man himself. No pressure, political, social,
or personal, of any kind, will be permitted
to exercise the least effect in any question
of promotion or detail; and if there is
reason to believe that such pressure is ex
ercised at the instigation of the officer con
cerned, it will be held to militate against
him. In oxxr army we cannot afford to have
rewards or duties distributed save that on
the simple ground that those who by their
own merits are entitled to the rewards get
them, and that those who are peculiarly fit
to do the duties are chosen to pel-form
them.
The congress should provide menus where
by it will be possible to have field exer
cises by at least a division of regulars, aud
if possible also a division of national
guardsmen, once a year. These exercises
might take the form of field manoeuvres:
or. if on the gulf coast or the Pacific or
Atlantic seaboard, or in the region of the
great lakes, the army corps when assem
bled could be marched from some inland
point to some point on the water,
there embarked, disembarked after a
couple of days' journey at some other
point, and again marched inland. Only
by actual handling and providing
for men in masses while they are
marching, camping, embarking, and disem
barking, will it be possible to train the
h ! gher officers to perform their duties well
and smoothly.
Much good has already come from the act
reorganizing the army, passed early in the
present year. The three prime reforms, all
of them of inestimable value, are, first, the
substitution of four-year details from the
line for permanent appointments in the so
called staff divisions; second, the establish
ment of a corps of artillery with a chief at
the head; third, the establishment of a
maximum and minimum limit for the army.
It would be difficult to overestimate the
improvement in the efficiency of our army
which these three reforms are making, and
have in part already effected. The reor
ganization provided for by the act has been
substantlalfy accomplished. Thorough mil
itarv education must be provided, and in
addition to the regulars the advantages of
M;is education should be given to the offi
cVr?. the national guard and others in
• )mI life who desire intelligently to fit
' ; 'uselves for possible military dutv. Th
otucers should be given the chance'to pc--
teet themselves by study in the higher
branches of this art. At u. =■*• ivri ; ifi,.
education should be of the- kind most apt t,.
turn out men who are good in actual field
service: too much stress should not bo laid
on mathematics, nor should proflclencv
therein he held to establish the ri-ffit of
entry to a corps d’elite. The tvpieal
American officer of the best kind need not
be a good mathematician: but he must be
aide to master himself, to control others
and to show boldness and fertility of re
source in every emergent-.*. The organize
non and armament of the national guard of
the_ several states, which are treated as
militia in the appropriations by congress
should be made identical with' those" pro
vided for the regular forces.
MERIT SYSTEM.
The merit system of making appoint
ments is in its essence as democratic and
American as the common school system it
self. It simply means that in clerical and
other positions where the duties are en
tirely non-political, all applicants should
have a fair field and no favor, each stand
ing on his merits as he is able to show
them by practical test. Written competi
tive examinations offer the only available
moans in many cases for applying this svs
rom. In other cases, as where laborers are
employed, a system of registration un
doubtedly can he widely extended. There
are, of course, places where the written
competitive examination cannot be applied,
and others where it offers by no means an
ideal solution, but where under exist lug po
litical conditions it is. though an imperfect
means, yet the best present means of get
ting satisfactory results. Wherever the
conditions have permitted the application
of the merit system in its fullest and
widest sense, the gain to the government
has been immense. The navy yards and
postal service illustrate, probably better
■ than any other branches of the govern
ment, the great gain in economy, efficiency
and honesty due to the enforcement of this
principle. The passage of a law which will
extend the classified service to the District
of Columbia is recommended. Not an of
fice should be filled in The Philippines' or
Porto Rico with any regard to the man’s
partisan affiliations or services, with any re
gard to the political, social, or personal in
fluence which he may have at his com
mand: in short, heed should he paid to ab
solutely nothing save the man’s own char
acter and capacity and the needs of the
service.
CONSULAR REFORMS.
The guardianship and fostering of our
rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the
protection of American citizens resorting to
foreign countries in lawful pursuit of their
affairs, and the maintenance of the dignity
of the nation abroad, combine to make it
essential that our consuls should be men
of character, knowledge and enterprise. It
is true that the service is now, in the main,
efficient, but a standard of excellence can
not be permanently maintained until the
principles set forth in the bills heretofore
submitted to the congress on this subject
are enacted into law.
In the president’s judgment the time has
arrived when we should definitely make up
our minds to recognize the Indian as an
individual and not as a member of a tribe.
We should now break up the tribal feuds,
doing for them what allotment does for the
tribal lands; that is, they should be di
vided into individual holdings. A stop
should be put upon the indiscriminate per
mission to Indians to lease their allot
ments. The effort should be steadily to
make the Indian work like any other "man
on his own ground. The marriage laws of
the Indians should be made the same as
those of the whites. In the schools the
education should be elementary and largely
industrial. There is no use in attempting
to Induce agriculture in a country suited
only for cattle raising, where the Indian
should be made a stock grower. The ration
system, which is merely the corral and tlje
reservation system. Is highly detrimental to
the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpet
uates pauperism, and stifles industry. It
is an effectual barrier to progress. The In
dian should be treated as an individual—
like the white man.
Commendation is accorded the St. Louis
and Charleston expositions.
LIBRARIES.
Perhaps the most characteristic educa
tional movement of the past fifty years Is
that which has created the modern public
library and developed it into broad and ac
tive service. There are now over 5,000 pub
lic libraries In the Unitdd States, the prod
uct of this period. In addition to accuruu
fitting material, they are also striving by
organization, by improvement in method,
and by co-operation, to give greater effi
ci-cncy to the material they hold, to make
it more widely useful, and by avoidance of
unnecessary duplication l in process to re
duce cost of its administration. In these
efforts they naturally look for assistance to
the federal library.
For the sake of good administration,
Sound economy, and the advancement of
science, the census office as now constituted
should be made a permanent government
bureau.
POSTAL A. BUSES.
The full measure of postal progress which
might be realized has long been hampered
and obstructed by the heavy burden im
posed on the government through the in
trenched and well-understood abuses which
have grown up in connection with second
class mail matter. The extent of this bur
den appears when It is stated that while
the second-class matter makes nearly three
tifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid
for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 <>f the
aggregate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If
the pound rate of postage, which produces
the large loss thus entailed, and which was
fixed by congress with the purpose of en
couraging the dissemination of public in
formation, were limited to the legitimate
newspapers and periodicals’ actually con
templated by the law, no exception could
be taken. That expense would be the rec
ognized and accepted cost of a liberal pol
icy deliberately adopted for a justifiable
end. But much of the matter which enjoys
the privileged rate is wholly outside of the
intent of the law, and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of its require
ments or through lax construction. The
proportion of such wrongly included matter
is estimated by postal experts to be one
half of the whole volume of second-class
mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter
the maguitiide of the burden is apparent.
The postoffice department has now under
taken to remove the abuses so far as pos
sible by a stricter application of the law;
ana it should be sustained in its effort.
In conclusion the presiaent alludes to the
settlement of the troubles in China.
