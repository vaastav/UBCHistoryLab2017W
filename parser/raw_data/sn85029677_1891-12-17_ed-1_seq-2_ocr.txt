From Central and Soutn America.
Citt or Maxico. December 9. The follow
ing are the latest advices from Central and
South American nations:
Guatemala. The financial condition here
ia still bad. The election excitement is still
increasing and there is much speculation as
to who will be the dark' horse candidate for
the presidency that is expected to be brought
by President Barriilaa at the last moment.
So far there is no revolution in sight, but it
is apprehended that there will be one before
the next president takes his seat,
San Salvador. The minister of finance is
preparing a plan to raise funds, which are
very much needed. The people in general
oppose any loan abroad ana should one be
arranged it would probably lead to a revolu
tion. Any party to triumph here must re
pudiate foreign debts, particularly if a loan
were raised by Spaniards in Paris.
San Jose, Coeta Rica. The country ia per
fectly ouiet and will not be drawn intn th
difficulties of neighbonng nations. Money
ia scarce, due tne croos will oe larger than
usual this year, as more extensive plnnting

commence preparing its exhibit for the Chi
cago fair.
Managua, Nicaragua. There is a more

of the Nicaragua canal, as the United States
haa now seen its importance, in case of war

Nicaragua is suffering financial deDrassion.
the same as her neighbors, bat with the com
mencement ox active work on the canal times
re expected to become brighter.
Honduras Tha opposition to Seivsa. tha
newly elected president, is becoming more
and more pronounced daily. There is but
little money in the treasury, crops are par
tially abandoned and smallpox and typhus
fever are causing great suffering among the
people.
Panama. Business is almost dead hare:
sickness is paramount. Most of the few
merchants remaining are preparing to more,
as nearly everybody has lost or is losing faith
in any improvement.
Lima, Feru. It is rumored here that in
case of war with Chili the United Stat
vould support Peru, and that it would be
easy to loria an alliance with Bolivia.
Justloe Brewer's Deolslon.
W abh moron, D. C, December 9. A case
of considerable interest to railroad trainmen
who have to deal with unruly passengers,
was decided in the United States supreme
court.
James J ODes. a nasaenirer on tha K i w.-
leans A Northeastern, became engaged in a
auarml with the conductor of the train, who
hot and seriously injured him. Jopes sued
the railroad company for damages. The
testimony as to the circumstances of the
mooting was conflicting. The railroad com.
pany asked that the jury be instructed that
uT, from the manner and attitude of tha pas
tenger, the conductor had reason to fear as
lauit, and shot under the belief that he was
A imminent danger of personal injury, that
company is -not responsible, the court
lenied this request, and Jopes obtained judg
ment for $7.bux This court, in the opinion
( J ustice Brewer, holds that the court below
was in error in refusing to charge the jury as
requested, reverses its decision and airects
that the case be sent back to the Mississippi
rourt which tried it.
The Heating of the Senate.
'Washington. 1 C, December 9. -The
ruckle plates with the engraved names of the
senators thereon were attached to the desks
Saturday. As a rule the new senators have
to take back seats or end ones at the extreme
right or left ot the chair.
The assignments mads settle the party
status of Senators Peffer and Kyle, aboat
which there has been doubt. Senator Peffer
will occupy the seat next to the wall on the
third row of the republican side, where Sen
ator Allen used to sit, the last named gentle
man having secured Senator farwell'a old
seat in the middle of the row.
At the end of the second row is Senator
Clifton, appointed to succeed Senator Rea
gan, whose seat at the head of the first row
is to be tilled by hen a tor Colquitt.
Next to Chilton comes Irby, and back of
them will be Senator Gibson, of Maryland.
Senator Kyle will ait between Senators Ciib
on and Gordon.
A Grand Jury Imprisoned.
Bah Aktohio, Tax., December 10. Con
liderabla excitement was produced here by
the arrest of the grand jury. They were
taken to the county jail and placed in con
finement. There is a fine of 50 hanging
over each member, which waa imposed by
fudge King, of the Forty-fifth district court,
who held that they were in contempt in serv
ing an attachment on him while he was on
the bench. Attorney Franklin, acting in
their behalf, has left for Tyler with a petition
to the supreme court for a writ of habeas
corpus. The beat informed lawyers in this
section say the action of Judge King is in
dorsed. They say the grand jury had no right to
summon a judge on the bench to appear as a
malefactor, and the jurymen should he in
jad until they rot or pay their tinea. The
town is on tire, and there haa been much talk
by tho friends of the grand jurymen, who
say they will be released if the county prison
is torn down brick by brick.
Convention Postponed.
Washikotoh, D. C, December 10. Chair
man McAllister issued the following: "To
members of the anti-sub-treasury alliance:
In obedience to nrgent requests from many
members of the anti sub-treasury alliance,
the national convention called to meet at
Memphis, December 16, is hereby postponed
to adate which will hereafter be named."
The reason fur this action is given by Mr.
McAllister in an interview. "W hen our coll
was issued,' he said, a4tne supreme council
had taken no action on the third party ques
tion. Subsequently it appointed twenty-five
delegates to the third party conference set
for ir ebruary 2, at at. Jouia. otwithstand-
ing this action, the national alliance leaders
deny that it is their purpose to turn the farm
ers' alliance into a political party. The re
sult of the at. .Louis conference will deter
mine the real purpose, and hence the pro
priety of postponing our national conven
tion."
Peffer Will Not Mix.
VY asbis otom, D. C., December 9. As to
his affiliation with, other parties Senator Pef
fer said: "I have no sort of intention of
mixing with the parties in such a way as to
be regarded as a partisan in any sense. My
course in relation to poblic measures will de
pend altogether upon their character, w i Lo
ci I releience to tfteir origin. 1 will favor an
increase of money no matter who proposes
it- 1 will favor a inodihcetiou of the tariff
schedules and any measure which would
give relief to the working classes, without re
gard to who presents it. I belieie the inter
ests of the people ougnt to be served inde
pendently of sul parUsan considerations and
will vote with the party tnat presents tne
best measure upon any particular subject-'"
IxoiAssj-oua, December 10. Chief Jus- I
lice Elliott, of the Indiana supreme court,
handed down a decision, the other justices
concurring, in which it is decided that the
wife has a perfect right to sue for damaf
Sirajnat any one who alienates her husband s
a'Ssutitfbsr This, ia ccoU? to 4 WSHica
law and the usual custom of the country,
man alone being accorded tiie prerogative of

love- The case dev'ided was an appeal from
thScJrcmt ctmrt of Dearborn county, wherein
the judge knocked out a salt for $l'5,tiu0

ing the latter with taxing away her husband
from her, and the court bed, on demurrer,
I that the plaintirf had no rouuds fur action.
Soul and Body.
BasLis, December la The silence of the
Reichsanzeiger, which is a government or
gan, in regard to the emperor's supposed
speech to recruits at Pottsdain, in which he
is alleged to have said tho soldiers belonged
to him, body and soul, is taken to con
firm the truth of the report, which first
appeared in an obscure paper, the Neissea
Press. The scmi-officinl papers at first
vaguely asserted that the words of the em
peror had been distorted. Now, the ultra
conservative papers defend the imperial lan
guage as expressing the extent of allegiance
Bold lers owe the em peror througn their oaths.
Apart from the ultra conservatives, general
anxiety is expressed because of the despotic
tendency shown by the ein peror in his recent
utterances. The liberal organs demand that
a public denial be made of the words attri
buted to his msjesty.
Those Abandoned Farms.
Boston, December 10. The long expected
report of the state board of agriculture oh
the abandoned, or partially abandoned farms
in the commonwealth is in priut. It was a
! document of 104 pages and very interesting
la many ways. It appears that returns were
i received by the board of agriculture showing
I that there were !ot such farms. The num
ber of owners making reply to inquiries of
the board were 547, and iS: descriptions of
, abandoned farms were received. There were
147 who reported this kind of farms, but did
not wish to sell, 'lhere were forty-one who
reported such farms sold, and tliirty-one re
ported that the assessors who returned their
farms ss abadMoned were misinformed. Al
together the board concludes that farming in
Massachusetts is not on the decline.
Hyan lens or Mexican Tariff s.
Tofxxa, December 9. Hon. Thomas Ryan,
minister to Mexico, while here on his way
from Washington to his post, speaking of
the country whose trade the United States ia
seeking, said that Mexico itself stands so
much in need of tariff revenue that it is una.
ble now to agree to terms of full commercial
reciprocity. A special agreement should be
msde by which such articles as make the two
countries mutually dependent upon each
other may be interchanged without reetriiS
tions. Dispatches that Mexico will remove
the tariff from grains and live stock are mis
leading. 1 he duties will be removed only as
to provinces suffering from wans. Mexico
will make a great exhibit at the world's fair.
Mozart's Centennial.
Chicago. December 10. It ia just 100 years
ago since Mozart, the eminent German com
poser, breathed his last in Vienna, but, al

commemorated by a grand commemorative
operatic performance at the Auditorium.

and Mine. Lili Lehman, with Herrs Kali sc-h,
Kdouard De Reszke and Signor Sorboliniz,

tary Foster wrote the following letter to Mrs.
William Wlndom a few days ago: "It affords
me sincere pleasure to present to you the
first silver certificate bearing the likeness of
your illustrious husband, the late William
VVindom, secretary of the treasury. Few of
our public men who have been similarly hon
ored have done more to deserve this particu
lar mark of recognition from the govern
ment, aud as bis successor in office I feel
that it is fitting to testify in this manner my
official acknowledgment of the obligations
due to his distinguished services."

Kenrick, the archbishops and clergy gener
ally have held a secret meeting, at which
calls from several sections for new sees were

Nebraska and other northwest points.

At a cabinet meeting it was decided that

ship, should announce to the deputies that
the government intends to keep tne bishops
and clergy within the limits of their functions,

Customs Revenue Reduced and
Free List En largred Duties so Ad
justed as to Have Regard to the
Interests of Our Own People.
Wasbotos, D. C-, December 11. "Under
the operations of the new tariff the customs
revenue has been decreased as far as ia con
sistent with the current heeds of the govern
ment by the readjustment of duties in the
line Of protection to American labor and
American industries, the free list has been
enlarged by the addition of articles which,
from climatic or other conditions, are not
produced profitably or extensively in this
country; adeauate protective duties have
been imposed upon articles which come in
competition with our own productions; new
industries have been established and others
stimulated, thereby giving increased employ
ment to American labor and better control
of our home market to our own ceoplet and
the price of nearly every article of common
consumption has been reduced to the con
sumer. Inasmuch ss a considerable portion
of our revenues must be derived from duties
on .imports, it is the part ef wisdom and
patnoti-m to so adjust the rates as to have
regard first, to the interests of our own peo
ple and the rightful demands of American
labor for remunerative wages. I do not be
lieve that any considerable number of the
people desire to see onr manufacturing in
dustries destroyed or wages reduced to the
European basis, which would be the inevita
ble result of the reduction of the duties with
a view to revenue only. A comparison of
the prices of goods imported respectively
Under the old and new tariffs, wnere rates
have been increased, will demonstrate that
the tariff is a tax upon toe foreign competi
tor in our markets in the sale of such articles
as are exteusively produced here, and that
the duties are in fact thus productive if de
ducted from the foreign market value, and
are paid by the foreigner as a tax for the
privilege of selling his goods here."
MORS OF THE MESSAGE.
Election Reforms Discussed.
The president's message coutains tho fol
lowing sectional
KUCTIOS REFORMS.
Nothing just now is more important than
to provide every guaranty for the absolutely
fair and free choice by an equal suffrage
within the respective states of all the officers
of the national government, whether that
suffrage is applied directly as in the choice of
members of rexresentatives, or indirectly as
in the choice of senators and electors of
president. Respect for public officers and
obedience to tho law will not cease to be
the characteristics of our people until our
elections cease to declare the will of majori
ties fairly ascertained without fraud, sup
pression or gerrymander.
If I were called upon to declare wherein
our chief national danger lies 1 should say
without hesitation, in the overthrow of ma
jority control by the suppression or iierver
sion of the popular suffrage. That there is a
real danger here all must agree. But the en
ergies of those who see it have been chielly
expended in trying to fix responsibility upon
the opposite party, rather than in efforts to

Is it not possible now to adjourn that in
terminable and inconclusive debate while we
take, by consent, one step in the direction of
reform by eliminating the gerrymander
which has been denuuuccJ by all purties as
au influence in the election of electors of
president and members of congress?
All the states have, acting freely and sepa

by a general ticket is the wisest and safest
method, anil it would seem there could be
no objection to a constitutional aim cd merit

D.LSGEKS OF IUE GEKUTMANDEU.
I have alluded to the "Gerrymander" as
affecting the method of selecting electors of
president by congressional districts, but the
primary intent and effect of this form of
political robbery liave relation to trie selec
tion of members of the house of representa
tives, 'lhe power of congress is ample to
deal with this threatening aud intolerable
abu-e. Tne unfailing test of sincerity in
election reform wilt be found in a willing
ness to confer as to remedies and to put into
force such measures as will uiost effectually
preserve the right of the people to free aud
equal representation.
An attempt was made last congress to
bring to bear the constitutional powers of
the general government for the correction
of frauds against the suffrage. It is imior
tant to know whether the opposition to such
measures is ready rested in particular fea
tures, supposed to be objectionable, or in
cludes any proposition to give to the election
laws of the United States adequacy to the
correction of grave and acxnuwledged
evils. 1 must yet entertain the hope that it
ia possible to secure a calm, patriotic consid
eration of such constitutional or statutory
changes as may be necessary to secure the
choice of the officers of toe government to
the people by fair apportionment and free
elections.
I believe it would be possible to constitute
a commission, non-partisan in its member
ship, and composed of patriotic, wise and
impartial men, to whom a consideration of
the questions of the evils connected with our
election system and methods might be com
mitted with a good prospect of securing
unanimity in some plan for removing or
mitigating those evils. The constitution
would permit the selection of the commission
to be vested in the supreme court, if that
method would give the best guaranty of itn
paMiality. This commission should be charged with
the duty of inquiring into the subject of the
law of elections as related to the choice bf
officers of the national government, with a
view to securing to every elector a free and
unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as
near an approach to an equality of value in
each ballot cast as is attainable.
TBI Ql'BsTIOJt OF St'FFBAGB.
While the policies of the general govern
ment upon the tariff, upon the restoration of
our merchant marine, upon the river and
harbor improvements and other such matters
of grave- and general concern are liable to
be turned this way or that by the results of
congressional elections and ministrative pol
icies, sometimes involving issues that tend to
peace or war, to be turned this way or ih it
by the results of a presidential election, there
is a rightful interest in ail the states and in
every congressional district that Will not be
deceived or silenced by the audacious pre
tense that the question of the right of any
body of legal voters in any state or in any
congressional district to give their suffrages
freely upon these general questions is a mat
ter only of local concern or control. 1 he
demand that the limitations of suffrage shall
be found in the law, and only there, is a just
detnaud, and no just man should resent or
resist lU My appeal is, and must continue
to be, for a consultation that shall 'proceed
with candor, calmness and patience upon
the lines of justice and humanity, not by
prejudice and cruelty."
To the consideration of these very grave
questions I invite not only the attention of
congress, but that of all patriotic citizens.
We must not en'iertain the delusion that our
people have ceased to regard a free ballot
and equal representation as the price of their
allegiance to laws and to civil magistrates.
I have been greatly rejoiced to notice many
evidences of the increased unification of our
people and of a revived national spirit. The
vista that now opens to us is wider and more
glorious than ever before. Gratification and
amazement struggle for supremacy as we
contemplate the population, wealth and
moral strength of our country. A trust, mo
mentous in its influence upon our people
and upon the world, is for a brief time com
mitted to us, and we must not be faithless to
its first condition the defense of the free
and equal influence of the people in the
choice of public officers and in the control of
publio affairs.
Kansas In the Senate.
WAjuuitaTOS. D. C, December 12. During
the first work under introduction of business
in the senate the Kansas senators offered
these:
Peffer offered a resolution which was re
ferred to tha finance committee, directing
that committee to inquire and report as soon
as practicable as to the actual expenses at
tending the business of money lending, as
conducted in the Lnited States, by bankers
and other persons ( both as to snort loans and
long loans i, the object being, as he declared
in the resolution, to ascertain approximately
the actual and relative cost of conducting the
business of lending money without reference
to tne value of ths amouut loaned.
Peffer offered bills:
To amend the immiirration aud naturaliz

additional amounts to prisoners of wan to

- Plumb offered, a resolution declaring that
"congress desired the removal of the re
mains of the illustrious soldier and states
man, General Grant, to, and therein interred
in the Arlington national cemetery, and that
the president be requested to convey to the
widow of that lamented man. such desire.
tendering to her, on the part of the nation,
all necessary facilities for such removal and
interment." The resolution was laid on the
table. Plumb giving notice that he would
call it up at at a convenient time.
Plumb offered bills:
To provide for the free coinage of silver
ana tne promotion ox international free coin
age of silver.
To provide for the retirement of national
bank notes and tha, free coinage of silvar.
This is the same bill introduced in the senate
by Plumb last year, with a few amendments
increasing from 20 to .-10 per cent, the gold
and silver reserve fund for the redemption of
United States notes; forbicding free coinage
in the United States of foreign coin, and au
thorizing the secretary of the treasu ry , in
his discretion, to call for the payment of
customs duties in gold or silver, in whole or
in part.
What They Say;
Losdox; December 12. The St James
Gazette says: "It's most important point Is
that which refers to tha tariff. The argu
ment presented compares significantly with
British figures, which show a stationary con
dition of trade. It is all well to say that
Americans will presently discover the mis
take in the fiscal policy, but perhaps they
may nob In tne meantime the calculations
tf the supporters of the Mckinley bill are
working out much better than any one in
England had reason to expect."
Sew Yobk. The Recorder says the mes
sage is American throughout. It is a com
prehensive statement of an executive well
informed as to the relations of our country
with others and always just regarding them,
but who considers every topic, first of all
with absolute devotion to the interests of the
people of the United States, and particularly
of the great mass of population who are wage
earners. The document cannot fail to in
crease the respect of tlie world for the Amer
ican peop'e's institutions and firmness and
dignity which they are considered.
The Tribune says the one characteristic of
the message which must impress every cah
did reader is its absolute freedom from par
tisanship or prejudice. There is in it no
straining for effect. It is a simple, clear
and businesslike statement of public affairs,
full of practical suggestions.
The Press says the message is a thoroughly
American document, in every line of which
spirit and patriotic desire for the public wel
fare is clearly expressed.
A Son of Joaquin Miller.
Sas Fa an Cisco, Cai, December 11. Jo
seph McKay, who is in jail at Ukiah, Cal.,
charged with stage robbery, has been found
to be the son of Joaquin Miller, the "Poet of
the Sierras." The real name of the young
man is Harry Miller. He is 22 years of aire
and the son of the poet by the tatter's first
wife, Minnie Myrtle. Un November 15 the
Ukiah aud Eureka staze was held up nine
teen miles from Ukiah by a masked man.
armed with a rifle. Charles Lambert, the
stage driver, upon reaching Ukiah, told the
sheriff and the latter started on the trail. He
found the empty treasure box and learned
that a farm house in the vicinity of Wiiletts'
villAge had been robbed a few aays previ
ously of a rifle and other articles similar to
those in posession of the masked man who
stopped the stage The sheriff followed to
Hojieland, fourteen miles suth of Ukiah,
and there learned that Miller had been cut
ting wood for a man named Willard, and
had left Willard's four days prior to the 6tage
robbery and returned there a few days after
the robbery. After obtaining his mail Miller
again disappeared. Tho sheriff followed the
fugitive to Santa Rosa and arrested him at a
hotel there. In relating the story, the sheriff
said that Miller, after considerable persua
sion, confessed and took tie sheriff to the
place where the rifle and ax had been buned.
Miller says his life might have been differ
ent, but he never was encouraged to go to
school or make anything of himself.
Safety in the Railroad Service.
Washington, D. C, December 1L The
following is taken from the president's mes
sage:
I have twice before urgently called the at
tention of congress to the necessity of legis
lation for the protection of the lives of rail
road employes, but nuthiug has vet been
done. During the yearenuing Jnue 30, 1'J0,
3i)9 Lrakemcn were killed and 7,811 maimed
while engaged in connling cars, lhe total
number of railroad employes killed during
the year was 3,41 and the number injured
z.i,o;). iius is a cruel and largely a needless
sacri tioe. The government is spending nearly
1,iaai,u-ju annually to save the lives ot snip-
wrecked seamen; every steam vessel is rig
idly insiiectctl and required to adopt the
most approved pafety appliances. All this is
good, but how shall we excuse the lack of in
terest and effort in lhalf or this army of
brave youug men who in our land commerce
are being sacrificed every year by tho con
tinued use of antiquated and dangerous ap
pliances. A law requiring of every railroad
engaged in interstate commerce the equip
ment, eacn year, ot a given per cent or its
ght cars witn automatic couplers, ana air
breaks and couplers to be used, would very
soon aud very greatly reduce the present
fearful death rate among railroad employes.
Depredating Chinim?n.
Saltillo, Met., December 1L The 1,200
Chinese who were thrown out of employ
ment by the collapse of the Tehuantepec rail
way project are makiug their way in a body
towards the United States, pillaging and
committing depredations in the country
tnrouga winch they pass. All are in a desti
tute condition and are unable to find em
ployment. Itiey were imported into Mexico under
contract to work on the railway, and owing
to the failure of that enterprise the con
tractors were heavy losers at the hands of
nalvador Malo, the promoter of the scueme,
who is now in London. Fuiflaud. and the
Chinese were suddenly thrown out of work
with no money upon which to live.
ReDubllcan Caucus.
Washington, D. C, December 1L The
caucus committee of republican senators will
be gnided in its work by the well established
practice of promoting to the chairmanships,
where vacancies exists, the senior senator in
point of service.
lhe commute assumed a task oi greater
magnitude than usual in such cases. Serious
inroads have been made by deatn, resigna
tion au J failure in the ranks of the senate as
it stood at the close of the fc'ifty-first con
gress. In the forty-two standing and thir
teen select committees there are not less than
enty-two vacancies, including six chair
manships in the list of standing committees
and one in the list of select committees.
More About Iowa Coal.
Mason Citt, Ia., December 1L O. D.
Bucheker, a large owner of mining interests
in Illinois, and a wholesale deaier whose
business covers much of Iowa, said there
was not a week's supply of coal in the hands
of dealers in Iowa, Dakota, Minnesota, Illi
nois, Kansas or Nebraska. The miners are
working on half time, because of the scarcity
of cars. The situation is not due to the neg
ligence of the roads, but to the development
of the west and the su Iden demands for coal
caused by cold weather at a time when the
cars are loaded with grain. All that part of
the west mentioned is in immediate danger
of a serious coal famine.
Three Million Acres More.
Washington, D. G, December 11. The
president said to a visiting delegation that
be wanted the Cheyenne and Arapahoe lands
opened to settlement as quickly as possible.
All that is necessary is ine aiiovuieui 10 uie
Indians, and the president said he would is
sue a proclamation immediately after the
allotment is completed.
Springer will introduce an emergency bill
for an appropriation to go on with the allot
ment. There is no douot but that the lands will
be opened in ninety days. There are over
3,UUO,UUO acres.
German Sugar.
Washington, D. G, December lL While
it is impossible to obtain an official acknowl
edgement to that effect, it is known that a
commercial convention under the reciprocity
clause of the McKinley act has been practi
cally concluded between Germany and the
United States and that the president will
soon issue a proclamation announcing the
fact.
The convention contemplates the fres im
portation of German sugar into the United
tales and the reduction of duty on Ameri
can cereals imported iuto Germany from 5
to oj-j marks.
Reckless Franchise Giving.
Washington, D. C, December 1L Presi
dent Harrison's message has this paragraph:
The indiscriminate granting of franchises
of enormous value, without recompense to

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate sad House of Representatives:
Tlie reports of the heads of the several ex
ecutive departments, required by law to be
) submitted to me, which are herewith trans
mitted, and toe reports oi tne secretary oi
the treasury and the attorney general made
directly to congress, furnish a comprehensive
view of the administrative work of the last
fiscal year relating to internal affairs. It
would be of great advantage if these reports
could have an attentive perusal by every
member of ton cress and by all who take Ba
interest in public affairs. Such a perusal
could hoi fail to excite a higher appreciation
of the vast labor and conscientious efforts
which are given to the conduct of our civil
administration.
The reports will, I believe, show that every
question has been approached, considered and
decided from the standpoint of public duty
and upon considerations affecting the public
interests alone. Again I invite to every
branch of the service the attention and scru
tiny of congress; r
The work of the state department during the
last year has been characterized by an unit,
lual number of important negotiations and
by diplomatic results of a notable and highly
beneficial character. Among these are the
reciprocal trade arrangemenis which have
been concluded, in the exercise bf tne powers
conferred by section 3 of the tariff law, with
the republic of brazil, with Spain, for its
West India possessions, and with San Do
mingo. Like negotiations with other coun
tries nave been much advanced, and it is
hoped that before the close of the year fur
ther definitive trade arrangements of great
value will be concluded.

THE KEW OHXXANS LYNCHING.
The president suggette the propriety of
legislation placing offences against the treaty
rights of foreigners within the jurisdiction of
the federal coorts.
THE TBOUBLE WITH CHILI.
During the civil war in Chili frequent in
direct appeals were made to this government
to extend belligerent rights to the insurgents
and to give audieDOe to t ieir representatives.
This was declined, and that policy was pur
sued throughout which this government,
when wrenched by civil war, so strenuously
insisted upon on the pait of Kuropeaa na
tions. With the overthrow of Balmaoeda many of
his counsellors and officers appealed for and
uw-nrMl uivlum for their lives on board for
eign shis of war and at the residences of
foreign ministers, tnose at tne unitea ataies
legation still so remaining. The message re
cites the incident of the slaughter of Ameri
can seamen at Valparaiso and the action of
this government theieou; a matter, it is sug
ir,.t..,l that is likelv to call for a special mes
sage when official correspondence reaches a
proper stage.
CHINA.
No effort will be omitted to protect our
citizens peaceably sojourning in China, but
recent unofficial information indioates that
what was at first regarded as an outbreak of
mob violence against foreigners has assumed
the larger form of an insurrection against
public order.
'lhe Chinese government; uas oecuneu to
receive Mr. Blair as tlie minister of the
United States on the i? round that, as a par
ticipant while a senator in the enactment of
the existing legislation against the introduc
tion of Chinese laborers, he bos become un
friendly and objectionable to China. 1 have
felt constrained to point out to the Chinese
government the untenableness of tins posi
tion, which seems to rest as mu ;h on the ac
ceptability of our legislation as on th'it of
the person chosen, and which, if admitted,
would practically debar the selection of any
representative so long as the existing laws
remain in force.
THE CZAB.
This government has found occasion to ex-
nraPK. in a friendly spirit, but with much
earnestness, to the government of the czar,
its serious concern because ot tue narsn
measures now being enforced against the
Hebrews in Russia. A accreo to leave one
country is, in the nature of things, an order
ta enter another some other. This con
sideration, as well as the suggestions of hu
manity, furnishes ample ground for the re
monstrance which we have presented to
Russia.
SANDWICH ISLAKDS.
Surveys for the much.nceded sub-marine
cable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu
are in progress, and this enterprise should
have the suitable promotion of the two gov
ernments. I strongly recommend that pro
vision be made for improving the harbor of
Pearl river aud equipping it as a naval sta
tion. THE NICABAGCAN CANAL.
The message at some length goes over the
vast benefits and savings to our people by
the completion of the jXicaraguan canal, and
recommends that its completion be aided by
the guaranty of the bonds of that enterprise
by this government. The president says: I
am quite willing to recommend government
promotion in the prosecution of a work
which, if no other means offered for its com
pletion, is of such trauscendant interest that
the government should, in my opinion, se
cure it by direct appropriations from its
treasury. I most sincerely hope that neither
party nor sectional lines will be drawn upon
this great American project, so full of inter
est to the people of all our states and su in
fluential in its effects upon the prestige and
prosperity of our common country.
1NTEU-CONTINENTAL BAIL WAYS.
Purveys for the connecting links of the
projected inter-continentul railway are in
progress, not only in Mexico, but at various
pointB along the course mapped out. Three
surveying parties are now in the field under
the direction of the commission. Nearly
1,000 miles of the proposed road have been
surveyed, including the most difficult part,
that through Ecuador, and the southern part
of Columbia. The reports of the engineers
are very satisfactory and show that no in
surmountable obstacles have been met with.
THE TAB IFF.
Barely, if ever before, in the history of the
country has there been a time when the pro
ceeds of one day's labor or the product of
one farmed acre would purchase so large an
amount of those things that enter into the
living of the masses of the people. I believe
that a full test will develop the fact that the
tariff act of the Fifty-first congress is very
favorable in its average effect upon the
pric-si of articles entering into common use.
There is certainly nothing in the condition
of trade, foreign or domestic, there is cer
tain' y nothing in the condition of our people
of any class to suggest that the existing tariff
and revenue legislation bears oppressively
upon the people or retards the commercial
development of the nation. It may be ar
gued that our condition wonld be better if
our tariff legislation were upon a free trade
basis; but it cannot be denied that all the
conditions of prosperity and of general
contentment are present in a larger degree
t tan ever before in oor history, and that,
too, just when it was prop heeled tliey would
be in the worst state. Agitation for radical
cbt n ,es in tariff and finanoial legislation
cannot help but may seriously impede busi
ness, to the prosperity of which some degree
of stability in legislation is essential.
I think there Bre conclusive evidences that
the new tariff has created several great indus
tries which will, within a few years, give em
ployment to several hundred thousand
American men and women. In view of the
somewhat overcrowded condition of the
labor market of the United States, every
patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a
resuit.
FBEE COINAGE.
I hope the depression in the price of silver
is temporary and that a further trial of ex
isting legislation will more favorably affect
it. That the increared volume of currency
thus supplied for the use of the people was
needed aud that beneficial results upon trade
and prices have followed tms legislation 1
thick mut be very clear to everyone; nor
should it be forgotten that for every dollar
of these notes issued a full dollar's
wo.th of sdver bullion is at the time de
posited in the treasury as a security for its
redemption. Upon this subject, as upon the
tariff, my recommendation is that the exist
ing laws be given a full trial and that our
business interests be spared the t istreseing

threats of radical changes

THE snti'H. 8.
The presence of a large cash surplus In the
treasury has for many years been the subject
oi mucn unfavorable criticism and has fur
nished an argument to those who have de
sired to place the tariff upon a purely reve
nue basis. It was agreed by all that tha with
drawal from circulation of so large an
amount of money was an embarrassment to
the business of the country and made neoes
sary the intervention of .thh department at
frequent intervals to relieve threatened mon
etary panics. The surplus on March 1, 1SS9,
was $liil,t27;190.2!J. The policy of applying
this surplus to the redemption of the interest
bearing securities of the United States was
thought to be preferable to that of deposit
ing it without interest in selected national
banks. There have been redeemed since the
date last mentioned of interest bearing se
curities $259,079,350, resulting in a reduction
ot tue annual interest charge of t ll,bsd.bia
The money which had been deposited., in
banks without interest has been gradually
withdrawn and'vaed in the redemption of
bonds.
THE IXlEUIOB DEPARTMENT:
The relations of the five civilized tribes
now occupying the Indian territory to the
United States; I believe, is not best calcu
lated to promote the highest advanoement of
these Indians. That there should be within
our borders five independent states, having
no relations except those growing out or
treaties with the government bf the United
States, no representation in the the nation's
legislature, its peoolo not citizens, is a start
ling anomaly. It seems to me to be inevita
ble that there shall be before lone some or
ganic changes in relation to these people to
the United States. hat form these changes
should take 1 do not think it desirable now
to suggest, even were they well denned in
my own mind.
1 he L'ood work of redueiner the larre? In
dian reservations by allotments in severalty
to trie Indians, ana the cession ot the re
maining lands to the United States for dispo
sition under the hoinesual law has been
prosecuted duritif? the year with energy and
success. In September lust I was enabled to
open to settlement in the territory of Okla
homa 900,000 acres of land, all of which was
taken up by settlers in a single day. The
rush for these lands was accompanied by a
great deal of excitement, but was, happily,
free from incidents of violence.
It was a source of great regret that I was
not able to open at the tame time tho sur
plus lands of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe
reservations, amounting to about 3,000,000
acres, by reason of the insufficiency of the
appropriation for making the allotments.
Deserving and impatient settlers are waiting
to occupy these lauds, and I urgently recom
mend that a special deficiency appropriation
be promptly made of the small amount
needed, so that the allotments may be com
pleted and the surplus lands opened in time
to permit the settlers to gut upon their home
steads in tlie early spring.
During the past summer the Cherokee
commission h is completed arrangements
with the Wichita, Kickanoo and Tonkawa
tribes whereby, if the agreements are rati
fied by congress, over eoo.ouo additional
acres will be opened to settlement in Okla
homa.
The negotiations for fie release by the
Cherokees of their claims to the Cherokee
strip has made no substantial progress, to
far as the department is officially udvicod,
but it is still l'o,ed thut the cession of this
large and valuable tract ma be secured.
The price which the commission was author
ized to offer one dollar and a quarter per
acre is, in my judgment, when all the cir
cumstances as to the title and the character
of the lands are considered, a fair and ode
quate one and should have been accepted by
the Indians.
TENSIONS.
The administration of the pension bureau
has been characterized during the year by
great diligence. The total numlier of pen.
sioners upou the roll on the 3oth day of
June, 1HU1, was 670,100. There were allowed
during the fiscal year ending at that time,
250,605 cases. Of this number 102,387 were
allowed under the law of June 27, lb'JO. The
issuing of certificates has been proceeding at
the rate of 30.000 per month, about 75 per
cent, of these being asked under the new
law. The commissioner expresses the opin
ion that he will be able to carefully adjudi
cate and allow 350,000 claims during the
present fiscal year. The appropriation for
the payment of pensions for the fiscal year
1B90, "Jl, was $127,b85,7y3.Si, and the
amount expended, $li!i,530,64!).20, leaving
an unexpended surplus of $',155,144.04. The
commissioner is quite confident that there
will be no coll this year for a deficiency ap
propriation, notwithstanding the rapidity
with which the work is being pushed. The
mistake which has been made by many in
their exaggerated estimates of the cost of
pensions is in uot taking account of the di
minished value of firrt payments under the
recent legislation. These payments, under
the general laws, have been for many '
years very large, as the pensions, when al
lowed, dated from the time of filing the
claim, and most of these claims had been
pending for years. The first payments un
der the law of June, 18U0, are relatively
small, and as the per cent, of these cases in
creases and that of the old cases diminishes
the annual aggregate of first payments is
is largely reduced. While these disburse
ments to the disabled soldiers of the ereat
civil war are large they do not realize the
exaggerated estimates of those who oppose
this beneficent legislation. The secretary of
the interior shows with great fullness the
care that is taken to exclude fraudulent
claims and also the gratifying fact that the
persons to whom these pensions are going
are men who rendered not slight, but sub
stantial, war service.

" All she lacks of beauty
is a little plumpness."
This is a frequent thought,
and a wholesome one.
All of a baby's beauty is
due to fat, and nearly all of a
woman's we know it as
curves and dimples.
What plumpness has to do
with health is told in a little
book on careful living; sent
free.
Would you rather be
healthy or beautiful? "Both"
is the proper answer.
