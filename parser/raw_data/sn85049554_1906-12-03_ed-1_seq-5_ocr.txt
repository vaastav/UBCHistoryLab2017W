Menage Counted on to Put Some Life
Into the Session—Some of the Dere
lict* of Recent Storm Anxious Noth
ing Should Be Done—Lobbyists Are
Hopeful. i.
{John Callan O'Laughlin in Chicago
Tribune.]
Wtashington, D. C., Dec. 3.—It is a
battered congress which will meet at
noon today at the capltol. (Many of its
members have suffered shipwreck and
are drifting aimlessly on the sea of
politics In search of a haven which has
an official salary.
•Derelicts like Piatt and Depew float
With the tide, awaiting the certain
fate of retirement from public life.
Others who weathered the storm of the
recent elections look with wearied eye
upon the three months of the coming
session. There is no united purpose to
do more than absolutely necessary,
nothing like the energetic determina
tion which marked the assemblage a
year ago and which resulted in the
passage of the railroad rate, meat in
spection, pure food, and other laws.
There are no high hopes save among
the lobbyists. The session like the last
of those of past congresses will be as
lifeless as the leaders in the senate and
house can make it.
But weary as .congress is It will have
to reckoij with the man at the white
houHe. His message, which will be
transmitted on Tuesday, will give thi
senators and representatives game solid
material for legislative digestion. The
Income and inheritance tax proposition
easily will take first place in public es
timation. The relations of capital and
labor, national licensing of corporations
doing an interstate business, and the
relief of labor thru a more stringent
eight hour law on all government work,
the limitation of the hours oi' labor of
railroad employes, and the anii-injunc-,
tion question will be second.
The currency legislation, tariff legis
lation in behalf of the Philippines, a
ship subsidy and immigration will be
among the other important matters the
president will call to the attention of
the legislative branch of the govern
ment.
These are by no means all the recom
mendations the president will, make in
his message, but they are the ones
which will appeal to congress in all
probability above anything elsse he may
say. Japan, Cuba, and Secretary Root'*
South American trip and the presi
dent's views on the negro problem will
be interesting, but will not call for any^
special action. Rather will what he
says regarding Japan tend to discour
age any agitation of the Japanese ex
clusion question.
Tho It is generally recognized that
the annexation of Cuba is a certain
consequence of American intervention
in the island, there is no likelihood of
any change thru congressional action
of the relations which this government
maintains toward the queen of the
Antilles.
Secretary Root's visit to South Arfa«
erica will point the way to the presi
dent's recommendation for a ship sub
sidy bill and it may be stated author
itatively that the president's views on
this subject have been strengthened by
what the secretary of state told him
about the condition of the American'
merchant marine in southern waters.
As to the negro question, it is like
ly some fclnd bf an investigation will be
made by one of the two houses, not of
a race aspect, but of the action 'of the
president in dismissing 200 soldiers of
the Twenty-fifth Infantry. It is un
derstood that Senator Foraker' of Ohio
Intends to introduce a resolution on the
subject if no one else has the temerity
to do eo. The senator is not concern
ed so much about the race feature as
about the« degradation of veteran sol
diers without trial. Such a resolution
of inquiry probably will be adopted and
the senate committee on military affairs
play be charged to look into the mat
ter.
The message 6f the president will
not be all the work the executive has
cut out for the legislators.
As to congress, there will be the us
ual'grist of bills turned Into the legis
lative mill, with little chance of any
getting thru. It is too shore a session
for acnon on any measures save those
imperatively demanded by the people,
and in the past even these sometimes
have failed. Besides the appropriation
bills which must be passed, congress
will dispose of the following measures:
Appropriations for the Improvement
rivers and harbors.
Restricting immigration.
Defining the extent of the application
of writs of injunction in labor dis
putes.
•Granting tariff reductions to the Phil-'
ippines.
Providing for the establishment of a.i
elastic currency.
Investigation of the child labor and
women employment questions.
Appropriations for the enforcement
tOf the pure food law.
Granting a subsidy in behalf of the
merchant marine.
FORGED CHECK TO JOIN LOVER.
Des Moines Girl Smitten With Soldier
Boy Under Arrest
Des Moines, Dec. 1.—To obtain the
funds which would enable her-to join
her lover, a soldier In the Eleventh
cavalry, no\^ in Cuba, pretty 19-year
old Grace McCord, it is alleged, forged
the name of John McCord, her father,
a wealthy farmer near Bayard, to a
check for $400. She collected the mon
ey, purchased tickets for herself and
two friends from Des Moines to New
Orleans, and was arrested at New Or
leans just as she was embarking on a
Southern Pacific steamer for Havana.
Local detectives left for that city to
return with the you'ng girl to the un
relenting father.
The two young women whoin Miss
McCord so philanthropically aided are
Mrs. Abie Rice and Mrs. Hannah
Smith, both of whom married soldiers
flft the Eleventh and were anxious to
v-A.
it,•
join their husbands.. -.
Miss McCord is engaged to marry
John Kuhn, a cavalryman in Troop
She had anticipated marrying him up
on her arrival in Cuba.
The story of Miss MeCord's alleged
waywardness Is romantic to suy the
least. She learned to love her soldier
sweetheart passionately and was brok
en hearted when he was sent to Cuba.
Last Tuesday morning Miss McCord
went from her father's home to Guthrie
Center and there presented herself be
fore the superintendent of schools with
a check for J400 upon the bank at that
place. The check was properly signed
by John McCord, who has a 600 acre
farm in Guthrie county and plenty of
ready cash. The cashier of the bank
looked over the check, recognized the
signature and accepted the endorse
ment of the man who Identified the
girl. Several hours later Mr. McCord
was in Guthrie Center. He denied
having issued the chock and insisted
that the bank run down the girl. T-h«
Iowa National bank of Des Moines
was communicated with and the case
placed in charge of Detectives Me
Nutt and Ed Johnston, who learned
that Miss McCord with two other
young women had been booked to New
Orleans via Kansas City. The chief of
police at New Orleans was notified
and he captured the party last even
ing just as they were about to etn
•bark for Cuba.
It is claimed that Miss McCord
money bought tickets for all the girls,
tho this has not been proved beyond
yond a* doubt as yet. The girls worn
very indignant at the arrest last even
ing and Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Smith in
sisted that they had done nothing
wrong and could not be arrested.
In connection with the investigation
of the Miss McCord escapade the po
lice learned ihat on the same day of
her departure eleven Des Moines young
women and girls left this city for Ha
vana to rejoin either soldier husbands
or lovers. The* went by various routes,
some by Newport News, some by Pitts
burg and some by New Orleans. It Is
thought, however, that Miss McCord
did not contribute to the expenses of
any of these save the three in her par
ticular party.

Washington. Dec. 3.—Tho body of
Samuel Spencer, late president of the
Southern railway, who was killed on
his own railroad on the morning of
Thanksgiving day, was laid to rest
Sunday afternoon In the receiving I
vault at tho Oak Hill cemetery,
there to await final disposition.
The funeral was a notable tribute
to his memory by his associates, by
statesmen, and by men eminent in all
the walks of public life. The services,
held in St. John's Protestant Episcopal
church, were attended by railroad offi
cials, financiers, and public men from
all parts of the country. Many of
them were life-long associates. Hun
dreds of friends came from the south.
Unable to gain admittance hundreds
of people stood outside the edifice lu
the crisp December air thruout the
services.
Among those Who attended the
church services were vice President
Fairbanks, Justice White of the su
preme court of the United States,
Senator and Mrs. Foraker of Ohio,
Senator Bacon of Georgia, Governor
Swanson and Senator Martin of Vir
ginia, Senator Kean of New Jersey,
Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock,
Senator Wetmore of Rhode Island,
former Senator Henry G. Davis of
West Virginia, J. Pierpont Morgan of
New York, a life-long friend and bus
iness associate of President Spencer
E. H. Harriman, Charles Sterling of
New York, and First Vice President
Andrews and Second Vice Presidenl
Finley of the Southern railway.
The body bearers had been selected
from among the colored porters of the
Southern railway. The honorary pall
bearers, all of them personal and offi
cial friends of Mr. Spencer, were prin
cipally presidents or high officials of
the railroads of America, and it was
noted that, either personally or by
proxy, they represented quite one-third
of the vast wealth of the United States.
The funeral service began at 2
o'clock. At the same Instant, thruout
the system of railroads lately presided
over by Mr.1Spencer, every train came
to a dead stop, every wheel ceased to
turn, every employe put aside his work
for five minutes.
The funeral service, which was
strictly in accordance with the ritual
of the Protestant Episcopal church,
was conducted by Bishop JHenry T.
Saterlee. Mrs. Spencer selected the
hymns, "Le%d, Kindly Light," "For All
the Saints, Who From Theirt Labors
Rest," "Abide Wifh Me."
No such profusion of floral offerings
has been in Washington since the ob
sequies of the late President MoICinley
as yesterday filled the Massachusetts
avenue residence of President Spencer
and the chancel of the church. These
tributes came from all parts of the
country. President and Mrs. Roosevelt
sent a wreath of orchids and white
roses, tied with white satin ribbon
Vice President and Mrs. Fairbanks, a
huge bunch of chrysanthemums J. P.
Morgan, a mass of rare cut flowers,
and E. H. Harriman the same.
By direction of Mrs, Spencer all Of

"Yes, I know that Vander-Schoos is

pond is Ions, nnrrow
sheet of water lying between
two wooded ridges. Its capabil
ities as a skating rink nre well
known, nnd It only requires two or
three 00KI days, followed by a moon
light night, to draw out nil the youths
of the neighborhood, and during tho
summer It has a varied assortment of
flat and round bottomed boats, includ
ing rafts and an occasional sailboat.
But it wasn't until Colonel Freeman
came Into the neighborhood with his
half dozen boys that such a thing as a
boat club was even thought of. There
had been scrub races and naval battles
and various kiuds of pond lily and pic
nic expeditions, but they were only for
a day nnd had had as many loaders as
there were boys.
A boat club was something different,
and when it was learned that Colonel
Freeman wished them to meet In the
schoolhouse to discuss plans for a club
and to elect officers every boat owner
and prospective boat owner became ea
ger with excitement and Impatience.
They went to the schoolhouse In a body
and promptly seconded every motion
that was made.
Officers were elected and arrange
ments made for an early race, and
when the boys went home they were
full of eagor plans for the summer's
work. Owners of scows were already
demising plans to exchange their un
wieldy craft for anything with a round
BEN SPKNT a WEEK IN OVVBHATTUHQ AND
BBPAHUNO.
bottom, and those who did not possess
masts and sails were ready to offer any
of their worldly possessions for the
coveted articles.
Ben Horton was not usually counted
as one of the "boys." He lived with
a miserly uncle near the upper end of
the pond and was always very ragged
and shy. The boys Jeered at him and
excluded him from their games as
much aB possible, but Ben was good
natured and seldom took offense. He
would stand by and watch t!£ie others
with eager interest and wan always
ready to assist at the slightest invita
tion.
Much of his time was passed on the
water. He bad found an old scow
somewhere and had patched and calked
the seams until they became nearly
water tight. With this boat he had
explored all the inlets and shallows
and had grown familiar with the pe
culiarities of the winds and currents.
Ben went to the club meeting with as
much curiosity as the rest, but with
little idea of joining. He stood the
scoffing and Jostling of his companions
with good natured equanimity and was
among the flret to sign the constitu
tion. The next morning he drew his
old scow from the water, preparatory
to repatching and recalking.
Originally his boat had been Intended
for freight and was built of coarse,
heavy material. Much patching and
calking had not contributed to its light
ness, and now the most sanguine
would scarcely have regarded it as a
proper candidate for racing honors.
The only thing tp be said in Its favor
was that it was almost Impossible to
be capsized. Ben spent a week in
overhauling and repairing and finished
his work by a liberal application of
black paint, lnsde and out. "When he
returned the boat to the water the
boys promptly named it the Mud Hen.
The first race was to be limited to
sailboats, and this would debar the
Mud Hen unless Ben should bring out
the makeshift sail of old sacking which
he sometimes used. As this was very
old and ragged and by far the most
disreputable sail on the poncl, the boys
thought he would not be willing to dis
play it on such a public occasion.
But on the morning of the races He
was out with the earliest, and the re
doubtable Mud Hen bowed awkwardly
under the consciousness of a new
homemade mast that was several feet
longer than the one It replaced. And
the much patched and mendid sail was
carried up to the proud heights of the
new- mast by an additional width of
sacking. When the boyS saw the pro
moted scow plunging abouti under Its
grotesque spread of patchwork they,
set up a derisive shout Ben grinned
appreciatively and waved Ills old capi

black clouds could be seen creeping
slowly above the trees, but the boys
scarcely noticed. The few who glanced
that way looked rather pleased than
otherwise. The chance of a wetting
does not dlscoucert a boy, and, besides,
the clouds promised the continuance of
the stiff breeze.
Colonel Freeman's cottage overlooked
the pond, and his boat-house was the
wonder and admiration of all the boys.
It was large enough to accommodate
seven or eight boats, and upstairs a
room was being fitted up for the club.
Every boy who had become a member
was already beginning to feel a sort of
proprietorship In the new building.
'l^-ee of the Freeman boys owned
Ihi^. of their own, and the other three
were looking forward to the time when
they would be old enough to Join the
club. Freddie, tho youngest, was only
nine, but he was already as ardent a
boatman as any of them.
The race was to be round an Island
two miles up the pond and back to the
boathouse. Mr. Freeman and two men
from tho village were to act as Judges.
As the boats began to form in line
Mr. Freeman motioned to Ben, who
happened to be near.
"Will you let Freddie go with you?"
he asked. "He wants to be in the race,
and I don't like to have him go In any
of the lighter boats. The weather
threatens to be very squally. The
older boys are strong swimmers and
can take care of themselves, but Fred
die Is too young to risk being cap
sized."
"Of course! I'll be glad to have
him!" cried Ben delightedly. He bad
never been spoken to by Mr. Freeman
before, and he wondered why that
keen eyed gentleman had singled him
ont from the rest of the boys. With a
dexterous motion he swung his boat
alongside the landing so that the little
fellow could spring on board and then
circled back to rejoin the line.
"It will hardly be necessary for me
to caution you about being careful,"
said Mr. Freeman pleasantly as the
boat glided by. "I have been watch
ing you for several weeks and am very
glad, that you belong to the club."
At this point the pond was nearly
half a mile wide, and there was ample
room for the boats to maneuver and
come into the wind. But it was diffi
cult to form a true line, and they were
obliged to circle around again and
again before tho signal was given.
As they scudded up the pond before
the wind the lighter boats rapidly left
their clumsy companion behind, and
when the leading ones rounded a point
three-fourths of a mile away the Mud
Hen had scarcely covered two-thirds of
the distance.
But all this time the black clouds
were creeping ^up the slcy, and every
moment the wind was growing more
fitful and uncertain. One boat would
have Its sails flapping Idly In the wind,
and another, a few rods away, would
be straining under a fierce blast which
swept around a point or from behind
an Island. As the wind increased in
violence many of the boats began to
lower sail little by little, and long be
fore they had rounded the Island some
of them were carrying less than half
the canvas they had started with.
The Mud Hen was behaving splen
didly now and was leaving along wake
of churning foam. Ben had not low
ered sail, and he had no intention of
doing so, at least for the present.
HE SWUNG BTg BOAT AIiOMQSIDB THV
LANDING.
There was little danger of the broad,
heavy boat being capsized, and he did
not fear for the mast.
"I've kept up sail in worse gales than
this," he told Freddie quietly, "an'
nothing didn't give way either. I don't
believe this old boat could be tipped
over. However, if you feel any way
doubtful I'm willin' to lower or to put
back to the boathouse."
"Put back!" cried Freddie Indignant
ly. "I wouldn't think of such a thing!
If I was running this boat I wouldn't
take down a stitch of canvas, not If I
was being blown clean out of water.
No, sir!"
"Good for you, Freddie! That's the
way to talk! We'll beat some of 'em
yet!" Beii's face was in a glow of ex
citement as he looked down at his
small companion. "See the Corsair on
ahead there." he continued enthusias
tically. "We've gained twenty feet in
the last five minutes."
"I know it," replied Freddie compla
cently. "I've bieen watching. They
hooted us back yonder. Now I'm going
to wave my hat and cheer when we go
by. Last's the best every time."
Foot by foot they covered the space
between the two boats, and presently
the Corsair was left behind. Ben look
ed complacently conscious, and Fred
die waved his hat enthusiastically as
they went past.
But there seemed little probability
that they would overtake any of the
others. Long before they reached the
turning point they met them coming
«V
's
naclc lb' a long, wavering line unOet
half or three-quarter sail and skim
ming over the water like so many big
birds. Ben glanced critically from one
to the other and shook his head.
"They've got too much sail up now,"
he said anxiously. "Them sort o' boats
can't carry like ours can. First they
know somebody'll be spilled."
His words camo true sooner than he
had expected. One of the boats caught
the wind on a new tack before her
commander was prepared, and the su'd
don filling of the sails caused the frail
shell to be almost lifted from the wa
ter. In a moment her two occupants
were struggling In the pond.
KB WANED SUDDENLY AGAINST TOT
TELLEK.
ForttmturHy' they were good swim
mers, and they promptly set to work
to disentangle the rigging and get the
boat aBhore. But they were out.of the
race.
The accident was witnessed from ail
the boats and caused a sudden ripple
of caution. Sails were hastily reduced
and reckless commanders went to the
other extreme and became overcareful.
All but the captain of the Mud Hen.
He knew his boat and,, with an ap
proving glance toward the rudely con
structed rigging, settled himself firmly
beside the tiller to make a short turn
around the island.
There was nothing graceful about the
movements of his boat. It plunged and
bobbed and sometimes met the waves
head down, but It covered the distance
rapidly, and that was what Ben want
ed. When he rounded the island the
nearest boat was less than an eighth
of a mile away.
The Mud Hen did not cleave the wa
ter as a pointed boat Would have done.
It dashed forward recklessly and
buried Its prow under a comb of falling
spray. Freddie clapped his bands and
shouted gleefully, and Ben himself was
scarcely less excited.
Gradually they gained on the nearest
boat and passed It and then rapidly
overhauled the next and the next
When they came In sight of the boat
house, half a mile away, there were
but three boats in front of them.
Ben's lipB were tightly closed now,
and he' made each tack count for as
much as possible. Wh«n he changed
his course he brought the boat Instant
ly Into the wind and never lost a sec
ond by useless flapping of the sail.
Presently another boat was passed and
then another. Freddie was jubilant
and looked at Ben with shining eyes.
But the captain of the Mud Hen had
a queer smile on his face. As the two
boats shot forward, prow and prow, he
leaned suddenly against the tiller, and
his boat swerved almost imperceptibly
to one side. The next instant the other
boat crossed the line scarcely a yard in
advance.
Freddie uttered a cry of dismay and
sank dejectedly on his seat Ben nod
ded brightly to the captain of the vic
torious boat and then turned the Mud
Hen toward shore.
As be gilded up to the boat landing
Mr. Freeman stepped down and grasp
ed his hand.
"You made a splendid dash that last
half mile," he cried cordially. "I had
no idea your boat was such a racer.
By the way, that boy who won is a
friend of yours, isn't he?"
•Tes, sir."
"Glad he got the race, I suppose?"
"Yes, indeed!" eagerly. "His father
ipromised him a new boat if"— Ben
stopped suddenly as he saw the quiz
Klcal smile on Mr. Freeman's face.
"I see. That is why you gave him the
race then?"
