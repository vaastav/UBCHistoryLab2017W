BALFOUR OPENS FIGHT.
I LEAD UNIONISTS.
fanner Premier Predicts the Down
fall of iht Liberals.
Manchester, Dec. 9— J. Balfoucr now the j
t»Ader of the Opposition party in the United |
fZg&om. opened the campaign in a stirring
jj before his Manchester constituents to
with the utmost frankness the former
~*^aier explained that the resignation of his
-ensirfnt was on the ground of expediency,
r ' jj,g that the step had been carefully con
37 / for some time and tn&t it was evidently
Js*»plated by Mr. Baifour for the greater
-rt of the year.
* if' Balfour defended the action of the TJnlon
aiovernment in its retention of office, on the
s»nd that it wa£ essential to wait until the
i «]«-Ja'"3:.?se treaty was concluded and other
!^essary features of the government pro
'" imir.e Vere carried out. This had been -done,
"he exception of the Redistribution bill, an
utline of which had been given to Parliament,
bat divisions within the Uniowrit party led the
igjemroent to the conclusion that It would be
tapossfble at present to carry a measure which
demanded absolute unity.
Without going at length into the probable
platform .-.f the Liberals, the former Premier
Lfcea fun »- the Liberal protest against being
forced to accept office and ridiculed a party
corapose^ of so many factions.- He laid the lash
c ' bitter sarcasm on what he declared to be
attempts to avoid making Home Rule the
taking is?« e - and said ' vrnetner they were
shamed of it or not. Home Rulers they were
• and Home Rulers they would remain. Mr. Bal
fanr plainly indicated- that the Unionist attack
"id be centred on vthe Home Rule record of
♦he Liberals, while th- Unionists would use
Iheir own record on home, foreign and colonial
rolicies as their bulwark of defence.
. He challenged the Liberals on the issue of
Chinese labor in South Africa. Here the for
mer Premier became severely denunciatory. He
said the Liberals had won by-elections by un
scrupulous disregard of the truth. "Let us for
yrc^ '■- -we oar.." he said, "the programme by
which they endeavored to blacken our political
W. provided that now. when they are in a re-
F *poWble position, they do not kindle a feeling
among our colonies which, believe me. if once
fcindied will not be easily extinguished."
21- Balfocr made a strong- plea for unity dur
ing the elections. He hoped that the new ad
ministration, when it handed back the reins to
the Unionists, would be able to point to a rec
ord equally creditable to the country. He pre
dated the failure of the Liberals to carry out
tieir jTCjramir.e. which he understood was the
unsetting of many things accomplished by the
Unionists, but he hoped they* would stick to
their resolution to follow the lines of foreign
policy of the Unionist government.
The meeting passed a vote of confidence in
Mr BaJfour. whereupon the former Premier, re
sponding, said he had much to say concerning
«h Unionist and Liberal programmes, but that
to would reserve it for a more fitting occasion.
He said that he intended to lead the Opposition
ftoSh the campaign. "The party elected me
atoder. and 1 intend to carry out the great
J^ r~;.r ~;.: T 'c. te4 so jr.v hands." he said. lam
iSS-v'corfldent that from all sections of the
££ il t°c«snV differences what they may,
receive that support which I have never
rated for in the past." made no reference to
U his speech Mr. Balfour made no reference to

BONAPARTE NOT ANNOYED
REPLIES TO CRITICISM.
Says Indignation Over "Old Iron*
sides" Is Unwarranted.
[By TWegmph to The Tribunal
Baltimore. Dec. 9.— Secretary Bonaparte of
the Navy Department docs not appear to be In
the least annoyed over the protests from New-
England and other parts of the country con
cerning his reference in his annual report to
the disposition of the frigate Constitution— "Old
Ironsides.'" Mr. Bonaparte to-day said that
all of his correspondents did not know the true
history of the vessel, and that his Idea In recom
mending the breaking up of the vessel wu
purely from a practical standpoint and to save
the expense of keeping the aged hulk, which la
keel deep In mud at the Charlestown Navy
Yard, Boston.
Mr. Bonaparte said:
It was In 1862, when the cadets in training for
the navy **-ere transferred from Annapolis to
Newport, R. 1., because of the war, and I. who
was then eleven years old. with my parents,
visited .the frigate Constitution, then at New
port. I remember distinctly ihe commander of
the vessel pointing out to us a pair of timbers
which he said had been part of the famous Con
stitution. That was some years ago. and you
can figure about how much of the original hulk
is left.
The indignation of the New-Eng!anders par
ticularly and others generally is unwarranted
in view of the statement of fact which I have
made and which can b« substantiated. The
memories that cling about the original frigate
as suggested in my report, be perpetuated
in the building of an armored cruiser, with the
name and as much of the equipment and tim
bers possible as can be used of the old Con
stitution. The matter is in the hands of Con
gress, and I will abide by ihe decision of that
body. I simply look at the practical side of the
case, and suggest that v.-c build a cruis.ar to
memorialize the original sh:p, as was done in the
reconstruction of the present Constitution.
OLD IRONSIDES MEETING.
Speakers Rap Bonaparte for Sug
gesting Constitution' 8 Destruction.
Boston, Dec. 9.— "Don't give up the ship!" was
the sentiment nailed on the front of the platform
of Faneuil Hall, which save a text to every speaker
at a public meeting held in the historic building to
night to protest against the recommendation of
Secretary of the Navy Bonaparte that the old
frigate Constitution, now at the Charlestown Navy
Yard, be destroyed Several hundred persons an
swered Acting Mayor Daniel A. WTaelton's call lor
the meeting, and the speakers pleaded for the pres
ervation of the old vessel.
Acting Mayor Wheiton opened the meeting by
reading a number- of letters protesting against the
recommendation of the Secretary, and among the
number was one from ex-Secretary of the Navy
John D. Long. Mr. Long wrote In part:
I am sure that on reflection and on learning the
intense feeling of the citizens of Boston and also,
I am sure, of the patriotic people of the whole coun
try, he will modify his views. When he made the
suggestion I cannot think he was aware of the
great number of persons, especially the young,
who visit tne ship every year and to whom It is an
inspiring, patriotic stimulus. No time, nor change,
nor wear and tear can make It anything to the eye
of the heart than the very same old frigate that
fought the Guerriere, and not only won victories
but gave our navy its prestige, ar>d to-day embodies
the pride of the United States in naval achieve
ments more than any other material thing in ex
istence. The suggestion shocks every instinct o*.
national pride and glory. Ah brav«X.awrenc* said:
"Don't give up the snip."
Ex-Attorney General Albert E. Piilabury, t?f this
State, was invited to preside and in his opening
remarks he read a communication which. he had
received from Secretary Bonaparte. In which the
latter stated that the fate of the Constitution rested
with Congress and that he (Bonaparte) did not
wish to take unauthorized liberties with the Con
stitution. "And we "will see fiiat he does not," was
Mr. Pillsbury's comment on the telegram.
The principal speaker of the evening was ex-
Congressman William Everett, of Quincy.  Dr.
Everett referred to Secretary Bonaparte's remark
that the Constitution had been so changed and
made over that there was very little left of the
original ship. Speaking of tne veneration with
which the French nation regards the remains of
Napoleon Bonaparte, and 6tating that It Is well
known medically that the physical structure of
any person undergoes material changes within a
short period. Dr. Everett asked: "What would be
the feeling if the President of the French Republic
recommended that as th« body of the great French
Emperor that was brought back from St. Helena
was not that of the victor of Marengo and of
Austerlitz— the person who faced the snows of
Moscow, the general who fought the battle of
Leipsic and the one who was overthrown at Water
1O In closing. Dr. Everett said: "If the Secretary If
at a. loss what to do with the Constitution we will
take her. Boston and Massachusetts will buy her.
Send her back to her own people, wno will keep
her as long as the United States exist or the
Indian remains upon the flag of Massachusetts.
Other speakers included Congressman John A.
Keliher. State Senator William Taylor and W. W.
Doherty, of this city.
WRITES DEATH WARNING.
Brain Specialist Pens "I Am Dying"
as He Is Stricken.
[By Telegraph to The Trttmn*.]
Indianapolis, Dec 9 —Dr. William B. Fletcher,
a brain specialist of this city, for several years
superintendent of the Central Insane Hospital,
while sitting in the office of his sanatorium to
day wrote something on a piece of paper and an
instant later fell to the floor. When his secre
tary sprang to his aid she found he was un
conscious, having been stricken with paralysis,
which affected his entire left side and rendered
hip right eye sightless. Ho is now dying.
On thr- paper which the doctor suddenly seized
were the words "I am dying." It is supposed
Sat he felt the paralytic stroke coming and by
sheer force of will delayed unconsciousness till
he could write the sentence.

DIFFER OVER SERVICE.
MAY BE INVESTIGATION.
Shan: and Wyman at Odds About
Marine Hospitals.
[From Th» Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 9. — There is reason to fear
that an unfortunate difference of opinion be
tween the Secretary of the Treasury and Sur
geon General Wyman will be ventilated when
the Appropriations Committees of Congress
come to provide for the Marine Hospital Ser
vice. In his annual report the Secretary voiced
some severe strictures on this branch of the
government service, and it is obvious that h»
regards it as at least an extravagant and un
profitable service as now administered. The
Secretary suggested to Congress the advisa
bility of materially curtailing the service, even
to the extent of stopping work on certain hos
pitals now building, and lnpping off a consider
able number of the officials now on the rolls.
The Secretary intimated In his report that he
was of the opinion that Surgeon General Wy
man had used his influence with Congr. as for
the agrandizement of the Marine Hospital Ser
vice to an extent which almost constituted in
subordination to the Secretary of the Treasury-
It is doubtless true, however, that many mem
bers of Congress welcome the investment in
their ■ respective States of the funds appro
priated for the extension and maintenance of the
service, and they intimate that the Secretary
attributed their generosity more to the per
sonal influence of the surgeon general than
the facts warrant. The Secretary assertr,
however, that appropriations were made for
the construction of marine hospitals at Buf
falo and Pittsburgh wMiout his recommendation,
and he recommended that this work be now
abandoned. . He points out that it was never
necessary to make drafts on the Treasury for
the support of this sen-ice, to the maintenance
of which is devoted the proceeds of a tonnage
tax on vessels, untl; within th .U^t few ye^
and the fact that «uch oeceSS.ty' recently 3a&
arisen the Secretary attil»at«v to the extrava
gant methods of administration. >._ ■
■T*e differences 'between the Secretary and the
sureeon general are so radical that it is feared
Boroe sort of Congress investigation of the entire
subject will become inevitable
CURTAIN HITS CARUSO.
Tenor Surprised by Blow on Head
.at Opera.
Two performances of widely different works, but
each attended by an audience which taxed the ca
pacity of the Opera House, were given yesterday.
In the afternoon DonizettiSs sentimental, sprlght.y
fountain of tunefulness. "L'Klisir d'Amo*e. ' was
set a-playlng for the first time this season with
Mme. Sembrlch, Caruso, Rossi and Scotti in the
cast, and In the evening "Die Walkiire" was sung,
also for the first time this winter, with Mme. >.or
cica as BriinhUde.
The performance of "I/Elisir d'Amore" threat
ened for two acts to prove fatal to Caruso; Fate
seemed to lie in wan for him. to break his skull.
A full half minute before it was time at the end of
the first act the curtains beg»an to close, leaving
Caruso and Mme. Sembrich on the outside, still
singing. They tried to hold the curtains apart
and "sustain their top notes at the same time, and
in the effort Caruso forgot the drop which de
scends behind the draperies. The weighted bottom
of it took him full in the head, and, with rumpied
hair, he turned and sparred with the aggressive
tapestry- His head was uncracked and his spirits
tindimmed, however, for in the second act he ges
ticulated so eagerly with his bottle of love potion
that he broke it over his own crown. Fortunately,
he was only slightly cut. and he appeared to enjoy
his unexpected shampoo as much as anybody.
Nothing more serious happened to him in the third
act than an enforced repetition of Mb aria. Barring
these accidents, the performance was capital, and
the audience was unaffectedly, joyously happy.

Chicago, Dec. 9.- A dispatch to "The Tribune"

who has just returned from Alas' a, has dlscov
vered that ln> and his companions greased their
boots, oars, masts and everything else that
needed it with ambergris worth $20 an ounce,
and threw away more than they used, in the
belief that it was ordinary grease. Schaer
saved five ounces in a pickle bottle for future
use.
The bottle was placed In his bag and forgot
ten. Yesterday, curiosity to know what the stuff
was led Schaer to show It to a druggist, who
offered $73 fcr the contents of the bottle. Schaer
says he and his companions found the stuff in
quantities in arctic waters, but never dreamed
of its value other than as a good lubricant.

FLORIDA'S FAMOUS TRAINS.
MAY ALTER MORGAN FIRM.
Wall Street Men Urge Reorganiza
tion of Banking House.
Certain interests In Wall Street are bringing
heavy pressure on J. Pierpont Morgan to induce
him to make a reorganization of his firm. A
new lieutenant to Mr. Morgan should be pro
vided, they declare, and advance Edward T.
Stotesbury. of Philadelphia, a member of Drex
el & Co., the firm's Philadelphia connection, for
the place. Within the last few days a well
known banker has had a long talk with Mr.
Morgan on this subject.
Since Mr. Bacon retired from J. P. Morgan &
Co. most of the work of that firm has fallen on
George W. Perkins and Charles Steele. The ar
guments made to Mr. Morgan declared that Mr.
Perkins, because of the insurance scandal, was
discredited, and if the firm was to escape a loas
of prestige he should be retired.
Mr. Steele, his logical successor, the argu
ments continued, probably would not be able to
resume his work for a long time. Mr. Steels
has been ill from grip, it was said, but his
llinees, according to one person who talked with
Mr. Morgan on this subject, was serious. His
absence loft a large gap in the Morgan firm's
working force. Sir Clinton Dawkins, a member
of the London firm, died recently, leaving still
another vacancy. Mr. Stotesbury, the banker
argued, should be brought to the main office, for
he was a man of wide experience and great re
sourcefulness.
Mr Perkins, according to certain men, is not
as high in Mr. Morgan's confidence as he was
formerly. They instanced his declared igno
rance of Mr. Morgan's plans in regard to the re
organization of the Cincinnati. Hamilton and
Dayton on the evening of the day before his
election as chairman of the board of that road.
His retirement from J. P. Morgan &Co ac
co-ding to those interests, is likely to coincide
with his retirement from the vice-presidency of
the New-York Life Insurance Company, which
>£s expected by next April.

DAVIS NOW REPUBLICAN.
Ex-Assistant Secretary of Interior
Indorses President Roosevelt.
[By Teltgraph to The Tribune.]
Los Angeles, Cal.. Dec. 9.— Webster Davis, ex-
Assistant Secretary of the Interior, in renounc
ing Democracy to-day, said: "I am a great ad
mirer of Theodore Roosevelt and his policies. So
long as those policies remain in force I shall
lend my voice to their upholding and will be
identified with the Republican party.
"In my opinion," continued Mr. Davis, "The
odore Roosevelt is the greatest President in
the history of the American Republic, because
he and hia policies are clearer to the masses.
President. Roosevelt has opened the doors of the
Republican party for my return. His position in
the late Japanese-Russian war was the identical
attitude I urged President McKinley to take in
the Boer war. I am therefore back within the
Republican fold and not only indorse President
Roosevelt's attitude tn the settling of the war,
but I approve and admire his course on all the
other great nuestions now before the American
public."
Davis goes to the City ot Mexico on Sunday,
thence to Michigan, which, he says, wjll be his
future home and where he expects actively to
engage in politics. He says Tammany was too
"strong" for him to accept a Congress nomiia
tion from it.
NO SENATE HONORS FOR MITCHELL.

R.D.BALLANTINEASUICIDE
SHOT SELF IN NEWARK.
Act of Brewer's Son Attributed to
Despondency.
Robert D. Ballantine, son of the late John H.
Ballantlne, the brewer, shot and killed himself
last night in the home cf his mother, Mrs.
Jeanette Ballantine, at N0. '43 Washington- st-,
Newark. None of the members of the family
were in the house at the time. Conrad, a butler,
and two maids were the only persons in the
house besides Mr. Ballantine. They heard the
shot ring out from a front room on the second
floor, and when Conrad ran to investigate he
found Ballantine stretched on a bed. with blood
oozing from a wound In his right temple, while
in his right hand was a smoking revolver.
Dr J L Fewsmitb. who lives a few doors
away, was called up on the telephone and he
reached the house a few minutes later. He
pronounced the young man dead.
He-bart Ballantine, the brother of the sui
cide who lives about one hundred yards away,
reached the house about the same time as the
physician. He at once telegraphed word to
his mother, who is visiting relatives in Man
land. Herbert Ballantine could give no rea
son for his brother's act, unless it was that he
committed it while suffering from despondency,
to which he had been subject.
Mr. Ballantine had been speculating rather
heavily in Wall Street lately and it was sug^
gested that reversals in the market may have
been particularly the cause of his suicide.
That the act was premeditated there Is little
. doubt On Thursday Robert D. Ballantine
brought a small package to the house with
him and left it on a hall hatrack. It remained
there until about 8 o'clock last night, when he
returned from New-York, where he had spent
the night before with some friends attending a
dinne/ at the ,Wald orf- Astoria. .

that she feared It would finish his ruin, begun
when he "as made president of the Carnegie

fast six months has been holding his office only
through sufferance of the directors of the steel
corporation and because of his promise to re
sign at the end of the present year Is asserted
In Pittsburg to-day. There has come out the
etory that six months ago the director* of .the
etee' corporation met quietly in New-York to
-ons'ider some rumors of alleged misconduct on
the part of Mr. Corey. Mr. Corey is alleged
to have saved himself from immediate resigna
tion by saying: "Gentlemen, I will tender my
resignation at the end of the present year If this
will satisfy." .
It was decided to allow this state of affairs to
continue, and It has been understood that Corey
was to retire with a "vote of thanks, regrets,
etc.," by the directors. There was at this time
no inkling of an explosion in marital relations.
Now, since the statement has been forced
from Mr. Corey that he will not contest an
application for divorce made by his wife, the
question bothering the steel directors is whether
they shall ktep faith with Mr. Corey, allow him
to finish the term, or dismiss his now. Mr.
Corey's friends are making a bitter tight for
him to be allowed to finish the year, and may
succeed. At the time of the first explosion, Alva

is said. . ■ ;
