--"THUNDER IN THE WINTER."— The Cleveland Her
ald of Monday says : It is not a common thing in
this latitude to hear thunder in the winter, but vee
terday afternoon, about four o'clock, we were visited
by one of the most thoroughly developed thunder
storms of the past twelve m nths. The vivid flashes
of lightning, the loud crashes and reverberations of
the thunder, and the down pouring of the rin,
would have done credit to the sultry days of August.
It lasted about an hour, nnd immense quantities of
water fell. "Thunder in winter" is said to be a sure
indication of freezing weather soon. If the intensi
ty of the coming cold is to be judged by the vividnes?
of the lightning and the loudness of the thnnder, we
will soon have a touch of the Arctic regiops.
FBEEDMEN's BUREAU.— The New Orleans True Helta
says to its readers:
If our p- ople wish to get 'id of freedmen's bureaus,
of harraesing annoyances, aod to be r. stored to their
civil rights, they must make amply adequate pro
vision for the protection of the persons, labor, pro
perty. and rights of the free negyoes. We believe
this to be the unalteraLlo policy of the Government,
which it is folly to attempt to contend against.
THE MEHStOE.
The Message just submitted by President
Johnson to the two Houses of Congress, is
one of the most concise and comprehensive
State papers ever issued by a chief magistrate
of the Republic; and as a complete vindication
of the Government in its struggle to maintain
itself against disintegration and overthrow, it
leaves nothing needful to be said. Thoroughly
and carefully analyzing the rights of the State
and general Governments respectively, and
conceding to each the powers justly their due,
he shows that in what has happened of late,
the coarse taken by the defenders of the Con
stitution was inevitable; that doing less than
has been done by the champions of republi
canism, would have been the destruction of
all that was valuable in good government, the
triumph of all that could be deplored in the
overthrow of equal rights and the hopes of
progress. Invoking the precepts of the found
ers of the nationality, and justifying his action
by what they have clearly laid down, he tells
the nation why he has been slow to interfere
with the rights and prerogatives of the States;
why, in the plenitude of the power already
conferred upon him as the National Executive,
he has had no occasion to use his great powers
more freely than he has seen fit to do. Anx- :
ious to let a partially disruptured government
reconstruct itself, so far as it could be relied
upon to accomplish so great an undertaking,
he freely tells Congress and the people why he
so unhesitatingly made the experiment of with
drawing military rule from certain of the States
lately in revolt, that unless the return to the
Union was made upon the basis of the rights
of the States, as clearly understood remaining
unimpaired, the central government of which
they formed the constituents, would also be
weakened, that "the whole cannot exist with
"out the parts, nor the parts without the
"whole.
And whilst he dwells upon the evils insepa
rable from military rule, he set 9 forth at length
the nature of that policy, bold yet considerate
and wary, which following closely the reac
tionary spirit manifested from time to time,
has enabled him to trust those who hate been
most deeply engaged in defying the authority
of the Government. Vindicating the Federal
authority by the appointment of "Provisional
Governors," aud encouraging the formation
of public opinion through the action of the
State Conventions recognized as occasion
served, the reestablishment of Post offices as
public benefits, along with United States Courts
and other national agencies looking to bring
ing security to persons and property, have
had their kindly influence, making the return
of the General Government "known only as a
"beneficence," and rapidly doing away with
that feeling of distrust which has to so great
an extent been fostered by the acts of revolu
tionists and demagogues only intent on lead
ing the people astray. Admitting the "risk"
of such a policy, he chose that, as the
least of possible evils: and if he had
done nothing else in his whole event
ful career to entitle him to the appella*
tion of a statesman, and to the gratitude of the
people, these broad and liberal views, and this
course, so fraught with a brave and hopeful
trust in the better qualities of the masses,
would be amply sufficient to place him
amongst those recognized as the benefactors
ofthe nation. "Inviting" the States lately in
revolt to participate in "the amendment of
"the Constitution," he has again, in this,
made them largely the judges of, and the con
trollers of their own destinies; and intimating
the promise of a "general amnesty" for those
who have broken the laws, yet are repentant,
he appeals to the strongest motives possible
in the direction of a thorough and speedy re
construction. And if his "invitation" is
rather imperative, if he insists upon the
"amendment" as much in the nature of a final
test of what is sincere and "loyal," it is far
more of forbearance than could have been ex
pected, and certainly no more than all the cir
cumstances fully justify, if we are ever to have
in truth a restored Union.
He deals but briefly and indecisively with
those questions appertaining to the standing
of the freedmen; and this doubtless, because
on other occasions he has set forth pretty
much at length what he deems his power to
deal with their claims; aud if he has thus left
these matters more fully to Congressional "ac
tion than most others, he is, we think, fairly
justified in doing this, in view of late events
and the promulgation of opinions from promi
nent quarters. That he is most kindly dis
posed toward them is plain enough; because
far from insisting upon the necessity of "colo
nizing" them elsewhere, he encourages them
to hope for a good future in a country where
there is a demand for labor from all.
"He predicts a glorious future for the Gulf
"States, 'now that slavery is at an end,' en
"joining them 'to look away to the future which
"is sure to be laden for them with greater
' 'prosperity than has ever before been known."
But following this, is a passage calculated
to awaken a feeling of anxiety, we think,
amongst certain great corporations, when he
says—"No State can be justified in devise to
"tax the transit of travel aud commerce be
"tween States." Therefore—let "the State of
Camden and Amboy," for one, take heed.
Coming to the reports of the Secretaries, he
briefly, but hopefully, passes them in review,
the Report of the Postmaster General espe
cially, presenting a most encouraging condi
tion of affairs, that department which in the
olden time was too often a dead weight upon
the public treasury, as well iu its high rates
as upon the people. The large reductions in
the Navy and the War Departments are dwelt
upon with much apparent satisfaction, and
coming to the Treasury Department, he
speaks in the most decidc-d terms of the obli
gation of the nation to stand up to its liabil
ities unflinchingly, whilst, at the same time,
pursuing the most rigid economy in order to
maintain the National credit unimpaired.—
He commends the action already takeu in re
ducing the volume of currency, and without
considering "a National debt a National
blessing," he terms it a ''heavy burden." to
be gotten rid of "withoutunnecessary delay."
But it is in dealing with our complications
with England, and with our foreign policy
generally, that we apprehend the Message
will be dwelt upon with peculiar interest.
Justly complaining of the conduct of England
in her course towards us, he significantly tells
Congress that he does " not advise to any
"present attempt at redress by acts of legisla
"tion;" and in referring to the action of other
Powers in taking advantage of our past trou
bles, he shows that he has abated nothing of
our prescriptive rights aud claims; that these
are only held in abeyance; await "a more
"convenient season" for their adjustment.
The Message winds up by earnestly con
gratulating the people of this country on the
advantages they possess over the people of
most other lands, for the development of what
marks the advancement of the race in all that
is essential to their happiness. Expressing
unbounded confidence in the future of the
nationality, he appeals to the people to join
him in carrying the nation onward to its high
destiny; and winds up appropriately—by ex
pressing the hope that "we of this day may be
"able to transmit our great inheritance of
"State Governments in all their rights, of the
"General Government in its whole constitu
"tional vigor to our posterity, and they tc
"their s through countless generations."

What a Biitfalontaii Saw in Baltimore.
A contributor to the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,
in a late number of thnt journal, gives an account of
what he saw iu Baltimore ditring a brief stay here
some time ago, and as he says a great mny pretty
things of us, we quote for the delectation of our read
ers. and especially the ladies, to whom he pays a flat
tering and deserved compliment.
During the brief stay which we made in Baltimore,
we managed to see most that possesses any particular
interest in the city. Our first visit was to the Wash
ington Monument, the view from the top of which is
magnificent. The panorama presented to the flushed
and tired pilgrim i? sufficiently comprehensive and
lovely to repay him for all that he has endured in
gaining his elevated foothold. I make no attempt to
describe it, for I am neither poet nor painter; but I
heartily admonish those who visit Baltimore to put
themselves in commun'oation with this luxuriant
spread of beauty—the combined work of nature and
art.
Druid Hill Park is one of the features of Balti
more. It contains six hundred acres, and lies about
two miles away from the business portion ofthe c-ty.
It is yet in an unsophisticated condition, and I ven
ture to say that if art does not spoil the pretty ca
prices of nature which enter into its composition, it
will, in good time, be worth a long journey to see and
enjoy.
Of our sewerage he says:
It is, of eourse. no particular concern of mine, in
what manner a city is drained, but I claim the right
to say that the system of surface-sewerage wh eh has
been adopted in Baltimore strikes the stranger very
unpleasantly. lam familiarwith, and assume to ap
preciate the local logic which champions the system,
but it fails to convince me that the plan is the best
which could have been devised. The raised stepping
stones with which a number of the principal streets
are disfigured look like an advance picket thrown
out by some weary_"Stonewall"lorthopurposewhich,
if it be disguised, is obliviously malicious. I grant
their necessity, their indispensability, in the present
order of things; fur it is next to impossible'to cross one
of the avenues where they are found, even after a
heavy dew. without experiencing a "dew!d, moist,
unpleasant" sensation iu that portion of th-' anatomy
which is farthest removed from the crown of the head;
but. all this does not pr- ve that both they and the sys
tem they are intended to servemight not bcubolished
in a lump.
But the general air of Baltimore is attractive. The
business streets are commcndably clean, anil scores
of the business buildings are as splendid specimen* of
architecture as one could wish to see. I nave rarely
seen private reside res which expressed more solid
elegance and substantial comfort than those of Balti
more. Their language is one of rational enjoyment.
They were constructed rather with regard to the
emotions than the eye. Indeed, Baltimore, "lovely
and pleasant" in it?elf, needs but the presence of the
refining spirit of a pure patriotism to render it one ot
the most desirable places in which to spend the days
that are allotted to man that can be discovered after
the most patient and persistent search.
A passing tribute to the beauty of Baltimore, and
i bid it farewell. It i 9 my deliberate and candid
opinion that in no city on the American continent is
thero concentrated more female loveliness than is to
be found in the metropolis of Maryland. Wherever
you are, in the street, the church, the theatre—its
radiance bedazzles you, its weird spell is upon you.
"If idol worship ever yet was right,
It is when Woman ravishes the sight."
I should be less than human were I able to enter
the charmed circle of Baltimore beauty without ex
periencing sn-idry singular sensations in the left side,
and recalling various voloptuous characters and
scenes in ancient mythology, notwithstanding tho
plain and practical fact that a marriage certificate
tnay be found among my valuable papers, which evi
dently relates to myself, and that I am obliged, every
year, to purchase more or less pairs of children's
shoes,
DREADFUL NIEAMIiUAT DISASTER.
Collision of Niagara nnd Post Roy—Great
Loss of Life—Full Particulars.
[From the Memphis Appeal, Nov. 20.]
It is an old maxim with steamboat men that "ac
cidents never come single," which ha? been alas 1 too
often verified upon onr Western waters, as is evi
denced by the burning lately of the Tycoon, which
was soon followed by the sinking of the Ben Stiek
ney, and tho burning of the Duke, and again we are
called upon to chronicle another and more fearful
marine disaster, involving an immense loss of life.
From Mr, Greenough, clerk of tho Niagara, we
leant that on Friday night, about nine o'clock, when
about seven miles above 11 el na, they discovered the
Post Boy coming down and running in toward the
Arkansas shore. The usual signals were given and
promptly answered, but in a lew minutes it was dis
covered that the Post Boy was beur-ng down upon
them by crossing over to the channel. Capt. Fitz
gerald, who was on the roof at the time, saw the
danger, and immediate y ordered the engines stopped,
which was done about the same time that the Post
Boy struck her on tho larboard tide, ait of the boil' rs,
or in other words, amidships, cutting through into
her hull, and causing her to sink to the boiler deck
in about three minutes.
Tho Niagara had on board at the time between two
hundred and fifty and three hundred cabin and deck
passengers, including one hundred and twenty-nine
colored soldiers, who had lately been discharged, nnd
the scene that ensued when the collision occurred will
never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. In the
cabin there was less confusion than wight have been
expected, considering tho large number of ladies on
board. They were cool and collected, much more so
than the men, until the ill-tated vessel sank beneath
the waves, and tue heart-rending cries of the deck
passengers arose from beneath their feet, and thev
realized the fact that hundreds of lives were being
St.
Captain Fitzgerald and the other officers immedi
ately set to work to cut away the cabin floor, in order
to rescue them from their impending fate, and nobly
did they strive admid that dreadful scene at which
the bavest stood appalled, us the floor was cut away,
and disclosed them struggling in the water, while the
cabin resounded with their shrieks lor help. Captain
Fitzgerald and th officers, assisted by some of the
passengers, worked with an energy almost superhu
man, and only ceased when the turbulent waves had
silenced every cry and closed over the lifeless bodies
of those who so recently had been struggling in it.
About fifty or sixty were thus saved.
The Post Boy remained alongside and rendered all
the assistance possible, in taking off the passengers,
until toe Kate Hart came up and took the majority
of them on board.
How many lives is lost is unknown, owing to the
fact that a portion of the passengers returned to He
lena, but the lowest estimate is seventy-five, princi
pally of the colored soldiers, whose names are un
known. and probably will remain so. No cabin pas
sengers were lost, and i.o baggage, except what was
stored in the baggage room, which is underwater.
Her entire cargo, consist ing in part of two hun
dred and fifty bales of cotton and a large amount ol
merchandise, was lost.
A CONSUL RESIGNED—We understand that John
E. Newport. Esq.. of this city, who for more than
four years ha* served as Uniied States Consul at

tending as it his throughout the entire pr od ..f he

running and the ravages of rebel privateers, of
very unusual, delicate and important character, and

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's Message was read in the Senate by
f ob Forney, the .Secreiaty, and in the House by Mr.
McPherson, the Clerk. Both these gentlemen per
formed their duties in such manner as to elicit gene
ral commendation. The passages in the message,
which were applauded in tne House during the read
ing were those asserting that traitors should be pun
ished and the offence made infamous, and at the same
time the question judicially settled, finally nd for
ever that no btate ot its own will has the right to re
nounce its plnce in the llnion; that a tax on t rft vel
and merchandise in their transit constitutes one of
the worst forms of Monopoly; and the evil is increased
if coupled with a denial of the choice of route:
and also the President's declaration that the justifi
cation of England in fitting out cruisers during the
rebellion, "cannot be sustained before the tribunal
of nations, and that *he friendspip between the two
countries must hereafter rest on the basis of mutual
justice." The applause op the reading of this part
ofthe message was emphatic, and ther* was a gene
ral clapping of hands, both on the floor and in the
galleries, on the conclusion of tho reading of the
document. The message seems to be regarded by
every one acquainted with its contents HS frank,
direct and patriotic, and its facts and arguments so
clearly stated as to leave no doubt of the President'!
views and policy.
SHE STATUS OFJREBET, LAWYERS
A motion has been filed in the United States Su
preme Court by A. 11. Garland, Esq.. of Arkansas, to
ue permitted to practice in the court without tak
ing the oath, as Prescribed by aem of Congress of
July 2, 1862, and January 2-1, 1860. The motion
will be argued probably to-day. The petitioner
sets forth a nylon, in due form, granted by the
President to him on the I,sth day of July, A. D.
1865, nnd contends: First, that the aet of Congress
prescribing this oath is unconstitutional upon its
face: second, thnt a? £r n it affects his status
in this court, it is palpably in violation of the
Constitution; third, that if it be not unconstitu
tional,'the pardon of ; e President restores him to
h rights as an attorney of thi.-: c ourt, notwithstand
ing the oath; and fourth, that as tho Uniied States,
through Congress, has collected revenue of him for
the privilege of being a lawynr, his right to >ractico
111 the courts of the United States follows, nt least,
so lur a* any obstacle thrown in the way by the oath
are concerned. Mr. Garland argues that the acts of
Congress referred tu are obnoxious to the objection;
that tho law i< retrospective in its operation and ef
fect It stamps certain nets ud deeds with a char
acter totally different from that whieh they were
when committed, and by new .principles, introduced
by its own terms, seeks to jettur right.? existing at the
time of its passage.
THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.
T. ('. Durant, the Vice President and General Man
ager of the Union Pacific Railroad, is now in Wash
ington making arrangements for the examination
and acceptance by Government Commissioners of the
first forty miles of the main line west of Omaha. —
Since the decision of the President approving tho
amended location of the line, the work has pro
gressed very rapidly.
COUNTERFEIT FRACTIONAL CURRENCY.
Two per cent of all the fractional currency received
at the Treasury is counterfeit. This comes to ihe
Department from bankers aud others deemed ex
perts in judging money, and two per cent escaping
the detection of such parties, gives some idea of the
extent of this kind of counterfeiting.
THE LATE BUTCHERY BY INDIANS ON THE PLAINS
The Commissioner of the Indian Bureau has just,
received a report from the Superintendent of In
dian Affairs, located at, Atchi >n, Kanas, giving
some additional particulars relative *.o the late at
tack by a band of Indians on a mail-coach crossing
the Plains, and the killing of a number of pas
sengers. Among the six passengers brutally mur
dered was Frederick Merivin, of New York city.
From tho best sources of information at the com
mand of the Superintendent, he belieres tho attack
to have been made by 1,500 Cheyennes, Arrapahoes
and Apaches, who, after the massacre, burned five
mail stations and drove away all the live stock in a
southerly direction.
The superintendent believes that the greater part
of those who committed the outrage belong to the
Ohevenne tribe, and that they were not present when
the recent treaty of peace between that tribe and the
United States was ratified. As this band is on its
way to join their tribe, tho superint ndent believes
that when they learn of the munificent provisions of
the treaty made with their tr bes by the United .States,
thev will be induced to cherish peaceful relations
with the Government.
FROM RRAZII*.
Tho End of tho War Near at Hand—Brazil
ian Currency—The Prospers of Emi
grants.
The following is an extract of a private letter, dated
Rio de Janeiro, Nov. 3,1865;
The war will close soon; the Paraguayans will be
well whipped; so well, I hope, as to leave the name
of their Lopez dynasty with history alone. Both sides
have fought courageously. The Paraguayans are
giving way fast.
The Brazilian currency, which suffered tho usual
run of the jobbers, hao revived, and exchange is now
27 pence to the milreis; the par being 27%: tbe empire
having effected a loan of about twenty-five million of
dollars, on very bad terms in England, and at the
same time settled its quarrel with that State.
You had better adviso nil American emigrants for
Brazil to stay at home. It is too costly and too pain
ful a process for .linerleans to learn, how supremely
superior their own country is to all others, even with
f /ic oppression* of which then complain so loudly.

THE OPENING "SCENES IN CONGRESS.
The following interesting and graphic description
of the scenes connected with the assembling of the
House of Representatives and the election of Speaker
is reproduced from the Washington correspondence
of the New York Tribune;
The floor is covered with a busy and merry throng,
as become? the first Congress after the war. As the
clerk ijuietiy trips up the side aisle a buzz of curiosity
runs through the multitude, for this middle-sized,
smooth-faced young man. with blue eyes, high fore
bead. and light, sunny hair, has a responsibility that
may change the destinies of America. It seem? to
rest easily a* he rolls over bis paperin a business-like
way and quickly raps on the desk as the minute hand I
touches 12. The busy audience separates, and, as we !
have the opinion of Mr. Colfax for believing it to be j
the ablest House in many years, we look at it with
some interest.
Thaddeus Stevens, who bears his 60years as though
they were -in. looks stern, grim and impassive.—
Schenek of (thin bends over htm, and. consido ing he
was a Yankee monitor in Baltimore,looks quite auii
ealde and harmless to-day. As John Sherman's com
petitor for the Senate he excites some attention.—
John Sherman seems quite easy, however, as he
stands near by returning the salutations of Senator
Harris, who looks as though he were low on a wool
sack, grave, earnest, majesties!, and Henry S. Lane,
of Indiana, who carries his never-absent cane, and
seems, like a Methodist exhorter, anxious to improve
the occasion. Banks quietly takes a ba"k seat, look
ing fresh and natty, rather grayer and more marked
than when he led the struggling party of freedom to
a Congressional victory nearly ten years ago. Mr.
Boutwell, his colleague, with a thoughtful, angular
face, ridged forehead, and a generally keen Boston
manner, enters into conversation with him.
Mr. Colfax, the prospective Speaker, is the center
of a group, and seems pleasant and hopeful, while
Mr. Washburne, the father of the House, as they call
him. smiles grimly upon his children. Bingham, of
Ohio, who looks like a fanatic, is conversing with
Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who does not; whilo Ros
coe Conkling, with a erewd of New Yorkers, is dis
cussing the iate election in that State.
The Clerk quietly begins to call the roll, and as he
passes. Tennessee, Maynard arises and endeavors to
interrupt him, that Tennessee niav be beard. The
request makes a hum, but nothing more, for the
Clerk declines to hear him. The call finished, and
again Maynard strives to gain a hearing, but Mr.
Morrill quickly trips him up by moving to proceed
to the election of Speaker. Again Maynard be
seeches, but the majority, under the head of the res
olute Stevens, insist upon order rather sternly.
Brooks arises to hi? feet, nnd, in a speech that reads
like an editorial of the P.cpress, informs the House
that unless it changes its course and throws open the
doors to the ninety panting, unreconstructed brethren
in gray, we might as well not have a country, which
the crowd listened to rather impatiently, although
Brooks becomes wild and declamatory. Altera tilt
with Stevens, which creates a shout of laughter, and
a remonstrance that makes Long John Wentworth so
angry that he continues his indignation to Mr. Orth,
of Indiana, Brooks yields, and Stevens, in his slow,
caustic, half-sardonic quietly forces his motion,
assisted bv the snappy, persistent, nervous Mr. Farns
worth. Mr. Johnson, a Pennsylvania Dutchman,
tries to stop the tide, but it rolls over him.
Maynard takes his hat and dissolves in the crowd,
and Mr. Morrill nominates Mr. Colfax. Mr. Winfield
nominates James Brooks, amid much good humor,
not malicious, but rather commiserating the New
Yorker's immense minority. All this has just, taken
thirty-three minutes. The call begins, and John B.
Alley answers "Schuyler Colfax." In this half hour
a resolute majority, calmly, without anger, with raro
good humor, indeed, quietly presents the disintegra
tions of the Republican party, and informs the unre
constructed in gray that the way to enter Con
gress is not to kick open the d?ors.
As Mr. Alley begins the roll, the scene is historical.
Tho galleries are crowded. The vacant spaces around
the members' scats are crammed with Senators, and
Judges, and Generals, and ail manner of people, si
lentand dense. Tho spell does not last long, for the
yeas roll up so rapidly that Mr. Colfax gets tired
marking his roll, and lean? over to converse with
Mr. Garfiebl. We improve the time to glance over
the scene, and feel that if there can be anything in
phrenology the present house is a remarkable body
of men. How the types of nationality mingle and
blend.
The Eastern delegations represent mentality; the
Western, strength: the Middle, discipline. Mr. Ste
vens has a most obedient, majority, and it votes and
acts as one man. The spirit of anxiety slowly passes
away, and by the time Sir. Colfax lakes the oath and
makes bis brief, earnest speeeh, and proceeds to the
practi-'al business of presiding, a business that sug
gests in its monotony aud giiones? the profession of
an auctioneer, th' 1 scene is over: the correspondents
bustle away: the galleries become hungry; the ladies
take wing, and the House goes on with the slowly
moving gabby business, called legislation.
IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS STOLEN.— On the22d of No
vember, a carper bag, belonging to Albert Pike, In
dian Commissioner under the Confedernto Govern
ment, containing manuscript copies of the various
treaties made by the Confederate Government (so
called; with 'he different Indian tribes, was stolen
from one of the car* on the Richmond, Fredericks
burg and Potomac Railroad, at tbe depot iu this city.
General Terrv has been directed to make diligent
search for the stolen documents.— Richmond Repub•

—After a sermon on Congregational Music,
Dr. Armitage, of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church,
on Sunday last set his congregation to laughing by
relating his experience inTreinont Temple, Boston.
He had heard of its choir of one hundred singers, and
the organ which required a steam engine to fill the
bellows—expected to hear something grand. Heard
a"jig! Gave out another hymn. Another jig! "I'll
fix you," h° said: "I'll give yon one that ean't be
sung to a dancing tune " ?o h- selected the hymn—
"From all that dwell below the skies
Let the Cheater's praise arise."
"Sing It to devil music if you can." he s id to himself
Sure >nough, another jigl "I went from Tremont
Temple as soon as possible," be said, "and have not
been there since, and to get me there again to have
my experience repeated would need a bigger steam
engine than the one that works their organ."
