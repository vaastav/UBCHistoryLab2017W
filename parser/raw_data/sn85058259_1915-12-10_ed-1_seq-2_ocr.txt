M J Not Hostile Rivals.
H Tho moral Is, that tho slates of Amor-
B leu are not hostllo rivals, but co-oper-
k ntlng friends, und that their growing
Jk. sense of community of Interest, alike In
k matters political and In matters cconom-
k Ic, Is likely to glvo them a new Hignlfl-
k rnnco as factors In International affairs
m. and In tho political history of tho world.
VMRBOi It present them as In a very deep nnd
H true sense u unit In world affairs, splr-
H Itunl partners, standing together becnuso
BBJ thinking- together, quick with common
BBJ sympathies and common Ideals. Separat-
BH fd. thoy are subject to all the cross cur-
BH rents of tho confused politics of a world
BBJ of hostllo rivalries; united In spirit and
PH purposo they cannot bo disappointed of
BH their peaceful destiny.
BH Tills Is I'an-Amerlcanlsm. It hns nono
BH of the spirit of empire In It. It Is tho em-
BH bodlmont, the effectual embodiment, of
BBJ the spirit of law nnd Independence und
BV liberty and mutual service.
BBJ There Is, I venture to point out, nn espe-
BBJ clnl slgnlflcunra Just now nttachlug to
BH this wholo inntter of drawing tho Amor-
BBJ leas togothor In bonds of honorable part-
BBJ ncrshlp nnd mutual udvantngo becuuso of
BBJ the cconomlo readjustments which tlio
BH world must tnevltnbly witness within the
BH noxt generation, whan poaco shall hnvo
BH st last resumed Its healthful tasks. In
BBJ the performance of theso tusks I bellevo
BBJ tho Americas to bo destined to piny their
BBJ parts together. I am Interested to fix
BBJ your attention on this prospect now bo-
BBJ enuso unless you take It within your
BBJ view nnd permit tho full significance of
BBp It to command your thought I cannot
BBJ find the tight light In which to sot forth
BH tho particular matter that lies at tlio
BBJ very front of my wholo thought as I ad-
BJ dress you today. 1 mean national do
BBJ H Might to Maintain Right.
M Out of such thoughts grow all our poll-
BBJ rles. Wo regard war merely ub a means
BBJ of asserting tho rights of n peoplo against
BBJ aggression. And we are ns fiercely Joal-
BBJ ous of coercive or dictatorial power with-
BBJ In our own nation ns of nggresslon from
BBJ without. Wo will not maintain n stand-
BBJ Ing army except for uses which are us
BBJ necessury In times of peace as In times
BBJ of war; and wo shall always cu to It
BBJ that our mllltnry peace establishment Is
BBJ . no longer than Is uctunlly and continuous-
BBJ ly needed for tho usa of days In which
BBJ no enemies move agnlnst us. nut wo
BBJ do believe In a body of free citizens ready
BBJ and sufficient to take cure of themselves
BBJ und of the governments which they hnvo
BBJ set up to serve them. In our constitutions
BBJ themselves wo have commanded that "the
BBJ right of the peoplo to keep nnd benr
BBJ arms shall not be Infringed," and our
BBJ confidence has been that our safety In
BBJ times of danger would llo In the rising of
BBJ the nntlon to take care of Itself, as the
BBJ farmers icso at Lexington.
Br' N nut war '"ls never tjcen a rnere matter
BH of men nnd guns. It Is a thing of disci-
BH pllned might. If our citizens are ever to
BH fight effectively upon a sudden summons,
BBJ they must know how modern fighting Is
BH done, and what to do when the summons
BBJ comes to rentier themselves Immediately
BBJ nvallable nnd Immediately effective. And
BH the government must be their servant In
BBJ this matter, must supply them with the
BBJ training they need to take cure of them-
BJ selves and of It. The mllltnry arm of their
BH government, which they will not allow to
BBJ direct them, they may properly use to
BBJ serve them and make their Independence
BH secure and not their own Independence
BBJ merely but the rights nlso of those with
BBJ whom they nave made common causo,
BH should they also be put In Jeopardy
BBJ They must be fitted to play the grent
PPJ role In the world, nnd particularly In this
PPJ hemisphere, for which they are quail-
BBS fled by principle and by chastened ninbl-
BBBj tlon to pluv
BBB It Is with these Ideals In mind that tho
Bpfll plans of the department of war for more
BH adequate national defense were conceived
PH which will be laid before you, und which
BN I urge you to sanction nnd put Into of-
BBw feet as soon ns they can be properly scru-
BBEH tlulzed und discussed Tliey seem to me

Force of Trained Citizens'.
Ily way of mnklng tho country ready
to assert somo part of Its real power
promptly nnd upon a lurger scnlc, should
occasion arlso, tho plan nlso contemplates
supplementing tho nrmy by n forco of
400,000 disciplined citizens, raised In Incre
ments of 133,000 a year throughout a po
rlod of thrco yenrs. This It Is proposed
to do by a process of enlistment under
which the serviceable men of tho coun
try would bo asked to bind thomsolves to
servo with thn colors for purposes of
training for short periods throughout
thrco yenrs, nnd to como to tho colors
at call at any tlmo throughout nn addi
tional "furlough" period of three yenrs,
This forco of 400,000 men would bo pro
vided with personnl accoutrements nn fust
ns enlisted nnd their equipment for the
field made ready to bo supplied at nny
time. They would be nsscmbled for train
ing nt stntcd Intervnli nt convenient
places In association with suitable units
of tho regular army. Their period of
annunl trnlnlng would not necessarily ex
ceed two months In tho year.
It would dopend upon the patriotic feel
ing of the younger men of tho country
whether thoy responded to such a call
to service or not. It would depend upon
the patriotic spirit ot the employers of
tho country whether they mndo It possl
blo for the younger men In their em
ploy to respond under favorable condi
tions or not. I, for one, do not doubt
the patriotic devotion cither of our young
men or of thoso who glvo them employ
mentthose for wholo benefit und protec
tion they would In fuct enlist. I would
look fnrwnrd to the success of such nn
experiment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely Imperative now. Wo cannot do
less.
Program for the Navy.
The program to be laid beforo you con
templates the construction within five
yenrs of 10 battleships, 6 battle cruis
ers, 10 scout cruisers, CO destroyers, 15
Hoot submarines, S5 const submarines,
four gunbonts, one hospital ship, two
ammunition ships, two fuel-oil ships nnd
ono repair ship. It ls proposed Hint of
this number wo shall tho first year pro
vide for tho construction of two bnttlo
ships, two bnttlo cruisers, threo scout
cruisers, 15 destroyers, five fleet subma
rines, 25 coast submarines, two gunbonts,
and ono hospital ship; the second year,
two battleships, ono scout cruiser, ten
destroyers, four lloet submarines, 15 coast
submarines, ono gunboat, and ono fuel
oil ship; tho third year, two battleships,
one battle cruiser two scout cruisers, five
destroyers, two fleet submarines, and 15
const submarines', the fourth year, two
battleships, two battle cruisers, two
scout cruisers, ten desttoyors, two fleet
bubmurlncs 15 roast submarines, one am
munition ship, und ono fuel-oil ship; nnd
the fifth your, two battleships, one buttle
cruiser, two scout crulscro, ten destroy
ers, two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma
rines, ono gunboat, ono ammunition ship
nnd one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
nlso for tho Immedlnto addition to the
personnel of tho nnvy of 7,500 sailors,
2.5CO apprentice seamen, und 1,500 marines
This Increnso would be sulllclent to care
for tho ships which are to be completed
within tho llscnl year 1917 und nlso for
tho number of men which must bo put In
trnlnlng to man the ships which will be
completed early In 1918. It Is nlso neces
sary that the number of midshipmen at
the naval academy at Annapolis should
bo Increased by nt least 300 In order that
the force of ofllcern should bo more rap
idly added to: and authority Is asked to
appoint for engineering duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
nnd tor service In the aviation corps n
certnln number of men taken from civil
life.
ZI this full program should bo carried
out we should have built or building In
1921, according to the estimates of' surviv
al and standards of clusslllcutlon followed
by the general board of the department,
'an effoctlve navy consisting of 27 bnttlo
ships of the first line, six battle cruisers,
25 battleships of the second line, ten ar
mored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, five
first-class crulrers, threo second-class
cruisers, ten third-class cruisers, 10S de
troyers, 18 lleut submarines, 157 const sub
marines, six monitors, 20 gunbontB, four
supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four trans
orts, three tenders to torpedo vessels,
eight vessels of special types, und two
ammunition whips, This would be a navy
fitted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions.
Trade and Shipping.
nut nrmles und Instruments of wnr are
only pntt of what hns to be considered
If we are to consider the supremo matter
of national self-sufllclency and security
In nil Its aspects There aro other great
mutters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There
ls, for example, a very pressing question
of trnde und shipping Involved In this
great pioblem of notional ndequney. It
Is neeetisary for many weighty reusons of
women grown far Into tho yearB, for
oxatnple, and yet who have maintained
their communion of dreams ami con
fidences unbrokon and unspoiled.
There 1b little more refreshing to con
template than friendships between
middle-aged or old men that have ex
isted In strength and harmony from
boyhood days. Other friendships hnvo
these folks of tho passing generation,
some of them true, some of them
tried, but none of them as richly re
garded and highly treasured as the
old oucb. For nccoBsarlty there are
national efTlclency nnd development that
wo should have a grent merchant ma
rine. The greut merchant fleet we once
used to make us rich, that great body ot
sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag
Into every sen, nnd who wero tho pride
nnd often the bulwark of tho nation, we
have nlmost driven out of existence by
Inexcusable neglect nnd Indifference nnd
by a hopelessly blind and provincial pol
icy of so-called economic protection. It
Is high time we repaired our mistake nnd
resumed our commercial Independence on
the sens,
Kor It Is n question of Independence.
If other tuitions go to wnr or seek to
bumper each other's commerce, our mer
chants, It seems, nro at their mercy,
to do with as thoy please. Wo must use
their ships, and use them ns they deter
mine. Wo have not ships enough of our
own. Wo ennnot hnndlo our own com
merce on the sens. Our Independence Is
provincial, nnd Is only on land nnd with
in our own borders. Wo nro not likely
to bo permitted to use oven the ships of
other nations In rivalry of their own
trnde, nnd nre without means to extend
our commerce even where the doors nro
wide open nnd our goods desired, fiueh
a situation Is not to be endured. It Is
of capital Importance not only that tho
United States should be Its own carrier
on tho seus nnd enjoy tho economic In
dependence which only nn ndequato mer
chant mnrlno would glvo It, but nlso that
tho American hemisphere as n wholo
should enjoy a like Independence nnd self
sufllclency, If It Is not to be drnwn Into
tho tnnglo of European nffnlrs, Without
such Independence the wholo question of
our political unity nnd self-dctormlnntlon
!s very seriously clouded nnd complicated
Indeed,
Moreover, we ran develop no true or ef
fective Atnerlcnn policy without ships of
our own not ships of wnr, but ships of
pence, carrying goods nnd currying much
more: creating friendships nnd render
ing Indispensable services to all Interests
on this side of tho water. Thoy must
move constantly back and forth between
the Americas, They nro the only shuttles
that enn wenvc the delicate fabric ot
sympathy, comprehension, confidence nnd
mutual, dciictvdcnco In which we clothe
our policy of America for Americans,
en i pa are neeaea.
With a view to meeting these pressing
necessities of our commcrco and avnlllng
ourselves nt the earliest possible moment
of tho presont unparalleled opportunity of
linking tho two Amerlcns togothor In
bonds of mutual Interest nnd scrvlco, an
opportunity which tuny novor return
again If we miss It now, proposals will
be tnado to tho present congress for tho
purchase or construction of ships to bo
owned nnd directed by tho government
slmllnr to thoso made to the last con
gress, but modified In somo essential par
ticulars. I recommend theso proposals
to you for your prompt acccptanco with
tho more confldenco becnuso every month
that has elapsed slnco the former pro
posals were mndo has made the necessity
for such action more and more mani
festly Imperative
Question of Finance.
The plans for tho nrmed forces of the
nation which I have outlined, and for
tho general policy of adequato prepara
tion for mobilization and defense, In
volve of courso very largo additional ex
penditures of money expenditures which
will considerably exceed the estimated
revenues ot the government. It Is made
my duty by law, wr.-nevcr the estimates
of expenditure exceed the cstlmntes of
revenue to call the attention of the con
gress to tho fact and suggest any means
of meeting tho deficiency that It may be
wso or possible for me to suggest. 1 am
ready to believe that It would be my duty
to do so In any cubo; und I feel particu
larly bound to speak of tho matter when
It appears that tho deficiency will arlso
directly out of the adoption by the con
gress of measures which I myself urge
It to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to
speak briefly of the present state of tho
troasury nnd of the fiscal problems
which tho next year will probably- dls
closn. On tho thirtieth of Juno last there was
an nvatlablo balanco In the gcncrnl fund
of tho treusury of JIOt,170,10o.78. Tho to
tal estimated receipts for tho year 1916,
on tho assumption that tho emergency
revenue measure passed by tho last con
gress will not bo extended beyond Its
present limit, the thirty-first of Decom
her, 1915. nnd that tho present duty of
ono cent per pound on sugar will be dis
continued after tho first of May, 1916,
will bo $670,365,500. Tho balance of Juno
Inst and theso estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand totnl of J774.535.C05.78.
The total ostlmated disbursements for tho
present fiscal year. Including S25.000.000
for thu Panama cnnnl. J12.000.000 for prob
able deficiency appropriations and $50,
000 for miscellaneous debt redemptions,
will bo J753,S9),000: nnd tho balance In the
general fund of tho treusury will bo re
ducod to J20.6H, S05.78. Tho emergency
revenue act. If continued beyond Its pres
ent tlmo llmltntlon, would produce, dur
ing tho half year then remnlnlng, about
forty-one millions. Tho duty of one cent
per pound on sugar, If continued, would
produce during the two months of the
fiscal yenr temnlnlng after the first "of
May, about fifteen millions. Theso two
sums, amounting together to J56,O00,O00,
If ad led to the revenues of the second
half of the fiscal yenr, would yield the
treasury at tho end of the yenr an avail
nblo bnlnnce of J76.C4t.605.78.
Tho additional revenues required to
nrry out the program of military nnd
naval preparation of which I have spok
en, would, as at present estimated, bo
for the fiscal year 1917, J93.S00.0OO JIhoso
figures, tnken with the figures for tho
presont fiscal yenr which I have already
given, disclose our ttnanclnl problem for
the year 1917.
How Bhull wo obtain the new revenue?
It seems to mo n clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank flnnnce
thut In what we are now, I hope, about
to undertuke we should pay as we go.
The people of the country nro entitled to
know Just what burdens of taxation they
are to carry, and to know from tho outset,
now. The new bills should be paid by In
ternal taxation,
To whnt sources, then, shall we turn?
We would bo following nn nlmost uni
versal example of modern governments
If we were to draw the greater part or
even the whole of the revenues we need
from tho Income tuxes. Xly somewhat
lowering the present limits of exemption
nnd the figure at which the surtax shall
begin to be Imposed, and by Increasing,
step by ntep throughout the present grad
uation, the surtax Itself, the Income tnxes
as at present apportioned would yield
sums suftlclent to bnlnnce the books of
tho treusury at the end of the flscul year
1917 without anywhere making the bur
den unreasonably or oppressively heavy.
The precise reckonings nre fully nnd nc--urntely
set out In tho report of the sec
retary of the treasury, which will be Itn
mediately laid beforo you.
And there are tunny additional sources
many things that occur In a lifetime
which Jar or disturb us, which give a
different turn to our tastes and dispo
sition, which introduce changing elo
montB and predilections Into the prob
lems ot tho day and times of the
present and futuro can never bo tho
same as In the long ago. Yet tho old
friends romaln, possibly1 not In the
samo neighborhood or community,
nor In the samo part of the country
Dut thoy are evor within the boun
daries of our spiritual vision and they
are enshrined In the sauctvary rf the
of revenue which eanOustly be resorted
to without hampering tho Industries of
tho country or putting any too great
charge upon Individual expenditure. A
one per cent tax per gallon on gasoltnft
nnd nnptlm would yield, at the present
estimated production, J10,000,000j a tax of
W cents per horsepower en automobiles
and lntcrnnt explosion engines, JIS.OOO.OOO.
n stamp tax on bank checks, probably
$18,000,000; a tnx of 25 conts per ton or,
pig Iron, $10,000,000, a tax of 50 cents per
ton on fnbrlcatcd Iron nnd steel, proba
bly $10,000,000, In a country of great In
dustries llko this It &ught to bo easy te
distribute the burdens of taxation with
out molting them nnywhere bear too
heavily or too exclusively upon nny one
sot of persons or undertakings. What Is
clear Is. that the Industry of this gener
ation should puy the bills of this genera
tion. The Danger Within.
I have spoken to you todny, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, tho thorough prep
aration of tho nntlon to care for Its
own security nnd to mnke sure of entire
freedom to play the. Impartial role In this
hemisphere nnd in the world which we
nil believe to huvo been providentially
assigned to it, I hnvo had In mind no
thought of nny immediate or particular
dnnger arising out of our relations with
other nations. We aro at peace with all
the nations of the world, nnd there is
reason to hope thnt no question In con
troversy between this nnd other govern
ments will lend to any serious breach of
nmicnblo relations, grave ns somo differ
ences of nttltude und policy havo bcon
nnd mny yet turn out to be. 1 nm sorry
to sny thnt tho gravest threats agnlnst
our national pence nnd snfety hove been
uttered within our own borders. Thcro are
citizens of the United States, I blush to
ndmlt, born under other lings but welcomed
under our generous naturalization laws
to tho full freedom and opportunity of
Amerlcn, who havo poured the poison of
dlsloynlty Into tho very arteries of our
nntlonnl llfo; who hnvo sought to bring
the authority nnd good nnmo of our gov
ernment into contempt, to destroy our in
dustries wherever thoy thought it effec
tive for their vindictive purposes to strike
at them, nnd to' debase our politics to thn
uses of foreign Intrigue. Their number
Is not greut as compared with tho whole
number of thoso sturdy hosts by which
our notion has been enriched In recent
goncrnllons out of virile foreign stocks;
but It 1b grent enough to havo brought
docp disgrace upon us and to hnvo mudo
It necessary that wo should promptly
make use of processes of law by which
wo may bo purged of their corrupt dis
tempers. America never witnessed nny
thing like this before. It nover dreamed
It possible that men sworn Into Its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great free
stocks such as supplied some of tho best
and strongest elements of thnt little, but
how heroic, nation that In n high day of old
staked Its very llfo to free Itself from
every entanglement that had darkened
tho fortunes of the older nations and sot
up a new standard here that men of such
origins und such frco choices of allegi
ance would evor turn In malign reaction
against tho government nnd people who
had welcomed and nurtured them and
seek to mako this proud country once
.r.ro a hotbed of Kuropcnn passion. A
llttlo while ago such a thing would havo
seemed Incredible. Decauso It was In
credlblo we made no preparation for It.
We would have been almost ashamed to
preparo for It, as if we were suspicious
of ourselves, our own comrades and
nelgnborsl Hut tho ugly and IncrodlbU
has actually come about and wo are with
out adequate .federal laws to deal with
it. I urge you to ennct such laws at
the earliest possible moment nnd feel that
in so doing I nm urging you to do noth
ing less than save the honor and self
respect of the nation.
Must Be Crushed Out.
Such creatures of passion, disloyalty
nnd anarchy must bo crushed out. They
are not many, but they are Infinitely ma.
llgnant, and the hand of our power should
closo over them nt once. They have
formed plots to destroy property, they
havo entered Into conspiracies against th
neutrality of tho government, they have
sought to pry Into every confidential
transaction of tho government In order
to servo Interests alien to our own. It In
possible to deal with theso things very
effectually. I need not suggest the terms
In which they may bo dealt with.
I wish that It could bo said thut only a
few men, misled by mistaken sentiment
of nlleglanco to the governments untlci
which thoy wore born, nnd been guilty ol
disturbing tho self-possession nnd l3rcp
resenting the temper and principles of
the country during these days of terrible
war, when It wouid seem that ovory man
who was ttuly nn American would In
stinctively mnke It his duty nnd his pride,
to keep tho scnles of Judgment even nnd
provo himself a partisan of no nntlon but
his own. Hut It ennnot. Thcro nro somt
men nmong us, nnd ninny resident abroad
who, though born nnd bred in the Unit
ed Stntes nnd culling themselves Amer
icans, hnvo so forgotten themslves und
their honor ns citizens as to put theh
passlounte sympathy with one or the oth
er side in tho grent Kuropcnn conflict
ubovo their rcgurd for tho peace nnd dig
nlty of the United Stntes. Thoy nlso
prench nnd prnctlra disloyalty. No lows,
I suppose, can rench corruptions of thu
mind and heart; but I should not speak,
of others without also speaking of those
nnd expressing tho even deeper humilia
tion nnd scorn which every self-possessed
nnd thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them nnd of tin
discredit they nre dally bringing upon us
Transportation Problem.
The transportation problem Is nn ex
ceedingly serious und pressing one In this
country. There bus from tlmo to time
of late been renson to four thnt our rull
roads would not much longer be able tc
cope with It successfully ns at present
equipped and co-ordlnntcd. I suggest
that It would be wise to provide for 0
commission of Inquiry to nscertuln by n
thorough canvass of thu whole question
whether our laws us nt present framed
and administered aro as serviceable nt
thoy might be In the solution of tho prob
lem. It Is obviously n problem thnt llet
ut the very foundation of our eftlclonc.v
ns a people Such an Inquiry ought tc
draw out every circumstance nnd opinion
worth considering nnd we need to know
i.ll sides of the mutter if we nio'in to
do anything In the field of federal legisla
tion. For whnt we nie seeking now, whnt In
my mind Is the single thought of this
message. Is national efficiency and se
curity. We serve a greut nation We
should serve It in the spirit of Its pecullni
genius. It Is the genius of common men
for Self-government Industry, Justice, lib
erty nnd pcare We should see to It that
It Incks no Instrument, no facility or vigor
of Inw, to make it ruffli-lent to pluy Its
purl with energy, safety, und ussured
success. In this we nre nonpartisans bui
berulds nnd prophets of n new nge.
heart. Without them we should be
lonesome In a crowd, and sometimes
should feel as If wo had been aban
doned, though surroimded by our own
household nnd loved ones Old
friends, In brlof, havo a niche all their
own, n position in our affections pe
culiar onl to them, which no nllon In
