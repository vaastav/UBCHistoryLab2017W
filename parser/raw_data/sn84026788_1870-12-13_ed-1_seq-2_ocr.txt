We publish to-day a petition which has
Seen put in circulation for signature by the
people of tho county, for the removal of the
county seat back to Charlestown. We suppose
every one who rccognizes the injustice that
was done by the change which transferred the
seat of the county government from this
plnee to the present location, will not hesitate
to affix his namo to this paper, and actively
employ whatever influence he may wield to
hrduce others to do the same thing. The
propriety of the action proposed is so appa
rent that it is very difficult to present argu?
ment in its favor, beyond the mere statement
of the case itself. The facts are so few and
so simple, and all tend so irresistibly to one
oonolusten, that when the case is stated it hag
been fully argued, and there in nothing more
to be said about it. The petition to which
wo have called attention, it seems to us, con
tains all that should bo required to satisfy any
fair mind that the legislative action solicited
should be granted. It informs tho Legisla
ture of the State that, without any consulta*
tion with the people of the connty?during
the pondency of the war, and contrary to their
known wishes?the county seat was changed
from Charlestown, where it was originally lo
cated and where for more than sixty years,
and from the very foundation of the county,
it had been established?a point near the
geographical centre of the county, and enjoy
ing the advantages of a railroad and tho con
vergence of nearly all the turnpikes and main
roads of the county?to Shepherdstown, on
the Northern boundary of the county, inac
cessible to travel, and subjecting to great in
convenience eight-tenths of the people of the
county.
The petition furtherscts forth that the pub
lic property, which was originally dedicated
to the public uses, still remains, and could,
by the expenditure of a much less sum than
would bo required at any other convenient
point, be reoccupied as the county seat.
It seems to us that but little, if anything
more need bo said on the subject, although
we arc aware that there are objections urged
to the proposed action. These we will notice
in a subsequent number of our paper, and we
think that wo will be able to show that "they
are trifles light as air," compared with the
weighty considerations for the change, which
are briefly sot forth in the paper to which at
tention has been called.
VIRGINIA, vs. WEST VIRGINIA,
The question of the right of Virginia to
jurisdiction over the counties of Jefferson and
.Berkeley, will be argued before the Supremo
Court of the United States in February nest,
and as we arc not aware of anything that can
be accomplished by newspaper articles on the
subject, we drop it for the present. The case
is in the hands of the judiciary and not of the
public press, and will beyond doubt bo deci
ded without regard to flaming editorials or
anonymous contributions, either pro or con.

Tlie President's Message.
Comments of the Pi ess.
From ths Waafiingtcn Patriot.
Wo expected little from General Grant, and
have not been disappointed in the tedious and
disjointed document which he communicated
to Congress yasterday. It is manifestly tho
production of several inferior minds, and has
no dominating thought, nor even common fe
licity of expression, to relieve its dullness.?
As a mere literary production it falls far be
low the level of mediocrity, and, as a State
paper, it descredits the dignity of our docu
mentary history. Like its putative author, it
will only be remembered hereafter in the
dreary chronology of the partisan times.
Frotn the New York World.
So fur as this message deviates from com
monplace and dull historical statement, it de
viates into extravnsrancc. '-He who forsakes
the probable." says some critic, "will easily
find the marvelous." The statesman who lets
?ro his hold on common sense will have no dif
ficulty in hitting upon something odd. It re
quired a genius like Grant to discover that
the true way to settle the Alabama claims is
to pay them ourselves; that to relieve our
fishermen we must cripple our railroads ; that
a treaty which has been rejected by the Sen
ate can be replaced by another trent>/ negotia
ted by commissioners authorized by Congress,
and that this second treat)/ can he made valid
without ratification by tho Senate! Was there
ever such another bundle of crudities ?
From the N. Y. Tribune.
The President's summing up of the leading
objects of his policy, and especially his desire
to sceure "a pura untrammeled ballot." must
appeal cogently to the judgment and affections
of the American people. lie is abraham Lin
coln's lineal successor, and tho popular heart
beats in unison with his aspirations and his
efforts
From the N. Y. Timee.
The message transmitted yesterday by the
President to Congress is tho best answer to
those who insist that tho mission of the Ile
publican party is ended, or who impugn Gen
eral Grant's fitness for interpreting the wishes
and promoting the interests of the people.?
Tho policy set forth is at once positive and
practical.
From the New York Herald.
It is a good State paper and a staunch party
platform.
From the N. Y. Herald (Wash. Corrcapomiencc.)
The President's message is the absorbing
subject of conversation in Washington to night.
So far as can be ascertained from the criticism
it receives, it is regarded as able and adroit.
Takcu as a whole it is generally commended,
especially so by the Republicans, but disap
pointment is expressed that the President said
so much upon points which it is thought
f-boulu have had little more than a passing
reference, and said so little upon others which
tire deemed of more vital iuterest and impor
tance.
Frroi the Nf.w York Sun.
The first thought that occurs to one after
reading the message is that it is a poverty
stricken document. It tells us much that we
already knew, but leaves us in the dark on
subjects about which we would like to be in
formed.

Meeting of the Virginia Legislature
Governor's Message.
Richmond, December 7.?The Legislature
met this morning, and the message of Gov
ernor Walker was read. Ho says: Never
before, in the nistory of the Commonwealth,
has a Legislature assembled upon which de
volved graver responsibilities than upoo you.
On the finances, he reiterates his views ex
pressed in his inaugural on the 8th of March
last. He is strengthened in the correctness
of the recommendations then made, and says
they have been heartily endorsed by the best
financiers both in this country and England.
Had the Legislature promptly adopted them
the State debt would have been reduced over
ten millions of dollars, and the depreciated
credit advanced from fifty to Dinety cents on
the dollar. In regare to the settlement of the
debt betweep Virginia and West Virginia, he
says the obvious meaning and intent of all
legislation on this subject by each State is that
what amount the State of West Virginia ought
to assume should be paid into the Treasury of
the State of Virginia, to be by her used in the
extinguishment of the original debt.
The bonds arc the bonds of Virginia, not of
West Virginia, and to theTrcasury of Virginia
do the creditors look for the payment of their
debts. There is but one sovereign remedy
for the financial evil that afflicts us. and, in
his opinion, that remedy is a strict fulfilment
of our solemn obligations. The better course
to be pursued is for both States to submit the
whole question to arbitration. If all your
honorable means fail, you have but one remedy
left you?the Supremo Court of the United
States.
On the organization of the State militia he
speaks at groat length, and says that if, in the
late municipal difficulties, he had had control
of a single eompauy of well organized and
equipped militia, the Executive would have
been enabled to have quelled that disgraceful
and most unjustifiable insurrection agaiust the
laws of the Commonwealth.
In regard to certain farms in tidewater Vir
ginia, and on which, after the war, by au
thority of the Freedman's Bureau, a larce
number of colored people had settled, and for
whoso removal a military force had become
necessary, the Governor is pointed. A de
tachment of troops which had been sent by
General Barry from Fortress Monroe, to as
sist the Sheriff of Norfolk county, was, with
out any explanation, recalled. Ho says: I
feel bound to say, in view of the circum
stances, the sudden withdrawal of thc3e troops,
endangering the lives of our officers and citi
zens and the peace of the community, was, in
my opinion, an act of official discourtesy and
a manifestation of indifference of the gravest
character, without a parallel in the history of
this couutry.
He also disconrscs on the subject of the
boundary line of the State ; od the peniten
tiary, and concludes in the following char
acteristic style :
"In obedience to law, in the maintenance
of order and the performance of all the duties
appertaining to good citizenship, the people of
Virginia challenge comparison with any State
in the Union, Everywhere within the broad
limits of the Commonwealth every citizen is
safe with his life, liberty and pursuit of happi
ness. .
Emerging trom the terrible ordeal 01 a lour
years' baptism of blood, stripped of everything
save incorrupt honor, the peopie of this Com
monwealth have airain resumed their place in
the Uniou of their fathers, with an earnest
purpose and a fixed determination to fulfil all
the obligations of American citizens. Moro
cannot be required of them ; less they will not
perform.
Tho Word White.
A very striking illustration of the immo
vable attachment of the people to the word
"rr/life," and at the same time an unmistak
abcle proof of the correctness of the Demo
cratic doctrine, are furnished in the resnlt of
the rcccnt election in Michigan. When that
State was organized. Democratic views were
in the ascendant, and as in the case of Penn
sylvania, a provision was inserted in the Con
stitution confining the suffrage to white peo
ple. At the late election an amendment was
voted on to strike out that provision, so as to
make the organic law of the State accord with
the celebrated Fifteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, but the
amendment was voted down and tho word
lr/iilc was left standing by a majority of three
thousand. AVhen it is remembered that Mich
igan is a decidedly Radical State, this action
of her people, while it evinces their good taste
and judgment., and furnishes an emphatic
tribute to the justness of Democratic ideas,
must by the Radicals. be regarded as tho "most
unkindest cut of all." And what is to be
done? Tho people of Michitrail, though
Radical to the core, are opposed to negro suf
frage, and have setup their State Constitution
in the face of the amended Constitution of
the United States,?Pittsburg 1'uprr.
JUS" Some idea of the dreadful carnage of
the late civil war may be inferred from the
fact stated officially that the bodies of 312,
515 dead soldiers have been collected and
interred at national expense. In addition to
these there are many thousands whose bodies
were taken home and buried by their familicsi
and probably thousands moro whose names
swelled the list of the "missing" after the
battle. It is scarcely an extravagant estimate
which places upon the muster roll of the Fed
eral dead 500.000 men. IIow much can be
said for the geueralship of tho leader who lost
more soldiers than his enemy commanded ?
SSy* A writer from St. Petersburg says that
a war-like feeling prevails throughout the
Russian Empire. It is remarked that Russia
is committed to a bold line of conduct, and
is resolved to carry it out despite all oppo
sition. A feeling of universal joy was created
at Sebistopol on the receipt of the news of
GortschakofT's circular.

FBANCE AND PRUSSIA.
From the condensed news column of the
Baltimore Gazette, we make up the following
summary :?
?Wednesday's news.
Official reports have been received by the
Government at Tours, From Paris in relation
to the operations of General Dderot. Accounts
of successes by the French troops had created
the wildest enthusiasm in the city. It was
claimed that, after losing fifteen or twenty
thousand men in the contests at Champigny
and in front of Villiers, the Prussians were so
much weakened that they suffered the French
to cross the Marne unopposed.
The King of Prussia has telegraphed the
Queen, under date Versailles, Suudav mid
night, that after two day's fighting the St.
Jean Railway Stalon, a suburb ol Orleans, with
thirty guns and one thousand prisoners, had
bean captured with "moderate loss" by the
Prussians.
THURSDAY'S NEWS.
In the late battles before Orleans it ap
pears that the Prussians attacked each corps
d'armee in superior force, thus feptflsitig the
Army of the Loire, turning the position so as
to render the evacuation of the city necessary.
General Paladines retreated with a force
thought to be two hundred thousand strong,
having Gve hundred catinon. It is stated that
he fought to the utmost, but was powerless to
effect anything, But few prisoners were cap
tured by the Prussians, and no ammunition.
News has been received at Tours, by balloon t
from Paris, to tho 4th, which goes to confirm
previous favorable accounts of the state of af
fairs there. The morale of the troops is spo
ken of as being excellent. Trochu, in a pub
lished statement of the late operations, claims
that the Prussians were repulsed, without ef
fecting their objects, both at Villiers and
Cham pinny, and also at Nojrent; that General
Ducrot bivouacked at Vincennes on the night
of the 3d.
Prince Goorge telegraphs to the King of
Saxony that further offensive movements on
the part of the besieged Parisians were im?
possible. The total loss of the Saxons was
seventy-six officers and twenty one hundred
men.
Friday's news.
The King of Prussia has telegraphed the
Queen that the city of Orleans was occupied
by his forces on the night of the 4th, without
being stormed. A flag of truce, announcing
the capture of Orleans and the rout of the
Army of the Loire, has been sent into Paris
by the Prussians.
The main body of General Ducrot's army is
reported to be in position at Gretell, between
the Seine and Marne. protected by the 2tins
of Fort Charenton. The Army of the Loire
is on the left bank of the river, seeking to ef
fect a junction with the Ariny of the Fast,
reported as beitiir <30.000 strong. This effect
ed. it is proposed that tho combined army
shall move towards Fontainbleau.
SATURDAY'S NEWS.
A despatch frnm Tours says that Govern
ment lias declared that its reverses were of
only temporary importance, that the Army of
tile Loire Was at its old quarters, and that the
evacuation of (Jrleans was caused by the de
moralization of some new troops and the mis
taken strategy and indecision of General Pa
ladines
King William has written to his Queen
confirming the capture, by him, of ten thou
sand prisoners seventy seven cannon, and four
1 gun boats at Orleans. Gidy and Jauney had

William has accepted tho title of Emperor of
Germany. Great enthusiasm prevailed in

in which he invites all the German Princes
to urge the King of Prussia to assume the Im
perial title united with the Presidental func
tions.
Monday's news.

A Buried Woman Comes to Life.
We are indebted to A. E. Steinmetz, of this
city, for particulars of a case id real life, which,
in the elements of the marvelous, is Tally
equal to the productions of the story writers,
and furnishes another substantiation of the
fruism, that "truth is stranger than fiction."
A young lady about 20yearsof age?Margaret
Anderson, by name?catne to this city about
a year ago; she came with a company of rela
tives and friends from Denmark, and lived
here until about the first of July last. The
male members of the family found employ
ment on the line of the Union Pacific Road,
and found it convenient to remove their domi
cile nearer to the place of their work j conse
quently, n part of the family tuoved out to Big
Springs station, on the Pacific Road, and
among those who went was Margaret. Hero
**ery7hing Went on pleasabtfy, till about the
1st of September, when Margaret was taken
sick, and after a severe illness of about two
weeks, she bade them tiood-by. and her spirit
took its Sight to that bourne whence no tral
eler returns. At least, so the situation pre
sented itself to her sorrowing friends, and to
all human appearances nobody was evermore
really dead, and no case more hopelessly "past
all surgery." The same day that she died,
the frinds at Dig Springs wrote to the rela
tives in this city, giving particulars of her
sickness and death. On the second day after
she had apparently breathed her last, a rude
colli? was provided, and the friends concluded
that the remains should be temporarily interred
upon the prairie until such time as would be
more convenient to take them to a permanent
resting place.
I5ig Springs is simply a watering station on
the Pacifiic Road?there is no settlement at
the piece and nobody lives there but those em
ployed by the company, consequently the last
sad ri'es had to be performed by tlie members
o1' her own family, and her body was laid to
rest by,the hands of solffo#(ng ffieirds. But
just as the coffin had been lowered to its rest
ing place, and a few shovelsfull of earth thrown
into the grave, an approaching train called the
burial party to duty at the station. After an
absence of an hour, the men returned to the
grave, and as they were about to resume work
with their shovels, they heard a noise in the
partially buried coffiiu, giving evidence of
kicking and pounding, and as may be supposed
after recovering from their fright, the men lost
do time in uncovering and opening the coffin,
to see what had disturbed the dead woman's
rest. The remainder of the story may be bet
ter imagined than described. Suffice it to say
that Margaret's friends and relatives in this
city, who had mourned her as dead, have just
received a letter written by her own hand,
giving the story in detail and rejoicing over
her narrow escape from being buried alive.

THE undersigned, citizens of JcfFerson Counfv,
respectfully represent to your Honorable Hotly
that during (he pendency of the late war their coun
ty scat was, by an Act of the Legislature of West
Virginia, removed frofn CharlestoWn, tbe place of
its original location, to Shepherd-town, on the line
of the Northern boundary of the county, remote
troin a larg-e maj<>i ity ot f he people of the county,
and most difficult of access.
We pray your Honorable llody to re establish the
county seat at Chdrlestown which, at the orfrnn'sn*
tion of the county?more than seventy years atro?
was then selected as being neaf its gCitjfraphtcal
centre and which has al^o sinre become the centre
of the system of turnpikes and main rn?ds con
structed for the convcnicnce of the people of all parts
of the county
Its situation, moreover, on the Winrhester and
Potomac. Railroad, which connects with the Haiti
more and Ohio Railroad?both of which traverse a
large portion of the county?makes it a point of
easy approach by rail. whilst the public property,
dedicated to the uses of thecounty at its foundation,
iuvites re occupation at a much less expenditure of
money than would be required at any other loci I Ion
