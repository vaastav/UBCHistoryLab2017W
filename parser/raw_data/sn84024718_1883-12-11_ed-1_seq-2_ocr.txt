TUESDAT, DECEMBER 11, 1883
Mahone's Slander Endorsed by S. Brown
Allen and W. E. Craig.
Mahone, in his address, says that the
crack of the weapon resounded and the
Bourbon knife sank deep in Augusta, and S.
Brown Allen and W. E. Craig, natives and
residents of this county, endorse that ad
dress, and thus say that Mahone's outrage
ous slander of our county, is not a slander,
but the truth. Who could have believed
that there was a single man in this county
that would do as these men have done?
Mahone says; of the blacks, "that they
were shot in the back like dogs while they
were running away; that no pistol shot
was fired by a black man; that no white
man was injured, save by his own friends;
that for days the poor victims were found
dead in alleys, in warehouses, and under
houses, like poisoned rats that had crawled
away to die; that the negroes fled to the
woods, to the State of North Carolina, to the
four winds of heaven; that these are a few
of the facts of this bloody, wholesale mur
der, which was telegraphed far and near
by Bourbons as an insolent uprising of the
blacks against the whites," and S. Brown
Allen and W. E. Craig say that it is a true
indictment! This may furnish debating
societies with a question for discussion: —
"Whether these men should be iv a lunatic
asylum or in a house of correction?"
Are there any others in this county who
endorse Mahone's slander of the citizens
of this county? If there be, let them
make themselves known and wo will give
them the benefit of publication. It may
be of service to them, as Mahone may do
something for them when he learns what
good and loyal citizens of Augusta they
are.
What We Understand to be Carlisle's View.
It seems to be generally understood that
Speaker John G. Carlisle is opposed'to the
abolition of the internal revenue system.
We do not so understand it. He is—as we
understand his view to be—in favor of its
abolition, but not at this time, for the rea
son that the revenue from the present tariff
is not sufficient for the necessary expenses
of the Government, aud that he is in favor
of such a modification of tb t e present tariff
as will cause it to increase the revenue
from that source sufficiently to meet all the
necessary expenses, and theu the internal
reveuuo system should be abolished. His
theory is, that by a reduction of the tariff
duties, the increase of imports will increase
the revenue to the amount needed, and
theu the internal revenue system of taxa
tion can be abolished without crippling the
finances of the Government.

Senate of Virginia.—The Senate on
Thursday adopted a joint resolution pro
viding for a committee, consisting of five
from that body and nine from the House of
Delegates, to draft a bill apportioning the
State for members of Congress. The reso
lution requires that the new districts shall
be composed of continguous counties, aud
that they shall contain as nearly as possi
ble the same population. The coalitionists
opposed the suspension of tho rules for the
purpose of passing the resolution out of its
order.
The Senate also passed a resolution pro
viding for a joint committee of five from
the Sonate and eight from the House to in
vestigate tiie charges of mismanagement on
the part of the board of managers of the
Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution at Staun
ton.
General Wickham offered a resolution
proposing to amend the constitution so as
not to make petit larceny a disfranchising
offense: also, a bill providing that all school
taxes shall be paid in money.
In accordance with the resolution of the
democratic ctucU3 recommending members
of Senate committees, Gen. Wickham was
made chairman of the finance committee of
that body.
Senator McDonald, of Indiana, a promi
nent Democratic aspirant for the Presi
dency, expresses hsmself as delighted at
the election of Mr. Carlisle to tho Speaker
ship. He regards him as a safe, conserva
tive mau, being in favor of a tarifi' for rev
enue, and iv favor of such protection as
that tariff gives to the industries of the
country; or, in other words, a tariff for
revenue, with incidental protection. Mr.
McDonald says this is his posi ion, as well
as that of the Western Democracy He says
that if the Democrats in 1884 should go into
the Presidential campaign upon a platform
in harmony with Mr. Carlisle's position on
the tariff they will certainly win.
Ex-Gov. Hendricks has also been inter
viewed. He said that Mir, Carlisle should
be judged by the results of his administra
tion of Ihe office of Speaker, and not by
his location. "I do not think," ho said,
"that the sectional cry should be raised
against any man, and certainly not against
Mr. Carlisle, who was a Unionist where it
took splendid courage to be so."

Endorsing Mahone's Address.—The
Washington Republican gives the names of
90 Coalitionists, —re-published by the Rich.
Whig —who met in the Arlington Hotel in
Washington, and, ou the motion of Lewis
E. Harvie, unanimously endorsed tiia.hone'a
address. The names aro given from each
of the Congressional districts, and those
from this District are the following:—
Hon. H. H. Riddleberger, Robert J. Walk
er, M. Gary, A. K. Grim, G. M. Zerkle,
William E. Craig, and S. Blown Allen.
Language is iuadqeuate to express tho
enormity of that offense.
The Lynchburg Advance says that, "there
are cases where impeachment is to be de
sired as a means to deter corrupt officials
from stepping beyond vested in
them. In this State there are men who
hive disgraced high positions of honor and
trust and should bo summarily dealt with.
Any man who slanders his constituency
disgraces tho office to which he has been
elected by the people—known to be corrupt
and unprincipled should be removed from
office, and has no right to ask leniency or
charity."

Earthquake Shocks in Arkansas.—
Seven shocks of earthquake occurred last
Wednesday at Rovendeu Springs, Ark.—
They lasted forty secondß. and broke glass
ware and crockery in stores and houses.
Large rocks wore loosened and fell in tho
cuts of the Kansas City, Springfield aud
Memphis railroad near by. The shocks
were accompanied by a loud noise, and
there was a violent jar of the earth.

Election of Hon. John 6. Carlisle as Speaker.
The eleciion as Speaker of the House of
Representatives of Hon. John G. Carlisle,
of Kentucky, over Hon. Sam'l J. Randall,
of Pennsylvania, was a surprise to many,
who believed that expediency dictated the
choice of Randall. The Democratic mem
bers of Congress from all parts of the coun
try should be able to judge wisely as to the
choice they should make for speaker, and
wo think that those who preferred Randall
should yield a ready acquiescence in the
judgment of the Democratic members of
Congress, upon whom the responsibility of
making the choice devolved. Carlisle is an
able and pure man, is conservative and na
tional, and there is nothing sectional in his
election. He was a union man before and
during "the war, and the cry of "rebel" can
not be raised against him in the North. —
The "bloody-shirt" cannot be used against
him. The capitalists and business men of
the North repose confidence in his wisdom,
conservatism, and statesmanship, and his
election will not produce any scare in that
class.
Since they see how his election has been
received, msny of those who preferred Ran
dall are coming to tho conclusion that the
election of Carlisle was wise.
The Slate says that "while the Demo
crats who supported Mr. Randall were at
first disgruntled at the result, they are now
coming to s«e that the majority was right.
The Democratic party represents the peo
ple of the country, and the Democratic par
ty is becoming more compact every day.—
The outlook for 1884 grows brighter and
brighter."
The New York Herald says:—
"This attempt to raise a sectional issue
out of the choice for Speaker finds no sup
port or color in the facts and oharacter of
the contest. On the contrary, the election
of a Southern man in the person of Mr.
Carlisle is, under the circumstances, to be
hailed as one of the most encouraging polit
ical signs of the day. Mr. Carlisle was
not elected because he is a southern man,
nor does ho represent a Southern policy in
any sectional sense.
His candidacy represented a principle. It
meant an affirmative, active, manly policy,
not a negative do-nothing, evasive one. It
was because he stood for these things, and
because he had, in a high degree, all the
other qualifications for the offlce that he was
the choice of the majority for Speaker.
We rejoice that a good Southern man has
been elevated to a loading position in the
national government by a combined North
ern and Southern vote."
To this the Norfolk Landmark adds:—
"In fact the Democratic party is not the
sensitive plant some people thought it; but
a good, hardy growth, with its roots deep
in the soil from North to South, and from
East to West; and the straighter it grows
up in the light of day, the better the people
will like it."
Low or Hion Tariff. —Ex Senator
Gordon, of Georgia, says the South is de
monstrating its ability to manufacture at a
profit both cotton and irou with much less
protection than is needed to enable these
industries to live in other sections.
This being so, it is to the interest of the
South to have the tariff reduced. That will
have the effect of causing Northern capi
talists and manufacturers to invest in the
South. The Southern resources would be
developed sooner with a low thau with a
high tariff. This tho people will understand
when the question shall be thoroughly and
fairly discussed.
In the next canvass the Democratic par
ty will be the party of low taxes, aud the
Republican the party of high taxes, and the
Democratic party will win, audJ"don't you
forget it." If tho tariff question shall be a
prominent issue, the people will learn to
understand it before the election, and they
will not vote to tax themselves for the bene
fit of wealthy monopolies. The falacies of
the protectionists will be exposed.
"Serious Aspbct."—The election of
Carlisle as Speaker of Congress, and the
anticipated policy of the Democratic party
in the next canvass, has caused the Valley
Virginian to put on its studying cap, and,
after giving the subject mature thought, is
forced to the conclusion aud frankly con
fesses that ' 'it presents a serious aspect for
the consideration ofthe Republicans " Our
neighbor is right, and the "aspect" will be
come more and more "serious" "to the Re
publicans" as time advances, for their worst
fears will be realized.

John Randolph Tucker and a Manly
Critic.—The Editor of the Lynchburg-
News signed the dispatch which announced
that the constituents of the Hon. John
Randolph Tucker did not look with favor
on his support of Mr. Carlisle, and now
that Editor has come forward in the most
creditable manner to acknowledge his error
of juogmeHt us to the effect the election of
our Speaker would have upon the country.
Our brother of the News expresses him
self as follows:
"But we incline to believe now, and we
frankly say it, that we were wrong and
Mr. Tucker was right. The responses of
hearty approval of the bold and manly
stand taken by the representatives of the
great National Democracy that have come
from all over the country convince us that
our fears were born of over-timidity. De
fying the howls of sectionalists and the
predictions of evil of monopolists, the De
mocracy have shown the courage of their
convictions; have boldly placed themselves
on the side of the people, and wo believe
the people will applaud."
We copy this partly to show the manly
temper of our cotemporary, and, partly to
say that Mr. Tucker has shown high intel
ligence and courage in voting according to
his convictions of right in defiance of neigh
borhood opinion. It is of such stuff that
great leaders are made, and we hope, as
we believe, that there will be a strong reac
tion in his favor among the good people of
the Lynchburg District. We need reso
lute and honest men in high places, and
we are proud to see Mr. Tucker carrying
himself in a manner worthy the best days
of Virginia and the Republic — Norfolk
Landmark.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
The President's message was delivered to
Congress on last Tuesday. Its length is
too great for us to publish, and .if published
in full, would be read by few. We publish
in lieu of the whole an abstract as furnish
ed by the Bait. Sun which is not too long
to read, and the reading of which will su
persede the necessity of reading the mes
sage in extenso.
The message opens with the usual refer
ence to the foreign relations of the United
Slates, which he is able to state are every
where peaceful. Of more immediate inter
est, however, is the recommendation, made
by the Secretary of the Navy and indorsed
by the President as an important measure
of national defense in case of war with any
foreign power, that immediate steps be ta
ken for the creation of an interior coast line
of water-way across the peninsula of Flori
da, along the coast from Florida to Hamp
ton Roads, between the Chesapeake bay
and the Delaware river, and through Cape
Cod, thus recognizing more or less directly
tho national character of the projected
Chesapeake and Delaware ship-canal.
Commercial treaties have been made with
Servia, Roumania, Corea and Madagascar;
legations have been established in Persia,
Corea and Siam, and it is recommended
that the interests of American citizens re
siding or trading in Bulgaria and the Cen
tral American States be cared for by the
presence of consular representatives of the
United States. Reference is made to the
Brazillian export duty on coffee, and to the
penalties for technical faults applied to
American vessels and cargoes in the Antil
les, and the suggestion is made that retali
atory measures applied to Spanish vessels
and "cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico
might not be barren of good results. At
tention is called to the work of tho Inter
national African Association in the Congo
valley, and Congress is reminded that it
may become advisable for us to co-operate
with other commercial powers in promoting
the rights of trade iv that region "free from
the interference or political control of any
one nation." No large reduction of reve
nues is advised. Congress is reminded that
a tariff bill has been recently passed, the
results of which are not yet sufficiently ap
parent to warrant a further molification of
the tariff or internal revenue laws. He
states, however, that the legislation refer
red to has cut down the income of the gov
ernment some fifty or sixty millions of dol
lars—a statement at variance with that
made by the Secretary of the Treasury, who
puts the net reduction at but $30,000,000.
The sulplus of revenue over expenditure,
which the President estimates at $60,000,-
-000, it is recommended should be spent in
rehabilitating our navy and providing coast
defenses. The suggestion of the Secretary
ofthe Treasury as to the proper method of
perpetuating the national bank system is
approved. It is accordingly recommended
that the tax of 1 per cent, on the circulatiou
of the national banks be repealed, and that
the amount of the circulation allowed on
bonds deposited for security be increased to
90 per cent, on the market value of such
bonds. The effect of this would be to
make it profitable to the banks lo baso their
circulation on 4 per cent, which are not
redeemable till I'JOT. With respect to tho
disposition to be made of trade dollars the
President and Secretary of the Treasury,
while not favoring exactly the same plan,
are in substantial agreement. Tho former
recommends that the trade dollar be ac
cepted by the treasury and the mints as
bullion at a small percentage above tbe cur
rent maiket price of silver of like fineness.
The Sscretary suggests simply that the
standard silver dollar be exchanged, dollar
for dollar, for the trade dollar, tie latter to
be regarded as so much bullion bought un
der the act of 1878. Approval.is given also
the Secretary of the Treasury's plan for the
consolidation of certain customs districts,
and it is added that by the reduction of in
ternal revenue districts, recently perfected,
their number has been reduced from 123
to 83. Dwelling on the unprotected condi
tion of our extended seacoast, the number
of large and wealthy cities with which it is
dotted, the age and weakness of our works
of defense, their inferior armament; aud im
perfect torpedo equipment, the President
urges the reconstruction of our navy aud
the building of plant for the manufacture
of heavy ordnance, and points to the over
flowing condition of the treasury as a fact
that renders tho present the proper time
for the inceptio.l of so patriotic a work.
Attention is called to the growth of the
number of postoffices from 40,231 in 1882
to 47,863 in 1883. The recommendation is
made, adversely to the views of the Post
master-General, that the rate of postage on
drop letters, which at present i. two cents
where the carrier system is established aud
one cent elsewhere, be made uniform by
reducing it everywhere to one cent. Ref
erence is made to the long-mooted proposi
tion that the government should assume
the same control over the telegraph that it
has always exercised over tho mail, but the
President is unable to accord his approval
to tho project. Tho suggestion is mado,
however, that the goverument should be
author,zed to exercise some sort of super
vision over the interstate telegraph com
munication. The fees of juiors and wit
nesses in the Federal courts, fixed by laws
of old date, are insufficient. It is recom
mended that they be increased, ami that
district attorneys and mauhals be paid by
salaries, rather than as at present, by fees
—a change which, it \3 suggested, may di
minish tho number of prosecutions made
merely for tho sake of fees. Congress is
invited to consider the important question
whether Federal aid may not with perprie
ty be extended to public primary education
in parts of the country where the precen
tage of illiteracy is high. The failure of
tbe anti-polygamy legislation of March,
1882, is cited, and the strong recommenda
tion is made that Congi ess lepeal the act
upon which the existing government of
Utah depends, assume control at the Terri
tory, and establish iv authority a commis
sion with powers fitting it to deal effectively
with tho Mormon problem. The question
of regulating inteistato commerce is pre
sented for consideration. The right of
railway corporations to reasonable profit is
conceded, but Congress should protect the
people from injustice. The effects of the
civil-rights act in the short time daring
which it has been iv operation are pronoun
ced beneficial. The act passed by the Sen
ate at its last session regulating the presi
dential succession is recommended to the
favorable consideration ofthe present Con
gress. It is asked that the Executive be
empowered to veto particular items of an
appropriation without impairing the valid
ity of other items which meet hi 3 approval
In concluding, the Presided recommends
the passage of a new civil-rights bill guar
anteeing to the colored citizens the rights
secured to him by the fourteenth amend
ment.
A Valuable Book—A Treatise on tlu> Horse

This little book is of special value to every
horseman and to every owner of a horse.
It contains an Index of Diseases, giving a
description of each, with causes, symptoms
and treatment. It has a large collection of
receipts of which many single receipts are
worth, to every horse owner, several times
the price of the book. The treatment giv

so gives engravings showing the position
taken in the different stages of disease. It
not only gives the names of medicines used
in different diseases, but also gives the
proper doses. No horse-owner can afford
to do without this book which gives as
accurate and valuable information as that
given in books costing from five to ten dol

GOV. W. E. CAMERON'S MESSAGE.
The General Assembly met at noon last
Wednesday, and both houses organized by
the election of the Democratic caucus nom
inees. A joint committee waited on the
Governor, and soon thereafter his message
was received and read.
Not having the the* space to publish the
message in full, we publish such portions
as are of most interest to our readers.
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
Iv regard to* the public debt the Governor
says:
"Now, as for many years past, foremost
of importance of the subjects which will de
mand your attention stands the public debt,
During the last session of the General As
sembly the act approved, Feb. 14th, 1882,
established a basis upon which the credi
tors of the State were invited to fund their
claims for principal and interest into new
bonds bearing 3 per ceut., and the support
ing enactment contained in chapters 7 and
41 of the acts of Assembly, session 1881,
have so fulfilled their purpose as to afford
relief to the treasury and to make possible
the discharge of the floating debt, while
meeting promptly all cash demands for the
expenses of administration. But these
measures in no sense constitute a settlement
of the debt. The total amount of old in
debtedness of all classes, principal and in
terest, funded up to the Ist of October last
was $2,492,707.19, and under the act of
February 14, 1882, to tho same date, was
$1,527,803.30. It is thus apparent that
while the new bonds have been ready for
delivery during a period covering more than'
twelve months the amount funded under
the Riddleberger bill has been less than 6
per cent, of tho entire debt, and of the un
funded obligation, principal and interest,
outstanding against the Commonwealth,
there remains the sum of $33,411,086.22.
Within a much shorter period, under the
McCulloch bill, more than $8,000,000 of
bonds were surrendered, and yet that meas
ure utterly failed to settle the debt. It is
true that the Supreme Court of the United
States, in the case of Autoni vs. Greeuhow,
sustained the act of January 14, 1882, as
furnishing an adequate and constitutional
remedy to the holders of tax-receivable
coupons. But experience has shown that
act to be deficient in several important par
ticulars. The enacting clauses omit any
reference to the coupons detached from
bonds of the Commonwealth under the act
of March 28, 1879. The eventual effect of
this omission must bo either to exempt the
holders of 10-40 coupons from the condi
tions imposedjupon persons presenting in
payment of taxes coupons produced by the
bonds under the act of March 30, 1871, or
to force both the State and tho holder of
McCulloch coupons to rely ou the act of
January 28, 1882, commonly known as
"coupon-killer No. 2." That act has not
been subject to the construction of auy
court of appellate jurisdiction—State or
federal. Experience has also proved that
the requirements of section 4 of the act of
Jan. 14, 1882, are not sufficient to procure
proper care of the State's interest in the
suits therein authorized to be brought in
corporation and couuty courts by persons
in whom the claims of coupon-holders and
taxpayers conjoined." The message then
points out the fact that thousands of dol
lars of coupons have passed through the
courts without the needful scrutiny contem
plated. The Governor says: "Within the
official knowledge of tie Executive coupons
have passed through the courts upon the
sole evidence of persons who could not, by
any possibility, testify with kuowledge as
to their genuineness and legality. Judg
ments have been rendered against the State
treasurer on coupons which had no number,
and therefore were the legal product of no
bond." He says during the past six months,
owing to these causes, the funding under
the Riddleberger bill has practically caastd.
No suitor, he alleges, during the period
named has failed to establish his casa against
the State, except where the Executive has
employed counsol to represent the State.
"The measure of duty which seems to
apply to the executive in this case is to
seek absolute success for the settlement at
tempted. It cannot as yet be cilled iv any
true souse a settlement. Remaining with
the General Assembly is tho duty or privi
lege of making to live or to die the scheme
of funding known as the Riddleberger act.
To be successful it must be forceful. The
question now is not whether the General
Assembly will give negative support to an
attempt which is no settlement, butwheth
or tho majority of that body will sustain and
advance the present legislation of the debt
question. Let the responsibility remain
with the power, lt is as true now as it has
always been, that readjustment to be suc
cessful must be coercive, and that every
ultimate power residing under the constitu
tion in the Commonwealth of Virginia mu3t
be exhausted to protect her from excessive
and unjust claims."
The Governor then reeommede-d as fol
lows: That the act of January 14, 1882, be
so amended as to require the servicos of at
torneys for Commonwealth; secoud, to de
fine the manner and method of verifi-ation
of coupons; third, demand witnesses should
be summoned from such departments of
the State government as would at least be
likely to know which coupon was genuine
Of which fraudulent: fourth, that the act
above referred to should be amended so as
to include coupous on the 10-40 issue of
bonds; fifth, that in obedience to the consti
tution no money be paid out of the treasury
under plea of reclamation, except by bills
of appropriation.
The Governor, in his reference to the
basement officers, says: "The second au
ditor's office, originally created as a checker
b.ilauce upon the offices of auditor of pub
lic accounts ami troasuier, has grown to be
a dangerous if not use'ess adjunc' of the
administration—an officer, with considera
ble emoluments and a lie*vy force of assist
ants, uuder a bond sufficient for the respon
sibilities with which lie is charged, has
nothing really to <ro that two clerks, under
specific statutory instructions, culd not as
well and moro safely perform; that the of
fice, from the original inteution of a mere
clearing-house, has grown to bo the keeper
of all the trus bonds of the Common wealth;
that in the past fifteen years overy trust
fund that has been invaded has been in
vaded through the agency of this piactieal
ly irresponsible offlce."
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL.
"The Governor in referring to tho public
free schools, said "that the State in the
past two years has been able almost to dou
ble facilities for free education; that no
proper efforts of expenditure have been
lacking by this administration to carry out
its pledge in that respect. As was said to
your picde.ces.sors and pledged to tho peo
ple, the Executive of tho Commonwealth
knows no higher duty than to contribute
all in his power to furnish the means for
teaching all the people to understand their
rights, to know the limit of their privileges
and to feci and perform the full share of
their duties to those whom we havo armed
wilh powers and responsibilities of citizen
ship.
the oyster interest.
In protection of tho oyster interest of this
State it has been found necessary to make
some expenditures outside of the regular
appropriation. The Executive finds that,
Maryland, for instance, has a fleet of nine
vessels engaged in suppressing unlawful
dredging upon its oyster beds. Virgiuia
has no means of protection to her interests
iv this regard, which are the largest on
this continent. A >pecial mes-ago will be
sent to your body on this subject, stating
my past action, and asking for more scope
as to power and money to protect this great
source of Virginia wealth."
THE DANVILLE RIOT.
Referring to the recent trouble in Dan
ville he says: "It is sad to mar the pleasant
picture by illuding to an unhappy circum
stance which all good people should pray
God shall never be repeated in the State of
Virginia. Far be it from the Governor of
this Commonwealth, whoso duties are pure
ly executive, to criticise in any partisan
sense the trouble by which death and blood
came on the -id of November to many citi
zens in one of ther the cities of this State.
There is no purpose here to ask your hon
orable body to investigate the matter; there
is no right vested in the Governor to do so.
But the charge made against the State and
that community is this: that men were
killed, men were wounded, (of no matter
what party, or no matter what color,) and
that contrary to all the law-serving habits
of this people no man has been accused,
arrested or tried for hts part in the killing
or wounding. This is the view of the al
as
fair in which all good people should join.
A judicial investigation should be had, wit
nesses should be allowed to testify, should
be made to testify; and the truth should be
made apparent, so that the Commonwealth
of Virginia should be placed before the
world as one of the States which tries crime,
no matter who may be the criminal."
The Danville Riot.
THE GRAND JffttY's OPINION AS TO WHERE
THE BLAME LIES.
Danville, Va., December 4.—Thegrand
jury of the' Hustings Court, charged by
Judge Blackwell with the investigation of
the circumstances of the recent riot, after
a session of nearly two days, this afternoon
reported that they had no presentments to
make, and submitted the following paper,
which was ordered to be recorded:
It appears to the jury, who have examin
ed forty witnesses, white and colored, a
large proportion being colored, that on the
3d day of November, in the afternoon of
that day, a fight oocurred on Main street
between C. D. Noell (white) and Hence
Lawson (colored); that after the fight was
over and the combatants were separated by
the efforts of colored Policeman Adams, a
white man named Lee, and others, there
was a determination on the part of the
crowd of negroes assembled to intimidate
the whites by threats and menaces; that the
efforts of Policemen Adams, Freeman, and
Withers, and Citizens Corbin, Oliver Callo
way (colored), and others, wero unsuccess
ful iv prevailing upon the crowd of negroes
to disperse; that they persisted in remain
ing upon the scene of the fight and giving
expression to remarks calculated to excite
Che passions ofthe whites; that at last the
whites fired off their pistols in the air, hop
ing thereby to cause the crowd to disperse;
that the negroes did not then disperse, but
rushed upon the scene from all quarters,
advancing upon the whites with drawn pis
tols; that firing thereupon commenced; that
the whites used their firearms in defence of
their lives, The whites were in imminent
danger, and by their courage and pluck in
standing up against such odds saved tho
lives of hundreds of people in this city; and
this is the unanimous sense of the jury.

A private letter from Virginia expresses
the heartfelt feeling that "every man's
heart is in the right place who rejoices
with the people of Virginia in the over
throw of 'Mahoneism' —the most tyranni
cal political despotism that over ruled on
the face of the earth." The writer fuither
says: "If I but had the time and space to
enumerate some of their scoundrelly acts
and doings which I know to be facts—
coming uuder my own observation—it
would astonish you aud all other good
Democrats throughout the land." No, we
would not be astonished, for wo have kept
posted and know something of the infa
mous rule of Mahoneism, and we think
there is not an honest man living, of any
party, who does not in his heart .rejoice
with all Virginia at his downfall.— State

Being twitted, on numerous occasions as to
the sale of seats to Mrs. Langtry, and accused
ot monopolizing all the best seats for spseula

may be righted in this matter, that I have
neither bought nor had interest in the bnyine
of a single ticket for speculation or any other
purpose to Mrs. Langtry's entertainment and
that the report probably grew out of my' sell

Having formerly had connection with the sale
of reserved seats for the New Masonic Hall
parties having seats to dispose of naturally
brought them to me. Respectfully,
