-Wall Street ami England
have received the President's
message with considerable favor.
Football belligerents can
not demand recognition until they
quit battering their features be
yond it.
Let us be charitable toward
the chronic loafer and kicker. No
other man under the canopy is so
pooily paid for his work.
Those increased gold ex-
poi ts may be in some treasure due
to demands from Castellane or
Marlborough for part of his whole
some balance.
The horse that won first
honors at the recent San Francisco
meeting is named Pepper. This
i intended as a seasonable an
nouncement. Judge Stcpp had the court
room closed to minors in the pro
gress of a late "loud'' trial at
Eetbany. This seems to be a step
in a good direction.
Just at this time, when
promineiit Democrats find no
platform satisfactory, it is sad
but not astonishing to learn David
B. Hill has left the lecture field.
The Congressional Kecord
will be uncommonly interesting tc
.Americans for a time, for the all
sufficient reason that Lord Dun
raven can not get into its columns.
The Sultan may uo doubt
feel secure as long as the rest of
Europe continues to tike the ad
vice of Lord Byron:
Leaxe battles to the Tuikish hordes.
And shed the blood of Scio's vine.
There are a few men in the
present Congress who are inured
to hardships, and it may be that
a few of them read the President's
message in its overwhelming en
tirety. "Charley's Aunt" has
brought the author $150,000. If
Charley's mother-in-law will now
do as much the cynic will have to
acknowledge he has been mistaken
in the gentler sex.
Missouri's Republican plu
rality of last year was more far
reaching than most persons sup
pose. It actually made Benjamine
F. Russell Sergeant-at-arms of the
Fifty-fourth Congress.
If the unspeakable Turk
had someYankee ingenuity and a
little Japanese imitation, some
kind of new war-ship would result
from the remarkable display of
naval architecture about the Dar
danelles. It would be like trampling
the fallen if Kansas were to return
Ingalls to the Senate in place of
Peffer, besides Jeffersonian bipeds
are likely to be too scarce for
years for John J. to have a chance
to exercise his skill in political
taxidermy.
Will Carletou pron ounced
the President's message rather
"tame.5' It seems that Will
might find in it an inspiration to
improve upon a former poetical ef
fort, by putting some jingles into
Columbia's mouth and naming the
new candidate for public favor
"Grover and I are out."
An exchange of Populistic
tendencies, rather than Democratic
bias, announces that Jones of the
Post Dispatch always gets what
he goes after. If this is true, Col.
Jones has certainly gotten all the
"free silver'' he could find iu Mis
souri, as it is very evident he has
practically quit going after the
white metal.
If Sedalia wants the people
of Missouri to respect its business
sagacity to a degree that results
in votes, it will hasten to contra
dict that story to the effect that it
offered the St. Louis Republic
10,000 to boom the capital re
moval. Sleepy as Jefferson City
is it would not Tor a momeut im
agine the iuiluence of "Old ISOS"
could be worth so much.
Devotional organizations in
Cleveland, Ohio, engaged in pray
er on Thanksgiving day for the
conversion of Robert G. Ingersoll.
Perhaps it would not be irrever
ent to suggest that, if the record
ing angel laid those petitions aside,
simply marked, "Prayers from
Cleveland," the chances are good
for their having been pigeon-holed
indefinitely as some weak and in
consequential foreign policy.
Those esteemed contempo
raries that spell the Vice Frcsi
dent's name with nh instead of v
may readily be pardoned. The
"V" has been rather scarce since
the present administration began
to undo business at Washington.
Unless those Cuban insur
gents can manage to make the
carnage equal to that of American
football, they can hardly expect
much sympathy, especially from
men like Mr. Cleveland, who
judge the merits of war by the de
mand for substitutes.
Tt is difficult to detect any
element of doubt in the situation
that makes Republican success
next year less absolutely certain
than a foregone conclusion. The
portents of disaster to the party of
the administration have been more
uniform and decided than those
that preceded the overturning of
1S92, and there is nothing in the
history of this country to make
void the obvious handwriting on
the wall. The Republican sign
board unequivooally reads, "On
to Victory," yet it is not to be
doubted that the Democrats will
make a good fight in 189G. They
always do iu Presidential years,
and now they are going to have
the opportunity to base party so
lidity on extravagant criticism of a
handicapped Republican Congress.
It would be well for our represen
tatives to remember that the sure
thing is inseparable from prudence
and sagacity.
ALL AROUND US.
Jo. Dill is at work on a souvenir
edition of the Linn County News.
Two of Brook field's papers have
gone glimmering in the last few
weeks.
At a recent sale in Macon coun
ty cows brought from 20 to 830,
horses from $10 to 810.
In its write-up of Putnam coun
ty the Republic failed to give due
credit to its Republican habits.
The poor of numerous neighbor
ing towns were substantially re
membered on Thanksgiving day.
A Macon county speculator ex
pects to buy several thousand
bushels of corn at 1G cents a bush
el. Rev. Shawhau, the Kansas City
revivalist, is engaged in a meet
ing at Moberly, in which three
different denominations co-operate.
Randolph county has a citizen
whose bare feet make a good imi
tation of bear tracks. We forbear
to comment.
Body snatchers are sent to the
penitentiary from Linn county.
Such grave undertakings should
prove disastrous everywhere.
A Trenton hotel celebrated
Thanksgiving day by moving up
one story nearer heaven. The ex
ception mocks the rule even in
wicked Trenton.
Young ladies of Milan lately
had a coasting party and reported
only one accident. The new wo
man certainly flourishes in Sulli
van county.
Columbia law students want
Ingersoll to address them at the
next commencement, and the fac
ulty wonders what in the name of
Moses will happen next.
A former citizen of Cameron
visited Schlatter at Denver, and
was treated or some knee trouble.
The next day he laid aside his
crutches and went to praising the
healer.
The air about Kansas City, St.
Joseph and Trenton is heavily
charged with railroad rumors.
With so many ships at sea, the
capitalists ought to make a car
go-
The Kansas City Court of Ap
peals last week reversed the de
cision in the Hess-Gansz libel suit
at Macon and remanded the case
for a new trial. Hess was origi
nally given judgment for $750.
The "petrified man"' brought
down from Iowa was the first in
dividual tried in the new court
house at Lancaster. Hanging to
gether well with cement and sup
plied with an iron backbone, he
was acquitted on the charge of be
ing an administration Democrat.
A negro at Columbia presented
his church two pulpit chairs,
which he named "King David"
and Ezekiel.'' Later he was ex
communicated, whereupon he stole
the chairs, for which he was pros
ecuted and acquitted.
A bachelor editor in a distant
town is on the verge of uiadnes
because iu explaining the delay of
an issue he stated ho had been
"sleeping too close to the board
ing house window," but the care
less or criminal compositor left the
n out of window.
The Moberly Monitor is not
sure that Cleveland could not car
ry a single county in Texas in
ISflG, as some Democratic organs
maintain, but compromise the
question by beiug positive that ho
will not, which is equally glad
tidings to the country.
An
interesting Announcement
for our Readers.
We have secured for the exclu
sive use of the Weekly Graphic
a series of articles on the Sand
wich Islands by the distinguished
historian and novelist, John R.
Mu sick. These articles are being
prepared by the author on the
spot He is now at Honolulu, and
will visit each of the islands of
the Hawaiian group. They will
have the peculiar living freshness
that cau only be given to such
when written it the place on the
very days the writer beholds them.
They will be a series of descrip
tive and historical articles, or
letters, about that country. Mr.
Musick will furnish us, there'ore,
articles rich in descriptive scenery,
filled with authentic history and
facts, and lightened by incidents
of travel and adventure, making
them more fascinating than a
novel.
No portion of the world is to
day attracting more attention than
the Sandwich Islands; aud yet,
much as they are talked about
aud much as they have been mixed
in American politics for the last
forty years, the masses of readers
know but little of the social life
and customs of the Islanders, and
could not tell off-hand whether
they lived in modern houses, in
huts, wigwams, or caves.
It will be the object of these let
ters not only to briefly sketch the
past and present of the Hawaiian
Islands, but to carry the reader
directly into the private life of the
propie wno innabic mem; tneir
past and present government, the
overthrow of monarchy, and set
ting up of a Republic will be nar
rated from a non-political stand
point. In this respect they will
have a peculiar interest because in
the coming Presidential contest
the question of annexation will be
agitated. These letters will con
tain hundreds of items of great in
terest, all told in a highly enter
taining, instructive, and unbiased
mauuer. In shoit, we have a rich
treat for our readers for the entire
winter.
We urge you to get your neigh
bors and friends elsewhere to sub
scribe for the Graphic. The arti
cles alone will be worth much
more than the subscription price
of this paper. Then always re
member these letters are exclusive;
no other paper in this vicinity can
furnish them. They are for the
Weekly Graphic.

From a letter written by Rev.
J. Gunderman, of Dimondale,
Mich., we are permitted to make
this extract: "I have no hesita
tion in recommending Dr. King's
New Discovery, as the results
were almost marvelous in the case
of my wife. While I was pastor
orthe Baptist Church at Rives
Junction she was brought down
with Pneumonia succeeding La
Grippe. Terrible paroxysms of
coughing would last hours with
little interruption and it seemed
as if she could not survive them.
A friend recommended Dr. King's
New Discovery; it was quick in its
work and highly satisfactory in
results.'' Trial bottles free at
