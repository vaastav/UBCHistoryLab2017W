THE UNEMPLOYED
And Their Relation to the Proposed
Tariff Legislation.
IN FIVE MANUFACTURING CITIES
Alone ThereJAre Tlirco Hundred and i
Fifty Thousand Men Out ot Kmployinent
Owing to tbo Depression
Due to Tariff Uncertainty?A Con- 1
trust With Republican Times, Wlion
Conildence Prevailed Everywhere.
Tho following editorial from the Now
York Presi, the editor of which is lloburt
P. Porter, otio of the most distinguished
statisticians in tho country, ns
wellasonoof tho ab!est economists in
tho world, contains much to think
about at this time:
Whilo William L. "Wilson resales tho
readors of tho Suuday Prtts with solcuin
free trado platitudes and dilates on the
havoc which the scramble for spoils and
tho Shorman silver law have played
with tho country, the tariff which bears
hia imnio ia hrinnimr thn industrial
population of our great cities face to
faco with Htarvntiou. Careful estimates ;
made by capable statisticians and pub- '
liahod in yesterday's Sunday Press
brings to light the appalling lact that
tho number out of work in New 1
York is not loss than 110,000; in Chi- 1
r*ago, over 100.000; iu Philadelphia, not I
less than IK),000; iu Boston, probably
10,000; in Cincinnati, over 15,000. Here
we have in those live citie9 at tho present
moment 000,000 unemployed. These '
are tho great manufacturing cities of
the country, aud tho pronosed free
trade legislation will strike the severest
blows at tho industrial populations of
auch centros of industry. Including
tho ordinary increaso since 1800, tho
number engaged in tho manufacturing \
industries in these cities snould to-day ;
lie as follows:

Tho actual liguros published by the
:ensus for 137 cities irive tho average
unount of yearly earnings per hoad at ,
>037, ho mo aoovo estimate is unloubtedly
within the mark for tho five
ending cities. Nearly one-third of the
nduBtrial population' of these cities is
>ut of work, which means an annual
oss of wastes of more than $200,000,000,
)r a sum of $10,600,000 per month. Tho
unhappy condition existing in these ,
jities extends, with hardiv an
exception, throughout the uianufacuring
regions of tho country. Tho
:elegraphic columns oi tho daily ,
newspapers contain accounts of closing
mills, operatives thrown out of work
nnd roduction of wanes. In some cities
in this stato and in Pennsylvania and
Now Epglanu the porcentago of tho unemployed
will even exceed .'S3 per cent.
And this is true of tho mining districts
of the northwest and far western states.
Suppose wo take the 137 cities for which ,
we have at hand the eleventh census
reports. Ilere are included only places
nf importance, for thoro are in all 4IS
:ities in tho United States of S.000 pop- ,
illation and over. The manufacturing
budget of tho 137 cities is as follows:
Totnl of gross product $3,i:W.406.7GS 1
Valur of product, le*s raw m?u-nuL 'J,7.
Aggregate capital 3,358,918,270
Total wages paid
Number employed 2,57K,001
During the last decado of ltopublican
rule tho number employed and wages
paid in theso cities increased on the uvorage
not less than 50 per cent. Less
than a year of the policy oi Democratic
wreckers threatens to reduce tho value
of tho product one-third, confiscate onetliird
of tho capital, stop one-third of
the annual amount disbursed in wages,
throw out of employment one-third of
those employed, and perhaps still ,
further cut down tho wages of those
still fortuuate enough toobtain employment.
'lliese aro hard facts to meet.
The tinkling of Mr. Wilson's economic
cymbals, the shaking of Mr. Springer's
optimistic castanets and tho incessant
grinding of Mr. Cuminings' Italian ortran
will not drown the crv for bread
:md work which comes from a million
impoverished wage earners of these cities.
It will not beguile tho American
people while the promoters of this
measuro oi destruction aro completing
the ruin.
"Wait awhile," says Grovcr Cleveland,
"and see what prosperity wo will
bring you when freo raw material reduces
your wages gets you out of the
narrow home market iuto the boundless
markets of the world." "Bo patient,"
says Mr. Wilson, "until my bill
becomes a law, whon the increased influx
ot foreign commodities mado by
foreign labor will iu Borao mysterious
way start up the closed m'illa and
factories and bring increased prosperity
to the nation." If we could only
huvo got at things sooner," says Mr.
Springer, "we would have had business
humming now. Pray, don't be in a
liurry; tho good time is surely coming."
"Wo are wutorlogged, bovs; perhaps
wrecked," says Mr. Curaming9, "but if
you will only givo us a respite we will
ilo our best to throw overboard a score
or two Jonahs, hunt up a now Moses
and load you out of tho wilderness into
which our folly has consignod you into
tho promised land." Thus are the uuomployed,
tho homolo9S, tho starving,
met with plausible excuses, ingenious
explanations, glowing prophecies, eloquent
promises and frantic appeals to
wait a little longer. .Such utterances
either feed tho hungry, clotho tho
naked nor shelter the homeless. They
count for little in times like these.
When wages were high and work
abundant in lail'2, tho irridescenl lly,
with its glittering reflection on tho silvery
and shallow waters of free trado
oratory, looked tempting. Now, us tho
victim's ga?p for life, how different it is!
Tho bait of tho world's markets is mostly
shadow, and freo raw matorial at
p'omo one else's exnonso is, after ull, a
Jeop cut iu your own wages.
Thero in but oilo hope, aud that lies
in opposition to tho consummation of
the crime against our industries. Not
tho opposition of manufacturers. They
liave grown weary after ton years
threatened annihilation. Let a million
wage earners from tlieso onco prosperous
centres of industrial activity cipher
this piobloui out for thetnsolvos and enter
a long, loud, ringing and patriotic
protest agaiust any tariff legislation.
She fact aud cxpononco aro all on tho
lido of protection, and with such a protest
oven Democratic loaders will not
iare complete tho industrial carnage.

A TALK WITH I'UKD DOUGLASS
Misfortune of the Nci;r? that the Hiu* of
the Fevr Are Yliitoil L'pou the Many.
"Washington, D. 0., Dec. 14.?lion.
Frederick Douglass, who was the Haitian
commissioner at the World's Fair, has
returned to his home, Cedar Hill, AnacoBtin.
Tn a talk with a reporter yesterday
Mr. Douglass would not express
an opinion on tl.e Hawaiian question,
saying ho thought ho ought to reserve
it until tho resolution of Mr. Hoar
ihould lind compliance.
"Will Minister Sraythe bo able to
consummate negotiations looking to tho
acquirement of the Mole St. Nicholas?"
"I am not informed." fie said, "if tho
government of tho United States will
endeavor to acquire tho Mole Su Nicholas
as a coaling or nava! station. There
is no telling what might be accomplished
in that direction in cortain contingencies
such as revolutions might
brint: about. But 1 feel quito sure that
under tiie present administration the
acquisition of the Mole St. Nicholas is
quito impossible."
Referring to tho Haitian exhibit at
Chicago, he said: "I express the feolinir
of tho thousands who visited the Haitian
pavilion when 1 say that her participation
in tho World's Columbian
Exposition was highly creditablo to
that republic. Haiti was a surprise to
those who visited tyer pavilion. Tho
American reoplo had beon led to bolieve
that Haiti was barbarous; that she
was descending deeper and deeper into
barbarism. When they saw tho pic*
tures of her towns and cities, tho dwellings
of her people, public buildings,
such as the iiank of Port-au-Prince,
unl tho great iron market house, and
1 . - .1. .. I;J i i
icuruuu?-aa luuv uiu icaru 110:11 1110?ok
the additions made to her educational
forces, the surprise and admiration increased.
I think her exhibits tended
very much tov raise t he estimation m
which colored peoplo generally are
held."
"Did colored peoplo generally attend
tho fair?"
"The attendance of colorcu yeoplo as
spectators of the exposition was credit*
able both in point of numbers and ro*
ipectability. T/ieycamo there orderly,
well dressed, and made good appearance.
1 doubt not that more would
have attended had not there been an
apparent purpose to exclude them froiu
ail honorable participation iu tho exposition
itself, and had not ttio press
takon pains in advance to heap ridicule
upon their attendance."
When reminded that tbero was no
reference to the noero iu the President's
message to Congress last Monday
Mr. Douglass said that he had not read
the message, but it it were so it wero
probably best for the negro.
"And why should he?" hecoutinuod.
"Ho has had no protest against the
lynch law practices now prevailing iu
Ltio southern states, and likely to become
epidemic."
"Do you think tho lynchiug practices
threaten to become epidemic'."'
"Yea, the tendency is to lawlessness
and anarchy in this country. There is
fear of irresponsible persona taking the
law into their own hands and endeavor*
ing to usurp the places of sheriffs, conatubles,
juries, judges, and determining
the guilt or innoconca of men without
fair triai.
"The general charges that are made
against the negro, in the south especially?the
chargo of assault upon white
women?has affected public opinion unfavorably
toward the race. It is the
misfortune of the negro that all presumptions
are against him, and to bo
charged with a crime in the south is to
bo pronotiucod 'guilty' in advance.
Then, too, it is another misfortune to
the negro that the sins of the few are
visited upon the many. When a white
man commits a crime, ho alone has to
sufler, but the sins of one negro are visited
upon all negroes. Thus far I do
not see that our colored press has done
all it might do to defend the raco from
this charge. For my own part, 1 can
say that I honestly believe the charge
against the southern negroes is, in most
cases, trumped up. 1 shall, however,
take it upou myself at an early date to
to give my views at length on the subject
hero in Washington."'

"It J* not theso tiling* that uro troubling peopie.

the grip. People feel out of sorts, sneeze,
nave pains in the muscles and bone*, have no
appetite, lose all interest in the world and wonder
what la the matter. It is tho grip; nothing
else.
".Vow. nil such symptoms need to have prompt
treatment. The iittacic must b>' met aud repelled
at once, or it Is certain to result In something
herlous. I know of hut one way to certainly
avoid these troubles which are now so
common, and that is. to immediately counteract
them by using a good. pure, strong stimulant.
Nothing of the ordluary kind, but something
puro and scientific. For this purnoso
nothing jias ever equalled Dully'* Pure
Malt Whiskey, which I* acknowledged to-day by
physicians and scientific i>coplc to be the only
pure, incdlciual malt whiskey upon the marLet."
The words of the professor arc true and they
carry a wonderful meaning to many men and
women who oro Huflferlug with tho llrst symptoms
of grip, or clw grip in in advanced stago*
For all such people wu oiler a word of ndrfce;
