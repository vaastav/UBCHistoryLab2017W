The Declaration of Independence,
which declares that government de?
pends upon the consent of the govern?
ed; the Constitution, which, accord
ing to a unanimous decision of the
?. S. Supreme Court, prohibits the seiz?
ure of territory for colonization pur?
poses, and Washington's Farewell Ad?
dress, which warns the country against
the necessary dangers of a large stand?
ing army, are all flouted and scouted
by the "expansionists," as "behind the
times" and not "up to date.'-' This
country's misfortunes began when the
principles upon which its government
was established were disregarded and
repudiated thirty-seven years ago, but
the modern so-called "statesmen"
haven't even the sense of a child, that,
having been burnt, dreads the fire.
The correspondent of oue of the re?
publican newspapers of Washington
who accompanies the Presidential par?
ty on their Southern trip, writes that Mr
McKinley says the Spanish war has
"wiped out all sectionalism." The
President is as incorrect in this as he
was in his message to Congress,
when he said the sinking of tbe Merri
mac had blocked up Santiago harbor,
and that Admiral SampsoD had destroy?
ed the Spanish fleet there. The sec?
tional line is as apparent iu Congress
and in the North now as it ever was, and
Mr. McKinley has done his best to
preserve it iu the South by the ap
pointment of negroes to office in this
section. Good citizenship doos net
render an intelligent man stone blind.
General Wheeler, who is a mem?
ber of the President's party, is reported
as saying at Charlottesville yesterday
evening, he wanted "the President to
see the eiforts the people of the South
are making to render themselves goon
citizens." Such talk as this will do the
General no good amot:c his own peoplet
for they know it has required no eflort
on their part to render themselves
"good citizens." They have been suck
from the first, and the few who were
naturally disposed by the treatme::!
they had received to be otherwise,
were made such by the instruction?
they received from their idolized lead?
er, General Robert E. Lee.
Secretary Bliss, one of the two
really able men in Mr. McKinley's cab?
inet, but whose talents were devoted to
the making of contracts for army blank?
ets, is not willing, and very naturally, to
be held responsible, even partially, for
the dangerous course the administra?
tion is now pursuing, and has abandoned
it to its own reckless way. Indeed, ii
seems as if Mr. McMillin's description
of the Cabinet, as recently given in tin
Gazette's Washington correspondence,
may not be very incorrect after all.
The commission that was created to
settle all the many differences between
this country and Canada has effected
nothing and adjourned until next spring.
Its American members could not an(;
would not make any concessions in the
line of reciprocity, by which the tra'lo
between the two countries could be in?
creased, so the Canadians naturally
thought it would be just as well for
them to go home.
Gereral Brooke will be the command?
ing officer in Cuba, General Lee in the
province of Havana, and General Lud
low in the city of Havana. With three
such officers and three corps of soldiers,
it would seem that the preservation of
law and order at least in the western
end of the island ought not to be a very
difficult task.
Mr. Bryan's chief strength lay in his
advocacy of silver. It he has dropped
that issue, or abated his support thereof,
as is indicated by his speech in Savan?
nah last night, many democrats will be
disposed to look elsewhere for their
leader._

To-day's meeting of the Natioual
Citizenship Convention was not numer?
ously attended. "True manhood suf?

related to our new possessions" were
the subjects discussed. Among those
who spoke were Belva Lockwcod,

Gen. Corbin was before the House
military affairs committee io-day. Re

tive Mahony, be asserted that there had
sever been any army cared for so well !
as that of the United States during the i
Spau.sh war. He had heard no com-I
Plaints from a volunteer officer or man. !
?? said Aguinaldo had an army of1
40.000 men and no'one could tell whet
they would do. If they fought and
were defeated they might return to civil
life or become bandits. He said an
army of 100,000 men was needed. The
Cuban commission, he said, had official?
ly reported that .50,000 men wou.d be
needed to preserve order in Cuba, and
the department was preparing to send
that number if required. Gen Otis re?
ports that 25,003 are needed in the
Philippines and the Porto Rtcan com?
mission says 6,000 are needed there. In
both Cuba and Porto Rico, he said,
there are a large number of people who
are simply lawless. No one can tell
whether affairs in Cuba and elsewhere
will quiet after the Spanish soldiers are
withdrawn.
CoDgressmae Bland, of Missouri, said
to-dav: "Silver is stronger now than it
was two years ago, and the republicans
can make up their minds that the same
old plauk will be in our next platform."
Bailey takes the same view and insists
that Bryan and silver will be the next
combination. McMillin and other well
known House democrats talk as if sil?
ver wili certainly be kept to the front.
Senators Morgan, Cockrell, Teller,
Vest, Stewart, both of the Joneses, and
in fact Senators in the democratic,
populist and silver republican circles
are of the opinion that no issue can
crowd out silver. There is quite a di?
vision among these people, however,
on the expansion question. Morgan,
Teller and Stewart are ultra expan?
sionists; Allen is opposed to what he
calls "imperialism,1' as he and Bryan
are warm friends and stand together.

MR. BAILEY'S OBJECTIONS
Representative Bailey, of Texas, has
decided to raise the question of the
r'.ght of Maj. Gen. Wheeler, of Alabama,
to participate in the proceedings of the
House should hs attempt to exer
cise the privilege of a member. He
will also raise the question as against
either of the three other members of
'he House who entered the service of
? lie United States during the war with
Spain, Representatives Robbins, re?
publican, of Pennsylvania; Colson, re?
publican, of Kentucky, and Campbell,
democrat, of Illinois. The express pro?
visions of the constitution, he says,
forbid any person holding an office un?
der the United States to be a member of
Congress. He regrets to raise the point
against such a worthy man, but regards
it a-i his sworn duty to do so. Mr.
Bailey contends that the question has
been settled by the House, notably in
the Yell case, and that by accepting the
commissions they now hold each of
these members hasrelioquished bissest
in the House.

BURSTING OF A GAS HOLDER.
A big, new telescopic gas-holder of
tbe Consolidated Gas Company, which
was said to be the largest in the world,
and which had just been erected in the
center of the block boundei by First
avenue, Avenue A and Twentieth and
Twenty-first streets, New York, burst
while it was being tested at 5:30 o'clock
yesterday evening, let loose a flood of
5,000,000 gallons of water, buried in its
ruins at least one man, killed another
outright and injured many others, The
gas went out wherever the company's
service extended below Grand strest,
and, as it was not turned on again,
much inconvenience was caused to con?
sumers, especially newspaper offices
using typesetting machines, and in
some cases the men were compelled to
go back to the old method of setting
type by hand.
Part of the wrecked structure fell
upon the rear of the table factory of
Henry Fouldner, at the southeast cor?
ner of Avenue A and Twenty first
street, crushed the lower part of the
factory, wbore tbe engine room was,
under many tons of torn and twisted
steel, and buried the engineer, Plus
Baum, while the great blast of escaping
air which followed the collapse of the
reservoir blew fragments of the Build?
ing half a block away. The tenement
bouses which were north of tbe faclory
were also damaged and rendered un?
inhabitable. The flood of water from !
the foundation of the gas-holder was
turned loose, principally into Twenty
first street, where it swept east aud
west in a great wave, starting with a
height of ten or twelve feet and reach?
ing a depth of four feet at First avenue,
before it was lowered by spreading out
into tbe avenue.
Tbe flood spread all around the block
and filled cellars before it got a chance
to run off. Every man wbo was at the
north of the gas-holder was certainly
killei, for the whole street there is cov?
ered with a tangle of wreck, amid
which none could find safety, and it
ivill not be surprising if a number of
bodies of persons not yet known tobe
missing are found there when the
wreck is cleared away.

COLONEL BRYAN.
Col. William J. Bryan left Savannah
last night for Washington. He will
stay there a few days before going
West. Col. Bryan before leaving Su
vannah gave his impressions concerning
some of the present issues. Among
, o.uer things he said- "I may be in
error, buf, in my judgment, our nation
is in greater dauger just now than is
Cuba. Tne people defended Cuba
against foreign arms, now they must
drfend themselves and their country
against a foreign idea?the colonial idea
ol European nations. Heretofore greed
nas perverted tbe government and used
its instrumentalities for private gain,
but now the very foundation princi?
ples of our government are assuulted.
The imperialistic idea is directly an?
tagonistic to the ideas and ideals which
have been cherishtd by the American
neople since the signing of the declara?
tion of independence. Our nation
muH give up any inteution of entering
upon a colonial policy such as is now
pursued by European couotries or it
must abandon the doctrine that govern?
ments derive their just powers from
the consent rf the governed." After
expatiating on Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, and giving his idea as
to how Congress should deal with the
treaty, he said. "We should reserve a
harbor aud coaliug stations in Porto
Rico and tbe Ptnlippines in return for
services rendered, and I think we
would bo justified in asking the same
concession from Cuba. In the case of
Porto Rico, where the people have as
yet expressed no de-dre for an inde?
pendent government, wo might with
propriety declare our willingness to
aunex the island, if the citizens desire
annexation, but tbe Philippine Inlands
are too far away, and their people too
tliflerent from ours to be annexed to
the United States, even if they de?
sired it."
Col. Bryan intends to enter actively
iuto tho fight agaicst the colonial poli?
cy. Io. .'act, it is evident that this was
tbe main causo that led to his resigna?
tion.
THE CUBAN GOVERNORS.
As stated in the Gazette of that day,
formal announcement was made at tbe
War Department yesterdny that Gene?
ral John R. Brooke had been appoint?
ed military governor of the Island of
Cuba. Major General Filz Lee will be
military governor ol Havana province,
and General Ludlow civil and military
governor, or, more properly speaking,
mayor of Havana city. Each of the
six provinces of Cuba will have its own
military governor, just as Gen. Wood is
now military governor of the province
of Santiago, but all of these will receive
their ins ructions directly from Major
General Brooke, who is in supreme au?
thority of the island. Thus, in Ha- j
vana General Ludlow will bo governor !
of the city, but answerable to General
Lee, the governor of the province of
Havana, who in turn will be answer?
able to Major General Brooke, the gov?
ernor of the island.

Mr. Hoar put in another large batch
of petitious from citizens of New Eng?
land protesting against territorial ex?

Mr. Vest made a vigorous attack
upon the system that enables fraudu?
lent claims to go through, and he
cbargi.d that there was a "wholesale
spoliation" of the Treasury iu the in?
terest of the raiders. Mr. Vest de?
manded that a reform should be inaug
arated.
Mr. Qallioger replied, and said that
before a reform could be brought about
the general pennon laws should be
amended.
There was considerable discussion
over the proposition to publish the pen?
sion list.
Mr. Gallinger said this would cast
several million dollars.
Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, reported
favorably from the committee on con?
tingent expenses the resolutions offered
by Mr. Vest to investigate the charge
that army and navy contracts had been
improperly awarded during the war
with Spain and to investigate tho delay
iu the construction of the new postof

Sp mi-h-Americau war.
Mr. Dmgley, of Mame, asked un?
animous consHiit for Mr. Grew, of Peon
sylvania, to make a few.remarks on :he
"committte of the whole House oa the
State of the Union."
Mr. Grow gave a historic sketch of
the custom of going into c >mmitreo of
tbe whole. He said it arose from a de?
sire to really hear about thes t?te of tbe
Uniou and debate freely before resolu?
tions were prepaid aud adopted.
The point ot his remarks was th?t
this committ e of the whole was adopt?
ed for the purpose of giving tts free aud
full debate as ihe Senate always has al
lowed. He declared the old formult,
was the proper thing. Some members
had shown asperity at the last session
because their speeches were cut oil,
when not relevant to tne subject; but
the speaker maintained the debaters
should be ccnlined to the state of the
Union. He recalled how the little band
of free-soilers years ago had had a hear?
ing only because of tho free debate al?
lowed iu tho committee of the whole.
Mr. Grow's remarks brought forth sum -

Egnlaml und France.
London, Dec. 14.?The six months
J protocol between France and England
delimiting the Niger country, expires
to-day, and as u treaty concerning this
territory has not been signed this opens
another dangerous topic between the
two nations. There are many who see
a settled English policy exhibited in
! the recent speeches of Sir Elmund
.llonson and others, to provoke France
to war. Certainly the temptation is the
strongest wnich ever confronted a na?
tion, because uow tbe destruction oi
France would be a comparatively easy
matter. Years hence, if unmolested,
France in combine with liussia, might
turu and destroy the British empire.
