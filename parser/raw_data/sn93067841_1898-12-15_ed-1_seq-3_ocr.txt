McKinley's second annual message, a document
of unusual length, was read to the
two Houses of Congress immediately after
they assembled for the third and closing
session of the Fifty-flfth Congress:
To the Senate and House'of Representatives:
Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered
necessary by the war. our people rejoice
in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing
degree of prosperity, evidenced by
the largest volumeof business ever recorded.
Manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abun

is better rewarded, revenue

W Government have been successfully
administered and its credit aavanced to
the first rank, while its currency has beau
maintained at the world's highest standard.
Military service under a common
Bag and for a righteous cause has strength
ened the national spirit and served to
oement mere closely than ever the fraternal
bonds between every section of the country.
A review of the relation of the United
States to other powers, always appropriate,
is this year of primary importance, in
view of the momentous issues which have
arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimate
determination by arms and involving
far-reaching consequences which will require
the earnest attention of the Congress.
Spanish Misrule In Cuba.
In my last annual message very full consideration
was given to the question of the
duty of the Government of the United
8tates toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection
as being by far the most important
problem with which we were then called
upon to deal. The considerations then advanced,
and the exposition of the views
therein expressed, disclosed my sense of
the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting
aside, as logically unfounded or practically
Inadmissible, the recognition of the
Independence of Cuba, neutral intervention
to end the war by imposing a r tional compromise
between the contestants, intervention
in favor of one or the other party, and
forcible annexation of the lslaud, I coni
eluded it was honestly due to our friendly
relations with Spain that she should be
given a reasonable cuance 10 realize ner expectations
of reform, to which she had become
irrevocably committed. Within a few
weeks previously she had announced comprehensive
plans, which it was confidently
asserted would be efficacious to remedy the
'evils so deeply affecting our own country,
so injurious to the true interests of the
mother country as well as to those of Cuba,
and so renugnant to the universal sentf?
ment of humanity.
The ?nsuing month brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of
Cuba. The autonomous administrations
set up in tlie caoital and some of the principal
cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend
their influence to the large extent of territory
held by the insurgents, while the
military arm, obviously uuable to cope with
the still active rebelliou, continued many
of the most objectionable and offensive
policies of the Government that had preceded
it. No tangible relief was afforded
the *vast numbers of unhappy reconcentrados,
despite the reiterated professions
made in thRt regard and the amouut
appropriated by Spain to that end. The
proffered expedient or zones or cultivation
proved illusory; indeed, no less practical
nor more delusive promises of succor could
well liave been tendered to the exhausted
and destitute people, stripped of what
made life and heme dear and herded in a
strange region among unsvmpathetie
strahgcrs hardly less necessitous than
themselves.
By the end of December the mortality
among them had (rightfully increased.
Conservative estimates from Spanish
sources placed the deaths among these distressed
people at over fort\ ner cent, from
tne time General Weyler's d<x-ee of rceonoeatratiou
was enforce 1. With .he acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities, a 'cheme
was adopted for relief by charitable contributions
raised in this country and distributed.
under the direction of the ConsulGeneral
and the several Consuls, by noble
4 anil earnest individual effort through the
organized agencies of the American Red
Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved,
but many thousands more were inaccessible
to such forms of aid.
The war continued on the old footing
without comprehensive plau, developing
only the same spasmodic eucouuters, oarreu
of strategic result, that had marked the
course of the earlier ten years' rebellion as
well as the present insurrection from its
Start. No alternative save physical exhaustion

poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing
oui national chaiaete? that this shocking
blo|w, falling upon a generous people,
alread;' deeply touched by preceding events
In Cuba, did not move them to an instant, ,
desperate resolve to tolerate the existence
of a condition of danger and disorder at our
doors that made possible such a deed, by
whomsoever wrought. Yet the instino of
justice prevailed, and the nation anxiously
awaited the result of the searching investigation
at once set on foot. The finding
of the Naval Board of Inquiry established
that the origin of the explosion was external
bv a .?ui"uarine mine, and only halted,
through lacof positive testimony, to fix
the respni - ility of;its authorship.
Vr? pc.vatiok?* For War.
All the ? tuings carried conviction to the
a -t Hi ; jhtful, even before the flndiug
' ?li- aval court, that a crisis in our re
melon* Spain and toward Cuba was
at hand. So strong was this belief that it
needed but a brief executive suggestion to
the Congress to receive immediate answer
to the duty of making ii>9tant provision
f r the possible andjperhaps speedily probable
emergency of: war, and the remarkable,
almost unique, spectacle was presentediof
a unanimous vote of both houses,
on the| 9th of March, appropriating ?50,000,000
for the national defense, and for
each a!nd every purpose connected therewith,
"to be expended at the discretion of
the President."
The president thin reviews at length the
various attempts tj> bring about a peaceful
solution of the qu4>tion. and says that ho
was grieved and disappointed at the barren
oiteome of his sincere endeavors to
reach a practicable solution. He then relates
how he placed the matter in the
handslof Congress.
Congress Takes Quick Action.
The response of the Congress, he continues!
after nine days of earnest deliberation,
<?uriog which the almost unanimous
sentiment of your body was doveloped on
every point save as to the expediency of
coupling the proposed action with a formal |
recocttftion of the republic of Cuba as the ;
true and lawful Government of that islanc j
?a proposition w h failed of adoption?:
the Conpres9, aft -r conference, on the 19th j
of April, by a vol o.' 42 to 35 in the Senate j
and 311 to 6 in t' House of Representa- i
tives. passed their memorable joint resolu
tion.
Tbe;mossa?e continues hy sayfnp that a j
copy df the resolutions was at once com-|
muni 'ated to the Spanish Minister at Washinpt'm.
who irntr.'-dlateiy demanded his
pass ort1-. They were piven to him, and
thebpui-.- i terests were left in the protection
of the French Ambassador and the
Austrian-Hunparian Minister.
Simultaneously with the notice of the
resolutions to the Spanish Minister, its
text %as cabled to General Stewart L.
Woodford, the American Minister at Madrid,
tqho was to communicate it to the
Spanish Government. Before he could do
so the! Spanish Minister of State notified
him that, upon the President's approval ox i
the joint resolution, the Madrid Government,
Irepardinp the net as "equivalent to I
an evident declaration of wnr," bad or- i
dered its Minister in WashiDpton to with- j
araw, tnereoy ureamuK ui|'iuai,i?uiolations
between the two countries and
ceasing all official communication between
their respective representatives. General
Woodford thereupon demanded his passports
and quitted Madrid the same day.
The President reviews the preparations
t - beginning of hostilities. Spain
; hax.ng initiated the war, a blockade of the
: north coast of Cuba was proclaimed, and
the call for volunteers was issued. The
various Governments were notified of the
; existence of war, in order that their neu(
trality might be assured. Tiie response to
1 tiie initial call for 125,000 troops was instant
j and complete, and a second call for 75,000
additional volunteers was issued.
The navy is referred to, showing its condition
when war was declared, as well as
tbo means employed to protect the Atlantic
seaboard and the cities lying along the
coast ?rom any possible attack. The coast
Signal Service was organized and an auxiliary
fleet created, which was officered and
manned by the naval militia of the several
States. Mines were also laid in the various
harbors.
The work of the Signal Corps is referred !
to, it being of an important character. I
Electrical connections of all coast fortifications
were established, as well as telephonic
ami telegraphic facilities for the
camps at Manila. Santiago and Porto Rico,
tield c-ujgraph lines were established and
maintained under the enemy's fire at Manila.
A cable -hip was placed in Cuban
water*, wit: h rendered service that
was icvalua le to the Executive in conducting
: e operations of the array
and hi w. The expenditure of the
?50,00),UO!) defense fund is dwelt upon.
It helped t Government to strengthen
the defenses of the country and to make
adequate prjparatlons for war. Th*pop?
ular loan of $200,000,000, watch was subscribed
to so promptly, is mentioned as
showing the vnst resources of the nation
and the determination of the people to uphold
the country's honor.
The Prsajident states that It is not
within the jrovlnoe of the message to narrate
the history of the extraordinary war
with Spain,* and mentions the first engagement,
which took place April 27, when a
detachment of the blockading squadron
ofT Cuba shelled the harbor fort and demolished
several new works which were
beinglbonstructed at Matanzas. The message
irontinues as tollowa:
Dewpv'i Glorious Victory at Manila.
The .t encasement was destined to
| mark a :u?piorable epoch im maritime warfare.

Geors? i Ueprey. bad lain for some weeks at

Xslan d'i under telegraphed orders to

in t lie 1st of May the American force

For this gallant achievement the
Congrtss , upon niy recommendation, fitly
bestowed upon the actors preferment and
substuot al reward.
The el ect of this remarkable victory
upon (he spirit of our people and upon the
forlu:?;s of the war was instant. A prestige

Their forces invested Manila from thenoi^B
crn and eastern sides, but were constrain^
by Admiral Dewey and General MerrM
from attempting an assault. It was fitting
that whatever was to be doneih the way of
decisive operations in that quarter should
be accomplished by the strong ?'-m of the
United States alone. Obeying ^he stern
precept of war which enjoins the_ vercommg
of the adversary and the extinction of
his powr wherever assailable as the speedy
and sure means to win a peace, divided
victory was nbt permissible, for no partition
of the rights and responsibilities attending
the enforcement of a just and advantageous
peace could be thought pf.
The message coutinues with a review of
the entire land and naval operations. He
uoes not rreac morn nt out icn-u
the publio to the departmental reports for
details. Hestates that with the destruction
of Cervera's fleet Spain's efforts on the
ocean virtually ceased, and ends this part
of the doenment by relating how the last
scene of the war was enacted at Manila,
the place where it started. Ho closed his
references to military and naval matters
by a tribute to the fighters.
Praise For All Our Fighters.
It is fitting that I should bear testimony
to the patriotism and devotion of that
large portion cf our army which, although
eager to be ordered to the post of greatest
exposure, fortunately was not required
outalde of the United States. They did
their whole duty, and like their* comrades
at the front have earned the gratitude of
the nation. In like manner, the officers
and men of the army and of the navy who
remained in their departments and stations
faithfully performing most important duties
connected with the war, and whose requests
for assignment in the field and at
sea I was compelled to refuse because their
services were indispensable here, are entitled
to the highest commendation. It is
my regret that there seems to be no provision
for their suitable recognition.
In tracing these events we are constantly
reminded of our obligations to the Divine
.Master for His watchful care ever us and
onfa mWHnnau fni* rrhi/*h Hm nnfinn
makes reverent acknowledgment and offers
humble prayers for the continuance of
His favor.
Spain Sues For Pyacc.
SpaJr, having realized that she had lost,
the President states, now sued , for
peace. The signing of the protocol i9 referred
to, and then the Message relates the
details of the negotatlons which ended in
a suspension of hostilities, the appointment
of the military commissions to
superintend the evacuation of Cuba, Porto
Rico and the adjacent islands and the
peace commission. Continuing, he says:
Peace Commission's Work.
Pursuant to the fifth artic'.e of the protocol,
I appointed William R. Day, lately
Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis,
William P. Frye and George Gray, Senators
of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid
to be the Peace Commissioners on the part
of the United States. Proceeding in due
seasou to Paris, they there met on the 1st
of October live Commissioners similarly
appointed on tho part of Spain. Their
negotiations have made hopeful progress,
so that I trust socn to be able to fay a
ilellnito treaty or peace oerore trio senate,
with a review of the steps leadiug to its
signature.
Government of New Possessions.
I do not discuss at this time the government
or the future of the now possessions
which will come to us as a result of tfie war
with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate
after the treaty of peace shall be
ratified. In the meantime, and until Congress
has legislated otherwise, it will be my
duty to continue the military Governments
which ha7e existed since our occupation,
and give to the people security in life and
property and encouragement under a just
and beneflcient rule.
Independence Alone For Cuba.
As soon as we are in possession of Cuba
and have pacified tho island, it will bonec
essary to give aid and direction to its
people to form a government for themselves.
This should be undertaken at the
earliest moment consistent with safety and
assured success. It is important that our
relations with this people shall be of the
most friendly character and our commercial
relations close and reciprocal. It
should be our duty to assist in every proper
way to build up the waste pieces of the
island, encourage the industry of the people,
and assist them to form a government
which shall bo free and independent, thu^
read zing the best aspirations of the Cuban
Snonisli rnto must ho renlficed hv a
just, benevolent, and humane Government,
created by the people of Cuba, capable ol
performing all international obligations,
and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity, and promote peace and
good will among all of the inhabitants,
whatever may have been their relations in
.the past. Neither revenge nor passion
should have a place in the new Government.
Until there is a complete tranquiliity
in tho island and a stable Government
inaugurated military occupation will
be continued.
Friendly Relations "With All Nations.
With the one exception of the rupture
with Spain, the intercourse of tho United
States with the great family of nations has
been marked with cordiality, and the close
of the eventful year llnds most of the issues
that necessarily arise in the complex
relations ot sovereign States adjusted 01
presenting no serious obstacle to u just and
nonorable solution by amicable agreement,
The President dwells at some length or
the long unsettled boundary dispute be
tween the Argentine itepuouc auu uuue
and expresses pleasure that his efforts tc
induce them to resort to arbitration have
been successful. He also refers to tht
strong hope he has that the rates charged
on the cables of American corporations it
the transmission between Buenos Ayre:
and the cities of Uruguay, Brazil and "th<
Atlantlo cities of South America may b<
freed from an almost prohibitory dlserimin
ntion. He favors an international agree
ment for an Interchange of messages ovej
connecting cables.
Then taking up home topics he says:
Austria and the Lattiuier Strike.
On the 10th day of September, 1897, I
contlict took place at Lattimer, Penn., be
twoen a body of striking miners and th<
Sheriff of Luzerne County and his depu
tie*, in which twenty-two miners wer<
killed and forty-four wouuded, of whon
tea of the killed and twelve of the wound
ed, were Austrian and Hungarian subjects
The deplorable event naturally arousei
the solicitude o. the Austro-Hungariai
Government, which, on the a^sumptioi
that the killing and wounding involved tin
unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimei
reparation for the sutlerers. Apari
from the searching Investigation am
peremptory action of the authorities
i?f Pennsylvania. tho Federal Executin
took appropriate steps to learn the merit
of the ease, iu order to oe in a position t
meet the urgent complaint of a friendl;
power. The Sheriff and his deputies, hav
in? been indicted for murder, were triei

; and the hearing of hundreds ot witnesses

I line of their official duty to uphold law am
] preserve public order iu the State. A rep
resentative of the Department of Justic
| attended the trial and reported its cours
fully. With all tho facts in its possessior
this Government expects to reach a bat
monious understanding on the subject wit
that of Austria-Hungary, notwithstaudin
the renewed claim of the latter after Iearr
ingthe result of the trial, for indemnity fc
its injured subjects.
After an extended reference to the year
events in Central America, he de tes th
following paragraph to the > uragu
Canal:
Nicaragua Canal a Necessity.
The Nicaragua Cana! Commission, unde
the Chairmanship of Kear-Admiral John (
Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under th
authority oi a provision in the Sundry Civ
I
bas nenri?
labors^H^TneresuIts o( its exinquiry
into the proper route, the
^H^^Hty and the eost of construction of
H^^nrocoanio canal by a Nicaraguan
be laid before yon. In the per'
formance of its task the commission received
all the possible courtesy and assistance
from thg Governments of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, which thus testified their
appreciation of Idle importance of giving a
speedy and practical outcome to the threat
project that has for so many years engrossed
the attention of the respective
countries.
As the scope of the recent inquiry embraced
the whole subject, with the aim of
making plans and surveys for a canal by
the most convenient route, it necessarily
included a review of the results of previous
surveys and plans, and in particular those
adopted by the Maritime Canal Company
under its existing concessions from Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, so that to this extent
! those grants necessarily noiq as essential
a part in the deliberations and conclusions
of the Canal Commission as they have held
and must of need hold in the discussion of
the matter by the Congress. Under these
circumstances, and in view of overtures
made to the Governments of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica by other parties for a new
canal concession, predicated on the assumed
approaching lapse of the contracts
of the Maritime Canal Company with those
States, I have not hesitated to express my
conviction that considerations of expediency
and international policy as between
the sovernl Governments interested in the
construction and control of an interoceanio
canal by this route require the maintenance
of the status quo until tho Canal Commis
sion shall have reported and the United
States Congress shall have had the opportunity
to pass financially upon the whole
matter Juring the present session without
prejudice by reason of any change in the
existing conditions.
Nevertheless, it appears that tho Government
of Nicaragua, as one of its last
sovereign acts before merging its powers
in those of the newly formed United States
of Central America, has granted an optionni
concession to another association, to become
effective on tho expiration of the
present grant. It does not appear what
surveys have been made or what route is
proposed under this contingent grant; so
that an examination of the feasibility of its
plans is necessarily not embraced in the
report of the Canal Commission. All these
j circumstances suggest the urgeuoy of some
i nAf(An l>? frttifrrAaa thia
iuniuno iuuvu uj uiu vvuhkvM ... auaw
session, if the labors of the past are to be
| utilized and the linking of the Atlantio and
[ Paciilc oceans by a practical waterway is
to be realized. That the construction of
such a maritime highway is now more than
ever indispensable to that intimate and
readv Intercommunication between our
eastern and western seaboards demanded
by the annexation of the Ilawalian Islands
.'.ud the prospective expansion of our influence
and commerce in the Pacific, and
t at our national policy now more imperatively
than ever calls for its control by this
Government, are propositions which, I
doubt not, the Congress will duly appreciate
and wisely act upon.
Open Dotir in Clilna.
The United States has not been an indifferent
spectator of the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire,the President
remarks, whereby portions of its maritime
provinoes are passing under the control
of various European powers; but the
n./Minont ?hnf tin* vest commerce which the
energy of our citizens find the necessity of
our staple productions for Chinese uses has
, built up in those regions may not be prejudiced
through any exclusive treatment by
the new occupants, has obviated the need
1 of our country becoming an actor in the
scene. Our position among nations, having
a large Pacific coast, and a constantly
expanding direct trado with the farther
Orient, gives us the equitablo claim to consideration
and friendly treatment in this
regard and it will be my aim to subserve
our large interests in that quarter by all
means app-opriate to the eonstaut policy
of our Government. Warships have been
fationed at Tien-Tsln for more ready observation
of the disorders wuich have lnI
vaded even the Chinese capital, so as to be
i in a position to act should need arise, while
J a guard of marines has been sent to Fekin
to afford the Minister the same measure of
authoritative protection as the representatives
of other nations have been constrained
to employ.

| In the Sundry Civil Appropriation
act of July 1, 1393, a sum not to exceed
@ 50,000 was allotted for the organization
of a commission to care
for the proper preparation and installation
of American exhibits. I appointed
Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of Chicago,
Commissioner-General. Mr. Peck's
report will be laid before you. In mv
judgment its recommendations will call
for your early consideration, especially as
regards an increase of the appropriation

only may the assigned space be fully taken
up by the best possible exhibits iu every

on January 24. 1S98 (taj take effect a year
from that 'late), of tlin"termination of the
Extradition Convention of December 11,

therewith tho President asks for an amendment
of the existing extradition statute.
Tho suggestion is then made that Congress
authorize a conference of representatives
of tho United iitat^s and Mexico to
Consider the problem of tho Mexican free

concluded with this oouutry, August 31,
ijvri.
L'he proposal of the Czr.r for a conference
to discuss the general reduction of the
vast military establishments of the world
is referred to. His Majesty was at once informed
of the sympathy of our Govern,
ment nud of the readiness of the Uu.ted
I States to take part in the conference. It
1 is also stnted that the claims of owners of
i American sealing vessels for seizure by
! Russian cruisers in Bering Sea are being
1 pressed to a settlement.
Venezuelan Boundary Arbitration.
The arbitral tribunal aopointed under
the treaty of February 2, 1S97, between
Great Britain and Venezuela to determine
the boundary lino between the latter and
the colony of British Guiana is to convene
at Paris during the present month, and
the President expresses much gratification
thereat. H-also says that the experiences
of the last year having brought forcibly
home to us a sense of the burdens and the
! waste of war we desire, in common with
civilized nations, to reduce to the lowest
possible point the damage sustained in
time c! war by peaceable trade and commerce.
He therefore urges the calling of
an anti-privateering conference.
National Finances,
i On the subject of national finances the
message derails the Government's receipts
and expenditures, and then says that the
"provisions made for streugthenmgtho resources
of the Treasury in connection with
the war have given increased confidence in
the purpose and power of the Government
to maintain the present standard, and have
[established more firmly thau ever the national
credit at homo and abroad. A.
marked evidenco of this is found in the inflow
of gold to the Treasury."
The President renews his recommendation
of December, 1897, as follows: That
when any of the United States notes are
presented for redemption in gold, snch
notes shall be kept and set apart und only
paid out in exchange for gold. This is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the United
States note prefers the gold and gets it
from the Government he should not receive
back from the Government a United
States note without paying gold in exchange
for it. The reason for this is made
all the more apparent when the Government
issues an interest-bearing debt to
provide gold for the redemption of United
States notes a non-interest bearing debt.
Surely it should n?t pay them out again
except on demand and for gold. If they
are put out in any other way, they may return
again, to be followed by another bond
Issue to redeem them another interestbearing
debt to redeem a non-interestI
bearing debt.
On the Itelfisue of Greopbacks.
This recommendation was made In the toelief
that such provisions of law would insure
to a greater decree the safety of the present
standard, and better protect our currency
from the dangers to which it is subjected
from a disturbance in the geueral business
conditions of the country: In my judgment,
the present condition of the Treasury
amply justifies the immediate enactment
of the legislation recommended
one year ago, under which a portion of the
gold holdings should be placed in a trust
fund from which greerbacks should be redeemed
upon presentation, but when once
redeemed should not thereafter be paid out
except for gold. It is not to be inferred
that other legislation relating to our curi
rencyi- not required; on the contrary, there
| is an obvious demand for it.
Trade With Our New Islands.
The annexation of Hawaii and the
changed relations of the United States to
Cuba,Porto Rico and fhe Philippines resulting
from the war compel the prompt ad >ption
of a maritime policy by the United
States. There should be established regular
and frequent steamship communicatiou,
encouraged by tho United States, under
th- American ilag, with the newly acquired
islands. Spain furnished its colonies, nl
an annual cost of about two millions of
doi ars, steamship lines communicating
with a portion of the world's market as
well as with trade centres of the home
Government. Tho United State will
; not undertake to do this. Itiiourdutv
j to furnish the people of Hawaii with
j facilities, under national control, for their
! and imnnrt trade. It will lie con
j ceded that the preseuc situation calls for
i legislation which snail be prompt, durable
I and liberal. The part which American
| merchant vessels and their seamen performed
in the war with Spaiu demonstrates
that this service, furnNhiug both pickets
and the second line of defense, is a nai
tional necessity, and shonld be encouraged
in every constitutional way.
The President renews his recommendai
tion that suitable appropriation be made to
provide for a commission of experts to be
appointed to investigate the cause auJ
prevention of yellow fever.
A Larger Army Wanted.
An increase of the army is urged, tho
1 President declaring that there can be no
question that at this time, and probably
for some time in the future, lOD.OJO men
will be noue too mauy to meet the necessities
of the situatlou.
Then follow paragraphs relating to the
Union Pacific Railway, a now building for
! the Department of Justice, the inadequate
i| accommodations provided for the Supreme
ij Court in the Capitol, the postal service of
the couutry und its labors during the
war, as well as the postolllces which were
