Plans Made for
Anollior Mprurpr
Of Steel Plants
Six or More Concern in New
York and Ohio to He Drought
Into One Great Cor
poration. . By HOLLAND.
In one of the addresses which wee
recently niado hy Charles M. Schwab,
he spoke in favor of industrial corn
bination directed by a single, very
able leader, which would permit
reasonable competition with other
organizations engaged in similar
manufacture and would also estab
lish healthful co-operation. Mr.
Schwab is thought to have had in
mind when he thus spoke- the con
templated merger of several inde
pendent steel corporations. For it is
presumed that he must have known
last summer that a plan of this kind
was then under consideration. Others
, had knowledge of it but their in
formation was confidentially impart
ed so that they could do no more
than hint at it.
n of the loading business and finan
cial authorities said In the autumn,
having; first Impoited confidence, that ,a
merger was under consideration Involv
ing several of the large independent In
dustries ami 1f It were completed would
be ot atmoHt Inestimable benefit to Amor-
nan business mid Industrial Ufa. But.
hp aald, this la nut iho only mentor
that la In contemplation for when IhK
iima la propitious an oarnest effort will
ne maue to merge into one large corpo
ration several of tho railway systems of
he United States. This la apart from
.ie recommendation that the country be
evlded Into zones In each of which tho
allways were to ba consolidated Into a.
jingle system.
Steel Merger Planned.
Thla man said mora recently that It la
now possible to aay that the merger to
wnicn ne rererreo. early in tne law would
nnng at least six, poasilily seven or
eight. Independent steel corporations In
to alnifle orxanlied body. It must
be therefore that all who have had the
plun tinder consideration have now pro
gressed ao far In their atudy of It that
aubatantlal and authoritative admission
has been made that a number of the
Independent ateel companies have been
considering a plan by means of which
they can reach' a satisfactory basis for
consolidation.
Various surmises have been made as
to the identity of tha independent steel
companies which If the plan be adopted
will be merged into a single great cor
poration. Almost all of these Indepen
dent steel companies have their chief
Plants m western New York and in
eastern Ohio. They are In the vicinity
of Pittsburgh Which will probably al
. ways remain the center of the chief
steel Industry of the United States al
though the time is not distant when
the Industry .at Birmingham, Ala., mny
rank a close second. There la tho Mid
Vale Steel and Ordnance company, the
Republic Iron and Hteel company, the
Lackawanna Steel company, the Youngs
town Hheet and Tube company, the Brier
Hill Steel company whose plant Is near
Youcgstown. the Inland Steel company
and the Steel 'and Tube Company of
America,
Co-Operatlon and Competition.
It Is tho surmise that Judge Gary,
who is chairman of the board of the
United States Steel corporation, does not
regard with disfavor or apprehension a
merger of thia kind. He has often said
for publication and oftener in private con-
. versauon inai lor economic reasons anu
for the best Interest of the industries
of the United States It would be well
if large "Independent Industries be brought,
as the United States Steel corporation
was brourht. Into a single corporation.
Of course It la recognized that a merger
of this kind will make It all the easier
to maintain reasonable competition with
the United States Steel corporation. But
reasoname competition is vjeiqome. u
tests the ability- and the capacity to
bring forth produots of . high quality at
relatively low cost. " It does not mean
that harmful antagonisms will be cre
atod, for upon matters , of general In
terest and pollcJe&.of national tmpor-.
tance it hi possible, to maintain com-
"Hon. That is the policy wmcn nas
made tha Clearing House association in
New York of great and honorable In
fluence, . although., the individual mem
bers of the Clearing House are engaged
today in more Vigorous competition for
business! than at any previous time.
The United States Steel corporation
has demonstrated that pot least among
the policies which enable the corpora
tion to produce steel and jron products
' at comparatively "low cost is the fact
that this corporation embodies a con
siderable number in the steel and Iron
Industry which were formerly operated
Independently. That undoubtedly is one
of the considerations which has stimu-
latea mose wno t-uimui
dent steel and Iron industries to take
careful an yet couragsous steps with the
view of bringing all of these : Indepen
dent Industries into one family.
Iarge ret 1 omparaiiveiy ouiau.
These Independent companies can pro
duce nearly -,800,000 tons of ateel a
vear. They are also as a whole the own
ers of rich and extensive ore, coke and
coal properties and limestone. They have
every facility In the way of raw material
for operating their plants. If the merger
is based upon the aggregate capital it
will represent S467.000.000. If It were
not for tho United States Steel corpora
tion, that figure would Justify listing
the merged company 'as the leader so
far as capital Is concerned In American
industries. Vet It is, comparatively
speaking, small when tha capital of the
United Steel corporation is cc-nsidered. In
fact, the capital' stock of the Steel
corporation, a little over $500,000,000, is
represented by common stock.
Tho underlying feature, however, of
this contemplated merger is the fact that
It represents the belief of- all the lead
ers In the American steel and iron in
dustry that Mr. Schwab was conserva
tive wheh he ventured to predict a few
davs -ago that the future of the steel
Industry in thr United States, provided
there ' be reasonable combination and
co-operation, is to be enormously pros
perous. This merger will make it pos
.ihi i avian to a considerable ex
tent In the export trade of which the
United States Steel corporation now pos
sesses the greater share.
The plan may be abandoned for rea-

'consummation and that the financing of it
will be handled easily with great skill
and without involving any watering of
securities. -

Cattle Although cattle receipts were
moderate they were apparently more than
ample while the packing house strike is
on. Severa hundred cattle were carried
over from Monday - and local packers
were apparently no more anxietis for- lib--eral
supplies today than they were then.'
Bids and sales were generally around 25c
lower except on a few desirable handy
weight steers and heifera. Eastern ship
pers bought a' few desirable beef steers
and cows at about steady prices, but It
was a 25c lower deal on practically every
thing that went - to local packers. Busi
ness In stockers and feeders was rather
quiet, but prices generally held steady;

Chicago Tribune-Omaha Bee Leased Wire.
Chicago, Dec. 6. Weakness in De
cember wheat at Minneapolis, where
prices were off 4 l-2c at one time,
more than offset bullish news from
Europe and Argentina, and precipi
tr.ted liquidation at Chicago, with the
close at net losses of 1 ?-82 7-8c,
with July leading. Coarse grains
weakened with wheat and ' finished
with corn S-8 1 l-4c and oats 1-8
5-8c lower, while rye was off 3c.
There was sufficient .bullish news
in the wheat market, under normal
conditions , of trading, to have
brought about a sharp upturn in
prices, but at the top early they
showed only l-2lc over the finish
of the previous day. Foreign cables
told of an improved demand for
cash wheat. The seaboard claimed
a good export business, with 500,000
bushels Manitobas sold abroad.
Antwerp ' reported a more general
demand and there 'were inquiries re
ceived at Chicago for offers from the
United Kingdom, the first in some
time.
Argentine exporters were reported
in London cables as rcbuying wheat
sold to the United Kingdom, on .ac
count of .crop deterioration. Broom
hall, after careful investigation, esti
mated the surplus from the old crop
remaining for shipment at 24,000,000
bushels or half of what was recently
said to be on hand, suggesting a
total surplus of 143,000,000 bushels,
old and new grain. Kansas also
sent dry, weather reports.
Corn Market Heavy.
Prospects of an Immense export busi
ness In 'corn, with domestic and export
sales f 750,000 bushels in all positions in
the west during the day, counted tor little
in the corn market and the undertone
was heavy': from the start. Cash houses
bought December to remove hedges against
shipping sales, but better weather condi
tfona led to heavy sales to arrive by tho
country and sample values, while un
changed early, were lc lower at the last.
President Harding, in his message to con
gress, asked for an appropriation to buy
10,000,000. bUBhels corn for Russian relief,
buit it was ignored as a market influence,
as was tile strength in stocks and foreign
exchange,- especially marks. The seaboard
reported '400,000 to 600,000 bushels corn
sold for export. Receipts were 467 cars.
Oats Were affected by the action of
other grains and ranged lower, closing at
the bottom. Domestic shipping demand
was better, but the total business was not
given. Premiums on epot were unchanged
as compared with the December. Re
ceipts, 96 cars. . .
Houses with seaboard connections were
free buyers of rye early, but the market
flattened out later when wheat broke and
closed about the bottom. The Beaboard
reported 1,000,000 bushels sold for export
in the-past;two days. Receipts, five cars.
Pit Notes.
.' Minneapolis wired Leland: "December
wheat has become weak here, going to
almost 3 cents discount under May. Many
traders expected to see December continue
Btrong, as the September did, but there
appears lo be no concentrated holding in
the current month."
' An Antwerp cable said that there had
been a complete recovery from the recent .
apathy there. Consumptive demand for'
all grains was reported active."
According to New Tork, Germany has
established a good line of credit, but
where they got it la said to be a mystery.
Germany recently has bought Australian
wheat, American, rye and corn, nnd Mon
day was a factor in the rye market.
Total sales of rye were 1,000,000 bushels
yesterday and today, 750.000 bushels being
worked yesterday. Milwaukee stocks of
rye are said to have been about all cleaned
up.
Hutchinson, Kan., wired Bennett: "A
local banker, who la a very 'conservative
man, states that in this territory the
1922 wheat promise has been cut down
70 per-cent. Snow was sufficient to bene
fit the crop only In a few places."
Updike Grain company had an Austral
ian cable 'saing that wheat was in fair
condition, but was in the critical period
and that reliable authorities placed the
crop prospect at about 80 per cent of
normal.
The fact that 600.000 bushels No. 2
yellow corn at Buffalo .was sold for ex
port at 2 cent's over May c. 1. f. Buffalo,
caused considerable comment. The demand
was regarded as more urgent than sup
posed. Domestic sales were more liberal
than for some time and shippers here In
many cases are confident that asy nor
mal run of corn will be taken care of
without difficulty.
In spite of the enormous' receipts of
wheat at Canadian terminals for weeks
past, much larger, In fact, than for the
same time a year ago, visible stocks now
are only about 9.000,000 bushels more than
a year ago, and there was a decrease of
3,836,000 bushels for the week.

New York. Dec. 6. In view of
existing circumstances, especially
the proposal to defer cash payments
on Germany's reparations account
after next February, today's move
ment of foreign exchange was in
teresting. That the German mark
should have risen, on the report that
such purpose was. officially con
sidered, to the highest price since
Berlin's "black Thursday," Decem
ber 1, was natural. The day's re
covery from .0043 3-4 to .0050 1-2
will doubtless have its own impli
cations to the German stock ex
changes; but that is another matter.
The sharp rise in sterling to
$4.08 7-8, a higher rate than has yet
been touched since the autumn, of
1919, might be taken as London's
expression of satisfaction over the
drift of the reparations controversy,
for Lombard street had rather evi
dently come . to , favor leniency to
Germany.
French Francs l"p.
But today's rise In French exchange to
7.61 4c an advance of nearly 1-3 cent
since tne increase oegan, is consiueraoiy
more significant because it is a very plain
comment of the outside financial world
on the lately prevalent Idea that suspen
sion of cash payments by Germany -nuuld
drive France into bankruptcy. The price
reached by' the franc on today's market
was the highest since the first days of
September and something like 25 per cent
above the rate of a year ago this week.
What we thus far have in the cables
regarding the proposed three-year remis
sion seems to be more or less tentative in
character; indeed, It does not appear that
either the allies or Germany have agreed
on the conditions to be attached to it,
No Change in 8tocks.
No change occurred today In tho char
acter of the stock market. It was again
made un of a seemingly purposeless mix
ture of advances and declines. Wall street
went through the form or discussing tne
influence on the market, of the president's
speech to congress or of the seeming
settlement of the Irish question. ' Such
matters as these often have considerable
effect on a day's market, but not on a
market which has given no reflection to
the arms conference, and which makes
no response even to the discovery that
tne railways, as a wnoie, nave nearly ur
quite earned the objective 6 per cent In
October.
In the bond market there was no
change. Most of the Liberty bonds fell
back a small fraction and the Victory is
remained at their subscription price. The
time is now fairly near when we shall
learn whether the November bond mar
ket embodied the "reinvestment demand"
coming ahead of time or was only a fore
runner of .the actual year end. reinvestment.

number the others nearly six to one. As

they neglect the f Lti're.
This a grave nii-.take. If you believe
in your future, save for it. Be a bull on it.
