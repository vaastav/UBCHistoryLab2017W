GERMAN LINES
After Four Days of Effort, Which Bring Small Gains at
Great Cost in Casualties, the Germans Have Not Re
newed Activities in Cambrai Section; Reform Attack
ing Forces
After four ila\. of eJurt which brought them but small gains
of terrain at a great cost in casualties, the Germans have not
renewed their efforts on the Cambrai sector. 1 lie British salient
there, however, is still a menace to the security of the German
lines north and south of Cambrai and the German artillery bom
bardment is probably but the prelude to further desperate efforts
to wipe out the gains made by General Byng's troops.
British artillery yesterday broke up enemy troop concentra
tions east of Gouzeaucourt and near Moeuvres, on the southern
and northern legs of the salient, respectively, and the Germans
violently shelled the region of La Vacquerie, the center of much
of the lighting activity of the past few days.
That the German purpose may
have been to break through intO|
the Somme region as well as to blot I
out the Cambral salient is indicated j
in dfspaC'hes from the front. But i
the efforts have been futile and i
caused such losses that the letup l
in the fighting activity probably is j
due to the necessity for reforming!
the attacking forces.
Isolated enemy attacks -along the
northern Italian frortit have been
checked by the Italians but the Aus- ,
tro-Gernians have not attacked again
in force. Troop movements continue
behind the enemy lines and the Ital
ian artillery is busily shelling them. I
The Austro-German artillery has!
beer busy In the Asiago region. The |
enemy attempts broken up by the
Italians were in the Giudicaria re-j
gion, west of the Brenta and be-;
tween the Brenta and the Piave.
Eighty passengers and the crew of!
the British steamer Apapa, of 7,832
tons, were lost when the vessel was ]
torpedoed and sunk by a German |
jj-übmarine. It is reported the sub-
tired on open boats contain
ing women and children. About 120 j
passengers were rescued.
Government Operation
of Railroads Possible
During Term of War
Hy Associated Press
Washington, Dec. s. —Government
operation of railroads for the dura- i
tiun of the war, if unification of the
transportation systems is not per- i
niitted by Congress, was recommend- [
ed to-day by the Interstate Com- '
nierce Commission.
An increase in rates, a Government
loan of money and the. suspension ot i
the antitrust and th,e antipooling laws
as far as railroads are concerned for j
the duration of the war were recom- j
mended by the commission as an al- !
ternative.

| House and the other mejnbers of
1 the American mission with Gen
eral Pershing and Viscount North
cliffe, inspected the American
Army to-day. Colonel House said
he would tell President Wilson
that the energy, fitness and en
thusiasm of the men far surpass
ed anything he had expected.
"I watched the maneuvres and
saw the men work." he added.
"They are tine. I hope those boys
i realise that the security of the |

The members of the mission i
also visited the reserve officers'

quarters. Later they departed
for Paris.

Milk Samples Show Up Well
For First Time in Months
For the first time in months prac
tically every sample of milk taken by
city food inspectors and tested by the
city bacteriologist contained no colon
baccili, or disease germs. Only three
tests showed the presence of bacilli I
and only one was below the butter'
fat standard. Thirty-nine samples !
were tested during November. Deal- j
ers whoge milk was found to contain '
colon bacilli Were G. W. Attlck, 6.000 I

Rome, Dec. s.—Eneipy forces have begun an attack
on the Asiago plateau, the war office announced to-day.
The only gains achieved in the attack were some posi

fensive line.
Italian Army Headquarters in Northern Italy, Tuesday, Dec.
4.—Great forces of men and guns have been massed by the Aus
trians and Germans in the Asiago section, according to reports
reaching here tonight and resumption of the offensive is expected.
The reports indicate the enemy is employing ten divisions of
troops.
An exceptionally heavy artillery
bombardment from the enemy posi
tions around Asiago last night and
through the early hours to-day ap
pears to foreshadow the long ex
pected resumption of the heavy
enemy offensive from the north. The
cannonade was of extreme violence,
the enemy using heavy as well as
midd e caliber guns.
The first vioient eruption began
early last night. There was a lull
toward midnight and then it was

Confiscation of Gambling Ap
paratus Now Planned
by City
Mayor Keister believes that the
policemen of Harrisburg are under
paid in view of the present high
coat of living and will urge an in
crease in their salaries from Ifßs per
month to SIOO per month in the
forthcoming annual budget. The
Mayor is giving close attention to
the executive department with a view
to suggesting some traffic and other
changes with the opening or the new
year.
Gamblers and others who seemed
to have gained nn impression during
the recent municipal campaign that
they would not be disturbed in their
operations have been given a rude
jolt in Mayor Keister's order to
Chief Wetzel and the force to clear
out the Joints without delay. Suffi
cient publicity having been given
through the newspapers, the next
move will be the confiscation of all
the equipment and the arrest of till
offenders wherever they may be
found.

LONG QUIBBLE
OVER GARBAGE
DISGUSTS PUBLIC
Present Contract Has Less
Than Two Months
to Hun
Disposal of the garbage and ashes
of Harrisburg has been discussed
for many weeks and the disgusted
public is now promised a solution of
Ihe problem. Whether the garbage
shall be utilized through the pig
gery system or otherwise, said a
citizen, is not important, but what
Is important is the prompt adjust
ment of the whole matter and a
cessation of the discussion. Any re
turn to the existing arrangement
would almost invite a public up
heaval and the piggery proposal has
had wide approval as a feasible
scheme, especially as it involves a
conservation of food directly and in
directly.
With less than two months until
the present contract with the Penn
sylvania Reduction Company ends.
Council must complete all plans for
collection of ashes ahd garbage and
the organization of the bureau to
supervise this work. The garbage
problem will probably be decided in
a few days, the commissioners hav
ing called a meeting for Friday aft
ernoon to discuss the various bids
received for a private contract. Pro
viding for nsh collections under
municipal supervision will require,
more time however. Ho far coun
cil has done nothing to organize the
ash and garbage bureau or to make

Senator LaFollcttc Fails to
Join in Demonstration Given '
President's Utterances
Washington, Dee. s.—The post- |
ponement of the Austrlau war decla- I
ration by Congress until next week |
appeared probable to-day after con- j
ferences between 'Chairmen of the j
Senate and House Foreign Commit#-
teis.
Chairman Flood, of the House
Committee, said he hoped to get the j
resolution before the House to-mor
row, but postponement until FridaV
appeared probable aAd in such an
event it was not believed that the
Senate could act before next week
unless simultaneous consideration
lin both houses' could be arranged. j
( A joint resolution drafted in ac- :
ccrdance with the views of President
I Wilson and the State Department,
declaring a "state of war exists," and
"to have existed" since noon to-day,
between the United States and the
Austro-Hungarian government and
directing employment of the entire j
naval and military forces to carry]
! on war against that government, was ;
j introduced to-aay by Chairman!
j Flood, 01 the House 1' ureign Atlanrs i
Committee.
Congressional machinery to trans- j
late the President's recommendations j
into action got under way yesterday j
immediately after the delivery ot,
his message and Chairman Flood of j
I the House Committee, was ready to-1
t day to introduce in the House a
j resolution embodying the President's
! specific desires, that a state ot' war
! between the United States and Aus
| tria-Hungary be declared.
| The widespread demand for ad
j dition of Turkey and Bulgaria in the
resolution promises to be the only
I obstacle in the program I'or speedy
enactment. Kepublicans in both the
Senate and House Committees are
planning vigorously to urge such ex
tension and many Democrats are in
sympathy with them. The Senat-d
Committee has before It a resolu
tion introduced yesterday by Senator
Pittman proposing war with all Ger
many's allies.
Although few expect many nega
j tives against the war resolution in
etther house and nothing indicates
that the debates, which preceded the
action against Germany, will be re
peated, the attitude of the small
group which opposes the govern
ment's war policies is problematical.
Senator LaFollette did not join in
the demonstration given the Presi
dent's utterunces yesterday and did
not rise with the throng at various
times. However, Senator Stone,
j chairman of the Foreign Relations
M Committee, who probably will be in
J charge of the resolution in the Sen
j ate, has announced his intention of
'giving support to the prosecution of
| the war, und was in favor of defining
Austria's status.
j The President's recommendation in
| the Austrian situation, it was learned
■ last night was prompted partly be-
I causo it might be necessary at any
| time to have American soldiers in
| Italy, atid the vigorous approval of
I his position voiced by the joint ses
i sion has caused leaders to expect
I little or no delay In the completion
j of legislative sanction.

Soldiers From County
I Despite the splendid work of the
' | Red Cross organizations of this city
i and vicinity in providing sweaters

' | of the Regular and National Armies,
Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh said
! to-day that Mrs. Brumbaugh had
j discovered that there are still some
, | seventy soldiers of the several tliou

i vania who are without sweaters,
j Governor Brumbaugh In speaking
i nbout the mntter to-day said: "Mrs.
j Brumbaugh has been niaklng inquiry
Into the needs of our men who tire
in the camps preparing to take up
the work of soldiers and hn on a
number of occasions secured through
local activities relief for many boys
■j who lacked something in the way
jof comforts. It occurred to her re
i cently to look Into the status of the
boys from llarrisburg and she has
learned that there are seventy of
| the large number from this city.
I Steelton and nearby towns who are
| without sweaters. She has the names
j and the home addresses of each of
these boys and wants sweaters to
! reach them before Christmas. She
knows where these boys are now,
but this data she cannot make pub
; lie. Some of these boys may be in
I France very soon.
I , ,"1 certainly hope that the good
i people of Harrisburg will take up
this matter and provide for these
boys. Of course, I realize that a
city which has given so generously

VOICE OF A STATESMAN
Xo Hints of Compromise and
No Suggestion of Fal
tering or Doubt
W.v Associated Press
London, Dec. s.—President Wil- I
sons message to Congress has the*
fullest possible prominence in the
morning newspapers, but It reached
London too late for much considered
comment. The Daily News receives
Warmly the President's declaration
that peace should te based on gen
erosity and justice to the exclusion of
selfish claims. It adds:
"It wquld be affectation to pre
tend this language echoes tlie.decla
rations of the European spokesmen
■ of the alliance. I' is the voice of a
statesman whose comprehends the
world, while theirs corniprehend only
half a world.
"If President Wilson could have
said earlier what he said yesterday
and if in Great Britain, France and
Italy the responsible leaders had
j made his language their own, Russia
i might be to-day driving the enemies
- from her borders."
The Times says there are no half
tones in the President's address, add
ing:
"There are no ambiguous phrases
on which militarists may feed the
illusions of their dupes, no hints of
compromise and no suggestion of
faltering or doubt to raise the spirits
lof the pacific. • * • with this
j straightforward and logical state
; ment of America's war aims the last
j hope of the pacifists must founder.''
| The Daily Graphic says:
"Whe her this restatement, so
i lofty in spirit, so forward looking in
effect, will have any influence on
I German opinion is doubtful. Then
the only resort is to inflict such a
! military defeat upon Germany as to
j convince th Germans of the Infa
mousness of their rulers."
