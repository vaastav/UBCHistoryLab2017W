The President’s Message.
We have not space, or we would lay the Pres
ident’s Message before our readers. It is com
paratively brief, and this is Ihe only merit that
it seems to possess. We presume, however, that
it has been very generally read by this time, and
therefore deem an abstract of its contents unne
cessary.
The most prominent subject of the Message, is
the emancipation project. This scheme the Pres
ident presses with some earnestness, and appears
to think the abolition of slavery will yet save
the country. We confess that we have never yet
understood how it is to do it. If slavery had
stood in the way of the formalion of the Union,
or the adoption of the Constitution, there then
might be some reason in this abolition position
of the President; or if the people of the country
had declared in its favor, some-excuse might be
set up for this interference with the domestic in
stitutions of the States. But what is the fact,
the President, at the election two years ago, re
ceived 1,100,000 votes less than a majority of the
whole vote cast, and not a single electoral vote
in any Slave State; and at the elections which
took place in October and November last, one of
the main issues between the Administration party
and the Democratic party, was this very question
of emancipation. Every body knows Vae result
of this contest; the Administration party was ut
terly routed in six of the largest and most impor
tant Free Slates in this Union. With one hun
dred and seven thousand majority in New York,
one year ago, they could not save themselves
from defeat, and in the States yet to vote they can
not hope for better success. Now, in all candor,
who is to be gratified by this emancipation
scheme of the President? Surely not the
Slave States, for if they had desired the abolition
of Slavery, they had the power to abolish it at
any time ; net the six States above referred to,
for they condemned it by unmistakable majori
ties, less than two months ago ; not the Demo
cratic party anywhere, for every Democratic
newspaper in the country condemns it, and
every Democratic convention has resolved posi
tively against it—and, in fact, conservative men
every where condemn the project, as unjust and
wrong. Who then are Ihe parties to be gratified
by the adoption of the President’s grand emana
tion scheme ? Lovojoy, Banks, Greeley, Sumner
& Co. desire it, of course, and they must be grati
fied though the country be ruined thereby.

Congress,
The second regular session of the Thirty-sev
enth Congress commenced at Washington on
Monday last, in the House of Representatives,
Mr. Valhindigham offered a resolution, which
was adopted, instructing the Committee on the
Judiciary to enquire by what authority of the
Constitution and laws the Postmaster General
undertakes to decide what newspapers may, and
what shall not, be transmitted through the Uni
ted St ties mail.
Mr. Cox, Democrat, from Ohio, offered a pre
amble and resolutions, condemning the illegal
arrests and imprisonments, and declaring against
them in future. Laid on the table, on motion of-
Mr. Colfax, Abolitionist, from Indiana.
This is the last session of this Congress. 1 1
has but a short time to live, it is true; but in
that time they may do rape-h harm. If what has
heretofore been done by them, is to be taken as
evidence of what they may hereafter do, it would
have been a blessing to the country if, after a
session of ten seconds, they had adjourned for
ever. No set of men ever misrepresented their
constituents more completely than the present
members have, and none could surely have done
less to relieve the country kora the terrible con
dition into which it has been brought by Aboli
tionism. Whether this neglect was intentional,
or through mistake, the people can judge; but
of one thing we are certain, and that is, that
when the fourth of March shall come, this peo
ple will rejoice that the thirty-seventh Congress
has finally closed its labors—and not a few of
them will, with ourselves, join in the hope that
we shall never look upon their like again.
Electoral Vote.
The States which have recently voted against
the Abolitionists, would give, at a Presidential
election, one hundred and nineteen votes—every
rote of which Lincoln received two years ago,
except seven. These constitute a large majority
of all the electoral votes of the States remaining
in the Union; and had it been a Presidential
election, the Democratic candidate would have
been elected by more than two-thirds of the elec
toral vote. This, we think, should satisfy every
one — even the Abolitionists —that the Democratic
party still lives.
One thing, however, in regard to the elections
just poised, is worthy of note; that is, the re
markable nnanimity with which the homes of
the President and Cabinet condemned them. It
may and sometimes does happen, that a Presi
dent, or a Cabinet officer loses his own State, but
nothing like this general verdict has ever before
been known in this country. Illinois, the home
of ths President; New York, the home of the
Secretary of State; Ohio, the home of the Seen
i tary of the Treasury ; Indiana, the home of the
Secretary of the Interior; Pennsylvania, the
home of the Secretary of War—all at the late
elections went Democratic; nnd in Connecticut,
the home of the Secretary of the Navy, the Dem
ocrats have carried the town elections. This is
a defeat more sudden and overwhelming than
ever overtook any political party in this country,
previous to the year eighteen hundred and sixty
two.
WAR NEWS.
Seven boats loaded with troops, being, part of
Ihe fleet from Cincinnati, arrived at and depart
ed from Cairo, on Nov. 24. The gunboats are
taking powder on board, and leaving as fast as
they are got ready. 1 is said that the Lower
Mississippi will be the scene of stirring events
before many days have passed.
Advices from New Orleans report a powerful
squadron concentrating there. Great activity
also prevailed among the military, preparatory
to offensive movements. Confederate
parties still infest the river banks both above
and below the city.
We may soon hear of stirring events in the
Southwest. A despatch states that Gen. Sher
man’s forces left Memphis on Wednesday, and
that Gen. Grant’s army moved towards Holly
Springs on Friday, in fighting trim. The Con
federates were reported to be falling back to
wards Grenada, burning the bridges after them.
Advices received at New York, from Nassau,
show that several Confederate steamers had ar
rived there lately, among them the Leopard,
having run the blockade from Charleston. The
Leopard ran into Charleston some weeks ago,
with a valuable cargo.
It is stated that five of the new iron-clads will
be ready for sea before Monday next. Each is
armed with a 15-iuch gun, the effect of which
upon a fortress is yet to be demonstrated by ex
periment.
When last seen, the Confederate steamer Ala
bama was in lat. 47.30, ion. 70.15, which is
about the latitude of Richmond, and about five
hundred miles off the coast.
General Stahl returned to Chantilly on Sun
day, from a successful reconnoissancc through
the country west of Washington and east of the
Blue Ridge. Snicker’s and Ashby’s Gaps were
visited, and no Confederates seen in the former,
but at Ashby’s a few pickets were stationed, who
retired op the appearance of the Federal forces.
Several skirmishes occurred during the move
ment, in which the Confederates lost, it is
said, some fifty killed and wounded, mid forty
taken prisoners. The Federal loss was about
fifteen killed and wounded.
A fight occurred at Cove Hill, Missouri, on
Thursday Inst, in which the Confederates were
defeated. The battle lasted three hours, the
Confederates fighting while falling back.
The news from Burnside’s army, in the vicin
ity of Fredericksburg, is interesting. The com
manders of both armies appear to be fortifying
their positions nnd mounting heavy guns. On
Friday night a force of Confederates crossed the
Rappahannock at Big Ford, not far from Fal
mouth, and succeeded in capturing some three
hundred men belonging to the 12th and 17th re
giments of New York infantry, attached to Gen
eral Butterfield's army corps. The captured
men belonged to the brigade of Col. Stockton,
and it is reported that Gen. Hooker became so
much incensed at the loss, although Stockton
was not in immediate command, that he broke
the sword of the Colonel, and dismissed him
him from the service on the spot. The Confederate
success nt Hartwood, in which a portion of Hamp
ton’s Legion succeeded in capturing a number of
cavalrymen, turns out to be more disastrous
than was at first announced. It now appears
that four companies—not two, as stated yesterday
—of the 3d Pennsylvania cavalry were made
prisoners. Out of the four companies only twen
ty-five men escaped—five commissioned officers
fell into the hands of the Confederates.
Splendid Winter Fashions. —We have again

Robbery. —On Thursday night week, the store
of Mr. Jacob Miunick, living nt the Hickory,
about three miles north of this place, was entered
and robbed of a large amount of goods. Mr.
Minnick has not yet been able to ascertain bis
entire loss, but among the goods stolen, were
numerous articles of ready-made clothing, shoes,
boots and hats, together with a large amoflß of
cotton goods, gun caps, powder, shot, tobacco,
Ac. The thief entered the store through the
front door, which he appears to have forced open
with a crow-bar or some such instrument.—
There was, we are informed, about S3OO or S4OO
in the store at the time, but fortunately it was
overlooked by the robbers, who only succeeded
in getting about eight dollars in change. No
discovery of the stolen property, or of the thief,
has we believe yet been made.

SOCIAL SPIES. '
How slran ge is the mind of man, ever • 1
11
bussing itself with the causes which pro-1 (
ducc effects in the intellectual undspitiiu-i i
al world around him—yet seemingly, ob- i
livious of the operations of his own mind, 1
not noting its spring of action !
During the French Revolution—in
those days fitly called, “the reign of ter
ror”—we read tliat the mob of Paris be
came an organized body of spies, each in
dividual of that, tumultuous crowd busied
himself in ferreting out of his neighbor
his ancestry, his habits, his political pre-1
ferences; and then taking wliat was said
in careless conversation before sucb a tri
bunal as that presided over by Robes
pierre, Coutlum, St. Just and Rarree, the
miserable victim of misplaced confidence
was consigned to an ignominious death.
I have often thought tliat unwittingly
every man in society became a spy on his
neighbors, using bis intercourse as a !
means of catching that neighbor in some
imprudent words or actions; and yet, what
man would acknowledge this fact ? I
said every man is a spy,; but this needs
qualification. 1 would not do injustice
to that little bund who stand aloof in this
respect from the crowd, and who put the
fairest construction on the words and deeds j
of those around them ; whose own purity '
of motive reflects itself upon those with
whom they associate, and who draw those
kind feelings from their own good hearts.
Having made this exception, as in duty
bound, I proceed to" discuss tho character
of that evidence which these social spies
—which com j rise the majority of society
—make use of, in their efforts to bring
an associate into disrepute. To take upj
a name which has never been blazoned
with calumny, and represent its possessor
in such a light tliat he would fail to recog
nize himself, is to the social spy a pleasant
and innocent excitement. To judge these
spies by their own words and actions, as
startling a catalogue of supposed motives j
for them might be enumerated, as would
suffice to cover them with confusion and
chagrin. These social spies discard truth
as a superfluous ornament in discourse ;
the appearance of truth is all they desire
in their embellished narratives, and this,
oftentimes, they discard. Those spies lis
ten to one version of an affair, and without
one glance at the other side, form a judg
ment, and act upon it, as if they were
capable of knowing the motives which ac
tuate, by some unknown but reliable pro
cess. A social spy feels a glow of jj/ens
ait indignation, alter looking at an acti n
from bis own point of view, and expatiates
on tho falseness, and deceit of a char
actor never before assailed. How true it
is that those whose own actions are the
purest, are the most charitable ! Perhaps
the knowledge of the frailty of their own
heart, makes those characters so tender of
the frailties of their fellow creatures.
It it time indeed, that the great social i
evil of having spies in our midst, should
be put down, it is time- to assume a de
fensive warfare, and to entrench ourselves
behind the ramparts of aversion, scorn and
indifference, when wan ing against an ene
any which violates our most sacred rights
and honor.
The “Prince of Peace” left usan exam
ple in this great matter. Ho taught that
charity which “thiuketh no evil, which
hopetlr all things, bclieveth all things,
and which rejoiceth in the truth.’’ Ho
tells us,, “charity covcreth a multitude of
sins.” As we grow like Him, so shall we
more and more exercise charity towards
those around us,
“Owning their weakness, their evil behavior,
But leaving, with meekness, their sins
To their Saviour. 1 ’

THE BASTILES OF AMERICA.
The Rastile in France was simply a
prison for the confinement, of persons sus
pected of political acts or opinions not in
conformity with the government standard.
The “horrors of tho Rastile” consisted in
the closeness of the iuearecration.—
The prisoners were fed and cared for ac
cording to their degree ; nor were cruel
ties practiced upon mem, except when de
tected in attempting to escape.
Yet when tho Rastile fell, the world
shouted with enthusiasm. It was at once
the implement and the emblem of tyran
nical power The key of the dilapidated
fortress and prison was sent by the French
Directory to George Washington, to tell
the people of America, in the person of
tho noblest champion of their liberties,
that another link was broken of the chain 1
which despotism had forged to enslave
mankind.
We, the people of the United Slates,
for two or three generations, have looked
upon that ponderous key and woudered ;
wondered tout men could have permitted
tho system which it, represented to grow
into an institution'holding a recognized
and permitted place in the government of
a polite and intelligent people ; wondered
if we or our posterity could ever become
so slavish and degenerate as to allow, in
our country, a similar establishment. Wo
have protested to ourselves that no such
thing could or should be permitted; uud 1
that on the first symptom of its approach
such would be the spirit of a liberty-loving
people that they would rise at once and
prostrate in the dust nut only the prison,
but those by whom it was ordained.
•
The American Bastiles—lor we have
many—differ from the French only that
they are. le.-s comfortable. - The confine
ment is the same; it* the arrests there is
even less formality ; there is no trial;
the prisoner receives naintimation of the
nature of the off use with which he is charg
ed ; the seizure of the individual is accom
panied with the examination of his papers,
under a pretense ot seeking testimony; and
his discharge—apparently as causeless as
his arrest —is made without a word of ex
planation.
The prisoner knows that be has been
punished ; hut he knows not for what,
nor at whose instance ; nor what tribunal
passed sentence upon him. He Stepped
from light into darkness, nod from dark
ness into light; from freedom to confine
ment, and from confinement to freedom ;
and the silence of the grave broods over
the causes for and tho agencies through
which he suffered
We have traveled back, at a single leap,
a great ways behind the French people of
the revolutionary period, and have immer
sed ourselves in the political darkness of
the Middle Ages. We have done more.
Wc do not know that a single French au
thor over wrote in praise of the Rastile.—
No Frenchman, so tar as we have heard,
ever prostituted his pen in culling upon
iiis monarch to go on and multiply the
number of bis arbitrary arrests and im
prisonments.
It, lias been reserved for more than half
the intelligent and independent press of
this free and enlightened country ; a press
that has been holdcn up to the admiration
of the world as the defender of I lie right,
regis of liberty, the champion of, freedom,
the fountain of new ideas and the grand
education of the people, not only to defend
the institution upon tho ground of prinei
i pie, but to applaud each official exercise of
irresponsible power, and keep up a fero
cious and continual clamor tliat the num
ber of victims should bo greatly increas
ed.
Looking back over our literature, we
the people of the United States will need
an official index ixpnryationas. From the
Fourth of July orations of two-thirds of a
century, wc must carefully erase all allu
sions to the Rastile, tliat emblem of tyran
ny. Out favorite national hymn needs a
change to suit it to the progressive notions
of tho times; and where it reads “the
land of the free and the home of the
brave,’’ a Boston poet might be profitably
employed to strike out the obsolete phra
seology, and introduce something about
the right of the President to suspend the!
habeas corpus.
It, is well that the people have awakened
slowly and gradually to a sense of the.in
jury that has been inflicted upon them. —
Had they done otherwise—had they
sprung at once into a full consciousness of
the wrongs to which they have been ex
posed, and under which so many have suf
fered, the country would have been deluged
in blood. It is a t hing for which there is
abundant ground for thankfulness, that
the impatience of some to resist and resent
has been met by the inertia of the majori
ty. But it, is a mistake to suppose that all |
these wrongs will tint, bo resented and]
avenged Just as certainly ns effect fol
lows cause will the appropriate retribution
occur.
Rut, for nil this, wo do not suppose that
the United Stales arc yet in a fit condition
to be enslaved. We do not suppose that
they will be in such a condition. We do
not believe tliat they, or any part of them,
will long submit to a rule which is not of
themselves, and docs not reflect their wills
and opinions. They have been taken by
surprise. The very fact that they were
unaccustomed to tyranny rendered them
incautious respecting its approaches.—
Surrounded by circumstances to them ex
traordinary and unprecedented, they rea
dily listened to the plea that extraordina
ry measures were necessary, and did not
at once sec the fallacy of the pretense that
tit preserve the liberties of the whole, it
was allowable to take away the .liberties of
the individual. They listened to that ty
rant’s plea, proper enough when properly
made, the plea of necessity, and confiding
ly surrendered the guardianship of their
j rights, in the belief that they were simply
making an offering upon tho altar of their
country.
These American Bastiles will all come
down —not perhaps through being razed
to the ground by the hands of an incensed
populace, hut by standing as despised and
dismantled monuments of a tyranny shar
pened by a sense of weakness, too blind to
discriminate between friends and enemies,
and too headstrong to care for the differ
ence, of which they have been the thea
tres: and the administration that has cm
i employed them for uses so base, and the
: party that has encouraged and applauded
its practices, will cune down. Tliat time
which, in the end, makes all things even,
will do the work, without any active hu
man agenC-y; and surely us tho mould set
tles upon the face of the dead, so surely
will lasting memories which added togeth
er make infamy, fall upoo tho names of
all who have advised or perpetrated these
crimes against liberty.
“Vox Populi, Vox Dei.”—Mr. Lin
coln told the Chicago Ministers that he
found much difficulty in ascertaining the
| Divine will, touching his duty in refer
ence to slavery in the States. If the voice
of tho people is really the voice ot God,
us the Latin asserts, he may gi t some light
on the subject by ‘taking a squint’ at tho
j election returns. —1 rovidence Post.
Release of Political Prisoners.
The following is the official order re
leasing lho political prisoners from Foil
Warren.
Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, I
November 27th, 1862. j

The above named prisoners are released,
agreeable to the following telegram :

Col. Ist Artil’y, Com. Fort.
Colonel J. Dimmick, United States Army,
Fort Warren, Boston :
The Secretary of War directs that, you
release all the Maryland State prisoners ;
also any other State prisoners that may be
in your custody, and report to this office.

. Col. Ist. Art’y Com’g Fort.
Fort Warren, November 27, 1862.
The Boston Courier, iu publishing tho
order for tho release of the prisoners, re
marks :
Tho phraseology of the order will strike
some persons as a little promiscuous. —
The names specified appear only in the
certificate of release furnished by Col.
Dimmick, while (lie order of the depart
ment only mentions in general terms “all
the Maryland State prisoners”—and, so
that none may be overlooked in this act of
amnesty, “any other State prisoners” in
the custody of the commandant. We in
fer from this that as these gentlemen were
arrested without warrant, and have been
held iu prison without law, so no record
ot their names oven, much less any speci
fication of their imputed offenses, has been
kept at the War Department. Wo must
say that, this seems to us a very irresponsi
ble way of doing public business; and
none the less so that among the gentlemen
released are persons of not a little social
distinction and public consideration—for
instance the lute Mayor of Baltimore, and
the various members of the Maryland
Legislature, who were seized and incarce
rated when that body was broken up by
the violent action of the administration,
more than a year ago. Wo have under
stood that the arrest in question was then
made by order of one. of Mr. Lincoln’s
Secretaries, without the knowledge of the
others, or of the President; and also that
at the very time reports were iu prepara
tion by committees of both b unches ot the
Legislature, showing she uucoiistitutiunal
ity of secession, which would undoubtedly
have been accepted by the Legislature,
had no such extraordinary interference
been had witii that assembly.
Iu consequence of that action, however,
these gentlemen have now been tmprisogj
ed during this long period; and at lust t heir
| prison doors are thrown open., and they
j are permitted to go at large without any
condition, it being well known that they
steadily declined placing themselves io
the awkward and not very honorable po
sition of thus acknowledging themselves
guilty of charges which had never been
j exhibited figainst them. They have had
I the personal inconveniences of this confine
ment; butjt is plain that instead of victims,
they thus come out triumphant! and that
only the natural indignation with which
they and their friends will look back upon
this useless persecution, remains. Let us
trust that we have had the last example of
such unwarrantable and unjustifiable exer
cise of brief authority.
