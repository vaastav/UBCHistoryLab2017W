EDITORIAL PARAGRAPHS.
The message is a good document to
keep handy on the library reference
shelf.
Peace is a pleasant word to write
over the entrance to the Christmas
season.
For so long a document the message
is singularly lacking in places that
can be skipped.
The message shows that the United
States has been making great strides
since last April,
To relinquish sovereignty is not so
very hard when it lias been practically
lost for several years.
The Oregon and lowa are steaming
steadily toward the Pacific. They will
not be needed at Cadiz.
The Spanish government may thank
this country for a fine opportunity to
retrench foreign expenditures.
Our new possessions will quickly be
put in shape to pay their way. The
Nicaragua canal also may be expected
to do that.
Now that the treaty is signed the
United States and Spain can be as
signed adjoining seats at the Czars
peace congress.
Senators voting against the ratifica
tion of the treaty will be accused of
wanting to reopen the war and take
in the Canaries.
Aguinaldo’s name is not in the mes
sage and if he is sensible he will con
duct himself so as not to need
presidential mention.
The country has made a long march
between the messages of 1897 and 1898
and is not afraid to hold the ground
it has rightfully secured.
Government expenditurers were
larger than the revenue last year, but
it took a war to keep down an old
fashioned republican surplus.
President McKinley is a prudent
man in what he speaks or writes. He
is not apt to discuss the results ol
treaties before they are signed.
The Porto Ricans are busy raising
sugar and tobacco and accepting all
the 100 c dollars that come their way.
As incipient Yankees they have
merit.
The luck of the American navy,
sometimes referred to, is another
name for hard work, steady discipline
high intelligence and indomitable
courage.
It is remarked that the president’s
message would make a large book.
The space of a first-class newspaper is
equal to presenting several sizable
books daily.
Havana is ready and anxious for the
American occupation. It is looking
forward with much pleasure to getting
its money's worth in dealing with a
public officer.
There is no longer an impression at
Madrid that the chief Yankee charac
teristic is commercialism. Several
other points worth considering have
been discovered.
The Nicaragua canal should be built
and controlled by this government.
Such is the position taken in the mes
sage and backed up by the people
almost unanimously.
Many members of the volunteer
regiments sent to Cuba have re-en
listed in the regular army. The fault
finders are more numerous in political
than in army circles.
Senator Lodge says, “Isolation in
the United States has been a habit,
not a policy." It may be added that
expansion also has been a habit, and
frequently illustrated.
Hawaii is commended by the presi
dent for having decided to “share our
political heritage.’’ If the Cubans
arc wise they will vote for the same
kind of free government.
Bankers in Cuba are not keeping
much cash on hand in these times of
“immediate evacuation.” A hold-up
by the retiring Spanish officials is just
as expensive as any other kind.
“The largest volume of business
ever recorded” is mentioned in the
message as a proof of prosperity. That
this should come to pass in a year of
war is a remarkable circumstance.
A Mexican silver dollar is still
quoted at less than 47c, but Missouri
zinc is booming at the highest prices
exer known. Free coinage lectures
are at a discount in the zinc country.
As soon as Congress provides for an
adequate regular army all the volun
teers, the president announces, will
be mustered out. Congress will prob
ably act on this question without
delay.
During tl.> war 1535 mines were
placed in the principal harbors of the
United States from Main to Califor
nia. The length of our coast line was
realized when its defense became
necessary.
Of 750 food and drug samples ana
lyzed by the state authorities in New
Jersey 208 were found to be adulter
ated. The people of the United State
are far behind the English in protect-
ing themselves from this dangerous
form of fraud.
The olive and the laural will supply
the green garniture for Uncle Sam's
Christmas stocking.
The United States is for peace and
has learned something about the best
way to preserve it. The plan is not to
let the army and navy run down.
Gen. Garcia thinks the annexation
of Cuba is a possibility of the future,
though he is not its advocate now.
The general will be rapidly educated
when he looks into the practical facts
of the situation.
Montojo’s ten war-ships at Manila
are referred to by the president as “a
formidable fleet.” There has been an
effort to disparage those ships, but
their armament in some respects was
better than Dewey’s.
In a hundred years the United
States has grown from thirteen states
to forty-five. The expansion of the
past is by no means a slight thing to
contemplate and everybody is satisfied
that it was right and advisable.
Some of the democrats are discour
aged because they think the president
can get anything in congress that he
wants. The last president found it
difficult to get anything he wanted
from his own party in or out of con
gress.
Trial shipment of American agri
cultural products are to he sent to
China, Japan and elsewhere in East
ern Asia. Our farmers are feeding
several foreign countries and stand
ready to enlarge their orders indefi
nitely.
The total number of killed and
wounded in both army and navy in
the war with Spain is stated in the
message to be 1068. No one supposed
at the beginning of hostilities that
casualties could be kept down to this
extent.
The Cubans will notice that the
president fully recognizes their right
to choose their free form of govern
ment as soon as the island is thor
oughly pacified. If th£y have any
doubt in this subject the message will
remove it.
WHAT IT MEANS.
True Significance of the Result of the
Elections of 1898.
The election of a republican house
of representatives is an expression of
popular satisfaction with tne results
of republican financial and "economic
policies. The last two years have been
years of prosperity for nearly all inter
ests. Most of the manufacturing in
dustries of the country revived under
theDingley tariff, and while finding
an improved home market, due to the
larger employment of labor and the
consequent freer distribut ion of money
among the people, a number of them
ha\ T e also considerably increased the
exports of their products. The agri
cultural interest has prospered as al
most never before. This is largely
due to an exceptional foreign demand
for food stuffs, but there has also been
a very material increase in the con
sumption of our own people, made
possible by the policy which gave em
ployment to labor that was idle under
the operation of democratic policy.
The cond i tion of the wage earners has
been greatly Improved, as the statis
tics of savings conclusively show, and
while it is true that there are still
many idle people in the country, the
number is far less than two years ago,
while the average of wages paid in
most industries is higher. The com
merce of the nation, domestic and
foreign, has been greater during the
past two years than in any other equal
period in our history, the accumula
tion of capital has been enormous, the
supply of money has largely increased
and the price of money was never
lower than now. These conditions
are known to the people and a large
majority are content with the policies
that have produced them, or tinder the
operation of which their realization
was made possible. Every man who
is able to reason from cause to effect
understands that they could not-have
been realized with free silver and a
so-called tariff-for-revenue only.
The election of a republican bouse
of representatives means that a ma
jority of the American people approve
of the energy and vigor with which
the administration prosecuted the war
against Spain and are too fair and con
siderate to permit a few faults and
defects to detract from the achiex’e
ment of one of the most remarkable
triumphs in theannalsof war. Doubt
less some were deterred from support
ing republican candidates by the crit
icisms of the war department, but xve
are disposed to think that the number
of such was not very great. So far as
the question of territorial expansion
is concerned it was nowhere really an
issue, so that the result of the con
gressional elections cannot fairly be
regarded as having any bearing on
that question.
The election of a republican bouse
of representatives was a blow, perhaps
i decisive blow, to free silver. Nearly
all the gains of democratic represent
atives were made in states where the
money question did not enter into the
campaign and most of the men elected
are understood to be for sound money.
This reaffirmation of the popular ver
dict of two years ago will strengthen
financial confidence and improve the
conditions that make for prosperity.
Finally, the election of a republican
house of representatives, with a sen
ate in political accord, means that
there will be harmony between the
legislative and the executive branches
of the government in dealing with
he questions grow ing out of the war,
nd that these will be considered and
iisposed of not from a partisanstand
‘-ptnnt. put with a patriotic td
conserve the best interests of the
American people. For the second
time in twenty-five years a congres
sional election has gone in favor of
the administration midway in its
term of office and at no time since the
civil war was such a result so impor
tant as now.—Omaha Bee.
nekoosa.
Is a village of over five hundred people situated
on the west bank of the Wisconsin river about
eight mile? south of the twin cities of Grand
Rapids and Centralia in Wood county. It is on
the C. M. & St. P. Ry running north from New
Lisbon to Tomahawk The Nekoosa Paper com
pany, have their Pulp, Paper and Sulphite
plant located here and its a thriving institu
tion and a promising village.
The Nekoosa Paper Cos., recently had
their vvoodroom re-organized and im
proved with all the modern attachments
used in the rapid and accurate handling
of wood. This company uses about
40.000 cords of pulp wood and about
15.000 cords of fuel wood each year and
necessarily there is considerable ex
pense attached therewith. Most of this
wood is brought to the company’s yard
by rail and has been loaded "and un
loaded by hand. This expense is enor
mous and the matter of saving part of
it was left with Millwright J. C. Jacobson
of Grand Rapids to solve. He invented a
carrier that is a great success. It is the
opinion of all those who have watched
the working of the wood carrier now in
use in the company’s yard, that Mi.
Jacobson has succeeded in saving the
company at least 50 per cent of the
amount heretofore expended in the
handling of their wood. A test was
made the past week by John Brennan,
who has charge of the wood yard, to
see what advantage there was in using
Mr. Jacobson’s recent invention. He
had six men load a car bv hand, the old
way, while six other men used the ma
chine. The six men working with the
machine loaded two cars, and carried
the wood three times as far as the six
men who loaded one car by hand. The
wood carrier consists of a wooden frame
40 feet long, in two parts, resting upon
standards over which two endless
chains, two feet apart and with lugs
every four feet, are propelled bv one
horse power. This device will carry
wood four, eight, twelve or sixteen feet
long and as large as two feet in diam
eter. The machine rests on either run
ners or rollers to suit the season, At
present it is on runners. It is easily
moved from one place to another. The
company is well pleased with tire ma
chine and have ordered the erection ol
a second one. Mr Jacobson can see
where he can improve upon the first
machine and will do so in the erection
of the second one.
