. SALT TARIFFS.
The Kansas' Railroad Commissioners Ad
just the Rates.
Topeka, Kan., Dec 8. The Rail
road Commissioners have rendered
their decision in the matter of the com
plaint of the Board cf Trade . and salt
producers of Kingman of unfair dis
crimination in railroad rates on salt.
The Board, after reviewing the facts in
the case, say:
"We are of the opinion that the salt
tariffs to local points need revision in
the interest of all those concerned.
But this involves so many adjustments,
not only as it respects the salt interests,
but as well those that concern the car
riers, that its final consideration will be
entered upon at ' another time, and
further notice to parties in interest.
"Upon the complaint before us we
find and decide that the rate on salt
from Kingman, Anthony and Welling
ton should be the same to all Missouri
river points as the rate on like com
modities , from Hutchinson, Mickerson
and Sterling, and the board directs and
orders that such rates be made uniform
from all the points above named.
"The board also finds that the fuel
used in the manufacture of salt is slack
coal supplied from the coal mines of
Southeastern Kansas. The cost of this
per ton delivered at Wellington is $2.45,
and the freight rate is $1.70; at King
man, $2.65, and the freight rate $2; at
Anthony $2.75 per ton, and the freight
rate $2, and Hutchinson $2.40 per ton
and freight rate $1.80. We think that
in justice to so important an industry
as the salt manufacture in this State a
concession should be made on these
rates as follows:
. "Rate on coal slack to Wellington
$1.30 per ton and to all the other points
of salt manufacture in the State $1.50
per ton. And believing under existing
circumstances that these rates would
be fair and reasonable the board or
ders and directs that these rates on
coal slack, together with uniform rates
on salt to Missouri river points, be
adopted and made effective upon all
railroads operating to any of the points
named by December 15, 1889."

MONEY SAVED.
What the Missouri State Board Mas Saved
to the People.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8. Mr.
Downing, of the State Railroad Com
mission, says that a single decision of
the Commission rendered in a coal case
several months ago, in which this city

000 a year. The figures were given him

the most thorough railroad ac
countants in the country. Ac
cording to the decision the
coal rate was reduced from 55 to 35
cents per ton. Mr. Downing claims

The AustraUan System.
Portland, Me., Dec 8. The Ad

mayors of Maine cities, county attor

favor the adoption of . tbe Australian

there can no longer be any doubt that
the next Legislature in Maine will pass
a similar law without serious opposi

PEESIDENTS MESSAGE.
President Harrison's First Meseegre
to Congress.
Our Cordial Foreign Relations Recom
mendations as to Tariff Revision The
Surplus, Pensions and Other
Matters Discussed.
WAsnrsGTOjr, Dec 4. The President's mes
age wub received in both houses of Congress
yesteroay at noon and is piuicipally as fol
lows: To the Senate and Home of Eevreentatiee:
Few transactions in the administration of
government are even temporarily held in
the confidence of those charged with the
conduct ot public business. Every step
taken is under the observation of an intelli
gent and watchful people. The state of the
Union is known from day to day and sugges
tions as to needed legislation find an earlier
voice than that which speaks in these an
nual communications of the President to
Congress.
Goodwill and cordiality have character
ized our relations and correspondence with
other Governments, and the year closed
leaves few international questions of impor
tance unadjusted. Xo obstacle is believed
to exist that can long postpone the consider
ation and adjustment of stiU pending ques
tions upon satisfactory and honorable terms.
The dealings of this Government with other
States have been marked by frankness and
sincerity, our purposes avowed and our
methods free from intrigue. This course
has borne rich fruit in the past, and it ts our
duty as a Nation to preserve the heritage of
gooa repute wnicn a century of right dealing
wun ioreign uovernments nas secured to us.
It is a matter of significance and no less ot
congratulations that the first year of the
second century of our constitutional exist
ence finds as honored guests within our bor
ders the representatives of all the independ
ent States of North and South America met
together in earnest conference touching the
pest methods of perpetuating and expand
ing the relations of mutual interest and
friendliness existing among them. That
the opportunity thus afforded, for pro
moting closer international relations and
the increased prosperity of the States repre
sented will be used for the mutual good of
all I can not permit myself to doubt. Our
people will await with interest and con
fldence the results to flow from so auspicious
a meeting of allied and in large part identical
interests. .
Becommendations of this International
conference of enlightened statesmen will
have the attention of Congress and its co
operation in the removal of unnecessary bar
riers between the Xations of America. But
while the commercial results which it is
hoped will follow this conference are worthy
of praise and the great interest they have
excited, it is believed the crowning benefit
will be found in the better securities which
may be devised for the maintenance of peace
among all American Xations and settlement
of all contentions bv methods Christian
civilization can approve. While viewing
with interest our Xational resources and
products, the delegates, I am sure, will find a
higher satisfaction in the evidences of un
selfish friendship which everywhere attends
the intercourse with our people.
An international marine conference, hav
ing great possibilities for good, has lately
assembled and is now in session in this cap
ital. An invitation was extended by the Gov
ernment, under the act of Congress of July
9, 1888, to aU maritime nations to
send delegates to confer touching the
revision and amendment of the rules
and regulations governing vessels and to
adopt a uniform system of marine signals.
The response to this invitation has been
very general and very cordial. Dele
gates from twenty-six Xations are
present in the conference and
they have entered upon their useful
work with great zeal and with an evident
appreciation of its importance. So far as the
agreement to be reached may require legis
lation to give it effect the co-operation of Con;
gress is confidently relied upon. It is an in
teresting and unprecedented fact that the
two international conferences have brought
here the accredited representatives of thirty
three Xations. Bolivia, Ecuador and Hon
duras are now represented by resident en
voys of the plenipotentiary grade. All the
States of the American system now maintain
diplomatic relations at this capital.
RELATIONS WITH CHINA.
Our relations with China have the atten-t
tintive consideration which their magnitude
and interest demand. The failure of the
treaty negotiated under, my predecessor for
the further and more complete restriction of
Cbiaese labor, immigration and with it the
legislation of the last session of Congress
dependent thereon leaves some questions
open which Congress should now approach
is that wise and just spirit which should
characterize the relations of two great and
friendly powers, while our supreme interests
demand the exclusion of a laboring element
which experience has shown to be incom
patible with our social life. .All steps
to compass this imperative need should
be accompanied with a recognition of the
claim of those strangers now -lawfully among
us to humane and just treatment. The acces
sion of the young Emperor of China marks,
we may hope, an era of progress and pros
perity lor the great country over which he is
called to rule.
6 AM OAS AFFAIK3.
The present state of affairs in respect to
the Samoan Islands is encouraging. The
conference which was held in ' this
city in the summer of 1SS3 between
the representatives of the United States,
Germany and Great Britain had been ad
journed because of tbe persistent divergence
of views which was developed in its delib
erations. The subsequent course of events in
the islands gave rise to questions of a seri
ous character. On the 4th of FSruary last
the German Minister at this capital in behalf
of his Government proposed a resumption
of the conference at Berlin. This proposi
tion was accepted, as Congress in February
last was Informed. Pursuant to the under
standing thus reached commissioners were
appointed by me, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, who proceeded to Ber
lin and the conference was resumed. The
deliberations extended througu several
weeks and resulted in the conclusion ot a
treaty which will be submitted to the Senate
for its approval.
BRITISH AFFAIRS.
The questions which have arisen during
the past few years between Great Britain
and the United States are in abeyance or in
course of adjustment.
On the part of the Government of the Do
minion of Canal a an effort has bees ftp
parent during tbe season just ended to ad
minister the laws and regulations applicable
to the fisheries with as little occasion for
friction as was possible, and the temperate
repressions of this Government in re
spect of cases of undue hardship or of harsh
representations have In most cases been met
with measures of transitory relief. It is
trusted that tbe attainment of onr Just rights
.under existing treaties and by virtue of the
concurrent legislation of the two contiguous
countries will uot be long delayed and that
all existing cause of differences may be
equitably adjusted.
OTBKK FOHEIGTT QUE8TIOS5.
The importance of the commerce of Cuba
and Porto Bico with the United States, their
nearest and principal market, justifies the
expectation that the existing relations may
be beneficially expanded. The impediments
resulting from varying dues on navigation
and from the vexatious treatment of our ves
sels on merely technical grounds of com
plaints in West India ports, should be re
moved. The progress toward an adjustment of
pending claims between the United States
and Spain is not so rapid as could be desired.
Questions affecting American interests in
connection with railways constructed and
operated by our citizens in Peru have claimed
the attention of this Government. It is urged
that other Governments in pressing Peru to
the payment of their claims have disre
garded the property rights of American citi
zens. The matter will be carefully investi
gated with a view to securing a proper and
equitable adjustment.
A similar issue is now pending with
Portugal. The Delagoa Bay railway in Africa
was constructed under a concession by
Portugal to an - American citizen. When
nearly completed the road was seized by tbe
agents of the Portuguese Government. For
mal protest has been made through our
Minister at Lisbon against this act and no
proper effort will be spared to secure proper
relief.
. In pursuance of tbe charter granted by
Congress and under the terms of Its contract
with the Government of Nicaragua the In-ter-Oceanic
Canal Company has begun the
construct ion of tbe Important water way be
tween the two oceans.'
The traditional good feeling' between taU
country and the French Republic has re
ceived additional testimony in the participa
tion of our Government and people la tbe
International Exposition held at Paris dur
ing the past summer. The success of our
exhibitors has been gratifying. The report
of the Commission wiU be laid before Con
greas in due season.
With Germany tbe most cordial relation
exist- The questions arising from the return
o the Empire of Germans naturalized in this
country are considered and disposed of in a
temperate spirit to the entire satisfaction ot
both Governments.
mixe1 commission Is now In session In
this capital for settlement ot long-standing
C i?.. inst the Republic of Venezuela
and It is hoped that a satisfactory conclusion
wiU be speedily reached.
Questions continue to arise at our relations
Z ee7C countries In respect to the
rights of naturalized citizens. KspeeiaUy is
f-rt case with France, ItalyT Kuasis,
and Turkey and to a less extent with Switzer
land. From time-to time earnest efforts have
been made to regulate this subject by con
ventions. An improper use ot naturalization
should not be permitted, but it is important
that those who have been duly naturalized,
should everywhere be accorded recognition
of the rights pertaining to citizenship ot the
country of their adoption. The appropria
tions of special conventions for that purpose
is recognized in treaties which this Govern
ment has concluded with a number of Euro
pean States, and it is advisable that the diffi
culties which now arise in our relations with;
other countries on the same subject should
be similarly adjusted.
The recent revolution In B rax 11 In favor of,
the establishment ot a republican form ot
government is an event of great interest to
the United States. Our Minister at Rio
Janeiro was at once Instructed to maintain
friendly diplomatic relations with the Pro
visional Government and the Brazilian
representatives at the capital were Instruct,
ed by the Provisional Government to con
tinue their functions. Our friendly Inter
course with Brazil has therefore suffered no
interruption. Our Minister has been further
instructed to extend on the part of this
Government a formal and cordial recogni
tion ot the new republic so soon as ne
majority of the people of Brazil shall have
signified their assent to its establishment
and maintenance.
Home Matters.
Within our own borders a general condi
tion of prosperity prevails. The harvests of
the last summer were exceptionally abun
dant and the trade conditions now prevail
ing seem to promise a successful season to
the merchant and the manufacturer and gen
eral employment to our working people.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
fortheilscal year ended June 30, 13S9, has
been prepared and will be presented to Con
gress with the fiscal operations of the Gov
ernment, and I avail myself of it to obtain
some facts for use here. The aggregate re
ceipts from all sources fef the year were
$3S7,050,058.SJ. It was derived as follows : From
customs, $223,S32,74l.6S; from internal reve
nue, $1303213.92; from miscellaneous
sources, $32,335,S03.2a.
The ordinary expenditures for tbe same
period were Kl,Jys,615.60, and the total ex
penditures, iacluding the sinking fund, were
$329,579,929.25. The excess of receipts over
expenditures was, after providing for the
sinking fund, $37,470,129.59. For the current
fiscal year the total revenues, actual and
estimated, are $385,000,000, and the ordinary
expenditures, actual and estimated, are
$293,000,000, making, with the sinking fund, a
total expenditure of $341,321,116.99, leaving an
estimated surplus of $43,C78,8S3.01. .
During the fiscal year there was applied to
the purchase of bonds, in addition to these,
for the sinking fund $90,436,172.35, and during
the first quarter of the current year the sum
of $37,S38,937.77, all of which was credited to
the sinking fund.
The revenues for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1891, are estimated by the treasury
department at $385,000,000, and the expendi
tures for the same period, including the
sinking fund, at $341,430,477.70. This shows
an estimated surplus for that year of $43,
569,522.30; which is more likely to" be increased
than reduced when the aotual transactions
are written up.
THE SCKPLUS.
The existence of so large an actual and an
ticipated surplus should have tbe immedi
ate attention of Congress with a view to re
ducing the receipts of the treasury to the
needs of the Government as closely as may
be. ' The collection of moneys not needed for
public ues imposes an unnecessary burden
upon our people and the presencewf so large
a surplus in the public vaults is a disturbing
element in the conduct of private business.
It has called into use expedients for putting
it into circulation of very questionably pro
priety. We should not collect revenue for
the purpose of anticipating our bonds be- .
yond the requirement of the sinking fund,
but any unappropriated surplus in the treas
ury should be so used, as there is no other
lawful way of returning the money to cir
culation, and the profit realized by the Gov
ernment offers a substantial advantage.
The loaning of public funds to the banks
without interest, upon tlfcj security of Gov
ernment bonds, I regard as an unauthorized
and dangerous expedient. It results in
temporary and unnatural increase of the
banking capital of favored localities and
compels a cautious and gradual recall of the
deposits to avoid injury to the commercial
interests. It is not to be expected that the
banks having these deposits will sell their
bonds to the treasury so long as the present
highly beneficial arrangement is continued.
They now practically get interest both
upon the bonds and their proceeds.
Xo further use should be made of
this method "of getting the surplu
into circulation, and tbe deposits now out
standing should be gradually withdrawn
and applied to the purchase of bonds. It i
fortunate that such use can be made of
the existing surplus, and for some time to
come of any casual surplus that may exist
after Congress has taken tbe necessary steps
for a rede ct ion of the revenue. Such legis
lation should be promptly but very consid
erately enacted.
TBI TlBIrr.
I recommend a revision of our tariff law.
both in Its administrative features and in
the schedule. The need of the former in
generally conceded, and an agreement upon
the evils and inconveniences to be remedied
and tne best methods for their correction
will probably not be difficult. Uniformity
of valuation at all our ports is essential, and
effective measures should be taken to secure
it. It is equally desirable that questions
affecting rates and classifications should be
promptly decided.
The preparation of a new schedule of cus
tom duties is a matter of great delicacy, be
cause of its effect upon the business
ot the country; ot great difficulty, by
reason of the wide divergence of opinion
as to tbe objects that may be promoted by
such legislation. Some disturbance ot busi
ness may perhaps result from consideration
of this subject by Congress, but this tempo
rary ill -effect will be reduced to a minimum
by prompt action, and the assurance which
the country enjoys that any necessary-
changes will be so made as not to impair
the Just and reasonable protection ot our
home industries. The ineqalities of the laj
should be adjusted, but the protective prin
ciple should be maintained and fairly ap
plied to tne products of our farms as weU a
of our shops. These duties necessarily have
relation to other things besides public rev
enues. We can not limit their effects by fix
ing our eyes on the public treasury alone.
They have a direct relation to home produc
tion, to work, to wages and to the commer
cial independence of our country, antx tne
wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge
the field of his vision to include all of these.
The necessary reduction in our public rev
enues can. I am sure, be made without mak
ing the smaller burden more onerous than
the larger by reason of the disabities and
limitations which the process of reduction,
puts upon both capital and labor. The free
list can very safely be extenaed by placing
thereon articles that do no offer injurious
competition to such domestic products as
our home labor can supply. The removal of
the Internal tax upon tobacco would rellev
an Important agricultural product from s
burden which was Imposed only because out
revenue from custom duties was Insufficient
for the public needs. v
If safe provision can be devised, the re
moval of the tax upon spirits used In tbe
arts and manufactures would offer an un
objectionable method of reducing the sur
plus. THX CtBCClAXlOW.
A table presented by the Secretary of th
Treasury showing the amount of money o
all kinds In circulation each year from 1578 U
the present time Is of interest. It appear
that the amount of National bank notes is
circulation has decreased during that pertoc
$114,109,729, of which $37,799,223 is chargeable te
the last year. .,.
The withdrawal ot bank circulation wliJ
necessarily continue under existing "
tions. It is probable the adoption of tn
