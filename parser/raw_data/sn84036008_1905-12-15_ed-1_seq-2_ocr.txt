NEW LAND
DISTRICT
SENATOR CARTER INTRODUCES
A BILL PROVIDING FOR A
LAND OFFICE IN BILLINGS.
WEST OF BIG HORN
Metes and Boundaries Are Fully De
scribed-Friends of Mr. Carter Be
lieve That Present Bill Will Go
Through-Provides for the Appoint- t
ment of a Receiver and Register.
From Wednesday's Daily.
That Senator Thomas H. Carter has
not forgotten his friends in Yellow
stone county by any means, but is do- 1
ing all that lies in his power for the
benefit of the metropolis of eastern
Montana, is evidenced by Senate bill
.40 which was introduced by Mr. Car- I
ter on the 6th inst.
The bill provides for the establish
ment of a new land district in Mon
tana to be known as the Billings land
district, and that the land office for
the district shall be located in this
-city. It will be remembered that a
bill of similar import was introduced
at the last session of congress. It
was nearly the end of the session be
fore the bill was brought up and in
the rush of business incident to the
close it was voted down in order to
get it out of the way. It is confidently
believed by the friends of Mr. Carter
that he will oe successful in getting
the bill through both branches of con
gress this session, in which event the
proposed new district will be in ex
istence and the officials thereof be ap
pointed before the opening of ,the
Crow reservation which will be done,
it is now thought, early next fall.
Following is the complete text of
Senator Carter's bill:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress at
sembled:

ranges fifteen and sixteen of the Mon
tana principal meridian; running
thence south along said range line be
tween said ranges fifteen and sixteen
to the boundary line between Montana
and Wyoming; thence east along said
boundary line to its intersection with
the mid-channel of the Big Horn riv
er; thence along the mid-channel of
said Big Horn river in a northeaster
ly direction to its intersection with
the range line between ranges thirty
four and thirty-five east of Montana
principal meridian; thence north along
said range line to its intersection with
the said second standard parallel
north; thence west along said second
standard parallel north to the place
of beginning, be, and the same is

with the advice and consent of the
Senate, is hereby authorized to ap

er land offices of the State.
PAID ALL CHARGES.
Northern Pacific Company is Not De
linquent in Taxes Here.
From Wednesday's Daily.
A dispatch from Great Falls states
that in checking up his books the
county treasurer of Cascade county
has discovered that the Northern
Pacific company has failed to pay the
taxes on any of the many thousands
of acres of land it owns in that county
and the 10 per cent penalty has been
added. The company made no pro
test against the rate of assess
ment on its land and the county
treasurer of Cascade is at a loss
Sto understand the company's action
and is now making inquiries in other
counties to see if it took the same
action in any of them.
Inquiry concerning the matter at the
office of Mr. Burla of this county, last
evening, elicited the information that
the company had. paid each and every
itemn of taxes assessed against it in
Yellowstone county and was not de
linquent in any part of its taxes.

"Farmer John" Acknowledged that He
Had Ridden the Horse.
From Wednesday's Daily.
The case of the state against J. W.
Robinson, better known as "Farmer
John," was called in the court of Jus
tice Mann at 10 o'clock yesterday.
The defendant was charged with re
straining an estray horse and appro
priating him to his own use. When
asked to plead he demurred at consid
erable length. He finally acknowledg
ed that he had ridden the horse and
that he knew that it was the property
of some other person. This was taken
as a plea of guilty and the punishment
was fixed at a fine of $50. Later in the
day it was reduced to $25, whereupon
Robinson paid it and was discharged
from custody.
It is not believed by Robinson's
friends that there was any wilful in
tent on his part when he took the ani
mal up. A man who knows the horse
says that is has been running around
the valley 20 miles west of this city
for a long time and everybody used it.
"The old horse was considered as a
sort of a public servant, and almost
everybody used him a little for his
feed," said the man.
A QUIET WEDDING.
Henry S. Blakeway and Miss Helen
Stottenberg United.
From Wednesday's Daily.
At 8 o'clock last evening, at the res
idence of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Albin,
Henry S. Blakeway and Miss Helen
Stottenberg were united in marriage.
The ceremony was performed by the
Reverend B. Z. McCollough, pastor of
the Presbyterian church.
A very few friends of the young
couple twitnessed the ceremony, and
immediately after its conclusion a
sumptuous wedding supper was served
under the direction of Mrs. Albin. The
couple departed last night on a bridal
tour. They will go to New York and
perhaps to Germany where they will
visit the bride's parents. The groom
is the baggagemaster at the Northern
Pacific-Burlington passenger depot and
is a young man who is highly respec
ted by all of his acquaintances. The
bride has resided here for about five
years and is an excellent young lady.
DETRIMENTAL
TO BUSINESS
COMMERCIAL CLUB TAKES UP
QUESTION OF RATES.
In addition to passing resolutions
hearing on the question of reducing of
the tariff on sugar, the Commercial
club, at its meeting Monday night,
passed the following resolutions rela
tive to a re-adjustment of freight rates
in Montana:
Whereas, President Roosevelt has in
his annual message to congress point
ed out the injustice of the present sys
tem of defining railway freight rates
wherein small shippers, consumers and
even communities are aiscriminated
against by an unfair and inequitable
basis of fixing rates, and where large
shippers are often given rebates to the
disadvantage of their competitors, and
Whereas, in the state of Montana,
these evils are especially flagrant to
the detriment of the trade of the state
and especially to its development,
therefore be it
Resolved, that our representatives
in congress be urged to support any
measure that may be brought before
congress for the relief of the public
from these unjust discriminations, and
be it further
Resolved, that this association is in
full sympathy with the spirit of the
Helena convention called for the pur
pose of taking some action looking
towards the relief of local conditions
and that its delegates be instructed to
support any measure looking towards
a readjustment of Montana rates that
will be fair and equitable to shipper
and carrier alike.
WOMAN WAS DISCHARGED.
Young Counryman is Still in the Toils
at Missoula.
From Wednesday's Daily.
A dispatch from Missoula states that
the preliminary examination of Irene
Ellsworth and Horace Countryman, the
latter of this county, was held in that
city a few days ago.
The charge was grand larceny and
the evidence against the woman was
not sufficient to hold her and the case
against her was dismissed. Country.
man's attorney made a motion to dis.
miss the case against him, alleging
that the complaint was faulty. The
court sustained the motion, but
another complaint was immediately
draws up and Countryman was re
arrested.

FOR CUSTER BATTLEFIELD.
Professor Condon Thinks Better
Markers Should be Furnished.
From Wednesday's Daily.
Professor Condon, superintendent of
the public schools of Helena is making
an effort to secure from congress an
apropriation for the better marking
of the Custer battlefield. He has
written letters to Senator Thomas H.
Carter and Representative Joseph M.
Dixon, urging the necessity for such
an appropriation.
"On my visit to the field," Superin
tendent Condon said, "it was found
that the points of interest about
the spot where inadequately marked.
The grave of Tom Custer is marked
by a cheap headstone that is now badly
chipped, a portion of the name being
missing. Other graves are marked by
cheap crosses, some of which are
decaying or have fallen away.
"The entire field should be fenced in,
and the more important points should
be marked for all time with granite
monuments or bronze tablets. It seems
to me that the country owes this to
the men who lost their lives at the
battle of the Little Big Horn, and it
was this thought that led me to bring
he matter to the attention of Montana
representatives in the national law
making body."
WRITES THEIR SONGS
In Order That the Native Music of
the North American Indian May
Not Become Entirely Lost Musical
Men Are Sent Out to Get It Down
In Black and White.
From Wednesday's Daily.
Harold A. Loring, of the Indian de
partment, whose headquarters are in
Washington, D. C., was here a few
days ago en route west from a visit
to the Crow and Cheyenne reserva
tions.
Mr. Loring's title is "supervisor of
native Indian music," and his duties
are of a somewhat peculiar nature,
requiring an expert musician with a
good ear for tones to accomplish the
work laid out for him. His mission
is to record for preservation the na
tive music and songs of the Indians.
Commissioner Leupp beheves in pre
serving rather than crushing out what
is generally characteristic in the In
dian. In his recent report he said:
"The children should be instructed in
the music of their own race, side by
side with ours," and with that in
view he has appointed Mr. Loring to
the position he now occupies.
Mr. Loring made a trip west last
spring and visited the Crow reserva
tion. Here he secured several of the
old songs of the tribe one of which
he arranged for a band when he re
turned to Washington. He sent the
music to the director of the Indian
band at Crow agency, and last fall,
when the Indiana held their fair at
the agency, the piece was played
much to the delight of the old men
and women of the tribe.
During his recent visit to the Chey
enne agency on Tongue river Mr.
Loring secured two good songs, one
of them a famous hunting song. He
also took down four or five more of
the Crow songs.
The manner of securing the songs
on paper is somewhat novel. Mr.
Loring usually uses a piano. The in
structors at the various agencies co
operate with him in the work. They
assemble together a number of the
best singers of the tribe and per
suade them to sing. Mr. Loring fol
lows the tones by means of the pia
no, and rapidly writes down the po
sitions of the notes as the singers
proceed. If a song is not too difficult
he transcribes it in one rendition.
Sometimes, in cases where the music
is difficult and peculiar, as nearly all
of it is, it requires two or three ren
ditions before he gets it arranged to
suit him.
Mr. Loring spent but a short time
in this city. He was en route to the
Flathead reservation in the northwest
ern part of the state and from there
will visit the tribes in Idaho and other
far western states. While at Crow
Agency he was materially assisted in
his work by Professor Creel, superin
tendent of the Indian schools.
The idea of the government in in
augurating this feature at the present
time is that the old men and women
of the tribes are rapidly dying off. In
fact it is only a matter of a few de
cades when the North American In
dian will be a thing of the past, and
now, before it is too late, the govein
ment desires to make arrangements
for the permanent preservation of the
Indian's native music.

WERE THE MAIN SUBJECTS OF
DISCUSSION AT THE FARMERS
INSTITUTE.
SUGGESTIONS MANY
One Prominent Citizen Thinks a Bond
Issue of $100,000 Should be Made
and Proceeds Expended on the High
ways-Jack Graham Tells About
Colorado Beet Fields-Professor
Linfield on Dairying.
From Wednesday's Daily.
"These professors from the Agricul- a
tural college and the other lecturers
at the Institute are doing a most use
ful and commendatory work through- a
out the state," said a well known farm- t
er last evening, "and we old hay seeds
can learn a great deal by attending d
there institutes." This opinion of the a
value of the Institute system seemed to s
;be shared in by all of the farmers and e
others who have been attending the
sessions of the farmer's meeting now 0
being held in this city.
Tuesday Morning Sessior.
Yesterday morning's session started d
out with a short address by P. B. Moss c
on the subject of good roads and the
use of the split log drag. Mr. Moss
started in by saying that Nothing will
make farm life more enjoyable and q
pleasant than will good roads. He
said that about the only tool that was
necessary to secure good roads was ao
drag, and he explained the process t
of making the split-log drag, which ,
proved to be very simple. He said
that experience of eastern road makers I
demonstrated the fact that the split
log drag was the most effective. He
advocated a plan of raising a sub- 1
stantial premium among the business t
men of the city to be given to the
farmer or farmer's son who would keep t
up the best piece of road in front of
his ranch. A general discussion of the
good roads question followed Mr. Moss'
address. Professor Wylie spoke of the
roads in the National park, and des
cribed a road drag that is being ef
fectively used there.
J. T. Graham discussed road making
in Colorado. Professor Wylie urged
the use of wide tired wagons. C. H.
Perrine said that all the talk of good
roads was proper and good but the
farmers or the county commissioners
should be doing something. He was of
the opinion that if the farmer was ex
pected to do the work, the county
should at least furnish the machinery.
The main thing, he said, was to do
something. T. C. Armitage expressed
himself as being in favor of doing
most anything to secure good roads.
J. T. Graham said that the country
roads should at first be well graded
and this should be done by the county
commissioners. Professor Linfield
said that the main thing in road work
was to do it at the proper time. The
leveling should be done while the
ground is damp. W. F. Snyder favored
some plan by which plenty of money
can be raised. "If we get good roads,
we must expect to pay for them," he
said. Joseph Zimmerman was in
favor of the county issuing bonds, the
proceeds of which to be expended on
the roads. "We have issued $100,000
in bonds for a new court house," he
said, "Why not issue $100,000 more for
road improvement," Doctor Sudduth
spoke of the gravel roads of Illinois,
where immense sums of money had
been spent and the most of it thrown
away. Mr. Conley, Thomas McGirl
and others took part in the discussion.
Pork and Dairying.
Professor Linfield spoke on the sub
ject of pork and dairying, devoting the
greater part of his time to the dairy
ing branch of the subject. He said
that a dairy cow needs greater care
than either sheep or steers. "She is
a more delicate animal, and in order
to get good results she must have
good care. A most important thing in
dairying is to first secure a good cow."
The speaker estimated the cost of feed
and the returns from a dairy cow in
one year as follows: One thousand
pounds of grain, $10. Three tons of
hay, $15. Pasture, $5. Total, $30. For
which outlay he estimated that the
animal would return 250 pounds of
butter or 5,000 to 6,090 pounds of
cream worth $50. One calf worth $10.
Total returns $60, or a balance of $30
in favor of the cow. He said that the
cow that eats the most under average
conditions will give the best returns.
Different cows required different sys
tems of feeding, he said, and every
dairy cow must be handled with gentle
ness. Every farmer who has from
five to ten cows, said the professor,
should have a milk tester so that he
may know just what each cow is doing.
Afternoon Session.
Chairman I. D. O'Donnell of the
Farmers' Institute opened the session
with a few snappy remarks which gave
the tone to the entire meeting. It was
snappy throughout. There were few
set papers, but many interesting talks
and the questions came thick and fast.
The sugar beet industry was the
chief topic of discussion and was hap
pily introduced by Jack Graham, a
prominent Yellowstone county farmer
who has recently made a visit to the
Colorado sugar beet fields. It was pre
ceded by talks on dairy cows by Direc
tor Linfield and a talk on soil culture
by Professor Wylie.
Director Linfield talked along the
lines of tests for milch cows and urged
that tests be frequently made. He
called attention to the fact that the
first milk taken from the cow did not
contain the same percentage of butter
fat that was to be found in the last
milk taken. He said there was no
direct physiological explanation for
this but the fact remained, so that a
true test should be made from the en
tire milking. His remarks were em
phasized by Professor Wylie and his
argument was brought out more clear
ly by the numerous questions that
were fired at him.
Professor Wylie opened his talk on
soil culture by taking a little pardon
able pride in the character of Mon
tana's agricultural resources and said
that the state could make a better in
dividual showing at a state fair than
any other state in the union. This he
said was due to its marvellous differ
ences in climate and soil resources.
He is not an enthusiastic supporter
of the theory of summer fallowing for
the purpose of refreshing land. He
said that experiments had shown that
lands; sumemr fallowed, had gradually
deteriorated. Speaking of the qualities
of the soil, he dwelt with especial
stress on the ingredients of potash,
phosphate and nitrogen. The first two,
he said, were here in such abundant
quantities that many generations would
elapse before they could be exhausted.
With nitrogen, it is different. Instead
of summer fallowing for the conserva
tion of nitrogen, he urged the planting
of fields of clover and alfalfa. He ex
plained how germs which returned the
nitrogen to the soil, collected at the
roots of clover and alfalfa, and in thiE
way the soil was refreshed. Sugar
beets, he said, were a great drain on
the soil, but it could be refreshed by
planting in clover or alfalfa every
three years.
On Sugar Beets.
Jack Graham in his talk on sugar
beets, proved the hit of the session.
Mr. Graham has a general style of
making himself understood and his
talk was received with close interest,
interrupted by gusts of laughter, when
some of his quaint remarks struck the
humorous fancy of the audience. After
expressing his faith in the sugar beet,
and telling of the large profits that ac
crued to the grower in Colorado,
amounting in some instances to $75 an
acre, Mr. Graham said the resources of
the Yellowstone valley were superior
to those of the Colorado fields. "The
land is better," he said, "we raise bet
ter alfalfa and more to the acre; the
fruit is equal, the water supply is
superior and the most economical on
record, building material and labor no
higher, sheep and cattle for feeding
purposes easy to obtain, etc., making
a splendid showing for the Yellowstone
valley." Mr. Graham dwelt upon the
necessity of having larger horses in
the Yellowstone valley to transport the
beets. "We must have larger horses"
he said. "I saw horses in Colorado,
weighing 1400 pounds. We have few
horses in this country and we must
have them to transport the heavy
loads." The growing of sugar beets,
he said, would double the population
of Billings in two years and furnish an
additional market for other products.
In answer to a question, Edmond
Simmons of the sugar beet factory ex
plained that it took more water to
raise sugar beets than to raise alfalfa.
By this he meant that it would take
more frequent waterings, four being
important, although, he said, a crop
could be raised with three waterings.
W. B. George explained that he had
been raising sugar beets for the pur
pose of feding and recited the advan
tages to be gained in this way.
Several pointers on the raising of
sugar beets were given by W. L. Haw
ley, one of the field men of the sugar
beet company.
While last on the program, the even
ing session of the institute was by no
means the least part of it.
It opened with a brief lecture by
Director Linfield on the subject of
poultry. He took his hearers down
the line of poultry raising and poultry
breeding, looking at the subject from
its various angles so far as the brief
time at his disp"aal woull allw.
Mr. Linfield dwelt on the importanco
of the poultry industry in the United
States, quoting sdatistics to prove his
assertions. He advised his hetl 'rs
not to keep chickens for laying pur
poses after they were two years old,
for by that time they had outlived
their usefulness in this respect. He
advised them to feed young chickens,
not too much, but just enough, recom
mending a mixture of grains which
would make a nice mash.
Chickens, he said, must have green
things, sugar beets and mangoes being
good for the purpose. Clover leaves
fed to the chickens during the winter,
will, he said, give the yolks .a good
color. They should also have meats
and plenty of grit to furnish material
for making egg shell and also for
grinding the food in the gizzard.
Professor W. W. Wylie gave his lec
ture on farm life. He uregd greater
attention to the amenities of social life
and laid especial stress on the impor
tance of better country schools. The
poor quality of country schools to be
found in Montana, he said, was the
greatest menace that exists to the suc
cess of agriculture in this state.
The lecture was a beautiful appre
ciation of the charm of farm life as
well as a sane direction as to what to
do to make it more interesting.
Director Linfield closed the program
with an illustrated talk on the different
types of cattle. With the aid of the
stereopticon, he pointed out the
characteristic points of all the differ
ent breeds, casting pictures of, magnifi
cent examples df the different cow
families.
At the conclusion of his talk, Mr.
Linfield took occasion to remark the
success of the Billings Institute and
paid grateful tribute to the part taken
in its success by I. D. O'Donnell, who
has labored strenuously to awaken in
terest in the affair. W. B. George pro
posed a standing vote of appreciation
for the work of Mr. O'Donnell and
every one stood up.
WANT TRIAL
ELSEWHERE
ATTORNEYY FOR JAMES GRADY
ASK FOR CHANGE.
From Wednesday's Daily.
Hathhorn & Groves, attorneys for
James S. Grady, filed a motion in the
district court yesterday, asking that
their client's case be sent to some
other place for trial.
The motion recites at length the
facts of the robbery of the Owl saloon
and the killing of Police Sergeant Han
nah, and charges that both of the
crimes were committed by Ed Grady
and Oliver O. Mosier, who escaped
from the county jail September 23,
1904. It states that the officer who was
killed was a very popular man and that
the public mind was greatly inflamed
over the crime. It then goes on to re
late that the people of this county, on
account of newspaper accounts and the
testimony of witnesses, has come to
the conclusion that their client was
mixed up in the affair and that he was
arrested on the charge of grand lar
ceny. This case was taken to Sweet
Grass county for trial, and after the
jury had convicted the defendant and
fixed his punishment at one year in
the penitentiary, that the presiding
judge, Frank Henry, had expressed
himself from the bench as being sorry
that the jury had fixed the punishment
so low adn that he wished that the
matter of fixing the punishment had
been left to the court.
The motion further states that the
state relies on the same evidence in
the case now pending against Grady,
with which to secure a conviction, as it
did in securing the conviction in the
grand larceny case. Therefore Judge
Henry of the Sixth judicial district is
disqualified to sit in this case, the mo
tion states, and believing that defend
ant cannot secure a fair trial here the
court is asked to send the case to some
other place for trial, where such con
ditions do not exist.
.The information charging James S.
Grady with murder of the first degree
was filed in the district court Decem
ber 6, 1904.
