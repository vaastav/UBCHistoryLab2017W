BRYAN AND WILSON
ADMINISTRATION
LOCK HORNS TODAY
WASHINGTON, DEC. 10—WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN AND
THE WILSON ADMINISTRATION TODAY LOCKED HORNS IN WHAT
MAY BE A FINISH FIGHT OVER THE PREPAREDNESS ISSUE.
BRYAN IN A SIGNED STATEMENT DECLARED THAT "THE PRES
IDENT HAS BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE WISHES OF THE PEO
PLE."
SECRETARY GARRISON, IN A REPORT TO CONGRESS SAYS
THE ATTITUDE OF SUCH MEN AS BRYAN IS NOT "BASED ON FACT
OR REASON."
Bryan's Shot At Wilson
BY WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN
Written for The Tacoma Times. Copyrighted, 1915.
Peace voyages like that upon which Mr. Ford and his companions have
embarked are an indication of a growing desire that something shall be done.
The question Ift! not whether Mr. Ford's plan will meet with immediate success
—time only can answer that question. The real question is whether it deserves
success, and to this question every one who desires peace must answer "Yes."
It can do no harm—it has already done good. It has started people to talk
ing about peace here and in Europe—that is so much gained—and it has ex
posed to contempt the sordid interests that ridicule all talk of peace.
Then, too, there is an inspira
tion in the esrnestness and un
selfishness of a man of large
■wealth who is controlled by his
heart Instead of his pocketbook.
Health and safety to those w'.io
sail; they are in search of some
thing more precious than the
golden fleece. Success attend
them!
One phase of the subject
has not been sufficiently con
sidered, namely, the RIGHT
of the neutral nations to
bring moral pressure to bear
upon the belligerents to state
the terms upon which peace
ran be restored. The Hague
convention expressly declares
that an offer of mediation
shall not be regarded as an
unfriendly art. On the con
trary, It is specifically cn
oonraged on the ground that
humanity, as a whole, is in
terested in stopping a war.
But the right of the neutral
nations to urge peace rests on the
ground of material interests as
■well as on the ground of human
ity. They are bearing burdens
of taxation which would not be
necessary but for the war; do
mestic questions are being subor
dinated to Issues raised by the
war; every neutral nation is in
danger of being dragged Into the
war and some are almost forced
Into it.
In each nation the financial
vultures who live on the woes of
their country are using the war
•san argument in favor of in
creased expenditures on prepar
edness. Whyshould the nations
at war obstruct the highways of
the world, Interfere with neutral
trade and endanger the lives of
those who travel? All the neutral
nations suffer, and those who
•uffer have a right to complain.
The president proposed
mediation immediately
after the war began, but
that was 16 months ago.
I regret that he does
not see his way clear to
make the offer again.
The smaller nations
wait on this nation and I
fear the president has
been deceived as to the
wishes of the people.
There are big corporations In
pis country that are financially
interested in the continuance of
the war—corporations that sell
ammunitions at an enormous pro
fit and corporations that float
war loans at a high rate, and
tUese corporations speak through
metropolitan newspapers.
The masses have no voice ex
cept as they speak through offi
cials elected by them or through
petitions. They should communi
cate immediately and frequently
with their representatives.
In politics the fesr of the peo
ple Is the beginning of wisdom;
the people can ' easily control
congress if they will only speak
to congress In sufficient numbers.

Garrison's Whinger
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 10.
—Instead of the stereotyped re
port such as the war department
customarily sends to congress,
Secretary Garrison today startled
official Washington with a mes
sage which In vivid language
holds up to ridicule the advocates
of non-preparedness.
"There are those who do
not feel free to base their
conduct upon a consideration
of facts or conclusions of rea
son, because of their inter
pretation of Divine injunc
tion," says Garrison in his
statement of the Wilson Mili
tary policy.
"They do not believe in re
sistance to physical! force;
and those whose consciences
are so convinced surrender
life and all that they i In.-it.li
and love at tho behest of the
aggressor.
"This attitude concerns
the individual and him alone.
Hlnre it does not assume to
be based upon fact or reason.
It cannot lie dealt with on
that basis. It cannot be made
the general rule of conduct.
"There are others concerning
whose charity of vision we are
not advised, and concerning
whose soundness of reason we
are not informed, because the at
titude which they take is admit
tedly not based upon either vision
or reason. They are those who
predict that war will never come
to this country, and assert that

therefore precautions with respect
thereto are unwise and needless.
"There are others among us
who are too intelligent and clear
sighted not to see the facts and
to realize their significance, but
who counsel inaction because they
mistrust themselves and the na
tion."
Garrison goes on to assert that
a reasonable preparedness is real
ly a preventive of militarism, and
that It Is in keeping, and not
counter to, the nstional tradi
tions.
Following a detailed argument
to back up these statements, he
outlines the army plan recom
mended by President Wilson in
his annual message.
If the Continental army plan
does not succeed, he adds, some
form of compulsory service will
be made necessary.

CHRISTMAS
JUDGES BRUSH
ASIDE EVERY
TECHNICALITY
OLYMPIA, Dec. 10.—Washington goes dry Jan. 1.
In a 53 page decision handed down at 11 o'clock today, six judges of the
supreme court affirmed the decision of the Thurston county superior court
upholding the state-wide prohibition law.
The two remaining judges wrote tfMft separate opinions concurring with
their colleagues. ,
The main opinion, wiping off the slate a mass of technicalities raised by
the attorneys for M. & K. Oottstein to prevent the law from going into effect,
I was written by Justice Parker and signed by Justices Morris, Ellis, Holcomb,
Main and Mount.
Justices Chadwick and Fullerton wrote short opinions, agreeing with the
general conclusions, but disagreeing with some of the reasonings.
Of the nine judges oi the supreme bench Justice Bausman, recently ap
pointed, was the only one whose name did not appear in the decision. He was
appointed after the case had been argued before the court.
i Leaders in the prohibition movement are jubilant over this, their final vic
tory, in the long fight for a dry state and are predicting a new era in the in
dustrial and economic growth of the state.
Six Judges declared they could
not take Judicial notice of defec
tive publication of notice of elec
tion on the prohibition measure,
which was one of the chief tech
nicalities raised by the attorneys
for the lli|in'i men.
"We —lust presume that all
neceesary steps had been taken
when the law wns adopted by the
' people," the decision said.
The constitutionality of the law
; which was attacked by the Hotel
men's association as intervenors
i was fully upheld under the V ebb-
I.Kenyon act, the federal law
which prohibits the Interstate
transportation of liquor Into a
dry stste.
Constitutional? Sure!
Disposing of the argument that
the measure was unconstitutional
because it was not made to go
into effect until Jan. 1, 1916,
whereas the state constitution
says a law Is to go into effect 30
days after its passage, the court
said:
"The law is constitutional on
the face of it. It became effec
tive at tlie time state in the con
stitution, even though It did not
become operative until Jan. 1,
1916."
The mass of technical objec
tions raised by Attorney James
B. Howe of Seattle, representing
the liquor men, were ruled out
in their entirety. The court de
termined to stand by the will of
the people expressed in their vote
insofar as it did not conflict with
the state and federal constitu
tion.
Howe's Objections Trivial.
"Objections of this kind are
not entitled to be raised In this
form of action," said the decision.
All other objections and ques
tions of interstate commerce were
disposud of with the board state
men that the new law does not
interfere insofar as the transpor
tation of liquor for business pur
poses Is concerned.
Justice Chadwlck, in his four
page opinion, said he did not be
lieve the court should refuse to
take Judicial notice or defective
publications, but expressed satis
faction with the general verdict.
Justice Fullerton signed his
name to a half page concurring
decision. .
What Law Provides.
The voters of Washington
adopted the prohibition law, by a
majority of 18,632, the law to
take affect Jan. 1. 1916.
It prohibits sale, manufacture,
giving away or ot herwlse furnish
ing or disposing of all intoxicating
liquor; or having In possession
any Intoxicating liquor, or any
drug or medicine, containing al
cohol, capable of being used as a
beverage.
The law allows the Importation
of liquor for individual use, in
quantity not exceeding two quarts
of liquor other than beer, or 12
quarts or 24 pints of beer, as
often as once every 20 days, un
der a very strict regulation, which
reulres the Importer to secure a
permit from the county auditor,
the permit good for only one
shipment, and for only 30 days,
and shipments of liquor cannot
be accepted at the state line by
transportation companies except
with this permit attached, can
called, and not In larger quantity
than allowed by law.
