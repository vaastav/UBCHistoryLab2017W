The fifth annual Message of President
Grant, submitted ye.sterday to the two houses
of Congress, is before our reader*. In its
report of the workings of the government
during the year from December last, and in
the views and recommendations ol the Ex
ecutive upon our foreign and domestic affairs,
it is & most important State paper. 1 hat it
will command, to an extraordinary degree,
the public attention, we cannot doubt, oou
| sidering the universal anxiety manifested
touching our critical relations with Spain. our
existing financed embarrassments and Hit
general expectation of speedy meagre* of
relief through tbe reooiumendationa of the
President and the canon rrent action of
Congress.
Recent important events ?re grouped to
: gether in tlie opening of the Message. TLe
! impress, if not to startle, the reason. The
President Says that in the midst of groat
national prosperity a financial crisis ha- oc
curred that has brought h>w fortunes of
gigantic proportions; that political partisan
ship lias almost ceased to exist, especially in
the agricultural regions, and that finally, the
capture upon the high seas of a vessel bearing
our flag has for some time threatened tbe
most serious consequences but that this mat
ter is happily now in the course ot a satisfac
tory adjustment, honorable to both nations
concerned. We ara next assured tnat,
excepting these complications with Spain,
nothing in our relations gfnendly with foreign
Powers has occurred dnr.ug the year calling
for special notice. Touching, then, open the
Vienna Exposition, the reception by the young
Chinese, limperor in person of the representa
tive:* of the Western Pow-rs, the infamous
Chiuese coolie trade, the disposition o! the
money awarded to the United States bj' the
Geneva Tribunal of Arbitration, our north
western boundary, tbe awards made to ]>rit??h
subjects in pursuance of the 'treaty oi W ash
ington by the Mixed Commission appointed to
adjudicate such claims, and passing over our
relations with Mexico, Venezuela, 'lurkey and
Egypt, we are arrested by the brief announce
ment in the Mtsaage that the Republic
of St. Domingo ha.- applied to our gov
ernment to exercise '.he powers of a pro
tectorate over that Republic, and that this
application is transmitted for tbe considers- ,
ti>>u and determination of Congress.
We apprehend that an extensive combina
tion of speculators and adventurers is at the
bottom of this movement ; that millions of
money will be extracted ironi the United States
Treasury by these parties should this protec
torate be established over Dominica, and that
the neri inevitable step will be the annexation
of the Republic, with all the coaia and annoy
ances of a troublesome *hiU elephant. Gen- >
er>U Grant, in having no recommendation to
make on this glittering but delusive proposi
tion trorn Dominica, washes his Lands of all '
responsibility in the premises ; and the two |
bouses of Congress will be wise in profiting j
from his experience touahing this ?'beauiltul j
isle of the sea." i
In roference to certain embarrassments of
United States citizenship in foreign countries
tbo facts submitted in ths MeasagS are entitled
to the ecxly attention ol Congress. To our j
controversy with Spain, arising from the Vir- I
ginius outrages, asset foith by the President, t
we devote a separate article, and another to
tbe remedies propo-ed l y th? administration
lor our existing financial troubles.
In anticipation of an amendment to the
constitution from the present Congress for
ratification by the States, reforming our present
method of electing the Presideutand Vice I.V *?
ident of the United States, two other amend
ments are suggested in the Message, "to j
protect .he public against the many abuses !
and waste of public moneys which creep into |
appropriation bills and other important mens- |
ures posing during the expiring hours of i
Congress," abuses which, under the constitu- |
tion as it is, cannot be prevented. These sugges
tions are doubtless intended to apply, among
other things, to the Congressional buck-pay
amendment added to an important appropria
tion bill in the expiring hour of the last Con
gress; but if the President had vetoed that
appropriation bill on account of that amend
ment, and at the ha;:ard of an extra sossion
of the new Congress, he would have been sus
tained iu his action by tbe country. Never
theless, the constitutional amendments sug
gested on this ground, if adopted, would
serve for the future as an inv;Joable protne- j
taon to tht public treasury.
Having adopted the policy of "preparing
for war in time <if peace," the President ro
ommenda enlarged appropriations lor the
army and navy, as suggested in the atmu&l
report from each of the*e departments. Hn
commends the activity oi the Secretary of the
Navy in quietly putting some of our most
effective monitors in condition lor servica,
whereby "the exigency liuds na in a much
butter condition tor work (that is, for the
contingency of war) than w? possibly J
could have been without his action." For the
postul service the expenditures huve exceeded
tho revenues of the department oyer five arid
a quarter millions of dollars, which, und'.r ail i
the circumstances, is not a discouraging ex- |
hibit. Tho President endorses th<> numerous 1
reforms proposed by tLe Postru.'iHter Cruc ral,
including prepayment of poatago on news
papers, postal saving* depositories and postal
telegraphs. Xha satisfactory results from Uie
governmental eontfol of the telegraph* in
England and other countries of Europe should
bti a sufficient argum nt for the adoption ot
the postal telegraph syst?m in the United
States, so confidently urged upon Congress
as a measure for the public good by the Post
master General.
Tho difficulties of th<- t'liitM States Cocrts
in their conflict wiih vhfl Territorial Courts cf
Utah call lor the Intervention of Congies*, and
the necessary legislation for the removal of .
these diffic ulties is tinned upon tho two houses. |
The result Will probably be a reconstruction j
of the or^ntc law of the Territory which will i
bring to an early settlement the irrepressible |
conflict between tho naiuts und Gen- '
tiles. Next fie Iiankrv.pt law jh pre. '
sonted as productive ol more evil than !
good and a subject for repeal or materia!
change*, and next, the neoesNity of providing i
new tribunals and other safeguards for the
protection of the government against fraudu
lent claims is uobmitted. Upon the Indian
i uuoitiou. wlalo adUoruitf to his *c?oullcd ueace <
policy, General Omnt adopted the idea *nb
mitted by tlie Heoaij> last summer, of the
ultimate h? tilemeut of all our surviving rod
mfin in the Indian Territory and their pro
t> c.tion in that land of promise under & Terri
torial government
A fluttering exhibit of the sales of and set
tlements and reserves on the public lands is
given, and of the operations of the Pension
Bureau :md Bur ran of Education. An extra
census lor 1875 its recommended, and liberal
appropriations tor improvements in the city
ot Washington, of which city, he .says, "from
being a most unsightly place three years ago,
disagreeable to pass through in summer, in
consequence of the dust arising from the un
paved streets, and almost impassable in tho
winter from the mud, it is now one ?t the
most sightly c it ire iu the country, aud i
can boast of being the best paved."
Call you this a Hniall compliment
to the Governor? On civil service
reform, fclig President still needs some assist- 1
anco from lawyers, which, it is to be hoped, will
be given. In connection with the Admission
of Colorado, he recommends a canal, for pur
poses of irrigation, from (he eastern slope, of
the Kocky Mountains to the Missouri River,
and a grant of public lands to aid in its con
struction. This subject ol irrigation is one of
vital importance to all the States and Territo
ries from the great Plains to California; but
whether the government should go into this
business or leave it to the Sfutis and Territo
ries directly concerned, is the question find
entitled to consideration.
The Message closes with a recommendation
of .1 general amnesty, aud a law to secure his
civil rights to the enfranchised slave. Thus,
the way being indicated, it is probable that
Mr. Sumner's Civil llight* bill and the
nld House bill for n general amnesty,
or the Southern white man and black
man, arm in arm, will puss through
the two hou?es. The Message was
evidently written simply for the purpose
of progenting, as briefly as deemed pos
sible, the sets of the administration during
the past year and the legislative measures
whuh the Executive thinks necessary or
expedient upon our foreign and domestic
aft'; lira for the general welfare; and having
thus discharged his duty, with his mind re
lieved, he leaves the work suggested to the
consideration and the discretion of Congros*.
Our V>n?n wa ? KcroinmoiKtatliina of
Hip PinldtiDt and the Scerettiry'n
Report*
Whan Senator Bjutwell cvas Secretary of
the Treasury ho was so tenacious of his own
pervert^ policy and so thoroughly its advoca.'e
thai tha President's Message was generally a
document of secondary importance. This rule
seems to ha reversed under Mr. Richardson's
administration of the department, for we find
his report second in value and interest to
General Grant's rooomnumdationa. The
President's diEcrrwslon of the financial .sit na
tion i s u curious mixture of sound principles
and unsound deductions. He believes with
the Hisr..u.i> that a specie basis alone can
give us a sunnd currency. He al-?o be
lieves with this journal that we cannot
reach a specie basis until our exports
eqtul onr imports; but if ho offers any
suggestion .is to tha method of increasing onr
exports it is by miking tho currency elastic.
Put in juxtaposition there !s in this a mere
confusion of idem* ? a letting 'he substance
fall to grasp after tha shadow. Had Mr.
ltichnrJaon, instead of telling over frgaiu the
causes of the panio~ the payment of interest
on deposits by the banks and the great accu
mulation of money in Wall street during the
dull months tuk^n up this subject and dis
cussed it. wi-ely and well, the country might
airive mere nearly at the President's mean
ing. Evidently the increase of exports is not
to be attained by currency regulations. So
long as we continue to buy what w <? do not
need or what we ought to produce, so long
will our imports exoeod onr exports. Lust
year the balance of trade against us was
$119,550,047. Among the items which con
stitute this heavy gnm the President mentions
one tho carrying trade- remarking that we
puy about 180, 000,000 per annum to for
eign vc*w> Is for the transportation of
our surplus products to a market, thus
increasing tho balance of trade against
us to this amount. To thij wo might add
another item; we pay Spain and Cuba about
$120,000,000 gold annually for the single arti
cle of sugar. An elastic currency will not in
itself btjid up our mercantile raariue or ke<p
Cuban sugars ont of the American market.
The two question* of th'e currency and the
'ttdauce of trade must lie separately treated,
and though an many res poets they are in
timately related to <;u< h other, we taust not
think thu-t even a spocie basis, desirable as it
is, will tvjr'j ,dl the .lis from -a ui<-li wo are
suffering
After remarking tha recurring panics and
Htr.ngency every autumn aa tho result of the
tempting offers of interest on "call" loans,
which brings nearly all the currency of the
country to the mourn* centres in dull times,
there to b<? nsed tor pnrtKmcs ot j>< < ulation,
the President adds: ''Elasticity in on*
monetary system, th re f ore, is the object to
be attained first, aud so that there ?
may be, as far as possible, a pretention of tho
use of othtff people's money and i-tock and
other speciosol speculation. '!<? prevent the
latter it setni?s to me that one great step would
be taken by prohibiting the national banks
from paying intercut jn deposits, by requiring
them, to have their reserves in their own I
vaults, and by forcing tbern into r>'<ntuption, !
tbonjh it would l>fl oulv in Jr ^il tender [
uotea." For this purpose he suggests the I
establishment of clearing houses and thinks |
ic would be advisable to an thorite th< 9toro J
tary ??t the Tfiatfury to issue, ut any time, to
national banks oi ojmu , any amount of their
notes below a Axed percentage of their issue,
sty about forty per cent* upon tho banks depos
iting with the Treasurer of the United States
an amount of gorerniaeiit bonds equal to
the amount of notct <1 cnauded, tho
l?uks to fcrifit to the goti rmnont
say four ]?ir oent. of the interest accruing on
thi bonds so pledged during the tim* they
mania with thu 'lYeaturer as seenrity for the
in r.aaed circulation, the lioivto so pledged to
bo radecmable by the I aok?i ut their pleasura,
either iu whole <?r in p;?rt, by returning their
o*n bills for cancellation to an anion ut equal
to lh? fa?o of the bonds withdrawn. And
this is about alt he does recommend. Wo
i lUif'hJi Ww< ii n Um urunatitiDM Ihfrt ,
moat of flie pliuis yet suggested look only to
ialliti' n on the one haud or to compelling tho
government to pay interest ou iU own cur
renoy when not in use, and add that his
plun, if anything, is nothing more than the
support of the monopoly known an the
national banking system.
All tho public documents submitted to Con
gress yesterday the report of the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Secretary of the Treas
ury's report and the President's Messago- -
look to the eupport of the national bunkH.
Judti'ud of sweeping the system out of exist
ent the officials at Washington would foster
and subtain it The President while prohibit
ing the 2>aymeut of interest ou deposits, would
give tho banks additional facilities of circula
tion. His recommendations aro only for the
banks and not for the people. They tail to ,
reach the seat of tho disease and practically
are mere platitudes which would be hurtful iu
application. But tho President has done well
in opposing inflation. If he had only gone a
littlo further u?d favored making the national
currency to consist only of legal tender notes,
sweeping away those dangerous institutions,
the banks, ho would have done what the busi
ness interests of the country require. He.
almost did it in suggesting to the considera
tion of Congress whether it would not bo well
that, banking should be free. Only another
word was nec essary to make General Grant the
champion of the true financial policy of the
government

The special despatches to the II r, bald
which we give elsewhere will afford a melan
choly pleasure to the friends of the survivors j
of the ocean calamity, who were treated in j
England with such touching sympathy in j
their disaster; but to tho iuconsolable sorrow
of those who liave lost their relatives rauat
now be added, apparently, the painful knowl
edge that the disaster might not only have
been avoided, but was actually due to a wrong
order to the mau at the wheel. If wo accu
rately interpret the words, which the cable has
put in a somewhat ambiguous form, the sailor
on the lookout reported a ship in sight to the
officer on duty, who gave a "confused order"
to the helmsman, and on this "eon i used or
der" the whole history of the occurrence will
turu. No doubt the wheel was put tho wrong
way. The officer referred to, who has j>er
ished, is also blamed by the Captain. It ap
pears that, as commonly happens in these
cases, there was no dhciplina. There were
also no life preservers. One gentleman
searched vainly in four cabins for these
article* and found none. Our present de
spatches correct previous statements regarding
the weather. It was a clear, starlight night
Upon the arrival of th<) survivors at Cardiff
Xhey wero rejeoived with generous sympathy,
but the United States Consul, who had some
duties in the case, was not there. Are United
States Consuls always absent in eases of great
emergency ?
It is tunc that practical steps were taken for
the prevention of these horrors by the adop
tion of .steamer laws. This terrible disaster
has had no parallel since that which befell the
United States mail steamer Arctic, in October,
185-4, when in a thick tog ofl Cape Race she
collided with ihe French steamer Vast a. On
tliat fearful occasion there perished with the
noble vessel about three hundred men, women
and children. The terrors of that scene
aroused the ingenuity of science to devise
some adequate remedy for such accidents.
Numerous plans were proposed for multiply
ing liie-saving apparatus on board ships, and
preventive appliances, such as fog signals,
trie compasses, Sw. ; but among all the expe
dients then devised the most simple and com
prehensive was proposed by Lieutenant Maury,
the Superintendent of the National Observa
tory, and which, after the lapse of so many
years, ha-t recently been adopted by the Cunard
steamships. He proposed two ship laws, one for
steamers going and the other for steamers
returning, so chartered that there would be a
minimum risk of collision, and that minimum
only contined to collision with sailing vessels.
The part of the ocean used by the different
lines is a belt extending between fifteen
decrees and sixty-five degrees west longitude,
and between ono huudred and fifty and three
hundred miles broad. Wiule some of those
marine roadways overlap and intersect each
other, the proposition, therefore, to lay off a
law of twenty-five or thirty miles breadth on
the northern and southern borders of a given
route, and the recommendation to steamers
coming westwardly to use the former and
going eastward ly to use the latter, if adopted,
w >uld vastly lessen tlie liabilities of collision.
The strong argument urged by many in
behalf of the general adoption of these laws
was that as soon as th<-ir adoption by steamers
became known to seamen all sailing v<s
b? Is would immciliately giva a wide berth
to them, just as on the public high
ways the horse vehicles avoid the railroads.
Moreover, it was apparent that if a
sailing vessel had occasion to cross the steamer
laws in the darkness of night or umid the be
wilderment of a fog, she would bo doubly vigi
lant. to avoid collision, as the pedestrian is ,
when at night compelled to cross the track of i
the locomotive. The steam tracks were pur- i
posely made so narrow that, if a sailing ves
sel s course was near tbom as night came on
or the weather thickened, the master would
begin to think of the steamers and collisions,
and feel uneasy until he had edged off to ono
side and left the steam track clear. T tie old
paddle-wheel steamnxs, by their no^e, gave
warning of their approach; bat the modern
screw Steamer is & noiseless monste r, and in
fuggy or he.ivy weather slides almost unheard
and with deadly speed through the waves.
This faot and the rapidly multiplying
lriqnency of collisions, wrecks and great '
looses of life, ail pi end, tmmpot-tongued,
for the adoption of any routes by
steamers which may enhance safety. This is 1
imperatively demanded, even ut the sacrifice
of tinio and fpeod, were such sacrifices neces
sary; but, so far from it, there can he little
doubt that if the proposed laws were followed
time would be saved. The steamers' track for
vos eltf coming worstwardly lies far enough
north to a*void the returning effect of the Gulf
Stream currout, and is thirty mil s shorter
than the old Guuurd and Collins track, while
that for vessels going to Europe, though
sen nty-flr<? miles longer in distance, is shorter
in time, bneautc it lies in the axial band of the
Gulf Stream (which hel(M the steamer), and
is favored by flrior wuithor and fewer fogs.

Tbe Nomination for Chlrf Ju*lice?hlp.
Our Washington despatches inform us that
President Orant yesterday sent to the Senate
the nomination of Attorney General Williams,
of the present Cabinet, an Chief Justice of
the United States. As the Scuate is at
present constituted, having an administra
tion majority which can be counted on
for confirming uny thing the administration
desires, this nomination is virtually an ap
pointment. The President has waited many
mouths before coming to this conclusion,
and no one who wishes the President well can
rejoioe iu the nomination. Mr. Williams is
so new a man that he must wear the honor
that, has desoonded on his shoulders somo time
bafore any one can tell whither ho is likely to
adorn the position or not. The ono thing
certain about him is that he has managed to
fill some conspicuous party positions without
any trace of greatness being apparent As a
Western politician he was first heard of, ami
then as an obodient Senator ho appeared at
the national capital. This position he lost iu
?he course of time. President Grant now
found him, and he appeared in the Joint High
Commission, but left no mark of consequence,
and when he was preparing to vegetate the
President rnada him Attorney General. -
To-day this successful partisan, who must
wonder at his groat luck, finds the diadem of
the American Bar at his feet. What he h:i$
done for his party except obey it ; what
ability he has shown as t? lawyer, except in
hastening to justify questionable party acts;
what ho has accomplished iu life, except drift
on politics into sucoess, are things he will
ask himself without hope of giving
a very satisfactory reply. We have
condemned tbo plan which would make
such a toweriug national position as the Chief
Justiceship a thing of mere party Bpoil or
paily bargaining. This appointment unhap
pily exhibits the greatest office in the Presi
dent's gift as flung in the basket whence coun
try pojtmasterships and obscure foreign con
sulates are drawn as party pay. It is not
even given to a groat partisan, but. seeins
shuffled out as part of a bargain which will
give another appointment to some needy
being among tho followers of tfio powen> that
be. The President cannot think that
iu passing over groat lawyers like
Evarts, Curtis, O'Conor and Hushing ho has
done a respectful thing to the intelligence of
the nation. At least a score of other names
high in legal honor* might be mentioned,
whose fitness in every respcct for the position
would have been manifest to the world. Only
out of abject flattery could it be said that the
name of Mr. Williams, of Oregon, would be
found alnong yuch. England rewarded her
unsuccessful lawyer in tha Geneva arbitra
tion, Six Roundell Palmer, with the Lord Chan
cellorship ; America slights her successful
lawyer in the samo high court by giving the
appointment of the Chief Justice to a man
whoso fitness has no test beyond steady ser
vico to a political party. Had Mr. Curtis beeu

The Virginian Protocol? Tlie Proposed
Surrender to Spain.
The terms agreed tipon between Secretary
Fish and Admiral Polo for tbo settlement of
the Virginius outrage ara now before the
American people. Tbo protocol, at length
officially published, differs but little from tho
version furnished scrui-offlcially to the press
last Sunday, except that in the latter Spain
was made to guarantee the institution of pro
ceedings against any of her authorities who
may have violated either law or treaty stipu
lations, whila the original document reads
that such proceedings, "it is understood," are
to be instituted by Spain. The conditions are,
however, in substance such as we have already
commented on at length. Tlioy are degrading
to the United States. They afford no guarantee
that Spain relinquishes tie right of visitation
and search on the, high seas which she has
claimed and enforced with such fatal results.
They give no protection for tho future to our
commerce or to the lircs of our citizcms. They
leave the atrocious rule in Cuba untouched.
They quench no spark of the firebrand which
for the past live yoars has bean brandished at
our threihold, and from which wo are in con
stant danger of a conflagration. They recall
no woni of the outrageous proclamations of
the Cuban Captains General Dulce and Do
Rodas agaiust which our Secretary of State ?
always as sweet as molasses towards the Span
ish government has fulminated his doughty
protests. They leave us, in fact, with
all these Spattisll-Cuban complications,
insults and outrages threatening aud
injuring us, as they have threatened and in
jured us ever since the flames of the Cuban
revolution wore first kindled on the unhajfpy
island.
The disgraceful protocol is an abandon
ment of the demands first mado by our gov
ernment on Spain. Those demands were
published at tho time in the HeBjlld, in our
special despatches from Madrid, find are now
recapitulated by President Grant in his Mes
sage. "In accordance with this principle,"
wivs tho President, alluding to the exemption
from visitation or search in times of peace
churned by us for our vessels on tho high seas,
"the restoration of the VirginiuB, the sur
render of the fflirvivoM of her passengers and
crew, a due reparation to the flag and tho
punishment of the authorities who have beon
guilty of the illegal acts of violence wore de
manded." It will be seen that, the comproniiso
effected by Mr. Fish is nothing liko the
demand. The vessel is to be restored, it is
true, if the Spanish-Cuban outUws do not,
meanwhile, destroy her, nnd the survivors are
to lw surrendered, if tho Spanish-Cuban
butchers do not, meanwhile, cut their throats;
but tho "due rejjoration" to our fla^; is
made conditional, and the punishment ot
the murderer JJurriel and his accomplices
is not conceded. On tho contrary, it is only
"undewtood" that Spain will institute pro
ceedings to discover if any ol bur authorities
liuvo infringed "Spanish laws, ' which legal
uw thaw aUvwiivfc. "Uvatv vMuiafcww." .
wMoh Spain interprets In accordance vran nrr
own views. The protocol is, therefore, a cow
ardly retreat on the purt of our government
from its first position and a dograding sur
render of our national honor.
Wo should deeply regret to find this shame
ful protocol endorsed by President Grant aa
"honorable to both natiouH," if his Messags
did not bear evidence that he has not found
time, in the pressure of his okher duties, te
read the instrument understandingly, and that
he has been grossly misinformed as to its con
tents und meaning. Tho President states thai
the Spanish government "has arranged for
the immediate delivery of tho vessel and for
the surrender of the survivors of the passen
gers and crew, and for a salute to tho flag,
and for proceedings looking to tho punish
ment of those wlio may be proved to have
been guilty of illegal acts of violence toward*
citizens of the United States, and also towards
indemnifying those who may bo shown to b?
entitled to indemnity." A perusal of tho pro
tocol will show the President that his state
ment of its couditions is incorrect He may
not be well vcrsod in diplomatic chicanery,
but common t-ense will prove to him that th?
protocol does not warrant the recapitulation of
the terms of settlement made in his Messago.
When he understands tliat Mr. Fish has vir
tually abandoned all tho conditions demanded
by our government with tho exception of tho
surrender of the ship and the surviving eap
tives he will probably denounce the protoool
as warmly as he now endorsos its supposod
provisions, and will uuite with the Hkrauj in
exhorting the Senate to save us from tho dis
honor of its ratification.
Meanwhile we commend to the attention of
tho President, the Senate, the Secretary of
Stato and Admiral Polo the special despatches
of the Herald correspondents at Havana and
Santiago de Cuba published to-day. From*
th^se despatches the administration and the
Spunish official will understand the spirit that
actuates the Spanish-Cuban outlaws and the
character of the people with whom we are
asked to make a disgraceful compromise. Is
it probable that we can live in the future in
peaceful neighborhood with such a community,1
even if we should yield our national honor for,
tho sako of a hollow truce? It would be*
singular if to tho insubordination and ferocity!
of these bloodthirsty spirits of tho Casino
Espafiol we should owe our escape from'
national dishonor; but even if tho fierce oppo
sition of the Spauish-Cubans to the proposed!
settlement should turn out to be nothing more
than a frothy exhibition of their characteristic,
bluster it should at loivst open the eyes of tho
Senate of tho United States to the necessity of
better guarantees for the future than are to bo
found in the terms of surrender signed by the
limbtr diplomat? at the head of our Stato
Department
Mr. DUracli on the Spirit of tUe
Iu another part ot the paper will be found
the eloquent address delivered by Mr. Disraoli
upon his installation as Lord Rector of th*
University of Glasgow. Mr. Disraeli s art as
an orator and his graceful style always iusuro
au intellectual treat to his admirers ; but ou
this occasion thero is especial attraction ia the
iugeouity of construction by which a
and ccrenionial speech is made a telling bill
of indictment against the liberal party, a*
weU es in the rich diction and pellucid phrase
ology by which the o tutor's opinions are p re
sented in a guise so woll-bred and elegant that
it would seem vulgar to doubt them, while to
oppose might excite the suspicion that one
had low-bred liberal sympathies. Profess
edly Mr. Disraeli deals with "tho spirit ofi
the age." He tells the students that it*
life two kinds of knowledge are necessary ?
first, knowledge of ourselves and of our powers
as useful indications for the choice of a
career; and, second, the knowledge necessary
for the pursuit of that career, tie most im
portant point of this latter kind of knowl
edge being a true perception of the character
and vital spirit of the time in which our ac
tivity shall full- In giving tho students a few
hints for enabling them practically to ntlliza
his advice and to form an estimate of the
spirit of this age, he does not. lose the oppor
tunity to present a case against the political
party in power, which it is his especial
function to criticise. lie tells them*
that the spirit of the time In which we
live is the "spirit of equality," auJ
further aud incidentally, that tha "equality ot
all subjects before the law is the only founda
tion of a perfect commonwealth." Equality
before the law, therefore, is not the sort thai
we are to fear and oppose ; but there
are othor kinds. There is social equality,
that woidd obliterate classes, and thero
is physical equality, that would obliterate
countries? that is, political frontiers, so that
in Groat BritaiD, for instance, it would make
no difference in a man's chances iu Ufa
whether he Were an Englishman, an Irishman
or a Scotchman, and no difference in tha
consideration of a purely political topic
whether it applied to an abuse or a rernody
for Dublin or London. These are tho kind*
of equality against, which the eloquent gentle
man explodes his wrath. Social equality w
held up in the dreadful examples of the French
Revolution to exoite a salutary fear in tha
bosoms of good conservative children; and
physical equality, we are assured, is "the dw
iurw?*
by win" swell to a "raging stonn"; ?C
course, the conservatives get into office
when we shall bmr no more of it In
oth'T words, Mr. Disraeli's oration is a
V( y elegant, brilliant and thoroughly
unsound argument against tho mam
political tendency of this period; and tins tact
indicates how sate a guide ho is to people who
wu,h to comprehend the spirit ot tho age. Aro
t,h(, rttudents of Glasgow so callow in their wit
that they can be made to behave in any posai
blc simdarity between the effects of the politi
cal cataclysm of '8'.) and the liberalism of the
party now in power in England? Or has the
orator underrated their intelligence/ W s
suspect the latt ?r. The editors of the London
S/aii'iard may believe in, or affect to be.liove in,
these fancy comparisons, but a crowd of uni
versity Scotchmen uro out of tho reach of
shot* of that calibre.
Tins SrANisu Refubijo has boen declared
