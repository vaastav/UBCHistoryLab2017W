21iss Morrison to Give Evidence
in Her Own Behalf.
Defense Will Try to Impeacli
Castle's Testimony.
SURPRISES IN STORE.
Witnesses Who Will State That
He Swore Falsely. -
Man Who Heard Mrs. Castle In
vite the Defendant
Into Her House, Has Been
Found and Will Testify.
El Dorado. Dec. 5. At 10:30 Tuesday
night court adjourned the Morrison case
until today with arguments as to the
admittance to the jury of Mrs. Castle's
alleged dying statement unfinished
It is announced that the defense has
1- cated the canvasser, A. J. Morgan.who
called at the Castle home on the morn-
ing of June 22, the day of the tragedy,
and will have him here to testify.
The defendant hopes to prove by his
testimony that Clara Wiley Castle call
ed Jessie into her house. This would
add an air of probability to the allega
tion that after the altercation between
the two. Mrs. Castle attacked Jessie
Morrison and the latter defended herself
with such terrible results. The aefeno
ant has an affidavit of M. A. duller, a
firmer, who alleged that a canvasser,
Morgan, told him that Clara Castle call
ed Jessie into her house on June 22.
To an old schoolmate, who was per
mitted to visit her in her cell during the
ivx.n hour, Miss Morrison said:
-I know that some people think that,
eause I do not cry all the time, I am
a brazen thing, but you know that my
every motion is severely criticised. Tou
an never know how very tired and
weary 1 get sittine in that big chair all
day long. It is very hard for me to re
strain mvseif from weeping in the court
mom. but I endeavor to do so. When I
am alone in mv room I just cannot help
it and cry myself to sleep every night."
The defense has five witnesses to con
tradict the evidence given by Olin Cas
tle, to the eftVet that at 11 o'clock on the
niaht of June 11, Jessie Morrison met
him on the stret-t near his home and
wanted him to go to a dark place where
Khe said she wanted to talk to him.
Thest witnesses will swear that Jessie
was not there at all that night, and that
she was .spending the night with friends
in another part of town. It is also giv
er: out that the defense has a witness by
whom it expects to piove Clara Wiley's
jealousy of Jessie Morrison's attentions
toward" Olin Castle. It is said that she
emploved a woman named Push to
watch' the actions of the defendant and
young Castle, before his marriage .and
this woman will testify to a number ot
things that have not thus far been
brought out in the examination.
The state will rest its case today. It
will take the defense about two days to
get its evidence in. The defendant will
be placed on the stand in her own be
half. She will be the last' one to testify
before rebuttal testimony is offered.
It is rumored that the state will pro
duce a note dropped by Jessie Morri
son in the house after the traeedy. which
reads: "I have killed Clara Castle. Olin
will know." This note would prove pre
meditation, but when asked about it the
state's attorneys said they had no such
j'apar.
The entire day was consumed in estab
lishing the validity of the dying state
ment of Clara V iiey Castle by testi
mony and argument. The state intro
duced a number of witnesses to identify
the statement and testify that Mrs. Cas
tle had made it when she believed that
she was going to die.
The statement was made by Mrs. Cas
tle in brief sentences in answer to ques
tions propounded by Austin Brumback.
a brother of the county attorney, who
was absent from the city. The statement,-
except the last seven lines, was
made on the night of July 3. The next
flay Dr. C . Ambrose, attached seven
lines to the statement, ' it being thought
that it was not complete. It was then
Bhown to Mrs. Castle and she signed it
after she had been told by the doctors
that she could not recover. This is the
contention of the state. .
The- defense holds that Mrs. Castle did
not write the statement, that she did
not believe she was going to die at the
time it was made and that the seven
lines added by Dr. Ambrose invalidated
it . On these grounds the witnesses were
interrogated throughout the day. After
supper the arguments began, Mr. Kra
mer opening for the defense. He held to
the first and second premises and spike
for an hour. Mr. Schumacher followed
and after attacking the validity of the
statement from the third standpoint
presented some supreme court decisions
in support of the cause. Judsre Redden
read a supreme court decision that dying
declarations are not admissible throus'i
conclusions of witnesses, mental Imprest-ions
or opinions.
County Attorney Brumback argued
If-. at Clara Wiley Castle did believe she
was at dt ath's door when she wrote the
answers which were afterward wreathed
into a dying statement by Mr. Brum
back. He also quoted supreme court de
cisions. The Jury- was not in the court
room during the entire day or the even
ing while the testimony was taken and
while the arguments were beirfg made
Captain Waters followed Mr - Brum
back for the state. He said the state
ment was competent because it was
founded on fart and had been written bv
Mrs. Castle. He argued for it section bv
section. During some of his impassion
ed remarks touching on Mrs Wilev's
talk with her daughter, there was hard
ly a dry eye in the audience. M's Mo--jison
sat with pale face, but showed no
emotion.
Austin Brumback. brother of the
county attorney, and the man who took
the dying statement of Clara Wiiev
Castie. was placed on the stand.
Mr. Kramer, of counsel for defense
took up the cross-examination of Brum
back after the latter had told of the in
cidents connected with the taking of th
statement as related by Dr. Ambrose.
"Why di 1 you take this statement?"
asked Mr. Kramer.
"Because I was acting for the county
attorney," replied Brumback. In an
swer to a question as to why he had
gone to take Mrs. Castle's statement the
evening of July 3. Brumback said he
bad been informed that she was dying.
"you were informed several times
during the day that She was dying. Why
didn't you do it before evening?"
"It's hard to tell why we don't do
things. It's easier after we have done
them to tell why we do them," replied
Brumback.
The audience enjoyed the sally and
Mr. Kramer cleared his throat for a
fresh effort.
"You had a feeling against this de
fendant, didn't you?" he was asked.
"No, sir. I am prejudiced against the
crime she is charged with committing,
but am not prejudiced against the de
fendant." "Didn't you hope to convict Jessie
Morrison with this statement?"
"I had no further hope or purpose than
to see justice done."
Mr. Kramer was growing angry at
Brumback, and called for an answer,
yes or no.
The court so ordered, but by shrewd
movements Brumback evaded the ques
tion and followed it with a. graphic de
scription of the contents of the state
ment. At the place where Mrs. Castle
said in her statement that Jessie Mor
rison handed her the letter and then
struck her with the razor, he arose and
with gestures described the scene trag
ically. Had the jury been present at
this juncture the illustration could not
but have made a strong impression on
its mind. Kramer finally asked Brum
back if he heard the dying woman say
she was going to die before she signed
the statement. He said:
"I did not hear it for there was a
delicacy on my part of telling her that
she was going to die."
Edna Wharton and the Rev. Dr.
Wharton, pastor of the M. E. church, of
which Mrs. Castle and Miss Morrison
were members, were on the stand to
show that Mrs. Castle knew she was
going to die when she made her state
ment. Both had heard Dr. Koogler tell
her. Dr. Koogler was called and cor
rotorated their testimony. Dr. Koogier
testified that Mrs. Castle was of sound
mind w"hen she made her statements.
The day after she signed the statement
Dr. Koogler said she wrote nearly 100
letters to her friends, sending them fond
messages and leaving some tokens of
her love. Some she asked to join the
church, which they did.
Dr. Koogler said he had held out little
hope to Mrs. Castle of recovery from the
first, as when he first reached the house
he would not have been surprised had
she died in ten minutes. Later he said
reaction set in, and in his zeal he
thought she would get well and he told
her. Afterward, however, when she be
gan failing, he saw there was no hope,
and so told her. July 4 he told her to
get ready to die.
During Dr. Koogler's testimony Mr.
and Mrs. Wiley sat with bowed heads.
Mrs. Wiley supported her head with her
hand, covering her face with her hand
kerchief. Her emotions were plainly
visible. Dr. Koogler explained that he
had administered opiates to Mrs. Castle
during the last days of her life, but that
it had been given to relieve pain, and
was not in such quantities as to affect
her mind. Mrs. Wiley, mother of Clara
Wiley Castle, was called to the stand.
She testified that she wasat her daugh
ter's bedside on the afternoon of July 4.
"I knew that X'lara was going to die
and Clara knew it also,", she said.
"As I knelt at her side she said:
'Mama, I am going to die.' I said 'yes,'
and that it would be hard for me as
she had always been such a pleasure
and comfort to me. But," continued
Mrs. Wiley, "I said 'you are going to
heaven, and heaven will be nearer to
me now that you are there." " Mrs.
Castle said her daughter asked for songs
and prayers that evening.
"She wrote everything as no sound
came from her lips," she said. Up to
the night of July 4, Mrs. Wiley said her
daughter thought she would get well.
During the first few minutes she was
on the stand Mrs. Wiley showed signs
of giving way, but she rallied after re
lating the scene and when the defense
questioned her she had completely re
gained her composure and her answers
came loud and clear. She wore deep j
mourning and the sad look in her eyes
depicted the suffering she has experi
enced since the tragedy.
Dr. Fullenvvider testified that on July
3 he was at Clara Castle's bedside, and
she wrote him a note asking if she
would get well. He said he did not re
ply to this note.
"Later." he said, "she wrote 'Be can
did. I am getting very weak. I don't
see how I can get well.' "
"What did you tell her?"
"I told her she must prepare to die.
as the end was near, and if she had any
word to leave to prepare to leave it,
as she could not live long."
He said that she had suggested the
taking of the dying statement in the
presence of Mrs. Castle. She had not
signed it until after she knew she was
going- to die. He heard ier asking for
prayers.
ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE
Mrs. Castle's Dying Statement Given
to the Jury.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 5. A special
to the Star from El Dorado, Kan., says:
Mrs. Castle's deathbed statement of
accusation against Jessie Morrison was
today admitted as evidence in the case.
The statement, which declares that Miss
Morrison provoked the quarrel with the
bride and then began an attack that
cost Mrs. Castle her life, is considered
the strongest evidence presented by the
state.
The point of its admission had been
argued since yesterday mornning, and
during that time the jury had been ex
cused. Jessie Morrison gave w-ay to her feel
ings in the court room this morning and
wept for the first time since her trial
began. It occurred during the final ar
gument of Judge Redden, one of the
prisoner's attorneys, against the admis
sion of the statement.
Judge Redden said that Captain
Waters, for the state, had depicted the
horror of the wounding of the bride,
had painted the scene of sorrow at the
deathbed, "and now." said the attor
ney. "I understand the purpose of thi3
thing. It was an attack upon this de
fendant here to intimidate and cow
and if possible to break her down, then
point to it when this case goes before
the jury as an evidence of her guilt, or
if she could brace herself against it and
by her will power not break down, they
would point to that as evidence of a.
guilty conscience."
As Judge Redden talked tie looked
at the prisoner, whose eyes were wet
with tears. She gulped down a sob and
hid her eyes with her handkerchief.
Miss Morrison has steadfastly main
tained complete control of herself as she
sat through the tedious examination of
the state's witnesses and this was her
first show of a breakdown. Once re
leased the tears flowed freely.
Judge Redden continued at length. H
charged that the dying declaration made
by Mrs. Castle was a concoction of men
who sought to convict an innocent girl.
She was a frail girl against whom vin
dictive men had conspired. Ail the
evidence on which the attorneys for the
state depended for conviction, he de
clared was circumstantial, excepting the
dying- statement of Clara Castle.
SELLS CASE IS ON
Peter Sells Continues His Story
on Witness Stand.
W. W. Phillips, of Topeka, Sent
Property Description.
HE IS THE SELLS AGENT
Transfer of Holdings From Mrs.
Sells Occurred Afterward. .
Tho Plaintiff Tells of His Per
sonal Habits.
The Sells divorce case has been re
sumed. Another Topeka man has been
drawn into the case in a business ca
pacity. He is W. W. Phillips, the Sells
agent in Topeka. He sent Mr. Sells a
description of the Topeka property in
Mrs. Sells name preceding the transfer
of the property.
A dramatic scene occurred during the
cross-examination of Peter Sells. This
was while the witness was identifying
the different diamonds and presents
which he had bestowed upon Mrs. Sells.
As he proceeded to look at the different
articles Mrs. Sells was coaching her
counsel in a rather loud tone of voice.
Stopping suddenly and looking squarely
at his wife Mr. Sells said: "These are
not all the rings you have?"
"When you get off the stand you may
have an opportunity to ask questions,
but not now," interrupted Mr. Huling.
"Well, she was talking to me," re
torted Mr. Sells.
Mrs. Sells, who had been closely
watching her husband, nervously bit
her lips and instantly directed her gaze
to the opposite side of the room.
This is the first time Mr. Sells has
spoken directly to his wife since the
separation, and the incident created a
stir in the court room.
A watch belonging to Miss Florence
Sells was among the collection of arti
cles identified, but Mr. Sells explained
that some valuable presents were miss
ing. Among these was a large diamond
ring that came to Miss Florence from
the Ellen McCune estate. This Mr. Sells
said had been traded by Mrs. Sells for
other articles.
Mr. Sells took the stand at 10 o'clock.
The worry and agony of the trial seems
to be telling on him. Mr. Booth took up
the redirect examination. Resuming,
Mr. Sells said that the preliminary work
for the circus in the spring of 1S(8 was
done at the Main street grounds. Mi
Hatfield had the contract for painting.
This was Mr. Al . Field's (Hatfield)
father. Here Mrs. Sells was taken by
her husband. Mrs. Ann Sells, witness'
sister-in-law, rode in the grand parade
and entree and rode a side saddle and
with skirts. In reference to the profit
of $160,000 made by the show in 1899 Mr.
Sells said that the expenses for winter
ing the show and the wear and tear o
cars and paraphernalia were not taken
out of this sum. Mr. Lew Sells and
himself were very hard up and had not
made much improvement on the cars,
etc. The two items would probably
amount to $40,000, wintering and repair
ing. The general conditions of the coun
try, prosperous and otherwise, would
be felt sooner by a show than by any
other business. Local conditions w-ould
affect the income of a show as would the
time of the season and the weather. Wet
weather was a killer. Competition with
other shows invariably increased the
-expenses and often materially reduced
the receipts. Here aavertising in news
papers, bill boards and pictorial work
would be increased during competition.
Mr. Sells sold out in the spring of 1900
so his evidence along the line of what
the show did that year was objected to.
Mr. Booth had asked him whether the
general conditions were a3 favorable in
1900 as in 1899. Col. Holmes' objection
was that facts " and not comparisons
should govern the character of the e i
dence. Mr. Booth remarked that there
seemingly had been a dispute as to
whether the sale by Mr. Peter Sells was
bona fide. Witness said that the general
conditions in 1S99 were good.
"How were they in 1900?" asked Mr.
Booth. "Not so good." In 1S98 they were
not as good as in 1899. The circus busi
ness had not been good for ten years
prior to 1899.
Mr. Sells, alluding to the two times he
had testified as to having been intoxica
ted since his marriage, said that once
was when the viaduct was building. Mr.
Sells said that this time was after the
viaduct decision had been made. He was
in Willam Taylor's place on East Broad
street, with Mr. Kauffman. Mr. Seiis
said he was not so drunk that he could
go to supper and also play billiards. The
other time was in November, 1891. This
was on the right before the show got
there. Mr. Sells had been down to the
dock and afterwards took three drinks
of Scotch whisky the first he had ever
tackled. The next day he was working
all right and the show got in.
Regarding female performers with a
circus, Mr. Sells said they were gener
ally married or with their families. Mr.
Sells was ihown the letter he wrote to
Mr. J. E. Sater on November 15 and
identified the epistle. This letter was
passed over to Messrs. Holmes and Hu
ling, who scrutinized it carefully. This
was marked plaintiff's exhibit No. 17.
The letter was dated Beaumont, Tex.
November 13, and says that Mr. Levi3
Sells would call on Mr. Sater November
23 or 24 and consult with him on an im
portant matter. Also, that the Topeka
representative had shipped some import
ant papers.
Mr. Sells said he always bought his
own underwear and that after. her fath
er's death Mrs. Sells wore black clothes
and a black hat turned up behind and
pulled welj down over her face. She
wore silk petticoats and her dresses were
generally lined with silk. From 1897 to
1S99 she dressed well and in that fash
ion. Her dresses were generally of
cloth.
During the last five years of their
married life they occupied separate
looms and when Mr. Sells would come
home, he testified his wife w-ould be
tired and would request to occupy her
own apartments.
Mr. Huling then took the witness and
asked Mr. Sells where he got the letter
introduced in evidence. Witness said
that Mr. Sater had it and until one day
last week he had not seen the letter since
he wrote it.
He had been told by Mr. Sater to
carry the letter to Mr, Booth. The let
ter was on Mr. Sater's desk with a lot
of other papers and there was no envel
ope. Mr. Sells said he returned on No
vember 24 but could not tell when Mr.
Lewis Sells had arrived. The show got
home the day before and Mr. Lewis Set's
generally traveled with the show. Busi
ness for the show had detained Mr.Peter
Sells at Little Rock and New Orleans.
W. W. Phillips of Topeka.-was the man
who sent the important papers, desenn
tions of the Topeka property, in Mrs.
Sells' name to Mr. Sater. Mr. Sells said
he wanted the property in his own name
after the investigations about his wife
had been made. Witness said the. show
business was fraught with disaster and
in answer to Mr. Huling Mr. Sells said
that he had transferred some property
to Mrs. Sells to protect them In their old
age, in case of a disaster.
Mr. Sells, in response to a nuestion from
Mr. Huling, said he had not been addicted
to drink since his marriage.
T never said I did not drink," said he,
"I had sown my wild oats, but after my
engagement I did not drink."
"You said you had never had a quarrel
witn your wire.' asuea Mr. ttunng.
"Only such as any married people
have," was the reply.
Then the letter, dated January 31, 1SS1,
was introduced.
It is understood that these letters say
that Mr. Sells promises not to quarrel with
his wife any more, or to drink. Also that
one speaks ot some property that Mr.
Sells is to deed to his-wife, but the attor
neys sav nothing was said about its beinff
"in trust" but the word "give" is said to
have been used.
Plaintiff's attorneys took up the morning
recess looxing over tne letters introduced.
A letter dated August 1. 1880. was of
fered in evidence, and Mr. Booth said he
would prefer to have St read in court. The
defense said the letters were in evidence
and did not read tins one. "was this one
read to you by counsel at recess?" asked
Mr. Huling. Mr. Sells said he had heard
it. In this letter the text said, "You know
I don't like Anna, but we are making
money ana l aon c want to oo anything
now that would cause ill-feeling. If
we have luck for a few years we will
have plenty to live on."
Mr. Sells said that "Anna" was Lewis'
wife. Mrs. Sells did not like her and Mr.
Sells said he never particularly liked Mrs.
Anna Sells. He had left their house be
cause he didn't like the way he was
treated.
Mr. I.uker, Mrs. Sells' brother, brought
in a 'big jug. The jug was wrapped in
newspaper and had a string handle. Mr.
Sells said he did not use beer but kept !t
at the house for his friends. Mrs. Sells
bought the beer in the summer time and
witness said that he thought that manv
of the liquor bills were paid by Mrs. Sells
in the summer time when he was away
with the show. Mr. Sells said he had
found lots of liquors in Mrs. Sells closet
that he had never bought.
The liquors that he did not see were
fancy cordials like absinthe, benedictine,
etc., in fancy odd shaped bottles. "Go into
any bar room," said witness, "and vou
will find them there. A great quantity of
bottles were in her closet. There are no
bills here for those things, I notice."
"Do you know what benedictine is?"
asked Mr. Sells. "No. I am free to say
I don't." replied Mr. Huling. Continuing
Mr. Sells said. "If I bought those fancv
bottles why don't you present the bill?"
A sherry bill calling for one gallon of
sherry and dated January 30. 1S99. was re
pudiated by Mr. Sells. It did not go into
evidence right away. "Why don't you put
that bill in evidence?" said Mr. Sells. "I
wasn't in the city on that day."
Then Mr. Huting produced the jug.
"Didn't Bud Gorman make you a pres
ent of this full of rye after Christmas,
"I never saw the jug." said Mr. Sells.
The jug was empty but had a Kentucky
tag.
"My name is not on it," sarcastically re
marked Mr. Sells.
"Why. was your name on the jug you
got?" flashed Mr. Huling.
"I never got any." was Mr. Sells' replv.
During the jug episode Mrs. Sells fre
quently consulted with her attorneys and
laughed heartily when Mr. Huling an
nounced it was empty.-
The jewelry question was next taken up
by Mr. Huling and Mrs. Sells produced
t"he necklace, the wedding gift. It had
a cross upon it. Both handled it rever
ently. "Has your wife worn It lately?"
"No," was Mr. Sells' reply in a low voice.
"I have not seen her wear it in recent
years." The first watch he gave her was
mentioned.
"Where is that watch now?" asked Mr.
Huling.
"That's the one he threw across the
room," said Mrs. Sells to Mr. Huling.
"Isn't that the one you threw across
the room and broke?" asked Mr. Huling.
"I did not." was the reply. Then Mr.
Huling asked if that watch, on account
of its unpleasant recollections, wasn't raf
fled off in Australia for 12 pounds. Mr
Sells said that was the first time he had
heard of what had become of it. The
round watch mentioned some days ago
was then mentioned.
It was a second-hand watch when he
bought it. Mr. Sells denied that the round
watch had been bought with part of the
proceeds of the raffle: and denied that
Mr. Luker had given him the money pro
ceeds of the raffle. The round watch went
into the exhibits. During the jewelry ex
amination Mrs. Sells manifested the' live
liest interest. The day the watch was
bought, some opals were purchased. The
whole bunch cost $200. There were opals
worth 10 or 15 pounds. "If she's got her
jewelry box there." said Mr. Sells, "she
can show them to you."
The big Brisbane opal was shown. Mr.
Sells emphatically denied that anv money
had been paid by his wife. The $150 dia
mond ear drops, Mr. Sells said, were
bought in Chicago, but he could not iden
tify the stones in court. There was a lot
of jewelry loose in court for a few mo
ments. KILLED AND WOUNDED.

INSURANCE SWINDLE.
Results in the Death of One of the
Promoters.
Sioux City, la., Dec. 5. Charges of. an
attempted insurance swindle that cost
the life of one of the alleged swindlers
are made by J. H. Hurd, of the Labor
ing Men's Co-operative Life association,
who has just returned from an inves
tigation of the case. George A. Barber,
of Webster City, la,, Who held a policy
for $7,800 in the company, is dead at
Pagosa, Colo., and Mrs. Mary Wright,
of Chicago, and W. R. Neff are held
at the same place to appear at the
coroner's inquest. It is said that Barber
met Mrs. Wright in Chicago last sum
mer and took her to Denver, where Neff
appeared. The policy was made pay
able to Mrs. Wright, who was alleged
to be Barber's affianced.
Mr. Hurd charges that the policy w-as
taken out with an intention to defraud,
although in the original plan- he- says
Barber's death was not to be a re
ality. Later, he says, the scheme was
changed, and he makes the assertion
that Barber, who died in convulsions in
a. hotel office, was poisoned.

on. rules, presented a special order for
the house to immedaitely begin the con
sideration of the army reorganization
bill. No time was set for a vote on the

The resolution was adopted. It was
arranged that general debate should run
for four hours, two hours on a side, and
that then the bill should be considered
under the. five minute rule.
Mr. Hull opened the debate. He ridi
culed the charges made during the re

ing army.

vania, chairman of the committee on
banking and currency, today introduced

REDUCES BEER TAX.
Revenue Reduction Bill as Completed
by House Committee.
.Washington, Dec. 5. The revenue re
duction bill has been completed by the
Republican members of the ways and
means committee, and Chairman Payne
will introduce the bill before the close
of the session today. It is understood
that in addition to the abolition of the
stamp taxes on telegrams, express re
ceipts and proprietary medicines, here
tofore reported, there will be a reduc
tion of the beer tax to $1.60. The pres
ent tax is ?2 per barrel with IV2 per
cent, rebate to $1.85, so that the reduc
tion will be 25 cents per barrel. Chair
man Payne has called a meeting of
the full ways and means committee for
tomorrow to consider the bill.
The decision concerning beer was ar
rived at after some discussion and by a
divided vote. It was first attempted to
make the reduction on tea, but this was
not concurred in, and the question re
curring to beer the reduction was de
cided upon. The stamp taxes were al
most entirely wiped out with the excep
tion of the stamp tax on stocks.
TREATY DISCUSSED.
Say-Pauncefote Document
Before
Senate Committee.
Washington, Dec. 5. The Hay-Paunce-
fote treaty concerning the Nicaraguan
canal was the subject of a few minutes'
consideration today by the senate com
mittee on foreign relations, which com
mittee has charge of the treaty in-, the
senate. The treaty already has b&nl
therefore only taken up in an informal
way and for discussion only. No con
clusion was possible except to decide to
press the question in the senate, and
there was substantial agreement upon
the wisdom of this policy. There is no
division in the committee except upon
amendments, although Senator Bacon
did not manifest any great concern for
the passage of the treaty in any shape.
No vote on any subject connected with
the treaty was possible in the commit
tee, but the discussion revealed the fact
that the committee is evenly divided
upon the question of the amendment of
the document in accordance with the
provision reported during the last ses
sion of congress, providing for the for
tification of the proposed canal. The
committee stands:
For the amendment, Messrs. Lodge
and Clark, Republicans, and Daniel,
Bacon and Money, Democrats.
Against it, Messrs. Frye, Cullom, For
aker and Wolcott, Republicans, and
Morgan, Democrat.
The advocates of both lines of policy
each express the opinion that the op
posing side will in the end surrender.
CANTEEN- AMENDMENT.
Likely to Make Trouble For the Back
ers of the Army BilL
Washington, Dec. 5. The canteen pro
vision in the new army bill is likely to
cause a great deal of contention. In
stead of being a prohibition of the sale
of liquor it provides that no army ulti
cer or soldier shall sell liquor. The pro
vision is as follows:
"That no officer or private soldier shall
sell intoxicating drinks of any kind, as
a bartender or otherwise, in any army
post, or on any army transport, or in
any encampment, or fort, or on any
premises used for military purposes by
the United States: and the secretary of
war is hereby directed to Issue such
general order as may be necessary to
carry the provisions of this section Into
full force and effect."
The canteen provision of the present
law is as follows:
"That no officer or private soldier shall
be detailed to sell Intoxicating drinks,
as a bartender or otherwise, in any post
exchange or canteen, nor shall any
other person be required or allowed to
sell such liquors In any encampment or
fort, or on any premises used for mil
itary, purposes by the United States,
and the secretary of war is hereby di
rected to issue such general order as
may be necessary to carry the provi
sions of this section into full force f nd
effect."
Chairman Hull, of the house commit
tee on military affairs, said today that
the programme for considering the army
reorganization bill as now outlined con
templated a special rule which would
take up the bill today. But as the leg
islative appropriation bill was ready the
right of way would be conceded to that
measure. The army bill will then fol
low. Under the proposed special rule
no precise time will be fixed for taxing
the final vote as this may be reached by
arrangement; otherwise the previous
question will be resorted to for the pur
pose of securing a vote before the close
of the week, if possible. The commit
tee on rules met at 11 o'clock to trams
the special rule.
PINGREE'S PARDON.
It Is Extended to Men Convict
ed of Defrauding State.
Detroit, Mich., Dec. Governor Plnre
at 10 o'clock last nigrht announced that he
had pardoned both General W. I White,
ex-quartermaster peneral, and General A.
F, Marsh, ex-inspector general of the
Michigan national guard, who were con
victed of complicity in the state militia
clothing frauds, upon the payment of
?5,000 fine by each. One thousand dollars
of the fine is to be paid January 1, 1901,
and a "like sum on tne first day of Janu
ary. 3902, 1903. lf04 and lftf5.
General White was committed to Jack
son prison yesterday to begin the ten
years' :entence imposed on him by Judge
Wiesl, and General Marsh in under bonds
pending the result of an appeal of h
trial, which resulted in conviction, to tho
supreme court.
Both General White and General Marsh
addressed petitions to the governor, ask
ing executive clemency. In his appeal
General Marsh asserts that he was con
victed on the evidence of self-confessed
perjurers, and lays stress upon the fact
that the court denied a continuance of the
case asked for by his attorney when his
principal witness was sick and unable to
be present. General Marsh asserts that
he was forced to trial wholly unprepared
to meet the charges preferred against
him.
In his petition General White assert"
that it was a Kalamazoo military supply
firm which conceived the fraudulent
transaction and persuaded him into enter
ing into the scheme. He nays that the
Kalamazoo company assured him when
he entered the deal, which involved the
sale of a quantity of the state's military
clothing to a fictitious company organized
by the Kalamazoo company and its repur
chase at four times the sale price. It was
perfectly legal. When he became con
vinced that the deal was illegal. White
says he wanted to go to the governor and
explain it to him. but the Kalamazoo com
pany assured him that its standing would
fireclude any investigation being made and
n the event of one being made they would
wholly protect. White then lays stress on
the fact that none of the members of the
firm has been Indicted for Its part of the
transaction. The general declares that he
believes from what he has learned of the
treatment of the transactions by the nf
ficials at Lansing, where he was tried and
convicted, that he can not hope for fair
treatment at their hands, and asks for
executive clemency.
Governor Pingree's announcement of
the pardon says:
'These men entered into a conspiracy
with the Henderson-Ames company, a cor
poration composed of prominent and influ
ential citizens of Kalamazoo to defraud
the state of a large amount of money in
connection with the sale and repurchase of
military clothing. One Kickrstaff. who
was the agent for the Henderson-Ames
company, was, according to his testimony,
active in engineering the fraud. The cir
cuit judge and the prosecuting attorney
of Ingham county, who had control of the
proceedings before the grand jury, madr?
no effort to have the grand jury bring all
the guilty parties to Justice, but permitted
the seven members ot the Henderson
Ames company and their agent, liicker
staff. to go frpe.
"This ineffectual and one-sided justice
in n4 consistent with my ideas of right
and wrong and has h.nd great weight in
determining my action in tlie.se cases. Res,
titution has been made to the state by
the Henderson-Ames company and Marsh
and White, and the armiunt which the
state lost by the original transaction has
been returned with interest. Restitution
having been made, my impulse is to place
all the guilty on the same footing and I
thereby grant William L. White and Ar
thur K. Marsh a pardon upon their paving
into the treasury of Ingham county 5,0uo
each." w

legislature.
The proposed law Is modeled from th-i
Illinois law which provides civil Kei vi. 1
for municipal governments. The law w'H
be broadened in fume of its provision",
but the principle therein contained will
be made applicable to the stiite chmit i
ble institutions
The promised new liivv will contain thn
following Important provisions:
Politics shiill not be considered In tlr
selection of employes and olliceis for tlm
Etate institutions

or scientilic bi'anrh''s, as the cane rn;iy
demand, will be hi id to determine tin

ality and sobriety

the Kansas law.
It has been charged that the jsal of
the Republicans, to establish the civil
service custom is for the purpose of
making permanent the present Kepublt

regulations applicable to the state Insti
tutions immediately after the passage
of the law which will then open all th;
places In these Institution to competi
tion by examination.

cause those persons now holding plai " S

fail to make the average to be rerpiire-l.
they will be displaced a nd t he a pplica in
