THE GIRL
WHO
ELOCUTES
TWO DIFFERENT TYPES.
SOMETHING ABOUT THE
MAIDEN WHOSE HISTRI
ONIC EFFORTS ARE A JOY
AND PLEASURE TO HER
FRIENDS— ALSO A LITTLE
CONCERNING THAT OTHER
ONE WHO, THINKS SHE
POSSESSES TALENT BTJT
PROVES AN AWFUL BORE.
BE ONE, NOT THE OTHER.
DO you happen to know her? If not,
you may consider yourself fortu
tunate Indeed. Lives there a man
with soul so dead that he really-'
enjoys hearing the amateur elocu- ,
tlon of a schoolgirl? It is said that "love
is blind," and so, alas, arc the mothers
and relatives of embryo, would-be elocu
tionists of the feminine persuasion.
Oh, girls, why will you do it? :
Are there not other arts which -would be
lees obtrusive and harm no one- hut your
selves? ■"•■■:■ ■ ' ■..' -
Could you not take up a fad of some
kind— something -which would not of nec
essity have-to be inflicted upon along-
Buffering public— golf, tennis, Greek."any«
thing rather than this absurd ranting and
rolling of eyes and wringing of hands
which makes your audience feel ashamed
for you. and which no one under the blue
sky cares for except your poor, love
blinded maternal ancestor, and perhaps,
by chance, the paternal also?
Not one girl In a thousand has any real
talent for elocution, and yet It seems to us
that about half of the girls nowadays
are laboring under the fatal delusion that
they have marked talent in that direction.
We have in mind just now the one girl in
a thousand who has the "real thing"—
genuine talent— "all wool and a yard
wide," and we have also in mind one of
those deluded ones who are chasing the
Ignus fatuus of the counterfeit.
• The former is a sweetly pretty girl, who,
when she addresses an audience, does bo
la such a sweet and unaffected manner
THE SUNDAY CALL.
that one's sympathies go out to her at
once, and she hua only spoken a few
words when the audience is en rapport
with her. It ia not bo much what she
Bays, as how she says it. For instance,
If she Is going to say: "Waiter, bring me
a sandwich," she says it, and does not
yell like a raving maniac, supplicating
some unseen demon and fairly tearing her
hair out by the roots in her frenzy. No!
the girl with the genuine article makes
Her request In such a natural and winning
way that the people are moved, and feel
like Roln~ en masse to grant her request.
If she Hnys "This ia killing me," her
tone is «o genuinely full of sorrow that It
needs no tearing of hnlr and facial gym
nastics to prove It to them. They believe
It, nnd genuine tears are streaming from
their eyes; for she made it ronl, and did
not weaken the effect by clawing atten
tion to the fact that the diamond in the
ring on the middle finger of her left hand
la not a genuine one, and that when she
leans forward her waist twists In a way
which shows that her dressmaker also
is an amateur, and is not up. to dato in
her manner of clothing "tho human form
divine."
When girl No. 1 says anything funny it
seems to have sprung spontaneously from
the impulsive humor of a girl's fresh
heart, and does not seem at all seconU
hand. You are not painfully Impressed
with the fact that this la the place to
laugh, and you must do it if it chokes
you to death, because the watchful eyes
of the girl's mother are fixed upon you
and she knows that this is .ae proper
place to laugh, so you can't elective her
for one moment. She Is Buch a der>r
friend of yours, nnd It takes so little to
please her, so, Wiilfa you watch h>r
enRer fnce and see her lips moving in
unison with every word her daughter in
saying you take the cue, and -guided by
the mother's face you laugh at the prop
er moment, or rather, you do not laugh,
but go through n process which is n crosa
between a hiccough and n yell, and for
which you loathe yourself ever after, and
ho the day is paved, and the mother 13
still your friend. . iV.-A, •',
Girl No. 1 might say exactly the same
thing and you could not restrain yourself
—you would roar, you would fulrly howl,
wime your sides would ache and the tears ;
would roll down your cheeks and you
would npplnud and try to bring her back
until your hands were fairly blistered,"
and yet— ycu had heard girl No. 2 recito
that Eelf-same thing and you had no In
clination to laugh.
When girl No. 1 has said, "I am not
mad, but soon will be,", your very heart
went, out to the poor creature and you
believed it was really, true, and you cried »
until you were ashamed of yourself and
made furtive dabs at. your nose and
thought of the time wasted in '-putting "
cold cream and powder on the aforesaid
organ in order to look nice. What did it
matter whether you looked nice or not?
Looked nice, indeed! and that poor, sweet
thing there before you,, actually going
mad— MAD! Ohi it was horrible! Your
very soul^was convulsed- with agony. Sho
so young and beautiful,' too, and yet— her
unaffected tone had carried such convic
tion with it that believe it you must.
A few weeks later you happened to be
at a "missionary tea" where the other
young female with elocutionary impedi
nients was to shine forth.
\ After the heathen had been fully dis
cussed, and 11 cents had been collected
for the support of "little Rose," a heath
en in a heathen land, and sister N
had read, the- "minutes" (they seemed
more like- hours) and weak, lemonade and
sponge cake had been passed around, the
"passer" /ailing all over herself in order
to hurry by the good old "sister" who
always took two pieces— after all these
things- had been done and the heathen
duly commiserated for not coming: at
once en masse to our country and get
ting hold of our one exclusive form of
religion as fast as they could, then^ in
deed, came THE moment of all the meet
ing:. ■• ' .. • ■ . " -
The heathen were, "not In it" when
Sophronisby paced the boards. "There
was racing and. chasing on Cannnbie
Lea" when Sophia, with majestic mien
. and stately pride, condescended to amble'
out and place herself in front of the
portieres (portieres always' looked tragic,
she thought, there was always a chance
of some one being concealed behind them
witha- dagger, "don't you know")."
■ Well, it chanced that No. 2 had
made the same selection , as the one
tflth; which No. 1 girl had con
verted you into a perfect Niobe, but
evca though you. could plainly see her
inother working her lips a.nd searching
vainly in' the back breadth of .her skirt
for a handkerchief— even that did not
move you from your stoical indifference.
When she frantically pulled the trump
from her sleeve and yelled In a voice
which sounded like Finnegan in the pho
nograph, "1 am not mad, but soon will
be." all sorts of ridiculous answers filled
your mind, and you felt like saying,
"Bet your life, old girl," and instead of
putiing your handkerchief up to mop the
coptous tears, you put it up to hide the
idiotic grin which you felt was gradually
spreading from ear to ear. It seems to
you that you never were possessed of
such un insane desire to laugh, and you
know by watching the thermomctrlcal
expression of the mother's face that a
laugh at ihls juncture would be "the last
strlftv."
Oh, girls, girls, GIRLS! If you are cher
ishing illusions to the effect that you are
embryo geniuses In the elocutionary line,
go, I beg of you, and be phrenologized,
or— or chloroformed, or anything, In fact,
except to grow up retaining the illusion
and Inflicting it upon patient and well
meaning people, who might othervviso
have been your friends. ";'
To all such girls I would give tho ad
vice usually given to thoso about to
marry— -• > .
