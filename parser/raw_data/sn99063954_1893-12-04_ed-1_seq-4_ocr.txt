Marlon County Democrat, was work
ing in the pressroom of the Capital
Printing Co., ho had his right arm
caught in the delivery shafts of a cylin

the bones were broken twice below the
elbow, audit is thought once above.
The limb was severely lacerated and
the accident Is a very great misfortune

that he may soon be fully recovered,
and that his suffering may be as light
as possible.

the edgo of aud across au extensive
cedar swamp to the foothills beyond.
In some places the child's footsteps

succeed In reaching her home.

Hard Luck. Editor Flagg is in
hard luck. With a new-born Demo
cratic daily on his hands aud his good
right arm broken so that labor will be
out of the question, he is entitled to a
generous measure of sysmpatby. His
condltiou should move the heart of the
administration he has so loyally sup
ported, and every Democrat in Salem
should rally heartily and unitedly to
Bro. Flagg's support in his hour of
trouble. In hard luck Is tbe time when
a man's friends should show them
selves. Whatever controversies The
Journal has had with the Democratic
editor, he is entitled to cordial and
friendly sympathy just now if ever a
inuu was.

A Cutter to Hawaii.
Washington, Dec. 4. Gresham de
clined this morning to talk in re
gard to the published report that tbe
revenue cutter Corwlu was to carry a
message for tbe state department from
San Francisco to Hawaii. Gresham
was busy yesterday with dispatches
which are to go on the Corwin. What
these contain, nothing can be learned.
The fact of dispatching the Corwin so
hastily leads to the surmise that tbe ad
ministration has changed its policy
towards tbe islands.
Opinions on the Massage.
Wahhinqton, Dec. 4. There seems
to be a geuerai air of disappointment
that so little space was alloted to the
Hawalin questiou in the message. The
recommendations relative to a Interna
tional Monetary conference and tbe re
qnest for further authority for issue of
bonds caused many significant shakes
of the head on part of extreme silver
men. The President's bold endorse
ment of the pension policy of the In
terior department, of Civil Seryice Re
form and bis appeal for right economy
in appropriation also attracted atten
tion. Protects the Tramps.
Topeka, Kas., Dec. 4. Gov. Llewel
ling this ufternoon uddressed a circu
lar to all boards of Metropolitan Police
commissioners. The circular, after
picturing tbe distress existing in the
United States aud Europe, orders po
lice gdards to arrest no trumps on
charges usually brought agaiust this
class.
The City Election.
There is an unusual interest shown'
in some of tbe wards. The streets are
crowded around the polling places.
In the first ward Gray and Duncan
are running a close race. It is said the
Corwin church light is being used
against Duncan some, as well as tbe
saloon vote.
In the third ward there Is no contest,
as the Republicans outnumber the
Democrats four to one. Kav eroes In
by a big vote.
In the fourth ward Hughes aud Al
bert are making a hot fight. At 3 p.
uj. 259 votes bad been polled and Chair
man Smith, who was on thu ground,
claimed Republican victory.
Iu tbe second ward 300 votes were in
by 3:30 and Holuian away ahead.
It looks like a Republican clean
sweep.
