The President's Message.
j But a partial synopsis of the message
is received ms we go to press. If not too
Jontt we will give it next week.
Belief for Soldiers' Families.
' Mcssrt. EJUon: Permit me through
your paper to state a few facts, with refer
ence to the County Relief Fund of this Co.
There are those who, either wilfully, or
through ignorance, grossly misrepresent
the design, amounts and power of the
County Commissioners to grant relief
from this Fund ; thereby causing much
trouble to the soldiers' families, and thoee
who have to disburse the money. The
Legislature of 1860-61 passed an act au
thorising a levy for this object, of one-half
mill on thn dnllnr nf ell iha faveKla
erty of any county in the State, by the
County Commissioners thereof. The
Commissioners of this County, anticipa
ting the authority thus given, (and from
the pressing necessities and demands of
the families of volunteers for relief,) bor
rowed from the County General Fund,
and commenced disbursing even before
the above act became a law. The levy of
the one-half mill raised about five thou
sand and seven hundred dollars ; this
amount was paid out to these families,
long before it was collected from the tax-
duplioate, and the Commissioners found
themselves entering another long, cold
winter with our three hundred soldiers'
families upon their hands, expecting and
demanding assistance, with no relief mon
ey In the Treasury. Hoping, however.
that the Legislature would again relieve
them, they borrowed from the Connty
General Fund as before, and have contin
ued their disbursements to the present
time, except a few months in the summer
that is just past. The Legislature au
thorizedalevy of six-tenths of a mill, which
will raise a fund of a little over six thou
and dollars when the present tax-dupli
cate is collected ; but the Commissioners
have already borrowed and paid out over
4,000 dollars of this amount, leaving
but about two thonsand dollars to be dis
bursed to nearly four hundred families,
consisting from one to ten members each.
It requires no intricate calculation to
demonstrate that this sum, though doled
put never so me.inly, will not last half the
coming winter. Says one, "borrow as be
fore from the Connty General Fund."
This cannot now te done, as that Fund
- has just furnished twenty thousand dol
lars to pay the bounties to soldiers, offer
ed by the County, and is now so exhaust.

for any purpose, except the one for which

pose these objections do exist ; does it ex
cuse any one for withholding from them
the necessaries of life ? for steeling his
heart to the wants of the families of the
men who are now protecting him in the
enjoyment of his quiet home, and the
very property of which they now ask but
a pittance. The necessaries of life are
very dear now ; fife dollars will not buy
any more than three would a few months
since, yet the soldier gets no more pay
than he did then. How it must wilt the
courage and stifle the patriotism of the
soldier to learn that his family is neglected
and suffering at home, and he by the
tern fates of war deprived of ministering
to their wants.

and they should be made to feel that
they are not onlr sustained by the pray
ers and well wishes of their friends at
home, but by "the more substantials . of
this life, such as food and clothing, to
'their families. Suppose you were starv
ing, and your neighbor had plenty, would
you thank him to pray night and morn
ing that you might be fed, and yet refuse
to feed you. Impious are the prayers of
him who will not answer them himself,
when in his power so to do; let us look at
this matter practically. What are our
homes and property worth if this Govern
ment is not sustained, and its authority
re-instated? We of the Free States do
sot begin to feel the horrors of this war,
we are pursuing our various avocations in
comparative quiet. Why are we thus se
cure and peaceful ? Because the soldier
has driven the invader from our soil, and
is now bearding the lion in his den, and
are we under no obligations to him, for
thus protecting our lives and property,
except the thirteen dollars per month,
and clothing allowed by the Government?
Legally we may not be, Imt morally we
are bound to sustain him, and his family,
for thus jeopardizing his life for the gen
eral good. Let each .township organize
itself at once, and prepare to take care of
these families within its limits. Let each
neighborhood have its wood-bees, and
supply them with their winter's wood.
Let each family be visited at least once
month, and supplied with what they are
needing, and if there is one (who has an
abundance of this world's goods,) that
will not give to this object, I care not
what may be his excuses, even though he
may consider it unconstitutional, may the
ghouls of secessioni-ts and traitors haunt
his stingy soul, until he shall discharge
his full duty to these families. Let each
one then interest him or herself on this
subject, and it will become a pleasure,
rather than burden, thus to contribute.
And when the chuigor of arras shall have
ceased, and the roar and dire of battle,
shall have passed away. you may welcome
to his quiet home the cire worn and bat

have erred in this distribution, we have

From Burrow's Battery.
Jackson, Tenn., Nov. 21.
Dear Chronicle: Since my last letter
nothing has occurred to vary the same
ness of camp life. We have gone into
"Winter Quarters" and that the winter
may be passed as comfortably as possible,
the Battery has erected eight log cabins
and two domicils of slabs in which all
are well housed. These habitations are
chinked and daubed in the most approved
rustic style, and fitted up as they are,
with bunks and conveniences for fire, are
a most efficient protection against the
coming wintry blast.
At evening these pioneer dwellings
resound with laugh, jest and song till the
inevitable "Taos" sounded bv "Nate" or
"Chapman," both men of original and
peculiar genius, tells the time for retiring,
when, to quote from "Battery Orders"
lights must be put out and the camp in a
state of repose.
Daring our fifteen months service the
Battery has been favored by two Picnics
by the ladies of Champion and Bristol,
received before leaving Camp Wade. A
munificient donation of goods and pro
visions valued at seventy-five dollars from
the Cleveland Aid Society, presented by
their agents Mr. Cory and Mrs. Noble,
whose courtesy made the gift doubly
welcome, reached us shortly after the bat
tle of Shiloh, together with a box of pro
visions from the ladies of Austinburg. As
these things were given to us while "still
in the wilderness" before Corinth when,
the Commissary stores consisted only o
hard crackers, bacon and beans, you may
be sure thev were as "a feast of fat
things."
For all these tokens of remembrance
I made due acknowledgments through the
Chronicle, but never have seen any copies
of the paper containing them, do not
know whether they everreached you, and
hence give them a brief mention again
The above remarks were suggested by
the recent reception of two boxes of pro
visions sent by the Warren Aid Society
last August, which have finally reached us
after three months of wandering and de
lay. One box, by some mistake was sent
on to Bolivar and has not yet returned.
With the exception of two cans of berries
every thing was well preserved. For
these gifts mentioned below we would
return thanks to the following ladies: '
Honey and Cherries Mrs. Stnll
Molasses and Butter (extra) "
1 Gallon Elderbery Wine " Harmon
Dried Meat and Fish " Douglass
Dried Peaches
Catsup and Syrup
Dried Currents
3 Kegs Catsup
Onions
Parks
King
" Harsh
Aid Society
Miss Cellaneous
The articles were very timely and all
will testify most acceptable. . We can as
sure the Secretary of the Society that the
evidence of feeling alluded to when that
Catsup was made is duly appreciated. As
your old correspondent "Artillerist" has
been spoken to about giving thanks I may
safely leave the work of laudation to him
and regret that but one young lady fig
ures on the list to inspire muse.
Elevation in rank having ever been the
official recognition of military nieritb, I
am glad to notice the promotion of Cor
porals Parker and Wright to the post of
Sergeants and also of privates McCord and
Haynes to the promotion of Corporals.
They have been perfect patterns of the
faithful soldier and it is universally con
ceded that a more fitting and acceptable
selection could not have been made. The
result of the election was generally-un-looked
for, and had a dispiriting effect for
a tune provoking a great deal of con
temptuous and angry comment. Had
the soldiers had the privilege of voting
not a single scurvied peace man would
have been lifted out of his proper obscu
rity. Though there may be a sprinkling
of peace Democrats in the army, I have
yet to meet with one, even of that kind,
who does not indignantly deny that he
has any affilation with Vallandingham
or his school, which seems to be almost
too low for contempt.
Taking into view the lack of moral
stamina exhibited by the Republicans in
the defeated. States in not making an
issue in favor of those progressive prin
ciples to whose advocacy the party owe
its existence and vitality, their following
in the blind leadership of exhumed po
litical fossils, this temporary repulse can
hardly be looked upon in any other light
than as a just judgment upon their folly.
It is but a tidal wave in the ebb flow of
the political sea. In effect it will be but
an application of the brakes of foav
to check the ou rushing of the train of
Progression, or, at most, its turning aside
upon a conservative switch. It will avail
little, the momentum may be impeded
but not fully checked, for the track still
bears onward and southward and from
New "Years, that dvy of blessed promis
the people will chant the glorious refrain,
"llo! the ear Emancipation
Rides majestio through the nation.
.Bearing on its train toe story
Liberty's a nations (lory."
Our "peace men at any price" will then
see that they have played as vain a part as
so many mules in a Ferry Boat, not to
mention other long-eared relatives who
brace their feet and pull back while the
Boat moves majestically on. Doubtless
Yandalscamp, remembering his ignomin
ious reception at the hands of Ohio troops
will continue to vex the souls of good
men by an increased assurance in his
asinine utterances, but the dog has had
his day and will soon give way to a better
m in. UU compeers will follow iu due
time. Following his example they may
shake their lion's skin and brag vigorous
ly but the ears will betray them.
This place has been made a great ship,
ping point for cotton, and several thou
sand bales have been sent from here to
the North. It is now in the midst of the
"cotton picking" season, and every day
it is being brought in by the quantity
from a distance of fifty miles in many
cases. Great fortunes have been and are
till being made by dealers in this article,
who are Jews to a very great extent.
Somehow these eagle beaked Israelites
have a remarkable success in insinuating
themselves into the sunshine of official
favor and monopolizing the places of prof-
I have yet to meet with a Jew in the
ranks or in any place of danger. Their
retreat to the rear is a sure indication of
"breakers ahead," and their flight is very
precipitate. Though they do not stop to
make adieus, they always make sure of
their "monish." While these hale, able
bodied harpies are reaping a golden har
vest our own gallant braves who have
been maimed by wounds, or disabled by
disease, can often only obtain some de
tailed position in the service as hospital
nurse or assistant, ambulance driver, or
tome petty post, at twenty-five cents ex
tra pay per day, or perhaps the privilege
of peddling apples, papers, pies or station
ery. How long must this imposition be
borne?
Some of our most prominent officers
with an eye to the main chance have dab
bled extensively in the cotton traffic.
The head of the Military Department of
Arkansas is said to have made the enor

Uf the military movements below us
we hear but little, though there is a uni

only awaits the movement southward of
the western army, whose prestige will ren

assailed simultaneously, as it doubtless
will be, above and below on the river and
in the rear by land, will be in our posses
sion by Christmas. It will, I trust, be
razed to the ground.
A like fate should be visited upon Rich
mond and Charleston, our American So
dom and Gomorrah. They should be sub
jected to a fiery rain of bomb, shot ami
shell, and like the fire from heaven which
overwhelmed their ancient prototypes,
the cities of the plain, so these two un
godly resting places of treason should be
blotted from the earth they have so long
disgraced. For this result let all good
men pray and traitors gnash their teeth
and wail.
Too long have the energies of the na
tion been criminally wasted and thrown
away in a vain endeavor to conquer reb
els without striking at the cause of the
rebellion. No sooner has a General achiev
ed brilliant success than he was at once
removed from command or assigned some
other field of labor, but in spite of this
official disfavor, the army has never lost
faith in its chosen, leaders Fremont, Sigel,
Mitchell or Pope. Their presence by a
return to their old commands, would be
bailed as a sure harbinger of triumph and
would awaken a perfect furor of accla
mation. This is an enticing theme on which I
would like to dwell, but my letter has al
ready exceeded its limits, so easy does it
become to multiply words, and I will wait
till another opportunity offers to give vent
to ideas which might render this commu
nication tedious if written now. And so

Letter From Capt. Barrett—the 6th
Ohio Cavalry.
CHANTILLY, Nov. 28, 1862.
Dear Chronicle. It is the close of a dull
dreary Sabbath, with the Cth O. V. C
uur camp situated on the western edge
of a tract of woodland, exposes us to the
fury of the wind which comes howling
down from the Blue Ridge as though it
were in league with Stuart, or Stonewall,
to drive us from the State.
Since I last wrote we have been ranging
far and wide through this section of the
State. After lying in camp at Centerville
till we began to despair of ever moving
again, an advance movemant was made.
We took the lead down the Orange and
Alexandria R. R. driving in the rebel
pickets and patrols,, and scouting and
picketing on the front and flanks, day
and night. Thus passed the time till we
reached Warrenton Junction, when we
received an order from Gen. D. E. Sickles,
under whose command we were, compli
menting us for our vigilance and daring,
and expressing a desire that we should
have a short time rest, and truly we need
ed it. For seven days and nights we had
been almost constantly in the saddle, and
many of us had slept none at all for three
consecutive nights. J ust as we were about
to go into camp congratulating ourselves
on the prospect of a good nights rest, up
came Gen. Sigel's Body Guard, fresh horses
and fresh men, with an order for us to ac.
company them on an expedition we knew
not where. There was no alternative.
"Ours not to reason why."
We went but there were curses loud
and deep. All night long we sped away
through the pine forests of eastern Vir
ginia. 1 he night was black as Erebus, its
darkness relieved only by the falling
snow which whitened the narrow fields
over which we occasionally passed.
Toward morning we learned that our
destination was Fredericksburg. We in
tended to reach it by daylight, but through
the drunkenness, or incompetency of our
guide, we did not reach our destination
till two hours later.
We found the tide up and the water
fire - feet deep on the usual ford. We
were ordered back from the river to await
the falling of the tide, but the guide dis.
covered a narrow and difficult nassape
higher up. Supposing that there were
but sixty of the enemy across the river,
the body guard slipped off privately, tak
ing with them come ten of our men who
had been left to guard the ford, and made
a dash into town. Soon a party of them
came back reporting that the enemy were
six hundred strong, and that the body
guard had been all killed or taken pu'so
ners. They advised us to leave if we wished
to avoid capture, and three or four of
them, including a Lieutenaut and Sur
geon ingloriously skedaddled, reaching
camp a day before us, and reporting that
we were all taken.
Though we numbered but sixty men,
Major Steadman refused to withdraw, hop
ing to save some who might yet straggle
off and escape. Soon we had the satisfac
tion of seeing our friends return and cov
ering their retreat across the river. They
had had a desperate encounter. The en
emy were some four or fire hundred
strong, but not daunted by their num
ber, our boys charged and drove in all di
rections. They captured some thirty or
forty prisoners and two carts laden with
uniform cloth for the rebel army.
Our lost was one killed, and three or
four prisoners, but we left eight or ten
dead rebels in the streets of the city.
When the body guard came back, we
learned for the first time that orders had
been sent for us to cross and assist them. '
It may have been so, but certain it i that
no one could be found who had brought
any such message.
I notice that a one sided account of the
affair has been published in the X. Y. Tri
bune, and that some blame is thrown up
on the 6th, for neglecting to obey orders.
Had any such order reached us, or any in
timation thnt is were wanted, we would
not have been slow in haatening "to the
rescue.
The truth of the matter is, that the
Guard expected to find a small force to
oppose them, and finding more than they
bargained for, they sought to escape cen
sure for their rashnes and to set their
bravery in a stronger light by claiming
that we refused to assist them. They did
a gallant deed, but their injustice lower
ed them much in our estimation.
Since then we have been scouting along
the eastern base of the Blue Ridge and
Bull Run Mountain?, and are now with
Sigel. near Centerville, waiting to defend
Washington, should the rebels venture to
make an attack in the absence of our
main army.
Yours Truly,
N. A. BARRETT.
Letter from Col. Hall.
The following letter from Col. Hall was
not intended tor publication. It was
written to F. P. Green, of North Bloom

Hall have been afloat, as an act of justice
to him, and his regiment, the gallant

Headquarters 33d Brigade, )
Muxfordsville, Kt.,Nov.5,'G2. J
Dear Sir: I have delayed writing to
you for a long time solely for the want of
an opportunity. It has become apparent
to you, no doubt, before this, that neither
myself or my regiment has bad much
leisure since we left Cleveland so sudden
and unexpectedly. From the letters I
am receiving I am inclined to believe
that the people at home have been most
fully, if not truthfully, informed of our
doings, treatment, sufferings and general
condition. I propose iu this letter to
speak of the lies that have been told, but
briefly, trusting as I do that with the in
telligent and good they will work their
own correction. It is not to be disguised
that I am annoyed by their stories, not
on my own account, but for my dear wife,
who thought she suffered enough in the
fact of my absence alone. She writes me
that there are, at home, meu who claim
to have been taken prisoners and paroled
on the retreat from Lexington, telling the
most horrible stories of my cruelties to
my men, and making the most alarming
statements of their individual suffering.
I propose to speak of these men, and
wish first to say, that I had really gallant
men who were taken prisoners in Lexiug
ton being then in Hospital. These sto
ries have not come from them. On the
25th of August we arrived at Lexington
by railroad and lay in Camp 3 miles south
on the Nicholasville pike till the night of
August 30th, when we were ordered to
march immediately, by forced march to
the relief of our forces at Richmond, 26
miles east of that city. We marched 14
miles to the KentuckyaRiver by daylight,
learned that our forces were all captured,
and then formed in line of battle to
prevent the enemy from crossing. We
stood to arms till 3 P. M.t when we were
ordered to cover the rear, on the march
back to Lexington. When we faced for
Lexington the enemy advanced. We
reached Lexington late in the night, and
by a personal visit to Generals Gilbert and
Wright I succeeded in getting my writ
ten orders so changed as to take my regi
ment off from picket that night, (a very
rainy one) and sheltered it in a market
in the city.
At 8 o'clock the next morning I was or
derered out on the Nicholasville pike, to
protect the city, till the Quarter Master's
stores could be moved and the town evac
uated. On the Richmond road skirmish
ing took place all that day and the 94th
Ohio lost some 50 men, the enemy was
pursuing as fast aa they could, and threw
a force of cavalry around to the north of
Lexington to get between us. and Ver
sailles. All that afternoon the evacuation
was going on, and the last regiment or-
dered to leave was, mine and we passed
through the city at eight P. M., and
marched all night, covering the rear.-
There was an immense train in the col
umn, a large drove of mules, and horses,
very deep dust and great lack of water,
as it had nat rained west of Lexington to
any extent. Every man in the command
knew of the Richmond defeat, knew that
we were retreating from an advancing enemy
flushed with a great victory, the or
ders given us were of the strictest charac
ter to permit no straggling or falling to
their rear, as all such would be captured
by the enemy. To effect the execution
of this order a heavy rear-guard was or
dered to bring up all stragglers, the Sur
geons and commanding officer of each
regiment, and company, marched in rear
of their respective commands. The men
were notified of the danger, of the orders,
and directed not to leave their companies
without the permission of the Capt. and
the Captain's we directed to give every
fatigued or sick man a written leave to
fall behind, till the Surgeon came up; the
Surgeons examined every man so report
ed, or who fell back in sight of the col
umn, and if he need to be carried, teams
were ordered to be pressed to carry them
all. And this was done without excep
tion, for every man who reported to the
Surgeon as be waa ordered. Not one of
them was left behind. But there were
those who knew if they could hide from
the Rear Guard, they could be taken pris
oner! i n a tew liours. be paroled and go
home, and some 20 men of the Regiment
in the night inarches, hid away in this
manner, and deserted ns. Deserted us
too, when it' was expected every day,
that a fight would take place. Gone
home in stinging disgrace, these cowarJt
and tlinkt, have sought to cover their dis
honor by lying about their officers. This
march was a hard one, one of the hardest
known to this rebellion, it was conducted
and ordered by three Generals, Gilbert,
Jackson, and Terrill, and I brought up the
rear, no pleasant task, but one that had
to be performed at all hazards, with Sur
geons at either hand, I made every man
march whom they said waa able to march,
and transported every man they decided
o need it.
Many a man came back to that rear
guard who said, be could go no further,
but when toe Surgeons said, "ha trivet no
Hul.i,ri,... i

el on, and kept my transportation for
-
those who needed it. This was the un.
pleasant duty of nu officer charged to
"bring up the rear." Not an officer of my
command but walked, with myself, ma
ny and tunny a mile, to give our horses
to those who were in a condition to need
them. Day after day and niiiht after
night we marched thus in the sight of the
enemy, and by the most exhausting labors
that were evtr upon me, at the end of 4
days and five nights marching, we reach
ed Louisville, and not one man was gone
who had obeyed orders and reported him
self at the rear where he could be provi
ded for. Can it be possible that men who
thus deserted their gaPaut comrades can
be able to injure those who labored to pro
tect them ? Friend Green," large boun
ties got some cowards to enlist, some men
who never intended to do the duties of a
soldier, some who have boasted in their
companies that they intended to le taken
prisoners and go home; with the bounty
and pay. When the advance was order
ed Oct., 1st there was another sifting the
white liver and fear of bullets, again made
its appearance, and some were sick from
that cause alone. We left them' behind.

who were really or permanently dis
abled. But it was the clear stuff, the
genuine soldiers wno were leic in me
ranks, no man fell out, or desired to, on
the march towards the enemy, there was
no need of a rear guard, and not a soldier
left his place on any pretense unless order
ed, and their conduct at the bloody sac
rifice of Perryville evinced the true metal
of which they are composed.
In all this rebellion no 600 men have
stood such a shock, maintained such or
der, and acquitted themselves with more
honor, than the 600, of the 105th, at Per
ryville. The regiment & entitled to a na.
tion's plaudits, and would have had the
most flattering announcement of gallant
ry, but for the pro-slavery newspapers
near us, who desired to advance their own
friends, and had resolved that no regi
ment should receive praise at their hands.
if it refused fo deliver up fugitive slaves.
Dear sir, had it not been known in Ken.
tuckv. that the Slave hunter could not
pass the lines of the 105th Ohio, the Lou
isville papers would have borne Northward
such an especial notice of my regiment as
would have gone far to soothe the sorrows
which our losses inflicted, as it is they
content themselves with the single sen
tence, "the 105th and 98th Ohio conduct
ed themselves with great coolness."
care nothing for myself, I did not come
into this servive for promotion, but my
gallant men, who faced death, and obey
ed orders amidst the most terrible car-
nage.of war's bloodiest bou-, deserve more
than this passing notice. By the suffer
ings of the Lexington march, and the
bloody memoirs of rerryville, my heart is
bound up with the interests of that gal
Iant band, and it crushes my spirit to see
that praise witheld from them, after they
have won it at such costly sacrifice.
The death of Generals Jackson and
Terrill, left me in command of the 10th
Division, from which I was relieved on
the 18th and ordered to the command of
the 34d Brigade, 1 left Crab Orchard, on
that date and rejoined my brigade which
I had left at Danville, on the 19th I was
ordered by forced march 28 miles to Leb
anon, made it in 18 hours, and on the
21st, I was ordered here via Sommerville,
by forced march, all this to keep Morgan
from these points. But the 105th can
march now, no regiment can excel it, they
have learned the secret, having made
nothing but forced marches since we en
tered the service.
They have to day as many men as most
of the new regiments, who have never
seen a fight, or marched three days in suc
cession. Tell the old patriots at home, to
kick the cowards who have deserted us,
and suspend judgement on us till those
who enlisted to fight, are heard from.
My brigade consits of the 105th, the
123rd and 80th, Illinois, the 101st, Indi
ana, and the 19th Indiana Battery. I am
commanding this Post, the most import

Escape.
J
On Thursday morning, about 11 o'clock
a colored boy named Charles Brown, about
14 years old, employed at ttie Angler
House, was sitting on the bannister in
the fourth story of the hotel, swingiug
his teet. JJy some means he over bal
anced himself and fell backwards, falling
headforemost down the well of the circu
lar stairs. distance of fifty feet. He
touched the corner of a step once in his
descent, and on nearly reaching the bot
tom struck the back of his head against
the corner of another step. At the bot
tom of the stairs, on the ground lloor, is
a table where candlesticks are laced in
the evening. Ou this table the boy fell,
striking full on the top of his head, and
bounding off to the floor, where lie lay on
his face. Mr.' Bedell picked the boy up
and placed him on a chair, the blood flow
ing in a stream over his face and neck,
and spirting out against the wall behind
him. A bystander remarked that the
boy's neck was probably broken, at which
he put his hand up to his neck, and cool
ly remarked, "I can't soe it." Then, to
the astonishment of every one, tho boy
got up, walked off, washed his face and
head, and went about his work as if noth
ing had happened. To-day he is going
about just as well as ever, with the ex
ception of a slight cut on the back of bis
head.
Brown is a remarkable lad. ' He is a na
tive of this city, and when he 14th Bat
tery went South he went with them as a
servant to Lieutenant Smith. He was at
the Battle of Pittsburgh Landing, and re
mained in attendance on his master dur
ing that light, as unmoved es if only on a
dress parade. He came back from the
South a short time since and has been in
the Angier about two weeks. He says
that coming down stairs at such a very
rapid "double quick," and marking time
with his head on the steps, will do for
once.butit is hardly the thing to practice
veryoften. Clev. Herald.

WAR NEWS.
SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Nov. 29.
Gen. Blunt with 5.000 Federals attack
ed and routed about 8,000 rebels under
Oen. Marmttduke, at Cane Hill, Ark., on
the 20th, killing bO, and driving the bal
ance some 12 miles.
Gen. Blunt telegraphs that the enemy
is badlgy whipped, and will not probably
venture north of Boston Mountains again
this wiuter, and as they have consumed
all the subsistence in the valley of the
Arkansas, they must soon retreat into
FORT ROYAL.
Advices from Port Royal give an ac
count of an expedition by the colored
regiment to Doboy Sound. The negroes
behaved very commendably. the expe
dition brought back 200,000 feet of sawed
lumber. Three of the negroes were wound
ed. It is rumored that Beauregard has
pronounced Charleston indefensible, and
the inhabitants are moving their property
Cairo, Nov, 29.
The Grand Army of the South is all in
motion.
Gen. Herman with his forces left Mam-
phis on Wednesday.
Oen. O rant s army struck tents the
dawn of yesterday, and marched off on
the Holly bprings road. Seven days ra
tions were prepared. Unly one tent is
allowed to each twenty men, one to the
officers of each company, and six wagons
to eacli regiment.
1 he rebels are falling back to Grenada,
tearing up the track, carrying off the rails
and burning the bridgesas they retire. It
is reported they are even moving heavier
valuables from Jackson Mississippi.
Prisoners taken confess the utter hope
lessness of their cause in the V est.
A dispatch from Sigel's headquarters
says, Jackson passed through fcalem.

his way to join Lee. No enemy is in

November 30.
Special to the Herald:
Considerable excitement occasioned by
the circulation of a report here, that
proposition has been made by the rebels
for an armistice of 30 days, and that Lee
ivus already iu Washington arranging
terms of the agreement.
The rebels are working with redoubled
vigor ou their fortifications, and their cav
alry of late have been very active, and
have captured a number of our pickets
along the fords of the river, beside the
Z companies of the 4d Pennsylvania cav
alry at liarwood Church.
Lonstreet commands the right, and
Hill the left of the, rebel forces confront
ing us.
Deserters coming within our lines report
that large bodies of their forces have been
detached and sent off, either to Kicn
mond cr to reinforce Stonewall Jackson
These reports must be received with
great caution however.
Our cavalry have captured a number
rebels along the river below this place.
Matters at New Orleans.
Nov. 18.
A owerful squadron was concentrating
in the Mississippi. There were already
more vessels at New Orleans than at any
other time since its capture. A large
number of river boats have been armed.
There is a great activity in military cir
cles preparatory to offensive movements.
A general inspection of arms and men was
about to taken place.
Guerrillas infested the river banks
above and below the city.
One naval vessel has been fired into and
had returned the fire with grape and can
ister, but thick brushwood enabled the
assailants to escape. No vessel unless
well armed now leaves the city.
Gen. Butler is about to place overseers
on confiscated plantations to save the cot
ton and sugar. The new cotton crops
coming in quite freely.
Gen. Butler has permitted the resump
tion of the publication of the National Ad
vocate, after explanations irom jacoo Bar
ker that he had no intention to aid the
relels.

Chastillt, Va., Nov. 307 P. M.
Brig. Gen. Stahl has iust returned. He
attacked the enemy at Snicker's Ferry,
and followed them with 300 cavalry into
their camp on the other side of the river
and near Berryville. Our men charged
splendidly whenever they met the ene
my. White's cavalry was driven in all di
rections, nearly all their officers captured
and their colors taken. White himself
fled and hid in a house in Berryville.
The 3d, 7th and 12th Virginia cavalry
were also attacked and routed. Forty
their men with their horses were taken,
and 50 killed and wounded and two col
ors taken.
One wagon load of pistols and carbines
was picked up on the road, tnrown away
by the flying enemy. Eighty horses and
eighty cattle were also brought in. Our
loss in killed and wounded is about 15.
Gen. Stahl reports that there is a brig

Maj. Gen. Present Prices of Printing Paper.
Are such says the New York Post,
will materially affect the condition of the
American press. If they continue the
newspapers must either raise their prices
or ston altogether. To show how
works, we may say that such of the morn
ing Journals of this city as have a circula
tion daily of fifty thousand copies loses
the recent rise, not less than one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars per year. If
New York daily has a circulation of one
hundred thousand copies, its loss, if paper
continues at present prices, would be
the end of the year not less than three
hundred thousand dollars. Ut course
this would be ruinous to any business en
terprise. No doubt the morning Jour
nals dislike to raise their prices, but they
must do so. unless some change takes
place to bring paper back to its old price.
The t-jieedy opening of the Mississippi
river would probably help us to cot ton,
considerable quantities, but this staple
would be appropriated at once for cloths,
and would effect but little the price
paper for some time to come, we look
more to enterprises by which other and
now unused materials may be brought
the service of the paper maker.
Atlantic and Great Western R. R.
We have already noticed the opening
of this road to a point seven miles beyond
Meadville, in the direction of Akron,
which is expected, will be reached before
the close of the year. The Atlantic and
Grrat Western connects with the New
York and Erie, and is in reality but an
extension of that line. The capital to
build it was furnished by the British bond
holders of the Erie road, in order to ren
der that line independent of the Lake
rout, which is dominated by the New
York Central. The road will shun the
two leading cities of Pennsylvania Pitts
burgh and Erie and is inimical to the
State, Philidelphia, yet it will, perhaps,
benefit Meadville and a few other villages
in Western Pennsylvania, by making
them way station on a great through route
between' New York City and the West,
and it will give an increasd value to all
the land on the line of the road. Phil
adelphia will also be put thereby in more
speedy comumcatiou witn coin, oy ine
Pittsburg and Erie road and the Philadel
phia and Erie, both of which cross the
Atlantic and Great Western the one
near the Ohio border, and the other near
that of New York State. The Pittsburgh
and Erie will be purely a Pennsylvania
road, and of great use to Erie, Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia, as well as to the coun
try traversed by it. Pittsburgh Chronicle.'

In the present day, when, according to
the Roman proverb, the discussion of
legal points should give way to the clash
of arms, it is found that more pettifog-
ging twaddle is talked about theCoustitu-
tion than in the most peacetui era.
Every ardent Breckiuridger, clinging to a
lamp-post on election night, has an in
coherent argument to utter in favor of
letting the "wayward sisters of the na
tional family "keep house for us," on
Constitutional grounds. Every scoundrel,
arrested in the act of betraying his coun
try and justly incarcerated iu a felon s
cell, has a set of wniniug traitors hanging !

liijt '
story of martyrdom to tell to '"butternut"
editors as soon as he gets away from Fort
Lafayette or Fort Warren. Then we have
every petty pop-gun of the daily, weekly
and monthly press pouring forth lies and
misrepresentation about the Administra
tion and the Constitution, on their on
responsibility, nntil we should think the
public would be perfectly disgusted with
such stuff. It ia amazing that there is a
market for such nonsense, but we cannot
deny the fact that many persona who
ought to know better, from the bare fact
that they were born in a land of news
papers and free schools, take it all in,
o oen-mouthed.
Now we venture to assert that no form
of government ever gave such peace, hap
piness and posperity to any nation as the
Constitution has showered upon the
United States. No constitution ever was
more faithfully, mildly and mercifully
administered than ours is, and has been
up to this day. No class of men ever
came so near having all their rights as
the rebels against the American Union.
Under no form of law since the Hebrews
has justice ever held equal poise between
man and man, and no government could
have been more mild and paternal for a
year and a half of rebellion than has ours.
2s ow there is not a rebel-sympathizer,
traitor, hypocrite or peace-coward in the
loyal States, but who knows these facts as
wellaswedo. When Democracy held the
Federal purse-strings all these trairors,
cowards, hypocrites, 4c, exulted in these
facts. They shook them like metaphorical
fists in the face of England and all des
potic nations. They never made a stump
speecu witnout beating the same con
stitutional drum and playing that identi
cal constitutional Ufe; and they have only
changed their tune, because they must
have, aa D'Israeli says, a war-cry, to help
inem -pui uown tue f ederal uovern
ment." Plainly and simply they "gam
mon" their deluded followers, about the
Constitution, just as Joe Smith, the Mor
mon, "gammoned" those who founded the
town ot JNauvoo. Their trade is deceit.
just like other gamblers, ohii-latans and
bogus philanthropists, and the crop of
dupes ready to be trifled with by them as
wide as the area of the loyal States and
as innocent of common sense as the flics
that batter their heads for a whole day
against a window pane without ever find
ing that they cannot get through the
glass.
It is truly pitiful to see how many there
are who deliberately ignore the holy jus
tification of the war for the Union, and
waver in their allegiance to the banner
which symbolizes everything that is no
ble. A nation is solemnly offering up
scores oi tuousands of ner bravest and
best ; in nearly every household there is
a vacant chair ; in every heart memories
of sadness are clustering with each day :
upon the whole land there is a burden of
sore travail, and yet the blind victims will
not see and feel the truth. Bewildered
by the arts of demagogues they endeavor
to hug the viper of rebellion slavery, to
their bosoms, and strive to kill themselves
under the delusion that they are protect
ing the Constitution I
But a day of deliverance ia at hand.
ben the blow is struck that emancil
ptes the slaves of evary rebel, mora
shackles will fall from the victims of reb
el falsehood, and many thousands will re
joice iq the liberty which enables them to
see iq the Constitution a savor of life un
to life. Over these who are emancipated
from the chains of cowardice and treason,
there will be joy, even as there wdl be
jubilee over every liberated Ethiop, in all
regions and realms where sin and error
die in pure radiance of translucent truth.
Such a jubilee will have no stain of bitter
ness in it, for every brave pure spirit will
be filled with gladness, and only those
who are vile, tyrannical and brutish will
find cause for mourning. Only those who
hate mankind, only thoee who govern the
weak by the lash and chain, only those
who take slavery as the corner-stone of
their empire, will knaah their teeth at
such deliverance. "The sons of God" will
shout for joy, and a quickening pulsation
of happiness vibrate from earth's aones,
until the circling waves of that glad emo
tion shall widen and widen until every
bright intelligence that sympathies with
the shadows and the lights of human ex
istence shall participate, even as the roof
and walls ana worshippers in a vast cathe
dral are made dim but glorious by clouds
of grateful incense.
Manufacturers will bear in mind that
their monthly reports stating the quanti
ty and value of their manufactures, and
the quantity and value sold, for each
clean month first and last day inclusive
properly sworn to, should be handed in
to the Assistant Assessor, as soon after the
expiration of the month as convenient,
and in no case to be delayed beyond the
10th of the subsequent month. Blanks
for the purpose will be provided by the
Assistant Assessor. This applies to all
persons who make monthly reports.
Small Notk Ccaatscv. The question
is often asked, Ia the small note, or shin
plaster currency to which the community
is driven, in harmony with the provlsious
of law. Judge Sawyne has recently an
swered this question by a decision in
which he holds that the act of congress
prescribing penalties for issuing notes of
a less denomination than one dollar, in
tended to circulate as money, to be un
constitutional, and that no prosecution
for such circulation can be instituted.
A charge of Judge Nelson to a New York
grand jury, was to the same effect.
