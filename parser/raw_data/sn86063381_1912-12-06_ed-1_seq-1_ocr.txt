MESSASE
FROM PRESIDENT TAFT TO CON-
GRESS TODAY IS OPTIMISTIC
RECOMMENDS GOETHELS TO
BE A MAJOR GENERAL
WANTS CURRENCY LEGISLA-
TION PASSED AT ONCE.
By united Press.
Washington, Dec. 6.In a message
teeming with optimism, President
Taft today urged upon congress an
advanced program of legislation 'on
the fiscal, judicial, military and in
sular affairs of the nation.
Pleading for the immediate pass
age of a currency reform measure
along the lines of the Aldrich plan,
the president edclared for a bigger
navy, a further reorganization of
the army to provide for a greater
reserve during times of peace con
tinued supervision over Porto Rico
and the Philippines federal regula
tion of water powers in navigable
streams and the promulgation of a
workingmen's compensation act.
The president highly praised Col
onel Goethals, chief engineer of the
Panama canal and recommended that
as a commendation of his wonder
ful work, Goethals be made major
general of the army with the title
of chief of engineers, when the pres
ent incumbent is relieved. The tar
iff, the president dismissed with a
few paragraphs.
'It was my belief that these cus
toms ought to be revised downward,"
he said, *'but now that a new con
gress has been elected on a platform
of a tariff for revenue only, rather
than a protective tariff it is needless
for me to occupy the time of congress
with arguments or recommendations
in favor of a protective tariff."
The $22,000,000,000 deficit which
appears" between the treasurer's re
port of estimated income for the com
ing year and the estimated expendi
tures, the president blamed on con
gress' failure to appropriate for the
two battleships last year, necessitat
ing an estimate for three this year.
The president's plea for a revised
banking and currency system was
particularly pressing. Declaring it
to be "the most crying need of the
country today," he recommended the
immediate adoption of an elastic
currency system along the lines of
the central bank idea proposed by
the Aldrich currency bill.
Discussing the prejudice which
greeted the central bank idea, the
president argued that it arose from
an erroneous idea of its powers and
a distrust of bankers by the people.
The president warmly commended
the recent adoption in the army of
the three year reserve clause, for en
listed men, which makes them subject
to draft in case of war, after their
enlistment has expired, and the milit
ia pay bill for the national guard,
the volunteer bill to provide for the
quick raising of forces in time of
war, and the adoption of the resident
soldiery idea for insular positions.
The Democratic congress abolished
the tariff board which President Taft
had established to take the tariff out
of politics, so now they must go it
alone and smite protection hip and
thigh, and that immediately.
In the crisp, bright October air
the sweet young thing had been for a
drive with her sweetheart, and re
turned freshened and glowing with
excitement.
"Oh, mother," she cried, "Tom and
I had the narrowest escape from an
awful accident. The horse nearly
bolted, and I don't know what would
have happened!
"We were going through a narrow
lane when, all of a sudden, a pheas
ant got up from the hedge and flew
across the horse's head and before
Tom could grasp the reins"
"Er," inquired the young brother'
"wasn't he holding them, then?",
And it took a long time to explain
clearly what actually did happen.

VOLUME 10. NUMBER 189. BEMIDJI, MEfNESOTA, FRIDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 6, 1912. TEN CENTS PER WEEK-
THRILLED HIS AUDIENCE
President Vincent Held Delegates to
Development Meeting With
Strong Address.
TJBGED MOBE "TEAM PLAY."
Crookston, Dec. 6The Thursday
afternoon session of the Northern
Minnesota Development association
was held at the Crookston School of
Agriculture, where four of the larger
buildings were named.
One of the four, the Agricultural
Science building, just completed, was
dedicated and named James J.
Hill building in recognition of the
interest taken by James J. Hill when
the Northwest Experiment Station
was first established here by the state
University, later followed by the
Northwest School of Agriculture,
now the largest and best equipped
educational institution, coupled with
the Experiment Station, to be found
in Northern Minnesota.
President George Edgar Vincent,
University of Minnesota, delivered
one of the most forceful addresses
ever listened to before the develop
ment convention in the morning at
the Grand opera house, holding the
audience so close that a pinfall might
have been heard except during the
outbursts of applause. His address
in substance follows:
"If I rightly understand the pur
poses of this association it stands for
teamplay in developing the resources,
increasing the population, and organ
izing the social life of Northern Min
nesota. This team-play demands that
all participants keep steadily in mind
the larger common purpose, that no
individuals or groups seek narrower
advantage. Every member of the
team must do his part. Not only are
new settlers to be brought in, but
real-estate men, merchants, bankers,
political leaders, schools, churches,
will work together to afford congen
ial and encouraging conditions of
life.
"It is not sportman-like to cooper
ate to bring in the immigrant and
them to set about competing to ex
ploit him This association exists to
see that the game is played fairly.
It understands that a region cannot
be "boosted" into prosperity, but that
steady, fundamental work must be
done by a great variety of interests
all loyal to a fine, inspiring end,
namelyto make -life in Northern
Minnesota rewarding, interesting and

KILLED IN TOWN OF SUMMIT
Blackduck, Dec. 6.A monstrous
black bear was the trophy secured
after a day's hunt by Messrs. James
F. Sullivan and Glenn M. Wood of
this village last Saturday. Mr. Wood',
tracked the bear for several hours on i
Friday and the next day in- company
with Mr. Sullivan the trail was tak- I
en up again. After following Mr.
Bruin for some distance the trail
was lost and for a time it looked as
though he had given the huntsmen
the slip when suddenly Mr. Wood
came upon him in his den. He called
to Mr. Sullivan to come up but about
this time the bear started toward
Mr. Wood. The latter wanted to
get a view of his prey before shoot
ing but Mr. Sullivan decided to take
no chances and with a well aimed
shot brought down the bear. It was
a large black one weighing between
two and three hundred pounds. They
went to a nearby house and tele
phoned to Dr Kbch who went out
and brought the bear to town in his
auto.
The place where the bear had his
den was only a short distance from
Chas Olson's home in Summit.

Lake and M. ft I. BeadsCity
Bonte Laid Ont.
Making small purchases of farm
and city property on each of some
twelve or fifteen trips to Bemidji
during the past three months a Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, man has gradually ob
tained title to some of the best city
and nearby country real estate that
has been on the market. It is said
that he represents a large Iowa real
estate company.
When the purchases of this com
pany are indicated on a map of Be
midji and vicinity, it is seen that
they follow a well denned route. This.
fact, together with the information
received by the Pioneer that certain
parties have been negotiating with
the M. & I. and Red Lake railroads
for trackage rights, has led to the
belief that outsiders are preparing
for a Bemidji street car service. To
add to the belief, Thomas Roycrqft,
general manager of the Grand Fofhx
Street Railway company, has bought
property at Riverside and has stated
that Riverside would make an excel
lent railway terminal.
The real estate bought has been
acquired by the Iowa company is
small lots from different real estate
firms so that the buying would not
attract attention From the Missis
sippi river on the eastern city limits,
the company has eleven pieces of
property which lie along the M. &
right of way as far north as the Bass
Lake road and three more parcels at
Riverside have recently changed
hands. On the Red Lake road, the
company has obtained land at Ander
son's and Marsh's sidings and four
pieces near Werner. Other parcels
have been bought on Big Turtle,
Gnatt, and Movill lakes.
The Pioneer is told that W. H.
Gemmell, general manager of the 1C
& I. has been apprroached with a
proposition involving trackage rights
between the Bemidji Union depot and
Nymore next spring with the possibil
ity of extending the service north as
far as Turtle River later. It is said
that if satisfactory arrangements can
be made, a railroad company will be
formed among men who have the cap
ital ready and that it will start oper
ating between Bemidji and Nymore
as soon aa the mills open next spring.
At the present time, those interested
are talking gasoline operated cars or
gasoline and electricity combined.
It is also stated that officials of the
Red Lake line were approached some
months ago with a proposition of the
new company to use the Red Lake
tracks as far north as Werner with
the possibility of later taking over
all of the Red Lake passenger serv
ice. The proposition came to the offi
cials indirectly but it was under
stood at the time that they were will
ing to negotiate.
As far as can be learned at 'his
time, the street car proposition 4s aa.
follows:
As soon as the mills start next
spring, a .gasoline car will be put in
operation between Bemidji and Ny
more over the M. & I. tracks with
possibly a spur built through the box
factory yards to the village.
Should proper arrangements be
made, the service will be extended to
Turtle River with yards and termin
als on the Mississippi river at River
side.
Service also to be inaugurated on
the Red Lake line as far north as
Werner and to go farther when con
ditions warrant.
A street line to be built north from
the Union depot in the city on Min
nesota avenue, across to Irvine ave
nue and then to the city limits.
When the service on the M. 4b
has reached Turtle River and Werner
on the Red Lake line, to build a cross
country line from Werner to Turtle
River which will touch Movill lake.
This line may be built from Lavinta
instead of Turtle River and opes the
country at the head of Late Bemid
ji.
