WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 10, 182.
Winter Quarters.
It U rumored that tbo Grand Army of
the Potorrmc is logo into winter quarters
nt Aquia Crock. We trust ibis is ft tnu
tnkc. Thcro is something doleful, dis
astrous in the very thought of winter
quarters', for several hundred thousand
men, iu tho present stalo of national af
fairs, when winter seems to bo the most
propitious time for military operations in
tbo enemy's country.
Thcro aro sovoral reasons, potent ones
. too, that indicate winter quarters, nt tho
present very bad quarters.
I. Tho direct tendency must be to
dishearten and discourago our soldiery,
panting for a final victory and tho close of
tho war. Twenty months have already
past since tho call to arms, ono winter al
ready spent in comparative inactivity, and
but lilllo accomplished during tho past
summer but preparation, as it would scorn,
for a bold and successful winter compr.ign,
and then for that campaign to fizzle out,
can but bo discouraging, disheartening in
tho extreme to thoso who long, as tho
watcher for the day, to see their country
onco moro free, and they again becomo
dwellers at home, amid scones they love,
and engaged in tho peaceful pursuits of
remunerative labor.
II. It is evident that tho rebellion
must bo crushed on tho soil of tho rebell
ious, if any whero; and it is well known
to tho country, and thousands on thou
sands of desolato firesides to-day bear
mournful witness to tho fact that a host
of valuablo lives, tho very flower of the
army, during tho summer past, becamo a
sacrifico to an unnatural climato. Aooth
cr summer will doubtless prove still moro
fatal than tho past to our soldiery, if com
polled to remain, whilo tho winter is cm
incnlly mild and salubrious, and every
way well calculated for military opera
tions, as wo should suppose.
III. Tho war, if prolonged beyond
tho present winter, through tho needless
inactivity of our armies, must bo indefi
nitely prolonged, and thereby a lax laid
upon tho shoulders of tho peoplo for ils
support exceedingly burdensome to boar,
if not totally ruinous to both people and
government.
IV. If nothing to the purpose is nc
nccomplishcd during tho winter, we bo
licvo from foreign movements at present
something more than a silent view will bo
taken in our nfTairs by European powers
an action instead that shall prove ex
ceedingly ajmoying, if not disastrous to
our cause. Therefore, in view of the fore
going, and of many other cogent reasons,
let us have during tho present winter a
most vigorous prosecution of tho war. Let
no other winter quarters for a moment
bo thought of than thoso afforded in
shelter tents through tho whole length
and breadth of the enemy's country. Let
every sword bo drawn from its scabbard
and every musket primed for tho contest.
Let a determination that knows no defeat
bo depicted on the countenance of every
officer and privato in our vast army, by
land and sea, to terminate this hcart-sick-cning
rebellion during tho coming winter,
and wo believe it can and will bo done.
Tho nation demands it At their hands,
and wo believe will bo satisfied with no
result Ehort of a comploto and final victo
ry. Shall wo havo it!
A Warning Relative to Iron-Clads.
A writer at London to the Boston
Commercial Bulletin says : It is well
you aro just completing a fleot of moni
tors. You aro likely to need them before
Jong. Workmen aro engagod night and
day on the Mersey, Clyde and elsewhere,
in building somo tweuty iron clads which
aro to see service in American waters.
They are intended to convoy vessels into
Southern ports. This I know to be a
fact. My information is direct from thoso
in tho confidenco of tho promoters.
To disarm suspicion, it is pop
ularly given out that this iron-clad fleet
is being built for the Chinese government,
but 1 need hardly tell you that Mr. Ma
son and his friends form ono of tho chief
contracting parties."
Recent communications from ihe 21st
Michigan Infantry stalo that only About
three huudrod men can bo mustcrod for
cfioclivo duly from the entiro Regiment.
Tho run after Bragg, if not a wild-gooso-chasc,
was a using up ono to that Regi
ment, temporarily, at least.
Promotion.
Wo rojoico at tho promotion of Capt.
Noah H. Ferry, to tho rank of Major in
the 5lh Mich. Cavalry. Wo feel confi
dent ho will fill tho post with great hon
or and proficiency. Noah, we believe to
to be true, bravo and patriotic to his
very heart's center, nud just tho kind of
men needed to close the war at onco.
Wo copy the following in relation to his
promotion from tho Detroit Free Press:
Major Ferry.-Among tho many pro
motions of bravo and deserving officers,
no ono has gratified us moro than that of
Captain Noah II. Ferry, to tho position
cf Major of the Fifth Cavalry. When
tho war broke out, Major Ferry volunteer
ed as ft private, and insisted upon shoul
dering a musket. But a man of his ca
pacity could not long remain in tho rank?.
Ho was elected Captain of a company at
White River. Major Ferry is a man of
real, genuine merit, and will prove him
self nn nctivo and thorough officer, and
increaso tho fame of Michigan in tho fiold.
It always gives us real pleasure to speak
well of thoso appointed to military posi
tions, whatever may havo been their po
litical affinities, for wo know full well that
tho efficiency of our regiments depends
much upon tho officers, and tho comfort
of tho men. everything. Thero is no way
of so cfl'cctually protecting tho men as to
give them officers, who know their duly
and havo tho courago to do it fearlessly,
every regiment is nn army ; but with poor
officers, those who aro incompetent, inef
ficient nnd dishonest, a regiment is soon
utterly demoralized and dostroyed.
The Expeditions.
Tho expedition under Major Goneral
McClcrnnnd, for operations down the Miss
issippi, is fast nppronching completion
It U expected to move on or beforo the
tho 10th inst. Tho corps d'nrmes will
consist entirely of Western nnd North
western troops, embracing thirty-two rcg
i men Is of infantry, besides a largo force
of cavalry nnd artillery from tho Ken
tucky army. This force will cooperato
with tho fleet of Commodore Porter, con
sisting of ten gun-boats, nrmed with ono
ono hundred nnd twenty guns. Colum
bus is tho point of rendezvous. Vicks
burg will nfford tho first formidable obsta
cle to the passage of tho fleet. Tho con
federates aro making preparations for a
bold stand, ns is thought, at. Port Hudson,
ono hundred nnd fifty miles nbove New
Orlcnns. But little doubt wc think need
bo entertained of a speody opening of tho
Missississippi to tho commcrco of tho
Great West.
Banks' expedition, for operations on tho
tho Coast and Gulf, is being pushed to
ward completion with tho utmost alacrity
Charleston, Savannah nnd Mobile nro
doubtlessly destined to becomo ours soon
through its instrumentality.
Winter Sufferers,
Tho nppronch of winter with all its
promising plensuro nnd gayely to some,
is but tho harbinger of want nnd exlromo
suffering from cold nnd hunger to others, to
say nothing of tho thousands of sufferers
in our own large towns and cities. Tho
distress in somo of tho manufacturing
districts of England is really nppnlling.
In Lancashire, alone, 150,000 operatives
are out of work entirely, nnd 130,000
others employed only a portion of the
timo. It is estimated that 230,000 in
that shire, alone, aro dependent on tho
Board of Guardians or relief Committee
for food, requiring tho sum of thirty or
forty thousand pounds n week to mako
them comfortable If such destitution
prevails in that ono locality, what must
bo tho amount of suflering in tho aggre-
gato of tho manufacturing districts of
England entire f And what is tho causo f
The accursed rebellion in our own coun
try, cutting off the supply of cotton. An
other argument why the war should bo
urged to a most speedy conclusion. IIu
inanity nnd philanthropy urges it.
A benovolcnt gcntlcmnn in Buffalo of
fers to give five hundred bushels of corn
toward lading a ship for tho relief of tho
suflercrs. Othcr., no doubt, fully alive
to the claims of the poor, which wo havo
always with us, will second tho good deed
and do likewise not unmindful, in the
meantime, of the poor at homo.
Col. Ciiami'LIn, of the Third Michi
gan Infantry, has been promoted a Brig
adier General. It is deserved, and the
pobilion will bo honored by tho incumbent.

Local Correspondence.
Mr, Editor: I perceive that you have
noticed in your columns a Thanksgiving
discourse, recently prenchod by mo, in
tho Presbyterian Church, in this placo.
It would havo been much moro congo
nial to my feelings had you suffered tho
discourso, prepared solely for the edifica
tion of my own congregation and thoso
who might see fit to unite with us in tho
observance of a day of thanksgiving, to
pass without any public allusion, whatev
er, being mado to it.
Whilo, of course, I appreciate tho kind
ly motive which dictated your remarks,
and mean now no reflection upon your
intentions, allow mo to say th'at I fear a
misapprehension may arise in the minds of
somo in regard to tho drift of my dis
courso from a single paragraph in your
notice. It would cortaiuly bo very natu
ral for the reader to infer from it that
my discourso, cither altogether or for the
most part, was simply a tirndo against
Oarrisonian abolitionism- I hopo I had
a better and nobler object in view than
this, and if any present failed to discover
what that object was, it was not certainly
becauso I did not tako pains to bo under
stood. How far I alluded to Garrisonian,
or to any other typo of abolitionism, will
bo soen by tho following extract, which I
respectfully ask you to insert in this con
nection. Excuso its length. I do not
sco how I can mako myself understood
by any shorter extract. In it is contained
tho only allusion to abolitionism.
Respectfully yours, D. M. C.
"It matters very littlo, just now, what
may be your individual opinion or mine
concerning that most extraordinary polit
icnl nnd social phenomenon of modern
times, viz: African Slavery, embosomed
in this free, democratic, christian republic.
I may execrate tho system as ono unjust
nnd cruel to tho black man, nud demoral
izing to tho white man, and ardently pray
for its extinction, in God's own way and
time. You may bo a red-hot Garrisonian
Abolitionist twin brother to a fire-eat
ing Secessionist. Your neighbor may bo
what, in my opinion, is far worse than ei
thor, a negrophobiast, a ncgro-haler, ono
who despises a negro simply becauso he
is a negro, casting contempt upon a por
tion of our common humanity, for whom
Christ died, thus insulting God, tho Cro
ator and Redeemer of humanity. It
matters not, just now, what may bo your
opinions, or mine, concerning slavery, as,
it has been truly remarked, 4 wo havo
been hurried past tho placo of argument
against slavery. Wo aro done with all
that; the books and pamphlets, thodocu
mcnts and statistics aro growing quickly
obsolete, for they havo dono their work ;
wo need not bo careful of them for our
future use. Wo shall not need them ex
ccpt as relics of a woll-fought field.' I
say it matters very littlo what may bo
your individual opinion, or mine, concern
ing slavery, just at this crisis, so far as
tho final issue is concerned, since God is
dealing directly with it himself.
" Said n distinguished politician, to a
gentleman, I frankly confess to you that
for myself I tako no interest in tho ne
gro; but, gentlemen, I am at a loss to
conceive how any man can review the his
tory of this rebellion without a clear con
viction that Almighty Providence docs
" So, wo say, whether wo take an inter
est in tho enslaved African or demoraliz
ed whito man, or in tho progress and ultl
mate triumph of tho principles of civil
and religious liberty, or iu tho proserva
tion in its integrity of our glorious Un
ion, with its 'time-honored' traditions
and precious memories, Almighty Provi
dence does, and is causing all things, oven
this terrible war, to work together for our
common good. Let us iu reverential awe
stand still nnd sco tho salvation of our
God."
After tho present issuo of tho Netcs
wo feel constrained to discontinue it to
every one who has formerly regularly re
ceived it gratuitously. Tho enormous
advance of the price of printing paper and
other material compel us to either adopt
this means of lessening expenses or to
considerably increase our old established
rates of subscription, advertising and job
work. Tho latter shall bo avoidod until
every other possiblo means havo been
tried and found insufficient. Let none of
our friends tako it unkindly, for it is ab
solutely a policy the times and circum
stances demand of us. Retrenchment is
now, more than ever, a virtue, nud should
bo in every department of life tho ordor
of the day.

Important Naval Experiments.
Captain Ericsson accomplished a feat on
Saturday last which will create almost as
much interest in naval circles on tho oth
er side of tho ocenn ns did tho famous
conflict between tho Monitor nnd the Mcr-
rimnc.
By nn invention of his. four men sue
cceded in working a gun weighing twen
ty tons, in a turret. Indeed, so simple
and comploto was his wonderful piVco of
machinery that ono man could handle the
gun with case, ihe practical importance
of this feat will bo understood when it is
remembered that it takos twenty-five men
to work an Armstrong gun weighing four
teen tons, and that for this reason a G8
pounder smooth-boro is considered tho
best and most effective naval gun in the
English service. So long ns wo retain
the uso of Captain Ericsson s invention
our iron clads can throw double, if not
trcblo tho weight of nn English war ves
sel, and with far greater case and rapidi
ty. Naval officers who witnessed tho op
eration of this now contrivance of Capt.
,ncsson declare that it will etiect a com
pleto revolution in naval warfare, and will
give us, for a lime at least, a decided ad
vantago over any other nation in this im
portant particular. N. Y. World.

bread dealt out to our troops on tho Rap-
Eahannock, was packed in May, lSui,
ut must bo much older: during its pen
insular campaign the bread became inhab
ited by a very lively species of insect of
a brown color and amiable disposition.
Various stories are told of these crackers
in camp, some of which I fear aro mali
cious fabrications. One was that the in
sects were purposely put in tho bread to
save mule transportation, and that when
tho commissary wished to transport the
bread ho simply whistled and it cnino it
self. Another was that four of the crack
ers were seen on battallion drill ono eve

great precision. Ono of Ihe boys had a
lot of bread so thickly settled ns to be

RAD WA YS READ Y RELIEF
Will relieve those who suffer pains, instantly on
its application externally or by its administra
tion internally, and cuiea
Rheumatism in a few noun; bore Ibroat in
fifteen minutes ; Tooth-ache in three minutes;
Neuralgia, (paroxysm of,) in Ive minutes;
Cramps in five minutes ; Head ache in ton min

minutes; Influensa in a few hours; Croup in
ton uiiuutes ; Spasms in five miimtcs; and deep
Beated pains by a few applications.
In all cases where pain is felt, the Ready Re
lief should be applied. Taken internally atea
spoon full to half a tumbler of water it will
cure acidity of the stomach, and promote diges
tion ; it is a pleasant and healthy stimulant.
TO THOSE WHO DO THINK
We say that RaJwau'e Ready Relief is tho
most elegant and powerful medicine known in
tho world. This is not boasting ; try it if you
feel sceptical and be convinced. It combines in
its composition the properties of a diffusive
stimulant, an Anti-septic, a mild but effective
Astringent, ami a direct power over the nerves,
neither narcotic nor anodine, that relievos pain
in a manner peculiar to itaclf, and for which we
have no word in the English language exactly
to express its action- The Frenoh call it Soul
agement. So much for its internal administra
tion. When applied externally, it will be found
a powerful counter-irritant, instantly reddening
the surface to which it is applied, and withdraw
ing the blood from some neighboring part,
whero it may be eongeited or heaped up, causing
pain and leading to inflammation. It fulfills
the indication of equalising the circulation moat
effectively, and most beautifully to minds that
can understand its action.
TO THOSE WHO THINK.
Now, we hold that all external remedies a:t
either in ono of two ways, or combiue the
action of both. First They act diroctly upon
the nervous system without touching tho blood
vessels tho taiiffuiferoHi system. All Arnica
liniments, nerve liniments, etc., belong to this
class, and consequently only benumb the ends of
tho nerves, without alTecting at all tho circula
tion may temporarily stop pain but have not
the slightest effect iu restoring tho equilibrium
of circulation, essential to honlthy action : Or
Secondly --They iu t upon the Mood vessel with
out, ns in tho enso of depletives, (leeches or
cups) I'cgnrd to tho nervous system. Now, tho
fact is tlint tho nerves prcsido over the blood
vessels, and an external application to bo effect
ive must act upon both ficrves and blood vessels.
RADWAY'S READY RELIEF,
Wo proclaim, has this double action of assuag
ing pain, by its specific effect upon the nerves
and equalizing tho circulation, by its effect up
on the blood vossels. In this way it relieves and
cures Rheumatism, Lumbago, Tooth-ache, Head
ache, and a variety of such like complaints.-
When taken internally, its astringent and dif
fusive stimulating properties cheek in tho most
naturiil manner Diarrhoea, Colics, nnd other
bowel complaints. Whilst for sore Throats, ac
companied by putrcsenry, and for fever patients,
with Typhoid symptoms, an eminent physician
attached to tho Now Orleans Hospital, has -pronounced
it fur superior as an aiiti-ieptiennA an-ti-putretvcnt,
to tho celebrated eau iledicinule
of Raspnil. He administers it internally to his
patients, and sprinkles his wurds with it, Let
