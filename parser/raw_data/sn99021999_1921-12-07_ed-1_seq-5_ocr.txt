Text of the President's Message
To the Sixt v-Seventh Congress
Washington, Dec. 6, Partial text
tt President Harding's metsage to
tongren ia a follow:
Mr. Speal.fr and members of the
Congress:
It is t very gratifying privilege to
tome to the congress with the repub
lic at peace with all the nations of
the world. More, it Is equally grati
fying to report that our country i
tiot only free from every impending
menace of war, hut there are grow
ing assurance of the permanency of
the peace which we o dreply cherish.
" . Disordered Conditions,
, For approximately 10 years, we
fiave dwelt amid menaces of war or
si participants hi war's actualities,
and the inevitable aftermath, with its
disordered conditions, has added to
the difficulties of government, which
adequately cannot -be appraised ex
cept by those who are in immediate
' contact and know the responsibilities.
d Our tasks would be less difficult if
" ive had only ourselves to consider,
but ao much of the world was in
lawed the disordered conditions are
so well, nigh universal, even among
rations not engaged in actual war
fare, that no permanent readjust
ments can be effected without con
sideration of our inescapable rela
tionship to world affairs in fifiance
and trade. Indeed, we yhould be un
worthy of our best traditions if we
ivere unmindful of social, moral, and
political conditions which are not of
direct concern to us, but which do
appeal to the human sympathies and
the very becoming interest ot a peo-
le blest with our national good ior
inc. j
' Heroic Remedies.
It is not my purpose to bring
o you a program of world restora
tion. In the main such a program
tuust be worked out by the nations
?iost directly concerned. They must
hemselves turn to the heroic reme
flies for the menacing conditions
tinder which they are struggling,
then we can help, and we mean to
help.
We shall do so unselfishly be
cause there is compensation in the
L consciousness of assisting, seltishly
, because the commerce and interna-
tional exchanges in trade which
u. marked our hieh tide of fortunate
f advancement, are possible only when
natirttic r( oil rrntiti.fiti arA r
v stored to stable order and normal
, relationship
In the main the contribution of this
republic to restored normalcy in the
world must come through the initia
tive of the executive branch of the
government but the best of inten
tions and most carefully considered
purposes would fail utterly if the
sanction and the co-operation of con
gress were not cheerfully accorded.
Greater Security..-
'Granting that we are fundamen
tally, a representative popular gov
ernment with political parties the
governing agencies, I believe the
political party in power should as
iume responsibility, determine upo:i
policies in the conference which
supplements conventions and elec
tion campaigns and then strive for
achievement through adherence to
the accepted policy.
There is vastly greater security,
immensely more of the ' national
viewpoint, much larger and prompter

are along party lines, in the broad

geographically, or according to pur
suits, or personal followings. For
a century and a third parties have
been charged with responsibility and
held to strict Accounting. When
they fail, they are relieved of au
thority, and the system has brought
tis to a national eminence no less
than a world example.
It would be ungracious to with
hold acknowledgment pf the really
. large volume and excellent quality
Ot work accomplished by the extra
ct ordinary session of congress, which
so recently adjourned. I am not un
mindful of the very difficult tasks
with which you were called to deal,
and no one can ignore the insistent
Conditions which, during recent
years, have called for the continued
and almost exclusive attention of
Jpur memberships to public work.
It would suggest insincerity if I
expressed complete accord with
every expression recorded in your
roll calls, but we are all agreed
about the difficulties and the inev
itable divergence of opinion in seek
ing the reduction, amelioration and
readjustment of the burdens of tax
ation. Renewed Consideration.
Later on, when other problems
are solved, 1 snail make some
recommendations about renewed
consideration of our tax program,
but for the immediate time before
us we must be content with the bil
lion dollars reduction in the tax
draft upon the people, and dimin-

tfiJnly and improved methods of col
lection. By your sustainmcnt of
the rigid economies already inau
gurated, with hoped for extension
of these economies and added effi
ciencies in administration, I believe
further reductions may be enacted
and hindering burdens abolished.
Foreign Loans.
"There is pending a grant of au
thority to the authoritative branch
of the government for the funding
and settlement of our vast foreign
loans growing out of our grant of
vrar credits.. With the hands of the
executive branch held impotent to
deal with these debts, we are hin
dering urgent readjustment among
our debtors and accomplishing noth-
ing for ourselves. I think it is fair
for the congress to assume that the
executive branch of the government
would adopt no major policy m
dealing with these matters which
Would conflict with the purpose of
Congress in authorizing the loans
certainly not without asking con
gressional approval; but there are
minor problems incident to prudent
loan transactions and the safeguard
ing of our interests which cannot
even be attempted without this au
thorization. It will be helpful to
ovrsclves and it will improve con
ditions among our debtors if fund
ing and the settlement of defaulted
interest may be negotiated.
; Merchant Marine.
The previous congress, deeply con
cerned in behalf of our merchant
marine in 1920 enacted the existing
shipping law. designed for the up
building of the American merchant
I marine.
V t Power and ships, without comity
ci relationship, will not give us the
expanded trade which ! inseparably
linked with a great merchant marine.
Moreover, the applied reduction of
duty, for which the treaty denounce
ments were neceiary. encouraged
only the carrying of dutiable imports
to our shores, while the tonnage
which unfurls the flag on the next
ij both free and dutiable, and the
cargoes which make a nation eminent
in trade ire outgoing, rather than in
coming. No Protest Made.
The executive branch of the gov
ernment, uninfluenced by the protest
of any nation, for none has been
made,, is wtll convinced that your
proposal is fraught with difficulties
and to marked by tendencies to dis
courage trade expansion that I invite
your tolerance of noncompliance for
a few wrrks until a plan may be pre
sented which contemplates no greater
draft upon the public treasury, and
which, though yet too crude to offer
it today, gives such promise of ex
panding our merchant marine that it
will argue its own approval. It is
enough to say today that we are so
possessed of ships, and the American
intention to establish a merchant ma
rine is so unalterable, that a plan of
reimbursement at no other cost than
is cont iiplated in the existing act
will appeal to the pride and encour
age the hope of all the American
people.
There Is before you the comple
tion of the enactment of what has
been termed a "permanent" tariff
law, the word "permanent'' being
used to distinguish it from the
emergency art which the congress
expedited early in the extraordinary
session and which is the law today.
I can not too strongly urge an early
completion of this necessary legis
lation. It .s needed to stabilize our
industry at home; it is essential to
make more definite our trade rela
tions -abroad. More, it is vital to
the preservation of many of our own
industries, which contributes so not
ably to the very life blood of our
nation.
Conflicting Opinion.
There is now, and there always
will be, a storm of conflicting opin
ion about any tariff revision. We
can not pro far wrong when we base
our tariffs on the .policy of preserv
ing the productive activities, which
enhance employment and add to our
national prosperity.
Again comes the reminder that we
must not be unmindful of world con
ditions, that peoples are struggling
for industrial rehabilitation and that
we cannot dwell in industrial and
commercial exclusion and at the same
time do the just thing in aiding
world recognition and readjustment.
We do not seek a selfish aloofness
and we could not profit by it were
it possible. We recognize the neces
sity of buying wherever we sell, and
the permanency of trade lies in its
acceptable exchanges. In our pur
suit of markets we must give as well
as receive. We cannot sell io others
who do not produce, nor can we buy
unless we produce at home. Sensible
of every obligation of humanity, com
merce and finance, linked as they are
in the present world condition, it is
not .to be argued that we need de
stroy ourselves to be helpful to
others. With all my heart, I wish
restoration to the peoples blighted by
the awful world war, but the process
of restoration does not lie in our ac
ceptance of like conditions. It were
better to remain on firm ground,
strive for ample employment and
high standards of wages at home, and
point the way to balanced budgets,
rigid economy and resolute, efficient
work as the necessary remedies to
cure disaster.
We are a creditor nation, not by
normal processes, but made so by
war. It is not an unworthy selfish
ness to seek to save ourselves when
the processes of that salvation are
not only not denied to others, but
commended to them. We seek to
undermine for others no industry by
which they subsist; we are obligated
to permit the undermining of none of
our own which make for employ
ment and maintained activities.
Necessity Magnified.
Every contemplation, it little mat
ters in which direction one turns,
magnifies the difficulty of tariff leg
islation, but the necessity of the re
vision is magnified with it.
I am not unmindful of the consti
tutional difficulties. These can be
met by giving authority to the chief
executive, who could proclaim addi
tional duties to meet conditions
which the congress may designate.
At this point I must disavow any
desire to enlarge the executive's pow
ers or add to the responsibilities of
the office. They are ' already too
large. If there were any other plan
I would prefer it.
The grant of authority to
proclamation would necessarily bring
the tariff commission into new and
enlarged activities, because no ex
ecutive could discharge such a duty
except upon the information acquired
and recommendations by this com
mission. But the plan is feasible and
the proper functioning of the board
would give us a better administra
tion of a defined policy than ever

' American Valuation,
j There l a manifct difference of
opinion about the American vatua-
tion, Many nations have adopted de
livery valuation at the basis for col
lecting duties; that i, they take the
cost of the imports delivered at the
port of entry at the basis for levy
ing duty. It it no radical departure
in view of the varying conditions and
the disordered state of money valuet
to provide for American valuation,
but there cannot be Ignored the dan
ger of such a valuation brought to
the level of our own production costs,
making our tariffs prohibitive. It
might do to in many instance where
imports ought to be encouraged. I
believe congress ought well to con
sider the desirahility of the only
promising alternative, namely, a
provision authorizing proclaimed
American valuation, under prescribed
conditions, on any given list of arti
cles imported.
Knowing the impossibility of
modification by art of congress for
any one or a score of lines without
involving a long array of schedules,
I think we shall go a long wayt to
ward stabilization if there is resog
nition of the tariff commission's fit
ness to recommend urgent changes
by proclamation.
Business Revival.
I am sure about public opinion
favoring the early determination of
our tariff policy. There have been
reassuring signs of a business re
vival from the deep slump which
all the world' has been experiencing.
Our unemployment, which gave us
deep concern only a few weeks ago.
has grown encouragingly less, and
new assurances and renewed confi
dence will attend the congressional
declaration that American industry
will be held secure.
Something more than tariff pro
tect is required by American agri
culture. To the farm has come the
earlier and the heavier burdens of
readjustment. There is actual de
pression in our agricultural industry
while agricultural prosperity is ab
solutely essential to the general
prosperity of the country.
Congress has sought Very earnest
ly to provide relief. It has prompt
ly given such temporary relief as
has been possible, but the call is in
sistent for the permanent solution.
There must be some economic solu
tion for the excessive variation in
returns for agricultural production.
Remedy in Market nig.
In the main the remedy lies in
distribution and marketing. Every
proper encouragement snould be
given to the co-operative marketing
programs. These have proven very
helpful to the co-oporating com
munities in Europe. In Russia to
co-operative community has become
a recognized bulwark of law and
order, and saved individualism from
engulfment in social paralysis. Ul
timately they will be accredited with
the salvation of the Russian state.
'There is the appeal for this experi
ment. Why not try it? None chal
lenges the right of the farmer to a
larger share of the' consumer's pay
for his product, no one can dispute
that we can not live without the
farmer. He is justified in rebellion
against the transportation cost.
Given a fair return for his labor,
he will have less occasion to appeal
for financial aid, and given assur
ance that his labors shall not be in
vain, we reassure all the people of
a production sufficient to meet our
national requirement and guard
against disaster.
-The base of the pyramid of civil
ization which rests upon the soil is
shrinking through the drift of popu
lation from farm to city. For a
generation we have been expressing
more or less concern about this
tendency. Perhaps only grim neces
sity will correct it, but we ought to
find a less drastic remedy.
The existing scheme of adjusting
freight rates has been favoring tha

milling and meat packing industries
afford ample illustration and the at

parent. Common Counsel.
We have great bodiet of law
(artfully regulating the organirt
tion and opetationt of industrial and
financial corporations, as we have
treaties and compacts among na
tions which look to the settlement
of differences without the necessity
of conflict in arms, Vo we might well
have plans of conference, of com
mon counsel, of mediation, arbitra
tion and judicial determination in
controversies between labor and
capital. To accomplish this would
involve the necessity to develop a
thorough going code of practice it
dealings with such affairs. It might
be well to frankly set forth the su
perior interest of the community as
a whole to cither the labor group or
the capital group. With rights,
privileges, immunities and modes of
organization thus carefully defined
It should be possible to set up ju
dicial or quasi judicial tribunals for
the consideration and determination
of all disputes which menace the
public welfare.
In an industrial society such as
1 ours the strike, the lockout and the
boycott are as much out of place
and as disastrous in their results as
is war and armed revolution in the
domain of politics. The same dis
position to reasonableness, to con
ciliation, to recognition of the other
sides point of view, the same pro
vision of fair and recognized tribu
nals and processes, ought to make it
possible to solve the one set of ques
tions as easily as the other. I be
lieve the solution is possibh.
Charaster of Elemental Rights.
The consideration of such a policy
would necessitate the exercise of
care of deliberation in the construc
tion of a code and a character of
elemental rights, dealing with the re
lations of employer and employe.
This foundation in the law, dealing
with the modern conditions of social
and economic life, would hasten the
building of the temple of peace in
industry which a rejoicing nation
would acclaim.
While we are thinking of promot
ing the fortunes of our own people
I am sure there is room in the sym
pathetic thought of Americans for
fellow human beings who are suf
fering and dying of starvation in
Russia. A severe drouth in the val
ley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,
000 people into grievous fanimc. Our
voluntary agencies are exerting
themselves to the utmost to save
the lives of children in this area,
but it is now evident that unless re
lief is afforded the loss of life will
extend into many millions. America
can not be deaf to such a call as
that.

Anns Conference Gets Glimpse
America's Advantage by Use of Helium Observed by
Committee on Limitation of Aerial Engines
Of War..
By ARTHUR SEARS HENNINO.
Washington, Dee. 6. A signih
cant, perhaps prophetic, glimpse of
the unplumbed 'possibilities of the
warfare of the future was given by
chance yesterday to the arms con
ference subcommittee on aircraft at
the close of its session on the ques
tion of limitation of aerial engines
of war.
The members of the committee
representing the five great powers
were emerging from the navy build
ing when they observed the new
navy diiigibl, the C-7, flying low in
the offing. Rear Admiral Moffett.
chief of the bureau of aeronautics of
the American navy and chairman of
the conference subcommittee, ex
plained that the C-7 was inflated
with helium, the new noncombus
tible, nonexplosive gas, which
promises to revolutionize the use of
aircraft! in war.
Englishman Interested.
"Very interesting," observed air
Vice Admiral Higgins, the represen
tative of the British empire. "Amer
ica, I understand, is the sole pos
sessor of a supply of helium."
"It has been found only in the
United States, up to date, I believe,"
Admiral Moffett responded.
Then the British, French, Italian
and Japanese aviation experts con
gratulated Admiral Moffett on the
successful test of the new gas rep
resented by the flight of the C-7
from Hampton Roads and ite man
euvering in the vicinity of Wash
ington, The subcommittee had met and
adjourned after a preliminary, dis
cussion in which none of the na
tions represented disclosed its at
titude on the question of limitation
on war aircraft. When it was known
that Admiral Moffett is prepared to
stand by the Hughes dictum that
such limitation is impracticable, be
cause of the ease of converting
commercial aircraft to war purposes,
and other members were not ready
to discuss the quesn.
The next war will be largely in
the air, say the authorities, as they
contemplate the progress of the
