Congress Back on First Page
And Has Job Cut Out For It
1
BY 5. O. MESSENGER.
D RESIDENT HARDING lias not
been so engrossed with the
affairs of nine of the nations
of the earth, presented by
their envoys in conference here, that
he could not find time to make a
comprehensive survey o?.- domestic
conditions to present to Congress,
upon its reconvening: for the regular
session, which was in one respect a
notable affair.
There was the picture of the am
bassadors and ministers of these con
ference-attending countries, with
those of other countries as well; the
high-class journalistic writers of all
lands where the printing press whirs,
with the American lawmakers and
the executive administrators of the
American government gathered in
one hall, to hear the President make
his recommendations.
Europe, Asia and the two Americas
virtually touched elbows as the
visitors sat below the rostrum from
which the President addressed them.
? ? *
Congress "came bark" with a rush
and resumed its place on the front
page of the great daily newspapers,
from which it had been crowded for*
a while by the overshadowing arms
conference. The President's message
attracted widespread attention, judg
ing from the display given it in the
leading journals of the country. Well,
he talked about things that the peo
ple are interested in and which they
had all the time in the back of their
minds, even while their eyes were
focused for the time upon the fasci
nating international conference and
interesting figures.
Trow the country may be expected
t? resume consideration of home is
sues, after trifling with the foreign
dishes set by the arms conference.

President Harding disclosed in his
address- the fact that he has kept
constantly in touch with domestic
question*! and his comment upon them
was in line with his characteristic
mental process of dealing with big
problems ? matter-of-fact, business
like, safe and sane. And yet he did
not hesitate to take advanced ground
011 suggestions for new treatment of
the ttiriflf question. It will have to
be admitted that he has the courage
of his convict ions. |

What is the prospect for the legis- I
lation of the session? There is prob
ably no leader in either body of the
Congress who would risk his reputa
toin as a prophet upon predicting the
definite results of the long season
of legislative grist-grinding which
stretches ahead.1
For instance, it now- se^ns assured
that tjie tariff making is to proceed
under conditions which will render I
the process different from the con
struction of aforetime tariff laws.
Old lines of action will be superseded
by the new method, in which the
operation of the "bloc" system will
figure extensively, upsetting all the
familiar standards of party procedure.
The republican party is charged
%-ith the responsibility of framing
the new tariff law, and will be held to
accountability in the elections next '
November for doing it. Uut will the !
republican party, as a political unit, i
make the law? J
* * * * ,
A republican candidate for rc-elcc-l
tion to Congress might be expected
to make the claim, in case his con
stituency proved dissatisfied with the I
law, that the party should not be held
for the conglomerate measure j
that P?cms destined to come, but <
Q|ul^ .$? be able to "get awav with i
Tfie watchful democratic minor
_ 'viilH try to see to it that he does
liot succeed.
' ground will be tafcen by the j
<~n\o?rat? that the republicans, in
power in every branch of the govern
ment, and by majorities phenomenal
in size, are accountable in the utmost
letter of the law for the bill.
* * * *
It is estimated now that the tariff
can be made into law by next May.
Granting that it turns out as hope
fully predicted, and that it becomes
operative .immediately, its force and
effect will be apparent by the time
the campaign comes on. What will
be its reaction in the political field?
There is one possibility holding: out
comfort to the republicans, and that
is that employment conditions, now
brightening:, may operate to put the
people in a better frame of mind, and
j that this condition will be added to
J whatever impetus is given industry
| by the tariff, the republicans to reap
: the benefit of it all.
| Luck in politics is a recognized
I element, and the republicans still
| hope that luck will smile upon them,
j "Goodness knows." they say. "we had
( our share of bad luck." contemplating
j the feud of 1912 and the narrow mar
| gin by which they lost in 1916, which
j the old-time politician still avers was
j "just cussed bad luck."
I There is said to be no reason to
i doubt that industrial and business
conditions are on the upturn, due to
natural causes of action and reaction.
I the philosopher and economist will
j say, but due to the beneficent rule of
| the republican party, the politician
j will claim.
Well, it won't be long now until
| the politicians will have an oppor
! tunity to try out their claim upon
j the voters.
Of course, it would profoundly
shock President Harding and Secre
tary Hughes to suggest that political
considerations should be taken into
account at all in connection with the
arms conference. And well it might,
since their minds and hearts are fixed
upon higher aspects. But we now are
discussing the more sordid rank and
file of the politicians, who would not
hesitate a moment to attract unto
themselves the reflected glory of the
| achievement looked for. The "low
? brows" are certainly looking forward
! to political assets in this direction.
| And there is no reason now to ap
i preliend that the conference will prove
I anything but a signal success. The
j Congress came back from its brief va
I cation to find the conference itself in
a recess extending over several days,
j The pessimists and croakers had
i taken advantage of it to groan their
dolefuiest over the momentary ces
sation of progress evinced by visible
signs.
But when the leaders talked with
I President Harding and Secretary
Hughes, Senator iwodge and Mr. Root,
! they were toTd to be of good cheer;
there was no change for the worse,
but, on th contrary, everything looked
highly promising.
* * * *
I One of the cynical features of com
j ment !n circles surrounding the con
; ference has been the suggestion that
I the administration has so much at
I stake in the success of the confer
ence that advantage might be taken
; to wring concessions from the Amer
I ican delegation. That idea has not
| been harbored, however, by the con
! ference leaders, who have sensed and
appreciated the true attitude of the
President and of the American dele
gation.
T^Jiey know that with the President
and the administration the objects of
this world conference are far and
above all political or party considera
tions. It is a questiorf of principle
now. which applies to every country
a party to the confereqge. It is ar
gued that the participating nations
are on trial before the whole civilized
world, and will be called upon to

IVANDERLIP EXPLAINS HIS PLAN
i FOR HANDLING EUROPEAN DEBT
In view of the widespread interest
aroused in the plan proposed by Frank A.
Vanderlip for utilizing the proceeds of
the debt owed by the allied governments
to the government of the United States
for the rehabilitation and restoration of
Europe, and the undoubted importance
of his suggestions, The Star asked Mr.
Vanderlip for a more detailed explana
tion of his plan. The article published
below is the result.
By FRANK A. VANDERLIP.
QUESTIONS indicate interest.
There are certainly questions
enough asked about the plan for
handling the interallied Indebtedness
to the United States which I recently pre
sented to the Economic Club to leave no
doubt that people are Interested.
That plan, briefly, suggested that the pay
ment to us by the allies of the interest, and
gradually the principal, of what they owe
would probably not only be an impossible
drain upon their resources, but so far as they
did pay it would disorganize our industrial
affairs, because payment would have to be
made in goods. To avoid the danger of ruin
in'g our debtors and harming ourselves, it
was suggested that for a time the interest
payments be devoted to the rehabilitation of
Europe, expended under our direction. There
would be no relation between the solace of
the payment and the placc of expenditure.
Much of the expenditure would be in the
form of revolving credits and would result
ir. replacing allied obligation with obligations
of other governments, but with the further
specific security of the railway, grain ware
house. hydro-electric plant, or other work
that had been undertaken..
* * * *
The most frequent question that is asked
is: If the allies arc unable to pay us interest
on the debt, how would it be possible for
liiem to put cash in our hands to make such
expenditures as I have suggested for the re
habilitatio nof European economic life? It is
apparently difficult for people to grasp the
economic difference between making a pay
ment to us here in America and making pay
ments to be expended under our direction in
Europe. If payments cannot be made to us
here, many fail to see how they could be
made if they were not brought here.
There is. I think, a distinct difference in
the difficulties Involved in the two forms of
payment.
* * * *
Let us take, for example, the situation in
Italv. Italy Is one of the richest countries
in Europe in its effective labor supply. It is
one of the poorest countries in native raw
I material. There is at the present time much
unemployment. The official figures of unem
ployment when I was in Italy were 450,000.
and unemployment has been steadily Increas
ing. Italy is doing better than almost any
otfaer European country in balancing its
budget. It is not only levying taxes, but is
collecting them. It has actually reduced Its
circulating notes, having cut down its note
circulation from the high point more than
1,500.000,000 lire. The weakness of the Italian
situation lies in the necessity for imports and
the inability to export under present condi
tions. For the first five months of this year
Italian imports were in excess of 8,500.000.000
lire, while exports were 2,677.000J)00 lire,
leaving excess of imports 3.848,000,000 lire.
If Italy were to pay us here in America, the
deficit in her foreign trade balance would be
increased by the amount she paid us. That
is obviously impossible.
* * * *
On the other hand, if we were to undertake,
for example, the development of hydro-electric
power in Italy, she could readily furnish'all
the labor and a considerable amount of the
industrial manufactures connected with such
an undertaking. She could domestically raise
the credit for that work. The result of such a
program might well be the furnishing ef a
large amount of employment for the unem
ployed, a development of electric power that
would ease the necessity for coal Imports,
which would help balance her foreign trade
deficit, and the conversion of the debt which
she could not possibly now pay us directly
into an obligation that would give us all the
security we now have, plus a lien on the
hydro-electric plant which would be con
structed. England could help with fhe enter
prise, and at the same time make some pay
ment of interest due us by constructing tur
bines and dynamos for export to Italy. No
one's domestic Industrial situation would be
upset, and a great contribution would* be
made toward setting things going again in
dustrially.
* * * *
I.et us look at another project ill some de
tail. The food situation in Europe could be
immensely improved if modern systems of
grain elevators were established in the agri
cultural districts of eastern Europe. All the
labor necessary could be easily supplied in
each of the countries where the elevators
were constructed. The cost of that labor
migltt be met by English payments, but the
payment would not have to be made in foreign ex
change. Tlie moment that these non-manu
facturing nations could obtain any credit in
England they would.spend it for English
manufactured goods. England has two mil
lion idle men, and as many more working on
short time. The English payment would be
made, not in cash or foreign exchange, but
in goods that eastern Europe is hungry for,
while English mills are standing idle.
The necessary timber for such construction
might in part, for example, come from Poland.
Poland owes us a considerable amount, but
has such an adverse balance of trade that she
cannot pay outside debts in foreign currency
values. She has almost unlimited forest
products and plenty of labor to convert those
into lumber. This program would stimulate
her exports, givitig her an outlet for some
thing she can produce, instead of leaving her
lumber as it is in its present stagnant posi
tion. Poland cou^d easily export lumber to
Rumania, whereas,? of course, she cannot ex
port lumber to the-United States. Under such
an arrangement ihf debt due us from Poland,
which sh? cannot'pay. would be converted
into a debt due us from Rumania, for which
there would be added security of the system
of grain elevators which we would construct.
While that arrangement would be beneficial
to us. it would be of enormous benefit both
to Rumania and to all food-consuming Europe.
* * * *
There are regions in Europe where the
building of railroads would be followed by as
rapid economic development as followed the
construction of some of the railroads in our
great west a generation ago. The food supply
of Europe would be increased and the buy
ing capacity of great masses of eastern Eu
ropean peasants would soon make itself felt
all the industrial nations of western Eu
rope. If we undertook the construction of
well Jocated lines of this character, the direct
labor would be found locally. The rails, roll
ing stock and locomotives could be built in
England and France by men who are now
Idle. Such exports from England ,and France
would not upset our domestic situation, but
would quickly put hope and new vigor into
the Eureopean situation and would be fol
lowed by new demands in England and France
for the products ot factories and mills; there
would be reactions on every side that would
be advantageous and we would have obtained
for the Interest claims that cannot be directly
liquidated In payment to us fresh obligations from
eastern European nations, plus liens upon
railroads we constructed.
* * * *
There would undoubtedly develop creative pro
grams which we might undertake both in England
and France. There are great waterpower de
velopments ready to be undertaken In France,
but In the present state of government credit
further loans for the purpose cannot be made.
It would. nevertheleBs, be possible for France
to make payments to us of funds that were
to be directly expended within her own
boundaries. The productive capacity of France
could be Increased, her fuel situation could
be improved and the character of her obliga
tion greatly benefited.
England desires to construct a series of
great central electric power stations. She has all
the means of doing that within herself, but ha9
not the economic courage to start on such a great
enterprise in the face of a situation where
we may demand from her hundreds of mil
lions of dollars a year if our claims were to
be realized in payments made in the United
States.
She eould readily undertake such construc
tion if for the time being she did not have to
export goods Into our market to meet our
claim. She would increase her productive
capacity, employ her Idle workmen, put fresh
courage Into her industrial and economic sit
uation by doing this, and we would have in
addition to the obligation we now have thf
further security of the great power plants
which were created.
* * * *
There is nothing really novel about KU?h k
program?the only novelty lies in the applica
tion to national obligations of those principles
which a wise creditor would apply to a tem
porarily disabled debtor. Help put the debtor
on his feet. Give him fresh courage. Give
him a start toward increasing his earning
capacity and the prospect of ultimate debt
liquidation is improved. That sort of thing
is done every day as between individual debtor
and creditor. The difficulty seems to lie in
thinking of the subject in international terms.
Quite another question is raised in connec
tion with the carrying out of such a project.
It is asked whether in view of the mess that
governments have already made in conducting
great undertakings it would be possible for
our government to undertake successfully such
a program. If Congress had to pass on each
undertaking, if the projects were handled
after the manner in which we improve inland
waterways and construct public buildings, I
would say. No. The work would need to be
handed over to a properly constituted com
mission. I have sufficient faith in American
genius to believe that we could properly con
struct such a commission. I have put it
briefly by saying that I would put Herbert
Hoover at the head o? It, and would rest easy
about the results. We have many such men of
high motives, of sound imagination, of tech
nical expertness, who would render in such a
connection a very great international service.
* * * *
Some amazingly good work has been done in
Kurope by Americans in the days since the
armistice. They have shown such a sense of
'fairness, such a grasp of method, such an
ability to organize the forces there into self
helpfulness that I know we could successfully
undertake such a program as X have outlined
if we could put some of our best men at the
job. The man who fears that we cannot trust
the character, good sense and ability of Amer
icans to undertake a work of this kind has
less faith in his fellow countrymen than 1
have. I believe that we can.
The great task would only devolve grad
ually. At best we can only get a portion of
this interest paid at once. We would only
have to #an expenditure as rapidly as in
come developed. I feel profoundly certain,
however, that sensibly to start on the program
will result in rapidly developing the ability of
our debtors to pay. With such a program
wisely carried out they can, in time, discharge
their full obligations to us. ? Some part I
would certainly expend with no obligation for
its direct Return. We are talking now about
remitting the debt, about sealing It, or about
cutting down the Interest for a period to a
nominal rate. All that means giving up some
thing. If we are willing to do that, why
should we not give It up with the same gen
erosity, but with much greater wisdom, by
inslsting that the full amount be devoted to
the rehabilitation of the e#>nomlc life of Eu
rope and toward Invigorating Its social wel
fare?
Even if we get no direct return from some
of the earlier Interest payments, the Indirect
return would be greater than a direct return,
for It would give the Impetus,-the confidence,
the start toward self-helpfulness that Europe
must have If the gravest gangers are to be
avoided.
How Arms Conference Looks
From Outside Looking In
BY C. GOULD LIJTCOLV
THE Washington conference on
the limitation of armament
from the inside, looking out,
will be public only when a
member of the American or some
Other delegation undertakes to write
his story of the conference.
The Washington conference from
the outside, looking in, is another
matter. The whole world, generally
speaking, is engaged in this occupa-,
tlon. More particularly, however,
there are 485 newspaper correspond
ents accredited to the conference, en
deavoring daily to give the news of
the conference, to interpret such
glances of the eye as may come their
way and to get the "atmosphere."
Besides these observers for the press
of the world there are gathered in j
Washington observers for various'
political factions in the nations of I
the world, not to mention the ac- I
credited diplomatic corps, who are I
keeping, their countries informed of
the trend of events. Of the 4S5 cor
respondents accredited to the confer
ence, eighty-seven of them 'are from
overseas?as far as Australia, Japan.
China and India.
? * * *
Looking at the conference from the
outside, there are various points from
which a view may be taken. First,
there are the plenary, or open ses
sions, of which there have been four
up to the present time. Second, there
are the conferences which the spokes
men of various delegations hold daily
with the newspaper men?and women.
Third, there are the more private con
versations which the newspaper men
obtain Individually with delegates or
persons attached to the delegations.
In view of the demands from many
sources that the conference be con
ducted with the utmost publicity pos
sible, it may be said that the wish
for publicity is being granted in a
very large measure.
In fact, when Secretary Hughes,
headr of the American delegation,
made his memorable address at the
first session of the conference, which
was "open," the world was aston
ished at the frankness in which he
laid the cards on the table with refer
j ence to limitation of naval arma
ments. But necessarily. It was found,
closed sessions of the conferees
must be held at which the delegates
could obtain information regarding
various proposals advanced and give
their views In a more or less intimate
way
* * # ?
t
At the outset, therefore, a plan I
was adopted by which the conference
meets in committee of the whole, for
the express purpose of obtaining in
formation, and for preparing the
various delegations for action. These
I committee meetings, it was explained I
'by the highest authority, are pre-J
I paratory to further open meetings
I' at which discussion and final action
may be taken by the conference on
the major matters to which it is giv
ing its attention. There are two major
committees of the conference?one
on the limitation of armaments, com
posed of members of the delegations
of the five powers meeting on this
subject?the United States. Great
Britain, France, Italy and Japan?and
th? other on the problem of the far
east, composed of the delegations of
the nine powers taking part in dis
cussions of those problems, the five I
already mentioned and Belgium. Hoi- j
land, Portugal and China. In a way. I
this method of procedure follows Hie I
ordinary parliamentary procedure of I
the Benate and House, which first
consider measures in subcommittees,
usually behind closed doors, then In
committee of the whole in their re
spective houses, usually with . the
doors open, and finally in the "Sen
I ate" and in the "Home," the final pir
j liamentary stare.
I * * * *
With this method of precedure ??f
;the conference, it is impossible iu
| bring forth agreements made in
j secret, in completed ptage, without
any notice to the peoples of the
! countries affected thereby. And in
| this feature the Washington confer
I ence is vastly different from the Ver
sailles peace conference, or any other
international conference held In the
past, when the destines of nations
have been involved.
At the conclusions of the committc
meetings, there is issued a formal
communique." in the phraseology of
Europe, or "statement" in the Ameri
can language. These statements giv*
in succinct form what has transpired
behind closed doors. Sometimes these
statements are lengthy, giving in
complete detail the proposals ad
vanced by different delegations, and
the replies made by others, as for in
stance. when the Chinese delegation,
| in the committee on the far east, laid
down its "ten principles" or proposals
l regarding the demands of China.
* * * *
In addition to the major committer*
of the conference, there have been
appointed so far nine subcommittees,
j some of them composed of principal
delegates to the conference and otlier.s
made up of experts accompanying the
delegations. These subcommittees are

LLOYD GEORGE?The Man
I
t "VII?Italy, Russia and the East
of the greatest difficulties which con
'fronted the peace conference arose out of *
^ireaties signed between the allies during the
<frar. It was the eternal problem of reconcil
Jnff contracts with altered circumstances.
Dlovd George held strongly that it would he
for nations to start repudiating treaties as
^od^as they did not suit their interests or because
tjhfcy. were incompatible with an ideal solution.
'fCotfchfngr in his opinion would contribute more to
Jthe bitterness and uncertainty which de
5;<?P5^'^1|itcrnational confidence and make co-opera
tfyrx tnjpossible. Treaties were the laws governing
toflferfiational conduct, and. as such, ought to be
as very sacrosanct.
the other hand, he considered that- a selfish
PKlatitic insistence on treaty rights was almost
as repudiation. Circumstances were always
Stanslag. and as they changed laws and treaties
Mttbe changed, too. He never hesitated, there
utge modification on the parties to a treaty
?^il^ -he contended that modification must be by?
Upstfni
'T Not only -was consent the only road to further
agreed modifications later on, it was the only way
of securing execution. Peace conferences have no
executive power, except against the enemy. Execu
tion of decisions, therefore, depends upon the vol
untary action of the parties concerned.
* * * *
These difficulties came to a head over the Italian
frontiers and China. In 1913 a treaty had been
signed between Italy. Russia, Great Britain and
France, whereby Italy undertook to come into the
war, while the allies undertook to support in the
eventual negotiations for peace her claims to a
large part of Dalmatia and also to certain other
advantages In the eastern Mediterranean. The
treaty Was reasonable at the time. It secured the
assistance of Italy in freedom's great struggle with
German autocracy and militarism. The frontiers
a freed to were fair as a strategic protection against
tti# great Austro-Hungarian empire. The total
disappearance of the Hap.sburg'monarchy, however,
and the emergen.-e of the idea of nationality as
Hie basis of the European se^tlepient changed the
situation.
President Wilson, who was bound by no treaty,'
naturally stood out for frontiers between Italy
and her neighbors corresponding to the nationality
line, both on the ground that it was Juttt in iOeeff
and because it was necessary to lasting peace fti
southeastern Europe. Orlando demanded steadily
hi* rights under the treaty?and Flame in addition.
France and Great Britain were torn in two: on the
sae hand th?y held tiieuiseives iiound uy the
treaties tlicy had signed; on the other they sym
pathized with the American View as to what was
the wise and right thing to do.
* * * *
The dispute was long and a basis for com
promise difficult to find. Finally Wilson announced
that he would negotiate no longer, but would pub
lish his case and appeal to the world. Llojd
George urged him to delay. He pointed out that
Orlando was not the difficulty, but the intense
national sentiment* of Italy which refused to evacu
ate the territory concerned, and that publication
would only harden that sentiment and make agree
ment impossible. Wilson agreed to a postpone
ment for a couple of days. Lloyd George then set
to work once more to try to bring Orlando and
Wilson nearer to agreement. He had got some
way and was hnpeful of success, when the news'
came fhat Wilson's letter had been published on
the stroke of time.! As he had predicted, the effect
of the letter was not to influence the Italian peo
ple toward moderation, but to excite them to fury.
Orlando announced his intention of going imme
diately to Rome to consult his parliament. "Lloyd
George urged him not to go. He told him that he
would have a triumphal journey, but that his
triumph would make his own fall certain as soon
as the excitement had died down and compromise
was again in the air. But Orlando insisted, had
his triumph, and within a few weeks had fallen
from office. Eventually, two years later, the ques
tion was settled by direct agreement between Italy
and Jugoslavia very much on the lines of the com
promise Lloyd George had endeavored to bring
about.
* * * *
The second difficult case was over Shantung
and the Pacific Islands. In January, 1917. when
the Germans started the unlimited submarine war
the allied admiralties were at their wits' end to find
anti-submarine craft. There was only Japan to
turn to. Japan consented to send torpedo boats
to protect the Mediterranean sea routes, but on con
dition that France and Great Britain agreed to
support their claims to inherit German rights
in the far east north of the equator in the final
settlement. The admiralties were insistent that
this naval assistance was vital, and in February
the assurance was given, Japan at the same time
undertaking to support any claim Britain might
make to inherit German rights In the southern
Paoiflc. It is curious to think that had thie United
States declared war two months earlier the assur
ance pledging the Freiich and British attltude*would
never have been given.
When the peace conference, therefore, came to
tieul with Die matter France and Great Britain
found themselves in the same situation as in Mie
case of Italy. The difficulty was further increased
by the fact that the Chinese, who, despite their
numbers, had evolved no effective stregnth of their
own, had also made treaties yielding rights to
Japan In Shantung. Japan, therefore, had a good
legal case, though the Chinese urged that these
treaties had been obtained by force majeure.
* * * *
President Wilson stood out for the full Chinese
claims, the Japanese for their full treaty rights.
In between stood M. Clemenceau and Mr. Lloyd
George, refusing to repudiate their treaty obliga
tions, but endeavoring to arrange a compromise.
As usual in politics, it was not a question of de
ciding what was ideally right, but of what it was
possible to persuade Japan, who was in possession,
to agree to execute. It was Lloyd George's view
that the best practicable plan 'was to make an
agreement which definitely re-established. Chinese
sovereignty in Shantung, created Kalo-Chao a
treaty port, but left Japan with Germany's eco
nomic rights defined under a treaty guarantee.
This was substantially the plan eventually agreed
upon. The Chinese delegates, however, taking the
view that such an agreement was incompatible with
their independence, refused to sign the treaty,
which fell to the ground, and the Japanese re
mained in occupation.

The Russian problem brooded over the whole
conference like a nightmare. At one of its opening
meetings Lloyd George said that the peace confer
ence would fail to be worthy of its name unless
it did something to restore peace to Russia. Hence
the proposal to bring together representatives of
the allies, of the bolsheviks and of Denlken and
Koltchalk at Prinkipo to discuss the basis of a
peaceful settlement.
Lloyd George has always taken a rather un
orthodox view of the Russian situation. A lifelong
liberal, he had no sympathy with the tsat^st
regime; a keen student of the French revolution,
he had an instinctive grasp of the forces at' woifk
and of the way in which things would >work out.
He was never afraid of bolshevism as such. He
thought the fervor of the revolutionary enthusiasm,
with'its madly idealist experiments and awful ter
rorism, would gradully yield to the facta of life,
and settle down to much the same kind of govern
ment, only under new labela, that Bwia had hftd
before. He used often to draw comparisons, indeed,
between the Russian and French revolutions, be
tween Lenin and Trotaky, and Robespierre and
Marat, to the great indignation of'his Frtnch- c#l
lerffcues. His view always was that the best
course would be to get all parties together aud try
to Induce them to stop fighting and combine In re
building Russia on better lines.
But peace was impracticable. Neither the bol
sheviks nor the old Russians were really ready to
meet, because neither was willing to yield any part
of Russia to the other, and the allies were deeply
divided themselves aa to the policy to be pursued.
So the civil war in Russia continued, with the al
lies alternating between the policy of helping the
anti-bolsheviks and toying with fresh proposals
for peace. And to the end of the conference Rus
sia remained what, to a great extent it still re
mains, an unsolved enigma.
* * * *
The last problem whloh confronted the confer
ence was that of the near east and the German
colonies. It raised the mandatory question in an
acute form. It was clear that many peoples in
the world, especially in Afrioa, were still quite
Incapable of conducting a stable government under
the fierce pressure of modern political and economic
competition. Some civilised power must take
charge and supervise their government until they
had learned how to govern themselves. President
Wilson wished to enshrine this principle in the
peace by transferring all German colonies and
Turkish territories to the league of nations, and
making It govern them direct. France and Britain
both thought the league incapable of doing such
work. Clemenceau advocated out-and-out annexa
tion by a civilized power, Lloyd George an inter
mediate system whereby the mandatory power
should be responsible to the league of nations,
which should have the duty of seeing that it lived
up to its responsibilities. It was on these lines
that the solution embodied In article 21 of the
covenant was based.
So far as the German colonies were concerned
it was then decided that the powers which had
fought the German forces should become the man
datory powers. The real difficulty arose over the
near east. Was Constantinople to be international
ized. and, if so, who was to provide the police and
.military forces necessary for Its protection? How
were the Greek and other minorities to be protected
in Turkey? What about Armenia, where, in an
area which had once been Armenian, the Armenians
were now, largely, thanks to massacre. In a hope
less minority, and, therefore, incapable of maintain
ing a government. A mandatory was the only so
lution, yet who was to be that mandatory? Then
there were the rights of Italy under the treaty
of London, the aspirations of Greece, the strong
divergence between Great Britain and Franoe as
to their respective mandatory spheres in Arabia,
the desire of the Arab intelligentsia to run before
they had learned to stand, and last, but by no
means least, the Balfour declaration and the Zion
ist aspirations In Palestine.
The problem was Intolerably complex. Which
ever way one turned one met an Insurmountable
difllculty. Lloyd George thought that the key to
the solution was that the United States should be
given the free hand to deal with Constantinople.
Turkey and Armenia, as she chose, but the other
allies were opposed, and it gradually became clear
that the United States was against taking any kind
of mandatory responsibility at all. Eventually the
conference dispersed with nothing done, and left
the supreme council to attempt to patch things to
gether by degrees.
* * * *
Who took the predominant part In the settlement
of Versatile*? The question admits of no precise
answer. Facts were, as always in politics, the de
cisive thlngB. No statesman, however eminent and
strong, can alter them, and the peace of Paris was
fundamentally governed by the facts of Europe at
the time. None the less, the personal factor is im
mensely Important Of personalities at Paris, three
were dominant, Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd
George. They were all strong and able men. No
one of them was in any sense subordinate to or
under the Influence of the other. Each exercised
decisive influence. Wilson was always looking for
ward to a new world. Clemenceau looked back
ward, seeing Europe as it was and thinking that
it would remain what it had always been. Lloyd
George stood between the two, always anxious to
move forward, but refusing to go ahead of what
he thought the people could stand, and day after
day shaping conclusions Into practical reforms.
The combination was a good one. The peace would
have been a bad peace had any of the three ele
ments been missing.
Lloyd George clearly saw that the peace had
many defects.. There w^rs features In it which
he would have alte.ed. But he thought that on
the whole It was as good as it was reasonable to
expect victorious nations to agree to so near to
the termination of a world war. Some of the
worst dangers, such as the dismemberment of Ger
many, had been avoided. Other difficult features
connected with the Saar valley and the occupation
of German territory were temporary. Looking, as
always, at the practical possibilities of the time.
Lloyd George thought that the foundation of a
new and better Europe had been truly laid.
.. ? * * '? ?
In the first place, Instead of the Hohenzollem
and Hapsburg military despotisms, democracy had
prevailed right np to the Kusslhn border. The fact
?that governments were now at last amenable to
Hie peoples lUey governed was. In Lloyd George's
opinion, the greatest single safeguard agatnst.wf I
Democracies may get war mad, and may b?an
fected by racial hatred or greed, but they are m|?'
likely to plot and plan war for reasons of per^pl
profit and aggrandizement as are governments*
trolled by courtier or military cliques.
Secondly. Europe, for the first time, was fod
fairly and squarely upon nationality. There
great economic disadvantages in the solution,^
everybody now sees. But the greatest canlcpjMin
the old system, the cutting up of nationaltluMjL
tween conflicting autocratic empires, had beeh^wt
moved.
Thirdly, the idea had been definitely laid down
in the peace that war was the concern of all Ra
tions, and that they must combine to try to Jjfe
vent It by conference and negotiation bef&re hav
ing recourse to force. Lloyd George did not thitnU
the machinery of the league was perfect, butjhe
wag convinced that the idea for which it ataqds
had come to stay. i
Finally, a commencement had been made with
disarmament. Conscription had been abolished in
central Europe. As we have seen, Lloyd Geo^J'
endeavored to induce the allies to enter into aSfst
arrangement about armaments at Paris. Tht
Washington conference, Indeed, la giving effect a<
a more seasonable time to what Lloyd George had
originally proposed.
* * * *
For the rest. Lloyd George has too keen a his
torical sense to believe that any settlement could
bring a millennium or attempt to make one which
could be final. Every treaty, every peace is but a
milestone, registering the position at this time,
but the highway runs on all the time, and It is ai
further milestones along that highway that the
ideals disappointed in 1919 will come to fruition.
It is the fashion today to decry the work or
the peace conference. History will probably re
verse that judgment. If anything, the peace con
ference was ahead of its times. It planned a set
tlement which contained within itself no seeds of
fresh war, and it created machinery designed to
adjust international differences by conference and
conciliation The hopes of mankind have been
frustrated not so much because the settlement
was bad. but because the nations have not been
able to live up to it. Passion, fear and prejudice
still 'dominate the old world, and Indifference and
s^lf-centeredness the new. Had the nations set to
work to make the best of the peace and of the
machinery it created, instead of crabbing it and
settling back into their old grooves, things might
be far better than they are today.
