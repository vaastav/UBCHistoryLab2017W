That Ballinger whitewash was
rubbed on too thick to be healthy or
comfortable.
The undertone of President Taft's
message seemed to indicate a hope
less submission to the inevitable
the failure of his administration and
a purpose to make the best of it by
a do-nothing policy that would make
things' no worse than they are, from
the president's viewpoint. Now
comes word from Washington to the
effect that the president's own party
is on the brink of destruction with
the old guard determined to stand
pat and the insurgents equally bent i
on forcing action. The first clash is !

consolation that can come in such :
a dark hour, the tributes that are ;
paid by those who knew Mrs. Mc-i
Kinney for so many years and the !
memory which must be dear to her
husband's heart, will be as a light
in the shadow of the valley through
which he is passing.

country in the world, a condition
that is viewed with nraszemeTH by
all foreigners and endured by our
own people with a patience which
is a serious reflection upon their
good sense. It is surely a matter of
tremendous import that in thi Unit

for the loss of a billion dollars a

German Boys' Work Problem-When-
an American boy leaves
schooj he does not always know what
sort of work he wants or which he
is fit for. Or even when he knows
exactly what kind of a job he desires,
he often does not know at all how
to find it. Such a job as he aims
for may not exist within his oppor
tunities of place and time. So the boy.
leaving school, may drifc into an un
suitable occupation, or worse, into
no occupation at all. in spite of an
honest wish, originally, to work.
In Germany they order these
things better, the Detroit 'Free Press
says. That admirable study of
"The German Workman," the work
of the Munich labor bureau for boys
leaving school is recorded. Munich
teachers became interested in finding
suitable work for their boys in 1906,
and now the bureau, with their help,
for its construction, and while the - ' "y - V

has grappled with the- question more
successfully.
Every year printed schedules of
comprehensive questions are sent to
every head teacher of the Munich
schools to be distributed among the
pupils who are going to leave the
schools that year.
The pupils are asked to put them
selves in communication with the
municipal labor bureau, which will
advise them as to the choice of a
vocation and give them the best
chance possible to secure work.
Yearly circulars are also sent to
all the trade guilds and other labor
societies, to enlist their coopera
tion. The children respond readily to
the aid given them. Boys come by
dozens to the office of the bureau
In search of positions as appren
tice or beginner. Each 'brings a
form of application, filled up by him
self but signed by his teacher.
When the bureau finds a place for
him he is notified by a post card and
he presents himself foe examination
by the employer wherever and when
ever the latter may appoint.
Whether the boy takes the job or
not, he must report to the bureau
the result of the Interview; and this
goes on until work is procured which
suits him and which he is able to do.
For the direction of the boys the
labor bureau is prepared, with the
aid of expert employers and medi
cal men, a handsome book of indus
tries open to the boy. This hand
book describes the different kinds
of work, the qualifications necesr.
sary to each, the prospects of pro
motion or steady employment, the
health conditions, the dangers and
difficulties, the cost and time of
mining nnri ovrvthln eis which
the boy and his parents ought to
know before choosing his career.
! Initiative anil Referendum in Oregon.
Thirty two questions involving
matters of public policy were sub
imitts.l to a referendum voted in Ore-
j gon at the recent election. It was
; objected in advance of their submis- J
i sion, by the foes of popular govern-i
rnent. that it was folly to expect the
voters to pass intelligently on all the ;

I justifies the faith of those who be- j

LONDON. A group of prehistoric dwellings, believed to be the most ancient in thev. United Kingdom, la being
destroyed, and apparently there is no moans of saving them. On the jummit of the Penmaenmawr mountain
is a prehistoric fortified town or camp, Fralch-y-DInas (the arm of the mountain). Built by the Britons tome 2,600
years ago, ths camp is now doomed; slowly but surely, bit by bit, it is being eaten away by the enormous gran
ite quarries on th? north fce of the mountain. The Penmaenmawr mountain Is a headland on the Carnarvon
shire coast, rising 1,500 feet almost perpendicularly from the sea. Archaeologists say th town on Its summit
was built by the Gaels in the iron age of possibly very late in the bronze age; that la, during the period from about
600 B. C. to 100 A. D. The walls and dwellings which form the camp are constructed of stones laid In dry
courses. The Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire has been unable to pre
serve this camp intact, but members of the commission have paid several visits to Penmaenmawr so that eome
record may exist when the camp is no more.'

DESTRUCTION OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST HOUSES
The Argus Daily Short Story
Esr Christmas 'Pudding By Clarissa Mackie.
Copyrighted. 1910. by Associated XJtersjry Press.
Tied snugly in a round bag, the
Christmas pudding bubbled merrily in
the big pot on the gas range. Young
Mrs. Bell tripped lightly to and fro
about the tiny kitchen, her heart full
of Y'uletlde cheer and gentle gracious
ness. It was her first Christmas as a
housewife, and the little flat was spick
and span with cleanliness.
I,aura Bell lifted the pot Hd and
peered at the fragrant pudding.
"Tu lin t tJior slnoQ ezmoll hficf-

the lid and proceeded to wash the
mountainous array of dishes in the
sink. '! never believed I could antici-
; pate an enjoyable Christmas away
; from Lakeville and the home folks, but
I begin to thing we two are going to
. have a loyely time, even if we are all
; alone in this bfg, strange city."
: That night at dinner Timothy Bell
leaned back in his chair and surveyed
! the remains of his excellent meal with
! manifest approval.
"So the pudding was a success,
j dear?" he inquired.
j "Light as a feather, and so spicy!"
I said his wife proudly. "I'd show it to
! you, Tim. only I've tied it up again
and put it out on the fire escape to
j keep cold. I shall boil it for an hour
tomorrow, .!ist before dinner, so it wiil
be piping hot."
"Now this is Christmas eve. Do you
want to go out tonight?"
"I'd like to go out and mingle with
the crowds, although my own shop
ping was finished a week ago. It
seemed strange to prepare my gifts so
early and send them through the mail
instead of running around with tberu
the way I've always done in Lake
ville. I rather miss the excitement
and fun of it all. Now, Timothy, dear,
don't look so solemn. IJeally I d rath
er be here in New York with you to
day than away out in Minnesota with
everybody else If you were not there.
"I've a mind to try it on every man,
woman and child I meet in the corri-
A BLESSED OLD PUDDING."
dors tomorrow," said Laura daringly
as she cleared away the meal. "What
do you suppose they would say ?"
fiiiil
-iobably complain to the Janitor,"
grinned Timothy, gathering a pile of
dishes and whisking them Into the
kitchen. "Hurry up, sweetheart. Let
the dishes wait till we come home.
Get on your things and let's Join the
crowd. If we can't have a Lakeville
Christmas we'll have the New Tork
kind, eh?"
"Of course we will," agreed his
wife.
The Bells enjoyed their excursion
into "the shopping districts. The broad
avenues were ablaze with light and
color, and the moving multitudes of
Christmas purchasers formed con
stantly changing pictures that delight
ed the country "bred, eyes of Timothy
and his wife. More than once Timo
thy's hand went down into his pocket
to add a mite to some Salvation Army
kettle on a corner or to dispense holi
day comfort to some one whose need
of food or warmth was apparent to
his observing glance. Once he ami
Laura convoyed a party of four rag
ged urchins into a little toyshop and
made four children radiantly happy
with simple gifts.
When they reached home again the
clocks were striking 11 and Laura's
eyes were sparkling with happiness,
while Timothy felt a quiet satisfaction
in the pleasure the evening had brought
them. As they waited for the elevator
a young man and a girl entered the
building and stood near them.
Timothy's keen glance noted that the
man was well dressed, but rather thin
ly clad for the season. Ills face was
thin and pale, as if he had recently
been ill. while his dark eyes wore a
brooding, discouraged expression that
was out of keeping with the spirit of
the approaching festival. The girl, who
wore a wedding ring on one slender
ungloved hand, watched him with a
pretty air of motherly anxiety. She
was a brown little thing, with hair
and eyes of a warm russet hue and a
charming face that attracted Laura
Bell's attention.
As they glided up In the elevator
Laura found herself watching the girl
with Interest There was a sad look
when the young man's glance was
turned away from her uplifted face,
and Lanra noted little tense lines about,
the mobile lips. The elevator stopped
at the Bells floor, and as they left the
car Mrs. Bell turned with a sudden
impulse and nodded in the friendliest
manner at the little brown girl.
"Merry Christmas!" she called.
The door slammed as the car mount
ed up, but the brown girl leaned for
ward and called back In a low, sweet
voice, "Merry Christmas to you!"
"I did it. Timothy," sang Laura as
they entered their own cozy flat. "1
knew some of these flat dwellers were
human even if you doubted it."
"Wrong again and glad of it this
time," admitted Timothy as he turned
up the gas in the parlor. "Now, Laura,
how about those dishes?"
"They must be done tonight." de
clared Mrs. Bell, tying a large apron
about her BleniiT form. "There won't
be a thing to & tomorrow except to
roast the cnicKen. heat up the puaulng
and cook some vegetables."
Lanra went to the window that
opened on a fire escape and raised it.
Then she uttered a faint shriek of
dismay and turned to Ler husband.
"It's gone!" she cried dramatically.
"What the pudding?" Timothy ap
proached the window rnd made a care
ful examinationof the impromptu re
frigerator. "Nothing here; not a blamed
pudding of any kind." he reported.
' Sure you didn't bring it inside and
forget about it?"
Laura opened the pantry door and
revealed its cupboard-like Interior.
There were the plump chicken and the
delicately tinted celery and the crim
son cranlerry sauce and bowl of fruit,
but there was no sign of that snugly
bagged plum pudding that was to be the
.chef d'oeuvre of the Christmas feast.
.The hour that followed was an ex
citing one for the Bells. They searched
high and low, In the most impossible
places, for the delectable pudding that
Laura had made, but in vain. At last
Timothy went down to the basement
and consulted the genial janitor, who
listened with Interest to his tale of
woe, but offered no solace.
It was after 7 o'clock on Christmas
morning when Laura was awakened
by a ringing of the hall bell. Throw
ing on a warm wrapper and thrustinr.
her feet into furry slippers, she ha;
tened into the narrow hall, careful not
to disturb her sleeping husband.
Laura opened the door the merest
crack and peered inquisitively through.
What she saw caused her to throw the
door open with cordial hospitality.
"Merry Christmas! Come in, do."'
she 6aid to the little brown girl who
stood there, looking rather pale and
frightened.
"For just a moment. There Is some
thing I must explain." She slipped in
side and sank into the chair that Lau
ra offered. "I know you will think it
strange that I have come, a perfect
6tranger, but the janitor said you had
lost a pudding."
"I have. Did you find it?" cried
Laura eagerly. "It's the greatest mys
tery what has become of it."
The girl smiled sadly, and a flash
reddened her cheek for a brief in
stant and was gone. "I shall have to
tell you about ourselves," she said,
with dignity, "so that you will under
stand why we have eaten half of
your pudding. We're all alone, both
of us, and we've bad bad luck ever
since we were married. In September
Paul was taken down with typhoid
fever and lost his position as book
keeper. He's just able to get around
now and look for work, and he hasn't
been at all successful. Things have
been going from bad to worse, aDd
we're going to move out the first of
the year. We've beeii running low for
a long time, and for the last two days
we haven't had much to eat, so there--just
milk or something like that. To
night before we went out the dumb
waiter whistle sounded, and when I
opened the slide there was our bottle
of milk, with a plum pudding in a bag.
"I thought honestly 1 did that some
body had sent it up to us, though
we're not acquainted with a soul here,
and so I heated it up, and we ate half
of it. It was lovely. A little while
ago the janitor came and inquired if
we'd seen a plum pudding, so I came
right down to tell you, as Paul Is
asleep. I don't know what to say to
you."
"Don't you dare say another word
about that pudding," commanded Lau
ra. "If you only knew how lonesome
we are today you and your husband
would come down and spend the day
with us. We were wishing we knew
somebody in the house here to ask.
I'm so thankful about that pudding.
Why, If I hadn't put It in the dumb
waiter Instead of the Are escape (I'm
very abseniminded when I'm busy)
you would never have received it. and
we might never have been acquainted.
Isn't It a blessed old pudding?"
These two lonely young women hug
ged each other delightedly, and after
ward Laura went to arouse Timothy
that he might accompany her to the
floor above, where the Robinsons lived,
and add his persuasions to bear
against the pride of Mr. Paul Robin
son. "You might fiDd a position for him
In the ofGce, Timothy," suggested his
wife hopefully.
"I think that will be easy," prom
ised Mr. Bell.
It was a merry little gathering that
did justice to Laura's Christmas din
ner. The tragedy that was beneath
the eating of half the pudding was
quite forgotten in the joy of the pres
ent and the hopeful outlook for the
future. When the day wns over and
the Robinsons had returned to their
rooms, cheered In mind and purse by
Timothy's delicately proffered gener
osity, Laura slipped her hand in her
husband's arm and leaned her head
against him, saying:
"It's been different from any Christ
mas I ever spent. Timothy, and I've
been wondering what might have hap
pened to them if that blessed pudding
hadn't opened the way."

Preserves Natural
Color of the Hair
(From Woman's Nntionnl Mac;rinP.)
"Any woman can postpone for years
the time when her hair becomes thin
and gray. It is a mistake to shampoo
frequently with soap and water, as
that tends to make the scalp scaly and
hard and the hair dull and faded.
"The hair will respond quickly to
the proper home treatment. Put in a
fruit jar four ounces of orri3 root and
four ounces of therox. Shake until
well mixed. Once or twice a week
sprinkle a little of ihis powder on the
head and brush it throroughly through
the hair.
"This dry shampoo removes dirt,
dust and dandruff from the scalp and
leaves the hair fresh, sweet and clean.
The therox helps to grew beautiful hair
and preserves its natural color."
