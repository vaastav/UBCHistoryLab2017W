The marked distinction made In flavor of the offi
cers of engineers by the sixty-third Article of
War has been the causa of a great deal of nunc tiler;
but when taken in connection with the ninety-sixth
artiole, I am satisfied that within "the Hue of
their Immediate prolPMinn" the* are aa much sub
ject to orders as the officers of the Quartermaster's
Department. To place them on duty outside
the sphere of their proiessioual duties is,
lu my opinion, all that was ever intended
by the sixty-third article as requiring the
orden of me President; yet the conclusion
arrived at by the committee la the interpretation
which engineers, officers themselves, have usually
placed 011 the law. and for this reason in the nuw
Articles of War the one In question is omitted alto
gether. For my part 1 have no wish to command
the engineer corps or any other corps, but If It forms
a part or liio reuular army of the United SUtes It la
all-importajit that the generals who command the
military departments, and aro charged with the gen
eral supervision of all army matters within their
limits, should be able to avail themselves o( this most
important branch ot the army, receive from them the
usual raporta or the slate i\I the national deicncos,
Ac., wituout asking it as u special lavor or applying
to the President tor his penutsstou In each case.
Boino or tho other "reiorins" suggested in this Con
gressional report havo already been made.
The 1'resideut has, by an executive order, recuced
the civilian employes or tho Quartermaster's De
partment trorn n,?T'i men to 4,ouu, and these are not
subject to the personal command of the Quarter
master ooneral, but are, m fact, teamsters and
laborers, hired In the distant Territories under tne
supervision of the local quartermasters, and under
the control ol' the military department comuiande/a.
lu like manner the number of ordnance enlisted
workmen has been reduced from 1,101 to 144, and to
department commanders has ooen given the super
vision of tne recruiting depots in ail essential mat
ters, except the final assignment ot recruits to regi
ments, which is controlled here by the uenerai-in
Chief, who can best Judge where the recruits are
most needed.
Aa to the consolidation of the staff corps and
departments, discussed lu this report, I feel disposed
to concur with Ueperal Thomas in bis opinion as given
lu evidence on page thirteen of this "Report on Army
Organizatlon," that it would hardly be wise to make
this change to the extent which tne counnmeo seems
to favor, lhe Chief signal Officer might be attached
to the engineer corps or to one of the staff depart
ments, and the forty post chaplains now In ser
vice ungtit be aasigued one to each of the forty regi
ments which now compose the army. I would
doem It advisable to ailow tne other corps and
departments to remain unchanged, except with such
limits as to the number and rank of otllcers as con
gress may adjudge proper, in numbers and rank tney
do seem disproportioned to the line of tne army, but
this has been tho case for a number ol years, and
the experience ot the war of the rebellion demon
strated its wisdom. A staff system that has admit
ted an increase of the liue ot tue army lrom the
mere nuclous of 1880 to a million of men, and tho
reduction back to the present standard wltnout con
fusion and with the most perfect accountability as
to properly and money?at all times providing for
the army abundantly? is entitled to our respect.
1 havo therefore.laid before you the annual reports
t>f the heads of ail tho stuff corps and departments,
but nave noted certain mailers lu them especially
Directing tho army itself that I now beg leave to
ler to.
The Quartermaster General shows that the dis
bursements ol Ins department have fallen $14,600,(100
below tuove of tlie previous year. This department
Is more ailucted b, the scattered condition of the
troops and the peculiar sterile character of tho coun
try iu which tuey are kept than uuy other, if the
army could lie concentrated and quartered in the
region of Hupplle^ the expenses coiuu bo kept down
to a comparatively small Bum; or if we had, as in
former years, u single line or jrentier a little in ad
vance or the settlements, the same or simiiai would
ne thu result; but now, from the nature of the case
our troops are scattered by companies to posts iu
tho most Inhospitable parts or the Continent, to
winch every article ol food, lorage, clouting, ammu
nition, Ac., must he hauled in wagons hundreds of
miles ut. gt eac cost. For the same reason this de
partment is heavily taxed bv the cost of fuel ami
materials for making huts, sometimes at a distance
ol ioo or iiOU in lies from a place where a growing
twig aa large as a walking stick oau be louuu.
V hbo tne pay and allowances of a soldier remain
the same m all parts of the country the cost of his
maiuteuanee in Texas, New .Mexico, Arizona. Ne
vada, Idaho, Montana and Alaska is two aud threo
times as great as on the Kansas aud Nebraska iron
tier. if. tuererore, tne estimates must be made to
approximate those ol tne ante-war period, wo may
be rorced to withdraw our troops from all or a larire
part or the Territories named. I have personal
knowledge that the huts in which our troops are
rorced to live are in some places inferior to what
horses usually have lu this city. Nearly a.l ol these
posts are temporary lu their nature and character;
but as time progresses aud roads become established
wo can choose the real strategic points, and at wioso
wo should have good quarters lor troops, and I hopo
tho (secretary will ask a liberal appropriation, suo
Ject to his control, lor tho erection of the accessary
barracks.
in referenco to tho report of the Commissary
General, Ueneral Eaton, it is proper tout 1 should
say that the army has beeu well supplied with good
healthy mod, and at ult the posts are kept supples of
articles not embraced in tne ration, ior sale to the
companies ano the officers' families at a price suffi
cient to ie:iui urse the department. Tins ooviates
the necessity tig- sutlers, which are now prohibited
by law, except us mero traders, having no lieu what
ever on the soldier's pay. Thu olilcers of the Sub
sistence Department arc at depots, aud the actual
issues to the troops are made by lino otllcers, styled
acting commissaries of subsistence, who receive an
extra compensation of twenty dollars a mouth, less
tne value of a ration. (Hoe section two, act or Con
gress approved March 2, isz7). From per
sonal experience 1 doubt if it be practi
cable to commission theso officers specially
aa such, or to appoint permanent coraiuis
saiy sergeauts, because ol the cou.-taiit changes of
stations ol our small army; but 1 tuiukthoy should
have a lair compensation ior the extra labor and
risk Imposed on them by these dunes. 1 recom
mend the repeal ol tuo proviso or the second section
hereinbefore referred to, aiul that tne officers acting
aa quartermasters and commissaries of posts re
ceive ten dollars a month where there are two com
panies or less, and twenty dollars a mouth where the
garrison is more than iwo companies.
The Engineer Department has charge of tho con
struction of the permanent forts, the improvement
ot rivers, harbors, and various other duties imposed
by spec ial laws, ao much as refers to the /oris con
cerns the army that must live In them and flgii:
them, and therefore falls within my official province.
All else not directly uilectiug tho army is uoue ol
my business.
General Humphreys gives In great detail the con
dition ol tho various forts with whose construction
alteration nnd repair las department has been en
gaged. Nearly nil tho seacoast forts were planned
ut a time waen the eight-inch gun was the Heaviest
afloat, and before rlflod guns came into use. Now
however, mat ordnance of the ruteeti aud twenty
inch calibres, throwing a shot over 1,000 pounds in
weight, wliit a ve.oclty of 1,500 feet per second, liavo
conw into g> nerui use, tue problem or resistance is
entirely chunked. It is bclirvod tnat casemate loris
no muitct liow rolnioiced with iron, uro not ubl? to
resist these uhot, and changes must bo made to meet
tms change of Jucts. The engineer officers nave
carefuilj studied tills subject and havo niado many
most vaiuabie exoeriments; aud in connection wim
the officers or ordnance an ! artillery, they should
continue theso experiments. Tho Hoard of Engi
neers In New York has laid down Ave general propo
sitions lor application to all modifications ?r the aea
coust fo?ts, whlce I liearuly approve, Viz.
Firs'.?The use of barbette batter.ea of earth, with
deep parapet, and a liberal number of bombproof
and magazine traverses.
.v-ivii .?The use of the heaviest guns practicable,
with carriages admitting of the gun being de.ire -sod

Judgment no armored ship as yet built can long exist

gypsum had laid In the water throe mouths, being
a very great absorbent of water, you or a geologist
could not tell whether it had beeu thero three years
or 300 years; lourth, being ramiliar with gypsum
manifestations aud peculiarities, they know, iroin
their familiarity witn gypsum, that the gypsum
quarries, in the vicinity where the giaut wus sup
posed to be found, did not furnish the gypsum
block for making it, because lis quality is different
and those quarries could not lurulsli u block lartre
enough.
I will give you an outline sketch of the "party"

claiming to be anxious to get into the "gypsum busi

block of it, lake it to New > ork, get up a stock com
pany and "make a good thing of it." Shortlv after
their arrival came rather a stylish man and wile
who boarded lu a private lauiliy. 'i he man soou be

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
Monday, Dec. 8?# P. *?
The speculative feeling ut the beginning of busi
ness this morning was almost wholly concentrated
upon the gold market, where, despite the opposition
of the "bears," thq price watt run up from 122% to
123%. The strength put forth on either sido was not
of (^decided character, both parties seeming desir
ous of waiting (or the President's Message and the
reports of his Cabinet oflloers. The earliest tele
grams from Waahiugton were very positive in pre
dicting that thore would he no quorum of Congress,
owing to the detention or members by tho storm.
Tins intelligence was sueoeeded by the heavy snow
storm here, and uiunv ol the chief operators left tho
street and went home, so that the subsequent publi
cation of tho teuor or the Message and reports fell
upon a thin market. The announcement of tho
President's position on the question of redumption
turned tho speculative feeling lu the Gold Room,
iliough for wuat reason it la difllcult to conjecture,
as his plan oi a k ran ual approach to specie payments
is exactly the policy which tne gold "bulls" would
have hnu pursue. Every business man in the coun
try will read with profound satisfaction the
recommendation of General Qrant on this Im
portant subject. His clear, common senate
view of the situation is In keeping with
the mau. and will render hlni popular
with the entire mercantile community. The cliques
in Wall street can derive littlo coinlort from what
be proposes. In fact, the halting speculation in
goid lo-day was tlie result of a second sober thought
on the part of the same parties who begun last week
to lay their plans for a bold movement. Alter tho
price had Been pushed to 123% tney seemed to lack
the courage of sustaining tbo effbrt. especially aa
their numbers were already thlnued by the storm.
It is true the nubsequent dec Hue to 1 22% wia par
t tally tho result of- the advance of our
bonds In London, which had the efleot
of weakening exchange, but the faot remains
that the cliques were nonplussed at tho
situation, aud, after making a ratuer brililaut sortie,
have fallen back for a council of war. The money
market was ea->y at seven per cent to borrowers on
call with pledge of stock collaterals, but In most in
stance* the leuding government dealers were ac
commodated at six. There is very littlo anxiety as
to tho Immediate future of the money market, aud
ilio impression seems general that at tnls late sea
son, when the cotton crop has taken all tho monoy
that la nece3*ary to its movement, and with little or
no doinnnd from the West, the local supply will bo
more than ample 'or tho balance of the winter. In
commercial paper tnore vt&a no chango, despite tho
announcement of tho suspension of a couple of dry
goods Jobbing houses.
The stock market was strong at the opening, and
prices wore generally In advance of the closing quo
tations of Saturday. Toward noon It became weak
aud fell off at the last board, In sympathy with tho
decline in gold. Tho fluctuations wero not wide, as
tue market lias ranged of late days, and wero made
upon a limited amount of business, the chief opera
tors seeming to await the effcot of the Congressional
documents. Tho dealings after the board snowed an
improvement, aud the latest prices In tho Long
Room were almost up to the best of tho day for tho
leading speculative lavorltes. In the railways there
was a spirited "near" attack on l.ake Shore, and the
price went otr to 85%, the other Western shares going
off at tho same time, lu Chicago and Alton there
was a sharp decline to 141, the stock being under the
manipulation of parties coming from St. Louis. In
tho miscellaneous list I'cclflc Mall was feverish, and
after falltug to 49% rallied to JO?*'. The announce
ment of a semi-annual dividend of only two per
cout on Western Union produced no effect, as the
??inside" party who managed to work the stock up
to 45 last spring by a quurtcrly dividend of the same
figure ure now on l ie outside aud would like to icet
the stock back again, of which they aro, further
more, reported to be largely short.
The government market was excited, particularly
at the noon board, in consequeuco of an advance of
one to one and a half per cent In tho London quota
tions of this uioruUu a3 compared with Saturday.
The foreign bankers wore large buyers on foreign
account, which fact and the simultaneous advance
in gold led to salos of 67's at as hign
as 118%. lu me subsequent transactions at
tlie boar J, as well as on the street, tho
market lost its stiength and yielded to

Tho making oi bills against tho bonds purchased
for export by the foreign bankers weakened the
foreign exchanges, while the strength or t!i<j gold
market. In the earlier hours of business checked the
usual demand from the importers.
The Southern State bonds were feverish and
irregular lu tne Tennessees, which opened heavy
and weak, and after declining to 40% for the new
issues, rallied to 4a X for the same securities. The
North caroliuas wore firmer and advanced a half to
one per cent. The general list was steady and dull.
