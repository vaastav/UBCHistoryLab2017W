A Leading Declaration of the
President's Message.
DEVELOPMENT OF CUBA.
A Suggestion That the Civil Features
of the Government of the Island be
Extended—The National Expansion
Question Treated Cautiously—Con
gress Convenes.
Washington, D. C., Dec. s.—With
(lags floating in the breeze above the
National Capitol, the White House and
other public building?, the city filled
with lawmakers from every state In
the Union, and the galleries crowded
with spectators, Congress opened for
the session of"JO-1900. The throng of
spectators, as usual was at the capitol
early and the scramble for the best
seats from which to watch the open
ing porceedings, was fierce from the
time the doors opened until the gal
leries were completely filled. There was
nowhere near sufficient seating, capac
ity or standing room to accommodate
those who wished to grace tlie occasion
with their presence, and in consequence
of this there were many who had to
content themselves with waiting until
the newspapers could tell them what
had happened within the halls of (,fin
gress on the opening day.
out <>t' respect to the memory of the
late Vice President Hobart the pro
ceedings in both the House and Senate
were made as brief as possible and
after the swearing in of members and
the allotment of seats an adjournment
was taken until Tuesday. The drawing
for seats in the House was attended
with all its usual amusing features.
The elite of the city and the nation
were witnesses to the bits of pleasantry
Indulged in on the floor of the House,
and many of the incidents were of such
a humorous character that there was
an almost continuous uproar of laugh
ter during the two hours this pleasing
feature of the "performance" was on.
What the President Recommends.
Now York, Dec. 3.—A special from
Washington to the New York World
says:
Washington, Dec. s.—une of the
most important features of the third
annual message which President Mc-
Kinley will send to Congress is the
finances of the country. The sugges
tions of the President are distinctly In
favor of a single standard. Gold will
be the keynote of the Administra
tion's plans for governmental pprposts.
"The St. Louis platform of '96 is prac
tically ignored and the most emphatic
language is employed to make manifest
the purposes of the President to stand
unquestionably for currency reform up
on a single standard. The construction
of this part of the President's message
has received more attention than .ill
the other features combined.
"In dealing with national expansion
the President exercises extreme cau
tion, contenting himself with a his
torical narrative of the operations of
the Government in attempting to re
construct the governments of Cuba.
Porto Pico, the Philippines, Hawaii and
Guam. No reference is made to the
treaty which the President has made
with the Sultan of Sulu.
"No recommendations are made con
cerning the sort of government to be
eventually established in the Philip
pines. and no reference is made to the
existence of the so-called Filipino gov
ernment.
"Regarding Cuba the President con
tines his recommendations to a further
development of the government estab
lished there, suggesting an extension of
the civil features of it which have al
ready been experimented on. The
President will say that the condition
of the people of the Islands Is vastly
bett >r than it was before the advent of
the I'nited States.
"Porto Pico, he says, should have a
Territorial form of government similar
to that enjoyed by Arizona, New Mex
ico and Alaska. The people of the isl
and. while not capable of self-govern
ment, he says, ar* entitled to repre
sentatives in Congress and such bene
fits as may accrue from a Territorial
form of government. The President
will also suggest that more moderate
tariff regulations V • provided for Cuba
and Porto Rleo. T! further declares in
favor of laws designed to encourage the
people of those Islands to advanced in
dustry. the free admission of agricul
tural Implements and other articles
necessary to deveb-n their resouves.
"Hawaii the President points to in his
message as an example of what other
colonies may become under favorable
conditions. He suggests a liberal Ter
ritorial form of government for the
Pacific territory. Guam and the new
Samoan Island which the United States
has Inherited do not come In for any
portk ular attention at the hands of the
President, ho believing that they are
both properly conducted.
"The most important of his reflections
on the attitude of this Government to
w*n*d others relates to the nrltish-Fioer
troubles. He expresses his profound
regret at the existence of this trouble,
but skilfully avoids any comment that
may b<- construed to reflect upon.either
Government.
"The President urges Congress to en
.'it the Hanna-Payne shipping bill,
which proposes a subsidy to vessels
rallying American registry. He also
suggests the necessity for the comple
tion <>r the isthmian ennal as soon as
possible "
C=5S Advises on Financial Bill.
Washington. Dee. ".—The Republican
members af the Senate Committee on
finance met Saturday afternoon to
consider a financial bill. Senators Aid
rich. Allison. Piatt of Connecticut.
Wolcott and liurrows were present. Mr.
Piatt, of New York, being the only ab
sentee.
Secretary Gage ■ ent over the gen
eral situation with heiommittee, mak
ing various reconir endations as to the
details of the measure to be introduced.
One of the points discussed was the
advisability of a general refunding of
the bonded debt of the country at a
lower rate of interest than now pre
vailing. The indications are that i
feature of this kind v 111 li« incorporat
ed ill the Senate bill.
It can be definite';* stated that the
Senate measure will make provision for
the maintenance of the gold stand
ard. It is also quite definitely under
stood that the Senate bill will b- an
entirely different measure from that
prepared by the House Republican
Caucus Committee, in phraseology and
detail, and cover some points not in
cluded in that measure.
Henderson Named By Acclamation.
Washington, Dec. 5.- The caucus of
the Republican members of the House
was brief. The selection of a candidate
for Speaker by the party in power usu
ally is an animated affair, but months
ago all the other candidates who en
tared the field after the retirement of
Speaker Reed abandoned the contest,
leaving Colonel David I:. Henderson of
lowa the unopposed candidate. His
nomination therefore was a forcgi ne
conclusion, and he was named by ac
clamation. It also was decided, with
out a dissenting voice, to re-enact th"
rules laid down bv former Speaker
Heed.
The' Officers of the last House, except
Colonel Russell. the Sergeant-at-Arms.
were renominated without opposition,
as follows: <'lerk, Alexander McDow
ell of Pennsylvania; Doorkeeper. W. ,1.
Glenn of New York: Postmaster. .1. C.
Mcßlroy of Ohio, and Chaplain, the
1 lev Henry Cnnden of Michigan.
Democrats Select Richardson.
Washington. Dec. j.—The Democrats
of the House of Representative- at
their caucus, held in the hall of Repre
sentatives, selected Representative J.
D. Richardson of Tennessee as their
candidate for Speaker after a spirited
contest which lasted through six bal
lots. This carries with it tie* Demo
cratic leadership on the floor. Mr.
Richardson has served fourteen years
in the House, and is tin- oldest Demo
cratic member in point of service ix-
Cept .Mr. Mcllae of AI A.WISUS.
The candidates against Mr. Richard
son were Representative lie Arniond of
Missouri, Rankhst.d of Alabama anJ
Sulzer of New York.
To Rush Molineux Trial.
New York, Dec I U is reasonably
certain that the trial of Roland li.
Molineux, which has now commenced
in earnest before Recorder Goff, will
not drag along as other celebrated
cases have, but will be pushed to as
Roland B. Molineuv
speedy an ending .'is is compatible with
the preservation of the 1 • u > 1 rights of
the defendant and of tlie people. Re
corder Goff indicated dining th • lat
ter days of the selection of the jury
that he would not tolerate delay, \>here
delay was attempte I v. iiliout proper
and legitimate purpose in view. The
same rule will apply in the trial.
Mutiny on an Ocean Liner.
St John, N. It.. Dec. 4. The Donald
son line steamer Amarynthia arrived
here from Glasgow with a mutiny on
board. As soon as the vessel dropped
anchor in the harbor Capt. Taylor sent
for the police to take oft' thirteen cat
tlemen who were attempting to take
possession of the ship. Chi !' Clark and
a squad boarded tii steamer and after
a tight, during which knives were
drawn, the cattlemen were overpower
ed and placed in irons, Tlie cattlemen

WOMEN LOSING HEART.
Each Day Brings Fresh Mourning In
to British Homes—Effects of the
Transvaal War Being Felt Seriously
By the Poor—Last Battle Not so Fa
tal as First Reported.
London, Dec. 5. —The j»revailing scnil
ment daily growing stronger here is
that we are paying very dearly for the
war.
A letter written by a member of the
royal family to a lady whose son is
in the Coldstreams with the Orange
River column, and is thus in the thick
of the tight, has just lieen made public.
hi it His Highness says: "All these
victories sound very grand as heoric
encounters and proofs of British pluck,
but they are small from the practical
military point of view. No victories
are great where guns have not be -it
captured. We have taken no cannon
from the enemy."
More guard": have started, which will
further empty London of desirable men
in the society point of view.
Ladies are beginning to lose heart as
they see each .lay bringing fresh
mourning into new families. Hunt balls
and country house parties are being:
put. off in numbers, which points to the
coming winter as one of unrecorded
dulness. The hunting fields are shorn oi
their most brilliant riders. lit these
and a thousand other ways the pinch
of war has been IVIt more keenly each
day.
So much for the rich. The poor als..
feel the war very rcriously, for it is al
most impossible this winter to get or
dinary subscriptions to the usual relict
funds. People just say, "We can't give
this year, for we have to subscribe all
we can afford to the war funds." This
can easily be imagined by looking ;it
the enormous sums raised throughout
the country.
List of British Losses.
London, Dec. s.—The War Office lias
given out the official list of the 1 Srit i-!t
killed and wounded at the battle of
Modeler River, the total being 4 :v
This comparatively small numln r
created wide astonishment There v\ te
at least 8,000 English engage.l At tie
battle of CJleneoe, where only 4.000 Kni:
lish were engaged, the loss was ,'t!9
killed and wounded and 2t»X missing, ot
477. At Elandslaagie tight about
English were eng&ged. and the losses
were 2<> 1 killed ah<*t wounded. At Lady
smith on Oct. 2S, 301 were Killed and
wounded and 48,"> raotured. Thus tli-
British loss at Medder lli.er is about
5 per cent. Some i.iil'.'.ary men are in
clined to think tnat the Boer losses
must have been \fi - y heavy, to account
for Lord Methuen'.* despatch saying it
was"the bloodiest fight of the cen
tury."
Long Wa*ts Warsnips.
Washington, Die. 4.—The annual re
port of the Secretary of the Navy !s ,t
document of unusual interest, dealing
not only with tlv work of the navy
during the past year and important
recommendations for the future, but
also discussing ;he more important
questions relating' to the navy, includ
