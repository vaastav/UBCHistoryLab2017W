The President’s '
Message ,
.
The following extracts from
the President’* message to the ,
Sixth-sixth Congress, which con
vened on Monday, Dec. 1, de
scribe the principal recommends- <
tions made:
FOR A BUDGET SYSTEM.
I hope that Congress will bring
to & conclusion at this session
legislation looking to the estab
lishment of a budget system.
That be one single
authority responsible for the
making of all appropriations and
that appropriations should be
made not independent of each
other, but with reference to one
single comprehensive plan of ex
penditure properly related to the
nation’s income, there can be no
doubt. I believe the burden of
preparing the budget must, in
the nature of the case, if the
work is to be properly done and
responsibility concentrated in
stead of divided, rest upon the
executive. The budget so pre
pared should be submitted to and
approved or amended by a single
committee of each Honse of Con
gress and no single appropriation
should be made by the Congress,
except such as may have been in
cluded in the budget prepared by
the executive or added by the
particular committee of Congress
chart d with the budget legisla
tion.
CORPORATION LICENSES TO LOWER
COST OF LIVING.
We should formulate a law re
quiring a Federal license of all
corporations engaged in inter
state commerce and embodying in
the license, or in the conditions
under which it is to be issued,
specific regulations designed to
secure competitive selling and
prevent unconscionable profits in
the method of marketing. Such a
law would afford a welcome op
portunity to effect other much
needed reforms in the business of
interstate shipment and in the
methods of corporations which
are engaged in it; but for the mo
ment I confine my recommenda
tions object immediately
is to lower the
ARBITRATION FOR LABOR
DISPUTES.
Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, out capital should
receive a reasonable return upon
its investment and is entitled to
protection at the hands of the
Bjvemment in every emergency,
o government worthy of the
name can “play” these elements
against each other, for there is a
mutuality of interest between
them which the government must
seek to express and to safeguard
at all cost.
The right of individnals to
strike is inviolate and ought not
to be interferred with by any
process of government, but there
is a predominant right, and that
is the right of a government to
protect all of its people and to
assert its power and majesty
against the challenge of any
class.
The government, when it as
serts that right, seeks not to an
tagonize a class, but simply to de
fend the right of the whole peo
ple as against the irreparable
harm and injury that might be
done by the attempt by any class
to usurp a power that 'only gov
ernment itself has a right to ex
ercise as a protection to ail.
In the matter of international
disputes which have led to war,
statesmen have sought to set up
as a remedy arbitration for war.
Does this not point the way for
the settlement of industrial dis
putes, by the establishment of a
tribunal, fair land just alike to
all, which will settle industrial
disputes which in the past have
led to war and disaster? Ameri
ca, witnessing the evil conse
quences which have followed out
of such disputes between these
contending forces, must not ad
mit itself impotent to deal with
these matters by means of peace
ful processes.
IN MEMORIAM
Id loving remembrance of MARIE
JARBOE, aged 32, who died Novem
ber 16, 1919, after a long and suffering
illness. Tho’ confined to her bed for
several months, she was ever patient
- and cheerful.
Marie, you hare left us,
Left this lovely land of ours—
Left the beautiful trees.
Bees and birds, In vine; bowers.
Flowers that to thy room brought
God’s own sunshine from without;
Plants and vines that graced thy
Windows, tho’ storms be without.
The running brook and river
That sang to thee in childhood days,
That enlivened thee when sad
As it went rippling on its way.
Left those who loved thee,
Who are waiting for the day
When we will meet to part no more.
But together stay.
Left a place that can’t be filled;
No longer do we see or hear,
But our hearts will always be
Pull of love for thee.
All this hare you left,
But your loss was not In vain;
• You’re far richer now-
W-e Iftst. train.

For the smile from flowers,
Now an angel’s smile is given
The songs and poetry of the brook, ,
Ones so'dear to thee. ,
Is now forgotten and surpassed
By an angel’s choir so sweet and low. ]
Tho’ yours Is a happy fate,
Dear Maria, no envy do we feel,
But are waiting for the day
Whan at God’s Throne we shall kneel |
’Tls bard to be consoled,
But our trust to Him Is given;
God has only taken you
To your rightful home in heaven.

BUILDING
BENEFITS OF COUNTRY ROADS
Among Other Thlnge They Cheapen
Coat of Transportation ef Farm
Products to Market
Good roads promote self-respect In
a community. They make posslbU
social Intercourse. They bring the
benefits of churches snd schools with
in the roach of all. They help to keep
the hoys on the ft fin. They cheapen
the cost of transportation of farm
products to the markets and thus add
to the form profile. They add to the
value of farm lamia much more than
they cost. They mark the degree of
civilization of the rural community.
Tills, In short. Is the value of good
roods as seen by the eitenslon service
of the University of Missouri College
of Agriculture.
The building of good roads Is of the
greatest Importance to a community.
What kind of a road should be builtT
Of whnt should It he constructed!
.. '' ■” '* v f •
’ ‘ if?
w-vJ' Roads Like Th ■■ sir ,r w Farmer
Nearer to City Markets.
Whnt are the things to he considered
In locating the road! What ‘grade’’
should he maintained! How should
the road be drained! What are the
1 laws governing highway construction!
1 There are a few questions answered
In rvlenslofi circular (18 dealing with
i country roads.
Mullers of prime consideration In
locating a road are; Easy grades,
food drainage, exposure to sunshine,
elimination of culverts sod bridges by
avoiding unnecessary creek crossings,
directness and the number of farms to
be served for a given length of rood.
Whenever possible to avoid It. a good
location should not he rejected merely
because a certain roadway has been Id
use for some time. If the location of
h used road Is had It should he
i changed If possible. In relocating roads
avoid railroad crossings at grades.
The grade of the road la Important
for on this depends the weight of the
load which can be hauled economically
By grade Is meant the rise or fail in
feet far each 100 feet In horizontal
length ot road, usually expressed In
percentage. A 5 per cent grade means
that the road rlsee or falls 0 feet each
100 feet along Its center line. It has
been calculated that on a smooth coun
try road the load that one horse could
pull on a level would require two on a
6 per cent grade, three on a 10 per cent
grade and four on a 15 per cent grade
Engineers usually figure a 0 per cent
grade as a maximum.
Hoad work In Mtsaonii has not been
as well managed as other public work
Projects have been too narrowly lim
ited to localities, resulting In frag
mentary effort. Skilled locating snd
supervision ot construction hove been
generally lacking. The remedies are:
First, s wider cooperation and th*
adopt lon of broad schsraea of Improve
ment, preferably with units no smaller
than counties. Second, the absolute
elimination of political considerations
In the spending of money. Third, *
curing good engineering advice in the
preparation of plans and requiring
careful engineering supervision of con
struction.
ENGLAND SPENDS 60 MILLION
Orsnta to That Amount Will Be Ola
trlbutod for Reconst ruction of
Roads and Bridges.
Grants amounting to 150,000,000 will
be distributed by the British road
hoard for the reconstruction ot roads
and bridges In England In 1010. De
mobilized army units will be used to
<io the labor. Local highway authori
ties will be required to match this
appropriation by at least as large a
program of road work as they carried
out In the year before the war. Area
taken Into consideration, England’s
program is thus far In excess of that
of the United StaWs, Including both
federal aid and State funds.
