The North End father who sought
to freeze out his daughter's sweet
heart by letting the furnace run
down was defeated by the young
lady who bought a bag of v
Brown's Charcoal
and a bag of Otto Coke. She revived
the Are, causing , a beautiful easy
Warmth and made the old gentleman
nearly explode with suppressed rage
as he heard her "stiddy" sing ''Love
Finds a Way."

The Sugar trust has just been fined
$18,000 for accepting $28,000 worth of
rebates.,: If the trust does not. look
out the courts will catch up with it.
Xews has been received at the war
department of the . recent fight ; iu
Leyte, in the Philippines, in which the
American troops were badly cut up
by an outfit of Bolo men. ; This is one
of the lirliest fights that the war de
partment has bad to record in. the
past two years. , The insurgents were
not really insurrectors at all, but rath
er a stronger band than usual of the
Ladrones who infest many of the isl
ands., Some of them were armed with
guns, but all bad the deadly bolos, in
the use of which the nstlves are, very
expert. They fired a volley at the
troops and then rushed them with the
sword, filling five before they were
finally dispersed. Several of the sol
diers who escaped death were badly
Injured, but " the encounter is one
which is not likely to be repeated
again very soon. The Puljanes, the
robber organisation which infested
the island of Samar, has been effect
ually broken up, and all the Informa
tion that now conies to the war de
partment Indicates that the Philip
pines have entered an era of com
parative peace combined with a fair
amount of prosperity.
The curious are looking forward to
the annual auction of articles accum
ulated iu the dead letter division of
the postofflce department, which will
begin on the 17th of this month, thus
giving a bidder the chance of secur
ing Christmas presents for friends at
a price somewhat lower than that for
which the same articles could be pur
chased at a store. Last year the pro
ceeds of the sale amounted to $7,
054.03, while the money taken out of
letters amounted to $17,020. These
two amounts were covered lutp the
treasury. About live years ago some
of the clerks, whose duties consisted
of sorting and cataloging the articles
to be sold, conceived a plan to buy
valuable articles at ridiculously low
prices. A package containing some
cheap articles and perhaps a valuable
watch or ring was prepared and cata- ,
logued as ."two neckties, a damaged !
shirt eto." The clerk would then
make a note of the number of the
package snd when that package came
up for sale, the clerk or one of his
friends would bid it In for little or
nothing compared with the value. In
spectors made 'an investigation and
severs! clerks'lost their positions. An
order was then issued that "etc"
should not be used In the future and
that the contents of each package
should be accurately described. This
year 0,531 packages of miscellaneous
articles 1,289 of books and 439 of
jewerly are to bo sold, which com
prise almost everything from a baby
rattle to a diamond ring.
Many bills are being Introduced In
congress every day, but there are only
a few of them of real nitlontl Inter
est One of the most important, and
which stards a possibility of passing
at tne present session, is thst by rep
resentative Perkins of New York,
embodying the Ideas of the president
on the Inheritance tax. This bill Is
not very drastic but is drawn with
aa idea of withstanding the scrutiny
of the supreme court. It provides
for tax on an legacies of f23,inO
or over. The amount assented varies
with the cloeeneea of kin between the
testator and legatee. In ease of a
direct descendant, a brother, sister,
husband or father, the tax will be
only 73 rents in every $100 on the
minimum' smout named, this tax In
creases as the consanguinity diminish
es, and in the case of a Ifsoy to
strangers it s mounts to $5.00 In every
$100. On the other kind there la a
sliding scale, which Increases the tax
atloa as the legacy Increases, so that
In the rase of legacies of I30.non.uw)
or over the tax would amount to one
qnarter of tne bequest Itself. Pro
vision for the coUectloa ef the (ax Is
made through the bores a of Internal
revenue. Ia the case of estates over
$tOOO,000 la value, the execators are
given three years, if desired, ia which
to nettle the taxes. The deferred taxes
win draw interest at the rata of
per rent but the object of the delay
Is to prevent sacrificing real estate or
aecvrttlea by throwing a large s mount
ImnedUtriy on the market The
o.atioa of aa Urease tax has not yet
been broached, bat It Is aaderstood
that a bill to rale end will be Intro-
dared a lit tie later la the session.

closely on Bryan lines that the '"Bryan-Roosevelt
merger" quite capti

Those who do their holiday buying

.'"' By the English corrupt practices act
the amount that any candidate may
spend for his election to office is lim
ited. A similar amendment to the act
of the late general assembly is wprthy
of consideration. With the general
working of that act during the recent
election George L. Fox is satisfied. It
was, he says closely observed, with
but few exceptions, throughout the
state, and that In all probability there
was no other state in the union which
had a cleaner election record.

"Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of

Young Men Coma Off Second Best In
- Encounter With Porcupine.
Literally living pin-cushions and
tilled with porcupine quills from their
ankles to their thighs, Burt Sea vey
and Cullen Jordan, of Scarboro, were
taken to a Portland physician for
treatment after a battle with two
giant "Maine hedgehogs," which they
had encountered in a wood road while
returning from -work. . The physician
plucked more than SS quills from the
legs of each man, but no serious re
sults are expected, unless blood pois
oning seta In.
; As soon aa the two young farmers
eame upon the porcupines, Just be
fore dusk, they picked up clubs and
started for the animals. The hedge
hogs, as they are called hereabouts,
Jabbed their needle-pointed qullbiinto
the farmer's legs. The young men
responded with a short, but sharp
attack with' their clubs, but the hedge
hogs proved to have the better weapon
and carried the day. Although one
of them was left stretched out on the
ground, , the other retreated trium
phantly and In good order, master of
the situation, while the two agricul
turists limped home and out of barm's
way as oneedlly as possible. N. . Y.

Evergreens Need Protection.
All evergreens suffer in winter from
warm weather and drying winds,'
which cause their leaves to evaporate
moisture faster than It can be supplied
by the roots, which may be In frosen
grAund. The yellow color of ever
greens in winter is usually a sign of
distress, and bronzing Is a sign of im
perfect hardness or of willingness to
drop the leaves for a while in order
to withstand the winter. The best
way to protect rare and costly ever
greens Is to plant them behind a
windbreak or amid a group of other
trees. The prevailing winter wind Is
usually from the northwest. All coni
fers, whether hardy or not are glad
to be mulcted with eight or ten inches
of leaves or coarse manure. Garden
