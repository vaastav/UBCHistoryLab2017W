Thursday, - - - December 16, 1909.
MUCH has been said of President Taft's
judicial mind. He is so judicious that he
invariably picks out a corporation judiciary.
NOW that the people have had ample
time to digest President Taft's message
to Congress?well, there was nothing to
digest, after all.
AN effort is being made in Washington
to have the date of inauguration day
changed from March to the latter part c f
April. We heartily approve of this, and
we should also like to see a change in the
politics of the next President to be inaugurated.
IT is no wonder that there is so much
growling among the faithful in West Virginia
on account of few changes being
made among federal appointees. Several
of the most important places are filled by
men who should never have been appointed
in the first place. It is adding
insult to injury to give them another term.
WHEN President Taft tried to force
the Aldrich tariff bill down the throats of
the people of the West as a sweet morsel
they had their doubts of him, knowing
this outrageous measure to be a bitter pill.
Now that he has commenced to pack the
United States Supreme Court with railroad
lawyers, they will know for a ccr
tainty how absolutely he is dominated by
the corporations.
?
NEWS comes from Washington that
Senators Elkins and Scott have agreed on
the appointment of Roy Waugh.of Buckhannon,
to succeed Reese Blizzard as U.
S. District Attorney for West Virginia.
They will also dump overboard Charles
D. Elliott, who has held office ever since
the Republicans have been in power in
West Virginia, and James Doyle, of McMechen,
will succeed him as marshal of
the northern district. Frank Tyree is to be
reappointed marshal for the southern
district.
THE important labor leaders of the
country are going into a fight against the
Steel Trust. The trust is gradually getting
rid of the labor unions in its mills and
factories, and the union men have awakened
to the realization that while the fight
against them is quiet and unostentatious,
it is nevertheless effective, and they are
steadily losing ground. At a conference
of union leaders on Tuesday it was agreed
to seek the aid of President Taft before
bringing about a great strike, but in our
opinion this is a forlorn hope. The President
will not take one side unless he can
take the other also.
?
LAST week was a busy one for Senators
Elkins and Scott, w ho were besieged
by scores of West Virginia politicians and
n(l;/>a^ea<ikarc ii'lin hart iniirnpvpd to
Washington in the hope that luck might
come to them in the way of federal appointment.
Those who have been enjoying
nice places for the past eight years
in West Virginia are doing their best to
hold on, while the hungry ones who believe
that a change is good were equally
persistent. It is said that the Senators are
averse to making many decided changes
among the office-holders. It would create
a bad precedent.
+
THE best oil well ever drilled in West
Virginia came in last week at Shinnston,
near Grafton. An enormous body of oil
was struck by the Philadelphia Company,
and the fluid has been gushing out at the
rate of over 6,000 barrels a day.
Just think! $8,000 worth of oil flowing
from the earth every 24 hours?and the
State of West Virginia is being made
poorer instead of richer by it, for there
is practically no revenue at all coming to
the State from its vast output of oil and
gas.
If argument were needed to show the
fairness of a tax on the output of the oil
and gas wells and the coal mines of West
Virginia hpre it is. unanswerable. But.
unfortunately, argument has little weight
with a venal legislature.
LAST Monday President Taft appointed
Judge Horace H. Lurton, of Nashville,
Tenn., to be an Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court. Judge
Lurton is a Democrat, but he is plainly
appointed at the instance of the railroads
and other corporations. He is the man
who was openly charged in the United
States Senate by Senator Tillman with
being "a railroad judge,"and he has been
spoken of in his own circuit as "Private
Car" Lurton, because of the practice of
traveling in private cars furnished him by
the railroads whose cases were pending
before him. The President was informed
as to the charges against and objections
to Lurton and was urged not to appoint
him, but he persisted in giving him the
place.
No other act of President Taft shows
so conclusively his subserviency to the
corporations. The plain people can no
longer claim any sympathy from him.
Scott's Emulsion
is the original?has been
the standard for thirty-five
years.
There are thousands of
so-called "just as good
Emulsions, but they are
not?they are simply imitations
which are never
as good as the original.
They are like thin milk?
SCOTT'S is thick like a
heavy cream.
If you want it thin, do
it yourself?with water?
but dont buy it thin.

NOTES FROM NEARBY.
Dr. E. M. Garrott, of Sharpsburg,
butchered three hogs this week that
weighed over 1,500 pounds.
S. P. Stickle and son have bought from
the Alexander heirs a farm of 160 acres
located four miles west of Charles Town.
The farm of the late E. A. Colston, near
Summit Point, containing 199 acres, was
sold at public sale for $65 an acre. George
T. Shirley bought it.
It is said that the B. <& O. road will put
a gasoline engine on the Berkeley Springs
branch to carry the passenger traffic between
Berkeley and Hancock.
In a special election at Martinsburg on
Tuesday a proposition to issue $40,000 of
bonds to improve the water system was
carried by a three-fourths majority.
Martha Middleton, a twelve-year-old
colored girl of Nipetown, Berkeley county,was
burned to death last Saturday. Her
clothes caught fire while she was playing
with matches.
J. Frank S. Beck, for 25 years organist
of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church,
of Hagerstown has resigned. He wishes
to take a rest. During his long term of
service he missed only five church services.
A. J. Michael has sued Jailor N. H.
Hobday at Berkeley Springs for $5,000
damages for applying to him the water
cure. Last July Michael got drunk and
was put in jail. Becoming offensive, the
jailor turned the hose on him and gave
him a thorough drenching. Michaej
claims that the washing gave him a cold
and the rheumatism.
W. C. Locke has sold his land near
Shepherdstown to J. L. Cadell, of Vancouver.
British Columbia, who purchased
the tract of 45 acres lying in Jefferson
county for $2,900. C. C. Lemen bought
the parcel adjoining his place for $175
and paid $175 for the timber, and Dwight
McQuilkin bought the lot lying in Berkeley
county for $160. Mr. Locke came
here from the neighborhood of Stephens
City, Va.?Martinsburg World.
The people of the Kearneysville neighborhood
were interested last week in a
strange aerial visitor that made its appearance
Tuesday afternoon. It seemed
to be a couple of thousand feet in the air,
and some folks took it to be a flying machine.
It came trom the south, and when
it got to a point near the village it stopped,
remaining at an altitude of about 1,000 feet.
It turned out to be a kite from the United
States observatory at Mount Weather, in
the Blue Ridge mountains, which had
broken from Jts moorings and sailed
away. Several thousand feet of wire trailed
from the kite, and when this caught in a
tree it stopped. Later the kite fell to the
earth, damaging some of the delicate instalments
attached to it, and was taken
charge of by George VanMetre, government
weather observer at Martinsburg.
The kite was a very large one, being in
three sections, eacb about eight feet long
by five feet high.

Catarrh Cannot Be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease. Catarrh
is a blood or constitutional disease,
and in order to cure it you must take internal
remedies. Hall's Catarrh Cure is
taken internally, and acts directly on the
blood and mucous surfaces. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is not a quack medicine. It
was prescribed by one of the best physi
cians in this country for years and is a
regular prescription. It is composed of
the best tonics known, combined with
the best blood purifiers, acting directly on
the mucous surfaces. The perfect combination
of the two ingredients is what
produces such wonderful results in curing
Catarrh. Send for testimonials free.

Take Hall's Family Pills for constipation.
"When the docket was read Monday
morning at Winchester in the circuit
court of Frederick county, the fact was
revealed that for the first time in many
years there is not a single criminal case
pending. It was also said their are no
county prisoners in the county jail."
This speaks volumes for the order and
peace and general good conduct of a town
and county under local-option conditions.
Most well-disposed persons will rejoice
at such a state of affairs, though it will
sadden the Dicky-bird of Hagerstowu.
The "drys"won out in Barbour county,
W. Va., last week, and all applications
for liquor license were turned down by
the county court.
The Secret Out.
"What made my lovely complexion ?
1 do not like to tell, for it was a medicine,
but the nicest a woman ever took. It
was Lane's Family Medicine that did it."
This is a pleasant herb tea which acts favorably
on the stomach and bowels, purifying
and cleansing the skin like magic.
It cures headache and backache. Druggists
and dealers sell it, 25c.
Wheeling had a big fire last Friday
night. The Court theatre and office
building, a splendid structure, was practically
destroyed, causing a loss of $200,000.
More Danville Proof.
Jacob Schrail, 432 South St., Danville
III., writes: For over eighteen months I
was a sufferer from kidney and bladder
trouble. During the whole time was
treated by several doctors and tried several
different kidney pills. Seven weeks
ago I commenced taking Foley's Kidney
Pills, and am feeling better every day and
will be glad to tell anyone interested just
what Foley's Kidney Pills did for me."

Do the right thing if you have Nasal
Catarrh. Get Ely's Cream Balm at once.
Don't touch the catarrh powders and
snuffs, for they contain cocaine. Ely's
Cream Balm releases the secretions that
inflame the nasal passages and the throat,
whereas medicines made with mercury
merely dry up the secretions and leave
you no better than you were. In a word,
Ely's Cream Balm is a real remedy, not 2
delusion. All druggists, 50 cents, or

THEY INJURE CHILDREN.
Ordinary Cathartics and Pills and
Harsh Physic Cause Distressing
Complaint.
You cannot be over-careful in the selection
of medicine for children. Only
the very gentlest bowel medicine should
be given, except in emergency cases.
Ordinary pills, cathartics and purgatives
are apt to do more harm than good. They
cause griping, nausea and other distressing
after-effects that are frequently healthdestroying
and a life-lasting annoyance.
We personally recommend and guarantee
Rexall Orderlies as the safest and
most dependable remedy for constipation
and associate bowel disorders. We have
such absolute faith in the virtues of this
remedy that we sell it on our guarantee of
money back in every instance where it
fails to give entire satisfaction, and we
urge all in need of such medicine to try it
at our risk.
Rexall Orderlies contain an entirely new
ingredient which is odorless, tasteless,
and colorless. As an active agent, it embraces
the valuable qualities ot the best
known intestinal regulator tonics.
Rexall Orderlies arc eaten like candy.
They are particularly prompt and agreeable
in action, may be taken at any time,
day or night; do not cause diarrhoea, nausea,
griping, excessive looseness or other
undesirable effects. They have a very
natural action upon the glands and organs
with which they come in contact, act as a
positive and regulative tonic upon the relaxed
muscular coat of the bowel and its
dry mucous lining; remove irritation,overcome
weakness, tone and strengthen
the nerves and muscles, and restore the
bowels and associate organs to more vigorous
and healthy activity.
Rexall Orderlies completely relieve
constipation, except when of a surgical
character. They also tend to overcome
the necessity of constantly taking laxatives
to keep the bowels in normal condition.
There is really no medicine for this purpose
so good as Rexall Orderlies, especially
for children, aged and delicate persons.
They are prepared in tablet form,
in two sizes of packages; 12tablets 10
cents, and 36 tablets 25 cents. Remember
you can obtain Rexall Remedies in
Shepherdstown only at our store,?The
Rexall Store. Reinhart's Pharmacy.
Don't Cough But Live Long.

If any medicine will cure a cough,Kemp's
Rnlcam will do it. At druncist's and
