A SEND-OFF FOR DIXON.
The junior senator from Montana
is given a neat send-off in an article
contributed to the Pacific Monthly by
Ira E. Bennett, who discusses western
affairs at Washington. That portion
of the article which refers to Mr. Dixon
says:
Joseph M. Dixon, of Missoula, who
succeeds "the richest man in the
world" as senator from Montana,
represents the new era in that state.
It is the era of agriculture, as dis
tinguished from the old mining age.
The agricultural population of Mon
tana now exceeds the mining popula
tion and is rapidly drawing ahead.
Mr. Dixon, whether designedly or not,
became the spokesman of the irriga
tion and agricultural interests long
ago. He is well known in Washing
ton, of course, where he has served in
several sessions of congress as repre
sentative at large. His assiduity in
studying irrigation and land ques
tions made him valuable to the lead
ers of congress and the president. He
was never mixed in any deals. He
made a great impression on President
Roosevelt in the fight for the preser
vation of the rights of the Indians.
"Joe," said Mr. lioosevelt, "I want
to constitute you my conscience in all
northwestern Indian affairs. See that
the rights of the Indians are protect
ed."
Credit is given to Mr. Dixon, more
than to any other tnan, for the two
reclamation projects that are to work
such benefits to Montana—the Huntley
and Sun river projects. Dixon was
indefatigable in pursuing the executive
officials until he had obtained the as
surance that these projects would be
taken up and completed.
This new senator is forty years of
age. He was born in North Carolina
of Quaker stock—the lineage and
birthplace of Speaker Cannon. The
speaker has kept a fatherly eye on his
young friend from Moulana, greatly
to the young statesman's advantage.
The prospect before Senator Dixon is
singularly bright, and he will go con
trary to a life of honest and success
ful endeavor if he does not make a
useful senator.
IMPORTANCE OF IRRIGATION.
of

The benefits that will result fron
government irrigation projects are the
subject of comment in the president's
message, aud congress is advised that
expenditures of government funds in
reclamation work are a good invest
ment. The president's views upon this
matter are given in part as follows:
irrigation should be far more ex
tensively developed than at present,
not oui y in the states of the great
plains aud the llocky mountains, but
in many others, as, for instance, in
large portions of the South Atlantic
and gulf ptates, where it should go
hand in haud, with the reclamation of
swamp laud. The federal government
should seriously devote itself to this
task, reali/.ing that utilization of
waterways and water power, forestry,
irrigation, and the reclamation of
lands threatened with overflow, are
all interdependent parts of the same
problem.
The work of the reclamation service
in developing the larger opportunities
of the western half of our country for
irrigation is more important than al
'most any other movement. The con
stant purpose of the government in
connection with the reclamation ser
vice has been to use the water re
sources of the public lands for the
ultimate greatest trood of the greatest
number: in other words, to put upon
the land permanent home makers, to
use aud develop it for themselves and
for their children and children's child
ren.
There has been, of course, opposi
tion to this work: opposition from
some interested tuen who desire to ex
haust the laud for their own immed
iate profit without regard to the wel
fare of the uext generation, aud op
position from honest and well-meaning
men who did not fully understand the
subject or who did not look far
enough ahead. This opposition is, I
think, dying away, and our people
are understanding that it would be
utterly wrong to allow a few individ
uals to exhaust for their own tempor
ary personal profit the resources
which ought to be developed through
use so as to be conserved for the per
manent common advantage of the peo
ple as a whole.
DON'T TALK HARD TIMES.
In discussing the cause of the recent
financial flurry, a writer iu Success
Magazine says good business condi
tions depend not only upon the great
laws of supply and demand, but upon
the maintenance of public confidence.
Fear aud distrust are fatal enemies of
confidence. The moment business men
get scared and people begin to talk
hard times, distrust spreads like wild
fire. Level-headed men say they see
no real cause for alarm, but at the
same time the perpetual suggestion
which is being passed along influences
them and they grow more cautious.
Bankers see no breakers ahead, yet
they think that they should be con
servative, and they begin to call in
their loans which are not quite so
gilt-edered as before. They are also
more careful about accommodating
their borrowing customers, so that
they may be a little better prepared in
case anything adverse should happen.
These precautions spread. Distrust,
fear, anxiety, a feeling of uncertainty,
like the rising tide of gossip, sweep
like wildfire all over the country.
Soon everybody is talkiug hard times:
all are influenced by the contagion
of the perpetual fear of suggestion.
Cautious men think perhaps they have
been spreading out a little too much,
and they begin to retrench, discharge
help and cut down salaries and ex
penses generally. Mercantile houses,
manufactories, railroads and other
concerns stop extensions and im
provements and take in sail until all
danger is passed.
As a consequence public confidence
is shaken and there is a general
strangulation of business all over the
country. Important contracts, the
erection of large buildings and ex
tension negotiations are called off.
There is a marked decline in business
transactions of all kinds. Nobody
has confidence to branch out: every
body is hedging.
Such a conditions of things began
with the recent investigation and pro
secution of certain great combinations
of capital. After the investigation
these great concerns began to retrench,
and when the whole country caught
thu spirit of caution stocks began to
drop, business houses began to fail,
and the first we knew there was a sort
of mental business panic, a condition
wholly uncalled for, unwarranted.
Crop prospects were most promising
and the country at large was in su
perb condition. The panic was main
ly mental, caused by fear and anxiety
resulting from lack of confidence, gen
eral distrust of the future.

For William Jennings Bryan lias
partajceu of a three-dollar dinner.
William used to find a dollar dinner
all right aud he used to advertise the
fact that a banquet of the faithful and
unterrified should cost no more than
that modest sum. But yesterday
morning the press dispatches heralded
to all ends of this great and glorious
nation the fact that William had been
the guest of honor at a three-dollar
dinner.
How now, William'.-' It was bad
enough when you went to the White
house aud talked things over with the
president: it was bad enough when
you advocated a centralization of
bank control; it was bail enough when
you went so far as to endorse the acts
of Theodore Hoosevelt—but we could
forgive all these thiugs had you only
stuck to the dollar dinner-bill.
But now that you have ceased to
be a dollar-dinuer Bill, and have be
come a three-dollar-dinner Bill, aud
what have you to say, Bill? Where
are the vaunted principles of denioc
racy? Where is our boasted simplic
ity? Where are the traditions of Jef
fersonV Where are the precedents of
Jackson? O, William, how could you
do it?
Better, far better, would it have
been had you gone to a free lunch
counter: better had you filled up on
pretzels aud cheese. Your word
sound like hollow brass aud your
utterances are a mockery.

New York , Dee. 4.—From every
quarter of the country today come re
ports which show beyond a doubt that
the temporary check to industrial
prosperity felt as a result of the finan*
clal panic is at an end, that there is a
re-awakening everywhere, with the re
opening of mills and factories, the
putting of employes back to work,
and the renewal of orders by whole
sale and retail business houses.
In New Enirland, and especially in
Massachusetts, the wool market has
taken a fresh start. In Pennsylvania
the steel aud iron industry is resuuv

the State Knit Goods Manufacturers'
association, numbering *>t> large con
cerns, agreed to cancel no more or
ders to the factories.
Bl 'ttk, Dec. 4. The hard time
are attested by the fact that more
money was paid out this year to save
the property of poor people who were
unable to pay their taxes than for
several years past. It was stated at
the otUee of the county commissioners
today that $721 had been paid out to
help the poor.

Bot at that time by statecraft welded
the Italian states. Garibaldi had not
risen like a roeket with his military
achievements. The government of Na
ples was especially despicable. The
Englishman, being too warm, took off
his coat, laying it on a seat. When
be had gone as far as lie wished he
directed the boatman to turn about
and pull back. Then, when the shore
was reached, he took up his coat and
went his way.
Au bour later he missed his purse.
Certain that it had dropped from his
coat pocket when he had laid It on
the seat, he went to the shore. The
boatman had just come iu from an
Other trip on the bay. He looked very
much hurt out of his soft eyes when
the Englishman told him that he had
dropped his purse In the boat, saying
that he had found no purse.
The Englishman did not doubt that
the boatman had appropriated his
purse and its contents, but had no proof
of the theft aud would not have pm
ceeded against him in any event. What
could be expected of a people living
under such a government? Ile went tu
his hotel angry with himself at his
carelessness and angry with the des
potic sway that prevented the Neapoli
tans from getting an honest living.
Meeting some countrymen of his own
In the cafe where he dined, he told
them of the circumstance of the loss
of his purse, inveighing bitterly against
the government.
In a land oppressed by tyranny," he
said, "It is impossible to have a pros
perous people. A people who are not
permitted to keep what they earn must
steal. Here all they earn must go t<>
the government. In our country our
workinguien are lightly taxed, anil
when crime Is committed there is a
police force to ferret out the criminal

He spoke in English, not supposing
that he was understood at any one of
the neighboring tables even if over
heard.
"Softly," interrupted one of his com
panions iu an undertone. "That well
dressed, gentlemanly Italian over there
is listening, I'm sure."
"What makes you think so?"
"1 have seen the color rise to his
cheeks and his nostrils dilate. Ile is
suppressing wrath. Look out for your
self during the rest of your stay here.
Don't go through the narrow streets
lest you get a stiletto In your back.'
They dare not murder an English
man. At this time they don't wish to
make an enemy of a powerful nation."
•Not openly. You will be missing
That is all."
The Englishman visited the buried
cities near Naples and the volcano that
buried them; then, the evening before
his departure being fair, he took boat
and visited Capri. When on returning
he stepped ashore lie was accosted by
a gentleman whom lie recognized as
the one who had been suspected of lis
tening to his conversation at dinner a
few evenings before. The man spoke
In English, with an Italian accent.
"You are Lord lt., I believe," said the
Italian.
The Englishman, who was travelin:
Incognito, was surprised. He Inclined
his head in assent.
"And leader of the opposition In the
British house of commons?"
Again the Englishman nodded his
head.
"You lost a sum of money a few
days ago?"
"I did."
"How much?"
"Eighty pounds."
"You are mistaken. There were £S0
and 2 napoleons."
"I believe you are right."
"In what did you keep them?"
"Iu a silk purse."
"Of what color?"
'Different colors."
The tings were"—
'Of gold."
"Where do you think you lost your
purse?"
"in one of these boats while out on
the bay."
Do you suspect any one of taking
it?"
"Possibly the boatman."
"Should you recognize him?"
"Certainly."
"Please step this way."
The Italian led the Englishman
one of the boats that lined the shore
It bore the name of the one In which
he had lost his purse. Something lay
in the bottom. It was covered with
dirty cloak. The Italian lifted the
cloak, and there lay the man who had
rowed Lord B. on the bay, dead
his hand was the purse. The Italian
took it from the cold fingers and hand
ed it to the owner.
"Will you count It?'
"No," said Lord IV, at last rebellious
