FLEXIBLE TARIFF
HARDING'S MESSAGE
and
FORDNEY'S COMMENT
. CONGRESSMAN PORDSET TO
MANUFACTURERS' ASSO.
- i-'Undeir thie .Constitution, Congress
. cannot delegate to any man or set
of t men the right to impose duties
'and fix the amoutn of duty, except
; UDdr certain conditions."
I have talked to the President, not
flinioe wrtein'g this message, but be
fore. I laid a. plan before the Ways
and Means Committee.
I am not
fthe father of the thought. . I thought
It a good one and so does the Presi
dent. That is this. The Congress
can flx a maximum and a minimum
tariff. Make it very low and very
Jhfcg-h and dirept that the executive
"ehall determiine the foreign cost of an
article and the American cost of pro
duction, and apply a duty sufficiently
fliigh to make up the difference no
matter what couAtry the goods come
.from.
-"Such a law has been held to be
(Constitutional by the Supreme Court,
and the 111 nations of the world im
portlnsr tfnto the United States that
ihave dlifEeirent costs of production
'then would pay an amount of duty
'that would land the goods from every
country in the United . States at the
'American price laid down here, so
that no country would have an ad
vantage over the other and none of
ihem over the American manufactur
'er . That is what the President
means. That is the power I want
:or give the President of the United
IGtates. and diireict him to find the
jicoat of production and apply a duty
iBUfflcie.ntly high to bring that cost
Hty our cost of production.

PRESIDENT HARDING'S MESSAGE
ON FLEXIBLE TARIFF.
"I am no, unmindful of constitu
tional difficulties. These can be met
by giving authority to Che Chief Ex
ecutive who could proclafim addi
tional duties to meet conditions which
the Congress may designate.
"At tihis point I must disavow any
desire to enlarge the Executive's pow
ers or add to the responsibilities of
the office. They are already too large.
If there were any other plan I would
prefer it.
"The grant of authority to proclaim
would necessarily brirag the Tariff
Commission into new and enlarged
activities, because mo Executive could
discharge such a duty except upon the
information acquired and recom
mendations made by this commission.
Bue the plan is feasible, and the
proper functioning of the board would
give us a better administration of a
defined policy than ever can be made
possible by tariff duties prescribed
without inflexibility."
Former City Clerk
Has Narrow Escape
While traveling on Norman street
late yesterday afternoon an automo
bile driven by J. Alex Robinson, for
mer city clerk for many years, was
rammed by a truck near the corner
of Laurel avenue. Robinson's father.

Brady and. her two year old son, were
in the Robinson machine, and were
fortunate to escape serious injury.
The truck was owned by Eames &
Meeker, plumbers, ajid was being
driven by John N. MeQuinn, 20. of
191 Rocton avenue. He was arrest
ed for reckless driving and for being
without a license.
Remains of a Sun Temple at Ave
bury. England, are said to be older
.ihan Stonehenge itself.
Each British family, it is estimated,
pays on the average $15 a week in
government taxes.
"Is Man a Miracle or a Mistake?"

given by Dr. Maurice Kordhet, of
Passaic, N. J., .next Wenesay evening,

Girls' Charity
Entertainment

Charities, of which Mrs. DeVer H.

AUTO ACCIDENTS
REDUCED BY ONE
DURING NOVEMBER
Hartford, Dec. 9 The number of
automobile accidents fatal to chil
dren was reduced to one during the
month of November, according to
motor vehicle department figures
made public yesterday. Deaths of
children under 10 years old as a re
sult of automobile accidents have
steadily decreased. it was shown,
since the observance of "Safety
Week," Sept. 19 to 26. The peak of
such fatalities was reached that week
and the subsequent decline was
ascribed today to the fact that par
ents and children, awakened by the
intensive campaign to the growing
menace of traffic carelessness, have
heakened to the educational effort
made by state, municipal and civic
organizations.
