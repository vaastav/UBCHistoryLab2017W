Coeur d'Alene Bants Can't
Cash Warrants.
FAIL TO MARE GOOD
On One of Their County Seat
Campaign Promises.
It was learned here last week that
the banks at Coeur d'Alene are re
fusing to cash county warrants. The
Rathdrum State hank has letters
from its correspondents In Spokane,
relative to the matter and permission
is given for the publication uf one of
them which is as follows:
The Traders National Bank
Spokane, Wash. Dec. 2nd, 1908
Rathdrum State Bank,
Rathdrum, Idaho.
Gentlemen:—We charge your account
$ 8.00 and return herewith warrant
for like amount drawn on the Treas
urer of Kootenai County, Idaho.
This warrant has not yet been called.
We are informed by our corres
pondent at Coeur d'Alene that the
banks up there are not accepting
these warrants. They write that
they believe they will be able to get
some outside parties to take a few of
the warrants, but will not agree to
take any specified amount.
Trusting that you will be able
to dispose of same, we remain,
Yours truly, ,
W. T. Triplett.
Asst. Cashier.
W.T.T.
This refusal or inability of the
oanks of Coeur d'Alene to handle the
county warrants recalls one of the
arguments used by the Coeur d'Alene
boosters In the recent campaign for
the county seat. Their most im
portant literature, gotten out a short
time before election, contained the
following passage:
"Coeur d'Alene has a population of
between seven and eight thousand
It has four large banks,
people,
which have a capitalization of a
quarter of a million dollars, and is
1
therefore the great hanking and com
mercial center for the entire county.
Rathdrum at present refuses to cash
county warrants and other county
paper, while Coeur d'Alene Is now
and always has been ready and will
ing to cash and take care of all of
these obligations. Rathdrum
probably deny this, but let us note a
specific instance where Rathdrum has
refused to cash county warrants and
directed the party to present them at
Coeur d'Alene, which was done, and
the warrants cashed by a Coeur d'
Alene bank without question. We
refer to warrants Nos. 45 to 54 in
clusive for $200 each, drawn on the
general bridge fund for the total sum
of $2000. These warrants were
issued to the Midland Bridge Com
pany and endorsed by A. A. Trocon,
its agent, and delivered to Martin
Gilbertson, subcontractor, who en
dorsed them and received his money
at the Exchange National Bank in
Coeur d'Aleue. Rathdrum has only
bank, which is a state hank,
will
I
one
with a capitalization of only $25,000.
Do you as a voter want to transact
your business in a city where you can
cash your warrants at par, or do you
want to have the county seat reuiai
at Rathdrum where there is only one
bank, and that bank unable to pro
perly handle the negotiable paper
issued by the county, such as bridge
warrant»,

made in that article had no founda
tion in fact and were merely a part

1 light. It was known that with the
' excepl i 0 n of the single instance cited
about the $2000 of bridge warrants,
the Raihdrum Dank had not refus.-d

aild t he refusal in that one instance
was ()ue tl) n, e mistaken action by
the holder before he presented the
warran t s for payment.
warrants, current expense
etc."
Persons who were aware of the facts
Another falsity contained in the
Coeur d'Alene article is that Rath*
drum has but one hank, and the
assurance held out that Coeur d'
Alene was the place for the county
seat because county wariants could
be cashed there is uow known to bave
been misleading.
There is some speculation as tD
whether or not the refusal of the
Coeur d'Alene banks to take county
warrants will have the effect of plat*
Ing warrants at a discount. Their
action in the matter is attributed to
lack of funds due to the panic of a
year ago, since which time Coeur d'
Alene has not recovered her former
prosperity.

POSTAL SAV1NCS BANKS
Features of the Carter Bill in
Congress.
Senator Carter of Montana, who
introduced a bill in the U. S. senate
during the last session, for postal
savings banks, intends to press action
during the present session, according
to a recent dispatch.
"It is thought that the Carter bill,
after being taken up again by the
committee of posloffices and post
roads, will be altered in some respects,
but will lose none of its distinctive
features, which are:
Every postofflee authorized to Issue
money orders is to be compelled to
accept deposits from the puhllc for
savings, the postmaster general being
empowered to designate such other
offices as he will to do the same.
Depositors must be 10 years uf age
or older; accounts at first must be at
least $ 1 , and thereafter must be 10
cents or multiples of 10 . Interest at
per cent will be paid up to $500,
and one account may not be more
than $1000- Deposits shall not be
subject to garnishment. They shall
be regarded as public moneys and
safeguarded according to existing law
at preferred funds.
The postmaster general shall be
empowered to withdraw the funds
for redeposit in banks which be shall
designate as depositories.
This provision has been subject of
general debate, and it was opposed by

NO SPECIAL ELECTION
Governor Gooding Ignores Judiciary
Amendment.
It Is now claimed that Governor
Gooding refuses to call a special
election as provided by the judiciary
amendment adopted at the recent
^lection. The amendment provides
for abolishing the probate courts and
the present court system and substi
tuting a superior or county court
system to handle all district court
and probate matters. It provided
that the governor call a special elec
lion 10 days after the state board had
canvassed the election returns, to
fill the positions of superior judges
throughout the state. The governor,
under advice of the attorney general,
I declines to call the election.
There is some doubt as to the con
stitutionality of the amendment on
account of the fact that it is contra
dictory, as in one place It provides
that it become operative at once
while another provision states that it
shall go into effect in 1011 .
Under this amendment counties
casting 8000 votes for governor would
be entitled to two superior judges.
Both amendments, submitted at
the recent election, are reported to
have carried, ameodmeot No. 1, pro
viding clerical assistance for the
I countv assessor by a majority of 6606,
land No. 2, changing the Judicial
system, by a majority of 3543.
DECLINE DE NIKNME
Civil Service Takes Away
Influence" of Congressmen.
FOURTH CLASSPÔSTMASTERS
il
Are Now to be Chosen by Com
petitive Examination.
Washington, D. C., December
7 , 1908 .—Little by little during
the last twenty five years or more
since the civil service law has
been enforced, congress has seen
its patronage disappearing. It
went rapidly under Cleveland's ad
ministration and during the pres
ent administration many thousands
of offices have been put under the
protection of the civil service law.
The President has just issued an
other order which effects more
than fifteen thousand employees.
They are postmasters of the fourth
class and they are about all that
has been left to members of con
gress in the way of patronage.
Thirty or thirty-five years ago the
member of Congress of the domin
ant party was rich in patronage
"influence" as it is called here.
Not only were the postmasters of
his district his dependents and
henchmen but many clerks in
Washington in the postal service I
and in the consular service were
appointed to lucrative places by
him. That these appointees were
frequently members of his own
family, his son or his daughter,
his neice or his cousin or his
mother-in law was too universally
the case to excite comment or
criticism. "They all did it", and
the more influential the politician
the greater his entourage at the
public crib. This condition has
been gradually changed through
appointment by competitive ex
amination until the offices in the
civil service in Washington and
throughout the country are filled
by a bettir class of fairly compe
tent people. The placing of over
fifteen thousand postmasters in a
class where their tenure of office
will continue, whether they are
favored by their congressman or
not, cannot but have a salutary
effect on the postal service while
to deprive a member of congress
0 f these appointments will conduce
ro freer and fairer expression of
I opinion at the polls.
There was a change in the cabi
net last week by the retirement on
the first of December, of Mr. Met
calf, secretary of the navy, and
the appointment of Mr. Newberry
the assistant secretary to the
vacant cabinet office. Mr. Her
bert Satterlee of New York, a son
in law of the multi-millionaire
John Pierpont Morgan, was ap
pointed assistant secretary of the
navy to succeed Mr. Newberry.
It is rumored that secretary of
state Root who, it is now known,
will be elected Senator from New
York after March the fourth, will
resign the state portfolio in the
next few days and be suceeded by
the first assistant secretary o(
state, Mr. Bacon. Mr. Satterlee
the assistant secretary of the navy,
just appointed, is like Mr. Bacon

County Auditor T. L. Quarles
and Assessor C. A. Bailor left this
week for Boise to attend a com
mittee meeting of five auditors and
assessors, respectively, the com
mittees having been appointed at
the state convention of auditors
and assessors to make suggestions
on collecting taxes throughout the
state and present them in a peti
tion to the next legislature. Un
der the present method the assesor
is also the tax collector. It is
claimed this method is not only
unusual but works a hardship up
on the assessor. It is claimed the
committee will recommend that
the treasurer have charge of the
collection of taxes. It is probable
that a recommendation will be in
corporated in the petition to the
legislature seeking a different time
or times when the taxes may be
paid. At present all taxes must
be paid prior to January 01 * a
penalty of 10 per cent is attached.
This is applicable to taxes that
are assessed by field deputies dur
ing the same year.
It is claimed the committee will
recommend that real estate be as
sessed by field deputies every two
years instead of annually; that
taxes on real estate he due the
year following the assessment, and
.that personal taxes he left prac
tically as they are. It is also
proposed to make a (lat exemption
of #400 instead of on housel old
property alone, as at present.
