Mr. Blaine l<< no? so absorbed in the diversion Of
"winging Indian clubs in i>srts that he nealects
??utireiy American politics, an<l an a target In his
?r?-rvtse of striking from the shoulder h" quickly
Jind Joyfully substitutes tu<- presidents message
lor the swinging b;tg of ills gymnasium. A* a
political athlete he requires no French instruction.
In attacking the nies-mte Mr. Blaine flrst rails
m tent ion to the eager anticipation In England of
? large market for Kngllsh fabrks in the lulled
States *< a consequence of a preskjentlal
i*commen<lat|on, winch is viewed there as a free
trade manifesto. To those who lear British
competition If the turners of a tariff for protec
tion are thrown down, the mieir>--tton Is thus made
that Joyful anticipations in England should arouse
dismal forebodings in this country. lie next
draws to himself all who favor a repeal of the to
?>a.'eo tax by urging in f ppisltlon to the message
the immediate removal of that fax. "Whisky has
d'Wio a vast deal of harm in thernlfed states"
He would continue to tax It in order to reduce Its
consumption, and that it may do some good. The
temperance people will please take notice. He
t hen appeals to national pride by urgln? the ex
)<e?diture of a part of the surplus in seaboard forti- j
flc?uons, and commends to democratic perusal '
the powerful le'rer on the snhj-ct by the |
law Aamnei J. TIMen in "H.%. The wool-grower^ !
are then defended against the attacks
<4 the message, and a warning given to the south- l
??rn states of a check in their present progress if. j
in pursuant of the new policy, they get free Iron I
and coal, while tobacco Is taxed. Mr. Blaine would J
contlnue'o tax whisky so long as there Is whisky |
to tax, and when the National tiovermnenf should
nave bo use for the money, would divide the tax !
among the Federal I nlon, with the specific object
of lightening the fax on real estate. The new
Blaine vs. Cleveland controversy is an exceedingly
interesting one, and If prolongedintoibe campaign
of ism woul l be more worthy of though'ful atten
tion than the personal squabble of MM. .Mr.1
Btaine has lost nothing >>f his vigor, point. and in- 1
jrenuity as a debater.
secretary Bayard makes several proposals for
increased appropriations for the diplomatic ser
vice, which will doubt >e-s draw forth tl>* Irony of
^"ro* of the members ot the House from the west
and southwest If they are approved In committee
and reported In the next bill. Jf Mr. Allen, of
Mlanlstfppl. found too l for his wit In the bill pre
sented last year by Mr. Belmont, because there
wers ??crackers" and other -poor whites'" In the
southwest wno would consider themselves in
? iovor if they could go to England as minister
plenipotentiary at one-tenth the salary now given
?o Mr. Phelps, what will he say when h hears
that Mr. Bayunl wants to raise the salaries of the
ministers to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Corea
by fi,.VjO eath: to put the Chinese mission on
tne highest footing In the service and In
crease the pay from UVW to H7..VX): to re
store the salary of the self-emptying embassy
to Liberia to **.ijo0: to divide the united mla-Jon
to Paraguay and I rugnay into two separate mis
sions with a ?:?larv for each: arwl to make more
generous provisions for cierk-hlre all around!
crackers do n jt hlr- clerks. he will argue, and
then* Is no reason v%:.y one citizen of the 1 nired j
5>ates should b?-paid-omifh more for ornamental '
>er\tees th in ani-iiier e;:ms at some other useful
and difficult caliibg.
uf course, there will i?e ,u the present Congress
a got*! deal of this kind of ta.ii, as there has been
m every congress?n >t bet a is* tie" members in
dulging In It feel what they say, but becai;*? they
must curry favor with a certain class of constitu
ents. It is to l>e hoped, however, ihat congress-j
men generally v. dl take a more rational view of |
this subject, and resolve to <!?> one of two things. I
either provide for a creditable diplomatic repre- I
b?ntatl<>n ot thi-. country or wipeit out altogether. '
??m m*m ... ?
Atnon; t he dangers of the sea-on Is the "vl?fec
tiTe flue," which has been iytn;f jn wait through
the warm and moderate weather in order to as
?rt itself in the emergency of a cold ware. St.
I.nkes church, in Bro. tlyn, which suffered to the
extent ot g-i >,<?**> from a tire due to this cause,
headed a list of this season's victims whlch has
b?eu growing. Too great vigilance in correcting
this notab.e source ot destructive nres cannot be
?>&*r*ed. Another danger which Is of the season
In preparation If not in appearance Is that which
results from cut ting for use ice so polluted as to
convey infectious disease. The Xcw York Su?
publishes scientific oplm.>ns which cast suspicion
upon much of the Ice tut from the Hudson for use
?u New York city. Typhoid fever bacteria, the
scientists say, can stand freering, and by modern
met hods of examination are found In large quan
tities in m -'.*ed ice. if the s-wage from Troy,
Albany and smaller places on the Hudson can
dahij^roustj pollute the river for a distance 0f
thtrtv miles frotu Albany, as assr-feil. it will be
.d1 lsable for cutters of ).e in tvthr r localities to
take care that they are not also storing tjpaoiU
I?v?t an>t choi ra to <Uspen~e to their customers.
While tie* FliCdOiv Department 1$ about the
business of a -.thetM- reform, in it- hideous green I
stamps, it migiit make a gow1 point by ordering
laMmasten everywhere to eease| using the thick, !
foul, oreasy Ink which is now employed for cancel
ing starups anil imprint trig p-istmarks. The nui
?aine of thia stuff Is that if corues off on the
fingers of a persou who picks up an envelope care
Jualy. ruins fine gio>es, and defaces any super
?enptk.n igainst which it rubs in the passage of a
patk of letters through fhe nulls. There nre so
many tfood laks in the market that the use of tnis
treubie-..me ?fun is without excuse. Tue ap
pnx*. n u> perfection in the postal facilities of this
country <*ight not to lie discounted by a feature as
repulMre ,9 this is alike to good taste and good
temper.
The .ltarretion, in respect to modifying the rail- j
load routeand un^.n dep?< sit?. favored by tbecitl
/??as' Committee, given to the executive committee
which wi.l present the matter to congress, wiu
enable that committee to do much more effective
?or* for the relief of the city than if it was held
tightly bound to all th" details of the railroad plan
adopted by the citizens' committee. When a
satisfy tory settlement of the matter is secured It
will be the result of negotiation and compromise,
and If the repn sentatlv.-s of tac citizens' I oannit
tee were not permitted to depart an inch from the
iierhaps impracticabl1 plan adopted theymi^ht
-sion lose the e*r of Congress and become an ub
-tacle. instead of an kid, to relief from the evils of
railroad occupation.
