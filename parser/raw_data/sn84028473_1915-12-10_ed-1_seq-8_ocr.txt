-workhouse A motion was filed for a
new trial
All the iron and steel plants In the
valley are running to capacity and
business In this city should bo the
test in its history
SALEM
For home time there was complaint
that young men old enough to know
better made It a practlco to make ro
marks as young women passed them
and in some cases sang songs that did
not sound good to sensitive ears The
police have been instructed to break
up the practice and an arrest or two
will likely have tho desired effect
Work Is rapidly progressing on the
new Porter rubber plant
Since tho now chamber of com
merce was organized there has been a
noticeable Improvement in business
conditions in the city It shows what
organized persistent effort will ac
complish
A SCHOOL OF MANNERS
Summit county rural schools are to
have a course this year In morals
and manners Speclflclally the man
ners part of this Instruction Is to teach
country youths how to eat properly as
well as how to behave Indoors and
out of doors says an exchange
This is a pleasing innovation but it
Is unfair to Intimate that the farmer
alone Is wanting In table etiquette A
cour3o in proper deportment while eat
ing would be a pleasing accompani
ment to the service In all city restaur
ants The Instruction would be valu
able there and could be carried profit
ably into many city homes even If tho
rudiments only were taught Most of
us become panlcstrickcn according to
our temperament at tho sight of two
knives or two forks beside our plate
but tho proper use of these excess im
plements is a non essential and we
may live happily without acquiring
knowledge of their mission The man
who ladles In food with a knife who
imitates an exhaust pipe in eating
coup or competes with the road of a
wa erfall In gargling a cup of coffee
is tho man for whose schooling his
fellow diners would gladly pay any
tuition fees
There are many such every day in
our restaurants and not only in cheap
restaurants Fashionable eating hous
es and exquisite clubs harbor them as
well If the Summit county rural course
Is successful we recommend It for the
cities Warren Tribune
When shiftless people cant thluk
of any other way to annoy their neigh
bors they get a dog that howls through
the night
A man Is never too old to learnun
less he is too young to realize It
iMighty few women are so sharp that
they cant be flattered
Never twit your wife because of her
foolish Ideas Except for one of them
eb e would never have married you
The more fickle a woman is the
more Jt always hurts her when told of
JL
THE THREE POLICIES
Once upon ft time there was a beau
tlful princess who was passionately
admired and loved by everyone who
saw her picture in tho leading fashion
papers week after week as she sat on
a fence looking at a football game or
was walking with her chow dog In u
hlgb wind
One day the princess ordered if
proclamation to the following effect
sent out
Here are three Insurance policies
The oung man In all my kingdom
who can Interpret any one of them
correctly can have my hand In matri
mony
The news rapidly spread and the
next morning three young men pro
sented themselves for tho tesL
Said the first
This means that In case your pal
ace burns down you get 80 per cent of
the difference between vhat It Is ap
praised at less what the company
thinks you ought to have minus what
the last legislative body thought ought
to be conceded on account of a bad
firo that took place In Constantinople
year before last
Everybody cheered at this and tho
first suitor began to make calculations
on tho back of an envelope ns to tho
Cost of a wedding breakfast
Then said tho second suitor
Hem This Is an accident Insur
ance covering loss of limb or death or
other injury provided that tho de
ceased was in good health at the time
and did not suspect anvthlng Also
If the moon was In tho third quarter
or ho was lying under a motor car
with tho west wind then everything Is
null and void In which case the week
ly Indemnity if nny Is subject to a
fine and possible Imprisonment all
common carriers excepted
Tho second suitor was airfo highly
applauded and It really looked as If
lie might get all the gate money when
the third suitor stepped forward Ha
was as Is customary much handsom
er than tho other two and very poor
and honest and really needed looking
after but when tho princes handed
him the third Insu ance policy ho
shook his head anp refused It
Your majesty ho said you will
have to pardon me but 1 didnt know
what the test was I am young and In
nocent but I know too much I hope
to attempt to Interpret any insurance
policy In these days Sorry to lose
you but I beg to withdraw
Then the princess threw herself In
his arms while the grand vizier order
ed a couplo of underwriters burled
nllvc
I knew by the blank look on your
face darling that you wcro a suro
winner cried the princess From
Life 7f5 --
Burials Differ --
Tho modes of burial differ widely
among various peoples from tho rud
est ceremonies and methods of the
wandering tribes to tho ornate im
pressive reverent services of tho
holf ox a1 ages i the foremost files
of time
Among some tho dead aro burled
lying others sitting as is tho caso
with several of tho Indian tribes and
instances aro related where warriors
or leaders in the nations havo been
buried seated upon their favorite war
horse as was dono with tho famous
Blackbird the chief of tho onco pow
erful Omahas
But there is a remarkable agree
ment of custom for the practlco of
placing tho body east and west Somo
times tho body is placed with tho head
to tho east and sometimes to tho west
It Is held by certain writers that this
custom Is due to solar symbolism and
tho head Is placed to tho east or to
tho west according as tho dead are
thought of in connection with tho sun
rise the reputed homo ot tho deity
or tho sunset tho reputed home of tho
dead
There are however somo tribes that
lay their dead north and south and
others bury men with tho face to tho
north and women with the face to the
south while among some of the Afri
can tribes if one happens to die away
from his home he is burled facing
his native village
Disregard of Truth
If Orientals havo one fault mora
than another It is a disregard for
truth In the early days of the Eng
lish occupation of India the English
judges were astounded at the conflict
ing stories told by witnesses and they
soon lparned to set them all down as
unworthy of credence in American
courts it Is also well known that Chi
nese are very penurious of tho truth
and that no oath will prevent them
from giving witness In Egypt It is
also very easy to get native witnesses
to swear to anything true or untrue
For Instance Ahmed a native of
Cairo had a slave who peeped over
a wall into Suleimans harem and the
ladies considered themselves insulted
Suleiman wanted revenge but he could
not bring bis wives into court to tes
tify so It was agreed that Suleiman
should accuse Ahmeds camel ot walk
ing on Suleimans land A crowd of
witnesses came forward and for two
days testified about the camel and the
land until the English judge decided
In favor of Suleiman It was not
a week afterward that he discovered
to his great surprise that Suleiman
had no ground and Ahmed no camel
Warm Food
Warm bread or cake and in fact
warm food of any kind should never
be put away in a covered tin or dish
The steam makes molding certain
Vegetables become soggy and unfit for
food when treated In this manner
The more children a woman has the
fewer theories she has about raising
them
No wonder a woman seldom knows
her own mind she changes It so oft
en
But let the sluggard attend a picnic
and the ant will surely come to blmi
A man seldom knows what he does
nt want until after be acquires It
The average mans conscience is
nor elastic than his suspenders

THE MAHONING DISPATCH FBIDAY DECEMBER 10 1915
From Pond and
Take Swim
This Followed a Brandy Peach
Ornle and a Unique Fowl
Cake Walk
The spectacle of eleven buff cochin
chickens one buff rooster seven ban
tams nine Mlnorcas and three Con
necticut gray Rodneys swimming
merrily back and forth on Frank
Rues duck pond at Cedar Drove N
J while all the ducks stood on tho
bank cheered and dug worms with
their web feet set the gossips of tbe
fair village off Into an ear spllttlng
cackle
Until Duckologist Rue explained
the wherefore of this untoward con
duct In his poultry Board of Trade
the wildest sort of rumors were in cir
culation Somo thought that the Rue
fowl were bewitched
My wife had two Jars of brandled
poaches that blow ouL That is fer
mentation set in and the lids loft tho
tops of tho Jars with a loud report
Realizing that the peaches had work
ed Mrs Rue throw them out into tho
yard This was In the evening after
tho poultry had gone to bed At dawn
my man Olaf Hammerplotzowltch
P1 V- I
released tho fowl from their various
enclosures Tho moment thoy got
out they wore attracted by tho pun
gent aroma of tho brandled peaches
and dovourod them
On top of tho hennery I saw Gen
Kuropatkln my oldest Minorca roost
er Ho was laying on his back kick
ing his feet in the air and crowing
hysterically A few feet from him
Nebuchadnczzcr mjr fortune telling
drake was stretched out flat his
head hanging limply over tho eaves
and his eyes blinking feebly He had
every appearance of being paralysed
But It was not until I reached the
duck pond that I was perfectly duffi
founded Roosters and chickens wcro
rushing blindly Into tho water jind
ducking vtbelr heads under as If In
Bneffort to cool them SJTTFa
II is all a fallacy Mr Smith
about chickens being unable Jo
ewlm inflamed as they wcro by
those brandled peaches they swam
about boldly and gracefully Not
that but thoy drove tho ducks off
tbj pond riarvxi -
I dont know how long those
chickens and roosters would havo re
mained out there on the pond If a
water snake hadnt come up to tho
surface I never saw such panic
among poultry before It much
resembled a stampede in the psycho
pathic ward at Bellevue Hospital
when a parade of elephants goes by
I suppose the ducks aro back on
the pond again and the chickens are
scratching gravel as usual ventured
George Henry Smith
Yes that is since the big rain
the ducks have been in the pond But
there were three days when thero
wasnt any pond
What do you mean asked
George Henry Smith his eyes wid
ening with astonishment
I mean just what I cay snappod
back the duckoIoglsL Tho next morn
ing after my poultry had devoured
those brandled cherries they were
smitten with a terrific thirst and
drank the pond dry The ducks drank
it up on one side and the chickens
on the other They not only drank
my pond dry but almost emptied the
well
I suppose said 0 IL Smith a
glint of suspicion flickering In his
eye that they drew the water from
the well by tbe bucketful Worked
the crank eh
No renjied Mr Rue They did
not use the bucket at all They got
the garden hose out -of the cellar let
half of It down the well and ran the
other half down bill They Upturned
the water out of the welL Wb those
fowl of mine were so consumed with
thirst that theyd have dug a well to
et water and But George Henry

Reparation Must Be Made for Amerleti
Lives Lost in Sinking of Ancona
VESSEL ATTACKED WITHOUT WARNINI
Government Holds That It Has Beer
Established That the Ship Was
Fired Upon While Boats
Were Being Lowered
Washington Dec 9 A vigorous
protest against the sinking of the
steamship Ancona by an Austrian sub
marine has been sent to Austria bj
Secretary Lansing It was learned
that the note was sent following Tues
days cabinet meeting
The Demands
Demands made on Austria are
That tho government disavow tho
act that reparation and indemnities
bo given Americans concerned that
assurances bo given that there will bo
no repetition of such warfare that
the submarine commander guilty of
tho outrage bo punished by tho gov
ernmcnL
Austrias unsatisfactory explana
tion which conflicted with tho official
reports of United States consuls at
Algiers NaplcB and Marseilles nnd
tho report of Ambassador Pago at
Rome prompted tho protesL Tho
Italian statement nnd tho stories of
tho survivors wcro also widely at va
riance with Austrias version of tho
facts
Tho United States takes tho un
qualified position that it has been es
tablished that tho Ancona was at
tacked without warning It Is also
held as an established fact that the
ship was fired upon whllo lifeboats
wero being filled with passengers
Thcso conclusions aro reached by
this government despite the denial In
Austrias first statement of tho alle
gations of tho American survivors and
tho Italian government which were
denounced as mendacious inven
vcntlons A second dispatch from
Austria was to the offect that a re
port could not bo mado until tho state
ment of tho submarlno commander
was obtained
Ono of tho latest communications
to tho state department was from
Consul Dean Mason at Algiers who
stated unqualifiedly that passengers
wero still aboard tho Ancona when It
sank
Officials Irritated
Thus far this government has not
been apprised of tho report made by
tho submarlno commander to his gov
ernment Tho delay has Irritated
jdmtaMraJJpri pfllclals partclularly In
view of thoattack on tho Standard
Oil steamer Potrolito by a submarine
flying the Austrian flag
The protest was sent to Ambassa
dor Penfield at Vienna with Instruc
tions to deliver It at onco to the Aus
trian foreign office It Is understood
this government does not Intend to
temporize with Austria It proposes
to make that government subscribe
without further delay to tho principle
that non combatants In vessels at
tacked by submarines must be given
an opportunity to reach places of
safety providing tho vessel attacked
does not attempt to escape

Wednesday night over the case of the
American steamer Communlpaw
owned by the Standard Oil Co which
has been variously reported as
shelled sunk and captured The last
official word was from Ambassador
Page at Borne He stated that a re
port said the Communlpaw had been

December blew in on the wings of the

While the old woman plucked nt
her goose
And the feathers that fluttered sur
rounded his form
With a garment delightfully loose
And he took off his cap with a wave
in salute
His fingers the window pane strum
ming
And ho said Say youso guys its
tips you want shootl
Huh I Dontcha know Christmas l
coming
December blew in on the wings of the
gale
And boosted the holiday trade
For merchants swapped merchandise
rich for the kale
And bargains were readily made
Tho Spirit of Christmas collected his
fees
For spite of the cold that was numb
ing
Old Santas assistants were busy as
bees
Doing certain that Christmas Is com
ing
December iblew in on the wings of the
wind
But ho worked every Inch ot the
way
He smoothed every road till his fingers
were skinned
For he had to make tracks for a
sleigh
When Dancer and Pranccr come tot

Their heels will come clicking and
humming
December announces with confidence
slick
That Santa with Christmas Is com

HAPPINESS
Money will not procure hnpplnesp

Happiness makes every task a pleas

an optimistic worker nt a pleasant
task can perform It in way but well
Happiness Is not only its own reward
but it is an Irresistible magnet which

wards And happiness can know no
evil evil happiness Is contradiction
of terms Happiness Is a religion in

jumped Just over the very goal of

It a girl wants to marry and Is wise
she never nttempts to appear more Ir
telligent than the man whom she is
trying to Induce to pay her board for

Tather Time probably bands a wo

merely as a reminder that she hasnt
been forgotten
The real difference between a por
ous plasteand a sponging relative Is
that you can pry the porous plaster
loose
A girl with a pair of natural rosy
cheeks and a couplo ot dimples can
get nearly any old thing sho wants
You cant convince tho owner of a
small automobile that a big one is
worth the money It costs
Toadstools are often mistaken for
mushrooms just as gall Is frequent
ly mistaken for genius
Eliminate politics religion and the
weather and there wouldnt be much
left to talk about
The Inventor of rubber tips for pen

What most married men would re
