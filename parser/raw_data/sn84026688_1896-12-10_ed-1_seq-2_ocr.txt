WASHIHGTOW LETTER.
From our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, Dec. 7th, 1896.
The Congressional mill began opera
tions today, but if the other mills that
have lately started their machinery do
not do more to bring about good times
than this session of Congress is likely
from any present indications to do, we
shall not have good times for sometime
to come. President Cleveland’s message
is interesting enough in its way, and if
he had a party behind him able to con
trol legislation, some of bis recommen
dations might have attracted wide at
tention, but as be is virtually playing a
lone hand very little interest is express
ed ia the message with its seventeen
thousand words. One Senator jocular
ly remarked of it; "Cleveland didn t
write that message for the fifty-fourth
Congress, but for posterity and history;
perhaps they will give his ideas the at
tention that Congress denies them, but
I have my doubts.” If the tendency to
increase the length of the Presidents
messages to Congress is kept up, it will
soon be in order to do away with read
ing them in the Senate and House
Many think it already in order. The
Senators and Representatives all have
printed copies of the message, placed in
their hands before the reading begins,
so that the reading is nothing more than
a perfunctory formality at best.
Additional Locals.
The Town Hall fair will open December
22nd. In one respect it will exceed all that
we have held; in the matter of entertainments
something exceptionally fine will be given
every evening.
Mr. Edward Koontz, a prominent citizen
of Frederick, president ot the Junior Fire
Company and Internal Revenue Collector
for this district, died on Tuesday last, aged
about 68 years.
The Gleaners Beneficent Association of
Trinity Reformed church will render a spec
ial program next Sunday evening, December
13lh at 7 o’clock, at which time Mrs. Dr.
Cyrus Cort, late of Japan, who labored seven
years as a missionary in that country, will
lecture on Japan. The lecture will be quite
a treat for our people. The public is cordi
ally invited to be present. Come early in
order to secure a scat.
[communicated]
Editor Clarion I was much gratified
by the reference made in your editorial col
umns to the series of lectures given in Ply
mouth church on the “Bible as Literature,, 1
by Dr. Lyman Abbott. Not because of the
meager information conveyed in the brief
extracts but because It is a new and praise
worthy departure in the newspaper to give
attention and space to the discussion of such
questions- The people are interested in these
themes, and could with profit to themselves
and others, stand more of it; but unfortunate
ly all such discussions are confined to our
high-priced monthlies and other standard
periodicals which very rarely make their
appearance in the average home.
Dr. Abbott is one of the ablest scholars
and most esteemed Christians in the orthodox
communion. He is to Congregationalism
what Dean Stanley and Matthew Arnold
were, and Canon Farrar and Heber Newton
are to the Episcopal church; what Dr. Lori
mer and Prof Loy are lo the Baptist com
munion, aud what Drs. Briggs and Barrows
are to Presbyterianism. Prof. Loy has been
for the past twenty years, while iu fellowship
With the Baptist communion, teaching in
Harvard College, the views of the so-called
“Higher Criticism,” 1. c., the Bible from a
rational standpoint based upon the ripest
scholarships of Germany and England.
Rabbi Hirsch, the most liberal Reform Jew
in this country as Professor of Hebrew Lit
erature is today leaching the same views in
the new Chicago University. Prof. Paul
OASTOTHA.
Haupt in Johns Hopbine University, and it
is superfluous to add that the presidents ol
our leading universities would not occupy
their positions were they not abreast with
the same ripe Scholarship. Our wisest think
ers are coming to see that if the Bib’.o is to
retain its hold upon the minds and hearts of
the people, it must be by our bravely taking
it tor what it is—as literature pure and sim
ple, written and inspired in no way different
from other literature, and while recognizing
Its many scientific inaccuracies and errors,
they ore endeavoring to point out its beauty,
value and religious helpfulness as literature.
With a rational view of the bible entrenched
in our minds, we can take up the study of a
standard author without the fear of gomg
into religious spasms over every statement
that does not conform to our traditional ideas.
Nay, we can go further, aud study even sci
entific evolution without losing or lowering
our faith in God and man. The above schol
ars so far as I have been able to interpret
their writings in our standard periodicals,
arc believers in a theory of evolution which
makes unnecessary the miracle of a special
creation, and regard as a beautiful myth
common to other races and religions, the
stories of creation contained in Genesis,
chapters 1 and 2. The unity of all life from
monad to man as announced by Emerson,
crudely stated by Darwin, amply reviewed
and correctly restated by Huxley, Tyndal',
Wallace, and others, and pul into form ns
American literature by John Fiske, never
had as many believers within the orthodox
communion as it has today. Once learn
through our daily press which goes into every
home, what our ablest scholars are thinking
and saying on these high themes, and no
churchman with a mere pooh, pooh, and
wave of his hand, can sweep away from our
minds the finest results of modern scholar
ship .

With sorrow we note the death of Mrs.
William Buhrman who was stricken down
with paralysis on Friday night the 27th, ult.,
and after a week’s illness died on Saturday
afternoon last. She had been in very poor
health for more than a year past and suffered
from frequent attacks of severe nervous pros
tration and heart trouble. Mrs. Buhrman
was in her 60th year. The funeral services
were held on Tuesday morning by the gath
ering of a large relationship and friends, and
her remains were interred in the family lot
upon our cemetery. The family have the
deep sympathy of our people in this their
great bereavement.
Interesting Rumors. —We note in the
daily papers statements, more or less direct,
to the effect that the W. M. U. R. Co is de
bating the question of the removal of their
shops from Union Bridge. Hagerstown and
Williamsport are both hoping to profit by
such action, but as both cannot, so should
neither have any reasonable hope of securing
them. No wise management places shops at
the terminus of the road. At the shops are
to be found the idle engines, wreck outfit aud
the entire emergency men and equipment of
the road and no other than the midway lo
cation admits of perfect efficiency. It is at
Thunuont that these conditions are met; it
is nearer to Emory Grove and Highfield
Junctions than Hagerstown and equidistant
from Edgemout Junction. Further, it is at
the foot of the grade whcie a‘‘help< r” engine
would take the freight trains lo the top of
the mountain instead of dividing them here,
as Is now frequently done. As between Ship
pensburg or Cherry Run and Baltimore, we
arc almost exactly midway We do not lack
a single advantage or facility possessed by
another point on the line of road, and in ad
dilion to the essentials already noted, cheap
laud and low rents lor employes are lo be
quoted in favor of Thunnont.
President Bokee in an after-dinner speech
here on the occasion of the formal opening of
the road, in Mcchanicstown, twenty-fix years
ago, said this point was destined to become
“the Piedmont of the Western Maryland
Railroad,” and to our people these words
have never ceased re echoing with a proph
etic ring; it may be that that prophecy is
about to be fulfilled.
The present management is not given to
sentimental policies ; the road has grown to
be the pretentious system that it is,under that
management, aud solely by the application of
strictly business principles lo an aggressive
policy and on this circumstance is grounded
the strongest hope that Thunnont may win
in this contest for re location of the shops.
We believe that an impartial judgment,
from a strictly “railroad” pointof view.wo’d
award to Thurmont to be the end of divisions,
cast and west, the helpers’ station and hence,
perforce, the Company’s shops.
Further, the Company owns a large tract
of land here, unfortunately not well suited lo
be a site for the shops, but which would be
increased in value as building sites, lo an ex
tent that it is no over-estimate to lay it an
offset against the entire cost of transfer of
shops, and besides, the W. M- R. R. Co.
knows the temper of Thurmont; it has alrea
dy bought two depot sites and will buy any
other desirable thing that it secs.
The Business Men’s Association has herein
once again an opportunity to give some evi
dence of vitality; it is splendidly equipped
for such work and a very plain call to duty
is sounded, if there be aught of foundation
for these rumors.

Owing to the existence of a counter-attrac

Reflection* of a Bachelor.
[From the New York Press ]
There are very few men who aren’t asham
ed of some of their relatives.
When a man admires a married woman
and she knows it, she will never admit that
he is homely.
Why is it when women sleep together they
always spend hall the night talking about
their husbands?
When a man tells another man about his
approaching marriage, he tries to use a jaded,
matter of-fact lone.
A woman never sees a fussy little wedded
net cap for a baby without wanting to smug
gle her face down iu it.
The worst tempered woman in the world
tries her best to look angelic when she lias
her picture taken with a baby in her lap.
A woman can never quite understand what
is going to become of her husband when
they get to heaven, If there is no such thing
as marriage there.
The average man spends the first six
months after his marriage wondering why he
didn’t do it sooner, and the next six wonder
ing why he did. it at all.

When a man’s stomach is out of order,
and his digestion don’t work; when his liver
gets to be sluggish and won’t clear the bile
out of bis blood, it is time for him to look
out for himself. He gets no nourishment
out of his food. His blood gets thicker and
thicker with impurities. His nerves get irri
tated. He loses energy and fighting force.
He may aay, “ I can stand it, 1 will feel
better to-morrow;” but the chances are he
will feel worse to-morrow and worse still
next day. He ought to put himself right at
once. He needs Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical
Discovery. It is made for just this condition.
It rouses up the digestive and nutritive
organs, and gives them power to extract
from the food all the nutritious elements
and transform them into rich, nourishing
blood. It enables the liver to cleanse out all
bilious impurities and pour into the circula
tion an abundance of highly vitalized blood,
full of the life-giving red corpuscles which
build up healthy flesh, muscular strength,
and nerve-energy. It does not make flabby
flesh. It is the only suitable tonic and
