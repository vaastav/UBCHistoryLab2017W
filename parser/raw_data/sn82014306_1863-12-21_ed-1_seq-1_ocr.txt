Tkae lutereat an the tute Debt Cr
ernor I.TIorton'a Plea.
The Journal in a labored article in its issue of
Monday, evidently prepared by one in high au
thority, attempts to justify the course of the Gov
ernor in usurp Lug powers to administer the State
gOTeramcnt upon hU own account and not in ac
cordance with the plain provisions of the consti
tution and the laws. There is one fact the
Journal docs not deny and that is the Republi
can members of the House deserted their seats
remained away and thus prevented the legisla
tion necessary to maintain the good faith of the
State not only to the holders of her bonds but to
her other creditors. The payment of one class
of creditors is certainly no more obligatory upon
the State than another and assured those who
had advanced money to raise troops to All the
quotas required by the General Government for
the suppression of the rebellion, were entitled tc
as much consideration as the foreign bondholders
whose sympathies are against the Federal Gov
ernrtent in the struggle for what. is termed by
Governor Moetos and his partizan friends, the
nation's life. The Journal complains in behalf
of His Excellency that the appropriation bills
were not matured and presented before the seces
sion of the Republican members. It says:
Mr. Brannam, one of the ablest men in the
State, and the most experienced in legislation,
wntoo the Committee of Ways and Means, and
he repeatedly urged Ihe early completion of those
billrt.' He knew how frequently and easily im
proper or extravagant appropriations are made in
the hurry of the last hours of a session, and he
wanted the bills introduced in time to allow them
to be thoroughly examined before the pressure
came But his representations were unheeded.
Now it is well known by all who bare any
knowledge of legislation, that it requires great
consideration and labor to prepare appropriation
bills, and they are never presented until near tbe
close of the session as the action of the Legisla
ture, which cannot be anticipated, often shapes
many of its provisions. The reference to Mr.
Bbavhax la unfortunate. ' In 1H61 be was Chair
nun of the Committee of Ways and Means, and
the appropriation bills of thit session were not
presented any earlier than they would have been
at the last, if the Republicans had not skedaddled
from the alarm occasioned by their owu shadows.
The Republicans were absent the last twelve
working days of the session, hence the plea that
there was not time to carefully consider and ex
amine the character of the appropriations is all
twaddle. But if the Republican members were
afraid of "disloyal" legislation, they could have
returned on the last day of the session
when bill can be constitutionally enacted into
laws, and passed the appropriations, defeated
all other legislation and thus thrown the respon
sibility of the failure of laws necessary to carry
on the State government in subordination to the
constitution and the statutes upon their political
opponents. But such a course would not suit
their (actions and revolutionary schemes. And
it roust not be forgotten that Governor Moktox
was aiding and encouraging the revolutionary
conduct of his partisan friends in the Legislature.
The Journal also complains that the members
made appropriations for their own pay and mile
age, but the force of this objection is lost when
it is remembered that this appropriation was made
early in the session at the suggestion of the able,
experienced and honest Mr. Braxhay.
The Journal endeavors to justify the conduct
of Governor Mortos by quoting the course of
Governor Wiixabd in 1857 as a precedent. The
Republicans condemned Governor Willard and
the State officers of that year for assuming the
responsibility of ' paying - the indebted
ness of the Stat without legis
lative appropriation. . The two ca.cs
are very dissimilar. In 1857, there was no em
bezzlement law. And the Legislature of 1859
passed an act "for the manner of receiving, hoi -ing
and disbursing tho public moneys of the
State," which prohibited the State officers from
withdrawing ur money from the Treasury unless
"in conformity to appropriations made by law."
The Legislature of that year and of 1861 evi
dently intended that this clause should include and
cover the payment of the interest upon the
publio debt, for there was an appropriation
in the appropriation bül of each of the
regular sessions of those legislatures, both 1853
and 1861, for the money necessary to pay the ac
cruing sums due semi-annually for the two suc
ceeding years. The able and experienced Mr.
Bkaxhax voted for the law passed in 1859 for
regulatinj the treasury system; in 1861 forth
embeizlcment act whicmade it a penal offence
for any State Seer to violate the treasury law of
1859 and for the appropriation made by the
legislatures of 1859 and 1861 to pay the interest
upon the public debt, hence he mutt have been
of the opinion that money could not lawfully be
taken from tbe treasury to pay the interest with
out specific appropriation by the legislature.
When these facts are considered, fan there
be any doubt but that tho (State officers did right
in refasiDg to pay any money oat of the public
treasury except fir eon fortuity to appropriations
made by lawf . Neither can there be any ques
tion la rejard to the duty of Governor MoaTOX.
Tb Us Constitutional Contention provided
biennial aewions.but anticipating that some con-i
tingency like that which has occurred might
arise, gave the Governor of the State the power
to assemble the Legislature in special session
whenever the public interests demanded it. But
that body did not anticipate that any Governor of
Indiana would be so reckless of his constitution
al obligations as to assume powers expressly con
fided to the General Assembly of the State. The
responsibility of the failure of the laws necessary
to carry on the State government as the Consti
tution prescribes, is upon Governor Mobtox for
advising, and the Republican members of the
Bouse, who, to carry out partisan schemes and to
gratify partisan prejudices, seceded and left it
without a quorum for the transaction of business.
And that responsibility is continued, so ftr as the
Governor is concerned, by his failine to employ
the constitutional remedies for the embarrass
ments of the State. ,
Ä few words in regard to the assurances that
if Governor Moktox convened a special session
of the Legislature, the appropriation bills would
be promptly enacted before any legislation would
be proposed which even he might regard of a
partisan character The Journal, speaking for His
Excellency, first denies that such assurances had
been proffered, and then it admits that "in New
York, last June, Mr. Auditor Ristthu said to
Governor Moktox that snch assurances bad been
made, and he (Mr. R.) had letters so. show it."
Mr, Ristixx went to New York upon the tele
gram of the'Governor, to confer with him upon
some plan to par the interest which would, not
conflict with the . decision of the Supreme
Court.' Mr. R. suggested an extra session
a the proper means of relieving the
embarrassment, and then it was that Mr. R.
named those assurances to avoid the objections
of the Governor to legislative relief. Mr.Risnxs
had over twenty letters in his possession from
Democratic members, with the assurences, but
the Governor did not even ask to be shown the
letters, or express any desire to find out the
names. He well knew that he could have them,
and Mr. R. was unwilling to press a matter to
which the Governor was so averse. If Governor
Monro had been faithful to the constitution
and laws of the State, the present state of affairs
would not exist and he knows it, and the charge
that the State officers intrigued to defeat the pay
ment of the interest upon the public debt is with
out any foundation whatever.
The President') Plan.
Mr. Scmxeb's theory of State suicide and his
proposition to reduce the rebel States to a terri
torial (condition, is less objectionable than the
scheme of Mr. Lixcolx as developed in his
message. Under a territorial government the
people of the disfranchised States would have
more rights than in the plan proposed by the
President, The scheme of Mr. Likcolx propos
es a complete degradation of the insurgent States,
for their citizens are cut off from all rights what
ever, unless they consent to an entire submission
to the edicts and manifestoes of the
President and Congress, no matter bow
unjust, arbitrary, oppressive and unconstitutional
they may be. The idea advanced by the Presi
dent, and re-echoed by the Republican press, is
that the inhabitants of the rebel States, regard
less of their views and relations to the rebellion,
must yield implicit obedience to the policy of
the party in power as a condition of their being
permitted to resume their former relations to the
Government; and yet this same party published
to these same people and to the world "that the
war is jiot waged on our part in any spirit of op
pression, nor for any purpose of conquest or
subjugation." The Administration prints say that
90 out of every 100 rebels can be restoieJ to
every right to morrow if they will do wlmtT
Make a Union with abolitionism and subscribe to
the political dogmas of the party in power,
no matter how much they maj regard them
as opposed to the interests and perpetuity of the
Government and the happiness and well being of
the people. And sueii a proposition is heralded
as not only fair, but liberal and magnanimous,
and as a restoration of popular rights to the peo
ple of the rebel States.
The war for the Uuion is practically over. If
it had been waged folely fcr the pur
poses expressed in the Ckittexdf.x reso
lution of July 122, 1SG1, to-day we
should hsve peace and it restored
Union "with the dignities, equality, and the
rights of the several States unimpaired." The
only issue now is the abolition of slavery, and to
accomplish that end solely the war is being prose
cuted. The President sars the party he repre
sents will accept no terms of reconciliation unless
all his proclamations :n reference to slavery are
recognized as of binding force and implicitly
obeyed.
Mr. Lixcolx had the golden opportunity to
end the rebellion, if he had issued a proclamation
of amnesty making the only condition of forgive
ness and the only test of loyalty returned alle
giance and fealty to the Constitution and the
Union of the States under it, but he has cast it
from him to gratify radicalism and fanaticism.
For such a consideration the nation must suffer
the terrible evils and calamities which are now
upon it.
'Who Are They"
The Journal expresses an anxiety to know the
names of the filty-nine members of Congress
who voted for a proposition favoring "the termi
nation of this bloody, destructive and Inhuman
war, and for securing peice under the Constitu
tion upon terms of justice and equality." The
court orgitn' expresses the opinion that "the re
erd ofthxt vote will be the epitaph over the po
litical grare of every free sUtesauii found in it."
What possible objection can any man bare to
securing peace undtT the Constitution upon terms
of justice and tqumlilgT Certainly the Journal
should not otject to a proposition of tint nature.
Before the war beg in, and months after the com
oienrement of this civil war." it deliberately
expressed the opinion that the loss of a dozeu
States was preferable to civil war: it discussed
the advantages of separation from the dissatisfied
States, od pronounced the Constitution of tbe
Confederacy a better chart of government than
our oarn. Yet the central organ of the
Republican'or "Union" party of Indiana, with
such a record, denounces men who favor peace
upon "justice and equality uoder the Constitu
tion" a measure in "sympathy with rebellion.'
But what else cart be expected from a pirty or
gan that is willicg to eat its own words cral iu
lime -to advance personal and party interests?
A Sctblixbj Idba. It i verr seldom any
Tory jjood thing comes out of Ulassachaictt"; but
the action of the people of Essex county in the
last election was not bad. The New bodford
Standard says:
MA representative has been elected from a dis
trict in Essex county in this State, who I tad been
aided as a pan per the last year. lie was voted
for in order thus to save the town from the ex
pen of his supportl r
The last sentence reveals the essentially Yan
kee motive for this action, anart from which the
proceeding was not bad, and suggests a new and
desirable mode of disposing of public paupers.
The IWessuge Commend of the Pres J
- tue new Jorg ueraia, in commenting upon ;
the President's message and proclamation, re
marks: The favored classes of the people of encb of !
the rebellious States embraced in the Presi- ;
dent's amnesty are required, firf, to indorse!
the emancipation proclamation, and, seconlly, to
organize a State Government, declaring shivery i
abolished, before they can be restored to the J
Toiou. In the Scriptural account of Sodom and '
Gomorrah it is stated that the Lord promised to '
Abraham to spare those wicked cities if even
. . I II. c J .1 t . '
tea nguieuus men cuuia oo lounu tuerein; out
they could not be found, and we know the re
,sult. We dare say that our Father Abraham's
."one-tenth" proposition was suggested by this
propositiou of the original Father Abraham of
ten righteous men iu Sodom, and we fear that
: the result will be the same that the righteous
.men required to save the rebellious States from a
-destructive storm of fire and brims to ue will not
be found. .
But Preideut Lincoln wishes to be understood
that in offering this plan of restoration it does not
. follow that it is irrevocable, or rnty not be set
aside for some better plan. Indeed, be suggests
that the rebellious State may return through the
. door of Con . ess, but that Congress alone can
determine when and how that door is to be open
red. We oncluäa ixt Ur. Lincoln's plan will
be a fiilure,' and it is quite possible that it has
been submitted more with a. view to open the
question of an amnesty and a reftoration, or more
;to conciliate tbe radicals, than from any hope of
. the acceptance of the overtues bj the States con
cerned, or any one of them not under the abso
lute control of our nrmies.
We are uow adrift at sea beyond our ancient
landmarks, and upon vrlmt höre we may rewcli
the anchorage of peace it would be vain to con
jecfure. We can only hope that from the very
agitation which the restoration plan of the Mess
age ill create we may re ich some satisfactory
halTway house or rest.
The New York JouruM of Commerce says of
the message: .
The document Is marked by the unual charac
teristics of rough rhetoric and a tlefi ince of ordi-
nry rule of construction. Ita wmls and sen
tences fail in heip, instead of flowing in a con
nected stream, and it is therefore difficult read
in" Tbe serious question is whether this p'an of the
President is calculated to briir about peace
whether it is a proclamation that is likely to be
wr 11 received by any considerable portion of the
people engaged in the insurrection, and to hasten
the close of the war. It is plain that what Mr.
Lincoln wauls is peace and abolition. He does
not take into consideration at all the question, of
peace without alolitioii. In this respect he lends
himself entirely to the radical abolitionists, and
eviiieutly expects to continue the war till slavery
is actually abolished where his old
proclamation has theoretically abolished it.
The Pres-ideutV idea of closing the war is by a
sort of individual and personal contract with each
an i every roan, woman and child, to the eü'ect
that if the person will sustain all the policy of the
Aiimitiistration and all its act and proclamations.
he or she will be D-irdoned. The offer is doubt
less one whk.-h the President has the ri;ht to
make If the people will accept it, it is a very
neat and pretty way of doing up the war. But it
certainly does not hold out very brilliant pros
pects of success ns paci factory measure.
Neither U the President's halting and hesitating
method of defending his position and plan at all
encouraging or inspiring. Lie does not seem to
hare faith in it, he introduces it with an argument
in its favor, which is of course an admission that
it need defence; and this is a very bad feature in
any public meisnreofso great importance as this.
There is nothing statesmanlike in the plan or the
paper defending it. It indicates a narrow view cf
the grand questions of government involved in
the future pacification of the country, and a to
tal failure to raise to the solemn importence of
the events crowding into .the close of his Ad
ministration. Without perception of the real
condition of the country, and without ability to
master the grand problem before him, we have
here from Mr Lincoln a proclamation which is,
as compared with the vast throes of the nation
which have seemed to produce it, a very small
and pui'.j affiir ,
Was it not eiwujtii to require an oath to sup
port the Constitution of the United States, and
all laws nmue and acts done in pursuance of it?
Why force the nej;ro iu the veiy nostrils of the
Southern mun wh:se submission to law you seek?
Is it said the oilh require- no more than that?
With all ilue respect to Mr. Lincoln, it requires
a great deal in re. It requires the support of a
proclamation nhirh one half of the people of the
North do uot support. It requires the support
of laws which one-half, of the people of
the North repudiate as null and void, because
unconstitutional. The doctrine is not yet foiced
on Americans that they must obey a law until it
is declared unron-tirutioiu!. On the contrary,
the American is compelled tojude and take re
sponsibilities on himself which in no other :ountry
are imposed on the citizen; and if. in ol'cdicnceto a
law, an American citizen injures neighbor, and
the law U declared unconstitutional, he is compell
ed to pay the damages It is tio defense to pleid "I
obeyed a law on the statute books." This proc
lamation requires the taking ol n uath.ns a con
dit'on ol pardon, wh'cli hilt the citizens of the
Northern States would refuse to take. It is true
the President may proffer psrdon on conditions.
But the question is whr:t.er bis tonilitions are
wise, practical, likely to do good. We are very
much afraid thit the A dministration knows no
more how to mike peace th in it has heretofore
eeeine 1 to know about making war. We see no
pro.spect of peice or good to the rrwintry in the
Pretti'lent's plan. On the contrary, we fear he
has thrown away gclJei opportunity for the
eountry, for the sake ol winning a support amoug
Northern radicals for himself.
'
The teneral scone of the President's plan may
be saiil to le of the extreme radical sorU He
almost, but not qu te, recognizes Mr. Sumner's
State suicide theory. He ignores the present ex
istence of State tr'tvemmentji, regards them as
defunct, and a iticipates a sort of territorial reor
gtnizuinn In this view he is neither sound nor
' consistent. But what ate soundness and consist
encv worth in our ri iT
The New York World, in reviewing the oe
aaije. says:
President Lincoln has, at least, succeeded in
, producing something unique in ' tho form of an
anuu-il communication I the opening of Con
gress Its main tenure is a proclamation, beir
inr even date with th? message, and as essential
to redeem the document don drv and vapid in
signißc Micr a the t-har.cter of Hamlet is to tbe
play of that nauie The pincl ini ition. and what
is saw! in the message about th proclamation,
are all the President has communicated which
will fill public attention' Thi ia m nt extra
ordinary mode of promulgating a proclamation
which pnrpons to b primarily addressed to the
people of rtie rebel Stages.
The World then ennsidens the document in
two differctiaspects: .
First. I respect to its merits as a political
tu mi lea to isaaed by a party chief; and.
Second, In view of Ha character as a measure
of statesmanship for tbe reconstruction of the
Union. -
As a pirty manifesto looking to the approach
Ing Presidential election, the World regards it as
a creditable specimen of political dexterity, and
expressed the opinion ht Mr. Lincoln has fairly
got the inside track for the Republican nomina
tion next spring.
The World thus comment upon the states
manship of the proposed measures of the Presi
dent: ,
When we turn from the politician to the states
man, we are impressed with a sorrowlul convic
tion t'iat Mr. Lincoln, h n far more capable
adviser in the former capacity than he has io the
latter. A a means of recovering the South and
reconstructing th Union, his chemo is simply
absurd. To divide the emancipation proclama
tion (the most odious and detested in southern
eyes of all Mr. Lincoln's act,) into individual
dose, to be administered in the form of an oath,
U about as wine as would be an attempt to con
ciliate a nation of Jews by swearing them all to
dine on pork No wonder that, on this system,
Mr. Lincoln expects that his new. Stste govern
ments will be the woik of a chosen few!
And such a scheme of a government) " It is to
be a pyramid resting on its apex; States are to be
created by les than one-tentbof the legal voters.
And to cap the absurdity tbij is to be done under
color of that provision of the Constitution by
which the United States guarantee to every State .
a republican form of government. It is an odd
kind of republicanism which divides a communi
ty into two classes by preseuting an odious oath
which a vast majority are certain to reject, and
then erect the minority into a privileged class,
and investing them with , all the political power.
Mr. Madison, iu explaining in the Federalist the
provision of the Constitution relating to tbe guar
antee to the States of republican form of gov
ernment, asks, "Whit, then, are the distinctive
characters of the republican form?" In answer
Ine this question (the italic word is his) he says:
"It iantial to such a government that it be
derived from the great body of the Bociety, not
from an inconsiderable proportion or a favored
class of It." And yet Mr. Lincoln, pretending to
act under this very clause of the Constitution,
proposes to invest the government of a State in
one-tenth of iu voting population. And he
makes sure that his political aristocracy or gov
erning class will not be too large by compelling
all its members to swear allegiance to the Eman
cipation proclamation.
: Mr. Lincoln's allegation against the disloyal
States is as false in fact as it is absurd in theory.
It is not trne that these States, or any of them,
have abandoned the republican - form of govern
ment. While adhering to Republican govern
ment, they are committing treason by levying war
against the United States. Mr. Seward, in the'
dispatch from which we have alieady quoted, ad
mits and maintains that the seceded States have
not changed their republican form- He said:
"The rights of the Statt. and the condition of
every human bein in them will remain precisely
the same, whether the revolution shall succeed or
whether it shall fail In one eise the States
would be federally connected with the new con
federacy; in the other they would, as now, be
members of the United States; but their constitu
tions 'and laws, custom!, habits and institution?,
in either caso will remain the same "
It is clear, then, that Mr Lincoln's scheme is
not only pre posteroiw in itself, but that it is the
very hiht of absurdity to pretend to find author
ity for it in that part of the Constitution which
qmrantees to the States a epublicin form of
government. It is well adapted for immediate
political effect in the North, and for obstructing
and defeating the object of the war in the Suth.
The New York News styles the message "The
Despot's Edict, and comments upon it in this
wise:
The "policy of emancipation" "and of em
ploying black soldiers" is first allade l to in con
nection with our political situation, and having
been thoroughly exhausted, gives place to the
labyrinthine outlines of a plan to make abolition
the imperative condition of reconstruction.
No unprejudiced mind can dwell upon this part
of the meisage without the conviction that Mr.
Lincoln has determined to prosecute this war
hereafter exclusively in the interest of emancipa
tion and according to the extreme purposes of
the radicals. If the intention were openly avowed,
one might give the man at least the tribute due
to boldness; but there is a low cunning exhibited
in his parade of sophistry that jars upon the
feelings as something which, when associated
with Ideas of official dignity and honor,
brin shame and humiliation to the entire people.
The plot, for it is nothing less than n tteacherous
and despicable clot, is not developed in the mess
age proper. To give it at once the force of an
Executive edict, be appends a proclamation, pur
porting to be one of amnesty, but in reality de
fined to eive to the retainers of the AJmiuistra
tion in the preeded States the power to create
new State Constitutions hostile to slavery. "A
number of persons not less than one tenth iu
number of the votes cast in such States at the
Presidential election of the year of our Lord
1711, each having takeu the oath aforesaid, and
excluding all others," m ty "re establish a State
government," which "shall be recognized as the
true government of the Sute?" "And it is en
Cyed as not improper that in any State, the
bound irv, the sub-divisions, the Constitution and
the general code of laws be maintained, subject
only to the modifications ro ide necessary by the
conditions herein before .tated (those of the
emancipation proclamation.) and such others
which may be deemed expedient by the new
State Government" Tbe suggestion is that it
is uot ."iimiroper" to letaiu the old Con
stitution, but the suggestion amounts to an in
vitation to do otherwise By observing the
tenor of "the oath aforesaid," it will be seen
that no person can astist in the formation of
these new State governments who is not sworn to
"abide by and faithfully support all acts of Con
gress passed during the existing rebellion, with
reference to slave." and also "to abide by and
faithfully support all tocI imatious of the Resi
dent made during the existing rebellion having
reference to slaves." Putting this and that to
gether, the simple-t logician will perceive that it
becomes impossible for any State to return to the
Union except under the oath of its citizet sto con
Fent to the abolition ff slavery.
Is not this an effectual bir to reconstruction?
Is uot this a prosecution of the war diiectly for
the consummation of emancipation? Haviug
sacrificed to much of their best blood and under
gone so much finniscial, social and political mis
fortunes, with the prospect before them of yeirs
of rninou4 warfare, the people of the North can
not be blind to the propriety of establishing some
standard of reconciliation that it N possible for
the South to accept.' Yet now we have it distinct
ly proclaimed by the Administration that the only
aveuue to reconstruction leads under the yoke of
abolition. Who shall say that is not the pliant
tool of foiiAtk'irm, that it is in accordance with
our Republican institutions fur one tenth of the
voters of a State to remodel, and iu tact to re
create the laws and Constitution of that State,
especially when it is in the power of the adminis
tration, in the event of military occupation, to
flood such a Sute with the emissaries of its will?
So fir from being elf government, the realiza
tion of such a scheme would be worse than tyran
ny; it would be the !etiyal of the principles
fought for by our fatiPrs, by a mean and treach
erous trick, which would eternalize discord, sus
picion and hatred between the sections. . '. ,. .

A recent editorial article in the Times, en
titled, "Will Rebellion Cease when the Rebel
Armies are Destroyed?" has attracted much at
tention here. I have heard more than a dozen
uiemlnrs of Congress speak of ft, in discussing
the principles it involves. No one doubts that
the above question must be answered in the neg
ative, as long as the present and past policy of
the Administration 11 persisted m. 1 he reason
is plain enough. The Administration has not
mado war against the rebel armies, but against
the people of the Southern States. It is on the
people that all the horrors of war have been
made to fall. It was against them that the
atrocities of Turchin, in Alabama, were directed.
It is against them that the confiscation act was
passed and the emancipation proclamation was
promulgated. It Is against them that such sav
ages as Milroy, and Pope, and Schenck, and
Turchin. and Iligginson, and Montgomerv, and
Jim Lane, have been let loose. The eff ect of
these measures has been to inflict such wsunds in
the breast of the Southern people as time can
never heal, because the perpetrators of these
devilish atrocities were invariably afterwards
honored and promoted by "the government."
I find that it is thought by some members of
Congress.that the Southern people are tired of
the warf lAt-thcy. are exhausted both in men
and mcas; and that, if the olive branch were
now heß out to them, they would eagerly em
brace, it, Alasl such are not my convictions;
and fnf y are founded on more accurate informa
tion tlian that enjoyed by thoce sanguine indi
viduals. There was a time when the simple, but
solemn guarantee of their rights- thor rights as
States and their rights as individuals; rights, too,
guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the
United States there was a time when ihe smple
guarantee of their rights, made to them by the
President and Congress, would have prevented
the war and preserved the Union. This was in
March and April, 1861. There was a time when
these guarantees, offered to them in good faith,
might have stopped the war and restored the
Union. This was in the winter of 18012, be
fore the war bad assumed ita subsequent features,
of ferocity. But this time exists no longer. The
Southern peoplo are uow united as one man.
They believe that the sole object of the war, on
die part of the North, is the conquest and subju
gation of the South, the confiscation of all their
. property, and the reduction of their States to the
condition of conquered territories. They be
lieve that under no circumstances would they be
received into the Union on an equal footing with
the other States; and that the only way for them
to preserve their rights, their liberty and their
. property, is to fight for independence.
: There is one contingency in which we may ex
pect to see the Union restored, and only one. If
the people rise in their might, next fall, the
Republican party will be hurled from power, and
a Democratic President will bo elected probably
General MeClellan. . In - that ease the rebellion
might cease even before the rebel armies are de
stroyed, aad the . restoration of the Union might
be possible.

ation on the Rappahannock since my last letter.

: threw a heavv force across the" Eapidan, and it
was supposed, at first, that the whole of Lee's
array jv a shout to undertake a camoaien azainst
. this citr. . Great excitement prevailed in General
Meade s army; the tents were ell hastily struck;
the baggage trains were all sent to the rear; and
combustibles ' were collected and placed in the
railroad depot, and in and under several hundred
cars, loaded with proTisions. which could not be
, removed, and which, it was feared, might fall in
to the hands of the advancing enemy. The ob
ject of the enemv at that time, however, was
merely to re-establish three of their signal sta
tions, on three hija peaks of tne mountains near
Culpepper, ' which overlook an immense extent
of country. In this they were successful, and
their signal fire? can be" seen burning on those
three peaks every nijrht. It is a grand sight.
From these three teaks they can see far bcrond
the Rappahannock. Our camp are spread out be
fore them like a nap, thev can see. and do see,
all the movement of Gen. Meade. . It was ab
surd, at any rate, to keep the army so far from
ashington as to the line of the Rappahannock,
But, now that every movement of Gen. Meade is
instantly telegraphed to Gen. Lee, the army will
probably be withdrawn to Warrenton, Manassas
Junction, or even to Centreville,' before it goes
into winter qiarters.
Winter quarters! It is a humiliating thought,
now much might bo accomplished by this gal
lant army of veterans between now and spring,
if they were placed under a competent General,
and that General given carte blanche for a cam
. paign against Richmond. With the assistance
of the troops already in Gen. Butler's depart
ment, it would be easy to organize a campaign
against Kichmond which could not fail of sac
cess. We have complete possession of the James
river. The Annv of the Potomac miirht le em
barked on board of transports at Alexandria
and landed at a point above City Point, on tbe
south side of the James river, where thev
would be only . twanty miles from Richmond.
At the same time tho troops under Gen. Butler
could advance fromorfulk and Suffolk against
WeMon, and destroy the railroad leading from
Weldon to Richmond. Such an expedition,
proerly organized, and led by a competent Gen
eral, could not etil of success. But the public
need not anticipate anything of this kind. The
same malign influence that removed General
McClcllan from the armv, and tfmt keeps the
incapable Halletk in his place, will fee to it
that the Army of the Potomac is kept for a foot
ball.
The fact that the President is suffering from a
severe attack of small-pox, that his condition is
critical, and that it must be some days before he
can even leave, tus chamber, will probably pre
' vent the nation from suffering the disgrace of
' 6eeing our Chief Magistrate in a role which might
be pardonable in the Mayor of a little town, but
which would scarcely comport with the dignity
of tho President of the United States. The
Russian fleet is here, and it is understood that
Sumner, WiLso; Lovejoy, Trumbull, Greelev,
. and others of that ilk, had devised a series of
entertainments, which were to take place on
board of tho Admiral's vessel and at the White
House; and at which the great rail-splitter was
to be a principal performer. Tbe object of these
fttf was to have the Tyrant of America concili
, ate and fraternize with" the Tyrant of Russia.
And, if the violence of Mr. Lincoln's disease sub
sides sufficiently, that part of the programme
which was to take place at the White House may
still le carried out. Perhaps it U as well to be
: so: for it may serve to open the eves of the
American people to the real character of the man
i who has usurped powers over them greater than
1 a
tiio.se exerctseu dv any european sovereign ex
cept the Emperor of Russia. . And Abraham is
fast following in the footsteps of Alexander.
You wils remember that when Mr. Cameron was
sent to Europe, I stared that it was done in order
to bring about an alliance with Russia, in order
to enahlo Mr. Lincoln to conquer and subjugate
the Sonth. And it looks very much as if this
was now to ba brought r oout. X.

Special CorreponiU-iice of the Chicago Time.
. Washixotox, December 10.
Yesterday was a dark day for the American
Republic. On that day the great work uion
which the abolitionists have been laboring for
tho last thirty years culminated in the annual
message of a man who bad sworn to support the
constitution of his country, but who in this
message violated his inauguration oath, trampled
the constitution under his feet, and planted his
feet ujKin the rights and liberties of one-half of
the States of the Union. Tor tliirtv years the
abolitionists have been laboring to abolish slave
ry in all the States, even if, in doing so, they
should destroy the Union. To-day they find that
work done for them hv Abraham Lincoln. I
mean the work of the destruction of the Union.
Slavery in the South they can never abolish. It
is an institution ordained and sanctioned by the
Almighty, as thcmost suitable condition for an
inferior race; and what he ordains and sanctions
cannot be moved by all the efforts of puny men.
No one here, who had access to the proper
source of information, was at all surprised at the
radical tone and absurd fcaraje of the message;
and, as I had warned the readers of the Times to
excct the most ultra radical sentiments, and a
full indorsement of the atrocious Whiting and
Sumner, doctrines, in that document, they, tox,
were no doubt prepared for it. Nevertheless, a
thrill of horror ran through the breasts of the
true Representatives of the people, and of the
spectators in the crowded galleries of the House,
as the Clerk read those portentous sentences, in
which the obscure Illinois fiatboatman dared to
assert; ' in the presence of the past glories of the
Republic, the infamous falsehood that the South
ern States existed no longer; and to declare that,
if thev were ever recognized a States again, it
must "be after they shall have pulled down their
venerable State governments, abolished their sa
cred State constitutions, and, in a word, revolu
tion itpH their whole svstem of internal nolicv.
The gallery was warm," but I felt chilled to tfie
I . 1 I 11 t T i
very marrow wuen a was ocara Aonusm Ain
coin declare that ten sovereign S totes, eual and
honored members of the Republic, should never
be allowed to return to the Union, not onlv until
after they shall have torn down the pillars of
their Sute governments, and covered themselves
with the fragments of their former glory, but,
also, not until they shall have acquiesced in, and
approved of, all the illegal, unjust, and uncon
stitutional acts of him, Abraham Lincoln, and
his last infamous Congress! not until after they
shall have bowed down in tho dust, and have
snnghosaanas over the Emancipation Proclama
tion and the Confiscation Act!
Such is, in brief, the pith and substance of the
President's message. .Tlve intelligent readers of
the Times will of course peruse it for themselves.
The nation will never, never stand the monstrous
usurpation which is now boldly proclaimed as
the policy of the present administration. The
President dares to assume that all the people of
all the Southern 8tatca have committed treason,
and are, therefore, objects of Executive clemency.
Does he not know that the people can read? And
docs not the Constitution plainly say that no
person shall bo convicted and be" deemed guilty
of treason except after a fairtrial by jury, in
open court! Besides, does not the Constitution
plainly say that those onlv are guilty of treason
who make war on the Constitutional Govern
ment of tho United States? The verdict of his-
tory will read that Abraham Lincoln himself, and '
bis political advisers, are in tSat category, quite
as much as those who are arrayed in arms. But .
what imprudence it is in him to assume that all
the people in the South are traitors, and to de
clare that they must take a test oath before they
can be allowed to vote or to exercise anv of the
rights of citizenship! No noubt be thinks he is
very smart in, savingthat no man is compelled to
take Iiis oath. Vet Iiis proclamation shows that
he intends, as far as his power extends, that no
citizen of the South shall ever bo allowed even to
vote again, until he has taken this oath. Can ,
anything be more monstrous? Look, for a mo
ment, at the terms of the oath. The owner of a
plantation, whose slaves have been taken from
him by the emancipation proclamation, whose ,
crops have been left rotting in the ground, who
sees poverty and starvation staring him in the
face in consequence' and whose daughter was
one of those young ladies at the seminary at ,
Ainens, in Ai&oama, who were s unjectea to uie
rasts of Turchin's soldiers-this unfortunate cen-
tleman is told that be may vote, and that be shall '
have a full pardon for the above offenses (what .
cruel mockerylj if he will swear that he approves,
aad is in favor of the emancipation proclamation '
aad the negro soldier bill; and, if be refuses so to
swear, be is to be regarded as a traitor, and all'
bU- reraainiifg property is to be confiscated.
Such, your readers will'find, is the plain English .
of the message of Abraham Lincoln, formerly
cook, or assistant cook, for a mess of lour honest :
white soldiers in the Black Hawk war.
But still more impudent is that feature of the
message which assumes to sweep away all the
State governments of all the Southern Slates by .
a tingle stroke of the pen. . This relatcr of vulgar
storbs does not even take the trouble to enter
into any argument to prove that the Southern
States no longer exist as States and of course
have no longer any State governments. Oh, no!
Ho says virtually "That has been so well dmie
by the letter of Mr. Solicitor Whiting of the War
Department, and by Senator Sumner in his At
lantic Monthly article, that we will consider
those points settled. I refer my discontented
fellow-citizens, and my traitorous subjects in Po
land I mean in Alabama to those documcnU.
The old States and the old State governments
being then eo comfortably out of the way, it only
remains to 'get up' a John Brown government, a
Horace Greeley State constitution, and a Wend
ell Phillips and Charles Sumner State organiza
tion in their places. If the citizens of the South
refuse to acquiesce in thi new order of things, I
will confiscate their estates, be.-tow the latter on
my worshipers, and look to the blacks to reor
ganize society at the South."
In all this "there L one grain of comfort. The
present Congress will never sanction any such
doctrines as those contained in this message.
Let the peoplo thank God for that. Let them
take courage in the fact that, in this Congress,
there are enough conservative members to de
feat any measure of legislation founded on these
wicked, unjust and cruel sentiments. At the
earliest opportunity, and at every opportunity,
the Democratic memltcrs of Congress will give
utterance to the voice of the people on these sub
jects, and will expose and denounce the atrocious
features of the . message as they deserve. The
speeches of Reverdy Johnson ami Col. Richard- .
son, in the Sonate, and of Messrs. Voorhees,
Pendleton, Fernando Wood, Cox and Brooks,
in the House, on these topics, may be looked for
with confidence that they will do full justice to it,
and to their constituents who, now, are the
whole body of the people of the nation, except
the shoddvitcs and contractors, and their allies.
X-
The Future.
The message of Mr. Lincoln is important in
this respect that it announces the future policy of
the Administration as wholly opposed to concili
ation and in expectation of 1 cace onlv as the re
sult of total and absolute conqnest. The terms
of peace are to be not only unconditional submis
sion to the Constitution and the laws, but still
worse, an individual oath to "support" the meas
ures of the Administration. Ihe New York
Tribune, with curious effrontery, misrepresents
and conceals from its readers the extent to
wltich the requirtment of tho President goes; that
Eaper says and repents that he requires nothing
ut that the rebels shall "submit to" and "acqui
esce in" the proclamation, which is a very differ
ent thing from the President's words, which de
mand that they shall swear to "support" his
measures.
If wc should applv to this requirement the
treasonable and anti-Ünion language of the Tri
bune and the Abolitionists, we should prolably
bo accused, by these very same persons, of dis
loyalty. The Tribune" has strongly expressed
its" total abhorrence of the plan of "pinning one
part of the Union to another bv bayonets. It is
a curions part of the historv of our times that the
radical; are to constancy m the habit of charg
ing as disloyal the sentiments of which they them
selves have been the most strenuous advocates,
and which they seek to fix on their adversaries so
as to save their own necks.
But laving aside all questions of loyaltv or dis
loyalty, for the people are Mck of the radical liy
jiocrisy which has so abnsed the terms, the ques
tion presented to the honest parriot in examining
tho President's proclamation and message is this:
Does it seem to bo born of a truo and honest de
sire to restore the Uuion? It is only a method
of csiimaiing the true cliaracter of the radical
policv that we suggest this question Would a
trne lover of the old L'nion, or of any union be
tween the Northern and Southern States, a patri
ot sincerely desiring to bring the war to a close
by the achievement of its original object, take
this wav of doing it? Could he rind 110. better!
It i a fair and a most important question. The
President doubtless thinks the plan the best that
he can device wish his peculiar views. Indeed
he says as much. It is then the culmination of
the radical iolicy, and the onlv vi-ible method,
in the view of Mr. Lincoln and his friends, bv
which peace is to be attained. It must be con'i4l
ered the absolute sum total of the wisdom of the
present Administration - the only means which it
can devise for restoring peace to our distracted
country. .
Tbe effect of the adoption of this ultimatum,
bv the Administration, on tho people of the
N'orth must necessarily be to draw a line between
those who think with it that the Union can only
1 restored by a total reduction and submission
of the reikis" and those who think that peace
conld be hastened bv a wise and statesman-like
disposition or conciliation. Mr. Lincoln felici
tates himself on the result of the late elections,
a if the course of the nation on the slavery ques
tion had been decided at them, and that too by
immense and unchangeable majorities. We are
inclined to think he mistakes the fact, while it is
certain that he forgets the enormous expense of
money men, and reputation which it has cost bi
Administration to carry those elections. And if
the question came up, fairly and squarely before
the people,' shall the emancipation proclamation
and the confiscation acts be repudiated, shelved,
erased, if 08sihle forgotten, provided the South
ern people repudiate their secession acts and re
turn to their duty a citizens and suhjeet, we
say if this question came before the people of the
North, the immense majority of them would vote
Ave with a shout. AVe think this fact Mr. Lin
coln leaves out of his account.
S. The prospect seems to be that the Presidential
election will afford an opportunity for testing
bow far this is the feeling nf the people. The
policy of the Administration has been to make
war on the rebels by making war on their pet in
stitution. The result, according to our idea, has
been that the war has copt five time as much as it
ought, and has been indefinitly prolonged by the
mistake. We havo wasted our time and money
in strengthening the enemy and binding his loose
forces more and more closely together. . Now we
have tho rest of the policy laid oat. No end of
tbe ' war except by the total abolition of rlaverv,
and that policy is to Ikj submitted to the people
for approval. , Will thev sustainit by continuing
it for years longer! The messago of the Presi
dent is intended to submit this question. It i tho '.
last message, in the ordinary course, before the
Presidential election, and it i tolerably certain
that it secures Mr. Lincoln a renomination. N.

which -impel men to stand by each other in !

could hardly wuh them to be an ung caerou and .
cowardly race, for, although they evidently in
tend to close the doors ' of our political house,,
they must have some recollection of the relations '
that once existed and some respect for tbe asto- '
clarions of the pat. Now, let the North, in sup
position, and without reference to the right or
the wrong, exchange positions with the South, $0
far as concerns tbe danger of incurring tbe pen-
ally of treason. While any means of resistance . :
remained, while there was a crust of bread to
sustain life, an arm with strength enough to
wield a weapon and a weapon to be wielded,
would any Northerner that esteems himself an
honorable man accept an amnesty whose provi
sions would consign to the scaffold bis compan- .
ion in arms, the chieftain who had shared with
him the fortunes of the field, his brother-soldier, '
his brother, his father icrhaps, and the public
officers whom his suffrage had elevated to the po
sition that exempted them from pardon? Yet, in
accepting the terms of the amnesty, the South
ern people would sign the death" warrants of -all
their rield officers of their commanders, tome t
of whom thev aevere and love w ith an intmu
devotion of their officials, whom they desired
to accept the post of danger and responsibility,
and, in many cases,' of their kindred and bosom
friends. If Stonewall Jackson lived, what man

tled plain, of those whom he had cheered in the
hospital and cared for with nnwearving solici- :
tude amid the vicissitudes of war; of those whom
be prayed for while they slept upon the eve of
battle, and who was to them a hero and an idol
what man of them, except some mercenarv
craven that would sell bis soul to purchase his
body's safety, would accept a pardon whose price
was that leader's blood Does any Northern
citizen, with heart and human instincts, believe
that the Confederate army in Virginia would
surrender Robert Lee to the gallows, to pay with
his life, devoted to their cause, the ransom of
their own existence? Mr. Lincoln must have
forgotten that he dealt with the descendants of
men who fought for Independence with halters
about their necks, and fonght none the less un
flicnhingly. If the Americans who unmur- ..
muring endured hunger and ccld amid the :
snows of Valley Forge, had in their dark hour .
betrayed Washington to the mercies of King '
George, then might we have supposed that
Americans of this day would seal their bond of
safety with the blood of their eemrades and com
manders. Whether their cause be good or bad,
whether they be patriots or traitors, whether they
are strong in hope or feeble with despondency,
they have at least in their veins the same un
treacherous blood that ennobles the people of the
North together they resolved to tread the burn
in plowshare, together they will pass the ordeaL
We do not think that Mr. Lincoln's estimate
of his countrymen is so low, nor that such base
misgivings pervaded bis brain, that he issued !
that amnesty with a hope of its acceptance. He '
desired to ordain by proclamation either disunion .1
or the extinction of slavery, and theamnestv was ,
his pretext. In that, he succeeded.' The North "
cannot now fail to understand that nnder the
present Administration the Union cannot be re
stored except upon the condition of abolition.
"War Democracy" has not even a phantom light
to guide it.. There can be but two political part
ies: that which supports the Administration sup- -ports
a war for disunion; that which opposes tbe
Administration opposes the war.
