HISTORY OF EVENTS OF FIVE
Five years of iijrmed conflict In
Ireland between the,'forces of the Brit

conference in London, negotiations for
A peace were undertaken by Premier
Lloyd George, representing the Brit

Ulster premier and Eamonn ,_de

The term Sinn Fein, which, in the
Gaelic, literally means "ourselves, ,f

Hopes Blasted,
promise that the Home Rule bill
would be put into effect when the
world war was ended.
This was not to be. Some of the
Irish leaders saw in Germany a lib
erator for Ireland and Germany saw
in Ireland's disaffection an opportuni
ty to weaken Great Britain's war ef
forts. The upshot was the landing of
Sir Roger Casement in Ireland from
a German submarine, the sinking oft'
the Irish coast of a ship loaded with
German ammunition simultaneously
with the outbreak of the "Easter Re
bellion" in Dublin In April 25. 1916
The British had learned of the pla«i
and Casement was arrested and sub

Fought for years by conservatism in

Martial law was declared in the city
which was overrun with troops.
Eventually many Sinn Feiners sur
rendered and hundreds were captured
by the crown forces. Altogether, as a
result of the revolt 14 Sinn Fein lead
ers including President Pearse were
executed, 79 -were sent to prison and
1,706 were'deported.
Subsequently Eamonn de Valera
succeeded Pearse as president of the
Irish republic. Ireland was heavily
garrisoned with British troops for the
remainder of the war.
A notable effort to compose the dif
ferences between Great Britain and
Ireland occurred in the summer of
1917 when the famous Dublin conven
tion was held under the chairmanship
of Sir Horace Plunkett. Although the
convention failed fully to attain its
purpose of formulating a plan of
peace, it did reach what Sir Horace
Plunkett called the "basis of an agree
ment" 'that Ireland should have a par
liament of its own but' Ulster again
blocked the way to peace. It would
pot consent to be ruled by a parlia

One of the notable events In this
bitter campaign of attack and repi isal
was the death by hunger strike of
Lord Mayor Terence MacSwlney. He
had been arretted on a charge or sedi

twb years. While he and other Sinn
Feiners were in the Cork Jail they
went on a hunger strike and Mac
Swiney died after 73 days of absten

hunger strikers who survived were re
leased.
The new government of Ireland act
was passed by the British house ot
commons in December, 1920. It pro
vided for a northern and southern
parliament and for a central parlia

both the north and the south. De

Ulster accepted the act and proceed

It was the king's speech that start

General Jan Christian Smuts, the pre

General Smuts stated that the Irish
question was "a soluble problem" and
bore a resemblance to conditions in
South Africa which were now happily
removed.
A few days-after King George's Im
portunate appeal tp all Irishmen to
settle their differences, de Valera re
ceived an invitation from Premier
Lloyd George to confer with Sir James
Craig, the Ulster premier, and himself
with a view to reaching a satisfactory

Europearf currencies are nearing a
stage at which it will be impossible
to use them' as media of exchanged
There is no well-defined line at the
crossing of which a currency becomes
worthless, but evidently it cannot con
tinue to depreciate without reaching
in time the point where the public
will refuse to give anything for it.
In Russia, the old unit, the rou
ble, formerly worth about 51 cents,
now has a vafhe so small that the old
denominations have long since passed
entirely out of use. Even a thousand
rouble note of the new issues will not
buy anything. As the depreciation
has progressed the denominatianr
have risen, 10.000, 50,000 and 100,
000 rouble notes becoming the com
mon change in use.
The Polish mark, nominally worth
H.8 cents in money of the United:
States, is quoted at .Of of a cent the
Austrian crown, formerly 20 cents, is
only slightly higher the crown ot
Jugo-Slavia, which corresponds to the
Austrian unit,.is worth a little more,
about .36 of a cent the crown of
Hungary, of the same crown family, iw
worth about one-tenth of a cent, and
the lei of Roumanla, formerly 19.3
cents, is worth .76 of a cent. These
currencies are very near extinction,
and live on only because .there is
nothing to take their places. It is
difficult to sfee how business can be
canried on with tllem, 'and particu
larly how any ^agreements for future
performance can be entered into in
terms of them.
Currency Situation in Germany.
Consider, for example, the situation
in Germany, where six- months ago
the mark was worth 1 1-2 cents, and
even three months ago was worth
more than a cent, against a present
value of about 35 hundredths of a
cent.
It is true that the mark has not
declined as rapidly in purchasing pow
er within Germany as in the foreign
exchanges. The relationship between
internal prices and foreign, exchange 1
is indirect, but it is close enough to
cause a steady decline in the value of
the currency for internal use, result
ing in strikes and wage-advances con
stantly. The most effective influence
for bringing the internal value of the
mark into line with its value in the
exchanges is the cost of food. Ger
many is obliged to import grain
meats, cotton, wool and other neces
saries entering into common con
sumption, and these imports must be
paid for at the current rates of ex
change. Since trade in these com
modities is now free, the portions im
ported fix the prices for the home
grown supplies, as well, and the de
preciation of the mark is soon re
flected in the cost of living.

but with the trade balance heavily in
our favor this steadying influence was
not in effect.
It has been charged that the Feder
al Reserve authorities and other
bankets set out deliberately to deflate
prices, but this is not the case. They
set out to check the alarming increase
of bank loans and to hold the volume
of reserve bank liabilities within the
limit fixed by the law.
In the fall of 1919 the country was
at the parting of the ways. The re
serves of the Federal Reserve banks
-wefe down practically to the limit set
by the Federal Reserve Act—a limit
fixed With carefuPand unbiased Judge
ment when the act was passed before
the war. The Federal Reserve Act
provides th^t the reserve'' require
ments may be renewed for periods hot
exceeding fifteen days, but thede are
clearly emergency provisions. More
over, the law provides that a grad
uated tax shall be levied upon the
amount by which these reserves fall
below the regular limit, and also that
the rate of the tak shall be added to
the regular discount rates while the
deficiency continues. .These provisions
cleaVly show the purpose and spirit
of the law.
The banking situation at the close
Ot 1919 had practically reached'- the
position where the law required these
provisions to become effective, and thd
steps gradually taken by the Federal
Reserve banks to increase discount
rates were for that purpose. There
waM jio sudden rfop in the increase
of loans in fact the aggregate con
tinued to grow Until the fall of 1920.
Moreover, the record shows that the
prevailing impression that the reserve
banks have discriminated' against the
agricultural sections is not borne out
by-the-record. An analysis or reports
from about 9,500 member banks
throughout the country lias been,
made by the Federal Reserve Board,

DISCOVERY MAY
MAKE BIG CHANGE
IN THE MOVIES
Urbana, HI., Dec 7.—Will the mov-
in£
picti^e industiV receive a
tionary addition through a scientific
discovery made' at the University of
Illinois, basic patents for which are
held by that institution?
"It seems possible that this dis
covery will make the movies of tfte
future talk, so that there will no
longer be the 'silent dramaV says an
official announcement, issued today at
the university.
The announcement continues: "The
scientific discovery iR that of an ex
tremely sensitive and reliable 'photo
electric' cell, made about two years
ago in the physical laboratories of the
university by Professor Jakob Kunz.
The incident, is'a good example of the
unexpectedness by which some great
discovery may be made years in ad
vance before it can be practically
used.
"The photo^fcetric cfellfis-a device
fhr turning flashes of light into elec
tric pulses and is so sensitive tH^t-it
reacts to light from stars' which' can
not be seen with the naked eye. Be
cause of this extreme sensitiveness the
photo-electric --cell promises to dis
place the selenium cell which has been
used up to the present .time in experi
ments carried op to produce speech
to accompanying moving pictures.
"A Swedish scientist has developed
a device which he calls the 'photo
phone' by which such speech is more
or less perfectly produced. This is
done by having a second film on the
Same spindle as the moving picture
'film, on which are photographed vari
ous curves and openings correspond

company the pictures. A beam of
light sent through this film falls upon
a selenium cell. The selenium cell
depends upon a discovery made many
years ago that the metal selenium
changes its electric resistance when
light falls upon it. it is thus possible
to get variations in an electric current
by letting the beam of light from a
speech photograph film falj upon such
a cell. These variations act in a tele
phone to reproduce speech.
Much More Sensitive.
"The selenium cell is much inferior
to Dr. Kunz photo-electric cell in
