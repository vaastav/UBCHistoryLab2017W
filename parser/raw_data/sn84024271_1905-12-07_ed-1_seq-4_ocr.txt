Cotton picking machines are invented
and their merits tested liefere an ad

The United States during 1904 pro
dueed $80,805,648 in gold and $32,035,
387 in silver, and the chances are that
both productions will be largely in
creased during this year, 1905. And
yet everybody is on the limit for more.

<)pponents of regulation of freight be

with the right« of appeal, cannot do
right.
The State Exposition, which closed at

d. P. Morgan posed for years as king
of finance of the American continent,
until Eugene Zimmerman entered the
game for supremacy, when Morgan dis
covered that Zimmerman c

Morgan is now taking some large size
doses of the medicine he for years forced
down others.

After Senator Elkins found that lie was

President, he is said to have gone over
the majority side. Senator Eoraker
took the railroad side in the Ohio State
canvass, as did the Governor of that
State, Herrick, and the Democrats took
tlic position for rate legislation, along
with Roosevelt. The consequence was
that the Republican majority of 2.">0,000

HOW PEACE iS BROUGHT.
Nearly evdry country with an army
and navy is "spoiling for a fight" till it
gets one. Then it learns a lesson and
takes repose till the younger generation
comes on, verdant and rejecting the ex
perienee of those who are older, and pro
eeods t
draw blood.
We say prayers
and sing hymns and psalms and rejoice
over the repentance of mankind when
comes. But that
through no spirit of religion or mortal
ity, and is not at heart a promotion of
Christianity or any system of moral
teaching. Peace comes partly because
