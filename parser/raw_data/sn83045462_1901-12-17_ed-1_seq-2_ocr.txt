NOTHING DEVELOPS
Police Unable to Fathom the Dennis
Assault Mystery.
L, CLUE8 PROVE TO BE AI
Condition of the Patient Believed
to Be Slightly Wofse.
IS STILL UNCONSCIOUS
"Bad news.* *as what one of the attend
ing physicians said this morning when he
came from the room of Mrs. Ada Gilbert
Dennis at the Garfield Hospital. Mrs. Den
nis had spent a quiet night and had done
less muttering and given the nurses less
trouble than during ang previous night.
Heretofore she has been quite restless at
times, and frequently during each night
Nhe endeavored to tear the bandages from
her head.
The doctors would not may today that the
condition of the patient is alarming, but
they did say her condition Is less favorable
than it was yesterday. A slight operation
Was performed yesterday in order to re
move the pus from one of her eyes. Both
eyes are still terribly swollen and the pa
tient has not yet been able to open them.
The doctors did not remain at her bedside
Very long today, but they will see her
again late in the afternoon.
So far as the detectives are concerned
they seem to be as much at sea as they
have been at any time since the assault
Was committed a week ago. All day yes
terday and last night they were engaged In
investigating incidents connected with the
Suicide of Samuel C. Presley. This line of
investigation was renewed this morning,
and while the representatives of the police
department have found several alleged sus
Plclous incidents, they have actually
learned nothing which will connect Presley
With the assault. His conversation in a
cigar store last Saturday, as reported to
the police, Indicated a belief on his part
that he was being "shadowed" by the po
lice on account of the affair.
"I know who assaulted her," he is re
rrted to have said, and he lives in my
ouse."
Presley then proceeded to describe the
Inan to whom he referred, and, It Is stated,
the description was a good one of himself.
No one has been found who can show that
Vresley was away from his room about
the time the murderous assault was com
mitted in the house adjoining the one in
which he boarded.
Clothing Cader Examination.
The garments, including overcoat, sack
coat and trousers, and a pair of shoes,
taken from Presley's room, as published
in yesterday's Star, are still in the custody
of Prof. Hird, who is examining for blood
spots. The two small stains on the left
sleeve of the overcoat proved to be blood,
It is stated, but those on the shoe were
rust stains. A report on the other gar
ments will be made later.
Mr. Lewis Stevenson, who lives in the
neighborhood of the Dennis house, viewed
the body of the dead man this afternoon,
and informed Precinct Detective Evans
that he answered to the description of a
man whom he saw on K street about 5
o'clock the morning Mrs. Dennis was as
saulted. Mr. Stevenson was on his way to
work at the .Ime, walking west on K
Street. and the other party was going east
on the same street. The latter was wear
ing a light overcoat and black slouch hat,
and Mr. Stevenson declares that when .he
man under his observation saw him he left
the sidewalk and went to the street.
Mr. Stevenson says the man he saw on
the street was in appearance very much
like Mr. Presley.
Detective Browne, who investigated Pres
ley's movements, Is satisfied that the lat
ter had no connection with the Dennis case.
Presley had, he said, lost f170 that a woman
had given l4t to invest in stoeks, and got
to drinking, and the suicide followed. This
the detective believes is the true reason for
Presley's rash act.
About Presley.
Hugh Watson, a former newspaper pub
lisher in -Louisiana, who Is now a clerk in
the Treasury Department, has made a
statement to the police officials regarding
Presley. He called on him, he said, the
night before the assault on Mrs. Dennis,
remaining only a few minutes. Presley, he
said, was in a very jolly mood, dancing
about the floor and telling him he was
going to call on a lady who had $10,000
and who was going to put up money for
him to Invest in stocks. The lady, Presley
told Watson, was desperately in love with
him.
This afternoon Henry Presley, brother of
the man who committed suicide, called at
headquarters with Attorney Scaggs. He
had been told that an inquest was to be
held and he intended to defend his brother
against an attack upon his reputation. He
believed i19 his brother's innocence, and
said the latter had never been arrested in
his life.
The detectives are satisfied that Mrs.
Dennis was not one of the two women who
called at a house on K street Monday
night, an account of which was published
in The Star yesterday.
Acting Coroner Giasebrook has given a
certificate of death from asphyxiation,
showing that Presley committed suicide.
is body will be taken to Many, Sabne
parish, La.. tomorrow morning.
This afternoon at the hospital it was -stat
ed that there had been no change In the

The question of the doom of gr s t
the established thoro1 S fth DW
trict of Columbia Is one t 11111 to
receive attention from Osagrim The
changing of the grade of N1arl 11ee a
Cleveland Park has eaused t matte to
be discussed. and the question Us Seen
raised whether there should be defted-anA
declared some definite policy relating to
he .-ha=ging of grades In the tutare on
any thoroughfare.
Messrs, James Sharp and E. S. Wescott
have written to Mr. MeMillan. cbatftan
of the Senate committee on the District
of Columbia, protesting aInst ny radi
cal change of the grade in Cleveland Park.
Mr. Sharp sats in many Instances people
bought homes In Cleveland Park because
of the grades established there, which
were in accordance with a pla* for the
preservation of the natural beauties of
that section, and they desired to avoid the
system of having level grades with all the
hills cut down and the valleys filled up.
he ProtestS against a radical cutting
down of these grades, which, he says, wal
result in the cutting down of roes and
the practicale aging of the entire out
lines of the on.
'"There are adjacent to most of our large
cities," Mr. lhWrV says, "subuwban see
tions which do iot partake of the distinct
ly city aspeat. whet bouses are detached
and are surrounded with more or less land;
but when the trees have been destroyed
and the land has been leveled, when the
additional expense which yMust come from
such a course has been added to the actual
price of the land, there Is no incentive for
people to build detached homes or to re
side in a suburb of that character."
While the people of Cleveland Park, he
said, wanted a street macadamized, they
did not want a change of the grade of the
street.
Mr. Wescott says the- cutting of the
grade according to the contemplated plan
would be about six feet below the old
grade of Newark street. although his ter
race is now eleven feet high, and .he hopes
to have the cutting now made refilled and
an injunction placed upon further cutting.

ROSEBM 'HAS' HIS SAY
ma~w uvauEN ER.E
Nkas.,ee nt M Allerated Eingntda
- FrIek Al Ite* EU -D
eusw aber War,
A dispatdh fran Rmed, Megiand,
last night sam herd embes7s lang-s&
pected and mihaeralded speech,'delivered
her. tonight, ws received with nrked on
thuala== by an Immense rowd. .It oh
barMy be said to tave threWn much -Mght
along the pathway of the liberal party.
That the speech was a finished oratorical
eflort was amply testified by the frequeat
aplause with *hich the "aenr war I&
terrupted. Bist it is doubtful, when he bad
Unished. if bia Mbost admi-ing listener oouM
have given any justification for this ei
thuslasm, save that it was-Lord Roesbery.
Resolved into its elegents. the speech mere
ly said: "Get together." The speaker him
self confessed that he did not pret'end th
say how this cohesion should be accom
piished. In urging his fellow liberals to re
organize, Lod Rosebery iupted the follow
ing words from the message of President
Roosevelt: "We hope to keep going by slow
steps, not by bounds. We must keep our
eyes on the stars, but we must also re
-member that our feet are on the ground."
The following was the tenor of the former
prenuer's speech:
The ministry was wrong, but the liberals
shou.d be very careful how they tried to
set It right.
Turning from the Immediate outbreak of
the war. Lord Rosebery touched upon edu
cation, in which, he said,'Great Britain was
woefully behind her sister nations. Her
commercial development was glso sadly
atrophied, and the time would soon come
when Britain would be forced to fight for
trade supremacy. She would then be as
helpless as though armed with bows and
arrows.
Lord Rosebery maintained - a discreet
vagueness on the question of h:x personal
Inclinations concerning the leadership of
the liberal party. He said that he could
not imagine himself in the position of a
minister. But In the next breadth he told
how he wouid reorganize the war office if
It fell to h-s lot. He said this reorganiza
tion, however, should be postponed until
after the war. The speaker's recipe for. the
proposed reorganization of this office was a
characteristically American one, namely,
the appointment of a commission.
Concerning the government's conduct of
the war, Lord Rosebery was severe and
scornful. The compiaint of the government
that the Boers had not made war according
to the recognised rules reminded him that
the same thing had been sa:d by the old
Austrian generals of the young Napoleon,
when the latter was beating them. He was
particularly sarcastic at the expense of the
explanation of the Earl of Ha.sbury, the
lord chancellor, that only a "sort of war
fare" was now going on, and he strongly
condemned what he termed the scandalous
misrepresentations by which the govern
ment had precipitated the last general elec
tion.
Lord Rosebery heavily blamed the gov
ernment for its tactlessness, which he de
clared had produced unparalleled ill widl to
ward Great Britain :n every European
population, and which he attributed largely
to what he called the provocative oratory
of Mr. Chamberlain, the colonial secre
tary.
While he was emphatic on the necessity
of vigorously prosecuting the war and el
pressing the fullest confidence In Lord
Kitchener, Lord Rosebery said that he
thought the government should be pre
pared to listen to peace overtures, and he
contended there was notLuing tegrading or
abusing in recognizing the exiLed Boer gov
ernment for the purpose of making peace.
The three greatest civilians who had waged
war in the past century, the speaker said
Pitt, Birmarck and Lincoln-had not dis
dained such efforts to secure peace, and
Lord Rosebery recounted the occasions of
1796, 1870 and 1865. No sane Boer now
hoped for anything but annexation, he said,
and for many reasons It was urgent that
the war should be ended. 'The Boers should
not be unnecessarily humiliated. The
former premier protested emphatically
against treating the Boers in the field as
bandit.ti. To Boers swearing allegiance, he
said, he would give the largest possible am
nesty and the fullest civil rights. The 40.
000 prisoners must be resettled in South
Africa, and harsh treatment of the Boers
would be like applying sparks to gunpow
der.
Scornfully rejecting the iuea that such
an empire as Brita.n could not provide an
alternative government to the existing min
istry, Lord Rosebery said that in all his
life, from all the bitterest foes of Great
Britain, he never had heard such disparage
ment of her as that doctrine implied. If
that were true, he continued, the nation
was more fitted to control a cabbage gar
den than an empire.
In conclusion and amid loud cheers Lord
Rosebery declared his services were at the
disposal of the country in anything he
could do to further the policy he had just
expounded. He said It was not to party
that he appealed; party In -this matter could
avail little or nothing. He appealed unto
Caesar from the parliament, with its half
hearted but overwhelming government sup
porters, and from distracted and disunited
opposition, to that silent but supreme tri
bunal which, in the long run, shaped and
controlled the destinies of the British peo
ple, namely, the tribunal of public opin
ion and common sense.
Lord Rosebery spoke - for almost two
hours, and was received throughout with
the greatest enthusiasm. He afterward ad
dressed an overflow meeting of 12.000 peo
ple in another hail. Here he spoke but
briefly, as he was very hoarse.
GEN. MILES ON SCHLEY VERDICT.
Head of the Army Accepts the Judg
ment of the Navy's Head.
A dispatch to the New Yor-k Herald from
Cincinnati, Ohio, yesterday, says: General
Nelson A. Miles, commanding the army,
arrived here today, accompanied by Mrs.
Miles. They are guests of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Wlborg, in Clifton, Mrs. Wlborg be
ing a relative of Mrs. Miles. In speaking
of the finding of the Schley court of in
quiry, General Miles said:
"I am willing to take the judgment of
Admiral Dewey In the matter. He has been
a commander of a fleet, and as such has
known the anxieties and responsibilities
which rest on a man under these circum
stances. He was instrumental in the de
structIon of one Spanish fleet, and knows
and realizes the feelings that encompass
an officer under such conditions.
"I think Dewey has summed up the
matter in a clear and concise manner, and
I believe his conclusions will be indorsed
by the patriotic people of the United States.
I have no sympathy with the efforts which
have been made to destroy the honor of an
officer under such clrcumstances."

COXS 'DEATH AN ACCIDENT.,
Coronee's Jury Exonerates the Ele
Vator Conductor.
Deputy &rdner Glazebrook held an in
quest at Soldiers' Home today for the pur
pose of. rnaking inquiry into the death of
Charles Cox, an old soldier, and an inmate
of the home, who was found beneath the
elevator in the King building at the home
Sunday ttxfeiion with injurdes about his
head. He was removed to Barnes Hospital,
on the hoine giounds, but died almost im
mediately thereafter.
The coroner's jury was composed of the
following: Dr. Jamnes E. Gessford, Messrs.
Harry Moran, sr.; Watry Moran, Jr.; Frank
E. Kirby, William G. Elmer and Theodore
Hiser.
The verdict rendered was. that the said
Charles- Cox came- to his death about I
p.m. Sunday, December 15, 1901, at the
King building, United States Soldiers'
Home; that his death was due to concus
sion of the brain, the said injury being
:aused by the said man falling against the
3oncrete floor in the elevator room.
"We find further the man's death was
iccidental, but that his body was found in
.he said elivator room, which was sup
posed to bp a private room, and further
that the elevator man was Intoxicated at
he time. We, therefore, recommend that
;pecific rules be, 4naugurated relative to
,he management of this elevator."
In the testimony the deceased was shown
to have been Imbibing, and that he had
just left the hospital' and was In a feeble
,ondition. He and Leech, the elevator man,
bad been together the morning of Sunday,
December 15, but Leech, the elevator man,
:ould not ftmember whether they drank
together or not. Both, be admitted, had
bad drinks, but not in the room.
Leech .stated that Cox remained in his
room froti abant 10 o'clock until 10:80 that
morning and 'Wad then left. He did not
see the Xceased again. At this time Leech
stated that Cox could stand, but staggered
in walking. m,
Leech supposed Cox had entered his room
while he had been absent from it for about
:en minutes, and on returning had answer
'd a call, Frofn that time the elevator did
iot oome down to the basement floor.
It is supposes that the dead man struck
his head against an obstruction, and, fall
Ing to the floert received the injury, and
that in his wehk condition it had proved
fatal.
Leech was dismissed, following the jury's
verdict, from custody.

to' takaeimmediate steps to suppress the
alarming reports that have been spread
over the.suburb of Takoma during the past
few days as to prevalence of contagious
diseases in the public school there. The
health office has been informed that three
cases of scarlet fever have recently occur

Two of these cases occurred in one grade
