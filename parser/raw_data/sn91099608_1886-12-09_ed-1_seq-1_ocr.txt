Ttie legislatare of the territory of Da
kota will oonvene oc the 13th of
January.
There are hopes that a government
land offioe will be established at James
town before the winter grows warm,
The inoomiDg legislatare will be
asked to "appropriato" for an experi
mental agrionltnral farm. A long felt
want.
The Bio ax Falls Argus would be
happy with either Day or Ohuroh for
governor, but leans over towards the
former because the latter is a resident
of Dakota for revenue ouly.
The estimate for river and harbor
appropriations for the ooming year
aggregate $30,201,744, of which $1,150,
000 is set apart for the survey of the
Missouri river from its mouth to the
first territorial boundary line.
Persons visiting Huron to attend next
week's legislative and constitutional
gatherings are adyised that exoursion
rates oan be secured over railroads by
mentioning destination and objeot of
trip to station agents. This anooance
meut is made upon authority of the
citizens' committee of Huron.
This is a good year to belong to the
California legislature. The millionaires
are in the raoe for the United States
senatorship and most of them possess
more money than brains. As they are
ready to give from their greatest sur
plus the situation is of intense interest
to the man with'a vote to oast. ..
The Ii9toher Blade is of the opinion
that the shortest route to north Dakota,
via-the valley of the Jim, will not deter
legislators for going aroaod by St. Panl
on free passes and ooileoting tnileage
by that route. We have abetter opinion
of legislative honesty than that. The
St. Panl sieve will oatoh those only who
want to be interviewed.
It is the opinion of the Devil's Lake
Inter-Ooean that northern legislative
representatives will not be solid for E.
A. Williams for speaker of the house
and that h« will have few followers from
central Dakota and none from the
south.
The Inter-Ooean says the old capital
commission crowd wants Williams for
speaker and blick Aleck for president of
the oounoil, a very good reoBon why
they should not be chosen.
There is a newspaper op north, we
have forgotten itn local habitation and
name, which tearfully requests that
those members of the state legislature
who are also members of the territorial
legislatnre and who are present at next
week's meeting of the state legislature
be tried for treason and hong at the
yard's arm. Whether it ia for being a
member of the territorial legislatare or
of the state legislatare the prayer of the
petitioner does not specify.
A oiroular from Agastine Davis, presi
dent of the Dakota press association,
oontains an invitation to attend a reoep
tion by the oitizens of Haron, to be
given in Huron daring the legislative
and constitutional gathering next week.,
This reception takes ic representatives
of the press, members of the constitu
tional convention and legislature,
United States senators and state officers,
and preparations have been made to
accommodate a thousand people- This
will be the social side of the affair.
The Letcher Blade is in-favpr of doing
something at the Haron gathering of
next week. It says:
Aotive inflaenoes are at work to seoore
the admission of the whole territory as
one state, or at least to defeat division
and the admissioa of the south half.
The administration and the national
democracy are in sympathy with this
idea and the dirisionists oannot be too
prompt or too aotive in their counter
efforts. The constitutional convention
,and its agencies would seem,to be the
most natural and effioieqt machinery
with whioh to accomplish this purpose.
The question is, how will they do it
The south gives strong symptoms of
combining upon two southern members
for president of the legislative oounoil
and speaker of the house. It is remem
bered that in the republican oonvention
the soatb exeoated 2he graceful aot of
oonoiliation and good will io giving to
-the defeated north the chairmanship of
the territorial oommittee and the man
agement of the congressional osmp&ign
and that in return eighteen thousand
northern republicans voted the demo
cratic tioket. The sooth therefore in
olines toward a selfish use of iis nu
merical strength in the legislative body,
On Tuesday l&st Delegate "Clifford
Introdooed a bill giving national
permission for the construction oi

The president's message is produoing
a sectional division at Washington. As
a correspondent puts it:
The east is satisfied on the recom
mendation effeoting Soasoes and oon
deqin those upon the tariff, while in the
west it is the reverse of the order.. It
is strange bat trae that soaroely a demo
crat or republican oan be found but
who will point out some serious obieo
tion in the message. This is explained
by the democrats who say there is a
division in the party on the two issues,
tariff and finances, while there are other
obstinate contentions in the party over
civil servioe reform.
Congressman Watson, of Indians,
ohairman of the pensions committee,
announces in an interview that in the
light of the president's message tariff
reform is much more argent than pen
sion legislation. Pablic opinion takes
no new stand in Washington. The
friends of the president eommend the
message and those not his friends oon
demn it. No political line is drawn .be
tween favor and disfavor. '"M
THE MESSAGE.
Comments ot the A'ew Yorli Press
Upon the Presidential Document.
New York, Deo. 7—At the end ot a
long.review of the president's message
the Times says: *'Ofi the whole the mes
sage is one to whioh hardly an exqept
tion can fairly be taken, being unpreten
tious, patriotic, straightforward and
business like."
The World says: "Hound as most of
the president's suggestions are, it is to be
regretted that his making of them is
likely to have so little effeot upon oon
gress. When Speaker Carlisle can say
that he was not consulted in regard to
the message and knew nothing whatever
in advanoe concerning its recommen
dations and similar ignoranoe was felt
by other demooratio leaders in congress,
the same unfortunate state of affairs
that prevented aotion at the
laBt session is seen to 'be
still extant. It is unfortunate that
President Cleveland has not seen fit
to plaoe himself in confidential and
mutually belpfal relations with the
leaders of bis party in congress or with
other exponents of demooratio sentiment.
It is only by the active oo-operation of its
loadors that party gorsrnsaeat ssa ija
made suooesBfol. And when the presi
dent does not seek, but rather repels,
sooh cfo-operation, there is little hope of
harmonious aotioo by the two depart
ments of the government.. To drop
perfunctorily personal messages on the
desks of members, us newspapers might
be laid there, Is mi the manner in
which early presidents i. cognized the
leadership ot the pun\ il their re
sponsibilities for the pruuiiuiou of its
prinoiplee."
The Tribune says: "In troth it is not
precisely a great message, nor does it
sbed muoh light on events. Bat, in the
main, it fairly sets forth the opinions
aud illustrates the qualifications of the
party which eleoted Mr. Cleveland for
president."
It is difficult to say what the Sun
thinks of the message, as the following
is the nearest approach to an opinion
expressed: "In method and Bpirit, and
especially in itB careful study of depart
ment reports, on whioh it is largely
based, Mr. Cleveland's seoond general
message resembles the one sent to con
gress a year ago."
The Herald says: '"It is a good mes
sage clear, plain, not too long, and "the
faots it sets forth are suoh as may make
every Amerioan justly proud of bis
oountry and happy that he belongs to it.
If the gentlemen in oocgress will agree
together to oarry oat Cleveland'fi
recommendations and suggestions they
will do themselves oredit and will stand
better with their constituents and this
ooantry than many of them dp now."
