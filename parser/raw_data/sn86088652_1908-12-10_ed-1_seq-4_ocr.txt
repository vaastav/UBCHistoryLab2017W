IT is no longer necessary
for the man who is a bit
particular about shirts to
pay custom prices when he
can get what he wants in a
ready-made garment.
The exact science to which
shirt draughting has been
brought, the employment
of the best designers, and
the expert knowledge
applied to the selection of
dyes, has resulted in a shi
that is not excelled.
The CLUETT
marks it.

It will be remembered that during
the late campaign the Republicans
promised tariff reform after the elec

totally Ignores this promise.
What's the use to discuss at this

Since the Kaiser found out he isn't

Is said that he has aged perceptibly.
Let us hope that he hus Increased in

The Hotel Men's Association of

Governor Campbell has nn erroneous
Idea of what the people expect of a
governor If he thinks he imiHt spend
$10,000 a year to maintain the dignity
of the office. Possibly his mistake Is
In supposing that a political machine
Is a necessary adjunct. It does cost
money to build and operate a thing
of that kind and thp ja-ople have to
pay it in one way or another.
The Peerless wanted some Texas land
And he got It down on the Rio Grande
Among the cactus and chapparral
He will cleor a spnee for a cattle corral
In the fertile boII some holes he'll dig
And plant the pecan, orange, and fig
In hope that during the years to corns
It may offer a welcome winter home
Where, when weary with cares of stute
And buffeted by adverse winds or rate,
He'll find sweet rest and take his ense
'Neath the shade of his own semi
tropic trees.
Speaking of the hoy whose leg was
dislocated by the kick of an elephant,
the Galveston News says:
"That Hcaumont boy will have
something to brag about to his fu
ture grandchildren. There ure pre
cious few kids In these United
Stntcs who have been kicked by
an elephant, and If the Heauinout
Journal lets the public forget the
distinction that accrues to Its town
by reason of Its being the domi
cile of the hoy It Is not the paper
It appears to be."
When a hoy at Knoxvllle, Tenn
the writer was permitted by the Hon
keeper of VnnAmburg's menagerie to
hold a Hon cub in his hands and put
his finger in its month. He has often
boasted of this to his children am
others.

The readers of The Kngle are well
aware that we have no partiality for
Mr. Roosevelt, but when the charge
was made, unsupported at the time
by evidence, that with the knowledge
and consent of the president a syndl
cnte Including his brother-in-law and
a brother of President-elect Taft. hm:
swindled the government out of $L'8
000,000 In the Panama canal deal, we
refused to believe tt and when the
President positively denied it we ne
cepted his statement as true. Hut the
charge Is repeated and an investiga
tion demanded. This changes the as
pects of the case materially, and The
Knglo believes that if the President
refuses to respond to this demand he
will be, and ought to be held guilty
of falsehood and of countennncelng
bargain, Intrigue and corruption of the
grosses! character. As already re
marked, the whole affair is disgrace
ful, not only to the President and
his partv but to the American people.
and for the good name of our country
we all ought to hope that the presi
dent will be able to clear himself.

For River and Harbor Work.
Washington, I). C. Dec. S. With
upwards of 2.000 delegates In attend
ance, coming from nearly every stale
and territory or the Union, the Tlftn
annual convention or the National
Rivers and Harbors Congress was
opened here today. The thief pur
pose of the gathering Is to urge the
government to make provision annual
ly for river and harbor work and car
ry It forward on a systematic scale,
Instead of leaving the river and har
bor bill as a "pork barrel'' measure
with which to dump a few millions
Into congressional districts where It
will do the most good on the eve of
an election.
President Joseph E. Rnnsdel 1 of
Ioulslnna called the gathering to or
der. The business sessions of the
convention will continue three days
and papers and addresses will be' pre
sented covering practically every
phase of the subject by men familiar
with the problem of inland watrways,
An elaborate programme of entertain
ment has been arranged for the vis
itors. The congress will discuss water
way projects and harbor improve
ments In all parts of the country. Par
ticular attention will be given, how
ever, to the plans for deepening and
Improving the Ohio anil Mississippi
rivers for commercial navigation. An
other leading subject of discussion will
be the development of the prtiosed
Inside passage along the Atlantic
coast, so that warships, scattered at
different Atlantic stations could run
under shelter to rendezvous.
Foremost ' among the scheduled
speakers at the congress are Andrew
Carnegie, Ambassador llryco of Great
Urltnln, who will present a review of
the waterways and canals of the
United Kingdom and their relation to
trade and commerce; Ambassador Nu
buco of Urall, Major J. A. Ockerson
of the Mississippi river commission,
Governor W. F. Frcar or Hawaii, Sec
retary of the Interior Garfield, Horace
McFarland, president of the Natioul
Chic Federation; Governor N. H.
Ilrowunl of Florida, who Is the presi
dent of the National Drainage associa
tion; Admiral C. M. Chester, who was
a delegate to the International water
ways congress recently held In St.
Petersburg, and President Samuel
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor, who will discuss "Labor's
Interest In Waterways Development."
The Initial session today was given
over largely to welcoming the guests
and organization. When this hail been
accomplished Secretary J. F. Ellison
proceeded to read the official call for
the gathering. The call was In part
as follows:
"The Improvements of the water
ways of the Nation, which this nation
al convention will ndvocnte and dis
cuss, means Increased and cheapened
transportation racllltles tor tne proiiuc
er and the consumer, and there Is no
question b- fore the American people
more worthy or their serious thought
development and utilization or these
natural and economic channels of
trade and transportation.
"The National Rivers and Harbors
Congress advocates a" policy, not a
project; It represents no particular
section or project, but Is the direct
representative of all sections that have
a meritorious claim for (he improve
ment of a river, a lake, a harbor or
a canal. This national organization
with delegates from every part of
the Union In nntlonal convention as
sembled, will ndvocnte and stand for
a broad, liberal, comprehensive pol
icy for the. Improvement by the Fed
eral Government of all waterways that
have been examined and favorably
reported upon by the United States as
worthy of improvement for the bene
fit of the commerce of tho country.
"The platform of the two great po
litical parties have unequivocally In
dorsed and declared for the Improve
ment of our livers and harbors Is thus
taken out or the political Held and
placed on the roll or business, ques
tions, the solution or which Is de
manded by nil sections and all brunch
es of trade and commerce from their
representatives In the Congress or the
United States."
