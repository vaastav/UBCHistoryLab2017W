, Washtsoton. Dec. 0. President Mc
Klnley sent his annual message to con
gress. He congratulated it upon assembling under
felicitioUH conditions. Peace and good will with
all nations of the earth continue unbroken, he
sajnt. and we bhoiild feel genuine satisfaction at
toe frrowing spirit of fraternal regard and uni
flcation in ail sections of our country and the
lifting of great public questions above party
prejudice.
The Finances.
- Beginning with the subject of the finances,
the preifif nt says that while the full effect of
the legislation of the extra session has not yet
.been realized, what it has already accomplished
assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To
test its permanent value further time will be
required and the people, satisfied with its oper
ations and results thus far, are in no mind to
withhold from it a fair trial. The next ques-
tion pressing for consideration is that of the
currency. With the great resources of govern
ment and with the honorable example of the
past before us. we ought not to hesi
tate . m enter upon a currency
..... .,, , "i" i-mrcucy i
revision which will make our demand obiiga- I
nuns less onerous to tne government, and re- j
Iteve our financial laws from ambiguiiy and j
doubt. The evil of the present system is !
found in the great cost to the government of j
maintaining at, a parity with goM our different j
u.uutjr. ttim wic w jt.ricjii:t: fji iuk past
tour years have demonstrated that this is not
only an expensive charge upon the government,
but a dangerous menace to the national
credit. It is manifest that we must devise
Rome plan to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions. We
have ItfW.OUO.OuU of currency, which the gov
ernment, by solemn enactment, has undertaken
to keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem
In gold but the government, which must borrow
the gold. The law, which requires the payment
out of the treasury of redeemed United States
notes, demands a constant replenishment of the
told reserve, especially (p. times of panic and
insufficient revenue, and during the preceding
administration &2,3la,40t 4'i-per-cent. bonds
were issued and sold to sustain
the gold reserve and pay the expenses
of the government in excess of revenue. While
it is true that a greater part of this is used to
supply deficient revenues, a considerable por
tion was required to maintain the gold reserve.
If no further legislation is to be had, to correct
this and the policy of selling bon is is to be
continued, then congress should give the sec
retary of the treasury authority to sell bonds
at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of
interest than Is now authorized by law. The
president says:
Recommendations.
i "I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts
Of the government are quite suflli ient to pay ail
the expenses of the government, that when any
United States notes are presented for redemp
tion in gold and are redeemed in gold, such
notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid
out In e-change for goid. This is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the
United States note prefers the gold
and gets it from the government
he should not receive back from the govern
ment a United States note without paying gold
in exchange for it,"
That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv
ing an interest bearing debt, a government
bond, for a non-iuterest bearing debt, a United
-States note. Trie government should be re
lieved from the burden of providing all the
gold required for exchanges and expt.rts. This
ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity
and sufficient receipts we may feel no immediate
embarrassment, but the danger will be ever
present.
The president Invites careful consideration
for the detail plan of the secretary or the treas
ury to protect the gold reserve, lie concurs
with him in the recommendation that national
banks be allowed to issue notes to the face
valueof their bonds derwsiteil: that their cir
culation tax be reduced to one-hall of one per
cent, and national banks may be established
with a capital of 2d,uuu. lie also recommends
that the issue of national bank notes be re
stricted to Uis denomination of ten dollars and
upwards find that they be required to redeem
their no.es in gold.
The Cuban Question.
I Turning to foreign affairs, the president de
votes much space in his message to a consider
ation of theC'U'.sn question, which he says, is
the most important problem with which our
government is now called upon to deal in its
foreign relations. Summarising the history of
former outbreaks, the president comes down to
the present insurrection, spealiiug of its re
markable increase, its tenacious existence
against enormous forces massed by Spain, the
widespread destruction of property and the
disregard or the civilized code of
war on both sides. He says these conditions
give rise to gravest apprehensions. There is
no desire on our part to protlt bv Spain's mis
fortunes, and we have only the" desire to see
Cubans enjoying that measure of seif-control,
which is the inalienable right of man. Of the
concentration pulley of Weyier he savs: "It
has utterly failed as a war measure. It is not
civilized warfare it is extermination."
Our Government's Trot est.
Against this abuse of the' rights of war, the
president says, he has felt constrained, on re
peated occasions, to enter the firm and honest
protest of this government, lie outlines his
instructions to Minister Woodford, which were
In substance to impress upon the Spanish gov
ernment the sincere wish of the United States
to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by
reaching a pone f ul and lasting result, just and
honorable to Spam and to the Cuban peopie.
It was also nsked whether Spain of her own
volition should not make proposals for settle
ment and it was said that we could not contem
plate an Indefinite period for the accomplish
ment of this nsulL
The Spanish Reply.
' The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford, was, in
the president's opinion, in the direction of a
better understanding. It admitted our friendly
purposes and deep interest, and declared that
the new government was bound to change of
policy that should satisfy the United Stales and
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this
end political reforms will te put into effect and
military operations conducted on humane
lines. It was suggested that Spain be
left free to conduct militnry operations
and grant political reforms while the
United Stales for its part sliuuld enforce neu
tral obligations and cut off the assistance
which the insurgents, it was asserted, received
from this country. Early and complete pacifi
cation is hoped for.
The president declares that the Spanish dis
position to charge us with failure to meet in
ternational duties is baseless, and points to
the efforts this government have made at the
cost of millions, and by the employment of the
administrative machinery of the nation to per
form its dut y well. He also says that the fact
that no military expedition or armed vessel
has left our shores has been diplomatically
represented with Spain. Promising that
throughout all the horror and danger to our
peace, the United States has never abrogated
its right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the
president points out that, of untried measures,
there remains only: Recognition of the insur
gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde
pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end
the war by imposing a rational compromise be
tween the contestants, an intervention in favor
of one or the other party.
Mo Forcible Annexation.
He says: "I speak not of forcible annexa
tion, for that can not be thought of. That by
our code of morality would bu criminal aggres
sion. Taking up the question of belligerency,
the president quotes at length from President
Grant's message of December 7, W7S, wherein
he declared that the condition in Cuba war
ranted neither the recognition of independence
nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds
that moreover a recognition of bellig
erency would confer upon neither
party to conflict a status not theretofore act
ually possessed while it would weiKU beavily
in Spain's behalf, giving her the right to search
on the hlh seas and extending her maritime
rights to the margin of our territorial waters.
"For these reasons," says the president," "I
regard the recognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter
be deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty,
the executive will take it."
Hopeful Change in Spanish Policy.
He points to the hopeful change in the Span
ish policy to the pledge of reform nnd to the
abatement of the horrors of war as reasons
gainst intervention on humanitarian grounds.
The first acts of the new government lie in the
. honorable paths it has outlined; the policy of
rnpine and extermination has been reversed
and broadclemencies proffered; measures have,
been taken to relieve the horrors of starvatio n
The power of the Spanish armies, it is as
t ened, is to be used not t o spread ruin and des
olation, but to protect the resumption of agri
cultural industries. The president sketches
the autonomy scheme of the SDanish srovern-
meut, and says that it is honestly due to Spain
that she should be given a reasonale chance to
realize her expectations, and to prove the as
sff6? efflciacy of the new order of things to
which she stands irrevocably committed. He
points to the many concessions already made,
o the modifications of the horrible order of
concentration, to the release of the "Com-
. petitor" prisoners, nnd the fact that not a
single American citizen is now under
arrest in Cuba. Ho says the near future will
demonstrate whether a righteous peace is likely
to be attained, U not, the exigency of farther
and other action by the United States will re
main to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov
ernment will continue its watchful cares over
every American citizen and its efforts
to bring about honorable peace ond,
"J the President: "If it shall here
"ter appear to be a duty imposed
W our obligations to ourselves, to civilization
and humanity to intervene with force, it shall
oj without .fault on our part, and oaly because
; weijMocssuy for such uptlon win be so clear ax
. . Hawaiian Annexation.
The president next takes up the subject St
the annexation of Hawaii which, he says- should
be accomplished. Rapidly reviewing his former
arguments in favor of annexation, he says that
legislation is required in the event of the ratifi
cation of the treatv and. while abrupt assimila
tio.s of immature elements of population should
be avoided, just provision should be made for
self-rule in local matters with the largest po
litical liberty to the Hawaiiaus.
He says tuat the dispute between Japan and
Hawaii over the immigration question is now
in a setisf Hctorv stage of settlement by negotia
tions; thtt our government has not intervened,
and that it is learned that Japan is now con
fident in the intention of this government to
deal with all possible ulterior questions affect
ing her interests in the broadest spirit of
friendliness.
Central American Complexities.
Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Mer
ry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on
account of the obligations of that countrv to
the diet of the Cireater Kepublic of Central
Ameilca. As there is no legal autiioritv at
present to accredit him to the diet, Mr. Baker,
the present minister at Managua, has been di
rected to present his letters of recall. Mr. W.
Godfrey Hunter is said m be likewise accred
ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Re
public, and his case is awaiting action.
The Nicaragua Canal.
The Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of large
importance to our countrv. and tbe i-mmisf ia
! made of further reference'to the subject which.
m me report 01 iae commission now at wore,
is sent to congress.
International Bi-9Ietallim.
The president says of the international mon
etary commission that, notwithstanding dil
igent ettort, the envoys have failed
so far to secure an agreement. Gratifica
tion is expressed at the action of France
in mis matter in joining m our enects. ana it la
said that the negotiations are still pending.
in this matter in joining in our effects, and it Is
Meanwhile the envovs have not made their
tinal reports, believinjt that the doubts raised in
certain quarters respecting tiie feasibility of
maintaining parity between eoiU and silver rnav
yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes
t hat their labors may bring about an interna
tional agreement.
Reciprocity Negotiation.
Mr. Kassort, of Iowa, is said to be now con
ducting negotiations with several governments
for reciprocity arrangements under the tariff
act, and it is believed that by a careful exercise
of the powers conferred by the act, some griev
ances of our own and other countries in our
mutual trade relations may be removed or alle
viated and the volume of our commercial ex
changes enlarged
The president earnestly urges the improve
ment of our merchant marine, the inferiority of
which, he says, is humiliating to the national
pride.
Protection of Seal Life.
Reference is made to the recent conferences
at Washington on the subject of the protection
of seal life, the results of which place bevond
controversy, it is said, of the duty of the gov
ernments concerned to adopt measures without
delay for the preservation of the herds. Nego-
iv cuu oic uv iu pruisruaj.
International Arbitration.
International arbitration is declared by the '
president to represent the best sentiment of the
civilized world, and treaties embodying these
humane principles on broad lines, "without in
any way imperilling our interests or honor, will
have its constant encouragement.
The Paris Exposition.
A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order
that the United States may make a creditable
exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, in
which the people have shown an unprecedented
interest.
The Navy.
Under the head of the navy, the president
points to the necessity for speedy legislation
to procure the armor for the three battleships
now building, which would be otherwise use
less. Ho speaks in terms of praise of the qual
ity of our ship-;, and thinks that the time has
now arrived when the increase to which the
country is committed should for a lime take
the form of increased facilities commensurate
with the increase of our naval vessels
Lack of Dock l'u-Uitlos.
He refers to the lack of docks, and urges that
three or four of the largest docks be provided
on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific
coast, and a floating dock in the gulf. There
should also be ample provision for munitions
of war and an increase of officers and enlisted
men. Additions are also necessary to navy
yards, and as there arc now on the slocks live
large battleships it is recommended tnat an
appropriation be made but for one more battle
ship on the Pacitic coast. Several torpedo
boats are also necessary.
Legislation Needed for Alaska.
Attention is called to the need for prompt
legislat ion as to Alaska and the extension of
civil authority witnin the territory. There is
need for surveys and for the establishment of
another land oftlce at some point in the Yukon
valley, for which an appropriation is asked.
Military force is also necessary and the estab
lishment of some sort of flexible government.
If the startling reports as to the probable
shortage of food for the miners be fully veri
fied, every effort should be made at any cost to
carry them relief.
Affairs in the Indlun Territory.
The message deals at some length with the
unsatisfactory condition of aifairs in the Indian
territory. The large white element is said to be
without protection and without schools or oth
er rights of citizens; leading Indians have ab
sorbed great tracts of lands and created an
aristocracy, and the friends of the Indians be
lieve that the best interests of the five civilized
tribes would be found in American citizenship.
Failure of the Dawes Commission.
Reference is made to the failure so far of tho
Dawes commission to secure the consent of the
tribes to an extinguishment of The tribal titles
and a division of the lands. It is said that
should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree
ment, that some legislation should be had by
congress.
The (Jnarantiiie Laws.
The president approves the recommendation
of the secretary of the treasury for an exten
sion of the quarantine laws, and also suggests
the appointment of a special commission to as
certain the cau-e of yellow fever.
The Kansas Pacific Railroad.
Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas
Pacific railroad, it is said, that if no better
bidder is received than the upset price fixed by
the court, the government would receive only
fcS.500.WM on its claim of nearly 113,0 0.009. He
believes that the government has the authority
to bid on the road, and has directed the secre
tary of the treasury to make the deposit of
ifiruu.oiiti required to qualify as a bidder, and to
bid at the sale a sum at least equal to tho prin
cipal of the debt to the government.
Congress Should Legislate In the Case.
He suggests, however, that in a matter so im
portant as the government becoming a possible
iwner of the railroad, congress should enact
some legislation to define its views. Itjs clear
to him, however, that the government should
not permit the property to be sold at a price
less than one half the principal of its debt and
less than one-fifth of lis entire debt, principal
and interest.
The Civil Service.
The president devotes the last chapter of his
message to ihe civil service, the oractical im
provement or which, he says, has long been a
subject of 'truest discussion, ana which has of
late years received increased legislative and ex
ecutive approval. Durinjr the past few months
the service has been placed upon a still
firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While the
right of deserving veteran soldiers
to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals
for merely political reasons have been carefully
guarded against; the examinations improved
and made practical, anil a distinct advance
has been made by Kivingu hearing before dis
missal upon all cases where incompetency is
charged or demand made for the removal of
officials. This last has been done with
out impairing the power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards
of the system. Much remains to be done be
fore the system can be perfected, and the pres
ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt
cases which he thinks have been improperly
inciuueu in me ciassincu service, or inciuao
those which, in his judgment, will best promote
the public service. The system has the ap
proval of i he people, and it will be his endeavor
to upnoia ana extend it.
Retrenchment Suggested.
In conclusion, the president admonishes con
gress not to encourage the Increase of ths esti
mates for the maintenance of the Government.
They would adraitor decrease inmany branches
and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopro-
priations within the receipts of the govera-
An Episode.
"No, Johnl"
The words were spoken gently, yet
firmly. Ilad I been older and more ex
perienced in the ways of the gentler
sex I might have known that the an
swer was final.
But I was young very, very young
and I was vain enough to think that
she would be unable to resist my plead
ing. I entreated her to take back those
cruel words; but she would not listen.
I begged I implored, but she was in
exorable. Yet she was kind. She mere
ly t6ld me that nothing I could say
would move her. It was for my own
y-jod, she said, and some day I would
thank her for it.
Her calm, cool manner angered me,
and, forgetting the deference due the
fair sex, I threatened violence.
She looked at me reprovingly and
shook her head. She did not fear me
in the least Tortnre beyond endurance
by grief and anger, I burst into un
manly tears.
At last she was aroused. Drawing
herself up to her full height, she said,
in angry tones; "No, John Henry, joa

you don't stop that noia I'll spank JOB
BLANCO ON AUTONOMY.
The Captain-General Declares That Cuba's
Offer From Spain Is a Measure of Au
tonomy Greater than U Implied by the
Autonomy of Canada It Is, However.
Only on Paper Thus Far.
NewYokk, Dec. 7. Capt'-Gen. Blan
co of Cuba has handed the corre
spondent of the World a statement
giving his views on Cuban autonomy,
The statement, signed by Blanco,
governor general and captain genera,'
of Cuba, follows:
The autonomy which Spam freely offers to
Cuba is genuine and complete. It is more than
is implied by "the autonomy of Canada." The
crown merely reserves ths functions of foreign
relations, the supreme court and the navy and
war departments. All powers which have
colonies ret lin these, the natural attributes of
a mother country.
The Cubans have home rule. They may enact
their own laws, interpret them and execute
them.
For a sufficient time to allow the manufactur
ing interests of Spain to adjust themselves to
the new foreign competition there will be main
tained a differential duty in their favor. Hut
ultimately the disposition of its tariff regula
lations will be wholly in the power of Cuba.
Peace will follow the establishment of thejnew
regime. God willing. I hope to finish the im
plantation within one month . I expect shortly
to reduce this destructive war to the condition
of mere brigandage. One-half of the insur
gents have died from tireless pursuit, hunger
and disease. Ninety per cent, of them were
whites. To-day the so-called "Army of Lib
erty" is mostly a collection of mulattoes and
blacks under leaders of every color and coun
try. Such men do not fight for principle.
1 think that when these men find that there
Is food as well as peace beneath our flag, they
will Hock to it.
I shall attack the insurgents upon their own
ground and in their own way. With my regular
troops and native assistance I expect shortly to
break the backbone of the insurrection. Your
Indian tighter. Gen. Crook, adoptel the same
tactics, and the Knglish employ them in India.
The reconcentraiion is in a greatly bettered
condition.' It has lost its most poignant as
pects. I have given f lOO.o) already and in
tend to add soon another gift of equal amount.
I expect to save three-quarters of the recon
centrados now alive. By activity in implant
ing autonomy and in harassing the rebels I ex
pect to shortly reduce the insurgents to unor
ganized brigands.
The topography, the climate and the fertility
of Cuba insure the continued existence of wide
spread brigandage as long as the roving bands
are supplied with rifles, cartridges and clothes.
In short, the duration of the war is simply a
matter for you, the American people, to decide.
If you continue to allow stering expedi
tions to leave your shores, against the efforts of
your government, you will enable the insur
gents to at least in part keep up the war against
Spain, against their own interests, against the
interests of Cuba and against the interests of
American citizens.
Spain is the historic friend and real mother-
country of the United States of America, the
greatest of the republics of the continent.
You, their people, are fair-minded and
intelligent, and I believe I must
believe that when you know the
full seope of the autonomy now given to
Cuba, when you come to realize fully it is best
for Spain, for Cuba and for the United States,
you will cease to support the men who alone
can prevent it. Hlanco.

DINGLEY TARIFF FIGURES.
They Show a Favorable Condition
for the New Law.
Scant Comfort for Democrats tn Com
parlnir It with the Wilson Law
A Substantial Im
provement. Special Washington Correspondence.!
When it meets a week hence congress
will find that the tariff law which it
placed upon the statute books in the
special session held a few months ago
has performed all the duties that could
have been expected of it during the
four months test which it has had.
When the men who framed it and placed
it upon the statute books hurried home
ward last July, leaving it to meet the
adverse conditions resulting from the
enormous importations which pre
ceded its enactment, they did not ex
pect that its first four months could
give any adequate indication of its ca
pacity as a revenue produced. The five
months which preceded its enactment
were marked by such enormus importa
tions that it was expected that the drop
in importations and consequently in
revenues would be very great immedi
ately upon the passage of the bill. Dur
ing the five months which preceded the
enactment of the new law the importa
tions were about $100,000,000 in excess
of the normal importations for that
period and the revenue for the first time
in the history of the Wilson law was
sufficient to meet the running expenses
of the government, averaging during
those five mofiths, $36,000,000 per month,
against an average of $25,500,000 per
month during the other 30 months of
the history of that act. It was not sur
prising, then, that the men who framed
the Dingley law left Washington after
placing it upon the statute books in the
expectations that its earnings in the
first few months of its existence would
be extremely light.
They will find, however, upon their
return that the new law has done better
than was expected of it under these ad
verse conditions. In the four months in
which it will then have been in opera
tion its earnings will surpass by several
millions the earnings of the Wilson law
in the corresponding four months of its
history, and have at the same time
shown a recuperative power which in
dicates clearly that when the normal
conditions return will be ample as a
revenue producer. Starting its work
with a month in which its importations
were barely half what they had aver
aged during the closing months of the
Wilson law, its earnings for that
month, August, were $19,023,614, in
creasing nearly $3,000,000 in the month
which followed and again in the third
month making nearly as large an in
crease, while the earnings of the pres
ent month will reach a round $25,000,
000. And this has occurred with no
revenue of any consequence from sugar,
woll or many other revenue producing
articles with which the warehouses of
(he country had been filled to over
flowing just prior to the enactment of
the law. Treasury officials express the
belief that the revenue from sugar
alone, after the stock now in the coun
try is exhausted, will reach $5,000,000
per month, while that from other
sources must increase sufficiently to
add from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 per
month.
It is apparent from the work which
the new law has performed under the
adverse conditions which have sur
rounded it that members of congress
when they come together a week hence
may feel well satisfied with the work
they performed in the special session
in placing this act upon the statute
books, and may confidently expect that
it will within a very short time prove
ample in its revenue producing power.
It is expected that the importations of
sugar will be resumed early in the com
ing year, probably in January, and that
there will be a marked increase in other
lines of importations, so that there is
good reason to expect that the receipts
will average $1,000,000 a day early in
the coming year and that the receipts
in the calendar year 1896 will, for the
first time since the election of Grovei

The receipts under the new law have
been published from month to month
since it went into operation, but a com
parison of the receipts with those of the
corresponding months in the history of
the Wilson law will be interesting at
this time. The Wilson law, it will be re
membered, came into operation with
the warehouses and shelves of the coun
try empty, waiting large import under
the reduced tariff rates which it of
fered, while the Dingley law came into
operation with conditions exactly re
versed. Tn view of these circumstances
in which the importations during the
first few months of the Wilson law
were in excess of the normal, while
those of the first few months of the
Dinglev law were far below the normal
a comparison of the earnings of these
two laws in their first four months will
be especially interesting to those who
desire to judge of the comparative
merits of the two acts.
Treasury receipts during the first
four months of the Dingley law com
pared with the receipts during the first
four mon ths of the Wilson law:

attitude of President McKinley on the
Cuban question. This anxiety is doubt
less due to the fact that a war cloud
would check, if not absolutely destroy
the business improvement among farm
