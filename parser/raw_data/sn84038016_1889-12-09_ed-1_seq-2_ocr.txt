says: Jeflerson Davis is dead. The
rebellion whioh he led still lives in a
large portion ot the country where he
has been worshipped as the chief cham
pion of the false dootrines that justified
eoession as a "State's right." The
form whioh the present rebellion takes
is clearly desoribed by President Har
rison and Attorney-General Miller in
their references to the suppression or
intimidation of the suffrage. A Repub

and efficiently for the maintenance of
the Constitutional guarantees that were

Senator Hals has introduced four
bills whioh all relate to the navy. The
first provides for the construction of
eight battle ships of 7.500 tolO.CCO tans

one thousand tons, and five torpedo
boats. They may be built at the navy

dow in commission ; the armored coast
defense vessels after historic events
or persons or plaoes, and the un
armored ooasters after rivers. The
third bill is of capital importance. The
personnel ox tue navy is what makes it
effeotive more than anything else; and
this bill is intended to improve that,
and more especially to provide a higher
class of seamen. The term of enlist
ment is enlarged, and special pay is
given for long service. After thirty
years of service seamen may be retired
upon three-fourths pay. The fourth
bill authorizes the Secretary ot the
Navy to have steamships engaged in
lake, coasting and foreign trade exam

cruisers in case of war. These bills
exaotly embody the recommendations
ot the Secretary of the Navy.

The department of music ot Eirlham
college, under the management ot Mrs.
Alice B. Finley. gave a reoital in Lind-
ley Hall last Saturday evening. Many
people lrom the neighborhood and city
were oresent. and most tl the seats on
the floor ot the hall and many in the
gallery were taken.
Muoh interest had been awakened as
the time approached tor the first enter
tainment under the skillful management
ot the new mstruotor, Mrs. r inley, and
it was a great compliment to the depart
ment to be greeted with suoh a highly
appreciative auiienoe.
The program was opened by a piano
duet from Weber, entitled Pol aoo a
Brillante," rendered by Mrs. Finley
and her sister. Miss Brown. This se
lection was well reoeived and tully
merited the hearty applause whioh was
given, being a difficult eeleotion and
sDlendidlv executed,
Miss Delia Newsom came next with
a beautiful soprano solo, "Tell Me.
Baautilul Maiden." This seleotion was
given in Miss Newsom's usually at
traotive manner, and the audienoe
showed their appreciation of the effort
by encoring her. and she responded
, with, another Deanxiiui selection.,
the auiienoe. This solo was TuiSIv

Xo the Editor of the Palladium :
In the series of articles published in
the Palladium, last Summer, under
the general title ot "Larly Indiana, tne
expression "Pioneer Period" was used
in such ways as to convey the idea that
the progress ot the State was diviaea or
can be divided into different periods or
stages. The time hen under consider

people were more hopeful and began to
contemplate great projects for public
i m rii"fwm tan ta
Before- continuing tne consideration
nf avonta in the Period iuat now indi
cated as opening about 1831, it will be
well to consider the whole History oi .In
diana with referenoe to the changes in
the ohraoter ot events and in the con
ditions of the region.
divisions of Indiana's history.
Th entire, hiatorv of the region now
within the limits ot Indiana may be
tiviil icto three arrest parts or epochs,
each part marked by a diflereroi in the
form and source oi government.
ThA first cart may be called the "Col
onial Epoch," and extends from the
first visit ot white men in 1CC9, to the
establishment ot territorial government
in 1787. This part contains three re
rioda: 1st. the Period of Frenoh Su
nppminc. from 16t9 to 1763: 2d. the
Period of British Supremaoy, from 1763
to (ootqaest by Amerman Drontiers
men under Clark, in) 1779; 31, the Pe
ri.vl while governed by V lrgima and
olaimed by several States, until, being
ceded to the general government, tern
torial government was provided, irom
1779 to 1787.
The second part may be called th
"Territorial Epooh," extending lrom
1787 to 1816. This part contains two
Periods: 1st. the time under the organ
ization ot the Northwest Territory, from
1787 to 1800: 21 the Period ot the Ter
ritorv ot Indiana, from 1800 to 1816
when Indisna beoame a State.
The thirt part, following the manner
ot designating the preoeding parts, may
bo called the "State Epooh." It may
be divided into Periods; and the first
is the one already referred to and char
aoterized as the "Pionr Period," ex
tending from 1816 to 1831. With the
latter date, great activity began to pre
vail in Indiana, whioh seemed about
entering a new era. Extensive interna
improvements in canals and roads, were
undertaken at public expense. The
suooess ot the Erie Canal in New York
had given a pattern and awakened en
thusiaam. By the year 1837. the peopl
began to feel the finanoial depression

a large amount. Until 1845 the reputa
tion of the State was endangered, when
by some measures ot compromise, its
credit was saved. This Period may
beamed the irenod ot Internal Im
provements," beginning about 1831 and
ending somewhere from 184o to 1843
The time from 1840 to 1845 was called
"Dark days," from the finanoial troubles
ot those years.
.Beginning with tbe chances in the
years 1816. 1847 and 1843. and extending
to tne opening ot the Civil War, 1861,
was a renoo wnicn may be named the
'Period ot Re-organizition." At first,
it had been the policy to undertake the
constructions ot roads and canals at
public expense. I his policy resulted in
disaster financially to the State and
even to citizens. In the succeeding
Period, the policy adopted was to leave
the construction ot the larger and more
expensive ot such works to associations
ot men with money to invest in such en
terprises. As the business aflairs ot the
oountry began to revive, the people of
Indiana began to renew their exertions
to secure means of intercommunication
but on the policy ot associated capital.
Kailroads supplanted canals, and many
companies tor their construction, and
also companies tor the construction ot
toll roads, were chartered in the lasti
bait ot the forties and in the Fifties.

uonai anairs. A law tor a school tax
was submitted to the Deoc e in 1R4S
and the subjeot was for several years

the Bute Constitution adontad in
1S16. was regarded inadequate to the
age of railroads, telegraph, tree sohools
and improved machinery; and a new
form was adopted in 1851. .New issues
in national politics began to io finance
the people, and in the midst ot lair
prosperity, Indiana was called to take
part in the war tor the Union. From
what has been said, it will be seen that
the Period iust considered, mn K
designated as a "Period of fie organi
sation." The "Period of the Civil W.f"
from 1S61 to 165 inclusive need not
be here desoribed. Following it, comes
