Intends, by tbis dreadful war, to expunge the
Institution of Slavery from our political sys
tem. Dories; my mlnlatry of more than thirty
years, I have identified myself with uo politi
cal party, but I have Icpl myself posted in re
gard to the Slave power in tbis country, and by
a careful, andl trust prayerful examination of
its nature and tendency, my desire hue been
constantly increasing, that this power might
come to ao cud. The laws of political ecuiio
my and the laws of God alike dema .d it.
Dy tbe slave power, I mouu mainly the so
cial and political influence of tbe lurgu slave
holders, especially those of the Culboun school,
vow numbering perhaps not more tbau 100,001)'
This power forms the landed aristocracy of
the Booth, it rules in tbe politics and social
Ideas of tho Southern people, aud for a long
time, strange as it may seem, it has held al
most ao absolute mastery ov :r the Federal
Government. And now tkesu rneu startle the
moral sense of the world, with the bold declar
ation, that Slavery is essentially a beneficiiut
institution, divine in its sanctions, aud that the
ppecial mission of the South is to preserve Ibis
system snd extend it as fur as possible. Poli
ticians, and to every luge extent, Southern
christians, and christian miuictcrs have adopted
this view. Is it not lime that such u power,
to entagouistical to our Government uml our
free institution?, had come to an end?' Ii is
tbe most formidable antagonist to tbe progress
of civilization, of tnoderj time?. A system,
which contains within it no germs from which
improvement can spring, eruviintea inevita
bly towards barbarism, while it is imj o ltd by
ex:gen;ies inherent in its position circumstan
ces, to a constaut mention of its territorial
domain. From tbe year 1S1D, down to the
present time, tbe hittory.of tbe United States
has been one record of the aggressions of ibe
blave power, feebly, ami almost always unsuc
cessfully resisted by the North, aud cuhiiiin
tiog in tbe present war. Thai k Hod for the
hope tbat oar future will be diflereoi !
Instructed by the course of event, the Prtr.
Ident, who by ths Constitution, is the Commander-in-Chief
of tbe Army and Navy, bis
issued bis Proclamation of Emancipation, ns
one branch of bis war policy.
Tbis measure bus been the sulj:ct of much
careful thought ou tbe part of the Prc-iJeut,
and it deserves our careful and prayerful con
sideration. It kbould be noted, tbat ibe Proc
lamation is aimed, not al law-abiding citizms,
not at those who recogu;ze the authority of the
Constitution, but at rebellious communities, in
cluding those States and portions of States,
that are in armed rebellion againit tho Gov
ernment. The whole power of those cornmu
cities is now wielded for tho destruction of the
Government. Tbe slaves form a part of this
power. In their present condition, in spile of
themselves, they are practically onr enemies, o
truly ts their masters but wlru freed, they
have iovariably cted as our frien Is. Certain
ly then, it is a wise policy that endeavors to
weaken tbe foe and strengthen ourselves, by
freeing them and enlisting their power on our
tide.
Some doubt the Conilituliuwility of the Prcs
i loot's Proclamation of Emancipation over
looking tbe provisions of the Constitution in
time of war. A greater mistako could not well
bo made. As the Commander in-Chief of tbe
Army and Navy, iu time of war, for the pur
pose of weakening aud destroying the eocmy,
the Constitution guarantees to biin the right to
abolish slavery iu the rebellious Status, an J to
do anything and everything tbat bo puaeibl)
Can do, within the limitation of civilized war
fare, to secure tbe desired end. Ve;i, more
Tbe Constitution virtoal'y bii.di him to da so.
Id is oath of office biuds bin, to do si, and if he
were to neglect, or refuse to do so, he would
forfeit all claim to the cor.fl lence of the loyal
people, and at the Bar of God he would stand
coademned for pet jury.
For one, I believe it was impossible, f ,r thp
Fretideot to eocquer this rebellion, and restore
peace t the land without removing slavery.
d I am tare, tbat the God of nations and the
Judge of the oppressed, has by the dreadful
discipline of war driven us to tbis alternative,
tbat we may be obliged to eliminate the Insti
tution of Slavery from our political system.
' I go for the Union. I am for maintaining
be Integrity of tbe Constitution at any eost of
blood or treason. I believe in unconditional
loyalty; that every one, from tbe Piesideot
down to tbe lowest, should in the fear of Ibe
Lord, obey the organic law of Ibe nation tbe
Constitution; aud I ibak God, thai lit crush
log this unrive'ed rebellion, in obedience to the
well known stipulations of tbe Constitution, we
have the glorious prospect, that slavery, the
Immediate cause of the rebdlioo, will be re
moved, and posterity never again, in tbis land,
so.lijre.ed to civil war on its accouui.
d set rejoice in tbe war, or in tho suffer
pg of tie people, or iu the madness of the
rebels, but if this be providentially the pain-
fol birth of liberty to all the people, Iheu.
tU resort gained, I do roost devoutly rejoice,
Bel merely for the take of tbe slaves but equal
ly for tbe sake of the whites. s The blessing
will fall on Inthi therefore, I blest (iod for tbe
present prospect, that tbe dying day ef A'mer-
scao ooouaga w at uauu; eoae im i
wtiVh bi well D-b cost ua onr Kttiuntl life,
h henceforth to live on'y on the pages of his
tory, for a wtrniug to all coming generations.
V. Another great thing tbe Lord has done
for us, is found in the glorious prospects of thit
nation, If we tro successful in the present con
test. Everything depends on the question of
victo y. If we fail, the nmion is dismembered
and, our country politically ruined. We shall
bsve contracted an enormous public debt, and
sacrificed hundreds of thousands of precious
lives for no purpose. The South would thus
become the ruling people. Our position among
the notions of tbo earth would bo entiroly al
tered. We should become the prey of despots
iu the old world, having but little security al
home, and less credit abroad. Our commerce
wonld languish and our rapidly growing cities
would sink into decay. Such it the disheart
ning and appalling picture set before ns, if we
fail. Let lhoc who are willing to relinguish
the struggle and jhld to Ibe dumaudt of the
rebels, count tbe cost or tbe failure.
Ix-t tlio?o who prophecy failure, ami seem
balf-williug that events should conGrm tbe truth
of the prophecy, eslimutr, if they can, the
length and breadth, and height and depth of the
disaster iuvolved in tbo meaning of this word.
When nation like curs shall perish, proving
by its death, its incapacity for permanent life,
where uud when ahull the like be ever again pro
duced? We cannot afford to fail. To fail is
death. To succeed is life. And in regard to
our national existence, I may say to you iu tbe
language ol inspirutiou: "Heboid, now is tbe
uccepted lime! Behold uow is the day of sul
vatiot.!'1 It' we wiu and establish a righteous peace,
then no other nation on earth has before it such
a brilliant future. Tbe conquest will break up
the armies of the rebels, exhaust their power,
destroy the influence or their leaders, place them
iu the hands of the Federal Government, and
compel them to uccept such terms us the Gov
ernment may dictate. New ideas, new men,
new institutions uud new modes of industry
will take possession of the South. Southern
eocie'y will be reconstructed, aud euter upon a
uu v style of life.
Cuuquer ihrm ; hold possession of their ports
of entry; command their rivers with your guu-
b jats ; release tbe masses of tbe people from a
despotism that overhangs them like a cloud of
death; show to tho non-slaveholding whites
that their interests lie wi b the Uuion, and the
principles of a free democracy, rather than with
au aristocracy of laudlord.-; give lo the millions
of staves a chance to do something for their hn
mauity, aud ut uo distant period, a reconstruct
ed Uuion will be the result, resting ou a fir or r
basis than ever before. I siucercly believe
Ibis the shortest uud surest way lo the end.
This point beiug gaiucd, we shall have dem
onstrated to the world, the reality of oui na
tional life. Showiug that we are to be one
people nnd but one from Canada to tbe Gulf
of Mexico; from the Atlantic to the Pacific;
uud so showing it, that no earthly power will
bj likely an'uiu lo cull it in q tcslion.
Our success will speedily aud wonderfully im
prove the National mmincrs of Kngland and
France. Like other nations they respect pow
er, huJ they will find power here to respect.
We thall also have settled tbe quarrel ou
1'iis Continent between freedom and bondage,
and have restored our National life to its nor
mal coudition, removing the apple of discord
from tho land, and showing to the world,
tbat society orgauized ou tbe basis of free la
bor, is vastly superior lo one organized on tbe
opposite bus's.
If we can settle the questions which have
led to tho prottul crisis iu our National af
fairs, we shall have done a work as import
ant as any ono ever committed to any gen
eration ot men. Iu this aspect of our case,
we are living in a glorious age bless the
Lord for it!
Our duplicate system of Government, Fed
eral and Stale, is eminently gulled lo extend
its bruud banner over this whole Cuutineut.
lie the solar system, it has a central sun,
with revolving planets, whose smaller move
ments lie within the Comprehensive orbit of the
Nation's life. Our growth of population, ri
sing in three quarters of a century from three
millions lo more than thirty millions, will, at
tbis rate, iu another equal period, present a peo
ple, not only numerically greater than any na
tion iu Europe, but nearly eq ial to the present
population of all the European oalious put to
gcllier.
Let U8tl.cn go on. Let us now save our
selves from being denationalized. Let us go
forth to the work assigned to us, in the fjar of
God. Lei us do our duty, and our future will
be immeasurably more glorious than our past.
When I thiuk of this future as it will be, if we
now triumph, iu contrast with what it must be,
if we fsil, all tbo feelings of my heart arc kind
led into a fi line of patriotic, and I trust chris
tian ardur. Fail! Speak that word iu the ear
of dotards and cowards. It has no place in
my vocabulary.
Huccess is our duty. We must succeed. The
God of order and law. liberty and justice, re
quires us to succeed; and unborn generations
are waiting to reap the untold blessings of oar
success.
I have thus, my heurers, frankly opened to
you my heart ou tbe subject of our national af
fairs. Consoled and strengthened by the con
siderations which huvu been thus briefly pre.en
ted, I exhort you to stand Grin; to entertain no
idea of defeat; lo accept of no inglorious com
promise; oa 1 ateudily, with an unflinching hero
ism, pnrstie the struggle, till victory and peace
shall gladden the land, and bless tbe world.
May a Gracious Providence be propitious,
while a !oy' people leaning on his arm and in
voking bis aid, perfoiin the duties which beloug
to the cris'ul May the God of justice and or.
dsr, pnrity aud peace, ro-establish order and
harmony in our dorders by his good providence
making "the wrath of man to praise biro, and
restraining the remainder!"

Saturday Morning, December 12, 1863.
The President's Message was read on Wed
nesday, and has come to hand. It makes a lit
tle less than six columns in the Cleveland Lta
tr. We shall publish it next week.
East Tssnbsseb. Decisive newt at last
from East Tennesw Theslegoof Knox
ville Is at an end. Tho Rebel effort to
regain East Tennessee is abandoned for
ever. Longstreet is in full retreat toward
rirginnia, onr cavalry pursuing.
Tbe country mny breathe freer. We enn
hardly realize the tremcndoiii peril wo have
escnped Etst Tennessee was so long nei
lec'ed that lt value even now ts only hnlf
understood, yet it is truo beyond question
that tho loss of it is absolutely fatal t tho
Rebel Confederacy.
Nothing bnt do'pair could have driven
tbe Rebels to abandon their effort, and tbe
conviction tht it can never be recovered
will bo equally potent to parahza their
operations in other quarters.
It does not seem clear whether Long
street Is likely to he overtaken, or hit re
treat seriously intrrnpted We are satis
fied to learn that S'lerram and Foster are
in persuit, and will do what is possible to
destroy the Rebel force which tbey have
helped to defeat. There arrival doubtless
determined the ruining of the siepe, bnt the
credit of the defense is General Burnsidc's
alone. His whole enmpaign has been n
mnstcrpiece, and his final stand at Knox
v ile i what saved ns the State and shor

the war-

The annonncemcnt of the election of Mr.
Colfax was greeted wilb vociferous ap
plause. The small rebellion which Mr. Emer.'on
E tli riil sjc undertook to iniiiiznrn'e on his
own account wris summarily put nndcr foot
hy the IIou--c. It seems to have been
Hgreed that enough members should be ex
cluded nnd r-imiigli interlopers admitted
to control the dec' ion of Speaker; or, nt
least, cumuli to ruuke possible a bargain
for the Clerk-drip, to tie prsonnl o olti
men', in some way, of Mr. E' bridge, and
to the general benefit of the C ipperhsnd
faction wi' Ii whom he has chosen to nlly
himelf. The plot hud no other result than
to increase Mr. Colfnx's mjori'y, nnd to
cover Mr. E'hridire with public contempt.
The Motive voted by decisive mnjori'ie

Senate The Vice. President called the
Senate to o.dcr nt noon of Monday. Con
ncps, of California, oud Henderson, of Mo.,
were qnulifie l nnd took the oath of office
prescribed by tte Inst Congress. Messrs.
Van Winkle and Willey, of Western Vir
ginia, drew for tcruj, the former drawing
the long and the latter the short term.
Conservatives and Democracy.
The " Conferva! ive Convention," which as
sembled lotely ut Cincinnati, fastened upon Gen.
McClellan as standard bearer. Such a choice
was eminently beStting tbe Convention, and
the poverty and peuury of the doucr will, as
iu the case of the widow's mile, no doubt,
make the bestowment exceedingly valuable.
The Buffalo Erprnt make the following al
lusion, to this matter :
The first cundidate trollad into the field for
tbe Presidential race in 1864. is the little Xa
poleoo of the preseut wor Gen. George U.
McClellan. Tbat he was being groomed for
that contest bas beeu evident since be took
commuud of tbo Army or the Potomac; and,
unfortunately for the country, his political flat
terers ruined him as a Ocr.e-al renlcred tbe
Peninsular campaign a mortifying abortion, and
threw a durk cloud over bis militajy character
and fame from which be can never emerge.
Tie destroyers of his military usefulness fol
lowed him into rt tiracy with tbe gilded offer of
the Presidency, and from tbe day be retired
to the solitude of New J rsey, they have been
incubating his prospects as a political standard
bearer. The most experienced and skillful
grooms of tbe Copperhead stable bave bad bim
iu charge and training for the race. He has
been carefully blanketed with conservatism,
sponged with pro-sluve.ryism, and curried with
flattery, until be hut given great trouble to bis
keepers. Pending the Pennsylvania election
he broke his halter, aud damaged himelf by a
foolish letter writteu io behalf of a doomed
candidate. Since then, be has been snugly (ta
bled with a strengthened baiter and kept from
public view and influence at much as potaible,
in tbe hope tbat his Woodward antic might be
forgotten, and be made available some months
Lence, as the Copperhead candidate for the
Presidency. But it's no use. Little Mao is
done lor! de id, politically. He dwells in tbe
region of fossils and mummies, and will be re
collected only among tbe thing that are obsolete.
Escape from Camp Douglas. On
I Wednesday night of last week there was
another quite extensive escape of prisoners
from Csnip Douglas, by meant of a tunnel
retching ouUide of the prison enclosure.
The commenced escaping about 8 o'clock
'' tbe ereoiug, and before the leak wat dis
covered seventy -eight bad passed out. Tbe
alarm, was ibeo. raited, tbe leakstopped,
I patrols sent iuto the eity, and the poll
set on vb Ilea to vatib loose who bad
succeeded lo getting out. Up to Tbnrs'
day evening, the Chictga Tribune says, be
tween twenty and thirty of those escaping
had been recaptortd and ictnrntd to the
prison and it wet thought the rest wonld
be.
There Is no doubt of outside help being
a folded the ptisoueia.
Emancipation Proclamation. The orig
inal instrument, which wat transmitted to
the Great Sanitary Fair rtccutly held at
Chicsga, it now being engraved, to that
fac similes of it may be s retired for tale.
The Phk-idknt's Speech. Surpassingly
fine at Mr. Everett oration wat iu tbe
Gettysburg consecration, the rhetorical
honors of the occasion were won by Presi
dent Lincoln. His little sprecli is a per
fect gem; deep in feeling, compact in
thought aud expression, and tasteful and
clrguul in every word nnd comma. Tuuii
it hut the merit of unexpectedness in its
verbal perfection and beauty. We had
grown so accustomed to homely and im
perfect phrase iu bis productions that we
begau to thiuk it was the law of his utter
ance. Rut this shows be cau talk baud
somely as well as act sensibly.
The free colored schools in We llington
