Navy Department Loath to Detach
Patrol Vessels from Present Duties.
Secretary Bryan Reticent.
The request of Col. Goethals for .serv
ices of torpedo boat destroyers as a
police force to compel the observance
of the regulations regarding- the neu
trality of the Panama Canal yesterday
was referred by Secretary of War Gar
rison to Secretary of State Bryan and
Secretary of the Navy Daniels Al
though conferences were held by offi
cials of the three departments, no de
cision in the matter was reached.
It developed that Secretary Bryan
hadn't heard of the matter, and that
the Navy Department doe. n't want to
detach destroyers from other duties to
the service of Gov. Goethals in canal
waters. Secretary Garrison, on the
other hand, refused to commit himself,
with the result tha it now seems
doubtful whether Col. Goethals will get
the ships he has asked for.
In many quarters, however, opinion
was expressed that swift armed vessels
of some sort should have been furnished
Gov. Goethals for policing the canal and :
adjacent waters at the time the United
States neutrality was declared, and cer
tainly as soon as special regulations
were issued regarding the use of radio
stations in United States jurisdiction,
and the special rules for the Panama
Canal were promulgated. It was pointed
out that not only destroyers. ' but even
the new dreadnaught New York, had
been assigned to similar duty off the for the celebration, and almost daily con
port of New York. While the situation I sultations are held in the office of Sec
at New York is different from that at rvtary Garrison, attended by represen

The substance of the dispatch Is that

and the prevention of their misuse as j for the trip.
a base of supplies require the presence
in canal waters of swift-moving ships
of the variety mentioned.
"Since the questions involved require
the consideration of the State and the
Navy departments, as well as my own,
I have taken the matter up with the
other departments, and as soon as the
!
reoulrements are fully ascertained
proper action will be taken to meet
them."
At the Navy Department a disposition
was shown to maintain that the problem
could be settled in some other way with
out the use of patrol boats
The fact 1
that the naval authorities do not con
sider they have too many destroyers in
full commission now, and arc not in
clined to spare two for service at the
canal, which would remove them indefi
nitely from the routine exercises of the
fleet. One officer contends that the four
submarines now at the canal satisfac
torily could be used for Cot. Goethals"
purposes, but there is little agreement
with this, as the submarines not only
are slow moving, but are regarded as
most poorly adapted for such patroling
duties as would be required of vessels
assigned to this work.
Bryaa Not Informed.
At the State Department Secretary
Bryan said he had not heard of the mat
ter officially, and that he had not even
read the newspaper reports of the propo
sition. It was learned, however, that
other officials have the matter under
consideration.
Opinion was expressed that destroyers
should be sent If Col. Goethals thinks
their presence necessary, as, it was
pointed out. the United States govern
ment owes it to itself and to the belliger
ents to leave undone nothing necessary
to secure abas-lute enforcement of strict
neutrality of the Panama Canal and ad
jacent watera.
At the British Embassy it again was
declared that no official adfices on the
subject had been received there and that
the subject was not under discussion with
the State Department. The British gov
ernment. It was pointed out. Is interested
moat vitally In having the neutrality of
the canal strictly guarded, and confidence
was expressed that if any British shtp
had bean violating the rules. It would be
expected that the United States would
take such action as might be necessary

HERALD COMMENDED
- FOR VICE CRUSADE
Northeast Washington Citizens' Asso
ciation Unanimously Adopts
Resolution.
The Washington Herald was com
mended for its "able and persistent ef
forts" to suppress the vice system in
Washington in a resolution passed last
night by the Northeast Washington Cltl
sens' Association. MaJ Sylvester and the
police force were thanked for their ef
forts to erase the system.
W. S. Branson introduced the resolu
tion, which was adopted unanimously.
President Evan H. Tucker in a speech
previously commended the work of The
Herald, and said it should be supported
by all citlzena. Mr. Branson's resolution
was:
"Whereas the moral sensibilities of all
good citizens of the District have been
shocked by the information that organ
ized vice exists therein; and
"Whereas we believe the National Cap
ital should be the model city of this na
tion, morally as well as in all other re
spects; be it
"Resolved. That we heartily approve
the action of The Washington Herald In
exposing the existence of said vice and
its able and persistent efTorts for the
abolition of the same; and be it further
"Resolved. That we commend the super
intendent of police for his energetic ef
forts to apprehend and to bring to jus
tice all persons engage! in such nefarious
business, and that we recommend the
employment of a sufficient number of
officers in this work to effectively erase
such a blot from our fair city."

In a statement last night, H. B. F.

committee of the Committee of tine Hun-
"We shall, of course, appeal to th,- Sen
ate and with good hope of success. The
Senate struck out section of the District
appropriation bill as It came from the
House list session, snd that was less
radical than the rider now sent to the
Senate. The fact that this rider was put
on after only half an hour's debate in the
House and no more in District Commit
tee ts significant. Four years of study
were given to th enactment of the act
of litis. All we ask under the right of
petition Is that all the Senators and Rep
resentatives shall examine the facts.
"The Committee of One Hundred will
continue to ask their friends throughout
the country to co-operate with them.
The National Civic Organization having
their headquarters in Washington which
have been engaged ln this undertaking
will continue their efforts. People of
the country are as much Interested as
those who live here in maintaining the
progress of the National Capital. To
carry out all the plans for its develop
ment and the improvement of Its mu
nicipal services as an integral whole,
the local tax revenue and an equal con
tsibutlon by the United States are re
quested year after year. If the progress
is to be stopped, if the plans are not to
be carried out by adequate appropria
tions then the local taxes ought to be
reduced.
"We are confident there will be no
hasty, unjust or unwise action in the
Senate. We are grateful to all the mem
bers who spoke and voted against the
rider in the House.
"A meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Committee of One Hundred will
be held at an early date."
