STANNARD'S PLUNGE

N THE march
toward Gettys
burg Lee's veter
ans were told
by way of en
couragement that
they wonld meet
no other enemy
on northern soil
than despicable
Yankee .home
guards or raw
militia. Greatly
to their dismay,
their first heavy
enoonnter in
M a o P h e r son's
woods, where the
battle opened on July 1, was with Mere
dith's Iron Brigade. "This ain't no mi
litia. It's the army of the Potomac 1"
they exclaimed on discovering the mis
take. Two days later on the slopes of
Cemetery Ridge a band of 2,000 gen
uine Yankee militiamen turned what
until that moment seemed a doubtful or
a drawn battle into a Confederate Wa
terloo. These novices who "fought so
well" were Green mountain boys, con
stituting three regiments in the Second
Vermont brigade, led by General George
J. Stannard.
The Second Vermont brigade origi
nated in the precautionary measures of
the governor of Vermont. During the
battles of 1862 he placed the militia of
the state upon a war footing to be ready,
as he said, for the next call for troops.
It came in October, and 60 companies
banded together, forming five regi
ments the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Four
teenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth militia.
They swore in for nine months' service
and on reaching Washington entered
the reserve corps for the protection of
the capital. There the brigade remain
ed all winter, and when Hooker's cam
paign opened in the Rappahannock in
the spring of 1863 was detailed to guard
the railroad between Alexandria to the
army base at Falmouth. About that
time Colonel George J. Stannard of the
Ninth Vermont volunteers (First Ver
mont brigade) received a general's com
mission and assumed command of the
Second brigade. So conspicuous had
bis services been with the old fighting
Vermonters that when the news from
Gettysburg revealed him as the hero of
Cemetery Ridge it created no surprise
in the army. Not so, however, with the
previously unheard of "Stannard Ver
mont militia," or Second Vermont bri
gade. When the army of the Potomac
marched northward along the Orange
and Alexandria road to keep between
Lee, who moved west of the Blue Ridge,
and Washington, Stannard received or
ders to hold on to the railroad line un
til the entire column had passed, then
follow and report with his brigade to
General Reynolds for duty in the First
corps, but he did not como up with that
column until after the battle of July 1
and the death of Reynolds. The brigade
marched 120 miles in six days, reaching
Emmlttsburg June 80.
That evening Reynolds sent a message
to Stannard complimenting the Ver
monters on their splendid march and
saying that he would be glad when they
joined his ranks, for he was likely to
need all the help he could get, but on
"BOTS, HEBE THEY COME!"
resuming the march the morning of
July 1 orders arrived at Emmittsburg
from corps headquarters detaohing two
Vermont regiments to guard the corps
wagon train. The Twelfth and Fif
teenth regiments were accordingly left
behind, and Stannard hurried forward
with the remaining three, about 2,000
muskets, reaching Cemetery Ridge late
on the 1st and just as the broken First
corps assembled there after its terrible
battle and defeat on the ridges west of
the town.
General Sickles, with the advance of
the Third corps, and General Slocum,
with the Twelfth, reached the spot about
that time. General Doubleday succeed
ed Reynolds in command of the First,
and each of the three Doubleday,
Sickles and Slocum claimed control
over the Vermonters, and they marched
and countermarched from one bivouac
to another until finally it was decided
that the brigade should take its place
In Sickles' line.
On the morning of July 2 the brigade
joined the ranks of the First corps on
East Cemeteiy HilL The men imme
diately epread out their cartridges,
which had become dampened by rain
during the night, to dry in the sun, and
General Doubleday, who rode along the
line while they were so engaged, ex
claimed, "Here are some boys that will
fight when their turn comes. " Their
turn did come in a few hours, for
toward the close of the battle on
Sickles' field, when his corps drifted
toward the ridge In shattered ranks, the
Confederates assaulted Hancock's Sec
ond corps line-between Sickles' position
and the crest where the Vermonters lay.
Hancock led forward some of his own
men, but not enough to stay the rush
of Confederates, and General Meade in
person xode to the First corps for help.
Stannard s fresh ranks met his eye,
and calling them to follow he led the
way to the post of danger. . The Four
teenth was at the head of the line and
responded with a will, hurling back a
brigade of Confederates who. were
charging a Union battery.' The Six
teenth followed at double quick and
saved the next battery in nick o' time.
When the Thirteenth reached the scene,
Hancock was himself returning along
the ridge in search of more aid to rescue
Weir's regular battery from a regiment
of Georgians, who were almost upon the
guns. "Can't you save that battery,
colonel?" Hancock exclaimed to the
commander of the Thirteenth. :
"We can try. Forward, boys!" was
the response. The Vermonters drove the
Georgians out of the battery and chased
them across the Emmittsburg road. Two
Confederate guns in the road then open
ed on the -Thirteenth, but they were
promptly charged upon and captured by
the company nearest them.
At dark Stannard gathered up his
scat"-"' 1 j p -' teists and stationed theia
on the froutTIine cX Cemetery Ridge "be
tween Gibbon's and Caldwell's divisions
of Hancock's corps. In other words,
they halted at the first gap met within
the line which Meade and Hancock were
rearranging on the ridge in anticipation
of the morrow, a mere accident, because
the rightful place of the brigade was in
the First corps line on Cemetery Hill,
farther north. And -where it had acci
dentally halted it remained for 26 hours,
or until the close of the battle.
The Vermonters lay exposed to the
artillery fire which introduced Pickett's
charge. Union batteries all around them
were demolished by their fearful hurri
cane of missiles, but not until their
guns had given response in kind, and
throughout that two hours' terrific can
nonade" those hardy, healthy, but phys
ically exhausted mountaineers from the
classic green hills lay on their arms sound
asleep. Suddenly the pickets and wake
ful outlooks, watching the mysterious
fringe of woods beyond Codori's mead
ows and the Emmittsburg road, cried
out, "Boys, here they cornel" Then all
sprang into line and stood idly and si
lently reviewing the magnificent spec
tacle, 1 5, 000 shimmering bayonets mark
ing the long gray lines advancing at
quick step. The right flank of Pickett's
own division of Virginians marched
squarely upon the Vermont brigade.
Stannard told his colonels to have the
men hold their fire until the enemy was
close up, then give one volley and finish
it with the bayonet. As the Fourteenth
regiment, the first in line, arose to de
liver its fire the Confederate ranks faced
left and marched obliquely across the
front of the brigade until they cleared
it, then fronted and rushed upon Han
cock's brigades at the "Bloody Angle,"
Copse of Trees and Stone WalL Mean
while the Fourteenth opened fire, fol
lowed by the Sixteenth, which lay on
its right flank, and was passed in turn
by the enemy's files. A long line of
Confederate dead and wounded marked
the course of the fated column on the
front of the Vermont brigade. True,
the Virginians avoided the Vermonters'.
bayonets, but Stannard was not to be
defrauded of opportunity. 4 The instant
he saw the front facing and forward
step of Pickett's men he ordered the
Thirteenth and Sixteenth regiments to
assail them squarely on the flank. Both
moved promptly in columns of four,
then changed front forward, swinging
into a line at right angles with Pickett's,
which was several ranks deep and not
above a dozen rods from the muzzles of
the Vermont rifles.
At that deadly range the Thirteenth
fired 10 or 12 rounds to a man, the Six
teenth half the number. The effect was
instantaneous, and Pickett's march
ceaeed. At first the men in gray drew
off from the flank fire, crowding to
gether until the once orderly ranks be
came a mob. Then hundreds threw
down their arms in surrender. Some of,
the Virginians, who were Qarnett's
men, faced to the right and stood at
bay, crossing bayonets with the. Ver
monters, while the front ranks, led by
Garnett on horseback, struggled for-;
ward to the stone walL But the eu-j
preme blow had been given, and the
charge of Pickett's own division was a
thing of the past.
Yet Stannard 's work was not over. ;
While he was directing the flank attack
by the Thirteenth and Sixteenth, Han
cock rode to the spot, and receiving a
wound which disabled him was helped
from his horse by Stannard and one of
his staff. Stannard cut the clothing
from the wound and bound his handker
chief above it to stop the flow of blood.
Turning around to look to his troops,
he saw a fresh body of Confederates
marching gallantly up the slope to tho
right of the Fourteenth, which all the
time had remained in the advanced po
sition where Pickett encountered it The
Thirteenth and Sixteenth meanwhile
had been ordered to resume their places
near the Fourteenth.
Tho new enemy proved to be a Florida
and Alabama brigade led by General
Wilcox as a support to Pickett They
had started late and not kept touch with
Pickett's column. The Sixteenth Ver
mont promptly advanced down the slope,
and changing front poured its fire into
the flank of Wilcox. Four companies of
the Fourteenth joined the Sixteenth, and
the .istonished enemy went flying back
to tl-.e Emmittsburg road, leaving three
flags and hundreds of prisoners in the
hands of the Vermonters. To cover
Wilcox's retreat the Confederate artil
lery hurled a shower of grape and shell
into Stannard's ranks, and, as though
to wreak a late revenge, a shrapnel ball
entered the hero's thigh, Imbedding it
self deep in the muscles.
With Gettysburg the Vermont mili
tia passed into history and also out of
It The nine months' term soon expired,
and the regiments disbanded.

AN EXTRAORDINARY CRIME.
Bow a Man Pemiaded a Woman to JLel
Mlm Banff Her.
It Is doubtful if the annals of crime fur
nish a parallel to the murder recently com
mitted at Vlroqua, Wis. Mary Jonas was
found hanging In her house under circum
stances that looked like murder. Samuel
Duxton, a married man, was suspected
itfid finally confessed that he obtained con
trol of the woman by making her believe
that he possessed powers of witchcraft,
and also through promises that he would
marry her as soon as he got rid of bis wife.
He made the woman beliove that if she
should hang herself until she was appar
ently dead the spirit would produce the
lame effect on his wife, with the exception
that it would kill his wife, while it would
have practically no effect on his victim.
As she was anxious ro have Mrs. Buxton
dead, so that they could bo married, sho
readily consented to this means of killing
Mrs. Buxton.
One day, Buxton said, he called at the
house of the Jonas woman for the purposo
of carrying out this plao. A rope was tied
to the rafter and around the woman's
neck. Then his heart failed him, and be
let her down and left the house. Ho re
turned again the next Sunday and told
the woman that when he vraa hanged It
almost killed his wife, and ' that if they
would try again and he would let her hang
longer it would be sure to kill hi3 wife.
The woman consented to the trial.
They went up stairs. The rope was
fastened around the rafter and then around
the woman's neck while she stood on a
chair. Then he pushed her off the chair
and held her down until she died. He
then took what money he found In the
dead woman's pocket book and left the
house.
Buxton was arraigned, pleaded guilty
to the charge of murder and was at once
sentenced to prison for life. -
There seems to be a slight tendency
toward double skirts, and that the chief
ornamentations will not remain on the
bodices, for more trimmings of various
kinds are finding their way on skirts.
. .. It has been formally decreed by the
presiding genius of our dress destinies
that the skirts shall be buttoned down
one side. Under this new regime, no
longer is it necessary to endure that
painful parting of skirt from bodice
which disgraced so many of the fairest
costumes in summer. T:
Almost as popular as accordion plait
ing is the prevailing craze for a laoe
collar. In fine lace, in -coarse lace, in
points and in squares, in a combination
of net with an applique of lace, made
to wear with a high r bodice or a low
bodice, you may see the lace collar in
all its pleasing varieties. Guipure,
duchess and point de Venise are per
haps the most popular kids.
- HINT3 ON TEACHING MUSIC. "
Instruct Children to Read Music as They
Bead Their, Primers Sins Every Tone.
The point about care in the very first
instruction cannot be too strongly em
phasized, and that every parent should
expect his child to lay first a good,
solid, scientific foundation in technique.
If children were brought up to read
musio as they read their primers and
were kept at the pianos as a duty, as
the little Germans are, instead of mak
ing practice optional with the child, we
should have a very different musical
standard in this country.
In some cities the public schools are
making a start in the right direction,
and if a suitable and practical system
comes into general use the next genera
tion will be much more musical than
the one now rising. Canadian Musician
writes:
I have recently visited schools where
children of 8 were carrying two part
harmony reading at sight, and doing
it accurately too. This, of course, is all
vocal music, but that is so essential to
any sort of instrumental music that, if
possible, I would teach all my pupils to
sing before they- played a note, and
then, combining the two, they should
sing every tune they learned to play.
Unfortunately, as yet, people are not
willing to wait for all that, so we have
to begin in the middle and work both
ways, with infinitely more pains to
teacher and scholar.
The practice of learning good music
by heart is commendable, but it may be
carried too far. For instance, I know a
young girl who commits everything she
learns, even to etudes and Bach fugues.
As she is studying all the time, she nat
urally cannot keep them all in practice,
and so it is only a few of her latest at
tempts that she ever oan play, while tho
habit of playing without her notes so
constantly makes her a very indifferent
reader, so that she scarcely can manage
anything not recently committed.
I think it should be considered a part
of a liberal education to know the theory
of musio as thoroughly as any other
branch of science and the history of it
as well as ancient history, or the history
of art, even if one never practices
enough to become a performer. This is
really the least noticed of any of the de
partments of music. Some may think it
enough merely to execute without know
ing anything about it, but it should be
reversed. Everybody should know and
should play on some instrument aa
much as is necessary to that knowledge,
and then the few should execute in a
manner to delight such an intelligent
public.
Fur Trimmed Garments.
Numbered with the early importations
of fur garments are two outside wraps
that are likely to be extremely popular
during the winter of 1894-5 namely,
LONG COAT FTJB TRIMMED JACKET.
the long cloak of faced cloth, with cuffs,
revers and fringes of fur, and the fur
trimmed jacket.
A navy blue cloth long coat seen was
trimmed with Canadian sable. A styl
ish jacket in blue cloth and lined with
brocade was trimmed with cuffs, revers
and facings of dark Russian sable. It
was also braided with black in military
fashion.
A CHICAGO SENSATION.
Second Vice President Wickes of the Pall
man Company Sued For Divorce
The action for absolute divorce of Laura
U. Wickes against her husband, Thomas
H. Wickes, has created quite a sensation
In the social circles of Chicago and St.
Louis, where both the parties are very
wall known. Mr. Wickes is the second
vice president of the Pullman company

MR. AND MBS. WICKES.
and came into prominence during the big
strike last summer as the spokesman of
the company in the conferences looking to
a settlement of the troubles.
Service, in the divorce proceedings has
been secured upon Mr. Wickes, and unless
the defendant contests the suit the matter
will be placed upon Judge Tuthill's de
fault divorce calendar and tried about
Doc. 1.
Mrs. Wlokps was married March 13,
1871, in St. Louis. Mr. Wickes was at
that time living in East St. Louis. He
moved to Chicago not long afterward and
became interested in the corporation of
which he is now the third officer. Tho
family residence has been at 3647 Grand
boulevard for the last ten- years, and the
defendant is now living at that number.
Mrs. Wickes' bill, however, sets out that,
owing to her husbacd's cruelty, she ceased
to live with bun Au. 16, 1893.
The charge ns recited in tho bill la that
the defendant has been guilty of extreme
and repeated cruelty to the complainant
and at various times since their marriage
has beaten, struck, kicked and otherwise
cruelly abused her and has used vile, abu
sive and opprobrious language toward her,
with the result that her life has been ren
dered miserable. -
The extent of Mr. Wickes' real estate
holdings is estimated in the bill at $50,
000. Mrs. Wickes declares that he Is the
owner of personal property consisting of
stocks and bonds the value of which is
unknown to her. She avers that from his
Income and property he is abundantly able
to support her and her children, she now
being destitute of means.
The children of the marriage are Mrs.
Laura Annette Walker, 28 years old; Thom
as H. Wickes, Jr., 19 years old, and .Flor
ence L. Wickes, 19. years old. The son is
engaged In the laundry business at 213
Thirty-first street. -. Mrs. Wickes asks for
the sole care and custody of the children.
Demand For ssasslns Daggers.
Since the assassination of M. Carnot the
Cutler at Cette who sold the dagger to the
murderer has, it is said, been inundated
with orders for weapons of similar pattern
and size to that used on the fatal night at
Lyons. The orders come from France and
from abroad, somebody in Brussels having
asked for 800 daggers. During, the last
month the cutler has dispatched over 1,000
of these articles to various places.

POISONED HER FIVE CHILDREN.
Sirs. Albert! Gave Them Morphine in
Wine and Four are Dead.
Galveston, Texas, Dec. Mrs.
Louis Alberti, wife of a well-known
butcher. was arrested Wedaesday
morning at 2 o'clock at the instanceof
her relatives, on the charge of insani
ty. Her arrest is the result of the
poison ii.g of her five children by her
hand. Four of the children are dead.
The fifth, a girl of sixteen years, may
recover.
Mrs. Alberti called her children in
to the room at about 6:30 o'clock
Tuesday evening and gave them some
wine. While doing so Mr. Alberti
st epped in from his butcher shop and
asked her what she was doing. She
replied that she was giving the chil
dren some wine, and asked him if he
wanted seme. He replied in the af
firmative and she immediately chang
ed the bottle and glass and gave him
other wine. Mr. Alberti noticed this
but paid no attention to the matter,
at the time, and when one of thecbil
dren said that their mother' had put
poison in the wine, he said that the
wine was all right and went back to
the butcher shop.
After the father had gone out the
same child told its mother that she
had poisoned them, but she denied it,
and pushed the children away from
her and told them to go to bed. They
started to obey, but they were attack
ed with stupor. The mother then ac
knowledged that she had put mor
phine in the wine, as she wanted to
kill the children and herself. Her
husband's entrance had prevented her
from taking any of the poisoned wine.
Legislation Proposed by Fusion 1st s. ,
From the Wilmington Messenger.
Soon after the sweeping success of
the "holy alliance" there was some
talk of much moderation in legisla
tion that no drastic measures
would be adopted. The Messenger
was fjlad to note this conservative
intimation of purpose, and said give
them a trial, a chance.
But in a fortnight or so after the
success of the most foul conspiracy
against the people was announced
the wild talk begins, and the people
are told in advance what sort oi
changes may be attempted and made
successful. It is a fine bill of abomi
nations a regular "barmecide
feast," as Thackeray calls it to
which the people are invited. Let us
state the wondrous legislation al
ready given out as possible, as even
probable :
1. Repeal of County Government.
2. Changing the charters of Wil
mington and other cities to give the
negroes control.
3. Repeal of election'laws.
4. Cutting down or abolition of
the State Guard.
5. Abolition of Railroad Commis
sion or a change of officials therein
by a legislative trick.
6. Repeal or radical chaDge in the
Agricultural Department.
7. Material change in other State
institutions that will cripple them
and lessen their usefulness and im
portance. 8. Election of magistrates by the
people. Wilmington will be finely
served then, as was the case in the
way bai-k.
9. School committeemen to be
elected by the people.
10. Repeal of Stnt ?Sd to the ven
erable and most uteiul L'uieibity of
North Carolina.
11. Probable abolition of the Pen
itentiary. 12. Changes in all officials in the
Public institutions wherever it can
be done.
13. A new legal code to be the
woi k, c f course, of Radical lawyere(?)
14. Abolition of County Superin
tendents of 1'ublic Instruction.
15. Abolition of County Boards of
Education.

President Cleveland has once more

in Congress will have the good sense
to follow in the line he indicates.
New York Sun.
There is nothing unexpectedly or
striking in the message which Mr.
Cleveland sent to Congress yester
day. The important paragraphs
might be printed in three quarters
of a column. The sentences which
are obviously of the President's own
composition would occupy much lea
space than that.
Charlotte Observer.
This document, which accompanies
this morning's paper, is conspicuous
for nothing so much as its extreme
dullness. Mr. Cleveland's gout doubt
less exercised its influence upon it.
for it lacks the originality and
virility which have distinguished all
of his public papers heretofore.

Cleveland to Congress is a long and
highly-interesting one. He touches
upon every subject that could be
expected to receive notice at his
hands, reserving for the conclusion
of his message what he had to say
on the subject of the tariff aad the
banking system.
New York Times.
President Cleveland's message is
long and could hardly have been
otherwise. It is .tedious, as State
papers usually are. It is important
where it trenches on the questions of
the currency, and the tariff on sugar
and free raw materials. In other
respects it is purely formal. It is
characteristic of him in its boldness,
in its devotion to the principle of
tariff reform, and most unhappily,
in its complete acquiescence in these
principles of monetary science
preached in bank parlors and prac
ticed for the profit of bankers."
