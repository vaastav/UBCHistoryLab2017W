Tne Newsroyk' Home The managers of the
. Newsboys' Home have issued a circular, stating that
they have purchased the houses No. 913 ami MB
liOctiRt street, ami are now ready to open the Insti
tution for the reception of Inmates. The circu
lar mates that there arc many boys in our large city
who, through loss of parents or other causes, are
left without suitable homes, and with no one to care
for them, ami are thus exposed to many tempta
tions. These hovs falllaliiinst necessarily Into vagrant
habits, and u lurge number of them become idle,
thriftless, and profligate men. furnishing continual
recruits to the ranks of those human beings who
are a burden any a curse to the community in which
they live. Willi this evil this association proposes to
deal, by providing for newsboys, and others who are
onirics, a comlortdble and well-regulated dwell
ing place, where they will be brought under good
lnlliiciic.es, and so trained and instructed as to fit
them for a better and more useful life. The Institu
tion is fitted up with school-rooms, and all otner re
quisites for a comfortable home. It is not proposed,
however, to inane it an entirely gratuitous one,
thinking It better to encourage a feeling of Inde
pendence and a self-respect In the boys by requiring
a small payment from them for ineaU and lodging,
which will also aid Home what in dftfrayliigthc neces
sary expenses. As the receipts from this source,

Prom the annual report of the lion. James Pollock,
the Director of the United States Mint, which, under
Ihe date of September 119, has Just been submitted to
fceeretary Boutwell, we take Interesting extracts:
The operations lor the year ending June 80, lust,
were as follows:
The deposits of bullion at the Mint and Branches
during the fiscal year were as follows: Gold,
131,4.,249 7; silver. $l,7uo,4&3 49: total deposit!,
From this total a deduction must bo made for the
bnlllon redenositcd, or bars made at one branch of
the Mint and rcdeposlteds in another for solnage.
Deducting the rcdenoslts, the amount will be
$:is,4o,arH0O.
The coinage for the same period was as follows;
(told coin, pieces, 1,181,802: value, t2l,R2s,fi37o; un
psrtcd and fine gold bnrs, tin,iM),uiH-t3; silver coin,
pieces, l,702,lfl; value, $840,741! -60; silver bars,
$734 tiio-07; nickel-copper and bronze coinage, piece,
43,7K2,7M); value, $l,27,orrfOO. Total number ol
pieces struck, 07,6iO,GG; total value of coinage,
:4,HHl,9fW-20.
The distribution of the bullion received at the
Mint and branches was as follows:
At Philadelphia, gold deposited, $3,(iSi.coo-R4; gold
rolned, $:t,17H,e;i7 fio; fine gold bars, $1:10,141-91 ; all
ver deposited and purchased, $vs.R40-8!t; Bllvcr
coined, $4:t4,746T0; Bllver bars, $.2.090'19 ; nickel-copper
and bronze coinage, value, $l,'i79,nri5m Total
deposits of gold and silver, t4,ls5,miii.H; total coin
age, $Ml4,67Hi8; total number of pieces, 84,6ti0,lflS.
At the Branch Mint, Sail Kranclsco, the gold depo
sits were $17,717,ita;i-8i ; gold coined, $I8,-.0,000'00;
sliver deposits and purchases, $fio2,844-74; silver
coined, f40,000-00. Total deposits and purchases,
$IH,0fil,7in-of; total coinage, $19,06ti,OO0-00; total
number of pieces, 2,00('i,WK.

year in gold bullion, $,2ti.10s-n:!: silver bullion, in
cluding purchases, $s7'.),4:!9-23. Total value received,

At the Branch Miut, Denver, Colorado, the depo
sits for imparted bars were, gold, $;95,MMVaM: silver,
$.-4,S28 C3; total deposits, $.SNI,b9n-0l. The deposits
utihis ttranch for te fiscal vear ending Juno no.
Iwih, were $1103,017 7; showing an luorca)o of
$4H7,a77-2:i.
Prior to and since the recent Act of Congress
chancing this Branch from a Mint to an Assay inline,
It has been engaged in melting, assaying and stamp
ing gold and silver bullion, returning the sum to
the depositors In the form of imparted bars, bearing
(he Uovcrtmient stump of weight, and Oneness. As
an Assay Olllce it will meet all the demands or the
miner, and promote us -Mcctually the mining inte
rests of the region as a Mint tor coiiuge could pos
sibly do.
At the Branch Mint, Charlotte, North Carolina,
the deposits have been very limited, but are lucreas
ing. It is now In operation as an Asuy Office ; de
posits being received, assayed, and returned to de
positors In the form of imparted bars. The deposits
lor imparted bars were, gold, $3io-40.
The Branch Mints at Dahlenega, Oeorgla, and at
New Orleani, Louisiana, nave not been in operation
since the close of the Kebellion. No necessity now
exists for their continuance, either in Assay Offices
or as Branch Mints.
The Branch Mint at Ciiiaon City. N'cvuda. Is rap
Idly approaching completion. The machinery is
nearly all In plate, and operations will soon be com
menied. Orders were Issued to complete and put
In operation as promptly as possible the Assay De
partment. This will tie done. The superintendent
of this Branch reports that, they will bo ready to
open early In September; and this will probably bo
the case so far as the general operations are con
cerned ; but the uiore complicated details iu refer
ence to the furnaces, assay apparatus, et-., will re
quire some weeks longer.
Krom the peculiar character of the bullion that
will be deposited for flue bars or coiuage, the ope
rative vlllcers of this branch should In; practical,
experienced, and Kcientiilc men. The deposits will
be gcnei ally of mixed bullion, with a gold fine
ness of two ami one-ball to forty-lhoiiHatniilis; silver,
940 to li'lO, and a small per ceutugc of base metals,
etc. This bullion, whether deposited for flue birs
or coinage, must be refined, or refined and parted,
according to the condition of the deposit. It does
not seem likely that much, if any, purring will be
done at Carson. Tin; bars of mlxe I bullion being
otllciaily stumped with both gold and silver propor
tions, will bu as salable in that form as If tUcy were
parted.
I regret that I am not able to report progress In
the erection of tin: new Branch Mint building at San
Francisco. It should be commenced at once and
prosecuted, without; further delay, to final com
pletion. The redemption of nickel-copper cents was con
tinued during the Uscul jetr, payment being madu
therefor ill the three and live cent nickel coins. The
amount thus redeemed was. In pounds, 103..W6;
value, $1ul,4CV25. The redemption for the year
ending June 30, 1bV8. n im in value f i(i0.4S2'04 a de
crease of aboflt one hundred and fifty per centum.
This marked decrease indicates that the redundancy
of these small coins has been greatly diminished ;
and that the amount now outstanding or tne one
and two-cent pieces was but little. If any, in excess
of the actual demand for them. Existing laws pro
vide for the redemption of tho three and five-cent
nickel-copper coins. No consideration of public ln
terest or private convenience demaudB the redemp
tion of the bronze one ami two-cent pieces, or the
substitution of a nickel one-cent piece for the bronze
coin (d that denomination.
I cannot concur in the recommendation of my pre-

But while the law stands as it is' R!Lr' Pei it

see when we shall have the pleasure of pS,ina and
receiving silver. There is no legitimate reasJ. hT
the premium on gold should exceed ten per centu-c
nor why specie payments could not be safely re
sumed in three months from this date. The people
have confidence iu their Government., and have
patriotism enough to sustain and defend its credit.
It is not very easy to find a precedent, If we
needed one, for Bucn a policy as la indicated, for
few nations liuve been brought to such a pass. We
may mention one, however, which Is Austria. That
country, like the United States, has for the past
right years been using paper money, almost down
to the last kreutzer. The Government is now re
placing it with a silver currency at a reduction of
real va'ue. No doubt the people are greatly pleased
with the change.
France, Italy, Dolgiura, and Switzerland have alte
lately reduced their le.sscr silver coins. This they
did, not to get rid of paper, to which they had not
been driven, but because the relative value of silver
had Increased, bo that they must either take that
course or do without silver change. Ami while they
were doing that they wisely reduced the intrinsic
value considerably below the market rate for silver
bullion, bo as to be reasonably out of the reach of
fluctuations, and not have to do the thing over again
upon a lower basis.

and abetting such removals, in violutiou of tan act
of Congress of lHtw. The testimony went to show
that in August last tho revenue olllcers were visit
ing the dibtillery, and detrctlug lrrcgtilari'les In its
management, had in view Its seiy.urd; but in the
meantime, notwithstanding the strict surveilance of
the officers, a large quantity of grain and a number
of barrels of whisky were el'uiidimtluely removed. To
prevent their seizure, and for the purpose of facili
tating this removal, Mountjoy bribed the Govern
ment watchman to go riding with him, and leave
the distillery to his (Mount joy's) conferdeates.
These allegations were denied by the defense, who
oflered to prove that the grain was taken away be
cause It was becoming heated aud damaged tit the
distillery, and would havo been returned If the oill
cers had said thfy desired It, and that the whisky
which was taken was beyond his control, being in
the custody of the United States, and the removal
was without his knowledge or connivance.
The case is yet ou trial.

to thank him for the recommendation In his message
concerning that Commonwealth. The Senators made
brief addresses to this effect; also expressing the
hope that the people of Virginia would in the future
ss now have his support and approbation. The
President returned thanks for the compliment, and
trusted the conduct of the Stato would fully Justify
him ln his recommendation for her restoration to all
the rights and privileges conferred on members of
tho Union.
After the presentation sf the delegation to the
President they requested that Judge Alexander
Klves be appointed District Judge, under the new

Wasunotok, Deo. 7. Mr. Morton introduced a re

her normal relations to the United States Union and
entitled to representation ln Congress.
sir. Sumner (Mass.), introduced a bill to amend
the Hanking act aud to promote the return to specie
payments. It repeals tbe limitation of the amount
of Dational bank notes and prevents the Secretary of
the Treasury to lssao additional notes, equal in
omouiit to the greenbacks retired, bnt not to exceed
flitv millions yearly.
Mr. Trumbull (111.) Introduced a bin making it a
misdemeanor for a member of Congress to recom
mend any person for ofllcs, unless requested by tho
President or a head of department, and supported
It at length.
Mr. Trumbnll was followed by Mr. Davis, who re
ferred to luiiiTiduui onses in which official Incum
bents In the Keuenue service had been deprived of
positions to which they were entitled by the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue. The bill was then
laid over and the Senate adjourned.
Ilouae.
Wafdinoton, Dec. 7. Immediately after the read
ing of the Journal, on motion of Mr. fscheuck, ihe
House resolved itself Into Committee of the Whole
on the State of tho Union, Mr. Ferry In the chair, for
the purpose of distributing the President's message
among tho several committees.
The usual resolutions making such distribution
were then oflered by Mr. Schenck.
The resolutions having been read, Mr. Schenck
said that If any member deBlred to discuss them he
would yield the floor for that purpose, but he would
prefer to have all the resolutions reported to the
House, and agreed to without any general debate at
this time.
Mr. Cox Inquired whether, In those resolutions,
the Committee of Ways aud Means was to take
charge of the matters connected with the resump
tion of specie payments, referred to in the message,
or whether the Committee on Hanking and Currency
was to take charge of It?
Mr. Schenck replied that there was no special
reference made to tho Biibject In the resolutions. It
seems to occupy a sort of debatable ground be
tween the two committees. Legislation in relation
to the public credit, to the bonds, to the securities,
might or might not involve along with It, and pro
bubly would, some reference to the means by which
specie payments might be approached. Ho
had supposed that without entering on a do
bate on a debatable ground of that
kind, It would be better to leave the two committees
to endeavor by communicating with each other to
dispose of that subject with some degree of unani
mity of action between themselves. It might be
(hat the House might think prober to raise
another committeo on the subject, but he hoped
that that would not be considered necessary. Tho
subject connected Itself with the operation of the
business and the duties of both committees.

Mr. Wood desired to have read the renointim. in

Tho resolution was read ,as loiiows:

lttieroceaulc canal, to the regulation of passenger
ships, an 1 to the protection of passengers, be re.
lerreu iu inri vuiiiiimiuto uu oiuiiieree.
Mr. Wood suggested that the subject of the Inter.
oceanic caivil should be refe. roil to the Committee
on foreign Auans, as it involved the question of a
treaty.
air. fenencit saui rnar in nrenar nsr that resolution
It was a suliject of some tliongnt as to what commit-
tefftliat particular nui'stionsiinuld bo. As the mat
ter of a canal across the Isthmus ol Darten was
purely a mutter of great commercial Interest, It had
been thought better toasslgn 1', to tho Committee on
commerce.
Mr. Lynch suggested that that part of the Presi
dent's message referring to navigation interests be
longed propel ly to a select committee ou that sub
ject,
Mr. Schenck said he had two reasons forprefer-
rlnir its rferenc.H tn the Commltten nn Ciinim...
first, because that was a standing committee ani
preference was usually and properly given to such
committee; and second, because he understood a
select committee to have been created for the pur-
Eose of looking Into the causes of the decline of ship
ulidliig and navigation.
Mr. Wood Inquired whether Congress could begin
lo consider the question of the iiiteroceanlc canal
until there was a treaty made, aud whether tbe
Committeo on Foreign Affairs was not the proper
committee for the consideration of a question of that
character.
Mr. Hclienek supposed Congress might consider
the subject before any additional treaty stipulations
were entered Into other than those now existing.
There was now a suitlcient understanding and
agreement between the Government of the United
States und the conntrlvs on the Isthmus for the au
thorities of this Government to Bi'nd out a survey
ing party, which ha 1 already sailed, or was about to
Sill.
Mr. Wood said he understood. that there was ait
agreement so far as a survey was concerned, but
there was no concession of a right of way.
Mr. O'Neill expressed the opinion that all the sub
jects embraced lu the resolution came within the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Commerce, and
that lu fact the functlnasof the special committee on
navigation Interests were eaded or should be. Taere
hail been no necessity for the creatlou of that com
mittee In the first Instance, th Committee on Com
merce being ready aud aaxlous at -all times to per
form Its duty.
Mr. Lynch replied that the special committee had
been oreated with the assent of most of the members
of the Committee on Commerce, and that by the
terms of tbe resolution It was not required to report
before the second Monday In January.
He moved tbe reference to that special committee
of that portlou of the President's message relating
to navigation.
The motion was rejected.
Mr. Jones (Ky.) Inquired of Mr. Schenck whether
the snbject of the recognition of bePtgcrent rights
to the Cuban patriots had been specially referred.
Mr. Schenck replied that It went with all matters
rcluting to foreign afialrs to the Committee on
Foreign Affairs. He knew of no other committee to
which it would be properly referred.
Tho committee rose and the resolutions were re
ported to the House and were adopted.
Mr. Dawes Introduced a bill to reorganize th
Treasury Department and fix tho pay of its officers,
remarking that he did not consider himself commit
ted to its provisions, but introduced it at the request
of others. Kcferred to tho Committee on Appropria
tions. Mr. Bntler (Mass.) Introduced a bill to repeal th
Tenure-of-Ofilce act. Iteferred to tho Judiciary
