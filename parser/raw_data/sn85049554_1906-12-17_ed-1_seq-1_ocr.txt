regulations now in. force in many cases
may be extended to all.
The legislation he recommends is in
line with the proposal to allow tihe rail
roads to consolidate their holdings of
•timber within the. forest reserves by
exchange, after deeding their lands to
•the government.
The president recommends that the
secretary of the treasury be authorized
to advance to t&e forest service, upon
security of t'he standing timber, an
amount, say $5,000,000, sufficient to
provide for a reasonable working cap
ital for the national forests, to bear

installments beginning in ten years.
The 'transfer of national paries from
the charge of the secretarytof the in
terior to the seci-etary of agriculture
is recommended.
The power to create national forests
by proclamation is said to be extended
to Indian lands, the Indians to be paid

NAVAL PERSONNEL BILL.
President's Proposed Plan'of Promotion
Will Mean Great Saving.
Washington, Dei. 17.—The president
sent a message to congress tbday
earnestly recommending early consid-
serving seven years in the grade of
captain and eeven years in the grade of
'rear admiral, thus enabling them to be
come thoroughly skilled and efficient in
these grades. The bill also establishes
the grade of vice admiral. On occa
sions of official importance, of inter
national council, or of combined' naval
action, the interests of this great na
tion demand that our naval representa
tives shall rank an the equal of naval
representatives of other powers.
The president says that if the pro
posed plan of promotion is carried out,
It will, as compared with the existing
law, make a savirg of more than $5.
000,000 during the next seven years.
The principal pari: of this saving will
be made by stopping the involuntary
retirement of young lientenant com
manders with the rank and pay of
commanders, upon the retired list.
The president if: firmly of the opin
ion that unless tt.e present conditions
•f the higher commissioned personnel
are rectified by judicious legislation,
the future of our navy will be greatly
compromised.
BAILEY'S PHILIPPIC RECOILS.
Senator Accentuates His Opposition
by Demand.
Fort Worth, Tex., Dec. 17.—Senator
Bailey- by no means has turned the
edge of oonai? tion to his re-election by
his Jet :ii' Lions in a speech last night
in San Antonio that legislators in
structed ts vote lor him should do so
or resign. According to those wh are
considered politically wise, the ouclook
for the senator's success next month
is darker than at any time since the
outcry began against"him.
In interviews Bailey bears down
hard on the sacred trust imposed by
instructions but his opponents retort by
pointing out that "sacred trusts" were
imposed on Bailey and then refer to his
Standard Oil dealings.
When Bailey's enemies opened up on
his Standard Oil record several weeks
ago his friends scouted the idea that
opposition worthy of note could be
made in the legislature. A week ago
the same men admitted that perhaps
four legislators would cast their vote
against Bailey. But it is admitted in
the Bailey camp that twelve men will
vote for some t)ther than the incumbent
when the legislature goes to choose a
senator.
To these twelve must be added many
whose opposition to Bailey Is pro
nounced but who have refrained from
talking to newspaper men, and others
who before the legislature meets un
doubtedly will be, instructed to cast
their votes for a new deal.
Governor-elect Campbell, of Pales
tine Attorney^ General Davidson and
Joseph D. Sayers, of Austin, former
governor Judge Charles K. Bell, of
Fort Worth Horace Chilton, Yancey
Lewis and M. M. Crane, of Dallas, are
most frequently mentioned as opposing
•the senator who has to answer for
farms, and trotting horses.
The senator professes no fear, th.o
the opposition predicts certain defeat.
The chief weakness of the opposition
is lack of organization. Perhaps half

Special to Time -Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 17.—Now that it
is announced -that the distribution of
Iowa federal patronage at Washington
will not be made until Senator Alli
son returns there, some of the Wash
ington correspondents of Iowa stand
pat papers are just waking up to the
fact that it Is time for rearrangement
of the federal jobs. From one of these
startling npws is gleaned that the only
opponent which George Christian has
for marshal in the southern: district is
one "Hinshaw," tho it has been well
known that there have been, at least
three avowed candidates for the place
the past two years. It Is also entirely
probable that John Ledgerwood, of De
catur county, may be a candidate for
marshal in case that place goes to the
Eighth district. It has just been re
vealed at Washington that H. G. Mc
Millan of Cedar Rapids, is a candidate
for attorney to succeed himself. It had
been stated here repeatedly, and by
members of the delegation^ that Mr.
McMillan is not seeking reappointment.
In case he should be successful it would
•necessitate some rearrangement of the
slate in the northern district. In con
nection with the mew gossip regarding
the reappointment of Marshal Christian
it is also stated in Washington dis
paitches that he has promised not to re
appoint Howard Hedrick as his chief
deputy. Hedrick is the business part
ner of Christian and together they
have been able to erect a fine hotel in

forced to promise the chief deputy
ship to some other person. In some of
the recent Washington dispatches it
has been assumed that the matter of
the disposition of the offices as be
tween the different districts is all
settled, therefore that in the case of
Temple and Weaver especially, there
can be no possible chance for anybody
to get the places they are after. If it
is true that the congressmen, have a
definite understanding as to which of

COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL
Unique Institution Located at Panora,
in Guthrie County May Be First
Step in Development of Statewide
System.
Special to Times-Republican.
Iowa City, Dec. 17.—F. C. Ensign,
member of the department of educa
tion in the State University of Iowa,
has just returned to the city from a
toi^r of inspection of Iowa high schools,
during which he visited the only coun
ty high school in the state. This unique
institution is located at the little city
of Panora, in Guthrie county, about six
miles from Guthrie Center, the county
seat, and is considered 'by many edu
cators in Iowa as the first step in the
development of a statewide system of
county high schools. 7
"There are about 200 students," de
clares Professor Ensign, "and most of
those are men ranging in age from 18
to 23, and even older. This fact makes
it impossible for them to compete in
the state interscholastlc meet because
there is an age limit of 21 on all ath
letes who compete. The course^ of
study is not exactly what one would
expect to find In a high school of that
kind. In addition to the regular pre
paratory college' courses the Panora
school has courses in agricultural
chemistry and stock judging. These
last two courses have made the insti
tution especially attractive for the boys
of the county and with the people who
pay the bills. Larger appropriations
for its maintenance have been paid
without question. The school has two
well equipped buildings and in«every
way has proved of great value to the
county."

WOMAN BREAKS JAIL
Cuts Hole Thru Brick Wall, Con

—Believed to Be a Shrewd Criminal.
Mason, Mich., Dec. 17.—The worn .r.
arrested three weeks ago at Lans!ig
on a charge of shoplifting, known as
"Molly Magulre," made her escape from
the county jail last night by cutting a
two foot hole thru an eighteen-ineh
brick wall, then descending on a rope
ladder from the second story of the
jail. The woman's identity has baffled
the officers since her arrest. She is be
lieved, to be a criminal of importance.
The nearest clue to her identity was
when she sent a telegram to a mem
ber of the detective force in Milwaukee
asking for money. In some unknown
manner the woman received two steel
chisles with which she picked a hole
thru the wall.

NAGEL FOUND GUILTY.
Cabin Boat Criminal Will Get Peniten
tiary Sentence.
Muscatine, Dec. 17.—The jury in the
Nagel case, on trial at Cambridge, 111.,
returned a verdict finding him guilty of
•robbery thru an open- door with intent
to commit murder. The attorneys ar
gued all Saturday afternoon before the
jury. Attorneys Weld and Pleasants
talked for the defense, while Attorney
Sturtz, the state's attorney for Henry
county, in which the trial was held,
and who assisted State's Attorney
Scott, of Rock Island county, also made
a strong plea to the jury urging the
conviction of Nagel.
The jury did not deliberate long. It
took but a few ballots and was unani
mous for conviction'.
The case of Nagel has almost made
a record for legal delays. Nagel and
the Collette woman were arrested in
their cabin boat on Island B, above
Muscatine on the 2nd of August, 1905.
Brady's body was found the next day
and later both were take.™ to Rock
Island county to await trial. Hhey
were indicted for murder. They were
not tried within four months after the
indictments were found and were
freed according -to the supreme court
decision. Then State's Attorney Scott
had several indictments 'brought
against them, one of them being bur
glary with intent to commit murder
and the other .robbery with intent -to
commit murder. A couple of weeks
ago Nagel w*as freed on tlhe first
charge, and later -the Collette woman
was released on motion of her attor
ney. Now Nagel has been convicted
on this charge which will mean a long
term in -the penitentiary..

Not a Town In Northern North

POSSIBILITY OF SNOW BLOCKADE
This Is a Serious Feature of the Met!
Critical Condition in History of th«
State—Northern Minnesota Condit
tions Similai*- Railroad 'Officii!
Blames Fuel Dealers for Situation*
St. Paul, Dec. 17.—A special to itM
Dispatch from Grand Porks, N. D«
says .that the fuel situation today re-i
sents the most critical condition that
(has existed in the history of the state*,
Careful inquiry in every portion of itn«
northern half of the state shows thai"
there Is not a town In which coal
be had, except In small quantities, an
a supply to Immediately needed In do*
ens of places. There is oot a pound
he bought, dealers having been out oa4
of fuel Cor days, and in some cases
for a week or more.
At Larfrnore, one car of coal was re*
ceived Saturday and sold out In juajf"«
iter of a ton lots. The electric UeSi
plant Is running On half time. 'At
Lin ton, no bituminous coal nor Hinitll
has been received for weeks. There is
plenty of lignite ait Bismark, but 11 can
not be gotten here. At Lakoba, dealers
are out, and individuate are abarinc
with their neigh-bora. Ait' Caiwlo tha
flour mill has been "closed for three
-weeks, for lack of fuel, the light plaint
closed Thursday, and individuals axe
running short. At Granville the tost
coal -was sold December 8. At Towne*
and Rugby, the schools are dosed, aa
they are ait imany smaller places. .At
Mlnot, the central heating planl is
closed down at initerval-s to save fuel.
These illustrations could be multiplied
indefinitely, as the same conditions pre
vail in the southern half of tfce stata
and in northern Minnesota. On© of
the serious features, is the poseibiliC
of a snow hlackade. There is now more
snow on the ground than at any tta#
since 1896. Thus far, the state has es
caped high wind® and bad driflts, but
a storm such as is usual at any tiwis
in the winter, would pile/ up lmmenss
drifts and tie -up the roads completely!
for many days, and cripple them, fog
the entire winter.
Railway Blames Fuel Dealers.
Washington, Dec. 17.—In response ta
telegrams of inquiry addressed to thai
presidents of several western railroads
by the interstate commerce commis
sion as to causes of the reported short
age of cars for transportation of fuel,
by reason of which great suffering fcas
been entailed, President Howard BUI
ott, of the Northern Pacific Railway
Company, telegraphs the commission
from' St. Paul as follows:
"There is a scarcity of fuel in soma
parts of the country served by our line,
but we do not know of any shortage of
other necessaries of life. Our company
has done and will continue to do all it
can to prevent suffering. The com
pany realized In June and July last
that the fuel supply would likely be
inadequate and that the great increase
in general business would probably
produce a congestion in -the autumn.
We therefore urged all dealers a* that
time to look ahead and provide a stock
of coal early and try to find new
sources of supply. I think the reason
given in your message, namely, ex
traordinary delays in moving. Is incor
rect so far as this company is concern
ed. The difficulty in Montana, Idaho
and Washington is that not enough
coal is being produced to supply the
increased trade and at the same tima
furnish railroads with fuel for the op
eration of Its trains."
Elliott says floods and blissards have
contributed to the delay in moving cars
and freight.
