A DISx.PPOINTIN-G TJ SS LGE.
The message of President Cleveland
which we lay before our readers, in its
entirety, this morniujr, will prove a
disappointment in -that it contains only
-what everybody knew, and in that it
contains nothing new. It is of for
eign fermentation, of tariff troubles,
and of financial fetichisni from begin
ning to end, interminably drawn out.
Assuming that the administration has
all along been right and congress all
along wrong, it promises nothing and
settles nothing. The president's opin
ion that the greenback should go, and
his recommendation that the country's
currency be reduced by three hundred
millions, and more, dollars, will not be
heeded or acted upon. The people wm
not approve of a successive issue of
gold bonds to meet current expenses,
and congress is aware of that fact
With the revenues equal to or in excess
of current expenses the treasury notes
would no longer prove a. menace but
a blessing. There can be no possible
relief in curtailing the volume of cur
rent money and at the same time in
creasing the amount of interest bearing
debt. As for anything else the mess
age is without interest Instead of
the promise of a more vigorous and
manly foreign policy hoped for, or the
concession that our tariff policy should
who improved the opportunity to rise
in the world. Louis XVL was the un
happiest of human solecisms and the
weary, irresolute Lafayette he called
Scipia Americanus, and Thomas Paine
the revolution's needleman. The ar
istocracy for all time will be the master
unworkere. Charles II. is Nell Gwynee,
defender of the faith.
Utilitarianism he dubbed mumbo
junibofsm. The followers of John
Stuart 31111 he called morhe Mill
Wrights and the philosophy itself was
wheel and pinion logic. The editors
of newspapers were mendicant
friars (V) Musicians were spiritual
niggers.
Here is his description of man: "To
the eye of vulgar logic what is man?
An omnivorous biped that wears
breeches. To the eye of pure reason
what is he? A soul, a spirit and di
vine apparition. Round his uryhter
ious Me there lies under all those wool
rags a garment of flesh (or of senses)
con textured in the loom of heaven,
whereby he is revealed to his like, and
dwells with them in union and divi
sion, and sees and fashions for him
self a universe, with azure starry
spaces and long thousands of years.
Deep hidden is he under that strange
garment; amid sounds and colors and
forms, as it were swathed in and in
extricably overshrouded; yet it is sky
woven and worthy of God."
THE NATIONAL, CONVENTIONS.
Great interest is evinced among the
at least exact as much from foreign rjvai aspirants for the presidential
countries as they drawfrom us, expect
ed by many in tho message, there is
only a Teiteration of that which the
newspapers have long since told us
about the Waller outrage, the Venez
uela steal, -the Behring sea and Alas
ke bounday complications, and a dog
ged adherence to the pretty theory,
but impractical policy, at least for a
d'btor nation, of free trade. There
is not a statesmanlike declaration or a
iolid business suggestion to be found
in the entire document which is dis
tinctive principally for its dreariness,
Its want of information and excessive
nomination over the time and place of
the next national conventions. The
Democrats being in power should lead
off but their conservation in this in
stance will amount to cowardice. The
Democratic national central committee
have for many years met on Wash
ington's birthday to arrange their call
and fix a time. But this time they
will hold their meeting some time be
tween now and the holidays.
When it comes to the Republican side
Harrison's friends are anxious that the
Democrats should hold their conven
tion first. But this is upon the as
the rolls, and -that -42,411 were per
manently dropped for -various causes.
The appropriation for the payment of
pensions for the fiscal year ended June
SO, 1S0.J, was ?130,000,000. This
amount was swollen by $S,672.5S from
recoveries" of pension money and at
torney's fees claimed to have been
fraudulent The whole amount paid
for pensions during the year was ?1C0,
S07,337.30. Thus it is seen that there
should be a balance in the treasury to
the credit of this department of $10,
201,335.2S. It should not be forgotten, however,
that this administration, like that of
1SS5-1SS9, has exhibited an astonishing
weakness for the survivors and widows
of survivors of 'the Mexican war. These
claimants are mostly Democrats. In
lSOl-'thoy were paid pensions amount
ing to $2,317,429.27. But those holding
office in the pension department under
Harrison discovered that the roll pre
pared by the Cleveland adminstration
was singularly favorable to this class
of pensioners, and consequently, after
judicious weeding, it was cut down to
2,111,091.75, in 1S92. Xow note the
difference. In 1S93 the Mexican pen
sions leaped to $2,132,303.79; in 1S94
they sprang to $2,192,052.9S, and for
the last year they have reached the
munificent sum of $2,233,723.S2.
As the New York Mail and Express
well says all this furnishes the key of
the essential policy of this administra
tion. It is animated throughout by a
despicable spirit of partisan discrimin
ation. It would seem as if they had
actually gone to work resurrecting the
old veterans of the Mexican war, in
order to award to them the pre-emi
nence of valor and patriotism.

is no indication that he cared whether
he performed it or not He did not

ZTHAT BOOM AT CRIPPLE CREEK.
Swindle and Fraud ana Wild-Cat fchtmt?
1'aitfnsriH an Vppenr nee.
Cripple Creek. Colo.. Dec. 3. More
money will change hands on- Cripple Creek
mining shares in the next two years than
the mines will produce in ten. The man
without a block In !his possession Is
scarcely qual fied to move In good society.
Everyone Is playing at the game. One
remarkable feature of the situation is
tnat -the shares are stronger and cost
more here at Cripple Creek than at the
other speculating centers. It lias been
the customary experience that shares in
a corporation are usually -weaker in the
section where the property lies upon
which the securities are founded. It is
the old story of the prophet not heing
without honor except in li-s own country.
Here it Is different. The quotations on
the local exchange are almost unvarying
ly a notch or two higher than on the
other boards. The range of nrices at
Cripple Creek today is that of Denver
and Colorado Springs tomorrow.
Too much emphasis cannot be given th
warning to investors to inquire carefully
into securities offered. The wildcat has
grown long claws, capable of leav.ng deep
marks in whatever financial hide they
may be sunk. The stocks at present list
ed on ths call boards are almost all
based upon patented claims, or on prop
erties for which the natents are under
way.
The brokers of Denver with returning
prosperity are a unit for the regstration
of all stocks of incorporated mining con
cerns and thereby prevent over.ssues.
The brokers at the exchange towns are
aiao in iavor of the proposition.
As trade goes now, sales on the Denver
exchange alone rarge from 500,000 to 2.
000,000 shares daily, the cash value of
these ranges from $15,000 to $00,000, and
the commissions form a verv symmetri
cal aggregate. Wildcatting. the IloatJng
of poor stocks and the overissuing of any
kird would poril this at once.
Denver brokers who drew on their re
serveswhen they had any to pay their
August rent are now cleaning up $100 dail
on their percentages. It is too good a
thing to be jeoparded. It Is represented
that the cost of registration -would be a
burden upon chean stocks. This is met
by the proposition that if a stock hasn't

tl is easy for d'stant purchasers to
fi1- a fairl' sood estimate of m'mng pos
sibilities. As at present developed the
gold belt in this state is well defined. It
lies on e'ther side of a line drawn from
Ceorgetown to San Juan on the southwest
corner. Cripple Creek is not the only
gold producing district. It is the Tjest,
and it Is tho fad. It Is regarded bv min
ing men that a shaft sunk almost any
Place here will strike pay rock ultimately.
The nervous question is whether it w'll
strike the ore soon enough to reward the
original -prospectors, and the early buyers
of stock.
Of the condition of the corporations
that are at present contr'butlns to the
great daily sale, some idea has alread
been given in a condensed form. The
statement of the ore productions was not
made at haphazard, but was based upon
tonnage renorU and smelter and mill
vouchers. The producing mines have re
cently taken a strong upward movemeM-
i" LWO wee-h-s- it has- gone from tho th'r-
dity In that direction that the occu
pants of the bufldings -did not have
an opportunity to remove any o thelr
goods. At noon, when the fire had
been placed under control but was still
3ercely burning, the turned territory
sxtended from No. 52 to Xb. 74 Merid
ian street.
The following firms were burned out:
Schnull & Co., wholesala grocers; Ward
Bros., druggists; Fairbanks, ilorse &.
Co., scales; Reckhoase Bros., liquors;
TVor3fo-d & Pohlman, liquors; the In
dian Coffee company and the Hilde
brand Hardware company.
The buildings were -all of brick ana
three and four stories high. Several
firemen were carried down by falling
walls. It Is believed that two will die.
The estimated total value of the stock
destroyed is $372,000, which, together
with the loss on the buildings, will
reach $300,000. There is a total of
about $300,000 Insurance.

modification of them in favor of Kan
