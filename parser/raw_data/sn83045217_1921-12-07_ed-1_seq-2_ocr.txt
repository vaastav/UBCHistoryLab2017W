Harding Tells Congress Nation
Rest of World in Its Restoration
«Il HIFF
Advocates Consideration of Further Tax Reduc
tions and Abolition of Hindering Burdens;
Suggest Passage of Law Which Would End
Issuance of Non-Taxable Bonds.
Wshington, Dec. 6.—President Harding informed congress
Tuesday in his first annual message, that "a most gratifying
.'world accomplishment" by the arms conference "is not im
probable." The message was delivered by the president in
person in the chamber of the house and in the presence of the
delegates to the conference and most of the diplomats regularly
stationed in Washington.
At thfi outset, the president describ
ed world conditions saying "the world
restoration program" would have to be
worked out, "by the nations more
• directly concerned,'* The United States
will help, he added, unselfishly because
there is compensation in the conscious
ness of assisting; selfishly, because the
' commerce and international exchanges
in trade. Which marked our high tide
of fortunate' advancement, are possibly
only when the nations of all continents
are restored to stable order and normal
relationship. >
Asks for Prompt Action
Turning to domestic problems, the
president urgently recommended early
enactment of the permanent tariff and
foreign debt refunding bills. He also
announced that, later on he would
make some recommendations about re
newed consideration of tax program.
involving further reductions and the
abolition of "hindering burdens." He
also suggested consideration by con
gress of an amendment to the consti
tution to end the issue of non-taxable
bonds.
With regard to the merchant marine,
Mr. Hardjng said it was the purpose
to present a plan which "contemplates

"Proper encouragement" for the co
operative marketing program as a
means of assisting in the relief of pres
ent conditions in agriculture was sug
gested by the executive. He also told
the congress that it should give its
"earnest attention" to a general policy
of transportation of distributed indus
try and highway construction, to en
courage the spread of tbe population
and restore the balance between city
and country.
Other Recommendations

Text of Message.
The text of President Harding's
message to congress follows:
Mr. Speaker and members of the
congress:
It is a very gratifying privilege to
come to the congress with the republic
at peace with all the nations of the
world. More, it is equally gratifying
to report that our country is rot or.ly
free from every impending menace of
war. but there are growing assurances
of the permanency of the peace which
we so deeply cherish.
For approximately ten years we
have dwelt amid menaces of war or
as participants in wars and the in
evitable aftermath, with its disordered
conditions, has added to the differences
of government which directly cannot
be appraised except by those who are
in immediate contact with them and
know the responsibilities. Our task
would be less difficult if we had only
ourselves to consider, but so much of
the world was involved, the disordered
conditions are so well nigh universal,
even among the nations not engaged
in actual warfare, that no permanent
readjustments can be effected without
consideration of our inescapable re
lationship to world affairs in finance
and trade.
Work 1tk Nations.
It is not my purpose to bring to you
a program of world restoration. In
the main such a program must be
worked out by the nations most direct
ly concerned. They must themselves
turn to the heroic remedies for the
menacing conditions under which they
are struggling, then we can help, and
we mean to help. We shall do so un
selfishly because there is a compensa
tion in the consciousness of assisting;
selfishly, because the commerce and
international exchange in trade which
marked our high tide of fortune
and advancement, are possible only
when the nations of the world are re
stored to stable order and normal re
lationship.
In the main the contribution of this
republic to restored normalcy in the
world must come through the initiative
of the executive branch of the gov
ernment, but the best intentions and
most careful consideration of purposes
would fail utterly if the sanction and
the co-operation of congress were not
cheerfully accorded.
I am very sure we shall have no
conflict of opinion about constitutional
duties or authorities. During the
anxieties of war, when necessity seem
ed compelling, there were excessive
grants of authority and an extraor
dinary concentrating of powers in the
chief executive.
End to Exoesses.
The repeal of war time legislation
and the automatic expirations which
attend the peace proclamations have
put. an end to these emergency ex
cesses, but I have the wish to go fur
ther than that. I want to join you in
restoring in the most cordial way the
spirit of co-ordination and co-opera
tion and that mutuality of confidence
and respect which is necessary in rep
resentative popular government.
Encroachment upon the functions of
congress or attempted dictation of its
policy are not to be thought of, much
less attempted, but there is an insist
ent call for harmony of purpose and
concord of action to speed the solu
tion of the difficult problems confront
ing both the legislative and executive
branches of the government.
It is not considered worth while to
make allusion here to the character of
our government, mindful as one must,
be that an address to you is no less a
message to all our people, for whom
you speak most intimately. Ours is a
popular government through political
parties. We divide along political lines
and I would ever have it so. I do not
mean that partisan principles should
hinder any public servant, in the per
formance of a conscientious and pat
riotic official duty. We saw partisan
lines utterly obliterated when war im
periled, and our faith in the republic
was rivited anew. We ought not find
these partisan lines obstructing the
expeditious solution of the urgent prob
lems of peace.
Should Outline Policies.
Granting that we are fondamentally
a representative popular government
with political parties the governing
agencies, I believe the political party
in power should strive to determine
upon policies in the conference which
supplements conventions &nd election
campaigns and then strive for achieve
ment through adherence to the accept
ed policy.
There is vastly greater security, im
mensely more of the national view
point, much larger and prompter ac
complishment where our dissions are
along party lines, in the broad and
loftier sense, than to divide geograph
ically or according to pursuits, or per
sonal following. For a century and a
third parties have been charged with
responsibility and held to strict ac
counting. When they fail they are re
lieved of responsibility and tbe system
has brought us to a national eminence
no less than a world example.
Necessarily, legislation is a matter
of compromise. The full ideal is sel
dom attained. In that meeting of
minds necessary to insure results there
must and will be accommodations and
compromises, but in the estimate of
convictions and sincere purpose the
supreme responsibility to national in
terest must not be ignored. The shield
to the public servant who adheres to
party policy is manifest, but the pur
pose* is the good of the republic as a
whole.
Compliments Congress.
It would be ungracious to withhold
acknowledgement of the really large
volume and excellent quality of work
accomplished by the extraordinary ses
sion of congress which so recently ad
journed. I am not unmindful of the
very difficult task with which you
were called to deal, and no one can
ignore the insistent conditions which,
during recent years, have called for
the continued and almost exclusive at
tention of your membership.
We are all agreed about the diffi
culties and the inevitable divergence
of opinion in seeking the reduction,
amerioration and readjustment of the
burdens of taxation. Later on, when
other problems are solved, I shall make
some recommendations about renewed
consideration of our tax program, but
for the immediate time before us, we
must be content with the billion dol
lar reduction in the tax draft upon the
people and diminished irritations, ban
ished uncertainty and improved meth
ods of collection. By your sustain
ment of the rigid economies already in
augurated, with hoped for extension of
these economies and added efficiencies
in administration, I believe further re
ductions may be enacted and hindering
burdens abolished.
Assisted by Budget.
In these urgent economies we shall
be immensely assisted by the budget
system for which you made provision
in the extraordinary session. The first
budget is before you. Its preparation
is a signal achievement and the per
fection of the system, a thing impossi
ble in the few months available for its
initial trial, will mark its fulfillment as
the beginning of the greatest reforma
tion in government practices since the
beginning of the republic.
With the hands of the executive
branches held impotent to deal with
these debts, we are hindering urgent
readjustment among our debtors and
accomplishing nothing for ourselves. I
think it is fair for the congress to as
sume that the executive branch of the
government would adopt no major pol
icy in dealing with these matters, which
would conflict with the purpose of
congress in authorizing the loans, cer
tainly not without asking congressional
approval, but there are minor prolj

to admit of reduced duties on imports
