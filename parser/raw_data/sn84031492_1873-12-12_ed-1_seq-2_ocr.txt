SECOND DAY.
From Our A'jrtcultural Correspondent,
Champaign, lit., Dee. 10, 1873.
Tho Society met,—President Dunlap iu the
*flialr.
Prayer was offered by Mr. S. G. Miuklor, a
member.
Mr. Humphreys, of Knox County, road a pa
per ou tho subject of
TIMBEE-PLANTINO.
Hr. If. thinks that tho Government will bo
compelled to come to onr aid in tho on
couragomout of trco-plnntiug. Ho gives us (bo
startling intelligence that our supply
of timber will bo exhausted within tho
next ton years, and It will bocomo our
duly to plant forests for tho demands of tho
near future. Ho would havo tho Government
establish a Department of Forestry, ami givo
this industry a now impetus, somewhat in ac
sordtuteo with tbo demand.
Prof. Itiloy protected against those essays on
tree-planting. This is but one side. The pro
diction of tlio ten years' failure has not proved
true, and bo would call attention to tho fact that
Illinois had to-day more forests than it had
twenty years ago. lie claimed that culture in
duced moisture In tho soil, ami denied tho charge
(hat tho cutting down of forests lessoned tho
rainfall, 110 would oucourngo forost-troo-plaut
'dr, but not for tho reason stated in tho essay.
Mr. Green took exception to the position
of Prof. Itiloy, and bold that tho timber
was fast disappearing, and it was timo
to look for our future supplies.
The Mobile & Obio Railroad has boon tho means
of denuding tho country along tho lino of that
road of its timber. Ho corroborated bis posi
tion by facts that had como under his observa
tion.
Mr. Flagg thought that tho rainfall has boon
more unequal, not that wo have a less annual
rainfall, but tho droughts are longer and tho
periods of cold moro intense, thus injuriously
affecting vegetation.
Prof. Riley contended that any field-crop
would have tho same effect on tho rainfall ns
that of tho forests. Culture servos to drain tho
land; it is tho rapid flow of our streams that
carries of! tho water in a shorter period, and'
docs not lesson tho rainfall.
Mr. Wior claimed that it was pasturage that
made the climato so dry at present as compared
to thirty years ago. AH tho swamps and
wot bottom-lands had been so pastured and ox
rosed to. the sunlight that they haiTdriod up.
Ho denied that there was less annual rainfall,
or that tho droughts wore moro sovoro, but
claimed that tho water ran off in a shorter timo
on account of tho hard surface, and is absorbed
in tho porous soil of the livor-bottoma. Springs
have not been lost, but tboir points of discharge
aro lower down, or bid uador tbo surface,
Mr. MeAfeo spoko for half an hour on tho sub
ject of rainfall, contending that streams, forests,
md Hhollor-belia attracted tho falling rain, ana
that forests received the greater share, and also
that fotosts give off a largo amount of moisturo
to the air. Ho cited instances in tho Rocky
Mountains, on tho Missouri and Mississippi
Rivers, whore tbo timber attracted tho rainfall.
Mr. Flagg claimed that, while tho annual rain
fall might’bo tho same, yet ho was satisfied that
It foil at longer intervals, aud ran oft so rapidly
that it was of less value, aud that, in this respect,
tho climate had boon changed by tbo band of
man. Ho denied the position of Prof. Riloy,
that tho cultivated fields havo tho same effect on
moisture as the w’ild vegetation and tho forests.
Tho discussion was listened to with doop
interest, and presented many facts of interest.
An invitation from tbo Regent to tako part in
the dedication of tbo main building of tbo In
dustrial University was accepted.
Prof. H. U. MeAfeo. of Freeport, road a paper
on Botany and Vegetable Physiology.
VARIATION FROM FARENTAL FORM
in vegetable life was the subject. Tho enthu
siast is delighted on the opening of a now flower
that dill'ors from the parental form. It
is this that relieves the floral kingdom
from monotony, and gives it its greatest - value.
Tho cross-breeding and constant variation give
so much of now beauty and of now value, and
load to a deeper interest in tbo subject of vege
table growth. Without following in tho develop
ment theory, yet tho essayist made many tolling
arguments in favor of his theory of change in
the animal kingdom. The paper cannot fail to
attract attention.
LEGISLATIVE RECOGNITION.
Hr. Green altered tbo following resolution,
which was passed without dissent:
JtcHolveil, That it in tho sense of this Society that
our Legislature should recognize tho importance of
iho rapidly-extending horticultural interests of the
State, which Is now so apparent as to require no argu
mentative discussion, by providing for tho reorgani
zation of the State Horticultural Society upou tho
bads proposed In tho bill now before them.
Jlfsolvai, That the members of this Society, both
K resent here and absent, aru requested and expected
) present the nubjcct oi tho bill to tho legislative
members of their respective districts, in full confi
dence that a knowledge of Us provisions, amt its im
portance to tbo State, will prompt their favorable ac
tion.
Hr. Humphrey, Vice-President for tho
THIRD DISTRICT,
rend a model report of tho condition of Horticul
ture in his district. He icports many contradic
tory theories in regard to the losses‘of lust win
ter. Tho appio crop was light, and many trees
dead; and yet tho Concord grape gave a full
crop. Orchards protected appear to have suf
fered least; but the severity of tho drought no
doubt caused tho greater part of tho damage.
Tho luck of rain has been favorable to tbo grape
cron, hut had a contrary olfcct ou ollior crops.
Hr. Francis, Vice-President for tho
FOURTH DISTRICT,
road his report. Ho reports the most disas
trous winter on fruit that has occurred within his
experience, Tho Delaware grapes wore killed
to tho ground ; peach-orchard killed ; and all
fruits suffered more or loss. Among these,
grapes were nearly a failure. This shows that
shocks of cold are nob uniform in pausing South.
Tho lowest point of tho mercury at Freeport last
winter was degrees, while in Sangamon
County tho same day it was DO degrees below
zero.
RUD- VARIATION.
Messrs, Whorlor, Flag!,', McAfee, and Prof.
Durrill took part in a discussion on this topic ;
but they could not agree that bud-variation was
a fixed fact, though (hoy all conceded that of
flowers and plants.
Hr. Wior stated that, In cultivating blaokbor-*
rice, some of Iho roots produced while fruit,
showing a bud-variation.
Sir. Bad Foster, of lowa, suggested Hint those
variations of buds might be duo to external in
fluence.
Mr. Hay gave several remarkable cases,—one
In which tho upper part- of a weeping-willow won
chanced to ring-wood willow. Probably tho
change was due to a stroke of lightning that in
jured tho tree.
Tho Society adjourned to meet at 1 p. ra., to
take part in tho oxercisuH of the
IKPUBTIIIAL UNIVKIISITY I>KDICATIOK.
The now building in very well arranged. Hie

Tho historical address
DY TUB REGENT
is a finished paper as a literary effort, and. as
the Director is a pleasant speaker, was received
with marked satisfaction. Tho speaker laid
stress ou tho point that it Is not possible to
tench to any extent the manual of the arts and
industries, but that it is to teach tho sciences
that Ho near them,—not forgetting that there
aro other studios that shall make tho finished
scholar, —in short, hotavorod agonoral University
that shall load iu tho industries. Qo clalmoil
that litllo change has been intulo iu tho course
of studios from those at first promulgated. Tho
special technological schools of Emono in them
selves are tho best success whou united to tho
Universities, making them stronger and
better. There are hundreds of agricultural
schools in Europe, and they appear
to fully maintain their popularity. Baton
Liebig held that tho lands of llcsso had
keen advanced 300 per cout iu valuo in conso
qucnco of tho agricultural schools. Tho Doctor
took occasion to condemn the action of Cougross
iu rcgaid to a further appropriation to tho Agri
cultural College. Iu tho Agricultural College wo
aro making steady progress, and tho number of
tho studouts is steadily increasing. There aro
about 400 students, of which there are about 80
females. In tho course of study, tho agricutural
and mechanical studios aro increasing, m accord
auco with tho ago.
Tho President, Mr. Cobb, introduced
ins EXCELLENCY QOV. HEVE11I1)(IE,
who made a telling speech in regard 10 tho re
pudiating members of the Hoard of Supervisors
of Cuumpaign County.
Tho day was closed in tbo best cf spirits; and
all aro satisfied that tbo Industrial University,
under tbo now management, witli Mr. Cobb as
President, is destined to tnuko good progress.
Dr. Gregory, as Hood of tho Facility, appears to
bo doing au olllckmt work.
Under tho now law, oach student is obliged to
tako at least two studios closely allied to Agri
culture and tho Mcolmnio Arts. Rubai*.
SELF-REPORTING.
_ To the Editor of The Chicago 'Tribune:
Sin : I notice of lato in Tub Tribune two
pleas for morals from tho same pen,—tho argu
ments for each, as it scorns to mo, equally falla
cious : Tho idea that a minister of religion iu
not responsible to tho community for his private
conduct, if only ho preach sound morality with
eloquence; and tho idea that to allow tho esti
mate which a child or youth at school puts upon
his own conduct to go for anythiug in judgiugof
his deserts is to cucourago lying aud put a
premium on dullness.
Of tho morality of tho ministers I havo noth
ing to say, but of tho morals of tbo school-room
oxporionco gives mo a right to an opinion.
Most of us in middle life can recall tho old
school-house, behind whoso ink-stained, kuifo
carved decks wo oonnodour grammars and “ did
our sums," and tasted tho stolen BW’cote
of apples, aud gingerbread, and yellow
covered literature. We mado no “ reports,"
Such transgressors as tbo master could "catch "
in flagrante delicto bad to pay tho penalty, moro
or loss sovoro according to his mood, or the
various considerations of cxpodioncy and pru
dence suggested by his social relations to tbo
culprit’s respected father and mother, big
brother, or fair sister. Tho most practiced
offenders woro usually the most adroit and
skillful, aud so it generally happened that ven
geance fell on the unlucky wight who had least
prompt aud complete coutrol of bis facial mus
cles. Tho uufortuuato •* snicker" got tho stripes
of chastisement, or tho sufferer of tho plu
plorced trowser-lcgs had a double smart of the
ferule to " teach him to sit stillwhile the real
disturber of the pence sat with demure face aud
buzzing lips, inflecting his “hie, Jueo, hoc ."
Tho " girl that giggled " sat meekly washing her
slato, while her muocout neighbor, for that
miserable habit of blushing, was condemned to
stand uu tho floor uud do pouanco for hor guilty
sister.
Tho old school-house, with ferule, and birch,
and missile of book or chalk, has passed away,
and given place to tho now regime of “ Howard
of Mont,” “1101 l of Honor," and “Self-Uc
ports,"—tbo latter being, not, as some have sug
gested, a relic of old barbarism, but uu inven
tion of modern civilization. Is tho now worse
than tbo old ? Are tbo educators of to-day teach
ing falsehood and hypocrisy ; training a race of
••Maohiavola;” unfitting the members of our
schools to bo “ members of Ohurob and State
subverting tbo “ laws of good government” and
the •• fundamental laws of God "? These are
grave charges, and it becomes us to inquire if
they are true.
Granting, as your correspondent avers of Self
lloportiug, that 11 No moro ingenious plan could
be devised for teaching falsehood and hypocri
sy;” that “it is teaching tho young to live bv
mlos diametrically opposite to those which shall
govern them in Church and Slate,"—that was a
most unwise uud injudicious, nob to say culpa
bly rush, parent who dared to risk tho
hazards of propounding tho historic question,
“ Who hacked my cherry-trees V' and that a
marvelous escape of the youthful soul from tho
snares of parental temptation which blurted out
tho “ I did it, papa, with my hatchet.” It must
have been a special interposition which saved to
Church uud state a youth exposed to such per
nicious influences of Bolf-Koportiug.
Your correspondent errs in comparing pupils
at school, giving their reports of conduct, to
criminals arraigned before the bar of justice,
and in comparing nt ail school-government to
State-government. Whether or not it would bo
desiraolo to model our schools after tbo Stato
govurmnont, with its law-making, law-judging,
and law-executing powers, and its restrictions
and penalities, may be a question. Such is not
their present government. It is in a
souse unique; yet, as I take it, on tbo
whole resembles tho family-government,
Tho teacher is supposed to bo for tho time in
place of tho parent; and that ideal sohool
brings toucher and pupil into tho relations of
kind parent uud dutiful child, or, in tho case of
older pupils, into the moro equal friendship of
tho fraternal or tho sisterly relations.
Whatever in public sentiment tends to foster
the idea that there is uu antagonism of interests
between teacher and pupil, does iulluitoly moro
harm than all tho Self-lloporting that such an
outcry is raised against. Of such I count your
correspondent's expression, that it cun ho a
credit to any person to have his name wanting
from the •* 1101 l of Honor" prepared by tho au
thorities of his school or college.
All agree that young people in tho family, and
especially when gathered in schools in largo
numbers, cannot bo loft, unchecked and un
guided, to their “ own sweet will,” Some re
straints must be put upou them, pioportioncd
to their numbers, the location in city or country,
and their ago, discretion, and moral character.
Tho parent who lives in a crowded street, near
a railway, where locomotives ore passing every
hour, or who dwells on tho verge of a lake,
where bouts are tossing on tho waves, may doom
It wise to prohibit his family of several children
from mulling the track or tho boats their play
ground. The careful mother may proscribe the
bounds of her children's walks. Perhaps, as
Mrs. Stanton suggests, a truer wisdom would
put forth no prohibition, but lot tho little ones
main, from tho maimed arm, the mangled form,
or tho dionchcd corpse, tho dangers of flood aim
mmiiu, But the wisdom is too dearly bought,
i mental solicitude interposes the preventive
I'ueck: ,k Vou must not play on tho track; you
mu,' nut sail in tho boat.” Parental wisdom will,
1 confess, make such checks only when uoc»s
siry, uud will explain their necessity. Hut,
made, how can they host ho enforced ? What is
iho method best for the child.—not simply tbo

tlally tho principle of Self-Reporting in our
schools. I rogmd it not only as a help
to tho teftohor in government, but ns one of tho
most Invaluable methods of moral discipline. Tho

Herbert aponeor says, “Tho most glaring de
lect in our s\ toms of education is tho neglect
of mural culture." I boliovo Unit the Solf-Ro
porting system, judiciously used, may go far to
supplement this dollcionoy. Bo far from caus
ing a spirit of mutual concealment, it will create a
sentiment of honor, and a keen sense of justice,
and a proper fooling of contempt for tho de
ceiver and tho hypocrite.
“Judiciously used." Lot tho rules bo as few
as possible, and so reasonable as to commend
themselves to an impartial mind; lot them bo
general enough to allow some latitude, and not
so miuuto ns to narrow and belittle tho con
science to a slavish scrupulosity; and tho Solf-
Itoporting system will stand its own against ail
attacks, for it is founded on tho best principles
of our nature. It is not to bo denied that it lias
its dangers. Every natural impulse, ovory ap
petite and passion, every intellectual activity
oven, which Qod has givou us, is dangerous. Bo
too are tho forces of nature. Eire, electricity,
wind, wave—everything bonolloont—has its
danger in unskillful or excessive use. It is,
therefore, doubtless true that, under systems
of Self-Reporting more or loss imperfect,
ns they must all bo, your correspondent may
have met “ several young ladies who have, with
tho must infantile appearance of innocence, out
witted trusting parents,*’ etc., etc.; but this fact
docs not prove anything against tho generally
beneficent syntora, any more than the fact that
Chicago, and Boston, and London have been
burned up proves that wo should cease to use the
dangerous element of firo.
As to tho Evanston school, it would seem from
tho letters of tho villagers that the evil is not
that tho girls report, but that tho boys do not
report; that there is a lack, if not of men
tal, at least of moral coeducation. A. B. 0.
THE VILLE DU HAVRE,
What a Feminine Journalist \VI»o
CroHsed the Ouuiin In It Says About
the Old Hulk.
Mrs. linmhain's heller to the St. Louis Republican,
As I write this lottor tho nows goes through
tho laud that the Villo du Havre lies at tho bot
tom of tho soa. Tho awful disaster must ohill
ovory heart, but it comos homo to mo with doub
ly dreadful import. Igo back to nights when
that dismal old boat would of a sudden stand
slill and shivor and shako liko a paralytic, whou
all bauds aud tho cook scamporod from stem to
stern to loam tho locality of tho last trouble. I
loft that boat a devoutly-tbankful, but somewhat
disappointed woman. I counted on her going to
tho bottom that trip. Tbo gorgeous old hulk
was fixed up with Iho bloom of youth and
patent stays and now machinery, but was
old wbou she wont into tho lino. She was au
old side-wheel steamer, which had borne
tho name of Napoloon HI. (Queer name for an
old girl.) Sbo outraged all tho laws of naval
architecture, aud 1 always supposed ships, liko
bridges, must bo symmetrical iu shape to bo
safe. Hero was a ship, originally of good
length, to which was attached sixty foet of gild
ed saloon. It was tacked or stuck on some way.
and was tho outiro width of tho vessel, with not
a single bruco anywhere to be scon. Paneled
beautifully with while marble slabs, veined with
cold, at a little distance they had tho cheerful
look of cravo-stones, aud it took very little
imagination to road first class obituary notices
on all of thorn. That whole saloon always scorn
ed to mo a sort of porcolain-linod iron dinner
not. Very lucky for mo it is that tho Villo du
llavro didn't moot a floating olothos-polo last
August. I shouldn't bo on dry Inna to-day
thiukinc sadly of thoso poor creatures who
perished on tho morning of tho 15th of Novem
ber.
As a prophetess I am a success, and I mean to
write to my paternal progenitor to-night and
learn if there is any seventh daughter about mo.
I predicted a prediction that that Vila old boat
would never see the year’74 alloat, audio I she
la gone. Never again through her gilded saloon
will ring the Anglo-French cry, “ Ding dong,
gnicou, cat lemonade I" There is a terrible les
son to bo learned from the loss of the Ville du
Havre, if the actual facts are ever known, for
there was frightful economy shown in its man
agement. and criminal recklessness in over nut
ting her on the hue. When I came over they
hid the disabled state of the screw,
and took her back to bo repaired in
France, with one entire fan gone and part of
another missing, because repairs cost so much
leas there than hero. They saved SiOouatnp
by using a filthy yellow fat on tho machinery in
stead of docent oil, and tho smell of tho vile
compound slowing on the engines must have
done much to reconcile tbo passengers to ship
wreck. A paper hero expresses astonishment
that an oloctrio light was not used. Why, tho
last I know of the dastardly economy of the
French lino they wore negotiating with a red
headed Gaul, thinking ho would prove a cheaper
substitute lor a head-light than tho feeble lau
torus in use. Catch them increasing their ex
penses SIOO a day for an electric light.
I scuttled tho ship in half-a-dozen places with
hair-pins and paper-cutters. I toll the unoxag
goratod truth when I say that, lying on the sofa
in stale-room No. 50, 1 dug into tho punky
wood, two or throe inches away from the port
hole, with a paper-knife till I struck tho glazing
of iron that formed its outer coat. That iron
plating was nowhere thicker thou a frying-pan,
and a determined little pilot-boat, with a suinglo
nail at tho prow, could have cut through us and
got out tho other side, if it didn't run into the
cook or Captain on route. When tho Loch Earn
gets into port, people will rush down to boo the
fearful agent of destruction. She will possess
no such importance for mo. I know how easy
she did it, for I know what a crazy old shell tho
Ville du Havre was.
A Family Obliterated*

“ Murray, Mias. No Information.
“ Platt, Mrs. 0. A. No information,”
Wo can supply tho deficiency.
Five years ago there livocl in tho City of
Oswego, N. Y„ a happy family of seven—a fam
ily of wealth, high social position, well known in
Now York and Philadelphia. Tho head of it, tho
Hon. Hamilton Murray, hold several high poui
lions of trust and honor. Ho was called away,,
and five years ago ho died. Not long after his
death, his oldest son, who graduated at our own
university in this city with honors, was accident
ally drowned soon after ho received hie diploma.
Not long after, tho eldest daughter, a lovely girl,
sunk under tho wnstL.g destroyer, consumption,
and was laid by father and brother. This triple
grief was too much for the hoart-brokon wifo and
mother, and she- wont to join them in tho happy
laud. Hut in going she had to leave her throe
youngest, two sons and a daughter. Calling to
her side her life-long bosom friend, Mrs, 0. A.
Platt, she confided to her care those throe, en
joining upou her never to leave them until they
hod embarked iu life, uud requesting her to ac
company them to Europe and superintend their
education. These three wont down together,

worker in charity and love, Mrs. Platt was one—
a sincere Christian, devoted mother, never-fall

fllnrriacc anil Dotuh*
A strange juxtaposition of mnrriago and death
lately occurred near Lynchburg, Va. There was
a wedding at a country house, and tho guests
flocked in by twos and throes. Mr. William
Carter came with his wife and a child 8 months
old. Mrs. Carter placed her sleeping child on a
hod in ono of tho rooms, and covered it with her
shawl. Other ladies came, and,seeing tho shawl
and no baby, dropped their shawls on tho bod un
til there was quite a pile uf shawls, and when they
wore removed a dead baby was found under
thorn. Tho marriage feast was suddenly turned
intoaaoonoof mourning. The mother of the
child was a sister of tho bride.
WASHINGTON.
President Grant’s Last Mes
sage.
A Review of the Messages of
Former Presidents.
From Our Oicn Correspondent,
Washington, Deo. 4,1873.
President Grant’s suggestion of regaining our
lost commerce and carrying trade by moans of a
small appropriation that will send one vessel up
the Amazon River, is ns absurd as tho revival of
specie-payments by paying oat SIOO per diem in
silver, or as tho President's other suggestion, to
encourage tho Stales to build houses for tholr
Senators In Washington, by building houses at
tho general expense for the Cabinet and Army
folks. Ills proposition to bo allowed to
VETO I’AUT' OP A BILL
and approve tho rest, is merely a request to ad
mit him iu the Legislature, and lot his vote neu
tralize one-third of all the members.
Tho President's suggestions on tho currency
question have no weight, because they have 110
meaning, and one part neutralizes another. His
statement of tho Spanish difficulty is tho most
uninteresting account of a fight ovor given since
Polar drew his sword, and, in an anti-climatic
way, cut off what ? Why, only tho High
Priest’s servant’s oar.
Tho President is entitled to the medal for
having mndo oven tho massacro of tho people ou
tho Virginias tedious.
You cau
go Tintocflii this message,
if you are acquainted in Washington, and charge
ovory loading paragraph in it up lo somo one
personal influence which cajoled It out of tho
President; and the only Joke In tho whole will
bo tho chagrin of tho suggostcr whou ho secs
how dreadfully dull tho President has made his
case by advocacy.

Now let us look at tho previous Presidents and
their messages.
WASHINGTON
had to sot the lesson of a President's message.
His inaugural could ho committed to memory
by a modcratoly-bad scholar in one dav, ami is a
fooling expression of self-concession aud dis
turbed retirement when summoned by “ tbo
voice of my country." Piety, Addisonian com
position} and a declination of salary, are the
main points in it. Tbo President's first regular
message, dated Jan. 8, 1700, is equally concise,
and shows the growing confidence and credit of
tho country ; declares that “ To bo prepared for
war is tho moans of preserving tho peace and
urges that “ Nothing is more worthy tho patron
age of Congress than tho promotion of science
aud literature." Tho early messages are ad
dressed alternately to the Hoauo aud Senate,
after tho maunor of tho Queon's address to Par
liament. Tho second message of President
Washington is also short, but more practical;
for tho national business was thickening
around him in foreign war, admission of
now States, Barbary trespasses, and tho organiza
tion of public institutions. Tho third message
grows in space with tho contents it must treat
of; speaks mainly of Indian wars and treaties,
tho development of tho interior, tho now Capi
tol, tho currency, and weights and measures.
Tho fourth mossago treats of disorders, intes
tine and foreign, and is followed by a proclama
tion of neutrality. Tho fifth and sixth continue
the same. Tho seventh is cheerful and con
gratulatory, and short. Tho eighth is tho mes
sage of tho conscious and thoughtful ruler of a
nation demanding more nationality, increased
institutions, aud better pay for officers. Thou
comes tho wondrous Parowell Address, dated
Bopt. 17, 17DG, equal In length and gravity of
suggestions to muuy of thoso preceding if.
JOHN ADAMS
opened bis inaugural address lugubriously, say*
ing: “When it was first perceived, in
early times, that no middle course for America
. remained." etc., —the first sentence comprising 90
words. Adams’stylo was ornate and tedious,
bis treatment autobiographical, indeed egotisti
cal; and bis message au essay on things in general.
Ho called the country 14 an amiable and interest
ing system of government/’ and patronized it.
There are about 000 words in the last paragraph
but two of Adams' first message. Such a man
was not destined to bavo two terms. In ton
weeks came a special session, when the message
was directed agaiust Franco; but lu Its dull ore
was visible the gleam of au earnest manhood.
Adams' first message was mainly on French
aggressions; bis second on foreign affairs and
boundaries. For a remarkably bad piece of
public writing ou a memorable occasion, road bis
special message ou the death of Washington,
Deo. 23, 1709. His fourth annual address was
his host, and delivered at 44 poor long old Holds,”
Washington, Nov. 22, 1800. His sentences wore
long; bis budget crisp.
JEI'FEnSON
was tho first cosmopolitan politician of honesty
and breadth produced by the country,—Frank
lin do-Ponnsylvuuiaized. There are back-pay
men who call him a demagogue, who wrote over
his religious opinions like a challenger of tho
ago. His eight annual messages are all clear
and elegant compositions; for his honesty
sought, like tho brook, tho,natural level, and his
diction grow clear ou tho way. His first message
shows confidence, obstinate principles, and con
versance with alfairs and Slate-writing, far in
advance of both his predecessors. lie wroto
short papers, easy to understand, and tho con
tents wore well assimilated. Tripolitan mat
ters, overland explorations, Spanish dillioulties,
tho Burr conspiracy, tho Louisiana purchase,
and tho Embargo, mako tho staple of those
documents.
MADISON’S
inaugurals wore quiet and very short, showing
little temperament, much lest than Jefferson's.
MONIIOB,
like the other three, began with an expression of
fear in bis own weakness; which led Mr. Sum
ner, in a late review of President Grant, to say
that Grant was the only President who hud over
entered the oilico not only without sensibility,
but denying that ho had any. Monroe was tho
first suggestive President, taking up tho work
which tho old Ilopublicau party had declined to
do on grounds of ultra limitation. Monroe, in
a measure, created tho public works and public
architecture of the country, and bo wrote clear
ly, suggestively, and entou at length, lie may
bo called tho father of tho present form of Pres
idential message.
JOHN QUINOY ADAMS
wrote with a classic fervor and historiographer’s
scope, close up to tho lino of eloquence, but
with snob explicitness as to diminish tho im
pression of his magisterial character. A good
deal of tho writing m his messages appears to
bo tho indulging of a faculty in that way, and
a loose opiuionatodnosa. instead of solid, neces
sary work; in short, lie wrote speeches, and
pressed upon the country tho institutions which
should civilize our minds, rather than merely
nationalize us. He concludes his third message
with the retrospect of imif-a-coutury, and a
picture of Jefferson and Adams expiring on tho
Fourth of July, which some of our later Presi
dents might exorcise upon.

ami commercial walks. Probably tho first itali

THE ST. LOUIS TRAGEDY.
A Girl’s Intended OliiNlmmi Killed by
Alcr Urothcr.
From, the at. Louie limes, Dec, 10.
Tho tenth murdor of tho year was committed
yesterday afternoon, under peculiarly distressing
circumstances. Richard Boettschor was tho
victim, and his assassin, Benjamin Franklin
Crononbold, is now incarcerated m tho First Dis
trict Police Station.
On Juno 2G, 1872, Judge F. W. Crononbold
died, leaving a widow, a daughter, a son, and an
estate valued at $150,000. For a number of
years tho Judge keot a largo hardware store,
Nos. 1510 and 1515 Carondoiot avenue. Sinco
his death his widow, Mrs. Augusta Orouou
botd, has conducted tho business, with her son,
B. F. Crononbold, and tho bookkeeper, Fredor
orick William Weber, as partners.
Mrs. Crononbold needed a hostler and oar
riago-drivor last March, and her son engaged
Richard Boettschor at tho Gorman Relief Office.
A few weeks after Boottsuhor came to live in
tho house, Mrs. Orououhold sent her son to
Europe. On his return, about ton weeks ago,
ho found that tho hired man had won tiio affec
tions of tho sister; and that the mother had
agreed to a marriage between them. Ho swore
that tbo wedding should not take nlaco, and in
this he was encouraged by Weber,* who was a
suitor for Cora Grouonbold’s hand. Both young
men kept tho family in constant turmoil, aud
frightened Boettschor away from tho house,
but Cora and her mother kept up secret commu
nication with him, aod finally arranged that tho
wedding should tako place ou Friday, tho sth
iust.
On this day young Orononbold wont down
town on business for his mother, but suspecting
that it was a trick to prevent him from interfer
ing with the wedding, he and Weber hastily loft
their work, wont out to tho Orononbold man
sion, on Grand avenue, near Chippewa street,
and found the parlors illuminated, a number of
guests already there, and active preparations for
tho wedding in progress. Tho two young men
lay in wait for Bootlschor, who had not thou ar
rived. When the carriage stopped before tho
door, young Orononbold seized tho horses
and shouted that some one would Imvo to
die before the vehicle could leave. The bride
groom remonstrated, whereupon Weber fired a
shot that wont through the calf of bis loft log,
wounding him so badly as to prevent the wed
ding. So the guests and the minister wore dis
missed.
The son and bis friend was arrested upon tho
charge of assault with iutout to kill, and their
examination is to take place some time this
week, iu tho Court of Criminal Correction.
Yesterday young Orononbold wont to his room
for a nap after dinner, and on awakening found
himself locked iu. Ho listened for a while,
hoard some commotion in tho rooms below, and,
from tbo words used in conversation between
his mother and sister, judged that they wore
goiug out to moot Bootlschor and have the mar
riage performed. This suspicion aroused his
auger, which was heightened ou hearing a closed
carriage stop iu front of tho house, and seeing
Boottschor alight and go into the hallway.
Breaking tho room-door open, ho seized his re
volver, rushed down stairs, and leveled iris
weapon at Boottsuhcr’s head. Tho threatened
man hurriedly loft tho house, followed by Cronon
bold. While Boottschor was climbing over a
fence, Crononbold fired throe shots at him, then
jumped over tho fouco himself, and continued
tho pursuit for about 100 feet, whou two more
shots wore fired, and Boottschor fell dead iu tho
field ou tho west side of Grand avouuo, at the
head of Chippewa street. This occurred about
five minutes to 1 o'clock.
Cronoubold wont down to hia store immediately
after tho shooting. Mounted Policeman itich
ardson happened along on Grand avouuo, and
learned of tho murder. Putting spurs to Ids
horse, ho was in a few minutes aftorwajds at the
First District Station. With Ofilcor George Mil
ler lie stationed several policemen around tho
block whore the store is located, made a descent
upon tho place, arrested and looked both Cronon
bold and Weber up. Tho first-named prisoner
confessed to Cape, nereides that ho did tho
shooting, and stated that tho other man had hud
nothing to do with this last affair. Weber was,
therefore, released.
Young Cronoubold is 22 yours of ago, 5 foot 2
inches m height, thick sot, and rather gentle
manly in his demeanor, with an intelligent,
handsome face. When soon in hia coll by a
Timea reporter, ho was perfectly cool, and
tallied freely about his troubles. From a con
versation tho reporter had with him, and a note
which ho gave a German reporter, his notions
about the causes which led to tho tragedy seem
to ho about as follows :
After IJoottscbor had boon in tho employ of
tho mother a few weeks, hia pleasing address
made him a frequenter of tho family oirolo, and
ho became familiar aucl sociable to a degree that
young Oroncubold did not think proper. • Ho
therefore found fault witli his mother and sister
for paying tho stranger so much attention.
Borne neighborhood gossip led him to believe
that tho hostler was planning a scheme to win
his sister Cora, who was 16 years old
on tho 10th of last October, and thus
got control of her portion of tho estate.
Ho spoke Ids mind freely upon this to his
sister and mother. They ridiculed the Idea, and
said ho was either crazy about tho property or
jealous of his sister. Ho troubled ids mother
so much that she forced him to go to Europe,
and ho believes that tho hostler suggested the
idea to his mother, and hurried him off. While
in Europe bo received letters from ids mother
and Cora, lie says, which contained paragraphs
descriptive of the kimlueaa ami f&llufujuosi) of
tho man servant, and lio thought they must bo
in love with him. A fow days boforo leaving
Europe, ho received letters from some friends
who gavo him to understand that tho hoallor
and his sister and mother woro too inti
mate for their good moral reputation, ilo
started at once for homo, and on arriving
learned that hie mothor had given her consent tu
Ms sister's marriage with Boollfiohor. This was
followed hy suspicions that BooUscbor hod boon
criminally intimate with his (Orononbold’H)
dooroat Kindred, and his suspicions woro
strengthened by their anxiotv for tho wedding
to come off. Thoto Ideas grow in force until ho
determined to have vengeance or die in tho at
tempt. ilo Immediately took his bosom friend,
Weber, into tbo secret, and planned to frustrate
tho wedding. The neighbors warned bis mothor
that ho would do something desperate, as
lie, they said, was going insano on tho
subject. As long as tho mau was
In his way ho could not onloy life, homo,
or property, and, as a last resort, had made up
his mind to dispose of him. Ho save ho regrets
tho killing of lioottsohor, “but bis conscience
Justifies him, if tho law does not.” lie fears that
his mother and sister will desert him, and that
their friends will use their inlluonco to got him
hanged. Ho says his mother is about
C 2 years old. and bo never bad any trouble with
bor until Boottschor came.
William Michel, tho driver of the carriage, In
formed a Times reporter that ho did not know
where ho was to go from the house. Boottsohor
was dressed os though ho was going to party,
and was very pleasant. After young Orononbofd
had chased Boottschor for a short instance. tbo
two ran around a house, near the corner of tho
street, whore Booltscbor knocked for admission,
was refused hy some man who seemed much
frightened. Boollschor throw off bis coat be
fore reaching ttie fence of tbo Hold where bo
was shot. Michol had to run and catch the
horses, which had started to run away, having
boon frightened by tho screams of tho laitos,
Mrs. and Alius Crononbold, and tho noise or tho
shots. Ho reprimanded young Crononbold for
tho shooting, but did not thou know that Boott
fiuhor had been killed.
Boottsclior was about 37 years of ago. Ho was
born near Berlin, Prussia, and came to America
eighteen mouths ago. Ho had a rather aristo
cratic air, and some of his acquaintances sus
pected that ho was tho “prodigal son ” of aorao
noble family. Ho was reticent about his history,
but bis habits woro tboso of a mau of education
and roilnod associations.
it is hardly necessary to say that young Cron
enbold’B suspicions as to tUo improper rolntioos
between his sister and Boottschor wore utterly
unfouaded. No two ladies in St. Louis stood
higher iu the estimation of those who know them
than Mrs. Orononbold and her daughter.

Scranton, Ta, {Deo. 8), Correwondenee of the Xeio York
Herald .
What promises to ho one of tho bitterest con
tests that has yet been waged between labor and
capital in the anthracite coal-ilclds of Pennsyl
vania has been Inaugurated between tho Del
aware & Hudson Coal Company and its workmen
at Carboudale City. A few days ago tho Com
pany, through its mining bosses, issued notices
to some of tho minors and laborers in and
around Carbondaje, who hold land on its prop
erty by what is known as the squatters’ right,
that, unless they signed leases for their lots,
they would bo discharged from tho works. This
action on the pare of tho Company foil like a
thunderbolt among tho men, who look upon It
as a-luud of unjustifiable coup do main to rob
them of tho little homos, which many of them,
by upwards of forty years of incessant toil, had
created; and accordingly they refused to comply
with tho ukase.
The Company discharged several men, and an
indignation mooting was forthwith hold, iu
which resolutions wore adopted declaring this
arbitraiy conduct, aud volunteering to support
tho men who had boon discharged as long as
they woro out of employment. A committee
was appointed to wait on tho Company’s repre
sentative in this region with a view to a settle
ment of tho difficulty, and ho answered that tho
Company’s order should bo carried out regard
less ut consequences.
Tno men immediately hold another meeting,
and resolved to resist tho Company to tho bitter
cud rather than submit to a syutom of villauago,
or accept leases of tho laud, tho ownership of
which thoy claim by a squatter right of ovor
twouty-ouo years’ poacoablo possession.
I visited Carboudale this afloroon, with a
view to eliciting tho real facts in a contest that
has produced tho most profound state of fooling
iu this region. Carboudalo is sovoutcou miles
from Scranton, on tho Lackawanna lUvor, and is
tho oldest city in tho valley. It is built in tho
bosom of Lackawanna Valley. Tho bleak, black
lulls sloping up gontly east aud west of tho city
aro dotted hero and there with the begrimed and
miserable huts of tho squatters. Tho city itself
is a straggling concern, its principal street
boiug upwards of a milo in lougtb, and mostly
lined with irregular and old framo buildings.
Tho Court-House is a modest brick structure,
standing in tho public-square, and at a short
distance half a dozon churches, almost in a
cluster, lift their spires heavenward, while all
around tho city tho black coal breakers loom up,
seeming to loud their color to utoro and church
and spire.
About forty-flvo years before Carbondalo wos a
city, tbo Delaware & Hudson Coal Company hav
ing purchased that tract of land with a view to
developing its mineral treasures, found a groat
difficulty iu obtaining men to work in tho mines,
owing to tho extreme isolation of the place, as
well ns to tho dangers that presented themselves
at that day to men unaccustomed to work in tho
coal mines; accordingly the Company, through its
mining engineer. Mr. Clarkson, offered, as an
inducement to workmen, lots which they might
build huts upon and cultivate at will, free of
charge. In this way about SOO acres woro dis
posed of. Bomo men took merely spaoo enough
for a cabin, some one acre, some two, and some
ton, and so on. Tho busy hivo of industry was
soon started. Tho coal-shaft was sunk, tho
breaker erected, and out of an uninviting wilder
ness of morass and forest tho workmen brought
neatly tilled gardens, aud built up one of the
most thriving cities iu tho county,
Everything wont on iu harmony until sixteen
years ago, when the Company brought suit against
an obstreperous squatter, Sandy McDonald, for
possession of tho lot on which ho had settled.
After keeping tho matter before tbo court for
somo time the suit was abandoned, and Sandy
remained iu full and practical possession, al
though tho neighboring squatters of that day
subscribed liberally for him to defend the matter
should tho Company prosecute it further. Some
time afterwards Sandy sold his right to a Mr.
Noalon, of whom tho Company has since proffer
ed to purchase it. It is now worth $20,0(10, coal
included. Throe years ago the Company pre
vailed upon somo of its men to take leases, and
since that time nothing bus boon heal'd of tho
matter until a few days ago, when tho mine
bosses told several men that if they did not take
louses of their lots thoy would ho discharged.
Tho order was stoutly refused, and an organiza
tion of a Minors' aud Laborers' Beneficial and
Protective Association at once entered upon.
Already, iu a doy or two, 800 men have en
rolled their names. In a conversation with ouo
of tho oldest aud most intelligent minors iu Oar
bondalo to-day, ho said it was their intention to
unfold tho old flag of tho Miners’ Union again,
and chat it would bo successful this time, lie
added: “It is a hard thing to see men that for
ovor thhty years have strained bone and sinew
to build up the Delaware & Hudson Coal Com
pany and to build up this city crowded to tho
waif iu their old ago, when thoy are decropid aud
feoblo aud moneyless, and when tho times aro so
had.”
Tlio disputed property consists of about 300
acres and is peopled by about 3,000 persons, or a
littlo loss than one-third of the entire population
of Garboudalo. I understand that the Goal Com
pany is firm, and will use ovory moans la its
power to assert its legal ownership of tho land;
while tho moo, on tho other hand, aro deter
mined to hold possession under the squatters’
title, and to resist what they consider the unjust
and tyrannical measures taken by tho Company,
in threatening them with a general dismissal
from employment. Tho result threatens to bo
most injurious to Garboudalo, as tho placo has
uoithor manufacturing nor farming resources to
full back on. and is entirely dependent on tho
coal-works for its sopport.

achievement which would do honor to Hick
Turpin or Claude Duvsl, or oilier notorious
highwaymen, took place on the State lino of
Missouri, about thirty-live or forty miles south
of Kausas City, on Friday night last.
Moa&rs. Bryant and Chandler aro tho propric*
tors of a small country grocery and dry goods
store, located south of Qraud llivor and a fow
miles south of tho Village of Woslpolnt, Mo,
Thu store is a decent frame building, located at
tho cross-roads about half a mile cast of tho
Kansas Stato lino.
It was just as tbo shades of ovoning bad cast
a gloom over tbo prairies In tbo vicinity, when
two strangers rode up to tbo store. They woro
young men, evidently botwoou 21 and 28 years
o'OK'h one a fair cornploxiouod man wearing
**t»ht wbi«kors } tlio other, rather younger, bad
dark liulr and sported a mustache and board a la
imperial, lire oldest woro a brown chinchilla
ovurcoat; tho youngest wore a soldier’s over
coat. Both had their foreheads concealed by
common black felt bats.
Mr. Bryant was alone in tho store, tho evening
was cold and rather dark, tho nearest house was
several hundred yards away, Tho two youim
men entered tho store and walked up to the
stove to warm themselves. They entered Into
a pleasant and goasippy conversation with Mr.
Bryant, and appeared to bo acquainted with the
country. They ashed to sec some woolou scarfs,
and dually selected ono and paid for it and
turned to tho stovo. Mr. Bn ant proceeded with
his various duties in tho store, all tbo time
keeping up a careless and Jovial conversation
with tho two good-looking young men.
Mr. Bryaut turned from his shelves, whore bo
had noon busily engaged straightening up for
tbo night, when he found his face in very tin
comfoilablo proximity to two largo revolvers,
while tho smiling countenances of tho two
amiable young men had assumed a very bum
uoHs-like aspect.
*' Mr. Bryant, wo want all your available cash.
We must have it, or take something you value
still more dour. So shell out without uoisooi
delay,”
“ iiut I will not submit ”
“ Yea, you will," ropliod tho robbers, and In
another second tlio new woolon scarf just pur
chased was over his mouth, nud hia amis wore
booh securely pinioned. Ilia ovea wore then
shaded with a now shawl, and the two robbers
proceeded to rillo the moro. Thov first secured
the cash, amounting to about $400; then they
proceeded to select such articles of morelmudiso
as suited their fancy, manifesting both taato and
discrimination in their aclcctiona.
While tiioso gay and festive youths wore en
gaged in this questionable business, an old
lamior just dropped in to pass away n long
evening and talk over tho nows around tho stove
in tho cross-road store. Tho young men re
ceived him courteously, and took care of him
as speedily as possible by gagging and Blind
folding him, and emptying hia pockets of hia
wallet, his knife, several pieces of twine, a
buckle, and a few nails and some papers. Ho
was escorted to a seat beside Bryant, there to
silently study and wonder what next was to be
fall him.
Tills business was scarcely concluded when
two other fanners strolled into the store. They
wore welcomed by tho bandits, and seized upon
as legitimate prey. One of this last couple man
ifested his desire to go homo by starting to re
turn homo without leave. Ho ran a short dis
tance down tho road, whoa ho was stopped by
tbo persuasive iulluonce of a pistol-ball iu his
hip. Ho camo back under escort. Ho and hia
companion wore seated upon the counter with
tho other two, and their pockets rilled. Two
moro men straggled in separately, one of them
an Irishman. These wore successfully captured
aud niuionod, and six men wove ranged in a row.
helpless and uncertain as to their futuro fate. *
Tho robbers, having secured tho silence and
security of all their visitors, pressed into service
a little boy who “just dropped in,” and who was
employed iu and about tho store. With his as
sistance they proceeded to “go through” tho
store, manifesting taato and discretion in their
selection of goods aud trlnkols. Thov took an
abundant supply of cigars, tobacco, and whiskv.
fitted themselves out with now gloves, handker
chiefs, shirts, Ac. During this operation they
discovered a schoolmaster to bo among their
prisoners. Tho youngest took occasion to loc
turo him upon tho immorality of being out late
at nights, and its tendency to promote bud hab
its, aud advised him never to go abroad Into
again. The Irishman'was upbraided with being
so poor as to have only “forty cinla”in hia
pockets, which they averred was not enough to
pay for tho ropo to bind him with. The wounded
man was examined and pronounced not badly
damaged, and was made to stand up with tho
others.
Having satisfied their cupidity and placed
themselves outside of a respectable amount of
whisky, thoy then proceeded to arrange for their
departure. Tho prisoners wore escorted outside
tho stole, aud ranged iu a lino facing tho road ;
tho boy was pinioned and blindfolded, like tho
others, aud placed with them. Tho thieves then
led up their horses, and a third horse which had
boon ridden there byono of tho captured farmers.
The oldest of tho thieves thou addressed tho
prisoners:
“I want you, gentlemen, to stand perfectly
still until my partner is out of sight. I will
stay hero with you for a while. Tho first man
that raises a noise or attempts to got away, X
will shoot his head off. You must wait hero per
fectly still for two hours; if you don’t, I’ll make
meat of you."
One of the thiovos had already departed with
tho led horse. Tho last one walked stealthily
away somo distance, aud soon afterwards was
heard galloping away iu the direction of tho
Stato Una. The boy managed to get himself
loose from bis bonds and soon had the rest of
tho prisoners loose. But tho bold thiovos wero
far out of sight and hearing.
As soon as daylight dawned numbers of indig
nnnt citizens wore out on tho trail. Tho outlaws
woro trailed into the Indian Territory. It is
thought 'that thoy will bo overtaken ; if they
are, them will bo a sudden jerking of young
nocks with now hemp.

In a lecture recently delivered in Boston Mr.
John L. Hayes related as an anecdote of the
Revolutionary period the story of the whipping
which King William IV. received from a Ports*
mouth sailor-boy. Nathan Lord, afterward a
prominent shipmaster of Portsmouth, was a lad
on one of the privateers captured by a British
frigate. Quo day a young Midshipman came
near the prisoners, who wore having an airing
on dock, and spoke snooringly of u tho rebels.
Young Lord, being a lad of spirit, retorted : “li
it were not for your rank, air, I would moke you
talco bade that insult." "No matter for my
rank," said tho gallant, though arrogant, young
otllcer; “ if you can whip mo, you are welcome
to do it." Tho challenge was eagerly accepted,
and tho two had a regular sailors* sot-to. Tho
Yankee was victorious, and tho Englishman ac
knowledged himself beaten, and, shaking hands
with his opponent, said : “ You are a bravo fol
low : givo mo your natno and I will not forgot
you." At tho end of tho voyage all tho prisoners
with tho exception of Lord wore sent to prison,
Tho Admiral sent for him .and informed him
that the young Duke of Clarence, a son of His
Majesty George 111., tho young Midshipman
with whom ho had fought, had requested that ho
he sot at largo; that ho was at liberty to go into
any part of (be Kingdom, and that tho Buko hod
placed a £5 note at his service,
