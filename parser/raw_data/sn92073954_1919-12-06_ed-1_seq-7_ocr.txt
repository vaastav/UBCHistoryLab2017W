Rev. Dr. William II. Milton
The Rev. Dr. William H. Milton,
who is a member of the Joint Com
mission on the Episcopal Nation-Wide
Campaign, has been identified with the
movement since its inception. St.
James Parish, Wilmington, N. C,
where he has been rector since 1909,
released him temporarily at the re
quest of the Board of Missions that
he might head the Editorial and Pub
lication Department in the preliminary
organization for the movement. His
call came because of his reputation as
scholar and author, and because his
Church has become the largest per
capita giver to missions in the entire
Rnismnal Church.
Dr. Milton began his work with the
Church in 1892 as a missionary in
Nottaway and Lunenberg, Va. In
1894 he went to the Henshaw Mem
orial Church in Baltimore, and five
years later to St John's in Roanoke, Va.
The purpose of the Nation-Wide
Campaign is to arouse every member
of the church to its responsibilities and
nnnortunities in the present crucial era
of reconstruction; to send out 1500
worker that the church may ex
pand its educational, hospital and so
Hal service work at home and abroad.
More than one hundred thousand men
and women are workers in this tre
mendous campaign, -

that "the civilization of America can
not continue on endure unless organ

a direct endorsement of the proposed
legislation.
