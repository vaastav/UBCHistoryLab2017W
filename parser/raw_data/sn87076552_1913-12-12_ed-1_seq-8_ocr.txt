Washington, Deo. E. Declaring that
"oar army la to conserve the family
and the home," the antt-suSraaista,
before the bouse roles committee
ynade vigorous . protests against the
demand of the suffragists that the
' house create a special committee on
Woman's suffrage.
Mrs. Arthur J. Dodge of New York,
resident of the National aaaociatlon
opposed to woman's suffrage, declared
that the suffragists have numerous
hearings before congress., and that
their complaint cf unfair treatment
was unfounded. She says her organ
isation is comprised of organisations
in sixteen states and numbering 80,
000 women all of voting ate.
"When you consider that women of
oar class do not relish organizing you
will see that we have a remarkably
large number of women In this move-
. inent" she said. V
- Miss Alice Hill Chittenden, presi
dent of the New' York association op-
' posed to woman suffrage, declared H
was not within the power of congress
to regulate suffrage In the states and
that each state should be permitted
to work out Its own suffrage problem
without Interference from the federal
government. -Obtain
Standing Without Ballot '
"Woman has obtained the position
she holds today without the ballot,"
said Miss Chittenden, amid applause.
"We are jnot the women who sit quiet
ly beside the fireside knitting in the
twilight of another generation; we are
sot drones or parasites and we know
Fomenting of the problems of today.
Despite all that is said of the glorious
, economic independence of women, all
persons recognise the limitations of
women. Women may chafe and fret
under these limitations, but It would
be as useless to halt the stars in their
course as to prevent the natural phys
iological trend of the sex.
"We seek to conserve the home and
family life, where woman makes for
jrighteousness of the nation.' We seek
to make' woman man's helpmeet, not
bis rival, and competitor. We stand
finally for the conservation of women'!

VICTIMS DIE WHILE ASLEEP

Some Are Rescued by Firemen
Dlstaster to Be Probed.
Boston, Dec 6. Fire which de
stroyed the Arcadia lodging house at
1202 Washington street caused the
death of 27 persons on Wednesday.
This is the heaviest death toll ever re
corded In a fire In Boston.
Two persons were fatally Injured
while more than a score were slightly
hurt or overcome by smoke. There
were 179 men asleep in the lodging
house when the fire broke out
The flames spread swiftly through
the flimsy building and a number of
men, caught . on the upper floors,
leaped from windows. .
All of the victims were poverty-
stricken men, the lodging house being
15-cent-a-night affair, catering to
the poor. Many of them were home
less wanderers and for this reason the
authorities believe that the names of
all the victims will never be known.
The conflagration was attended by
many thrilling escapes. .Firemen
spread nets and Into these many of
the panic-stricken lodgers leaped.
One man wrapped a mattress
ground his body and jumped from the
fifth floor, the mattress saving his life.
The great rapidity with which lire
leaped from floor to floor caught the
lodgers and scores awoke to find their
beds hemmed In by flames.
There they clung as the flames
belched from windows beneath them
and crept across the beds they had
vacated to the sills of the windows.
Several narrowly escaped being
hurled from the coping into the street
in the rush for the ladders, which
fell Just short of the coping oil which
they .were clinging. The firemen as
cended as far as they could and
caught the lodgers as they jumped to
the tops of the ladders four stories
in the air.
Medical Examiner Leary, after an
examination at the scene of the fire,
declared; ' . '
"I am going at this matter with an
ax. This is one of tne greatest crimes
ever committed in this city. An in
quest will be started at once. I think
we have taken all the bodies from the
ruins. Boston has nearly a dozen such
fire traps. It is a crime -to allow them
to exist This building looked like
a slaughter house There is no good
excuse for such a condition of af
fairs.", ' . '"yV '' . .",,;

Washington, Dec 5. Government
officials were more confident than
ever Wednesday that the patience
which the United States had shown in
its treatment of the Mexican problem
was soon to be rewarded with a solu
tion. After a discussion Into which the
Republican leader, Mr. Mann, injected
the Mexican situation, the house

which went then to the senate. This
would put war volunteer forces on an
equal footing with the regular army.

and the president would appoint all
officers.
Renresentative Mann said that
Chairman Hay of the military commit
tee, the administration and all others
connected with the bill would deny the
measure was presented now, because
the government was preparing for a
war with Mexico; he recalled that just
before the Spanish-American war the
appropriations committee presented a
bill to put $50,000,000 into President
McKinley's hands.; '
'I took a minute then to say," addeM
Mr, Mann, "that at least there was
one man In the house who was not at
tempting to deceive himself while all
the others had said that this was not
in expectation of war, but to prevent
war.

now."

OSTOFFIGES IN
CITiESTOO SMALL
Unable to Handle Large Par
cel Post Business.
DRASTIC FEATURES IN NEW ACT
Supreme Court Holds No One May
Practice Medicine invOhlo Un
less Licensed by State
. Medical Board.
D. A. DONOVAN,
Special Columbus Correspondent.
Columbus, Ohio.
I
T is being revealed here that the
postofflce in Columbus and those
in many other Ohio cities are be
coming too small to handle the
volume - of business that has - re
sulted from the operation of the
parcel post In the future, and prob
ably the very near future, plans will
have to be made for a general en
largement of postofflce facilities.
Other states probably are experienc
ing the same difficulty, but it has be
come pronounced in Ohio early, be
cause of the quickness of Ohio people
to take advantage of the parcel post
system. The announcement made by
the postmaster of Columbus that the
new postofflce building, hardly two
years old, built at a cost of 1750,000,
is entirely too small to handle the in
crease In business, has been a stu
pendous surprise here. The general
public was led to believe when the
plans for the building were made that
it would be large enough to take care
of business for years to come. But
Postmaster Krumm goes so far as to
Intimate that within a very short
space of time -Columbus may have to
have an entirely, new postofflce build
ing. He points out incidentally that
In the past the government has been
giving more consideration to beauty
and ornamentation in the erection of
its postoffices than it has to space and
utility. The result is that a general
cramping of postoffices is confronting
the postal officials. .The city of Chi
cago, for example, that recently
erected a postofflce building that cost
millions is now compelled to use the
structure wnicn was used temporarily
while the new structure was being
erected.
- Drastic Features In Law.
The more the new license system Is
studied by the state liquor license
commission the more drastic does its
features appear. In the latest con
struction given its provisions the con
clusion has" been reached that if a
saloonist violates the license law he
may be forever barred from getting a
license or from being employed in any
capacity by a licensed saloonist
Joseph Tope, a Cincinnati saloonist, is
the rst to be convicted of a violation
under the license law. He pleaded
guilty to keeping open on Sunday.
The state board has advised - every
license board in the state of the con
viction. Every county board will have
a record of all convictions, so that if
a person is deprived of a license he
will not be able to go to another
county and obtain another license.
Saloonists throughout the state are
awakening to a realization that it is
certainly up to, them to - obey the
licensing laws to the letter. This calls
for shutting up on time at night and of
remaining closed all day Sunday. -Must
Have State License.

icine In Ohio unless licensed by the
state medical board was a surprise to
thef board . members, who were not
aware that the case in which the
board's authority has been questioned
had been taken to that court "Never
theless, we are much gratified oyer It,"
said Dr. George G. Natson, the secre
tary of the board, who has come to
be something of a terror to those who
try to evade the requirements of the
medical law. The decision will
strengthen the arm of the board. It
was given in the. case brought by
Laura Hobson McQuestion of Mans
field, who was graduated from a Cleve
land medical college, and who sought
to enjoin the boarti from prosecuting
her for practicing without a license.
The court denied her application. .

Apple Industry In State.
Something far more pretentious
than most people imagine is the apple
Industry in Ohio. It's worth some
where between $30,000,000 and $40,
000,000 in revenue every year. That's
a shade better than the wheat crop
can boast of and nearly twlce-as much
as can be claimed for the hog Industry.
And yet the modest apple never pre
tends to demand a third at the atten
tion that usually is lavished upon
other industries. Now comes a brand
new movement designed to boost

Epidemic of Smallpox.
For the first time in several years

cases of Bmallpox have developed
there. As a result of this a general

persojis presenting themselves for
vaccination will be given the treat

of his children won in this contest
No other family made such a showing.
The Gossan! children who won were
Margaret E., 18, who Is a sophomore i
at Wittenberg university, Springfield;
Robert, 16, and Jay, 14. Margaret
raised 99 bushels and 25 pounds of
corn on her acre. Robert raised 99.17
bushels and Jay 92 bushels. There
were no happier children than they
on the trip.- The Madison County
Corn Improvement association offered
the prizes won by Margaret and Rob
ert and the Stokes Township Corn Im
provement association gave the prize
won by young Jay. In each case the
prize was a free trip to Washington
on the corn special.
Girl Is Good Farmer.
Margaret is every inch a farmer, but
to look at her you would never sus
pect It. She plowed, harrowed, hoed
and everything else that must be
done in corn raising. She also husked
and then loaded the corn in a wagon
and drove off to town with It "I sold
It for 60 cents a bushel, but believe I
could have gotten more If I had held
off until later," said she. "I love
farming, and it does not seem to hurt
me any." And from her appearance It
would seem that this statement was
very true. Her hands' show no evi
dence of the hard - work ' they have
Bone. They are soft and shapely and
her fingers taper. She has a com
plexion .that any queen would envy.
When she reached ' Columbus in com.
pany with her brothers she was at

looked as If It came from Paris.
"I think every girl in the state
should give attention to farming,"
said Miss Gossard. "If they would I
am sure it would help a great deal
towards solving the cost of living! It
would also accomplish another thing
just as important if not more so. It
Would make them more robust and
give them an added interest in life. I
intend to farm all my life,"
. Find Love Letters In Pen.
One would imagine that in the heart
of those confined within the walls of
the penitentiary there wuold be little
place for amorous poetic fancies. But
not so. Clandestine love notes have
been passing between the men and;
women prisoners for some time.. A lot
of them have just been confiscated by
the prison officials, and never did
more overweening sentiment flow from
the pen of callow, unbridled 1 youth
than may be found in the scrawled
notes that have been ruthlessly read
by others than those for whom they
were intended. Incidentally, It : has
.been found that trusted penitentiary
couriers have been the carriers of the
secret mall. In the letters and the
replies the terms of utmost affection
are employed. Undying . devotion is
pledged and promised And in most
cases the sole basis for the romance
has been merely a -glance furtively ex.
changed during chapel service on Sun
day. These occasions " are abbut the
only ones when male and female pris
oners ever are brought in contact. But
they give rise to epistles whose au
thors vow faithful and undying pas
sion. The upshot of the whole dis
covery will be a great espionage both
over the chapel services and over the
clever postal system' that has been
operating behind the walls.' ,
Become Detectives Vigilant
The newly licensed saloonkeepers of
the state have become detectives vigi
lant In many cities they have con
stituted themselves as spies upon all
sellers of intoxicants that do. not hold
the coveted license. In some localities
they have perfected organizations to
employ sleuths 1 to spy upon drug
stores and other places suspected of
selling unlawfully. Up in Toledo the
licensees have banded together in a
cloce corporation. ' They have their
laws and bylaws and their various
mutual understandings. And one of
the agreements is that the law pre
venting free lunches, which up to this
time has been a dead letter, shall In
future be rigidly enforced.

Cleveland. Definite charges of
mismanagement of the Soldiers and
Sailors Orphans' home in Xenla,
have been placed In the hands of Gov.
James M. Cox by E. D. Sawyer of
Cleveland, former superintendent of

management of the Xenla institution -be
taken from the board of 'trustee
that has conducted It since its Incep
tion and be placed with- the state
board of administration, which man
ages all other state institutions.
: "Conditions at the Xenla home are
deplorable," said Sawyer. "At present
there are 190 employes and but 600
boy and girl residents. The 190 em
ployes include S4 matrons, about 80
teachers and the other officers andu
assistants. The per capita cost of,
maintaining the home is far above the!
figure that it should be. . While I was
superintendent I reduced the ' peri
capita cost $5.75 In the first eight
months and Informed Gov. Harmon
that it should and could be reduced
further (25 per capita.'' t i
Sawyer then quoted from the report
of. Examiner Bliss that turkey, chick

squabs, mushrooms, pineapple, fancy
cakes and other luxuries are foods of
almost daily consumption at the home.
"None of these foods is ever seen
on the children's tables," said Sawyer.
But they are purchased for the super
