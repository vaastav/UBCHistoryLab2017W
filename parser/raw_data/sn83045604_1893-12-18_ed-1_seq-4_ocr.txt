The president has behaved like a dic
tator In the Hawaiian trouble. The mani
festo issued thronch Willis to Hawaii on
the head of the Hawaiian government by
the president of the fnited States is en
tirely inexcusable. Mr. Cleveland begins
bis message with the assumption that his
Judgment is infallible, and, regardless of
Inte-national obligations, he accepts the
Occusatlons of Knvoy Blount as the whole
truth. Mr. Cleve.and did not wait to con
sult the sole depository of the war-making
power under oar constitution, but as
sumed absolute control.
The most that Minister Willis could do
constitutionally without the previous au
thorization of congress would be to offer
to the members of the Hawaiian govern
ment the friendly suggestion that they
should voluntarily renounce their func
tions and with their own hands restore the
queen. If beyond this friendly suggestion
Minister Willis should attempt to in
timidats the government which all other
nations bars recognized, he would be com
mitting an act of war; and if the president
was the author of such instructions he
would have broken bis oath of office.
If President Cleveland, moreover, he*
•ven authorize'! his minister to advise the
present Hawaiian government to commit
suicide under the threat that in the event
of resistance or delay recourse might be
had to the naval power of the United
States, then Mr. Cleveland has broken his
oath of office and committed an act of war
by assuming to exercise the war making
power without previously gaining the Au
thority of congress.
80 far as Itlount is concerned his name
was never sent by the president to the
senate for its consideration in connection
with any office. The senate has never ad
vised or consented to his appointment to
an office. Ho far as the statutes of the
Vnited .States go, he was a private citizen
when he was in Hawaii. In his capacity
as private citizen under the law he en
gaged in correspondence with a foreign
government which, in the opinion of some
of the most eminent senators who have
been considering the subject, is, within
the meaning of the statutes, "criminal."
It is asserted that Mr. Blount, not -hav
ing been an officer known to the law, and
riot having been confirmed by the senate
to any diplomatic office, or to an office of
any sort, in his communication with the
Hawaiian government comes within the
definition and the penalties of section
6.3Sft, United Slates statutes, in the chap
ter on "Crime against the existence of the
government."
If it taken the senate and the president
to make a minister one of them cannot
make an official greater than the minister.
This paramount commissioner hauled
down the American fls«j and sent the ma
rines to their ships. Then he reported to
Mr. fleveland that the revolutionists had
succeeded in dethroning the queen be
cause onr minister had landed troops
ostensibly to protect American prop
erty, but really to givo moral back
ing to the revolution, and on that report,
though denied by Mr. Stevens, by the
ratal commander, by the Hawaiian gov
ernment and by ail other credible wit
nesses. Mr. Cleveland decided thalltw.t*
cur interference all question"
which destroyed the monarchy, an l thst,
to prove that it was wrong, we must inter
fere attain. Thereupon lie sent out an
other minister charged to do a second time
what he says it WAS wrong and unlawful
to do the first, and this minister, arriving
at his post, discovers that be can not de
stroy the ssistint government and w«t?ib
)ish another in its stevl without interfer
ing "in the political or domestic »ff*ir« or
in the internal conflicts of the Hawaiian
islands." which Mr. Clevelandhas charged
his predecessor "tLe United Mates claim
BO right to do."
Minister Willi! seems to be a sensible
man who got bewildered trying t.»
stain from any manner of interference
with the domes t c concerns of the is.an N '
and at ths same tune tear down their c<>v
ernment and force on them a deposed
leer. No wonder he halted, aa a man of
Con mon sens#, And sent to Washington
City fir furt cr instructions. Neverthe

other government would have compelled

What fa the Inseet Pest That lafeats
Seattle Trerd
SEATTLE, Dec. 9.1588.
To THE KMTOE: In the issue of the
PoBT-IHTn.i.ioEX'KE of December 4, under
head of North west news, is the following
statement;
"The insect known in this state as the
cottony maple scale belongs to a different
species from the eastern scale and should
be differently named. It to never found
on the maple but clings to the bark of the
poplar and willow." In the first biennial
report of the Washington state board of
horticulture, pages 87 and 88, under the
head of '"Wooltoy Maple Bark Louse"
(pulvinaria innumerabiiis), is given a very
good description of what la known as the
woolly maple scale, also these statements:
"This infests maple trees, current
bushes and fruit trees." "They also at
tack the quince tree and current bush."
Again, a number of fruit trees in
several yards of both Tacorn a and Seattle
are infested with this maple scale."
The writer has searched in this city for
the woolly maple scale, and so far has not
been able to tind a single specimen which
answers to the description referred to, or a
single scale on any maple tree. Further,
on careful examination of maple trees the
oyster shell scale, J'omorum of
ltouche, is quite numerous on these trees.
In numerous yards of this city will be
found on apple and pear trees and on naw
thorne bushes a scale which, in the writer's
opinion, may have been seen hy the au
thor of the article in the report of the state
boani of horticulture and mistaken by him
for the woolly maple scale.
The insect so well described in a lit
tle work by H. Meade Bland, I'h. IX, en
titled "Entomological Excursions," pub
lished by Smith <fc Wilcox, Han Jose, 181>1,
as the cottony cushion scale, comes much
nearer to a description of the Aale here
under examination. We give here his de
scription in full:
"If, in the course of your rambles, you
should tind a tree upon whose branches
are (lusters of white scales, and if on
closer examination you should find these
scales move freely, that they have six legs,
that the head and body are cover*! with a
mealy or powdery substance, that the yel
lowish white portion is a soft cottony bag,
is an egg sack containing oblong ovate
eggs of a pale red color, you have found
the ravenous cottony cushion scale, which
is a representative of the mealy bug sub
family of scales. The female before spin
ning her egg sack is oval in form, her mar
gin la bordered with spinnerets by means of
w Inch she spins her egg sack, which con
tains from 200 to ."«•*» eggs, rarely TOO. Ihe
young scal»<iarva) *s darkly reddish in
color. Its an ten ii.* is six jointed with the
last joint clubbed and larger than the rest.
The legs are long and slender. The six
anril bristles are long and prominent,
standing on tubercles. When fully grown
the antenna of the female is eleven
jointed. She I»g<ns to spin her yellowish
white egg sack, becoming more and more
sluggish."
The writer has before him twigs cut from
apple, pear ami hawthorn, growing in
prominent gardens in Seattle, on which
are numerous specimens of ibis scale,
which shows it in d;f!erent stages of
growth, from the size of a pin point to an
eighth of an inch across. They are oval
and about two thirds as wide as long; the
center iine showing a ridge with lateral
slight ridges, covered with minute grains
of redish brown powder; the color is
lightest at the outer rim. On the under
side may be distinctly seen the four spin
nerets, two on each side. The sucker mav
a so bo distinguished near the center hr a
g v*i lens. Trie covering when carefully
c.cansed from the dark, internal tJeshy
port -n of the insect, ts transparent and
leathery. The legs are very hard to dis
tinguish, it j reeent on the samples largely
grown, but can 1-e seen as very thin, long,
hair-like on t!ie very young insects.
At this season of the year they all lie
dormant ard seem only to draw sap from
the tree a- i gr If, with a sharp knife,
apart of the bark is cut away onder the
li sect, a brow a riti£ w.ll be found, some
times several tin »s larjser than the insect
itself, which, according to John Sterling

The Xakah lad lams ■toesderaSaad the
>«w Sealteg Begelattees.
SEATTLE; Dec. 13, MBS.
To TOE EntToa: I notice in your issue of
this morning a dispatch from Port Towns
end to the effect that the Makah Indians,
of Neah bay, are fitting out a fleet of ten
sealing schooners to seal off the American
coast, and stating that the award of the
Bering sea tribunal in Paris was made not
to apply to vessels owned and manned by
Indians, because of their using tho spear
instead of rifles and shotguns.
The writer of the dispatch and the In
dians are evidently mistaken in tbeir
understanding of the Bering aea award.
The regulations prescribed by that tri
bunal, after prohibiting all aealing on the
American side of the Pacific ocean and in
Bering sea during May, June and July,
and within aixty miles of Pribilof islands
at any time, and also prohibiting the nse
of firearms in any portion of Bering sea,
proceeds as follows:
••Article VIIL—Tho regulations pro
scribed in the preceding articles shall not
apply to Indians dwelling on the coasts of
the territory of the United States or Great
Britain, and carrying on fur-sealing in
canoes or undecked boats, not transported
by or uaed in connection with other ves
sels, and propelled wholly by paddies,
oars or saiis. and manned by not more
than five persons each, In the way hitherto
practiced by tho Indians, provided such
Indians are not in the empiovment of
other persons, and provided that when ao
hunting in canoes or undecked boata they
snail not hunt fur seals outside of terri
torial waters under contract for the de
livery of the skins to any person."
From the above it will be plainly seen
that the exception referred to appliea only
to Indians hunting trom the shore in open
canoes or sail boats, and could in no way
be so construed as to cover sealing from
or in connection with the schooners men
tioned. WILLIAM HELIIEK LEWIS.
WORK ON MINING CLAIMS.
GOLPEH, Wash., Dec. 4, IM3.
To THE fcniToß: Your replies to the
various questions in regard to the taw of
suspension of work on mining claims for
1893 have been read here with Interest, but
there is a question upon which there is
much discussion which w« would like the
opinion of your valuable paper and will
cite a case. A and B have located a claim;
no work has been done on said claim. A
wishes to file his intentions to hold and
work said claim. B is a non-resident and
will not file his intentions to hold and
work his interest of said claim. Now if A
files in good faith and B does not, to
whom does B's interest revert? Must A
advertise B's out as if it were actual
work ? PEOSPECTO*.
(B has a right to exercise bis option
within the law. A must give B notice di
rectly, if possible, and then by advertise
ment. Much would depend upon the na
ture of the agreement between A and B.J

"Ail the Year Around" i# the title of
one of the prettiest small calendars to be
found in the stores this Christmas. It
is printed in colors from des.gos of J.
Pauline Sunter on heavy car board, gilt
edges. Hanging by its siivery chain and
tied with dainty white siikjcord and tassel,
"All the Year Around' 1 holds forth a
great enticement to look within and see
the twelve pretty sketches of the different
months. It is an exceedingly ornamental,
as well a# useful, holiday gift. Published
by Lee St Shepard, Boston. 50 cents.
Twelve fac similes of water-color paint
ings tied together by a dainty satin rib
boo compose "The Lueile Calendar,"
which is by far the richest and hand
somest of ail the holiday calendars. Every
lover of art is familiar with Thomas Mc
-11 vaine's portraits of the familiar charac
ters made famous by Owen Meredith. The
story of Ladle's life is made the story of
the life of a year. The subject 'or each
month is the fitting reminder of time and
nature's feelings. January brings the hope
ful, thoughtful faces of Lueile and Ma
tilda with pledges for the new year, and
on taming aside the first month the
Com t esse in her beauty stands guard o'sr
February, and so the month# psss by till
bleak December gazes upon ths calm,
sweet face of Sister Bersphine, looking out
from beneath the somber cover of the
nun's habit. "The Lueile Calendar"
would certainly be a most acceptable gift
for my lady's boudoir. It is published by
ths Frederick A. Stokes Company, of New
York, snd for sale by Lowman & Han
ford. Price, fLiSG.
Anothsr calendar, also published'by the
Frederick A. Stokes Company, of New
York, is quaint and picturesque. It is
shaped like a handsome silk Chinese lan
tern suspended by a siver chain. The lit
tle Chinese who makes his bow with the
first qusrter is a cute little fellow in all the
gorgeous babliments of the Flowery King
dom. The next three months are held
aloft by an umbrella sheltering a yonthful
Celestial from the April showers. Summer
and early autumn, three little Chinese
msids, will dirt with whoe'er they may,
while three horrid cranes drive the old
year out. For sale by Lowman ft Hanford.
Price, 75 cents.
Ths very name of Famuel Adams Drake's
Christmas book, "Our Colonial Homes."
takes one back to the days every true
American loves to hear of and read about,
therefore this book will be welcomed in
every library as an appropriate holiday
gift, A mere description of honses would
not be wholly impressive on account of the
lack of the human element. This Mr.
Drake has tsken into consideration and
has made his book exceedingly interesting
by connecting each house with the lives
and fortunes of its builder or occnpant.
In the Hancock house he tells the story of
that brave signer of the Declaration of
Independence and hints at his relations
with the Quincys, Adamses, Jacksons and
others. Mr. Drake has made of his story
a delightful history of the homes, lives
and fortunes of the men foremost in the
colonial times. Froth the press of Lee <fc
Shepard, Boston. Cloth, full gilt, |2.5C;
full leather, gilt edges and title, fLSO.
Handsomely illustrated.
In years passed many romances of lives
more or less famous have been presented
by writers to the world, bnt never before
has a writer endeavored to tell of the ro
mance of a school boy. This is the title
of a delightful book for boys by Mary A.
Denison. The story is prettily told of the
experiences of school life, snd the msny
types of boys to be found in every school
are faithfully depicted. The moral is
strong and well brought out. From the
press of Price, MagHl& Co.. St. Faul. For
sale by Lowman <t Hanford.
The twelve pictures of the Lueile card
calendar for IWtt, mentioned elsewhere as
the prettiest of all the new calendars, are
taken from a new edition of Owen Mere
dith's great story. These twelve pictures,
fac-similes of water color paintings by
Thomas Mcllvaine, would have illustrated
the text of tbi# new edition very well in
deed, but there are, besides, more than 100
vignettes and numerous engra/ings,
which, together with the handsomely il
lustrated cloth binding, make the book a
showy one, in which the artist has vied
with the printer. Undoubtedly this is the
finest edition of the famous poem ever
published, and the work is so very well
done that it will be long before another art
edition is attempted. Owen Meredith's
permanent fame rests upon "Lueile," and
nearly every one has read the poem. If it
were not so the publication of a costly edi
tion would be a risky venture. Those who
have admired the poem as printed in
cheaper form will be most enthusiastic in
praise of the fine pictures and clear print
ing of the volume here Ammended. The
book is Bxl2 inches in size, and has 122
pages, on heavy paper. Trice $3.50. The

The illiterate man who, after attending
a theatrical rendition of one of .Shake
speare's plays, declared that it was "full

Colndge's "Rime ot the Ancient Mariner"

is also tolerably familiar. The fame of
Coleridge is based upon "The Ancient

imaginative modern ballad in the English
language. It is also a modei of descrip

and remorse being perfect. The high

literature is etni hssized by the recent pub

Twenty full-pasre outline drawing by Sir

A doable holiday number for December
marks the comrlstion of the first volume
ot the School Rrrinf, nnbllsfced at Hamil
ton, X. Y. The number open» with a fail
report of the recent meeting of the Sew
England Conference of Colleges snd Pre
paratory Schools held at Sew Haven. The
report is prepared by Ray Greene Huting,
and contains the addresses of President
Enot, of Harvard; Prof. Barrett Wendell,
of Harvard, and Dr. Samuel Thurber, of
Boston, in complete for at.

the December numbsr sweeps over a great

The January, or holiday, number of
Stories is "prctuseiy illustrated and is
extended to 160 pages instead of the usual
128. Toe original story by Laura E. R:eh
ards. author of "Captain January," "Mel

of this number, which is reoiete with good
things. Among these shouid be men
tioned an extremely quaint and interestine

"The Davil's Mother-in-Law."

by "the character of its contents, renews
the promise, so amply kept in the first
volume, of being a magazine, not to buy

account by Mr. Arthur Warren of a visit
to Archdeacon Farrar, embracing much
interesting talk by the archdeacon on his
acquaintance with Tennyson and other
eminent men, on his wort, and on West

opens the number. Prof. Henry Drummond
relates the history of the founding and
progress of the Boy's Brigade, an organi
zation which is making a new earth for
the street Arab and other amended, or

present interest, perhaps, is a discriminat
