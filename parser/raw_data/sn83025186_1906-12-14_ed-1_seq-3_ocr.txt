Misunderstanding.
Apropos of a misunderstanding on
the canteen question, Gen. Frederick
D. Grant said at a dinner in Washing
ton:-
""If li" like the case of my friend
Maj. Green. Maj. Green said to his
servant one morning:
'James, I ,have left my mess boots
out, I want them soled.'
'"Yes sir,' the servant answered.
"The major, dressing for dinner
that night, said again:
'I suppose, James, that you did
as 1 told you about those boots?'
"James laid 35 cents on the bureau.
'Yes, sir,' said he, 'and this is all
I could get for them though the cor
poral who bought 'em said he'd have
given half a dollar if pay day hadn't
been so far off.'"
Unearthing the Briber.
During a recent campaign in Eng
land a certain woman called on a la
borer's wife and asked if her husband
would /vote for Lord Blank. "No, he
won't," was the reply. "But, remem
ber 'the blankets and coals you got
I from the clergyman." "Never mind
them. He's been promised anew pair
of trousers if he votes for Mr. Dash."
Suspecting. that this was a case of
bribery that must be outdone, the
woman canvasser offered a sovereign
If the woman would tell her who had
promised the trousers. The money
paid over, the woman smiled. "I
I promised them," she said, "and I'll
buy them out of your sovereign."
NO MEDICINE.
But Change of Food Gave Final Relief.
Most diseases start in the aliment
l%ry canal—stomach and bowels.
A great deal of our stomach and
(bowel troubles come from eating too
(mqc)i starchy and greasy food.
The Btomach does not digest any of
(the Starchy food we eat—white bread,
Epastry, potatoes, oats, etc.—these

Too much fat also is hard to digest,

Washington.—President Roosevelt's
message, describing conditions in Por
to Rico, and making recommendations
for legislation he believes necessary,
was read to the congress. It is as fol
lows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives:
On November 211 visited the Island
of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, cross
ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey
to San Juan, and returning next morn
ing over the new American road from
Arecibo to Ponce the scenery was
wonderfully beautiful, especially
among the mountains of the interior,
which constitute a veritable tropic
Switzerland. 1 could not embark at
San Juan because the harbor has not
been dredged out and can not receive
an American battleship. I do not
think this fact creditable tf» us as a
nation, and I earnestly hope that im
mediate provision will be made for
dredging San Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico, and the progress that
has been made under its admirable
government. We have just cause for
pride in the character of our represen
tatives who have administered the
tropic islands which came under our
flag as a result of the war with Spain
and of no one of them is this more
true than of Porto Rico. It would be
impossible to wish a more faithful, a
more efficient and a more disinter
ested public service than that now be
ing rendered in the island of Porto
Rico by those in control of the insular
government.
I stopped at a dozen towns all told,
and one of the notable features In
every town was the gathering of the
school children. The work that has
been done in Porto Rico for education
has been noteworthy. The main em
phasis, as is eminently.wise and prop
er, has been put upon primary educa
tion but in addition to this there is a
normal school, and agricultural school,
three industrial and three high
schools. Every effort is being made to
secure not only the benefits of ele
mentary education to all the Porto
Ricans of the next generation, but
also as far as means will permit to
train them so that the Industrial, agri
cultural and commercial opportunities
of the Island can be utilized to the
best possible advantage. It was evi
dent at a glance thitt the teachers,
both Americans and native Porto
Ricans, were devoted to their work,
took the greatest pride in it, and were
endeavoring to train their pupils, not
only In mind, but in what counts for
far more than mind in citizenship, that
Is, In character.
I was very much struck by the ex
cellent character both of the insular
police and of the Porto Rican regi
ment. They are both of them bodies
that reflect credit upon the American
administration of the island The in
sular police are under the local Porto
Rican government. The Porto Rican
regiment of troops must be appro
priated for by the congress. I earn
estly hope that this body will be icjj.h

any one year was that of 1896, when it
reached nearly $28,000,000. Last year,
therefore, there was double the trade
that there was In the most prosper
ous year under the Spanish reglwo.
There were 210,273 tons of sugar ex
ported last year, of the value of $14,
186,319 $3,555,163 of tobacco, and
28,290,322 pounds of coffee of the value
qf $3,481,102. Ur fortunately, what
used to be Porte Hieo's prime crop—•
ooffee—has not shared this prosper
ity. It has never recovered from the
disaster of the hurricane, and, more
over, the benefit of throwing open
our market to it haa not compensated
for the loss inflicted by the closing of
the markets to it abroad. I call your
attention to the accompanying memo
rial on this supject of the board of
trade of San Juan, and I earnestly
hopo that some measure will be taken
for the benefit of the excellent and
high grade Porto Rican coffee.
There ts a matter to which I wish
to call your especial attention, and
that is the desirability of conferring
full American citizenship upon the
people of Porto Rico. I most earnest-,
ly hope that this will be done. I can
not see how any harm can possibly re
sult from It, and it seems to me. a mat-j
ter of right and justice to the people'
of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they
are glad to be under our flag, they axe,
making rapid progress along the path*
of orderly liberty. Sutely we should)
show our appreciation of them, our
pride in what they have done, and!
our pleasure In extending recognition^
for what has thus been dotre, by grant
ing them full American citizenship.
Under the wlBe administration of the.
present governor and council, marked)
progress has been made in the difficuU
matter of granting to the people of the:
island the largest measure of self-gov
ernment that can with safety be givent
at the present time. It would have,
been a very serious mistake to have!
gone any faster than we have already
gone this direction. The Portoi
Ricans have complete and absolute
autonomy in all their municipal gov-i
ernments, the only power over them)
possessed by the Insular government:
being that of removing corrupt or in-,
competent municipal officials. This)
power has never been exercised savej
on the clearest proof of corruption or
of incompetence—such as to Jeopar-j
dize the interests of the people of the.
island and under such circumstances
it has been fearlessly used to the im
mense benefit of the people. It is not
a power with which it would be safe.j
for the sake of the island itself, to dis-j
pense at present. The lower house is,
absolutely elective, while the upper
house is appointive. This scheme is
working well no injustice of any kind
results from it, and great benefit to
the island, and it should certainly not
be changed at this time. The machin
ery of the elections is administered en
tirely by the Porto Rican people them
selves, the governor and council keep
ing only such supervision as is neces
sary in order to insure an orderly elec
tion. Any protest as to electoral frauds
is settled in the courts. Here again it
would not be safe to make any change
in the present system. The elections
this year were absolutely orderly, un
accompanied by any disturbance and
no protest has been made against the,
management of the elections, although
three contests are threatened where
the majorities were very small and
error was claimed the contests, of
course, to be settled in the courts. In
short, the. governor and council are co
operating with all of the most enlight»
ened and most patriotic of the people
of Porto Rico in educating the citizens
of the island in the principles of order
ly liberty. They are providing a gov
ernment based upon each citizen's self
respect, and the mutual respect of all
citizens that is, based upon a rigid
observance of the principles of justice
and honesty. It has not been easy to
Instill into the mind3 of people unac
customed to the exercise of freedom
the two basic principles of our Ameri
can system the principle that the ma
jority must rule, and the principle that
the minority has rights which must
not be disregarded or trampled upon.
Yet real progress has been made in
having these principles accepted as
elementary, as the foundations of suc
cessful self-government.
I transmit herewith the report of the
governor of Porto Rico, sent to the
president through the secretary of
state.
All the insular governments should
be placed in one bureau, either in the
department of war or the department
of state. It is a mistake not so to ar
