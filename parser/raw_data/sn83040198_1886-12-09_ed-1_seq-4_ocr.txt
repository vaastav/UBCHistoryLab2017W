BARTOH COUHTY DEMOCRAT
HTFICUl TAPES' Or BARTON COUNTY-
GREAT BEND. : : KANSAS
The President's Messagre.
The president's message to congress
: appears in the dailies of this week.
On such a document as this there is
always a variety of opinion. Those in
accord with the'administaation will
contend that it is an able document,
while those'opposed find many things
to condemn. The document is of
considerable length. But then, bo is
the Bible, and we have never heard
that urged agaimt the word of inspi
ration. To cover fully in a report to
congress all the .vast and varied inter
ests of this government requires con
fciderable space.
On the coinage of silver the presi
dent reiterates the position he assumed
in . the beginning ; that is, that the
coinage of silver should be stopped.
Western democrats, as a rule, will riot
endorse the position of the president.
However this may be, no one can
doubt the honestv of the chief execu
tive. This is a question upon which
lines are drawn "by sections, rather
than politically. The east almost
unanimously will applaud the position
of the president, while the west, demo
crats as well as republicans, will agree
with Senator Beck inclinging to the
cart-wheel dollar.
On the tariff question the president
puts hira'self on record as in full sym
pathy with his party. He calls atten
tion to the present unjust system and
Urcres congress to revise it. Democrats
throughout the union will hail these
utterances as a true exposition of the
jmrty faith.and they will go a long way
towards drawing thejparty lines sharp
ly on this issue.
The contest between capital and la
bor receives careful attention, and
congress is urged to provide the need
ed legislation.
It is impossible0 to review Che whole
message in detail Most of oui read
ers have read it and formed their own
conclusions. But ibis we will say, it
is an able and conservative document,
and will go far to confirm the opinion
that the people havef&rmed in regard
to the ability and sound judgement of
Mr. Cleveland. There is nothing
superfluous about it; the language is
clear and strong" with out any attempt
at eloquence or rhetorical finish, and
we are constrained to believe that the
unbiased public will pronounce t an
able state paper. .
S r
The coming Congress will be called
on to legislate" on some questions of
vital importance to the American peo
ple. First, the relation of capital and
labor must needs, now or later, be de
fined. The great and disastrous strikes
of the past must be avoided in the fu
ture. Congress touched this great
subject very lightly at the last session.
There was possibly some excuse for
this. Most of the members had never
devoted much thought to the subject,
and were therefore but illy 'prepared'to
propose wholesome legislation. But
ii!ow it is to be hoped that the country
will be treated to some wise legislation
and that both parties may vie with
each other in bringing aboutan arnica
ble adjustment of theootrouble between
; capital and; labor.
The tariff question will likely occu
rv a larffe portion of the time. This
is a party question, and is therefore
likely to be fought out on "party lines.
Certainly the (femocrats can well afford
to have thi3 subject agitated. Their
position will commend itself mcge and
more to the people as they cpme to
present system.
V Another great question is the Blair
educational bill. By its provisions
y 7,000,000 are distributed for educa
tlc hnal purposes to the various states,
ftcf fding t0 illiteracy in each. Se far,
this not been made a party ques,-
tioEediiM democrats oppose it. and
or arbite J .

edgeoste nA the xnnla of Kansas
regardless i Vf politics oppose this bill.

bffl0Htff;rcJiolQrfr ftesat fire3 into
kind
always
thought and still think it just and
right for a democratic board to give
the county printing to a democratic
paper. Mr. Roetzel was elected as a
democrat to the office of commissioner.
He represents a district that is over-,
whelmingly democratic, and a demo.
crat ought to be appointed in his
place. As to Col. Huttmau, we know
of nomore suitable man, or one in
whom the people reposa more conS
dence. He would make a careful
and conscientious commissioner, and
if the people of that district are cons
suited, (as should be done,) we be-
lieve he would be selected in prefer
euee to any man the Register would
name. The democrats .elected a ma
jority of the county commissioners and
they are entitled to them. Brother
Chapman is"a reasonable man and on
mature deliberation we think will
endorse what we say. The democrats
by election control the board and the
paper that fights the battles of the
democratic party in this county ought
to be made the official paper. In days
of "Auld lang Syne," the Register
received the, county printing at full
rates, and now since the millennium
has come and democracy reigns
triumphant over the1 fertile plains of
Barton county, let the saints inherit
their just" rights.
Again wej would suggest j2o our
readers that it is absolutely necessary
to close our old books between now
and January. We should like to re
tain every name on our books and we
again urge those" marrears to come
forward tindo settle. Th& amount is
small and it will not inconvenience
any.tthose o ving subscription to pay
it. he way to manifest your appro
bation pf the course of the Democrat
is to pay the subscription. If there
are any who disapprove our course,
of course they should pay; up the ar
rearage before ordering the paper
stopped. It shall still be our aim to
give our readers a souudly democratic
pape and, worat all times unceasing
ly for the prosperity of the town and
county. Several hav responded since
wefirst suggested this matte and .we
hope' we 'shall hare no occasion to
speak of She subject again9
,
The bondscarried botli in the city
and township, and now, by the condi
tions agreed upon, the Missouri Pacific
will be" here notjater than February
20th. .All along the Democrat has
been at$, Earnest advocate of voting
the bonds. We did this because we
thought j? woulS benefit the people
more thsgi jiounfc ofsaoney asked.
JousifijeeS ts! aa. abstract principle
we are opposed 6D the footing 01 bonds
to railrSads brtt in tbi instance we 4
had 40 vote ?)onds as s, measure of self
protectio.T4, If Great Beud had not
paid the amount asked some other city
woul&have pai& thst mucli or more
and secure ie ?oad. As it is are get
the iiad and the delii inciyreti is rot
excessively large.
W114, some of our brother ftemoerat
ic editors fell us where the ttext meet
ing c tL$ editorial association is to
be held? The last meeting was held
at Xyeavefivortn the day before the
democratic state con lintion me. No
doubt most e the craft will iemember
&tSery sJroug resolution passed-at the
last meeting respecting the distribu
tion of public printing by democratic
federal officeholders. At the next meet
ing it will be in order we presume, to
see hoj touch, regard has been paid to
this reasonable reque&S. Xt woul-i.be
well to agitate his subject aow in
order that avery" democratic journal
in Kansas gtiay b'e represented. tVe
nefid thorough organization.
We are glad to say to ouf readers
tha the Topeka petnocrat is alive and
prosperous. Now is the golden oppor
tunity for, the democracy of Kansas to
build up a great central organ. The
democracy of this paper is of the first
water, it is ably edited, it is not the
exponent of any clique or faction, it
is newsy and clean. Democrats in all
parts of the state wno -desire the daily
news, should subscribe for it
The St John Sun says that the
court house of that city, when comple
ted will be one of the finest structures
iji the valley. 0 We are glad to learn
of the contiuued prosperity of our
friendly neighbor and that her temple
pf justice, will honor the county By
the way, our court house is no slonch.
The latest addition to our exchange
list is the Pratt Register, published at
Pratt Center. The Register is demo
cratic in politics, and judging from its
appearance is well sustained. We are
glad to welcome the Register and com
mend it to the public as a first class
local paper.
