Death of Horace Greeley.
Since our last issue, Horace Greeley, late
candidate for the Presidency, died at the res
idence of a friend, near the city of New York.
Various rumors had been circulated, since
the election, in reference to his failing health
n body and mind, and public anxiety was
raised to a high pitch, when the news of his
death was flashed over the telegraph wires.
The cause of this event seems to have been a
general breaking down of health, from do
mestic affliction and tbe unremitting toil and
excitement of an unsuccessful campaign. His
funeral took place at New York city, on Wed
nesday, and was attended by the public offi
cials of tbe country generally, including Pres
ident Grant and others in high position at
Washington.
The history of Mr. Greeley’s life, it is truly
said, is intimately interwoven with that of
the great political parlies which have divid
ed this country for nearly a half century past,
and his character will possibly be estimated
from the different standpoints, with reference
to this, that each may occupy. His most en
during monument, it is everywhere conced
ed, will be the journal he conducted as chief
editor for so many years, and which has ex
ercised so great an influence on the destinies
of his party and the country at large. The
crowning act of Mr. O rceley’s life, his con
senting to become a candidate for the Presi
dency, as the exponent of Liberal Republi
canism and Democracy, hasentailed upon his
memory the burden of much criticism it
would otherwise have escaped- That be was
either the saint or the sinner he was repre
sented to bo during the campaign by his
friends and his foes respectively, it may easi
ly be doubted. That his position was a ques
tionable one, or rather that it was a grave
mistake on the part of tbe Democratic party
to have afforded him the opportunity of oc
cupying the position he did, events have pro
ven. Had he survived, his" future course in
politics would have been a curious study, to
observe how far he would have been able to
reconcile the elements that claimed to have
united in his support, if indeed he would have
directed his efforts in that way at all. His
last public utterances on the subject were, that
he did not feel himself fully in accord with
any of the political parties that now divide
this country.
The electoral vote of Maryland was cast
at Annapolis, on Wednesday, for Hon. Thom
as A. Hendricks, of Indiana, for Presidenti
owing to the death of Mr. Greeley—which is
the first lime the electors for the Presidency
have had to exercise their own discretion in
matters of this kind.
How to Treat the Epizootic.
The following mode of treatment for the
epizootic is recommended by Dr. George T.
Hays. It lias been used with great success,
we believe, in every instance :
PRESCRIPTION.
Powdered Slippery Elm, 2 oz.,
“ Ginger, 1 “
“ Saltpetre, (pure) 1 “
“ Rosin i “
Squills, 14 drachms.
Mix well and divide into twelve doses.
Three doses a day are enough in ordinary
cases ; hut when the horse is much affected
give a dose every four hours during the day,
and if lie shows symptoms of thc-luugs being
involved, add to the other ingredients one
scruple (30 grains) of Tarter Emetic. When
the lungs are affected, it may be known by
the deep hollow cough in the chest, and the
pain and uneasiness it gives the horse when
coughing; and if this should continue after
giving the powders two days, the horse must
be blistered behind the fore .leg and under the
brisket, above where the saddle girth would
go.
Horses thus affected should he placed in
the open air in the day time, where the sun
shines, and out of Hie wind, and protected
from the weather, and watered regularly and
often, if thirsty.
The powders can be given in wet oats,
or scald wheat bran, if his bowels are not
sufficiently open. Apples are one of Hie best
cooling laxatives, if lie has fever, if he is
cold, cover him well, but be very careful,
when you come to remove his covers, that
you do not give him coid. Sponge the nose
and Hie nostrils out every day.
We believe there will be no dropsy fol
lowing the disease, where these powders are
given, and a rational treatment pursued-
It would, perhaps, be best to have Hie pow
der* prepared by a druggist, when conveni
ent.
The President's Message.
President Grant presented his nnual mess
age to the U. S. Senate, on Monday. The
document is a lengthy one, bat is not remark
able for any brilliancy of thought or felicity
of expression. In its recommendations it is
singularly guarded and non-committal, the
President evidently recognizing his inability
to deal with the more difficult problems con
nected with the financial and business inter
ests of tbe country.
General Grant has failed in the opportu
nity to render himself popular, by recommend
ing, in bis message, complete and general
amnesty for nil past political offences. He
justifies bis action under the bayonet-election
and Ku Klux laws, in causing tbe arrest, by
military power, of pcacnble citizens, and
their incarceration in prison.
Taken altogether, the Message is uninter
esting and tame, and excited very little com
ment, favorable or otherwise, from the pub
lic press.
Meeting of Cong nKss.—The third ses‘
sion of the forty-second Congress commenced
at Washington on Monday. A resolution of
respect to Hie memory ofHorace Greeley was
passed by both Houses.
In the Senate Mr. Sumner made an effort
to press immediate action upon ids favorite
civil-rights bill, but fortunately under a point
of order it could not be taken up, Mr. Sum
ner also introduced a bill to strike from the
army register and regimental colors all allu
sions to tbe battles of the late war.
The session opened in an unusually spiri
ted manner, and a disposition was evinced
among the members to attend In business.
Local Affairs.
The Circuit Court.
The Circuit Court for this county met pursu
ant to adjournment on Monday last, for the tri
al of criminal cases, the civil and appeal dock
ets having been continued to tbe February
term. Messrs. C. J. Moore, Joseph H. Harkins
and James N. Nciper, having been excused by
the Court from serving as jurors, Hie following
were drawn in their places; A. P. McCombs
of the flth district, Joshua Whitaker and j
James Thomas Oorrell, of the 3d.
In his charge to Grand Jury, Judge Wat- j
ters called attention to the malicious destine- j
tion of properly and endangering Hie lives of
citizens, by the practices of parties on the oc
casion known as Hallcnv Eve night It is to
be itoped his suggestion will have the effect to
break up Hie dangerous spoils, if they may
be so called, of persons who make this annu
ally recurring festival alt excuse f.c depreda
tions on their neighbors.
Tlte following Stale cases have been dispos
ed of up to Hie close of our report:
State vs. Henry Dcpka ; indictment larce
ny ; stet.

Fire.—Ou Sunday morning last, at an early
hour, a dwelling house on the farm of James
Farnandis, Esq., near this place, was destroy
ed by tire. The house was situated near the
residence of Mr. Parnrndis, and was occupied
by John Brown, a negro man, with his family,
and used by him ns a boarding house for
some of the farm hands employed by Mr. Far
nandis. The fire originated in a wash house
immediately adjoining Hie dwelling, where a
fire had been built some time during Satur
day night, and it is supposed ignited from
the flue or chimney, and did not break out
until early in the morning. Brown and his
family had barely lime to make their escape
with a little clothing, and a few things lie
could remove at once. The building was in
sured in the office of the Harford Mutual Fire
Insurance Company for S7OO.
Proceedings of County Commission
ers.—During the sessions of the Board this
week John O. Stearncs was appointed Gene
rnl Supervisor of Roads in the slh District,
in place of Thomas J. McCnusland, remov
ed.
All persons having charge of sections of
roads in that district are therefore directed
to consult with Mr. Stearnes.
A pension of twenty dollars was allowed
to Sarah Wilson, in the 2d district, and one
of S3O to Margaret France and children, in
the 3d district.
The return of Examiners on the road from
near Emmorton to Winter’s Run, near Hol
lingsworth’s Mill, was taken up, considered
and rejected.
Adjourned to meet on Hie 23d instant, at
10 A. M.
Contribution Levied.— lt will be seen,
by notice elsewhere in this paper, that the Di
rectors of the Mutual Fire Insurance Compa
ny in Harford county, have ordered a contri
bution of six per cent, to be levied upon the
premium notes of the insured. This course
has betn rendered necessary, ou account of
the heavy losses incurred by Hie company
Hie past year, amounting, in all, to about
$20,000. The amount of losses unpaid is
about $13,000. The contribution levied will
produce about $12,000, which, with SI,OOO
now in the Treasury will enable Hie Compa
ny to reserve Hie entire amount of interest
in 1873 to future losses.

GEORGE.— On the 27th of November,

aged 20 years.
Thus called away in early manhood, the antin'
bio qualities he possessed (being naturally of re
tiring manners,) were perhaps not sufficiently
demonstrated to be generally appreciated by
those that did not know him well; but he was
concurrently accorded the unfeigned respect of
his more intimate friends, for the purity of his
motives and strict integrity of purpose. Un
compromising in his convictions of right; faith
ful to his promises; strictly honest in all his
dealings, and energetic in whatever he undertook
to do, lie won the esteem and confidence of all
with whom he had business transactions.
He united himself with thcM. E. Church at an
early age, and ills deportment as a church mem
ber and a Christian (as in business) was consist
ent and exemplary. He shrank from no Chris
tian duty, but was ever watchful in his devotions
and active in promoting the interests of ids
church, “not slothful In business, fervent in
spirit serving the Lord.”
Those Christian graces which so adorned his
character while in health, shone with uudirain
ished lustre, and encouraged and sustained him
in bis declining hours, and witli sweet peace of
conscience enabled him in joyful hope to look
beyond the things of time, and with quiet resig
nation calmly face the “King of Terrors,” with
out fear, conscious that in passing through the
“dark valley” ho was not alone; but the sweet,
consoling words he spoke to those around gave
to sorrowing friends the comforting assurance
that he is now enjoying that blissful “rest which
remains for the people of God.”
With fevers burned and racked with pain,
At trials I will not complain,
Nor question God’s behest.
For Oh! my precious Saviour knows
My longing for a sweet repose,
And He will give me rest.

the exposure of the attempts made Ly certain
unscrupulous local dealers to palm oIT their coarse astrin
gents, made from cheap and impure materials, in the
place of tiie great national lonic, Hostetler's Stomach
Bittern, public opinion Ims put strongly against these
empirics and their preparations. Their occupation is
gone, or soon will he. When the light is let into decep
tion it soon wilts down. Persons who trifle with their
i wu health, by using unknown preparations, with no
guarantee to sustain them, when un established epeciflc
proven by twenty years experience to be exactly what
it is claimed to be, is within their reach, are sure to ic
pent their temerity. Many have dune so in this instance
but it is hoped that the truth plainly spoken has arrest
ed the evil. In the meantime the demand i'jt the lead
ing protective and restorative medicine of America wa
never s.> great us it has been this season. From the fe
ver and ague districts of the west, south west, and south
it is literally overwhelming, and it may be said of the
advices from all parts of the country of the cures it is ef
fecting in dyspepsia, bilious complaints, and chronic
constipation, that “their name is legion ” Everywhere
the sick and feeble seem to have realized the importance
of “holding fast that which is good,” and of avoiding
what is spurious and dangerous.
The numerous “Hitters,” under various names, which
mercenary dealers endeavor to substitute lor Hostetler's
Stomach Hitters, should be avoided for their own sukes,
by the sick and the public at large, llostetter's Hitters
are procurable in bottles only, and never sold in bulk.
Masks and Faces,—Ladies who Hunk their face
and necks with enamels endanger their health to no
purpose. The plaster work deceives nobody. There is
but one article known which will restore a blemished
complexion or create external brilliancy and bloom
where they have never heretofore existed, and that ar
ticle is Hagan's Magnolia Halm. It performs this toil
et miracle by infusing vitality into ihe skin. The floral
and herbal juices of which it is composed gently slim
ulute the circulation in the minute blood vessels, and
brace the network of nerves through which they pass.
Thus quickened and strengthened the external cover
ing soon acquires a fresh and healthful hue, and every
trace of sallowuess disappears The palest cheeks de
rive from the beautifying baptism of this delightful cos
metic a warmer hue, and the arms, hands and i eck. a
blonde lustre which the charlatans, who piofess to make
ladies‘ beautiful forever" with their poisonous cement,
can never hope to imitate.

ANNUAL STATEMENT
OF THK
Board of
School Commissioners
vj
OF
HARFORD COUNTY,
For the Fiscal Year Ending September
80th, 1872.
In accordance witli Section T, Chapter
4, of the School Law, the Board of School
Commissioners of Harford county present
their annual Report and Statement, ns fol
lows :
The Board submit their Annual State
ment, with the hope that the accompany
ing Tables will prove satisfactory. It will
be teen from Table A there were 79 Schools
in operation, requiring 79 Principal and
8 Assistant Teachers.
The Sixth District or Havre de Grace is
marked as one School, one Principal and
five assistants.
The five distinct Schools, formerly in
that Town, occupy four rooms in the Town
Hull, and the Brick School House adjoin
ing, belonging to the Corporation, from
whom we rent the five Rooms, at $205 per
annum. These rooms have bedfi specially
fitted up for School purposes, and are well
adapted to the health and comfort of the
pupils. To the credit, and due apprecia
tion f education, we attribute the liber
ality of J. T. Frieze, John T. Wareham,
J. T. Fields, R. R. Vandiver, and the other
gentlemen, composing the Town Commis
sioners, for appropriating the rent paid by
the Board to them, to sustaining the School
in their town during the summer Term,
while the Public Schools of the county
were generally suspended.
It will be seen that the average daily at
tendance was 1,564, out of an average num
ber of pupils, on roll of 2,520, that is 960
pupils were absent daily. How to remedy
irregular attendance, is a question that re
quires careful consideration, which wc leave
to the wisdom of others. There were 8,560
different pupils attended School during the
past year. An increase of 47 on 1871, and
increase of 273 on 1870.
It is a sad reflection, that only 3,560 out
0f6,614 white children attended the Public
Schools, during the past year. If we allow
1,000 to have attended private schools,
academies and colleges, there would be
2,050 who do not attend any school, and
who are growing up in our county without
the blessing of a common school education.
What the State requires is an intelligent
citizen, as the citizens are sovereigns they
cannot exercise their sovereign rights and
privileges intelligently without education,
which the State and county proffers to
them.
The “good law,” as one of our journals
calls the law of the last Legislature order
ing a census of Harford county to bo tak
en, bas proved to be of advantage to the
School Fund. In 1371, the quarterly School
Tax distribution to Harford, was $2,707.33
In October, 1872, the distribution was $3,-
252.08—a gain per quarter of $544.75 ; gain
for three quarters 81,034.25. Add to this
tain of $218.95 on the School Fund—sl,-
48.20—which in nine years will amount to
$10,033.80. The July payment is irregu
lar. In 1871 it was $2,020.31; in 1873, $2,-
813.44—an increase of $787.28. But our
distribution does not equal that of 1868-
’09—53,920.42. We concur in the remark
of the Democrat! “Had all the districts
been correctly reported, the gain to the
county would have been $20,000 in nine
years. It will be perceived that the prin
cipal part of the indebtedness of the Board,
amounting to $8,846.06, is for new school
houses, repairing and furnishing. Bel Air
School House cost, $1 268.60, Aberdeen,
$1,261.50; No. 6, sth district, (Wilson's)
S9OO, and No. 16, sth District, (Stafford)
$940. Total $4 330. Of this amount sl,*
000 has been paid.
It is a source of inconvenience to the
Board, os well as to the Teachers, that the
Collectors do not make an effort to pay one
fourth of the amount in their bands quar
terly, in order that we may pay promptly
the quarterly salaries of Teachers. The Law
requires quarterly payments from the Col
lector*, yet it is neglected. If our County
Commissioners be as liberal in granting
the 15 cents Tax for the schools in 1878,
as they were in 1872, the Board will be
able to pay off the $2,287 of indebtedners.
and keep the Schools in operation the
four terms, as intended by our Legislators.
