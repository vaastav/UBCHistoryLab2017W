Once moro nn unexpected discovery hag
ntoppc.d the rotiHiimtnatlon of the contract
between tlio Union Pacific railroad and the
city of Oranha Just when It was about to ho
accomplished. With every arrangement
made by City Attorney Connell for the In
troduction of tho ordinance emhodylntf this
document nt Tuesday nltsht's mcctlnt;
Dt tho city council thhi latest complication
necessitate Us further dnlny.
Tho trouble Is a discovery by City Hnsl
boor Ilosowater that the property supposed
to bo transferred to tho city by tho railroad
In exchano for streets and alleys, amount
InR to 110 lots, Is not all that It at fir (it
appeared to ho. A distinct confusion bus
fcjocn discovered In ninny of tho so-called
titles and nbsoluto Invalidity In others.
Quit claims arc Klvrti to Omaha by tho
Union Pacific covering property which It
ilocs not own, nnd some of the disclaimers
avowed nro so conditioned that their ulti
mato result would be to contlnuo tho tltlo
In the namo of tho railway company, In
stead of transferrins It nB nurecd.
I'riiltnlily .tllNtitUcn.
It Jfl tho opinion of both City KiiKlnror
Kosowatcr and City Attorney Connell that
nil theso discrepancies uro merely mistakes
on tho part of tho railroad representatives
'and not Intentional errors. They think, too,
that tho cntlro affair ran bo satisfactorily
adjusted to tho city's taste, that tho rail
road will consent to all chants sUKijestod
end to all additional definition of technical
descriptions of property required.
Jlowovcr, till that Is donu tho contract
will bo held up and kept from tho council,
tlenoral (Solicitor Kelly of tho Union 1'aclflc
Vlll be tho medium of conference and ad
justment, and ho has not yet returned from
tho east, boliiK expected within two days.
It cannot bo moro than a week at most he
foro tho city leurns whuro it stands In tho
matter.
Mr. llosowntor mndo his timely discovery
last Friday. On Thursday Mr. Connell sent
him tho contract lor ilual checking tip.
Tho next day ho began tho scrutiny of tho
Itoms nnd quickly found that Homo of tho
property In lots which tho Union Pacific
protonded to transfer to Omaha was not
owned by tho railroad, tho quit claims
offered bolns mero farces.
Anothor discrepancy occurred In connec
tion with tho Missouri river levee, which
tho city Intends to keep. Thcro Iihb been
rtlsputo for many ycarH between tho two
parties over portions of this, nnd in regard
to this contract tho city lias Insisted from
tho ilrst that it bo given a quit claim to tho
district. In tho preliminary conferences
tho rullroad acreed to this, but balked when
it came to making out tho papers, falling
back upon a proposition to kIvo a disclaimer
Instead of u quit claim. In explanation of
this tho railroad mou united that they
lld not wish to glvo too many quit claims,
lor their people In tho east would think
that they wore- kIvIub uway too much prop
erty.
NtrliiK Tied to IMkcIhIiikt.
' "Wlion tho contract reached Mr. Itoso
Water, howovor, ho discovered that tho dls-
'clalmcr had n codicil attached. It pro
yldcd for tho exception from tho disclaimer
of that part of tho levco given to tlio rail
road by tho deed of 1SG3. Mr. Ilosowatcr
looked tip tho deed and found that U fiavo
tho Union Paclllo tho cntlro levee. This
wis conditioned upon tho mnlntonanco of
ihn terminal within 11 mllo and o half of
tho place. Later, however, tho supremo
court decided that tho terminal was in
Council llluffs, which Is moro than that dls
tnnco away, bo tho deed became void. That
was twenty years nco nnd now tho rall-
tjroad was about to rovlvo that deed.
Tho city cnKlnoor cites anothor oxamplo,
JTho railroad gives among others a quit
claim to Fourteenth street down through
(the main business portion of tho city. Mr,
Jtosowator Hays that It was In ISfiC that tho
road was given permission to bring Its
tracks up through that street. It nover
took advantago of this privilege, howovor,
nnd has long slnco forfeited tho right, tho
city's paving, building nnd other established
institutions along there constituting a prior
right. Just why tho Union Pacific should
wish to glvo n. quit claim to this property
Is dlfllcult to understand, In tho opinion of
Mr. llosownter, unless It bo to emphasize
tho Idea that It onco had a right In there
nnd thus to enhance Its privileges upon
North Fourteenth street.
Yesterday morning the grand Jury began
nn Investigation of tho charges of corruption
which members of the Omaha Hoard of
Education made ogalnst city ofllclals.
Robert Smith, member of the Hoard of
IMucatlon, asked some time ago that ho bo
given nn opportunity to appear before tho
grand Jury and tell what ho knew con
cerning the charges. Ho testified beforo
tho Jury yesterday. Louis Goldsmith,
tho owner of property In tho proscribed
district, was nlso summoned beforo the
grand Jurors. Jettlc Reynolds, Annie Wil
son anil several other women who have
houses In tho district were called yesterday
morning, but most of them were excused
and told that they will be required to ap
pear beforo tho grand Jury a little later
In tho session.
Tho Investigation of tho Sotith Omaha
school board by tho grand Jury Is assum
ing gigantic proportions. A score of ad
ditional wltnesicB, many of whom arc said
to live at distant points, havo been sum
moned. It Is reported that tho grand Jurors
will dispose of tho South Omaha Investiga
tion beforo taking up tho charges against
city olllclals of Omnliu.
"I havo not been snbponaed to appear
beforo tho grand Jury." Millard F. Funk-
houBcr. member of tho Omaha Hoard of
Education, said yesterday when asked
If he would glvo testimony concerning the
allegations of board members that city of
ficials aro taking monthly fines from tho
women In the proscribed district. "Since
the grand Jury wan first called I have been
expecting to bo called upon every day and
I will probably bo summoned beforo tho In
vestigation is completed,"

Zroiu Its promulgation nt that time nnd the

Local agents who nro opposed to tho en

postponement ns a virtual defeat of the

that, In their opinion, neither rule will

Less than n month will elapse between
tho completion of the construction work of
the Omaha Street Railway company for 1901
r.nd tho preparation for similar work dur
ing the year 1802. At this tlmo tho general
ii.ar.ugcr Is closing up tho work already
started. Crews aro nt work on Hurney,
Thirteenth nnd Cuming streets. It Is ex
pected that ns soon as this work Is com
pleted tho crews will bo laid off until
spring, but tho maatigcr says that should
tho weather contlnuo mild ho may work
for somo tlmo longer, opening up a block
at a tlmo so a storm will not catch him
with his tracks In bad condition.
The annual meeting of tho company will
bo hold Jnnu&ry 8 nnd nt this tlmo the work
contemplated by the company for 1D02 will ;
bo laid out nnd material nnd supplies Im
mediately ordered for such extensions nnd
repairs ns may bo decided upon. It Is
considered certain that tho first work of
any consequenco to be started In tho spring
will ho tho extension of tho Harney street
line on Thirty-third street. This lino was
ordered by tho board of directors this year
and would havo been constructed hut for
dolny on tho part of tho city nnd property
owners along the route.
Another extension which Is looked upon
ns almost certnm in oiucini circles is tnc
lino to Florence. Aside from theso two
lines tho present ofllccrs do not expect any
largo extensions next year, tho suburban
lines talked nf In tho summer having been
dropped for tho present. Considerable work
will bo dona In tho way of Improving exist
ing lines, but this cannot bo decided upon
until tho board of directors has investigated
tho matter. After tho annual meeting a
