Porter, fearful of tho pending confirma

" naner writings " aro ugly witnesses. He
therefore concludes to condemn himself

lude to tho Annual Address delivered be
fore tho Society, on the second day of the
Fair, by Capt. James K. Thigpen, of the
Reconstructed Fanner. lie now proceeds
to make amends for his previous inadver
tence.
The address was eminently practical in
its character and teachings, and to render
it thus was tho laudable purpose of it3 au
thor. Work, hard, unremitting labor, was
what he chiefly recommended to the farm
ers of the present day; and he endeavored
to impress upon them the wisdom of sound,
practical farming and tho necessity of ac
quiring its knowledge, and thus testing
science and reducing theory to its proper
usage. His estimate of a good farmer, ho
declared to be tho ono"who produces most
with the least labor, and at tho samo timo
adds to the productive qualities of the
soil." Tho practice of wearing out lands
and exhausting their productive qualities
vyas strongly condemned, and those farm
ers who clear land and annually take from
its fertilizing qualities, restoring none,
were declared to bo robbing posterity.
Some most excellent hints were given to
parents as to the manner of raising their
children upon the farms so as to fit them

Black Sea. The treaty ot I'aris, sigaea
March 30th, 1856. contains tha following
stipulations, made between Russia on the
one part, France, England and Sardinia
on tho other, Austria and Prussia con
curring :
' "AfiT. 7. Tha oontrtting parties declare the
8ablirce Porte to participate in all the advan
tages of internationil law aud the Europeau ays

waters and harbors are explicitly and forever
closed to war vessels of all nations, either ripa

Articles 11 and 19.
" Art. 13. Their Majesties, the Emperor of
Russia and the Sultan, bind tLem-elves not to
establish or maintain any arsenals or navy yards
on the Black Sea."
By tho articles 11 and 11), referred to
above, and by an appendix to the treaty,
Russia and Turkey agree to keep in the
Black Sea, net exceeding six email naval
vessels and four light steamers, exclusively
for coast service and revenue. Article 3
stipulates that each of the contracting
Powers, including France, England, Aus
tria and Sardinia shall bo allowed to keep
two small vessels at the mouth of the
Danube, all paid vessels to obtain a firman
or permit from the Ottoman government
beforo they can enter tho straits. The pre
existing treaty called the Straits Conven
tion " is maintained, closing tho Dardan
iinQ in all but Turkish vessels of war, in
time of peace.
The circular of Prince Gortsohakoff,
which now excites fears of a general Euro
pean war, takes the following ground.
The Emperor of Russia announces that
he will no longer consider himself bound
by the provisions of the treaty of Paris, so
far as these limit his sovereignty in the
Black Sea, because these provisions have
been repeatedly violated by the other par-
- i i:
ties. Among tnese vioianouu io iub
cruise of the Prince of Wales in the Black
Sea in an English frigate ; also a trip of
the same kind by Sir Bulwer Lytton ; the
appearance of an Austrian tquadron at
Varna Tt'llfifl the Emperor of Austria wa9
there on a visit ; then a recent trip of the
Sultan on board a Turkish frigate,
against which tho Russian envoy protested
in vain. Also the permission given to Ad
miral Farragut to enter the Dardanelles.
To these grievances, which are all more or
Iakh frivolous, since it is evident that the
sjririt of tho treaty was not violated, are
added more weighty considerations. The
introduction of iron clad ships unknown
and unforseen at the time of the treaty in
creases the danger of Russia. Then, the
" Straits Convention " allows the entrance
through tho Straits and into the Black Sea
of all the fleets of the allies of Turkey as

From Fair Bluff Two Supposed Out
laws' Gaptubjed. By a gentleman who ar
rived ;n the city last night from Fair Bluff,
we learn that two men were captured near
that place on Thursday, who are, with
good reason, supposed to bo members of
the Robeson county gang of outlaws. The
circumstances of the cam are briefly these:
On Thursday morning .these two men,
who are both white, entered a house near
Fair Bluff and began to mould bullets.
Both of them were heavilv armed, and on
being ordered from the premises refused to
leave, saying that they went where they
pleased and did a3 they pleased. Suspect
ing them to ba outlaws, a son of the owner
of the honso went into Fair Bluff and in
formed some of the citizsns tboro that a
gang of the outlaws was advanoiug on the
place. A callwas immediately made for men,
and a force was organized to meet them.
The expedition sat out and soon after
wards met the two men near the houso at
which they had been seen. These began
at once to retreat, and soon an indiscrim
inate firing was begun, but without re
sults. The outlaws endeavored to gain
the shelter of a dtnse swamp thut was near
at hand, and one of them, the larger and
elder of the two, suoceeded in reaching it,
but the other, a mere stripling, was cap
tured, toerether with a horse, and a white
child that ho was carrying.
On Thursday night the roads were pick
eted and iuformation having been brought
in that the escaped outlaw was at a certain
house a party started out to capture him.
Thnr wpm unsuccessful and a few of the
young men were returning home, when
the proposition was made to stop all night
at a house near at hand. This was agreed
to and the party halted at the gate and
gave the usual halloo. The result proved
that the outlaw had forced himself into
this very house, for as soon as tho call
was made he sprang to the door, threw it
open and began to fire on the party at the
gate. This was returned, when he sprang
down the steps and crawled under the
honse. A daring young man followed him
and soon succeeded in effecting his cap
ture although he neatly lost his life from a
pistol shot from the outlaw. He was taken
to Fair Bluff, and both of them are now
safely ensoonced in the jiil at Whiteville.
The younger of the two is uninjured but
the last captured was shot in the arm and
has also slight wounds in the head and on
the chest. Fortunately, none of the. citi
zens who effeoted the captures are: at all
injured.
Aa we eaid before, there is very good
reason for supposing these two men to be
of the Robeson county gang of outlaws.
It is presumed that they were out on a
reoonnoitering expedition at the time of
the capture, although the presence "of the
child is not easily accounted for. Their
statements are very conflicting, and every
circumstance is suspicions. One of them
claims to be from Virginia, and the other
from Maine. It is to be hoped mat tney
will get their full deserts.

Gen. Butler's speech
The war passage iu Gen. Butler's late
a m a i
Boston speech, now almost lorgouen,
largely attracted the attention of the
Southern press, likely on account of the
singular contrast between the honeyed
phrases of the speaker, in reference to the
Southern brethren," and the unrelieved
ruffianism of his career, when his power
as a satrap was unlimited. In the various
comments it evoked, one sentiment was
predominant scorn of the man and of his

utterances. From this view tne writer is
compelled to dissent. He has been too
long in the habit of observing the immac
late course of the Chief Justice and the
Associates to discard fair play, eyen when
thooonduotor rights of an unbeloved
personage are in question. The vexed
passage is not all rodomontade. If closely
examined it will be found to contain valu
able information and suggestions. Pohti
oal seers may ridicule the notion of a new
European embroilment. The authority of
a great republican, a Triton of tne min
nows," the physician that applied emolli
ents to the chafed spirit of Calacazy. gives
assurance that a war is approaching in
which the greatest part of the civilized
vorld will eventually take part. It is true
Butler only expressed a longing for war
with England, but considering his access
to the best eocrces of information, and the
came the objectu of his daring till they
had ceased to be the objects of his dread.
A man with such antecedents must have a
strong propelling motive for raising the
war cry, and lauding, in any way, the men
of whom, both in Congress and out of it,
he has been for years the most relentless
foe. His incentive to war with England,
he frays, is the perpetuation of Republican
ism for a generation. This is true in part;
for when the Republican party falls down
and breaks its skull, Ben comes tumbling
after, But his main incentive is spoons.

any other sphere. Now, since a lordly
mansion in li-nglaud boasts more spoons

the shadow of Bon's guardian pockets, and
antique metrical lore affirms that tho

a Shoddy of the Shoddies, perhaps may
set him up as a golden calf, at tho sacri
fice of tho generic cognomen, beast, to a
specific and un-alliterative designation.
Who then will dare to say that Butler is
not made of good metal? Spoon Knight
or Spooney will probably bo the title of
honor awarded to every one who di9
tinguishes himself in tho pantry raid.
The composition of tho B. branch ot
the invading force has now to be con

ly for the confidence you reposed in my
good opinion that this place could be
taken. To the Navy Department alone is
tho country indebted for tho capture of
this rebel stronghold ; for had it not been
for your perseverance in keeping tho fleet
here, and your constant propositions made
to the army, nothing would- have been
done. As it was, after the proposition had
been leceived,' and Gen. Grant promised
that troops should be sent, it was not done
nntii Gen. Buller consented to let the mat
ter pro on, and when ho hoped to reap some

Grunt the credit of mamrnrating tho cx-
nedition. when, on both occasions, he per
mittrt.l ifc to ?o iuiorooerlv provided. In
the first placj it had neither head nor tail
ns f:r fia the nrmv wav concerned. In the
second place he (Grat) sent too few men,
when he ought to have calculated that the
rebels would havo more t-trongly defended
tho works, after seeing what a narrow ee
capo they had. Nothing but the most des
l orate fighting und a determination to
win on tho putt of tho aimy gavo os the
victory. The gallant band of siilors who

shower of canister and. bullets, drew the
enemy's attention away from the assault

dnnt Fay this to detract from tho
gallantry of the soldiers, for never
did men fight harder or mora hand
somely than did our troops that day. Now
that tho mot important fort on the coitit
has been gained, us usual you will hear
but littli! of what tho navy did, an I no

take tho
credit when anything is doni', and equally
ready to lay tho Marat; of tho failure on
thn n.wv when a failure takes place, I feel
under no obligations for receiving and id-
lowing a report to bo spread from his!
headquarters that thero were thieo days!
when the navy might have operated and
did not. Ho knows as much about it as
he did when ho wrote to me saying ,,tho
only way in which tho place could be taken j
WiS by running tho ships past tho batter-;
ies." t-howiuK evidently that h had not

nounc? it a fabrication, for as t,uch I con
sidered it ; but as it purported to. bave

by a person who occi held a t prominent'
position under the Government I deter-, -mined
to ascertuin fully if I had ever.ln-; I
dited such a letter before hddressing'jcTl; '
on this subject. - - , - .
Neither myself nor ray c-corcdary, who -has
served with Lie eiht year?, conld re- .
call to our recollection J any- circumstance
of this kind. X could not conceive . I had J
uttered sentiment I koew I had nover
felt dad which arc so at variance with
thoso I havo uniformly expressed towards
you. Tho letter, it appear?, was a private
one, and vindictivo must have been the
heart of tho man that could bo guilty of so
gravj ii breao. i of coiiiiuoneo, and depraved
indeed must have been, the character who,
to gratify his mischievous intero-ts, could
make public a confidential loiter, written,
perhaps, under great cicitemeut, and at
this distant day not even remembered."
It seems liko a poor return for your uni
form contideuco anel kindness to me, and
I am too glad that I remember nothing
connected with tho . letter.
At about the dato of th letter I had
1 a 1 1 ? t l-
passeu lurouu a tog una intigaing con
flict with Fcrfc Fisher, and my numerous
fleet was almost overpowered by the ele
ments. -i.siWctho coveted prize wituin
my grasp, and then slip from me. . For
another month I had to battle with tho
storms of winter, anchored on nu open
oat, with the responsibility of that largo
iloet on my hands, my mind and bod' .
harasjod by extraordinary fatigue. Tho
whole nation was lDokiu on, e3rcitod, and
dreading failure.
It was under such excitement that 1 pre
sume I wrota the letter which you say has
made you lose your faith inhuman nature.
When several persons have ut different
time-? informed mi; that a It tier woald Lc
publi.died, in whi-.'h I had abused General
Grant, I trtated tho matter with indiffer
ence, thinking ii impossible tha', .such a
letter could exist. 1 do not write for the
purpose of exonerating iuys. tf. I would
rather bo the writer ot such a letter than
its publisher.
I regret exceedingly tho Iu-h of your
friendship, and do not he-it do t ) disap

not disposed to trust it altogether. I think
it mo-t unhandsome in h:.m to listen for a
moment to the idle talk of Butler s feiaii,

not doing their duty. The Lieuten-

of union between J. Tearson and tho Had.
Cab. (Qrst published in Russian Poland,)
which bond declares on the one part, that
law resides in tho swords of cut throats
raised in defiance of law, to commit un
lawful acts ; on the other, that the unjust
edicts of any ruler must alwaj override
both natural and positive law.
But it is in the material for the rank and
file that North Carolina soars above rival
ry. Bhe can summon to the standard of
Butler a corps of the scarred veterans who
covered thomsolves with glory under Kirk
and Bergen, in tho Caswell and Alamance
wars. Talk of the rapidity of Trusiian
conquests ! In a campaign of a few
days, these warriors, rusning wnn ir
resistible force tnrougn opposing col

forty thousand men, entrenched in
the deepest caverns of the earth, all the

The bataltions tuat ugureu in me samo

to prepare the adamant receptacle by dy
ini? before him. There must also be read,
every day, beiore tne troops, ineuew ooa jtcen montbs beforo yicksburg never had
to wait for me, nor did any ot his generals
(but I have had to wait for thorn), and ho
should have supposed from tho past and
my anxiety to go to work, that I had not
beccrno any elowerin my movevents than
I was on the Mississippi. Hi course
proved to mo that ho would rather f-acrifioe
his best friend than let any odium fall on
"Lieutenant General Grant. He will tako
to himself all the credit of this move now
that it is successful, when ho deceives all
the blame for tho first failure to take the
place. All this is now saddled on Gen.
Butler, and history will tell nothing of
Gen. Grant's share in it.
I tell it to you for your own personal
satisfaction that you may know and feel
that you are entitled to the entire credit
for getting this expedition off and for its
success. I am merely the agent and only
used to advantage the ample means placed
at my disposal, which any ono else could
have dona as well as I. I expect you
sometimes think I am a, little too impolitic
in what I sav. but that is my nature. I
am always ready to fight right away, if any
one reflects upon the navy. I know that
no country under tho tun ever raised a
navy as you havo done in the name space
of time, and that no navy ever did more.
Could the navy operate in James river,
Richmond would now be ours. Vicks-
burg, a stronger place, fell when tae navy
was brought to bear on it. Every place
has fallen where naval cannon have been
brought into play.
This is not a pet place with the Lieutenant-General,
and ho leaves it with about
seven thousand men, aud I don't think
knows much of tho situation. An army
man thinks if he has a gunboat at hia
back he is ail safe, but this in ono case
where at times the gunboats are driven off
by bad weather, and those inside cannot
coroperate effectively. I have given you
a long letter, but find an apology for my
self m the fact that 1 know your who:e
heart is in the navy, and that everything
poncernjng it interosta you. Again permit
me to thank you for the confidence you
have always placed in me, and tho oppor
tunities you have given me for distinction,
and assuring you that it has been my
warmest wish to merit only your appro
bation, I remain.

Ktptal of tlie Income 'i'u-v,
A demand for the abolition of tho in
come tax comes promptly into the 8enato
on the first day of its session. As a mat
ter of right, California leuiU tho column,
and Messrs. Colo and Ca3seriy, with n
friendly rivalry, have come forward each
with hia bill providing for tho abolition of
this imposition, fcinco tho adjournment
of Concres., at tho la?t semou,- as tho
Philadelphia Inquirer remarks, the mem
bers have been taught ccmo things which
are rather different from what their owu
ideas upon such- subjects had been. Upon
no other matter has ifc been m jro fatisfao-
torilv demonstrated that thev were no
hopelessly blind and wretchedly mistaken
than in regard to tho continuation of this
tax. They treated tho prote&t of tho
people ag.dnst that odioua burden as
unworthy of attention. They insisted that
the continuation of the tax waa foi tho
public good, and that it was folly to desire
its discontinuance. By this time they have
probably acquired some knowledge on tho
subieot. All of them havo been taught
very clearly what tho popular ideas are,
and some of them, among whom wo may
particularize Mr. Bchenck, havo learned
the lesson with sorrow. If they desire to
recover the favor which they havo lost by
their folly, they will hasten forward in tho
Senate, pass ono of the bills tho best ono
of Colo or Casserly. In tho llouso thero
onght to bo a contest to upset Mr. Schenck
and hia ruinous policy as soon as possible.
Let us get this impossition out of tho way
without delay.
