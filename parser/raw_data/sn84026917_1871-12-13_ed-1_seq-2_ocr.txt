OUR WASHINGTON UTTER.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec 9th, 1871.
After si* months of lethargy tad
stupid dolines?, this city has again as?
sumed its winter or Congress look of
liveliuess. Our sol?os met in coaocii
yesterday and after the usual prayers io
both Houses, proceeded to business. In
the .Senate the stump speaking chap?
lain, Dr. Newman, made a prayer io
which he alluded to justice overtaking
the Tammany ring, but forgot to state
whether justice was ou the track of some
of the rings of the administration, which
are equally as bad, if not worse than the
ring in New York, which was crushed
by the assis fan ce of Democratic Totes.
Senator Sumner's first words were oo
his old hobby, tbe negro, and after re?
lieving himself of nix months of silence
cn the subject of negro equality, he felt
better and subsided. Senator Blair be?
gan the war on General Grant by an
inquiry, as to recent suspension of the
habeas corpus in South Carolina. Mr.
Beck did the same in the House. The
appoictmeut of the committees io tbe
House was a mat. er of considerable
interest. The composition of the Ways
aud Means committee seems favorable to
a reform io the tariff. Dawes, chairman,
is claimed by the high tariff men. while
Kelley, Maynard and Roberts tre koowo
to be in favor of a high tariff. The free
trade men, are Brooks, Beck, Keer and
Fiokleuburg Burchard is looked upon
a* a moderate high tariffite, and bolds
the balance of power. As the adminis?
tration and the Radical party, as au
organization, are entirely in the interest
of the protectionists aud monopolists, I
cannot for ao instant believe that they
have in the most remote degree endan?
gered 'be interests of their friends.
You csa depend tfoa it, the aypareat
fairness of tbe selection of tbe committee
of Ways and Meaos is ooly a blind for
election purposes, ae>d not a desire to
reduce the profits of radical monopolists
a peony. The committee is "dead to
rights," as the detectives say when they
have a thing sure. So fur as a reform in
the revenue is concerued there is a de?
cided majority of this committee io ito
favor, and Heaven knows there is ?dire
necessity for it. Coosiderable curiosity
was manifested as to what disposition
speaker Blaine would make of his antag?
onist of last session, the Hon. Benjamin
Butler Blaine has dropped the afore?
said Benjamin from the Ways and Means
committee, and from the chairmanship
of the Reconstruction committee," and
placed him at the head of the unim?
portant committee, on the revision of
the Laws. This announcement caused
considerable merriment. Judge Poland,
who held this position last session, went
over to the somewhat surpri*ed and
much chagrined Butler, and congratu?
lated him on his recognition by the
speaker. When Butler retired to the
cloak room be said in a jocose way, *'the
bead of the table alter all is where the
Mc Nab sits, and it may be that this
rouud about way of snubbing one's ene*
mies is not so masterly as it appears to
be." Benjamin probably sees some way
of returning Mr. Blaine's compliment,
and is not disposed of so completely as
is thought. The President's message
ou some questions is shilly-shally, on
others very decided. The abuse of
Catacazy, the Russian Minister, re?
markably so. Grant always sticks to
his frieuds and relations. That is his best
hold. His brother-in-law is one of the
counsel for the Peikens claim, which is
against the Russian Government, and
which Catacazy has opposed. This
claim is considered a fraud by Catacazy
lt appear? that thc President, by letter,
a* a personal favor to himself, asked the
Czar to favorably consider this claim.
Doe? not the President back his friends ?
."ocia! difficulties have aggravated the
former difficulty, and the result is, the
Minister has been recalled tod a part of ,
Grant's annual message ts devoted to a
? overing up of his friendly designe in I
his brother io law's behalf, as well as
the entailing of Madame Catacazy by :
Madame Grant, Fish and others, who j
determined til at thia beautiful lady <
should nu longer reign in tho capital, aa .
une of Mir queens of beauty, aud leader? '
of the fa>hion. The Chronicle of thia ,

asked, "What's tb. matter with Hannah!"
When a friend gently said, "She is out for the

No sirs, yon have entered the wrong door. This
