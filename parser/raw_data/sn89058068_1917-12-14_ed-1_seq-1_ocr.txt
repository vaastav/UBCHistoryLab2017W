THE people are being taxed too heavily to
stand for their money being wasted, as has
been intimated.
THAT War Committee asked for by Repub
licans might have saved the Democratic
party embarrassment in the near future.
MR. HOOVER insists on meatless days. The
stock growers say this is bosh. Isn't it
time somebody quit lying?
MR. BRYAN bobs up to say that we must
fight like the devil. We could if we had
that army he said he could raise.
TW. PEACE'S hund-picked committe is hav-
ing to do some explaining, but it is of the
kind that will not wash in this section.
0 those papers that are whiningly advocating
non-nartisanshiD on the part of Republic
ans want to see the country as well as the party
disrupted?
E would like to see a tabulated statement of
the salaries being drawn by the various
commissions and committees now engaged in
winning this war.
THE Interstate Commerce Commission now
admits that it is about as incompetent as
that other fifty-seven varieties that have their
snouts in the public trough.
TF THE President's ' messages with regard to
price-fixing always have the effect on the
stock market that the last one did, he had
better cut that part of it out.
THE President, in his message, attempted to
prepare the country for a nice bit of graft
that is bound to come to the surface. Didn't
he pave the way for just such a condition?
THE necessity for money is always the para
mount issue with a Democrat He doesn't
always know what to no with it, economically,
but then there are always plenty of "deserving
Democrats."
TVfONE of the conventions held during the past
week even mentioned G. Cleveland's
name. Only Democratic president since Jack
son who showed that he had a backbone instead
of a wishbone.
THAT time-tried statesman, Gen. T. W. Peace,
is making a gallant race for Attorney-Gen-eral
so far. If, however, he should stub his
toe, the people will probably find a Haven that
will compensate them.
T IS refreshing to notice that "battle-scarred"
vftrfln or the Polk County News, assisted
by one of the once shining light of the late
"Nancy Hog Riflea," having something to say
about those who do or do not enlist. Very com
petent authority", indeed.

AFTER all, "high ideals" will not win this
war. Cold steel, shot and shell are the
only real "convincers."
SHOES you get now are just as eay to break
in, bnt they have a faculty of "breaking
out" that is rather suspicious.
AFTER what the President hinted about graft,
the minority party will be well within its
rights to go the limit in exposing it.
HAD the railroads been treated half-fairly in
the beginning, there would have been no
necessity for Government aid at this time.
GERM AS "over there" found out that Amer
ican engineers could use a rifle as well as
a shovel.- They'll find out other things, too.
DID that hand-picked committee perpetuate
itself in office? If so, sombody. has
a lifetime job, with all the emoluments pertain
ing thereto.
WONDER if Germany imagines that, after the
war closes, it can resume commercial re
lations with the world just as if nothing had
happened?
TF AS "high ideals" prevailed in the spending
of the people's money as are being handed
out as to why we are at war, there would be less
to question.
FOR an army that hasn't won a battle in three
years, that Hun outfit is doing remarkably
well. German stubbornness will just simply
have to "be shown."
THE edict having gone forth that the brains of
the country lie in the Democratic party,
the people would like to see something to sub
stantiate this assertion.
DID you ever see the necessities of life so
high under Republican rule, or the pur
chasing power of a dollar so low? Better think
about this when you go to vote.
THE New York Times says: "This was a poor
country until after the Civil War." Yes;
until the advent of the Republican party, which
made it possible for it to expand and grow as
no other on the face of the globe.
THOSE people who are willing to dig deep
down into their pockets to pay a war tax
that might just as well be paid by the foreign
manufacturer should keep on voting the Demo
cratic ticket. It's a sign of intelligence.
CAN Democracy learn nothing by experience?
Will the two years wasted before prepar
ing for a war of arms be followed by that same
time lost in preparing adequate protection for
American capital and labor providing it con
trols the next Congress?
1 F HE will scan our Archville correspondence,
General Peace may find something that may
interest him.
FROM what the President said about graft, in
his message to Congress, we take it that he
has been hearing something.
WHENEVER and wherever they they have
tried this price-fixing game, prices have
gone up. And the people stand for it!
TF THE Government takes over the railroads,
fails to make them pay, how long would the
present scale of wages remain in force?
WE notice the leather industry reports larger
earnings. Considering the quality fur
nished, we see no reason why it shouldn't.
THE more the financial situation is studied,
the more evident it becomes that the Dem
ocratic part is not big enough to handle it with
safety to the country.
TF THE boys at Camp Sevier ere not supplied
with ample clothing, these days, there is
bound to be suffering. We have heard that
such a condition exists.
THE financial capabilities shown by this Ad
ministration, are not such as to tempt the
people to turn the railroads over to them to be
used as a political football.
AYBE, when the Government has taken over
L tVi stppl. rnnner. iron, coal, sugar, meat
and other industries, there will be enough jobs
for all "deserving Democrats."
rHY, if somebody has been trying to hold
n-npral Ppxck nn. doesn't he prosecute
him as vigorously as he doos some poor devil
upon whom a pint of liquor has been found ?
A SPY in Germany is immediately put to death
without the formality of a trial, in many
instances. In this country, a prison with many
luyuries, is the punishment. Sentiment has no
place in war.
THE National Republican, now published at
Muncie, Ind., will be moved to Washing
ton in January. Those who like Republican
doctrine straight from the shoulder should be
come subscribers at once.
WE HOPE Mr. Gillette, the new minority
V floor leader in the House, will develop a
backbone that will lead him to investigate every
charge of graft that reaches that body. It is
the people's right to know where the money goes.
HE Wall Street Journal insinuates that "if
thp. nackers are so anxious to have their
excessive meat stocks reduced, they, can stimu
late consumption with the greatest ease." How
about a steakthe kind you got under Repub
lican rule and at the same old price?
