The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n - s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleli" means high t.arometrlc pressure and
is usually accomDanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result-

NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 7.-Speculatlon at the"
Stock Exchange was held in abeyance during the!
greater part of the day by the desire to defer
operations when the contents of the President's
message to Congress became known. Until the
details of the message became public property the
dealings were of a hand to mouth character and
were confined mainly to room traders. At the
start the sales were generally concessions from
Saturday's final figures Tobacco and Manhattan
were notable exceptions, the former selling off
16.^ and the Utter IV*. Tobacco was unfavorably
intlue.iced by rumors of fresh com pet! on and by
reports that a decision in the courts affecting the
charter of the company won d be rendered shortly
and would be adverse to the trust.
K!ior:ly nfter the opening General Electric rose
11/4 to 33% »nd Laclede Gas 234 to 25%. In
s mpathy with these movements the leading
shares improved y 8 to 1 per cut, but the advance
was soon par.ia ly iOsi. The really decisive move
ment of the day took place shortly before 2
o'clock, when the details of the President's mes
sage became k own in the street. The reference

movement in Sugar, which carried that stock down
from 11GB/8 to 115, the final quotations being!
1 1 &y 8 . The fact that the car Trust declared the
usual quarterly dividends on the preferred and
common «toe«; was ignored by the trading element
who sold freely all the way down.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lv., Dec. 6.— The market looked
quite discouraging to a holder of wheat this morn
ing. Scarcely a scrap of the news afforded him
any comfort, and to make affairs worse the price
on the curb was off iy«c from Saturday, so that
that much was a dead loss, without opportunity of
profiting by intervening quotations. The princi
pal source of weakness was the Liverpool market,
which declined 34 to Id. Supplementary influ
ences were reported, rains in India, heavy North
western receipts, 1048 car*, against 400 lust Mon
day and 1260 a year ago— an estimate by the Lon
don Times that the crop of Great Britain would be
0,000,000 bushels greater inau last year, an In
crease on the amount of ocean passage of 660,000
busnels.
Tne world's shipments were large at 80.037,000
busheln. Chicago received 36 cars and inspected
out 244,010 bushels. The visible supply decreased
2,602.000 bushels. The falling off was beyond
the most extravagant estimates, and yet the
prices were benefited but little. 1 The English visi
ble supply increased \ 610.000 bushels. Closing
Paris and Antwerp cables were unchanged to
higher. Berlin was lower. Export clearances
amounted to 622,933 bushels. May wheat opened
from 81c to 80<ygc, sold beiween dlfcßiy 8 c and
80c, closing at bO6/ 3 c, %@l%c under Saturday.
Estimated receipts lor to-morrow 240 cars. ■ No. 2
spot wheat ranged from 89c to t»o34c, closing
about 895 340.3 40.
CuR — .t could not very well be supposed that
wheat would break as hard as It did without drag
ging corn with it. The market for the latter
opened - weak, and under tbe effect of tbe dull
ness and the depressed tone of wheat was unable
to make much progress in the way of recovery.
Receipts were 296 cars and 285,991 bushels w*re
withdrawn from sore. The amount on ocean pas
sage increased 480,000 bushels. Liverpool cables
were quiet and unchanged. The visible supply de
creased 823,000 umhels. Export clearances were
liberal at 569,653 bushels. Ma' corn opened at
£6c, sold between 26VgC and 205-gc, closing at 26@
26V'gC. V's c under Saturday. Estimated receipts
for 10-m'orrow 500 cars.
OATS— As lower prices were prevalent in the
other grains, Oats naturally presented a declining
tendercy. Trading mainlined ltd reputation for
dullness, transactions being tew and insignificant,
Receipt-! were 211 cars and 160,802 bushels were
taken from store. The visible supply decreased
177.000 bushels Exports amounted to 63,629
busheia. May oats closed i/8ci /8 c lower. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow .->Bb cms.
FLAX— Was firm. Northwestern, 79c: Decem
ber, 76@76%C, May, 80@80S4c. Receipts wera

PROVISIONS— The first Information from the
yards to-day was of a weaker and lower bog mar
ket. Product opened lower on thai, bu later ad
vices of a full recovery at that p ace being re
ceived, provisions improved correspondingly. May
pork closed 2 1 ._>c higher, May lard a shade higher
and May ribs 2%c higher.
