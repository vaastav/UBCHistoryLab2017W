PLATPOHM OF PRINCIPLES
Adopted hy the Wisconsin Democrat/ ai
Madison, October 2, l£6l.
Resolved. That in the present National
crisis the rallying cry of all true men and
patriots should be “The Union—it must
and shall be preserved.”
Resolved, That we deny the right of any
State or number of States to withdraw
from the Union, and to relinquish their
obligations and allegiance to the constitu
tion and laws of the L’nited States, and
that the attempt so to Jo on the part of the
seceded States is in direct conflict with
the spirit and letter of the constitution,
and a blow aimed directly at the existence
of the government, which should be re
sisted v, ith all the power at its command.
That it has ever been, and ever should be
the policy of the Democracy to resist the
claim whenever and wherever assorted,
and to blast it with prompt and vigorous
action. m
ResohcJ , That the Democracy ever have
and still do, deprecate the agitation, both
North and South, of those sectional issues
which have distracted the country, and
that political policy which has asserted
the light of construing the constitution
and laws of the Federal Government to
conform to the views of particular States,
ignoring the fact that the constitution is
the supreme law of the land, equally bind
ing on the people of all the States, and
that it is susceptible of but one construc
tion in all localities. And we assert, that
although these sectional agitations and
constitutional interpretations, North and
South, have incited the impending war,
they afford no justification for the action
of the seceded Slates, and that the Union
and constitution must be preserved and
enforced in every State and Territory of
the United States.
Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit
manifested by all those people at the North
who seek to force the National Adminis
tration to abandon the policy which has
been sanctioned bv (lie Government of;
the United States in the conduct of the ;
war, and to substitute therefor the aboii- j
tion of slavery as its primary object, a- at |
variance with the very purpose tor which \
the war is prosecuted, and as incompati
ble with a complete restoration of the
Union of these States.
Resolved, That we owe it to those noble |
men in the Border States who are strug
olir.'i- to maintain the Government in
their respective States, as well as to our
selves, to erase fiym our statute look all
laws and resolutions that have been pas- |
sed which are at variance with the const!-1
tutlon and laws of the United States, and
are calculated to embarrass the Govern
ment in suppressing the rebellion. Wo
therefore recommend to the loyal people
of this Slate, that the next Legislature
be instruote 1 to repeal so much of the lb*
plevin and Habeas Corpus act as is in
conflict with the constitution and laws of
the United States; and also (o rescind
and amend “Joint Resolution relative to
the decision of the United Stales Supreme
Court reversing decision of Supreme Court
of Wisconsin,” approved March 9th, 1559,
and especially we recommend the repeal
of the last three claus -of sai 1 joint res
olutions, which rea l as lollows;
,l Resolved, That this assumption of jurisdic
tion oy the federal judiciary, in flic said case
[the Booth case], tnl without process, is an
act of undelogated power, and therefore with
out authority, void, and of no Dree,
“Resolved” Th it Government formed by tie
constitu*.io iof the United Sides was not made
the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the
powers delegated to itself; but that, as in all
other cases of compact among parties having
no common judge, each party lias a right to
judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the
mode and me -sure of redress.
llrs.Jvtd, That ihe principle and construction
contended for, &o„ that the General Govern
ment is the exclusive judge of the extent of lire
powers delegated to it. s‘op nothing short of
despotism, -inca the discretion of those who
administer the Government, and not the consti
tution, would be the measure of their powers ;
that the several Sta’es which formed the instni
ment 1 e’mg sovereign and independent have the
unquestionable right to judge of its infraction ,
and that a positive d'jimce of those sovereign
ties, of ad unauthorized acts done or attempted
to be done under color of that instrument, is
the rightful remedy.”
These resolutions, we believe, are ea!
culated to place the State of Wisconsin in
a false and inconsistent position before the
world ; we believe that they are uncon
stitutional, revolutionary and wrong, and
that they do not reflect the sentiments of
the loyal people of the State.
Resolved, That we are now, as we ever
have been, devoted to the maintenance of
the constitution and laws of the United
States, under whatever administration of
•he Government, and amid all dangers
that may threaten it. That in the An
gunge of the lament Douglas, “We should
never forget that a man cannot be a true
Democrat, unless he is a loyal Patriot,"
and that the words of our dying slates
man, to his children, “Obey the laws and
support the constitution,” are binding
upon all the children of America.
Resolved, d'liat we are in favor of an
honest and faithful discharge of the duties
devolving on the State officers, and ol an
economical disbursement of the public
funds; and we hereby declare that any
man who directly or indirectly uses his
office for self-aggrandizement or gain, is
unw rthv the confidence and support of
the people.
T he latent invention of which we
have heard is a chewing machine—in
other 1 UftUt i 11, .u •nd ...
i people and I 5 who cannot proper
ly u.a-ti.-ale their food. Such an article
is advertised in the London Lancet. It is
fastened to the dinner table, goes with a
crank, and is said to mince the food very
nicely.
The President’s Message.
The length of the Message, and its en
tire lack of interest,prevents us from taking
up the whole of our paper with it, to the
exclusion of more important matter for
our readers. In speaking of the Message
the Milwaukee Xtus says its phraseology
is not such as to command general respect
for his literary attainments, nor do the
views expressed by him indicate on bis
part the comprehensive ability which
should characterize the Chief Magistrate of
a nation of thirty millions of people.—
The message has been anticipated with in
terest, because it was supposed that it
would reveal the definite policy of the Ad
ministration in the conduct of the war. —
In this the public will, to some extent, be
disappointed. Upon the question of slave
confiscation, the President professes to he
willing to adhere to the laws upon the
subject already passed by Congress, or to
adopt any other course which may be pre
scribed by that body, lie oddly suggests
that slaves be received from Stales who
may hereafter confiscate them in Hew of
taxes for national purposes ; and that
measures be taken by Congress fur coloni
zing all slaves confiscated, together with
all free negroes. He recommends the ac
quisition of territory fur the purpose of
carrying out this project. His plan for the
disposal of the whole case is very much
like that of Senator Doolittle, who has
been of late much in the habit of harping
upon the propriety of purchasing a portion
of Central America, for the purpose of
making it a paradise for negroes from the
United States. Mr. Lincoln also recom
mends the reconstiaction of the Supreme
Court, and the creation of additional Cir
cuit Courts ; calls attention to the views of
the Secretary of War upon the subject of
an organization of the army upon a uniform
basis ; asks Congress to provide Chaplains
far Hospitals ; to provide fov a revision of
its statutes; to provide measures for ad
ministering justice judicially within in
surgent States; also that greater power be
given to the Court of Claims, and that the
old boundaries of the District of Columbia
may be restored. These rre the only
subjects mentioned, which are likely to
excite any special interest, if we except
questions already in all their aspects fami
liar to the public mind.
Asa whole, the message is not of a
character calculated to add much to
our national reputation abroal, or to in
crease confidence at home in the abilitv,
unity and decision of those at the head of
the government. The people in their pat
riotism, however, in the present aspect of
affairs, will only judge men by their acts
and their intentions, and will not fail to
lend the representatives of the government
all the aid in their power, in carrying the
national- struggle in which we are enga
ged, to a successful issue.
Tue Color of Turds. —Color is intend'
ed not merely for beauty. Ii is, in fact,a
mode of concealment, the most universal
if all meons of defence, and one that ap
pears in eveiy race of animals. As the
strength, the weapons and the velocity
arc all on the side of the pur-uer, color
is much mere resorted to for the defence
of birds than any other creatures. To the
partridge, the quail the woodcock, an 1 the
snipe, the likeness of the colors to brown
earth on which they move is such ns often
to conceal them from every eye, not ex
cepting the pierceing eye of the hawk or
the kite. The hovering foe may he obser
ved above during the chase, though the
victim has not escaped, deceived also hv
smaller birds, even when the accordance
in color is not great. Often do they shift
their position under the eye of the hawk
eager to pounce upon them, and stop, a*
if, as White says, “they knew the color of
the spot upon which they were cowering
and squatting was a sure defence.”
Coi.oukd Spectacles. —Many person?
who have wo.'k eyes were colored spec
tacles when they are positively injurious
On no account should colored glares be
worn on a dull day in the dusk of the
evening, or, a a general rule, in mild arti
final light, lie reason for such caution
in the use of gla-s s are, tl at the power
of the ere becomes impaired to endure
strong light hr accustoming them to the
ion of feeble illuminati ns.
Some persons who have <f.-!i ae organs
may occasionally employ spectacles of
light! v tinted glass for reading and writing
but they should *>e avoided if possible.—
Colored glasses are useful to protect the
eye from the brilliant reflection of snow
and the bright ravs of the oxyhydrogen
and electric light, and for this purpose
they should be a deep g'eep. Persons
recovering from inflammation of the eyes
should also use such glasses, but they
ought to be laid ari ie as soon as possible.
The eyo should be accustomed to endure
strong sunlight when not reflected from
dazzling surfaces, such as bodies of water,
white nd and snow.
Mourn not that you are weak and
humble. The gentle breeze i>. letter than
the hurricane, the cheerful fire of the
health stone than the conflagration.
