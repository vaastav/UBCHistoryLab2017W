in the federal couit at Baltimore.,

The evidence adduced was presented

The indictments charge that the de

enter into uniform contract's and that
all the defendfints refused ,to sell to
any jobber unless he would sign a
contract. The government' officialsa
took the ground that the evidence in
the civil suit established that the de
fendants attemlted to disguise their
,combination .by the-subterfuge of pur
chasing the patents on certain tools
and licening certain firms to use these
tools. The .government places great
weight ,on the teptimony of Edwin L;

TAFT STUI1SF
pPRESIDENT SENDS HI" ANNUAL
MESSAGE TO . TH TWO
HOUSES OF CONGiSS.
Tariff Revision by a Commission, One
Sohedule at a Time, Application of
Business Methods to A'dministra
tion of Affairs of Departments and
a Sound Conservation Policy Urged.
W1ashington, Dec. 6.-President Taft'
today sent his annual message to the
two houses of congress. The doc(u
ment is of unusual length and goes
into details in much of its discussion.
Following is a summary:
To the Senate and House of Rlepre
Senativee:
During the past d'ear the foreign
relations oP the United States have
continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
Arbitration.
The year has been notable as wit
nessing the pacific settlement of two
important internatidnal controversies
before the permanent pourt of The
Hague. i
The arbitration of the fisheries dis
pute between the United States and
Great Britain, which- has been the
source of nearly contlltfous 'diplomatic
correspondence since he 'fisheries con
vention of 1818, has given an award
which is satisfactory to both parties.
This qrbitratlon is particularly note
worth9 not ialy because of the emi
nently just results secured, but also 1
because it is the first Arbltration held
under the general arbitration treaty
of April 4, 1908, between the United
States and Great Britain arid disposes
of a contrvyersy, the, settlement of
which has resisted every other resource
of diplomacy and ,Nhich for nearly 90
years has been the cause of friction
betwee1n two cotuntries whose common
interest lies in miintaining the most
friendly and cordial reltions with
eacih other:
The United Stat t was ably repre
sented before the ; tribunal and I
should be wanting in proper recogni
tion of a great patriotic service if I
did not refer to the lucid historical
analysis of the facts" and the signal
ability and force of argument-six
days in length-piresented to the court
in support of our case by Mr. Elihu
IRoot.
The tribunal constituted at The
Hague by the governments of the
United ,States and Venezuela has com
pleted its deliberations and has ren
I dered an award in the case Of the
Orinoco Steamship company against
Venezuela. The award may be re
garded as satisfactory, since it has,
pursuant to the contentions of the
United States, recognized a number of
.important principles' making for a
judicial attitude in the determining of
International dispu'tes.
/ In view of grave doubts which had
been raised as to the constitutionality
t pf The Hague convention for the,
establishment of an international'
pirize,court, now before the senate for
Sratification, because of that provision
of the convention which provides that
t~ere may be an appeal to th, :;r.posed
court from the decisions of natiuo.al
r courts, this government proposed in
-an identia circular note addressed to
a thosq powers who had taken part in
e the London :iarltime conference, that
the powers signatory to the conven
tlin, if confronted with such difficulty,
mItght insert a reservation to the effect
d thit appeals to the international
Splgze court in respect to decisions of
ith national tribunals, should take the
form of a direct claim for compensa
tiqn;n that the proceedings to be taken
'ti tretlspon shotuMld be In the form of a
) trial '. noro, and that judgment of
-the court should consist of compensa
4 tlon for the illegal capture, irrespective
of, the decision of the national court
vwbiOse judgmenf had thusabeen inter
S ationally involved. As the result of
e gaI1 informal dicscussion, it was decided
tdo. provide such procedure by means of
1, a separate protocol, which should be
a tifl9tif s,. the same time is the prize
t- coiur t .i ention. itself.
e. coFdingly, the government of The
. N herlands, at the request of this
r govienment, proposed under date of
May .i 1910, to the powers signatory
s to the Hague convention, the neg
r, tition of supplemental protocol
moodlying stipulations providing for
this alternative procedure. It is grati
fyin¢ to ogsgrve that this additional
protocol is being signed without ob
jectioqL by the powers signatory to
.the original convention, and that there
if eveiy reason to believe that the
.internationai prizercourt will soon be
Iesta)pisbed.

FOUR DEMOCRATS FILE CON
TESTS AGAINST REPUBLI- '
CAN OPPONENTS.
Butte, Dec. 6.-(Special.)--It tised to
be sa.r.that,.a man lad tot spend a
year's salary to get elected to office
in 'Silver 'Bow county; ntw it looks
as if. he would have 'to' give the law
yers the best of the pay for the '
term, in order to get iid after being ,
elected. The democrats have insti
tuted four more election contests. Ella
Crowley wants the office to which
Mamie Burt, republican, was elected.
Jqe McGovern wants to take the place
of Gus Strommne, county commission
er-elect, and J. J. Griffin wants to
keep out Jesse P. Stevens, coroner
elect. '
Miss Burt had 140 plurality. Stromme 1
443 and Stevens 545. The other con
test 1i that of John MacGinniss, the
only democrat beaten on the legisla
tive ticket, against'Harry It. Stevens,
the only republican elected. Stevens
led MacGinniss by 108 votes.. The
grounds of contest are that in the
precints where machines were used,
the judges did not count from 15 to
20 votes each for the democratic can
didates, as they. should, have done. It
!s asked 'that one republican precinct
be thrown out because the returns
were not regularly .signed. The ma
'chines. have been in charge of the
county clerk ever since the election.
Another of the alleged illegal regis
tration cases, brought at .the instance
of the republicans, went by the board
today. It was against Jim Ruddy,
an electrician, who prov;'c: tl'at he had
beeui in lutte for years ijidl claimed
he registered from his' proper place:
When ~he testimon$ was concluded,
the county attorney consented kto a
dismissal of the case. The, couiity at
Sorney 'dnounced one of his own wit
nesses as an ex-convict and perjurer.
BROWN AND ,DARTMOUTH -
MAY RESUME RELATIONS
t Providence, R. I., Dec. 6.-An in
formal ballot on the question of re
newing athletic relations with Di.t
mouth college was begun today h10 the
students of Brown university,. It is the
opinion of many students that next
spring will see the two institutions
once more matched on the diamond.
f They have not met in any athletic
contests since 1907.
At a Brown-Dartmouth baseball
game' on AfldreWs field in that year
,an umpire's'decision which seemed fa
vorable to Brown started a dispute
f hich resulted in the captain of .the
Y Dartmouth team taking his team from
the field.

R[EYENGE IS AIIEGDIF
Gustavo A. 'Madero, Brother of the In- E
surrection Leader Says the Arrest
Is a Result of the Attempt of Presi
dent Diaz to Secure Punishment for
Alleged Political Offense.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The provisional
arrest of Juan Sanchez Azcona, once
a nmember of the lMexican congress,
journalist, member of a prominent
family in Mexico, was procured here
today by direction of the department
of justice, on representations made by
the Mexican government, declaring
that a warrant on the charge of ob
taining money under false pretenses
had been issued for him 'in Mexico.
No political significance. it was said
at the embasiy, attaches to the ar
rest, but Gustavo A. Madero, sup
ported by other friends of Ascona,
liere, charged that the "circumstances
of the cases are trivial, and that be
hind it all is the vengeful purpose
of the Diaz administration to get
possession of Azcona because of his
connection with on antl-Dian news
paper attack during the last three
years."
Friend of Madero.
Azeona is a son of1 the late Senor r
Azcona, former Mexican minister to 1
Italy, Guatemala and the Argentine
Republic. -ie came here November 21,
from San Antonio, Texas, where his
consultations with Flncisco I, Ma
dero, leader of the Mexican zevolus
tionists, were an open secret. He has
been associated here with, Gustavo A.
Madero, a brother'of. the revolution
1st leader. Azcona paid that the in
, cident in whisk charges have been
r tfflared nWitInatsht.r'oceerred .lfour
a years ago and that his part in the''
affair was merely as a witness. He
said that while manager of a news-,
e paper in Mexico City, many contitbu
e tions were received for the entertain-'
meat of the poor of the Mexican cap
ital. The funds were insuffclelnt and
iewere turned over to a committee of
d Women for diabursement among the
poor. .d • a
Will Pigjht Extradition.
Another newspaper, he said, charged
e that the money had been diverted
from the original purposes, of the
donors. Azcona dyclared- that after
due judicial investigation, In which
he appeared as a vvitness, the case
is as dropped.
Later he said he fpupded "Nuavo
Mexico," and began a series of at
tacks on the Diaz administration,
it which caused Its suppression' three
times and finally its conflscatlofi six
months ago. He, as its editor, was
if compelled 'to leave the coiintry. He
.y said he would fight extradition.
