Next Republican National Con
vention. To be Held at Chi
cago June I9th.
The Republican National Commit
tee, at lU meeting in Washington
City last week, decided to hold the
next National Convention in the City
of Chicago, on the 19th of June next
for the purpose of nominating Re
pablican Candidates for President
and Vice President.
The call for the Convention will be
seen in another place. By its terms
each State is to be represented in the
Convention by delegates equal in
number to double its representatives
in Congress, From each Congress
ional district two delegates are to be
sent, choeen in the same manner as
the nomination of a member of Con
gress is made in said district. As
the manner of nominating future
members for Congress in this district
has not as yet been settled it cannot
now be said how the delegates to
Chicago from this district will be
choeen. But tnis will be made known
as soon M the Committees appointed
in the different counties composing
the district meet and determine that
question. In whatever manner the
nomination tor Congress is made so
in the same manner will the delegates
to the National Convention have to
be chosen. Each county of the dis
trict, Mercer, Beaver, Lawrence and
Butter, will doubtless present and de
■ire to have one ofthe delegates. But
two only can be chosen—and in what
manner selected is, as we say, not yet
determined. If by the popular vote
system, they will be voted for in all
the counties. If by delegates elected
in each county, they will be chosen
at a district Convention of all the
counties. If by the old conferree
system, of three conferrees from each
county, then by said conferrees in dis"
trict Conference.
As the State Conventions bare,
under the call, to be held thirty days
previous* to the National one,this will
require our State Convention to as-
semble not later than the 19ch of
May next. Delegates to it will have
to be elected in this county. That
work will therefore hare to be done
in this,and all other counties, previous
to mid 19th of May, in order to be
represented in the State Convention,
which chooses the delegates at large
to the National one. Closely allied
therefore to this matter of date of the
State Convention js the one of the
Connty Primaries for nomination of
county tickets, which comes op every
fourth or Presidential year in this
form. And in this i 9 always involved
another question, whether to have
two Primaries or one. If but one,
then the county tickets will be
nominated at the same time the dele
gates are chosen to the State and Na
tional Conventions. If otherwise,
there would have to two different
Primaries, one for each object. The
coming political events of next year
will in time settle and arrange all
these questions
THE best thing President Cleve
land could do would be to call back
his late anti tariff message, just he
recalled his order returning the rebel
flags to the Sooth. He didn't know
that order "was loaded," and now he
must see his tariff message is equally
"loaded," and will, if not counter
manded, explode and blow him out of
the White House.
IN speaking of the anxiety mani
fested by the Democrats, concerning
the surplus in the National Treasury,
Blaine well observes "that it is easier
for a Government or SQ individual to
handle a "surplus" than it is to han
dle a "deficit." This will be received
as the experience of people generally.
That it is much more inconvenient to
have no money than to bare a little
too much of it, all men as
well as the "rest of mankind 7 ' will
readily accept as a fact.
TUE President has nominated Sec
retary Lamar to the vacancy in the
United States Sapremo Court. He
shonld be rejected by the Senate. In
one of Mr. Lamar's last speeches in
the Senate he declared that "no man
shall call Jefferson Davis a traitor in
my presence without my responding
with a stern and emphatic denial."
One of his first acts as Secretary of
the loterior was to order the United
States flag placed at half mast over
the Department on the death ol Jacob
Thompson, who tried to introduce
small pox and yellow fever into the
cities of the North during the war.
He is a nice man to place on the Su
preme Bench of the United States.
THE Mercer Dispatch-Republican
of last week has a timely article on
the effort being made to change the
mode of nominating Congressmen in
this district. It inclines to favor the
plan of electing delegates, which,
coming from the stronger county o(
the disUict, we regard as very fair on
the part of that county. It suggests
however that the delegates, in pro
portion to vote of each county at the
latest Presidential election, might be
elected by the County Conventions
of each, instead of by the people.
Better it would be, we think, to elect
tbem by the Republican voters of the
counties. But the urgent matter now
is for a speedy meeting of the Com
mittees of the different Counties, as
until this matter is determined it can
not be known in what manner dele
gates to the National Convention are
to be chosen. The one has to be
chosen in the eame manner the other
is. We have referred to this in an
other place.
THE NEXT NATIONAL RE
PUBLICAN CONVENTION.

taxes and prevent the accumulation
of the surplus in the Treasury in har

opposed to the attempt, now more
openly avowed than ever before, to

connt, the protection of every citizen
ot the United States in his legal
rights at home and abroad, a foreign
policy that shall extend

and the promotion of friendly and
harmonions relations and intercourse
between all the States, are cordially
invited to unite under this call in the

He Handles Cleveland's Mes
sage without Gloves.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7 —*The Trib
une's Paris corre3podent cables that
paper a report giving the views of
Blaine on the President's message.
Blaine said, to the Tribune represen
tative: "I have been reading an ab
stract of the President's message and
have been especially interested in the
comments of London papers. Those
papers all assume to declare that the
message is a free trade manifesto and
evidently are anticipating an enlarg
ed market for English fabrics in the
United States as a consequence of
the President's recommendations;
perhaps that fact stamped the charac
ter of the message more clearly than
any words of mine can.''
"You don't mean actual free trade
without duty?" queried the reporter.
"No," replied Mr. Blaine, "nor do
the London papers mean that. They
simply mean that the President hits
recommended what in the United
States is known as a revenue tariff,
rejecting the protective feature as an
object and not even peimitting pro
tection to result freely as an incident
to revenue duties."
I do not know that I clearly under
stand that last point," said the report
er- .
"I mean," said Blaine, "that for the
first time in the history of the Lnited
States the President recommends re
taining the Internal tax in order that
the tariff may be forced down even
below the fair revenue standard. He
recommends that the tax on tobacco
be retained and thus that many mill
ions annually shall be levied on do
mestic products which might far better
come from a tariff on foreign fabrics."
Blaine favors the repeal of the tobacco
tax He said: "I should urge that it
be done at once, even before the
Christmas holidays. II would, more
over, materially lessen the price of the
article to consumers of tobacco, to
millions of men, a necessity. The
President calls it a luxury, but it is a
luxury in no other sense than tea and
coffee are luxuries. The only excuse
lor such a tax is the actual necessity
under which the government found it
self duriug the war and immediately
following. To retain the tax now in
order to destroy the protection which
would incidentally flow from raising
some amount of money on foreign
imports, i 8 certainly a most extraor
dinary policy for our government."
"Well then, Mr. Blaine, would you
advise a repeal of the whisky tax al
so?"
"No, I would not; other considera
tions than those of financial adminis
tration are to be taken into account
with regard to whisky. There is a
moral side to it. To cheapen the
price of whisky is to increase the con
sumption enormously. There would
be no sense in urging the reform
wrought by high license in many
States if the National Goverment
neutralizes the good effect by making
whisky within reach of every one at
twenty cents a gallon. Whisky
would everywhere be distilled if
the surveillance of the government
were withdrawn by the remission of
the tax, and illicit sales could not then
be prevented even by a policy as rig
orous and searching as that with
which Russia pursues the Nihilists.
It would destroy high license at once
in all the States. Whisky has done a
vast deal of harm in the United
States. I would try to make it do
some good. I would use the tax to
fortify our cities on the seaboard
Never before in the history of the
world has any government allowed
great cities on the seaboard like Phil
adelphia, New York, Boston, Balti
more, New Orleans and San Francisco
to remain de;enceless t "
"But, said the reporter, '*you don't
think we are to have war in any di
rection?"
"Certainly not," said Blaiae, "but
we should change a remote chanceiu
to an absolute impossibility, our weak
and exposed ports should be strong
ly fortified. If to-day we had by any
chance, even such a war as we bad
with Mexico, our enemy could pro
cure ironclads in Europe that would
menace our great cities with destruc
tion, or lay tbem under contribution.'
"But would not our fortifying uow
possibly look as if we expected war?"
"Why should it any more than the
fortifications made seventy or eighty
years ago by our grandfathers when
they guarded themselyes against suc
cessful attack from the armaments of
that day. We don't necessarily ex
pect burglars because we lock our
doors at night, but if by any possibil
ity a burglar comes it contributes
vastly to our peace of mind and our
sound sleep to feel that he can't get
in."
Further, Mr. Blaine informed the
Tribune reporter that he "would
maintain the tax on whisky so long
as there is whisky to tax, and when
the national government should have
no uso for the money, 1 would divide
the tax amoDg the Federal Union with
specific object of lightening tha tax on
real estate. The houses and farms
of the whole country pay too large a
proportion of the total taxes. If ul
timate relief could be given in that
direction it would in my judgement bo
a wise and and beneficial policy."
Concerning protection to wool
growers Mr. Blaine said, "I should
seriously object to the repeal ot the
duty on wool. To repeal that would
work great, injustice to many inter
ests and would seriousiy discourage
what we should earnestly encourage,
namely, the sheep culture among
farmers thoughout the uuion. To
break down wool growing and be de
pendent on foreign countries for the
blanket under which we sleep
aud the coat that covers our backs, is
not a good policy for a national gov
ernment to euforce.
Attention is given in the report to
the subject of the increase of oar ex
port trade, Mr. Blaine asserting the
importance of this. He said, how
ever, "it is vastly more important not
to lose our own great market for our
own people in the vain efl'ort to reach
the impossible. It is not our foreign
trade that has caused the wonderful
growth and expansion of the Repub
lic. It is the vast domestic trade be
tween thirty eight States and
Territories, with a population of per
haps f.2,000,000 to day The whole
amount of our export and import tradi*
together has never, I think, reached
$1,900,000,000 iu any one year; our
internal home trade ou 30,000 miles
of railroad, 15,000 miles of ocean
coast, over the five great lakes u,jd
along 20,000 miles of uavigable rivers,
reaches the enormous auuuil aggre
gate of more than forty billions ajd
| perhaps, this year, fifty billions of
dollars. It is into this illimitable
trade, even now in its infancy aud
destiued to attain a magnitude not
| dreamed of tweuly years ago, that
| the Europeans are struggling to enter
jlt is the heritage of the American
people, of their children and of their
cbildrens' children. It gives an abso
| lately free trade over a territory near
, ly as large as all Europe and the prof
it is all oar own. The genuine free
trader appears a D able to see or com
prehend tbat this continental trade
and our exchanges with Europe is
the great source of our prosperity.
President Cleveland now plainly pro
poses a policy that will admit Eu
rope to a Bhare of this trade.
Congressional Views of the
Message.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 —After the
reading of the President's message in
the respective Houses, representati
ves of the United Press interviewed
a large number of Congressmen as to
their opinion of the communication.
The following are a few of the expres
sions of opinion elicited:
Senator Paddock (Rep.)—lt ia a
big card for the Republicans.
Senator Hiscocb (Rep)—We can
carry New York by the biggest ma
jority it was ever carried if they will
giye us that platform.
Senator Frye (Rep.)—lt's a good
enough platform for Republicans
We want nothing better.
Senator Spooner(Rep.)—A free
trade essay. I'm g'ad to see them
show their hand.
Senator Blackburn (Dem ) If
there is anything I don't want to be
quoted on its, this message.
Representative Heistand, Pennsyl
vania,(Rep ) —We can defeat that
doctrine by 100,000 majority in Penn
sylvania.
Representative Glover (Dem.)
Heard only portions of if, but I have
talked with many ot the Ohio delega
tion and they are against the message
because of the argument against tar
iff on wool. Without Ohio in accord
I fear but little can be done.
Representative Hovey, of Indiana.
(Hep ) —lt creates an emergency and
ignores the real issue before the coun
try —that of distributing the surplus
It will harm the Democratic party and
by ignoring the soldiers bring them
Bolidlv over to us.
Representative Fuller- of lowa,
(Rep ) —We can stand such as
that.
Representative McKinlev, of Ohio,
(Rep. )The issue is made. It is free
trade against protection, and will give
U3 strength.
Mr. Reed, of Maine (Rep)— The
message is certaiuly a surprising one,
but it. is not surprising because of
anything new in it. No
one familiar with the
monotonous misstatements of the
free trade argument needed more than
a word here and there to feel that the
administration had gone ovar to the
Carlisle wing with no disguise what
ever. It will be impossible for the
Democratic party to deny its com
plicity in the attack on American in
dustries, without disowniug the ad
ministration* The attempt at the
close of the long argument in favor ot
tree trade to declare the freee trade
question"irrelevant" would be a broad
jest if it were not in a State paper
To give fuller power to his declara
tions, the President has omitted all
reference to other things, remitting all
the manifold concerns of the govern
ment to a message to be given in the
future perhaps. To make sure that
the whole blow stiall strike full and
tair at American industries, he laudh
the interval revenue without excep
tions. No mention is made of sugar;
no mention is made of tobacco; oot
a word of alcohol used in the art; no
free raw material when produced iu
this country; only free raw material
when produced abroad. Surely the
message is a surprising one. But it
makes the very issue we have desir
ed.
Poor Mr. William Reed.
Some of our readers of this plaw
and in this County, will remember
Mr. Wm Reed of near Pittsburg, the
oil operator, who some six or eight
years ago had various enterprises in
the county, particularly near this
place in Butler Tp , and finally near
to what now is known as the Reibold
field. He was generally unsuccess
ful in all his enterprises here and left
considerably the loser. In October
last it seems be went to the Atlantic
Ocean, for some purpose, and while
alone on the sea in a small boat, was
drowned, or at least neyer heard of
until now.
The following from the Pittsburer
Chronicle Telegraph of Monday last
tells the balance:
WASHED CP BY TUB SEA.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J. Dec. 12
Patrolman Aaron B. Steelman, of
Life Saving Station No. 29, this
beach, discovered a body at au early
hour this morning on the strand.
It is supposed to be that of Wm.
Reed, the eccentric and wealthy oil
and iron prospector of Pittsburg, who,
with his mysterious electrical divin
ing rod, went to Somers' Point in
search of buried wrecks, supposed to
contain treasure, and was drowned
from a small skiff on October 21st.
Coroner Irving b;gan an inquest
to day. It is reported that a large
reward has been offered for the recov
ery of the body. A considerable sum
of money, jewelry and valuable papers
were found upon the body. Mr Ileed's
family at Pittsburg have been tele
graphed for.
Mr. Reed was in his 76th year at
the time of his death. He may prop
erly be called a native of Pittsburg,
because he was born only 15 miles
from t his city, over in Washington
county, auti came here while still u
boy.
Mr Lined has lived in Sewickley a
number of years. He was always
eccentric aud hid few intimates. The
last f«w years of his life was spect at
his home, where he entertained little
or no company He was tall aud
slim, but his form was bent and his
face, partly covered by a gray beard,
was a benevolent one.
Many a young man has received
charity at his hands, but his benefi
cence was known only to those who
received it. In years passed he has
furnished means to several theologi
cal studeots and has given mnch
money to church work He was an
elder in the Sewickley l T P. Church
Mr F C. Osboru this morning tel
egraphed to the authorities at Somers
Point to forward the body as goon as
pos-sible, and it is expected it will ar
rive here to morrow. 1 '
—The wool growers of the country
have held a convention in Washing
ton, Pa, their purpose being to at
tempt to raise the tariff on their pro
duct Statistics have been presented
showing that under the present tariff
the number of sheep has been reduced
from 50,000,000 to 44,000,000; that
the decrease iu the value of woolens
has been $38,000,000 auuually; that
the decrease in the revenue from
woolens last year was $51,000,000,
and that the total loss to the industry
ha* aggregated $400,000,090 This
is a showing iu which every farmer is
vitaiiy iutcreated, and especially so
wheu he remembers that the Djkio
cratie President favors not au increase
of the wool tariff, but the placing of
wool upon the free list, thns taking
from it even the protection it has now.

Oil and gas "leasing," has been

SOJOURNER
WE can hardly believe the reports
that come from Armstrong Co.; that
the Republicans of that County re
fuse to join with this one in regard to
changing the mode of nominating the
candidates for the State Senate to
which the two counties, as a district,
are entitled. This county has appoint
ed its committee to meet with a simi
lar one from Armstrong Co , to see
if a better, and more certain, way of
nominating candidates for the Senate
cannot be secured. The reasons for
this effort must be apparent to all in
each county who understand the situ
ation- But, outside of all other con
siderations,the fact that the two coun
ties are so nearly equal in their Re
publican votes, precludes any idea of
.advantage being gained by either of
ihem by the popular vote system, or
its equivalent. There is no other ob
ject in this county than to get away
from the old Conferree system, and
the possible following from it of ap
peals to the State Committee. The
Republicans of this county are unan
imous in their opinion to support no
candidates in the future dictated to
them by the State Committee.

Cherry Tp this Co , about HO yearn
ago, is back to see his old frieuds of

Rheumatism
We doubt it there is. or can he, a specific
remedy for rheumatism ; but thousands who
have suffered its pains have been greatly ben
efited by Hood's Sarsaparilla. If you have
failed to find relief, try this great remedy.
" I was afflicted with rheumatism twenty
years. Previous to ISS3 1 found no relief, but
grew worse, and at one time was almost help
less. Hood's Sarsaparilla did me more good
than all the other medieiuc I ever had."
11. T. Balcom, Shirley Village, Mass.
" I had rheumatism three years, and got no
relief till I took Hood's Sarsaparilla. It has
done great things for me. 1 recommend it to
others." Lewis Burbaxk, Biddeford, Me.
Hood's Sarsaparilla Is characterized by
three peculiarities : Ist, the combination of
remedial agents; 2d, the proportion; 3d, the
process of securing the active medicinal
qualities. The result is a medicine of unusual
strength, effecting cures hitherto unknown.
Send lor book containing additional evidence.
"Hood's Sarsaparilla tones up my system,
purifies my Wood, sharpens my appetite, and
seems to make me over." J. P, Xhoju*son,
.Register of Deeds, Lowell, Mass.
"Hood's Sarsaparilla beats all others, and
is worth its weight in gold." I. BAituiacxoif,
130 Bank Street, New York City.
