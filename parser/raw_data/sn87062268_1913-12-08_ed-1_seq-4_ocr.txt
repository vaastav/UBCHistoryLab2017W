Government Owned
Railways in Alaska
One of the most significant features
of President Wilson's message to con
gress was his recommendation for the
rovfrnment construction, ownership,
, and operation of railroads in Alaska.
'After characterizing that territory as
'. rich store house that should be un
locked, the president said:
One ky to it is a system of rail
ways. These the government , should
f"itsejf build and administer, and the
'ports and terminals, it should itself
'control, in the interest of all who wish
!to use them for the service and devel
opment of - the country and "its peo-
''p!o. : -
t But the construction of railways is
' only, the first "step is only thrusting
'the' key to the storehouse and throw -I
fnb back the lock and opening the door,
i How tempting resources of the country
'srs to. be exploited is. another matter.
' ;to which I shall take the liberty of
-rrom. time to time calling tout atten
'"'tlon,. for.it is a. policy which mu3t be
.Jjvorked out by well considered stages.
"not - upon .theory, but" upon, lins . of
i practical exr-eiiency. .it is part of our
general, problem of conservation. We
..have a freer hand in working out the
y probwm in Alaska than in . the sta-tes
.. f .the union, and yet the principle and
, object axe tUe..cni? wherever we touch
lit. "We must use. the resources of the
.. country, not lock them up.
. Noir what rank heresy is all this?
, . .To thltrtcthafa president of the United
States should so far forget -the special
Interest Influence which has always
dominated that- office as to actually
advocate the public control, of ports
, , , and terminals and the public owner
hip - of .railroads :, : " . .;' ... , . :
Does not Woodrow Wilson know that
. the success of such a policy'in Alaska
would lead eventually to the adoption
' of the same policy for the country at
: large? And if the government is to
. control the ports and terminals, how
. ,can the.L. & X.;' railroad and others
.like it' continue their present unfair
::n4 ruinous discrimination against
1 shippers at Pensacola and elsewhere?
More than that; what will railroad
officials who have been in the habit
of looting both the stockholders and
the public do for future, loot? The
recent failure of the great Fri3co sys
., torn and the scandals attending it fur
nish delectable evidence of the beauties
of private ownership and operation of
.. railroads. roes President "Wilson want
' to break up that order of things? Has
he no regard for the sacredness of
vested capital or the rights of oorpora
' tlon piracy? ' ,
-Evidently this president of ours has
no feeling for the people of "My. Dear
. Mr. Harriman" order. But , with it all
the people of the coutnry are likely to
. .look on him with approval. .
Working for Uniformity
of Road Laws. .
4 "As a result of the co-operation be
1 Jtween the . American Bar Association
-.and the American Highway Commis
sion, a definite effort is to be made to
previse the chaotic road laws of the
-.various states with a view to codifying
snd simplifying them and making
them more, uniform. The plan which
vHias been evolved is so comprehensive
that it is believci it. will eventually
result in a more uniform 'system of
-all laws, not merely those dealing with
road matters, but these dealing with
divorce, marriage, and all other sub
jects. A committee of the American High
way Association has been appointed to
take charge of the matter and this
committee it to meet with C. T. Terry
" ef New. Tork, who is chairman of the
committee on uniform legislation; of
'.'the American Bar Association, at the
. .Vanderbilt hotel on December 12. Tho
..."members of the American High way
Associations committee are F. E.
Wsdhams. of Albany, X. H.; A B.
Fletcher, state highway engineer of
California; A. X. Johnson, state higa
i way engineer of Illinois; P. T. Col-
, trove, president of the Michigan State!
" :";.Good Roads Association, and J. E.
' 3 Pennypacker, secretary of the Amer-
: lean Highway Association. Mr. Wad- i
bams is chairman. . j
It is recognized by the American
Highway Association that most of the
jToa d legislation in various " states is
antiquated and in many instances ob
" solete. Many of the road -laws are
y : one hundred years old. They are based
on colonial legislation, which, in turn,
"",had been based on ancient English
.' precedent. There Is very little uni
formity in the laws among the state
and it Ls felt that this fact puts ob
stacles in the way of those who are
.' seeking to give the entire nation a net
, ? work "of improved highways.
ro It is probable that as a result of the
f mittins io -held in. New Yprk,th.e
committee of the - American Highway
Association and the- representatives of
tfce American Bar Association will ask
the governors of the various states to
urge upon the legislatures the appoint
ment of commissioners who will codify,
re rise, and simplify the laws. These
commissioners wtrald work In conjunc
tion with each other so that uniformity
of the various state laws might . be
achieved.

carved the figurehead with a pocket

is a most interesting relic. Ocala

FLORIDA'S CAMPAIGN FOR
UNITED STATES SENATOR
Father of Progress.
John Stoctkon is said to be father of
progressive principles in this state.
Perhaps so taut we have been under the
impression that he was a disciple of
Wilkerson Call. DeSoto News.
Something Must Come.
When -a man of Senator Duncan U.
Fletcher's caliber gets behind a project
results of some sort Jiiuft come. The
fa.ct that hp heads so manv bis: move
ments for "the south ' holds out much
promise- for those who have pinned
their faith on him and the state is 1
proud to clai u a man of such national i
importance. A man is known by his I
ator is unusually well known. Hast

Stockton at Fair Grounds.
Mr. -John X. C. Stockton was greet
!n Stockton's Favor.
The Florida political tide seems to
be running stronger claily in favor of
John X. C. Stockton for the United
States senate, and indications are that
Floiida's original progressive will re
ceive an immense vote at the June
primary election. Sad to state, it often
takes a people many years to awaken
to the worth of a real patriot, but the
people of Florida seem to he awak
ening to th patriotism and worth of
Mr. Stockton. He will most assuredly
represent the land of Florida credit
ably in the greatest deliberative body
on earth.-St. Augustine Meteor.
Against Feuds and Factions. .
If Mr. Stockton wants to do his
party a real service, he can do so by
setting his face like flint against feuds
and factionalisms. There is no longer
an excuse for keeping ttp the spirit
of factionalism m this state. The
party is a unit on the tariffs a unit on
the currency and a unit on the presi
dent's Mexican policy so why should
the party be split in twain in Florida
by factionalism, which generally is the
outgrowth of small politics? Ocala
Banner.
Cannon Lumbering for Fletcher.
Big guns are beginning to boom in
the' senatorial contest. The Ku.tis
X,ake Begion is doing some heavy can
nonading for Senator Fletcher and the
Jacksonville Metropolis is extolling the
prowess and manifold virtues of John
"Xow Campaigning" Stockton. The
Courier -confesses slight leaning toward
Stockton, but it must toe admitted that
Florida has a senator of more than
average ability in Senator Fletcher.
ro very great issue is at stae, and we
refuse to slop over with enthusiasm
this early in the campaign. Plant City
Courier.
Indications Good.
John N. C Stockton, who is the can
didate for the United States senate
from all indications will sweep the
state. "e know of no man in Florida
who has worked more unselfishly to
bring about conditions favorable to
the people than has Stockton. For the
last quarter of a century he has fought
for principles that must be adopted
if the people are ever to get any relief
from the government that has been
used and is being used for the enrich
ment of the few. If the people in their
wisdom send John Stocton to Wash
ington, they will have a ma n there that
no man can tempt and that no man
can bribe. He has an honest ambition
to be United States senator with but
one aim in view, that is to. so conduct
himself in the public way that his
work will go down to 'benefit all man
kind. At the same time to give him
an honest fame. Let us elect Stockton

LOCAL BODY WAS THE MOVING
SPIRIT ARE CITED IN RESUME
ISSUED FROM SECRETARY'S OF -
FICE.
It is absolutely impossible i? a brief
article to mention all of the various
things done and matters considered by
the officers, directors, departments, and
membership of the Perisacola Commer
c'fl Association.
Therefore, only a few of those con-side-red
most important will be men
tioned below.
Transportation A successful cam
paign for a bond issue for municipal
cocks ana s neit rauroad was con
ducted. A favorable report on an in
land waterway between Pensacola. and
Mobile hays was obtained from the
engineers. And negotiations for im
proved Pullman service: also a day
light train on the L. & X. were insti
tuted. Manufacturing Much of the work
of the Commercial Association . has
been with a view to securing indus
tries for the city. Investigation his
been comp1eTd. to th extent that
the manufacturing resources have
been collected and tabulated, an indus
trial surrey is being prepared, and
steps are being takn to complete a
statement of rates from Pensacola
her trade points, in comparison with
Pensacola's competitors to those same
points.
Xegotiations have been conducted
with the owners of light manufactur
ing concerns and many have been in
terested, and some are making pre
parations to locate In Pensacola, In
cluding an iron manufacturing con
cern "endorsed by a citizens' meting on
Friday.
Agriculture The Commercial Asso
ciation has contributed financially and
through organized effort to the de
velopment of farming in Escambia
county; by exhibits at the Interstate
ive
We

F
fair, holding of farmers meetings; aid
ing in the organization of the Escam
bia County Crop Improvement Asso
ciation, which employs an agricultural
adviser for the farmers; in stimulating
local consumption through a public
market: b" endeavoring to xrare for the
farm surplus by organizing canning
factories and the formation of packing
centers for - the purpose of correctly
classing and packing farm produce.
Trade An attempt to improve trade
conditions along lines of credit has
been made by organising a Business
Men's Association: a credit reporting
service has been furnished; trading at
home has ben advocated. A successful
trade excursion "on the G. F. and A.
railroad was conducted.
Public Affairs Much work has been
done along educational matters, re
sulting in the organization of a .public
school commission which has made an
extended Investigation Into all school
matters, and completed their report.
I Medical examination in the public
schools and investigation Into sanitary
matters has been a result of the or
s-anzation of the public health commis
s'on, advocated by the Commercial
APFOciation.
Publicity A number of bulletins on
subjects of interest have been Issued.
A news bureau service 'has been furn
ished to something like SCO pub'isa,
tior., reachinsr some ten million reatf-
CTS.
Harbor Xew lights have been rvdded
to the harbor u-nd contiguous wa.ters,
on. the recommendation of the tssocia
ticri. Farther Improvement by the gov
ernment has een -Ldvocated. Including
the widening of the channel entrance,
dredging of thirty feet cf water along
the piernead line In front of the city
The Navy Yard.
Xavy Tard A epecial and extended
campaign has been conducted for the
reopening of the navy yard, tteginnlng
with ar. effort to create a sentiment in
th& north and west favoring the pro
tection of tho gmlf coast, by establish
ing at least, one first class navy yard
on it. This agitation has reflected it
self In many ways, but most substan
tially In the recommendation of the
board of Inspection for shore stations
of the navy department, as follows:
"In order to clear the way for the
building of an Isthmian canal this
nation went to heavy expenditure.
Is nort the nation equally Justified In
respecting the deep seated convictions
and sentiments of our own people by
giving them the coastal protection and
naval station that they are insistent
upon obtaining."
The Commercial Association pro
moted the West Florida State idea; ar
ranged for the making of a blrdseye
view man of Pensacola; secured sev
eral inventions; celebrated the com
pletion of the G. F. & A. railway with
many people present from Alabama,
Florida and some of the northeastern
states. .
Ban
Ch
ror
It is something tangible, and something that has a
distinct value to young people It means money in
the bank, a start on the road to prosperity and wealth;
it gives a feeling of importance to the possessor that
nothing else can give, and arouses ambition to earn
and deposit more money, to get ahead.
SAVING LEADS TO WEALTH
And wealth gives many comforts and luxuries denied
to those without money. Money that is hidden away
in variousplaces about the house can be made to earn
more money for its owner, and be absolutely safe.
Such money deposited in the savings bank is just that
much more money placed in circulation with an oppor
tunity to again secure it and double the account in the
bank which is alrcady earning money. Around Christ
mas time is a good time to think about what you earn,
and what you spend, with a view of starting a bank
account and thereby be in better circumstances before
another Christmas rolls around.
