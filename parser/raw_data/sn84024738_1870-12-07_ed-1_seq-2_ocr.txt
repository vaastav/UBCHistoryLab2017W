The President's Message.
We publish the President's messago in
fdll this morning. The comments which
we Indulged in yesterday we see no reason
for modifying. The Washington Patriot
commences its review of the message in
almost Identically the same word? we em
ployed in a like manner* It says, " the
"message sets out with a flagrant perver
'? *lon of truth.'* The President's recom
mendations are many of them good enough/
but his acts prove him to be a hvpocntc,
and therefore all his professions ???st S?
for nothing. For instance, in defining
policy of his Administration, he says that
one feature of it consist? In the " securing
"a pure, untramelled ballot, where every
44 man entitled to vast a vote may do so just
" once at each election, without fear of mo
lestation or proscription on account of
"his political faith, nativity, or color."
This language from a man who has sta
tioned soldiers near every voting place, and
done more to corrupt the ballot-box and
enable hirelings to vote a dozen times if
they please, than all the other Presidents
who preceded him, is an insult to the good
wnse of the people of this country. It
shows that the party in power is as liberal
in professions and as derelict in perform
ance as ever villains were. We have no
patience with such hypocrisy.
The President says the amount of taxes
has been reduced by some eights' millions
of dollars. It is also claimed that the
amount of taxes collected has been in
creased by a large sura. The two stories
cut one another's throats. The amount of
tax collected this year is larger than it was
last year. There i8 no getting round this
fact. It is another attempt to deceive, mis
lead, and humbug the voters to say that
the taxes have been reduced. The only
basis for the statement is the attempt of
Congress to reduce it by taking otf the tax
imposed upon certain articles and reducing
that imposed upon others.
The President is eloquent upon the sub
ject of tho acquisition of ?an Domingo.
We look upon his.recominendatlons in this
regard with no disfavor.
We approve of the recommendations that
the franking privilege be abolished and
postal cards be authorized. Tho latter will
be carried out ; tbe former will not.
We also endorse Air. Boctwell's part of
the message. It is in bis best style. Beast
Butler's contribution we heartily con
join.
BtJi enou^* would fain extend our
WOifflent* f>ut baVe not spacc Ior ulore 01

?v.-Refer
fgt m "* for
BE VIROJnU ELECTION La.
rlnsr to Lewis McKenzie's petty prete^v
questioning the right of Col. Braxton* to a
seat in tbe next House of Representatives,
and for the purpose of correcting any mis
apprehensions which might arise from the
manner in which the contest is spoken oi'
by the Radical papers", we elate that the
Virginia election law is as liberal in the
matter of contested elections as language
could make It. It provides* tint in judging
of all contested elections "the court shall
proceed upon the merits thereof." Tliis is
now. and has been for nearly twenty years,
the law of Virginia in regard to contested
elections ; and every lawyer knows thai
this language means that mere technicali
ties are to be overlooked and substantial
justice done. In 1852 the defeated Demo
cratic candidates contested the election of
the successful Whig candidates in Hamp
shire county ; and although an inspection of
the poll-books showed tbat scarcely one
in ten of the many returned to the court
nouse from the various precincts of that
large county was made out as it should
have been or certified as the law required,
the court, under the act of Assembly we
have quoted, decided that it must look only
to "the merits" of the case, and, doiogso,
found that the Whig candidates had re
reived a majority of all the votes recorded,
and for this reason (that is, upon the merits
of the case) awarded all the offices to them.
The decision was proper, just, right, con
sistent with common sense, and a good pre
cedent for the courts to follow. ? Congress
professes to be governed by exactly the
same law. It protends to decide all con*
tested-election cases on their own merits,
throwing aside technical informalities as
unworthy of its notice. If its practice shall
correspond with its professions, Col. Brax
ton will have no difficulty in getting his
fceat.
The Revenue Reformers.? A "Washing
ton telegram states that 011 Monday, durinp
the recess taken to await the message, Sen
ators and members indulged in a good (leal
of conversation on the recent elections, and
Messrs. Trumbull and Schurz stated very
promptly that they were in no third party
movements, nor in any hostility to the Ad
ministration. The latter stated that he had
always been a Republican, aud intended to
continue one.
These politicians are not reliable people.
They don't always speak the truth. They
ure like the maiden, who, "vowing she
would never consent, consented." Schurz
and Trumbull will be among the leaders of
the new movement, let them protest never
so vehemently that they are friends to
Gen. Grant.
Census of Virginia.? We have taken
from the tables of the* census of I860 the
statement of the population of each of
the fifty counties which constitute the Slate
of West Virginia, and added the figures to
gether, and have thus learned that they
then had a population of 376,688. The pop
ulation of the undivided State of Virginia
was returned at 1,596,318. Taking the one
total from the other, we find that in 1860
the population of Virginia as she now stands
was 1,218,630. The ceusus of 1S70 shows
her population to he 1 ,'228,672. If this hist
census Is correct, Virginia has increased in
population in ten years, only 8,?42.
Population or Bicbmom>.? The populn
tion of Richmond in 1660 whs 37,010. In
1870 it is returned at 51,003? a gain much
larger than the entire increase of popula
tion in the whole State of Virginia, if tbe
new census may be relied upon.
But it will be said that the city's limits have
been extended since 1860. Then take the
population of Henrico county and Hieh
mond city together. In 1860 it was 61,616.
In 1870 it Is ret urned at 70,276? a still greater
gain.
Where has all the decrease been felt?
POTMarriON.? -Messrs. "W*. H.? Jarvis,
JaXBO DlATOJ*, P. C. HiTCHEB; and Irvix
P. Hoio. of Petersburg, have been Arrested
(the first two for the second time) on the
charge of violating tbe enforcement act.
It is time this persecution were stopped.
Let the General Assembly pass a la^" pun
ishing by fine and imprisonment every man
concerned in a causeless arrest and pel secu
tion of oor people. Tha thing would soon
be stopped. The enforcement act is so
clearly unconstitutional that It deserves
only to be despjs** 9

How the Prcsrdoni'H Message wna Rc
ceivo<l-Wt?y He Ch?njr?l his Mlu<t
Concerning (icneral Amnesty? A
Lnrce Proporiion in Congress Fa
vorable Thereto? Attacks on Schurs,
Etc.
[Special Correspondence nf the Dispatch ]
Washington, Dec. 5, 1870.
The President's message falls rather flat
even among his Republican friends. There
is as little enthusiasm over it as has ever)
been exhibited, even as little as greeted his
first Cabinet announcement. Manv of his
friends are disappointed that he did not
recommend a general amnesty law, which
they understood to have been hie Intention
when the tirst draft of the message was pre
pared. That he has not done so Is taken as
evidence suilicient to show the fact that
Grant depends upon the Drake-Sumner
Butler wing of the party for his renomina
tion. These are types* of the ultra Radi
cals who would never favor general amnes
ty, and it will be seen that duringthe present
session, as in every previous one alter the
war, their voices will be heard in lavor of
proscription and in opposition to every
liberal sentiment that nobler men are in
clined to advance.
The St. l)omin<io part of the message ex
cites anything out favorable comment
among the President's friends, and the
strong advocacy of that scheme is regarded
as a ,4 lobby " job of stupendous propor
tions.
The ?neers at England, and every item of
the message savoring of a willingness to get
into a row, falls very flat, and it is certain
that Congress will not be influenced, as in
deed it will not by anv portion of the docu
ment.
Several of the Republican members In
both Houses express themselves very favor
ably on the subject of a general amnesty
law. This is particularly the case with men
professing to represent the Southern and
middle States They see the " handwriting
on the wall " plainly enough. Tt is certain
that the silent consent to the furtherance of
h prescriptive policy uiven by the President
will not have a similar sympathy in Con
gress to the same extent, sis it did last vear.
Grant pledges himself to it, but will be
found in the minority.
The Congressionalcommittee which made
the formal announcement to the President
to-day that both Houses were ready to re
ceive communications were ushered into
the Red Parlor bv (General Dent, and the
(ceremony of so informing (he President
h?? \vuKe tleie' They did not remain at
the bite House more than tive minutes,
^mediately upon the announcement of
?eting of Congress, General Porter,
secretary of the President, left
toe Xu.. ?nsion with the messa?e.
the Prnatt . ? ^enutors wiJJ 800?n ,
the Executive jjw ? ]isU it u sai(f
A caucus ol Radicju ..
held to revise the committv. ' ,
The reason of I his is plain euoufc. , |
is to be punished, iiis liberal vieWb
bad enough before, but, now that they hav*.
found no favor in executive circles, they
become doubly abominable to Grant's
friends. There is some anxiety to know
what particular course the proscriptionists
will purMie towards Scburz ; but it is a
satisfaction to the friends of the latter to
know that he, at least, is equal to the emer
gency, and ready for the fray whenever his
quandam confreres are disposed to inaugu
rate it. Timon.
Fcneral of Rev. Dr. Bagby.? An Im
mense concourse ot people? some of them
from a great distance? gathered at Bruing
ton on the 4th to hear the funeral discourse
in memory of Rev. Richard Hugh Bagby, 1
D. D. It will be remembered that in his
last moments he requested Rev. Andrew
Broaddus, of Caroline, bis most cherished
friend, to discharge this duty, and all felt
that it could not be left in abler or more
faithful band*. At an early hour the crowd
began to gather, aud though the meeting
house is unu>ually lar?e, several hundred
persons failed to obtaiu seats. Revs, An
drew and Luther Broaddus, Baynhum, i<-v
ans, Turpin, Land. A. Bagby,* Pollard of
Baltimore, Kyland of Alexandria, Scott,
Digges, (ireeham, and Shackleford were
present, nearly all of whom took part eithfcr
in the generafor introductory services. Mr,
Broaddus announced for his text : " A good
soldier of Jesus Christ," II. Tim : 2 and 3,
and for an hour aud lifteen jrninutes dis
cussed with con-picuous ability."
Horse-Thievrs.? Oflieer Gore, of this ;
place, captured a negro man in Prince "Wil
liam county on Thursday who bad in his
possession a horse stolen from Mrs. Beadles,
of Caroline county. The thief refused to
give up until after'two shots had been fired
at him, one of which took effect in an arm
and another in one of his legs. The des
perate character of tho thief may be
gathered from the further fact that whilst
Officer Gore was bringing him back, lead
ing the horse on which he was mounted,
the negro seized a favorable opportunity,
slipped" off, and immediately disappeared in
the adjacent woods. Thieves are busy just
now. Air. Doswell, near Hanover Juuc
! tion, lost two mules within ten days.?

Judge Bond.? This distinguished jurist
came here last summer, it was said, at the
instance of Governor li olden, to investigate
the Burgin case. After keeping Burgin in
jail for two or three mouthy he released
him ou Monday night last without letting
tue sheriff or the counsel for the prosecu
tion kuow of it until alter the prisoner had
left and got beyond the bounds ot the
State.
On Wednesday at 3 o'clock his Honor de
livered his opinion in the Burgin case, in
which the partisan feeling of the Judge is
as visible as it is in his conduct in secretly
releasing him.? Raleigh Sentinel.
Remarkable Man.? Mr. Ralph Clayton,
living near St. Louis, Mo., and tormerly of
this county, now on a visit to his friends in !
this county, will he eighty-tbree years old
on the 22d of February, and is as aetive in
bodv and mind as he ever was in his life.
He left this county about twenty years ago,
and purchased a "farm for $7,000, wlrich is
now worth $250,000. It i? situated within
Tour miles of toe city. He takes his gun
and hunts through the mountains with as
much activity as a young man of twenty
years.? Staunton Spectator .
Extremely 111.? A letter was received
here yesterday from tbe physician who is
attending Mr. E. A. Pollard, in New York,
which represents that his disease has as
sumed a very unfavorable phase, and that
there are no hopes of his recovery. His
complaint yields to no medical treatment,
and nis most hopeful friends are now pre
pared to hear of his demise at any moment.
