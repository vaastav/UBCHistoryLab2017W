TKS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
DELIVERED VS. CONGRESS, DEC. 3, 1861.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives:
In the midst of unprecedented political
troubles we have cause f groat gratitude
to God for unusual good health and most
abundant harvests.
You will not be surprised to learn that
in the peculiar exigencies of tho limes our
intercourse with foreign nations has been
attended with profound solicitude, chiefly
turning upon our own domestic affairs.
A disloyal portion of the American peo
ple have, during the whole year, been en
gaged iu an attempt to divide and de
stroy the Uuion. A nation which en
dures factious domestic divisions is expos
ed to disrespect abroad, and one party or
both is sure, sooner or later, to invoke
foreign intervention. Nations thus templ
ed to interfere are not always able to re
sist tho counsels of seeming expediency
and ungenerous ambition, although meas
ures adopted under 6uch influences sel
dom fail to be unfortunate and injurious
to thoso adopting them. The disloyal
citizens of the United States who have
offered tho ruin of our country in reward
for the aid and comfort which they have
invoked abroad, have received less pat
ronage and encouragement than they
probably expected. If it were just to sup
pose, as the insurgents havo seemed to
assume, that foreign nations in this caso,
disregarding all moral, social and treaty
obligations, would act solely and selfishly
for tho most speedy restoration of com
merce, including specially tho acquisition
of cotton, those nations appear as yet not
to have seon their way to their object
more directly or clearly through tho des
truction than through the preservation of
the Union. If we could dare to believe
that foreign nations are actuated by no
higher principle than this, I am quito sure
a second argumont could bo made lo
6how them that they could reach their
aim more rcadilv and easily by aiding to
crush this rebellion, than by giving en
couragement to the principal, lever rolled
on by the exciting of foreign nations to
hostility against us, as already intimated
in the embarrassment of commerco. Thoso
nations, however, not improbably saw
from tho first that it was the Union which
made as well our foreign as our domestic
commerco. They can scarcely fail topor
ceive that tho effort for disunion produces
the existing difficulty, and that one strong
nation promises moro durable pcaco and
more extensive, valuable and reliable com
merce, than can tho same nation broken
into hostile fragments.
I deem it of Jmportantanco that tho
loyal regions of East Tcnncsico and
Western North Carolina should bo con
nected with Kentucky and other faithful
parts of tho Union by railroad. I there
fore recommend, as a military measure,
that Congress provide for tho construc
tion of such a road as speedily as possi
ble. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate,
and through her Legislature make tho
most judicious selection of tho line, Tho
northern terminus must connect with
some existing railroad, and whether tho
route shall bo from Lexington or Nichols
villo to Cumberland Gap, or from Leba
non lo tho Tennessee lino in tho direction
of Knoxville, or somo still different lino,
can easily bo determined. Kentucky and
tho general government co-operating, the
work can bo completed in a very short
lime, and when done, it will bo not only
of vast present usefulness, but also an
available, permanent improvement worth
its cost in all tho future.
I invito your attention to tho corres
pondence between Her Britanic Majesty's
Minister accredited lo this government,
and the Secretary of Slate relative to the
detention of tho British ship Perthshire
in Juno lt, by tho Unitod Stales steam
er Massachusetts, for a supposed breach
of tho blockade. As this detention was
occasioned by an obvious misapprehen
sion of tho facts, and as justice requires
that wo should commit no belligerent act,
not founded in strict right as sanctioned
by public law, I recommend that an ap
propriation be made to satisfy the reason
able demand of tho owners of tho vosscl
for her detention.
I repeat the recommondation of my
predecessor in his annual message to Con
gress in December last, in regard to tho
disposition of tho surplus which will prob
ably remain after satisfying tho claims of
American citizens against Cmna, pursu
ant to tho awards of the Commissioners
under tho act of tho 3d of March, 1859.
If, however, it should not bo deemed ad
visable to carry that recommendation into
effect, I would suggest that authority be
given for investing tho principal over the
surplus referred to in good securities with
a view to satisfaction of such other just
claims of our citizens against China as
are not unlikely to ariso hereafter in the
course of our cxtensivo trado with that
empire
By iho act of the 5 th of August last
Congress authorized the President to in
struct the commanders of suitable vessels
to defend themselves against, and to cap
ture pirates. This authority has been ex
ercised iu n single instacco only. For
the more effectual protection of our exten
sive and valuablo comraorco, in the east
era seas, especially, it seems to mo that
it would also be advisable to authorize
the commanders of sailing vessels to cap
turo any prizes which pirates may make
of Unitod States vessels and their car
goes, and tho Consular courts established
by law in eastern countries to adjudicate
the cases, in iho event that this should
not bo ejected to by iho local authority.
.
Tho operations of tho Treasury during
the period which has elapsed sinco your
adjournment, have been conducted with
signal success. '. The - patriotism of the
peoplo has placod at tho disposal of the
government tho large means demanded by
the public exigencies. Much of the na
tional loan has been taken by citizens of
tho industrial classes, whoso confidence in
their country's faith and zeal for their
country's deliverance from its present per
il, havo inducod them to contribute to the
support of the government the whole of
the limited acquisitions.
This fact imposes peculiar obligations
to economy in disbursement and energy
in action. Tho revenue" from all sources,
including loans for tho financial year end
ing on tho 30th of Juno, 1861, was $86,
835,800 27, and the expenditures for the
same period, including payments on ac
count of the public debt, wore $84,578,
034 34, leaving a balanco in the treasury
on tho 1st of July of $2,257,065 80.
For the first quarter of the financial year,
ending the 30th of September, 1861, tho
receipts from all sources, including the
balance from July, 1st, were $102,532,
509 27, and the expenses $98,239,733
09, leaving a balanco on the 1st of Octo
ber, 1861, of $4,292,776 18. Estimates
for tho remaining throo-quartors of the
year and for the financial yoar of 1863,
together with his views of tho ways and
means for meeting tho demands contem
plated by them, will be submitted to Con
gress by tho Secretary of the Treasury.
It is gratifying lo know that the expenses
made necessary by the rebellion are not
beyond tho resources of tho loyal people,
and to believo that tho same patriotism
which has thus far sustained the govern
ment will continuo to sustain it till peace
and union shall again bless tho land.
I respectfully refer to tho report of the
Secretary of War for information respect
ing tho numerical strength of tho army,
and for recommendations having in view
an increase of its efficiency and tho well
being of the various branches of tho ser
vice entrustod to his care. It is gratify
ing to know that tho patriotism of tho
people is equal to Iho occasion, and that
tho number of Iroops tendered greatly ex
ceeds tho forco which Congress authorized
mo to call into tho field. I refer with
plcasuro to thoso portions of his report,
which make allusion to the creditable de
gree of discipline already attained by our
troops, and to tho excellent sanitary con
dition of tho entire army. Tho recom
mendation by the Secretary, for an organ
ization of tho militia upon a uniform ba
sis, is a subject of vital importance lo
tho future safety of the country, and is
commended to tho serious attention of
Congress. A largo addition to the regu
lar army in connection with the defection
that has so considerably diminished tho
number of its officers, gives peculiar im
portance to his recommendation for in
creasing the corps of Cadets to tho great
est capacity of the Military Academy.
Tho report of the Secretary of the Na
vy presents in det ail tho operations of that
branch of tho service, and tho activity
and energy which havo characterized its
administration and tho results of meas
ures lo increase its efficiency and power.
Such have been tho additions by construc
tion and purchaso that it may almost bo
said a navy has boon created and brought
into service sinco our difficulties com
menced. Beside blockading, our exten
sive coast squadrons, larger than ever be
fore assembled under one flag, have been
(ut afloat and performed deeds which
lave increased our naval renown. I
would invito special attention to tho rec
ommendation of tho Secretary of tho Na
vy for a moro perfect organization of tho
navy by introducing additional grades in
tho service. Tho present organization is
defective and unsatisfactory, and the sug
gcslions submitted by the department
will, it is believed, if adopted, obviato tho
difficulties alludod lo, promote harmony,
and increase tho efficiency of tho navy.
'
. I ask attention to tho report of tho
Postmaster General, the following being
a summary statement of the condition of
tho department : Tho revenue from all
sourcos during tho fiscal year ending tho
30th of Juno, 1861, including tho annu
al pcrmanont appropriation of $700,000
for tho transportation of frco mail mailer,
was $9,049,296 40, being about two per
cent loss than the rovonueof 1860. The
expenditures wore $13,706,709 11, show
ing a decrease of more than eight per
cent as compared with those of tho pre
vious year, and leaving an excess of ex
penditures over tho revenues for the last
fiscal year for over $557,362 71. Tho
gross rovenuo for tho year ending Juno
30lh, 1863, is eblimated at an increase of
four per cent ou that of 1861, making
$8,083,000, to which should be added
the earnings of the department for carry
ing free matter, via: $700,000, making
$9,382,000. The total expenditures for
1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leav
ing an estimated deficiency of $3,345,000
to bo supplied from tho Treasury in ad
dition to the permauent appropriation.
Tho present insurrection shows, I think,
that tho extension of this District across
the Polomao River at tho time of estab
lishing the capital here, was eminently
wise, and consequently that the relinquish
ment of that portion of it which lies in
the State of Virginia, was uuwise and
dangerous. I submit for your considera
tion tho expediency of rogaining that part
of the District and the restoration of tho
original boundaries thereof, through nego
tiations with the State of Virgiuia.
The repot t of tho Secretary of tho In
terior with the accompanying documents,
exhibits tho condition of the several
branches of the public business pertaining
to lhal department. The depressing in
fluences of tho insurrection have been es
pecially felt in tho operations of tho Pa
tent and Genera Land Office The cash
receipts from tho snlcs of public lands du
ring the last yoar, havo exceeded the ex
penses of our land system only about
9200,000. Tho salos havo been entirely
suspended in tho Southern Slato?, while
tho interruptions to tho business of tho
country and tho diversion of largo num
bers of men from labor to military sor
vico have obstructed settlements in tho
new States and Territories of tho North
west. Tho receipts of Ukj Patent Office
havo declined in nino months about $100,
000, rendering a largo reduction of tho
forco employed necessary to make it solf
sustaining. Tho demands upon the Pension Offico
will bo largely increased by tho insurrec
tion. Numerous applications for pensions
based upon tho casualties of tho existing
war havo already been made. Thcro is
reason to believe that many who are row
upon the pension-roll and in receipt of
the bounty of tho government, aro in tho
ranks of tho insurgent army or giving
them aid and comfort, Tho Secretary of
tho lntorior has directed the suspension of
tho payment of the pension of such per
sons upon proof of their disloyalty. I
recommend that Congress atilhorizo that
offico to cause tho names of such pcrsous
lo bo stricken from the pension-rolls.
Under and by virtuo of tho net of Con
gress entitled, "an act to confiscate prop
erly used for insurrectionary purposes,"
approved Aug. 6, 1801, legal claims of
certain persons to tho labor and services
of certain other persons havo become for
feited, and numbers of the latter thus lib
crated are already dependent on tho Uni
ted States, and must bo providod for in
somo may. Besides this, it is not impos
sible that somo of tho States will pass
similar enactments for their own benefit
respectively, and by tho operations of
which persons of tho same class will bo
thrown upon I hem for disposal. In such
cases I recommend that Congress provide
for accepting such persons from such
States according to somo modo of valua
tion in lieu pro tanto of direct taxes, or
upon somo other plan lo bo agreed on with
such States, respectively, that such per
sons on such acceptances by the general
government bo at onco deemed free ; and
that in any event steps bo taken for col
onizing both classes, or the ono first men
tioned, if tho other shall not bo brought
into existence, at somo placo or places in
a climato congenial to them. It might
bo well to considor, too, whether tho free
colored peoplo already in tho United Statos
could not, so far as individuals may do
sire, be included in such colonization. To
carry out the plan of colonization may in
volve tho acquiring of territory, and also
tho appropriation of money beyond that
to bo expended in tho territorial acquisi
tion. Having practiced Iho acquisition
of territory for nearly fifty years, tho Ques
tion of the constitutional power lo do so
is no longer an open one with us. Tho
power was first questioned by Mr. Jeficr
son, who, however, in tho purchaso of
Louisiana, yielded his scruples on tho plea
of great expediency. If it bo said that
tho only logilimato object of acquiring
territory is to furnish homes for white
men, this measure effects that object
for tho emigration of colored men
Icavos additional room for white men Re
maining or coming hero. Mr. Jefferson,
however, plead tho importance of procur
ing Louisiana moro on political and com
mercial grounds than on room for popu
lation. On this wholo proposition, in
cluding the appropriation of money with
the acquisition of Territories, does not tho
expediency amount to nbsoluto necessity,
that without which tho government can
not perpetuate f
In considering tho policy to be adopt
ed for suppressing tho insurrection, I have
been anxious and careful that the inevit
able conflict for this purposo shall not de
generate into a violent revolutionary strug
gle. I have, therefore, in every caso tho t
it proper to keep tho integrity of tho Un
ion prominent as tho primary object of
tho contest on our part, leaving all ques
tions which aro not of vital military im
portance to the more deliberate action
of tho Legislature. In tho exercise
of my best discretion, I have adhered to
the blockade of the porta hold by the in
surgents, instead of putting in force by
proclamation tho law of Congress enact
ed at the late session for closing these
ports, also obeying the dictates of pru
dence as well as tho obligation of law.
Instead of transcending, I havo adhered
to tho act of Congress to confiscate prop
erty usod for insurrectionary purposos.
If a new law upon tho samo subject shall
be proposed its propriety will bo duly con
sidered. Tho union must bo preserved,
and hence all dispensable means must be
employed. ' We should not bo in haste
to dotermino what radical and cxtremo
measures, which may roach iho loyal as
well as tho disloyal, are indispensable.
The inaugural address at the beginning
of tho administration, and the message
to Congress at the late spocial session,
were both mainly devoted to tho domes
tic controversy out of which tho insurrec
tion and consequent war havo sprung.
Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to
or from the principles or general purposes
stated and expressed in thoso documents.
Tho last ray of hope for preserving iho
Union peaceably expired at tho assault
upon Fort Sumter, and a general review
of what has occurred sinco may not be
unprofitable. What was painfully un
certain then, is much bolter definod and
moro distinct now, and tho progress of
events is plainly iu the right direction.
Tho insurgents confidently claimed a
strong t upport from north of Mason's and
Dixon's line, and tho friends of the Uu
ion were not frco from apprehension on
this point. This, howover, was soon set
tled definitely and on tho right side.
South of tho line, noblo littlo Delaware
led off right from tho first. Maryland
was made to seem against tho Union.
Our soldiers wore assaulted, bridges were
burned, and railroads torn up within her
limits, and wo were many days at ono

od and opened to tho government. She
already gives seven regiments to tho causo
of tho Union, and nono to the enemy,
and hor peoplo at a regular election have
sustained tho Union by a large majority,
and a larger aggregate vote thau they ev
er lcfore gave to any candidato on any
question. Kentucky, too, for somo time
in doubt, is now decidedly, and I think
unchangeably, ranged on the side of the
Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet,
and I believo cannot again bo over run by
tho insurants. Ihcso three States of
Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, nci
ther of which would promise a single sol
dier at first, havo now an aggrcgato of
not less than 40,000 m tho field tor Iho

After a somewhat bloody strugglo for
months, winter closes on tho Union peo
ple of Western Virginia leaving them
masters of their own country.
An insurgent forco of about 15,000 for
months dominating the narrow peninsular
region constituting the couutics of Acco
mac and Northampton, and known as tho
Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with
somo contiguous parts of Maryland, havo
laid down thoir arms, and tho peoplo there
havo reucwed their allogianco to and ac
cepted tho protection of tho old ling.

of tho Potomnc or cast of tho Chesa

Also we havo obtained a footing at each
of tho isolated points on the southern
coasts of llattcras, Port Royal, Tybco
Island, near feavannah, and Ship Island,
and wo likewiso havo somo general ac
counts of popular movements in behalf of
tho Union 111 Aorlh Carolina and lenn
csseo. These things demonstrato that tho
causo of the Union is advancing steadily
southward.
Sinco vour last adjournment Liouten
ant General Scott has retired from tho
head of the army. During his long life
tho nation has not been unmindful of his
merit, yet on calling to mind how faith
fully, ably and brilliantly ho has served
tho country for a timo far back in our his
tory, when few of tho now living had
been born and thenco forward continual
ly, I cannot but think that wo aro still his
debtor. I submit, therefore, for your con
sideration, what further mark of recog
nition is duo to him nud ourselves as a
grateful peoplo.
. With tho retirement of General Scott
camo tho cxeculivo duty of appointing in
his stead a General in-Chief of the army.
It is a forlunnto circumslanco that nei
ther in council nor country was thcro, so
far as I know, any difference of opinion
as to tho person to bo selected. Tho re
tiring chief ropoatedly exprossod his judg
ment in favor of Gen. McCIellan for tho
position, and in this the nation seemed to
give a unanimous concurrence. Tho des
ignation of McCIellan is, therefore, in a
considerable degree the selection of tho
country as well as of the Executive, and
heneo there is belter reason to hopo there
will bo given him tho confidence and sup
port thus by fair implication promised,
and without which ho cannot with so full
eflicioncv serve tho country. It has been

two good ones, and the saying is true if
taken to mean no moro than that an ar
my is better directed by a singlo mind,
though inferior, than by two superior ones
at variance and cross purposes, and tho
same is true in all joint operations where
in those engaged can have nono but ono
common end in view, and differ only as to
the choice of means. In a storm at sea
no one on boartl can wish tho ship lo sink,
yet not unfrcqucntly all go down because
too many will direct, and no singlo mind
can bo allowed to control.
It continuos to developo that tho insur
rection is largely if not exclusively a war
upon the first principle of popular govern
ment, tho rights of tho people. Conclu
sive evidence of this is found in tho most
grave and maturely considered public doc
uments, as well as in tho general tono of
tho insurgents. In theso documents wo
find tho abridgment of tho existing right
of suffrage and tho donial lo tho peoplo
of all right to participate in tho select 1011
of public officers except the legislative
body, advocated with Jalored arguments
to prove that largo control of tho govern
ment in the people is tho source of all po
litical evil. ' Monarchy itself is somotimes
hinted at as a possiblo rofugo from tho
power of tho people. In my present po
sition I could scarcely bo justified were I
to omit raising a warning voico against
this approach of returning despotism. It
is not needed nor fitting here that a gen
eral argument should bo made in favor of
popular institutions, but there is ono point
with its connections not so hackneyed as
most others to which I ask your attention.
It is the effort to placo capital on an equal
footing with, if not above, labor in tho
structure of government. It is assumed
that labor is available only in connection
with capital, that nobody labors unless
somebody clso owning capital somo how
by tho uso of it induces him to labor.
This assumed, it is next considered wheth
er it is best that capital shall hire labor
ers, and thus induce them to work by
their own consent, or buy them and drive
them to it without thoir consent. Hav
ing proceeded so far, it is naturally con
cluded that all laborers aro either hired
laborers, or what wo call slavos; and, fur
thor, it is assumod that whoever is onco
hired laborer is fixed in that condition for
life. Now, there is no such relation bo
Iwcen capital and labor as assumed, nor
is there any such thing as a froo man be
ing fixed for life in tho condition of a hir
ed laborer. Both of thoso assumptions
are false, and all inferences from them nro
groundless. Labor is prior to, and inde
pendent of capital. Capital is only tho
fruit of labor, and could never havo exist
ed if labor had not first existed. Labor
is tho superior capital, and deserves much
tho higher consideration. Capital has its
rights which are as worthy of protection
as any other rights, nor is it dcomod lhal
there is and probably always will bo a re
lation between labor and cnpilal producing
mutual benefits. The error is in assum
ing that the whole labor of community
exists within that relation.
A few men own capital, and that few
avoid labor, and with their capital biro or
buy a few to labor for them. A largo
majority belong to neither class, neither
work for others nor havo others work for'
them. In most of tho Southern Statos
a majority of the wholo peoplo of all col
ors aro neither slaves nor masters, while
in tho Northern a largo majority aro nei
ther hirers nor hired men with their fami
lies, wives, sons and daughters, work for
themselves on their farms, in their houses
and in their shops, taking tho wholo pro
duct to themselves, and asking no favors
of capital on ono hand, nor of hired la
borers or slaves on tho other. It is not
forgotten that a considerable number of
persons minglo their own labor with capi
tal, that is, they labor with their own
hands, and also buy or hire others lo la
tar for them, but this is only a mixod and
not distinct class. No principle slated
is disturbed by tho existenco of this mix
ed class.
Again, as has already been said, thcro
is not of necessity any such thing as tho
froo hired laborer being fixed for thai con
dition of life. Many independent men,
everywhere in those Slates, a few years
back in their lives were hired laborers.-
This is iho just and goncrous system
which opens tho way to all.
From the first taking of our national
census to iho last aro seventy years, and
wo find our population at tho end of the
period eight times as great as it was at
the beginning. Tho increnso of thoso
other things which men doom desirablo,
has been even greater. Wo thus havo at
ono view what tho popular principlo ap
plied to government through tho machine
ry of tho States and tho Union has pro
duced in a given timo, and also what, if
firmly maintained, it promises for tho fu
ture. There aro already among us thoso
who, if tho Union bo prcservod, will livo
to see it contain 250,000,000. Thefctrug-
glo of to-day is not altogether for to-day.
It is for a vast future also with a firm
reliance on Providenco all the more firm
and oarncst, lot us proceed in iho great
task which events havo devolved upou us.
