The Corpse Lying in State To-Day in the Gov*

Yesterday the remains of Mr. Greeley were ptlll
at tbe residence of Mr. Samuel Sinclair, of the
Tribune. liy an unfortunate and Inadvertent
error of confidence on the part of the press the
fact that they were removed there was made pub
lie, and its announcement occasioned considerable
annoyance to the friends and relatives who were
attending the dead. An innumerable multitude of
visitors on Sunday sought to view the wonderful
face of the great departed once more, and the same
event occurred yesterday. But an appro
priate precaution had been taken, and
three members of tbe police, detailed
to be on duty at tbe, door of the mansion relieved
the inmates or the unpleasant duty of refusing ad
mittance to those who had a desire to how tbeir
beads in token of rcspcct and admiration
BESIDE TUE RELICS OF TnE WORTHY DEAD.
It must be considered liow extremely unpleasant it
would have been to have had a throng of strangers
^essfnsTncaV the 6ofOn during the day, and bon
rudely the ciroimgt^j wpuld^^eak u?on"thc
shrinking and nSw quiet grief of the fair young
daughters. The band of death, while it takes away
that nobler part, the .soul, makes what remains
bccid a thousand fold mere endeared to the mourn
ers who hang about it, and the wish to be with It in
seclusion and privacy is the strongest one that is
entertained l>y the stunned neart. Over Mr. Sin
clair's home there rests a quiet, a peace and a
silence that
KOOTHE8 THE NERVES OP THOUGHT
and impai ta a sweetness even to the presence of
death. Mrs. Sinclair, a gentle lady of great per
sonal charms, is like a mother to Miss Ida and Miss
Uabrlclle, and, with a sweet cheerfulness that only
a woman can possess on such solemn occasions,
seeks to lead them away from despair and to look
opon the future with resignation.
Only a very few persons were in the solemn
presence of the dead yesterday. Judge Shea, the
long and closc friend of Mr. Greeley, was there to
render offices of kindness to the daughters by aid
ing Mrs. Sinclair in her delicate part. Mr. T. L.
McElrath, a name which was associated with that
Df the great journalist in business matters in his
early history, also called in the aitcrnoon. There
were no other visitors of note.
The coffin in which the body lay in the back
Earlor of Mr. Sinclair's house, Is covered with a
lack velvet pall, on which are strewn profusely
beautiful flowers of yellow and cold. A monu
ment of bloom stands behind the head of the de
ceased, and a vase of white roses is at his feet, on
tlic mantle over the coffin lay a wreath of ripened
wheat?a beautilul and signillcaut tribute?"the
harvest gathered."
AT TnE TRIBUNE OFFICE
all through the day the stream of persons?coming
in and looking at the sad signs of sorrow and loss,
and then turning silently away?was undiminished.
The heavy weeds of woe hang from every angle of
the ceiling and of tjie front of the building. The
windows of Mr. Greeley's "den" arc also draped.
Late in the afternoon & ?ompilttcc of the Com
mon council came to the Tribune office with ft com
munication for Mr. Sinclair, and then went away,
both he and Mr. Held accompanying them. The
action taken by the Aldermen will be found narrated
below, and also that of various other organizations,
nubile and private. Most of the clubs passed resolu
tions of regret and respect, irrespective ol their
political and other predilections and prejudices.
The woiK of draping the front of the City Hall
was begun late yesterday aitcrnoon, in honor of
the presence of the body, arrayed in state, in the
Governor's Room to-day.

bad determined as early as last Saturday to attend Mr.
Greeley's funeral if the day fixed should be one on
which he could properly be absent from the capital. He
is still in the same mind, and will attend on Wednesday

on vacating the chair and talcing his seat at the
Board the President delivered the following ad
dress
GENBRAB COCHRANE'8 SPEECH.
General Cochrane saidMr. President, I under
stand that the Board has been organized in Tiew
of an event which has shrouded the city in gloom*
It needs no elaborate speech to designate the
occasion properly. The death of Horace Greeley
inclines rather to silence than speech; language Is
feeble to measure the extent of our loss, and cer
tainly, if referrable to all that he has done and to
what, if living, he still might do, had better be left
unattempted. He was ?ur fellow citizen; here
was his chosen borne and here his daily walks.
While here, then, he was beloved; it was else
where that respect and admiration attended upon
hitn. But, beloved by us who Knew him aud
honored and esteemed by all who had heard of
him, he has, nevertheless, gone from among us,
bearing a name great and renowned. I have the
honor to Introduce the following resolutions
THE RBS0I.UTI0N8.
Resolved, That in the death of Horace Greeley the
public in the Interval since its unexpected announce
ment has evidenced a iust sense of the magnitude of the
loss to itself and to the civilized world, llis was the
wisdom that linked science to daily pursuits and the
philosophy that embraced the human race within com
mensurate benevolence; the religion that excluded none
from its gracious fold. In the quest of truth he was un
unwearled; In the practice of virtue humble, but stern
In dispensing its inexorable laws. With sensibilities as
tender as those ot a child his purity of heart installed nlin
the censor of every human vice. He was the moral
teacher of the age. In affairs a philosopher, in politics
a statesman, and in ethics a sage, he wrought them all
practically Into one of the greatest journalists of the time.
Resolved, That we do not forget. In the general gloom,
the poignancy of private grief, and we here tender to the
surviving larnily our heartfelt commiseration.
Resolved. That Horace Greeley, having grown in our
city to be the man he was, his obsequies should be so cele
bratcd that the people whom he loved may greatly par
ticipate therein. We therefore direct that the Governor's
Room, in the City Hall, be prepared, whero his body
shall lie in state, at public view, during Tuesday, the Xa
Inst., between the hours of nine A. M. and ten P. M.
ltesolved. That it is hereby recommended to our citi
zens to close their respective places ol business and re
train from any secular employment on the day set apart
for solemnizing the funeral rites and ceremonies; that the
memberR of the Common Council will attend his tumoral
In a body, with their staves of office draped In mourn
ing, and will wear a badge of mourning for a period of
thirty days; that tb$ flags on the City Hall and the
othef public buildings be displayed at halt-mast
from sunrise until ^unsot, anil, the ownyrs or masters of
vessels in the narbor, ana the owners of SccubAnis of
buildings in this city be requested to display their flags at
half-mast on that dav, and that a joint committee ot each
brauch ol the Common Council be appointed to perfect
the above, and, after consultation with the Mayor and
the heads of the departments of the municipal govern
ment, make such other and turther arrangements as !o
them may appear better calculated more clearly and im
prest v*!yto man West sorrow for the death and reverence
for the meicoryo* the deceased,- ?
The Board of AuUtant Aldermen.
The above resolutions were taken to the Hoard
or Assistant Aldermen, and, in moving their adop
tion, Assistant Alderman Connor delivered the fol
lowing speech
ASSISTANT ALDERMAN CONNOR'S SPEECH.
Ass istant Alderman Connor moved concurrence
with the Board of Aldermen. He said that ns a
young man, lately embarked on the sea of political
life, he could hardly be expected to find words
adequate to the occasion, lie referred to the
prouu example presented to the yonng by Mr
Greeley, and urged all young men to lollow his ex
ample in the determined manner in which he
adhered to his principles. He paid a tribute to Mr.
Greeley's efforts in behalf oi the colored race, sav
ing that he labored to put into practical operation
the first principle of the Declaration of imlepen
dence, that all men were horn free and equal. Ilin
death is a sad ailliction, which men of all creeds of
political faith leel. His name will go down to pos
terity as au honored, beloved American, whose
works will live until history pnsseth away.
The resolutions were then adopted aud a com
mittee for conducting the arrangements was
named. ?
The committee immediately went into executive
session, and there were also present during the de
liberations Mr. Whitelaw Held and Mr. Sinclair.

TRIBUTES TO THE DEAD.
Action of the Liberal Republican Aaao
clatloR.
The hail of the Liberal Republican Association
waa filled last night when a special meeting waa
held to adopt resolutions of regret at the loss of
their chief. Mr. Thomas E. Stewart was in the
chair. Mr. Frankeuhelmer and General Palmer
each made a brief address, when General John
Cochrane rose and paid a touching eulogy to the
fame and memory of his departed leader. The sub.
stance of his remarks were as follows s?"It seems
to me that each head is bowed in silence and onr
presence here alone expresses our fealty and
reverence for the dead. He was more
than onr chief, and when hia benevolent
face looked down npon ns he nerved
our hearts, and lnade us in onr weakness strong.
We battled ivr (fee rttAt with fee who wm liwvi J
on the Bide of right, of justice and mercy. Though
our standard-bearer has fauen his principles still
live In our minds and hearts, and we will follow In
his footBtepB and carry out his wishes. We have
heard the story of his physical suffering; we have
been told his death was the penalty of our leader
ship ; but long before our defeat the continuous
working of his great intellect had exhausted all
the power which even so temperate and
prudent a man may expect to garner
from the waste or a long life of toll.
There is a family left ana there is
a sourcc of greater lamentation In that house, de
serted, than partisan factions can know. Oh! in
the lace of these bereft ones let partisan bitterness
lose its sting, and the langs or malice cease in
their polBonous work.
On motion of Mr. Brisbami it was agreed to meet
at ten o'clock on Wednesday, at the Ilail, and to go
In a body to the church, and thence to the grave.
It was also determined to drape the building, and
to provide mourning badges for the members or the
association.
The following resolutions were then adopted by
the members, each rising to bis seat to siguily his
assent
Whereas It has pleased Plvine Providence to remove
to his everlasting rest our beloved Itieud aud honored
leader. Horace Greeley; therefore,
Resolved, That while our hearts arc weighed down
with affliction at our heavy loss we are grateful to the
Supreme Ruler of events that our friend whs spared for
so long a career of usefulness, and that the advancement
of the great interests of humanity, civilization and
brotnerhood among all men?for which he so long and so
faithfully and disinterestedly labored?will notlong be
hindered or delayed, even by his death.
Resolved, That the history or nis lire, too well known
to need recital here, is the bright, unstained record of an
existence devoted to the good or others; owing nothing
to accidental advantages, having from his childhood to
rely npon hla own unaided exertions for a living, his
education and opportunities for usefulness, he ruse by
nativo genius, guided by pure purposes and strengthened
by habits of Industry acquired in early youth aud never
relaxed until the finger of death touched him, from po
verty to what would have been a condition of affluence
but for his untiring generosity, from obscurity to fame.
Recognized as the first in his chosen profession?a profes
sion which he has done more than any other writer to
elevate to the proud and honorable position it now holds;
honored in literature, in which he made for himself a
name and became a force by his unrivalled power to
express in fitting language great and valuable thoughts,
but recognized, honored and worthy of honor, now that
his work is done, most of all in and because of this,
that ho was always the friend, the advocate
and the companii n of the poor, tne weak and
the oppressed. In the great events that have taken
place in our country within his lifetime, and especially
those that resulted in the removal of the crime and
rhamc of slavery mid the elevation to the rights of man
hood and citizenship of a long oppressed race, the ser
vico and influence of Horace Greeley were pre-eminent.
His disinterestedness, purity and statesmanship were
demonstrated when, at the close of tho long, bloody and
exhausting contest which distracted the nation, he who
of all men had borne most obloquy, incurred most
hatred from the defeated party, was the first to claim for
that party the fUll and free restoration to all civil and
Roliiical rights and to advocate the re-establishment of
te Union In the spirit of fraternal affection. Always
In advance of his political associates, he was the
creature of no party. Advocating truths for no other
inducement than that they were truths, he even, while
he was yet with us, saw nearly all the principles for the
avowal of which he was at first reviled adopted by the
people and enacted into laws, and soon the very
doctrlAM ^h'oh he last iuvoc-ated will, by adoption,
becom^ the creed of a United nation, and in the
fruition of the hopes he so earnestly entertained
and for the realization of which ho so earnestly
labored that the errors, the quarrels and the bitterness
of the past should be forgotten, aud the people ot his
native lard, in a spirit of fraternal kindness, proceed to
work out the gre.it career which is open tq them, we will
find consolation tor his untimely departure.
Resolved, Thai as political supporters and associate! of
oar lamented friend we derm it due alike to our cause, to
his memory and ourselves to declare our continuedJQjUl
in and adhesion to the principles represent^ <10U main
tained by him in the lale canvas*: but we make this
declaration In no spirit of partisanship, and in the hope
and belief that the time is near at hand when thote who
have been opposed heretofore only upon issues which
huve been settled will lie able to meet and act
together with exclusive reference to the public good.
Resolved, That we are profoundly impressed by the
unlvcrtal manifestations of the sorrow felt by all our
fellow citizens at our common loss, and gladly recognize
In the general expression of grief the proof that no
differences of opinion have obscured the lustre of our
dead friend's qualities of mind or heurt. The tears that
flow upon his bier come from honest hearts, and over his
grave men of all races and ol' all parties will offer the
best tribute to his memory when they unite in obliterat
ing differences and strive together to carry on those
(rreat labors for the public good for which he lived aud
for which lie died.
Resolved, That wc tem'cr to the children of the de
ceased our deepest sympathy for their irreparable loss,
for which there can be no compensation or adequate
reparation.
Tammany's Tribute to the Dead*
The Tammany Sachems held a meeting at their
wigwam last evening, Augustas Schell In the chair.
Among those present were Sachems John Kelly,
Algcrnoon S. Sullivan, Chanler, Coner, Fox, And.
rus, Donnelly, Leonard and Barbour. Alter transact
ing the usual routine business Mr. Sullivan, who
had been deputed by Lhe society to give expression
to the feelings of tbe members concerning Mr.
Greelcy'B death, read the following:?
THE SOCIETY MOURNS.
The Society of Tammany, or tbe Columbian Order,
was organized to keep alive the patriot flame in
the breasts ot all American citizens, and the Society
lias always been prompt to honor the name and
lame of those who were eminent in their character
and services in the state. ? just tribute to the
living and
UNFADING LAURELS TO THE HONORED DEAD
have ever been rendered In these halls, and now
when the death of Horace Greeley has been an
nounced we approach bis tomb and reverently lay
thereon our cnaplet. in the best and broadest
sense of the word ho was a poilanthropist. His
very patriotism was an expression of his desire to
promote the happiness of his fellow men. lie loved
justice, and, therefore, of course, lovfcd liberty and
equality for every man. He was
NEVER A SLATE OP PARTY,
but a man whose conscience gave him Individuality
and independence. The contioiling charat toristics
of his life were rectitude and active effort for pro
gress and benevolence. For all this and for his
courageous, tender-hearted appeals to his country
men to uproot the spirit 01 discord and to bring
back
THE FEELING OP BROTHERHOOD
in our beloved country we to-niglit Inscribe his
name in bright letters on the scroll of America's
most Illustrious patrotic dead.
This address was seconded by Mr. Kelly and
unanimously agreed to. Mr. Kelly and others
feelingly alluded to Mr. Greeley's death as a lo.-s
to the entire nation, and one which men of all
parties, sects and religions, who desired that right
should prevail everywhere in all things, had reason
sincerely to deplore.
Action of the Republican General Com

mlttec7
The Executive Committee of the Dulon Republi
can General Committee assembled last evening at
their headquarters, Hroadway, near Twenty-third
street, for the consideration of special business,
John H. White, Chairman, presiding. The prin
cipal business before the committee was the
issuing of a call for primaries to elect delegates to
the new General Committee and officers of the dis
trict associations. A great deal of uninteresting
debate ensued as to the power of the committee
who isshe the call to designate also the places at
which the primaries should be held. It was finally
resolved that the committee IxBiie the rail in the
usual form and that the district organizations
designate their respective places or meeting as
heretofore.
The Chairman then stated that he deemed it
proper that ne should call the attention of the
committee to the propriety ol their taking some
action which would be appropriate in relation to
TIIK DEATH OP HOItAOl GREELEY.
The funeral was to take place on Wednesday, and
Inasmuch as It was not possible to hold a meeting
of the General Committee, he desired the opinion
of the members present as to whether it would not
be best for the chairman of this committee to pub
lish a notice In tbe papers asking the members of
the committee to meet at a designated time and
place to attend the funeral.
Senator Lent moved that the chairman of the
General Committee be requested to issue a notice
to that effect. The motion was adopted.
It was lurtlier resolved that the chairman of the
General Committee be directed to make such ar
rangements respecting the
ATTENDANCE OF THE COMMITTEE AT THE FUNERAL
ol Horace Greeley as may be deemed expedient;
that the hour of assembling of the Committee be
one hour before the time designated for the fune
ral; that the Committee assemble at the headquar
ters, and that they proceed In a body thence to the
church. Also, that the Secretary be directed to
provide suitable mourning badges.
On motion of Mr. Dritmmond a committee of
three was appointed to draft suitable resolutions
pi respect to the memory of the deceased.

The commencement of a session of Congress used
to be a great event In years gone by, when the
the?/own1VaL??.f Dlc'nU;rH ln 8ta<fe coaches or in
their own vehicles often made it necessary to wait
several days for-a quorum. Now the cars bring
fs io dP.ri1 Reprfe8eutatlve8 Promptly, and there
whonfhl w P?rfcctiDff an organization except
when the House has to elect a Speaker. The gal
?rHe??^he Se,;atc wcre unusually mil of epecta- i
for tn? !n Uie ,,lp,on,at8 were out in force,
or they all wanted to know what the President
would have to say about the governments wS !

Schura did not appear at all downhearted, while
n" " ,iVCly 118 ? crtcket- Morton was
especially congratulated on his re-election, and
there was much sympathy for Governor Brownlow
when the old man was brought in and placed in his
seat like a child, unable to move or to speak above
ITm' bKVery Senator wore the conventional
suit of black, except Wright, of Iowa, who was
dressed in a very light blue coat. Mr. Colfax en
deavored to look unconcerned as he rapped to
order and invited the Rev. Brother Newman to
open the session with prayer, which he did with
great unction. Conkling and Thurman were then
sent to the White House, with three Representa
tives, to notify the President that Congress was
ready to hear irora him and go to work. Wilson
radiant with victory, offered a bill for the relief of
the Boston sufferers, aW'thftiiTumuer' dashed
into the arena with his Civil Service
bil and a resolution directing the names of the
battles of the late war to be stricken from regi
mental nags and the "Army Register." The Senate
was not disposed to consider either of these mat
ters just then, and they were laid over with sev
eral other bins and resolutions. Senator Steven
son, of Kentucky, improved the first opportunity to
present the credenrials of his colleague, General
lISoTo ha" beeD ftPP?lDfed by Governor
Leslie to All the vacancy caused by the death of
Garrett Davis. He Is a tall, soldier like, gray
headed, clean-shaven gentleman, upwards of
sixty-three years of age, is a farmer by occupation
but has had some legislative experience in the
Kentucky Senate and in the Confederate Congress
at Richmond. lie is a democrat, but he voted
squarely for Mr. Greeley.
The House concurrent resolution in regard to
the death of Mr. Greeley was received, read an J
passed; nor is it Improbable that to-morrow the
Senate will 'idjourn over until after the funeral
General Baocock brought the Message, as General
Porter ha? discontinued his labors as private sec
re tary, and Secretary Gorham read the document
aloud, Ognres and all, with great distinctness.
Nearly all the Senators listened to It, and there
were many approving nods. When It had been
read and the Senate adjourned there were the
usual comments upon It. The republicans were
generally well contented with it, although Chandler
thought it a decidedly "liberal" document, and the
democrats made few comments. The republican
Senators had much informal confidential talk
about the reconstruction of the Senate com
mittees^ la.iucj^ a jnanner as to discipline those
of their number who sup^meT^reeTey; nor
wcre they pleased when the action of the House on
General Banks' offer to resign was known. Just
before adjournment It was announced that the
caucus had been arranged. This arrangement was
a notification that there will be a caucus to-mor
row morning, in the Senate reception room, at
eleven o'clock, of those Senators who have sup
ported the platform and candidates agreed upon
1Natlonftl ^publican Convention, held at
Philadelphia In June last. This will shnt the door
of the caucus against the Greeley republicans, and
the Grant men will have matters their own way.
This caucus will also consider the rules relating to
the transaction of business and the wiping out of
the calendars to Uke a fair start. The confer
ence committees of the last session will be re
vived ; and the Senate, if it retains its calendar,
will adopt what la known as the "Anthony Rule,"
by which each bill which no one wishes to debate
or speak against Is taken up successively, leaving
those whleh win occasion talk.
Good Feeling aad Hurnoiy la the
Hoasa?:Honors to the Memory of Horace
On?l?y.4ptaker Blaine and the Credit
Moblller Scandal.
The last session of the present Congress set at
meridian to-day. The galleries of the House were
tkMnged with ftrangers of both vb49
Speaker Blaine monnted his rostrum to indicaW
that the honr had arrived. All eyes were turned
toward him. Perceptibly he has grown Senatorial-*
to wit, gray and stout?since his last appearance.
Mo one could observe, however, In the cheerful and
metallic ring of his authoritative voice, that ha
had been a sleepy or indifferent actor in the latft
Presidential contest. The Rev. Mr. Butler, the
Chaplain, made an appropriate prayer, In which he
touchingly referred to tlie hand of death among
the great ana small. Ills pathetic refereii^ wag
listened to with piayerful attention. Tben the roll
was called, and then, again, the absentees
were summoned. A quorum appeared and the
Senate's customary message was received. The
House responded to it by the appointment of ft
committee to wait upon the Executive and inform
iiiru of its anxiety to hear from him. Thereupon
Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts, the father of th?
House and leader of its most Important committee*'
offered by way of resolution a testimonial of regTef
and respect to the memory of Horace GreeleyJ
There was a hush of profound and reverential
silence following the reading of the resolution^
which was broken by the recognition of Mr. Coxj
of New York. Mr. Cox, lu a low and tremulous
tone, Stated that he had just been requested to/
say a word in honor of a former member and aaJ
Illustrious citizen. Mr. Greeley had representeiM
lu Congress the district in which Mr. Cox resided, i
Referring to his service in Congress and his great/
services to the people he gave a brief analysis od
his benevolent, earnest and courageous life. Inf
Journalism and in society no one could fillI
the void left by Horace Greeley. In a few\
graphic sentences he referred to the relation of
the deceased to both parties, and closed with tho^
remark that the representatives of the peopltX
would be true to their constituents in the highest*'
sense by following sadly hla bier into the silent
dignity of death with their sorrow and sympathy.,'
The resolution passed unanimously, of course, and/
a generous and gentle feeling therefore inaugurated
the present session.
Then General Banks, in a few apt and graceful)
words, asked to be relieved from the Foreign Af-'
fairs Committee. The House, In the same kindly}
feeling which It had shown with respect to General'
Banks' dead candidate, refused to excuse him front
the service. Mr. Brooks, of New York, entered hig^
protest against making a political or partisan ques
tion of our foreign affairs.
Speaker Blaine then left the chair and called S. S.
Cox to It, as Speaker pro tfin. This was the signal for*
the utmost attention, as It had been whispered about
that he would call for a committee to investigate
the Credit Mobillcr charge. In a five-minute speed*
the Speaker referred to the distinguished legislator^
and cx-leglslatora who were Inculpated with him
self In the Credit Mobiller scandal and bribe, and
then stating that he had on Saturday advised thai
present occupant of the chair that he would calli
him to discharge Its duties on Monday, and that hoi
would offer a resolution of Inquiry, the committee
to be selected by Mr. Cox, who It was well kuowtv
entertained opposite political views. He then send
up to the Clerk's desk the resolution. Some
modifications were made In ?hc phraseology of the
resolution. Mr. Archer, of "My Maryland," wng
the only member ftlio opposed Its adoption. Iie
thought that investigation, as recently conducted,!
had better be omitted and business done. Mr. Ran*
daH, Mr. Dawes and Mr. Ilolman urged tlia
adoption or the resolution, and It passed.;
Mr. Cox stated that ho was prepared to(
name a committee, which, In his judgment,/
would do Justice fairly aud Impartially. He named'
Judge Poland, of Vermont; General Banks, ot
Massachusetts; Mr. Beck, of Kentucky; Judge
Niblack, of Indiana, and Mr. McCrary, of Indiana.'
This committee is regarded as having been fairly
and ingeniously framed. No party has dotnlnancjri
In it. If General Banks is a republican, he is witlii
the majority; If he Is a democrat, he is with the!
majority. As lie Is a liberal and an honest mar*
and ex-Speaker, well posted In all the procedure oj
legislation, his selection gives satisfaction in everyj
regard. The standing and character of the other
gentlemen named on the committee Is considered!
sumclcnt evidence that the Investigation will be
thorough and impartial. For his judgment thef
Speaker pro tnn. received the commendation o4
both republicans and democrats; while Mr. Blaine,)'
In trusting to the appointment of the committed
by one opposed to him politically, has in a measure/
already vindicated himself from the charges made.
Recess followed the* Credit Mobiller excitement'
and abont half-past one o'clock the Clerk com-l
menced reading the President's Message. Thai
members listened attentively, but few engaging la'
any work.
Kxpresslon of Opinion on the
The Spanish Minister Pleased?ttcncral/
Banks on the Opposition Strength.
The Message provoked very little adverse crltl*
clsm. Even the most determined opponents of the/
administration could find no point for attack In it.'
It Is conccded on all hands that It Is a sensible
though not a very striking document. As General'
Banks remarked to your correspondent this even^
ing, all the main points had Deen given In advance
by the Herald. commenting on the ITesldent'a
Message, Sir Edward Thornton expressed his satiav
faction with that part of It which relates to the
settlement of the difficulties with England. He
said there may be people on both sides who do not!
like the terms of the settlement, bug
the main point has been gained; all caused
of misunderstanding have been removed, and)
the two kindred nations may henceforth live at*
peace with one another. Admiral Polo, the Span
ish Minister, It appears, Is not at all surprised at
| the statement of the Message with regard to Cuba*
; and slavery. He thinks the President is perfectly
I justified in his confldcnce in the present govern
[ ment of Spain and in the expectation that It will
I pursue a liberal policy and deal fairly with the
question of slavery. He believes that the Presi
dent takes a practical step In the matter and/
makes a good point in condemning in the flrstj
place the practice of those citizens of tiie United!
States and naturalized Cubans who are holding)
slaves in Cuba. The Marquis de Noallles, the FrencIV
Minister, was pleased with the complimentary aU;
lusion to France as "our earliest ally," while Baron
Lederar, the Austrian Minister, seemed highly
delighted with the favorable notice the President
has taken of the Vienna Exhibition. The distinc
tive feature of to-day's proceedings, both In tl.e
House and the Senate, Is apparently the era ol!
good feeling which has been Inaugurated. One
prominent opposition member of the Hoiisp, how
ever, remarked that there is already a feeling o# '
distrust among the memi>er8 of the dominant
party, and assigns this a* a reason for the non
acceptance of Oeneral Banks' resignation. Meet
ing General Banks this evening your correspondent
asked him what he thonght ol the action of the
House with regard to himself. He said he looked!
upon it as very complimentary. To a farther in
quiry as to what would lie the position of the libe
rals In the House he replied that there are no libe
rals and no democrats. There are but two parties?
the administration members and the opposition.
At I stated in the House to-day, 1 belong to thai
latter/
"By what particular name,"* inquired your cor
respondent," would you call the opposition?"
'?By no other name than members of the opposi
tion. The party seems very weak now, but In ft
year or two they will show surprising strength."
