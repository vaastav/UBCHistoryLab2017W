New York, Dec. $. Tht Sun to-morrow
will lay:
There Is nothing unexpected or strik
ing In the message which Mr. Cleve
land aent to congress. The Important
paragraphs might be printed In three
quarters of a column. It Is melan
choly fact, that with a single exception
every Important reference to Interna
tional affairs Is an Indirect confession
of failure and humiliation. The excep
tion is the part devoted to the Blue
fields incident and the policy of our
government with regard to the Nlcara
guan canal, and here we have nothing
positive or enlightened. Mr. Cleveland
does not conceal bis hope that the pres
ent congress will be unpatriotic end
shortsighted enough to abandon all
that we have gained In Samoa. About
the only vigorous passage in the mes
sage is that in which the president de
nounces the century-old law for the
protection of American ship building
as "nearer a relic of barbarism than
anything that exists under the pro
visions of a state of the United
States."
Other matters are Mr. Cleveland's
commendations of the preposterous re
port of the so-called strike commission
as "worthy of the careful considera
tion of congress;" his declaration that
he will continue to borrow money when
ever in his judgment the situation re
quires it, and hlB very crystalline dis
cussion of the currenoy question.
The Tribune will commend the para
graph in the message concerning the
issuing of bonds to meet the deficit and
to save the nation's credit, but will
criticise him for not urging important
economies and will declare that the
proposal to reconstruct the currency
proves to be little better than a thinly
disguised plan to revive the old demo
cratic state bank system.
" Continuing the Tribune will say:
. "The radical fault in this message is
"that it obstinately' Ignores the prostra
tion of business by a change- of public
policy, and the incompetence and fail
ure of congress to provide adequate
revenue, suggests' no means of raising
more money except by borrowing, and
threatens renewed agitation for lower
duties and a delicate and dangerous
reconstruction ourrenoy system at a
time when business can by no means
bear a further shock. It is the utter
ance of a man who will not see hlB own
mistakes or the terrible mlsohlef done
by him and his party, who will not
listen to the people when they demand
a different policy and thus go stubborn-
ly on to disturb Industry, to diminish
revenue and to anger the people still
more.
The Recorder will say: The message
which Mr. Cleveland sent to congress
yesterday la in many points one of the
beat he has written. It gives in a suc
- oinct way an intelligent Idea of .what
the government has been doing during
the past twelve months, while it is not
as many of his old1 messages were
weighted down with suggestions and
loaded with omniscient advice to a co
ordinate branch of the government He
evidently felt while preparing it the re
buke gave his administration on Novem.
ber 6 and toe has accepted it in a be
coming spirit of humiliation.
Springfield, Mass., Dec. 3. The Re
publican will to-morrow say: The
most striking feature of this document
is tha defiant emphasis put upon the
declaration that the government's
credit wiB be preserved. It is a nota-
,ble proclamation. He 'cannot believe
that any citizens are willing that the
government should default in its obli
gations of drop to ai silver basis. Any
how he Intends to leave nothing un
done to. prevent such a calamity, and
so long as no better authority is pro
vided for; bond Issues suoh authority
as he has will be utilized whenever and
so often aa it becomes necessary to
maintain a sufficient gold reserve.
, That Is Inspiring talk. It Is emphatic
otlce served on the silver marplots In
congress that their schemes cannot be
earned out Just at present.
Harford, Deo.: 8.-rBhe Courant will
say to-morrow that the message "is on
"the -whole a humdrum and perfunctory
sort of a paper, in no -way equalling
for vigor of expression his 'perfidy and
dishonor letter or his other recent com
munications, whldhi went to congress
by the backdoor Instead of officially."
i. The Courant endorses his position on
the army and the navy and on finance'
generally, 'but questions the wisdom of
further perpetuating the greenbacks as
proposed In the new bond scheme. -
London, Deo. 8. The Standard will
say to-morrow in a leader on President
. Cleveland's message: .
The' proposed change of the banking
laws can in no way put cash Into the
treasury for present or future demands,
but" it" may do much to intensify ex
isting dangers. . In one way alone, can
the gold reserves of the treasury be re
plenished without risk,- namely by
changing budget deficits into surpluses
and accumulating the -latter' in gold.
Secretary Carlisle's provisions tend di
i recti? to make a deprecated paper cur
rency redundant and .therefore 'seem
weak and most Impolitic . His proposal
proclaims that the currency problem is
one which the democrats even yet dare
. not meet squarely. -.
', The Dally News will say: The trans
fer of the responsibility, from the treai
i - . . '
ury to the banks undoubtedly Is sound
finance. The system has stood tha test
of practical working in Canada. There
Is plenty of gold in the United States,
but Its collection and Its retention ob
viously are not duties of the govern
ment under the ordinary conditions of
national existence. The continuance
of the task under present conditions
obviously would lead sooner or later to
difficulty or disaster.
The Dally Chronicle will eulogize Mr.
Cleveland's dogged persistence In ad
vocating the policy of reforms "which
his mlscredlted party has neither the
oourage nor the conscience to pursue."
Boston, Dec. 8. The Globe (dem.)
says: There Is no note of hesitancy in
the president's message to congress.
He declares his position on all the lead
ing Issues of the time clearly and un
mistakably. Mr. Cleveland's utterance
regarding ways and means of main
taining the gold reserve In the treasury
give evidence enough, if needed, of Im
patience at the failure of congress In
the past to enact legislation authoriz
ing the Issue, In case necessity arises,
of short term low rate bonds. It Is
clear the president believes himself
warranted In authorizing the recent
bond Issue. His views on this mat
ter will no doubt be controverted by
certain men in congress, but It is quite
unlikely, with the obviously and press
ing necessity of dealing with the cur
rency problem In general, that much
time will be consumed In dealing with
matters of the past. It is the financial
needs of the present that chiefly claim
the attention of our lawmakers.
The Journal (rep.) deals exclusively
with the financial portion of the mes
sage, and says, in substance, that the
current program of the administration
can scarcely fail to disappoint con
servative financiers. The net result of
the scheme would be to give us a form
of national currency less stable and sat
isfactory than we now have.
Washington, Dec. 3. When question
ed concerning the president's message
Senator Piatt of Connecticut said:
"If the president thinks the present
evils are to be cured by further doses
of free trade and an effort to get free
ships he has failed to learn anything
from the recent elections."
Senator Hawley of Connecticut said:
"The message Is disappointing. It Is
most remarkable that It wholly omits
any reference to the amazing expres
sion of opinion of the people in the
recent elections. As to foreign affairs
the president's action is reactionary
and un-American. Until Mr. Carlisle's
report appears no opinion can be ex
pressed of the president's financial pol
icy. The message is far short os the
necessities and. the demands in the
judgment . of both parties."

A Member of a New Haven Firm Before
. the Lexow Committee.
New York, Dec. 3. The senate in
vestigating committee, better; known
as the Lexow committee, met again
this morning after a vacation of over
a month, to continue its investigation

Duceyy who was forbidden to attend
the sessions of the committee by. Arch
bishop Corrigan, was present.
John HealyiOf Healy & Bigelow, who
at one time kept a museum on the

"Mr. Soff," said the witness, "I did
hot come to this chair tq be insulted.
My medicine Is not a fake, medicine."
"You send shows through the coun

Mr. Goff, I am astonished at you talk

BATTLE OF THE BALLOTS.'

Kepabllrane Have aa Kseellent Oppor

Everywhere Xeventh Waid tpllt Way
Itesult la Republican Bucessa There.
To-day will occur on of the greatest
battles of the ballots in the history ot
the local town and city elections. Last
evening both parties were confident
of winning, but the confidence of the
democrats was not nearly so outspoken
as in former years. Indeed, It almost
seemed as if, although they said they
were sure of wlnnlng.at the same time
In their inmost souls they didn't believe
what they were saying.
The managers ot both political par
ties were kept bustling last night mak
ing the final preparations for the con
test to-day. Chairman James H. Mac
Donald of the republican town commit
tee, warns all republicans to be care
ful not to use any of the spurious
tickets which have been sent broadcast
to the republican voters. He advises
all who desire to vote the straight re
publican ticket to secure their tickets at
the booths on election day.
There is a great contest on for con
trol of the court of common council,
and here the republicans have .great
hopes of winning out, owing to the dis
sensions and factional fights with which
the democracy Is cut up. The republi
cans have an excellent chance of se
curing aldermen and councllmen from
the strong democratic Third and
Seventh wards. In the Third ward the
anti-McGann faction to the number of
several hundred have openly declared
their Intention of voting the straight re
publican ticket, and the republicans
there have now a chance of their life
time to elect their ward ticket
The fight between the Moore and the
anti-Moore factions In the Seventh
ward still goes merrily on. The breach
between the two factions grows larger
every minute, and the fight will be one
of the bitterest in this history of the
ward. Yesterday a circular was dis
tributed broadcast throught the ward
It is estimated that this ticket will have
a large following In the ward, and Indi
cations are that it will be successful.
With the democrats fighting among
themselves one of the possibilities of
election day 4s that a complete repub
lican ward ticket may be eleoted in
that hotbed of democracy, the Seventh
wnrrl
'T-he circular denounces .loqre,,'rie
opposing , candidate, alleging' that- he
failed to oppose the Standard Oil com
pany's locating their tank in, the
Seventh until a "general cry of Indigna
tion at his apathy was raised in the
ward. The circular In a pathetic tone
calls upon the voters to reject Moore
and vote for John E. Dalley for alder
man, and Klernan, Hurd and Chris.
Doerschuck for councllmen.
The democrats have finally succeeded
In finding eight men with sufficient te
nacity to run up against the strong
republican tickets and majorities in the
Second and Tenth wards. The nomina
tions in these wards were made yester
day and are as follews: Second ward-
Alderman, Joseph W. Hammond; coun
Oilmen, Frederick L. Scovlll, Patrick F.
Henchy and Louis E. Jacobs. Tenth
ward Henry C. Seabrook, alderman;
councllmen, Albert J: Parmelee, Her
man Voltz and Daniel J. Brennan.

New York, Dec. 3. The Evening Sun
prints an interview with President H.
O. Havemeyer of the Sugar trust. Mr.
Havemeyer said:
"Work has been resumed In the refin
eries on a very reduced scale. I do not
anticipate the passage of a free sugar
bill. The Franklin refinery in Phila
delphia Is working with a reduced
force. The Spreckels refinery is not
working at all. The Boston refinery is
working with about one-half the regu-
lar force. The Matthiesen and Weicher
refinery is with one-half force."
Mr. Havemeyer denied reports of dif
ferences with other directors.

James D. Dewell, received through the

ing upon It a paster wltto J. B. Sargent's
name upon It over the name of A. C.
Hendrlck and with other changes In
the ticket calculated to deceive re
publicans, wrong names being printed
for those of some of the republican
nominees oti the ward ticket.
The reception of this ticket recalled
to mind a letter he had received two
years ago from Mr. Sargent, in which
the views of the latter on the Issuing
of bogus tickets are so clearly s.M
forth as to need no further comment
The letter received by Mr. Dewell two
years ago. Is as follows; and will no
doubt highly interest the thousands of
voters In New Haven:
MAYOR'S OFFICE.
New Haven, Conn., Dec. 10, 1892.
James D. Dewell, Esq.:
Dear sir Your congratulations are
received and kindly accepted as you
request.
I am sorry to see my old party fallen
so low In political morality as to fraud
ulently Issue 10,000 ballots on the Holy
Sabbath Day of the Lord, purporting
to be Issued by another party. The
law passed by a republican legislature
stamps such work as fraudulent and
criminal. I trust the democratic party
will never follow down to such prac
tices. Yours truly,
J. H. SARGENT.
THE EARL OF ABERDEEN AT TALE.
Aa Interesting Addreu Before Member, of
Yale University.
The Earl of Aberdeen, governor gen
eral of Canada, addressed an immense
gathering of students in Dwight hall
at 7 o'clock last evening. The large
lecture hall was filled to Its utmost
capacity and many people crowded into
the' hallways and adjoining rooms In
order to match a glimpse of his earl-
ship.
. He made a strong impression on all
who listened to him as a man of high
culture and strong personality. He
gave an Informal talk rather than an
address, but he was listened to with
the closest attention. V
In his remarks he said: "I: do not
see as it makes much difference whether
a man believes fit the modern theorfes
of" the origin drthe world or as our
fathers believed. Alterations in - the
out phases In which, truth Is presented
do not change the vital truths and
principles of things. The educated
man should take high ground. Some
unfortunately have an Idea that their
Intellectual level Is heightened If they
give vent, to utterances of'tllsbellef. It
is belief that saves one from all that
distraction, which turns away from a
steady purpose. It is character and the
training implied' by character that tells
In the long run and helps to resist
temptation. We should aspire to a
recognition of the fact that In spite of
all business cares, a man should spend
a part of his life In striving to influ
ence. for good the government of city,
state or country.
"I consider a great benefit and privi
lege to be brought into contact with
such a robust body of young men. I
come as a representative from that
northern country with which I hope
your relations will grow' ever closer
and friendlier. It am glad to find that
Yale recognizes religion and learning as
interwoven and identical, and as the
years go on Yale will be more and more
recognized as a beacon light and an
Inspiring influence throughout the
world."
The earl Is being entertained by Pro
fessor O. C. Marsh at his residence on
Prospect street.He Is accompanied by
Lady Aberdeen, her brother, the Hon.
Arhclbald Majorbanks, and Mr. Hewitt,
his private secretary.
Professor Marsh, during his trips
abroad, has often been the guest of
Lord Aberdeen at his country seat In
Scotland, and also at the government
house in Ottawa, Can. After the gov
ernor general's stay in this city, he
wiM return immediately to Ottawa.

BOARD OF PARDONS Will, NOT IN.
TERFKBE IN TUB CASE.
The Murderer of Albert J. Skinner, the
Wiudaor Farmer, Will Pay tha Tonally of
Mia Crime on the Oallows Two Week
from To-day st 8tate I'rlsoo.
Hartford, Dec. 3. -The state board of
pardons held their regular meeting In
the supreme court room this afternoon
snd heard the cases of several prisoners
who made applications for a pardon
from the prison. The most Important
case which the board acted upon was
that of John Cronln, who was convicted
of the murder of Albert J. Skinner, a
farmer of South Windsor, who employed
Cronln.
Cronln's attorneys pleaded for com
mutation of Cronln's sentence on the
ground that the condemned man wus
suffering from Insanity when he com
mitted the deed. Attorney Mlldeber-
ger, Cronln's counsel, made a strong
plea for the man. Dr. Downs, who
was called as an expert, testified that
he had made a careful examination
of Cronln andj stated that In his opinion
Cronln was sound mentally.
The board heard all the evidence that
was produced in Cronln's favor and at
5 o'clock went Into executive session.
Half an hour later they returned to the
court room and it was announced that
they had decided not to interfere In
the case, and denied the pardon for
Cronln. The latter In the meantime
had been taken - back to the state
prison by Warden Woodbrldge In a car
riage. On the ride back to Wethers
field, the warden and the condemned
man engaged In conversation. The
warden asked Cronln what he thought
would be the result of the board's
hearing, and the latter replied that he
did not think that a pardon would be
granted.
"Then you will not be disappointed
if they should decide agalnBt you?"
asked the warden.
"No," was Cronln's reply.
Cronln said that he was ready to
meet his fate and the sooner that it
was over the better, so far as be was
concerned.
Cronln's manner is the same that he
has shown since he was imprisoned,
and is that of a BUllen unintelligent
character.
Cronln has not been notified of his
fate, and he will not hear of it until
Warden Woodbrldge receives official
notification of the action of the board
of pardons from Governor Morris.
This will come within a few days and
then Cronln will learn for the first
time .that hts fate Is sealed.
The execution, will take place on the
morning of December 18 next between
the hours of midnight and sunrise
There are no preparations to be made
for the new gallows is In position, and
Cronln could be executed In fifteen
minutes' notice. A coincidence of the
hearing to-day was the fact that a
convict named Roberts of Stamford
who has been serving out a sentence
for forgery, and who. prepared the
plans for the new gallows upon which
Cronln is to be hanged, was this after
noon granted a pardon by the board.
He - was to have served three years,
but -has only spent two years in the
prison. The board granted him the
pardon for good behavior.
The crime for which Cronln Is to be
hanged was committed last fall. .He
was sentenced March 24, 1894, to be
hanged on the 24th of last August. He
was reprieved until October 24 by the
governor, owing to the absence of Dr.
Francis Bacon of New Haven, who
was in Europe, in order that the whole
board1 would be present to hear Cronln's
petition.
