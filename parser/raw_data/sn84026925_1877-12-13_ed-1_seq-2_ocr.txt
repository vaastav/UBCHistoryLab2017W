the United States Senate stands. At present
that body consists of 75 members, with one

Absent. By the admission of Eustis, the Senate

the New York Evening Pott, says: "Senator
Patterson is very confident that his course in
the Senate in favoring the admission of Gen*
M. C. Butler to a seat in that body, will result
in relieving him from any further prosecution
for his alleged offences in South Carolina.
He received a dispatch from Columbia,
S. C., saying that the Democratic members of
the Legislature all favor a suspension of the
proceedings against him for alleged bribery,
and that their influence will be used in this
direction. Patterson says that the feeling

?The telegraph announces that Pinchback
has resigned his seat in the United States
Senate, and as our readers may not remember
just how he came to have a seat there, we
print the following : In 1873 he was declared
elected Senator from Louisiana for the term
ending March 4, 1879. In 1874 the same
Legislature endorsed him by joint resolution.
A new Legislature, chosen November, 1874,
adopted a joint resolution under which he
was elected, as if a vacancy existed. His certificate
bore the seal of the State, and was
sigued by the Governor and Secretary of
State, and Pinchback accordingly holds that
ho was entitled to a seat because of that action
of the Legislature. In order, however,
not to embarrass Mr. Kustis betore tbe senate,
Pinchback withdraws all claims to his seat.
? Some investigator of our political institutions
has been looking into tbe Constitutions
of the States, and finds that Maine,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Michigan
are now the only States that elect Governors
every year. Those that choose for two years
are Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, New York, Ohio, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin
; for three years, New Jersey and Pennsylvania;
for four years, Arkansas, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia and West
Virginia. Four States?New Hampshire,
Vermont, Rhode Island and Michigan?pay
their Governors only $1,000 a year ; Massachusetts
pays $5,000, and New York and
Pennsylvania pay each $10,000. The payroll
of the Governors of all the States is $284200.
? A Washington dispatch of the 5th, says
that the Commissioners of Claims nave sudmitted
the seventh of their reports, made at
the beginning of every regular session of Congress.
They report on 1,659 Southern claims.
The amount claimed is $5,761,106; the
amount allowed is $434,638. They made allowances
in 714 cases; and 945 are disallowed.
They report the general causes of total disallowances
to be either disloyalty on the part of
the claimant during the war, or failure to
prove active or constant loyalty, or to prove
that the property was taken for the actual
use of the Federal Army, or that it comes
within the term "stores or supplies," to which
their jurisdiction is confined. The great deductions
on allowed cases are due to differences
between values charged by claimants for
their property, and the value to the government,
or to the exclusion of items not within
the jurisdiction of the Commissioners, or to
failure to prove the accounts as charged. Under
an act of the last Congress, claimants who
have not yet proved up their claims are required
to do so before the 10th day of March
next; and the Commission itself to continue
no longer than March 10, 1879. The Commissioners
have still about 2,000 claims await
i ing final action, and no proofs at all have been
filed in about 8,600 cases, being fi'lly onethird
of those presented under the ii"t of
March 3,1871.

~ YORKVILLE, S, C.:
j THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 13, 1877.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
All the material portions of the President's
first annual message to Congress are printed on
the first page of this issue of the Enquirer.
To turn from the clumsy emanations of exPresident
Grant's fuddled brain, which were
inflicted upon a long-suffering people at stated
times for eight weary years, the message
of his Excellency .President Hayes, thougn a
lengthy document, is, nevertheless, "pleasant
reading," whether viewed as a composition
alone, or whether we look only to the measures
it advocates.
With the exception of the terseness of
Governor Hampton's last message, and the
fact that he treats only of matters pertaining
to our own State, there is sufficient similarity
between the two documents to warrant the
belief that the political idealities of the two
executive officers run in the same groove.
While both are moderate in the tone of their
expressions, they are yet firm in the utterance
of their convictions; and as any criticism
which we might now make of President
Hayes cannot extend prior to the day he
tnnk the oath of office, candor compels us to
say that we believe he is no less actuated by
a desire to serve his country well, than is our
own idolized Governor.
As will be seen by perusal of the message,
the President manfully stands up to his action
in withdrawing military rule from Louisiana
and South Carolina, defending bis course in
the premises, and assuring the country that
time will fully vindicate the wisdom of that
policy. True, there has already appeared
some captious criticism of this portion of the
message. The New York Herald querulously
asks if the President is now so bold in defence
of his policy in this respect, why did he so long
delay putting it into execution, and intimates
that if he had withdrawn the troops within
three or four days after his inauguration, the
action would have been more in accord with
the theory of the message. Looking through
the Herald's glasses this may seem true. But
we of South Carolina, who are probably more
deeply interested, are only glad to know that
the President did withdraw the troops, and
we are willing to admit that to his action we
are in a great measure indebted for the quiet,
stable government we now enjoy. Why the
delay, we think it not now pertinent to
enquire?only feeling thankful that the day
of deliverance did come, and having no inclination
to reject it because deferred. With all
the pressure bearing upon the President, and
considering that it was a bold step outside the
policy of the acknowleged leaders of his party,
we are willing to make some allowance for the
delay; and more willingly when we reflect
that President Hayes is only a man and not
imbued with the wonderful sagacity and statesmanship
which so emiuently characterize the
writer in the Herald. Were the reins of gov|
ernment in the hands of the paragraphist of
the Herald, we doubt not but this earth would
be an elysium, and we would all feel that the
millennium was not far off. But while Mr.
Hayes was slow in adopting his policy, he new
congratulates the country upon the fact that
all apprehension of danger from remitting two
of the Southern States to local self government
is dispelled, and that there has been a
general reestablishment of order.
Ou the subject of currency, whether the
views of the President are fully in accord with
the views of the Southern people, or whether
his views, if adopted, would prove embarrassing
to the people of this section, his arguments
do not seem to be prompted by sectionalism
or controlled by any particular money
aIodc Tn hin Hpsirp thaf. the reflumntion of
specie payment shall not be retarded, he
makes himself plainly understood.
His recommendation of a tax on tea and
coffee will doubtless meet more universal opposition
than any recommendation be makes,
inasmuch as the proposition is not with the
view of increasing the volume of revenue from
internal sources, bat simply to tatce tne
burthen from other subjects and place it upon
these two articles of daily consumption and
prime necessity. Yet the experience of other
countries is that tea and coffee can bear a
tax the same as other luxuries?the duty
falling lightly on each consumer.
While the message could not be expected
to give all sections of the Republic equal satisfaction,
and apply equally to the wants and
requirements of so many diversified interests,
it is nevertheless conceived in a liberal spirit
and will go far towards restoring confidence
throughout the country.
THE MOFFET LIQUOR REGISTER.
The practicability of the Moffet liquor reg_i?j
i -f t
lsier, piaueu uy nui ui tuc uc^iaiaiuic v>? t i?ginia
in the bar-rooms of that State, has been
satisfactorily demonstrated after an experience
of about three months, and the attention of
other States is being turned to the expedient
as a means of increasing their public revenue.
At the last session of the Legislature of this
State, the following resolution was adopted :
"That the special committee to investigate
alleged frauds be instructed to ascertain if the
law of Virginia, relating to the sale of spirituous
and malt liquors, can be made available
i in this State, and they are hereby authorized
to report by bill or otherwise to the next
General Assembly."
We learn from the Columbia Register that
i the duty thus devolved upon the committee
j has been discharged, and they will, at an
early day, make their report offering a bill
I for the introduction of the register system in
I this State in connection with the granting of
j liquor licenses as now provided by law, issued
j under the authority of corporate towns and
j cities, and the grand juries. The general
features of the Virginia law are understood
by the reading public, and we presume those
features will be retained in the bill proposed
to be introduced in our Legislature. The
I Moffet law simply levies a tax upon every
drink of spirituous and malt liquors, and provides
a system of registration whereby the
number of drinks sold in a barroom are unerringly
recorded, aud by the figures on the
dial-plate of the register the liquor-seller is required
to make his payment of tax at stated
times. While the measure will have its advocates
in this State, it will also have its opponents.
It was noticeable, pending the discussion
of the law in Virginia, that it was opposed
by leading temperance advocates in
thatState. One thing certain, while its adoption
in this State would not diminish the consumption
of liquor, it would certainly increase
the revenue.
proceedingsTof congress.
In the House on the 4th, bills were introduced
and passed, repealing the law disqualifying
jurors on account of participation in the
rebellion, and eliminating from the Btatute all
provisions of the test oatb. Bills were introduced
and referred as follows: By Money, of
Mississippi, amending the act relating to the
payment of the net proceeds of cotton seized
after June, 1865. By Ellsworth, of Michigan,
for general amnesty. By Boker, of Indiana,
for a constitutional amendment prohibiting
payment for the loss or damage growing
out of the seizure or destruction of property
during the war. A resolution for recess from
the 19th of December to the 10th of January
was offered and referred.
On the 5th, the House consumed the day
discussing whether bills for the improvement
upon rivers and harbors should go to the committee
on commerce, or the committee on rail
ways and canals. The question was referred
to the committee on rules.
In the Senate on the 6th, the House silver
bill was made the special order for the 11th
instant, by a vote of 41 to 18, which is understood
to threaten a defeat of the veto, should
the President adhere to the doctrines enunciated
on this subject in his message. Mr.
Matthews introduced a preamble and resolution
setting forth that by the act to strengthen
the public credit, passed in 1870, all debts of
the United States were made payable, and
bonds were made redeemable in coin of the
then standard value, and whereas that coin
included silver dollars of 4121 grains, therefore
be it resolved, that all debts of the United
States are payable at the option of the
United States in silver dollars of 4121 grains
each. Laid on the table and ordered to be
printed. Several changes were announced in
" * * *1 - O H/T
the standing committees or toe oeuate. mr.
Butler, of South Carolioa, is on the military
committee, and on the select committee on
transportation routes to the seaboard. A
number of petitions were presented, among
them several from the National banks of Boston,
Mass., and Providence, R. I., against the
passage of a silver bill. In the House, efforts
were made by Mr. Joyce and Mr. Blair to introduce
very strong Cuban resolutions, but
objection was made to them. Three reports
were submitted from the committee on elections
in the Colorado case, the majority report
recommending that Patterson, (Dem.) be
seated. Mr. Waddell reported the annual
post-route bill, which was passed, aud at 2 P.
M., the House adjourned.
In the Senate on the 7th, Mr. Sargent, from
the committee on naval affairs, reported, with
amendment, the House bill for the relief of
the sufferers by wreck of the Huron. The
amendment provides for the payment to the
heirs of those lost on the Huron a sum equal
to twelve months' sea pay; to the heirs of
Capt. Guthrie, of the life-saving service, a sum
equal to his compensation for one year, and to
those belonging to the wrecking steamer, ?.
and J. Baker?the last in attempting to save
those on board the Huron?one hundred dollars
each. The amendment was agreed to
and the bill passed. Mr. Mitchell, of Oregon,
called up the resolution to extend the time
for the completion of the Northern Pacific
Railroad, the discussion of which occupied the
greater portion of the day. Mr. Morgan, of
Alabama, asked the aid of Congress in the
improvement of the navigation of Mobile bay.
Referred to the committee on commerce. Mr.
Edmunds, of Vermont, called up the resolution
submitted by him directing the AttorneyGeneral
to communicate to the Senate, as soon
aa may be, a list of all criminal prosecutions
commenced in tbe Courts of the United States
in the district of South Carolina since tbe 1st
day of January, 1876, for offences against
lives, property, civil rights or right of suffrage
of any person, with names of the alleged offender
and a statement of the disposition of such
prosecutious and the dates thereof. Agreed
to. The Senate concurred in the House joint
resolution to adjourn from the 15th of December
to the 10th of January. Adjourned
to Monday. In the House, it was agreed to
adjourn on the 15th for the holidays, and convene
on the 10th of January. Mr. Stephens
introduced a bill amendatory to the act incorporating
the Texas Pacific Railroad. Mr.
Shelly, of Alabama, introduced a bill relative
to Chinese immigration. It imposes a fine of
$250 per head on each Chinaman coming into
the United States after January 1st, 1879.
This amount is virtually proscriptive. Gen.
Shelly does this to protect the colored laboreis
of the South from the perils that threaten the
white laborers of California, who are reported
to be approaching starvation from the demoralizing
competition the Chinese offer. Bills
were passed removing the political disabilities
of Win. A. Cornwall, of Georgia, and W. A.
Evans, of Louisiana, for the relief of the city
" ? r*\ 1 _ i.1

Adjourned till Monday.
In the Senate on the 10th, Eustis, of Louisiana,
was seated by a vote of 49 to 8. Sargent
introduced a bill to restrict Chinese immigration.
Maxcy presented a petition of
the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians against
the passage of a bill to enable the Indians to
become citizens. The Texas Pacific Railroad
bill was introduced by Johnson, of Virginia.
Matthews called up his resolution declaring
that the Government could pay its bonded
debt in silver. He spoke at great leugth.
Morrill spoke in opposition, and moved a reference
to the committee on the judiciary.
Pending the discussion, the Senate adjourned.
In the House the relations between Mexico
and the United States Government were discussed,
the general sentiment prevailing
| among members that this Government should
I preserve peaceful relations with Mexico.

i The motion for a new trial in the case
of ex- Assistant Secretary Sawyer, ex-Coramissioner

In the course of his remarks on granting
the order, the Judge said :
i "It was apparent at the trial, and it is made
more so by what has taken place since, that
! the defeat of trial to which the defendants
were subjected is, perhaps, more palpable
than an? case that has ever been presented
for my consideration. From some cause or
. other, perhaps not exclusively owing to their
own neglect, these defendants have not had
the advantage of a full defence. The want
| of preparation was evident from the first moment
that the trial began. The parties appeared*tobe
wandering and feeling their way
through. I am inclined to think, upon the
whole, it would be exercising sound discrej
tion on the part of the Court, under these ciri
cumstances, to give these parties one more
) chance. The order then may be made grant1
ing a new trial."

A BEAUTIFUL PHENOMENON.
Star-gazers and others interested in the
subject of astronomy, were gratified last Saturday
evening by the beautiful celestial spectacle
afforded by the close proximity of the
new moon and the planet Veuus. At halfpast
5 the planet was opposite the centre oi
the crescent, equi-distant betweeu the horns
and close to the visible edge of the moon,
representing precisely the symbols on tbe
Turkish flag. The positions gradually changed,
and by 7 o'clock Venus rested on tbe
lower horu of the crescent, and was partially
eclipsed. By 8 o'clock the two were some
distance apart. The transit of Venus across
the moon's disc is a phenomenon of unusual
occurrence?happening, we believe, once in
about every twenty years?and on this occasion
was viewed here by quite a number of
interested persons.

man, Col. W. B. Metts, has branched out in
a new business, and one which will no doubt
prove profitable to himself, while it will prove
beneficial to the people generally, demonstrating,
as we think it will, that fruit culture can
be made a lucrative and profitable business in
York county. During the present fall, Col.
Metts has planted near Yorkville, an orchard
of one thousand peach trees, using only the
choicest and most select varieties, with the
> view of cultivating fruit for market. When
> the trees become of bearing age, Col. Mettt
will ship fruit to the Northern markets, and
such as is not disposed of in this manner and
gold from the trees for home consumption, he
i will utilize by desicating?the demand foi
' dried fruit always exceeding the supply. We
hail this new enterprise of Col. Metts with
* pleasure, as another step in the right direction
for the development of the resources of out
i generous soil and genial climate.

"THE USURY BILL.
. i
Columbia, December 12.
The House passed, yesterday, to a third
reading, by a vote of 73 to 17, a bill to re- 1
strict the rate of interest on all contracts to
seven per cent., and not allowing parties to
recover, in any Court, any portion of interest
unlawfully charged.
This bill passed the Senate at the last session,
and will probably pass the third reading
in the House without amendment. i. d. w.

LETTER FROM ROCK HILL.
Rock Hill, S. C., December 10.
Nothing new nor startling has disturbed the
quiet of our little town since my last letter.
The investigating committee have held a
two days' session here. They took the testimony
of Major 8. P. Hamilton, M. L. Owens
and ex Judge Wright. What was developed
has not been disclosed, as the members of the
commission persist in secret sessions and remain
reticent on the subject of investigation.
Ebenezer,our sister town, still keeps up her
timehonored reputation of having good
schools. We had the pleasure of quite alively
debate at the school of Mr. Strait, on Friday
night last. Four of bis male pupils constituted
the debating club for that night. The
subject chosen was?Which is the more useful
to mankind, the cow or the horse? It
was ably argued, pro and eon. The committee
chosen from the audience to decide the
question from the force of arguments made on
either side, in defence of the indispensable
cow aud noble horse, decided that the affirmative
side had argued somewhat moreclearlv
and forcibly, and were entitled to a decision
ia their favor. The young men gave evidence
of natural ability and good teaching. It is
certainly gratifying to see such progress in
the youths of our country, who will be called
upon in after years to fill the seats now occupied
by President Hayes and Gov. Hampton,
and have the legislative halls echo the sound
of their voices, whose telling eloquence will reflect
a lasting credit upon their State and
honor to themselves.
The Rock Hill Silver Cornet Band, wliich
now bears a very good. comparison with the
post band of Columbia, discoursed very sweet
and lively music between each argument of
the debate, which added greatly to the enjoyment
of the occasion ; there being many fair
faces and hearts warm with enthusiasm for the
noble contestants. The evening was pleasantly
and most profitably spent.

The Vsory Bill.
The following are the provisions of the
hill "to regulate the rate of interest on all con*
tracts arising in this State," which passed the

> than seven ner centum ner annum shall be

1 "Sec. 2. That no person or corporation
1 lending or advancing money or other commodity
upon a greater rate of iutereat than is
, provided for in Section 1 of this Act, shall be
allowed to recover iu any Court of this State
any portion of the interest so unlawfully
charged, and that the principal sum, amount
or value so lent or advauced, without any interest,
shall he deemed and taken hy the
Courts of this State to be the true legal debt
or measure of damages to all intents and pur'
poses whatsoever, to be recovered without
CO0t8."

Death of Gen. Hnger.
P Geo. Benjamin Huger died at his residence,
in Charleston, on Friday last Gen.
Huger was bora oa the 22ad of November,
. 1805. He graduated from the Military
Academy at West Point in 1825, and was
assigned to duty in the artillery service. In
, 1831 he was transferred to the ordnance corps
and served for many years as commander of
the Arsenal at Fortress Monroe. He was
afterwards Chief of Ordnance to Gen. Scott's
army in Mexico, where he obtained three
brevets as a recognition of his conspicuous
conduct and ability.
On the breaking out of the war in 1861,
he resigned his commission in the United
States Army and repaired to Richmond, and
offered his services to the Confederate au*
thorities. He was at once appointed a Brigadier-General
and assigned to the command
of the Department of Norfolk, Va., which
he conducted with marked ability. He or.
ganized a fine division, was soon promoted
to Major-General, and evacuated Norfolk in
obedience to orders in May, 1862, bringing
off his command and all the public property,
practically without loss. He participated
in the battles around Richmond, continuing
^ in the service of the Confederacy until its
close, when he was ordered to the Trans Mississippi
Department. He subsequently settle
nnnn a farm in Fauuuier county. Virgin- i
' ia, but a kind Providence decreed that he
* should die at his old home, surrounded by
his family and friends,
f Patterson Dismissed from Arrest.
i In Washington, on the 5th instant,
Judge Humphries delivered his opinion in
. the matter of John J. Patterson relator, on a
i habeas corpus to be relieved from a warrant |
! of arrest on a requisition of the Governor of i
. South Carolina. There were present among
1 others, Senator Patterson and two of his
f counsel, namely: Messrs. Cook and Sheila-!
barger, and Mr. Lowndes, attorney for South
Carolina. The Judge's opinion was elabo.
rate. He denied the power of the State of
South Carolina to vacate Senator Patterson's
| commission, which must continue until consti- '
;: tutioually revoked, in pursuance of organic j
I authority. It could not be said that Senator
Patterson was a fugitive from justice, as be
was here in the discbarge of official duties
like all otber members of Congress, and besides,
be had acted in the capacity of Senator
years before the present indictment was V
brought against him in the South Carolina 9
Court. The writ was granted and the de- 1
fendant discharged. The decision concludes g
in the following language:
"I think I am bound to take judicial cognizance
that party organization is one thing, *
and faction to destroy it is another. The '
most cruel tyranny would be the application
of civil forms of law to the dominance aud
triumph of the passions of a faction. I cannot
reconcile it to my sense of duty to give ^
aid in placing manacles and handcuffs around
and about the individual ritizen for the purpose
of surrendering him. bound, into the
hands of those who may not be dispassionate
enough to vindicate the true rights of the individual,
or to those who might be led by impassioned
appeals to a condition of mind they
could not resist. Zeal for the correction of
wrong haa often led to the conviction of the
innocent. It is the duty of the courts to sit
still and deliberate, and with civil procedure
to throw their protection in such a direction
as may curb and control wayward action.
Let the man be remanded to the body of
which be is a member. That body is legally,
constitutionally, morally, intellectually capacitated
to dispose of the questions involved,
and to condemn or acquit. I discharge him
from arrest of the warrant for his extradition,
and the same is hereby ordered."
The Richmond Diipaich, a strong Democratic
journal, commenting upon the decision, )>
says: "No doubt Patterson is a scamp, but ^
the decision of Judge Humphries is right." j
SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE. ]
Columbia, Tuesday Dec. 4,1877. jfl
In the Senate, the proceedings wor^frincipaily
of a routine character and present
nothing of special interest. jj
In the House, Mr. Guignard introduced *
a bill to prevent improper charges for ad- a
vances to planters and others. i
Mr. J. J. Hemphill introduced a bill to alter
aud amend an act which refers to the
charter of the town of Chester.

pay of witnesses in State cases.
Mr. Wells introduced a bill to authorize
the Secretary of State to extend the time for
the payment of purchase money for tracts of
lands purchased of the Land Commissioner,
for one year.
Mr. Sheppard, of the committee on ways
and means, made an unfavorable report on
bill to provide for the election of County
Treasurers and Auditors, and a favorable report
on bill to restore to their former owners
all lands forfeited to the State for taxes.
A message was read from the Governor, in- ^
forming the legislature that Attorney Gener- |
al Conner had sent in his resignation. It 1
dealt in words very complimentary to Gener- ^^9
al Conner, highly praising the valuable services
he had rendered the State, and deeply fl
regretting that he had felt constrained to re- V
sign. On motion of Mr. Simpson, it was re- ^
ceived as information. |1
Mr. Blue offered a resolution thanking At- i
torney General Conner for the able manner
in which he bad discharged the dutiea of his
office.
The House proceeded to the consideration
of the report of the special committee appointed
to prepare articles of impeachment
against J. J. Wright, Associate Justice of r
the Supreme Court. The report set forth the \
fact that before the committee had entered
upon the discharge of their duties, Judge
Wright had resigned his office. It went on

perinduced by any action of theirs. After
some short debate, the report of the commit- -4
tee was adopted.
A bill to regulate the rate of interest on all
contracts arising in this State was next called
up. Mr. Ferriter moved to strike out the
enacting clause, but bis motion was lost.
Mr. Brown advocated the bill. The people
of the State, he said, were crushed and - I
ground down by having to pay extortionate
rates of interest on money. Sigh rates of
interest tempted capitalists to loan out money
and thereby make people poorer, instead of
investing in legitimate enterprises, mauufac- V
tures, &c., aud benefitting the State. He 1
thought that it was better that money should
not come into the State at all, than that it t
should come to be used for the benefit of the
few to the detriment of the many. \
Mr. Brown was replied to by Mr. Meraminger,
who expressed surprise at hearing such
views advanced. He said that he was a member
of the House for many years, and that
during the time, no gentleman of intelligence
would have advocated the views expressed
bv the honorable centleman who favors
the usury law proposed by the bill now before
the House. He asks us to travel back
200 years. We want capital to come into
the State, but we cannot force it. We must
invite it We have no right to fix the price
of any commodity by legislation. Will you
say to the cotton seller, you shall not receive J
more than ten cents a pound for cotion ? or f
to the bacon dealer, you shall not charge
more than fifteen cents a pound for bacon ?
We cannot fix the price of any of these commodities,
and what is the difference between
them and money? The men who have money
to lend are not the ones to build up our industries;
but the borrowers are the ones.
None will come here and spend their money
for the benefit of the country. I inform my
friend on the other side that banks, when ^
they are not connected with the government, ]
barely pay expenses. It is very seldom, even J
with the most economical aud judicious management,
that a bank pays au aunual dividend
of 7 per cent. The great reason of the
high rate of interest which is charged in
South Carolina, is one that you will not fail |
to perceive. The State is proceeding on a
false basis of taxation. It taxes both debits
and credits. The State taxes money, and interest
is ohliped to be hiirher in this State
than anywhere else. The State, by this vicious
system of taxation, makes a high rate
of interest absolutely necessary. Mr. Memminger
went on to elaborate the various
points of hia argument The venerable legislator
was listened to with marked attention
and interest, and his words seemed to prodace
a deep impression.
Mr. Connor followed in support of the bill.
His argument was maiuly devoted to establishing
the fallacy of the proposition that *
money was like other commodities. It differ- %
ed from them, he contended, inasmuch as its
quality was fixed, unlike other articles of com- j
merce or manufacture. '
Mr. Aldrich followed in an argument of
some length in opposition to the bill, and cou- -
tinued until the hour of adjournment.
Wednesday, December 5.
In the Senate, the bill to authorize the ,,
County Commissioners in the several counties
of the State to allow the erection of gates
upon the highways of the State, wherever, in
their judgment, the same may be expedient,
was referred to the Committee on Roads,
Bridges and Ferries.
In the House, Mr. Curtis introduced a
bill to exempt from poll tax all persons who
have lost one or more limbs.
At 1 o'clock the Sergeant-at-Arms announced
that the Senate was ready to be admitted.
The Senators then marched in,
headed by President Simpson, and took the
seats assigned them. President Simpson took
the chair aud called the joint assembly to order.
He stated that they had convened for
the nurnose of electing a Circuit Judore to fill
the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of
Judge Northrop, of the 7th Circuit; Associate
Justice to supply the vacancy caused by the
resignation of J. J. Wright; and an Attorney
General, to t&ke the position made vacant by
the resignation of General Conner.
The Clerk then read the rules governing
such elections, and the Chair stated that the
elections would take place in the order they
