THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Sensible Views and Recommendations Ex?
pressed Most Politely.
The more important parts of President
Arthur's Annual Message, which was
presented to Congress yesterday, are as
follows:
Since the close of your last session the
American people, in the exercise of their
highest right of suffrage, have chosen
their Chief Magistrate for the four years
ensuing. When it is remembered that,
at do period in the country's history has
the long political contest which custom?
arily precedes the day of the national
election jeen waged with greater fervor
and intensity, it is a subject of general
congratulation that, after the controversy
at the pol la was over, and while the slight
preponderance by which the issue bad
been determined was as yet unascertained,
the public peace puffered no disturbance,
but the people everywhere patiently and
quietly awaited the result. Nothing
could more strikingly illustrate the tem?
per of the American citizen, his love of
order and his loyalty to law. Nothing
could more signally demonstrate the
strength and wisdom of our political
institutions.
Eight years have pussed since a con?
troversy concerning the result of a na?
tional election sharply called the attention
of the Congress to the necessity of pro?
viding more precise and definite regula?
tions for counting the electoral vote. It
is of the gravest importance that this
question be solved before conflicting
claims to the Presidency shall again dis?
tract the country, and I am persuaded
that by the people at large any of the
measures of relief thuo proposed would
be preferred to continued inaction.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign powers
continue to be amicable.
With France the traditional cordial
relationship continued. The colossal
statue of Liberty enlightening the world,
the generousg.."t of the people of France,
is expected to reach New York in May
next. I suggest that Congressional
action be taken in recognition of the
spirit which has prompted this gift and
in aid of the timely completion of the
pedestal upon which it is to be placed.
THE HAWAIIAN TREATY.
The Government of Hawaii has indi?
cated its willingness to continue for seven
years the provisions of the existing
reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in
view of the relations of that country to
the American system of States, should,
in my judgment, be favored.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of
the best elements of citizenship, continue
to be cordial.
THE DUTY ON WORKS OF ART,
Much anxiety has lately been display?
ed by various European Governments, and
especially by the Government of Italy,
for the abolition of our import duties
upon works of art. It is well to consider
whether the present discrimiuation in
favor of the productions of American
artists abroad is not likely to result, as
they themselves seem very generally to
believe it may, in the practical exclusion
of our painters and sculptors from the
rich fields for observation, study and
labor which they have hitherto enjoyed.
MEXICO.
During the past year the increasing
good will between our own Government
and that of Mexico has been variously
manifested. The treaty of commercial
reciprocity, concluded January 20, 1883,
has been ratified, and awaits the necessa?
ry tariff legislation of Congress to become
effective. This legislation, will, I doubt
not, be among the first measures to claim
your attention.
A full treaty of commerce, navigation
and consular rights is much to be desired,
and such a treaty, I have reason to be?
lieve, the Mexican Government stands
ready to conclude.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
With the Republic of Nicaragua a trea?
ty has been concluded which authorizes
the construction by the United States of
a canal, railway and telegraph line across
the Nicarauguan territory. By the terms
of this treaty sixty miles of the River
San Juan, as well as Lake Nicaragua, an
inland sea forty miles in width, are to
constitute a part of the projected enter?
prise. This leaves for actual canal con?
struction seventeen miles on the Pacific
side and thirty-six miles on the Atlantic.
To the United States, whose rich territory
on tbe Pacific is, for the ordinary purpo?
ses of commerce, practically cut off from
communication by water with the Atlan?
tic ports, the political and commercial
advantages of such a project can scarcely
be overestimated. It is believed that when
tbe treaty is laid before you the justice
and liberality of its provisions will com?
mand universal approval at home and
abroad.
CURAN INSURGENTS.
This Government has more than once
been called upon of late to take action
in fulfillment of its international obliga?
tions toward Spain. Agitation in the
Island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish
Crown having been fomented by persons
abusing the sacred rights of hospitality
which our territory afiords, tbe officers of
this Government have been instructed to
exercise vigilance to prevent infractions
of our neutrality laws at Key West and
at other points near tbe Cuban coast. In
the only instance where these precau?
tionary measures were successfully eluded
tbe offenders when found in our territory
were subsequently tried and convicted.
THE SPANISH TREATY.
The growing need of close relationship
of intercourse and traffic between the
Spanish Antilles and their natural mar?
ket in the United States led to tbe adop?
tion, in January last of a commercial
agreement looking to that end. This
agreement has since been superseded by
a more carefully framed and comprehen?
sive convention which I shall submit to
tbe Senate for approval. It has been tbe
aim of this negotiation to open such a
favored reciprocal exchange of produc?
tions carried under tbe lag of either
country, as to make the intercourse
between Cuba and Porto Rico and our?
selves scarcely less intimate than tbe
commercial movement between our
domestic ports, and to insure a removal
of the burdens on shipping in the Span?
ish Indies, of which iu tbe past our ship
owners and ship masters have so often
had cause to complain.
THE NEUTRALITY LAWS.
I recommend that the scope of tbe
neutrality laws of tbe United States be
so enlarged as to cover all patent acts of
hostility committed in our territory and
aimed against tbe peace of a friendly
nation. Existing statutes prohibit the
fitting out of armed expeditions and
restrict the shipment of explosives,
though tbe enactments in the latter
respect were not framed with regard to
international obligations, but simply for
the protection of passenger travel. All
tbeBe statutes were intended to meet
special emergencies that bad already
arisen. Other emergencies have arisen
since, and modern ingenuity supplies
means for tbe organization of hostilities
without open resort to armed vessels or
to filibustering parties. I see no reason
wby the preparations in tbis country for
the commission of criminal acts, such as
are here under consideration, should not
be alike punishable whether such acts
are intended to be committed in our own
country or in a foreign country with
which we are at peace. The prompt and
thorough treatment of this question is
one which intimately concerns the na?
tional honor.
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
The legislation of the last session
effected in the diplomatic and consular
service certain changes and reductions
which have been productive of embarrass?
ment. Tbe population and commercial
activity of our country are steadily on
the increase and are giving rise to new,
varying and often delicate relationships
with other countries. Our foreign estab?
lishment now embraces nearly double tbe
area of operations that it occupied
twenty years ago. The confinement of
such a service within tbe limits of ex?
penditure then established is not, it seems
to me, in accordance with true economy.
A community of sixty millions of people
should be adequately represented in its
intercourse with foreign nations. A
project f")r the reorganization of the
consular service and for recasting the
scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction is
now before you. If tbe limits of a short
session will not allow of its full consid?
eration, I trust that you will not fail to
make suitable provision for the present
needs of tbe service.
THE REVENUES.
The ordinary revenues for tbe fiscal
year ending June 30, 1884, were $348,
519,869.92. The public expenditures
during tbe same period were $290,916,473.
Leaving a surplus of ?57,603,396 as com?
pared with the preceding fiscal year.
There was a net decrease of over $21,
000,000 in the amornt of expenditures.
The aggregate receipts were less than
those of the year previous by about
$54,000,000. The falling off in revenue
from customs made up nearly $20,000,000
of this deficienc;- ?nd about $23,000,000
of the remainder was due to the dimin?
ished receipts from internal taxation.
The secretary estimates tbe total
receipts for the fiscal year which will end
June 30,1885, at $330,000,000, and the
total expenditures at $290,620,201.16, in
which sum are included the interest on
the debt and the amou ' payable to the
sinking fund. This wt id leave a sur?
plus for tbe entire year of about $39,000,
000.
EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.
The value of exports from the United
States to foreign countries during tbe
year ending June 30, 1884, was as fol?
lows: Domestic merchandise, $724,964,
852; foreign merchandise, $15,548,757.
Total merchandise, $740,513,609; specie,
$67,133,383. Total exports of merchan?
dise and specie, $807,646,992. The cot?
ton and cotton manufactures included in
this statement were valued at $208,900,
415; the breadstufls at $162,544,715;
the provisions at $114,416,547, and the
mineral oils at $47,103,248. During the
same period the imports were as follows:
Merchandise, $667,697,693; gold and
silver, $37,426,262. Total, $705,123,955.
THE SILVER COINAGE.
I concur with tbe secretary of the
treasury in recommending tbe immedi?
ate suspension of the coinage of silver
dollars, and of tbe issuance of silver
certificates. The number now outstand?
ing is nearly one hundred and eighty-five
million whereof but little more than
forty million, or less than 22 per cent.,
are in actual circulation. The secretary
asserts his conviction that unless this
coinage and the issuance of silver cer?
tificates be suspended, silver is likely, at
no distant day, to become our sole metal?
lic standard. The commercial disturb?
ance and tbe impairment of national
credit that would be thus occasioned can
scarcely be overestimated. I hope that
the secretary's suggestions respecting the
withdrawal from circulation of tbe one
dollar and two dollar notes will receive
your approval. It is likely that a con?
siderable portion of tbe silver now
encumbering the vaults of the treasury
might thus find its way into the currency.
INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES.
In my annual message of 1882 I re?
commended the abolition of all excise
taxes except those relating to distilled
spirits. This recommendation is now
renewed. Iu case those taxes shall be
abolished tbe revenues that will still re?
main to the Government will, in my
opinion, not only suffice to meet its
reasonable expenditures, but will afford
a surplus large enough to permit such
tariff reduction as may seem to be ad?
visable when the results of recent reve?
nue laws and commercial treaties shall
have shown in what quarters those re?
ductions can be most judiciously affected.
FOREIGN TRADE.
One of tbe gravest of the problems
which appeal to tbe wisdom of Congress
for solution is tbe ascertainment of tbe
most effective means for increasing our
foreign trade, and thus relieving the
depression under which our industries
are now languishing. The secretary of
the treasury advises that the duty of
investigating tbis subject be intrusied in
the first instance to a competent com?
mission. While fully recognizing tbe
considerations tbat may be urged against
this course, I am nevertheless of the
opinion that, upon the whole, no other
would be likely to effect speedier or better
results. That portion of the secretary's
report which concerns the condition of
our shipping interests cannot fail to com?
mand your attention. He emphatically
recommends that as an incentive to the
investment of American capital in
American steamships the Government
shall, by liberal payments for mail trans?
portation or otherwise, lend its active
assistance to individual enterprise, and
declares his belief that unless tbat
course be pursued our foreign carrying
trade must remain as it is to day?almost
exclusively in the hands of foreigners.
One phase of tbis subject is now especi?
ally prominent in view of the repeal by
the Act of June 26.1884, of all statutory
provisions arbitrarily compelling Ameri?
can vessels to carry the mails to and
from the United States. As it is neces?
sary to make provision to compensate
the owners of such vessels for performing
that service after April, 1885, it is hoped
that the whole subject will receive early
consideration and will lead to the enact?
ment of such measures for the revival of
our merchant marine as the wisdom of
Congress may devise.
THE NATIONAL BANKS.
As the 3 per cent, bonds still constitute
tbe chief basis for the circulation of tbe
national banks, the question how to
avert the contraction of the curreucy
caused by their retirement, is one of con-*
stantly increasing importance. It seems
to be generally conceded tbat the law
governing this matter exacts from the
banks excessive security, and that upon
their present bond deposits a larger
circulation than is now allowed may be
grated with safety. I hope that the bill
which passed the Senate at the last
session, permitting the issue of notes
equal to the face value of the deposited
bonds, will commend itself to the ap?
proval of the House of Representatives.
RIVERS AND HARBORS.
The funds with which the works for
the improvement of rivers and harbors
were prosecuted during the past year
were derived from the appropriations of
the act of August 2,1882. together with
such few balances as were on hand from
previous appropriations. Tbe balance
in the treasury subject to requisition
July 1, 1883, was $10.021,649.55. The
amount appropriated during the fiscal
year 1884 was $1,319.634.62, and the
amount drawn from the treasury during
the fiscal year was $8,228,703. r4, leaving
a balance of $3,112,580.63 in tue -reasury
subject to requisition July 1,1884.
FORTIFICATIONS.
The secretary of war submits the
report of the chief of engineers as to
the practicability of protecting our im?
portant cities on tbe seaboard by forti?
fications and other defences able to repel
modern methods of attack. The time
has now come when such defences can be
prepared with confidence that they will
not prove abortive, and when tbe possible
result of delay in making such prepara?
tions is seriously considered delay seems
inexcusable. For tbe most important
cities, those wbose destruction or capture
would be a national humiliation, ade?
quate defences inclusive of guns may be
made by the gradual expenditure of
$60,000,000, a sum which is less than a
victorious enemy could levy as a contri?
bution. &o appropriation of about one
tenth of that amount is asked tor to begin
the work, and I concur with the secretary
of war in urging that it be granted.
NEW WAR VESSELS.
The recommendations of the naval
advisory board approved by the depart?
ment comprise the construction of one
steel cruiser of 4,500 loos, one cruiser of
3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats,
one light cruising gunboat, one dispatch
vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one
armed ram and three torpedo boats. The
general designs, all of which are calcula?
ted to meet the existing wanis of the
service, are now well advanced and the
construction of the vessels can be under?
taken as soon as you shall grant tbe
necessary authority.
THE NAVY.
In this tbe last of tbe stated messages
that I shall have the honor to transmit
to the Congress of tbe United States I
cannot too strongly urge upon its atten?
tion the duty of restoring our navy as
rapidly as possible to the high state of
efficiency which formerly characterized
it. As tbe long peace that has lulled us
into a sense of fancied security may at
any time be disturbed, it is plain that
the policy of strengthening this arm of
the service is dictated by considerations
of wise economy, of a just regard for
our future tranquility and of a true
appreciation of tbe dignity and honor of
the Republic.
REDUCTION OF POSTAGE.
I confidently repeat the recommenda?
tion of my last annual message that the
siugle rate postige upon drop letters be
reduced to one cent wberever the pay?
ment of two cents is now required by
law. I approve the recommendation of
the postmaster general that the unit of
weight in tbe rating of first-class matter
shouid be one ounce instead of one halt
ounce as it now is.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The attorney-general renews the recom?
mendation contained in his report of last
year touching the fees of witnesses and
jurors. He favors radical changes in
tbe fee bill, the adoption of a system by
which attorneys and marshals of tbe
United States shall be compeusated
solely by salaries, and the erection by
the Government of a penitentiary for the
confinement of offenders against tbe
laws of the United States.
THE EXTENSION OF OUR COMMERCE.
In the course of this communication
reference has more than once been made
to the policy of this Government as
regards the extension of our foreign
trade. It seems proper to declare tbe
general principles that should, in my
opinion, underlie our national efforts in
this diiection. The main conditions of
the problem may be thus stated. We
are a people apt in mechanical pursuits,
and fertile in invention. We cover a
vast extent of territory, rich in agricul?
tural products and in nearly all the raw
materials necessary for successful manu?
factures. We have a system of produc?
tive establishments more than sufficient
to supply our own demands. The wages
of labor are so great, and the scale of
living of our artisan classes is such as
tends to secure their personal comfort
and the development of those higher
moral and intellectual qualities that go
to the making of good citizens. Our
system of tax and tariff legislation is
yielding a revenue which is in excess of
the preseut needs of the Government.
These are the elements from which it is
sought to devise a scheme by which,
without unfavorably changing the con?
dition of the working-man, our merchant
mariue shall be raised from its enfeebled
condition, and new markets provided for
the sale beyond our borders of tbe mani?
fold fruits of industrial enterprises. The
problem is complex, and can be solved
by no single measure of innovation or
reform. The countries of the American
Continent and the adjacent islands are
for the United States the natural marts
of supply and demand. It is from them
that we should obtain of whut we do not
produce, or do not produce in sufficiency,
and it is to them that the surplus pro?
ductions of our fields, our mills and our
workshops should flow under conditions
that will equalize or favor them iu com?
parison with foreign competition. Four
paths of policy seem to point to this end.
First a series of reciprocal commercial
treaties with the countries of America
which shall foster between us and show
an unhampered movement of trade.
The conditions of these treaties should
be tbe free admission of such merchan?
dise as this country does not produce, in
return for the admission, free or under a
favored scheme of duties, of our own
products; the benefits of such exchange
to apply only to goods carried under the
flag of the parties to the contract; the
removal on both sides from the vessels so
privileged of all tonnage, dues and
national imposts, so that those vessels
may ply unhindered between our ports
and those of the other contracting parties,
though without infringing on the re?
served home-coasting trade; the removal
or reduction of burdens on the exported
products of those countries coming into
the beuefits of the treaties and the avoid?
ance of the technical restrictions and
penalties by which our intercourse with
those countries is at present hampered.
Secondly, the establishment of tbe con?
sular service of the United States on a
salaried footing, thus permitting the
relinquishment of consular feee, not only
as respects vessels under the national
flag, but also as respects vessels of the
treaty nations, carrying goods entitled to
the benefits of the treaties. Thirdly the
enactment of measures to favor the con?
struction and maintenance of a steam
carrying marine under the ilag of the
United States. Fourthly, the establish?
ment of an uniform currency basis for
the countries of America, so that tbe
' coined products of mines may circulate
on equal terms throughout the whole
system of Commonwealths. This would
require a monetary union of America,
whereby tbe output of the bullion-pro?
ducing countries and the circulation of
those which yield neither gold nor silver
could be adjusted in conformity with the
population, wealth and commercial
needs of each. As many of the coun?
tries furnish no bullion to the common
stock, the surplus production of our
mines and mints might thus be utilized
and a step taken toward the general
remonitization of silver. To the accom?
plishment of the ends so far as they can
be attained by separate treaties, the
negotiations already concluded and now
in progress have been directed, and the
favor which this enlarged policy has thus
far received warrants the belief tbat its
operations -/ill ere long embrace all, or
nearly all, the countries of tbis hemis?
phere. It is by no means desirable,
however, that the policy under consider
1 ation should be applied to these countries
alone. The healthful enlargement of
our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa
should be sought by reducing tariff bur?
dens on such of their wares as neither
we nor the other American States are
fitted to produce, and thus enabling our?
selves to obtain in return a better market
for our supplies of food, of raw material
and of the manufactures in which we
excel. It seems to me that many of tbe
embarrassing elements in tbe great
national conflict between Protection and
Free-trade may thus bo turned to good
account; tbat the revenue may be
reduced so as no longer to overtax the
people, that protective duties may be
retained without becoming burdensome,
that our shipping interests may be judi?
ciously encouraged, tbe currency fixed
on firm basis and above all such an
unity of interests established among the
States of the American system as will
be of great and ever increasing advantage
to them all.
POLYGAMY.
The report of tbe Utah commission
will be read with interest. It discloses
the results of recent legislation looking
to the prevention and punishment of
polygamy in that territory. I still
believe tbat, if tbat abominable practice
can be suppressed by law, it can only be
by the most radical legislation consistent
with the restraints of the Constitution.
I again recommend, therefore, that Con?
gress assume absolute political control of
the Territory of Utah, and provide for
tbe appointment of commissioners with
such governmental powers as in its
judgment may justly and wisely be put
into their bands.
THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
The good results anticipated have been
more than realized. The system has
fully answered tbe expectations of its
friends in securing competent and faith?
ful public servants, and in protecting the
appointing officers of tbe Government
from tbe pressure of personal importuni?
ty, and from the labor of examining the
claims and pretensions of rival candi?
dates for public employment. The law
has had the unqualified support of the
President and of the heads of the several
departments, and the members of the
commission have performed their duties
with zeal and fidelity.
NATIONAL BANKRUPT LAW.
In view of the general and persistent
demand throughout the commercial com?
munity for a national bankrupt law I
hope that the differences of sentiment
which have hitherto prevented its enact?
ment may not outlast the present session.
THE CHOLERA.
The pes:iience which for the past two
years has been raging in the countries of
tbe Ep.st, recently made its appearance
in European ports with which we are in
constant communication. The then
secretary of tbe treasury, in pursuance of
a proclamation of the President,
issued certain regulations restrict?
ing for a time the importation of rags
and tbe admission of baggage of immi?
grants and of travellers arriving from
infected quarters. Lest this course may
have been without strict warrant of law,
I approve the recommendation of tbe
present secretary, that Congress take
action in the premises, and I also recom?
mend the immediate adoption of such
measures as will be likely to ward off tbe
dreaded epidemic, and to mitigate its
severity in cose it shall unhappily extend

U. S. GRANT.
I recommend that, in recognition of
the iminent services of Ulysses S. Grant,
late General of the United States and
twice President of this nation, tbe Con?
gress confer upon bim a suitable pension.
CONCLUSION.
As the time draws nigh when I am to
retire from tbe public service, I cannot
refrain from expressing to the members
of the National Legislature with whom I
have been brought into personal and
official intercourse, my sincere apprecia?
tion of their unfailing courtesy and of
the harmonious co-operation with the
Executive in so many measures calculat?
ed to promote the best interests of the
nation. To my fellow-citizens generally
I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation
for the support which they have accord?
ed me in my administration of the Exec?
utive department of this Government.
Docs Shelter Pay I
With the beginning of cold weather,
the necessity of giving the stock ample
protection becomes apparent. Wise far?
mers not only agree to this, but experi?
ments have shown the wisdom of giving
the stock warm shelter during Winter.
Toobtain the comparative effect produced
by both shelter and exposure, tbe Ohio
Experiment Station separated 10 hogs
into two lots each, giving one lot the best
of shelter while the other lot was given
but ordinary shelter. This experiment
was continued from Dec. 7, 1882, to
March 29,1883. The pigs were fed dike
?corn in the ear twice daily, and plenty
of pure water at all times. There was
but a difference of two pounds in the
amount of corn consumed by the two
lots. 3,240 pounds of corn were fed to
the pigs in the closed pens, which made
an increase of 350 pounds in weight.
3,242 pounds of corn were fed to the piga
in the open pen, which made an increase
of 220 pounds. The sheltered animals
required 9.' pounds of corn to make one
pound of increase, while those in the
open pen required 13 pounds. From fig?
ures given by the Station, the pigs in the
open pen during the coldest periods re?
quired 17.6 pounds of corn to make one
pound of increase, while those in the
closed pen required only 7.5 pounds of
corn to make a pound of meat. These
figures are facts, and speak for themselves.
We cannot afford to allow stock to stand
shivering in cold barns all Winter.
Plaster up the ruptures in the walls,
replace broken panes of glass with whole
ones, cover the cracks in the sides of tbe
barn, shingle tbe roofs, nod prepare for
Winter. It will pay every time.

THRILLING INCIDENT OF THE WAR.
How Hagood Rescued the Flag and Saved
his Brigade from Capture.
From General Beauregurd's History.
It was during the attempt to regain the
use of the Weldon road by the Federals
on the 21st of August, 1864, that General
Hagood, of South Carolina, distinguished
himself in a personal encounter with a
Federal officer.
Owing to inaccurate reports of his scouts
General A. P. Hill, who commanded the
Confederate forces against Warren's ex?
pedition, mistook the exact position of
the enemy's line on the left, aud, through
General Mahone, who labored under the
same error, Hagood's brigade was ordered
to press the rear and flank of the Feder?
als. He was to be supported by five bri?
gades of Mahonc's division, supposed to
be already in front. The brigade drove
the skirmishers from their rifle pits, but
found itself in presence of a strongly in?
trenched line, crowded with men and ar?
tillery, extending right and left as far as
could be seen. The five brigades of
Mahone were not there. General Ha?
good saw at once what a perilous
strait be was in, and stopping himself,
shouted again and again the command to
halt; but tbe crasb and rattle of twelve
or fifteen pieces of artillery and probably
twenty-five hundred rifles, which had
now opened upon them at close range,
drowned bis voice, and the fury of the
battle was upon his men. Moving for?
ward with the steady tramp of the double
quick, and dressing upon their colors,
these devoted men, intent only on carry?
ing tbe position before them, neither
broke their aligumentunf.il it was broken
by the irregular impact upon the enemy's
works, nor stopped to Uro their guns till
their rush to obtain tbe parapet was re?
pelled.
When General Hagood saw bis men
thus rushing upon certain destruction,
and bis efforts to stop them unavailing,
be felt that if they were to perish he
should share their fate; and with Molony
and Martin and Orderly Stoney, he fol?
lowed tbe advancing line, In fifty yards
Lieutenant Martin fell, shot in tbe knee;
a few steps farther on and Captain
Molony fell, shot through the head, and
Hagood and Stoney alone reached the
works?the latter shot in the shoulder
but not disabled. Tbe 25th and 81st
regiments being on th? left, from the
oblique direction of tbe advance, first
struck tbe works; and while tbey stag?
gered to get in the other three regiments
swept ou. When they reached the ditch
there was from seventy-five to one hun?
dred yards interval between tbe two
divisions into which the brigade bad bro?
ken. General Hagood was with Maior
Wilds?, commanding jth?i 21st, who was
cheering on bis men to renewed assault
{success now being their only hope of
safety), when, looking to the right, he
saw a mounted Federal officer amoug the
men on the left of the portion of the
brigade to the right wkh a rpgimental
color in his bands, and .a confusion and
parleying immediately around him that
betokened approaching surrender. The
fight was still raging at Hagood's right'
and left; there was no cessation ou the
part of his men except in the squad just
around this officer, and none whatever
that was perceptible on the part of tbe
enemy. They had pushed out from the
right and left a line behind tbe Carolini?
ans to cut off their retreat, and this officer
(Captain Daly, of General Cutter's staff)
bad galloped out of a sally-port, seized a
color from tbe hands of its bearer, aud
demanded a surrender. Some officers
and men surrendered, but were not car?
ried in ; others refused, but jus.t around
him ceased fighting. General Hagood
called to the men to shoot him and fall
back in retreat. They either did not
hear him, or, bewildered by the surren?
der of part of their number, failed to
obey. It was a critical moment, and
demanded instant and decided action. In
a few minutes tbe disposition to surren*
der would have spread and the whole
brigade have been lost. Making bis
way across the intervening space, ex?
posed to a regular fire by file from the
enemy's line scarce thirty yards off, and
calling to bis men to fall back, which
they did not do, General Hagood
approached the officer and demanded the
colors, and that be should go back within
bis own lines, telling him he was free to
do so. He commenced arguing tbe hope?
lessness of further struggle, and pointed
out tbe line in Hagood's rear. Hagood
cut him short and demanded a categoric?
al reply?yes or no. Daly was a man of
fine presence, with long, flowing beard,
and sat with loosened rein upon a noble
looking bay that stood with bead and
tail erect, and flashing eye and distended
nostrils, quivering in every limb with
excitement, but not moving in bis tracks.
In reply to this abrupt demand tbe rider
raised his bead proudly, and decisively
answered, No! Upon the word General
Hagood shot him through the body, and
as he reeled from the saddle upon one
side sprang into it from tbe other, Orderly
Stoney seizing tbe flag from his falling
hands. There was no thought of surren?
der now; the yell from the brigade fol?
lowing tbe act and ringing out above the
noise of battle told their commander that
they were once more in hand, and would
go now wherever ordered. Shouting to
them to face about, Hagood led them at
a run against the line iu bis rear, Stoney
i holding aloft in front the recaptured flag.
Tbe line melted before tbe charge; but
the fire was terrific, after breaking
through it, till tbe shelter of tbe valley of
the branch was reached. Upon its mar
giu a fragment from a scbrapuel shell
tore open the loins of the horse Hagood
rode.
He Did it Once.
"I never knew Sara Baldwiu to tell the
truth but once," remarked Colonel Foley
to Jim Mitchell, of the Boston Globe, the
latter being in Foley's store, one day.
"If Sam Baldwin told the truth, it
must have been by accident," responded
Mitchell.
"You have hit it precisely ; it was by
an accident that he told the truth. Sam
had an old shot-gun that had been in tbe
family forty years, and one day he put
two loads in one barrel, and when he
fired tbe gun buist into a thousand pieces.
When Sam was restored to consciousness,
his head was bandaged up, and the doc?
tors were exploring him for relics of the
battle. Tbe biggest piece of that gun
that could be found was about two inches
long, and was dug out from under his
collar-bone. Then it was that Sam told
the truth."
"What did he say?"
"He said if he lived to be 1,000 years
old, be would never fire off that gun
I again, and he never did, for nobody
j could find that gun again wheu there
was nothing of it left to ?re off, except
tbe piece Sam had hid away under bis
collar-bone."
"Just as I said. He never told the
truth, unless it happened by accident."

BILL ARP.
"Gnuweth a File."
Atlanta Constitutum.
And he gnaweth a file. Well, it is
hard vittels, I know, but sometimes it
helps a man to explode, and thrash
around under great disappointments. It
sets the pent up bile to working, and
when he gets rid of it he feels better. Mr.
Blaine feels better now, I reckon. May
be that Augusta speech saved his life, for
I have heard folks say that he was a 7ery
sensitive man and if he got beaten be
would kill himnelf. But the danger is
all over now and the crisis is past. Let
us pass resolut ons of sympathy, for a
great man has .alien this day in Israel.
Well, he fell several years ago, but he
dident fall so far nor so suddenly, and
the whole nation did not see him. It
was an awful shock tbi3 time and he had
to say something. He had to abuse some?
body. He had Beecher and Burchard
and Nast and tho Harpers and the Times,
but he was afraid of them, and so he
takes the solid Smth for his victim?the
I old martyrs that has stood the brunt of a
thousand slanders and still lives. Thank
the good Lord, she still lives! They
have thrown boomerangs at her for twenty
years, but the boomerang is a dangerous
weapon in careless hands. They tell me
a man can thron it clean round a house
and it will come back and hit him if he
don't dodge. Better quit throwing boom?
erangs. They threw one at us when they
gave the negro tbe vote and it has just
got back and bit them a terrible blow. It
bit Mr. Blaine ic tbe pit of the stomach
and hurt, and he gnaweth a file. And it
hit Murat Halstead, and he gnaweth a
file. And that Milwaukee feller gnaweth
a file. I'm afraid that files will be scarce
up there, and as they seem to like such
vittels, I think ]'. will send them a few
old ones from my blacksmith shop?I
reckon they are good eating to folks who
like them.
But I am sorry for Mr. Blaine?I really
am?and I hope our folks will give him
the charity of their silence. Say no more
about Mulligan, or Hocking Valley, or
Joy, or Fisher. Don't Irick a man when
he is down. Don't punch a poor coon
just to see bim bite tbe stiele. They
punched us after they whipped us and I
never could understand it unless it was
like the fellow who killed a dug for biting
him, and after the dog was dead he
kicked bim and mangled bim and cursed
him until a man who was standing by
said, "Don't you see that brute is dead?
what are you"kicking him now for?"
"Dog on him," said he, "I want to teach
bim there is a little hell and punishment
after death."
But now let us all have peace. Let us
return good for evi l. We have got friends
up there, and for their sakes let us for?
give and forget. I wish we bad invited
Mr. Blaiue down to our jubilee and got
him to make another speech. May be
our Sunny South and our hospitality
would have affected him and set his liver
straight. We cou d have given him some
S. S. S. besides and sent him home a bet?
ter and happier man.
I wonder what office he would like
under Mr. Cleveland?some little thing
to taper off on?a consulate to South
America, Brazil or Terra Del Fuego, or
maybe the Cape if Good Hope. Good
hopes are good things for a disappointed
man. There wot Id be a wide field for
bis philantrophy down there, for tbe peo?
ple are black?solid black. I think it
would harmonize IHalstead and company
to give tbem an oEce, and we will have
lots of offices. I was afraid we wouldn't
have enough people to fill them, but I
reckon we will. Our boys seem to be
right patriotic. There are fifteen volun?
teers already for the Cartersville postof
fice, and I feel encouraged. They
are all good men and willing. I hear
that one man came a hundred miles to
take it as soon as it was vacant. Such
patriotism ought to be rewarded. I was
thinking about a snug little sin cure my?
self, and went down to Atlanta to see
about it and offer my services, but a man
tackled me as soon as I lit off the cars and
took me away off round a corner and said
be was after an office, and wanted me to
help him get it, and told me bow tbat he
had worked for the party for twenty odd
years and never hsd bad nothing, and he
was poor and needy ; and when I asked
him what office it was, he named tbe very
one I was alter. Well, I am easily over?
come by a friend in distress, and so I
promised to do a l I could, and in ten
minutes after I left him I met another
friend who wantec. it, and so I promised
bim, and before I left town I
had promised six, and I felt relieved to
think that I was regarded of so much in?
fluence and could do so much good in
helping tbe needy. It is a good sign to
see tbat so many are volunteering, for it
I will give Mr. Cleveland plenty of choice,
j It is going to be right bard on our mem?
bers of Congress. They have got to play
a new role now. When tbe fifteen appli?
cations for tbe Cartersville postoffice are
sent up to tbe Postmaster-General be will
do like tbat officer always does. He will
refer the whole lot to Mr. Clements, and
Mr. Clements will look over the names to
the petitions, and after considering who
is tbe best man fo ? tbe office and for the
people, and for Mr. Clements too, he will
recommend one, and thereby make one
friend and fourteen enemies. So there is
going to be tbe dickens to play in the
districts all over I he Stale, and lots of
disappointed patriots are going to get
fighting mad. Bu:I hope they will have
sense enough to spell the word "ac?
quiesce," and not go to gnawing a file.
I'm sorry for our members of Congress.
A man told me in Atlanta that Governor
Brown's mail was cow about a bushel a
day, and it took two clerks to read them
and file them and nake out a tally sheet,
so that the Governor could get an idea
without reading i.hem. Governor Col
quitt got 47 letters in one mail, and 45
of them were applications for office. It
is very encouraging to think that we
have got so many who are fitten, for I
know they are all fitten; their friends
say they are.
Sometimes I think 1 would like to get
a good fat office 1 ke Mr. Cleveland has
always got his. That is, have it shoved
on me. I was ruminating over bis wou
derful career. There is nothing like it
since old Father Cincinnatus was called
from tbe plow to govern the Roman em?
pire. But they don't call tbem from the
plow now. I havo been looking up the
road for seven years for a committee to
come after me and :ake me from the plow,
but they don't cone, and so I have quit
plowing. The shoving process seems to
be unpopular, as a general thing, and
now the feller who works the hardest and
has the longest pole generally knocks
down tbe persimmon.
So, wade in, boys, and fortify your?
selves. Combine, confederate, make
I promises. It is no sin to bold office. It is
i honorable, but if you can do anything
else and make a living you had better do
I it, for fear you will be disappointed and
' have to gnaw a file,
