Those present were agreed in oppo

claimed that its effect was to encour
age fraud upon the companies by over
insuring ami even by committing arson.
All were united, too, in opposing the
present tax on gross earnings as 1111

subjected the insurance companies to
double taxation and because it caused
.the home companies to pay 'similar

OFFICIALS ACCUSED
OF WRONGING GIRLS
London, Dec. 10.—W. Scoresby Rout
ledge, who has lived for six years in
British East Africa, writes to the
Times apealing to public opinion to
stop outrageous practices, which, he
xays, the imperial authorities refuse
to check. He declares that British In
terests in ISast Africa, are "suffering
from the demoralization of native
women by British officials, who misuse
their authority for this purpose."
He says he has hitherto refrained
from a public protest, relying on the
government to deal severely with the
abuses which he personally brought to
the notice of the officials in London.
He has been grievously disappointed
In this hope and recites with names,
is a typical case, one instance in which
the culprit was only deprived of a
year's seniority ami severely admon
ished.
This man. an acting district commis
sioner. the writer savs. procured a na

her will, and also took anQther child

own native policemen.
Mr. Routledge asserts that lie proved
these charges to the government with
the totally inadequate punishment
named as a result.
Mr. Routledge tells of similar cases

is intensely disgusted with the in
sensibility of the British authorities
to these outrages, and he demands that
the public take the matter up.

SEES WEALTH IN FARMING
Washington. D. Dec. 9.—Owners
of hill farms up in New England, wherq
the crops grow between the boulders,'
will be surprised at some of the con
clusions arrived at by the conservative
commission, appointed by President
Roosevelt. When this commission
makes its first report to the president it,
will show the average return upon the
investment in farming lands to be 23
per cent.
While it may be difficult for the aver
age farmer to understand Just how the
commission arrived at these figures, It
has plenty of data to back them up.
The average slae of farms In the
.United States Is 146 acres, and their
.fertility is increasing. There Is also an
.increase In the yield of all crops grown.
Altogether there Is evidence that tht
icooMrvatlon commission will present to
ithe president a v«ry "bullish" report.

COURT RULES WIFE
KEEPS WEDDING GIFTS
London. Dec. 7.—Judgment was given
by the official referee in the action for
the possession of the wedding presents,
brought by Herbert Leavltt Hunt. a:
young American living iu London,
against his English wife.
The. plalntifT alleges that certain
presents were given him personally and
that other things were bought with his
own money. The defense was that
the presents were given to the husband
and wife jointly and that the other
household effects belong of right to
Mrs. Hunt.
In giving his Judgment, the referee
said that the articles in dispute werej
mainly part of the equipment of the)
matrimonial domicile for which Mrs.i
Hunt had assumed responsibility and
they were of such a nature that if re
moved they would have to be replaced
to render the house habitable In the
style in which the wife had been ac
customed.
With the exception of three articles
given the husband personally by Amer
ican friends, the referee held Mr. Hunt
had failed to show any right to remove
the disputed articles from the possession
of his wife. The referee also ruled that
an album containing photographs of
Mrs. Hunt and pictures taken during
the honeymoon were the. property of
the wife absolutely.
The wife having on the whole suc
ceeded, was given costs of the proceed
ings.

Opening Will Be Postponed to
March 25 to Save Settlers
from Exposure.
Dallas. S. D.. Dec. ".--.ludge Witten.
who returned this week from Wash
ington. expects today to conclude the
selection of the government townsltes.
in Tripp county, lie will not make]
the locations known until Ills reportj
has been presented to the secretary of:
the interior and approved by hltn.
Judge AVitten says that the date of
openin of Tripp county will be about
-March 2fi, 1909. and not the first of
March as originally reported. The rea
son for the delay is that, the roughest
weather of the season often comes,
about the first of the. month, and the
later date, while early enough to per
mit of spring farming operations, Is a.
safer time for the settlers to get out
on their land.
A petition has recently been circu
lated for the organization of Tripp
county, but .Judge Witten is of the
opinion that nothing can be done along
that line until after the date of the.
formal opening of the county to set
tlement. "It yet remains an Indian
domain.'' says lie. "and those who are
frequenting Tripp county without a
permit are liable to arrest for tres
pass. Literally speaking, no white man
without a permit has any right on the
reservation, and those who are living
there could be ordered off by the gov
ernment authorities."
Might Change the Plan.
Speaking of the plan pursued ati
Dallas and other points in the regis-i
tration and drawing of lands, Judgei
Witten said: I
"There is only one thing that might!
make it more equitable and avoidl
speculation to an absolute certainty^
the right for the people all over the]
united States to make their applica-'
tlons at their homes before an au-!
thcrized oath officer and forward their
applications to a central office and flle'
the same as was the case in those
filed here and sent from Preshoj
Chamberlain. O'Neill and Valentine!^
When these applications are made anffl
filed it should be compulsory that each'
application accompanied with a draft!
for $100 as evidence that he registers'
in good faith and that if he draws a!
number that he will file. If he fails to'
make his tiling he forfeits his money.'
During this drawing the people who'
participated in it expended more thanj
$2,300,000, most ,i' the -amount being
spent with the railroads of the Jouii^®
try. 1 'nder this system this would be'
eliminated and only those who really
wanted to enter government lands!
would take part. Those who fail in the
drawing would have their money re
turned to tv.em."

GETTYSBURG HOTEL BURNS
GUESTS HAVE NARROW E8CAPE
Huron. 8. D., Dec. 6.—At 6 o'clock
Tuesday morning the Dakota house, at
Gettysburg, was destroyed bv flre
The proprietor, Mr. Bates, had 'recent-!
ly completed a large brick addition to!
the frame structure, making the hotel
one of the largest and best equipped,
hotels in that section of the state. It
contained 60 or more rooms, all well
furnished and heated by furnace. It
is supposed that the fire originated
from the furnace. So rapid did the
flames spread that many of the guests
who were sleeping at the time, saved
only their wearing apparel. Among,
those who had close calls were Engi
neer Walter Handy, of this city, who
had Just been transferred to take the

MILLIONS IN BIG
GAMBLE IN WHEAT
Chicago, Dec. 4.—More than 20,
.000,000 bushels of wheat—said to be the
largest amount ever held by any one
man or combination of men in Chicago
.—now is in the hands of William H.
(Bartlett,
James A. Patten, Geo. W.
Patten and Frank B. Frazler and the.
'market is in a state of high excite
ment anticipating t.he result.
This deal is without precedent. It ia
bigger than the Joe Leiter deal, when
•the young plunger lost $9,000,000. It Is
bigger than the John W. Gates corner,
'in which millions were lost four yearn
jago. It Is bigger by at least 5.000,000
•bushels than anything "Old Hutch"
ever attempted In the long ago.
And yet it is not a corner. It is
•merely a colossal deal. The Bartlett
.Patten bull ring asserts It is not en
deavoring to buy all the grain In the
imarket and create an artificial condi
tion. Its purpose is merely to take
advantage of what It believes to be a

said, Hornberger struck her, felling her
to the floor. As she arose she saw her
sister. Miss Stout, standing with &
smoking pistol in lier hand, and her
.assailant dead from a bullet through
the heart. Miss Stout admitted firing
the shot, averring that she did so to
save her sister's life. Both women
awaited the. arrival of the police, and
readily accompanied them to the sta
tion.
At the station Miss Stout became
hysterical when informed that Horn
berger was dead. She declared her sis

threatened to kill both herself and sis
ter. She said she had hurried Into a.
room, siezed the revolver and fired!
blindly to frighten the assailant.
The police are inclined to credit the
statement of the women and believe
they may be freed by the action of tho
coroner's Jury.
