Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Doc. . At a con
feranoe to-day between Proficient
Wilton and Senator Oalllngcr, lender
t tte Republican minority, an agree
kaant was reached whereby tho fle
psjbllcan will support tbs Adminis
tration In a programmo of national
preparedness.
Xa both Houses of Congress Repub
lican votes will be used to carry
'oreufth tho President's proposition
that was threatened by tho disaffec
tion of Bryan and the pence delegntcs.
Without this help the measure
eonld not have been put through Con-
by Democratlo vots alone.
U an Intimation that the He-
yvMloana holding tho balanoe of
yowor may force the President's hand
to m detree of naval nnd military ex
pansion considerably beyond his pros
sat moderate Intentions.
No men'ion has beon made yet of the
prloo to be exacted by the Republicans
for this support, but so generous and
oetnpleto was the offor made to-day
that some return In kind Is certain to
be demanded beforo Congress adjourns.
Senator Oalllngcr, after leaving the
President, sold:
"I am In accord with the thourht of
he President and tho Secretary of
War regarding national preparedness.
We spoko only of the general principle.
Tho details were not considered. They
re to be worked out later.
"The Republicans are fully ngrced
that vro will not treut this gront ques
tion from n nnrrow point of view.
Wo shall Insist only that tho meas
ures to bs taken shall bo compro
henslvs and sufficient rather than
extreme.
"While I have partlson views on
aome things, I havo none on this. I
had an agreeable talk with tho Presi
dent and assured him that the Re
publicans were ready to join In sup
port of a policy of preparedness."
Asked about financial questions and
bow the revenues for this increased
expenditure should be raised, Senator
Qalllpger said:
"Personally I am In favor of a bond
Issue rather than Increased taxation.
I think the ptople feel that they are
taxed about' enough now. Of the
propositions mentioned by tho Presi
dent in his message, tho one for a
stamp on bank checks will bo most
popular and readily accepted. Tnx
on gasoline and automobiles will not
be bo well received and as for tax on
Iron and steel I think tho pcoplo will
be against that.
"Regarding tho lncomto tax, I think
the present oxemptlon could bo low
ered so as to tncludo a largor num
ber of persons and tho surtax on
large Incomes increased.
"I always favored lowering1 the ex
emption and I have a theory that It
.would be better If practically every
asm had to pay some Income tax.
Tfe very rioh ought to havo their
aortas lnoreased."
Senator Gallinger said that ho dls
cussed with tho President tho sug
nation that tho Domocrats make pro
WLTodness bills party measures. Tho
President replied that he did not fa
vor making them subject to party
caucus or partisan ruio.
"I hold myself In position, l(nw.
rer." eald Bonator Oalllngor slgnlA
cantly, "whore I may advocate a
larger regular army than thut pro
posed by tho Administration and a
Kreater naval programme particularly
for more submarines and battlo

"I do not bcllcvo tho hen's placo Is In tho home," rcmarkd Lady
Eglantine, tho 100,000 White Leghorn pullet who was yesterday's most dis
tinguished arrival In Now York. "Defore I loft Grecnboro, Md., whero I
could buy nnd sell nny roostc you over saw."
Lady Kglantlne paused to peck a grain of corn overlooked at
her last meal. And meantlmo I observed her anxiously. She was fluffy
and whlto and plump, and undoubtedly she LOOKED like a hen; but
whenco came this unRccmly tendency to crow? Can It be that the hen of
genius 1r a rooster, after nil?
WANTS SINGLE STANDARD OF
MORALS IN BARNYARD.
Perhaps Lady Eglantine saw that
she had made an unfavorable first
impression. At any rate, who sought
to Justify herself in the next sentence
'I'm going to die an old maid, Jhe
said. "I don't believe that hnlf a hus
band is better than none, nnd I havo
no desire to bo n Mormon's brldo. I
believe in one high standard of
morals for tho barnyard. So long as
we lmvo one standard for tho hen una
another for the rooster, so long ns the
hen that dovlntcs from tho straight
and narrow path becomes a social out
cast whllo her partner In crime goes

dependence. And who Knows, hko
mnny another star, I migni araw a.
husband who would refuso to do nny
thlng but spend ray $100,000 income.
No, not for me!"
It seemed to me that I hnd lienrA
something like this before, or read It.
or porhaps even written It. As tho
aristocratic pullet was beginning to
rufflo her feathers nnd to exniuit
other symptoms of unrest I hastened
to turn tho subject to moro agreo.ible
channels.
"I understand that you laid 314 eggs
In n days a world record," I said
soothingly. "Didn't you llnd it rather
monotonous?"
"No, Indeed," Lndy Eglnntlno said
promptly. "I havo never allowed my
domestic duties to interfcro with my
life work, which Is of course the
winning of blue ribbons for my owner,

Maybe you don't know that the hen Is the most emanci

I have laid 314 eggs In 3C5 days, nnd my eggs are worth

"I hopo not," replied Lady Eglantine
promptly. "Tho sooner tho hens got
