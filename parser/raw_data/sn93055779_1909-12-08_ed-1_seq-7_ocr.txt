I Stocks, Bonds, Cereals j
IS SMALL
In Yesterday's Stock Market Con
stant Fluctuations Showed
Operators Uncertain.
New York, Dec. 1, The stock ex
change business today dwindled to
snjall proportions. The constant fluc
tuations in prices indicated that oper
ators are of an uncertain frame of
mind. Variableness mirrored the
vagaries of the speculative temper
rather than any developments of af
fairs. The president's message was
called conservative, but Taft's post
ponement for treatment in special
messages subjects of changes in the
anti-trust and inter-state commerce
laws left little for immediate ap
praisement in the stock market. The
rise in American Suar was ascribed
to the stand against a congressional
investigation, and at least immunity
is thus to be given some of those
prosecuted.
Pacific Mail rose on the ship-sub
sidy paragraph. The fact that prices
fell sharply last week in apprehension
of the president's unfriendly treat
ment of corporations and rebounded
I violently Saturday, after the tenor of
the message became known, measures
the financial opinion of the case more
reliably than did today's market.
j The denials of reports that a gen
eral strike of the railroad employes
is contemplated ' helped railroad
stocks some. The upturn In United
States steel influenced the whole list.
jThe government's estimate estimate
of a very large area planted in win -
iter wheat and the high per cent of
the condition of that crop proved a
. late stimulating influence. The last
I iwui oi me eessiuii was ine uusiesi,
the" day's gains mostly being made in
.that time.

"ILL, WEAK AND EMACIATED"
Is how Mrs. J. W. Flagg describes the
condition of her little daughter after
a severe attack of pneumonia, and
nothing seemed to do h.er a bit of
good. "At this time," continued Mrs.
Flagg, "we commenced to ' give her
Vinol, and the effect was marvelous.
The doctor was amazed at her pro
gress and said Vinol is a fine remedy,
keep, it up. We did so and she was
soon restored to health and strength.'.'

SLUMP III
Induced by Crop Report Yesterday
Which Indicated Second Largest
Record Yield.
Chicago, Dec. 7. WHEAT The
government report, which indicated
the second largest crop of winter
wheat on record for the United States
in point of acreage, caused a severe
slump Iti the prices here today, fol
lowing the sharp bulge due to the
confirmation of injury by frost to
the Argentine crop. At the close
prices were weak, y84c lower. De
cided strength marked the trading
during the 'first half of the 'session,
commission houses and shorts being
active bidders. Prices advanced about
one cent above the previous close.
The demand was chiefly for distant
futures. When the report was issued
there was n complete reversal of sen
timent, many early buyers selling
freely. According to official statistics
the acreage seeded to winter wheat
Is 33,483,000 acres, an increase of 7.9
per cent compared to the final esti
mate on last year's crop and the sec
ond largest on record. Much long
wheat came out in the final hour and
prices declined more than 1 cent. The
close was near the bottom figures of
the day.

CORN There was a big trade and
the market was strong the greater
(part of the day although it lost some
of its bullishness late In the session
owing to the break in wheat. The I
principal reason for the strength was
me severe sionii uver me corn ueii
which will greatly increase the
;amount of corn used for feeding pur-
poses. Cash grain advanced llc.

Samose Will Make People Fat
"Money Back if it Fails" Say
Paul G. Schuh & Sons.
The line of beauty is a curve. Wom
en may be thin and graceful, but not
thin and beautiful. Thete is a vast
number of pale, thili. 8criny people
who are all bralfasi am! nerves, but
without the strength! ttPd- health that
accompanies the $ $iidftrd weight.
Good flesh and perfect ;ienlth go to
gether. A true flesh forming food
like Samose is absolutely necessary
to many people. j.
No one can use this wonderful flesh
forming food for 10-days without a
noticeable gain in flesh and strength.
Carefully kept statistics show that
out of every hundred people who be
gin the use of Samose, 9 per cent in
crease in weignc and tneir neann
and strength are restored.
Paul O. Schuh & Sons have so
much confidence in this remarkable
flesh forming food and health re
storer that they are willing and glad
to allow any customer to deposit 50c
with them and take home a box of
Samose with tins, understanding that
if it does not give a marked increase
n good, firm flesh the money will be
returned without any questions.
