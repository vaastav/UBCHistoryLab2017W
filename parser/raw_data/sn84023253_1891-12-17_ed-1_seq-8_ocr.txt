Entered at the St. Johnsbury Post Office as
econd-elass matter.
The Burlington Clipper charac
terizes the talk about a second term
for Gov. Page as "all nonsense," and
says "the east side of the state ought
to be able to furnish a satisfactory
candidate, and will undoubtedly do
so." Correct, Mr. Clipper. The east
side will endeavor to fill the bill.
Gov. Page has been a good executive,
and probably has no desire for the
responsibilities of another term.
Sawtelle, the New Hampshire mur
derer who recently m idc confession
with a view to being transferred to
the jurisdiction of Maine and there
by saving his neck,, must hang, under
the New Hampshire law. The court
denies him a new trial. Thus both
Almy and Sawtelle, whose crimes
were committed under most brutal
circumstances, are to be disposed of
as the law directs and as their deeds
merit.
La grippe seems not to have spent
its force last year, and is re-appearing
this season with serious effect.
From various sections of Europe and
the continent come reports of the ex
istence of many cases and a long list
of deaths resulting therefrom. The
disease has also shown itself in this
country to an alarming extent. In
view of the presence of this strange
malady, the exercise of the utmost
caution becomes imperative, and in
dividuals should avoid so far as pos
sible all conditions and surroundings
that will imperil health and put
them within easy reach of la grippe,
a peculiarly weakening disease.
Concerning the wrecking of the
Georgia-Alabama company, much
of whose stock was once held in St.
Johnsbury, the United States Inves
tor well says :
"If no action is taken for a thorough
investigation of the management of
this company, and for the punish
ment of the offenders, it will be be
cause the public not only likes to be
humbugged but also enjoys being
swindled. During the next ten years
greater progress will be made in the
industrial and agricultural develop
ment of the South than of any other
section of the United States; but
meantime such offenses as that of
jthe Georgia-Alabama Development
Company ought to be thoroughly
exposed and the offenders punished."
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message of President Harrison
to the Fifty-second congress is, like
the man who prepared it, dignified
and business-like, and devoted to the
best interests of this country. It is
withal very lengthy, as all presi
dents' messages have grown to be.
It has been favorably commented on
in all quarters, and even the English
press find something in it to speak
well of. The London Daily News,
for instance, says that the message
"leaves nothing to be desired, either
in tone or temper." The work of
the state department for the past
year is reviewed, and the statement
is made that in the Bering Sea dis
pute a satisfactory basis for arbitra
tion has been arrived at; that reci
procity treaties have been consum
mated with several countries; that
the czar has been kindly labored
with on the question of the persecu
tion of Jews.
The president thinks that the re
sultsof the new tariff law have disap
pointed the evil prophesies of its op
ponents, and that a full test thereof
will develop the fact that the MeKin-
ley bill is very favorable in its aver
age effect upon the prices of articles
entering into common use; he says
that the new tariff has created large
industries which will in a few years
give emplo3ment to several hundred
thousand American workmen. Ref
erence is made to the excellent show
ing in the line of imports and ex
ports a showing decidedly credita
ble to the United States, and special
emphasis is put on the increase in
value of the exports of agricultural
products during the past year.
As to money matters, the president
thinks the freecoinage of silver would
disastrously affect our business inter
ests both at home and abroad, and
he does not believe that such a policy
will be permitted. He expresses him
self, as he has done on former occa
sions, emphatically in favor of an
honest dollar. He refers to the bet
terments made in the postal system;
looks upon the administration of the
pension bureau as characterized by
great diligence; recommends prompt
legislation looking to the protection
of the water supph' in the territories;
congratulates the country on the
suppression of polygamy, and thinks
that congress should not surrender
its power over this subject till it
has satisfactory evidence that the
people seeking to be created a state
would exercise proper power over
this evil; believes that the establish
ing of a department of agriculture
has been an excellent thing .for the
country, and that its influence in the
line of disseminating useful informa
tion has been very great; speaks
with satisfaction of the work of the
civil service commission and suggests
an increased appropriation therefor.
Michigan's new departure in the
way of choosing presidential electors
bv congressional and senatorial dis
tricts elicits from the president some
surzestions as to the desirability of
uniformity in the method of choosing
these important representatives of
the people, and he deprecates the
"baneful influence of the gerr'man
der," dwelling at some length upon
the threatening aspect of such a
course as that taken bv Michigan.
Fraudsagainst the suffrage furnish
President Harrison with a text for
some sensible remarks, and he calls
the attention of congress to this evil,
appealing for a consultation on this
subject that shall "proceed with can
dor, calmness and patience upon the
lines of justice and humanity, not of
prejudice and cruelty."
In conclusion the president con
gratulates the nation on the many
evidences of an increased unification
of ourpeopleand of a revived nation
al spirit. Gratification and amaze
ment, he says, struggle for the su
premacy as we contemplate the pop
ulation, wealth'and moral strength
of our country, and we must not be
faithless to the first condition of the
trust imposed upon us the defence
of the free and equal influence of the
people in the choice of public officers
and the control of public affairs.
SOME HOLIDAY BOOKS.
"Grandfather Grey." By Mrs.
Kate Tannatt Woods. Published
hy Lee & Shepard, Boston.
There is a quaint, fascinating
flavor about this book, and one can
easily make real the picture of Grand
father Grey, whose
" easy chair was of softest plush.
His footstool of blue and gold ;
And the fire burned.low in a costly grate.
While he thought of the days of old."
The reverie of the old gentleman is
delightfully set forth, the illustra
tions combining most aptly with the
text to make an entertaining story.
The book is meant to serve as a com
panion to "The Wooing of Grand
mother Grey," issued by the same
publishers last year, and nothing
could be prettier as a gift volume.
The illustrations are suggestively
wrought and carry one back to the
sweet simplicity of bygone days.
The mechanical make-up of the vol
ume is all that could be desired, the
design upon the cover being unique
and attractive and the book well
printed and bound. It will take "on
sight." At A. D. Rowell's.
"Little Folks East and West."
By Harriette R. Shattuck. Pub
lished by Lee & Shepard, Boston.
Thelittle people come in for a good
share of attention in the book line
during the holidays, and this book
will prove very useful for gift pur
poses. It comprises "Prairie Sto
ries," "Mother Goose Stories,"
"Fairy Stories" and "True Stories"
variety enough to satisfy any
youngster. The first chapters are
devoted to "Da, Bunch and Ony,"
three "little folks" in whose prairie
life the children will be interested.
Then follow some of the old Mother
Goose stories enlarged upon, with
interesting details about Miss Muf
fett, the Three Wise Men and other
characters familiar to the child mind.
All the other stories are very read
able. The book is well illustrated
and neatly gotten up, and will be a
favorite with any little lord or lady
of the household who may secure it.
At Rowell's.
"Stand by the Union." By Oliver
Optic. Published by Lee & Shep
ard, Boston.
This is the fourth number in the
Blue and Gray series, and, like its
predecessors, full of interest to the
boy reader. Besides entertaining, it
inculcates a wholesome lesson or two
in patriotism. Our friend Cristy
Passford, on his way to take full
command of the U.S. steamer Bronx,
finds himself involved in a perplexing
bit of adventure at the very outset
of his journey, but comes out of it
all right, and in a rather daring man
ner secures the position which his
cousin Corny seeks to steal from
him. Several thrilling events pre
sent themselves in the course of the
story, but Cristy 's cool bravery
serves him well. The reader, young
and old, will enjoy this volume, to
ward the close of which Cristy is
severely wounded and goes home on
one of the steamers he has captured.
This Blue and Gray series makes a
fine gift for a boy. At A. D. Rowell's
"Forty Years in Africa." By Rev.
Josiah Tyler.
Fully one-half of the edition of this
book which is on sale at A.D. Row
ell's, and a review of which was given
in these columns recently has been
sold, proving its merit. It will be
found very available for gift purposes
at this season.
A cute thing in gift calendars for
1892 is "All Around the Year," de
signed by J. Pauline Sunter, and is
sued by Lee & Shepard of Boston.
It consists of fourteen neatly com
bined pieces of cardboard, the first
and last serving as pretty covers and
each of the other twelve containing
a month's calendar, the figure of a
blithesome lassie and some pat in
scription the whole forming a very
desirable parlor or boudoir com
panion for the coming year. At
Rowell's.
ADDITIONAL LOCAL NEWS.
A COUNTY UNION FORMED.
Representatives of the St. 'Johns
bury Christian Endeavor Societies
and six or seven of the societies in
neighboring towns met at the North
church chapel on Friday afternoon
last and organized a county union.
with the following officers for the
year ensuing: President, Rev. A. I.
Davis of St. Johnsbury; vice presi
dent, Mr. Lester of Lyndon; secre
tary, Miss Helen Graves of St. Johns
bury Centre : treasurer, Miss Frances
Hancock of East Hard wick; look
out committee, Miss Lillian Pearl
and B. F. Harris of St. Johnsbury,
Miss Prescott of St. Johnsbury
Centre, Miss Hovey, Rev. J. T. Buz-
zell of Passumpsic, Miss Mabel Kid
der of East Hardwick and Miss
May Hubbard of Lyndon. In the
afternoon, after a song service, J. W.
Sault gave a paper on the relations
of the young people to the pastor,
Miss Graves of the Centre read a
paper on junior work written by
Miss Mabel Kidder of East Hard
wick, Rev. G. O. Webster told some
thing of the convention at Brattle
boro", and Rev. A. I. Davis conducted
an interesting prayer-meeting. In
the evening F. H. Brooks and Rev.
C. M. Lamson gave Christian En
deavor addresses, and the closing
consecration meeting was led by C.
E. Hayward. The union now being
organized, it is hoped that much can
be accomplished in th's county along
the lines on which the Endeavor so
cieties labor, including the strength
ening of Christian fellowship.
AT HOME AGAIN.
Hon. H. C. Ide arrived in St. Johns
bury on Tuesday afternoon on his
return from Samoa. He is looking
well, is in excellent spirits, and evi
dently not at all sorry to get home
again. Speaking in regard to the
work of the land commission of which
he was a member, Mr. Ide says : "So
far it has been harmonious and the
judgments satisfactory to both na
tives and foreigners. Now the actual
truth is that with some few amend
ments and with discreet men in the
offices, there is no reason why a suc
cess should not be made of the gov
ernment of Samoa, its independence
preserved, and with that the incal
culable value of harbor rights to the
United States. Thereis the one stop
ping place in support of the great
traffic between the United States and
Australia, which is to be greatly aug
mented by the completion of the
Nicaragua Canal, while all the south
and west Pacific is already absorbed
by England. France, Germany, or
Holland. That gone, the United
States would have no Pacific coaling
stations or harbor rights, except
through the courtesies of some Euro
pean power which could yive or
withhold them."
ACADEMY NOTES.
TheAdelphian society has elected
these officers for the following term :
Gay W. Felton, president; C.J. Rum
rill, vice-president; B. S. Ward, secre
tary; B. C. Hawley, treasurer; Clin
ton Carpenter and B. T. Marshall,

ested. This number contains a por
trait of Sir Thaddeus Fairbanks.
The Senior exhibition occurs to
morrow night, at Academy hall, be
ginning at 8 o'clock. The program
includes eight or nine literary and
several musical features, and prom
ises to be pleasing throughout.
A LARGE ATTENDANCE.
This was the case at the Railroad
street Baptist church on Sunday
evening, the occasion of the Sunday
school concert ; indeed, the audience
room was not large enough to hold
all who came, and quite a number
failed to get in.. The concert was a
very interesting one, consisting of
the entertaining exercise, "Anniver-
sary Leaves," given once before, to
gether with music and recitations by
the children, who did their respective
parts verj nicel-. A collection was
taken, to be used for the benefit of
the little people at Christmas time.
SA WTELLE'S DRAMATIC COMPANY.
Thiscompany is at the Opera house
this week and drawing good-sized
audiences. The company has met
with a cordial reception in many
Vermont towns and puts such plays
as "The Gold King" and "Unknown"
on the boards in an acceptable man
ner. Last night "Black Diamond"
was presented, and a parlor set was
given away. Articles of silver ware
and a chamber set are to be given
away Saturday afternoon and evening.
DEFERRED.
A report of the recent meeting of
the State Grange is, together with
some other general matter, unavoid
ably deferred until our next issue.
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT.
The county papers have many kind
words for "St. Johnsbury Illustrat
ed." Here are samples of the com
ment they make concerning it :
The Hardwick Gazette thinks it
"the most elegant thing in the way
of a book that we remember of ever
having been issued from a Vermont
press. The book is well worth four
times the price asked for it."
The Republican sa3rs : "The interest
of the text is heightened by the pic
tures, of which there are some three
hundred. The cuts are extremely
well done, and the entire mechanical
construction of the book is worthy
of the highest praise."
The Lyndonville Journal : "It is a
truthful historical and biographical
work, with no attempt to over-rate.
It is an honor to the town and a
credit to the designers and executors
in all respects, and should bring prac
tical beneficial results to the town."
The Lyndon Union gives a lengthy
descriptive notice of the book, from
which we extract this: "The inter
esting contents and artisticexcellence
of the volume are quite a surprise,
and a credit to the town as well as
to the publisher. The prices
are altogether too cheap for the work,
but, if it is a labor of love, the full
measure of compensation will come
from a patriotic source, or the feeling
of having done a good thing for the
town."
The Burlington Free Press says:
"The subject matter is of a. widely
varied character and uniformly inter
esting. Printed on a beautiful coat
ed paper, with the best of workman
ship, and selling at an absurdly low
price considering the cost of the
many illustrations, this work cannot
fail to enjoy a wide sale.
