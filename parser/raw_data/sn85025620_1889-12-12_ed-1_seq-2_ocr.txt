GF.NERA I. Hour,ANGER'S personal ex­
penses are defrayed by his admirers in
France. Every week he receives a cer­

A number of coffers, containing about
$30,000 in gold and silver in Spanish

out of the sea near the Island of Andros

LARGE deposits of ice, believed by
some to be relics of the glacial period in
this country, have been discovered in
Idaho. They are imbedded in earth and
overgrown with moss, which has pre­

seriously proposed to form companies to
mine this ice for sale in western cities
where ice is always dear and scarce.
A WESTERN inventor is endeavoring
to interest capital in his electrical
magic lantern for casting or reflecting
advertisements on tho dark clouds that
often hang over a city. The inventor
claims to have secured contracts from
several well-known firms for displaying
their cards in this manner. If the idea
is fully developed we may expect to see
some very startling and grotesque ef­
fects.

THIS is the way they do things in Bel­
gium: The trial of M. Corvilain, owner
of the cartridge works there the explo­
sion of which recently caused terrible
loss of life, and of M. Delauny for crim­
inal negligence, ended recently in the
conviction of the accused. Corvilain
was sentenced to four and a half years
and Delauny to one year and a haif im­
prisonment, and each was fined 12,000
francs and required to pay the costs of
the trial.
A NOVEL cure was effected by the use
of the dynamo recently at Westgate-on
Sea, Eng. A Mr. Brown was fitting a
false bottom to a grate, and while chip­
ping it to make it fit a very small splin­
ter of iron flew off and struck him in
the eye. An electrical engineer who
met him shortly after, seeing his plight,
took him to a dynamo that was working
near by. Brown placed his eye as close
as possible to the machine, and the
magnetic attraction was sufficiently in­
tense to withdraw the splinter of iron
from the eye, which was instantly re­
lieved and which gave no further
trouble to him.
Miss CAROLINE HILLEGAS and Lucin

South Carolina, both aged one hundred
and fifteen years. Mrs. Easton was the
mother of twenty-two children, the eld­
est of whom, were he now living, would
be one hundred and two years old. There
is a legend to the effect that Miss Hille­
gas, while living in Florida during the
Seminole war, was scalped by the In­
dians. She was a teacher in the city
schools of Charleston for a great number
of years. Miss Hillegas outlived all of
her relatives, and at the time of her
death was the only representative of one
of Charleston's oldest families.
THE New York police officials have to
deal with a case of socialism on their
own force. The man in question is Sor

West Thirteenth street station. Five
years agu ho was warned by his superi­
ors not to give public utterance to such
sentiments as, in a certain lecture he
then delivered, he showed he held. He
now renews the declaration of his views,
giving vent to them last Sunday in a
two-column interview in tho Volks
zeitung, organ of tho Anarchists Most
and Shevitch. In it he said every fifth
man on the police force believed with
him. Inspector Byrnes denies this.

WASHINGTON, Deo. 7. The Silcott
defalcation is the sensation of the
day here, and little or nothing else is
talked about. The embezzlement, -or
breach of trust, involves nearly every
member of Congress. Every Ohio Con­
gressman with the exception of Mr.
Boothman is out a month's salary.
These are a few of the losers! and tho
amounts of their losses as shown by the
revised list:
Clark (Wis.), 13,708 Belden (N. Y.), 13,000
Geissenhainer (N. J.), 13,000 Felix Campbell
(N. Y.), 13,600 Houk and McMillan
(Tenn.), 98,000 each Hannier (Pa.), 18,600
Bayne (Pa.), 11,800 Owen (lad.),' 91,800
Bingham. (Pa.), 91,600. Among ether mem
berS|Who lose personal deposits are Represen­
tatives Rife (Pa.), 10,900! Butterworth (O.),
•BOO Hermann (Ore.), 18,600 Connell (Neb.).
12,100 Owen (Ind.), 9% Bowden (Va.),

Buekalew (Pa.), 92,600 Burrows (Mich.) 9300
Candler (Mass.), 98,600 Clunle (Cal.), 93,700

(Ky.), 9900 MoKenna (Cal.), 9500 Pickler (S.
D.), 91,300 Russell (Conn.), 9100 Stahlneoker
(N. Y.). 9100.
The committee which is investigating
the defalcation was in session all of
Friday, but its sessions have been se­
cret and every one refuses to disclose
what has taken place. Mr. Leedom,
the Sergeant-at-Arms, appeared with
his attorney and was examined
for about two hours. When the
committee had finished with him
it sent for the Assistant United States
Attorney with a view of taking his testi­
mony on the legal points in the case. At
the same time experts were at work
upon the books, who have ascertained
that $he actual amount of the defalca­
tion i» $71,800, which does not include
the losses of private depositors, which
amount to nearly 910,000 more.
Although the matter is still an open
question, it appears that the responsi­
bility for the loss can not be located.
As the bond of the Sergeant-at-Arms
was given to cover the performance ol
his official duties, it can not be seen
how his bondsmen can be held for any
loss incurred by him while acting as a
disbursing officer without any authority
of law, or how his private property could
be touched.
A bill will be introduced in Con
gress and placed immediately upon its
passage making it unlawful for any
members of Congress to overdraw
his salary or borrow money from th€
Sergeant-at-Arms or any other officer ol
the House, or seek the indorsement ol
any such officer upon financial paper,
and there is very little doubt that this
will meet with unanimous approval.
FORCES JOINED.
Articles of Federation Agreed to Between
the Knights of Labor and the Farmers'
Alliance—Platform Adopted by the Lat
ter Body.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 7.—Messrs. Powderly,
Wright and Beaumont of the Knights oi
Labor Friday met the demands of the
committee of the Farmers' and Laborers1
Union and the basis of federation be'
tween the two organizations was agreed
upon. It was agreed that both organi­
zations appoint legislative committees
to act in conjunction at Washington and
procure legislation in accordance with
the interests of both parties. An un­
derstanding was reached under which
each organization will actively aid the
other. The executive officers of the
two organizations will form a central
council to consult from time to time on
all matters of joint interest. Commit
tees on platform and money and trans­
portation were agreed upon. The
various farmers' bodies will be consoli­
dated. The leaders of both bodies ar«
highly satisfied with the arrangements
made.
The election of the Farmers' and
Laborers' Union Friday afternoon re
suited in the choice of L. L. Polk, of
North Carolina, President D. H. Clover,
of Kansas, Vice-President J. H. Turner,
of Georgia, Secretary J. W. Hickman,
of Missouri, Treasurer Benjamin Ter­
rell, of Texas, Lecturer, his fourth
term.
In the National Farmers' Alliance yes
terday resolutions were adopted prac­
tically covering the same ground as the
platform of the amalgamated societies.
In addition, taxes on real estate mort­
gages and a graded income tax were de
manded economy in the mangement
of all departments of the Govern­
ment was called for, and a special dec­
laration was launched against any prop­
osition looking to the increase of Govern­
ment employes' salaries the liquor traf­
fic was opposed in all its forms the Hen­
nepin canal project was indorsed, as was
also that of a deep harbor on the
Gulf coast. Another resolution was
passed recommending Congress to take
some action to compel the Union Pa­
cific and Central Pacific railroads to pay
their debts, and objecting to any further
extensions of time. The Australian
system of voting was enthusiastically
indorsed. The resolution on the tariff
was as follows:
"Resolved, That we favor such a revision and
redaction of the tariff that the taxes may rest
as lightly as possible upon productive labor
and that its burdens may be imposed upon
luxuries an«l removed from the necessaries of
life, and in a manner which will prevent con­
tinued accumulations of the United States
Treasury surplus."
The resolutions were then capped by
one declaring that the members of the
convention would support no candidate
who did not subscribe to the principles
enumerated therein.

WINDOWS REPORT.
eadattfas of the Secretary of the
Treasury Regarding the Tariff, Surplus,
National Banks, Kte,-Hls Plan for the
Solution of the Silver Froblem.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 5.—The Secretary of the
Treasury in his annual report submitted to
Congress yesterday shows that the total ordina­
ry revenues of the Government from all sources
lor the fiscal year ended June 90,1899, were
9*7,060,068.84, -and the expenditures 9881,988,
MS.00, leaving a surplus of 9106,063,443.34.
Of this there was used for the redemption of
notes and fractional currency and purchase of
bonds 947,583,313,66, leaving a net surplus of
907,470,199.00 for the year. For the present
year the revenues, actual and estimated, are
9886,000,000 and .the expenditures 1093,000,000.
The estimated amount required for tho sinking
fund is 948,381,116.09, leaving a net surplus of
913,A78 883.01.
During the fiscal year 1880 there was applied
to the redemption of the public debt 980,979,427.
The total net receipts from internal revenue
for tbe fiscal year 1889, as shown by the books
of the Treasury, were 9190,881,513.99, being an
increase over fhe year 1888 of 96,684,641.94.
During the/twelve months ended October 31,
1889, there were purchased under the circular
of April 17, .1889, United States bonds to the
amount of •P9,333,«S0. Of these, 933,879,400
were obtained prior to March 4, 1889, and 906,
954,660 after that date.
THE SURPLUS.
The Secretary thinks a part of the surplus
might be used in enlarging our foreign markets,
strengthening tbe coast defenses, and building
up the navy. Tbe expedient of purchasing
bonds is of doubtful wisdom, he says, be
cause it is manifestly wrong to take money
from the people for the oancellatipn of bonds
to the saving of only about 2 per cent, interest,
when it Is worth to them, perhaps, three times
as much in their business. It is rather through
a reduction of customs receipts and internal
taxes that an unnecessary accumulation of
money in the Treasury should be avoided.
THE TAX ON TOBACCO.
A
table is given showing that the total tax
on tobacco was 931,866,837.53. Mr. Windom
adds: "Whatever may be said of the moral or
physical effects and influence of tobacco it
has come to be regarded as a necessity by the
poor as well as the rich. It is now the only
product of agriculture that is directly taxed by
the Government. The repeal of this tax would
reduoe the surplus about 938,000,000."
The exemption of alcohol used in the arts, the
tax on which is an onerous burden for which
there seems neither necessity nor excuse, would
strike off 96,500,000 more.
TARIFF REVISION.
"There is a general agreement," says the
Secretary, "that a revision of the tariff and
customs laws is urgently needed. I believe it to
be tbe dominant sentiment of the country that
in the adjustment of duties on imports protec­
tion to home industry should be a governing
consideration. While there is a wide divergence
of judgment on this proposition it can not well
be denied that it is the settled policy of this
Government that such duties shall be so levied
as to result in the protection of labor employed
in domestic industries from destructive foreign
competition.
The Secretary recommends that the many in­
equalities, conflicting provisions and ambigui­
ties in the present law be corrected, and th&t
uniformity of assessment at the various ports
he secured if possible.
SILVER COINAGE.
On the question of silver coinage the Secre­
tary says: "The continued coinage of the silver
dollar, at a constantly increasing monthly qupta,
is a disturbing element in the otherwise excel­
lent financial condition of the country and a
positive hindrance to any international agree­
ment looking to the free coinage of both metals
at a fixed ratio. Mandatory purchases by the
Government of stated quantities of silver
and mandatory coinage of the same
Into full legal-tender dollars are an un­
precedented anomaly and have proved fu­
tile, not only in restoring the value of silver,
but even in staying the downward price
of that metal. Since the passage of the act
of February 88, 1878, to November 1,
1889, there have .been purchased 899,889,
416.11 standard ounces of silver, at a cost
of 9886,930,633.64, from which there have
been coined 343,638,001 standard silver dollars.
There were In circulation on November 1 of the
present year 60,098,480 silver dollars, less than
91 per capita, the remainder, 383,539,581, being
stored away in Government vaults, of which
9277,319,944 were covered by outstanding certifi­
cates."
No proper effort has been spared by the
Treasury Department, says the Secretary, to
put in circulation the dollars coined under this
law, but without success, and the point has
been, or soon will be, reached where the further
coinage of silver will become a waste of publio
money.
After specifying the various causes of the
depreciation of silver, the Secretary says it
is unquestionably true that public sentiment
and commercial and industrial necessity de­
mand the joint use of both gold and silver as
money. Neither can be discarded without the
most serious consequences, but tne great
change in the market value of the two metals
and the steady depreciation of silver arouse
grave apprehensions. The faith and power of
the Government are pledged to make the silver
dollars equal to their face value, and so long as
their number is kept within proper limits they
will be maintained at par with gold, but the
laws of trade will eventually assert their pow­
er. The problem is, therefore, says Mr. Win­
dom, how we shall use both gold and silver.
He briefly considers the various solutions of­
fered and points out objections to them. The
Secretary then makes the following important
recommendation:
"Issue treasury notes against deposits of sil­
ver bullion at the market price of silver when
deposited, payable on demand in such quanti­
ties of silver bullion as will equal in value, at
the date of presentation, the number of dollars
expressed on the face of the notes at the mar­
ket price of silver or in gold, at the option of
the Government, or in silver dollars at the op­
tion of the holder. Repeal the compulsory feat­
ure of the present coinage act."
Ampng the advantages which the Secretary
claims for the measure are that it would bring
Into use all the money metal of the country it
would give a paper currency not subject to un­
due or arbitrary inflation or contraction it
would enhance the value of silver and open
the way to its free coinage gold would be re­
lieved of part of the work required of it it
would meet the wants of those desiring
a larger volume of circulation, and it
would be advantageous to silver producers.
The Secretary gives many facts and figures
tending to support the position taken by him.
NATIONAL BANKS.
Mr. Windom gives at great length his answers
1» advance to possible criticisms and claims
that the danger of further depreciation of silver
THiiiion is remote. He deals also with the ques­
tion of depositing public moneys with National
tanks, which he considers a source of danger,
and he says: "It is my purpose, at the earliest
moment deemed practicable, to commence the
withdrawal of these funds in such limited
rmounts and under such conditions as will be
least likely to injuriously affect the business in­
terests of the country, and, unless Congress
shall otherwise direct, to invest the money ia the
purchase of bonds, in case they can be obtained
at a fair price." Mr. Windom gives a review of
the National bank system, which he, on the
whole, approves, and directs the attention of
Congress to hardships arising under tlie alien
contract labor law and to alleged evasions of
tbe Chinese exclusion act.

Passes Away at New Orleans—LmI Hours
of the DyinsMan—A Sketch.of gb Loag
and Eventful Career.
NEW ORI.EANS, Dec. 0. Jefferson
Davis, ex-President of the Confederate
States, died at the residence of his life­
long friend, J. U. Payne, at l»i45 o'clook
this morning.
Shortly before 6 o'clock in the even­
ing Mr. Davis was attacked by a severe
oongestive chill, followed by high fever.
The attack was sudden, and up to that
moment Mr. Davis was no worse than he
had been at any time
during the last week
or ten days.
From that moment to the moment
of
his death the history oil! his case was
that of a gradual sinking. At 7
o'clock
Mrs. Davis administered some medicine,
but the ex-President declined to receive
the whole dose. She urged upon
him the necessity of taking the
remainder, but, putting it aside
with the gentlest of gestures, he whis­
pered: "Pray excuse me." Those were
his words. Gradually he grew weaker
and weaker, but never for an instant
seemed to lose consciousness.
By 11:30 o'clock there were assembled
in the death-chamber Mrs. Davis, Drs.
Chaille and Bickham, Associate Justice
and Mrs. Fenner, Miss Nannie Smith,
grand-niece of the dying ex-Presi
dent, and Mr. and Mr. E. H.
Farrar. Finding that Mr. Davis
was breathing somewhat heavily as
he lay upon his back the doctors as­
sisted him to turn upon his right side.
With his cheek resting upon his
right hand like a sleeping infant and
with his left hand drooping across
his chin he lay for some fifteen
minutes breathing softly but faintly-.
More and more feeble became his res*
pirations till they:passed into, silence
and then the watchers knew that the
silver cord had been loosed and the
golden bowl broken.
HIS CAREER.
Jefferson Davis was born June 3, 1808, in
that part of Christian County, Ky., which
now forms Todd County. His father was
Samuel Davis, and he had served in the
Georgia cavalry during the revolution. When
Jefferson was but an infant the family
moved to a place near Woodville, Miss.,
where young Davis began his education,
later entering the Transylvania College, Ken­
tucky. In 1824 he was appointed by President
Monroe to the United States Military Acade­
my, from which he graduated in 1828, and was
assigned to the First Infantry. He served in
the Black Hawk war of 1831-'3S, and March 4/
1833, was promoted to be First Lieutenant of
Dragoons.
June 30,1835, after more service against th«
Indians, be resigned, eloped with the daughter
of Zachary Taylor, then a Colonel in the army,
And settled near Vicksburg, Miss., as
a cotton planter. He remained here
quietly until 1843, when he entered
politics and made a reputation as a
popular speaker. In 1845 he was sent to Con­
gress, where he at once took an active part
in debate, especially with reference to
the preparations for the war with
Mexico. In June, 1840, he resigned
his scat in the House to accept the
Colonelcy of the First Mississippi Volunteers,
and at oncc moved to reinforce General Taj
lot
on the Rio Grande. His record in this war was
an excellent one. He charged a fort kt Mon­
terey without bayonets and led the command
through the streets nearly to the Grand Plaza.
May 37, 1847, his regiment was ordered home
and he was made a Brigadier-General by Presi
dent Polk, but declined the honor. In August ha
went to the Senate, where he became a zealous
advocate of State rights. In 1851 he re­
signed his seat, to become candidate foi
Governor of Mississippi, but was defeated at
the polls. A year later he supported Franklin
Pierce for the Presidency, and as a reward for
hislaboiswas made Secretary of War. He in­
creased the standing army, improved the
equipment and made many changes in the tac­
tics.
At the close of President Pierce's term he
was again sent to the Senate and became the
Democratic leader. Many of his speeches dur­
ing this time contained strong Union senti­
ments, but December 10, i860, he made a
speech in which he carefully distinguished be­
tween "the independence which the States
had achieved at great cost" and the Union,
which had cost "little time, little money and no
blood," thus taking his old State-rights posi­
tion. anuary 10,1801, he made another speech,
asserting the right of secession and urging that
the garrison be withdrawn from Fort Sumter.
January 84, being officially informed that Mis­
sissippi had seceded January 9, he withdrew
from the Senate and went to his home. He
was at once appointed Commander-in-Chief of
the army of Mississippi, but February 18, 1861,
he resigned that office to accept the Presi.
dency of the Confederate States. In his
inaugural address he said that "ne­
cessity, not choicc," had led to se­
cession. November 10, 1861, he was formally
elected President for six years and was duly
inaugurated February 22,1863. Before that he
had held the office by virtue of appointment by
the Provisional Congress.
December 23, 1868, he issued a procla­
mation in retaliation for the emancipation
proclamation of President Lincoln. In
this he declared that General B. F.
Butler was a felon, and ordered that all com­
missioned officers serving under him, as well as
all serving with slaves, should be treated as
"robbers and criminals deserving death."
In January, 1865, he sent three commissioners
to treat with tho United States Government,
but their mission was unsuccessful. There
was a temporary outburst of enthusiasm, but
it soon died away, as the Union armies con­
tinued to advance, and.more and more dissatis­
faction was expressed. In his last message to the
Congress—March 13, 1865-Mr. Davis asserted
that the Confederacy had ample means to meet
the emergency, and April 2, less than a month
later, he was obliged to evacuate Richmond.
He was captured near Irwinsviile, Ga., May
10, and taken to Fort Monroe. May 8,
1866, he was indicted for treason by a grand
jury in the United States District Court for
Virginia, sitting at Norfolk under Judge Un.
derwood. May 13. 1867, he was admitted
to bail in the sum of 1100,000. He was
never brought to trial, a nolle prosequi
being entered by the Government December,
1868. After being given an enthusiastic recep­
tion in the South, his imprisonment having
silenced all opponents, he went to Canada
and then to England. Returning he became
president of a life-insurance company in
Memphis. In 1879 Mrs. Dorsey, of Beau
vofir, Miss., bequeathed him her estate,
and there he has since resided, occasionally ap­
pearing to make a speech in some Southern
city. He was excepted from a bill restoring po­
litical rights to those who took part in the re­
bellion and excepted from a bill pensioning
veterans of the Mexican war, it being charged
that he was responsible for the horrors of An
dersonville.
