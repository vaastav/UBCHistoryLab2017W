Suggests Doctrine of "Right Makes
Might." Asks Better Food Laws
(By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. President
Wilson in his final regular message to
congress, sent to a joint session of the
two houses by a messenger, called on
congress to enact a program of legis
lation which he said would put the
United States in the forefront of a
movement to make the spiritual power
of democracy prevail throughout the
world. The president said: "There are
two ways in which the United States
can lead in establishing the doctrine of
'right makes might: First, by offering
an example within our own borders of
the will and powers of democracy to
enforce laws which are unquestionably
just and equal in administration; sec
ond, by standing for right and justice
toward the individual nations." He
further declared that the "display of an
immediate disposition on the part of
congress to remedy any injustices and
evils in our own national life which
will afford the most effectual offset to
be force9 of chaos and tyranny which
are playing so disastrous a part in the
fortunes of the free peoples in more
' than one part of the world." Presi
dent Wilson did not mention the peace
treaty nor the League of Nations in his
message. He submitted the following
program to carry out his aims: The

Colonel Curmew Threatened For Involving
Beautiful Diana Tennant in
Reno Murder Incident
Feeling against Colonel Follis Cur
mew, the wealthy oil operator, runs
high at the house party of E. H. Rivett,
popularly known as the "iron king," due
to offensive conduct on the part of Col
onel Curmew towards Diana Tennant,
professional society hostess, who slip
ped away from the party.
Miss Tennant, although a hired em
ploye, became quite popular while at
.the party. Rumor has it that Colonel
Curmew, who i qu;tc an impression

FROM COAST TO SALT LAKE
Tom Salter and associates, who have

financing of the scheme.
They hope to open for business short

pose a six-hour flight between the two
cities. The fare will be about a third
higher than that charged by the rail
roads and will be the first competition
between rail and air service in regard
to carrying passengers.
While the trip by rail requires from
thirty-two to thirty-six hours, it is stat
ed that the difference in time more
than makes up for the excess in fare
charges. A certain amount of express is

Nevada Commission Defends State
Rights on Carrier Orders
The hearing before the Interstate
Commerce commission as to the action
of the Nevada Public Service commis
sion in refusing to advance freights
and fares as ordered by the commission
in intrastate business, started in Reno
yesterday before Thomas P. Healy, an
examiner for the national commission.
The carriers opened with iheir exhib
its, endeavoring jto showthat the intra
state business would have to be raised
to conform with the interstate order, j
Much testimony has been submitted by
the carriers in order to make a case
before the examiner.
In each instance the Nevada commis
sion has fought the reasonableness of
the statements, and a mass of figures
has been prepared and presented.
Every rail interest in the state has a
representative at the hearing and it is
possible that each will be cross-exam
ined before the hearing is concluded.
Among the Nevada railway men pres
ent at yesterday's meeting were: W. B.
Hinchman, general manager, Tonopah

traffic manager, Nevada Northern, and

MEDICAL MEN MEET
TO FACE BIG PROBLEM
IBy United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Physicians
and noted men from all parts of the
United States met here yesterday Lr
a week's conference to plan a nation
wide campaign against the "Great Red
Plague," a phrase invented by the Unit
ed States public health service' to stand
for two social diseases.
The conference was called by Dr.
Hugh Cumings, surgeon general of the
United States.
Practically certain cures now have
been discovered and proved by medical
science for the two most common social
diseases, according to officials of the
health service. To be effective in com
batting the diseases in the United
States, however, the cures must be un
derstood by the public, officials point
out. How to get the facts across con
vincingly will be one of the problems
to be discussed by the conference.
General Pershing is one of many not
d men who have accepted invitations
to attend. Pershing is expected to de
scribe the methods used by the military
authorities to protect the A. E. F,
against disease in France and later in
Germany.

intrastate traffic is not subject to re

MAKING GOOD PROGRESS

Dixon brothers, who have a lease on
the Roberts-Regan (South West Corn
stock Mining company) property, are
making good progress in their sinking.
Despite timlering and necessary sur
face repairs the boys are averaging ten
feet per week. At this rate they will
be to the first drift level within a few
weeks, when they will start a drift to
ward the west, where the ledge seems
to make the best values and the vein is
the heaviest.
As they began work from the 200-foot
level, by the time they start the drift
the property will lie one of the deepest
in this section!. They are following the
dip of the vein as they sink and as they
are working between the walls little
powder has been used in the sinking.
Considerable high grade ot is being
taken out as the shaft is being sunk.
The property certainlv looks like the
making of a mine.

AGED ATHLETES WHO
DEFY RULE OF YOUTH
rRv Henrv L. Farrell. United Press

NEW YORK, Dec. 7. Young blood
holds the scepter of the athletic and
sport world.
Youngsters have come so completely
in power that, outside of baseball, an
athlete is considered on the back slide
when he rounds the twenty-eighth mile
stone of his course.
Like with all rules, however, the ex
ceptions to this rule are more interest
ing than its proofs.
Age battled with youth more evenly
in the Olympic games than in any oth
er contest of recent years.
Take Albert Hill, for instance, the
British runner who was one of the two
athletes to win two events.
Hill is 35 years of age and retired
from athletics before the war, yet he
came back and won the 800 and 1,500
metre runs.
Hodge, the British cross-country run
ner, is amother notable come-back. He
is 32 years of age and had been out of
a track suit for five years. Yet he out
ran a field of young blood and won the
3,000 metre steeplechase.
Philip Baker, another 30 year old
Englishman, was second in the high
jump and beat Dick Landon in the dual
meet between the American and Eng
lish teams in London after the Olympic
games.
The three New York police whales
erans witnstanuing tne rusn oi time.
The Finns had Jonnie Myraa, a 34
year old giant, who threw the javelin
for a world's record.
Among our boxing celebrities is the
veteran Jack Britton, welterweight
champion, who clings to the title al
though he is 35 years of age. Johnny
Kilbane, gray-haired at 32, is still the
feather weight champion
Baseball lists veterans galore who are
still active, although "well up in
years," as Dode Paskert, 39; Gavvy
Cravath, 38; Jake Daubert, 35; Ed
Konetchy, 35; Ivy Olson, 35; Larry
Doyle, 34; Art Fletcher, 34; Ty Cobb,
34; Eddie Collins, 33; Ping Bodie, 33,
and Ainsmith, 33.
the premier will arrange a meeting. A
home' rule bill last night passed the
committee stage in the house of lords,
when it was voted to eliminate the
clause under which Ireland would be
governed as a crown colony in case of
an insufficient number of Irish legisla
tors refused to take the oath of allegiance.
sult of the Howard street vice gang
case and the shooting of the three offi
cers in Santa Rosa Sunday call for
this measure. Crime is increasing in
proportion to the number of criminals
paroled or placed on probation, Mor

INTERESTING PROGRAM
AT P. T. MEETING
An unusual program is to be offered
at the Parents' and Teachers' meeting
tomoorow evening at the high school
auditorium. Instead of the regular af
ternoon session the meeting will take
place in the evening. The business
meeting will be held at 7:30, to be fol
lowed by a talk and lantern slides by
Mr. Cox.
This gentleman spent several years
in China and collected a large number
of very interesting photographs and
slides. These will be shown those who
attend.
It will undoubtedly make one of the
most interesting evenings given by the
association in some time and will be
well worth attending.

TO APPRECIATORS OF SNOW
The home people are quite aware that
it is snowing again, as the inconven
iences incidental with next summer's
water supply is quite apparent.
However, in case those who take the
Appeal outside of this non-citrus belt,
wish to keep posted on just what the
weather is doinp, it can be stated that
there is more snow falling today, with
a low barometer to help gladden their
spirits.
It is always edifying when one is out
of the snow belt to know that one's old
neighbors are working blisters on their
hands shoveling snow.
