CONGRESS-
The last stfaion cf the Forty-first
Congress assembled in Washington, on
Monday, the sth inst. Considerably
more than a quorum being present, t e
President's message was sent in and
read. The President congratulates the
country on our amicable ~relations with
other countries, and work of reconstruc
tion. Ho recommends further legis
lation ou the internal tevenue and the
tariff, having for its object the reduct
ion of the aggregate taxation. He fur
ther advocates a law authorizing free
trade in ships, aud some additional
measure, if neccessiry, to promote the
funding of the public debt. We will
publish the message iu full next
week.
EIGHT CONGRESSMEN
Within a short time the present Cun
gtess will pass an act apportioning ref
tesentut ives among the. states, as le
quirei by the constitution, according
to the late census. The ad wili most
likely make j revisions lor increasing
the number ci members from 243 to
800. The total population of the
United States is about 28,280,000, and
on the basis of 300 members, there
will be one representative to every 127,-
000 inhabitants. This is the same ra
tio as that established by the Census
of 1860. The population of Wiscon
sin is 1.053,886, entitling us to eight
representatives. Of course nothing
definite is known as to how the state
will be divided, and much curiosity is
evinced in regard to the counties
the new districts will contain.
The Milwaukee Sentinel of Monday
last, contains a very elaborate map, ex
hibiting what it conceives to be a very
fair and equitable division of tie state
into tie tight congressional districts,
and showing plainly the boundaries
and population of each. The propos
ed new districts, with the majorities
they gave at the gubernatorial election
of one year ago, are as follows :
Ut District. —Grant, lowa, Sauk, Rich

Capt. L. B. Hills, of Dodge county,
who has been Chief Clerk of the
State Senate for the last three sessions
to tho satisfaction of everybody, seems
likely to meet with opposition this sea
son in the person of W. M. Newcomb,
of La Fayette county. The 3lineral
Point Tribune “gois for” Hills’ oppo
nent in the foilowieg manner :
‘‘Since the result of (bo election fur
members of our State Legislature has
become generally known the number
cf applicants for clerkships and other
positions has increased so rapidly that
wc cannot keep track of them- We
learn that a prominent aspirant for the
Chief Clerkship of the Senate is Wil
lii.m *l. Newcomb, of Darlington. Mr
N. has been a ehrk in the Assembly
lor years; and when we consider that
he it a "dead beat' in about every sense
that term can be used; that he lia.>
never given over five dollars to the
party that has so frequently fed him
with lucrative positions; that he has
seldom, if ever, contributed either
money, labor or time, to the success of
'.he Republican party in his own coun
ty; that lie usually votes asplit ticket;
that he has no influence outside of u
limited air-ole; that he las tried time
and again lb? the Republic;n nomina
tion for the Assembly, and as often
failed; and that he cannot receive the
endorsement of his party for any posi
tion limits gift, we think Senators will
conserve the general inteicsts of the
Republican party by selecting a more
worthy person for the highest position
in their gift, Mr. Newcomb, welearn,
claims to Lave eleven Repubii an Sen
ators pledged to bis support. We be
lieve Republican Senators have too
great a regard fur the iuteres's of the
public and the party, to make such
pledgee There are many men who
have given their time and means for
the success of our party ; there a;e
many worthy soldiers who deserve the
position ; (here are many men ol great
er fitness and ability than Mr, New
comb ; and there are men who have
really claims upon the Republican
party, that Mr. N. lias not, \\ e hope
Republican Senators will select a man
who possesses tome ciauns worthy of
recognition.”

La Crosse Democrat, 'l'dth.
A New Ire la no Springing Up
—That New -England should, at no
very distant day, bec-me New Irelano
is a very shocking reflection to the de
scendants of the Puiitansj but the
thing is a possibility, nevertheless. In
1808, one-third of the population ot
Massachusetts was made up of persons
born of Irish fathers and mothers;
and ot HG, 103 births, those of foreign
born parents exceeded those of native
burn by S.UUU. The baptism of infants
in the Catholic churches amounts to
20,000 per annum. Fifty years ago
there were but three Catholic famines
in Connecticut and Rhode Island, ac
cording to the statement of Bishop Me
Farland; now, there are three hun
dred Catholic churches to accuiumu
date the 200,00 U Irish Catholics in
those States. In Rhode Island, the
Catholics are one-third ot the popula
tion. and, in 1809, had as many births
as the other two-thirds—a fact winch
goes far toward explaining the whole
matter. If the native New England
stock is thus ceasing to bear fruit, while
the exotic Irish stock bears so abun
and uitly. the inexorable result must fol
low : New England will cease to be
what it is, and become something else
—and what else should it be, but New
Ireland ?
Pork promises to rule at low figures
this season, and dealers are anticipat
ing a tall in the market in March cr
April, Hogs are more abundant in
this partot the country than they have
been for years, and the corn crop has
been so good that many farmers wili
hold their hogs till spring hopes of
better prices, which, i addition to the
large quantity of pork generally
thrown pon the market at that sea
son, will reduce prices materially. Our
advice to farmers is to sell immediately,
taking the best prices they can get. —
