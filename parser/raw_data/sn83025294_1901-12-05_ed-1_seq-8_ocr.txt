DEBATE WAS WARM AT TIMES
Hunicipal Ownership Hen Opposed the
Granting of the Proposed Right
Unless the City Could Event
ually Acquire the Plant.
The committee of the city council, to
tvhich was entrusted the matter of pass
ing upon the franchise for a new tele
phone system which a company headed
■by H. H. Stewart of West Superior de
sires to establish in Butte, held a meeting
yesterday afternoon and listened to a
warm presentation of the various phases
pf the situation.
Several members of the municipal
league were present and participated in
the debate, among them being Charles M.
Parr and Green Majors, who are tirai
believes in municipal ownership.
Thomas S. Hogan, fomerly secretary
of state, represented Mr. Stewart and the
new company.
Ownership by City.
Mr. Majors said the league desired that
the city should eventually own its own
telephone system and requested that in
the event of a franchise being given the
new comer that it be so worded that the
city could buy the line at the expiration
of a certain period.
"Competition in the shape of another
telephone company would be no advant
age to the city." he said.
Rates might be reduced for a time, but
the war would result in the defeat of the
weaker company and a combination
would be effected with the result that
rates would go higher than ever.
"The league has no enemies to punish
or friends to reward; it merely considers
this a good opportunity for the city to
make a start towards the ownership of
public utilities.
"The city should have the privilege of
taking the system from the hands of the
company at tht expiration of a certain
time by paying for it a fair price."
The Cost Discussed.
Mr. Majors asked Mr. Hogan what it
would cost to establish the system and
the latter replied $223.000.
Mr. Majors expressed the belief that
the company would make 20 per cent on
lits investement and at the. end of 25
years would have been paid the amount
■of its investment five times over, which
he considered a sufficient profit.
He thought the city should acquire the
plant at the expiration of the franchise
without cost and that the company
should be compelled to furnish an indem
nifying bond to keep the system in good
repair.
He considered the provision allowing
the city 15 telephones free of charge out
of trim and added that the city should
pay for its telephones the same as in
dividuals do.
In reply Mr. Hogan said that every
concession that could be made by the
company had been made.
"It must be understood," said he. "that
the new company proposes to enter a
field already occupied and that no con
cessions and restrictions were asked of
the old company."
Question of Per Cent.
He thought that instead of 20 per cent
the company would do well if it made
10 or 121,2 per cent on its investment.
He asked that action by the committee
•be speedy, as the matter had already
been under fire two months.
Asked by the chairman of the league
why the company proposed to charge
twice as much for telephones as it
charged in West Superior. 'Mr. Hogan
answered that in West Superior labor
ers could be had for $2.25 per day of 10
hours while in Butte it was necessary
to pay them $4 for eight hours work.
In West Superior telephones girls
were glad to get $20 per month, while
in Butte they were paid $60.
Mr. Parr asked that action on the
franchise be deferred a few days as he
desired to get some figures to show that
ithe cost of establishing the system would
not be as much as Mr. Hogan had rep
resented.
Best Citizens of Butte.
The league, he said, was composed of
come of the best citizens of Butte and
•they had a right to be heard. He
thought he could have the figures in
eight or nine days.
Mr. Hogan said the figures would not
be worth anything when Mr. Parr got
them. "We are trying to get into Butte
for the purpose of creating competition
and lowering rates," said he, "and you
would impose upon us conditions which
no company could accept.
"Tbsa qgtablished company had no such
conditions with which to contend. It
does not have to turn its franchise over
to the-city after it has operate 1 a few
years or give a royalty to lay its wires
underground."
After the debate the committee went
into executive session and made three
changes in the franchise, after which it
announced that it would favor its
passage with amendments.
One of the amendments provides for
the donation of a royalty of 3 per cent
ot the gross receipts to the city; an
other that the franchise must be ac
cepted by the company within 60 days,
and the third makes more clear the
clause relating to the manner in which
tb* city can acquire the propetty at the
and of 10 years.
WILL SELL LOTS.
Washoe Copper Suit Tried, by Judge
Clancy.
•In the suit of the Washoe Copper com
pany against Joseph Frazier and others,
minors, the trial took place in Judge
Clancy's court this morning and the
court ordered a sale of the property in
volved.
The suit was brought for the purpose
of dividing lots 14 and 15 in the Leg
gatt addition, l»e!onging in an undi
vided state to all the parties to the suit
and being worth about $2000.
The plaintiff claimed a nine-twelfth
interest in the lots, and admitted that
the children Lee. Fred and Jeffrey Fra
zier owned a one-twelfth interest apiece
In them.
The complaint stated that the prop
»rtj; could not be divided by partition
without prejudice to the rights of all
the parties.
The prayer of the plaintiff asked that
it be sold and the proceeds divided.
When the suit was begun Joseph and
Lizzie Frazier were minors and de
fendants, also, but they had come of
age and sold their one-sixth to the
Washoe company.
Attorney Lamb, the guardian of the
Fraziers, represented them. He put. In
no defense, and the order of the coürt
was made when the plaintiff's testimony
was concluded.

AFTER SALVADORA
OFFICERS PURSUE HIM TO HOME
STAKE AND BACK.
SEEN YESTERDAY ON THE FLAT
Under Sheriff McGuigan and Detective
Murphy on Trail of Italian Who
Shot His Rival Tamale Ven
der—Capture Probable.
Today it was stated by an officer, who
had been on the trail of "Bulldog" Sal- 1
vadora, an Italian tamale man. charged
with having killed his business rival, '
Joseph Warund in the Swiss saloon 1
early yesterday morning, that there was
a good chance of capturing Salvadora !
within the next 48 hours.
Under Sheriff McGuigan and Detective !
Murphy got a clew yesterday afternoon
at about 3 o'clock that Salvadora had
been seen on the fiat east of .ne city, and
they were on his trail till 1 o'clock thi3
morning, tracing him out over the flat
to Homestake and back to this city.
Believed to Be in Hiding.
It was believed this morning that Sal- i
vadora was then in this city in hiding
and that his covert would be discovered
and he taken into custody within the
time named.
The officers in question had a clew to
his whereabouts and were Chen keeping
watch for him.
Yesterday afternoon the two officers
received intelligence that the man had
been seen at 448 Harrison avenue out on
the fiat, and they went there.
At Chat point they were told that a
man answering to the Italian's descrip
tion had been seen to enter an outhouse.
The man who related this bit of news
was positive that the man was Salva
dora and he was much impressed by the
change of headgear made by the latter.
The Italian went away from the Har
rison street neighborhood toward the
mountains that shut in Homestake can
yon.
Take Up the Trial.
The officers took up his trail and re
mained in the saddle till 11 o'clock last
night, riding 25 or 30 miles in the search.
They visited the Nine-Mile house and
many ether houses and places on the
way to Homestake, where their journey
eastward ended.
In the Homestake neighborhood they
learned that Salvadora had retraced his
steps toward the city, and they also re
turned. They reached Butte about 11
o'olock last night and spent the next two
hours searching Italian resorts in the
city on Colorado street and elsewhere.
Capture in Near Future.
If Salvadora is in Butte, as Under
Sheriff McG-uigan and the detectives have
the best of reasons to believe, he ought to
be captured in the course of a short time.
In taking to the mountains Salvadora
would not now have the advantages of
warm weather, such as Patrick Hayes
had when fleeing from arrest in October.
The temperature at present is rather
too chilly for an Italian to enjoy
sleeping in the wilds, and Salvadora is
a son of semi-tropic Naples.
In all probability he will be forced to
remain in the shelter of this town or
some other and thereby increase the like
lihood of capture.
Of Course.
Once upon a time there dwelt in the
deserts of the far Orient a tribe of Be
douins who were at great pains to per
fect themselves in the art of dancing
with the small of the back.
Neighboring tribes, wondering, made
bold to ask, "To what end?"
"Why, in order that we may appear
worthily of the great exposition held
from time to time to exhibit the indus
tries, commercial and intellectual prog
ress of the United States, of course-"
replier the Bedouins.—Puck.

Melinda Mokeby—Why, he repohted
eround dat Misteh Mokington lost all his
money at craps an' policy, when every

rassment.—Puck.
A Presentiment.
"I have a presentiment that something
dreadful is going to happen to my hus
band," exclaimed the South American
lady.
"Is he engaged in another revolu
tion?"
"No; there wasn't any revolution to

VERDICT FOR RAILROAD.
Anderson Defeated in His Suit for
Damages.
(Special to Inter Mountain.)
Helena, Dee. 5.—Late yesterday after
noon Judge Hiram Knowles granted the
motion of William Wallace, attorney ,
for the Northern Pacific Railway com- !
pany, for an instruction to the jury
for a verdict for the defendant in the
personal injury suit brought by C. B. An- j
derson.
The case had been on trial for thé laet |
week and many witnesses were exam- 1
ined. Judge Knowles granted the 1110 -
tion on the ground that the plaintiff waJ 1
guilty of contributory negligence. "
Anderson sought to recover $10,000 for
personal injuries sustained by being 1
driven over an embankment at a point
where a crossing had been removed by
the railroad.
The contributory negligence which
Judge Knowles declared the pla'intiff
guilty of, was of a number of reasons
which the court gave for grantiifg the
motion. The case will probably be ap
pealed to the circuit court of appeals at
San Francisco.

terviews with prominent party men of
all political faiths bring out the same
expression of favor on every hand.
One prominent citizen said \yhen in

terests of the West would be entirely
safe in President Roosevelt's hands; that
he was the best acquainted of agyCof
our presidents with the needs of?the
West.
The message was generally read in
Helena among ail classes, and it held
particular interest in official circles. ■
