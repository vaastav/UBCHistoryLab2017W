ELKTON, MARYLAND, DECEMBER 11, 189?.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY’S first annual message was sent
to Congress on Monday, unusual attention having been
given it by both branches of that body.
It is hut passing an impartial judgment upon it to
say, that it is a frank, manly and exhaustive state piper, which
amply reflects the intellectual and moral qualities of its author,
and which will excite fresh confidence in his prudence, wisdom
and sagacity as a statesman.
It is not our purpose to present a long and tedious analysis of
the President's message, but simply to note its salient features,
particularly his views and recommendations on those two subjects
of popular interest, currency reform, and the Cuban question,
which iu a measure had been anticipated.
Appreciating the absolute importance of protecting the Gov
ernment against the necessity of further issues of bonds to main
tain our National currency at a par with gold, the President
recommends, that when United States notes are redeemed in gold
they shall not he paid out again except in exchange for gold; or
quoting his own language he recommends, “that as soon as the
receipts of the Government are quite sufficient to pay all the
expenses of the Government, when any of the United States notes
are presented for redemption in gold, and are redeemed in gold,
snob notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in
exchange [nr gold.”
The plan is a simple one but no less effective, appealing at
once to popular intelligence and common sense, or as a contem
teuiporary puts it, if the greenback is good enough to draw gold
when it is paid in why should it not be good enough to draw
gold when it is paid out? If the holder uses it to get gold why
should he recover it without returning the gold? If the green
back is to he exchangeable for gold why shouldn't the rule operate
lor the Government as well as for the individual? The result
would he that, after the notes were once redeemed, for evety
dollar of paper that went forth a gold dollar would stand in its
place. That would break “the endless chain;” it would give
absolute security; it would keep assured parity. It removes the
danger of the greenbacks without contracting the currency. It
provides for taking them up without issuing any interest bearing
bonds. A vital part of the plan is a revenue equal to expendi
ture. Without that it would be just as necessary to borrow as
it was under the Cleveland Administration. But the reoouise
would at least have the merit of distinctly and avowedly borrow
ing to meet deficit instead of borrowing under the false pretence
of maintaining the gold reserve.
The President recommends to the earnest consideration of
Congress the currency plan of Secretary Gage, concurring in the
establishment of hanks with $35,000 capital, and in allowing
hanks to issue notes, the denomination of which shall not he
under $lO, up to the face value of their bonds.
A careful review aud conservative consideration of all the
conditions involved in the Cuban question, leads the President to
the conclusion, that any action by the United States, even a
recognition of belligerency should he delayed until the evident
intention of the Sagasta Cabinet to reasonably pacify the Cubans
and establish promised reforms shall have had full time aud
opportunity to show its sincerity and value.
In other words the President asks Congress and the country
to wait on events as they unfold, neither anticipating their occur
rence, nor when they arise avoiding their responsibility, by either
trespassing on the rights of Spain, or disregarding the wrongs of
Cuba
We believe the business aud conservative sentiment of the
country will sustain the attitude taken by the President.
Following an extended discussion of the Cuban question the
message deals distinctly and succinctly with a variety of subjects
of wide importance.
The treaty for the annexation of Hawaii is briefly averted to
and urged. The Nicaragua canal should receive attention. The
The International Bimetallic Commission has not been successful,
though it may still make some not hopeful effort. International
arbitration is favored. Measures tor Alaska and for the Indian
Territory are suggested. Equipment and facilities are more
needed tor the navy just now than new ships Civil Service
Reform will he upheld. These are the minor topics of a message
which exemplifies in every part the careful and judicious leader
ship of a prudent and sagacious President and which will be
received with cordial approval by the country.
At the recent meeting of the State Association of School
Commissioners aud Examineis, Governor Lowudes, Rev. J. E
Nicholson and Prof. E. B. Prettyman were designated a com
mittee to prepare a memorial to be presented to Congress asking
that the State of Maryland lie given a share in the distribution of
the monies derived from the sale of public lands. Such monies
are, by the laws of other States, used for school purposes.
Should the claim be graited by Congress a large amount
would he realized by the State.
An exchange quotes Prof. Prettyman as saying: “I have been
interested in this important question for some time, and after a
long anil careful search I can see no plausible reason why we
Marylanders should not share in the distribution of public lauds.
During several trips through Western States I noticed that all had
magnificent public school buildings, aud the greater part of the
money (or the purpose was received from the sale of public lands.
I believe that the public lauds of the United States should be
sacredly devoted to the advancement of public education.
“For a long time the Maryland Statesmen iu tho Continental
Congress were the only representatives to advocate national jur
isdiction over tlie Western lands. Their efforts were finally suc
cessful, and the national government was placed in control of the
public lands.
1 ‘This is a good reason why Maryland should he granted a
•hare ol the large areas of lands in the West. Only one vigorous
attempt has been made until recently, so far as I can ascertain, to
change the national policy in connection with the public lands,
in IH2I the General Assembly of Maryland adopted an elaborate
report to the effect that each of tlie United .States had an equal
right to pm tie pate iu the benefit of the public lands. The t.egis
latui es of se .ei .il States endorsed this report, hut this appears to
have been the etui of the matter.”
Frof. Prettyman said that the public lands in the United
States ' i igiualty amounted to l,s 10,000,000 acres, hut only about
000,0 .o,ouo acieo still leniaiu in government control, exclusive of
Alaska.
CECIL WHIG, ELKTON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1897.
AM) now oonu► the spcoii.l step, in the effect of the new
tiiiiH'. the improvement in waKPH. The first improvement under
a protective tariff of course would be that relating to the number
of pmple employed as soon as the new law was assured. This was
felt, for it will be remembered that there was a marked increase
in the number of people employed, e.en before the Dingley bill
went upon the statute books The second step in the result of the
measure is increased wages and that is uow beginning to make
itself apparent. Notices have been pasted in the Mahoning Valley,
in Ohio, announcing an increase of twenty per cent, in wag>s
among the limestone operatives of that section, reports come from
the iron mines of Michigan and Pennsylvania that wages are to he
increased ten per cent, on January first, while large numbers of
manufacturing establishments in various parts of the country have
already announced an increase in wages. It will be a Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year to millions in the United States
to whom the holiday season brought little of brightness in former
years.
Tim administration has managed its work so admirably an to
give the enemy no points of vantage, while the tariff legislation of
the special session of Congress is so satisfactory to the public that
it oinnot he successfully attacked. Democratic attacks about the
Cuban policy, the Hawaiian policy, and the Pacific Railroad sale
have one by one failed, while the general prosperity which has
followed Republican control makes the demand for Democratic
campaign ammunition very great. As a result the Democrats are
anxiously waiting for the developments of the next few months,
though they are likely to be as much disappointed in them as
they have been in their failure to find vulnerable points in the
woik of Congress and the administration thus far.
That mnoli-talked-of visit of Mr. Bryan to Mexico is now to
begin. The Mexicans are to be told, presumably in their native
tongue, how much better off they are with a tree-coinage system,
in which it takes two and a-half silver dollars to buy an article
whiuh one silver dollar under the limited-coinage system of the
United States will buy, and on his return Mr. Bryan is to
explain to the people of this country the advantage which would
come to them by exchanging our currency system with its l;i one
hundied-oent dollars per cipita for the Mexican system of 5 forty
ceut dollars per capita. The public will anxiously await this
somewhat remarkable undertaking of this somewhat remarkable
financier.
The United States as a whole is following the example
which the farmers of the country set in utilizing their first earn
ings for a reduction of their mortgage indebtedness. Less of
American securities are now being held abroad than at any time
in the past quarter of a century, thus showing that the country,
like the citizens, is reducing as rapidly as possible the amount
which it must pay to others for interest on indebtedness.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
Washington, December loth, HOT.
Regular Correspondence Cecil Whig.
The great sympathy felt for the bereavement of President
McKinley tinged the assembling of Congress with unusual sadness
which not even the great interest felt in the strong message of the
President could dissipate. There were the usual crowds in the
galleries of both House and Senate, but the sorrow expressed iu
the faces of ,Senators and Representatives was reflected in the
faces of the visitors above them There is something in the death
of one’s mother that appeals to the sympathies of others as does
the death of no other relative.
* *
*
Had President McKinley followed the examhle of his imme
diate predecessor, who rarely finished one of his messages to Con
gress until tlie day before Congress met, his message would not
have been ready, but be completed the message a week ago, and
did not have that on Ida mind while traveling to the bedside of
his stricken mother, from which he returned to Washington to
perform the duties incumbent upon him at the opening of the
session of Congress. As soon us those duties were performed lie
started for Canton again, to perform a more painful duty, carrying
witli him the sorrowful sympathies of the whole country.
* *
*
Three P’s, patriotism, peace, and prosperity form the keynote
of President McKinley’s annual message to Congress. His treat
ment of the Annexation of Hawaii, the Cuban and other foreign
questions, including that of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic to
the core, without the slightest trace of jingoism, and Ids treat
ment of the financial and other domestic questions is that of a
mau who only desires that which will continue and increase the
prosperity the country is now beginning to enjoy.
* *
*
In addition to getting a first-class man to fill the important
position of Attorney General, President McKinley’s choice of
Ciov. John W Griggs, of New Jersey, to fill the vacancy in the
Cabinet that will he made by the nomination of Attorney General
McKenna to succeed Justice Field, who retired from the U. S.
Supreme Court last week, after having served there longer than
any of his predecessors, is considered to he a good political move—
one that will aid materially in keeping New Jersey in the Repub
lican column, and the wish is general that Governor Griggs will
accept the tendered portfolio.
# *
The activity iu certain quarters in efforts to make tire public
believe that there is some doubt about the auuexation of Hawaii,
iudicates that some money is being spent for the purpose of creat
ing auti-aunexatiou sentiment. If so, it is being thrown away, ns
annexation is absolutely sure to come before the close of this
session of Congress. Two-thirds of the Senate are ready at any
time to vote for the ratification of the annexation treaty, hut the
rules of the Senate put it in the power of the opponents—not more
than twenty at the outside—to delay the vote. Should it become
apparent that this power is being used fur filibustering purposes,
annexation will be secured by legislation, which will only need a
majority vote.
* *
The more conservative element iu Cougrsss is strongly in
favor of making this session as short as possible. This sentiment
was voiced by Representative Heatwole, of Minnesota, when lie
said; “In my opinion, tide Congress should get through its rou
tine work by May 1 and adjourn. The smallest amount of legis
lation will be of the greatest benefit to the country, and if we can
finish and go home by that date a good many millions of our
countrymen will rise up and call us blessed.” Speaker Reed says
he sees no excuse at present for making the session a very long
one.”
*
*
Nothing of more general benefit to the morals of the country
has been done lately than the ollioial announcement of the I’ost
Office Department that the mails would hereafter he closed to
newspapers that print missing-letter word contests, or any other
kind of advertising matter containing chance or lottery schemes.
Some of the most daring swindling of the age lias been conducted
by this class of advertisers, all of which violated the spirit, if
not the letter, of the anti-lottery law.
Inasmuch as about $110,000,000 will he expended upon River
and Harbor improvements, under contracts previously made, dur
the next fiscal year there is quite a strong feeling iu Congress iu
favor of omitting the usual River and harbor appropriation bill at
this session. No agreement to that effect has actually been made,
but it will not be surprising should that be the result of the ex
changes of opinion on the subject uow going on.
