Death of Edward H. Hill.
The news of the death of of Ed
ward H. Hill, which occured at his
home in this city last Friday even
ing, November 30th, at' half-past
eleven o'clock, came as a great sur
prise to his many friends, for it was
generally believed by all that he
was slowly regaining his usual
health.
Mr. Hill was born in England in
the year 1850, coming to Iowa when
but a year old with his parents, his
mother dying on the voyage across
the ocean. He has always resided
in and around Edgewood. On
March 7, 1875, he was married to
Miss Emma Gibson who died a few
years later. Two children were born
to them but only one is now living.
In 1890 Mr. Hill was again married
this time to Mrs. Francis Wheeler,
whose death occured August 24,
190C. Only one child, Frank, was
born to this union and he with his
half-sister, Verda, are the only rela
tives of the deceased left to mourn
his death.—Edgewood Journal.
BUYS COLLEGE BUILDING.
Prof. R. E. Eklond, of the 0. B.
Buys Iowa Normal College Build
ing, Pays $10,000.
Perseverance and backbone win
out every time.
This may be said of Prof. Eck
lund, of the Oelwein Business Uni
versity. During the past few days
Prof. R. E. Ecklund purchased
from Messrs. Wochteland Wing the
brick building in the northeast part
of town known as the "Iowa Nor
mal College," which for a time has
been occupied by families.
Realizing that his present quar
ters were not large enough for his
increasing business, Mr. Ecklund
commenced to look about him for a
large place, dreading the thoughts
of his being compelled to remove to
another place for larger facilities.
He was pondering over the matter
when it was suggested to him that
this building was what he wanted,
as the interior suited in nearly ev
ery particular to his business, and
after due thought he concluded to
purchase it.
For the past few months Mr. Eck
lund was cognizant of the fact that
the fame of his school of commercial
training was not confined to Fayette
and adjoining counties as his judi
cious advertising as well as the
thoroughness of his educational
principles was winning him fame.
Realizing the things that had been
done also that what can be done
once can be duplicated. With a de
termination to enlarge, also to place
Oelwein before the world as an edu
cational center as well as a railroad
town, he made the venture, pur
chased the building and with this
resolve he has branched out into the
world on a larger and a more pre
tentious scale.
The enrollment of students at the
0. O. U., this season is phenominal.
The membership has gone beyond
the century mark in numbers and
still there are those who are receiv
ing literature from his hands with a
view of adding their names to the
roster.
There are many of Mr. Ecklund's
students holding responsible and
lucrative positions with large busi
ness houses in Chicago and other
large cities, carrying with them the
fundamental principles of business
life from the 0. B. U.
He has also added another course
to his school of learning, which is
known as a "Farmers' Business
Course," that will enable the farm
er to keep accurate accounts of all
his industries of farm, and the
prospects are that there will be a
larger attendance during the win'
ter months.'
Mr. Ecklund will proceed at once
to make the necessary improvements,
and expects to occupy his new home
by Jan. 1, 1907.
The purchase ot this building by
Mr. Ecklund tells a good story for
the 0. B. U. It puts this institu
tion upon a firm and sound basis.
It shows it to be stable and success
ful. It shows further that the Oel
wein Business University is a fix
ture.
Mr. Ecklund may expect greater
success henceforth.—Oelwein Daily

Ex-United
States Senator Prob­
ably Dying from Wounds
Inflicted by a Woman.
JUST 'ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE'
But Choi* to Kill the Han Rather
Than Die Herself.
Goea to HI. Knbm In a Washington
Hotel, Demands Heparatton
and Is Refused—Shoot
liifc Follows.
Washington. Dec. 10. Ex-United
States Senator Arthur Brown, of Utah,
who was shot by Mrs. Anna M. Brad
ley, of Salt Lake City, in bis apart
ments at the Hotel Raleigh Saturday
afternoon, lies Hi a very critical condi
tion at the Emergency hospital. The
doctors announce that he lias a chance
of recovery, but his friends admit that
there has been a change for the worse
and think his recovery Is extremely
doubtful. There are symptoms of peri
tonitis. which the physicians fear may
lead to blood poisoning.- Brown has
not given out any statement since ho
went on the operating table at the
hospital, and the doctors will not per
mit any one to see him.
The "Mother of His Children."
Brown was shot by the woman aft
er an interview in his room. As ho
lay on the floor all he satd was—indi
cating the woman—"She shot me."
When the proprietor of the hotel was
doing what he could for Brown she re
mained in the room, but did nothing to
help. Finally Talty, the hotel proprie
tor. ordered her to leave the room. She
declined with absolute coolness to com
ply with the order. "I will remain
here," said she, "I am the mother of
ills two children." That tells the whole
story. Another case of a "woman who
loyed not wisely but too well."
Wouldn't "Do the Right Thing."
"I asked him if he was going to do
the right thing by me," she said later,
maintaining remarkable composure.
"His reply was that he put on his
overcoat and started to leave the room
and 1 shot him. I abhor acts of this
character, but in this case it was.fully
Justified." While expressing no sor
row for her act she declared that she
was glad to know that Senator Brown
might recover. "I was practically pen
uiless when I got here today," she
said, "having only $1.25, and after pay
ing the cabman all the money 1 had
iu the world was $1."
Wanted To Be His Wire.
She said she urged Senator Brown
to marry her that he had been instru
mental in the divorce between her hus
band and herself, and that as his wife
was dead he now could "do the right
thing" by her. This she said he posi
tively refused to do.
SYMPATHY WITH THE WOMAN
OfWra of Money for Defense and Her
Meals Free.
Mrs. Bradley was hysterical all day.
She made frequeut Inquiries as to the
condition of her victim. Her attorneys
say she is on the verge of a collapse.
According to the police several west
em politicians have notified her that
they are willing to furnish money for
her defense. Several local restaurants
telephoned the matron at the house of
detention that they would gladly serve
Airs. Bradley's meals free of cost. A
representative of the Salvation Army
also offered assistance.
There Is no doubt of the adulterous
connection of thejwo. Telegrams from
Salt Lake City confirm the woman's
story in that respect. They were both
arrested three years ago for immoral
conduct, on charges filed by Brown's
wife, who has since died. She, how
ever, withdrew her charge, although
Mrs. Bradley pleaded guilty. Brown
Is a native of Kalamazoo, Mich., and
left there for Utah thirty years ago.
His late wife was a Miss Cameron, of
Kalamazoo.
Mrs. Bradley's former husband has
remarried and Is living In Nevada with
his secoud wife. While Brown was
fighting for his life at the hospital,
three blocks away Mrs. BrAdley was
pacing the floor of the matron's room
In the police station anxiously inquir
ing every few minutes as to the con
dition of her victim. "I loved the
ground he walked on," she continu
ally remarked
PROCEEDINGS
IN CONGRESS
What the National Solons Are Doing
for the Good of the
Country.
Washington, Dec. G. President
lioosevelt's annual message to con
gress occupied the attention of the sen
ate for two and one-half hours. A
resolution was introduced by Kayner
declaring that the United States can
net interfere with San Francisco's
school regulations and resolutions re
garding deceased members of the house
were adopted. As a mark of further
respect adourjnmeut was taken.
The reading of the message con
sumed two hours and twenty-five min
utes in the house. Speaker Cannon
appointed Cousins of Iowa chairman
of the committee on foreign affairs to
succeed the' late Hobert Hitt, of Illi
nois, and Representative Lowden to a
place on the same committee to till
the vocaney caused by the death of
Hitt. No other business was trans
acted.
Washington, Dec. 0.—TMie brief ses
sion of the senate resulted in the In
troduction of many bills, resolutions,
petitions and memorials, which were
duly filed. Fornker's Insistence that
Immediate action be taken on the pend
ing resolutions for Information regard
ing the discharge of the negro soldiers
of the Twenly-flfth Infantry developed
discussion, but resulted in postponing
action.
The house began its legislative grind
by passlug three measures: Incor
porating tho National German
American Alliance authorising tho
secretary of the treasury to dup
licate gold certificates in lieu
of ones lost or destroyed, and
amending the national banking laws
so as to permit national banking asso
ciations to make loans on real estate

such loan*.

WAR DECLARED
ON THE SENATE
Campaign Hegtm to Give People the
Power to Choose Members of
the Upper House.
Pes Moines, In., Dec. S.—A de
termined campaign to force congress
to call a constitutional convention was
launched by the interstate senatorial
amendment conference. The move
ment for the popular election of Uni
ted States senators now Is well under
way, and the light will be carried on
In every part of the country.
The convention made known its at
titude in a manner which left no doubt
that the delegates were convinced the
support of the senate could uot be en
listed. The resolutions adopted say
that while, in tin* opinion of the dele
gates, there is a well-grounded demand
for the popular election of senators,
the senate has refused persistently to
assent to the proposition to submit tho
matter to the states to pass upon.
Little hope is seen of any change of
heart on the part, of the upper branch
of congress, ami the contention ac
cordingly adopted the alternative of
carrying the battle Into each state, In
the attempt to induce the required pro
portion of states to join in a call for
a constitutional convention.

substitutes.—Anders & Phillips.
