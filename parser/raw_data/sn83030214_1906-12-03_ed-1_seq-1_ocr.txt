Count if Committee. May Break, with
Executive Body.
Timothy F. Driscoll was elected the chairman
ef the county committee of the Independence
League at a long session of the league held yes
terday at the Dolando Club, at 88th street and
Park avenue. This action is taken to mean that
the county committee has broken away from
th* executive committee and has thrown down
the gauntlet to the executive committee, with
Max F. Ihmsen a* its head. Besides this action.
the county committee has filed with the Board
of Ejections the rules and regulations of the
esunlttee as a party organization.
There was a special meeting of the county
committee held at the Gilsey House on Novem
ber 21- A' this meeting Charles E. Gehrlng was
elected chairman, In place of Mr. Driacoll. The
latter and his friends in the county committee
resented the turning down of Mr. DrißColl. A
meeting 'of the county committee was held last
Thursday night, but after being In session until
long after midnight It adjourned without de
ciding on anything except to meet again yes
terday.
Utter the meeting was called yesterday a
motion was made, that the action of the county
committee at a meeting held at \he Gilsey House
on November 21, at which Mr. Gehring was
e'ected chairman, be reconsidered, and the mo
tion prevailed by a substantial majority. This
Tea, followed by a motion to make Mr. Driscoll
chairman. The motion was carried without any
opposition, and Mr. Driscoll took the chair as
chairman and president. of the County General.
Ctaunittee of the Independence league.
The other officers elected were Assemblyman
Thomas F. Lorn:, vice-president, and Charles M.
Berbenbach treasurer. Daniel A. Golden acted
as sicretarr. and will probably be elected to
that office at the next meeting of the committee.

Aft«r the meeting Mr. Driscoll was askea if
the e.,c.,0. taken meant a break with the execu

will acquiesce. We have taken our action, ana

KILLED IX P. R. R. TUNNEL.
Huge Rock Falls, Crushing Two

One man was killed and another injured so
that he died later whep a stone weighing several
tons crashed down on them in the gloom of
the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel at Second
avenue and 32d street early yesterday morning.

of No. 130 Kant 134 th street.
TOBIN" Rob«rt, *8. Third avenue and 47th street, rock
driller.
A number of rock drillers and a dozen Negro
laborers were at work in the tunnel at the spot
where the fatality occurred. Working alongside
of Green were his two brothers, Joseph and
James. When the mass came crashing down
there, was a wild scramble for safety. Tobin was
working directly in its path, as were Green and
his brothers. Green gave a warning bhout, but
before Tobin could get off his seat on the steel
driller the rock was upon him and be was
crushed beneath it. Over the rock rolled, bear
ing down upon Green, who had fallen amonw
some broken stone on the floor of the tunnel,
and before he could arise his life was
crushed out. Tobln was so badly injured that
he lived only a few hours after being admitted
to Bellevue Hospital.
Green's brothers and fellow workers barely
escaped. Several other rock drillers also had
narrow escapes. ... ■ • -
An investigation. by the police established the
fact that the accident, was due to a shoring
beam being removed from a spot near the
huge rock.
An accidont similar to .this happened in tn*
subway on Juns 17. 1902, at a point near oOth
street. Ira A. Bhaler. the contractor of that sec
tion, with several officials of the. road, was mak
ing a trip of inspection, when suddenly, without
the slightest warning, a huge pieca of rock,
weighing- between five and si* hundrsl pounds,
came hurtling down and struck Mr. Shaler on
the head. He died from the effects of thi3 in
jury on June 21>, 1902.
The only possible explanation for the rock's
falling lay in the fact that there had been blast
ing 1 a short time before it fell.
HELD UP IN THE STREET.
Man Knocked Dorm and Robbed of
Diamond Ring.
While in front of the building at So 31
Gramercy Park early yesterday morning, Alex
ander Ifclanis, of No. 343 West 14th street.
was knocked down by two men and robbed of a
diamond ring, valued at $200. While the men
were going through bis pockets Patrolmen
Bhevlin and Canavan, of th» East 22d street
station, appeared, and after a chase arrested
Joseph Kane, of N«. 221 East Uth street. He
was arraigned later in the Yorkville police court
and held for further examination. Mr. Mcln
nis is a member of the firm of Mclnnls & Ag
obw. fruit dealers, of No. 41 Ninth avenue.
According to the police, at the time of the ar
rival of Shevlin and Caravan the two men
were bending- over Mclnnls as he lay uncon
scious on the sidewalk. When they saw the po
licemen they ran toward Third avenue. The. po
lice allege that Kar.o threw away the ring during
the chase.
An ambulance was summoned from Bellevue,
and Dr. Phillips took Mclnnis to the hospital,
wh-re it was at first thought that h<- was suf

discharged from the hospital later.

CHESS PLAYER IN TOILS
HELD AS A FUGITIVE.
Naurtn Jasnogrodiky in Trouble
Over Money Borrowed to Wed.
Naum Jasnogrodsky. the Polish chess player v
who said he numbered District Attorney Jerome
among his pupils and friends, was s^nt to the
Tombs yesterday by Magistrate Whitman with
out bail on a charge of being a fugitive from
justice. Superintendent of Police M. W. Murphy
of Bay City, Mich., and J. Orr Brakie, the Dis
trict Attorney of Bay County, that Btate, ap
peared against him. They charged that he got
$10,000 from M. Simplier. of Bay City, in April
last, to cover Ills wedding expenses.
Samuel Koenig appeared for Jasnogrodsky and
asked that he he admitted to bail. The District
Attorney of Bay County objected, whereupon
Jasnogrodskv began a long speech, giving hi.s
reasons why he should not be sent to the Tombs.
The District Attorney said there were six or
seven other complaints against him and that
there were no grand juries or indictments in his
county, but that the "information" had been
made against the prisoner, which was equivalent
to an indictment In New York.
The magistrate then ordered Jasnogrodsky to
the Tombs for forty-eight hours. He remarked
that bin ac.quaiiita.nce tvitli Jerome ought to save
him from the dlegiace of the Tombs. .Tas).'^
grodeky is a big, well dressed man and had a
generous supply of diamonds. He was arrested
Saturday night at No. 6S West 117 th street.
In speaking about himself he said he had been
a general agent of the Mutual l^ife Insurance
Company in Canada and had been so successful
that h« was authorized to write up "high poli
cies." As a chess player he said he bad taught
sume of "the leaders of the social world."
Jasnog.-odsky said that the transaction on
which thA "information" was issued was a per*
Bonal on/> of the type known in commercial cir
cles as an "exchange of notes." IJe admitted
:he transaction named, but declared that the
payment had been held upon account <<T a di«=
pute over the interest payments.
"] am financially abl- and responsible, and I
.im ab> to meet my obligations," he told the
magistrate. "This transaction waa one In which
I gave a note in exchange for a check.
"I wan about to be married to the daughter of
;i prominent and wealthy rabbi of Hay City, and
I needed h good deal of ready money to pay thft
weddliiSt expenses. I am accustomed to dealing
In big amounts, and I write big insurance pol
icies, running well up into the thousands. I can
g«< any amount of bail that Is needed within a
short tim^ if 1 <'<w be- admitted to bail."
When seen Inter in bis ceil In the Tombs
Jasnogrodsky talked freely about his case. H6
said the wedding look place in April at the
Frazler Hotel, in Bay City, and that his wife
■was a daughter of Rabbi Landau, deceased.
His wife was wealthy, be said, but he would not
allow her to pay Ins debts.
■■1 have often drawn a?t much as $12,'»O0 in
advance yearly from tha Mutual Ufe," he said
"I am not a rich man now— in fact, T was broke
up to six weeks ago, my period of financial em
barrassment extending over five months. When
the Insurance investigation began I found that,
although I am on« of the b«st insurance solici
tors- In the world. 1 could not make my living at
the business.
"During the last six weeks 1 have been sellin?
mining stocks for a welJ known house In Wall
Stre»t, and have been making S4OO and $500 a
week. In that time 1 have paid a. couple of
thousand dollars toward my debts."
Jasnosrodsky said that he got his present job
through a letter from W. N. Aniory. He ad
mitted owing a bill of $180 to the Frailer Hotel
for cab hire, flowers and wine. This was con
tracted, he said, a* th > time of his wedding. He
left a trunk containing clothes, he said, valued
at more than $500.
Mutual Life offic!n!= said last nlghi that Jas
nogrodsky had never been thi company's gen
eral agent in Canada All ih&l tbey recalled of
him was that about three years ago K. F.. Keefe.
the Mutual Life's Boston manager, employed
him for six month* on a commission basis.
They next heard of him in WOS, when F. O.
Paige, the company's Detroit manager, engaged
him In the miiip capacity for a few months.
F.arly this year Jasnogrodsky visited th* com
pany's headquarters, si No. 32 Nassau street,
and sought employment. This the company re
fused. Some of the officials taid thai he had
the reputation of being a "champion chess
player." and obtained a certain percentage or
hla business as the repult of jiis chess bouts at
■small German clubs.

Wos"Bir T DITCH" PEOPLE
PRESIDENT IVELL LIKED.
Theodore P. Shnnte Say* lie Took
"Little Republic" by Storm.
That President Roosevelt won the hearts of
the people of the Panama Republic by his demo
cratic spirit and straight-from-the-shoulder
talk, and that the "big ditch" was being dug:
without any trouble among the employes, was
the declaration of Theodore P. Shonts, chairman
of the Canal Commission, who returned yester
day to this country on the steamship Colon, el
the Panama I,ln<*. Mr. Shonts was accompanied
by Richard F. Rogers, genera! counsel; Admiral
Kndicott. Ma.ior Phillips and C. P. Rlpley. all
members of the commission. Mr. Shonts de
clared he was never more gratified with the
progress of the work on the canal than at pres
ent, and that the President's visit had given not
only impetus to the work, but made the atti
tude of the United States toward the little re
public, more clearly understood. The laboring
element, especially, was glad to see the Presi
dent, he said.
"President ItoosßTOlt simply took the p^opte
of the little republic by storm." he said. 'The
setting aside by the President, of all precedents
to visit Panama won him the. respect and ad
miration of all Interested. Mr. Roosevelt, wi*
familiar with the work from a theoretical
standpoint prior to his visit, but during his brief
stay he paw and inspected what was being done
and learned more than the average man could in
many months.
"The building of the Panama Canal Is to the
I'resldent as the building of a future home would
h» 10 any other man. He looks upon it as his
own personal work. Now tha.t he has st«en all
for himself, nobody can mislead him about con*
ditlons or about the efforts being made to carry
out the work.''
Mr. Bhonta th«r. tiki a little Incident that oc
curred while the President was down there. It
appears that th« citizen* of the republic have
been keeping themselves popted on the criticisms
pro and con of the work. They were all familiar
with the Poult ney P.lgelow story.
"One of the leading citizens." Mr. Shouts said,
"in a brief talk With the President, asked him
whai ho thought now of the criticisms of Poult
ney BifiStoW, whereupon the President replied
quietly:
" 'Small people, like small file?, despoil large
] things and large enterprise?.'
"II was the President's speech at Colon, how
! ever, that won the, hearts of the canal workers.
| A lasting Impression was made when, in the
i course of his speech, the President declared:
. " 'The men who are now working on the canal
and the citizens of Panama who are assisting
them will go down to posterity like the veterans
of the Civil War. When this great work is com
pleted the men who have been instrumental in
its success will look backward and say, "I was
part of it," as do the veterans of the Civil War
on looking back to those tragic days'
"This did more to endear the President to
Panama than any other one thing. They speak
of it at their work, at play and in their homes.'*
Speaking- about ' the work itself, Mr. Bhonta
declared that It. was going on satisfactorily,
everybody working every day, no labor troubles
, and everybody content. Mr. Shunts went to
Washington last night. lie will be present at
the reading of the President's message to Con
gress.

Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 2. — Yale was hanged in
effigy in the Harvard yard this morning by
some unknown person, and to-night trouble
seetna..to be brewing. for the person if he : is dis
covered. _A~ life, sized figure, completely "dressed,
with a small Yale flag fastened to the right
hand, was found this morning swinging over
Wadsworth House, hanged by the neck to a wire
