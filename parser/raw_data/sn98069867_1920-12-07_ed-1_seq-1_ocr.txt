SON'S BLOOD SAYES
HIS FATHER'S LIFE
T. P, Fortune Resting Well at
Hospital.
' As a 'result of the transfusion of a

T. P. Fortune, president of the Fortune-Ward
Drug company, the lat
ter, is .now. resting well after a deli
cate, but successful, stomach opera
tion at Gartly-Ramsay hospital Mon
day. v v
An internal hemorrhage,- the con
sequence of weeks of stomach trou
ble, necessitated the operation, which
physicians at the hospital declare
would have proved fatal had not the
son's sacrifice been made. The ad-,
vance" age of the father, who is 72
years old, made the operation doubly
Nourishment of the aged patient
was only accomplished by the injec
tion of stimulants through the mem
braneous stomach Walls. The son
consented to .the transfusion Friday,
and the richness of his blood mado
possible the sufficient recuperation
fo his father to undergo the operation
late Monday.
It was found In the course of the"
operation that an unusually large
abscess, probably the biggest ever re
corded in medical history, had made
a two-inch perforation through the
stomach wall. Attending physicians'
stated that such a perforation rarely
exceeded half an inch in width.
The son felt no ill effects from the
operation, and wan able to be up and
around within a few hours after the
transfusion.

FEIN PEACE
by William l. mallabar,
(International News 8ervice Cor
respondent) LONDON, Dec. 7. Sinn Fein peace
terms, as revealed today by the Daily
Graphic, are. at wide variance with
the proposals contained In the home
rule bill now being debated' In the
house of lords. According to this
newspaper they provide or a single
Irish parliament Instead of a dual
parliament as set forth in the. home
rule bill. Sinn Fein lnsistsupon the
right to establish Its own mtlltla
and police fdrce, but does not wish
an Irish navy. Furthermore the
Sinn Fein ask for fiscal autonomy
and the power to negotiate commer
cial treaties on the principle of
Irish independence.
It is reported that a, .Sinn Fein
envoy has been 'in London for ' five
weeks to consult with republican
leaders. ,
Sir Horace Plunkett, famous Irish
leader, who will sail for New York
Voniorrow on the liner t Baltic, does
not 1-elievo that the peace proceed
ings will be successful. Sir Horace
is one . of the originators of the
movement for a dominion form of
government in Ireland. Discussing
th? Irish outlook today, he said:
"i0 any peace proposals have been
made and considered they came from
the pacifist side and arenot rec
ognized by leaders of the republican
movement. The government Insti
tuted a terrorist campaign but it
failed. Now the government is at
tempting to work through economic
p-.-essu.-e. but tills will fall also. There
s no tangilile prospect for a trucks.
Tne whole thing amounts to this: .
"The government has a pious hope
that, nrooosais for1 peace will be re-
rndiiited by the party which is de
manding freedom for Ireland."
Sir Horace denied that Irish mat
ters are concerned in nis Ainrnnui
visit. He said he was going to the
United States for a rest. Timothy
Honly telegraphed the Dally Express
advocating action by King 'George to
end Irish hostilities. Ilealy said he
thought the king should be advised
to exercise his prerogative "to sum
mon a parliament In Ireland" pend-
irv the negotiations for a truce. ThevJ
obji-ct of such a meeting would be

CUT ACREAGE 50
PERJM; GROW
Col. W. P. Thompson, of New
Orleans, Says South in
Earnest Warns World to
Prepare for Short, Crop.
A reduction of at least 50 ner cent
in the cotton acreage in .1921 and a
crop of not more than 6,000,000 bales
was predicted by W. P. Thompson,
of New Orleans, former president of
the New Orleans . cotton . exchange.
in his address Tuesday before the
cotton conference here.
"The , South-Is determined to re
duce the cotton acreage in 1921 to
at least one-half of that ot last
year," Col. Thompson said. "This
will mean that the coming crop will
be reduced to 6,000,000 bales or less.
The convention here Is called for the
purpose of solidifying this determi
nation and serving notice on the
world that the cotton producing
South will no 'longer permfl its chief
agricultural asset to . be slaughtered
and lift producers Impoverished by
uny combination of circumstances or
interests whatsoever, . ,
After outlining the course of the
mkrket In recent months, '. Col.
Thompson continued: "This reduc
tion movement has been made neces
sary by t the appalling decline, in
prices, due, we are told by apologists
for the ruthless deflation campaign,
to over-production.
Heavy Price Decline.
In spite of the fact that in the
spring the farmers were urged and
encouraged by the financial author
ities at Washington to produce all
the cotton possible we are, after the
price has declined to flgusfa which
represent less than one-half actual
cost of production, told that we have
produced too much and must stand
the consequences' of , such over
production. "The answer to this is," Cel.
Thorn psonsald, "that we will hold
tight to every ,b1e of the so-called
surplus, and - that we wilt reduce
thenext crop to proportions which
will stagger those who would re
duce the cotton producer to a con
dition of destitution.
"The hankers, ft merchants and
farmers of this section understand
the situation and its remedy per
fectly. Even If the farmers were
able and willing to plant a full acre
age, the bankers and merchants will
not supply the necessary means.
This Is not a matter of mere reso
lution by farmers to reduce acre
age, but an issue of vital necessity
for which the whole financial South
is taktng up its arms.

a five or six million bale crop in

"GAN NOT REFUSE
ROLE OF CHAMPION
TO WEAK NATIONS"
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Presi
dent Wilson's annual message . to
congress today follows:
When" I addressed myself to per-,
forming thi duty laid upon the
president by the constitution to pre
sent to you an annual report on the
state of the union I found my
thought dominated by an Immortal
sentence of Abraham Lincoln:
"Let us have ' faith that right
makes might, and in that faith let;
us dSrs to do our duty as we under
stand it."
A sentence Immortal because It
embodies In a form - of" utter sim
plicity and purity the essential faith
of the nation, the faith In which It
was conceived and the faith In which
it has grown to glory and - power.
With that faith and the birth of a
nation founded upon It. came, the
hope Into the world that a new or
der would prevail throughout the af
fairs of mankind, an order In which
reason and right would take pre
cedence of covetousness and force,
ami I believe that I express the wish
and purpose of every thoughtful
American when I sy that this sen
tence marks for us In the plainest
manner the part we should play
alike In the arrangement of our, do
mestic affairs and in our exercise of
influence upon the affairs of . the
world. By this faith, and by this
faith alone, can the world be lifted
out of Its present confusion and de
spair. It was thls4alth which pre
vailed over the wicked force of Ger-
WarEnded ljy Taith.
:You will remember that the be
ginning of the end of the war came
when the Germany people found
themselves face ti face with the
conscience ot the world and realized
that rlgt was everywhere, arrayed
against the wrong thai their ' gov
ernment wag attempting" to: per
petrate. I think, therefor, that it la
true to say -that this was the faith
which won the war. Certainly this
Is tht faith with which our gallant
men went Into te field and out upon
the sea to make sure of victory.
This li the mission upon . which
democracy 'came ' into the. world.
Democracy is an assertion , of 1 the
right of the individual to Mve.and to
be treated justly as against any
attempt on the part or any combi
nation of individuals to make laws
which will overburden him or which
will-destroy his equality among his
fellows in the matter ot right or
prlvtlege.Vand I think we all realize
that the day has come when democ
racy, is being put upon its final test
The old world is just now suffering
from, a wanton rejection of the prin
ciple 'of democracy and a substitu
tion of the principle of autocracy as
asserted in the name but without the
authority and sanction of the multi
tude. . This is the time of all others
when ; democracy should prove Its
purity and Its spiritual power to pre
vail. It Is surely the manifest des
tiny of the United States to lead in
the attempt to make this spirit pre
vail. There are two ways In which the
United. States can assist to ac
complish this great oble.-t; first, ly
offering the example w'tliln her own
borders of the. will and power of de
mocracy to make and enforce laws
which are unquestionably just and
wMch are equal In their administra
tions laws which secure its
full right to labor and ynt nt th
same time safeguard tli Integrity of
pronerty, and particularly nf that
property which is devoted to the de
velopment of industry and the in
crease of the necessary wealth of
the world. Second, by standing for

Can Goodfellows Give Me
Sleeping Doll?'9 Asks Opal
BY M GOODFELLOW.
Down In MissisHippl there Is a lit
tle girl named Opal, who wants a
sleeping doll for Christmas. Her
letter reached my riHk thlH morning
In it is expressed every confidence
that the Croodfellows-Ranta Claus
club will remember her this Christ
mass. The letter Is one that con
tains such an appeal that only by
quoting it can the real message be
conveyed to my reaners. Here u is:
Deartloodfellows I am "a little
orphan girl seven years old. I didn't
have a Christmas last year. My dad
dy had Just died. I want a sleeping
doll and a new dress for this year. I
haven't had a dH of any sort for
some time. Can't the tJoodfellows
send mo one? I know they won't
forget. Thanking you. OPAU'
Now,' Ooodfellows, how can you
overlook that plea from a little moth-
r who wants a dollie who goes to
letp. And that new dress. Tho kid
die savs she is sure you won't for
get. And I am pretty certain myself
that the Santa Claus club .will re
member Opal.
That is Just one of the letters which
are virtually pourlni? into my office.
The past few days have doubled the
mall which the Goodfellow postman
brings to my desk each morning.
They are pleas for coal, for food and
for the things which bring Christmas
cheer.
Tuesday our total reached $4,722.11,
which Is quite a step from Monday.
Its government into existence and
established it in the face of almost
universal opposition and intrigue,
even in the face of wanton force, as
for ekampln, against the orders. in
council of Great Britain and tho ar
bitrary Napoleonic decrees which in
volved us in what we know as the
War of 1811. I urge you to consider
that the display of an immediate dis
position, on the part of the congress
to remody any Injustices or evils
that may have shown themselves in
our own national life will afford the
most effectual offset to the forces of
chaos and tyranny which are play
ing so disastrous a part In the for
tunes of . the free peoples ot mors
than one rjurt. of the . world. The
United 8tate is of necessity the
sample democracy of tha world, and
the triumph of democracy depends
upon its success. f
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effecta-of the
late war has been exceedingly slow
on the other side of the water and
hasgiven promise, I ventnre to say
of early completion bnly ttr our own
fortunate country; but even with us
the recovery halts and is impeded at
times and there are immediately ser
viceable acts ot legislation, which it
seems to pie we ougift to attempt to
assist that recovery and prove the
indestructible recuperative force of
a great government of the people.
One of these Is to prove that a great
democracy can keep house an suc
cessfully and in as businesslike a
fashion as any other government It
seems to me that the first step to
ward proving this is to supply our
selves with a systematic method ot
handling our estimates and expendi
tures and bringing thsm to the point
where they will not be an unneces
sary strain upon our income or
necessitate unreasonable taxation, in
other words, a worknhlu ludget sys
tem, and I respectfully suggest that
two elements are . este ntlal to such
a tystem; namely, no: only that the
proposal of appropriations should he

I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill
passed by the last session of the con
gress, because of a constitutional ob
jection. . The house of representa
tives subsequently modified the bill
In order to meet this1 objection. In
the revised form I believe that the
bill, coupled with action already tak
en by the congress to revise its rules
and procedure, furnishes the founda
tions for an effective- national budget
system. . I earnestly hope, therefore,
that one ot the first steps taken by
the present session of the congress
will be to pass the budget bill.
The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the past
year. The total ordinary receipts of
S6.694.0O0.OO0 for the fiscal year 1920.
exceeded those for 191-9 by $l,R42.00O,-
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from 118,514,
000.000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross
public debt, which reached its high
est point on Aug. 8k 019, when it
was 126,596,00,000, hiNi dropped on
Nov. 30 1920. to $24,175,000,000. There
has also been a marked decrease in
holdings of government war -securities
by the banking Institutions of
the country, as well as in the amount
of bills held by the federal reserve
bartks secured by government war
securities by the banking institu
tions of the country, as well as In,
the amount of bills held by the fed
eral reserve banks secured by gov
ernment war obligations. This for
tunate result has relieved the banks
and left them freer to finance the
needs of agriculture, industry and
commerce. It has been due In large
part to the reduction of the public
debt, especially of the floating debt,
but more particularly to the im
proved distribution of government se-
