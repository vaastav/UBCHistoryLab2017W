The Pension Enormity.
It became customary to impugn tbe
patriotism of those who objected to
making the pension system a means
wSfrf 8wiodling the government If
. anyone objected to swelling the pen
?iou Hst by admitting unworthy clai?
mants to the bounty of the gov-i
einmenta clamor was raised against'
bim as being no better than a rebel j
111'; As a consequence the pension
. manipulators hare been allowed to
bave their own way Honest ob
jectioo to their proceedings has beeu
stifled by a mistaken idea of patriot?
ism, and the result bas been that the
. American pension system has been
perverted into ihe most gigantic
fraud that was ever practiced upon
a nation. It bas become so great an
abuse that the want of patriotism may
be charged against those ?bo refrain
from representing it in ita .true color
. and denouncing it accordingly. From
no other evil is tbe republic - sustain j
tog so great an injury as from the
J fraudulent perversion of a system
thal was intended for tbe benefit of
those wbp fought lor tbe Union, f
There ls really 6 omet hing startling
in the information given in the eecre
' tary of the interior's report that,
with the , pension rolls already con?
taining more names than were enroll- ?
ed as soldiers during the war, there
are 290,000 claims awaiting adjodi
cation, a majority of which the seer?
tary soya will be admitted, with an
increase of $5,000,000 to $7 ,000,000
to the pension account ; and this, it
should be remembered, will happen
after more than- thirty years have
. passed since the close of the war.
It is not difficult to understand the
processes by which the pension rolla
. are made to contain, as reported at ;
the end of the last fiscal year, 976.
014: names with material in reserve
sufficient to add thousands to the Hst,
; annually, for au indefinite period
This frightful abuse which last]
year was-attended with the enormous
expense of $141,990,936 75. not io
eluding the cost of the service, has
been practiced for two special objects,
either of which is a pnblic imposi?
tion and a menace to our free inet i to
tiona The one object is to attach to
a particular, political party a large
body of voters who are made to look
to it as the source of this personal
benefit, which is in effect a gigantic
.method of political, bribery. Another
object is to create a vast expenditure
of public money that wiil necessitate
the continuance of taxation through
: the. agency of tariffs required for the
promotion of monopolistic inteiresi.
The pension system has been
brought to a degree of perversion that
randers it a public duty to denounce
the abuses connected with rt. and to
expose the purpose of those who have
' made it the medium of their nefarious
designs. Instead of its being what it
waa originally intended to be, a means
of justly compensating those who bad
rendered their country real service
in ita time of peril, it has been con
verted into a colossal scheme of pub i
He plunder Tor the political benefit of
the Republican party and the per?
sonal profit of the pension ring
The rascals who have profited from j
pension abases are sure to represent
opposition to their methods as spring?
ing from hostility to pensiona, but
tte true friends of the pension system
are those who desire to keep off the
rolls those who are not entitled to
government bounty, and confine it
to veterans who really served their
couorry io the field.-Democratic

3oomerang Effects.
?be cotton mau??a?ture of New Eng
land is not io prosper?os condition
lt suffered a slump ?hen thc bowness
depression strack the country in 1893.
bot its trouble at that time was con?
veniently charged to the Wilson lew
tariff, which was rather a singular
cause for a break down that came on a
year before that tariff bill was passed
It was expected, however, that after
the higher duties of the Dingley hil!
should begin to show their effect the
New England cotton msoofsctarers,
whose claim to increased protection was
well looked after in that measure, would
fiod a great improvement io their busi?
ness This expectation is not being
realised, although the Diogley sot bas
been io full play for nearly four
months.
As a remedy for this defective situa?
tion, whioh tb" high tariff has failed to
eorrect, a general cot in wages is re?
commended as the only expedient that
will maintain the profits of the mill
owners. Following closely opoo the
passage of a tariff bill avowedly intend?
ed to benefit labor this would he a most
remarkable result of an alleged protec?
tive measure.
Bot the great trouble with the New
England oottoa mills is overproduction.
They aro producing more goods than
they oao find markets for. Uoder the
lower Wilson bill trade conditions were
soch that foreign markets took a con?
siderable part of this New England
prodoet. lo 1896 nearly 20,000.000
yards of these cotton goods were sent
to Canada, which, io 1897. were in?
creased to 30,000,000 yards, bot the
discrimination of the Dingley tariff
against Canadian producta has driv?e T
Canada to retaliatory measures, the ef
feet of which is shown hy the fact that the
Canadian importation of American cotton
goods, which ? io July, the mooth be?
fore the Diogley bill was passed,
amounted to $1,447,538, fell to $809,
86*5 io September, tbe mooth after that
measure went toto effect, a failing off of
nearly 50 per eeor.
The New Eogland mill owners are
experiencing some boomerang effects
from the tariff policy. Foreign mark?
ets, which were being opened to their
goods ander a lower tariff, are now
being closed against them, and with a
diminished demand for the oatput of
the mills they will endeavor to make
op their loss by ootting the wages of
their workmen.
Is this what was promised the labor?
ing people as the effect of a Repobli
can protection?-Democratic Watch?

Misconstrued Law.
The gold bog journals and speak?
ers have succeeded in creating the
impression that the credit of the gor
eminent is involved in gold payment,
and apon this false representation the
humbug bas boen worked off on the
public that payment in silver would
be a breach of faith and a violation
of the national honor.
Nothing bot the incorrect im pres
sion that the government is obligated
to make its payments in gold could
give rise to the report that among
other measures of currency reform
which the President will recommend
in his message will be one advising
"the passage of a law repealing the
act requiring greenbacks to be re
deemed in gold "
There could not be a more mislead
ing statement than this. It is based
on a thoroughly, false assumption.
There is no law requiring the pay?
ment of greenbacks in gold There
fore there is no occasion for a repeal
ing act. There is no law specifically
requiring the government to pay ob
ligations, whether notes or bonds, in
jgold. The law calls for their pay?
ment in coin, and as an unmistakable
interpretation of the meauing of the
term: .'coin*'in this connection Con?
gress has made a specific d eel ar at io D
that it means either gold or silver.
At any time when the speculative
cormorants were raiding the treasury
with the presentation of greenbacks
for payment in gold the treasury au?
thorities could have lawfully paid
them in silver.. There would have
been no breach of the public faith in
such payment, as the government was
not pledged to pay in gold.
Secretary Foster, under the Harri?
son administration, commenced this
unlawful system of exclusive gold
payment, even going so far as to de?
cide that treasury notes, specifically
payable in silver, should be paid in
gold if the bolder required it Cleve?
land betrayed bis Democratic faith
by continuing this unlawful system,
with the result that gold payments,
unauthorized by law, necessitated
tbe borrowing'of gold, and occasion
ed th? issue of bonds which imposed
upon the people an increase of the
national debt amounting to $262,
000,000
It was by the arbitrary ruting of
treasury officials that the law has
-been violated/ in this matter for the
benefit of the gold interest. This
bas been a breach of fbe national
faith pledged to the payment of the
public debts with the lawful coin of
I the country, silver equally with gold ;
and yet these violators of the law,
backed by the supporters of gold
monometallism, make the outrageous
ly impudent charge that the advo?
cates of silver entertain a terrible de
sign against the public faith, and na?
tional honor.-Democratic Watch

No Probability T?at the Pen?

Ooty twenty days remato :n which

says that money ia coming ic even
slower thao it did a week or two ago
aod that be is not getting enough to
p*y the current expenses of the govern?
ment.
There ia never any grsat alaority
displayed io payiog taxes, that duty

year the people are slower than ever
The explanation is five ceot. ootton, bat
it is pointed out by state officials that
if the people are not abie to pay their
taxes now they will oot be in any bet
ter shape later on
In view of the scarcity of money no
doubt many people believe that the
time will be extended. There is little
possibility of anything of the kind be
ing done, by the governor and the
comptroller general who have tbe pow?
er to do so. The legielatare might ex?
tend the time and remit the peoalty
where it bas beeo imposed, bot there
is a general disposition to have all
taxes paid wheo due. Only ander tbe

COLUMBIA'S PROFITS.
What is Said About the
Threat to Withhold.
The threat of the State board of
cootrol to withhold Columbia's share
of the profits was talked about con?
siderably yesterday Mayor Sloan de?
clined to have anything to say, for
ther than that the city officials were
doing ail they could to enforce the
law, and that he bad so instructed the
police.
A gentleman who hulda no public
position but who is interested in
everything that pertains to the good
of the city, in speaking of the mat?
ter, said that it wocld be impossible
for the police to stop blind tigers, so
long as the dispensary sold the deal?
ers liquor to dispense ont of the
pocket by the drink, behind doorways
and al ley s Even where it is sold io
buildings, it is a hard matter to de?
tect, for only small quantities are
kept on the premises, which if seized,
is immediately claimed as being for
private ose, and there is no way of
disputing the statement. No officer
would be allowed to detect the selling
of a drink. The tiger always keeps
one eye open.
As to the original package stores,
if they violate the law it is done in
such a way as to defy detection.
They may get in a case containing
four kegs, each holding a certain
quantity. The dealer, if he is so
disposed, can sell each of these jugs
to separate parties, which is contrary
to the order of Judge Simonton
The police could not possibly detect
anything of the kind unless he stay?
ed around the shops all the time, and
they have more important matters to
attend to than that.
As a matter of fact, the chief of
police has stopped several places
which be suspected of violating the
law, and if liquor is sold in them cou
trary to the law, it is done so secret?
ly that the dealers cannot be detect?
ed
That there are blind tigers in Co?
lumbia, nobody denies, but those in
official position and those who are
familiar with the facts, say that the
city ie no worse in this respect than
any other city, and in some cases, not
so bad.-Columbia Register. -

Washington Letter.
Washington Deo. 13.-The man who
woald have predicted the preseot condi?
tion of the Washington ead of the re?
publican party a little more than a year
ago, when it bad just elected a Presi?
dent and a majority of the House,
would not haye beeo giren credit for
sound judgment, even by the bitterest
eua my of that party Io fact, it is now
difficult for one not io Washington,
to believe the extent of thc disruption
of the party. Nothing cao better
illostrate this than the attitude of the
republicans in Congress towards the
recommendations made by Mr McKin?
ley's message. Not a single one of
them has the support of anywhere near
the solid republican vote io either
branch of Congress. Mr McKinley
asked indirectly, Seoretary Gage direct?
ly, for the retirement of the green?
backs, but if the democrats and popu?
list refrain from voting, it is doubtful
whether a bill providing therefor could
pass either braooh of Congress; Mr.
McKinley's Cuban policy is constantly
and openly assailed by republicans; be
asked for the immediate ratification of
the treaty for the annexation of Hawaii,
but not a move bas been made in that
direction in the Senate, and abandon?
ment of the treaty is looked for ; he
defended the civil service law, aod one
half of the republican members of the
House are openly engaged in an effort
to break down that law. In fact,
everything is tending towards a restora?
tion of the democratic party to power,
and the oooe boasted solidity of the
republican party, which was for years
its most ooted trait, has gone, apparent
ly forever.
The House Basking and Currency
Committee is laboring hard to produce a
financial bill, but it is only another
csse of "Much ado about nothing," as
there are about as many different opin?
ions in . the Committee as there are
members, and each opinion is represent?
ed by a bill framed by its owner. It
bas been said that Czar Reed, in select?
ing this Committee, chose men whom
he knew would never agree on a bill,
and it looks that way
Representative Sullivan, of Miss., in
bis speech against the payment of pen?
sions to wealthy men quoted extensive?
ly from Gen. H. V. ?oynton's recent
arraignment of the injustice of the
Pension laws as now administered, be?
cause be endorsed what that gentleman
had said and knew that nobody could
raise any question of Gen. Boynton's
right to criticise Althoogb the Pen?
sion bill passed by tbe House, carries
ao appropriation of more than $141,
000.000, something like $2 for each
man, woman and child in the US -
it was rushed through the House in an
hour or two aod every amendment pro?
posed by democrats waa voted down.
Representative Dingley's remark tbat
of every $5 paid oot by the govern
meat $2 went to pay pensions and fifty
cents to pay interest oo the public debt,
although probably not made for such a
purpose, ought, in view of tbe probable
pension deficit of $10,000.000 io tbe
next fiscal year, and the announced
desire of tbe administration to increase
our hooded indebtedness, to cause many
persons to put on their thinking cap?.
It is practically certain that at the
caucus of the democrats of the House,
to be held thi? week, it will be decided
to make Cuba a party question, and tn
use every opportunity to attempt to get
the Senate resolution, declaring for the
recognition of Coban belligerency,
adopted by the House ; also that the
caucus will declare the party opposed
to each aodevvery financial recommenda?
tion made by the administration It is
not likely that tbe caucus will say any?
thing about the Ml??r question. The
position of tbe party is too well known
tb need any new d?claration in favor of
tf?ver. The caucus will probably de
oUre against the annexation of Hawaii,
either by treaty or legislation, and it
may also declare against the enactment
of the bankruptcy law, but there is
doubt about the latter action, as there
are some strong advocates of the bank?
rupt law among the democrats, and
others who doubt the wiidom of trying
to make it a party question.
Tbe report that Czar Reed is in sym
patby with the fight on civil service re?
form, because be recognizes in it a
means of lessening Mr. McKinley's
chances for a renomination, was partial?
ly confirmed by the attendance at a
canons of republican Representatives
called to consider Vi ays and Means of
fighting the present civil service law,
and bring about its modifactioo or com
piete repeal In view ot tbe absolute
control Mr. Reed has over the re pu b 1 i
can members of tbe House in about
everything else, it does not seem likely
that as many as seventy two nf them
could have been persuaded te take part
in this movement unless they knew that
Mr. Reed had no objeotion to it The
averago democrat bas never favored tbe
civil servios law, with its one part real
reform to nine parts of the most a,rrant
humbuggery, so it will not be surpris?
ing to ace them vote with the kicking
republicans, if their kicking goes as
far ai a vote.
