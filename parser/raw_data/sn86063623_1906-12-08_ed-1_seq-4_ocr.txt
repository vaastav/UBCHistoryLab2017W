Tbe very first recommendation of

Tbe declsiou of tbe Missouri Su

the friends of race track: (rambling
This thing Is dead to Missouri. Two
years or the old 1 i was enough to
persuade the people of the corrupting
character of the race tracks main
tained by the aid of the law. Tbe
people tried it in good faith and
found it bad. And now tbey are not
going to have it. People, of course,
can bet on races just as much as they
ever could. Cut ser'es of million
dollar race tracks built and owned by
professional gamblers and operated
nearly the whole year for a criminal
profit which the state enabled them
to collect are things of tbe past.

problems in tbe state today is how

It is proposed in Oklahoma to

Kansas City is agitating the
question of requiring the saloons to

most trouble.
Ibe Christmas number of the
Century magazine contains a short
article by James J. Hill, president of
the Great Northern railway, in
advocacy of tbe establish aient in
every agricultural county in the
United States of a model farm of
forty acres, a local experiment
station, under the superintendeocy
of the highest scientific skill obtain
able. Mr. Hill says that this could
be done at the cost of a siDgle battle
Bbip and that it must result in greater
good than a whole navy. Mr. Hill
approves of the work of the depart
meot of agriculture but be believes
that tbe location of small stations in
every agricultural community would
briu niucrureauits and bring these
results more quickly. He believes
that the prejudice among farmers
atrainst agricultural experimentation
would be obviated by having these
demonstrations made locally Instead
of being roported in bulletins Issued
from distant stations.
One of the first bills introduced in
congress this we k was a graduated
income tax bill. The very first
thing Senator Penrose resolution
requesting the president to give
congress full information as to the
discharge of three negro companies of
infantry.
The president unbosomed himself
to congress on tbe subjects of indus
trial education, dl voro, child bearing,
lynching and several other matters of
much interest wholly out of the
province of the federal government
under the constitution.
The next legislature promises to be
a reform legislature, and no more
important reform could engage tbe
attentions of that body tban such
modification of tbe rules of criminal
practice as would insure speedy trials,
especially in the case of the graver
classes of felonies. There Is no
greater Bhame on civilization in
America tban the law's delay.
A resolution has been Introduced
in tbe Oklahoma constitutional con
vention favoring state ownership ot

But the Roman government derived

property as Btate monopolies.
The State Board of Charities and
Corrections at a meeting in Jefferson

said to favor the abolition of the
death penalty and the Increase of the
governor's power to remove county

The president's message to congress
this year is the most sermon ic of bis
Btr.te papers. Nearly all of it appears
to be addressed to the public rather
tban to congress. The admirers of
the president will find leasoa for this
in the alleged fact that Mr. j
Roosevelt feels himself to be thej
leader and champion ot tbe people
battling for their cause against a
reluctant congress. He speaks to his
constituents over congress' head,
with what purpose, in some instances,
it Is bard to understand, since no
legislation is either recommended or
coniempiatea. uis remarks on
lynching, on capital and labor, on
corporations, on divorce, and on
several other subjects are to be taken
as lay oci Uiuiio. He bad some Ideas
which he wanted to get before the
country and he to k this occasion to
reach the people But not all of the
message is of this character. The
president makes some very specific
and very important recommendations
to the legislators. One of these Is to
give the government the right
of appeal in criminal cases. Another
Is shorter hours for railroad
employees. Another is the with
drawal of government coal lands from
homestead entry. Another is in
egard to inheritance and incotre tax.
The president is not very specific
upon this last subject, but he leaves
no room for doubt about his belief in
the desirableness of legislation upon
these mutters and be reinforces a
statement of his position by the best
specimen of argumentation in the
whole message. lie Is brief but
positive in his recommendation of
ship subsidy, of conferring citizen
ship upon tbe Porto Rlcans, and of
tree trade with tbe Philippines. On
the paclfio coast Japanese qnestion
the president does his very worst,
ne Is exceedingly overbearing aod
offensive in his ODinions upon this
subject. He writes like a man who
had lost his temper and did not know
what be was saying. In impassioned
declamation he says in effect that
when a president makes a promise
which he has no authority to make in
tbe name of the nation, that the
rights of the states, the constitution
nor anything should avail to stand in
tbe way of tbe keeping of the nation's
faith, that 1, the president's
unauthorized promise. The message
closes with words of praise for the
army and navy And In spite ot the
president's extraordinary actions In
the Scbley, Funston and Pershing
cases it u Just to say that great
credit Is due to him for the improved
spirit In both of these branches of the
service.
be n incorporated in platforms ot
party principles It Is quite certaiu
that delegates to state conventions
whlcb have adopted such platforms
have not had tbe information which
would jostify such an action rn the
part of t he legislature, and It is doubt
ful whether the legislators who
contemplate Introducing such bills have
such Information, Undoubtedly, if
the transportation of passengers can
be profitably done and in proper
comfort and decency on a rate of two
cents per mile, then the fare ought to
be changed. Anrl It is extremely
probable that on most of tbe best
trunk lines a fare of two cents per
mile would be found remunerative.
But the law would have to be uni
form, and it it is not at all probable
that the branch lines would break
even In the matter of passenger trans
portatlon on a two cent basis
It requires more expert knowledge
tban Missouri legislators are usually
credited with having determine the
justice of this proposed legislation.
The matter at least ought to be re
ferred to a commission for careful
Investigation. The tact tbat rail mar's
are high-banded to their treatment
of the public has nothing to do with
tbe proposition. A state cannot aff rd
ever to be vindictive. Unless V
should prove tbat the present rates
are unnecessarily high. The red op
tion of rates would necessarily result
Id diminishing the number of traiu-
and reducing the quality of the ser
vlci. There are railroad abuses in
abundance which can be corrected
and which require no expert know
ledge on the part of legislators The
maintenance of passenger stations of
a character comporting favorably
with tbe ticket sale is one of them
Tbe wbole pass bus1 cess ought to be
done away with. The railroad bus
iness is Dot a private business and
railroads no more than postoffices can
show favor without doing injustice.
There are many ample propositions
like these oo which the legislators
could not possibly go astray and which
would prove more certain relief to
the public v
