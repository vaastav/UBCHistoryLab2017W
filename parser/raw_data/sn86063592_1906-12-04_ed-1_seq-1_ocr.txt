Boston. Mass., Dec. 4. The United

the consideration of one of the most
unusual cases of slleged fraud that
has ever worried the pension offi
ciate in Washington. The cass la
that. of John Martin of Marlboro,
gray-haired veteran of the Civil, war.
According to the evidence of witness
es the accused has defrauded the gov
ernment out of about $4,000 by setting
up nis own record the civil war
record of John Martin tf Uxbridge.
The accused la said to have con
fessed to the deception and to have
admitted he falsely represented him
self as John Martin of Uxbridge,
member of Co. D, Fourth Massachu
setts cavalry, who was wounded in
the hip aad captured by ths Confed
erates at Magnolia, FJa, and sent to
Aadersonvllle. He was pensioned In
187$ and arrears were paid to him
back to the Urns he claimed he was
wounded.
The Marlboro John Martin is alleg
ed to have drawn the pension until
1900, when he received a letter from
the Uxbridge John Martin, who was
then In Scotland, informing him that
the writer Intended to apply for ft pen
sion and requesting him to assist in
securing It. As a result of that let

and the government hf the ace of his
name. The Marlboro John Martin
agreed to remit the pension to the
Uxbridge John Martin In Scotland
and he did this until last June, hen
his failure to do so led to th expos

8TRENUOUS FIGHT ON .
. CONFEDERATE STATUE ' .
Washington, Dec. 4.-!t Is state J
here that a number of Grand Army .:,
posts throughout the country will
make strenuous objections to the so- - f
ceptance by congress of the statue or . ,
the late J. L. K. Curry, which was
recently placed 'in Statuary hall, at J J'
the capitol as the tribute of the peo
plo of Alabama to one of their most
distinguished statesmen.. 'The objeo ,' ''
tion to the statue la based on the
fact that Curry was ft Confederate
soldier, although ao reference to his -war
record is made in the inacrlptlon ; '
on the monument. Curry, fought
throughout the war and (later was -
sent to congress for two . terms. al -
though his chief claim to fame Is as -a
philanthropist and educator. It ls J '
highly unlikely that the objections,
will be sustained by any considerable .
number of congress, since the refus- '
al of the statue would lnvolvw an In
sult to the memory of a man who
was once , an honored member of the
national legislature. ,;. .
