in the fight being made by that corporation
to annul the judgment of
the Hustings CpnH of/Rtehraond , by
which a fine of $25 was. imposed for
*. failure, to. psvy a .license tax. . The Su
prc-rae Court of Appeals v.awarded
the corporation, a writ of .error and
supersedeas.
The fine was imposed under the
provisions of section .'10, chapter 15,
.Richmond City Code. The firm of
Armour & Company was chargwl
tvilh "conducting a fresh meat and
provision business after May 1, 191'1,
without having paid license tax.
p Counsel for the corporation, in
* the petition to the Supreme Court^
contends: <ll That the court erred
in entering said judgment; and 2,
, that the court erred in refusing to
set aside said judgemnt as contrary
; to the aw and evidence "
; These assignments of error bring
? up questions involving the validity
* of the ordinance under which the
fresh meat and provision tax is imk
posed, and the legal authority of the

It is contended that the Fi

!cd with the Dnshisha University at
j Tokio who attended federal conni
cil of Churches of Christ in Amerj
ics in an. authorized statement dcj
dared that "the views of President
: Wilson in his annual message on
the subject of preparedness will be
I received with suspicion and distrust
j by Japan." '"President Wilson," he
said, "practically agrees that we need
a strong navy. Japan will think
that we want a strong navy for the
j purpose of dominating the oceans,
j She knows that we will never trans!
port troops over the Pacific to at\

i taei-. net .
It is well understood in Japan
(that Germany hoped for war between
! Japan and our country, in Svhich
|Japan would be weakened. That
' was part of the German war policy
!?:o foment a Japanese-United
States war in which th<* latter would
be used as a catspaw for Gennany.
| Now, while Japan is rejoicing- over
'the capture of Kiao-Chou, and sayI
ing that Germany will never again
1 get a hold in the Far East, we arc
j raising this cry for greater prcparodjncss.
The president spoke of our
i pacific intentions, but he talks about
j young men being trained in the use
| of military weapons and uses such
| expressions as 'we must he prcparjo<!
to defend ourselves' but it is just
| exactly a strong navy that will cause
i suspicion of us and our plans, and
! tliis is particularly true of the Far
iEast. Japan cannot but ask the
j ouestion as to what our purpose is
: for having been taught as she has
} been fcr some time past to interpret
jail our actons from the standpoint of
j suspicion and distrust. One of the
! ominous signs of the times is the
| change of Japanese sentiment toi
ward lis. Now while Europe is fast
! being depleted of her military and
j naval strength thus postponing in
i the very nature of things possibility
I nf our being involved in war, we arc
I askng for a greater degree of pre!

DANGERS OF KEROSENE.

more deaths in Virginia, during 19131
! than railroad accidents and drowning
! and cost more lives tlian mining no
cidents, acording to statistics of the
State Board of Health.
The board's figures show a total
of 240 deaths from burns during
the year 15)13. While many of these j
, are declared by the board to be the !
i result of non-preventable accidents, j
j kerosene oil is thought to lie respon|
sible for many fatal burns. On
i this aspect of the subject the board
has issued a special bulletin which
leads in part as follows:
"Reports from the registrars of
births and deaths indicate that the
j careless use of kerosene oil, especially
in kindling fires results*.in many
harrowing accidents. Wo not infrequently
hear of cases where persons
have risen to light fires in cold rooms
and have attempted to make the fire
burn more rapidy by the application
, of kerosene. It often happens
that this ignites and burns hack to
the person who is applying tho oil.
F.vcn where there is not an immedI
iato explosion that destroys life and
j property, there are torturing burns.
Carelessness m handling lighted
lamps^ or in putting; oil in lamps
while they are burning also causes
many fatalities.
, "The people of the State cannot
these practices. Oil should never he
applied to a burning fire and. if used
at all. should be sprinkled on the
wood before the fire is lighted. It
should never be used on wood which
< is placed in a fireplace or stove whore
ashes are smouldering, and it is far
. better never to use at all. Lamps
: should never he filled while they are
; burning or filled while close to other
; lights."
SOLDIER BURIED ALIVE.
Was Covered Over With Dead Bodies
in Trench.
! I !
i Thd .terrifying experience of an
! Alsatian soldier in the French army,
who was buried alive in a trench
under a pile of dead men and who
escaped in a manner almost miraculous,
is related in the Paris Figaro.
The soldier, Frederick X?comes
from Strassburg. Like all Alsatians,
he was forced t.o serve his three
years in the German Army; then
ho decided to spend the rest of his
| life in France.
fn Paris, in the latter part of July,
! he was summoned, with other one

time German soldiers, to the German
Consulate and there received orders
to return for the mobilization. Instead
of obeying he went to the
French Army headquarters and enlisled
in a line regiment, where, because
of his military training, he
was one of the first sent forward to
fill up the ranks of the fighting forces.
Ilis organization was stationed on
the line near Rheims when his ordeal,
as he related it at abase hospital,
occurred.
"We were in a trench," lie said,
"when shrapnel shell exploded in
the midst of our section. I felt an
ourfn) nnin in the abdomen. then t
fainted.
"When I came to I found myself

in the bottom of the trench, with ]
bodies of dead men lying over me,
both French and German. Earth
covered us all, whether thrown over
us by the shell, or shoveled in to
cover the dead, I do not know. I
realized that I was biiried alive. The i
fair, of my wound was. so intense (
when I tried to wriggle out from
the weight that I had to cense. The
situation was not gay.
"Then like a flash of hope I heard
voices. I listened, anxious. If they

but if Germans, T would jump from
one death to another if I attracted,
their attention. And then came the

"I am not a German-" I shouted;
