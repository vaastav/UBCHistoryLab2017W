Business Sentiment for Reiteeetty.
The New York chamber of commerce is
divided on the subject of reciprocity. A
part of the membership sustains the ac
tion of the reciprocity convention recently
held in this city, while another part rejects
it, holding that while the convention de
clared in favor of reciprocity. It did so in
terms that make such a policy Impossible.
The friends of reciprocity have presented
the following resolutions. and they will be
debated at an early meeting of the cham
her:
"Resolved. That this chamber expresses
its disapproval of the action taken by the
national reciprocity convention at Wash
ington on the 20th ultimo as subversive of
all attempts to bring about closer trade re
lations with our sister nations and to open
new and wider markets for our products;
and be it further
-Resolved, That the chamber views with
apprehension the oolicy advocated by the
reciprocity convention as likely to invite
hostile legislation on the part of the other
nations against this count-y to the great
detriment of its commercial Interests."
Why should not this action be copied by
the chambers of commerce throughout the
country? Why not ascertain in that way
just how strong business sentiment in the
United States is in favor of reciprocity?
The convention held in this city was com
posed almost exclusively of manufactur
ers whose industries have been built up
by the policy of protection. They were able
men, and familiar with the subject from
the viewpoint of their personal interests.
And naturally they expressed themselvee
from that viewpoint. But they did not
close the debate. There is another side to
the question, as these New York resolu
tions show, and it should be fully and
frankly presented by a united effort on
the part of all business men who hold it.
There Is plenty of time for th's. Con
gress has just taken down the shutters.
and-the shop is likely to remain open for
at least seven months. Just now we are
bearing the prediction somewhat cnnfident
ly made that nothing of any kind respect
ing the tariff will be done at this session.
The reciprocity treatles negotiated by Mr.
Kasson are dead. New ones to take their
place will not be ordered. The ways and
means committee of the House will give
the tariff a wide berth. And so on. It all
ecpends. The cockiest of the gentlemen
holding this tone is not beyond the reach
of public opinion resolutely and adequately
expressed. If there is a demand for rec'
procity and for the abolition of tariff
duties which have ceased to be a protec
tion for infant industries and are now a
bounty for giants, they may be obtained.
Let us hear from the chambers of com
merce, and boards of trade. and all those
manufacturers who do not subscribe to the
double shuffle on the subject of reciprocity
executed here last month. Mr. McKinley
thought someth!ng should be done. Mr.
Roosevelt is of a like opinion. There is no
lack of leadership in Congress. In either
H11ause may be found republicans willing to
make the fght for free trade, and who
think It may be done, and the fight woh,
without injury to any branch of American
industry.
Locating Pubie Buildings.
The reported agreement between the
members of the park commission and the
Attorney General not to proceed with the
new Department of Justice building on the
site chosen by Congress is in line with'the
general desire of those who hopo to see
Washington develop evenly and satisfac
torily as a capital. The location of this
building upon the small site prepared for
it would throw it out of harmony with
the group of structures south of it. It
would have no reference to any broad plan,
and would forever stand as a monument
to the government's inconsiderate haste
and economy.
The reasons for haste were removed
when Congress authorized the abandon
inent of the ramshackle reedmnen's- Bu
reau building, which had come within
an ace of collapse under the pressure of
heavy occupancy. There is every reason
why this structure, which should be one
of the finest of the whole series of depart
mental buIldings, should be placed with
reference to the proposed plan of public
improvernents soon to be outlined to. the
Senate. There will be anmple room within
the great avenue-Mall triangle, which It is
proposed to add to the reservation, for
this and many other buildings. It may be
easily placed there within a short distance
of the White House.
The public building scheme must be con
sidered now In its broadest aspect in order
to insure the most satisfactory results.
Piece-meal site selection will never pro
duce the results required by the character
of the city. A comprehensive plan ot site
prov-ision, such as the Inclusion of the
great triangle within the Mall. is the only
assured manner of preventing lapses in the
future from the central p~roject of provid
ing for the government's needs. There are
enough badly placed buildings now in
service to warn Congress of the folly of
depending upon the impulse of the hour
to guide the authorities in their choice of
sites.

Presidient Roosevelt's willingness to get
general ir.formnation wherever he can find it
will have a tendency to discourage the peo
ple who sometimes think they can forecast
the stock market by inspecting the White
House visiting list.

Leemotles and Electrie Motors.
At a recent memion of .the American So
iety of Mechanical Engineers experts pre
sented statistics showing that the running
of express and limited trains on the steam
raliroads has increased the cost of oper
ating locomotive, from about 81 to $2 a
mile, while at the same timne adding mna
terially to the responsibilities of managers.
The peiaiese to of the added cost are
fuel ennmsmpties, ser ad tear, brakg
to machimery. Injury to track, delay to
other trains-to gIte a cear track' and sc
eidents. Nevertheless the demand for rapid

"Sobering Efeets of 0.0ee."
It is observed In quarters nbt heretofore
friendly to Mr. Roosevelt that he is already
showing in the presidency the sobering ef
fects of high dffcal responsibility. His
message is described as a surprise because
of its conservative tone. There seems to
have been the expectation of a document
bristling with aggressiveness' toward the
outside world, and threatening the turning
up of Jack here at home. But really, upon
what was this expectation founded?
Upon Mr. Roosevelt's record as civil ser
vice commissioner? He did nothing reck
less in that office, but much that was wise
and for the good of the cause. Upon his
record as police commissioner in New
York? He shook up- the force there from
top to bottom, but it was universally ad
mitted that he did his work admirably, and
that the city and the force itself greatly
benefited. When he went to the Navy De
partment it, was freely predicted that he
and Mr. Long would pull together at, the
furthest about a month. The one was rep
resented as all impetuousness and imprac
ticability. and the other alf soberness and
calculation. The two men got along like
brothers, and. the Secretary surrendered his
assistant to the army with the greatest re
luctance. When Mr. Roosbvelt put on his
shoulderstraps, there were those who shud
dered for hii regiment and his superior
officer. They did not .doubt that there
would be a mutiny In camp, and that the
second In command of the Rough Riders
would head it. He,.proved instead a good
soldier, and was both brave and efficient.
Why then this comment, as if a wild man
had entered the White House two months
ago and been tamed there? As a matter
of fact, Is not the change in his critics,
and not in Mr. Roosevelt? He has always
been an aggressive man, out of the ordi
nary in hfs carriage and methods, and this
has invited speculation and no little cari
cature. It has grown to be a custom to
refer to him as a fighter, always on the
b --I- ova "biling. for a row. Much
of this was simply good fooling by the car
toonists and the newspaper paragraphers,
and some of .hem handled their topic in a
way that even Mr. Roosevelt himself must
have enjoyed. But it was no more than
that. and the joke is on those who took
it all seriously, and are now drawink their
first breath of comfort since Mr. Roosevelt
became President upon finding that he Is
not disposed to use his office as would a
cowboy; and set out with his revolver
drawn to "smoke" the United States.
This comment. however, is a good sign,
as It. shows that even the most bitterly
prejudiced of the President's former critics
know 1.man when they get the proper line
on him, and are willing to give him credit
when they think he deserves It.
Anti-Aaarehium. Measures.
There, Is certainty of the presentation of
a great number and variety of suggestions
regarding the best meana of carrying out
the President's recommendation that the
reds be excluded from this country. Al
ready fully a dozen bills have been intro
duced in Congress proposing one or another
remedy for the evil. Probably many more
will be offered before the session is well
under way. These bills will follow the
same general line of providing against the
acceptance of immigrants who are known
or suspected to entertain anarchistic sen
timents. They will differ chiefly in the
manner In which the government is to as
certain the precise nature of the applicant's
sociological views and in the degree in
which the expulsion of. anarchists already
here is authorized.
Out of this mass of suggestion ought to
come a strong measure of self-protection.
It Is one of the first dtities of Congress at
this session. Even if the President had not
spoken so pointedly and. Impressively upon
this toplc, the public sentimeot In favor
of a tightening of the lines at the ports of
entry would have requred.that the matter
be taken up at the outset of the session
and pressed to a'satisfactory conclusion.
There can be no outspoken opposition to
the principle involved in any of these bills.
The argument lies along the lines of the
best. means to the end. it is assured .that
there will be no- more than a reasonable de
lay in the formulation and -enactment of
the bill which wiui result from the various
propositions now pending or being framed
for presentation.
It is said' that there is enough applejack
in New Jersey to- give every voter-five sal
ions. This fact may be what makes som*
of the anarchists in Paterson so Indignant
about the manner in which wealth is dis
tributed.
General Coxey also had an .original idea
about providing money for the masses. But
he was shrewd enough to drop It when the
audience got tired.
One of the most important questions Con
gross .will have to decide is what urgent
questions will be given precedence" of other
pressing questionms.

Senator Sorghum Indignantly; "a mighty
bad way! if this thing goes on, there's no

"Do you mean to say you are coming for

"That's exactly what I mean to say. It's

There ought to be a law to prevent a man
from taking money from more than one
candidate in the same election."

From the Mania AmerIcan, October 24.
-Much 'has been said and written In Ma
nila recently regarding a threatened 'up,
rising and the supremacy of the military
authority In the Philippine Islands. That
there is and haa- been an insurrection in
Samar of 'more or' lesis Importance ever
since the date of American occupation is
conceded.- That military authority should
be and -Is aupreme there. is .also conceded.
But to conclude from this that there 'Is
danger of an uprising of the natives in Lu
son, and hence a necessity. of returning to
martial rule in Manila and elsewhere
throughout the Islands, is absurd. Certain
of the islands are in Insurrection. Such
should be curbed with the iron hand of
military power. The greater portion of the
islands are at peace. To talk of returning
such portions of the islands to military des
potism will do more than any other one
thing to create a feeling of unrest amongr
the natives, and may and 'probably will
culminate In another insurrection. There
is less trouble In the archipeiago,-.with the
exception of Samar, than there has been in
any of our western state& with the Indians
during the past thirty yeats, and less tlan
there has been in many of the southern
states with the negroes during the same
periods -
