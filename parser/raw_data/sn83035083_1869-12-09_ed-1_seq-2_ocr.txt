PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Washington', Dec. 6.
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives :
In coming before you fop the first
, time as Chief Magistrate of this great
nation, it is with gratitude to the giv
er of all good tor the benefits we en
joy. "We arc blessed with peace at
home, and are without entangling al
liances abroad, to forbode trouble ;
.with a territory unsurpassed in fertil
ity, of an area" equal to the abundant
support of 500,000,009 of people, and
abounding in every variety of useful
niinecal, in quantity sufficient to sup
ply the world for generations ; with
exuberant .crops; with a variety ot
. climate adapted to the production ol
every species of earth's riches, and
suited to the habits-, tastes and re
quirements of every living thing;
with a population of 40,000,000 of free
people, all speaking one language,
. with facilities tor every mortal to ac
quire an education; with institutions
closing to none the avenue to fame or
"any blessing of fortune -that maybe
coveted; with freedom of pulpit, the
. press and the school ; with a revenue
flowing iuto the national treasury be-
' yond the requirements of the govern
ment; harmony is being restored
within our own borders, and manufac
tories hitherto unknown are spring-
. iug up in all directions, producing a
degree of national independence une
qualled by that of any oilier power.
These blessings, and countless others,
are entrusted to your care for the
brief period of your office. In a short
time, we must, each of us, return to
the ranks of the people, who have con
ferred upon us our honors, and ac
count to them for our stewartship. 1
earnestly desire that neither you nor
-1., may be condemned by a free and
enlightened constituency, nor by our
own consciences.- '
Emerging from a rebellion of gi
gantic magnitude, aided as it was by
the sympathy and assistance ef foreign
nations, with which we were at peace,
eleven States of the Union were four
years ago left without legal state gov
ernments: a national debt had been
contracted ; tAinerican commerce was
. almost driven from the seas; the in
dustry of one-half of the countrv had
been taken from the capitalists and
placed where all labor rightfully be
longs in lhe keeping of the laborer.
.The work of restoring sta'e goveru-
meats loyal to the Union ; of protect-
. . ing and lostering free labor, and pro
viding means for paying the interest
on the public debt, have received am
ple attention from Congress. Altho'
your efforts have not met with success
m all particulars that might have been
desireJ., yet, on the whole, they have
been more successful than could have
been reasonably anticipated. Seven
States' which passed the ordinance of
secession have been fully restored to
their places in the Union. The eighth,
Georgia, held an election at which she
' .ratified her constitution, republican in
form, elected a governor, members -of
' Congress, a state legislature, and all
. other officers required. The governor
was duly installed, and the legislature
met and performed all the acts then
required of them by the reconstrvc-
..-tion acts ot Congress, subsequent
ly, however, iu violation of the con-
stitutiou which thev had just rati-
. tied, as since decided by the supreme
court of the state, thev unseated the
colored members of . the legislature
and admitted to seats some members
1 :who- are -disqualified by the third
-: clause of the fourteenth ameudmeut
to the constitution, an article which
they themselves had contributed to
i ; -ratify. I would submit to you whe--,.ther
it would not be wise without de
" Jay to enact a law authorizing the gov
ernor-of ueorgia to convene the mem
V bers originally elected to the legisla
ture, requiring each member to take
the oath prescribed bv the reconstruc
tion act, and none to be admitted who
are iuelligible under the third clause
' ' of the fourteenth amendment. The
freedmen, under the protection which
- they have received, are making rapid
i' .progress in learning, aud no com-
. plaints are heard of any lack of indus
try on their part, when they receive
iair remuneration lor their labor..
.... -r- LOSS TO AMERICAN COMMERCE. j
'The means provided for paying the j
"-"interest on the public debt, with all '
the other, expenses of the government,
... are more than ample. The loss of our
commerce is the only result of the late
" rebellion which has not. received suf
ficient attention. To this subject I
call your earnest attention. I will not
''; how suggest plans by which this ob
ject may be effected, but will, if nec
essary, make it the subject of a special
4 message during the session of Con
gress. VIRGINIA, MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS.
At the- March term, Congress, bv a
joint resolution, authorized the execu
tive to order elections in the states of
: r Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, to
submit to them the constitutions
which each had, preveviously, in con
ventiou, framed, and submit the con
stitution, either entire or in separate
- parts, to be voted upon at the discre
tion of the executive. Under this au
thority the elections were called. In
. Virginia the election took place on
the 6th of July, 1869. The governor
' and lieutenant governor elected have
- been installed; the legislature "met
and did all required by this resolu
' tion, and by all the reconstruction acts
of Congress, and abstained from all
doubtful authority. I recommend
that her senators and representatives
be admitted, and that the state be fully
restored to its place in the fainilv of
states. Elections were called iu Mis
sissippi and Texas, to commence on
the 30th of November, 1869, aud to
last two days in Mississippi and four
days in Texas. The- elections have
taken place, but their result is not
known. - It is to be hoped that the
- acts of the legislatures of these states
.... when they meet, will be such as will
meet vour approval, and thus close
the work of reconstruction.
RETURN TO SPECIE PAYMENTS.
Among the evils growing out of the
rebellion aud not vet. referred to is
that of an irredeemable currency. It
-,-is an evil which I hopo will receive
: your most earnest attention. It is a
duty, aud ouo of the highest duties pf
a government to secure to the citizens
a medium ol exchange or nxea, nnva-
" ryiug value. This implies a return to
- a specie basis, aud no substitute for it
- can be devised. It should be com
menced now, and reached at the ear
liest practicable moment consistent
with a fair regard to the interest of
the debtor class. Immediate resump
tion of specie payments, if practicable,
would-not be desirable; it "would
compel the debtor class to pay beyond
their contracts the premium on gold at
at the date of their purchase, aud
.would bring bankruptcy and ruin to
, thousands. Fluctuations, however, in
the paper value of the measure of all
values, gold, is detrimental to the in
terests of trade. It makes the mini of
! insiuo9 an involuntary gambler, for
in all salc3 when future payment is to
be made, both parties speculate as to
what will be the value of the currency
to be paid and received. I earnestly
recommend to you, then, such legisla
tion as will insure a gradual return to
specie payments, and put an immedi
ate stop to the fluctuations iu the val
ue of currency. The methods to se
cure these results are as numorous as
are the speculators on political econo
my. To secure the latter I see but
one way, aud that is to authorize the
treasury to redeem its own paper at a
fixed p'rice whenever presented; to
withhold from circulation all such
currency- redeemed until sold again
for gold. The vast resources of the
nation, both developed and undevel
oped, ousfht to make our credit the
best on earth. With a less burden of
taxation than the citizen has endured
for six years past, the entire public
debt could be paid in ten years; but
it is not desirable that the people
should be taxed to pay it in that time.
Year by year the ability to pay in
creases In a rapid ratio, but the bur
den of interest ought to be reduced as
rapidlv as cau be done without viola
tion of the contract. The puhlic debt
is represented in great part by bonds
having from, live to twenty and from
ten to forty years to run, bearing in
terest at the "rate of 6ix per cent, and
live percent, respectively. It is op
tional with the government to pay
tlits bonds at any period alter the ex
piration of the last tune mentioned
upon their face. The time has al
ready passed when a great part of
tlietu may be takenup. The time is
rapidly approaching when ail, it is oe
iieved, that are now,due may be re
placed by bonds bearing a rate of in
terest not exceeding four and a half
per cent., and as rapid" y as the re
mainder become due they may be re
placed in the same way. To accom
plish this, it may be necessary to au
thorize the interest to be paid at either
of the three or four of the money
enters of Europe, or by any assistant
treasurer of the United States, at the
option of the holder of the bonds.
I suggest this subject for the consid
eration of Congress. Also, simulta
neous! v with this the propriety oi re
deeming our curreifcy as before sug
gested at its market value at the time
the law goes iuto effect, increasing the
rate at which the currency will be
bought from day to day, or week to
week, at the same rate of interest as
the government pays upon its bonds.
nil! TARIFF AND INTFRNAL REVENUE.
The subject of the tariff' and inter
nal taxation will necessarily receive
your attention. The revenues of the
country are greater than the require
ments, and may with saieiy oe re
duced ; but as the funding of the debt
in ft four or four ana a nan per cent,
loan would reduce the annual current
'expenses largely, thus, after funding
justifying a greater reuucuon oi
tion tiian would be now expedient, I
strggest the postponement of this
question until the next meeting of
Congress. It may be advisable to
moflifv taxation aud the tarin in in
stances where unjust or burdensome
discriminations a e made by the pres
ent laws, but a general revision ot the
laws regulating this -subject I recom
mend, the postponement of for the
present. I also suggest the renewal
of the tax ou incomes, but at a reduced
rate, say of three per cent., and this
tax to expire in three years. With the
funding of the national debt as here
suggested, I i'eel safe in saying that
the tax from revenues and imports
mar be reduced safelv from sixty
to eighty millions per annum at once,
ind still further reduced from year to
year, as the resources of the country
are developed.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury shows the receipts of the
government for the fiscal vear ending
June 30, 1859, to be 370,943,741, and
the expenditures, including interest,
bounties, &c, to be 321,590,597. The
estimates for the ensuing year are.
more favorable to the government,
aud -will, no doubt, show a large de
crease in the public debt. The receipts
in the treasury, beyond expenditures,
have exceeded the amount necessary
to place to the credit of the sinking
fund, as provided by law. To lock
up the. surplus in the treasury and
withhold it from circulation would
lead to such contraction of the cur
rency as to cripple trade and. seriously
ttfect the prosperity of the country.
Uudr these circums'.ances the Secre
tary of the Treasury and myself heart
ily concurred in the propriety of using
all the surplus currency in the treas
ury in the purchase of government
bonds, thus reducing the interest bear
ing debt of the country aud of sub
mitting to Congress the disposition to
be made of the bond3 so purchased.
LThe bonds now held by tho treasury
amount to about 7a,UUO,UUU, including
those belonging to the sinking fund.
Your attention i3 respectfully invited
to the recomniendatiou of the sccreta-
v of the treasury for the creation of
the office of commissioner of customs
evenue. for the increase of salary to
certain classes of officials, and the sub
stitution of increased national bond
circulation to replace the outstanding
three per cent, certificates ; anu most
especially to his recommendation for
the repeal ot Jaws allowing snares oi
fines, peuallics, lorteitures, etc,, 10 oi-
flcers of the government or to inform
ers. The office of commissioner of in
ternal revenue is one of the most ar
duous and responsible nnder the gov
ernment. It falls but little, if any,
hort of a cabinet position in its im
portance and responsibilities. I would
ask for it, therefore, such legislation
as in your judgment will place the
office ou a footing of dignity commen
surate with its importance and with
the character and qualifications of the
class of men required to fill it properly.
THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA
As the United States is the freest of
all nations, so too its people sympa
thize -with all people struggling tor
liberty, and. self-government. But
while so sympathizing it is due to our
honor that we should abstain from
forcing our views upon unwilling na
tions and in taking an interested part
" without invitation in the quarrels
between different nations or between
governments and their subjects. Our
course should always be in conformity
with strict justice ana law, interna
tional and local. Such has been the
policy of the administration iu. deal
ing with tho questions. Dor more
than a vear a valuable province in
Spain, and a near neighbor of ours, in
whom all our people cannot but ieel
a deep interest has been struggling for
independence and freedom, lhe peo
ple and government of the United
States entertain the same warm feel
ings for the people of Cuba, in their
pending struggle, that they manifested
throughout the previous struggles be
tween Spain aud her former colonies
in behalf of the latter; but the
contest has at no time assumed
the conditions which amount to a
war in the sense of international
law, or which would show the exist
ence of a de facto political organiza
tion of the insurgents sufficient to jus
tify a recognition of beligerency. The
principle is maintained, however, that
this nation is its own judge when to
accord the rights of beligerency, either
to a people struggling to free them
selves from a government they believe
to be oppressive, or to independent
nations at war with each other. The
United States have no disposition to
interfere with the existing relations
of Spain. to her colonial possessions
on this continent. They believe that
iu due time Spain and other European
powers will find their interest in ter
minating; those relations and estab
lishing their present dependencies as
independent powers members of tho
family of nations. These dependen-
cies arc no longer regarded as subject
to transfer from one European power
to another. When the present rela
tions of colonies cease they are to be
come independent powers, exercising
the right of choice and of self control
in the determination of their luture
condition aud relation with other
powers. The United Statea, in order
to put- a stop to bloodshed in Cuba,
and in the interest of a neighboring
people, proposed their good oflices to
bring the existing contest to a termin
ation. The offer not being accepted
by Spain on a basis which we believed
could be received by Cuba, was with
drawn. It is hoped that the good of
fices of the United Stales may yet
prove advantageou3'forthe settlement
of the unhappy strife. Meanwhile a
number of illegal expeditions against
Cuba hare been broken up. It has
been the endeavor of the administra
tion to execute the neutrality laws in
good fiith, no matter how unpleasant
the task, made so by the suffering we
have endured from lark of like good
faith towards us by other, nations.
The United States schooner Lizzie
Major was arrested on the high seas
by a Spanish frigate, and two passen
gers taken from it and carried as pris
oners to Cuba. Itepresentaiions of
these facts were made to the Spanish
government as sbou as official infor
mation of them reached Washington.
The two passengers were set at liberty
and the Spanish government assured
the United' States that the captain of
the frigate in unking the capture had
acted without law ; that he had been
reprimanded for the irregularity of his
conduct, and that the Spanish author
ities iu Cuba would not sauctiou any
act that ponld violate the rights or
treat with disrespect the sovereignty
of this nation.
The question of the seizure of the
brig Mary Lowell, tit one of the Baha
ma Islands, by the Spanish authorities
is now the subject of correspondence
between tlii- government and those
of Spain and Great Britain. i
The Captain General of Cuba, about
May last issued a proclamation author
izing search to be made of vessels on
the high seas. An immediate re
monstrance was made against this,
whereupon the captain-general issued
a new proclamation, limiting the right,
of search ot vessels of the United
States, so far as authorized under the
treaty of 1795. This proclamation,
however, was immediately with
drawn. I have always felt that the
most intimate relations should be cul
tivated between the republic of the
United States and all independent na-.
tions ou this continent. It may be
well worth considering whether new
treaties between us aud them may not
be profitably entered; into to secure
more intimate relations, friendly, com
mercial and otherwise.
THE DARIEN CANAL. -
The subject of an interoceanic canal
to connect the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans through the isthmus of Darian
is one iu which commerce is greatly
interested. Instructions have been
given to our minister to the Republic
of the'United States -of Columbia to
endeavor to obtain authority for a sur
vey by this government in order to
determine the practicability of such
an uudertaking, and a charter for the
right of way to build by private en
terprise such work if the survey
proves it to be practicable. In order
tocomplv with the agreement of the
United States as to a mfced commis
sion at Lima, for the adjustment of
claims, it became necessary to send a
commissioner aud Secretary to Lima
iu August last. No appropriation
having been made by Congress for
this purpose, it is now asked that one
be made, covering the past aud future
expenses of the commission.
MEDIATION BETWEEN SPAIN AND PERU.
The good offices -ot the United
States to bring about a peace between
bpam and the boutli American repub
lics with which she is at war, having
been accented bv Snjiin. Peru and
Chili, a congress lma hee.it iiiviti.il to
be held in Washington - during the
present Winter. . A grant has been
giveu to Europeans ot .an exclusive
right of transit over the territory of
.Nicaragua, to which Costa Kica has
given its assent, which, it is alleged
conflicts with vested rights of the cit
izens of the United States. The de
partment of State has now this subject
under consideration.
THE SPANISH GUNBOATS.
The minister of Peru having made
representations that there was a state
ol war between Peru and Spain, and
that Spain was constructing in and
near New York thirty, guuboats,
which might be used by Spain in such
a way as to relieve the naval force at
Cuba so as to operate agailist Peru,
orders were giveu to prevent the de
parture of these vessels, aud I not
feeling authorized to detain the prop
erty of a nation with which we are at
peace on a mere executive order, the
matter hds been referred to the courts
to decide. The conduct of the. war
between the Allies andltepublic of
Paraguay has made our intercourse
with that country so difficult that it
has beeu deemed advisable to with
draw our representative front there.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
Toward the close of the last admin
istration a convention was signed at
Loudon for the settlement of all out
standing claims between Great Brit
ain and the United States, which fail
ed to receivc'.the advice and consent
of the Senate to its ratification. The
time and the circumstances attending
the negotiation of the treaty were fa
vorable to its acceptance by the peo
ple of the United States, but its pro
visions were wholly inadequate for
the settlement of the grave wrongs
that had been sustained by this gov
ernment as well as by its citizens.
The injuries resulting to the United
States by reason of the course adopt
ed by Great Britain during our late
civil war increased the rates of insur
ance, in the diminution of exports and
imports, and other obstructions to do
mestic industry and production, in its
enect upon tno lorcigu commerce of
the country, in the decrease and trans--fer
to Great Britain of our commercial
marine, iu the, prolongation of the
war, aud increased cost both in treas
ure and in lines-of its suppression,
could not be adjusted and satisfied as
ordinary commercial claims which
continually arise between commercial
nations ; and yet the convention treat
ed them simply as such ordinary
claims,. lroui which tney u liter more
widely in the gravity of their charac
ter than in the magnitude of their
amount. Great even as is that differ
ence, no word was found in the treaty
and not an inference could be drawn
trom it to remove the sense of un
friendliness of the course of ' Great
Britain in' our struggle for existence,
wnicn uad so deeply and seriously im
pressed itself upon the people of this
country, liciieving that a convention
thus misconceived iu its scope and in
adequate iu its provisions would not
have produced the cordial settlement
of pending questions which alono is
consistent with tho relations which, 1
desire to have established between the
United States and Great Britain, I
regarded the action of the Senato in
rejecting the treaty, to have been wise
ly taken iu tho interest of peace, and
as a necessai y step in the direction of
a perfect and cordial friendship be
tween the two countries. A sensitive
people conscious of their power are
more at ease under a great wrong,
wholly uuatoned, than under the re
straint of a settlement which satisfies
neither their ideas of justice nor their
grave sense of the grievance they have
sustained. The rejection of the treaty
was followed by n state of public
fueling on both sides which I thought
not favorable to an immediate attempt
at a rciiowal of the negotiations. I
accordingly so instructed our minisfor
to Great Britain, and found that my
views iu this regard were shared by
Ilcr Majesty's ministers. I hope that
the time may. soon arrive when the
two governments can approach the
solution of this momentous question
with an assuranee of what is due to
the rights and diguity and honor of
each, and with the determination not
only to remove the causes of com
plaint in the past but to lay the foun
dation of a broad principle of public
law which will prevent future differ
ences, and tend to firm arid continued
peace aud friendship. This is now
ihe only grave question which the
United States has with any foreign
nation. - ".
RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA.
The question of a treaty for recip
rocity between the United States and
the British provinces on this conti
nent has not been favorably consid
ered by the administration. Tho ad
vantages of such a treaty would be
wholly in favor of the British produ
cer except, possibly, a few engaged in
the trade between the two sections.
No citizen of the United States would
be benefitted by reciprocity. Our in
temul taxation would prove a protec
tion to the British producer almost
equal 'to the protection, which our
manufacturers now receive from the
tariff. Some arrangement, however,
for the regulation of commercial inter
course between the United States and
the Dominion of Canada, may be de
sirable. '
OTHER RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
The commission for adjusting the
claims of the Hudson B,ay and Puget's
eounu agricultural company upon me
United States has terminated its la
bors ; the award of S650,000 has been
made, and all the rights and titles of
the company in the territory of the
United States have been extinguished.
Deeds fo the property of the compa
ny have beeu received. An appropri
ation by Congress to meet this sum is
asked. .
The commissioners for determining
the northwestern land boundary be
tween the United States and the Brit
ish possessions, uuder the treaty of
1356, have completed their labors, and
the commission has been dissolved.
In conformity with the recommen
dation of Congress, a proposition was
early made to the British government
to abolish ' the mixed courts created
uuder the treaty of April 7, 1862, for
the suppressiou of the slave trade.
The subject is still under negotiation.
- THE FREMCH CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge
that a corporate company, organized
under British laws, proposed to land
upon the shores ot the United States,
and to operate there, a sub-marine ca
ble nnder a concession 'from His Maj
esty, the Emporor of the French, of
an exclusive right for twenty, years of
telegraphic communication between
the shore of France and the United
States, with the very objectionable
feature of subjecting all mes4tgee -conveyed
thereby to the sovereignty and
the control ot the French government.
I caused the French and British lega
tions at Washington to be -made ac
quainted with the probable policy of
Congress ou this subject, as foreshad
owed by the bill which passed- the
Senate in March Mast. This drew
from the representatives of the com
pany au agreement to accept as the
basis - of their operations the provi
sions of the bill or such enactment oh
the subject as might be passed during
the approaching session of Congress;
also to nse their influence to . secure
from the French -government a modi
fication of their concession so as to
permit the landing upon French soil
of any cable belonging to any compa
ny incorporated by the authority of
the United fetates, or of any Btate in
the Union, and on their part not to
oppose the establishment of any such
cable. Jin consideration ot this agree
ment I directed, the withdrawal of all
opposition by the' United states au
thorities to the landing of the cable
.and . to the working-of k tSntil the
meeting of Congress. I regret to say
that there has been no modification
made in the compauy's concession
nor so far as I can learn have they at,
tempted to secure one. Their con
cession excludes thecapital and the cit
izens of the United atate3 from com
petition upon the shores of France. I
recommend legislation to protect the
rights of citizens of the United' States
as well as the diguity aud sovereign
ty of the nation : vgamst such an as
sumption. . I shall also endeavor to
secure, bv negotiation, an abandon
ment of the principle of monopolies
iu ocean telegraphic cables. Copies
of this correspondence is herewith
furnished. ' ''-
- ;i ' NATURALIZATION
The unsettled political condition of
other countries, less fortunate than
our own, some times induce theif citi
zens to come to the United States for
the sole purpose of becoming natural
ized. Having secured this, they re
turn to their native country and re
side there without disclosing their
change of allegiance. They accept of
ficial pesitions of trust or honor which
can only be hold by citizens or their
native land ; they journey under pass
ports describing them as such citizens,
and it is ouly when civil discord, after
perhapse years of quiet, threatens their
persons or their property, or when
native state drafts them into its mili
tary service that the fact of their alle
giance is made known. They reside
p ermanently from the United States
they contribute nothing to is reve
uues, avoid the duties of its citizen
ship, and thev only make themselves
known by a claim of protection, lhe
citizens of the United States." whether
nati ve or adopted, who discharges his
duty to his country, is entitled to its
complete protection. While 1 have
voice in the direction of affairs I shall
not consent to infringe the sacred righ
by conferring it upon fictitious o
fraudulent claimants. -
PROTECTION OF IMMIGRANTS.
Oil the accessiou of the present ad
ministration, it was found that "the-
minister : for .North Germany had
made applications for the negotiation
of a convention for the protection of
cmiirrant passengers to which na res
ponse had beeu'ariven. It was conclud
ed that, to be effectual, all the mari
time powers etigaged in the trade,
should join in the measure. Invita
tions have been extended to the cabi
nets of London, Paris, Florence, Ber
lin, Brussels, the Hague, Copenhagen
and Stockholm to empower thoir rep
resentatives at Washington to simul
taneously enter into the negotiations
and to concl ude with the United States
conventions identical iu form, making
uniform regulation as to the construc
tion of the parts of vessels to be de
voted to the use of emigrant, passen
gers, as to the quality aud quantity of
food, as 'to the medical treatment of
the sick, and as to the rules to bo ob
served during the voyage in order to
secure vonlulation, to promote health,
to prevent intrusion, aud to protect
the females, and providing for the es
tablishment of tribunals in the several
countries for enforcing such regula
tions by summary process :y:i:i -i-
RUSSIAN HEMP. , - .:
Your attention is respectfully called
to the law regulating the tariff on Rus
sian hemp, and-whether to fix tho
charges on Russian hemp higher than
they are fixed upon - Manilla, is not a
.violation of our treaty with Russiaj
placing her products upou the same
footing with those of the most favored
notions.
MANUFACTURES.
Our manufactures are increasing
with wonderfnl rapidity under the en
couragement whioh they now receive,
with the Improvements in machinery
already effected aud still increasing,
causing machiuery to take fhe place of
skilled labor. - To a largo extent our
imports of many articles muBt fall off
largely within a very few years. For
tunately, too, manufactures- arc not
confined to a few localities, as former
ly,' and it is to be hoped will become
more and more diffused, making the
interest iu them equal in all- sections.
They give employment and supporfcto
hundreds ot thousands of people at
home, and retain with, us the means
which otherwise would be shipped
abroad. The extension of railroads in
Europe and the cast is bringing, into
competition with our agricultural pro
ducts like products ot other countries,
Self-interest, if not elf-preservation,
therefore, dictates caution against dis
turbing any industri'il interest of the ,
country. It teaches us also the neces
sity of looking to our markets for the
sale of our supplies. Our neighbors
south of us andChina audJapan should
receive our special attention. It will
be the endeavor of tho administration
to cultivate such relations with all
these nations as to entitle us to their
confidence, aud make it their interest
as well as ours to establish belter
commercial relations.
RELATIONS WITn CHINA.
Through the agcniy of the more en
lightened policy than that heretofore
pursued towards China, largely due
to the sagacity and efforts of one of
our own distinguished citizens, the
world is about to commence larsrelv
iucreased relations with that populous
and hitherto exclusive nation. As the
United States have been the initiatory
m the new policy so they should be
the most earnest in showing their
good faith in making it a success. In
this connection I advise such legisla
tion as will forever preclude' the en
slavement of the Cliinese upon our
soil under the name of coolies, and
also prevent American vessels from
engaging iu the transportation of cool
ies to any country tolerating the sys
tem. I also recommend that the mis
sion to Chiua be raised to one of the
first class. -
THREE ESSENTIALS.
On my assuming the responsibilities
of Chief Magistrate of the jJJnited
States, it was with the conviction that
three things were essential, to its
peace, prof-perity and fullest develop
ment, rust among these is strict in
tegrity in fulfilling all our obligations ;
sec6nd, to procure protection to the
persons and property of the citizens. of
the U nited btates in each and every
portion of our common country,
wherever he may choose to move
without reference to original nation
ality, religion color or policies, da
demanding, of him only obedience to
the laws, and a proper respect for the
rights ot others; third, the union of
all of the states, with equal rights in
destructible by any unconstitutional
means. . To secure the first of these,
Congress has taken two essential
steps ; first, in declaring, by joint res
olution, that the public debt should be
paid, both priucipal and interest, iu
coin ; second, by providing the means
for paying the same; Providiug the
means, however, could not secure'the
object desired -without a proper ad
ministration of laws for the collection
of the revenues, and economical dis
bursement of them. To this . subject
the administration has most earnestly
addressed itself, with results, I be
lieve, satisfactory to the country.
There has been no hesitation in chang
ing officials in order to secure efficient
execution, of the laws, sometimes, too,
where, in a mere Raaty view, undesi-
able political results were hkelvto
follow from any hesitation in sustain
ing emcient othcers .against remon
strances wholly, political. -For the
second requisite ' to ;" our gro wth and
prosperity, a -truoand firm, but hu
mane administration of existing laws,
amended from timet to time, as thev
may prove ineffective, or har'slt aud
unnecessary, are probably all that are
required. The third cannot be. attain
ed by special legislation, but must be
regarded as: fixed by the constitution
itself, and gradually-acquiesced in by
tlie lorce oi public-opinion.. -.. -
TENURE OF OFFICE ACT.
It may be well to mention here the
embarrassments possible to. arise from
leaving, on the statute, books the so-
called " tenure of office .act," and I
earnestly recommend its total repeal,
it could, not nave been the intention
of the framers. of ;the -constitution
when providing:; that i appointments
made by the President should receive
tho consent of . the Senate, that lhe lat
ter should have the power to retain in
office persons placed there by Federal
appointment against the Xyill of the
President. The law is inconsistent
with a faithful aud efficient adminis
tration of the government. "What faith
can the Executive put in officials fore
ed upon him, and these, too, whom he
has suspended for reason ? How will
such officials be likelv to serve an ad
ministration which tbey know does
not trust "them ? - - .'
.1 '..;, .INDIAN AFFAIRS.:..;.
From tho foundation-of the govern
ment to the present time, the manage
ment of the original inhabitants of
this continent, the Indians, has been a
subject . of.-- embarrassment and ex
pense, and it has been attended -.with
continuous robberies, murders and
wars, f rom my own experience up
on the frontiers and Indian countries,
I do not hold either legislation -of -the
conduct of the whites who come most
in contact with the Indians blameless'
for these hostilities. The past,, how
ever, cannot be undone, and the Ques
tion must be met as we find it. I have
attempted a new policy towards these
wards of the nation, (they cannot be
regarded in any other light than as
wards,) with fair results so far as.
tried, and which 1 hope will beat-
tended ultimately with great success,
The society of Friends is well knowu
as having succeeded in living in peace
with the Indians in the carl v settle
ment of Pennsylvania,--while' their
white neighbors .of other sects, in oth
cr sections, were constantly embroil
ed. They are also known for their
opposition to all strife, violence and
war, and are generally noted tor their
strict integrity' and fair dealings.
These considerations induced mo to
give the management' of a few" reset'
rations of Indians to them, and throw
the burden of the selection of agents
upon the society itself. The. result
has proven satisfactory. : It will be
found more fully set forth in the re
port of the commissioners of Indian
affaire. For superintendents and In
dian agents not on reservations, offi
cers of the army were selected. .The
reasons for this are numerous, aud
when Indian ageuts are sent there, or
near there, troops must bo sent also.
The agent , and commander .of the
troops are independent of each other,
and are subject to orders from differ
ent departments ot the government.
The army officer holds a .position for
life Tho agent is one at the will of
the President.' The former is person
ally interested in living - in harmony
with the Iudiaus, and in the establish
ment of a permanent peace, to the end
that some portion of bis life may be
spent within the limits of a civilized
section. The latter lias no such per
sonal interest: Another reason is an
economic- one; and- still another, the
hold which tho government has upon
a life ollicer to secure a laitlilul dis
charge ot duties rm carrying out a
given policy, The bniidiug of rail
roads and the access' thereby given to
all agricultural regions of the country
is rapidly bringing civilized settle
ments into contact with nil tribes of
Indians. No'matter what ought to be
the-relations between such settlements
and the aborigines, the faot is that they
do not harmonize well, aud one or the
other has to give way in the end. .'A
system which looks to the extermfna
tionof of 4 raco is too hon'lblp for a
natiou u-- adopt - without entailing
upon itself the wrath of .nil Christon
doni, and engendering i the citizens
a disregard lor human .lite and, tho
rights of ofhers. Being dangerous. I'"
see no substitute for such a system ex
cept in placing all the Indians on large
resej-vations as rapidly as can be done,
and giving them absolute protection
there. As soon as they are fitted for
it they should be induced to take their
lanfls in severalty, and to set up terri
torial governments for their own pro
tection. For full details on this sub
ject, I call your Attention to the re
parts of the Secretary of the Interior
and the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs'.
' : THE WAR I1EPAKTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War
shows tlie expenditures of the War
Department for the vear ending June
30. 1869. to be 880,641,042, of which
$23,882,310 was disbursed in the pay
ment of debts contracted during the
war and is not chargeable to current
army expeuses. ills estimate ot l?6,-
531.034 lor the expenses ot the army
for the next fiscal vear, is as low as
can be relied, ou. Ihe estimates oi
bureau officers has been carefully scru
tinized and reduced wcherevcr it has
been found practicable. If, however,
the condition of the country shoud be
such by the beginning of the next fis
cal vear, as to admit of a greater con
traction of troops, the appropriation
asked for will not be expended. The
appropriations estimated for river
and harbor improvements, and for
fortifications are submitted separately.
Whatever aniouut congress may deem
proper to appropriate for these-pur
poses will be expended. The recom
mendation, of the general of the army
that appropriations be made for the
forts at Boston, Portland, New York,
Philadelphia, New Orleans and San
Francisco, if for no other, iscoucurred
in. I also, ask your special attention
to the recommendation of the general
commanding the military division of
the Pacific, for the sale of the seal is
lands of fet. Paul and bt. George, Alas
ka Territory, and suggest that it cither
be complied with or that legislation
be had for the protection of the seal
fisheries, from which a revenue should
be derived.
The report of the secretary of war
contains a synopsis of the reports of
the heads of bureaus, of tlie comman
ders of military' divisions, and of the
districts of Virginia? Mississippi and
Texas, and the report of fhe general of
the army in lull. The recommenda
tions therein have been well consider
ed and are submitted for your action.
I, however, call special attention to
the .recommendations of the chief of
ordnance Tor .the sale of arsenals and
lands no longer ot use to the govern
ment; also to the. recommendation of
the secretary of war, that the act of
the third of March,- 18C9, prohibiting
prmomotions and appointments ju
staff' corps of the army" be repealed.
lhe extent ot couutry to be garrison
en, and the number of military posts
to be occupied, is the same with a re
duced army as with a large one. The
number ot staff" officers required is
more dependent upou the latter than
the former condition. .".
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The report of t he secretary of the
navy accompanying this,, shows the
condition of tire navy when this ad
ministration came into office and the
changes made since. Strenuous efforts
have Been made to place as many ves
sels in commission, or render them fit
lor service it required, as possibre.aud
to substitute the sail for steam while
cruising, thus materially reducing the
expenses of the navy and adding
ereatlyto its efficiency. Looking to
our future, I recommend a libera!, tho'
not extravagant policy toward this
branch of the public service. , . '
THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.'
the report of the postmaster gene
ral furnishes a' clear and comprehen
sive exhibit of the operations of the"
postal service,, and of the financial
condition of the posloffice department
The ordinary postal revenues for the
year cndiug the 30th ot June. 1809,
amounts to 18,344,510, and : the ex
penditures to 23,093,131, showing an
excess of expenditures over receipts
of 5,353,620. The increase of reve
nue for 1869 over that of 1868 was.$2,
051,909, and the increase of expendi
tures was $967,538, The increased
revenue in 1869 exceeded the increased
revenue in 1868 by $996,336, and the
increased expenditure iu 1869 was $2,-
327,570 less than the increased expend
itures in laba, showing by comparison
this gratifying feature of improvement
that while - the increase of expend
itures over the increase of receipts iu
1868 was $2,439,535, the increase of
receipts over the increase of expend
itures in 1869 was $1,084,371.
Your attention is respectfully called
to the recommondations made by the
postmaster general for authority to
change the rate of compensation to the
main - trunk railroad lines for their
services in carrying the mails ; for hav
ing post route maps executed ; for re
organizing and increasing the efficien
cy of the special agency service; for
an increase of the mail service' xn the
Pacific, and for establishing mail ser
vice uuder the flag of the Union on
the Atlantic ; and most especially do I
call your attention to his recommend
ation lor the totar abolition of the
franking privilege. This is an abuse
from which no one receives a' com
mensurate advantage. It reduces the
receipts for postal service from twen
ty:-five.lo thirty, per cent, and largely
increases me service to be pertormed,
The inethod by which postage should
be paid upon public matter is set forth
fully in the report of the postmaster
general. :.- - ; ' '
.,'-' t- .- PUBLIC LANDS.
The report of the secretary of the
interior shows that the quantity of
public lands disposed of during the
year ending on the 30th of June, 1869.
was 7,666,lo2 acres, exceeding that of
the.preceding year by 1,010,409 acres
ut tins amount, a.Byy.b-H: acres . were
sold for cash and 2,737,36o acres en
tered under the homestead law. The
remainder was granted to aid' in the
construction of works of internal im
provement, appraised to the states as.
swamp lands and located by warrants
and scrip. Tlie cash receipts from all
sources swere $4,472,886. exceeding
those of the preceding yearS2,240,140.
. -. pensions".
' During the last fiscal year 23,196
names were added to the pension rolls
and 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving
at its close 187,963. The amount paid
to pensioners, including compensation
of disbursing agents, was $28,422,883,
an increase of $441,182 on that of .the
previous year. The munificence of
Congress has been conspicuously man
ifested in its legislation for the soldiers
aud sailor's who suffered iu the recent
struggle to ' maintain that unity of
government which makes us one peo
ple.. The additions to: the pension
rolls of each successive year since the
conclusion, of hostilities result in a
great degree from the repeated amend
ments of the act of tho 14th of July,
1862, which extended its provisions to
cases not fulling within its origiual
scope. Tho large outlay which is thus
incurred by the moro liberal allow
ance bestowed since that date, upon
those 'who, in the line of duty, were
wholly or parmancntly disabled.
Public opinion has giveu uu cmphatio
sanction to these measures of Con
gress, and it will bo conceded that no
part of our public burden is more
cheerfully borno than that which is
imposed by this branoh of the service.
It necessitates for the next fiscal year,
in addition .to tho amount justly'
chargeable to tho naval pension fund
an appropriation of $30,000,000.
PATENTS. ;
. During the vear vnuiug the 30th of
September, 1869, tho patent office is
sued 13,762 patents.-and its receipts
were $686,389, being $213,926 moro
than tho expenditures.
EDUCATION OF FBEF.DMKN.
, I would respectfully call, j our at
tention to the recommendation of the
secretary of the interior for uniting
the duties of supervising tho educa
tion of freedmen with the other du
ties devolving open the commissioner
of education.
- THE CENSUS.
If it is tho desire of Congress to
make the census which must be taken
during the year 1870, more complete
and perfect thau heretofore, I would
suggest early action upon any plan
that may bo agreed upon. As Con
gress at the last session appoiutcd a
committee to take into consideration
such measures as might be deemed
proper in reference to the census, and
report a plan, I desist from saying
more.- . .
AGRICULTURAL BEREAU.
I recommend to your favorable con
sideration the claims of the agricultu
ral bureau for a liberal appropriation.
In a country so diversified in climate
and soil as ours, aud with a popula
tion so largely dependant upon agri
culture, the benefits that can be con
ferred by properly fostering this bu
reau are incalculable.
INADEQUATE SALARIES.'
I desire respectfully to call the
attention of Congress to the in
adequate salaries . of quite a mini
ber of the most important officers
of the government. In this message
I will not enumerate them, but will
specify only the .justices of the su
preme court. No change has been
made in their salaries for fifteen years.
Within that time the labors of -the
court have largely increased, and the
cost of living is at least doubled. Du
ring tho same time Congress has twice
found it necessary to increase largely
the compensation of its own mem
bers, and the duty which it owes to
another department of the govern
ment deogrves, and will undoubtedly
receive, its due consideration. - -
CONCLUSION..'
There are many subjects not alluded
to iu this message which might,. with
propriety, be introduced, but I ab
stain, believing your patriotism and
statesmapship will suggest the topics
and legislation most conducive to the
interests of .the -whole people. On
my part I promise a rigid adherence
to the law 8 and their strict enforce
ment. U.. S. Grant.

Thus much we have been able to as

bility, and determined to enjoy her
person at all hazards. At first he en
deavored te conquer her virtue by
offering a large sum of. money if she
would accede to his wishes, but find
ing her inflexible, he used violence,
and after a severe struggle accom
plished his diabolical purpose. The
outraged girl was . terribly lacerated
and confined to her bed after the rape.
The perpetrator of the crime suc
ceeded in bribing the lady's father to
keep quiet and take hs suffering
daughter out of town. The father
who must be something more or less
than -' human, started with her for
