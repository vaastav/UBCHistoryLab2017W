"MINNESOTA CONTEMPT."
A Test of Federal Power as Against
State's.
(By Special Wire to the Argus.)
Washington, Dec. 2. No case of
more momentous importance has come
before the United States Supreme Court
in a long time than the so-called "Min
nesota contempt" test case, which came
up lor bearing today. The case in
volves the question of Federal and
State conflict over railroad regulation
that in the recent past has caused sen
sational clashes of judicial authority,
notably in some of the Southern States.
The question directly involved is as
to whether the United States Circuit
Court exercised its jurisdiction when it
held Attorney General Young, of Min
nesota, in contempt for violating its in
junction against enforcing the State
law regulating commodity rates im
posed a tine of 100 and ordered the
attorney general into the custody ol
the United States Marshal until the
State suits be had begun were dismissed.

THE PRICE OF MEATS.
Reduced consumption of meats in
these times of depression led first to
lower prices for live stock, and now
news comes that the wholesale prices
of all meats have been reduced. The
reductions in Kansas City hare ranged
from 1 to 5 cents a pound, and a reduc
tion of 10 per cent on all meats and
poultry has been made in Chicago.
The retail dealers have not yet re
sponded, btjt they assuredly will, for
the object of the reductions is to in
crease consumption. - The . . consumer,
will soon be benefitted , by a decline
that was bnjrun by Cudahy In Omaha
and that has now extended to the en
tire trade. . v 4..
The decline in the prices of meats is
the forerunner of similar declines in all
other articles that -will be- reported
speedily throughout the country. All
prices are at the apex, and all need the
blue pencil, and all will speedily get
what they need. A ware of reduction
is sweeping over the country, and only
those articles will escape it that are
wanted by other countries cotton, for
example. The home demand has lost
its supporting power, but the foreign
demand is still a lactor . in the art of
price-making.

Coming of Warm Weather Forces Them Out,
CsLti&ing Iteming, Burning Skin Eruptions.
The blood and skin are so closely connected that whatever affects the one has a corre
xmding effect on the other. When the blood is pure and healthy the skin will be soft,
mooth, and free from all eruptions; but when the blood becomes infected with some
mhealthy humor the effect is shown by rashes, eruptions, boils and pimples, or other disfig
uring and annoying skin disease. - ...
The skin is provided with countless pores and glands which, act as a drainage
system to rid the body of impurities through the perspiration that is constantly passing'
h rough these little tubes.. There are other glands tht pour out on the skin an oily
Substance to keep it soft and pliable, otherwise it would become hard and dry from constant
exposure to wind and sunt When the blood becomes filled with humors and acids these are
t hrown off through the pores and glands, burning and irritating the skin and drying up the
natural oils so that we karc mot oaly Acne, Bczema, Salt Rheum, etc., but such dry scaly
kin eruptions as Ttter, Psoriasis aad kindred troubles.
e These huaors In tftetr ,way ntm tlie
blood through ajlisordered or deraaged con-,
dition of the system. There is a certain
amount of waste or refuse matter collected
.a the body erery day. This is se4ess in
nourishing or keeping the system in health,
and nature intends that it shall find an out
let through the channels of bxxiity waste.
As long as these members perform their
duties properly the blood remains purs and
free from infection; but when from any
cause they become dull and sluggish, this
refuse matter is left to sour and be taken
into the blood in the form of humors and
poisons. The skin is a perfect index to the blood; when we see one afflicted with a skin dis
ease, or pimples, rashes, eruptions, blotches, etc., constantly appearing, we know that down
deep in the blood a hunior has taken root, and instead of supplying nourishment and strength
to the fine, delicate tissues of the skin, it is pouring out its acid and unhealthy accumulations.
; 'The skin is not only affected by the humors generated within the system, but poisons
from without, sucn as Poison Oak and Ivy, Nettle Rash, etc., as well as poisons from metals,
acids, etc., enter through the open pores "and glands, andso thoroughly do they take root in
the blood that they are ever present, or return from year to year to annoy the sufferer.
The treatment of skin diseases wkh salves, washes, lotions, etc., is along the wrong line.
True such treatment relieves some of the itching and discomiort, ana aids m Jceeomg tne
skin clean but it does not reach the real cause of the trouble, and at best such things are
