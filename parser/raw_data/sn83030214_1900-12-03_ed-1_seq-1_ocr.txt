THE NEW PARLIAMENT.

FORMALITIES.

{by cable to the TKIBCKC]
London. Dec. 3. 6 a. m.— Parliament mill be
opened this afternoon with old time formalities
conduced in a non-partisan spirit, Sir James
Fergusrcn will propose and Sir Joseph Pease
will second the re-election of a Radical Speaker
cf a Unionist Parliament, and Mr. Balfour and
fir Henry Campbell-Bannerman will exchange
courtesies and make a neat display of the
enmities of public life. Speaker Gully will ex
press gratitude for the honor conferred and
piace himself at the service of the House.
Parliament is an antiquated machine, and
time is required for setting the wheels of legis
lstion in motion. It will be the middle of the
week before debate on the Address to the
Throne opens and writs are issued for the re
election of the three Ministers who are in office
for the first time. The inconvenience of this
requirement for the re-election of a new Min
lfter is Illustrated by the fact that Mr. Brodrick.
as Secretary of War, Is an indispensable figure
for the debates on the finances of the campaign.
The Liberal front bench will probably abstain
from moving an amendment to the Address, but
discipline cannot be enforced among the Rad
icals, who can hardly resist temptation to
harass Mr. Chamberlain by some subtle process
of "i>lnpricking." As the Irish Nationalists have
abandoned the field until Christmas, the busi
ness session will not be blocked, and Mr. Healy*s
main function will be to provide entertainment
for listless benches, if he persists in separating
himself from his colleagues and defying Mr.
O'Brien.
Popular curiosity Is aroused as to the marks
of national gratitude which will be conferred on
Lord Roberts for his services in South Africa.
It Is rumored that he may even receive the
honor of a dukedom and that Parliament will be
asked to vote him the sum of £100,000. The
veteran Field Marshal is expected to arrive
hoiaa in a few weeks* time, and the matter of
the "prpjit trill probably be before the House
when It meets in February.
No further news has been received with re
gard to the situation in South Africa, but it is
believed that an organized attempt to corner
De Wet is proceeding.
Reports cabled from Washington that Mr.
McKinley mill recommend a strong shipping
policy and that Congress will enact the Subsidy
bill for the revival of the carrying trade under
the American flag have attracted much atten
tion In Liverpool, but there are no signs of re
sentment or of organized resistance. Shipbuild
ing Is in a flourishing state on the Clyde and
the Tyne, and competition Is not dreaded in
that Industry. There is not. however, the same
tendency as of old in Liverpool chirping circles
to inveigh against Government aid to steam
•hlp lines of the highest class. The success of
th« German transatlantic lines in building the
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the Deutscbland
: i and carrying oft* the honors of fast service be
tween European ports and Sandy Hook has
warned English and Scotch shipbuilders that
fresh efforts axe necessary for the recovers' of
supremacy, and many merchants and shippers
are convinced that the Cunard and White Star
companies cannot be expected to undertake
costly additions to their fleet unless a substan
tial equivalent for subsidies is provided in pay
ments for mail service on an exceptionally lib
eral scale, especially when passenger traffic is
light six months in the year.

THE BOER PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO BER

AN OFFICIAL INTIMATION THAT EMPEROR
WILLIAM WILL NOT RECEIVE HIM—
SCENES IN COLOGNE.
Berlin. Dec. 2. — Mr. Kriiger has abandoned his
proposed visit to Berlin, owing to the receipt of
an official intimation that Emperor William re
grets that, In consequence of previous arrange
ments, he will be unable to receive him. The
Boer statesman will therefore proceed direct
from Cologne for Holland. He telegraphed to
this effect this afternoon.
The Emperor's intimation was conveyed to
Mr. Krtiger by the German Envoy at Luxem
bourg, who arrived at Cologne to-day.
The "Cologne Gazette," in an inspired com
munique, says:
Mr. K.rttger's visit is not agreeable to Ger
many, bis aim being to obtain intervention in
South Africa. It would be a grave political mis
take. It. WWc!3 be ev«-!i a gitat crime, to allow
him to entertain ev<n a spark of hope that Ger
many will render him any practical support.
This declaration Is accompanied with re
proaches, Mr. Kniger being charged with "hav
ing encouraged a useless guerilla warfare, and
having disregarded Germany's advice when he
might still have followed it."
The press generally strikes the same note.
Cologne, Dec. 2.— Thousands of people waited
to-day in the vicinity of the Cathedral Hotel tp
catch a glimpse of Mr. Kriißer, who, when reply
ing to the deputation ..f Boon students in the
afternoon, described the educational progress of
the Transvaal, thanked the students for their
kind welcome, and shook hands with each.
Afterward he appear* >i upon the balcony,
where he was loudly cheered from below. Hav
ing rested for half an hour, he went into the
vestibule of the hotel, which was crowded with
visitors. Here, replying io a deputation from
the Pan-German League, wishing him success,
he referred to the close relationship between
the Boers and the Germans.
It is expected that Mr. Kriiger will remain
here until Wednesday.

MURDERED AXD AVENGED.
ONE ITALIAN STABS ANOTHER TO
DEATH— THE LATTER'S FRIENDS ,
FATALLY WOUND THE
ASSASSIN.
Frank Tuscan!, an Italian, living In Hudson
st., Hackensack, was stabbed to death last night
about 9 o'clock by John Gambola, a fellow coun
tryman. Friends of the .murdered >nr iv^;*
his death with stilettos, and Gambola now lies
at the point of death in the Hackensack Hos
pital.
Gambola came to Hackensack from Cherry
Hill yesterday to visit Tuscani and other friends.
AH gathered in a house in Huyler-st. occupied
by Italians, and drank a large quantity of wine
in the course of the afternoon. Tuscani and
Gambola were quarrelling over a horse sale,
when the latter jumped to his feet, ran at
Tuscan] and plunged a knife Into his neck.
Tuscani ran out of the house, and in a few
moments fell to the sidewalk dead. Tuseani's
friends seized Gambola/ and hustled him out of
the house along a dark and lonely road which
leads to the jail. As they shoved him along
they stabbed him In the back. His shouts of
-Murder!" attracted the attention of several
passers by, who went to his rescue. His captors
fled to the woods, and his rescuers took him to
the office of Sheriff Van Buskirk.
There the wounded man had several hemor
rhages, some of the knife wounds, of which there
were three in his back, extending into the lungs.
He became unconscious, and was removed to the
hospital in a dying condition, after being at
tended by Dr. Conrad.
The police arrested four Italians, who were
arraigned before Justice Thomas H. Cummings,
and held for examination. Coroner Tracy has
ordered an inquest over Tuscani's death for to
day.
From what the police learned later it seems
that all the men in the place were engaging in
a free fight when Gambola drove his double.
razor edged knife Into Tuscani's neck, severing
the jugular vein. He lived less than five min
utes after staggering out into the yard.
The stabbing had calmed the fighters and
sobered them, too. Gambola had not made any
effort to escape at first, but when it was found
that his victim was dead he and his brothers
tried to get away. They were outnumbered by
this time, as the fight had attracted a crowd
of Italians. The proceedings following the effort
to escape appear to have been most deliberate.
From subsequent events it is believed the friends
of Tuscani planned that Gambola should never
reach the jail alive, and that he should be
stabbed to death on the .way. Men well known
in the Italian colony took charge of Gambola
and announced that they would take him to the
jail. No alarm had as yet reached the authori
ties. It is said that after Gambola was led away
by the friends of Tuscani other men of the local
colony detained all who wished to follow. Gam
bola was led some distance through the streets
in the direction of the jail, but not by the most
direct and public way.
Then in a lonely spot he was stabbed again
Mid again. His face would appear to have been
Jabbed and slashed with the knives of several
men. Four times a knife was driven into r>.*
back. Several times knives were driven into
the flesh in other parts of the body. The four
blows delivered in the back are believed to be
certainly fatal. Each is thought to have pene
trated the lungs. The wounds about the face
and body other than the four delivered directly
into the body appear to have been given more
with the i^a of inflicting torture than of killing
the man.
When stabbed Gambola shrieked with pain
and called for aid. The whole event of the stab
bing and torture of the murderer took less than
a couple of minutes, for, when men who ran Of*
from comparatively aboil distances and out of
nearby bouses reached him, he was alone.
Sheriff Van Buskirk acted promptly. He
aroused several deputies and swore in other
citizens to aid him, and began an Investigation.
The little police force also lent aid. It was not
until the Sheriff and his men came upon Gam-
Lola's brothers looking for him that they began
to gel an idea of what had taken place.
Then four arrests were made. The prisoners
were hustled into jail and lacked in Isolated
cells. Extra' guards were placed in the jail to
see that the men did not escape. Meanwhile
the Sheriff and his men set about searching for
others said to be implicated In the tale told by
Solomon and James Gambola.
Guards were set at all the railroad depots,
with orders to detain every Italian trying to
leave by train, and officers were Bent to the
terminus of the trolley line to arrest any who
trj. ,i to deDart in that manner.
It is said that fully a dozen arrests are likely
to take place among the Hackensack Italians.
The Sheriff says he has reason to belief that
those who remained at the house had a full un
derstanding with these who accompanied the
murderer, and that they were parties before th
act.

CONGRESS MEETS TO-DAY.
PRESIDENTS MESSAGE WILL PROBA3LY
BE READ TO BOTH HOUSES,
AND THEN ADJOURNMENT
WILL BE TAKEN.
Washington, Dec. 2.— The Senate will be called
to order at 12 o'clock to-morrow, but beyond
the probable reading of the President's Message
will transact no business, as the announcement
of the death in the recess of Senators Davis and
Gear, when the message has been read, will
bring the sitting to a close. Senator Allison
will make the announcement In the case of his
late colleague. Senator Gear, and there Is hope
that Senator Nelson may arrive in time to per
form similar service concerning Senator Davis.
These announcements will be preceded by the
ceremony of swearing In the new mem
bers, who this year are Mr. Dolllver, who has
been appointed to succeed Senator Gear, and
Mr. Dlllingham, who takes the place formerly
occupied by Senator Ross, of Vermont, and the
appointment of the usual committees to wait
the P"»aldew< and the House of Represent
atives.
Mr. Frye expects to get up the Shipping Sub
sidy bill on Tuesday, and if not on that day
then on Wednesday, and in doing this, to have
the Spooner Philippine bill displaced. This will
be the beginning of the important work of the
session, and upon the success or failure of the
schema may depend much of the future course
of proceedings for the entire session. In order
to accomplish this result it will be necessary,
first, to get the consent of the Republican mem
bers of the Committee on Order of Business, and
to this end a meeting of that committee will be
held after the adjournment of the Senate Mon
day afternoon. Mr. Frye said to-day that he
already had conferred with a majority of the
members of that committee, and that he felt
assured ho would have no difficulty in securing
their assent to the proposed change.
Thus far there has been no consultation with
Democratic Senators, but the friends of the
Shipping bill do not look for factious opposition
to the taking up of the bill from that source.
A motion to take up the measure is not debatable
under the Senate rules, and they are confident
of a majority on a vote if a rollcall should be
demanded It is probable that a friendly ar
rangement will be made with Senator Morgan,
Who has the Nicaragua bill in charge, that hill
being on the calendar as a special order for
December 10.
Th-re is some talk of an effort in the week to
get up the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty in executive
session, but there is as yet no definite pro
gramme to this end. A movement is> on foot
now to secure the assent of the Committee on
Foreign Relations to the abandonment of the
Davis amendment to the treaty for the fortifica
tion of the proposed canal.
Th.- usual custom of adjourning iver from
Thursday to the following Monday in the flrat
¦a eekfi of the session probably will be departed
from this session. That is the desire of the
Republican leaders now here, and they say there
probably will be no such adjournment this week.
VIGOROUS ACTION BY THE HOUSE.
The leaders of the House are preparing to
prep? with great vigor the important business
of the short session. Already considerable pre
liminary committee work has been done on the
important measures— the bill for the reduction
of the War Revenue taxes, the Army Reorgan
ization hill. River and Harbor bill, several of
the appropriation bill*;— and the legislative mill
Will start under a full head of steam.
The Army Reorganization bill is considered
particularly urgent, owing to the possibility of
its meeting strenuous opposition after it reaches
the Senate, and it is the intention of the leaders
to get it out of the way at the earliest possible
moment. It will be reported probably on Tues
day, and will be taken up at once unless after
further consultation it is decided to let the
legislative. Executive and Judicial Appropria
tion bill, which also will be ready on Tuesday, in
ahead of it. The Democrats will caucis on the
Army bill on Monday, and the indications now
are that they will offer as a substitute for the
permanent reorganization measure a bill ex
tending for two or three years the present law
for a provisional Army.
Tiit- l>m to reduce the war revenue taxes has
been practically completed by the Republican
members of the Ways and Means Committee,
and it will he submitted to the full committee
on Tuesday, unless in the mean time a caucus
of the Republicans should be found advisable.
Some of the Republican members are not satis
fied with the list of articles relieved of taxation
by the bill, and If tco much opposition becomes
evident when the House convenes on Monday
the leaders probably will call a conference or
caucus for the purpose of adjusting and har
monizing differences.
On Thursday the Grout Oleomargarine bill
will come up aa a special order, under a rule
made at ihe last session. It Imposes a tax of
1<» cents a pound on oleomargarine, butterine or
oth-r manufactured butters colored In imitation
of butter. It has strong backing from the dairy
interests, and. while it will meet with warm op-

position from the interests that are antagonizing
its passage, when it reaches a vote its passage
is regarded as a foregone conclusion. Two
days, ft is thought, will suffice for its considera
tion. Saturday, under a special order made last
session, will be devoted to eulogies on the life,
character and public services of the late Repre
sentative Harmer. of Pennsylvania, who for
several years enjoyed the distinction of being
the member holding the record for longest con
tinuous service, and therefore entitled to the
sobriquet "Father of the House."
No business will be transacted at the session
to-morrow, beyond the probable reading of the
President's Message, owing to the deaths of the
late Representatives Daiy. of New-Jersey, and
Hoffecker, of Delaware, which occurred in the
rt-cess. as we-li as the 'deaths of Senators Davis
and Gear.
MAX'S EXD MYSTERIOUS.
PATROLMAN'S BODY FOIND IN HAS T
RIVER FIFTY MINTTES AFTER HE
ANSWERED ROLLCALL.
The body of Patrolman Patrick McGloin, of
the East Eighty-eighth-st. station, was fr.und
at OJ4) a. m. yesterday floating in the East
River, of? East Ninety-fifth-st. McGlotn was
regularly detailed to duty in the Housw of -he
Good Shepherd, at Xinetieth-st. and First-aye.
He answered the 8 o'clock rollcall as usual yes
terday morning in the East Eishty-eighth-st. sta
tion, and then started. It was believed, to the
House of the Good Shepherd. Mystery sur
rounds the death.
Timothy Callahan, captain of a canalboat. dis
covered the body floating hetween his boat and,'
the south side of the pier at East Ninety-fifth
st.. some distance from shore. Callahan called
D. S. Ward, captain of the canalhoat J. D.
Lafayette, which lay on the upstream side of
the pier. The two men held the body with a
pike till Patrolman Madden, of the East Eighty
eighth-st. station, and others assisted in its re
moval from the water.
In the dead man's pockets was found $10T» of
the $11- TK which he had drawn on Saturday
as his month's salary, also some Brooklyn news
papers. These papers and the man's under
clothing were not altogether wet. The body was
tak^n to ihr East Eighty-eight h-st. station.
Neither the canalboat ..-aptains nor James
Shanley. watchman at the powerhouse at East
Ninety-ftfth-St and the river, saw McGloin on
the pier yesterday morning, and they say they
do not believe that he jumped or fell from
the pier near Which his body was found, if this
is so the police think it strange that the body
should have been fbwnd between the boat and
the pier. Detectives Finn and Farrell, of the
East Eighty-eighth-st. station, were ordered to
inv-stisate the case.
McGloin ha(. been on the force about twenty
five years. He was sixty-four years old. He
and his family lived at No. S3fl East Eighty
sixth-st. His fellow patrolmen say he was not
drinking Saturday night or yesterday morning.
The police said last night that their investi
gations led them to believe that MoGloin when
walking along the river front had been seized
with apoplexy or faintness and had fallen into
the water. They did not regard his death with
suspicion. McGloin s funeral will take place to
morrow.
DEATH BURGLAR'S THREAT.
SEIZES BEDRIDDEN WOMAN BY THE
THROAT AND DEMANDS MONEY
AND JEWELS.
Orange. N. J. Dec. 2 ( Special).— Mrs. M. B.
Loveridge. of No. 45 Linden Place, Orange, had
an experience this morning with burglars that
she will remember for a long time. She has
be«"n bedridden with a nervous disorder. About
2 o'clock this morning she awoke with the feel
ing that some one was near her bed. The gas
was turned low. and she could Just make out
the figure of a man standing by the bedside.
She gave an exclamation of fear. The man
Jumped on the bed and, seizing her by the throat
with one hand and by the wrist with the other,
said in a hoarse whisper:
•'If you make the slightest outcry 111 kill you.
I want your money and jewels. Where are
they?"
Mrs. Loveridge said she had neither. The
man then asked who the other occupants of the
house were, and If they had any money or
Jewels. &w' replied that they had none. The
man, after again threatening her life if she
viade a noise, went out of the room and had a
whispered talk with a confederate in the hall.
While this was going on Mrs. Loveridge's
daughter, Mrs. Ludlow Patton. also had awak
ened, hearing some one in the room. Supposing
him to t*> her husband she called out. With
that the burglar disappeared. Mr. Patton wa»
aroused by the noise, and with his wife went
into Mrs. Loveridge's room. They found her
nearly paralysed from fright. Detective Ser
geant DrabeU, of the Orange police, was called
«•> and found that the men had gained an en
trance by forcing the sash of the butler'a pan
try T Re mark* of some blunt instrument were
plainly visible, and a large lot of burned matches
were found lying on the floor of the pantry, as
well as in the kitchen. The burglars secured
no booty. Neither of the women could give a
description of the burglars, and the police have
no cltw.

WAR TAX KEDUCTION.
VIEWS OP VARIOUS INTERESTS ON TH*
PROPOSAL TO CUT DOWN THE
INTERNAL REVENUE.
The declared Intention of in* majority mem- •
bers of the Way* and Mean* Commit of the
House of Representatives »o introduce at an
early day a bill amending the War Revenue
law by reducing or eliminating various taxes,
with the object of decreasing by about $»».»**»,
000. or one-third, the revenue it present col
lected under the law. has aroused discussion
among men in every line of business. and called
forth suggestion^ and memorials from varifens
interests as to the justice or the necessity of
Congress granting relief from the present
brrden of taxation. It is not thought likely that
any chance will be made in the legacy taxes mv
praed by the War Revenue act, nor has tner#
been hear»i from any quarter a suggestion for
such action.
The stamp tax schedule, however, it i» be
lieved, will be materially altered, among others.
The fax on conveyances— GO cents where th*
value exceeds $100 and does not exceed $500, and
50 cents for each additional $r»00 or fraction
thereof— is one which Is likely to be rescinded,
for it is not only costly, but has also been
much objected to as rendering it impossible to
effect a conveyance on private terms. The an
noying little one cent tax on telegraph and tele
phone messages and express receipts is also
likely to be abolished, it is said.
The stock brokers are pretty well reconcile* to
their $50 annual lax. although not a few of
them at first tried to evade its payment; and
they also are not dissatisfied with one phase of
the tax of $2 op each sale or agreement to
sell 100 shares of stock. Many of the Stock
Exchange room traders, however, are understood
to complain that this tax should be imposed
only when there is an actual change in the
ownership of the stock sold and a new certificate
is issued; and not. as now. whether or not a new
certificate is issued. Some of these brokers,
under the law as it now stands, pay each from
$10,000 to $25,000 a year in stamp taxes on sale*
of stock.
PRODUCE EXCHANGE MEMORIAL.
The members of the New-York Produce Ex«
change complain of the provisions of the War
Revenue law affecting them as burdensome in
several respects, and their views have been set
forth in the following memorial, which has been
prepared by the President Elliott T. Barrows,
for presentation to President McKinley and to
the members of the House and Senate:
At the request of the Board of Managers of the
New-York Produce Exchange, I have the honor to
address you on the subject of the stamp tax on
merchandise sold on exchanges and of the special
tax upon commercial brokers. A great part of th»
produce exported front the Atlantic seaboard. In
cluding grain, flour and provisions, ha.-, been for
many years moved on contracts made on our ex
change. These contracts are subject to a stamp
tax of one cent a $100. and as -substantially all
exported produce is sold upon exchanges, this tax
i.i in a great measure a tax upon exports. In addi
tion to this tax the exporters are compelled to
pay a stamp tax of two cents a $100 on every
original and duplicate bill of exchange drawn
against such shipments, and also a stamp tax of
10 cents upon a bill of lading.
As drafts a c drawn against the shipments for
the purpose of paying for the same there is prac
tically -aJiUt of five cents a $100 on -< 1 1 export busi
ness done. The export trade la done on small
margins of profit, anil the exporters of grain have
to meet a galling competition from Russia. India
and the Argentine Republic, and European buyers
will not give- ,i preference to American shipments
of like quality sufficient to equal th« American
exporters stamp tax. This stamp tax. therefore,
tends directly. to- place the products of American
farmers at a disadvantage in competition with the
products of foreign countries. We believe that tax
laws should be so framed as to encourage and not
discourage commerce, and that every unnecessary
burden placed upon trade tends to limit it. The
tendency la to shift the burden of taxation back
upon the producer, and the effect of the stamp tax
upon exported products is to diminish the price
to the producer and to subject the exporters to a
competition which tends to decrease the amount of
trade.
Commercial exchanges are recognized a3 aids to
commerce. Without their co-operation it would be
difficult, if not impossible, to market the produce
of the Western grain fields Their continually ex
erted Influence in keeping down freight rates, their
agreements with elevators and railroads for bulk
ing grain, making it possible to sell abroad upon
established and well known grades, their foster
ing care or commerce in every direction, their rules
and regulations for establishing uniformity in
trade and enforcing a high standard of commer
cial honor are of incalculable value to the com
merce of the country. They provide regular mar
kets where i 1!i 1 ! transactions are open and guarded
by their rales and regulations, and for this quasi
public service they ask no aid from State or Gov
ernment, but only freedoem from special burdens.
In addition to the burden upon export trade, this
tax Is practically imposed upon the facilities fur
nished by such exchanges for doing business.
The effect of the tax is that many transactions
which formerly were had on the Exchange are now
carried on over the telephone, by correspondence
or in the offices of the merchants, and the tax ia.
therefore, injurious to our Exchange. It seems to
us both unjust and unwise to discriminate against
sales made at exchanges or against exchange,
members. The same sale which is taxed if made
at any exchange goes free if made elsewhere. Com
mercial exchanges are not the enemies, out th*
friend*, of commerce. By far the greater number
of transactions on the New-York Produce Ex
change are made in the actual product, and are a
part of the commerce of this port. The speculative
trade has been declining for a number of years,
and it is now a comparatively unimportant part of
exchange activity. In calling this matter to your
attention we are showing our solicitude for the
commerce of the country, the vigor and health of
which is essential to our National prosperity.
Much of what I have said is applicable also to
the special tax of 120 a year on commercial brokers.
We desire to call this matter to your attention,
sincerely hoping that you will lend your aid in in
ducing Congress to relieve us from the burden of
this tax.
It is understood that similar representations)
are to be made to Congress on behalf of the Cot
ton and Coffee exchanges.
THE PATENT MEDICINE TAX.
It is likely that Schedule B will be repealed in
great part. This schedule includes a tax on
proprietary medicines, which is regarded as dis
criminating and unjust. The manager of such
a medicine said a few days ago:
On a business of £30.000 a year th» tax amounts
to £3.000. It Is true that the tax ta only 2% per
rent on the dollar at the retail price, but th« pro
prietor, after allowing the retailers' and Jobbers*
profits, realize* only about one-half of the retail
price, and therefore pays a straight tax of 5 per
cent: In addition to this It costs about I per cent
to affix the revenue stamps, making an actual tax
of 6 per cent for the mere privilege of being in
business. No legitimate business can stand such a
tax.
The question of repealing certain clauses of
the war tax which affect the interests of law
yers, bankers and brokers, excites little interest
at present. Such is the belief of Carl A. Do
Gersdorff. of the firm of Seward. Guthrie &
Steele. at No. 40 Wall-st.
"Every one is so prosperous," he said recently,
"that one rarely hears a man complain of the
war taxes. Even the brewers are rather in .
favor of the retention of the tax on tne articles
they manufacture. They prefer retention to a
lowering of price*. Some of the broker?, who
make a large number of small transactions each,
day. are anxious to be relieved of the tax. Such
is the case. too. with those who effect many
small real estate transfers. Our firm deals in
large railroad mortgages, and we do not mind
the stamp tax. It la a matter of only SO cents
to $1 In every $1,000 of business transacted."
The cashier of a well known Wall Strert bank
said' yesterday that h> did not believe that the
stamp tax ©& checks would be removed. He
added:
COLLECTOR TREATS VIEWS.
Charles T. Treat, collector of Internal revenue,
in speaking to a Tribune reporter in regard to
the possible reduction of the war revenue, said:
No one his been greatly inconvenienced by the
tax on checks. The tax on notes will probably be
removed, because it is more burdensome. We are
