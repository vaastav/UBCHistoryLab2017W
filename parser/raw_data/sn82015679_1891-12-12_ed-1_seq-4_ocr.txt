'WASHINGTON, I. C. lt!-? House and Ebbitt
Members in both branches have begun
to offer hills and resolutions just as if
there is a possibility that this Congress
is so constituted as to give an important
measure the force of law.
TiiEDeiuocratic press as a whole is
not pleased with the President's re
marks about gerrymandering. They
peeni to assume that the gerrymander is
the right bower of the Democratic
party.
Bearing the appearance of ft trade,
the selection of Mr. Springer as chair
man of the committee on ways and
means will strike the country as an un
wise one. He has not tho first qualifica
tion for tho position.
The canvassers in ono New York sen
atorial district soem to havo the fenr of
Judge Barnard in their hearts more than
the orders of Governor Hill, and have
reversed their work by deciding that the
Republican is elected.
A Washington special says that young
Mr. Williams, of Massachusetts, who is
playing Democratic Representative,
wept when Mr. Mills was defeated,
which goes to show how out of place ho
is in such company and so far from home.
TnosE Democratic papers which are
practicing their wit upon the announce
ment that John L. Sullivan is about to
try the Keeley cure are reminded that,
in some respects, he is tho most robust
Democrat in the land who has declared
for Mr. Cleveland.
Ant person who goes about talking to
the effect that Secretary Blaino is less a
protectionist than any Republican in
public life is proclaiming himself an
Ignoramus. Before protection became
so prominent an issuo as it is Mr. Blaine
was a protectionist of protectionists.
The Attorney-general does well in
recommending the abolition of the fee
system in United States courts and the
substitution of fixed salaries in all cases.
This is in harmony with popular senti
ment relativo to tho fee system in State
courts, and is in tho interest of practical
reform.
The Atlanta Constitution is returning
tho good service which Governor Hill
did Speaker Crisp by commending his
recent speech and otherwise treating
him as a presidential candidate. The
fact that tho Constitution favors a sil
ver dollar which is worth as much in
"the melting pot" as is tho gold dollar
is a decided gain.
The New York Herald continues to
urge the Democrats to go' outside ! of
New York for a presidential candidate1,'
and gives as a reason that while 'he
most of the Democratic candidates for;
tho presidency since : Xickj50ll,8time,
havo been taken from tbrttt;State.'only
two havo reached the presidency-' Van
Burcnand Cleveland.
The Mr. Watson who was the candi
date of Simpson and seven others for
Speaker is being scored by the Demo
cratic papers of Georgia for getting out
Bide tho Democratic organization by not
taking part in the Democratic House
caucus. He is told that fivo other mem
bers from Georgia who are members of
the Alliance voted for Mr. Crisp. They
furthermore tell him that he will not be
re-elected.
It is strange that papers which should
fcuow better still go on declaring that
the Republican policy is to jro on coin
ing 412 12-grain dollars, worth less than
75 cents. As a matter of fact, tho Sher
man law afforded the administration an
opportunity to cease coining all such
dollars, except tho bullion which the
trade dollars contain. The silver which
the government now purchases is not
coined, but legal-tender notes to tho
gold valuo of tho bullion are issued
cgamst it.
The secretary of the Ohio Farmers'
Alliance has come to the conclusion that
tho order was formed for tho education
nnd material advantage of its members.
To that end he has proposed a course of
reading for members, founded on the
basis of the Chautauqua course. His
first year's course of reading embraces
tho following books: "Soils and Crops,"
"Creation and Distribution of Wealth,"
"The World of Matter." and "The Art
of Preparing Healthful Food." How
rapidly tho Polks, Macunes, Simpsons,
it al.t would vanish from the Alliance if
it should go to work intelligently after
tho plan of the Ohio secretary.
The Washington correspondent of tho
Louisville Courier-Journal says: "It
comes in bad grace from the President
to utter words of condemnation of tho
gerrymandering process, when ho knows
that if it had not been for Republican
gerrymandering tho United States
Senate would to-day bo iu the control
of tho Democrats." There it is again,
the sarao old story of recrimination and
"you're another." Suppose we admit
that both parties are equally at fault
and set about providing a remedy for
the future. If the Republicans havo
done so much gerrymandering in the
past, that is a gooa reason why tho
Democrats should wish to put a stop to
it. If they refuse they will bo open to
the suspicion of wishing to continue the
practico for their own benefit. Just
now they a-o invited by a Republican
President and urged by the Republican
press to provide a remedy for tho evil.
What are they going to do about it?
THE OLD CEATT1R ABOUT CL0THI5G.
A few days ago the evening Demo
cratic and free-trade organ raised its
old and dreary wail about the high
prices of clothing, and particularly of
the woolens, which peoplo of limited
means and earnings wear. It declared
that the prices of these goods are so
high that tho masses cannot buy. It is
of no avail to arjruo with such men us
the free-trade editors. A full-weight
fact has no more effect upon their pe
culiar mental organization than a paper
wad would upon the hide of a rhinoceros.
Tho only idea that has entered their
minds for years is expressed in the
words, "tho tariff is a tax," which is the
maxim of the Cobden Club. They havo
learned nothing relative to the tariff
since they received that into their
minds. Facts make no impression. In
their advertising columns they see tho
announcement of prices, and that they
aro lower than over in the history of
trade; they hear peoplo saying how
cheap goods are, but they heed it not.
They see underwear marked at half the
price for which goods of tho same qual
ity sold eight or ten years ago, but this
fact makes no impression on them.
Thoy are bound to assume that
the clothing of the masses is so
much higher-priced here than
in other countries that they cannot pur
chase, leaving their readers to infer
that people in England and Europe aro
wearing moro woolens than aro the peo
ple, in this country, and havo moro
money with which tto purchase. The
fact that the consumption of wool in
this country per capita in clothing is
from 50 to 100 per cent, moro than in
Europe has no effect upon them as evi
dence that our people are better clothed
than any peoplo in the world. Tho fact
that our people aro paid from 73 to 123
per cent, moro wages for the saino kind
of labor does not enablo them to see
that if all they claim regarding tho in
crease of the cost of clothing by the
tariff is true, Americans will yet bo bet
ter ablo to purchase it than'aro tho peo
plo of Europe. The free-trade editor
ignores tho testimony of free-traders.
Ho publishes tho dreary elaborations of
Jacob Schcenhof.who was Mr. Cleveland's
consul to Tunstall, England, to show
that goods can bo produced as cheaply
in tho United States as elsewhere, but
forgets that he, as consul, wrote official
reports to tho State Department declar
ing that all kinds of ready-made cloth
ing, shirts and common underwear were
as cheap in 18SG in the United States r.s
in England. Tailor-mado clothing of
the finer goods is higher hero becauso
tailors' wages aro double what they aro
in Europe. This Schccnhof statement
has been published time and again, nnd
must havo fallen under tho eye of tho
free-trade editor, but such testimony ho
rejects. He rejects even the statements
of all reputable dealers, in this city and
elsewhere, that clothing, such as tho
mass of people wear, is growing cheaper
year by year, and is now 40 per cent,
cheaper than it was iu 1SG0.
A few days since a well-known clergy
man in this city, whoso good service
dates back through the war, remarked,
as tho result of his experience, that
when a man is thoroughly imbued with
tho British free-trade theory it assumed
the form of monomania. He cannot talk
on any subject five minutes without
dragging in somo evidence of his mal
ady. He cannot make a public address
upon a subject entirely foreign wifhout
riding his hobby intotho arena. Ho
seems to lose tho faculty of grasping
facts or of making any application of
them. In view of tho fact that with all
the evidence that the clothing of the
mass of the people was never ho cheap,
and that it is as cheap here as abroad,
while they earn on nn average double
the wages earned in Europe, tho state
ment of the clergyman regarding tho
monomania of the out-and-out free
trade editor is not nrf exaggeration.
GOVERNOR HILL A3 A SAIAEY-GRABBER.
Governor Hill, United States Senator
elect from New York, has not appeared
in Washington during tho present ses
sion and has not been sworn in as Sena
tor. His term of office began on March
4, 1S01. It is understood that he in
tends to servo out his term as Governor
of New York, which runs till somo time
in January, and theu go to Washington
and take his scat as Senator. It is also
stated that he has been drawing two
salaries, as Governor and Senator, since
March 4, 1601, and that he intends to
continue doing so until his term as Gov
ernor expires. This action stamps him
as a eelf-seeking politician without any
regard for public opinion or tho proprie
ties of public life.
Not only is Governor Hill's course in
this matter indecent nnd indefensible,
but there is good reason to believe that
it is illegal and should vacato his seat in
the Senate. The Constitution provides
that every State shall be represented by
two Senators. It also provides- that
"the Congress 6hall assemble at least
once in every year, and such meetings
shall be on the first Monday in Decem
ber, unless they shall by law appoint a
different day." Tho law provides that
every Senator shall receive a fixed
annual salary in compensation for his
services. The implication is that he
will bo present at the opening of Con
gress, present his credentials, tako the
oath of ofiico and enter on the performance
of his duties. Thero is an implied con
tract between him and the people to that
effect. He is under the same obligation
to do 60 that tho government is to pay
him his salary. Jf a Senator ob&cnts
himself from the opening of the Senate,
and is not there to take the oath and en
ter on the performance of his duties
according to contract, tho other con
tracting" pr-rty, tho government, has a
right to declare tho contract off. Sup
pose one enters into. a contract with a
man to work on a farm or in a factory at
an annual salary, the work to begin on
a stated day. Suppose tho hired man is
not there at tho appointed time, but ap
pears a month later and declares his
readiness to go to work, and demands a
fulfillment of the contract. It requires
no knowledgo of law to know that the
contract, having been broken on ono
side, is not binding on tho other.
Governor Hill has deliberately ab
sented himself from tho opening of tho
Senate and has failed to tako tho oath
of ofiico and enter on his duties at tho
time required by tho Constitution. He
has done so defiantly and for tho avowed
purpose of filling out another office and
drawing another salary. Meanwhile the
State of New York is deprived of part of
its constitutional representation in tho
Senate. If one Senator can do this,
both Senators can. If thpy can do it for
one month they can do it for six months.
If Senators can do it Representatives
can. The result would bo that a State
might be deprived of all representation
in cither branch of Congress by men
who refused to perform any service,
while they were drawing pay therefor.
It is impossible to deny that this is the
logical conclusion if Governor Hill's
position is right.
It is not right. It is illegal as well as
indecent. No man with a proper sense
of self-respect or of the obligations that
pertain to oflicc-holding would be guilty
of such conduct. It stamps Governor
Hill as a low-grade politician, without
conscicnco or decency. It stamps him
as a low-grade salary-grabber. His
seat should bo declared vacant. If tho
Senate fails to take notice of this mat
ter it will bo guilty of an insult to good
government and good morals.
TnE Augusta (Ga.) Chroniclo has
come cut fiat- footed in favor of the re
peal of tho ten-per-cent. taxnow imposed
by law upon State bank issues of paper
money. It does this because there is a
scarcity of currency in Georgia of the
kind which "will stay" there. It says
that tho national banks have reduced
their circulation because it does not pay
to keep it afloat. If that is tho casein
Georgia it is becauso money will not
bring sufficient return in tho way of in
terest to make it profitable to pay tho
tax imposed upon national bank circu
lation. If there is no money in Georgia
which "will stay" there, it is because tho
people send what they can get out of
tho State to purchase materials which
they put into tho betterment of farms
and other enterprises, or exchange for
goods. If tho peoplo of Georgia
havo produce to sell which is
wanted in the market they must
have its valuo in money, and
if that mono y is current and they put it
into machinery, building materials,
stock, or use it to pay for clothing and
groceries, they cannot keep it. Amoney
which "will stay" under such circum
stances is not as good as tho money
which tho country circulates. Tho
Chronicle says that tho bills of tho
Georgia railroad would bo good for mill
ions as money, as good as any gold dol
lars. That is putting it pretty strong.
If euch railroad money was as good as
gold the corporation must have gold
with which to redeem it. As a matter
of fact, no 6uch money was ever as good
as gold or national currency, and never
will be. If it were issued it would be
forced upon employes, who would ex
change it for goods, paying for them 5,
10 or 20 per cent, more than tho price
paid in coin or national money. Tho
country has tried all these schemes, and
all of them havo proved devices to im
pose upon labor and poor peoplo gener
ally a depreciated currency. Congress
should not repeal tho ten-per-cent. tax
on State bank notes.
The Chicago News thinks it probable
that if Mr. Blaino shoud withdraw
from tho presidential arena, as some
rumors assert ho will, it will insure
President Harrison's rcnomination, but
it adds:
..ill. it may be questioned whether cer
tain Republican eneir.irs of the administra
tion who have declared for Mr. Rising are
not planning to use the latter's popularity
to build up an anti-I larrion organization
with a view to combating the President,
even if the Secretary of State shall decline
to tako the nomination.
Whatever "certain Republican ene
mies of the administration" may be
planning to do in this regard, they will
not succeed in doing anything. If Mr.
Blaino should signify his purposo to be
come a candidate or his willingness to
accept tho nomination he would become
at once a very formidable candidate by
reason of his great personal popularity
and following. But this is not true of
any other person who has been named
by the Republican critics or opponents
of the administration. The name of
Rlnino is all that gives n particle of
vitality to their movement. If he should
withdraw it would collapse instantly.
The fact that the payments of the
Treasury are so much less the last six
months than during tho corresponding
six months of last year has disturbed
the Democratic organs, leading them to
resort to their old game of misrepre
sentation. The Chicago Times says
that the decreased payments are due to
the fact that tho Treasury is not paying
its creditors and that pensions are being
withheld. On tho other hand, the
Financial Chroniclo of New York,
which is supposed to have knowledgo of
such subjects as it treats of, declares
that tho payments of the government
are much less this year than last. The
administration has a good many sur
prises for the Democrats.

The President's message was written by

that so many of the other kind of fellows
have been placed in a position to negative

Tiik message of President Harrison is a
thoroughly American idocument, in every
lino of which the spirit of patriotic desire
for the public weal is so clearly expressed
that "he who runs may read." New York

It is the sort of message that will com

The third annual message of Mr. Harri

The Michigan system is not in itself ob

Mr. Harrison's message to Congress

When President Harrison was inaugu
rated it was said that he intended to give
the people a business man's administration.

The President's message is a careful,

TnE one characteristic of President Har

presses every candid reader - is its absolute
freedom from partisanship or prejudice.
Thero is in it no straining for effect. It is

suggestions, and so dispassionate that its
perusal, after the crazy factional contests

American sailors in Valparaiso. Both are
treated in a tlm, dignified and, at the

Professor Woodburn's Sixth Lecture in the
University Extension Course.
The sixth lecture in the university ex
tension course on American political his
tory was "given, last night, in the Propy
lamine The subject of the lecture was "The
Financial Measures of Hamilton." Before
tho lecture the usual meeting of the class
was held for a discussion of and a "quiz"
npon the lecture of last -week. There was
noticeable, in both lecture and class-work,
but especially in the latter, a feeling of
better acquaintance, less stiffness, and con
sequently more freedom in discussion and
in advancing individual opinions. Con
trary to expectations, there seems to be no
lagging in either interest or attendance.
In the lecture Dr. Woodburn said: Our
study to-night is a study of history and
finance. It has been said Gladstone
possesses the rare faculty of making even
a budget eloquent. Not possessing the
ability of so great a genius the facts and
figures of this lectnre may prove dull.
However, we areconsoled withthefact that
earnest people are always interested in im
portant things. A large part of
history has been made in tho
attempt to settle questions concerning
finances and taxes, borne things are the
concern of many, some the concern of few,
but money is the concern of all.
Our Secretary of State is the most im
portant of our Cabinet oflicers, but three
times in our history has the treasury port
folio been most important; from to
1T97, under Hamilton; from 1S03 to 1813,
under Gallatin, and from 1861 to 1864, under
Chase. These three have taken precedence,
and the greatest of these is Hamilton. It
is the duty of the Treasurer, ordinarily, to
keep the machine in order. Hamilton had
to make the machine. Without precedent
or data to guide, lie was to bring order out
of disorder. "He and he alone was com
petent for the task."
His first report contained measures
which he propoted to ;pVovide for the pub
lio debt and to sustain the public credit.
The public debt was shown to be. in round
numbers, $$0,000. UOO an enormous sum to
the new government theu just beginning to
be. Our government now collects and dis
burses 450, 000,000 a year, and a single Con
gress may appropriate a billion dol
lars facts which show- the remarkable
growth of the country. Tho report pro
posed (1) full payment of the foreign debt;
(2), the funding of the domestio debt; (2).
that domestio cieditors be paid in full
and (4), the assumption of the State debts.
The last two were violently opposed, bat
by tho matchless argument of Hamilton
all other schemes' were proved futile, and
they were finally adopted. The assumption
of the State debts was accomplished by a
political deal by which Jeflerson was to use
his influence in favor of the assumption in
return for Hamilton's influence in favor of
the location of the capital at Washington.
In his second report Hamilton proposed
(1) the excise tax as a means of raising rev
enue, which was opposed by the South and
Pennsylvania, (2) the tantl a tariff for
revenue, with only incidental protection,
and (3) the United States Bank. The last
measure met with violent opposition. Mad
ison opposed it on constitutional grounds,
basing his argument on that section which
says: "All powers not delegated are re
tained, etc." In the defense of its consti
tutionality Hamilton advanced tho doc
trine of "implied powers" an argument
which no judicial decision has ever shaken,
or will shake.
Webster said of Hamilton: "He smote
the rook of public resource and abundant
streams of revenue burst forth. He touched
the dead corpse of publio credit and it im
mediately sprang up."

C0U0NIAL FEES ARE FAT.
Dr. Mankpr Crowded Ninety-Three Days Into
One 3Ionth Fifty-Three Allowed.
. The County Commissioners yesterday
considered the bill of Dr. Manker. coroner,
for the month of November. It aggregated
$120 for ninety-three days' work. It struck
the board as singular that eo many days
could bo crowded into one month, and a
reduction of W, leaving tho amount $200,
wasmadoin the bill, after which it was
allowed. This gives the coroner tifty-threo
days' service, which, while it may be with
in the meaning of the statute regulat
ing coronial fees, still distends a
month of time. Attorney Brown is
not satisfied as to what the meaning of the
law is, and will propose to Coroner Manker
that a cake he agreed upon and sent to the
Superior Conrt for adjudication. The cor
oner's allowances amount to S.i) per month
on the average. "It is the board's opinion."
said Mr. Brown, "that, even with the de

The Sixteenth-Street Controversy Mat
ters Before the Board cf Workf.
The Board of Publio Safety held a meet
ing last evening to take action on the mem
bers of the fire and police departments
who were tried last Wednesday. Patrol
men Jesse Settle and Louis Anderson were
charged with sleeping on duty. They were
found about 1 o'clock in the morning by
Sergeant Hagerdora. in a livery stable,
on Seventh street, Anderson was sit
ting in the ollice in the oark asleep,
when his superior oCiccr entered. Settle
had gone into the wash-room where there
was a fire. When put on the stand these,
patrolmen frankly admitted that, the
charge was true, only saying in extenuation
of their condoct tba.k Settle was sick and
needed a little rest at the time they entered
the barn.
Dennis ITemming. the fireman, was
charged with being absent from duty
without leave. He said he had bea given
six hours oil. but had orerstaid the time.
He th rew himself on the board's mercy,
l'ntrolman Bat Landers, also charged with
absenting himself from dutv without leave,
admitted the charge, but pleaded some ex
tenuating circumstances.
Last evening the board decided to rein
state patrolmen Settle and Landers and fire
man Fleming with a reprimand, but in tho
case of Anderson, who was once before,
nine months ago, found asleep on dnty by
Sergeant Lowe, it was decided to
u6e somewhat harsher measures. Ho
will remain under suspension for
some time. President Hawkins, in
speaking of these cases, said, to a Journal
reporter: "It is not our intention to bo
loose in tho matter of discipline, but wo
think it can be maintained and still allow
a sense of humanity to enter into
our judgment There were ame
liorating circumstances surronndinc
these cases. Each man frankly
confessed his guilt and throw himself on
the mercy of the board. Then they are all
young and have families to support, and it
is-jmt coming on winter. The testimony
showed that the men are all good olhcern.
and 1 do not think they will make any
moro such mistakes."
Question of Suburban Plats.
It has recently come to the knowledgo of
the Board of Publio Works, through the
county recorder, that for some time persons
have been platting small strip of territory
adjacent to North Indianapolis and other
suburbs, yet coming within the four-mile
radius over which the Board of Publio
Works has supervision in such matters,
calling them additions, and having them
approved aa such by the recorder without
submitting them to the board. The re
corder has complained that the custom is
causing him embarrassment, and yesterday
the board directed a communication to
City Attorney Bailey, asking him if these
persons have a legal right to file plats of'
these additions with the recorder. The re
cent annexations of territory lend
an added interest to this question.
Another letter was also directed to the city
attorney stating that it had been reported
to the board that parties interested in plat
ting additions to the city outside
tho city limits have been in the
habit of bringing their plat to the board
for approval and afterward taking it be
fore the County Commissioners and having
the streets changed in width, etc. Tho
board therefore asks the question; 'lla
the Board of Public Works or the County
Commissioners jurisdiction in the matter of
plats to the city of Indianepolist" This
matter was brought to the board's atten
tion . by W. V. Booker, attorney for the .
Braces, who came in yesterday again to see
about the roadway of Sixteenth street It
Is proposed by the Citizens' company to pnt
In a curve at College avenue and Sixteenth
street and run the line west to Central ave
nue. It was the intention of tho
board to have the roadway of Six
teenth street twenty-four feet, but if
the curve is put in the width will have to
be increased. The matter has not yet been
definitely settled. If the board can in
crease the width of the roadway without
changing the specifications it wilt

work.
