ALEXANDBIA.
FRIDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 9.
The President, iD his late message to
Cmgress, says: "it must be conceded that
none of the things subjected to internal rev?
enue taxation are, strictly speaking, necer
sarits ; there appears to be no just com
plaint of this taxation by the consumers ol
these articles, aDd there seems to be noth
ing do well able to bear the burden without
hudship to aDy portion of the people."
That's plain enough for those who run to
read. The President was elected by the na
tional democratic party, and hla policy i;
eupp .rted by that party. And yet a leading
democratic member of the Virginia Stat(
Senate, a representative of the capita! citj
of the State, yesterday introduced a resolu
tion into that body, "requesting the mem
herd of Congress fjprn Virgioia to domanc
and endeavor to secure the immediate te
peal of the intornal revenue pyetem, becausi
it is no lender necessary, is oppressive ant
footers monopolies, and is obnoxious to th<
interests of our people," and a similar res?
iutiuu passed the democratic Hou-e of Dele
gates with only one dissenting vote. Then
ii thus evidently a wide difference on tin
.subject referred to between the Pr?siden
nud the democratic members of the Virginh
legislature ; but that at least on the specie
matter referred to, tho former is the bette
democrat, few real democrats entertain
doubt. _
A highly re3peoted democratic friem
wtitento th^(?A7.kttk,inetrut,that he agree
With the national democratic adminNtrs
tion. aud also with the State democracy c
Virginia. Io view of the facts that the form
er is opposed to a prottoiive tariff and is ii
favor of tie internal revenue system, whil
thd latter is in favor of n protective taril
and i? opposed to the internal revenue ays
tern, and that while the former says part;
service must not be rewarded with effice
the latter has just rewarded Mr. Harbour'
parly service with the highest office at thei
disposal, bow he can do so, be can tell bette
than auy one else.
TtiK democratic members of the Legi.-da
lature, at their caucus la3t night, uomiLaiei
Mr. Barbcur for U. 8.Senator,without a die
Heuling vote. As the nomination is equiva
leat to an election, the compliment was a
distioguiahid as the reward was well tie
served. Mr. Hat baur has rendered the dem
ocrutic purty of Virginia great service, and
des riog to requite that service to the ut
most,extent of their n.eans, their represent
ativos in the Legislature bavo conferrei
upon him tho highest honor within thei
gift. That he will wear it becomingly al
familiar wiih him are oonGdent.
The PRESIDENT recommends that th
expenses of the govertroent be met by
tax on whiekey, cigars and cigarettes, an
not by a tax on what everybody, men 8
well as women and children, must consum
in oider to live. The Rcaucke convenlior
on the contrary, declared for fiee whiskev
cigars and cigarettes, and tor a tax on th
necessaries of life. That tb? rtcommeude
lions of the President are moru democrat'
than the declaration of tbe conventjc-n, aL(
be patent even to those wh? "*Q
supported the latter.
-oD, in view of the exis:
At thk brstjf municipal taxution, then
ing high_rjj plausible reasou for opposinf
wcli'til now before the Legislature for ic
creasing tho Balary of the judge ot tbe Cor
poration Court of this city; hut when tbe
facts that the best legal talent cannot he pro
cured for tho present -alary, and that noth
iogia nioie i'juiious to n city than an in?
competent judge, are considered, the objec?
tion to the proposed slight increase will be
dissipated. _
Before the abolition of slavery, the ma
jorily of the convicts in the S ate peniten'
tiary were white. On the 1st instact, ao
cording to the Governor's mtssage, of tbe
960, 100 were white and 770 colored. In
the meantime tho ratio of the colored to the
white people of the Slate has diminished.
This does no! indicate that freedom and
free schooVhave improved the moral condi
tion of the colored population ef Virginia.
The rep; rucans have determined to
have their next, as their previous, national
convention at Chicago. It would be just as
well if the democrats should have theirs at
some other place. And then, too, as Illinois
is bound to go republieau next fall, the
party cau profit nothing by having it there.

The eudu^ement of General Mahoue by
all exce;>t one of the tepublican represent
fives in Congtess, aud by six members of
the Virgiuia legislature, preseuted to tbe na
tional republican committ: e yesterday, is tbe \
subject of a good dial of comment at the
Capitol to day. Mr. Gaiues of the Peters
burg district, oue of the lepresentatives re?
ferred to, being asked about it this morning,
said he and bis colleagues, Browne, Bowden,
Brown and Boweo ; .?State Senators Hodges,'
Gee and Hubard, and Delegates Martin,
Elam aud Treat appeared before tbe nation?
al republican c< n n?iie? yesteiday. with a
papor indorsing tieueral Mahone and his
management of tbe party in the past, aud
recommending tbe General to the recogni?
tion of tho national republican committee
as tbe bead and front of the party in Vir
ginia. He said Mr. Elam read tbe paper,
and that it waa applauded throughout!
Continuing, Mr. Ga'uesstaid that tu? per
onal relations letw ou biuiae'.t aid Gsneial
Mahone had not been friendly for acme
ilmp past, but he knew of no other member
id the party in Virginia who ocuid tin the
place ?8 the bead thereof a-* well as the \
Oerjeral. He said the few ki'keis
did not amount to much. Ho aho
said that General Mahone would re?
ceive the solid vote of the republican mem?
bers of lbe "Virginia legislature for ?. 8.
Senator. With regard to the proposed con?
gressional candidacy of Professor Langeton,
tbe colored ox principal of the coloieil nor?
mal school at Petersborg. Mr. Gaioes said
the Professor hail not, during his residency
in bia district, ingratiated himself with the
republican party, and that the people of his
district were not apt to make strangers their
representatives in Congreep. Ex-Congrese
man Bracy, of tho same district, now here,
being subsequently talked to on the same
subject, eaid that ex-Attorney General Frank
Blair, the Virginia member of the national
repub ican committee, had told him the
paper referred to was not read to the com?
mittee, that the committee did not want
to hear it, and that Mr. E^am was
only allowed to make a short statement.
Mr. Brady t-aid tneecheme to reinstate Gen.
MahoDe os the leader of the party, would
not only fail, but would react injuriously
upon those engaged in it. Senator Ridd'e
berger was aleo interviewed on the same
subject. Ho said he had not seen the paper
rtfet red to, but bad heard of it, and that the
Congressmen who had signed it?whose
names are mentioned above?are known to
have entertained entirely diilVrent views a
short time ago. As to the statement that
General Mahone would receive ibe votes ol
all ihe itpublican members of the legisla
tute, he said he knew too much about tbose
members to believe all that. Mr. Bounds,
a leading lepublicou of the 8th Congrere'on
al district of Virginia, being talked to on
thesamosubject.euid if there were aMahone
and an anli-Mahcne party in Virginia, be
w uld have to be included nraong the latter,

Republican Party of Virgin in.
At the meeting of tho na'.ioual republican
committee in Washington yesterday, Wro.
C. Elam, of Louisa co., presented an argu?
ment in favor of the republican party of
Virginia. He waa accompanied, he said, by
members of theSeuate and House of Rep
resentatives of Virginia, and by its five cr
six republic in members of Congress, and
they represented the republican party of
Virginia. Ho read a paper whioh had been
preparod in the form of an address to the
committee, and which resumed the history
of the republican party in the State since
1S78. Under the old management the
party had betn S) badly beaten ia 1S7G that
it had become disheartened and demor?
alized. In 1S7S the chairman of tbe State
executive commitle had united with the
democrats io au effort to orgauiz3 a new
party. Local influences, which had beeu
s:eadily at work, bad resulted in 1S79 in the
disruption of the Virginia democracy. The
republican rank and G!e had gone over to
Mahone, while tho others had joined with
the extreme Bom boas. The republicans
I had, from thnt lime until 1S8U, abandoned j
the field to tbe foe. Tbe election in Vir
J ginia this year had been egregicusly misre?
presented. They had carried 5G out of 100
counties; had elected 10 out of 19 Senators,
and carried 7 out of 10 congressional dis?
tricts. And all this tbey had dono with
strict bona fide republican votes. He stated
these facts to show that tho national repub'
Mean orgauizition of Virginia was not in*
efficient or unsuccessful, and to demonstrate
Ibatwith the cordial recognition and sup?
port of the national republican party Vir
{ ginia would give her eiecloral votes next
1 year to the republican candidate for the
' presidency.

! LETTER FROM RICHMOND.
j ISpecial Cor. of tho Alexandria Gazetts.
Richmond, Va.. Dec. Sth.?Tbe Legisla?
tive wheels are not yet greased, so to (peak,
and it will .be several days before the body
will settle down regularly to work. About
the tirst bill introduced in either branch of
the General Assembly this session was tho
one to increase the salary of the judge of
the Corporation Court of the city of Alexan?
dria, and it is understood that similar bills
affecting tbe salaries of tbe judges of other
cities of tbe Commonwealth wiil follow in
regular order. I have talked with a number
of tbe legislators upou the subject of increas?
ing the salaries of all tho judges in the State
and as far as i can see there is a strong dis?
position among the members to vote for such
a measure if there is any possibility of the
money being forthcoming. It has been tbe
opinion of every legislature that has assem?
bled during tbe past eight years that the
judges in this State are the most poorly paid
officials ol all, taking into consideration the
dignity and the importance attached to the
office.
The Petersburg Normal School embroglio
may, perhaps, end in a legislative investi?
gation. Dangston, who, by the way, is re?
garded here as tbe most intelligent repre?
sentative of his race in this State, has some
bitter enemies, and, to use tbe language ol
one who seems to be opposed to him, "he
bas a hard rosd to travel." The Petersburg
Normal School has had many drawbacks in
the way of bad officials since it was estab?
lished, and it remains to be seen whether
any such officers ate yet remaining there.
Delegate Curtis, of Richmond, is very
anxious to amend the pilot laws of Virginia,
and four years ago, when he served his first
term in the House, he made a big fight in
this direction. Mr. Curtis's re-election this
year has caused parties interested in pilot
boats to come here early, so as to be on
the ground when Mr. Curtis again
intrcduces the bill which put them
upon their mettle four years ago, and which
did not lack very many votes of becomiug a
law. Mr. Curtis thiDks the pilot boat peo?
ple are nothing more than thorns in the
side of Virginia's commercial prosperity. Ol
course the Norfolk and Portsmouth dele?
gates will vote against aoy hill looking to a
repeal of the law as suggested by Mr. Cui
tis, because it will take employment away
< from the crews of tbe pilot boats who live in
these two cities by tbe sea. If lam not
mistaken I think the city of Alexandria it
interested in this matter, in the sime way
that the city of Richmond is. Whether il
is pro or con will have to be determined by e
majority in the General Assombly.
There is a marked difference between the
feeling of the legislators dow upon the debt
question from what it was during the extra
session when the joint commission was ap?
pointed to confer with the representatives
of the council of foreign bondholders. Some
members are so overjoyed at the recent de
cision of the United Slates Supreme Court
in the Virginia habeas corpus cases that
' they are ready and willing to scale the prin?
cipal of the debt down a little lower thnn i?
sat forth in the Riddleberger bill. Those
who talk this way, however, have hereto
fore been tainted with repudiation. Aa Mr
Royall, tbe counsel for tha bondholders, has
asked for an exteusion of time in regard ti
the enforcement cf the Act of May 12.h
1SS7, the repudialiocrtaiutod delegates are
disposed to wait awhile befoie proposing
any debt schemes. B. P. 0.
Interviews.?Interviews were held ir.
Richmond yesterday with Gov. Lee and Lt
Governor Massey, iu reference to tbe Pres
I leDt's message, in which the former sab
he had just competed his own message anc
was overwhelmed with work incident to tb<
assembling of the legislature. ' Owing it
these circumstances," said the Governor: "]
have not as yet had timo to carefully roac
the President's message. For thwreason 1
would rather not eTJ)r*as my opiuion now."
?'-imal,'*' ahKed tho interviewer, "will in
your opinion be the effect of a failure
of CougrcsH to remove the tax ou tobacco
and fruit brandies?" "No action in thai
respect." responded the Oovernor, "would
make Virginia a very doubtful State in the
presidential election. I believe that the
President would approve legislative action
locking in that direction, if adopted. The
democrats have oo feats of Mr. Blaino,"
added Gen. Lee. ' He has been on nearly
all?fii(lea of every important question before
tbe country."
Lieut -Governor John E Ma86ey said :
"Tbe desire of President Cleveland, aa
shown in his recent message, to stop the at -
cumulation of surplus revenue in the
treasury, should he universally com?
mended. Every man ehouid indorse
the sentiment that no more should be
demanded from tbe people, in any form,
than is necessary to economically mair
tain the government. His advocacy of
a proner revision of I he tariff laws is wise
and timely, and especially should his advo
cacy of euch a revision as will justly pre?
lect both those w?o produce and those
who consumb be seconded by our lawmakers.
I regret that by implication he seems to favor
a continuation of the internal revenue tax.
It may be true that 'none of the things sub?
jected to internal revenue taxation are,
strictly speaking, necessaries,' but their
productions are important industries, which
are greatly damaged by this oppressive,
unjust and discriminating tax. Moreover, it
is a war measure and ought, as every other
relic of the war, to be buried out of sight.
No necessity exists for its continuance, aud
tbe whole system should be wiped out."

figure, seated cu a high hacked throne, \~

Tho head resembles that of the Olympian
Jove. Tho left arm is missing, but from the
position of tho socket, it must have been
raised on high, and probably held a scepter,

as if the housewife bad yesterdsy taken them

plates or saucers, with fin-ly chiseled rins,
bearing a pattern of Miage, Mowers, :wai -

The Queen Would Feel Hfrt.-a
friend of mine told mejof a pathetic, incident
that took place tbe other evening when the
Britishers were being naturallzer1. One old
fellow could not see the print o'j thei natur?
alization paper, so he got a friend to rend it.
When the words "rcnouce forever all alle
gance and fidelity to every foreign prince,
state, potentate and sovereign ty whatsoever
?moro especially to Victoria, queen of tho
unitedkingdomofgrent Britain and Ireland,"
were reached?the old man's eyes grew
moist, and he said with a tone of sadness in
bis voice: "I've been a,faitbfu! subject of her
for more thaa thirty-five years, and I don't
know how she'll feei about it." But then
the thought of thei republic where he had
made bis homo for years came to him and
rubbing his big hand across his> eyes, be
signed the paper that made him a citizen, I
repeat the story because it seems to me to
illustrate so well the pecular feeling of loyal?
ty which animates an Englishman, not only
toward his "tight little isle," but toward the
sovereign who repreeeats its govern nient.
