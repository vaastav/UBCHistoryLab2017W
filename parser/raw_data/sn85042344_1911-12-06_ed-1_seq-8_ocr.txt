The statute In Its Mist section dt

Combination In the form of trust or
otherwise or conspiracy in restraint
of trade or commerce among the sev
oral states or with foreign nations"
and in the second declares guilty of a
misdemeanor "every person who shall
monopolise or attempt to monopolise
or combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolise any part of the
trade or commerce of the s,. ci al slates
or with foreign nation."

Fores and Effectiveness of Statute
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty one years mak
ing this statute effective for the pur
pM.es tor w hh li It was enacted. The
Knight case was discouraging and
seemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
the evils of (he trusts. Slowly. bOWBV
er. the error of that Judgment wits cor
rected, and only In the hist three or
four years has the heavy hand of tin
law been laid upon the great illegal
combinations that have exercised such
an absolute dominion over many of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and n number are pond
ing. but Juries have felt averse to eon
Victlhg f"r jail Sentences and Judges
i. i i- been most reluctant to impose
SUCh sentences on men of respectable
staminig in society whose offense has

I still, as tin- offense becomes better un-

takes more of studied ami deliberate
defiance of the law we can be confi
dent that Juries will convict Individu
als and that Jail sentences will lie hit
posed.

chief!) gaged in the manufacture
ami sale of chewing and smoking to
bacco and cigars. The former one tin
foil company Is divided Into two, one
if 82S,000 capital and the other of
(400. 000 Tl tie snuff company Is
divided Into three companies, one with
a capital of (16,000,000, another with a
capital of tg.OOO.OQO and a third with
it capital of 8,000,00a The licorice
Companies are two, one with a capital
of 15,758,800 and another with n capi
tal of 12,000,000. There Is also the
British American Tobacc mpnny, n
British corporation, doing business
broad with a capital of (88,000,000,
tin- 1'orto Khan Tobacco company,
with a capital of (1.800,000, and the
corporation of United Cigar Stores,
with a capital of (9,000,000.
Coder this arrangement each of the
different kinds of business will be dls
tributed between two or more compa
nies with a division of the prominent
brands In the same tobacco products,
so as to make competition not only
possible, but necessary. Thus the
snicking tobacco business of the conn
try Is divided so that the present In
dependent companies have 21.89 per
cent, w hile the American Tobacco com
pany Will have 88.08 per cent, the Lig
gett & Meyers 20.00 per cent, the lyiill
lard company 22.83 per cent and the
Reynolds company 2.00 per cent. The
stock of the other thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, has been
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company and has been dis
tributed among its stockholders, All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared null and further per
formance of them has been enjoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies has now been given voting
power which was denied It under the
Old organization. The ratio of the pre
ferred stock to the common was its 7S
to 40, Tills constitutes tt very decided
change In the character of the owner
ship and control of each company
In the original suit then- Were twen
ty nine defendants, who were charged
With being the conspirators through
whom the illegal combination acquired
and exen Ised its unlawful dominion-
t inier the decree those defendants will
hold amounts of stock In the various
distributee companies ranging from 41
per cent as a maximum to '2S' per
cent as a minimum, except In the case
of one small company, the l'orto Itlt-nn
Tobacco company! In which they will
hold 49 per cent. The twenty-nine In
dividual defendants are cn.loitu-d for
three years from buying any stock m
ci p- front each other, and the group Is
thus pl-eveflted from extending itscoil

I restore to say thai not In hie

more effective for such a purp ii
entered by a court than that a It si

Noyaj said in his Judgment sp "ing

the attendant burdens ought todi non

stands on tho statute hooks Bust be

La k of Definitsnses In the Statute.
Tba complaint is madg of tin- stat
ito that It Is not Nullkleutly definite
lu Its description of that which Is for
bidden to enable business men to avoid
Us violation. The suggestion Is that
we may have a coiubltiutloti of two
corporations which may run on for
years and that suliKeipiently the at
torney general may conclude that It
was n violation of the statute and that
Which was supposed by the combiners
to ba Innocent then turns out to be a
combination in violation of tin- statute
The answer to this hypothetical case
Is that when aicu attempt to BOMBS
such stupendous capital as will enable
then tO suppress competition, control
prices and establish n monopoly they
know ti:o purpose "f their acts. Men
do not do SUCh n thing without having
it clearly In mind. If what they do Is
inertly for the purposo of reducing the
n t of i roilui tlon, without the thought
of suppressing competition by use of the
bigness of the plant they tire creating,
then they cannot be convicted tit the
time the union Is made, nor can they
be convicted later unless It happen
that later on they conclude to sup
press competition and take the usual
methods for doing so and thus estah-ll-li
for themselves it monopoly. They
ciiu In such n case hardly complain If
the motive which subsequently is dis-
But now that the antl-tn I set is seen to be effective for the accom
plishment of the purpose of its snactment we are met by a ory from many
different quarters for its repe. It ie said to be obstructive of business
progress, to be an attempt to restore old fashioned methods of destructive
competition between small III tt and to make impossible those useful
combinations of capital and thS reduction of the cost of production that
are essential to continued pros ierity and normal growth.
I venture to say that not in tho history ot American law hat a decree
more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that
against the tobacco trust.

the dissolution of this combination, di

holders, and the corporations and 1 nt 1 1
Vidual defendants Here enjoined from
conspiring or Combining to restore
such monopoly, and all agreements he
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
lug to produce or bring about further
violations of the act were enjoined
In the tObaCCO case the court found
that the Individual defendants, twen
ty nine In number, had been engaged
In a successful effort to acquire com
plete dominion over the manufacture,
sale and distribution of tobacco lu this
Conntrj and abroad and that this had
been done by combinations made with
a purpose and effect to stifle competi
tion, control pticoa and establish a
monopoly, not only In the ttiatiitfnCtasTg
of tObqCCO, but hIso of tin foil and lic
orice usci in its nanufactura and of
Its products of cigars, cigarettes and
snuffs. The tobiicco suit presented a
far more complicated and difficult onso
than the Standard Ot I stilt for a decree
which would effectuate the will of the
court and end the violation of the stat
utn. There was here no single hold
lag company, as lu tha case of the
combination between any of the com
panies In VtolatiQn of the rtatute by
way of resumption of the old trust.
Bach of the fourteen companies is en
joined from acquiring stock in any of
the others. All these companies tire
enjoined from having common direc
tors or 0 (Accra or common buying or
selling agents, or common offices, or
lending money to each other.
Sue of New Companies.
Objection was made by certain In
dependent tobacco companies that this
sett lenient was unjust because II left
companies with very large capital in
active business and that the settle
tnCO.1 that would be effective to put all
on an equality would be a division of
the capital and plant of the trust Into
small fractious In amount more near
ly equal to that of each of the Inde
pendent companies. Tills contention
results from ti misunderstanding of
the nnti trust law and Its purpose. It
Is not intended thereby t prevent the
accumulation of large capital In busi
ness enterprises in which such a com
bination .an secure reduced cost of
i lion, sale and distribution. It
Is din-, ted against such an BggrUgO
Ltoa Of capital only when Its purpQM
Is that of stifling competition, enhanc
im or controlling prices and establish
ing a monopoly. If we shall have by
the decree defeated these purposes
allies. And, on the other hand, the
successful reconstruction of this or
ganization should teach that the effect
of enforcing this statute Is not to de
stroy, but to reconstruct; not to de
molish, but to recreate in accordance
with tbe conditions which the congress
has declared shall exist among the
people of the United States."
Common Stook Ownership.
it has been assumed that tbe pres
ent pro rata and common ownership In
all these eompntiles by former stock
holders of the trust would Insure a
continuance of the same old single con
trol of all the Companies into which
the trust has by decree been disinte
grated. This Is erroneous and Is based
upon the assumed Inettloacy and Innoc
UOUBneaS Of Judicial Injunctions. The
companies are enjoined from coopera
tion or combination; they have differ
ent managers, directors, purchasing
and sales agents. If nil or many of
tho numerous stockholders, reaching
Into the thousands, attempt to secure
. on. cried action of the companies with
a view to the control of the market
their number Is so large that su. h an
attempt could not well be concealed,
and its in line movers and all Its partic
ipants w ould be at once subject to con
tempt proceedings and Imprisonment
Of a summary character. The Itumcdl
ate result of the present situation will
necessarily be activity by all the com
panies under different managers, and
then competition must follow or there
will lie activity by oue company and
Stagnation by another. Only a short
time will Inevitably lead to a change
in ownership of the stock, as all op
portunlly for continued cooperation
must disappear. Those critics who
speak of this disintegration in t he trust
as a mere change of garments have not
given consideration to the Inevitable
working of the deem- and understand
little the personal danger of attempt
Ing to evade or set at naught the sol
emn Injunction of n court whose object
Is made plain by the decree and whose
inhibitions are set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled In
the history of equity jurisprudence.
Voluntary Reorganizations of Other
Trusts at Hand.
The effect of these two decisions has
led to decrees dissolving the comlii. n
tlon of manufacturers of electric
lamps, a southern wholesale grocers'
association, an interlocutory decree
agglnat the powder trust, with direc
tions by tbe circuit court compelling
dissolution, ami oilier combinations of
a similar history ure now negotiating
with the depart uient of Justice looking
to a disintegration by decree and re
organization In accordance with law
It seems possible to bring about these
reorganisations without general busl
ness disturbance.
Movement For Repeal of the Anti
trust Law.
Hut now that the anti trust net la
seen to be effective for the accomplish
ment of the purpose of Its enactment
WO are met by a cry from many dllter
ent quarters foi Ita repeal. It Is said
to be obstructive of business pi-ogress,
to be an attempt to restoro old fash
ioned methods of destructive competl
tton between small units and to make
impossible those useful combinations
of capital and the reduction of the cost
of production that aro essential to cm
tinned prosperity and normal growth.
In the recent decisions the supremo
court makes clear that thero Is noth

tion is lu contravention of the statute

original combination
New Remedies Suggested.
Much is snid of the repeal of this
stnl ute and of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish the purpose
and blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business men to follow. It
may bo that such a plan will be
evolved, but 1 submit that the discus
sions which have been brought out In
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti-trust law
have produced nothing but glittering
generalities and have offered no line
of distinction or rule of action as defi
nite nud as clear as that which tho su
preme court itself lays down in en
forcing the statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not
Repeal or Amendment.
I see no objection, nnd Indeed I can
see decided advantages, In the enact
ment of a law which shall describe
and denounce methods of cnmpetltipu
which tire unfair and are badges of the
unlawful purpose denounced In the
nnti trust law. The attempt and pur
pose to suppress a competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofita
ble as to drive hint out of business or
the making of exclusive contracts with
customers tinder which they are re
quired to give up association with oth
er manufacturers and numerous kin
dred methods for stifling comnetitlon
and effecting monopoly should be de
scribed with sutllcient accuracy in a
criminal statute on the one hand to
enable the government to shorten Its
task by prosecuting single misdemean
ors Instead of an entire conspiracy and
with respect to Us purely I. cal busl
ness.

Is sultahls constructive legislation
It is tald that the act has not done good. Can this be said In the face
of ths effect of the Northern Securities deorae? That decree was in no
way so draatio or inhlbitlv in detail as either the Standard Oil decrae or
the tobaooo decrae, but did it not atop for all time the then powerful
movement toward the control of all the railroads of tee country in a sin
gle hand? Suoh a one man power oould not have been a healthful Influ
ence in the republic, even though extroised under the general supervision
of an Interatate oommiealon.
such mi effective agency In the crea
tion of the great trusts and monopo
lies, "If the prohibition of the nnti (rust
(01 against combinations In restraint
of trade Is to be effectively enforced
It Is essential that the national govern
ment shall provide for tho creation of
national corporations to carry on a le
gitimate business throughout the Unit
ed States. Tho conflicting laws of the
different states of the Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make It
difficult If not Impossible, for one cor
poration to comply With their require
ments so as to carry on business in n
number of different stales."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general luw providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage In trade and com
merce among the stales and with for
eign nations. Every argument which
was then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which was at that
time offered to possible objections has
been confirmed by our experience since
the enforcement of the nnti trusl stat
ute has resulted In the, actual dissolu
tion of active commerclu! organizations.
It Is even more manifest now than
It was then that the denunciation of
conspiracies lu restraint of trade
should no and does not moan tbe de
nial of organizations large enough to
be intrusted with our Interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than It wns then that a
purely negative statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for the building
up and regulation of legitimate na
tional nnd foreign commerce.
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Aid Courts In Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decrees In the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view to their reorganization Into le
gitimate corporations, has made It es
pecially apparent that the courts are
not provided with the administrative
machinery to make the necessary In
quiries preparatory to reorganization
or to pursue such inquiries, and they
should be empowered to Invoke the
aid of the bureau of corporations in
determining the suitable reorganiza
tion of the disintegrated parts. The
circuit court and the attorney general
were greatly aided in framing the de
cree In the tobacco trust dissolution by
nn expert from the bureau of corpora
tions. Federal Corporation Commission Pro

on tin? other hand to serve the purpose
of pointing out more In dv-tnil to
the business community what must be
avoided,
Federal Incorporation Recommended.
In a special message to congress on
.Ian. 7, IB10, I ventured to point out
the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. I said:
"Hut such an Investigation nnd pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction nffeets the
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily tend to disturb the confidence
of the business community, to dry gp
the now flowing sources of capital
from Its places of hoarding nnd pro
duce a halt in our present prosperity
that will cause suffering and strained
circumstances among the Innocent
tunny for the faults of the guilty few.
The tpiestion which I wish In this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
Is whether. In order to avoid such n
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which thesje busi
ness combinations may be offered n
means, without great flnnncinl dis
turbance, of changing the character,
organization and extent of their busi
ness Into one within the Hues of tbe
law under federal control and super
vision, securing compliance with the
anti trust statute.
"(lenerally In the Industrial combina
tions called 'trusts' the principal busi
ness Is the sale of gotsls In many states
and in foreign markets In other words,
the Interstate and foreign business far
exceeds the business done In any one
state. This fact will Justify the fed
eral government In granting a federal
charier to such a combination to make
and sell In Interstate and foreign com
merce the products of useful manufac
ture under such limitations as will so
cure a compliance with the anti trust
law. It Is possible so to frame a stat
ute that, while It offers protection to s
federal company against harmful, vex
atious and unnecessary Invasion by the
states, tt shall subject It to reasona
ble taxation and control by tbe states
supply the constructive legislation per
mltiing and aiding the formation of
combinations of capital Into federal
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid rules as to their organization
and procedure, Including effective pub
licity, and to thu closest supervision as
to the Issue of stock nud bonds by an
executive bureau or commission In the
department of commerce and Tabor, to
which In times of doubt they might
wcli submit their proposed plans for
future business. It must be distinctly
understood that Incorporation under a
federal taw could not exempt the com
pany tints formed nnd Its Incorporators
and managers from prosecution under
the nutl-lrust law for subsequent Il
legal conduct, but the publicity of Its
procedure and the opportunity for fre
quent constilintlon with the bureau or
commission in charge of the Incorpora
tion as to the legitimate purpose of its
transactions would offer It as great se
curity against successful prosecutions
for violations of the law as would be
prat ileal or wise.
Such a bureau or commission might
well be invested also with the duty
already referred to of aiding courts'
in the dissolution and recreation of
trusts within the law. It should ho an
executive tribunal of the dignity and
power of the comptroller of the cur
rency or the interstate commerce com
mission, which now exercises supervis
ory power over Important classes of
corsrations under federul regulation.
The drafting of such n federal in
corisiratlou law would offer ample op
portunity to prevent many manifest
evils In corporate management today,
Including Irresponsibility of control In
the hands of the few who are not the
real owners.
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experlenro justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
lie derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of such
a charter would attract all who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fall to take advantage of the federal
incorporation will not have a right to
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great industrial enterprises to the rule
of action laid down by the anti trust
luw. This statute ns construed by tho
supreme curt must continue to be tint
line of distinction for legitimate busi
ness It must be enforced unless we
are to banish individualism from all
business and reduce It to one common
syatam of regulation or control ot
prices like that which now prevails
with respect to public utilities and
which when npplietl to all business
would be a long step toward state so
cialism. Importance of the Anti-trust Act.
The anti trust act Is tbe expression
of the effort of a freedom loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportunity.
It is the result of the confident deter
mination of such n people to maintain
their future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted the enter-"
prise of the Individual, his Industry,
his ingenuity, his intelligence and his
Independent courage.
For twenty years or more this stat
ute lias been upon the stntute bonk.
All knew Its general purpose and ap
proved. Many of Its violators were
cynical over Its assumed Impotence,
it seemed impossible of enforcement.
Slowly the mills of the courts ground,
mid only gradually did the majesty of
the law assert Itself. Many of Its
statesmen authors died before It be
came a living force, anil t liny nnd oth
ers saw the evil grow which they bad
honed to destroy. Now Its efficacy Is
I seen; now Its power Is heavy; now Its
object Is near achievement Now we
hear the call for Its repeal on tho pKg
that It Interferes with business pros
perity, and we are nilvlsed In most
general terms bow by some other stat
ute and In some other way the evil
we are Just stamping out can bo cured (
If we only abandon tills work of twen
ty years and try another experiment
for another term of years.
It Is said that the n t has not done
good. Can this be snld in the face of
the effect of the Northern Securities
decree? That decree was in uo way
so drastic or Inhlbltive In detnil as ei
ther the Standard Oil decree or the
tobacco decree. Hut did It not stop
for all time the then powerful move
ment toward the control of nil tho
railroads of the country In n slnglo
hand? Such n one man power could
not have been n healthful Influence in
the republic, even though exercised
under the general supervision of nn
(Interstate commission.
V i we desire to make such rnlhless
combinations and monopolies lawful!
When nil energies tiro directed, not to
ward the reduction of the cost of pro
duction for the public benelit by a
healthful competition, but toward new
ways and means for making perma
nent in n few hands the absolute con
trol of the conditio s nnd prices pre
vailing in the whole field of Industry,
then individual enterprise nnd effort
will lie paralysed and the spirit of
commercial freedom will be dead.

The Earthly Facts.
A story told of Lord Holt, who was
lord chief Justice of England In the
eighteenth century, shows what tt dead
ly enemy to wild superstition a sense
of fact may be. A man presented him
self to Lord Holt and said:
"A spirit COmo to me from the other
world and told mo that in your next
case you must enter a plea of nol
pros" that Is, refusal to prosecute
Lord Holt looked nt tho man a mo
ment and then smiled.
"Pn you believe that such a message
Is wise for a human being to obey':"
"It Is absolute."
"And do you believe t'.int tbe messen
ger had n full know ledge of the law of '
England?"
"Yes, and of all law. Hy following
t!ds heaven given advice you will lie
doing Justice."
"Well, you tell your messencer if ie
comes again that he should have sent
Ins message to the nltortiov general.
Tho lord chief Justice of England nev
er prosecutes, and If the spirit kuew
anything about the English law he
would know a simple thing like that."
Tho Invention of the Piano.
The honor of Inventing the Diana i.
claimed by the English, the French
nnd the tiermnns. l ather Wood nn
English monk at Home, Is snld to have
been the real Inventor In 1711 nnd to
have manufactured one, which he sold
to Samuel t'rlspl, the author of "Vlr-
glnln." from whom It was purchased
by Falke tJrevllle, though Count Rarll
claims tlie credit for Htirtholeinineo
Ohrlottforic of Padua during his stny
III rioretiro some three venra lmr
(1714). The French attribute the In
ventlon to a Parisian named .Marina,
who, they alleged, produced In 17tn ,.
hnrpslchord In which hammers had
been substituted for the old pleotrums
or quills. The flermans are the last In

after much eonslderatlon the model ot '
a new clsvler with hammers, upon
which he could play loudly or softly."
