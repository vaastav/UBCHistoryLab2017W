Census of Mines Not as Satis-! Manager of Bartlett Estate Tells
Is
Captain Fred Foruo of the terri
torial Mounted Police, has returned
from Oklahoma City. He was no., er
aetly impressed with the official treat
ment given him. Armed with requisi
tion papers for one William B. Quin
lan, wanted in Socorro for contracting
for a car of horses for which he was
to. pay $700 cash and a stallion, but
for which he has thus far failed to
make good, Captain Fornoff located
Quinlin at Sentinel, Oklahoma, and
had him taken to Oklahoma City for
a hearing before Governor Haskell.
:But evidently the governor of Okla
homa is averse to good citizens being
taken out of his state and refused to
honor the requisition because of the
technicality that the averments in the
complaint were., not sufficient. The
complainant, George Cook, of Socorro,
has no redress, and may have to pay
in addition the expenses of Captain
Fornoff and of the proceedings. Sher
iff Talle of McKinley county, who had
also gone to Oklahoma to bring back
with him a man named Scott, located
at Shawnee, and wanted at Gallup for
leaving the Carbon City with a dia
mond ring and shot gun claimed by
some one else, became wise to the fact
that Oklahoma is a favored refuge for
people wanted elsewhere to answer
for their deeds, and arranged for a
satisfactory settlement, and returned
with Captain Fornoff, but, without his
prisoner.
Territorial Funds.
Territorial Treasurer M. A. Otero to
day received from Penitentiary Ward
en Cleofes Romero $573.72 convicts'

Eighth Grade Certificates.
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion James E. Clark is sending out
circulars to govern the issuing of
eighth grade certificates this year.
Last year, 230 applicants in sixteen
counties, took the examinations, for
which the questions were prepared by
the department of education of thei
Territory, the papers being graded by I
local examining boards. This year,!
the papers will be graded at Santa Fe
by the office of the superintendent of
public instruction. The object of the
plan of issuing certificates, which was
inaugurated last year, is to standard
ize grammar school courses through
out the Territory, to encourage pupils
to finish the grammar grade and for,
school districts to establish grammar
schools. A large number of applica
tions for eighth grade certificates is
anticipated thi3 year.

RECONCILIATION BETWEEN
ROOSEVELT AND BALDWIN.
Mutual Friends Seek to Bring it
About But Thus Far Have
Failed.
New Haven, Dec. 16. Colonel
Roosevelt has written Governor-Elect
Baldwin several times since the Nov

the letters have been returned un
opened. There has been no definite
adjustment of the controversy which
arose over Colonel Roosevelt's criti
cism of Judge Baldwin's alleged atti
tude towards the wprkingmen's com
pensation laws, but mutual friends
are said to be trying to bring about
a reconciliation. It Is said that Judge
Baldwin insists on a public statement
from Colonel Roosevelt before a dl
rectcommunication will be considered
During the campaign, Judge Baldwin
said he would bring suit against the
colonel for damages, but it Is under

any service of legal papers upon him

Mr. Adams saiel that Mr. P.artlett has

011 this ranch over which roam thou
sands of cattle.
This ranch, however. Is not the
largest ranch in the Territory for the
fiel! ranch on the Pablo
Montoya
grant contains 75o,ri00 acres.
'But. the day." he' said, "is fast com
ing when these immense ranches will
be a thing of the past. We see that
in Texas. Then, too, the fact that
even the big ranches are being put
under fence, will make the great rid

Discusses Alfalfa.
Asked about alfalfa Mr. Adams
said: "It Is unquestionably a great
crop for the grower who has land that
will produce four and five crops in a
year. This can be done in the south
ern part of New Mexico without a
doubt. In the northern part two or
three crops are obtained. I would not
advise a man to go into alfalfa ex
tensively except where he can get
these four or five crops per year."
Mr. Adams is a native of Maine but
he spent a dozen or more years in
Arizona and he spoke highly today of
