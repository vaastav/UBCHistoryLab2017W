Views on Vital Questions.

Cuba—Republicans as a Rule UeRard
Annexation of Hawaii With Favor.
Objections to Arbitration.
NEW YORK, Deo. 8.—A special to The
Journal from Washington says: A
poll has been made of congress upon
the most vital questions likely to come
before that body at this so n. Tho
following proposition was submitted to
the members of the house: "Do yon
favor retirement of tho greenbacks?"
The surprise in the vote upon this
proposition was in the fact that such
Republicans as Belknap, Dolliver,
Odell, Henderson, Messick, Bruce and
Hopkins were found in opposition. Not
a single Populist favored the proposi
tion, while Brenner and Kitchen were
the only Democrats in its favor.
The following propositions were sub
mitted to the senate: "Oan any radi
cal financial legislation, involving the
retirement of the greenbacks, the lirn
itation of the legal tender quality of
silver, or the issuing of gold bonds for
the retirement of greenbacks, pass the
senate?"
It was practically a unanimous senti
ment that nothing can be done.
To the senate upon the matter of an
nexation, this proposition was submit
|j ted: "Do you favor the annexation of
1 Hawaii?"
I Not a single straight RepuK'^an was
1 found in opposition, but Can. and
Pettigrew the silver senators vo. din
favor of it. All the leaders of the Dem
ocratic party were opposed, with the
exceptions of Morgan, Pettus, Rawlins
and Turpie.
The exact form of the vote taken upon
the question of arbitration was this:
"Do you favor the adoption of a general
arbitration treaty with Great Britain?"
Among tho Republicans found in the
I negative were: Elkins, Frye and Baker,
1 going with Cockrell, Mills, Morgan and
I Murphy among the leaders of the Dem
'I ocrats.
Upon the Cuban question, these two
propositions were submitted to mem
bers of the house of representatives:
"Do you favor the joint resolution
passed by the senate at the extra ses-
Bion declaring that a state of war exists
inOnba?"
Do you favor a resolution acknowl
edging the independence of Cuba?"
The first prpposition seemed to meet
with the views of tho greater portion of
che known friends of tho insurgents,
although the Republicans were far be
hind the Democrats in numbers. Among
those on the Republican roll who voted
for the proposition were Belknap,
Vioutelle, Danforth, Davenport, Grow,
{Henry, Robbins, Stevens and Over
Street. The Democratic leaders all
favored it, such men as Bailey, Benton,
/Bland and Taylor being found among
the positive friends of belligerency for
.the gallant patriots of Spain's beleag
uered colony.
Friends of Cuba appeared to bo a bit
hy of the bold suggestion of Cuban in
lependence, probably for the reason
:hat the first proposition having passed
he senate, it affords tlm means of more
iirect action,-and through the fear that
the congressional recognition of Cuba's
independence might lead to cflmpliea
ions with Spain, which tho other move
.vould avoid.
Allen Talk* For Cuba.
WASHINGTON Dec 8.—In the invoca
iion today Chaplain Milbnrn delivered
brief but touching eulogy on the late
Venator George of Mississippi. Mr.
fjavis reported from the committee on
Ureign relations a bill prohibiting the
Tilling of fur seals in the North Pacific
bean.
Mr. Allen (Neb.) presented a resolu
liou declaring it to bo the sense of the
lenate that congress should, with all
Sue and convenient speed, acknowledge
appropriate act the political inde
jindence of Cuba. Mr. Allen said that
had long urged the United States to
icognize the independence of the
^Abau insurgents. He would not lio
cintent with the recognition of bellig
ligncy, but would insist upon the ac
owledgment of absolute political lib
ly. Ho was satisfied that the people
jiuld not be content with the course
Avised by the administration. Iuas
Jich as the Cubans, for more than two
gjars, on many battlefields, had demon
rated their valor and tho love for lib
7ty, ho felt that they had earned a
/(cognition of their political liberty,
ad that it ought to be accorded them
frithout further temporizing. If nec
essary this recognition should bo backed
jpy a fleet of American vessels in Cuban
vaters. Ho declared that the comiiier
lal spirit of the United States was pre
jg action.

PRESIDENT BACK IN CANTON.
Mother McKinley Rallies anil Recognizes
Him—Relapses Into Unconsciousness.
CANTOS, O., Dec. 8.—Once more the
children of Mrs. Nancy McKinley have
gathered around hercouch, made sacred
by her tenacious struggle against death.
The reunion is complete. The presi
dent arrived before the death angel had
made his visit and took with him the
spirit of the aged mother. The scene
was a pathetic one that beggars de
scription. In the midst of it all, there
was a joy unspeakable in the breast of
the president. He had again been per
mitted to see his mother alive. He had
answered all the obligations of his
country. Ho had fulfilled his vows to
his people. He had witnessed tho as
semblage of congress and had been
cheered with the news at the same
time that his mother was better. In
the little upper room at the McKinley
homestead this morning there was a
scene almost too sacred for pen to write.
Tho eyes of all present were filled with
tears as they witnessed the remarkable
and almost miraculous rally of the
president's mother from the uncon
scious state into which she had fallen
early in the morning. As her son en
tered the room accompanied by his wife
and Miss Mabel McKinley, the sister of
the president, Miss Helen said:
"Mother, here are William and Ida."
The president kneeled by her bedside,
kissed his mother tenderly, reverently,
and as he did so she put her arms
around his neck and signified that she
knew him. She also recognized the pres
ident's wife and reached her hand to
ward her. She recognized Mabel Mc
Kinley and Jack Dancan. It seemed to
friends that sho had been awaiting the
arrival of her son. Soon after she
lapsed into an unconscious state, and
the strength that had been husbanded
for the last meeting of mother and son
seemed 10 leave her. An hour aftei
his arrival, the president sat by the bed
side, holding the hand of his mother.
The attending physician was surprised
at the remarkable rally.
HOLECHECK MURDERS HIS WIFE.
Nebraska Farmer Then Tries to Drown
Hitufteir, But Is Rescued.
FALLS CITY, Neb., Dec. 7.—Last night
at 9 o'clock Joseph Holechek, a pros
perous farmer, living four and one-half
miles southwest of Humboldt in this
county, shot and killed his wife. Aftei
shooting his wife, Mr. Holechek at
tempted to kill his hired man, and fail
ing this, attempted to suicide by trying
to drown himself. He is now confined
in the city jail at Humboldt awaiting
his preliminary hearing, which will
come ofF today. The feeling is very in
tense against him, and some fear of
lynching'is felt.
Holechek had been drinking during
the day. He returned home from town
at 4 o'clock and had a quarrel with his
•wife, who started to leave the house for
her brother's. Holechek followed and
shot at her from the door, but missed.
He then ran after her and, grabbing hei
by the hair, threw her down, holding
her with his left hand, and shot her in
the left side.
After shooting his wife Holechek
turned his gun on the hired man, who
had witnessed the deed and had come
to the rescue. The gun snapped and
the latter took it away from the crazed
man. The murderer jumped into the
stock tank to drown himself, but was
pulled out and bound by relatives of the
dead woman, being bruised considera
bly iu his capture.
Comptroller Eckels' Report.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The annual re
port of Jumes H. Eckels, comptroller of
the currency for the year ended Oct. 31,
1897, opens with a brief review of the
history of the legislation which consti
tutes the present national bank act, and
invites the attention of congress to
amendments to the law recommended
iu former reports without specifically
repealing them. The report contains
the latest compiled statistics relative to
the world's monetary systems and the
stock of gold, silver and paper curren
cy. A very interesting feature of this
statement is the per capita amount of
each kiud of money iu the countries
named. The per capita averages in the
principal countries of the world are as
follows: United States, $!1.70 United
Kingdom, $30.05 France, &i4.t>8 Ger
many, $18.95 Austria-Hungary, $9.83,
and Russia $8.95. The comptroller re
news his recommendation of last year,
urging that national bank examiners be
paid an annual salary instead of fees as
now.
Griggs Ilus Accepted.
WASHINGTON, Dee. 7.—It was officially
announced at the White house on the
return of the president to Washington
that Governor John Griggs of New
Jersey has been tendered and has ac
cepted tho office of attorney general,
which will be vacated by the nomina
tion of Attorney General McKenna to
bo associate justice of tho United States
supreme court. It has not yet beon set
tled when Governor Griggs shall as
sume his new office, but it is probable
that the date will be about tho begin
ning of the new year.
LTALVESTON, TOX., Dec. 8.—Hon. W.
J. Bryan reached here today and left
with a party of friends for Lake Sur
prise to hunt ducks. The party will be
gone three or four days. Mr. Bryan
expressed himself as follows on the
president's message: "The message
indicates an intention upon the part of
tho president to aid in turning the issue
of paper money over to tho national
banks and iu the meantime a purpose
to givo gold a further superiority ovei

The opening day of the regular ses
sion iu the house passed without un
usual incident of any character. Tho

Captain Becker with 210 German ma

nese forts opened fire and tho Germans
replied, killing three of the garrison,
which thereupon fled iu disorder. The
Chinese general in command was cap
tured, but afterward liberated. Sev-1

stones flung by the inhabitants of the
village, In return for this the head
men of these villages were beaten with
bamboo sticks by order of the German
commander.
It is reported here that China is will

A dispatch to The Times from Pekin
confirm the report that China, hoping
for the evacuation of Kiao Chau, agrees
unconditionally to all demands of Ger

The Times, dealing editorially with
the situation at Kiao Chau, notes that
the foregoing telegram enumerating the
German demands, does not include the
permanent occupation of Kiao Chau
and joints out that the evidence is con

demanded. It says: "Iu any case,

to be settled. The Havtiau govern

the foreigners who had sought refuge
on board ships iu the harbor have re

It is understood that the question of

that all the demands of that country
have been agreed to by the government
of Hayti in face of the display of force
made by Germany and under the threat
of a bombardment of the defensive
works of the port unless these demands
were agreed to within the eight hours
following the time the German ulti
