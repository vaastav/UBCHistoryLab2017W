The President's messag"? was disctis.st-1 in the
Journal of this morning in a Column nt,d a half
editorial. The Jsaissf cot-jawiisi the course of
the J' xe tiiive in his annsions to the slavery
questio... Xhe article meets with the approval
of all class . . here, anil unless Congress tuirsu.-s
a dif! -rent policy than that urged by tfie aho
litiouists, a wonderful change will take place in
(his and ail other States. Several hading mili
tary frentieuimi, tyhoie names I can furnish if
ant easary, have openly areeJaiavMi that ti.ry will
r-.'eigti at once if the slavery i.ssue is to have any
thing to do with this war. As I have already
wr ties, you, there is the h&teeneet h cling iu the
army and iimong the I'tiioi: eaenaant here upon
this subject, aud it is dilfieult now lo toreaeo the
cons.-iii'-nces to lbe Un-OB cause if Congress
fails lo rebuke the aboii iou fanutics inunedi
aiely. Oii Abe'a .11-ni;e In lh- lortti.
The ini inuati CaatSM rcial says of Lincoln's
message :
The review of the progress of the war is not
felicitous, and s mi' of the statem uts made an
not distinguished tor exact accordance with the
(acts. The information that "Missouri is coin
para lively quiet'' will he news to the unhappy
people of that State. e find iu this portiou of
the message testimony that corroborates the as
sniance we some time ago had from good author
ity, that the E'reatoant is too busy in discharging
tie duties of 'lis office to read the newspapers.
Few readers will suppress & smile at the sort
of reference that is mode to the retirement of
General S t aud ( appointment of Ueu. Mc
Clellan a general-in-chief of the army. The
profound paragraph, in which we are treated to
a dlscO-ston oT tup proaoaition that "one bad
Msssrsi is letter than two good ouas" is. espec
ially entertaining- The intention probably was
to niak-t a very oiscrei i notice of tha erihl winch
had lietn endured when Gi lis. Scott and MeCiel
lau atfeta both iu command, but it would be cru
elty as well a luuonsuileut with the remark
ab"Ul "l good generals," to draw the infe
rence that the Presideut coiigratulatee himselt
u-'on having only "one bad general" in McClel
lan. In fact, Seward e ight to have revised that
paragraph
ol Mrs. Sims on Second sta-et between Madi
son aud Molina1, aud stole some clothing, a val
uable watch and chain, a set of diamond jew
elry, and a pistol from a room occupied by Mr
Ilaerritld. That g-ntle:n:in was awaken -d by
their operations, and sprung from hSaheel 'ih-y
il.'d, and after attempting t.. iboot him, in doing
which the cap snapped, he fellow ad these to
lbe door, calling loudly to the aatica, v. ho did
not arrive, when one of the men fir. d at him,
the hall passing akwe by him and str.king the
wail. There is certainly a want of increased
night protection in the city, and an increase of
tin-nigh: police up to the end of March is cer
tainly desirable, and with the increase, some
syst.-in. if one can be found, to insme vigilance
and fidelity on the part of the men employed.
