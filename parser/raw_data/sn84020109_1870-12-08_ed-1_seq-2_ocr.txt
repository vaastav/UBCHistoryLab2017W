TIIK SCHOOL FUND.
"We are glad to tee that this ques
tion i-. being very geneially discussed
liy tho press throughout theState, and
that tlje greater number of the papers
thus far favor a plan, in the main,
avrei-ing with the idea suggested by
the Advertiser a few weeks since : that
j that the fund to be put out at inter
est hnuld remain in the counties
wheie il originated. We think if this
plan is found to meet the views of a
majority of the members of the com
ing Legislature there will be no diffi
culty in arriving at details that will
make the fund safe, and give entire
satisfaction.
On the question of accepting real
estate as security for loans, we are the
more convinced of the superiority of
that mode over even United States or
State Bonds. The basis of all first-elas-'s
evidences of indebtedness is and
always has been real estate. As we
have befoie said, the first object in
any mode is to make the fund safe.
To this end we suggest the enactment
of a law that will make the county re
sponsible for the fund ; make the
County Commissioners custodians;
loan onlv on unimcumbereu real es
tateimprovements of no kind to bo
'taken into consideration; require
lauds twice the amount In value to the
sum loaned and make a failure to com
ply with law on the part of an oflicer
a penal offense.
The Nemaha Valley Journal sub
mits the following plan, which we
endorse, particularly that feature
"giving School Districts the prefer
ence of the loan for the purpose of
building school houses:"
"The School Fund to be distributed
to the different counties from which
The fund is received. To render the

and interest, ::nd let the county make

tive school district the preference
of the loan for the purpose of build
ing school houses, but limit the
amount either to a certain per cent, of
the value of the completed building
or the taxable properly of the district,
authorizing the levy of a tax to meet
the interest anil principal when due.
For any portion of the fund not taken
by school districts authorize vcustodi
aus to lend it to individuals upon un
iincumbered real estate, in amounts
not to exceed twenty-live per cent, of
the value of said property, perishable
improvements eluded, and not to
exceed in any case live hundred dol
lars to any one individual. Put the
rate of interest and time of loan upon
such terms as to cause the fund to be
sought after, and to be constantly em
ployed. It is claimed that this plan
is safe so long as the counties are sol
vent ; that it will insure a higher rate
of interest than that borne by United
States nr State Honds ; that the secur
ities cannot fluctuate in value; that
it will stimulate the industry of the
entire country by distributing the
fund among the people, and finally
that the principal as well as the inter
est would thus be employed in pro
moting education, by supplying the
means to build school houses in dis
tricts unable at present to build with
out aid."

SCHOOL CLOSING EXERCISES.
The Nebraska State Normal School
was established by an net of the Leg
islature, Jan. 2nd, 1807, and located at
the pleasant village of Peru Id this
county. At that lime the success of
such an Institution inour youngState
was considered by many as exceeding
ly hazardous. It Is, perhaps, not as
suming too much to say that had it
not fallen into the hands it did, it
would have proved a failure. The
Hoard was composed f the men for
the place and the Principal, Professor
McKenzie, rnada to order. To-day
the Normal School Is firmly estab
lished as one of the Institutions of
the State, and to bo as lasting as the
State itself. The Board have just is

Tiie people in every school district
in this State ought to meet and dis
cuss this question. Let your Senators
and Representatives know what you
want. We are tired of hearing mem
bers of the Legislature, when ques
tions of such impoitanceas the School
law nnd Herd law come up for con
sideration, give as an excuse for non
attention that they do not know how
their constituents feel or what they
want.

TIIE ADVERTISER ABROAD.
A gentleman living in Philadelphia,
Pa., who lias been for many years a
subscriber to- the Adcrrtiw, writes,
renewing his subscription for 1871, as
follows :
"1 am anxious to renew ni3' sub
scription iu time fo entitle me to the
premium you offer. I still- read the
Advertiser with interest, especially
the 4th page, advertisements Includ
ed. The evidence it exhibits of the
energy and go-a-hcad-it-iveness ef
your Western men in building Hail
lloads and planting the prairies with
fruit and forest trees, must be gratify
ing to any American in whatever part
of Uncle Sam's dominions he may be
located. But don't neglect the im
portant question of immigration.
1 will herewith send you to-day's
J-JiHjuirer, containing a letter from our
well known cifizen Jay Cook, on this
subject. You will observe his inter
est in this, particularly for .North Ne
braska, but your Rail Road men may
gather some useful hints here that
possibly have been overlooked. For
what can a It. -it. Co., owning count
less acres. 0f land, do better than sell
them very low, or give them to thrifty
immigrants, who will settle upon and
improve them ; ami carry them to
them for nothing besides. It would
be but money lent to be repaid in a
few years with interest compounded."
One of the editors of the Detroit
Tribune, who spent a few weeks in
Nebraska, wrote .some very pretty
things about our State, and Omaha in
particular. Dr. Miller of the Herald
notices the compliments paid to State
and city, and pleads modesty as an
excuse for not copying the references
to the editor of the Herald. Don't be
so modest Doctor, because the Tri
bune differs Ki7t the Herald political
ly. We'll help you out. Hero is
what the Tribune says :
"Dr. George L. Miller, of the Oma
ha lhrald, did all that was in his
power to make the visit of his Detroit
l'rieuds delightful, and I rejoice that
I am able to congratulate him upon
the skill with which he edits a wide
awake, spicy and entertaining daily,
at whose size I constantly marveled,
and whose vigor and life do honor to
the town iu which it is published.
Dr. Miller, though still in his errly
prime, is one of the "oldest inhabi
tants" of the State, and he possesses
that thotougu acquaince with its his
lory,
it resources and its men, which
are tne essential aitriuuics oi success
ful journalism in a new country" It
savors of base ingratitude to add that
h.' is 'a tremendous Democrat:" but
I can hardly avoid stating the fact, I
herefore do so leluctantly, and ten-1
to him at the same time humble
I profuse apologies."

Yesterday we enjoyed the pleasure
of attending a portion of the closing
exercises of the term, with which
we were highly delighted, and only
regret that every friend of Education
in the State was not present.
In the morning the Algebra classes
examined. As they were just closing
when vre entered the recitation room
we cannot speak from personal obser
vation. Those who were present ac
cord the highest praise. During the
remainder of the day the advanced
and subordinate classes iu both Gram-
niarand Mental Arithmetic were ex
amined under the supervision of
Profs. McKenzie, Martin and Miss
Fuller; and, also, compositions read
by a numltcr of young Misses. With
out attempting to particularizo we
briefly say that in our intercourse or
observation in the school loom, we
have never before witnessed, what
may be termed, such perfect thorough
ness. This has always been Prof. Mc
Kenzie's forte, and his subordinates
are not a whit behind him. The

he or xhc understand what is before
them. The student, too, catches this
grand idea, and the effort in this di
rection is thoroughly mutual, and
hence, incalculable benefits.
With reference to a clear and thor
ough understanding of the branches
nnder consideration, and happy fac
ulty of explaning matters ; free and
elegant style of expressing themselves,
we cannot fail to honorably mention
the names of Miss Daily nnd Miss
Lewis, and- Mr. Eagley and Mr. Al

The students have a prosperous or
ganized Philotnetbian Society of OTor
seventy members. They havea room
for meetings In the building very
handsomely furnished ; carpeted,
seated with chairs, Piano and ether
musical instruments. In the even
ing Prof. Smith delivered an excell
ent Lecture before the Society in the
chapel "American Nation." It was
listened to with interest and frequent
ly and heartily applauded. The ex
ercises of the evening were interspers
ed with delightful music, given by
the "Normal Class Glee Club," in
charge of Prof. Martin, assisted by
Mr. Smith, a student from Salem,
who, by-t he-way, is su expert with
an instrument.
At the close of the exercises in the
evening the crowded chapel was treat
ed to an agreeable surprise. By a pre
concerted plan the stage was sud
denly cleared, when a couple of Miss
es, assisted by a gentleman, ushered
Prof, McKenzie in front of the audi
ence, and formally presented him with
a tine watch and chain in behalf of
the school. Particulars and address
given to-morrow.
Too much praise cannot be given
every teacher in the Normal School.
They are thoroughly educated for and
devoted to their calling, and the whole
Institution is an honor to the State.
Indian Depredations.
The Platte Journal contains sever
al letters, giving an account of depre
dations said to have been committed
by the Sioux Indians :
Last Saturday night thoy visited
the stable of Mr. A. J. Hoge and
took three head of horses; they gave
Mr. Isaac Shivers a visit and killed a
calf, three very fine hogs, and left an
arrow iu the side of one of his cows ;
they killed a cow for Samuel Walton,
and shot an ox for Stacy Matlack.

on nn inspecting tour into Missouri
as far as Ed ina last week, and on his
return gives a full account of the trip
and details of the work in process of
construction. We -regret that its
length prevents our publishing it en
tire. We make- the following ext racts :
"The inspection of the road was
clone and exhaustive .Every mate
rial port on was looked at either on
the out or the return trip, and the re
sult has been as we have said satisfac
tory beyond expectation.
Commencing at West Quincy and
running westward the Company have
placed under contract for grading,
twenty sections of one mile each ; the
most extreme western limit of im
provement being the thirty-eighth
mile from the liver and within four
miles of Edina.
Eleven miles consecutively from
the river westward is in the hands of
contractors and being rapidly pushed
forward. Of this the first live miles
may be said to be practically finished ;
the embankment being complete
with but few hours of finishing
touches necessary on two or three of
the sections, and with these excep
tions, together with the trestles re
quisite to provide for the passage of
t lie overflow from the Mississippi in
its Spring freshets, the bed is ready
for tieing as far as the bridge over the
North Fabious at Taylors, where its
line strikes the bluff. This trestle
work can be erected with quickness
and ease, and will cause no delay
whenever the tie and track hiylersare
prepared to commence work at the
western end.
The solidity, regularity and sub
stantial appearance of the embank
ment for the first five miles attracted
general and favorable comment. This
work has been done by Quincy men,
of life time experience in this line of
business, and they have done their
job well, as they know how to do it.
The bndgeacross the iS orth r abious,
five miles from this city, promises to
be unsurpassed by any structure of
similar proportions. We do not be
lieve that anywhere in the country
can a more complete piece of bridge
stone work be exhibited than that
which Mr. Menke, the contractor, is
constructing at this point. Such was
the universal verdict of the inspect
ing party. The rock is obtained near
La Grange, and has to be hauled a
distance of six or seven miles. It is a
pure white limestone, perfectly free
from flint, lying in heavy seam's, and
is pronounced to be superior to any
stone in this vicinity for this or any
other building purpose.
The superstructure is to be of the
Howe Truss patent, with asinglespan
of one hundred ami fifty-five feet be
tween the piers. The total length of
the bridge will be one hundred and
sixty-five feet.
Passing over the Fabious we find
the Sixth and seventh miles also rap-:
inly advancing to completion, and
also, we might say, the entire work
under contract as far as the end of the
eleventh mile. Here comes one of
the heaviest pieces of labor on the
whole line; high grading involving
a rise of sixty-five feet to the mile,
and from thi.s point with the excep
tion of section fourteen (which is
being worked,) contracts are not vet
made for any work, until we reach
the twenty-third section, laying in
jLabelle township, Lewis County.
'Thence to the end of the thirfg-cigh'th
section workmen are busv from one
end of the Hue to the other. Some
sections are almost entirely complet
ed, and at no time, scarcely, could
one look along the survey 'without
seeing a gang at work. And here, as
elsewhere, the same characteristic
was evident good work showing
capacity and faithfulness in the con
tractors, and personal supervision on
the part of the engineers.
Through Labelle township and ap
propriately is the name given, for
hardly anywhere can a contiguous
area be found of equal size in all our
agricultural domain where a more
gladdening view will meet the eve of
thrift fertility ami landscape beautv
than in this rich township of Labelle.
It is diagonally bisected from the
southeast to the northwestern corner,
and everywhere iu sight were fences
and fields, no waste, no useless land
to be seen. The same might be said
ot the easern portion of Jeddo and
all that section through which the
line runs in the western part of Lewis
and the aastern portion of Knox
counties.
There is a rich section of countrv
also lying along the road from the
eighth to the twelvth mile of the
survey, where the road rises through
abroad fertile valley from the Fabious
bottom to the level of the higher
lands.
The richness and immense resour
ces of some portions of Missouri lay-
ling immediately by us is but little
realized by most ot our citizens. Our
thoughts and movements Meretofoie,
all tending eastward, it is only now
and then that an occasional evidence
comes upon us of what lies in this.
our natural granary, "iet, could all
of Quincy pass ocr this projected
route and see, not only what nature
has there planted, but what capacity
for development exist, any doubts as
to the especial demands for our con
nection with this section would be
thrown aside forevor. Missourians
understand this well. They see
where their natural market lies, and
expect a similar recognition from us.
Said one intelligent farmer to us: "I
know that I and every man within
sight of this road can afford to give
ten per cent, of all we own to have it,
and we will get our money back
without feeling that we have "paid it
out."
How valuable, how j-oiid a business,
and how much prosperity we are
drawing to Quincy, may be" gathered
from the fact assured us everywhere
that the individual proprietors of
these sections are free from debt. An
intelligent gentleman stated to us
that he did not know iu either of the
two townships of Highland and La-
oelle of hve mortgages, and that
Sheriffs sales for any amount were a
thing there unknown.
But chiefly have we written these
lines to assure and inform our home
readers of the faithful labor and solid
progress which marks the action of
the Directors of this road ; to testify
to the ability of its location, the for
wardness of its work, the energy of
its officials, and what was- observable
all along and everywhere, an abiding
faith among the people whom we met,
in its management and in the great
reciprocal advantages it will produce.

The IVork of One Year.
The forthcoming annual report of
United States Treasurer Spinner con
tains some statements which most in
terestingly illustrates the reformation.,
and economy brought about by the
present national Administration.
It shows that the rnnv has cost
l!OG0,142.4G less in 1S70, than it cost
in ISO!).
It shows that the Internal Revenue
Department has cost Sl: (S1.40 less
in 1870 than in ISO!).
It shows that the Treasury Depart
ment has cost ..OIS.SOO.O- less in 1370
than in ISbU
It shows that the Interior Depart
ment has cost$3,950,ySl.GU less iu 1-770
than in ISGO.
It shows that S3S.:30 less has been
paid in quarter salaries iu 1S70 than
in l.HOO.
The total savings of the year in
these divisions of the expenditure of
the Government is$27,lol),0Sy.J.
On the other hand the Navy De
partment has cost $-33,4G9 50 more in
1870 than in 1SG9; the Treasury Inte
rior $47 J.GUo OS more; foreign inter
course, $.U6. 5:;. 04 more; and cus
toms, $914,G()u.l7 more making $1",
s42,9S2.70 of increased expense to be
deducted from the above savings,
leaving S24..Slo,0!J9.20 as the net reduc
tion of the expenditures of the Gov-"
eminent, other than in the payment
of the National debt.
To ware the reduction of the public
debf, Treasurer Spinner's statement
shows that $i:5,S?JS00"i.l9 more was
paid in 1870 than in 1SG9.
The receipts from Internal Revenue
were $2G,797I292.11 greater in 1S70
than in 18fi9-.
The receipts from customs were $14,
0012,294.04 greater, and the receipts
from miscellaneous sources were $4,
033,371.40 more.
The comparison, or rather tho con
trast, between the last two fiscal years
stands as follows:
Increased receipts, $4S,2G3,321 ; de
creased expenditures, $27,1-39,080; to
tal, $75,322,402. Decreased receipts,
S4,34o,3S9 ; increased expenditures,
$2,342,092; total, $G,G(iS,3S2, being a
clear gain by larger collections a ud re
duced expenditures of $GS,734,020.
General Spinner, in commenting on
these facts, sajs :
"In order to give a clearer view to
such persons as are not in the habit of
thinking of money by millions of
dollars, of the great saving that has
been made to the Treasury of the
Uuited States in the last fiscal year
over the one preceding it, the state
ment is here made that, after deduct'
i... 1. 1.-3 nnd nromote the resurn to
specie payments." A resolution
offered by Trumbell was adopted, di
recting the Secretary of the Treasury
to furnish the Senate with a copy of
the forms, entries, oaths, bonds, rules
and regulations prescribed by him un
der act of July 14th, providind for the
immediate transportation of merchan
dise from ports of entry to ports of
delivery.
Sherman made an ineffectual effort
to get up a bill ceding certain juris
diction to the State of Ohio, referring

A special dispatch from Brussels on
the 3d, savs the Germans yesterday
made a desperate effoit to drive Du
crot s army, which held all the villa
ges on the east bank of the Maine,
from Noissy Le Grand to Ormesson,
hack across the river. For this pur
pose, at daylight yesterday, tho 2Sth
army corps and the 12lh, under the
Duke of Saxony, and a division of
Wurtemburgers, sixty thousand in all
made a furious assault in four columns-,
advancing on the French posi
tion at Brie and Ghampiguy, from the
east, northeast and southeast. Ducrot
withdrew within the peninsula foim
ed by a curve in the Marne, directly
opposite Bais De Vincenncs, thus cov
ering his Hanks by the stream. As
the Germans advanced to the attack
they were met b a terrible lire from
forts Nogen. and Rosuy and redoubt
Arion. The slaughter was most ter
rible. The Germans wavered, Hut were
soon rallied by their officers, who
were themselves shot down. The first
brigade, second division of Saxon
troops lost all its otlicers. At noon a
large column of fresh troops from Par
is crossed the bridges near Brie and
drove the Germans some distance east
wards. At three o'clock . the firing
ceased, the French returning near the
east bank of the river, and not re
crossing it, butholdingall the bridges.
The losses on both sides were large
The German losses are the greatest on
account of their siiataining the fire of
the forts, and their attacking the
French in their chosen po;

A balloon from Paris descended
near Le Mars. It left Paris on tho 1st
and brought the following news :
The French troops kept the posi
tions they' took in the sorties of the
29th and 30th, and were preparing
vigorously to prosecute an offensive
movement. Gen. Vinoy had a por
tion greatly in advance of Gen. Du
crot. The latter was stopped, owing
to a sudden rise in the river, hrouirht
about by the Prussians breaking away
the dam, and not on account of any
resistance offered by the Prussians.
The Prussians retook Champigny. but
the French again took it. The 'Prus
sians, and not the French, demanded
a truce to burv their dead.

Gen. Ducrot is now seeking to ef
fect a junction with General De Pala

Prussians at Tremblav.

A cable dispatch from London, the
4th. says:
The iijrhting at Brie on Saturday
was Very severe, the tJermans being
exposed to a & toady lire from the
French forts, but at in the afternoon
the French retired, leaving behind
many prisoners. Biie, though aban
doned by I he French, has not been
occupied by the Germans.
The French wounded who have
fallen into the hands of the besiegers
refuse an oll'er to b&sentbaek to Par

their overweening confidence in eon-s-eipience
of recent military events.
Trincc George, of Saxony, in a din
patch to the Kink of Saxony, states
that Brie and Chanipigny have been
re-captured, although "the French
brought heavy masses into action.
He admits that the Saxons sullered
severely.
