At this juncture A. V. Gear, who had

figures, brought his sheet of figures
over to Brown and it showed that each

of the results of
To get out of the police cells and
avoid the trouble of appearing in court
it is necessary to see one H. C. Birbe.
He has a pull with the high officials
of the department and has the power
to get out of custody those arrested
for little affairs like drunkenness and
4
others concerning which the public at
large takes little notice. Naturally
Mr. Birbe does not work his pull unless
there is something in it for Mr. Birbe.
A police pull which could not be maile
to yield the necessary gold would be
of no use to Birbe. He is not a philan
thropist. In one case, at least, which has
happened within the past week, Birbe
has extorted money from a prisoner
of the police, securing his release from
custody and arranging matters so that
he was not entered upon the trial
calendar. This affairs occurred on
Thanksgiving day, the particulars of
which show the glaring misuse of power
exercised at the police station aud the
graft woiked by this man Birbe. How
many others there may be in the same
game or who else I esides the one who
makes the extortion .shares in the money
thus illegally obtained is not known.
On the afternoon of November 29
Alfred Tregaras, a driver employed by
Lcwers & Cooke, was arrested at the
fishmarket and lodged in the police sta
tion. A charge of drunkenness was
registered against him. Regarding the
merits of the arrest it is not necessary
to say, but at the station a companion
of Tregaras was told that no bail
would be accepted. This companion,
George Domingo, offered to put up $25
to secure the release of Tregaras, but
his offer was turned down.
Domingo stood outside the police sta
tation for some time, talking over the
ease with Special Officer Leal, in the
course of his conversation again offer
ing to put up $25 bail. At this point
of the game Birbe appeared, accompa
nied by an older companion, whose
name is known.

the Board of Supervisors' meeting last
night.
Alter the estimates for the month
had been passed without any reference
to Honolulu's music-makers, Moore
said "band."
Everybody woke up and the fun
started.
First of all Moore gave an imitation
of a man who didn't know that the
band had already recommenced to work
for the county, forgetting that he had
helped to decide the matter at the last
meeting of the board.
The act wasn't a howling success be
mg promptly coppered by the chair's
reminder of what took place at the last
meeting with reference to the band's
engagement by the county beginning
on December L
Then Moore got hostile. The coun
ty didn't need any band, anyway, said
he. Berger, as a leader, was incompe
tent and altogether impossible. He
had presumed to tell Moore when he
intended to go to work and It was up
to the board to see that the band didn't
run the county.
After urging that the band be cut
down numerically and that the Kap
ellmeister's salary be operated upon,
another cat jumped out of the cornet-
cover.
Moore had a friend, a skilled musi
cian, respectful and not one whit dic
tatory. He would gladly lead the band
for $100 a month, or $85 less than Ber
gen's present stipend.
Lucas stood up for the music-makers
whom, he declared, as an organization,
were indispensable to the town. He
had the whole of the board behind
him, barring Moore. His motion that
the salary of the band start from the
beginning of the present month, found
favor with everyone except Moore,
who voted "no."
The estimates for the present month
were passed at $36,425, exclusive of the
band, whose appropriation will be ar
ranged for at the next meeting.

taking' Domingo to one side, telling
him he had something to say to him.
What he had to say was that if
there was any money in it, he, Birbe,
knew a way to get Tregaras out of jail
and shut off any further trouble in
his case. Domingo asked him what his
price was.
"Well," said Birbe, "to get him
out and keep him from coming up for

$15 to him. ' '
Now, .while Domingo was quite will-
