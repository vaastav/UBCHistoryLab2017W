NeAvs of the "Week.
The Fenian excitement in Ireland is
becoming intense. The British Gov
ernment is taking active measures to
keep down the movement. Arrests are
being made all over the Island, and mar
tial law has been proclaimed in. Limerick
county.
It is said that John II. Surratt, one
of the awsassins of President Lincoln,
has been arrested at Alexandria, Egypt.
Congress met on Monday ol this
week. We will publish the President's
Message next woek.
A report was recently started that
the prisoners at the Dry Tortugas were
cruelly treated. Gen. Sheridan has
personally investigated the matter, and
pronounces the story utterly false.
There was a report in circulation a
short time ago that Gon. Sedgwick had
crosssed the Rio Grande with U. S
troops. We believe the report' is un
true. It caused immense excitement in
France when the report reached there,
as the French claim that they are re
moving the troops from Mexico as fast
as possible.
COMMISSION KICM' REPORT.
The county Commissioners made the
report to the Court of Common Pleas,
required by the Statute, and Judge Ply
ley ordered it published in the Standard
three weeks. Mr. Ferree, tho Clerk of
the Court, bas given us a part of the
report, mutilating it? and suppressing
his report to the Commissioners, of his
official transactions. Why he refuses
to let the people see what he has been
doing, tho people must judge. We
shall have more to say when this repdrt
is published.
We will now only say that it is evi
dent that the law conferring criminal
jurisdiction on the Probate Court of
Jackson county ought to be, and must ba
repealed. It costs tho county more
than a thousand dollars a year, without
any benefit whatever. The Probate
Judge himself gets $100 a year for six
days service, or $GG.66 a day. The
Prosecuting Attorney also gets an al
lowance for business in this court.
Then there are jurors, fcc.,' to be paid.
We intend to send out. petitions to
tho poople, asking tho repeal of this
law.
From the evident desire of Mr. Long-
bon, the Probate Judge elect, and Mr.
Hastings, Prosecuting Attorney, to
economize, we have no doubt they will
both sign petitions to save the county
this unnecessary expense
LOTTERY SWIHULKS.
The peoplo are running wild after
lotteries. It is no uso to argue with
them. This mania must take its course.
Every body wants to get tho property of
some one else without paying for it.
Dut he loses his own in tho attempt.
Serves hint right'. One swindling con
cern offers a farm worth $75,000, and
$10,000 in groenbauks, besides other
largo sums, for only one dollar. It is
pretended that the money will bo applied
to tho support of tho widows and or
phans of soldiers. .This scheme is in
dorsed by Gov. Cox. Tickets oan bo
had of tho Postmaster in this place.
We would suggest that the largo prizes
be appropriated to tho benefit of the
widows and orphans, and not paid to
the successful gambler who happeits to
buy tho lucky ticket, trovided any one of
the gamblers is so fortunate as not to
be swindled by tho managers of the
ooncorn.

THE I:w IM)DOI!i
The Democratic party attempted a
fusion with the bread-fmd-butter brigade
but the process of dissolution went right
along. In the desperation of its death
struggle, it once more invokes the aid
of the despised and dspoiled negro, and
declares for negro suffrage. But it
does this like everything else which
it attempts, in such a way as to show
ts inherent rascality, and fails to secure
the respect of even the negroes them
selves. Instead of proposing impartial,
manhood suffrage, giving all men an
equal chance, the Chicago Times Boston
Pot, and some other leading Democrat
ic papers propose to make education a
test. This would exclude nearly all the
negroes in the late Slave States', and near
ly all the poor white trash. This just suits
the Democratic idea of a Government
by the peoplo, giving all the power into
tho hands of tho rich, educated rebels.
But the sword cuts both ways. While
it would work well in tho south, it
would ruin every vestige of the party
in the North. A large portion of the
voters of the party in the North are the
ignorant, uneducated, and especially
the ignorant foreigners. Should these be
excluded, the educated Yankees, wheth
er living in the mountains of New Eng
land or on the plains of the West, would
carry every election with a high hand
and an outstretched arm. The rabble
of the party see this, and bitterly oppose
this now dodge. In tho mean time tho
death struggle of the party becomes
more appalling. We can only compare
it to the poet's description of the dying
sinner, where he says:
"In that dread moment how tbe frantic soul
Rave round the walls of her cluy tenement;
Kims to each avenue and shrieks for help
but shrieks In vain.
Mournful sight. Ilor very eyes weep blood,
And every groan she heaves is big with horror. ' '
RATS ANIf HEEIt,
Well, what connection is there be
tween rats and beer t v ery much.
Listen. . A certain brewery had a large
tub or vat, from which the liquor was
drawn, near the bottom, through a faucet.
This became clogged, and the contents
of the vat were drawn off by a syphon,
over the top. At the bottom was dis
covered the cause of the clogging ol
the faucet. About five bushels of dead
rats wero found, in all stages of decom
position. Rich beer that. Wo have
heard of flavoring foreign wine with 4
cockroaches, but we never knew that
what mado beer taste so nasty was the
essence ol rats. Deer uriukers will
please make a note of this.
rO"A couple of weeks ago we spoko
of a fellow calling himself Ned Heed,
who was hero running a low negro
show. It seems wo were not mistaken
in our estimate of his character, as tbe
following from the Galiipolis Journal,
would seem to indicate :
Nod lteed'a Minstrels cave a performance at
Aleshlru's Hall, Inst Friday evening. The show
was very fair of lis class. They had a decided
success In one thing, as we understand they

One day last week I was called to -go Into the
country to take the acknowledgement of a deed.
The deed was made by Julius A. Bingham, my
Sabbath School Superintendent when I was a boy.
The morning was cold and frosty, and I walked,
the distance being only three or four miles from
town. I met Mr. Binghum and Mr. Pierce In a
buggy, coming to meet me. I rode back with my
old friend, and he said be wanted a little talk with
me about old times.
In the year 1830, there was no store nearer to
where I resided, than Jackson, some thirteen
mile ; neither wns there any Postofflce nearer.
Mr. Binghnm brought on some goods and opened
a little store bought eighty acres of land, aud
laid ouC the town of Oak Hill in the year 1832.
He was from the State of New York, pud was so
different from the Virginians who originally set
tled this part of the county, that many did not
like him, and as usually was the case, called him a
Yankee, and wero jealous of his superior educa
tion and refinement. He was a Presbyterian, and
the Baptists and Methodists did not like him for
this reason. He established the first Sabbath
School that was ever known In that part of the
county. It was held In the woods, between where
the Welsh church and the old Methodist church
now stand. I have seen as many as three hun
dred children In attendance at one time. I lived
two miles away, but I never missed a Sabbath.
Mr. Bingham would always come with his books
in a basket, and wo i Id ofteu open the school by
singing a hymn commencing :
"This Id the day that Jesus rose
So early from the dead.
Why should I keep my eye-lids closed,
Aud waste my hours In bed ? "
Well do I recollect the joy with which I beheld
tbe books of the Sunday-School library, with their
flowered paper binding. My first book drawn was
called "Martyn," a biographical sketch. Then I
got "Erminia," an East Indian story. Then "The
Ceylon Mission," "The Broken Hyacinth," "The
Iroquois Indians," "Elements of Astronomy, &c.
I gained much instruction from these humble lit
tle Sabbath School books.
Mr. Bingham sometimes procured the 'services
of a Mr. Howe, a Presbyterian minister. He had
large congregations. As there was no church, the
services were held In the woods. Of course, the
Siibbnlli-School had to be suspended when cold
weather came.
There was a Baptist minister named Jacob Ward
who often preached in that neighborhood, who
attacked" Sabbath Schools, missions, education,
and every advancement. He wore a hunting
shirt, and a knit woolen cap. He would make a
llr?t class Nusby, or modern Democratic preach
er. Mr. Bingham had to contend witfeold Jake
Ward and others like him, and gave out that he
would lecture, or rather preach, one Sabbath, at
tbe residence of John Shoemaker, the place where
Thomas McNeal now resides. I was there. The
congregation was large, and the discourse effec
tive. ;
L
if
told in y old friend Uinghnin that wicn I sow
the place where the glorious old woods w re once
bo Joyous with the songs of birds, and found tlie
trees all gone, and the hills cut to pieces with ore
roads, and thought of tlie silence that bad so long
rested upon nearly all of my companions of thirty
live years ago, I became so melancholy as to al
most cry; He said he felt Just so himself, when
lie saw the old places. He spoke of John Bluke,
Lewis Adkius, Levi McDnnlel, and many others.
Mrs. Bingham died a few years ago, and Mr.
B. Is again married. He now resides at Ellrla,

THE
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,
To He CJreatly Enlarged.
THIS widely circulated and Popular Journal
of the Industrial Arts and Sjiences enters
Its TWENTY-SECOND YEAR on the 1st ol Jan
uary next, and the publishers propose to tignnlize
the occasion by ENLAKUINU it to the size of the
most costly Scientific Journals of Great Britain,
without, homver, incrtating the tubtcriptim prict.
It is almost superfluous to speak of the great
value of this Popular and Useful Journal to all
classes, and especially to Mechanics, Manufactur
ers, Iuventors, Engineers, Chemists, Agricultur
ists, and all who love to read of the wondrous
progress which now marks every department of
of Mechanical Engineering and the Industrial
Arts and Sciences generally.
The Editorial department is very ahlv conduct
ed, uud many of the bet Scientific writers In this
country and Europe are contributors to its pages.
Mauy of the articles have the charm of romance
about them, aud inspire the mind - with noble
Ideas.
The Scientific American has the largest circula
tion of any similar journal in existence, but It
ought to have a milllou of readers in this grow
ing country.
The engravings of New Inventions, Tools, Im
plements for tbe Farm, Workshop and Household
are very numerous, aud are splendidly executed
by the best urtisls In the world. This feature of
the paper is very striking, and has won the praise
of the united press of this country and Europe
Another feature peculiar to the Scientific Amer
ican is the Ofllclal publication of every Patent
granted by the Government Patent Office. Each
number contains the weekly issue of Patent
Claims, with copious notices of new Inventions,
together with Reviews of Foreign Inventions and
Db-eovvries in every department of Science. '
Whoever reads thu Scientific American is In
structed and entertained, without being bothered
wilh bard words and dry details.
The American and European Patent Offices, In
connection with the Scientific American, form
an immense Museum of Mechanical Novelties,
which furnish constant employment to a large
corps of Scientific Examiners who prepare draw
ings and specifications for Patents.
This linn is no doubt the most extensive in the
world.
Now is the time to send In subscriptions to the
Scieutilic American, so as to begin with the new
volume.
The numbers for a year make op a splendidly
illustrated volume of 832 pages. Terms : :) per
annum ; f 1.6b for six months ; 41 for four months;
Clubs of ten and upward, &2.&0 each : Canadian
subscribers, i'i.To per annum, always in advance.
