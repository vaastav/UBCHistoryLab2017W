TIIK DILL IX RXmtCNCR TO omCT-BHOKKRJ.
Mr. TRUMBULL introduced a bill to relieve
rccmiere of Cotgress from importunity, and to
1 reserve the tnccDcr.dcncc of the different de*
pungent* ot the government. It/provides that
any member ot Ccngnss or Delegate from a ter*
ntury who Bhall, directlv or indirectiv, solicit or
nccmxend the appolntmcm to office by the
1 “resident or heads ol departments, of any person,
manr of executive'departments, except such
recommendation be tn writiog, in
re*pco>c to a written request of
the head of a depjrtment, asking
it formation, or by a Senator giving bis advice or
content In me manner pru«tded by me constUu*
non. shall he guilty or a misdemeanor and, on ecn-
TtcUuh thercol, shall be hoed not exceeding {I,OOO
for each offence, and it shall not be lawim for the
ITetldeator hesdot any department to sppont
to office or employ in rus department any person
who staff be dilccUy or Indirectly recommended
by any member of Congress or Delegate from a
1 erntory except in the manner now provided. Mr.
Inin bull explained the provisions of toe bill.
1 hat some reform was needed was generally coo*
ceded. A Clvli Service but had t-een prepared
which made the appointment to office depend on
ttefl'ccssof the applicant to be determined by a
Hoard of Examiners, bat the dlfflcullv wav to or.
gatlze a board which should n»«lf be beyond par.
u-an control. The powers ol the government
were divided np into three departments, oars
was emphatically a govtrbmem ufcoecks and bal*
sices, upon the proper marnt-oanoe of whten the
perpetuation republican system depeaded.ln
some ol the States not only were the governments
divided into execn'lre,. legislative, and Judicial
branches, but positive prohibitions were laid down
in the constitutions t f those States against the ex*
crcite oi any powers properly belonging to one by
either of me others. While the United States
('oesutotion vetted the legislative power in a Con
giess, the executive power to a President, and the
judical power in me courts, it did not so absoinie
1y inhibit the exercise ot avy pan of the powers
of one by another, as was note by same of the
roDKUQttots tn regard to Stale affairs. The ap
pointment to office,properly an executive inaction
under me Federal Conttitntion, was not given
exclusively to the Executive Department. In*
deed, criner the Pieaident nor any head of a
department coold appoint an officer tn any case
wuben; the consent of Congress, or the advice or
cocseLt of the Senate, the conatltotlon requiring
tbe President to nominate by and with the con*
seotuf the Senate, to appoint ail officers of the
United Stales, exsept tbe President, Vice Presl.
dem, Senator*, Beptesebtauvesasd me officers of
tbe boose* of Congress. Daring a recess of
the Senate, the President may appoint to
fill a vacancy. All other powers exer
cised hy the President and heads of depart
ments were conferred by acts of Congress.
Practically appointment bad cot, for some yean,
retn mace wutuo the consututionai mode. Mom*
It ally appointments were made, bat tn reality
were dictated, in a vast majority of cases, oy an
Itffoence unknown to the constitution. Every
S-enworand Representative knew that appoint
ments were dictated by them, am! tbe President
and beads of departments were cot left free to
task* selections with an eye single to the public
good. As a general rule no man could be appoint
ed to any office local to the district,
unless he bad ‘tbe reocommeodadon of per
sona who happened to represent the district
tor the time being tn Congress, U he be a mend of
tbeAamtnutra’JoQ. ho arbimry was this role
that be anew of instances ot faithful public
officers, friends of the Administration, being re
moved to make place for a fnend of the Bepre
senTauve from the district, and at a subsequent
period, during me same administration, the new
appointee ban been removed, to give place either
to the former incumbent or some other mend of a
new Representative, and who, at a subsequent
election, had succeeded in supplanting the former
one. When the nomination came before
the Senate. the action upon it
was a mere form, and, in many
cases no other question was asked than whether
the nominee was acceptable to the member of
Congress concerned, in some instances luffn.
cnees were brought to bear to secure the election
of members of Congress, with tbe understanding
that tn ench case a candidate would nae bis tn-
Cumcetniavorof a certain par y. This prac
tice has ted to tbe creation of officers to provide
places toruietdi of members. Then, bow coaid
members of tbe legislative (department of the
government expect to preserve their independ
ence as legislators, when continually making per
sonal livers tn matters of aproatments from
tbe beads of departments. This pressure by
Oongreiimen for official favor was oot less de
moraiizlcg to tee appointing power tban to them
selves. The President and beads of department*
being dependent upon Congress tor legislative
support, coold not fall to disregard the wishes of
members, la tome ot the depart incut*, the
speaker had been informed, a debit and credit ac
count wa* actually kept with Congress, crediting
them with a certain nnmberot appointments and
charging them with those made for them, as it the
appointments actually belonged to members of
Congress. Tbe bill now introduced allowed
the appointing po*cr to obtain the
benefit of the information which Congressmen
might have of applicants from tnetr own districts,
by a wiltteo request to the member and his reply
thereto, but the bill made it a penal offence tor
him to recount end in any other way, and protffo
ited the appointment to office of a person recom
mended la any other way. The custom of allow
log Congressmen to make appointments had be
come to firmly established that it almost
had tbe force of law, and nothing
bat a positive statute ooold remedy the

be felt in relieving members from unnecessary lm

Wboie on the stve of the Union, Mr. Ferry in too
cbwr, to dtstma'e the President 1 * message arsons
the several commltteea. The usual resolutions
tnaiisgtach ri’i rUmtion were offered by Mr.
Scheock, who laid if any memlvir deatred to dis
run* them he would ncia the floor, tmt would pro*
ftr to have all the reaolaitona reported to the

Mr. COX inr.n red whether tne committee on
Ways and Means wa* to take chance or tna'ten
cr-icerted wttn i he resumption ol specie payment,
or whether the Committee on Usnkiog was to
latecbarg* of it.
Mr. BJIiENCIi replied that there waa no spec's!
reivicLCe made to that subject In the resolutions.
It M-ee.tdlo occupy a ion of debatable groned
twtwecn me two committees. Legislation In re
lation to the pttt-llc credit, to bonds, to securities

probably would, some reference to tbe

that tbe Home might think proper to raise an.

At the desire or Mr. Wool), the resolution re.
fcrrlrg to the tu’croroat.ic cut al was read. It re
feta tbit portion ot the message to the Committee
on cotMtrrcc.
Mr. WOOD sngge*trd that tt should he referred
to me Committee on Foreign Affairs, as it involved
the qnfati 'n ot a treat*. ■
Mr. £CHBS< K »uid that, as the matter ot a
catal across the latnams ol Darien was purely a
n at'er of great commercial Interest, it hadlicen
■huu.ht better to refer it tome Committee on
Con. mi rce.
Mr. LYNCH suggested that the part of the me».
M-se riirrrmi 'o Lav.gallon interests KlocgcJ
} mpcrlv to a select comuiittee on the subject.
Mr. SCHKNCK sslJ nc bad two reasons for pre
lerrng Ha reference to the Committee on Com.
urree Kim, because that was a standing com
z Due, ana prebreecc was UMiallv given to »ucn
cooimmces; and, rccobd, because be ned-rstood
the select committee to have been created for the
purpose of looklrg into the causes ot the decline
.u sup building atid navigation.
Mr. WOOD inquired whether the House could
reetr to consider the question of an mter-ooeaulc
e*tai until there was a treaty made, and whether
the CocLtDlltec on Foreign Affairs was not the
proper committee for the consideration of a ques
t'ou of that character.
Mr. SfUENCK supposed that Congress might
consider the subject before any ndatlional treaty
stipulations were entered Into than those existing.
There was eatncient understandings ana agree
ments between the Government of tbe United
States and me cocntnea on me Isthmni to author
ize this government to send out a surveying party,
which had already sailed, or was about to mb,
Mr. WOOD sold he nndentood there was an
agreement so lar as the survey was concerned,
but there was noconcesslon of the right of way.
Mr. O’NElLLexpretsed the opinion that all sub
jects embraced in ihe resolution come within the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Commerce; mat
it fact, tue inactions of me Special committee o n
Navigation Interests were ended, or should be.
There had been no necessity for the creation of
that committee, to me first instance, the Commit
tee on commerce being ready, and anxious, at all
times, to perform its duties.
Mr. LYNCH replied mat tbe Special Committee
bad been created with the consent ol most of the
members of the Committee on Commerce, and,
by the terms of tbe resolution, o report was not
required before the second Monday in January.
He moved a reference to me Special Committee ol
that portion of the President's message relative

As the day for the organization of the Constitu

different official positions in the convention be

of President of the convention are Browsing, of
Onincy; Coolnangh. of Chicago; Schoifield, of
Clark Country, and Turner, of Freeport. Young,
ptogreaiive Democrats are for Schoifl&ld, who » a
smart young lawyer, and a rising star among the
young naterrifled. Browning will be the choice of
tve conservative element, and should the
fates, by sickness or otherwise, put the
organization into the power of the
Demotraw, ths scramble for office will astonish
tbe natives. The only Democratic candidate who
thinks he win bertalniv be elected Is Mr. Merritt,
senior editor of tbe n taU RmjUter, and if hard
work, tndusmoua application/and nottnog sea) in
keeping the Democratic Ore alive in the hearts of
tbe great unwashed la to have Ita recognition from
