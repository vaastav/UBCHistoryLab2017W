Bat there may be.diff-rencee of opinion in reference to

We have been earnestly ipoktn to on this subject by

New Hanover and Brunswick are conoern6J, and we
see no reason to doubt what we have beard as to other

We cannot pretend to enter into the merits of the

yesterday. The Governor's Message was recsived to-da '
He pro'ests a?ain3t th? doctrine that woal.i give able-
bodied mtn tbe right to walk about untouched amid the
general anSaring and deriolatioi. He urges that the entire
male population of the State may be embodied for the pur
pose of c o-operatiog in our great straggle.
He reoommenda the passage of a law author'zicg a pro
clamajion warn'rp citizees of Virginia in toreign parts to
return without de'aj, under penary of eoofiscation of their
property.
He discusses the questioo of employing negro troops and
says : For my part, standing before God and my country, 1
do not brsitate to say arm each portion of oar abla-Dodied
slave population ts may be aecsssary. Pat them in the
field, so as to have them ready for the Spring campaign,
even if it resulted in the freedom of those that were so or
ganized. He would employ them to- fight the negro force
of the enemy, aye. and the Yankees themselves. The ques
tion is, whether the enemy shall nse our slaves against as,
or we nse them against them.
The Governor recommends that the Btato borrow the gold
of the Bank to purchase Confeuera'e currency at twenty
for one, the gold to be re'uroed at th end of the war. He
also recommends the regal itioa of the prices of alL conv
modifies by law.

Uiiceor twice in cur life we went through, or were
put through what General Dockebt is said to have
ci?'cd tie " dentnrial operation ;" that is to say, we
have Lad one or mere teeth pulled. Not many more,
for W2 fcucd tcoth pulling not a matter to be lightly
entered upon.
No ccubt tie proper management cf the teeth is a
inciter requiring an amount of ekill that can only be
acquired by ctu3y and experience, and that properly
d, the study and practice cf dentistry involves so
much ef rcientifioand medical knowledge as ought to
entitle U hcncrable votary to be recognized as a pro
fessional man. It has been said, indeed, that Congress
ia its cxeinplirn laws and otherwise has refused such
recocni'den to dentists, end it is urged that theeffact of
fbi3 rion-reccgniticn-y-thia implied stigma, may be that
hereatter no ycung man of education or acquirements
wiil f;rguge in the pursuit, that none will devote the time
and attention to the study necessarily to qualify them,
reives, and that in fine, hereafter, the human molars aud
incise rs will be given np to those who know nothing
about the general anatomy of tbe system, or the special
anatomy of these important members, with their deli
cate end highly sensitive nervous connections.
Congress could probably remove the sappopd slur
cast upon dentists without extending the provisions of
tbe exemption law, at least we supposs it could, and we
tliak this would be due to the educated and rtallj com
petent dentists, who, in their own way, are really ben
efactors of their race.

which enr relations are of a mcst fri.cdly nature, he so

and good offices ot this goyernment anl othr State.
He says that the ports of Norfolk, Fere a ad in a arid Ptn-

than pursue contracts and trade with other portj c'oaed by

After reference to variou su jjecti of no general interest
to Confederate readers, Lincoln notices the continuance of
the war with results which he regards as Important. 'He
reoommenda the proposed amendment to the constitution
aboliahing tlavery throughout tho United States.
He refra to the result of the recent eection as an evi
dence of the purpese of the people of tho loyal States to
maintain tho integrity of the Union.
Oa careful consideration it seems
to cie no attempt at negotiatioa with the in-mrgnt leader
oould result i; any good. He would accept nothing short
of a tev9rance of the Union, which we cannot voluntarily
yield. Its issue can only be tried by war and be decided
by viotory, bat the Southern people caa re-accept union,
and the amnesty oSered one yar ago is still open to all
on condition to make a f . se ch-jic. .
In conclusion, LukiIj rajs'itLo rri'l not retreat or
modify his emancipation proclamation, and la stating a
single condition ot peace he means simply to fay that war

should hars ceased oa tbe part cf those who began it.

v A Guilty Conscience.
One ol the most mem -able passages ever uttered bv
Mr. Webster was in viudieatija of the authority ol
conscience and of P. ovidecce. on a trial for a dark and
mysterious murder : " lie cuil-y soul cannot keep its
own secret. It is false to itself, or rather it feels ao ir
resistible impulse to b'. true to i self. It labors under
its guilty possession, and knows not what to da with it.
The humm heart was not made for lie residence of sucb
an inha . tant. It finds itself prejed upon by a torment
which it does not acknowledge to Cod or man. A vul
ture is devouring it, Ehd it can aes no
sympathy or assistance, tithe-r from heaven or earth.-
ibe secret which the murderer possesses soon cornea to
possess him ; and like the evil spirit of wnich we read,
it-overcomes him, and leads him wbithersosver it will.
He feels it beating at hia Leurt, rising in bis throat,
and demanding disclosare. lie thinks the whole wend
sees it it n iaoe, reads u in bts eves, and almost neara
its work.. a the very silence of Lis tnoughie. It has
become h.o , '.aster. It betrays his discretion, it breaks
dawn his courage, it conqrers his prudence. When
suspicion from without begin to eaibarrasa him, and
the net ot circumstances to entangle hMi, tne fatal se
cret struggles witb stiil greater vioie;:c3 to burst forth.

The standing army of Brazil numbers about 20,000
men, and in addr.ion mere is a national guard of about
100,000 men. This national guard is similar to our
militia in character. Its cmcers are thoroughly drilled
and one-third of the rank and file can be called into ser
vice in case of mvasirn. The, Brazilian navy consists
of about 100 vessels; over thirty of which are gunboats.
Tbe total naval lorce cannot be less tban6,000 men.

A CtfAHACTKRisTic Ixcidest. A gentleman who
was in the train from this city to Petersbc", a. very
cold morning not long ago, tells u$ bis attention was
attracted by the ifljrt ot a your -g s iidier, wtiu nis arm
in a sling, to get his overcoat on: His teeth es well as
his sound hand were both into uso to efioet the object;
but, in the midst of his eflorts, an officer rose from his
seat, advanced to him, and very carefully and tenderly
assisted him, drawing the coat gently over hia wounded
arm, and butt red it up com-ortabiy, then witn a few
kind and pleasant woida returning to tiis st;at.
Now, tbeoflloer in question was not clad in gorgeous
uniform, with brill aut wreath upon the collar and
multitude of gilt lines upon the sieves, resembling the
famouj labyrinth of Crete, but be w.s clad in "a simple
suit of grey," distinguished frotu tbe garo of a civilian
only by the three stars which every Confederate Colo
nel in the service by the regulations is entitled to wear.
And yet he was no other tnan our Chief CeneraJ, Rob.

good and modest.

It is, you are aware, a double anniversary, being Lord
Mavor's day and the birthday of the Prince of Wales.
The Lord Mayor's show differed little from that of lor

was abolished. 'J he principal thoroughfare of the city
wa3 blocked up for two cr three hours by the passage
of the stupidest of all processions, and the civio pro
ceedings terminated with the usual aldermanic feast at
the Guidhall. The usual speeches were there made,
some of them by Her-AIajeaty's ministers, and Lord
Palmerelon had the bad taate to indafee in one of his
stereotyped slurs again9t the United States.
The rejoicings, so far es the Prince of Wales was
concerned, were of a more extensive and beany cbarac

An Advent w.re In tlic Alps.
Professor Tjndall semi? to thi London Tiaies a nar
rative cf a ratter exciting adventure in the Alps.. Oa
the 3d of July, he and two friends, with a couole of
guide?, Jer.ni and Walter, ascended the Piz ;Murter
atech. The ascent was accomplished safely, but not
the descent, which waa made along tha Morterastich
glacier :
We at lengta reacned the point at which it wa3 Dec-
eeary to quit our morning track and immediately af
terwards got upon some steep reck?, wnich were ren
dered elipp.ry here and there by the wa'er which trick
led over tntm To our right wua a broad couloir,
which wag onca filled up with snow, but this bad been
melted and re-frczen, so as to expose a elopiag 'all of
ice. W e were all tied together at this time in the fol
lowing order : Jenni ld, I came next, then my friend
H., an iatr?p:d mountaineer, then hia friend L , and last
o( all the guide Walter. After descending the rocks
for a tinii?, Jenni turned and asked me whether I thought
it better to adhere to them or try th3 ice elope to our
ngnt. I pronounced ia uvor of the rocks, but he
seemed to misunderstand me, and returned toward the
couloir, lie cut steps, reached the snow, and descend
ed carefully along it, a'l following him, apparently in
good order.
At;er a lube while, he stopned, turned, end looked
upward at tae last tnrte men. He said soai'jthicg
aoous seeping c:ireruj;y in ine irr.CJS, adainc: that a
false step might d.tach an e.valanche. The word was
scarcely uttered whtn I beard the sound cf a fall be
hind m, then a ru3b and in the twinkling of an eye
my two fi lends ard their guide, all apparently entangled
together, whirled past ni3. J suddenly planted nsyself
to resist their shock, but in a,a instant I wa3 iu their

afterward, Jenni was wbirlrd away, and thu3 all five of
us found ourselves ridiog downward with uncontrola
b!e speed on tha back of aa a7aianch3, which a single
slip had originated. When thrown down by the jc:rk
of the rope, I turned promptly on ray fece'and drove my
baton through the moving snow, seeking to anchor it
in the ice uuderneAth. I had held it firmly-tl'ua for a
few seconds, when I came into collision with some ob
stacle, and v33 rudely tossd through tne air, Jenni at
tbe same tim-a being shot djwa up .n me. Both ot us
here lost our batons. We had, ia fact, been carried
over a crevasc, had hit its lower ede, cur great ve.oci

Two wroDRi neter make a right, said one disputant to

Yes they do sornet imes, said hit antagonist.
Never, rep.id the other colloquist.
They do, I tell you, and can prove it. The other day
somebody parsed on me a five dollar counterfeit bill. That
wis wrona, wasn't it '!
Yes. of course;
Wa'al, I wasn't goin' to be chsated out of five dollars ;
po I passed it off among some good bills, cnto another man.
Wasn't that wrong J
To be sure as much as tbe first.
Wa'al that makes two wrongs, don't it ?
