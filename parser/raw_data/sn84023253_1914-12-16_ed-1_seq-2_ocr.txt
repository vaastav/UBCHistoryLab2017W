Too Many Institutions.
"Let U. V. M. train our teachers
in agricultural and Industrial lines.
Let Middlebury continue to give
them excellent instruction in peda
gogy academic teaching, and let
Norwich maintain its engineering
instructors." This is the sugges
tion of the Rutland Herald in an
swer to the suggestion of the Bel
lows Falla Times that "Vermont
ought to have a state university and
but one, and that cne should be lo
cated at Burlington." The Herald
claims that it3 proposition is the
recommendation of the educational
commission, but we have not dis
covered where the commission has
recommended any state aid for Nor
wich University. On the contrary,
the commission did not recommend
any aid for Norwich because that
institution could perform no service
for the state that is not already bet
ter done at one of the other insti
tutions. The commission has recommend
ed the training of teachers for the
secondary schools of the state by
Middlebury College and the train
ing of teachers of agriculture In the
public schools at the University of
Vermont. We question somewhat
the wisdom of subsidizing even two
Institutions for the training of
teachers for Vermont. If the plans
of the educational commission are
carried out Vermont will have bet
ter trained and equipped teachers
in every grade of the public school,
especially in the small rural school
where the teacher Is almost the en
tire educational equipment. In these
schools, especially in the secondary
schoolf, some form of agricultural
instruction is to be given by teach
ers trained and qualified for such
work.
Now if these teachers were to be
trained in agricultural teaching at
the University and in pedagogy at
Middlebury, either the teachers will
be trained in only one of these
branches or must divide their time
between the two institutions. Neith
er of these results is desirable.
Vermont schools will need young
men and women trained in both
pedgogy and agricultural instruc
tion If it intends to make agricul
tural instruction at all general. It
would not be wise or economical to
require one teacher to attend two In
stitutions to get equipment for his
work. Nor is it necessary as one
Institution can be equipped for less
than two institutions to do the en
tire work.
Further, why should the state pay
a second institution to perform the
same work that it is paying the Uni
versity of Vermont through federal
aid to do? The federal government
is liberally helping the state in glv
. ing instruction in agriculture and
mechanical arts and the state ap
propriates this money to the Uni
versity of Vermont and State Agri
cultural College. Having done this
it seems hardly proper that the state
should also help another institution
in practically the same line of work
because one well-equipped institu
tion can handle it more economically
and efficiently than two partially
equipped institutions.
When fully considered there
seems o be more merit in the propo
sition to have one state university
located at Burlington than some peo
ple are willing to admit.
The American Army
The American army is the sub
ject of most animated discussion,
and there are practically three
propositions before the country at
present- Congressman Gardner of
Massachusetts is convinced there
should be an investigation with full
publicity regarding the prepared
ness for war and makes some sensa
tional ' statements in support of his
contention. He makes it evident
that action is needed but the house
refused to support his plea for pub
licity. Secretary of War Garrison in his
annual report shows the Inadequacy
of the present army to repel an in
vasion of any size and that it would
take at least six months to organize
a sufficient force, a situation that
would be fatal were an invasion un
dertaken. He gives this sane defi
nition of what our army should be.
"Every nation must have adequate
force to protect itself from domes
tic Insurrection, to enforce its laws,
and to repel invasion; that is, every
nation that has similar characteris
tics to those of a self respecting
man." He urges that the United
States army be recruited to its full
war strength which would require
an increase of 25,000 men and 1,000
officers. This would give the coun
try an army of 120,000 men with
an available mobile force of 50,000
men in continental United States.
The artillery and artillery ammuni
tion should be greatly increased. He
also urges new legislation regarding
enlistment and a reserve force, both
in the regular army and the state
militia.
Sensible and convincing as Secre
tary Garrison's statements and argu
ments are, we are inclined to be
lieve Senator John P. Weeks of Mas
sachusetts outlined a better plan in
a speech in the senate on Thursday
last. He believes that the army and
state militia should be reorganized
so to give to the mobile army the
proper proportion of infantry, field
artillery, cavalry, engineers, signal,
sanitary troops, the needed ammuni
tion and supply trains, and provide
for properly equipped depots. In
this he and Secretary Garrison are
probably in full accord but here is
a more valuable suggestion. Sen
ator Weeks said:
"I am firmly impressed with the
idea that haphazard legislation has
too long been indulged in with ref
erence to the development of our
military resources; that the ques
tions of policy, of economy in main
tenance, of effectiveness in the cost
ly machine which we are forced to
maintain, have not been intelligently
met certainly they have not been
satisfactorily solved.
"This requires some sort of na
tional defence council, and I " am
heartily in favor of seeing such a
body legislated into prompt ' exis
tence. Congress then would not be
asked to provide for the policies and
individual opinion of vary adminis
trations and military committees
which so far have been Ineffective
and costly, but some definite scheme
would be thought out for the eco
nomical development and mainte
nance of that part of our military
resources considered necessary for
our national defence.".
Here we have efficiency, economy
and consistency regarding the
fighting force of the country. We
believe it will be well for the coun
try to silence the noisy mouthings of
Congressman Weeks, go beyond the
recommendations of Secretary Gar
rison and begin the careful and
scientific development of an ade
quate army urged by Senator
Weeks,
ment aid for the development trade
routes that has ever been success
fully undertaken. Every American
would be glad to have profitable
trade developed with South Ameri
ca but many believe the government
should no more go into the shipping
business than it should go into the
cotton business or the production of
food stuffs. It may with safety en
courage private enterprise in these
lines but it certainly cannot under
take such business in its own name
with any hope of success-
Taken as a whole, the wording of
the president's message was admir
able, his hopes and ambitions are
good, but his methods proposed give
no promise of securing the wonder
fully nice things he seems to hope
they will. The president has not
asked his party to grant any relief
to the Industry of the country from
the unfortunate condition in which
they have placed it. He has simply
commanded our industries to ad
vance with a load they have already
found greater than they could bear.
American industry like the overload
ed horse has simply received another
command to advance when it knows
it is impossible to do it.
Xo Relief Promised
The country awaited the annual
message of President Wilson to con
gress with much interest, because
it was anxious to know whether or
not the president realized that Amer
ican industry was paralized by pres
ent law, railroads are facing bank
ruptcy because the government has
persisted in destructive rather than
constructive regulation and that the
country faces serious complications
on account of the chaotic conditions
in Mexico. So far as his message is
concerned, it is evident he does not.
On the contrary he declares "the
road at last lies clear and firm" but
does not show that any of the in
terests mentioned above has even
discovered the "road."
The president comes out firmly for
the development of new shipping
routes by the government and the
retirement of the government from
the business as soon as any private
party wants it. This method has
the virtue of novelty but is in direct
opposition to any method of govern-
The Governor and The Courts.
Discussion, especially cussing, of
the Governor's action in appointing
judges of the courts does not abate
in the state press. The Bennington
Banner calls attention to the fact
that it was not the legislature of
1912 that is responsible for allowing
the selection of the judges to pass
out of control of the legislature but
the legislature of 1910. That the
legislature of 1910 was the only one
that could propose constitutional
changes and that the legislature of
1912 could only approve of , the
changes proposed two years earlier.
This seems correct and makes the
following bit of history pertinent.
Allen M. Fletcher was a member
of the special committee to propose
constitutional changes to the legis
lature of 1910.
As a member of that committee
(according to what he once told the
writer in private conversation) he
proposed that the governor be given
the power to appoint the judges and
tfiat all judges be compelled to re
tire at the age of seventy. The com
mittee voted down the proposition.
Allen M. Fletcher was a member
of the legislature of 1910, the body
that recommended the changes with-j
out proper provision of filling the !
vacancies in the judgeships . that
would occur on December 1, 1914.
At the time Allen M. Fletcher
made the proposal that the governor
should appoint the judges and when
he "was a member of the legislature
that made the imperfect proposal of
a change in the constitution he was
planning and hoping to be elected
governor of the state in 1912 and be
governor of Vermont when the va
cancy in the judgeships occurred.
We shall not claim here that he
deliberately allowed the hiatus in
the proposed changes of the consti
tution to go unchallenged for the
purpose . of getting at the courts of
Vermont, but give the history above
and will allow the reader to decide
for himself who let the cat get into
the meal.
linquent on their dues for the year
pay, the association can complete its
year's work free of, debt.
The matter of continuing the or
ganization for another year could not
be acted upon at that meeting but the
statements of several practical farm
ers that they would rather pay $10
a year than to see it stop indicates
that a majority of the members want
the work continued. Doubtless it
will be necesary to increase the mem
bership fee to 2 for the next year.
but the testimony of several farmers
that they had. saved from $6 to $20
a ton on fertilizers purchased
through the association shows they
can, well afford to pay the small fee
required.
Our impression from the meeting
is that the Caledonia County Farm
ers Association will be continued
and that the fees will be kept so
reasonable that any farmer in the
county who wants to receive its ben
efits will be able to be a member and
profit by the assistance of a trained
county agent. If it does continue
the value of demonstration work will
be so well shown that it can be de
finitely decided whether or not it
will be wise to Increase it and make
it permanent.
It will seem like really "visiting
the legislature" to go to Montpelier
and find T. C. Cheney at work at
the state house. Mr. Cheney is
probably as familiar with the mak
ing of law as any person the gover
nor could have found to serve as a
revisor.
The high cost of meat Is partially
explained . by the secretary of agri
culture who said in his annual re
port that "steers raised in California
by an Oregon operator have been
shipped through Denver to Omaha
and their beef sent to points on the
Atlantic coast. Hogs raised in Illi
nois and sold at Indianapolis have
been slaughtered at Boston and a
part of their cured bacon shipped
to Los Angeles. Michigan dressed
veal calves expressed to South Water
street commission houses at Chicago
have been returned to the identical
shipping points from which they
came to fill orders from local retail
markets." Of course this ride for
dressed meat has to be paid for by
the man who eats it. It would be
interesting to know where the few
beef cattle sent out of Vermont are
finally devoured .
Caledonia County Farmers.
The special meeting of the Cale
donia County Farmers Association
on Saturday last augurs well for the
future of that organization. The
members present found that about
$600 must be raised to meet the ex
penses of the current year and nearly
all of those present voluntarily con
tributed toward that sum. It seems
clear that, if the 175 members de-

We earnestly wish the scheme to
establish an auto bus service in this
village success. The great need of
St. Johnsbury is a transportation
service that will be cheap, regular
and reasonably rapid. Electric cars
demand too large an Investment to
promise success but the auto service
can be installed for a comparatively
small sum and the machines have
been so perfected that reliable ser
vice may be expected. The success
of the scheme will make much de
sirable building territory available
and help reduce the cost of housing
that has been unreasonably expen
sive for the past decade. If honestly
and efficiently,' managed the public
may expect the auto service to be
a'great aid in the further develop
ment of the village.
Secretary of Agriculture Houston
in his annual report says that any
credit needs of the agricultural com
munity beyond those eared for un
der the federal reserve law should
be cared for by a system of "co
operative credit associations" fi
nanced with -private funds, by means
of which the combined v.. credit of
farming communities could be uti
lized, and by a system of land mort
gage banks, likewise, privately cap
italized. This is practically what
the Caledonian suggested a few
weeks ago instead of the state loan
ing money to people beginning farm
ing and it is pleased to see the idea
advocated by such a high authority
as the national secretary of agriculture.
The house of representatives gave
the knockout blow to the proposi
tion to have $250,000,000 currency
deposited in cotton and tobacco belt
banks for the relief of farmers In
those sections. The country will re
joice in this victory for sound fi
nance by the government.

The interstate commerce commis
sion recommends the compulsory
use of steel cars in passenger trains
and prohibition of the use of wooden
cars between or ahead of steel ones.
Undoubtedly, this would save some
life in the country as a whole, but
it is hard to see how a railroad in
the financial condition the Boston
and Maine can replace all Its wood
en cars with steel cars unless it is
allowed to increase its revenue by
an increase of rates. Here in Ver
mont many a man will wonder If
he is to live to see steel coaches on
the Burlington and Lamoille or the
Missisquoi Valley roads.
Horace Ward Bailey-Vermonter
An appropriate memorial to Hor
ace W. Bailey, late United States
marshal for the district of Vermont,
has been compiled by Judge Frank
L. Fish and other friends and is now
ready for distribution. The volume
is first a tribute to Mr. Bailey and
a record for future generations of
his researches in Vermont history as
well as of his unique and delightful
personality. Every page breathes
the charming, genial spirit of "Uncle
Horace." Fortunately the com
pilers have not, "doctored" the va
rious speeches and newspaper ar
tides which they have included in
the volume, but have allowed them
to remain in the style in which Mr
Bailey wrote them. The first six
chapters are a sympathetic sketch
of Mr. Bailey's life and works by
Frederic P. Wells, the historian of
Newbury.
The volume is also a valuable con
tribution to Vermont history. Mr.
Bailey's zeal for the study of the
early days of Vermont was known to
all his friends, and this volume
shows how thorough were his re
searches and how wide was his
knowledge. No student of the life
of Vermont people can afford to ne
glect the chapters which preserve
Mr. Bailey's historical writings.
All in all the Bailey book is one
of the most interesting works pub
lished in -Vermont for -many years.
Those who have followed the
course of Vermont politics during
the last twenty-five years will find
many a thrilling story. Journalists
will discover the authorship of some
of the most unique political writing
of recent decades. Best of all is the
pleasure of a few hours society wit!
Horace Bailey, the book faithfully
reflects his personality and makes
the reader feel that he is holding
fellowship with his good friend once
more.
The book is well printed and con
tains an excellent portrait. The
committee have appointed Mr.
Frank H. Chapman, 45 Mead Build
ing, Rutland, Vermont, to attend to
the distribution and as long as the
edition lasts he will send copies ai
$2 each. The books have also beeD
placed in the principal book stores
of the state for sale at the same
price.
