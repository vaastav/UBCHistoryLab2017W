Trade Union Must Not Jay Krpn
ncntntlvea in Parliament
According to a decision handed down
he other day by th English Court or
Appeal funds of trade unions may no
onger b employed for the payment or
salaries to members of Parliament As
it is exacted that the Iou of Lr
ivill confirm the decision the Labor part
s naturally much disconcerted as ony
b y such payment of salaries has it
jeen able to maintain spokesmen in the
ftouso of Commons and to hold them to
a strict accountability Obviously the
ans that have been made for th grat
ievelopment of an independent labc
pry at the next general election wi
mvo t b renounced unless meanwhil
ho application of trade union funds to
ho payment of salaries shall b authoi
lz by a statute <
Originally wages were paid by thdr
nnstituents members of the House or
Commons Thus Knights of tho Shr
eoeived four shillings day and bug
wo shillings This payment came t b
ooked upon as a burden and in H2i
tle townsmen of Cambridge made a
igrcement with their members to tke
me shilling Gradually a a matte
of practice only rich men who woul
car their ow expenses came t b
onsidered eligible for membership an
n 1710 a > statute 0 passed providin
tht a Knight of the Shire must have a
state in land worth 600 a year ad
a burgess one worth 4 Throughou
te eighteenth century before tho lrgi
ition against bribery was enacted Jb
iutlay of money on disputed election
ran often enormous Even now the ct
of a contested election in England is fror
1500 to JlO and the average yearly
lisburscments for registration and the
ocalled nursing of a constituency ar
four or five hundred pounds
Under such circumstances the num
br of men who care t pay the pric
or an assured seat in Parliament is him
It and the number willing to incu
the expense named for the mere clanc
01 a seat i still smaller As tho mem
br of Parliament are not paid yot
nust live in London during the most
df the the Hous
xpenBlvo season year Hous
of Commons Is naturally recruited In
he main from men who can afTon
the privilege I la nevertheless wel
ow that tho central office of te
liberal or Unionist party often help
0 defray a part of the election expense
f candidates in districts where the
chio of success is not great Keep
Ing this fact in view the trade union
b1vo acted for some time on the a
umption that they have a correspond
Ing right t defray the expenses of thou
pokesmcn but now a We have said
the Court of Appeal has pronounce
teir claim unwarranted
What io to b done The Radical
havo long clamored for the payment or
al members and for the transfer er
lectoral charges to the public treasury
We Sir HEXBT CAMFBELLBAKSER
1A became Prime Minister it was JUp
po that 1 bill t that effect would be
nought In by the Government but nc
jchlawhasbecn placed upon thestatuu
bok pnd it hM looked of late as If the
reject had been shelved definitely
NowoC course tho Laborites will try
r get it revived but in order to secure
the cordial assistance of the Liberal
pary they will have i stop putting UF
indidates of their own at byolectiont
In districts where the probable effect
or such action would be to assure the
ectlon of Unionist nominees The
ursuance of such a course at the net
general election might provo fatal tc
lhe Liberals I is doubtful whether
uring the remainder ot the life of this
nrliament a bill giving salaries to 01
embers of the House of Common
wi bo passed or one authorizing trade
nlons to pay their own representative
py
in Parliament I is more probable
that the Liberals will agreo to bring Ir
and pass a bill for tho payment of al
members early In tho next Parliament

In his and more sentiment

We CAn Imagine that the cue appealc
to two different eldoa of Mr Jcnirf BTON
Ibo humorous and the emotional He
has no doubt been overwhelmed by
solicitations from the rela lve and
friends of tho dismissed boys and It
is reasonably certain besides that he
found in tho situation a peg upon whlc
he could hag for purposes of ventilc
tion a number of the shrewd conceit
he has nursed and formulated since he
become a member of tho Senate He
naturally feels sorry for tho nforesal
parents who are prhoP near and der
to him and in whom behalf ho woul
do anything in reason Moreover In
submitting his bill he found an oppoi
tunity to mention a applying t hln
self a species of hazing of whlc
his friend Senator DAVIS of Ark
was really the victim and which he
greatly took to heart Everybody remembers
tremendous measut
members that trcmendou meure
prepared and submitted by DAVIS
propre
having for its object tho total annihi
lation of all trusts good bad and In
different and which to his DATisE
amazement disappeared and 8 neve
heard of afterward A chosen Iew
hea nterar
are aware of the bewilderment Into
which DAVIS was plunged by the unac
countable eclipse and of the affectlopaU
admonitions throng
almost hysterical admonitons thrugh
which Senator JoHNSTON implored him
t consider Rule 2 of the Senate and
to enlist ALDRIch HAL and othe
veteran leaders hi his effort to evad
it Tills Is where JOUNSTON was hazed
vicariously In the person of his boson
and stand in hi
friend vIsand tears stnd his
eyes today 0 he recalls i DAVIS h0
not yet found Rule 2 and recent event
in Arkansas and the nation at large
have led or may have 10 him to doubt
whether such men as ALDIUCQ and HUE
are now anxious to usher in a dispensa
tlon under when the Mpnoy Devi
would b forever extirpated and al
It myrmidons imprisoned for life
JOHNSTON however has not yet leane
to look upon DAVIS without unutterabli
emotion and Rule 2 and tho Octopu
and tho Ozarks are always in tho bad
of his mind when he gives way tse
timcnt
But Senator JOHNSTON I a disci pi i
narian when it comes to practice Hi
was a solder in the civil war he hai
been a manufacturer and a succcssfu
banker and he knows that the serioiu
affairs of life cannot b conductor
upon the happy go lucky plan contemplated
plated in his bill t reinstate the ex
pelled cadets His motives in intro
ducing that bill are visible enough but
its permanent occultation will not move
him t look up Rule 2 and marshal the
fathers of tho Senate for its exploits

The Conversion of Mr Kuosevelt
Two years ago almost to a day
President ROOSEVEW in the exercise
ho called constitutiona
of what cle amy cntttonal
power discharged without honor R
battalion of the Twentyfifth Infantry
for complicity in the Brownsville mid
and conspiracy to shield thp guilty In
his message to Congress on December
hi m080 Cng Dcmbr
19 1006 Mr ROOSEVELT declared that
many of those noncommissioned officers
cers and men must bave known and all
of them may have known circum
stances which would have led to the
conviction of those engaged in the
murderous assault S without patiently
tiently and investigating
tent ad thoroughly Invetgatng
the raid with the powerful means at his
disposal with the view of retaining the
innocent in the army and turning the
evidence tending to implicate suspected
men over to tho civil authorities in
Texas Mr ROOSRVRLT made I clean i
sweep of the battalion
Mr ROOSEVELT would listen at that
lime t no explanation of the silence or
denial of the men whom ho thrust from
the service nor would lie allow that there
rould b any extenuation of their con
duct In saying nothing or denying their
git Constructively none of them
iras innocent in his opinion Why Mr
ftoOBBVEur has made a new inveetlga
ton of the Brownnvillo raid with detec
lye reur that could liatfe been em
ployed two years ago may some time
ippear but we note that the President
In his recent message to Congress en
closing an alleged confession obtained
rom one of lie discharged soldiers b
an illiterate negro employed to extort
confessions declares that almost al
er the members of Company B were
oncorned in the shooting or were
iccomplices thafproctioally every
manIn Companies O and Dhad knowl
ege that tho shooting was done by
Company B men and possibly one or
wo others in one of the other troops
Ir ROOSKVKLT a a military man
hovild have 1 e the infantry term
ompany
Nevertheless the President at the
end of two years of positive opinion of
dual and constructive guilt has con
cude that if the accomplices and con
fplrttol would not tel what they knew
bout the raid there was an explanation
in their fear of reprisals by the guilty
and there wax extenuation in the un
wise and improper attitude of others
who encouraged them to shield the
uilty So tho President now proposes
hat exsoldiers of the battalion who
rove that they were not implicated In
ho affair and will turn States evi
dence shall IK reinstated in the army
Ir ROOSEVELT recommends that Con
ress ntithoriio the Secretary of War
to hear the evidence submitted and
estoro to the service those whom he
finds to have been innocent and to
be ready t inform against other mem
ers of the battalion
In his first Brownsville message dts
barging tho battalion Mr ROOHEVKIT
I iranded the conspiracy of silence as
only less block than the original
crime of which be said A blacker
eyer stained the annals of the army
Ills conspiracy of silence does not
eem 8 black to him now in fact
he would welcome the return to
e colors of conspirators who turn

he still maintains to save his fle
that almost all thooldiero wero actt

the apparent location of an editorial 10
Tiu SUM of December 1 beaded Fre
l Dimbr
Hldeita t brteff t tight the fact JI rta
ton to this brl hl e I venture to Ind
you Ibis letter hoping t correct the coach
4loni anhed at which eorrea entirely to
mlM the actual facts
aereejfaat the statistic which you Quote
are of no value la an argument of thIs kin
The amount of exports of boot and Ihoe
and Uatber Is affected by other condltloi
to such an extent that deductions dran
from these figures are valueless The nrt
itatement to which I would make oWe
lion I u follows
The tariff of isis removed tbe dutr > and bide
were oo the free Hit from 1172 until IW7 wben
the pica of the farmers and the need of their votel
led to tbe transfer of rUle hide from tie free
to the dutiable Kit
Ic
I believe there U no evidence to ihow Ihat
It was tbe plea of the farmer that cause
this ta to be levied The farrnera hav
many representative In the national hoW
but the tariff bill of 1697 went t the Sane
with hides on the free list This tax of U
per cent was added to the bill In the Bnte
by Mr Stewart backed by a coterie of
Populist Senator from the Northwest aDd
they cannot I believe be truthfully show
to have represented the farming Interes
of the country
Pausing over your argument as to how the
elect of the duty could be ascertained your
conclusion Is expressed as follows
There every probability that free bides would
make only a trUIng difference In tbe price of
hide tod that the transfer of bides t the fre
lit would make no difference whatever to tbe
men ot the flnlihed product
I believe exactly the opposite or lhh
statement can be shown to be tbe truth
hides are a commodity possessing a world
wide market and the price of bides Is txd
10 the markets of the world and while local
conditions or temporary and excessive de
mand may for a short time affect the prc
In any given locality In the long run and In
he general result the price of hides nndl
its level the world o e with as much can
alnty as tbe water seeks its level In tbe
le An artificial restraint such as the la
> n bides levied In this country slmpl
> perates to make the price of hides in tbll
xmntry IS per cent higher than the aye
tee price In the markets of the world That
Ile prc
his has ben the result of this tariff no
ntelllgent man familiar with market con
IttlonR since this tax was levied will under
ake to deny But this difference or 1
> er cent which the user of hides In tbe
Jnlted States have Uter pay for the laat
ileven years does not Indicate the tul
neasure of their burden
buren
mealur well known fact that the gras
lacking Industry originally controlled a
ery large part of all the hides taken off In
his country of the class on which the duty
II levied From the first they have natu

THE THREE NOTCH ROADS
Drliln of System of Traveller GnldM
In the Ozark
from the Kanmt City Star
Three notch rood ore numerous la ttrt
timbered parts of southern Missouri and
northern Arkansas Any one who has ever
travelled In those sections of the country
nlll know that a three notch road Is a publls
dlghwar as distinguished from a road lead
Ing to a sawmill a church or a echoolhouss
Daok In the woods or to a farmhouse A
three notch road goes somewhere If the
traveller follow It he will reach a town In
time rf the streams are not too high or too
iwlft to be forded
It seems tbat among the offences of
teorgo III King of England not men
toned In the Declaration of Independent
yes that he required all public roads to bt
narked with his name England and lit
olonles publld roods have1 been known AS
he kings highway BO long that nobody
mows when the custom began there
ave always been private lanes and rights
or way but an authorized public road ws
ilware the kings highway When King
leorgo required his pame to be posted at
convenient points on the kings highway In
he colonies the people of that time wern
lot particularly proud of their duty and
wherever they could they adopted the pol
Icy of cutting throe notches on trees alonr
he road and omitting the reference to King
Jeorce
After the Revolutionary war the nam
rae omitted altogother but the thiro
lotcbes proved a useful way of marking
ho public roads The Virginia colonists
arried this system t6 Tennessee Kentucky
md Indiana and their children brought
It to Missouri In early days the roads in
llssourl were built first by the Territory
ind then by the State
There were two reasons for this procedure
At firstthere were no counties and later
the State realized that If the matter were
left to counties there would be very little
oad building So the State built roods
ndtnarkeAthem with three notches Later
when tbo counties began to build roads
hey were marked In tbe timbered country
rlth two notches
Before and during the civil war thin
Initiation was preserved and three notch
roads wore always through roads leading
rom one town of some importance to
nother Two notch roads were loss 1m
ortant highways while roadanot botched
were either rail roads or plank roads A
rill road was a road leading some camp
rhere men wore splitting rolls while n
lank road led to a sawmill This was the
ernacular of the Ozarks In the swamp
ruintry of southeast Missouri some toll
oad were built of plank and were known
here as plank roads The three notch

B sure his violent exercise affected his

The lists of his hits and misses are pr
