Undor the head of "Up Goes Pig
Iron," the Jacksonville Timet-Union
says: In spite of the wreck and ruin
advertised to follow iu the wake of
Democratic tariff reform,
reform bill has been announced and is
reasonably certaiu of being passed, the
slight changes that have boen made in«'
the industrial situation have been for
tho better, not for the worse. Carnegie's
companies are preparing to capture.- the
iron and steel industry of the country,
and it looks ns if Mr. Itockafeller pro
' poses to take a band in the business as
a competitor. He is preparing to buy
the Bteel plant at West Superior and
will build other works large enough to
make himself the rival of the great iron
and steel king of America.
And at the south the outlook of the
iron and steel business is equally, if Hot
more, eucouraging. The Nashville
Afncrkan; in the same issue that pub
lished the decision of tlib Democrats of
the ways and means committee, also
published the statement that the T
nesseeCoal, Iron and Railway Company
had made another advanco of 25 cents
per ion on pig iron. On tho subject Mr.
Shook says : "The general outlook of
the iron trade is surprisingly encourug
ing. A few days ago Mr. Baxter, tho
president of the company, reported that
ho had sold 56,000 tons. Since then the
company has sold an additional 30,000
tons at an advance of 25 cents over the
price paid for the 30,000 tons. Of this
80.000 tons, American consumers took
15.000 tons, and London bankers took
15.000 tons
foreign purchasers also authorized an
offer for the output of four of the com
pany's furnaces for six mdnths at the
same price, which would amount to
100.000 tons, as an investment. The
offer was declined, as the company feels
confident that iron is going higher."
Mr. Shook also said: "We have sold
160.000 tons of iron for future delivery,
which makes the position of the com
pany such that its directors feel justi
fied in making still another advance of
25 cents per ton, which was done to
day."
Of course these trades were made be
fore the ways and means committee an
nounced its decision in relation to the
iron schedule, but, in the face of that
decision, the price went up. This does
not look much like wreck and ruin.
Concurrently the telegraph informs
ub that the Cleveland Rolling Mills
Company's mills will start up this week,
that the Edgar Thomson Steel Works,
at Braddock, Pa., employing 800 men,
wouid resume work Monday, that the
entiro sheet mill department of the
■Ætna Standard Iron and Steel Com
pany, at Wheeling, employing 1,500
, would start on full time Monday,
and that the Wheeling Steel and Iron
Company, employing about 600 men,
would start its Ben wood mill Monday.

among the people of Florida, it will

to the people of Florida, however, about
$24,750 per annum,

of any part of the bounties for which

But when the Ledger says that the re

a
memory.

would have been astounded at tho prop

averaging nearly fifty per cent. In 1833
—just 00 years ago, when the infant in

really young—Mr. Clay
arranged the famous compromise tariff,
providing that duties, so far as the ad
valorem rates exceeded 20 per cent,
should be reduced one-tenth of the cx
the first of January in each
alternate year until 1841. The country
prospered under that tariff, as it did
under the Walker tariff, with an aver
erage duty of 20* per cent. There was
call for 47 per cent 'props' then.
Nor was such a measure as the McKin
ley abomination deemed necessary, even
for the purpose of raising a war rev
, when the Morrill tariff was
adopted, in 1860. The average duty
under that tariff was about 30 per cent.
If that 'prop' was sufficient for protec

The annual report of the Secretary of
the Interior shows that there
966,012 pensioners on the rolls at the
close of t he fiscal year ending June 30th,
being 89,944 more than were carried on
the rolls at the close of the preceding
fiscal year. Among the number
15 widows and 2 daughters of Revo
lutionary soldiers; 86 survivors of the
war of 1812; 14,149 survivors of the
Mexican war, and 2,544 survivors of the
Indian w
were
of 1832-43.
The total
amount expended for pensions during
the fiscal year was $156,740,467.14.
During the year there were 192,188 pen
sion certificates issued; 123,634 persons
added to the rolls, and 33,690 dropped
"from all causes." Wholesale frauds,
involving the allowance of hundreds of
fraudulent pension claims, were dis
covered at Norfolk, Va., and in New
Mexico and Iowa; and the stoppage of
payment of illegal pensions in these
three localities has saved the govern
ment an amount annually nearly equal
to the expense of the entire force of
special examiners. When it i
bered that this work of examiners has
been in progress for but six months, and
that the payment of the pensions would
have continued for
rami m
average of
, the immense saving
nearly twenty y
to Vie government can be realized.
The report says that tho sole duty
and aim of these special examiners is to
get at the facts of every case examined,
and all examinations of witnesses rela
tive to particular claims
notice to the clainiauts, who may par
ticipate therein and may themselves
procure witnesses for examination. The
work of this division has largely in
creased and an additional appropriation
of $300,000 has been asked to make it
more effective. There is some encourage
ment to hope that the pension expendi
tures have nearly reached their
in the confidence expressed by
the report that the appropriation of
$165,000,000 for the current fiscal year
will be ample, and the expectation that
several millions of this sum will be
turned back into tho treasury. For the
fiscal year 1895 the estimated expendi
tures arc $160,000,000; which may be
another indication that this enormous
peusion flood has reached high-water
mark. Counting five persons to a family
and putting the population of the United
States at 65,000,000, it is ovulent that the
average tax per family for the payment
of the pension fund alone reaches about
$12.70 per annum! Suppose each head
of a family had to fork that
in a lump, instead of having it in
sidiously drained from his pocket by
driblets !

unnecessarily
It is throughout the utterance of a
man who says what he has to say with
cogent conciseness, directness and_
plicity. For reasons of which he is
himself the best judge, the President
does not consider tho time yet conic to
make Congress and the people fully in
formed as to the details of the Hawaiian
controversy—reserving that subject for
a special message—but he assures the
country that he has been ongaged in
endeavoring to bring about a just solu
tion of this matter—inherited from the
Harrison administration—"within the
constitutional limits of the executive
power, and, recognizing all
Hons and responsibilities growing out of
any changed conditions brought about by
our unjustifiable interference." With
this assurance, which was, indeed, not
needed to convince his countrymen at
large that tho President

well-matured plan that will justify
itself in its results, the country can
well afford to await the outcome in
placidity and confidence. Upon the
much
obliga
acting with
vital issue of tariff revision
the President—as every one knew he
would—stands
tho ground which lie
took with such firmness and earnest
ness in his memorable message of
six years ago. "After a bard strug
gle," he says, "tariff reform is di
rectly before us. Nothing so important
claims our attention and nothing so
clearly presents itself as both
tunity and a duty—an opportunity to
deserve tho gratitude of our fellow
citizens and a duty imposed upon us
by our oft-repeated professions and by
tho emphatic mandate of the people.
Nothing should intervene to distract our
attention or disturb our efforts until this
reform is accomplished by caretul and
wise legislation." It would be difficult,
indeed, to place the very gospel of
Democratic tariff revision more forci
bly before the nation than tho President
has done in these three sentences.

The city of Brunswick, Ga., which
for nearly three months has been isolated
by the yellow fever quarantine, has at
length been restored to communication
with the rest of tbo country. The epi
demic has been knocked out by the frost
and the city is virtually dear of the
disease, although tho appo&runce of a
few new cases may be expected among
the returning refugees who have been
so long shut out from their homes. It is
stated, however, that all houses that
have been properly aired and fumigated
may now be considered safe. A recapitu
lation of the epidemic gives a total of
1,003 cases that have been reported
under treatment; of which there
322 whites, G80 colored, and one China
man. The Chinaman died, and
there were 43 fatal cases among
the white« and only 13 among the
colored patients; makin a total
death roll of 56; the average ratio of
mortality being only 54 per cent. This
ratio is believed to be tho lowest in the
history of any epidemic and certainly
speaks well for the skilful treatment of
tho disease by tho attending physicians.
Other elements to be taken into account
have been the good sanitary condition
of the city and the large number of
colored patients to whom tho epidemic
no more serious as a rule than ordi
nary attacks of malarial ailments. Most
important, however, has been the demon
stration that the enlightenment of recent
discoveries and advances in pathogeny
has gone so far to rob this disease of
its old-time virulence and to bring it so
much more under the control of tho
intelligent physician of to-day. This
modern knowledge has enabled the
Brunswick physicians to

black vomit, heretofore considered the
last and moat dangerous stago of the
disease, had appeared.

The Philadelphia Ledger explains that
while it is opposed to tho Wilson bill,
and while it is unwilling to appear to
confirm, by silence, any impression that
it is the " organ " of the administration,
it " has always believed that no more
public-spirited, purer American has ever
occupied the Presidential offleo than
Grover Cleveland," and that " this faim
and belief it entertains to-day as strongly
as it has ever done, for the obvious
reason that it has had
cause for re
jecting the smallest measure of it."
though the President should ap
prove tho Wilson bill "tho Ledger will
not, therefore, assume that he is iusiu
that he lacks devotion to the
E
cere,
well-being of the people. We shall be
lieve, continues the' Ledger, " that his
judgment, not bis public spirit nor bis
high integrity, is at fault. This great
economic question is one with regard to
which the Ledger recognizes there may
be honest differences of opinion

those who do uot think
it are less sincere, less earnest for tho
public good than we are,
we do about
the respect
which we a3k for the sincerity of
views we cheerfully givo to the opinions
of those who disagree with us." This

II. G. Dun & Co. report business
slowly gaining, and note that there has
been groat encouragement during tho
past week in tho fact that November
payments are far more satisfying than
was feared. " Legislative uncertain
ties," they say, '' weigh heavily, but
other loads many ovorlook. The past
depression, with trading and manufac
turing failures involving more than
$»35,000,000 in nine months, besides
banking failures of enormous liabilities
and failures of railway and other firms,
involve continual embarrassments
which men are prone to forget." We
should say so. That there is

To get well away from so
pleasant
a comparison, tho reader should indulge
in dramatic license, let four years elapse
and come to the youngster in the fore
ground of to-day's picture. His dress
is as boyish as himself, and is made of
striped blue and white woolen stuff,
trimmed with white cheviot. The blouse
has a full front of white cheviot and
jacket fronts that turn back to form
revers. It buttons
the jacket front. The revers
with white cheviot and embroidered in
tho corners. The back is plain. The
large white sailor collar is plain, but the
cuffs are embroidered like the revers.
The tiny skirt is about 18 inches long
and is gathered to a band. Around the
waist conics a heavy white silk cord
finished with big pompoms. The dress
is lined with white cambric, and in the
background another vi
longer the thing to have your
skirts rustle, because that no longer
guarantees silk lining. There comes
now a cotton lining that can out-rustie
silk, so now you must not allow your
skirts to rustle ami if you have the
mentioned cottou lining in, take it out,
because its rustle says "cotton, cotton"
and nothing else. If you have real
silk, take it out for it says "cotton,
cotton" just like the other. Dress
makers will tell you that skirts lined
with silk wear better, hang better or
something, so maybe you will have sjjk
just the same, only it must not rustle.
A new way of applying banded skirt
trimming is shown in this picture. The
garniture is alike on both sides, tho row
of rosettes coming in in the centre and
all the ends meeting iu
rosette in back. The same pattern is
reproduced on the bodice. The costume
thus ornamented is made of water green
faille and trimmed with emerald green
velvet ribbon, velvet of the same shade
beiug used for the ribbons and roset tes.
ITie bodice has a fitted lining and hooks
in front beneath the rosettes, the stuff
being takcu on tho bias to do away with
seams. It has a square decolette
finished with a band of gold embroid

immense puffs, stiffened with thin
haircloth and finished with the
velvet. The skirt is almost plain at the
waist, while at tho bottom it flares con

THREE SHIP CONTRACTS.
All Awarded by Sen
Newport News Shipbuilding Company.
Washington, Dec. 5.— The three
light-draught gunboats authorized by
the last Congress of about 1,200 tons dis
placement will all bo built by the New
port News Shipbuilding Company at
their bid of $230,000 for each vessel.
Tho contract was to-day awarded by
Secretary Herbert, who was delayed in
acting upon the matter until now, while
tho board of which Commodore Walker
is president was examining their plans
to prevent any more ships of the navy
being found top-heavy and cranky after
they are constructed. Tho plans for all
three ships were found to be perfect,
and there is no possibility under which
any of the vessels can be found to be
not stable and safe.
Tho Newport News firm is the first
south of Baltimore that
dry Horbert to the
ever
warded a contract to build vessels for
navy. Their bids
astoundingly low that naval officers are
wondering how it isposaiblo to
struct tho vessels without great loss.
The company admit an expectation of
losing money on the work, but
ing to have it so
chance of building the ships for the
government.
Two of tho vessels are of the same de
sign and are intended for service in
Asiatic waters. Their hulls are specially
designed for the shallow rivers of China
and the shelving hanks. Ample pro
tection is to be given their rudders to
prevent injury by snags and bars which
abound in most of the streams.
