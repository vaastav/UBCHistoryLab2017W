It Is hardly necessary for meto stats itiat the
questions arising from our relatloua with 11a
wuli haveoiiuaed serious embarrassment Just
prior to the Installation ot the present Admin

had been suddenly, overthrown, and a treaty
of annexation had been negotiated between
the I'rorislonal Government of the Islands und
the I nltsd Mates, nnd submitted tothe Henute
for ratification. This treaty 1 withdrew for ex
amination, and despatched the Hon James II.
lllount of GoorglA to Honolulu as a special

tion ot the circumstance attending the
change of Government, nnd of ull the con
dition Lesilng upon tho subject of tho

examination Sir. lllount submitted to me
his report, showing beyond all question
that tho constitutional Govorument of Hawaii
hnil been subverted with tho actlvonld of our
representative to that Government, olid
through tha Intimidation caused by the pres
ence uf nn ntmed, naval force of that nited
Mates which was landed lor that purpose at
Ihelintanco ot our .Minister. I ion tho facts
developed It scorned to me tho only lionoiubla
course for our Government tu pursue was to
undiiu the wrung that had been dnnu by those
representing us and to restore as far as practi
cable the status existing at tho time uf our
forcllde Intervention. VWthavlewof accom
plishing this result within the constitutional
limits of enocutive power und rscognlringnll

by our unjustifiable Interference, our present

unavoidable result ot the distressing eliln
gonay whloh has prevailed thioughotit the
country during much of the time covered by

when better times were Anticipated it was
estltnatod by his predecessor that the de

would be but a little over a million and a halt
dollars. It amounted, howevor, to more than

Tho method ot employing mechanical labor

The Secretary of the Interior has the super
vision ot so many Important subjects that his
report Is nt especial valuo and Interest.
Gn tho lltlth day of Juno. 1H0.I. there were on
Iho pension rolls JhkI.oiv names, an Increase
uf 80,1)44 ovor the number ou the roll June
,'10, 181 IV. Uf these theru were 17 widows and
daughter uf Ilevolutlonary soldiers, BO sur
vivors of the war of IH1V, 0.4V5 widows ot sol
diers ot that war, Vl.r.lMsurvlvors and wldoss
ot the Mexican war. 3.(482 survivors nnd wid
ows of Indian wars, V84 army nurse, nnd
475,045 survivors aud widows and children uf
deceased soldiers and sailors ut tho war ot the
rebellion. Uhe latter uumbor represents
those penslouad 011 account of disabilities ur
ilsatlt resulting from nrmy nnd navy service.
The number nt persons remaining on tho rolls
June 30, lKI't, who wero pensioned under III"
act of June V7. 181 hi, which allows pensions on
account of deuth and disability nut clmiguubla
to army son Ice, was 4oHliVi
The number added to the rolls during tho
year was 1V.U1.I4, and thu number dropped
was 33.000. 'Ihu first payments un pensions
allowed during the yeararaountcil to j;i.l,7.'0,
54008. This Includes ariears. ur the accumu
lation between the timo from which Hie allow
ance ot pension dstes and thu time of ucttuvlly
granting thu certificate.
Although the law of 1800 permits pensions
for disabilities nut related to military service,
yet as a rouulslte to Its beuellts a disability
must exist Incapacitating applicants "from
the Performance ut manual labor to such u
degreo as to render them unable to earn a
support" Tha exeoutlon ot this law in Its
early stages does not seem to have been In ac
cord with Its truo Intention; but toward tha
close of the last Administration an aiithoii
tatlve construction was given to the
statute, and elnco that time Hits cousti nc
tlon has been followed. Thl has had the
effect of limiting tho operation ut thu
law to Its Intended purpose. Tho discovery
having been made thut many liauiu hud been
put upon the pensluti roll by menus of whole
sale and gigantic frauds, thu (ommlssloner
suspended payments upon a number of pen
sions which seemed lo be ftuiidulenl ui un
authorised pending a coiiibletitevuiiioiall.il,
giving notice to the ponsioueis in older thai
they might have an opportunity to establish ,t
possible, tho justice of thcli claims iiotvvith
standing apparent Invalidity
This, I understand. I the pra tico width ha
for 11 long time prevailed lu the Pension
Bureau, but after entering upon thuse recent
Investigations the ( ommlslutier modified this
lule so a not tu allow, until niter a complete
examination. Interference with the pay ment of
u pension apparently not altogether void, but
which merely had burn fixed at a rata higher
than that authoilred by law.
I aui unablu lo undemtuudwhy frauds lu the
pension rolls should nut be exposed and cm
reeled with thoroughness and vlgur. Uvety
name fraudulently put upon these rolls Is 11
wicked Imposition Ubuu the kindly sentiment
In which pensions have their origin, every
fraudulent pensioner baa become u bud citi
zen: evury false oath In support of a pensluti
has made perjury morecuiiimon. aud false and
undeserving pensioners rob the people not
only of their money, but uf the patriotic senti

The condition of thu Indians nnd their ulti
mate fate are subjects which are rulatud to a
sacred duty of the Government, und which
strongly appeal tu the sense ol justice aud the
sympathy uf uur people
Our Indians uuiuber nbout V4 8.000. Most ot
them are located 011 J01 reservations, contain
. gh0.1IU5'H acres of land. About llO.OOOof
these Indians have, to a lurge degree, adopted
civilized customs, l.uuds In severalty have

1 OOO.OOO acres Thu number ot Indian dov
eminent schools open duilug theyearwus HO,
an Increase of IV over thu receding year, uf
this total 170 were on reservations, of which
73 were boaruiug schools uud 07 were day
schools. Twenty boarding schools and 5 day
schools supported by the Government vveru
not located on reservations. The total num
ber ot Indian children enrolled during Ihu

an Increase uf l.'-'Jl over the enrollment lor
