neHi tapeK eoneequeutly I ean
to talk to you
In tlte fitst plaee I reached my
Lome in Texas on tlte Sunday before
the election and I ftwttd that I bad ih1
lobt anything by leaving my caruitaicn
in tbe Itattds of my friends ami taking
tbe stump 1b behalf of tbe National
DemoeratleeaHdtdatesaijd tbe platform
upon whieh tkey stood for the suf
frages of tbe Amerieau people Tlie
prohibition movement has assumed in
iueouftiderate proportions in Texas and
my position jo regard to pro4iiWion
was iksed against me by that party
Tbe Republicans took advantage of Ibis
circumstance and after working hard
succeeded in uniting the Ilepubiteau
Prohibition Greenback ami Labor
witrrs agaioet me with all the other
ihroatMled elemetilo Tbii was not
enough Tbe proteeteti indt s ries wish
ed to rebuke me for my oommittees
lull ami retire me te private life and
through tlte Kepubiiean party these
industries toured money Into my dis
trict which was freely wed in tlte at
tempt to defeat me Two years ago
my majority was 5MM but by absent
ing utyaelf and by the combination of
all tlie soreheads and disturbers I lost
5Wi votes and was elected by a majority
of 5 300
I was worked bard duriag the cam
paign and from speaking in the open
air ki often I contracted a disease of
tbe throat from whieh even yet I have
not fully recovered I have been con
stantly under tlte treatment of phy
sician ami ltave not regained my
strength Wlten I spoke in New Al
bany I was a very ill man and tbe
next speech I delivered was two days
afterward in New York I was too
rick to continue and was forced to
leave the platform and refrain from any
further efforts on tlte stump
Jumping away from politics a mo
ment seems as if the Texas heavens are
weeping over the Democratic defeat
It lias been raining heavily sinee the
election wKh but little susehiue This
hasinjifted the eotlon in Central and
Ktsieru Texas a ltd tlte crop will be
feltort folly gfteen ier eent
Kentucky is my native State and
consequently 1 lake a keen Interest In
her pontics While the Democratic
Presidential vote shows small falling
off from that of 1SS4 1 am glad to bee
that tlte Democrats have gained a
Congressman and that the Republicans
will have bttt two members from Ken
tucky in the next nou I was born
and reared in Elkton down in Todd
county attu anuougn Texas is my I
iKHue I never forget that I am a Ken
luekian
At the eleetioH Just over it was the
misfortune of tlte Democratic party
that tlte tariff issue was nut sooner
brought before the people Tlie time
was too short to edueate the voters up t
H asd the question could not be fully
discussed by the Democratic leaders or
folly understood by tbe people Tbe
people did not vote on the tariff and
that issue has nothing 10 do with the
defeat of Cleveland I make this state
ment advisedly because in the thickly
populated manufacturing centers the
Democrats gained votes and lost
ground In the Western ncricultural
districts Money in In liana and
tresohery in New York defeated Grover
Cleveland the best President the coun
try ever had and placed the Republi
can party at tbe head of the nations
affairs Indiana was flodeil with
money and I understand the Republi
cans etulni to have purchased 18000
floating voters nt prices ranging from a
pint of whisky to SI00 This does not
include tlie expenses of the campaign
and SI 600060 would not be a small es
timate to daee the money dumped by
the llepuhltetui party into that State
during tlte Campaign Treachery and
tiiekery ami a traitorous swapping of
vH in New York carried tlie day for
tbe Republicans iu that State The
Republicans did tint confine their brib
ery Indiana but flooded all the doubt
ful Conref shiiial dbiiiets or even
those in u hieh tbe R riubtieau8 thought
they had a thing chance for sueoes I
am informed that some money was
bent to Louisville and I know that
money was freeli used in mine
Of course I am disappointed over
the result or the election and no one
can poslbly feel ivowe than I do about
it A Democratic is like a dog the
more you beat him the better he gete
and the Democrats have not yet given
Hp tbe fight for priuciules and the
rights of the masses against the de
mands and encroachments of the class
es The tariff issue will not be allow
ed to sink into insignificance but front
this time forward for tlie next four
years it will be kept before the people
There will be no slacking up from now
on until tlie damnable system of mo
nopoly Is torn out by the Toots No
time will be lost and the tariff will be
given to tlie people until they are edu
cated up to it for their benefit this issue
is put forward by tbe Democratic
party We want them to thoroughly
understand that it is the fight of Demo
cracy with the people and the masses
on one side and the Republicans the
present system of monopolistic taxa
tion aitd the classes on the other
Sectionalism had much also to do
with the defeat of the Democratic
party There are some Southern meu
on tite Ways and Means Committee
and on this account a bitter and par
tisan warfare was waged against Tariff
Reform as reoomended by that bill
Iu the East sectionalism is nut nearly
so long prolonged or so bitter a3 it Is in
the Western and Northwestern States
Western Democrats are not that way
but the Western Republicans are evi
dently Mtprised that duriug President
Clevelands Administration the Con
federate capital was not again estab
lished at Richmond That sectional
feeling was thoroughly and complete
tely stirred up in the Western States
and was brought forward by these bit
ter Republicans for all it was worth
The Republicans thought a wluuiug
card could be made by etirriug up bit
terness and hate
I eannot say anything about the
probable public policy of Fresident elect
Harrison I have not the honor of
that Republican leaders acquaintance
and consequently lam iu ignorance of
what will le the course pursued in tlie
South where are the existing race dif
ferences attd troubles I cau say this
ltowever that tbe Republican party
will try to perpetuate itself in power
and will stop at m means by which
this end may be gained No revolu
tionary methods will be too harh for
the Administration to undertake in the
South and we need not be surprised at
any sectional measures or means used
in tbe South
IJefore the next Prestdental election
in lfett there u ill be four more States
of the Union gained by the admission
of th Territories or Dakota Wyoming
Montana and Washington These
Slates will semi eight Senators to the
United States Senate Of these Dakota
and Washington Territory will send
ltepublieans but if Wyoming and
Montana get In tltey may prove doubt
ful States as to their iKtlitics
If tlte Republicans have a majority
of one member iu Congress some meas
ures will be adopted by which this ma
jority will be increased to twelve or
fifteen iu order that they might have a
clear working advantage on all prty
or financial questions and issues

death with 11 relentless grasp snatches
from our midst those whom we love
claiming them ns His owu Que by
one as the reared leaves of the forest
we fall After a short illness of two
weeks with a disease which Uj filed the
skill of experienced physicians our
dear sister to whom the world was
bright and full of promise was cut
down and forced to leave the dearest
treasures known to earth The tendrils
of love so fondly entertained around
our hearts were suddenly snapped and
to day we shed tears over a new made
grave feeling that our loss is irrepar
able Fr in this death the church
loses a faithful member the Sunday
school an earnest teaaher and tbe
Womans Christian Temperance Union
one of its most efficient workers Deep
ly deploring this sad bereavement we
feel that life la action and is measured
by experience not lime While the
subject of this sketch was young In
years yet sue was faithful in every
good cause and full of never failing
devotion to the cause of her Savior
contributing iu many ways to His ser
vice
To tlie bereaved relatives in this dark
hour of afllleilon much sympathy is ex
tended yet they mourn not as those
without hope for they know that the
spirit of their loved one has only waft
ed Its flght to a bright home of the
soul where beside the great White
Throne a guardian augel she stands
Willi oulstretclied hands calling ua

By building a bridge of faith over Hie
river of death may we see There is no
death what seems so Is transition
and we Ixtvv iu uncomplaining submis
sion to a divine will Awaiting tlie
filial call from him who said come
up higher may our guidiug star
ever be the beacon light above where
we all hope to meet tin that resurrec
tion morn when the earth shall give
up her dead
Oh how sweet it will be
In that beautiful land
So free from all sorrow- and pain

And with harps in our hands
