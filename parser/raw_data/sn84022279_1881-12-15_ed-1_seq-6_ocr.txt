live a savage lite undisturbed by any enrn
oat nnil well-directed efforts to brine them
under the influences of civilization, and the
unsatisfactory results which have sprung
from this policy are becoming apparent
to all. Ai the white settlements have
crowded the borders of the reservations the
Indians have sometimes contended ,and
sometimes, against their will, have been
transferred to other hunting grounds,
from which they have again been dislodged
whenever their new-found homes have been
desired by adventurers and settlers. These
removals, and the frontier collisions ot

It Is profitless to discuss here which of them
has been chiefly responsible for the distur
bances whose recital occupies so large a
space upon the pages ot our History
We
have to deal with the appalling fact that
r.miirh thousands ot lives nave Deen saun-
fioed .. and hundreds of millions of
dollars expended in the attempt
'- to solve the Indian problem, it
has ' until within the past few
' yearn seemed scarcely nearer a solution
than it was half a century ago. But the

steadily feeling its way to the adoption of a
policy wnicn nas aireauy pruunceu giumy
ing results, and which, in my judgment, is
jiKeiy, u uongressano uie juwumc auwiu
in ita support, to relieve us from the diffl-
culties which have hitherto beset us. Far
. the success of the ellorts now be
ing made to introdnce among the
Indians the customs and pursuits
: of civilized life, and gradually to absorb
' them into a imass of our citizens, sharing
' . their rights and holding Uiem to tlieir re
tmnnsihf lities. there is imperative need foi
"' legislative action JMy suggestion in that
regard will be chiefly such as have been al
ready called to the attention of Congress
and have received to some extent its con
sideration.
, First I recommend the nassacre of an act
- making the laws of the various States and
. Territories applicable to the Indian reserva
,v'' tions within their borders, and extending
: the portion or the Indian Territory not oe
oiinied bv the five civilized tribes. The
, Indian should receive the protection of the
law, lie siiouiu tie anowcu to niuiuiain in
' : court his rieht of person and property. He
has repeatedly hegged for this privilege. Its
in his r)rorress toward civilization.
Second Of euen greater importance is a
. ' measure, which has been frequently recom
mended by my predecessors in ollice, and in
furtkerance of which several bills have
Iuaii from time to time introduced in both
hones of Congress. The enactment ot a gen
eral law permitting allotment in severalty,
to such Indians at least as deserve
. it. . of ft reasonable quantity of
: land secured to thciu by
patent, and for their own protection, made
..- innltenaoie ior twenty or tweniy-nve years,
is demanded for their present welfare and
" their permanent advancement. In return
for such considerate action on the "part of
tlie uovcrnmeni tnere is reason to ueucve
that the Indians, in large numbers, would
be persuaded to sever their tribal relations
' and to engage at once in agricultural pur
suits. Many of them realize the fact that
their hunting days are over and that
it is now for their best interests to conform
"" their manner ef life to the new order of
things, and by no greater inducement than
the assurance of a permanent title to the
Boil can they be led to engage in the occu
pation of tilling it. The well-attested re
ports of their increasing interest in
husbandry justify the hope and
belief that the enactment of
such a statue as I recommend would be
at once attended with gratifying results.
A resort to the allotment system would
- have a direct and powerful influence in dis-
solving the tribal bond which is so promi
nent a feature of savage lite and which tends
to strongly to perpetuate it.
Third I advise a liberal appropriation
for the support of Indian schools be
cause of my confident belief that
a course is consistent with
nit wihmi eiiiiiiiui cvni (Minriiif. mn iuni
uncultured' Indian tribes, mere is re
ported to be a general and argent desire on
for the education of their children. It is
unfortunate in view of this fact that during
the past year the means which hav been
tl tne conuuaiiu ui iiir niienor impair
ment for the purpose of Indian instruction
have proved to be utterly inadequate.
The success of the schools which
are in operation in Hampton, Carlisle and
VnrrL Grove should not onlv encouraire a
more generous provision for the support of
tlur institutions, nut snouia promote the
establishment of others of similar character.
Thev are doubtlesa much more potent for
Rood tuan day acnooi upnu inc reservation,
as the pupils are alf ogcihpr separated from
the surroundings of savage life,
and are brought into constant
contact with civilization. There are
many other phases of this subject which
are of great interest, but which cannot be
included within becoming limits of this
communication. Thpy are disrumed ably
in the reports of the fcwretary of the Inte
rior and the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs. OS MOKUOKlklf.

EDUCATION.
Although our system of government
does not contemplate that a
nation should provide. or sup
port a svstem of education
of our people, no measures calculated to
promote the general intelligence and vlrtuo
upon which the prosperity 01 our nmiiiu'
tinns so irrentlv depends, have ever been ro
garded with iiulittcrcnce by Congress or tho
Executive. A large port of the public domain
has been from time to time devoted to the
nrnmntion of education. There is now
special reason why by setting apart the
proceeds ot its sales of public lands or by
some other course, the Government should
aid the work of educutlon. Many
who now exercise the right of
aiitrerncn nra unable to read the ballot
which they cast, who havo just emerged
from a condition of slavery, and who sud
denly devolved the responsibilities of citi

the report of the Commissioner
of Education, that ' there has lately
been a considerable increase ot in
terest and effort for their, instruction
but all that can be done by local legislation
and private generosity should be supple

tributed in different States, according to

those localities which are more in need of
such assistance will reap the special
benelits.
ON AGRICULTURE.

culturd exhibits the results of experiments

ON PENSIONS.
It appears from the report of the Com
missioner of Pensions that since 1800,
$789,000 original claims have been
filed; $150,949 of these have been allowed
and inscribed on the pension roll; $72,539
have been reiected and abandoned, beinc
thirteen per cent, of the whole number of
-niilA,l n'Vmva nnn tirtU. rtnrwlinfr
for settlement $305,575 original
pension claims, $227,010 of which were filed
prior to July 1st. 1880. These when al
lowed, will involve the payment of arrears
from the date of discharse. !in case of any
valid claim, and from the date of death or
termination of a prior richt in all other
cases. From all the data obtainable it
is estimated that 15 per cent, of the number
of claims now pending will be rejected or
abandoned. This would show a probable
rejection of 3,404 cases and the probable ad
mission of about 193,000 cases, all of which
involve the payment ot arrears or pen.
sion. With the present force em.
ployed, tho number of adjudications
remaining the same and no new business
intervening, this number of claims (193,000)
could be acted on in a period of six
years, and taking January 1, 1884, as a
near period from which to estimate in each
case an average amount of arrears,
it is found that every case allowed would
require for tlie first payment upon it the
sum of $2,300, multiplying this amount by
tlm whole number ot probable admissions
cives $250,000 as the sum required
for the first payment, this repre

eases where the claimant dying, there is no
nervnii who under the law, would he entitled

His iirnhahle amount to bo paid. In these
estimates no account has been taken of the
i.'..r0 tiled mice Juno 30, 1880, and now
pending which must receive attention as
current business, uui wmcu uura nut in
volve the payment of any arrears beyond
the date of the filing of the same. Of this
number It is estimated that eighty-six per
sons will bo allowed, as nas neen siaiea,
with the present force of the Pension
Bureau, 075 clerks. It is es
timated that it will take six years
to dispose of the claims now pending. It is
stated by tho Commissioner of Tensions
that by an addition of 250 clerks, increasing

be accomplished, so that these cases could
be acted upon Iwithin three years. Aside
from the consideration of justice which
may be urgedfor a speedy settlement of
the claims on the files of the Tension Otllce.
It is now less important on the score of
economy, inasmuch as luny one

cautions consideration to any similar pro

torn would effect a most radical change
In its theory and practice. The avowed
purpose of that system is to induce the ed
seated young men of the country to devote
their lives to public employment, by on as
surance that having once entered upon it
tuey.'necd never'lcavo it and that after! volun
tary retirement they shall be the recipients
of an annual pension. That this system as
an entirety has proved very successful in
Great Britain, and seems to be generally
conceded even by those who once opposed
its adoption. To a statute which should
incorporate all of its essential features I
should feel bound to give my approval,
but whether it would be for the best inter
ests of the public to fix upon it as on expe
dient for immediate and extensive applica
tion, which embraces certain features of the
English systems, but. excludes or ignores
others of equal importanoe, may be
seriously doubted even by those who are
impressed, as I am myself, with the grave
Importance of correcting the evils which
heroin present the mothods of appoint
ment. If. for example, the Knulisu rule
which shuts out persons above the age of
twenty-five years from a large number of
employments is not to De moue an
essential part of our own system, it is ques
tionable whether the attainment of the
highest number of marks at a competitive
examination should bo a criterion by
which all applications for appoint
ment should be put to test, and
under similar conditions it may also be a
question whether the admission to the
service should be strictly limited to its
lowest ranks. There arc very many char
acteristics which go to make amodcl
servant; prominent among thesa are
probity, industry, good sense, good habits,
good temper, patience, order, courtesy,
tact, self-reliance and manly deference to
superiar officers and manly consideration
for inferiors. The absence of those traits
is not supplied by wide knowledge- of
hooks or bv ' nromntitudo in 'answerinu
questions, or by any other quality likely to
De brought to light by a competitive exam
amination. To make a success in such a
contest, therefore, an indespensable condi
tion of public employment would very
likely result in the practical extension
of the older applicants, even though
they might possess ;qualitictions;far supe
rior to their younger and more bnTiant
competitors. These suggestions mu- not
be regarded as evidence of any spirit oi' op
position to the competitive plan
which has been to some ex
tent successfully employed ulready,
and which may hereafter vindicate the
claim of its most earnest supporters. Hut
it ought to be seriously considered whether
the application ot some educational stanaaru
to persons of mature years and to young
men fresh from school and college would
not likely result in more intellectual pro
ficiency above other qualities of equal or
sreatcr importance. Another feature of
the proposed system is the selec
tion, by promotion, of all
officers of the Government, above
lowest crades. except such as
would fairly be recarded as exponents of
the policy ot tlie executive ana tne princi
ples of the dominant party to aflbrd en
couraccmcnt to the faithful public servants
by exercising in their minds the hope of
promotion, n tney are iounu to
merit it, is " much to be desired,
ilut would it be wise to adopt a
rnie so risrid as to permit no other manner
of supplying the intermediate wants of the
service, mere are many persons wuo 1111
subordinate positions with great credit, but
lack those qualities which are so requisite
for the higher posts of duty, and because
the mode - of thought, and action
of one whose prcsenco in a gov
crmcntal bureau has been long continued
are often so cramped by routine procedure,
as almost to disqualify him from instituting
changes required by the public interests.
An infusion or new biooa iroiu tune to
time into tho middle ranks
of the service might be very
beneficial In its results, i he suhiect under
discusion is one of grave importance. The
evils which are complained of cannot be
eradicated st once; the work must be grad
ual. The present Kngllsh system is a
growth of years and was not crested
by a single stroae ot tne executive or oi
legislative action. Its beginnings are found
in an order in Council and at a time when
resort had been had to competitive exam
inations as an experiment mnch more ex
tensively than has yet been the case in
this country. A select committee
of the House of Commons made a report

The fact that a few of the twenty or thirty

Holocaust Near Pittsburg.
Pittsburo, Pa., December 10. News is
received of a terrible and shocking holocaust
which occurred at Clock Cut, seven miles
from this city, this morning about 3 o'clock,
by which sixteen men were surned to
death and a large number fatally injured.
Last eveninir a terrible explosion
occurred at Keystone Rolling Mills,
Fourteenth Ward, but this morning conies
another which exceeds in horror anything
which has occurred in this vicinity since
tho terrible destruction of life caascd bv
the collision at Twenty-Eighth Btreet. Be
tween 2 and 3 o'clock this morning a frame
boarding houss located '.on the line of the
1'ittsburg a liue trie luulroud some seven
miles' below the citv. was set on fire bv
the explosion af a lamp, and of fifty people
known to be sleuping only twenty-four es
caped alive. All were more or less burned,
so rapid was the progress of the flames.
oome were roastca to ocatn without tne
possibility of rescuing them.
The buildinir in which thefiro occurred
was owned by Martin & Joyce, contractors,
Dut was unaer tne management ot a Mr.
Kawn. as boardine-house keener. It was
about thirty feet wide and fiity long, and
constructed of sixteen-foot boards placed on
end. It had a hoard roof with
very stoop pitch and n loft formed by a
sloping roof, in which laborers were hud
dled for the night. In the lower story was
a dining-room, and in one end ol the build-1
ing was the kitchen. The stuirs
leading to the loft were located just
by tho .side ot the door leading from
dining-room to the kitchen. In the loft
bunks were arranged, but tho only light
which penetrated were from two openings
without glass, and which were closed at
ni ht with sliding doors so as to keep
out the chilly night air. In this
dark loft Bonie forty-three men
were soyiposed to have slept last night. At
least that number were at supper last even'
ing and none were known to be away when
the hour for retiring; came. Tlie
origin ot tho liro wasthe upsetting and
explosion of a kerosene oil lump. The
story, as tola by an eye witness ot the
fire, was substantially as follows:
Between 2 and 3 o'clock this morning Mr.
hawn. bourdine houso keener.' arose and
kindled a fire in tho kitchen stove. He left.
a lighted lamp on the table near the door
leading to tno ainpig room and went to
arouse his wife and servant Jgirls. While
no whs kuiiu- tne exoiosiou uucureii
and in an instant the dining room was filled
wiin names. Kawn succeeded in escaping
with his wife and girls, but could not do
more tnan can upon those uo-stairs to es
cape for their lives. In another moment
the names hud enveloped tbe stair
way, thus cuttuiE otf all means
ol escape for the doomed men above except
through a small opening at either end, and
I rum snuinir doors, which had to bo re
moved. The loft was filled with straw and
combustible material used in bedding, and
it was only those who were nearest to
the openmrs who could make their escape,
Forms In a semi-mule condition could be seen
strucirlinir in the stitlmu smoke. Twenty
three ot the occupants of the loft succeeded
in squeezing through tho openings, some
with their underclothes on 'fire. Others
rushed frantically about the room until the
smoke sullocated them and then voices,
were stilled in death. ihe survivors
groaned and writhed in pain and shivered
in the frosty air of early morning. They
were bsrno on as soon as possible, and word
was sent to other boarding-houses along the
line oi woric. aim pn vsicians were summoned
from their neighborhood and citv. Special
engines were sent down on the Pittsburg &
umo l-.ne lioad. but meanwhile the sluv
ennir victims were provided with such
clotlunir as could be obtained, ihe sen
oiisly injured were brought to tho depot
on the South Side and thence removed
to tho West Pennsylvania Hospital, while
those who were leas scriouv burnt were
removed to the hotel of Martin Joyce,
on Pennsylvania avenue the scenes
this morning at t!io a;to of Ihu lil-imed
building wero ofa sickcnine? character. In
a heap in one corner of the ruins were the
charred remains of six men who had evi
dently succumbed to tho fiery element
while endeavoring to escape through the
opening in tne rooi.
The Vienna Horror.
Lohpok, December 9. A special to. the
Standard from Vienna-says: it Is estimated
that the audieace in the theatre numbered
2,000. Many were trampled to death in the
panic which ensued as soon as the lire was
seen. There was an explosion of gas and
the audience was plunged into darkness,
r A later telegram from Vienna dated
this morning, says tbst 270 bodies have now
been recovered from the ruins of the King's
theatre. The fourth gallery has not
vet been explored. It is believed that not
a single person escaped from that gallery,
and tliat very few escaped from the third
frallcry. The corpse last received are
ittle more than charred frag
ments. Gross neglect is charged
against the management of tbe theatre.
The Isw prescribes tlie use of oil limni in
tbe corridors of the theatres so that the
exit shall be disoernable in
event of a faiinre of the gss.
bnt this precaution was utterly
ncelect Ai. Tlie person in t-harre of the cur
tain between tbe stage and auditorium ap-

Viissa, December 10. It is evident that
the tipper gallery must have fallen Into the
