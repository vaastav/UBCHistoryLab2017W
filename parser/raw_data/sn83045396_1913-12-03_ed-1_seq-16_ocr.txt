IWM UTAH MARBLE
USED 01 CAPITOL
Members of Rotary Club Pass
Resolutions to Present to
Commission.
STATE HAS MATERIALS
Utah Products Should Be
Utilized to Retain Money
at Home.
The adoption of a resolution urging the
capltol commission to use Utah marblo In
tlic construction of the state capltol was
the feature of last night's monthly din
ner of the Rotary club.
I The resolution was atrongly supported
by B. F. Redman, its author; IT. L. A.
I Ctilmer. S. 11. Ixwe and F. C. Richmond.
If who explained to the satisfaction of tho
ll club mombers that the apparent disparity
I In tho price asked for the Utah product,
as compared with foreign marblo. Is very
9 slight, nnd duo. in the main, to tho fact
I that the local bid covers much more ma1
I tcrlal than that of the outside marblo
I quarries- The resolution ndoptod follows.
I Whereas, The state of Utah has
within her borders practically ovury
metal and mineral necessary for the
happiness nnd welfare of civilized
man: and i
Whereas. The state Is now erecting
i n capltol Intended to be the pride of
every citizen: and
"Whereas, The main walls of said
t capltol arc to be of Utah granite, thus
keeping within our borders and for
? distribution anions our artlEans and
I busings men hundreds of thousands
of dollars: and
Whereas, Utah Is rich in marble, of
t; f.vory tint and hue, and of tho finest
; texture, and In every way suited to
) the Interior finishing and decoration
of such a building; and
j WhercaB, Tho use of Utah marble
I for thie purpose will enable tho peo-
pie of Utah to point to the splendid
resources of our state In the bull&lnfr
I line, and -will also h'vo back to our
citizens and taxpayers a large amount
of money that will otherwise go to
,' other communities; now, therefore,
bo It
Resolved, By tho Salt Lake Rotary
club, that we urge the capltol oom
t mission to use Utah marble and every
' other Utah material possible In tho
I erection of said capltol, and be It
', further
j Resolved. That these resolutions,
I duly signed by our president and soc-
retary. be sent to said capltol com-
. mission and a copy hereof to the
1 dally press.
I ROAD BOND ISSUE
NOT A CERTAINTY
County Commissioners Not SatiBficd
With Eeports and May Not
Authorize an Election.
A special meeting of the county com
missioners will be lield this monilnfr, at
which It is expected a decision will be
reachod In regard to a bond issuo for
road building purposcn. Advocates of the
bond issuo will be present to urge favor
ably action.
All necessary information on whloh to
base a decision Is now In the hands of
the county commissioners. The report of
R. H. Burrell. government road oxpert, in
which is outlined the plan for road Im
provements at a cost of $1,000,000, haH
been checked over by disinterested ex
perts, and these subsidiary reports havo
been filed with Uie commission.
That the bond Issuo will be made Is by
no means certain Members of tho county
' commission are somewhat pessimistic as
to tho sentiment throughout the county,
and they are not altogether satisfied with
tile report of the government expert. Tho
chief obstnele lies In tho fact that F. N.
Ifuddlcson, assistant city engineer, re
ported to the commissioners, after check
ing tho reports of the Kovernmcnt ex
pert, that the Improvements contem
plated would cost o00,0CKi more than Air.

I QUINTETTE SCORES
ANOTHER SUCCESS
One of the richest ofl'criugs of tho
current season was the concert by the
Salt Lake quintette at the First' Con
gregational church last night. A small
but wholly appreciative audience gath
ered for the eveut and these patrons
ucrn well repaid.
The programme was front llavdn.
Mendelssohn ami Beethoven. consisting
of a series of choice selections from
each. The Mendelssohn series, with
Sipiiro ('nop at the piano, Otto King

called for in view of the uniform ex
cellence that prevailed throughout. The
concert was the second of si series of

The similarity In the names of Chief of

MAP SHOWING RICH REGION TO BE ENCIRCLED BY OREGON SHORT LINE RAILROAD. J
' i
. -
St. Anthony ancl Idaho Falls
Mark Extremes of Bene
ficial Construction.
PLANS and tho rijjht-of-way map
for the new belt line which will
bo constructed by the Oregon
Short Line between Idaho Falls,
and St. Anthony, Idaho, were completed
yesterday by tho chief engineer's of
fice, and announcement was mado for
tho first time that tho company Is en
gaged in procuring tho rights of way
nnd that work on the line will be start
ed as soon as the weather pormits.
The bolt lino will bo eighty miles
in length nnd will cost at loasl $1.
oOO.OOO. The plan for constructing such
a lino to pierco the rich country north
and south of the Snalto river valley
centfr has been under consideration bv
the officials for some timo, but definite
arrangements were deferred until Rob
ert. S. Lovott, chairman of the Uuion
Pneifii; system, mado his rocent. western
rrip. Judge Lovctt, after going over
tho proposed plan, approved it.
Course of Line.
Announcement of the details of the
new line was mado by P. 31. Knicker
bocker, assistant general manager of
tho Oregon Short Lino. !Mx. ICnickcr
boclccr says that a right-of-way is now
boing 60Cured from Idaho Falls to the
first crossing to the south on the Snake
river. As soon as this and other por
tions of tho right-of-way aro secured
and the weather pormits, nctual con
strnction work will bo started.
Tho present lino from Idaho Falls to
St. Anthony is an almost straight cast
and west line, piercing tho contor of
tho valley. The now bolt lino will form
a loop, taking in both the northern
nnd southern portions of the valley.
Beginning at Idaho Falls, the lino will
take the present Yellowstone branch
route to Lincoln, where tho sugar fac
tory is located. At this point it will
turn south to Iona, where it is to again
turn east. Tt will then go in a general
eastern direction to a point a few milos
south of St. Anthony, where it will turn
north, going directly into that town.
Opens Good Region.
Leaving St. Anthony for tho north
ern swing the loop will follow tho north
fork of the Snake river on tho north
side of tho stream through Elgin, Fd
monns and Piano, crossing tho stream
a few miles cast of Lcwisville. Pass
ing through Grant it will turn south
nt Coltman and outer tho Yellowstone
branch at. Ucon nnd will then follow
the proscnt lino into Idaho Falls.
One of the nyist important things to
bo accomplished by the new lino will
bo tho opening up of tho ncli territo
ries north nnd "south of the Snake rivor
valley. Heretofore, on account of the
lone haul to tho Yellowstone branch,
theso localities havo not dovolopt-d rap
idly. Tho southern part o the branch
will pierce n rich dry farm country,
while tho north branch will paSa
through n most fertile irrigatod section.

liiEI CHARGE
Ell MEAT
S. W. McClure Declares At
titude of Fowler of Illi-
nois Inconsistent.
That tho action of Representative
Fowler of Illinois, according to press
reports, in condemning meat inspection
methods of tho United States and de
manding a congressional investigation
thereof, when not less tbau three months
ago tho representative voted to admit
moat from China, Japau, Asia and Afri
ca without any inspection whatever, is
insincere, is tho opinion of S. W. Mc
Clure, secretary ot the .National Wool
growers association. Mr. McCluro says
that meat conditions arc better in this
couutry than anywhere, aud points to
the $3,000,000 worth of meat and moat
food products condemned by federal
inspectors last year.
Air. McCluro says that he thinks it
strange that Congressman Kowler
"should be poisoned" each time he
eats meat from tho Chicago packing
houses,. The theory of tho representa
tive that poisonous preservatives arc
injected into meat is 'scouted by Mr.
McClure. 31c says that if this were
true, tho fluid would remain onlj- in
one placo nnd would not preserve" In
discussing moat packing conditions he
said:
Undor the meat inspection act of
the United States the uso of any
I injurious preservative is prohibited,
and the bureau of animal industry
has 2500 men engaged in inspecting
every pound of meat produced by
packers. In my opinion, the meat
produced by tho packing houses is
the eleauest and most healthful
possible.
A. littlo over a year ago a Wis
consin congressman made various
charges against tho packers, and
after a thorough investigation not
a single charge was sustained. The
so-called beef trust has been under
investigation for tho last fifteen
years, and about tho only result
has boon a little political prestigo
for various muck-rakers.

WALLACE APPROVES
PLANS OF WILSON
National Committeeman Fa
vors Presidential Nomina
tion by Primary.
National Committeeman TV. R. Wallace
strongly approves tho proposals of Presi
dent Wilson, as outlined In his message
to congress, for the nomination of presi
dential candidates by primary election
and for the changing of the composition
of tho national conventions.
In his message to congress President
Wilson urges tho passage of a law pro
viding for tho nomination of presidential
candidates by primary election, and he
makes tho suggestion that the party con
ventions bo retained, but only for the
purpose of ratifying tho nomination by
tho primary election and for formulating
the party platform. He further suggests
that tho national convention be com
posed of tho nominees for president, vice
president, senate and representative- and
of tho senators whose terms had not
yet expired and of the members of tho
national committee. He suggests this
composition of the convention with a
vlow to haviricr tho platforms made by
those responsible for carrying out the
pledges.
Mr. Wallace regards the suggestion as
lo the manner of nominating presiden
tial candidates as a recommendation for
legislation, but bolieves that tho sug
gestion as to tho composition of the con
ventions Is merely a suggestion as lo the
rules that may be followed by the partv.
organizations, lie said:
I regard both the suggestion ns to
the enactment of a law providing for
tho nomination of presidential candi
dates by primary election nnd the
recommendation as to the rule to be
followed by tho parties in the compo
sition of national conventions as ex-cellcnt.
