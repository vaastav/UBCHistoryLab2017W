IT IS FINISHED
All Points Susceptible ot Agreement
Settled Between the Joint
Peace Commissions,
BUT SPAIN IS SO YERY SORE
Over the Lob? of Her Colonies That She
May Finally Refuse to Sign the
Treaty France Too Feel
ing Bad.
Paris, Dec. 8. The treaty is finished
Judge Day said today: "We have set
tled all the points on which there Is any
possibility of agreement." Only en
grossing remains.
The Spaniards refused today to cece
to the United States a coaling station
in the Caroline islands. The Madrid pa
pers are disposed to revive the question
of the Maine and excite public opinion
against the United States on account of
the reference made to this in President
McKinley's message. They report that
Senor Montero Rios, president of the
Spanish commission, made an impas
sioned denunciation of President Mc-
Kinley at the last joint meeting of the
commissions. However, these reports
are practically without foundation.
Senor Rios referred to the Maine in
cident, but only in a calmly worded
sentence, expressing regret that the
president had spoken, as Spaniards
thought, unjustly of them. The Span
lards had already proposed this confer
ence to have the responsibility of! the
Maine reported upon by a Joint commis
sion of European powers. The Ameri
can commissioners refused to listen to
this and permitted Rios' reference to
the president's message to pass unchal
lenged, as discussion would have pro
voked bad blood.
The French government is reported
as resolved to take up the case ot the
French holders of Cuban bonds, and It
is believed that France will declare tht
the repudiation of the bonds is the re
sult of the treaty a victorious nation
,has imposed upon Spain. They argue
that, through the treaty, the responsi
bility has been shifted upon America,
and, therefore, the French government
will endeavor to exact some pledge for
payment or guarantee of the bonds.
The American peace commissioners
entered the joint conference today in a
nervous frame of mind, having reasons
to believe a possibility existed even at
this late hour, for a rupture, as the
Spanish commissioners do not conceal
the fact that, having failed to train all
important points, they were indifferent
as to whether the conference resulted in
signing a treaty by which Spain loses
all of her colonies.
Safe Safely Sacked.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 8. A special to
the Post-Dispatch from Arrowsmith, 111.,
says that the private hank of Taylor &

GENERAL STERNBERG TALKS.
He Wanted to Prepare His Department for
Emergencies, But Was Told the Policy
- - Was to Wait.
Washington, Dec. 8. The conduct of
the medical service of the army was
taken up today by the war investigating
commission and Surgeon General Stern
burg was rigidly questioned. He said
the medical department was equipped
only for an army of 25,000 men when
war broke out. From year to year the
estimates he had submitted were mate
rially reduced by congress. So soon as
there was a prospect of war he began
preparations, but when he suggested to
Secretary Alger the propriety of making
purchases for his service, "the policy
was to wait."
At one time there were 6S0 contract
surgeons employed, and he conceded it
was a mistake not to have appointed
more contract surgeons from those who
had had experience in the civil war. The
reinwntti) imrts were good, bad and
indifferent, but he recollected no in
stance of dismissal for incompetency.

BIG PENSION ROLLS
Senator Vest Says the Government
is Paying Out Now Annually
$141,000,000 in Pensions.
IT IS TIME TO CALL A HALT
Bulwer-Olayton Treaty with Great Britain
to Be Modified Allowing United
States to Operate in Isthmus
of Darien,
Washington, Dec. 8. At the opening
of today's session, the senate decided
that adjournment would be uptil Mon
day. It was also decided to give an
hour of today's session to consideration
of pension lulls.
Senator Vest, of Missouri, said: "I do
not want to be captiuus about this pen
sion business, and do not want to set
myself up us a reformer, but this pass
ing of a lot of pension bills simply by
reading titles when a quorum of the
senate is not present, has got to be
stopped. Recent events have obliterat
ed sectionalism, and we are united. We
can therefore come here and object to
this spoliation I use the word advis
edlywithout any fear of having our
motives Impugned or our words miscon
strued. We are paying out in round fig
ures, $141,000,000 anually in pensions. It
is our duty to find out why, 33 years
after the close of the civil war, pension
claims amount to so enormous a sum.
"I have been criticised by some of my
people because I have not taken a more
determined stand on this pension ques
tion. I want, however, to pay pensions
liberally, as I regard such payment as
a sacred duty; but I do object to pass
ing these bills without proper consider
ation and without the same restrictions
that are hedged about other measures."
.Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire,
as chairman of the pension committee,
agreed with. Senator Vest in tiis desire
to have the pension bills carefully con
sidered. He thought a quorum of the
senate ought to be in attendance when
the pension calendar was considered.
During consideration of the bills on
the pension calendar, Senator Caffery,
of Louisiana, introduced a resolution
declaring it to be the sense of the sen
ate that the "president enter into nego
tiations with the government of Great
Britain to abrogate or modify the Clay-ton-Bulwer
treaty in so far and to the
extent that the same may be deemed to
prevent the United States from owning,
constructing, controling or operating
any oceanic canal across the Isthmus of
Darien."
The president today sent to the senate
the nomination of Richmond P. Hobson
to be naval constructor.
Senator Vest introduced today a reso
lution providing for the appointment of
a joint commission to investigate the
charges of corruption in the conduct of
the war with Spain. The resolution
calls for the appointment of three sen
ators and five members of the house.
Senator Morgan, of Alabama, moved
to take up the Nicaraguan canal bill to
day. A motion to adjourn was made by
Senator Pettigrew, but the motion was
defeated. The bill was then taken up,
and afterward the senate adjourned on
motion of Senator Morgan.

the appropriations committee, the house

consider the urgent deficiency bill for
support of the military and naval estab
lishments during the six months begin
ning January 1, 1899.
The deficiency bill gave rise to a long
debate on the increase of the army and
mustering out of volunteers, a number
of Democrats insisting that the bill
would enable the president to retain the
volunteers in service after peace had
been declared. Messrs. Dockery and
Savers, the leading Democrats of the
appropriations committee, defended the
bill, and said it could not be so con
strued as to modify the volunteer law.
Mr. Kae, Democrat, of Arkansas, an
nounced his purpose to move for an
amendment specifically declaring the
bill should not have such effect. The
house finally passed the urgent deficien
cy bill.

SANTA FE COUNTY SUGAR BEETS.
Richest in Sugar Content and Higfiest in
Purity Thousands of Acres of Land in
Vicinity of Santa Fe Adapted to
Beet Culture.
E. F, Hobart, receiver of the laud of
fice in this city, is in receipt oithe fol
lowing letter from the agricultural col
lege: Mesiila Park, Dec. 3 The sample of
sugar beet submitted by you, our lab
oratory number 1013. analyzed as fol
lows: Per cent of sugar in juice, 20.u:f
purity, 83.7. This sample has the high
est sugar content of any that we have
analyzed this year. .
ARTHUR GROSS,
Vice Director.
The beets were raised on Mr. Hobart's
ranch in the Rio Grande valley, about
20 miles northwest of Santa Fe, and the
analysis reported is conclusive proof
that beets raised in Santa Fe county are
the richest in sugar content and the
highest in purity of any raised in the
entire country. There are thousands of
acres of land in the county surrounding
this city peculiarly adapted to sugar
beet culture, and the conditions are such
as to offer extraordinary inducements
for the erection of a factory and the
growing of beets on a large scale.
