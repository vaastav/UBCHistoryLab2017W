PAIIIS Doc. 10 , [ New York Herali
Cable Special to the BKI : . ' ] The long lookee
for und talked about light between Jen
Hmith and .Take Kllrain came off to-day 01
the river Seine ; , close to Paris. The mos
representative company of sportsmen seei
In many years at a prize fight attended , am
ns almost nil were enthusiastic admirers o
Smith , they are surprised at tin
result , which , after 100 rounds
was declared to b'e a draw , durkncs
bringing the fight to a close. The genera
opinion seemed to be that Kilrnln had tin
best of It , unit Referee Atkinson , whom
saw to-night , said unreservedly that tin
lighting was almost all the time by Kilruii
In Smith's corner.
A mysterious crowd had gathered at Ander
ton's hotel on Sunday evening and all wcr
deeply excited. They came to attend th
light , where they knew not. Presently tw <
four-wheeled cabs drew up and sllcntl ,
they entered and were carried to Victor !
station. Silently and swiftly the trail
sped out from the station and stopped a
London Hrldgc , where another small cor
tlngcnt of mysterious sportsmen were em
barked , thence on to New Haven. It was
cold , bleak night. The party briskly boardc
the Normandy. A heavy sea made matter
uncomfortable for the men , among whoi
were Jack Harper and .Tnc
Hnldock , Smith's seconds. Outsid
Dieppe the boat was detained
tossing about until the Sister steamed ou
further , adding to the discomfort of the pa ;
sage. A light meal was taken nn luiulin
and n move was made to the waiting trait
Then for the first time it leaked out that th
party was bound for Houcn and the excite
ment rose rapidly and reached fever pitch
the train drew up at the gate of pieturcsqu
Rouen.
A snow-storm , however , caused unothc
delay. Kilrain and Smith each held a kin
of levee jm board the boat. The former we
seated near the funnel , quiet an
grave , with u keen look I
his eye. "Poney" Moore moun
cd constant guard over America
champion and Charley Howell stood in faitl
fill attendance. The first to return was Mi
Krncst Wells , and It transpired that the tint
gentlemen who had coino especially froi
America to see the fight hud missed the trui
to lloucn.
The weather improved and spirits rosi
Another move and the party again embarkei
this time on board of the broad rivt
steamers. They were bound for the scene (
the ring , which , suffice it to say , was , rough !
speaking , fifty miles from Par
and near a picturesque litt
town. Jem Smith , still further nft , he ]
smiling converse with his manager un
friends and the while chewed nonchalant ]
the ever-present toothpick. Both gladiatoi
were carefully wrapped In rugs and coa
and from what could bo seen hot
appeared in the pink of conditioi
Smith looked beaming , whereas Kllruiu hi ;
a somewhat anxious demeanor , apparent :
feeling the responsibility of the situatic
moro keenly than his adversary. The she
reached , Dick Roberts and the Smith broti
ers went on shore ahead of tl
rest , with the inevitable pair of bectli
of monster mallets to luimnn
the stakes into the ground. They did the
work in a business-like style nnU soon all wi
ready. Johnny Gideon , the veteran , state
that ho never saw a fight so splendidly ma
aged as the present one. The mot d'ord
was given und the main party trooped dev
the gang plank.
While the finishing touches were being p
to the roiied arena and scats were bell
.brought for the seconds , with other nccessu
furnishing , a qualm of fear passed thrmij
the breasts of not u few of the spcctatoi
who observed u figure that looked like
gendarme in genevevo do brabaui
Ho carried something that she
in the brilliant afternoon sun litho
the accoutrement of the Fren
military police. It was presently discover
that ho was accompanied by a hound of mo
or less noble breed , that ho was a comm
Gaelic sportsman diligently engaged in shoe
Ing Just nothing at all. Two mounted c
sen-ers , who subsequently ambled along
the opposite side of the river , turned out
be civilians with no taste for the line art
prize fighting and a number of the horses g
loping about in the further distance pan
to bo a lot of thoroughbreds and not by a
means u company of chasseurs prepare * !
make a descent on the ropes and stakes.
To anticipate somewhat the comlmtur
were not without n compliment of Fren
spectators. The crew of a steamer , frc
skipper to Mocker , took nn interest in t
bruising , and towards the finish of the coi
bat a group of landed gentry , with several
French la bora , drew near the ring sii
Several young ladles from a neighboring el
tcau came ns far as the gates , but not bei
enamored of what they beheld from tli
point of view left.
Smith was the firs-l to cast in his cast
amid cheers. Kilrain followed his'act , bell
greeted in tne usual way. Mr. George i
liinson w'as the referee.
There was some spirited betting to hit-
amounts. Thy wagering opened at 2 to 1
Smith , the first bet recorded being i'-UH ) h
by Jem Smith against 200 put up
Harding , Mr. Fox's representative , on 1
half of Kilrain. There were one or ti
other transactions over this figure. Karw
Wells , the head of the Pelican club , kept t
fun going by throwing a largo laying co
mission on the market In favor of Smith.
No tlmo was lost in peeling and when t
belligerents appeared in buff the superb cc
dltion of each man excited general udniii
. .tion. Smith fought In white trunks
breeches and green socks , and Kilrain in s
bio continuations and brown socks , T
minute narrative , round by round , will s :
isfy our readers who desire full partlcul.i
of one of the most extraordinary battles \ \ \ t
records of the ring.
Jt may , bo stated here that Kilrain never
his life 'before fought a knuckle light , n
never saw one. All his previous work li
been with.glovcs. Ho surprised evcryboc
including his warmest admirers , and possil
himself , Smith was unable to get hi 1
be ! . ' ? punches , with one to follow from i
other hand , st > effective wus Kllraln's pan
Ing. ( n fact , BO good was Kilrain that
made another kind of a tighter of Smith fn
what Smith was when ho fought GrecnJic
liUraln's defense was for the greater \ .
invulnerable and he carried the war Into the
enemy's territory "with a vengeance. For
the most part he fought Smith up into the
lattcr's own corner and grassed him there.
Indeed , the occurrence of anything contrary
to the rule was so rare that it never failed to
excite enthusiastic cheers on the part ol
Smith's adversaries. To Kllraln's long
reach with his wonderful left there
was added a capacity to wrestle
which no doubt went far to secure
the American the success he achieved. The
majority of the rounds were disappointing ! )
monotonous. l xclmngcsvcrc followed bj
hugs and throws , with Smith mostly under
most , and now and then a characteristic
lunch from one or the other wa1
ivlmt It amounted to. Twice Kllralt
knocked Smith clean off his pins
There was other knock-down blows of i
k'lnd , but these were tcrlfic. There was m
orrcspondlng performance on the part o
Smith to chronicle. Kilrain's wrestling , nl
hough he Is only nn elementary wrestler
s too much for Smith , who is but n pee
iiand , ns ; . It lowered the conclusion o
he great fight for endurance , for it was cor
Lulu that the score was all one way execp
'or about three rounds , when Smith cann
iigain wonderfully and raised the hopes o
is ! friends. At length darkness put an cm
o a fight that had lasted tw <
lours and a half the longest , hardcs
battle ever fought by two heavy men. Thi
not the only case of a fight having bcci
stopped by darkness. There was that o
Madden and Jack Grunt , who fought a cock
, ng for five hours and three-quarters. Tht'i
lowovcr , were middleweight men.
TUB KIOHT IX IICTAII. .
Smith won the toss and naturally chose th
best corner , with his back toward the sui
which was shining brightly. Both men looke
.n the pink of condition. Seven to two o
Smith was freely offered und several bet
ivcre made at that price.
When the men walked out from their coi
ncrs und had shaken hands they found tin
the corks had not been taken off their shoe ;
This having been done the fight began.
First Round Both played continuously t
the sturi , until Smith got his left homo o
the cheek und Just missed a counter. NCJ
time Smith went for the heud with his lef
and only Just missed n hot right-hander froi
Kilrnln , but was caught on the ribs with Kl
rain's left before he e-ompletely recovcrc
himself. Smith let go his left , and followe
it by the right , but no harm had been doii' '
when both closed and fell , Smith unde
Time 35 seconds.
Second Round As Kilrain sat in his co
ncr his face were a smile , while Smit
grinned as if he was quite satisfied with h

leading at Kilrain's chin und stopped h

good exhibition of wrestling , but when hot
fell Smith wus again under. Time 21 se
onds.
Fifth and Sixth Rounds Although tl
previous rounds had nil boc
short , the grounds had , by HOT
been so worn , especially in. Smith's conic
that it was evident that most of the woi
was being done on n piece of ground not
third of the twenty-four feet. Kilrain ke
to the right of the ring and Smith to tl
left. To anticipate the close , at the end
the two hours and thirty-ono minutes
lighting there was hardly a foot mark on on
half the ring. From thistimo both men free
used rosin for their hands. As soon as the
had reached striking distance both led a litt
short. Smith , who throughout kept his le
higher than Kilrain , kept his right wt
across the body. Kllruln begun by gettii
homo on the ribs , when each scored two i
three times on the body before they begi
hugging. Smith fell first and laughi
heartily as ho was carried to his corner.
this time four to one was laid on Smith.

at first in the ribs with both bunds , but i :

Kighteonth round So far Kllrain had h
all the best of the lighting and no raoro ofTi
wcio heard to lay odds on Smith. But d
spitt- the hitter's jiro.it punUhineia bo ca.1

Nineteenth Round Kllruln followed i
hlj advantage Vy forcing the Ugli Unp , but

ullvc , and , trde' ! 'e ' ICUr.thrb .left , faiily bt
him In a wrestle , and , springing to his feet ,
wulked to his corner. Time 12 seconds.

second Rounds Nothing was done but light
work , alt the rounds ending by both falling ,

let go his left and reached Kilrain's nose , but

blow which brought n nasty fall for both , as
hey rolled over and over tightly hugging
uch other around the neck. Time SO sec
onds.
Twenty-eighth to Thirty-third Round-
Light spurring and falls ; uo damage.
Thirty-fourth Round By this round it was
evident , barring accidents , that the first bat-
: lo between the heavy weights might bo a
eng ono , as each stood heavy hitting wqll ,
und it was simply marvelous to see the way
u which the fighters' legs stood under them.
Smith begun the hitting , but not much was

Ing , and both fell together , each appearing
stronger than ho hud been. Time 3' ' .
seconds.

was very much puffed , and Smith's loft cai
was ns big as a banana. Before a blow was
struck they clinched and fell. Timei 2 (
seconds.
Smith appeared to get stronger , and gavt
his backers fresh hopes. They looked hup
pier , thinking the turning point hud como a
last.
Thirty-seventh to Fortieth Rounds Thcsi
were very dull and made the spectator !
standing around the ring very weary.

the fresher of the two and when they fcl
after a struggle Smith was doubled unde :
Kilrain's shoulder. Time ! ! 0 seconds.

and actually forced him down in 5 seconds.

'Ono more. "
Ono Hundred and Sixth und Lust Round-
When they came up for the ono hundred un
sixth and last round , Smith seemed to n
vivo marvelously , and was very quick on h
legs and as sharp with his hands us a fcathc :
weight Just starting for an exhibition.
Then the referee stopped the fight. It 01

LICUS'SINO 1I.UI.UOAI > CONDUCTOKS.
The railroad conductors intend to pus
with great vigor the proposition they Inn
laid before the senate , through Mr. Butle
for the railroad conductors' license la\
Calvin S. Whcaton , who is grand chief coi
ductor , is hero to represent the order , i
which there arc 13,000 conductors. The hi
provides for a board of examiners under tl
treasury department to test the cupabilltii
of men who arc to enter the service as ral
road conductors. Mr. Whcaton , speaking i
the measure , said : "There uro many conclu
tors running trains to-day who are mil
to occupy their position , and if the
were examined by the board proposed In 01
bill they would bo relieved from the gru\
rcsK | > nsibIlity resting upon them. I n :
amazed that the government has not take
charge of this mutter long ago. Stcumbo ;
captains and pilots are required to be men i
ability and proficiency , but u railroad coi
ductors , with just as much rcsponsiblllt' '
may bo an ignorant , reckless and incapab
fellow. The' railroad companies general !
opiKiso the bill because they believe it is
scheme of the conductors to get higher wugo
Of course , that will be the effect of it , ns
will bring into the service u better cluss (
men , but the roaus which do u good busine :
and uro not operated for speculation pu
poses will give the bill their support.

WASHINGTON , Dec. 19. [ Special Telegram
to the Hr.K. ] A lively littlu spat took plnco
on the lloor of the senate this itftornoon over
the adoption of 11 resolution offered by Scn
ill or Cull providing for the print Ing in the
Congressional Record of tlio petition for the
admission of Utiih , together with the accom
panying papers. Seniitor Paddock promptly
objected. Mr. Call snld thitt ho could not
conceive of liny reason why .200,000 American
citizens should not bo heiml through the
Record ns to what they wanted , whatever
It might be. Senator Paddock mild :
"I iiitcrimscd nn objection to printing
this petition in the Record because I
tun distrustful of anything that comes
from the Mormon church , from
which this document cmlnates , therefore I
always require n little time for examination. '
investigation and reflection as to such
tcrs before I determine my duty in reaped to
it. If the senator from Florida is willing to
let the resolution lie upon the table for con
sideration tilt to-morrow , I may then with
draw all objection to the printing of the peif
titlon in the Record. "
Senator Call replied that he would agree ,
but ho saw no reason why an American citU
/.en should not bo heard , to which Mr. Pad
dock responded : "That Is precisely tha
matter. The question Is one of the American
cltlrcnshlp of the people , from whom I hi 8
petition comes. " i
The resolution then went over under the
rules. There will bo a heavy fight thia1
winter over various projects to divide , subJ
tract from mid wipe out several of oun
western territories. The ball has alrcudtf
been set in motion by Senator Tin-pie's omni
bus bill to admit Washington , Montana , Dn
kotu and Nevada "und for other purposes.1'
Inspection of the bill shows that the "other ;
purposes" comprise the wedding of the foutt
north counties of Idaho \Vushingtonf
which Is the old schema engineered through ;
the last session by Dan Voorhees at the in >
stance of his son Charles , of Washington !
territory. Charles still hopes to climb to of
seat in the senate by the 5,000 votes ?
which ho expects northern Idaho would
add to Washington. Ho will introduce a bil $
of similar import in the house Immediately ,
alter the holidays. It seems that Dolcgato
Voorhees has risked the admission" hia
territory on the destruction of Idaho , and thrf
chances are that , for this reason , ho will of *
fectuully defeat Washington's hopes of be
coming a state during the present congress ; '
Senator Stewart , of Nevada , will push hartt
to have southern Idaho added to Nevada , and
will Join hands with Voorhees and his Wash
ington territory scheme in an offensive and de
fensive. alliance looking to that end. Dele
gate .Too Toole , of Montana , has announced
his intention of rointroducmg hia
bill adding the Conor D'Alcno ' jrortion of
Idaho to Montana. Delegate Dubolse , of
Idaho , not to bo caught napping , has instl *
luted reprisals. At his instance Senatoa
Cullom has introduced n bill , drafted b #
Duboise , addingMlsgoulu and Heaver Head
counties of 'Montana to Idaho , and the dele
gate will introduce a bill to this effect In thai
house as soon as the committees are ap- '
iwinted. Duboise is working hard to create
sentiment against the division of Idaho : '
and is making friends by the score. ;
