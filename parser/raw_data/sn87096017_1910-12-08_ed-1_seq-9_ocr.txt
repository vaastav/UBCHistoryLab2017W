Peet -Of 8now Reported Prom Ken
tucky and Twelve Inches From Sec
tions of Ohio.
New York, Dec. 7.—A blizzard which
originated
in
the Tennessee mountains
and traveled eastward swept the At
lantic seaboard. The storm centered
-over the lower Chesapeake bay and
Tain,
snow or sleet tell over the en
tire country from Virginia northeast
and through the New England states.
A high northeaster roused the At
lantic ocean and four ocean steam
ships, which crept Into port,' had to
anchor In the lower bay because of '•the
blinding snow. Shipping was held in
port,
The first touch of the storm came
with a gentle fall of snow which, after
an abatement of several hours, 'took
on new life when a twenty-four-mile
wind came out of the northeast. The
driving gale shook down blankets ol
snow and brought low temperatures
with it.
Canton, N. Y., reported a tempera
ture of 12 degrees below zero, .the low
est recorded on the weather bureau
chart
The snow delayed traffic in New
York ana there was general suffering
among the poor, 678 persons being
cared for at the municipal lodging
house.
The weather bureau said it would
clear by night and be followed by ex*
treme cold.

Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 7.—The first
snowfall of the season was general
throughout the Central South. In
Memphis the fall was light, eventually
giving away to a mixture of sleet and
rain, with the temperature almost sta
tionary about thO~ freezing point May

report trains delayed.
LITTLE HOPE OF ENACTMENT
Measures Recommended to Congress
by the President.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Congress gave
respectful attention to President Taft's
message, but there were comparative
ly few members who were willing to
concede the probability of favorable
action, at the present session on many
of the recommendations contained
therein.
The general ^pinion was that time
would not permit of action in view of
the fact that the session will close
March 4.
Prior to the cabinet meeting Presi
dent Taft deVoted an hour to seeing
congressional callers.
Probably his most interesting vis
itor was Representative-elect Caleb
Powers of Kentucky, who was con
victed three times of complicity in
the Goebel murder case. Mr. Powers
was introduced to the president toy
Senator Bradley, who declared that
the new member of congress had been
vindicated by the heaviest vote ever
given a congressman in his district
President Taft will devote most of
the remainder of this week to con
ferences with senators, representa
tives and men of prominence regard
ing the Judicial appointments which
he Is expected to send to the senate
next week.
MAKES MANY NOMINATIONS
President 8ends Large Number of* Ap
pointments to Senate.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Among several
hundred nominations sent to the sen
ate by the president were those of
John W. Garrett of Maryland to be
United States minister to Venezuela
and Charles S. Wilson of Maine to be
secretary of embassy at Rome, Italy.
The nomination of Frederick W.

BUICK
TO THE FRONT
But in the meantime they were net idle, jtrogress was being made, new 1911 models of the latest
unproved mn&rnctum thruout were being buik veady for the 1911 season.
Tftg fWWHt Company ^is NOT doing what practically all the other popular priced manufacturers
are trying to carry out, that is, change the color af thejtamt, or some other minor detail, and continue
the same models if or:l911that they used far 1910. Aniuihatis more they started out with the idea that
they womlahe table toMnload all of these at the same rild 1910 price, but before getting very far they
found the* Ste suppoeed guillible public were getting wise to this fact then in order to successfully get
away with She ipropmihon, they found it necessary to reduce the 1910 selling price, which was done
forthmO. XxfageuMopments seemedto indkmte thtathis would not solve the problem. Consequently
tt is hard tateBcwhatiihe next move wtM be.
I^iJ^tthematter in anut~sheU is, that the majority of the populu. orbed Companies must
neceesa/3yjdo danngZ9U, just what the BUICK Company did in 1910, that is, make a general cleanup
?\odelConsequently, the BUICK Cars for 1911 are just one year ahead of
the outensf^tarthmrime^hmes wtU be brand new modds, having the latest of everything attached, and
not a coatvwftfion of:tke old 1910 machines, mdhich me now being sold by competitive manufacturers
under the gaue of new,models by simply makisfg a change.in the paint, or something equally ridiculous.
iafife if /for granted that the automobSk buytmg^public are more than "seven" and when they
buy a 1911 model—*i real 1911 modelthey expect to receive, and if these manufacturers think they can
put somethmg^aver^ they wdl be sadly mistaken.
BUCK «ars for Wll will show the result of the greatest effort on the part of the best trained
engineers,m Amsenca today, to turn out new 1BU models that .will be the equal of machines costing sev
eral tunes as nmch,iatt att popular prices.
Fmrthermare, we have been in the business a sufficient length of
ttime to thoroughly understand that we dare not make these asser
tions unless we have the goods to back them up.
Another thing, the story has gone broad cast that Sears-Roebuck
& Coe are selling
simply say that this report is a lie out of the whole cloth.
Sears-Roebuck & Co, have never sold nor had for sale any
BUICK
Cars and furthermore we will pay
to any person who can prove to the contrary.
*off he«vaUable with™ th*
M911 BUICK Line before making your selectwn. We will have something to show you that will be worth
matting,to see we have never misled you and wUl not this time.
To The Dealers in the Country
wan* sajfto Jos, don't take any stock in the malicious stories that are
being circulated broadcaat concerning tha BUICK Company, for this Company la
now In batter shape financially and In every other way than ever before, and there
Is abaolutaly no truth In any reports to the contrary. Competition Is trying hard to
discredit the BUICK Company and tha BUICK Car for thay well knew they will have
hard sledding to aell their machlnaa whan the really new
their appearance on the market* We simply want to say to you, PIN YOUR FAITH
TO THE BUICK CAR, and you will be the big winner In your locellty, for the BUICK
Company and the PENCE AUTOMOBILE CO. are too energetic to ba followers or
In other words bring up the reer. They are only satisfied with one poeltlen, THAT
IS IN FRONT, so don't doss up on eny automobile agency for
