Upon the first stroke of the hour of 0
there was ft mighty convulsion throughout
tho framo of Athqno, tho hypnotic kleepcr;
at the second he mado as If to leap from
tho rostrum, and at tho third he struggled
no violently with the four strong men who
sought to restrain him as to hurl one of
them from the stage and send another
spinning Into a corner.
When ho went to sleep six days ago It
was with tho understanding that he was to
he awakened Saturay night by the gong of
a clock souudlng tbu hour of 9. Thcro wan
Bomethlii(? rather theatrical about it. Prob
ably not one of tho 300 persons who crowded
Scblitz' roof garden last night but wondered
why bo couldn't have been wakened by a
good sound shako quite as well. Never
theless the situation was eerie and ghastly
enough to suit tho most morbid. The scene
suggested the "gigantic clock of ebony" re
ferred to by I'oo In his "Mnsquo of tho Hod
Death."
Its pendulum swung to and fro with n
dull, heavy, monotonous claim, and when
the minute hand had mndo the circuit of
the face and the hour wns to be stricken
thero corno from the hrnzen lungs of tho
clock a sound which was clenr and loud
nnd deep nnd exceedingly musical, but of
k peculiar a note nnd emph'isls Unit
the giddiest grew pule mid the moro aged
nnd sedate pusscd Ihelr hands over their
brows as If tn confused reverie or medi
tation. The paroxysm passed In a moment, leav

Hnfey Hounds the Word.
P. C. Heafjr tho undertaker, presided at
tho resurrection, enacting tho paradoxical
role of the Angel Gabriel. In lieu of a
trumpet he used a cathedral chime clock,
nnd Instead of a Judgment there awaited
the sleeper n glass of hot milk and some
cheeso wafers. It was thought at ona tlmo
that an enraged wife, supported by a posse
of officers from Kansas City, would bo there
to blast him with her accusations as soon
as he camo out of the trance, but this ar
rangement was declared off about an hour
beforo tho awakening, and a horrible sus
picion Is now lurking In the minds of the
Omaha pollco that this was nil a press
agent scheme.
"Were tho police and the newspapors of
both Kansas City and Omaha duped by
this trick?" they arc asking themselves,
"Is tho wife In Kansas City n myth, the
desertion a snore, tho warrant for Atheno's
arrest a delusion? Was It all a clever
rusii to give tho affair the dignity of a
legal status, to ndd a complication and an
clement of Intrigue so seductive to tho
repertorlal pencil? Have the police de
partments of two cities been tised to boost
the graft of a band of traveling mounte
banks? Is It thus that thu reluctant press
notice Is lured from Its lair?"
To tho man on the outsldo It looks as It
most of tho foregoing questions tau be
answered In tho affirmative. In any event
the lrato wlfo from tho city by tho Kaw
melted away opportunely and the sleeper,!
awoke In tho arms of his mother, a gentle,
sweet-faced woman, who appeared upon tho
scene from her home tn Kansas a few
hours before the resurrection.
Mnlter of PreexliiK.
Aftor tho struggle In which Atheno
hurled his attendants so promiscuously
about tho stago It was announced by
Oabrlel Hcafy that the late sleeper would
rnako a speech.
"My brothers tell me," said Atheno, In a
weak voice, "that I was dug up throo days
ngo at tho Instance of n woman's club,
whose members feared I would freczo down
thcro In tho ground. That was a great
mistake. Those same women put their
houso plants down In tho cellar to keep
them from freezing during tho winter; how
much safer, then, wns I under six feet of
ground, entirely shut off from tho open
air? Ily digging mo up the uniformity of
tho temperature waH broken and l( has
made mo weak and nervous." Tho speech
closed with tho usual thanks for patronage.
Within twenty minutes Atheno had re
gained his normal spirits and was talking
and laughing with tho crowd.
The Atheno (or Mc.Manlglo) family will
stay at tho Schlltz hotel until arrange
ments are made for another exhibition In
another city. They declare themselves well
pleased with their Omaha engagement from
a flnanclul ntandpolnt.

tiailKs has referrpil tn
him of Decmber 1, with u copy of u letter
from n hid of Fremont. Neb., suggi Sting
1-cent subscriptions from the school chil
dren of the United States. Had It not been
for my absence from the city, attending u
meeting of tho trustees of this association
In usiilngton, this letter would Jmve hnd
nn earlier acknowledgment.
While the suggestion made by Muster
hdwnrds Is nn excellent one, It Is verv
difficult to carry out nnd the contribution
of 1 cent Is not much of a sacrifice tor tho
purpose such us the erection of a tomb
at tho grave of our late president. Of
course, tiie contribution of 1 cent would
bo a liberal offering from children of poor
parentage nnd would be ns gladly nrcepted
ns II from rhlldren of wenltliv people.
Ncvcrthclcrs. the expensu Involved In bring
ing about organization of the school chil
dren among 75.noo,(0) of people Is such that
the result would not probably warrant tho
expense. A 5-cent subscription hns been
started In several of the states and even
that Is burdensome to handle. A better
LUggcstlon hns been made by Mrs, Huch
anan of Washington to President noose-,
velt. It is that each class In tho several
schools throughout the entire country nnko
Its contribution In such n wny thnt credit
will be given the class and no distinction
be made.
Superintendent Jones of this cltv has
adopted n pinn which Is very good, tnnt of
giving to each boy nnd girl nn envelope
upon which they were to write their name
and nddress and enclose tholr contribution,
whether 1 cent or Jl. This method avoids
the humiliation of thfi poorer children nnd
makes the contribution very expressive of
the Interest of the school children.
Tho reports submitted to the trustees
from nil sections of the country were In
deed very gratifying. Your Interest In this
work In your city nnd state Is highly ap
preciated, Wo nre doing our best tn nsslst
tho work of tho several local nnd state
auxiliary committees throughout the coun
try, ancf If I can be of nny service to you
do not hesitate to call upon me. Respect

The Nebraska association Is to plan an

In a short tlmo. As soon ns the mt-mbers
of tho executive committee can be brought
together a plan to cover tho entlro stato
will bo adopted. Illank forms of subscrip
tion aro bolug sent to all newspapers In

these will probably bo followed up by direct
appeals by the stato association.
At the organization of the society nn ad

state signed by the officors, as follows:
To the Peoplo of Nebrnsku: The McKln

ized after tho untimely death of the na

Myron T. Derrick, the secretnry Is Ityerson
llltchle, all of Cleveland, O. Tho under
signed havo been appointed as tho No
brnska brunch of tho association. Tho ob
ject Is to raise a fund for tho erection at
'Cnnton, O.. of a fitting monument over tho
grave of William McKlnley, and nfter an
appropriation of n proper amount for such
purpose for tho erection of a sultnblo
memorial nt tho nntlonnl capital, Tho con
tribution should bo the people's offering to
tho noble dead nnd should be n populnr
tribute. The stato association, having this
object in vlow, Hiiggests tho following ns
the course to be pursued In Nebraska:
While not attempting to llx Urn maximum
nf contributions the committee suggests
that $25 from any Indlvdiuil citizen Is sulll
clent nnd thnt no contribution need ha con
sidered too small to be bestowed.
Wo nsk thnt every newspaper In tho state
shall publish this appeal and supplement
tho action of the association with tho power
of the press. We further ask that every
editor, teacher and postmaster In Nebraska
shall act as the agent of the association tn
receive contributions nnd forwnrd tho snmo
to Hon. Kdwurd Hosewuter, treasurer,
Omaha, Neb., who will ncknowledgo tho
same. To theso contributions hlnnks will
bo sent by thu secretary Tho name of
every contributor will tic enrolled upon the
record of tho nntlonnl association und tho
receipt of tho sum acknowledged. There
are. about aiO.iXO school children In tho state
of Nebraska, nnd we appeal to each teacher
In tho state to aim to collect 3 or 10 cents
from each child as the tribute of tho youth
of the state, showing their vffectlon for tho
lamented chief executive, who stands today
us nn Ideal American.

It was a Nebraska boy, Jsmet Albrr'
Sherman Edwurds of Fremont, who was
the first to suggest a plnn to bring nv.ry
child attending the schools In the I tilled
States Into clne toueh with the effort U
raise a monument to the memory of the
late President McKlnley.
Master Edward", who attends the Fre
mont public schools, upon rending the an
nouncement of the formation of a Nebraski
McKlnley Memorial society, wrote to E
Itoscwator. secretary and treasurer, n let
ter, In which he outlines a plan by which
ench child could contribute n small amount,
which In tho aggregate would be consid
erable, In tho construction of tho monu
ment which Is to stnnd In the towu wh re
the chief executive passed the greater
part of bis life,
In this letter Master Edwards said: "I
have read In The Sunday Dee of the or
ganization of n McKlnley Memorial associa
tion and thnt subscriptions will be re
ceived for the purpose of carrying out the
object of the association. 1 nm a pupil
in the public school 'of Fremont nnd am
Interested In tho matter. As a means of
raising a fund I suggest that a fund bo
started which will he composed of 1 cent
from each of the pupils In the schools of
the state. It this fund Is started I would
like to have It opened at Fremont, so I
could contribute the first cent."

When Mr. llosewater received this letter
he forwarded It to Ityerson llltchle, sec
