been completed, was as follows:

Debbs, socialist. 44$, 471; Chaftn, pro
hibition. 214,252: Hlsgen, indepen
dence league, 83.1S6; Watson, popu
list. 33,871, The total vote was 14.
^10,638, or 1.299,930 more than v\a
cast in the election of 1904. In the
??lection of 1904 Mr. Roosevelt re
ceived 7.623,486. Parker. 5.077,971;
Debbs. socialist, 402.283; Swallow,
prohibition, 258,536: Watson, popu
list. 117,183: Corigan. socialist labor.
31,249.
Taft's pluralty is 1,264,494 while
that of Roosevelt four years ago was
2,34"), 513.
Roosevelt's plurality was 1,128,12!
greater than that of Taft, notwitli
standing there was 1,209,930 vote*
more east In the electlou four year;;
ago. This can be credited either to
the greater popularity of Roosevelt
over Taft or of Bryan over Parker
Either way it appears that nearly all
the added number to the total vot<
went to Mr. Bryan rather than to
Mr. Taft.

BIRCHTALK8 OF
BONANZA MINE
In a recent interview with the Se
attle Times Steve Birch says:
"The whole mineral country drain
ed by the Chltina and Copper rivers
looks to me more promising than
ever before. Marty mines are being
Jevcloped In anticipation of the com
pletion of the railroad and of tho
opening of traffic by rail and steam
boat lines next year and of which
the outside world knows little. In
addition a great deal of development
work Is being done on Prince William
sound. It will only be a few years
until that whole section of Alaska
will contribute enormously to the
world's wealth in gold and copper."
"At the Bonanza mines we have
completed a tramway and many of
the buildings and will be prepared
by August 1st next, possibly before
to deliver ore in large quantities to
the railroad and steamboat lines.
The main line of the Copper River A:
Northwestern, a standard guage,
heavily ballasted road, is practical!}
completed to the beginning of navi
gation on the Copper river above the
rapids in Abercrombie Canyon. The
amount of work done this summer
and tall has been phenomlual.
"At Cordova a sampling works will
be established in the near future for
the benefit of the mine owners in
the Prince William sound country
whose development has not progress
ed far enough to permit of large indi
vidual shipments of ore. By the
means of the sampling works these
mine owners will be enabled to dis
pose of their ores at Cordova where
they will be shipped to the Tacoma
smelter, thus materially forwarding
the development of th&t portion of
Alaska." y KL'flt

Martin Itjen has begun the tearing
down of the old iron building once
an important figure in the life of
Skagway, as the Hotel Astoria, lo
cated on Sixth street cast of Broad
way. Mr. Itjen bought the building
some tine ago from the Moore Town
site company, through its represen
tative, C. E. .Wynn-Johnson. It is a
largo building and its outward appear
ance of rusted sheet iron gives no in
dication of the quantity of good lum
ber contained in its structure. There
Is a great quantity of excellent seas
oned cedar and fir. Mr. Itjen is In
no rush about the destruction of the
building and, with one assistant, will
employ himself for the nezt month
In pulling It apart, taking care of
the lumber a3 he goes. The building
cost him $100 and he says he will
more than get his money back. He
Intends to add another story to his
Bay View hotel at the wharf with the
lumber taken out.
The Astoria was one of the first
big hotels to be built in Skagway,
dating back to about 1897. It was a
rather pretentious affair at the time.
It has not been occupied since the
soldiers left town and has fallen Into
such decay that it has become an eye
sore and its demolition will be wel
comed.

NEW LI WILL
BE SHORTER
The Katalla Herald of recent date
says:
Thomas G. White, chief of scouts
for the Copper River & Northwestern
company's railroad survey party, was
in town on Monday from camp 17 on
Martin river, where the engineering
corps now has its hoadquarters. The
ice has disappeared from the streams
in that section, although some of the
lakes are still frozen over. The sur
veyors are making good progress not
withstanding evil weather and other
handicaps, and they probably will
have finished locating the line to the
crossing by the first of the month.
It Is said that the route now being
located will be ten miles shorter than
the original line located last year, the
distance from Katalla to Cordovn by
the new route from Martin river,
being about eighty miles. L. J. Cas
well, the railroad company's locitlug
engineer, is now in the Martin river
country.
Doc Sewell, manager of the Huvner
Drug company of Haines and Douglas
has been visiting in Haines for a
few days and will return on the next
Georgia to Douglas.
