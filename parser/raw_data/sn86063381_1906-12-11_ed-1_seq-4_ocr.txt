FRANCE APPEARS TO BE ON THE
VERGE OF A BITTER RELIG-
IOUS WARFARE.
CATHOLIC CHURCH TO IGNORE LAW
IMMEDIATE PROSECUTIONS IN
THOUSANDS OF CASES LOG-
ICAL OUTCOME.
Paris, Dec. 11 The press unani
mously recognizes the extreme gravity
of the religious issue precipitated by
the pope's mtransigeant attitude and
many paueis predict a veritable relig
ious warfare. The government's cal
culations have clearly been upset and
new legislative authority may be nec
essary to enable it to cope with the
situation It having been decided that
after Dec 11 rel'gious services may
not be held without a preliminary dec
laration under the law of 1881 the
pope's orders entail the immed'ate
initiation of prosecutions in 36,000
communes and logicalb the invasion
of churches by the police for the pur
pose of pronouncing their dissolution
and expelling the parish priests The
militant Catholics seemingly hail with
Joy the prospect of violence which will
compel the closing of the chinches,
with the attendant excitement of relig
ious passions Jaures, the Social
ist leader, professes to believe that the
Vatican has deliberately determined
to test the strength of the party of
reaction in an effoit to
Overthrow the Republic.
The Socialist organs generally, how
ever, regard the pope instructions as
being the result of the government's
weakness in offering any concession
bejond the foimation of the cultural
associations contemplated under the
law of 1905 and declare that the gov
ernment now has no alternative except
to insist on declarations being made
or show the ecclesiastics the door
The conseivative papers advise the
government to remain true to its lib
eral principles, contending that the
more the church is intolerant and
panic stiicken the more authority it
will need, provided the government
does not lose its head The govern
ment has made preparations to cope
with the situation, but is keeping
them secret, evidently waiting to see
whether any considerable proportion
of the clergy will revolt. The cab
inet, however, maintains a resolute
front. Instructions to the public
prosecutors have been telea iaphcd
broadcast. Premier Clemencean is
quoted as saying:
if the church elects to have war it
will have it, but the world will bear
witness that the Vatican is like a for
eign power trying to dispute the au
thority of the French government
IMMENSE DAMS USELESS.
Colorado River Again Flowing Into
Salton Basin.
Yuma, Ariz Dec 11 Once more
the entire Colorado river is flowing
into the Salton sink and Imperial and
Coachella valleys are once more
menaced by rising waters. The main
line of the Southern Pacific must
again be moved to higher ground un
less the water can be brought under
control. A thousand people in Salton
basin must lose their homes, includ
ing 250,000 acres of farming lands,
the Southern Pacific must build 200
miles of new main line and irrigation
about Yuma must be abandoned. At
a conservative estimate more than
125,000,000 of present values are at
stake upon the success of the efforts
to close the break
What is known as the Hind dam
was thrown across the new channel
and an earth dyke was built up paral
lel to the river for ten miles, mainly
in Mexico On the Arizona side of the
river is the government dyke. Four
days ago water found its way through
both dykes, flooding large areas. This
was thought to be serious, but was not
considered critical until Saturday
night, when the water developed a
distinct channel, and Sunday morning
disclosed the fact that the entire river
had found its way around the Hind
dam into the channel from which it
had just been barred. The dam itself
is uninjured

TOTTERING WALLS BLOWN DOWN
Firty-eight-Mile Gale Sweeps Over
San Francisco,
San Francisco, Dec. 11 A south
east gale sweeping along the coast at
a registered velocity of forty-eight
miles an hour resulted in the death of
one man in San Fraucisco and in the
seveie injury of several others. Ship
ping in the harbor was damaged con
siderably and in all quarters of the
city tottering walls were hurled to the
ground, blockading stieets and Inter

South Chicago in the last twenty-four
hours One man was burned to death
by falling upon a plate of red hot
steel, another was killed by a switch
engine, a third was asphyxiated by
coal gas and two others were crushed
to death by pieces of falling steel.
All of the men were Polish and Hun
garian laborers.
A Fnmous Bell.
The emperor's great bell in the Ca
thedral of Cologne was consecrated
with great pomp Twenty-two cannon
taken from the French were assigned
by the Emperor William for its manu
facture. It was cast by Andreas
Etamm of Frankenthal, and more than
$20,000 was paid for the casting.
It bears an inscription recording
that "William, the most august em
peror of the Germans nnd king of the
Prussians, mindful of the heavenly
help granted to him whereby he con
ducted the late French war to a pros
perous issue and restored the German
empire, caused cannon taken from the
French to be devoted to founding a
bell to be hung in the wonderful ca
thedral then approaching completion."
A likeness of St. Peter, the name
patron of the church, is on the side,
beneath which is a quatrain in the
style of the mediaeval conceits, pray
ing that as devout hearts rise heaven
ward at hearing the sound of the bell
so may the doorkeeper of heaven open
wide the gates of the celestial mansion.
On the opposite side is inscribed a sex
tet in German.

Where New England Is Pre-eminent.
From the standpoint of mental eth
nology New England is as different
from the rest' of the United States as
Brittany or Provence from the rest of
Prance, Piedmont from the rest of It
aly, Bavaria from the rest of Ger
many. Those features the existence of
which can be scientifically proved and
the extent of which can be readily
measured are a high birth rate of gen
ius, a passion for reading, a high di
vorce rate, a low natality, a high death
rate from diseases of the nervous sys
tem. The correlation between some
of these traits is obvious. Between
others it is obscure. But we must re
member that mental ethnologj is a
science born yesterday. Today it gath
ers facts. Tomorrow it will compare
these and from them derive laws.

GILLETTE SENTENCED TO DIE.
Will Be Electrocuted During Week of
Jan. 28.
Herkimer, N. Y Dec. 11.Chester
E. Gillette was sentenced during the
day to be electrocuted during the week
beginning Jan. 28 for the murder of
Drace Brown.
Gillette showed no signs of emotion
when Justice Devendorf pronounced
sentence. His face was pale, but his
step was steady and his voice was
firm when, in reply to the formal ques
tion as to whether he had anything
to say before sentence was pro
nounced, he replied:
"I am innocent of the crime charged
In the indictment and theiefore it
should not be passed."
After he had been sentenced Gillette
left the courtroom, not even speaking
to his mother, who sat by him in
court, having arrived from Denver
during the forenoon While the sou
was led from court Mrs Gillette pre
pared to send a news dispatch to a
Denver and New York newspaper that

FORMER SENATOR BROWN OF
UTAH SHOT BY WOMAN IN
WASHINGTON.
Washington, Dec 11.Former Sen
ator Arthur Brown of Utah, who was
shot and seriously wounded Saturday
last by Mrs. Anna M. Bradley, still
remains in a critical condition. It
was stated at the Emeigensy hospital
that he passed a fairly comfortable
night and that his chance- for recov
ery had improved considei ably.
Mrs. Bradley, who has been re
moved to the house of detention, spenx
a sleepless night and is nearer col
lapse than at any time since she did
the shooting. She moans piteously
and continually asks for the condition
of her victim Physicians attending
her are watching for traces of insanity
and will make a report to the district
attorney before the end of the week.
The cause of the shooting, so far as
Mrs. Biadley will say, is that Senator
Brown was the father of her two chil
dren and that he refused to marry her
despite his repeated promises to make
her his wife.
She said she urged Senator Brown
to marry her, that he had been instru
mental in the divorce between her
husband and herself and that, as his
wife was dead, he now could "do the
right thing" by her This, she said,
he positively refused to do.
Brown and Mrs Bradley achieved
notoriety about three years ago, when
Mrs. Brown sued for a divorce from
her husband, charging Brown and Mrs.
Biadley with criminal relations.
ALL ON BOARD RESCUED.
Steamer Monarch Runs Aground Near
Isle Royale.
Port Huron, Mich., Dec. 11.Word
has been received at the office in Sar
nia, Ont., of the Northern Navigation
company that the passenger steamer
Monarch of that line ran aground
near Isle Royale and sank. The crew
of thirty-men and a passenger list of
about the same number were rescued
by a tug and are sheltered at a small
island in the vicinity Another tug
has been sent from Port Arthur,' Ont,
to bring the rescued people to that
city. The Monarch left Port Arthur
last Thursday and is thought to have
turned back during the gale and to
have been trying to return to Port
Arthur when she went aground. The
steamer was built in Sarnia twenty
four years ago, was valued at $60,000
and was fully insured. She is said to
be a total loss.

BILLAMV 8TORER REITERATES
ASSERTIONS MADE IN FIRST
LETTER TO PRE8IDENT.
QUOTES M6R. IRELAND TO PROVE IT
ROOSEVELT REPEATEDLY TOOK
CREDIT FOR THE ACTION
HE NOW REPUDIATES.
I Cincinnati, Dec. 11 Bellamy Storer,
(former ambassador to Austria-Hun
gary, has replied briefly to the state
ments contained in President Roose
velt's letter to Secretary of State Root,
which was given to the press Sunday
night. Mr. Storer insists on the posi
tion he has heretofore taken and relt
jerates the assertions made by him in
the statement to the members of the
(foreign relations committee of con
gress, made public last week. Mr.
Storer said:
"I seem to have been elected a mem
bey of the 'Annanias club,' like all oth*
era who have come into dispute with
President Roosevelt. I am now to be
'classed with Senators Chandler, Till
man, Bailey and with others who
have questioned some act or word of
the president. Like every other Amer
ican gentleman who has a wife to pro
tect I undertook to protect her name
from insinuations and charges of,
falsehood."
Mr. Storer then reiterated much
that appeared in his first statement in
tended for private circulation, he
claims,* and added that he has four
letters bearing on the controversy as
to the promotion of Archbishop lie
land, all of which he claims tend to
bear out his contention that "I obeyed
the explicit instructions of Mr. Roose
velt in acting as I did with regard to
the promotion." Continuing, Mr. Storer
said:
"Archbishop Ireland told me also
that the president on several occa
sions in conversation with him took
the credit for the action he now repu
diates."
Continuing his remarks Mr. Storer
said:
Declares Roosevelt Sidestepped.
"The crux of the whole matter which
led to my removal was the action
taken by Mrs. Storer and myself with
regard to the promotion of Arch
bishop John Ireland of St. Paul to the
cardinalate. In my letter to the pres
ident and cabinet I cite letters writ
ten by Roosevelt to me speaking in
the highest terms of Mgr. Ireland and
expressing the personal wish that the
country might profit by his promotion
to the cardinalate. On Dec. 2, 1903,
I had an audience with Pope Plus X.,
at which I transmitted a verbal note,
the basis of which had been given me
by President Roosevelt. I was par
ticularly careful in its preparation and
after transcribing it into English I
translated it into Fiench and con
veyed it to the pope. The communi
cation was as follows.
'He said to me and authorized me
to say to your holiness that the arch
bishop of St. Paul is his personal
friend and that he possessed his
whole confidence as a prelate and as a
citizen that he earnestly desired for
Mgr. Ireland all the honors of the
ohurch and that he would view with
the greatest pleasure and satisfaction
the elevation to the rank of cardinal
of Mgr. Ireland.'
"Now as to the charge that I acted
without warrant in this matter I have
only to cite the fact that Archbishop
Ireland In conversation with me told
me that President Roosevelt had told
him of all I had done and instead of
criticising me for my actions seemed
to take great credit to himself.
"Everything was all right until a
Bection of New York churchmen began
to agitate the -elevation of another
archbishop than Mgr. Ireland. They
pointed out to Roosevelt that the New
York prelate had at least as much
claim to the red hat as the arch
bishop of St. Paul. This resulted in
much perturbation at the White House
and letters were sent to me by Roose
velt pointing out that what might be
Very appropriate as the opinion of a
private citizen would come with a
frery, bad grace as president of the
United States."
SUPPRESSED CERTAIN FACTS.
Roosevelt's Reply to Storer's First
Pamphlet.
Washington, Dec. 11. President
Roosevelt has made public a long let
ter addressed to Secretary Root giving
the con espondence between the pres
ident and former Ambassador Bellamy
Btorer, at Vienna, and Mrs. Storer, in
tvhich he says that Mr. Storer's refusal
to answer his letters and the publica
tion of various private letters justified
the ambassador's removal that Mr.
Btorer's publication of private corre
spondence was peculiarly ungentle
manly and that he (the president)
bad stated with absolute clearness his
position, the reason why it was out of
fee question for him as president to
try to get any archbishop made car
dinal, though expressing his admira
tion for Archbishop Ireland as well as
leaders of other denominations.
He says he thinks it well that the
members of the cabinet should know
certain facts, "which he (Storer)
Mther suppresses or misstates."
evident that they were likely to dam*
American Interests."
He says Mrs. Storer urged him to
give her husband a cabinet place and
that she stated Mr. Choate at London ______
and General Porter at Paris were no*'
proper persons to be ambassadors,
suggesting her husband in that connec
tion.
The president incorporates a letter
from Postmaster General Cortelyou
contradicting the statement that Pres
ident McKinley had commissioned a
gentleman to ask the pope, "as a per
sonal favor to him" and as an "honor
to the country," to appoint Archbishop
Ireland as cardinal. Mr. Cortelyou
says the late president never made
any such request.
The president declared that Mr.
Storer's statement that he authorized
any such message to be delivered to
Pope Pius Is untrue. He says that he
never received a letter from Ambas
sador Storer giving an account of his
visit to the Vatican and of the mes
sage he personally gave the pope on
behalf of Mr. Roosevelt.
The president's action follows the
publication of "the confidential
pamphlet" which Mr. Storer last week
sent to the president, the cabinet and
the senate foreign relations committee.
IRELAND HAS NOTHING TO SAY.
Refuses to Discuss Roosevelt-Storer
Correspondence.
New York, Dec. 11.Archbishop
Ireland, who was a central figure in
the correspondence of President
Roosevelt and Bellamy Storer, just
made public, is in the city at the Mur
ray Hiil hotel. When visited by re
porters the archbishop stated that ev
erybody should understand the deli
cacy of his position and the impro
priety on his part of doing any talk
ing in regard to the subject.
The visit of his grace to the city at
this time is to attend the annual meet
ing of the National Civic federation.
DECIDES TO GALL A HALT
ROOSEVELT WILL END MOVE-
MENT TO DRAG HIM INTO
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
Washington, Dec. 11. President
Roosevelt has announced his intention
of taking vigorous steps to put a stop
to the movement which has seemed to
be dragging him against his will into
another race as leader of the Repub
lican party.
In talks with public men the pres
ident has in mind to make his friends
and admirers call a halt in their at
tempt to stampede the country into
demanding that he stand for re-elec
tion in 1908. But he has not unfolded
his plans in their entirety, being con
tent to assert that the thing he seeks
can be accomplished and that he will
see to it that it is.
One of the reasons brought to bear
on the president by those who insist
that he will be the logical candidate
to succeed himself is that William J.
Bryan is certain to be the Democratic
nominee and that no Republican aside
from the present White House occu
pant can defeat him at the polls. Pres
ident Roosevelt, however, does not be
lieve Mr. Bryan is so strong that it
may be said there is only one Repub
lican leader who can stand any show
against him and he is not willing to
admit that a victory over Bryan would
be a difficult matter in the abstract as
matters are now trending.
OIL TRUST ENTERS DEMURRER.
Would Nolle Indictments Recently Re
turned at Chicago.
Chicago, Dec. 11.The fight of the
Standard Oil company against the ten
indictments against the Standard Oil
company of Indiana, which were re
turned Aug. 29, was commenced dur
ing the day in the United States dis
trict court before Judge Landis. The
indictments contain 6,428 counts and
the Standard Oil attorneys entered a
demurrer. It is upon the latter that
the proceedings are based. The at
torneys of the Standard Oil company
contended in support of their demur
rer that section 10 of the rate law
passed by congress June 29 repeals
the Elkins law under which the gov
ernment is bringing the action against
the company and that the indictments
are not sufficiently specific because
they do not comprehend all of the ele
ments in the case.
The contention of the Standard Oil
sompany attorneys that the Elkins law
(3 repealed by the rate law and that
bffenses cannot therefore be punished
tinder the former act was contradicted
by United States District Attorney
bims, who declared that section 13 of
the Revised Statutes covered the case
In that it states that the repeal of an
Old statute does not condone prior

CONGO FREE STATE INQUIRY.
Senator Lodge Introduces Resolution
on Subject.
Washington, Dec. 11. Senator
Lodge has introduced a resolution rel

cites that the report of the inhumane
treatment inflicted upon the native in
habitants of the Congo Free State has
been of such a nature and so well sus
tained as to draw the attention of the
civilized world and excite both the
indignation and the compassion of the
people of the United States It re
solves that in the opinion of the sen
ate the time has come when the af
fairs of the Congo Free State should
be made the subject of international
inquiry. The senate advises the pres
ident that in any steps he may deem
it wise to take in co-operation with or
in aid of any of the powers signatories
of the treaty of Berlin which shall
seek to ameliorate the conditions of
the Congo Free State and redress any
evils now existing there he will re

ment in the president's name. He
said that words were inadequate to
express the deep emotion which he
experienced at receiving this distin
guished testimonial in behalf of the
president, who recently cabled that he
regarded this prize as one of the great
est honors which any .man in any
position throughout the world could
receive. The award, Mr. Peirce add
ed, would deeply appeal to the hearts
of the American people. Mr. Peirce

mittee with the view of maintaining
righteous peace in the industrial
world, which was as important as the
maintenance of peace in the world of
nations. The following is the text of
President Roosevelt's dispatch:
Gratified by Honor Shown Him.
"I am profoundly gratified and
touched by the signal honor shown
me through your body in conferring on
me the Nobel peace prize. There is
no gift I could appreciate more and 1
wish it were in my power to fully ex
press my gratitude. I thank you for
it and I thank you in behalf of the
United States, for what I did I was
able to accomplish only as the repre
sentative of the nation of which for
the time being I am president. After
much thought I have concluded that
the best and most fitting way to ap
ply the amount of the prize is by us
ing it as a fund to establish at Wash
ington a peimanent industrial peace
committee The object will be to
strive for better and more equitable
relations among my countrymen who
are engaged, whether as capitalists or
wageworkers, in industrial and agri
cultural pursuits This will carry out
the purpose of the founder of the
prize, for in modern life it is impor
tant to work for .the cause of just and
righteous peace in the industrial world
as in the world of nations."
The Nobel peace prize is part of a
bequest left by Dr. Alfred Bernhard
Nobel, the Swedish scientist, who died
in 1896. By his will a large portion of
his fortune was devoted to five annual
prizes, each valued at about $40,000.
They were awarded for the most im
portant discoveries in physics, chem
istry, physiology or medicines, for the
most distinguished work of an idealis
tic tendency in the field of literature
and for the best effort toward the fra
ternity of nations and the promotion
of peace. The last named is awarded
by the Norwegian parliament. The
others are awarded by institutions at
Stockholm. CANDLE CAUSES GAS EXPLOSION.
