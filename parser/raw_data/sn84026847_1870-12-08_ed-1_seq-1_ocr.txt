but few prisoners, and no ammunition.
Tours, December 6. ? Official reports

Some Account n of the Late Fl(ktli(
Around Parlt-Hpffnlatlon* n* tm
the Duration of the Siege.
London, December 6. ? The Tribune
correspondent writes from Versailles on
the 1st: The German loss in the sortie
at Stains was inconsiderable. The
shells fell at a greater range than was
believed the forts could carry, reaching
beyond- Mont Morency. The whole
range was 6300 metres. At Epinay the ,
French rfiade a rush at three in the af
ternoon, and surprised a battalion of the
Seventy-first. Under a heavy fire from
Briche the French simultaneously burst
out from Fort St. Denis, and a gunboat
coming down the stream sweptthe banks
of German forces and landed a force
at Epinay, occupying the houses near the
river and west of the village. The
French were in overwhelming numbers.
The Germans fell back fighting, and
evacuated the village. Reinforcements
arriving from St. Gratien, the French
barricaded Epernay. The Germans
sent the whole of the Fifteenth Brigade,
the Seventy-first and Thirty-first Keci
ments, six battalions in all, to retake
the village. This force advancing,
rapidly, the French were driven out.
In two hours the Germans lost 200 men
and thirteen officers.
Another dispatch from the same cor
respondent, December 3, afternoon,
says : The German officers believe the
siege may still exteud beyond Christmas
on military grounds, but hope that the
French have been discouraged by their
failures in the recent sorties, especially
by the final recapture Champigny yes

Strike of I lie fonl Mlnfri-An At
tempt by the Manager* !? Ball Ike
CokI Market ? TUonMnd of Mea rat
of Employment?1 Trouble Appre
hended.
Scran ton, Pa., Decetpber 6.? The
miners do not hesitate to say that the
strike lias been originated and brought
about by the managers for the purpose
of bulling coal. At this moment be
tween 3*l,00t) and 40,000 miners are out
of employment in this country, and as
fast as the news flashed over the wires
the members of the Miners' and La
borers' Benevolent Union, commenced
enrolling in the grand army of strikers.
Thi# Society is composed of Welsh,
Irish, English, Americans and Germans,
and has over 40,000 members,all bound
by the result of the meeting of the Grand
Council, which refuses all compromise
with the managers.
The Chief Clerk of the coal depart-,
ment of the Delaware, Lackawana and
Western Kailroad, says that the com
pany has 150,000 tons of coal on hand,
which is distributed in the yards at
Scranton, Port Washington, Hoboken,
Elizabeth, Syracuse, Buffalo and Ithica,
and in transit at Great Bend and N?w
Hampton Junction. The three great
companies which control the anthracite
region are the Delaware, Laokawaoa A
Western, Pennsylvania, and Delaware
& Hudson Canal Coal Company. They
employ nearly 40,000 men, including
the brakemen and laborers employed on
the several roads which transport coal.
All of the latter sympathise with the
stokers, and are necessarily out of em
ployment when the miners arc not at
work.
Much excitement exists and the citi
zens are ereatly alarmed. Liquor is
freely used and trouble is apprehended.
The Union has a fund of $200,000, all
of which the strikers will expend rather
than submit to the injustice sought to
be done them and which they say is
only a scheme to raise the price of coal,
after which the companies will acceed
to their demands.
Thk Radicals in the Bloomington
Senatorial district of Illinois have made
a curious blunder. They wanted to
send Michael Donahue to the State Sen
ate, and printed the name Patrick on
the tickets. Thej had a majority, but
are immenselj disgusted when an ob
scure ditcher named Patrick Donabne
comes forward and claims the election,
while Michael takes a back seat

Mm
Washisgtox, December 7. ? The
President said to a Senator, yesterday,
that he had not yet decided on an ap
pointment for the English mission. No
cabinet officers, Senators or members
have yet been found who know anything
j of the subject, and it is believed that
the President has kept his own council
throughout. The Senators think there
is no cause /or haste, and there is no
need for a Minister until the adminis
tration is prepared to give definite in
structions on the Alabama claims, aud
that this cannot be done until the senti
SP* of Congress is developed. The
President is also said to have remarked
that he is in nohurrv to appoint a Com
missioner of Internal Revenue; that he
is satiflBed with the conduct of Doug
lass, and that no harm can follow a
delay.
T be Committee en Banking and Car.
reoey
Will hold their first meeting to-day.
The question, the resumption of specie

as to which the subject of resumption
properly belongs. Each committee
claim jurisdiction over it.
A Circular
Signed by all the delegates from Wis
consin, except one, advocating the pass
age of the resolution granting lands to
a railroad to be built from Madison to
Lake Sunerior, was distributed among
the members of the Hou9e yesterday.
This is a common practice among lobby
ists, but it is beiieved that Congress
men have not before resorted to it.
The President and Admiral Porter.
There is no longer any doubt among
the senators and members that the
rank of Admiral of the navy will be
speedily abolished, because the office is
useless and partly to relieve the Presi
dent from the embarassment.of deciding
whether to nominate Admiral Porter,
or not. All the Senators and members
who have expressed opinions are in
favor of abolishing the office. The)
President has not resumed his friendly
relations with Admiral Porter, and he
manifests much disappointment and
chagrin at Porter's course. The orig
inal letter of Porter's to Secretary Welles
is now at the White House and is ex
hibited to the Congressmen who are curi
ous to view it.
