CAME HOME LAST NIGHT
Ewing Lusk and Archie Gragg have
Completed Their Work of Surveying
" the Line from the Pecos River to
Lubbock and Have Only the Line
from Roswell to the Pecos Grading
Will Be Started Here This Month.
It was generally believed in Ros
well that the survey that was being
made for the Roswell Attus & El Paso
railroad, at least that part of it 'be
tween the. Pecos River and the Texas
line, was only temporary- Ewing L.
Lusk, rodnian, 'and Archie Gragg, the
, transit man, who were of 'the survey
ing iparty, returned last night, report
ing that the line is complete from the
Pecos to Lubbock, Texas, and that it
is not only permanent, but with all
curves located. They state that the
grading work will tie underway here
before the first of the year; for Pro
moter Edward Kennedy has no fdea
of losing Roswell's bonus of $100,000
simply .because work was not started
in time.
Mr. Kennedy Ss in Elida today at
tending a meeting of townsite men.
He is interesting them in the matter
of townsites along the ijerv line; for

FRAUD PROPOSITION

Says Its Editor and Proprietor Jos
eph Pulitzer, Should be Prosecuted
by the Government for Blackening
the Name of the American People
The Purchase of the Canal Property
President Says, Has Been Entirely
Regular. ..
Washington, Dec. 15. .President
Roosevelt today sent to the 'Senate
a statement concerning the purchase
of the Panama Canal property by the
United States, and denouncing in
strong language ' the charges that
there was anything wrong in the ac
quisition of the canal property. These
stories, he continues, "Were first
brought to my attention when publish
ed in a paper in Indianapolis, called
the iNews, edited by Delaven Smith.
The stories were scurrilous and libel
ous in character and false in every
essential particular. Smith shelters
himself behind the excuse that he
merely accepted the statements which
had appeared in a paper published in
New York, the World, owned by Jos
eph Pulitzer. It 4s idle to say that Pul
itzer's well known character and his
paper's are such that a statement in
his paper is 'believed by nobody. Un
fortunately thousands of persons are
Ill-informed in this respect and be
lieve statements they see in print,
even though they appear in a news
paper published by Pulitzer.''
After pointing out the mistakes and
the alleged misrepresentations on the
part of the authors of the story, the
President continues:
"The real offender is Joseph Pulit
zer, editor and proprietor of the
World. While the criminal offense of
which Pulitzer has been gui.j. 1j 'l

left to private citizens to sue Pulitzer
for libel. He ..should be prosecuted tor
libel by the government authorities.
It is, therefore, a high national duty
to bring to justice as a villifler, this
man who wants only and wickedly and
without a trace of justification, seeks
to Iblacken the. character of the popu
lation and private citizens and to con
vict the government of his country la
the eyes of the civilized world, of
wrong-doing of the basest and foulest
kind, when he has not one shadow of
justification of any sort for the charg
es he has made. The Attorney General
has had under consideration the form
in which the proceedings against Pul
itzer shall he brought."
The President refers to various pap
ers which he transmits with his mes
sage, explaining the method of the
purchase. The President takes upon
himself all responsibility, for all he
has done was to carry out the will of
Congress.
"The action of the government," he
says, " was wholly uninfluenced by any
question of who were or were not the
stock holders In either the new or the
old company. Our concern was to get
the canal property, which was owned
by the French company and to see
that the title was clear. Our transac
tion was carried on openly and pub
lished in detail. The United States did
not have anything to do with distrib
uting a dollar of the money paid ex
cept in following the instructions of
the French court and that under cir
cumstances that give not the slightest
need for Cromwell to give any infor
mation." "Nevertheless," he continues,
"Cromwell, of his own accord sub
mitted to me together with a copv of
his statement published on the 11th
instant, and which I transmit here
with, a full list of the stockholders of
the new Panama Canal Company of
France, on January 15, 1900, number
ing over 600, who were present, at a
special meeting of the company held
February 28, 1902, immediately after
the cable of the offer of the company
to the United States to accept the ap
praisement of $40,000,000 made by the
Isthmian Canal Commission."
"So far .as this government is con
cerned," continues the President, "ev
ery step of the slightest importance
has been made public by the 'proper
officials."
