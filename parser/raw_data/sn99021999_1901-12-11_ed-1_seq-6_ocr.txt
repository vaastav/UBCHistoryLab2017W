A QVKST1UX OF ItUVEX VE.
Those who ndvocate the free admis
sion of Cuban sugar or n large reduc
tion of the duty on sugar Imported
from that Island pnKe something
that would not only endanger the ex
istence- of the home Industry, but would
ul take from the government n large
revenue. .Sugar Is the largest revenue
producer in the customs list. For
six years ltefore the McICInley tariff
was enacted, which placed sugar on
the free list, that article yielded In
revenue over S.'O.ooo.OW a year. In 18K9
the sutiar revenue was ?01,42S,.T1, In
10(h) It was ?.", ii",""'-' and on account
of the liKTonslnir production lit home It
Is estimated that the revenue for the
current llscal year will be about ?IS,000,
J00. Obviously this Is too large nn Item of
revenue to discard, even under the
present condition of a large excess of
receipts over expenditures, and If It
should be dtscarded there could be no
reduction of Internal taxes, ns de
manded by the people and urged Ay the
president and secretary of the treasury.
Is It wise and sound policy to take
revenue from the government In tho
Interest of Cuban sugar producers and
maintain taxation of our own people,
characterized by Secretary tJage as In
Us nature vexntlous and In some In
stances oppressive? It is perfectly
clenr that we cannot glvo the Cubans
what they ask and nlso give our own
IcopIe the relief from taxation which
they desire und certainly ought to hnve.
The president recommended In his mes
sage n substantial reduction in the
duties on Cuban products. This is in
definite, but If the president Is disposed
to grant the Cubans what they desire
then the war taxes Imposed upon our
people must remain.
Tills Is a matter which it seems to us
congress must consider, particularly In
view of the fact that concessions to Cu
ban sugar would probably not benefit In
the least American consumers. It Is
extremely doubtful If sugar would be
appreciably cheapened to the consumer
even if Cuban sugar were admitted to
our market free. Therefore a "sub
stantial reduction" In the duty would
be of no advantage to our people so far
ns the price of sugar Is concerned. It
would take revenue from tho govern
ment, endanger the existence and cer
tainly stop the development of the
home Industry, without any compensat
ing benellt to the American people.
The domestic beet nnd cane sugar In
dustries urge that they nro equally
entitled with other Industries to pro
tection. It Is not proposed or contem
plate! to chnnge any tariff schedule ex
cept that of sugar. The president and
tho republican leaders In congress de
clare that this Is not the time to Inter
fere with the tariff and that protection
to our Industries must bo maintained
except as to sugar. This our beet and
cane sugar Interests very naturally re
gard as an unfair and unjust discrimi
nation and It must be admitted that the
weight of argument Is on their side.
Nevertheless some concession will
doubtless be made to Cuban sugur,
though we cannot believe that congress
will go as far as tho. planters of Cuba
desire.
H',, LKASE TElllllTURY.
Nicaragua has already signed n proto
col agreeing to pcrietunlly lease to the
United States territory through which
to construct n canal. This agreement
contemplates the leasing of a strip six
miles wide, which Is four miles less
than recommended by the Isthmian
Canal commission,, but undoubtedly
should our government desire that the
territory to be leased shall be ten miles
wide there will be no dllllculty In secur
ing the concession. It Is also necessary
to lease territory from Costa Ulca and
undoubtedly that country will be found
entirely willing to make whatever
terms the United States shall desire.
A Washington dispatch says that n
treaty will not be negotiated with the
two Central American republics until
the senate has ratllled the new canal
treaty, wlileh It Is thought may be done
before the holiday recess. The treaty
has been favorably reported to the sen
ate from the committee on foreign re
lations and Senator Lodge has announced
that Its consideration In executive ses
slon will be pressed from day to day.
There Is some opposition, though it is
not expected to greatly delay action,
and thcro appears to be no doubt that
when thu opposition has had a hearing
the treaty will be ratified.. With that
accomplished no further obstruction Is
anticipated.
TREATIES VIIUUAHLV DEAD. "
It Is probable that tho reciprocity
treaties which are before the senate will
not be ratllled. Indeed, this has been
the opinion since the appearance of the
president's message, for while Mr.
Koosevolt made n strong and earnest
argument for the principle of reciprocity,
Ids only reference to the pending
treaties was to ask the attention of tho
senate to them. Senator Cullom, who
ns chairman of tho foreign relations
committee would have charge of tho
light for tho treaties, Is reported as
saying that it begins to look as If
they would not be ratllled.
In nn Interview a few days ago the
Illinois senator said: "Thu California
senators tell mo they nro afraid of tho
Jamaica treaty; they think It would let
in somu fruits In competition with
theirs. Tho Connecticut senators tell
mo they are afraid some Industry there
Is goliiK to be hurt If the Kreneh treaty
Is ratllled. The .Maine senators have
local Interests which must bo pro
tected from competition. And so it goes.
In half tho states of tho union there
nro Interests which think they nro going
to be hurt If the treaties nro ratllled.
The consequence is there are enough
senators to mako a combination and de
feat all the treaties. I'erhaps It is early
to say Just what will be done, but It
looks now as If the treaties hud very
llttlo chance." Of course If none of
these treaties Is ratllled the effect will
be to throw cold water on the whole
scheme uf reciprocity. Countries which
may desire to establish closer trade re
lations with the United States will bo
disinclined to make any effort in that
direction when there Is such uncertainty
regarding the result of negotiations.
They will naturally reason that If the
pending treaties, carefully drawn nnd
Imvlnir the approval of so thorough a
protectionist as .Mr. McKlnley, are not
acceptable to a republican senate It Is
hardly possible that any reciprocity nr
rangetneiit could be uogotlntcd that
would receive the approval of that body.
Thus tile failure of these treaties would
be very likely to end for the present at
tempts to negotiate reciprocity agree
ments, thereby practically abandoning
the policy which William McKlnley do
dared to be vital to the expansion of our
foreign commerce.
lWCKIbO THE LOCOMOTIVE.
Samuel (lompors. president of the
American Federation of I.nbor, who by
trade is a elu'ar maker, has planted him
self squarely against the use of machin
ery in the manufacture of cigars.
In the Interest of the American clgnr
makers he Is reported to favor a boy
cott of niaehlne-inade cigars.
In taking this position Mr, Gompers
Is very much like the man who tried to
buck the locomotive. This is an nge of
machinery nnd every practical labor
saving appliance, although It innv tem
porarily displace labor, has in the end
been found to be bencficlal'to the tollers.
Machinery has not only enlsrced tho
scope of Industry, but It has placed tho
wngoworker In condition to enjoy tho
benefits of cheapened production.
herover machinery has crowded out
worklngmen from one trado It has
oiK'ued tho door for them lu nnothcr nnd
Una ultimately contributed toward
lessening the hours of labor and raising
the wages of the lnborer.
Take, for example, the printer's trade.
The typesetting machines have dis
placed a lar;e number of compositors,
but by reducing the cost of composition
they have Increased the canacltv of the
publisher to'supply the ever-growing de
mand for books and periodicals. Inci
dentally typesetting machines have ena
bled publishers of newspapers to double
and treble the quantity of rending mnt-
ter in the papers, thus benelltlni: the
general public. The fear that the adop
tion of the typesetting machine would
reduce the earnings of compositors has
proved groundless. The machine opera
tors are earning higher wnges than any
class of printers did before their Intro-
dtictlon, with shorter hours, and the raise
of the wages or the machine operator
has carried with It n higher wage for
the hand typesetter.
What is true of tho printers Is enuullv
true of nil branches of the printing
trade. The Invention and Improvement
of the rotary presses has enormously
multiplied the speed and capacity for
turning out every class of printed mat
ter, with corresponding benefits to the
pressmen, stereotypors. elect rotvners
and other mechanics employed lu the
printing trades.
It stands to reason that the Introduc
tion of machinery In the manufacture
of cjgnrs Is bound to produce the same
results in the long run. If machine
made cigars nre as perfect as hand
made cigars, tho, machine will mnke Its
way Into tho cigar factory, boycott or
no boycott. Instead of trying to buck
the locomotive, the cigar makers would
do better to adjust themselves to tho
conditions that murk the world's
progress In the twentieth century.
Several months ago .Millard Fillmore
Funkhouser, ns chnlrmnn of tho finance
committee of the school board, pre
vailed upon his associates to adopt reso
lutions demanding tho calling of a grand
Jury to probe what he called well-defined
rumors of bhickmull by municipal
olliclals. With extraordinary credulity
the board voted these resolutions on
Funkhouser's representation that he
was possessed of ample Information to
Justify such n step. The grand Jury
has been In session nearly six weeks,
but Funkhouser hns not yet volun
teered to appear before that body with
tlie information locked up lu his bosom.
The reason given by Funkhouser for
this failure to show up Is that he has
not yet been subpoenaed, which means
that no deputy sheriff has as yet deliv
ered him a paper guaranteeing ?2 for
his testimony. Mr. Funkhouser's Ideas
of the duty qf 'citizens who claim to
have knowledge of criminal conduct on
the part of public officers, or, for that
matter, of prlvato citizens, aro very
queer. Is It not tho duty of every citi
zen who has knowledge of criminal
practices to furnish this Information to
the grand Jury without being cited by
the sheriff nnd paid for his evidence?
Is It not much more so tho duty of, a
man who publicly demands a grand
Jury Inquisition ns a prosecuting wit
ness? Soveral influential democratic papers
nre protesting vigorously at tho efforts
of men prominent In tho democratic na
tional organization to assist Senator
Tillman In South Carolina to freeze
Senator Mcl.aurlu out of tho party.
They see nothlug but what Is pernicious
in Tillman's leadership and fall to com
prehend how tho party can gain any
thing by following n southern swash
buckler who hns made himself so ob
noxious to northern democrats. Hut that
Tillman Is animated by the Inspiration
of Hrynn, ns whose spokesman ho acted
In the Knnsas City convention, must not
be forgotten. The light for Tillmnn Is
simply part of the light to keep the
Hryanltes in control of tho democratic
organization nnd no mere protest will
avail unless backed by thu wholu body
of democrats who want tho whole party
reorganized.
Among the complications likely to em
barrass tho proposed consolidation of
Omaha aud South Omaha under one
government are the contracts and fran
chises granted by South Omaha to gas,
electric lighting, street railway, tele
phone and witter companies. In whatever
respect these frnehUes may differ from
or bo lu conflict with tho privileges
granted to these same- companies by tho
city tit Omaha, they will naturally pro
voko contention that may lead to almost
endless litigation lu the courts. It goes
without saying (hat wherever consolida
tion would enlarge the privileges of the
friinchlsed corporations they would
cheerfully acquiesce, but wherever they
tend to curtail those privileges they
will resist and seek to obstruct or do
feat consolidation.
Tho Union Stock Yards company h:
held Its annual election nnd made Its
distribution, of surplus earnings. Iu
view of the recent decision of the
United States supreme court In the
Kansas case, stock yards are no longer
subject to state regulation and the com
pany will not hnve to set apart a spe
cial India-rubber fund for the benefit
of legislative lobbyists and holdups, In.
eldentnlly It Is to bo hoped the company
will be relieved of the necessity of
electing at least one stock yards attor
ney every two years to represent the
stock yards on tho Hoor of the state
senate.
Nobody In Omaha will have any ob
jections to the proposed enlargement of
privileges for the Fast Omaha Hrldge
and Terminal company by congres
sional legislation, but the taxpaylng
citizens of Omnhn have a right to In
sist that the bridge and terminal com
pany pay Its Just proportion of county
and city taxes. Such a demand Is
certainly not unreasonable or unjust.

Price of Corn Keeim Up.
Chicago Tribune.
In October of this year corn exports
amounted to only 3,800,000 bushels. In Oc
tober of last year shipments aggregated
13,500,000 bushola. Shipments from Atlantic
ports last week wcro only 273,000 bushels,
against 0,300,000 bushels for tho correspond
ing period In 1900. It Is evident that Eu
rope does not caro to tako much corn at
present prices. Theso prices, however, do
not seem to bo affected by tho decltno In
shipments. It follows, therefore, that thcro
must still bo a great deal of corn In tho
hands of producers, who arc holding It
In tho hope of prices even higher than
those which obtain now, or that the demand
for corn tor domestic purposes, such as
tho manufacturo of glucose, starch, break
fast foods, etc., Is so great ns to keep up
tho prlco In splto of tho falling off In tho
foreign demand. Tho census figures show
ing how many million bushels of corn woro
used In various domestic manufacturing
Industries during tho census year will bo
accessible beforo long. Undoubtedly tho
total will bo surprisingly large so largo
as to show the corn growers that they need
not bo afraid of raising too much of that
grain.

The pointed comments of Judgo Tulloy be
foro tho Iroquois club of Chicago upon the
rapid development of government by injunc
tion ennnot fall to arrest tho attention of '
tho thoughtful. With tho past twolvo
months United States Judges havo been par
ticularly busy reading new theories Into
tho law which they nro supposed to In
terpret. In tholr eagerness to exorcise
authority at critical moments they havo ar
rogated to themselves not only tho right of
tho loglslatlvo power to mako laws, but
tho duty of tho administrative branch of
the government to enforce them. The
fashion having been onco net, there has
grown n sort of rivalry botween tho courts
of equity as to which one can go tho
farthest. Tho process of the usurpation
of power by tho Judiciary Is thus briefly
described by Judgo Tulley:
"The. Judge, without bearing the defend
ant, decrees what ho shall or shall not do
In advance and without a hearing, enforces
the performance of tho commands of the
writ, then brings tho defendant beforo him,
tries him without a Jury, adjudges him
guilty of a violation of tho commands of
the writ formulated by the Judge himself
In tho absenco of tho defendant, and sen
tences him to a punishment not defined by
law, but resting In the breast ot such
Judgo.
"Is not such a proceeding by the Judgo
government by Injunction and n substitute
tor trial by Jury?"
If Judges can create new offenses unknown
to the statutes, prejudge defendants by an
ticipation, convict them without trial by
Jury nnd prescribe penalties out of hand
for acts not prohibited by law, tho guar
antees contnlned In the constitution aro of
no avail. If tho courts are correct In con
struing the right of Injunction as they havo
done of late, there Is nothing to prevent an
autocratic Judiciary from making still
further encroachments upon the liberty of
the Individual.
Mr. Bryan's
Chicago Chronicle (dcm.)
William Jennings Ilryau has conferred
a favor upon his fellow countrymen In the
democratic party nnd out of It He haa
given out a manifesto which. I In substanco
tho platform on which he will seek tho
next presidential nomination nt the hands
of tho national democracy
Mr. Bryan sayn that Imperialism nnd the
Independence of the Philippines nre still
burning political questions and that It Is
only by pushing them to the front thnt the
democrats can hope for success In 102.
By Inference, therefore, Mr. Hrynn has
recovered partially or permanently from his
unsound money delusion. Tho currency of
tho country Is apparently to remain tin-
threatened by Mr. Bryan during tho next
presidential canvas. For this promised re- t Philippine pcoplo nro of far moro assim
llcf from nu expected recurrence of flnan-i llnblo stock. They nro niornl, peaceful, In-
clal lunacy on Mr. Ilryan's pnrt tho entire
country ought to bo thankful.
Elimination of tho unsound money Issue
from national politics will leave Intellt- with convincing proofs of n Blncero pur
gent men of nil parties freo to discuss In poso to establish ninonx them firm, free,
tranquility and reason tho real national
Issues before tho American people.
Mr. Bryan will not find any considerable
number of his fellow citizens ready to agree
to his proposal that tho American flag ha
unconditionally withdrawn from tho Phil
ippine Islands. Ho snys "the war Is un-
necessary because tho pcoplo of thoss
Islands nro ready to lay down their arms
whenever their lndcpendcnco la promised
them." Mr. Brynn has no better means of
knowing this than any other American cltl-
zen.
