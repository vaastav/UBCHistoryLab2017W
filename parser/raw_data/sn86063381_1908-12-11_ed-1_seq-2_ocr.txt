PLAN TO CREATE COUNTY ASYLUMS.
An effort will be made at the
coming session of the legislature to
force the adoption'of the county
plan for the care of the state's in-
sane population. The state board
ot visitors has approved of the propo-
sition.
"The board of visitors will recom
mend that the present hospitlas and
asylums remain substantially as
they are, but that no appropriations
be made for additions to either ttie
Fergus Falls, Anoka or Hastings
Hospitals" said a county officer
yesterday. "The board will recom
mend that in addition to the present
system there be a greater system of
county assylums, under charge of
the board of control. The buildings
and equipment must be approved by
the board of control as well as the
plans before the buildings are con
structed.
"Such institutions, when author
ized by the board of control, shall
receive the inmates of that county
or of a group of counties combined
back from the state hospitals
The state will pay to each county
$3 per week for the care of the
patients. If the time should ever
come when a part of the expense
of the care of the insane should
be charged back to the counties
as is done in Wisconsin, this finan
cial arrangement would be modi
fied."
Dr. David Graham of Duluth
will introduce the bill to cover the
proposed change, at the coming
session of the legislature.
CAUSTIC COMMENT.
LA. G. Rutledge
Play is work that you don't have
to do.
Heroship is the first station on the
road to oblivion.
Every man knows his faults he is
told about them often enough.
A backslider gets the most criti
cism from the crowd he backslides
into.
When poverty knocks at the door
the neighbors look out of their
windows.
A great deal of fun is poked at the
selfmade man, but just the same he
can stand almost any climate.
A woman takes as much pride
in having a family physician as a
man does in knowing a millionaire.
Ambition has a queer way of mak
ing the ordinary person think that
reputation, fame and notoriety are
the same thing.
Explanations are made by beaten
prize fighters, losing ball teams and
people who make mistakes twice in
the same place.
Beggars on Horseback.
'Whoa, thar,' he says, jrallin' up his
hoss, and then he whines:
'For the love o' charity, kind gent,
would ye be so good as to gimme a
crust o' bread for meself and a handful
o* oats for the old mare?'"
The sailor smiled thoughtfully and
stirred his ice cream soda with a long
spoon.
Tes, Hal," he resumed, "there's ac
tual beggars on horseback in Roosia.
They travels from town to town in
caravans. They beg grub for them
selves and fodder for their nags, Just
as I been tellin' ye.
"O' course, In the Argentine, where
a hoss don't cost a song, it's only nat
ural ye should see beggars on horse
back, and I ain't sayin' nothln' about
that But in China they ride, too,
while there's a Maltese beggar down
Malta way what even drives a spring
wagon an' takes his gal along. Inter
rupts his canoodlin' to ask you for a
copper to stave off starvation, then
starts right in again where he left off."
New Orleans Times-Democrat.
An Unaccountable Failing.
It was a severe trial to Mr. Harding
that his only son's memory was not all
that could be desired. "Where in the
world he got such a forgetful streak
from Is beyond me," said the exasper
ated father to his wife on one occasion.
"What has he forgotten now?" asked
Mrs. Harding, with eyes downcast and
a demure expression.
The figures of the last return from
the election on the bulletin board."
And Mr. Harding inserted a finger in
his collar as if to loosen It and shook
bis head vehemently. "Looked at 'em
as he came past not half an hour ago,
and now can't tell me.
"As I said to him, 'If you're so stu
pid you can't keep a few simple figures
In your head, why don't you write 'em
down on a piece of paper, as I do, and
have done all my life, long before I
i your age?""
tAKES EFFECT IN JANUAftV
Advance in Transcontinental Freight
Traffic.
Washington, Dec. 11.Transcon-
tinental freight tariffs, beginning Jan
uary next, will be advanced on all
eastbound traffic both by rail and by
rail and water. The class rates on
westbound traffic will remain as they
are now. The commodity rate on west
bound traffic from Atlantic seaboard
points to Pacific coast terminals will
be increased approximately 10 per
cent.
On eastbound class rates there will
be' a decrease on first class shipments
from $3.70 per hundred pounds to $3
per hundred pounds. On claw? rates
on Chicago and Central Trahic asso
ciation territory from the Pacific coast
terminals there will be a decrease on
first class shipments from $3.40 per
hundred pounds to $3 per hundred
pounds. This will equalize the class
rates on both east and westbound
traffic.
The eistbound commodity rate
from the Pacific coast to Atlantic sea
board points will be advanced about
1 per cent on the average, some of
the items being as high os 60 per cent
advance and some as low as 3 per
cent. It is notable that the bulk of
the traffic moves under the commod
ity rates which show a decided in
crease.
This announcement was made by
the interstate commerce commission.
GREAT NORTHERN
TRAIN HELD UP
Action of FiremanPrevents Loot
ing of Express Gar.
Spokane, Wash., Dec. 11.Three
men held up westbound Great North
ern train No. 4 a mile and a half east
of Hiltyard, this state, robbed the
mail car and made their escape. Only
the presence of mind of W. Perrin,
the fireman, prevented the looting of
the express car, which carried a large
amount of money, including $20,000
consigned from a Spokane bank to a
Montana town.
The train had slowed down in the
yard at Hillyard when three men, all
armed with revolvers, crawled over
the tender and, covering the engineer
and fireman, ordered the train to be
brought to a stop a little over a mile
from the station. The enginemen
obeyed and when the train had come
to a standstill the bandits forced the
engineer and fireman to leave the
cab. While two of the robbers stood
guard over the engineer the other
took Fireman Perrin back to uncouple
the mail and express cars from the
rest of the train.
In the darkness the bandit failed to
note that the first car Tvas the mail,
while the second was the baggage,
and that the express car, which con
tained the desired booty, was third in
the train. Perrin saw his mistake and,
quickly taking advantage of it, in
spite of the menacing revolver held
close to his head, cut off the mail and
baggage cars, leaving the express car
attached to the dead train.
The robbers then left the engineer
and fireman with the train and board
ed the locomotive and themselves ran
it several miles east, where they
brought it to a stop, rifled the mail
car, then again boarded the engine,
uncoupling it from the cars, and pro
ceeded three miles to Mead. There a
rig was awaiting them and they made
their escape.
CALLS IT LUST OF BLOOD
Colorado Official Condemns Presi
dent's African Trip.
Denver, Dec. 11.Secretary B. W.
Whitehead of the state bureau of
child and animal protection, in an
article printed in the monthly publi
cation of the Colorado Humane soci
ety, entitled "Protect the Deer," says
"President Roosevelt as a sportsman
is furnishing to the American nation
an example of ruthlessness and blood
lust as farreaching as it is pernic-
ious." Continuing, the article says:
"No one more deeply and sincere
ly appreciates the merit and good
qualities of our president than we do,
but these vacation trips of his are not
worthy of a president nor of the true
American man. Many of his truest
admirers, regret his heralded hunting
trip in Africa. It is not necessary, it
cannot reflect credit upon him, he
runs little risk and if there is any it
is a needless one in an unworthy
cause. If reports are true he looks
forward eagerly, exultantly, impa
tiently to the excursion to the other
side of the world whose prime object
is to slay. We regret the lust of
blood, the thirst to slay."
First Appropriation Bill.
Washington, Dec. 11.The legisla

tion bill was reported to the house
from the committee on appropriations
by Representative Bingham of Penn
sylvania. It carries $31,667,820, which
is $816,259 less than the estimates
asked for and $34,876 more than ap
propriated in the legislative bill for
the current fiscal year.

ACCUSES LILLE*
OF ILLEGAL ACTS
Complaint Against Governor
Elect of Connecticut
SERVED WITH SUBPOENA
Called on to Answer the Allegation of
Distributing Money for Campaign
Purposes Through Saloonkeepers
and Others in Violation of the Cor
rupt Practices Act Recently Enacted
In That State.
New Haven, Conn., Dec. 11.Repre-
sentative George W. Lilley, governor
elect of Connecticut, has been served
with a subpoena to answer the com
plaint that in the recent ante election
campaign he himself, or through a
financial agent, violated the corrupt,
practices act passed by the general
assembly four years ago. The com
plaint, which is made by George L.
Fox of this city, who drafted the cor
rupt practices law, enumerates alleged
acts of Mr. Lilley or his agent, Colo
nel I. M. Ullman, in distributing
money for campaign purposes through
certain saloonkeepers in Waterbury
for the purpose of treating electors on
the day of election and of placing cer
tain sums with certain individuals in
GEORGE L. LILLEY.
social clubs for "treating" purposes.
The complaint further alleges that
the sworn statement of Mr Lalley's
expenses do not set forth the expen
ditures alleged as being illegal and
that there were other acts by either
Mr. Lilley or Colonel Ullman which
were contrary to law.
Mr. Lilley's statement of expenses
filed under the corrupt practices act
showed that he spent over $23,000 b}
financial agents to be elected gov
ernor. His Democratic opponent,
Judge A. Heaton Robertson, swore to
having spent $33,000 in his campaign,
while the anti-Lilley Republicans
spent $15,000.
Detectives who were employed by
Mr. Fox claim to have secured evi
dence of alleged illegal practices in
this city, Waterbury and elsewhere.
Congressman Lilley has declined to
comment upon the action brought
against him except to say: "So far
as I know there is nothing to it"
OBJECT TO PORTION
OF LAST MESSAGE
Suggested Congress Expunge
Matter From Record.
Washington, Dec. 11.Leaders of
the senate and house were in confer
ence in Speaker Cannon's room to
consider what action, if any, shall be
taken concerning that portion of Pres
ident Roosevelt's annual message
Which relates to the secret service.
Among those present were Senators
Hale and Aldrich, Speaker Cannon
and Representatives Tawney and Per
kins. The last named has prepared a
resolution providing for the appoint
ment of a select committee of the
house to consider that part of the
president's message regarded as of
fensive to members of congress. The
question of expunging from the con
gressional record all of the alleged
offensive matter has been suggested.
The portion of .he message object
ed to declares that the amendment in
corporated in the law last year "that
there Should be no detail from the
secret service and no transfer there
from" contained the assertion that
this amendment had been of benefit
only to the criminal classes.
Again, the president said that the
chief argument in favor of the pro
vision was that the congressmen did
not themselves wish to be investi
gated by the secret service men and
he proposed a restoration of the old
law, with a special exception prohibit
ing the use of the secret service force

bEFERS TO HILL INCIDENT
Speaker in Reichstag Lauds Amsr
S ican Ambassador.
Berlin, Dec. 11.Speaking the
reichstag Herr Haugsmann, Radical,
made reference to the incidents that
preceded the coming to Berlin of Da
vid J. Hill, the present American
ambassador. He said:
"We rejoice that Mr. Hill has been
appointed ambassador by the United
States and that he has remained here.
We dare cherish the hope that the
reception which he, as an eminent and
intellectual personality, deserved ana
found In Berlin will serve to prove to
him and the United States that the
incidents prior to his coming were
based on a misunderstanding in which
the German people did not share, but
which caused the impression that only
millionaires are acceptable at Berlin
as representatives of a great state.
This may be true of St. Petersburg,
but in Berlin, as a counter balance to
the materialistic conception often con
nected with the dollar, we must insist
that it is the intellectual pre-eminence
of a foreign representative which not
only gives him right to such a posi
tion, but guarantees an interchange
between the two powers much more
useful than can be had by the spread
ing of the most lavish banquets."
DAVIS IS ACQUITTED
ON MURDER CHARGE
Declared Not Guilty ot Killing
Dr. Rustin.
Omaha, Dec. 11.After thirteen
hours' deliberation the jury in the
case of Charles E. Davis, charged
with the murder on the morning of
Sept. 2 of Dr. Frederick T. Rustin,
agreed upon a verdict of not guilty.
Judge Sears received the verdict and
ordered the discharge of the prisoner.
It required nineteen ballots to reach
an agreement. The first ballot stood
eleven to one for acquittal of the
charge of murder in the first degree.
The lone juror maintained his posi
tion for four ballots and after that
was joined by another in voting for
conviction on a lesser charge.
This case has attracted unusual at
tention not only on account of the
prominence of the victim of the kill
ing, who was one of the leading physi
cians and surgeons of the city, and
the mvstery surrounding the tragedy,
but because of the family connections
of the defendant. Although himself
holding but a minor position in the
First National bank Davis is the
brother of the vice president and
uncle of the president, cashier and
other officials of that institution and
is related to men prominent in finan
cial affairs in New York city.
It is not believed that any further
prosecutions will be undertaken in
connection with the killing of Dr.
Rustin unless unexpected evidence
should be discovered.
Dies After Week's Sleep.
Logansport, Ind., Dec. 11.After be
ing asleep exactly one week Peter
Snyder, a farmer living near here, is
dead. A week ago he worked all day
husking corn and retired rather early.
He did not arise the next morning at
his usual time and his wife was un
able to.rouse him. Physicians were
called, but their efforts failed to
awaken him. They are greatly puz
zled over the case.

if _, The efficacy of Prayer.
Among my esteemed neighbors there
Is a family known for the piety of its
members and their implicit confidence
In the efficacy of prayer. One of the
daughters, Miss Kate B., has almost
reached the age when she could be re
ferred to ungallantiy as an old maid.
She is the target for many a good na
tured quip pertaining to her alleged
hopes and endeavors in the direction
of matrimony.
Not long ago a certain society of
young men which had interested itself
in a campaign for higher saloon license
sent a committee to visit the homes of
the district and obtain signatures to a
high license petition. When this com
mittee, numbering half a dozen mem
bers, ascended the front steps at the
B. home my friend's wife was the first
to see it through the-front window.
"Laws, JohnP she exclaimed to her
husband. "See all those young men
coming to visit us."
Mr. B. glanced out of the window,
noted the number of the invading force
and remarked, with an air of convic

LIFE ISN'T WORTH LIVING
This Statement May Be Generally
Attributed to the Lack of Good
Health.
We want to talk to people who
are nervous, who suffer frequent
headaches, who don't enjoy their
food, who are irritable, quickly
lose their temper, are so tired and
worn out that they feel that they
must give up, and have become
so despondent that life doesn't
seem worth living. We know
exactly what is the matter with
people in this condition, and if
they will follow our advice, we can
tell them how to regain good health
and that buoyancy of feeling which
makes life seem all sunshine and
happiness.
Most of the described conditions
are chiefly caused by catarrhal
inflammation of the mucous mem
branes. The delicate, web-like
lining of the body becomes in
flamed and congested until weak
ness and mental depression fol
lows. The only way this pain can
be overcome is through a treat
ment of the blood. We have the
treatment, and we are so positive
that it will produce the results we
claim for it that we will supply it
to anyone with the understanding
that we will return to them every
penny they paid us in every in
stance where the treatment is not
in every way satisfactory and bene
ficial to them.
We want you to try Rexall
Mucu-Tone, which is a powerful
nutritive tonic and body builder,
and a mucous membrane alterative
that cleanses these membranes and
restores their natural and healthy
functions.
Rexall Mucu-Tone drives out all
the catarrhal poison, restores the
mucous cells to good health, tones
up the whole system, allays inflam
mation, removes congestion, and
stimulates the whole system to
healthy activity. It is splendid
for building up flesh and muscle
tissue and removing all weaknes
ses.
Come to our store today and get
a bottle of Mucu-Tone, and after
giving it reasonable trial, if you
are not satisfied simply tell us so,
and we will hand back your money
without question. Surely, nothing
could be more fair than this. Two
