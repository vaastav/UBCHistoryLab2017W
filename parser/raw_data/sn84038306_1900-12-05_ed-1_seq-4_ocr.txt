Imperialism Old And New.
Sir, we are told that this country can
do anything, Constitution or no Con
stitution. We are a great people,—
great in war, great in peace,—but we
•re not greater than the people who
once conquered the world, not with
Jong range guns and steel-clad ships,
but with the short Bword of the Roman
legion and the wooden galleyB that
Bailed across the Adriatic. The colonial
system destroyed all hope of republican
ism in the olden time. It is an appan
age of monarchy. It can
exiBt
I know not what may be done with
the glamor of foreign conquest and
the greed of the commercial and money
making classes in this country. For
myself, I'would rather quit public life
•nd would be willing to risk life itself
rather than give my consent to this fan
tastic and wicked attempt to revolu
tionize our Government and substitute
the principles of our hereditary enemies
for the teachings of Washington and
his associates.—From a speech in the
United States Senate, December 12th,
1886...
vasion of Cigarette Tax, Duplicity
of Tobacco Trust.
The legislature of Iowa imposed a
tax of $300 per annnm upon all persons
telling cigarettes or cigarette paper in
the State and made it a criminal offence
to sell such articles without having
first paid the tax.
A federal court decided that a state
had no right to Impose such a tax, fol
lowing the "original package" decisions
of which we heard so much in prohibi
tlon times. An appeal was taken to
the United States Supreme Court, and
pending a determination of the ciga
rette law in that tribunal the tobacco
trust, known as the American Tobacco
Co., undertook to indemnify ail their
customers against loss or damage aria
tag in any way out of the Bale of ciga
rettes, cigarette paper or wrappers in vi
olation of the laws of the state. Deal
ers who consulted lawyers were un
doubtedly told that a bond to indemni
fy against loss arising out of a viola
tion of a'criminal statute was against
public policy and could not be enforced.
Many dealers, however, relied upon the
trait's promises of protect"oa and ciga
rettes have been sold In nearly every
town in tho state in direct violation of
the statute on the subject.
A few weeks ago the United States
Supreme Court got around to the ciga
litte case, and held that the several
states had the power to regulate or pro
hibit the sale of cigarettes in any and
all kinds ot packages. Now there is a
general scramble on the part of the late
vendors of these goods to find out about
the validity of their contracts of indem
nity. They will probably be told by a
kind mannered representative of the
tobacco trust that, the contracts art£(n-
Tilld because they tare entered into
for the purpose of inducing persons to
do unlawful acts. That is good law
and the trust undoubtedly relied upon
It as a complete shield from liability.
Bnt we have some more law here in
Iowa that may not be so well known to
the trnBt officials. Our courts may
hold that money paid for articles to be
sold in violation of the laws of Iowa,
can be recovered back at the suit of the
party or parties paying it.
If the trust deserts the dealers and
repudiates its contracts, the dealers of
the state may assemble the amounts
paid by them for goods since the pass
•geof the cigarette law and bring a
suit against the trust for the recovery
of the entire sum.
Post Election Musings,
I do wonder if they are going to give
our distinguished hero, Yviliiam Jenn
ings Bryan, a little rest finally, since the
people have spoken, and the popular
will is now known, but no matter if
frivolous people do laugh at his defeat
and wonder at his audacity aud
stick-tO'itiveness about the candi
dacy for president. They forget per
hspi that the great Btitesmin, James G.
Blaine, was three times balloted for as
presidential candidate. They have
•lso forgotten about Aaron Burr ol'
loag ago, who came ne trer to the Presi
dency without reaching it. than any
other man save Tilden, who in 1870, ac
cepted tha loss of
tho
presidency
With perfect couiprjs ire. If ho had
personal disappointments or nourished
presentment, no one knew It, and he
spent his l«t yeira in peace and seren
ity surrounded by books, and by men
of the highest cultivation in his beauti
ful little home which he bought on tliu
Hudson dividing (lis time between that
•nd his city home inGramercy park, aud
I noticed from a news paper not long
since that whoever joins the list
of
feated presidents is in distinguished
company, for some of America's great
est names are on the list, names that
will live long after the men who were
successful over them have been forgott
en, such names as Henry Clay, Stephen
A. Douglas, Horatio Seymore, Horace
Greeley and othars who have left a
more lasting Impress on their country's
polities and- history than some men
who have been presidents.

public welfare, and of course one must

In these degenerate days one would

It all seems to me to be a one sided
affair when it ought to be remembered
that opposition is afield for achieve
ment and in it Gladstone and other dis
tinguished men have won their laurels.
In my opinion Bryan's policy is right,
and if I were a man I should support
him in sunshine and in storm because
he represents the best aspirants of this
great nation and because I would have
a perfect right to support him as we
are an independent people, and every
one of us have aright to our own opin

Barnd-Glevelaad.
Austin Cleveland and Miss Carrie E.
Barnd both of Manchester, were marr
ied by ustice Kearney, at 2.30 o'clock
this afternoon [Wednesday, November
28th], The ceremony was performed
in the squire's ollice in the presence of
a few of the friends of the contracting

happened into the office while the mar

The couple were unattended and at
the conclusion of the ceremony Mr. and
Mrs. Cleveland left on the Clipper for
Manchester, where they will be tender
ered a reception at the home of the
bride's parentB tonight.
The groom is proprietor of the lead

of the place. The bride is a charming
young woman who IB admired by a

Entre Nous Thanksgiving Dance.
The Thanksgiving bail at Pythian
Castle was ^attended by about fifty
couples, the Entre Nous club member
ship being increased for this holiday
dance by the addition of a number of
our college students who were home for
the weeks vacation.
The music for the occasion was very
good considering the late date it was
arranged for which gave the players no
time in which to prepare, and left them
much at a disadvantage. The floor was
like glass and its very smoothness added
(,'reatly to the pleasure of tho dancers,
the big lodge room and the dining room
both being ulalized for the tripping of
the light fantastic. A supper was
served at midnight at the Lawler Res
taurant ou Frauklin street after which
for the nonce dancing was resumed
until about half past one.
A vote was taken by the male portion
of the Entre Nous, and from this time
henceforth daucing will commence
promptly at eight and end at twelve
o'clock, a very commendable resolution
indeed.
The general verdict of members and
quests at this pleasurable evening was
iliac the first meeting for the season of
liie Eutre Nous was decidedly a social

'•*. William Beeder.
It was with feeling of sorrow and of
personal IOSB that thn word was passed
that Mr. Wm. Reeder was no more,
lie has resided in Delaware county
Bince
1854 and has been one of the beet
and highly respected citizens of our
county. His circle of friends was only
limited by his acquaintance. For a
long time past Mr. Beeder has been in
poor health and his death was not un
expected at any time but by his robust
constitution in his younger days he was
able to throw off disease and postpone
death for along time after most const!
tutions would have been compelled to
succumb.
He was born in Kettlestone, England,
February 27,1812, and was married to
Jane IiarriBon in 1837, afterwards sett
ing in New York state. They came
to Delaware county in 1854, living in
North Fork until 1876 when they moved
to Earl ville where they have since resid

union, six of whom are still living and
left to mourn his death. They are 3 ameB

He and his wife belonged to the WeB

for the future and after along life well
spent he goes to receive his reward, his
wife having preceded him about a

Fryc expects to get up the shipping

that day then on Wednesday, and in
doing this to have the Spooner Philip

ginning of the important work of the
session, and upon the success or fail
ure of the scheme may depend much
of the future course of proceedings
for the entire session. In order to ac
complish this result It will be neces
sary first to get the consent of the Re

committee will be held after the ad
journment of the senate this afternoon.

on foot now to secure the assent of the
committee on foreign relations to the
abandoment of the Davis amendment,
for the fortification of the proposed,
canal. The usual custom of adjourn

of the session probably will be de
parted from this sesBlon. That is the
desire of the Republican leaders now
here, and they say there probably wilt
be no such adjournment this week.

The following is the
SPEAKER HENDERSON.
ers of the house are preparing to press:
with great vigor the important busi
ness of the short session. Already con
siderable preliminary committee work:
has been done on the important meas
ures—the bill for the reduction of the
war revenue taxes, the army reorgan
ization bill, the river aud harbor bill
and several of the appropriation bills—
and the legislative mill will start un
der a full head of steam. The army
reorganization bill Is considered to be
particularly urgent, owing to the possi
bility of Its leetlng strenuous opposi
tion after it reaches the senate, and it
Is the Intention of the leaders to get It
ont of the way at the earliest posslbzle
moment.
The Democrats will caucus on the
army bill today, and the Indications
now are that they will offer aB a sub
stitute for the permanent reorganiza
tion measure a bill extending tor two
or three years the present law for a
provisional army. The bill to reduce
the war revenue taxes has been prac
tically completed by the Republican
members of the ways nnd means com
mittee, and it will be submitted to
the full committee tomorrow, unless
in the meantime a caucus of tbe Re
publicans should be found to be ad
visable. •ionic of the Republican mem
bers are not satisfied with the list of
articles relieved of taxation by tbe bill,
nnd if too much opposition becomes evi
dent the leaders probably will call a
conference or caucus for the purpose
of adjusting and harmonizing differ
ences.
On Thursday the Grout oleomargar
ine bill will come up as a special or
der under a rule made at tbe last ses
sion. It Imposes a tax of ten cents a

Dutch Sentiment.
Berlin, Dec. 3. Kruger has aban
doned his proposed visit to Berlin,
owing to the receipt of an official In
timation that Emperor William re
grets that in consequence of previous
arrangements be will be unable to re
ceive him. The Boer statesman will
therefore proceed direct from Cologne
for Holland. He telegraphed to this
effect Saturday afternoon. The emper
or's Intimation was conveyed to Mr.
Kruger by the German envoy at Lux
embourg, who arrived at Cologne yes
terday. The Cologne Gazette, in
an inspired communique, says:
"Mr. Kruger's visit Is no1! agree
able to Germany, his aim be
ing to obtain intervention in South
Africa.' It would be a grave political
mistake—it would be even a great
crime—to allow him to entertain even
a spark of hope that Germany will
render him any practical support."
This declaration is accompanied with
reproaches, Kruger being charged with
having "encouraged a useless guerilla
warfare and disregarded Gemany's ad
vice when he might have still followed
It." The press generally strikes the
same note.
And the Hoert Got Away.
Bloemfonteln, Dec. 3.—Further de
tails have been received regarding the

British under General Paget and the
Boers under Commandants Viljoen

eral Paget, toward evening on the sec
ond day, closed. In upon the Boer po
sition with the Intention of attacking
next day at dawn. The Boers, how
ever, with reinforcements, Including
three guns, made a desperate attack
and severe fighting ensued. The Bores,
who were repulsed with heavy loss,
withdrew In a northeasterly direction.
General Paget having occupied their
position sent mounted infantry in
pursuit. The New Zealanders dis
played great gallantry, losing five out
of six officers wounded.

Cape Town, Dec. 3.—Replying at
Stellenborch, Cape, Colony, to an ad
dress presented to him by the leaders
of tbe Afrlkanderbund, J. X. Merrl
man, former treasurer of Oape Colony,
In the course of an impassioned speech,
denounced the war In South Africa as
"one of tbe blackest spots in British
annals." The present methods of
British warfare, he said, were such as
encouraged the worst elements on both
sides, and were bound to prove fatal
to the ultimate peace of the country.
I. W. Sauel- made a speech which was
rather more militant: demanded the
removal of Sir Alfred Milner, whom
he described ns "violently anti-Dutch,"
aud declared that if Great Britain de

Cologne. Dec. 3.—Thousands of peo
ple waited yesterday in the vicinity of
the Cathedral hotel to catch a glimpse
of Kruger, who, when replying to a de
putation of Bonn students In the aft
ernoon, described the educational pro
gress of the Transvaal, thanked the
students for their kind welcome, and
shook hands with each. Afterward he
appeared upon the balcony, where he
was loudly cheered from below. Hav
ing rested for half an hour he went
Into the vestibule of the hotel, "which
was crowded with visitors. Here, re
plying to a deputation from the Pan
German league wishing him success,
he referred to the close relationship be
tween the Boers and the Germans. He
will remain here probably until
Wednesday.
He left Paris Saturdny at 1:40 p.
m„ and his Journey through, northern
France was attended by scenes similar
to those witnessed at Marseilles and
Paris. At nearly every station crowds
had gathered which waved hats and
handkerchiefs and cheered the train
as it whirled along. At Charlerol, the
first stop on Belgian territory, rigor
ous police measures had been taken to
prevent the Invasion of the station, but
the people were stronger-than the po
lice and rushed on the platform and'
gave vent to their feelings in cries
favorable to the Boers. This was the
cause also at Mnmur, Liege and when
he arrived here, where the welcome
was entirely unofficial.

Manila, Dec. 3.—Sunday In Vlgan
was a great day for the American
cause. Twenty-two hundred natives
of the region,
nearly
all fighting reb­
els, crowded the church and took the
oath of allegiance to the United States.
The oath was administered by tbe
priest. All but 500 of those sworn
were bolomen. Tbe number included
the 1,200 bolomen who had previously
surrendered.
The proceedings In the church oc
cupied the eutlre day, and included an
address by General Young and an ex
hortation by the priest. Scarcely any
rebels remain in the vicinity of Santa
Maria. General Young attributes this
fact to three causes—the re-election of
President McKinley, the arrival of a
stronger boi'y of troops, and the es
pecially rigid enforcement of war
measures, and the deportation of pris
oners to Manila. He reports that It is
necessary to occupy ail the barriers
in order to protect tbe natives from
the vangeance of Tagalog raiders.

New York, Nov. 30.—Advices have
been received here from Manila that
the Island of Guam was visited by a
terrific typhoon on NOT. 13, which

Island with amazing rapidity. The
United States auxiliary cruiser Yosem
lte, which was anchored adjacent to
the collier Justin, dragged her anchor
and was driven aground a hundred
and fifty yards from the reef, her
bows being crushed in.
A launch with a crew of five men
had previously left the ship to en
deavor to lind a safe anchorage for
the vessel, the indications being that
the anchors would not hold where she
was. The men were not seen after
they left the ship and It is practically
certain that the heavy sea which the
storm kicked up swamped the launch.
The bodies of Coxswain F. Swnnson
and Seaman George Anliel were re
covered after the typhoon subsided. 1
The storm veered around after the
Yosemite grounded, and she was
driven off and carried to the Somaye
cliffs, where her rudder and pro
peller were broken.
After the violence of the storm had
subsided efforts were made to start the
engines. They were finally got to work,
and the Yosemite, with her damaged
propeller, struggled landward at the
rate of two knots an hour. The water
kept gaining in the hold and the ship
was gradually sinking. At 1:30 p. m.,
Nov. 15, the Justin, which had started
in search of the Yosemite, picked her
up and attempted to tow. her back to
Guam. Two hawsers were broken, and
it was then decided that it was impos
sible to take her into port. The
cruiser was then scuttled, after which
she was abandoned, all hands going
aboard the Justin. The Yosemite sank
bow first at 3 o'clock, and the Justin
stood away for Guam. Paymaster
Ballard saved $68,000 Mexican money
from the sinking ship.

deaths. The cocoanut crops were
rendered absolutely worthless, and
the vegetation of the Island killed by
salt water. The storm came up in

Catastrophe at Paelflo Glau Work* Clalma
18 Dead and 8tf Injured.
San Francisco, Dec. 8.—Develop
ments which have followed the trag
edy attending the intercollegiate foot
ball game In this city have not tend
ed to ameliorate the horror occasioned
by tbe collapse of tbe roof of the San
Francisco and Pacific glass works. At
present the net result is eighteen dead
and eighty Injured. Many of the lat
ter will either die from the effects of
their hurts or be crippled and scarred
as long as they live.
It was one of the most distressing
catastrophes in local history and its
horrible record is not yet fully appre
ciated. Bach additional detail serves
to augment the horror. The unfortu
nates who went down to death or less
serious damage were assembled upon
a ventilator that formed the ridge of
the roof when the Crash occurred. For
ty feet below them were ovens in
which glass was baking and upon the
tops of these white-hot furnaces many
of the unfortunates fell. Those who
were able to crawl or to roll off did
so, but those who were stunned or
crippled by the fall lay there and
were literally roasted.
