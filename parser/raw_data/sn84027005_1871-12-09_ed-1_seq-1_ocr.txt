TUE FINANCES, OE SOUTH CAEOLINA..- .
The New York Daily Bulletin-a com?
mercial journal of high standing-in 1
publishing the report of the committee 1
of citizens, who recently "examined the '
books of the State Treasurer, at Colum?
bia, ss far as practicable," says:
' -'WoBhall not venture to prejudge the
accounts of tbe Financial Agent; but '
that ho should control such nu enormous j
amount of bonds, and that nothing,
should be known at the State Treasury
respecting the naturo of his operations,
the condition of his accounts, or tho ex t!
tent to which he has involved the credit I
pf the State, is a mutter which, to say (
tho least, demands the promptest remo-li
dy. Mr. Kimpton's promised statement I1
should not bo delayed ono day; nor do"
we Bee why it ueed be; and it is due to
himself that he should invite, at once, BP
full examination of his accounts by par- \
ties who would command public conti-!
dence.
The public very properly ask, how is',
it that the State authorities know, or !
profess to know, so little of tho opora !
lions of tho New York agency, wheu alb
tho debt operations have been conducted j4
through it? There is cither gross uo-jj
gleet or something worse in this appa?
rent ignorance; aud the publio can only!1,
be expected to discredit the Statei
officials until the mystery is cleared upi',
and everything told. If people distrust ?
the Government, and, as Governor Scott '
complains, tbo prim has protested and '
tbe peoplo have begun to mutter the|
foul word "repudiation," what wonder, 4
; when the most extraordinary irregulari-^
ties aro wrapt up in profound secrecy?!
Until the Governor gives tbe publio a i1
f?ll and fair statement of everything, he!'
C?n only expect to be distrusted, and all'1
who hold positions of financial trust!'
und?r him.
It appears, from the report of the com-!'
mittee, that tbe Financial Agent has 1
"hypothecated $3,773,000 of bonds, *
ngainst advances amounting to something' !
over 8900,0110; but, ou what aooouut this!!
rooney was borrowed, they fail to show.'
Their report states, relating to a summa-11
ry of the debt, which we give below: Is
"In tbo above statement it will be ob-' '
served that tho sum ofS'203,000, already 1
referred to, has been deduct ed from the!'
estimated debt of 1869; whether iii'
should be so deducted must necessarily r
depend upon tho report of the Financial"
Agent. It is admitted that this amount (
of the debt has baen redeemed, but its''
fitiul position'in the account cannot now'''
be ascertained with certainty."
; WP ?nderatapd this to imply that the'1
pommitteo wns unable to satisfy itself ol'1
tU?'iuo'orrectne*3 of a report current 1
hore that bouds received for redemption,''
orin tbe way of conversions, have been1'
used as collateral for loans. Respecting!'
tho $200,000 held in tho sinking fund,11
fatso deducted from Raid statement oil
debt,) tbe report makes the darkly sog 1
gest j yo remark: I
<?Tbia sum purports to bo on hand for
the retirement of that amount of tho ex?
isting debt. If tho whole of it or any
portion has been ufced, (which can only
appear by tho report of tbo Financial
Agent,) tho amount so used becomes a
portion of the floating debt."
Thus, tho committeo suggest a grave,
doubt that not only hus tho sinking fund!1
boen diverted from its proper use, bat Jj
that retired bonds huvo been redstttled. !
What have tbe State officials to say to'1
these imputations? How long do tbcy!
suppose tho bond-holders and tux-pay-!1
ern will keep their patienco undor the']
dark suspicious thus inevitably sng-!
gested? Their reticence is naturally1!
construed as an evidence of guilt; and .
?et Governor Scott, in au official bullo-1
tin, assumed an air of injured virtue! r
The oommittoo deserve thunks for !
what they bavo done; but sonia explana-'1
tion is required of tbe reasons which !
prevented them from extending their ex?
aminations to tho office of the Financial
Agent, where only they could expect to]
hud tbo information ubont which the!!
publio are most conocrned. j I

TUB PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.-The th i rd
annual message/.of President Grant
opens with a reiteration of the policy
announced in his inaugural message.
"The policy has heoa not to inquire into
the wisdom of the laws already enacted,
hut to learn their spirit and intent, and
to enforce them accordingly"-a senti?
ment which, if literally adhered to,
would preclude tho Executive from mak?
ing many useful recommendations for
the repeal or modification of laws found
to be bud. Tho exceptional calamities
by fire and flood which hare marked the
past year, und which huve led to tho dis?
play of so much active benevolence and
generous sympathy ab homo and abroad,
receive appropriate mention, while the
year is recognized to have been, '.'under
i wiso Providence, one of general pros?
perity to tho nation." , ,
Under the heud of foreign relations,
the couutry is properly congratulated
apon tho beneficial tlleots likely to re?
mit from the treaty of Washington,
both UR u settlement of our differences
with Great Britain, and an un example
to the world bow wars may bo avoided
without a eacrince of national, honor.
Jredit is gives to our diplomatic aud
consular agents nt Paris for the manner
in which they have performed their do
.icato duties without wounding tho sus?
ceptibilities of Freuch or (lennans dur
.ug tho trying scened iu France of thc
past twelve mouths.
Some surprise will doubtless be felt tc
Iud M. Cutaoazy elevated to tho dignity
if a national grievance, and tho puroly
personal, difficulties between that obnox
OUB euvoy und tho administration ni
Washington deemed worthy of a place

Joren, and to tho success achieved b;

"for such adieu us Congress may seo ?

Turning from foreign to " dornest:
kffdirs, the first and most important r<
sommeudation of the inessago is, thi
joth the tani! and internal laws bo m<
lided, with a view to lightening tl
lurdens at-present imposed upou tl
jouutry. It is recom mended that "fi
?axes from internal reven uo sources I
ibolished, except thuse collected fro
ipirituous, vinous and malt liquors, t
jacco iu its various forms, uud fro
itampe," which amounts to a tacit r
lornnieudation to abolish tho income ta
[n any re-adjustment of tho tariff, it
.ecommended that thone articles not pr
luced at horne, but which enter lurge
uto geoeral consumption through mei
jinns, compounds, Sea., aud from whi
ittle revenue is derived, should bo plac
>u the free list, and that "should a ft
.her r?duction bo deemed advisable,
should bo made upon those artic!
which can best bear it without distui
.og home productiou or reducing t
labors of American labor." Thia latt
recommendation hus tho merit of bei
io exceedingly general, that it prohal
will give no offenoo uvou to tho nu
irdent protectionists. For particuh
ipou this hoad, Congress is referred

lury. Tho fluctuations in the cu rr er
ire deplored, and tho wisdom of Ce
jreas ia invoked to find a remedy, whi

rates the condemnation heretofore p
jounced hy tho Secretary of tho Tr
mry upoo the present infamous syst
)f moieties to informers in the revei
iervioe of tho country-a system whi
while condemned iu theory, is said

ipon tho favorable consideration of C

?artmeut continue to improve.
Tho meuaures taken for tho cufo
nout of tho Ku Klux law aro next
viewed. The proclamation of Ootc
17 is justiiitid, upon tho ground that
requirements of tho proclamation of
;ober 12, requiring tho members of
awful combinations, within tivo dav
mrrender "all their arms, ammunit
luiforms, disguises, mid other means
implements used by them for carr;
jut their unlawful purposes-," hud
been complied with, Tho existent
the "unlawful combinations," "
posea," "arms," "uniform" uud "iu
menta" ia taken for grunted. "Ar
or trial in the judicial tribunals of
United States" ia promised tho pa
who have been arrested, ia numbers t
ll und reds, and wo may add, also, 1
conviction, inasmuch ns it is added:
is believed that no innocent peru

innocence, ono would havo .sappi

tribunals." A reign of terror ht
been mungi)rated, tho fact that nun
of persons havo "absconded" is uasi
to bo "good ground for supposing
ill such persons have violated thc lu
The suppression ol polygamy in Utah,
with a provision for tho legitimization oi
"innooent children" np to a certain date,
is suggested-the latter only "ns a sug?
gestion, not a recommendation." The
"peace policy" heretofore adopted by the
administration with reference to the
Indians, (though somewhat varied in
practice by exploits like thoso of the
"Fiegan" massaore,) ia recommended to
be adhered to, "not only because it is
? humane, Christian-like and economical,
I but because it is right."
Political amnesty is recommended,
upon the ground, apparently, that no
good comes from excluding a particular
I class of men from office, beoauso they
had violated their oath to support the
Constitution, while thousands who
would havo done so had they been in the
simo position, aro admitted to bo eligi?
ble. It is added, "If there bo any great
crimiuals distinguished abovo nil ol bor?
for tho part they took in opposition to
the Government, they might, iu the
judgment of Congress, bo excluded from
such amnesty." It is needless to re?
mark that such amnesty would not be
"general,", and that tho vcr}' "excep?
tions" would go far to defeut its effect,
llegret is expressed that tho old citizens
of tbe Southern States should not tnko a
moro prominent part in public affairs,
but tbe causes which binder them from
so doiug seem most imperfectly compro
bended. Tbe wretched misrule of the
carpct-bag governments of those States,
uow upheld by Kn Klux legislation, bus
far mo: a to do with their prescht "un?
happy condition" than any feeling of
personal hostility or "social ostracism"
on tho part of the older iuhabitnnts to?
ward thuBO who differ with them in po?
litical sentiments. Natural causes, such
as climate, Roil and the state of the labor
question, with present mnl-admiuistra
tion, have quito us much to do with re?
tarding "immigration and tho flow of
much-needed capital" into the South, ns
any of tho causes which tho President
enumerates.
In conclusion, Ibo President declares
himself in favor of such civil service re?
form as will visit tho responsibility for
bad appointments upon thoso who re?
commend improper persons for oflWo to
the appointing power. Ile refers to the
commission appointed under tho Act of
Congress of March 31, 1871, to devise
regulations for tho reform of tho civil
service, and promises to give to thc ex?
periment a fair trial.
Taken ns a whole, the message is of
moderato length, eirnplo and uupreten?
tious in its style, rather negativo than
positive in its merits, and certainly less
aggressive in its tonn and recommenda?
tions than might havo been apprehend?
ed, and porhups, by a certain elas-s ol
political extremists and factioniatp, was
desired.-Baltimore Sun.
Gl?EENWOOD AND AUGUSTA RAIM;O.U>
By appointment of au adjourned meet?
ing of tho friends of tho Greenwood and
Augusta Railroad, tho citizens of Abbe?
ville and Edgeiield met at Hillway, on
December 1, and, ou motion of Dr. J.
H. Jennings, Gen. P. II. Bradley was
called to the chair, and Dr. M. C. Tag?
gart requested to act ns Secretary.
Tho Chairman, in a forcible aud prac?
tical manner, peculiar to himself, ex?
plained the object of tho meeting, and
was happily successful in infusing into
tho andience n spirit of unanimity und
determination rarely met with. Abb?
and instructive addresses were also made
by Dr. J. H. Jeuuings, Capt. Jas. Tal
bert, Capt. W. K. Bradley, J. D. Tal?
bert, Esq., and others; and tho cheering
intelligence from delegates from Green?
wood to Augusta, all along tho route, in
cont08tibly proves that our citizens tire
alivo und in sober earnest in regard to
the road. If brains, muscio and money
will build any railroad, theu tho Green?
wood and Augusta Railroad will be
built, and tho subsequent action of the
meeting shows they ure ready to go lo
work now-at once-as soon as a charter
is granted.
Ou motion of J. D. Talbert, E-q., Hie
following resolutions were unanimously
adopted :
Resolved, That a committee of twelve
bo appointed, who shall adopt such mea?
sures as may bo necessary to seenru u
charter for a railroad, to ba known as tho
Greenwood and Augusta Railroad.
Resolved, That said committee bo au?
thorized to have au immediato survey
made and published.
Resolved, That said committee bo em?
powered to raise, by subscription, au
amount of money sutficicnt to have .said
survey m do along the proposed route,
and for such other purposes ns, by said
committee, may be deemed advisable.
Resolved. That certif?cales bo issued
by tho committee to individuals who
subscribo for this object, and that the
amounts subscribed by them bo consi?
dered as so much stock in the said rail?
road.
Under tho first resolution, the follow?
ing gentlemen wero nppoiuted ns said
committee of twelve: Dr. J. ll. Jen?
nings, Gen. P. TI. Bradley, J. D. Tal?
bert, Esq., A. M. Aiken, Dr. N. Merri
wetbor, S. P. Boozer, C. L. Blair, Maj.
J. L. White, W. Ii. Parks, Dr. J. D.
Neill, J. G. Sheppard and Capt. W. li.
Bradley.
On motion of Dr. J. Ii. Jennings,
Resolved, That tho following citizens
of Augusta, Go., be appointed lo co-ope
rato with tho committee from S ?nth
Carolina, to secure II charter for Ibo
Greenwood and Augusta Railroad, Viz:
Hon. R. H. May, Dr. Tho?. Pliiuizy,

Moved by Capt. Jas. Talbert, that four
of thc committee of twelve, constitute a i
quorum to transact business.

' Tho Courter, of Charleston, says that:
Mr. jiioipton is tho appointee, auder
the Act of August 26, 1668, of Governor
Scott, Mr. Attorney-General Chamber?
lain and Mr; Treasurer Parker. The
Act says'trie1 "Governor, Attorney-Gen
oral^nnd tho Treasurer, aro heroby au?
thorized to appoint, under n commission
signed by them, somo:'responsible bank
or broker .in "'tho city of New York, to
act as Financial Agent of tho State, to
bo subject ?0 their direction and con?
trol." They accepted Mr. Kimptou
without'security. Ho was, under tho
very express terms of tho law, to bo sub?
ject to their direction aud control. They
cannot, theroforo, either allego igaoranco
of his acts, or disavow the responsibility
which they thus assumed. Another
fuct is, that under tho law no bond or
obligation could bo issued without the
signature of tho Govoruor, the seal of
State, und countersigned by tho Trea?
surer. Tho whole finances of tho State
wero thtis committed to the Financial
Board and tho Financial Agent. To
them tho trust was committed. Upon
them, tho responsibility rested. They
aro now mutually arraigned beforo the
bar of public opinion, to answer and ac?
count for the frauds, which, under their
nu me und authority, have been commit?
ted, Tliero ure but two alternatives.
They have either ueglcctcd or betrayed
their trust ;. Upon thom, to au injured
aud defrauded peoplo, a responsibility
rests, which they can neither evade or
escape, and for which they must finally
account at tho bar of public opiuiou.
And also says thal :
Mr. Chamberlain, in his published
speech, (before us,) nt Chester, in Au?
gust, 1870, assorted tho whole public
debt to bo but $0,183,349.17. Ho spoke
as ono of tho Financial Board. But a
little over ii year has transpired siuce,
and it is now admitted to bu uear 810,
000,000-while tho Investigating Com
mitten muka it over 820,000,000. Mr.
Chamberlain then asserted-to uso hil
own words-that "only $700,000 had
hecu added io tho publia debt of th?
State since July, 1?S08." We know non
that Gov. Scott and his Administratiot
has li.id printed of bonds aud stockt
since July, 1808, 522,510,000.
So far ns thu Ijt-gislulure and thi
public are concerned, tho Finaneia
Board und Agent must be held respouei
Ide for tho finances of tho State. It wai
their mission and their duty. They ac
cepted the trust. lu thu face of tin
prescut frauds, all must be held equal!;
accountable. If, with any, the sin shouli
have been of omission und uot of com
mission, then ?ct the truth be franki,
and clearly, stated, and the real perpt
trators bo bri ught to justice.

which lie hus fur some time given a goo

which, if we had uot been prepared ft

would sound very extraordinary. \V

his business on tho sidewalk, aud ou tc

The New York Hatton Bays:
These accounts aro very carious. lu
October, 1870, Parker, thc Treasurer,
gave "au official statement" of the debt
of the State, winch he sets down at
$7,005,903.98. Six weeks later, the
Comptroller-General made a report, in
which he put it at tho same amount ns
Parkor, but, oddly enough, gave u very
different account of its composition. It
now appears that both these statements
were fulse. The tax-payers had iu tho
meantime been getting alarmed, and
held a convention io May, 1871, of which
wo gave some account in the Nation, and
thoy, sent a deputation to soo the Comp?
troller, who repeated his falsehood of
the previous December. Four mo TI th s
later, in September, 1871, Gov. Scott
tried his hand at giving the amount of
the State debt before the Congressional
Ku Klux Committee, and ho mado it out
in all 89,523,504.10, which it now ap?
pears was the greatest falsehood of all,
for he must have known, and knew,
that, besides this, Kimpton had then re?
ceived and pledged bonds to the amount
of over $5.000,000. Next, Parker and
Kimpton spent a day over the books,

Few people complaining of life's mis
fortunen, aro aware of how much better
ul! they are thau many of their fellow
beings. When they learn, as they readi?
ly cnn from the last census returns, that
thero are in this country alone 20,320
blind people, 37,582 insane, 24,527 idi?
otic, aud 15,822 peoplo deaf and dumb,
to say nothing of the unnumbered hosts
of peoplo suffering under minor afflic?
tions, health and souud faculties will
perhaps be botter esteemed. Frightful
as this list appears, it is yet worthy of
note, comparing much more favorably iu
proportion to population than that of
any other country on the face of the
earth, civilized or barbarous.
SiNouiiAii CAUSE OK DEATH.-The Bos?
ton Traveller, of November 28, says:
Mr. E. C. Chambers, the Park street
station agent of the Medford branch of
the Boston and Maine Railroad, met
with his death in a very singular way,
some days since. His little daughter
was sick with the diptheria and he put
his baud on her mouth for some purpose
or other, and tho child seized upon his
hand and bit it. The marks of the
teeth were very slight, comparatively,
tho skill was broken slightly, and tho
poison from thu teeth was transmitted
through Mr. Chamber's system, and
after a week's illness, during which time
his body became much swollen, be died.

..THE TWEEDS OF THE SOUTH."-The
Buffalo (N. Y.) Courier, in an editorial
blaring the above caption, save.
"A Western Republican journal makes'
the observation that three years of Rad
ioal legislation in a Southern State, is a
calamity equal to a Chicago fire. This
proposition is borue out by an exhibit
which the New York IVibune has just
given of the condition to which the1
wretched Slate of Sooth Carolina has
boon reduced by its Radical despoilers/'
Here follows an extract from the edi?
torial of the New York Tribune, which
appeared in our columna on Saturday
last. The editor of the Buffalo Courier
O in ti uu ea thus: .
.'We feel safe in predicting that no
punishment whatever, except such as a
righteous Heaveu may elect to send, will
ever reach these thieves. Their party
will cover their tracks, and deprecate
suoh talk as the Tribune holds as 'dis?
loyal,' aud will pooh-pooh every honeti
statement of their rascalities in time to
come, just an it has been doing for eix
years past. Moreover, when the people
of South Carolina make their next des?
perate effort to esoapo from the clutohes
of the Radical bauditti, the whole North
will bo told that it is the outbreak of a
new rebellion, and Federal troops will
be sent to take care of tho polls and put
down 'Ku Klux.' It needed only the
exertion of her regal will for a single day
to free Now York city from har brigands,
but some of the Southern States have
been struggling in the clutch of far
more desperate thieves for years, and
still struggle in vain. Thu worse than
Tammany thieves who havo made six
Southern States baukrupt, and the sum of
whose robberies ia estimated at $250,000,
000, have been, and still are, auatained
by the whole moral power of the Repub?
lican party, and at ueed hy tho military
power of the Federal Gov?-rutneut
"And yet the Republican pres? bus
the impudence to taunt Dem?crata with
having sustained dishonest men in pow
er in New York."
A WHOLESALE MUBDERESS.-One ol
