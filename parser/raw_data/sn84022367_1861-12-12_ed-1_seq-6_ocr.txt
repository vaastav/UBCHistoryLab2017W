THE RUTLAND WEEKLY HERALD; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, I8fil,
fSfce Maud StmUL
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5.
ggrWe fully concur with the Albany
Journal, that one of the worst Pro-Slavery
sheet? in the North is the Boston
Courier. It goes into spasms every time
a proposition to touch a negro during the
war is broached. It lives in constant ag
ony lest in some manner or other the
" Peculiar Institution " should be bruised
in the conflict. It appears to consider it
of more consequence that four mil-ions of
human beings should be held in londage
than that the Union should be preserved.
We do not envy such a spirit. It re
flects no credit either upon the head or
heart of a Northern man. We do not
desire to see the war assume the form of
an abolition crusade ; but we d desire to
eee Slavery " let severely alone." We
would not assail it as such ; but we would
let it take care of itself. We would not
deny it a single constitutional right ; but
we would hedge it about by no special
sanctities. We wonld make no assaults
upon it as long as it kept its place ; but
we would lurnish it with no body guard
to shield it against the accidents of war.
Through all our ranks, the watchword
should be : " We march against Treason
and let Slavery take care of itself !"
This is the only true doctrine this is the
only creed worthy Northern patriots. To
go beyond this would be to provoke
vet fiercer and deadlier elements of strife;
to stop short of this would be to turn an
annv of Freeman into a pack of slave
catctiers. The Courier hangs on to the
latter horn of the dilemma. Let it hang.
It will find but a sorry squad of followers
cf its degrading creed.

All A'ermont troops now in the service
of the United States, including the Sharp
Shooters, Col. l'latt's Cavalry Kegiment,
and Col. Thomas' Regiment, are entitled
to 87 per month only from this State.
The ST per month pay begins in all ca
ses from the date of mustering into the
service of the United States.
Appointment. John Howe, dr., Esq.,
of Brandon, has been appointed by the
Governor, agent to superintend the suj
plies to be furnished to the families of
Vermont soldiers. A man letter fitted

i i
but the natural consequence of the pre- j
mature advance of our brave but jndisci
plined troop. , which the impatience of the
country d inanded. The betrayal also of
our movenjient by traitors in ou midst
enabled the rebels to choose and intrench
their position, and by a reinforcement in

The Seventh Regiment. The re
cruiting for this regiment is now progress
ing. It is understood that it will go into
camp at Rutland as soon as the ranks are
filled. Lieut. Roberts of the Rutland
Light Guard, is to be Colonel. Steps are
about being taken to fit up barracks in Flo
ral Hall and others of the numerous sub
stantial buildings on our Fair Grounds.
This can be done at little expense,and the
troops will be made entirely comfortable.
Cavalry Regiment. We learn from
Col. Williams, Secretary of Civil and
Military Affairs, that the Cavalry Regi
ment will leave Burlington Saturday

report that they have received and ex
pended two hundred thousand dollars
raised wholly by voluntary contributions.
During the last month they have dis
hursed two thousand dollars per
day, procuring necessaries for inva
lids in the army. Twenty-live inspectors
are employed whose duty it is to ascertain
the necessities of the hospitals.
Senator Lane of Indiana made a
speech in Washington on Wednesday eve
ning in reply to a complimentiu j sere
nade. He predicted that in ten days
there would not be a rebel on the soil of
Kentucky . He declared that the govern
ment had clearly the right to arm the
slaves, but he denounced the measure as
impolitic and unwise in the face ot the
fact that the government could not furnish
arms enough for the while men who ten
dered their services. He thought that to
arm the negroes would be a greater ele
ment of weakness than of strength. These

presented to the Regiment by Gov. Ho!- j declarations were received with, the great
