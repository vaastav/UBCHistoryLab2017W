Col. Johnston's Address.
Below we make some extracts from an Agricul
tural Address delivered at Wadesboro on the 20th
of November, 1879, before the Dixie Agricultural
Society, by Col. Win. Johnston of Charlotte :
In the early historic periods of the world the prin
cipal portion of its inhabitants were shepherds.
They led a pastoral life. The population was then
sparse, the earth yielded abundantly the grasses, and
t his was the easiest mode of comfortable bubsistence.
A pastoral vocation was the first elevation of our
race from a savage condition, in which hunting and
fishing were their chief occupations. Aa they pro
gressed in pastoral pursuits, agriculture as a higher
step in civilization soon came in vogue. Long be
fore Cincinnatus that noblest old Roman farmer
was called twice from the plow to the Dictator
ship of the Empire to save hi country from inter
nal strife and foreign enemies, agiiculture had be
come the leading business of mankind. Its intro
ductions was a great advance upwards in the pro
gress of our race. It brought morals, culture and
civilization with it. From nomadic and wander
ing tribes it located mankind, organized societies,
established government, made laws, encouraged
education and advanced the civilization of the early
ages.
From the pristine days of our race, it ha3 contin
ued to improve and develop the human family
physically, morally and intellectually. It has be
come the vocation of the civilized world. It is the
Hinft (,ua non jf the aire, of organized society, of
government, of civilization. To day it employs the
physical and mental labor of more than half the
civilized world. In the United States it gives labor
and sustenance to two-thirds of all its population,
and in North Carolina it eives labor and employ
ment to probably more than three-fourths of all her
people. It fells the forests, turns up the surface of
the earth and makes it obedient to the wants and
necessities of mankind. It is the only source of
original production and wealth, except that of
mininc? the metals and coals of the earth. It builds
Towns. Cities. States and Governments, and main
tiiins them in neace or war. It digs the Canalsand
constructs the Kail roads. It plows the pathless
waters with itsmenhantile ships and whitens every
Sea and Ocean with their sails. Itbuilds the mighty
naval armadas that lloat on the deep, and maintains
Governments and Empires.
Yet, with all its power and influence, it is the
least aggressive of all the pursuits of mankind. It
makes war upon no other legitimate calling, while
it sustains all. From State or Government it has
never asked undue protection, but is always moved
bv conservative influences. In all aires and coun
tries it has made the leading minds and great and
oiiginal thinkers. On the quiet and secluded farm
men are more tempted to read, think and reason
than in the din of the shop or the hum and stir of
the city. The latter may make more reidy, quick
men, but not so profound. After becoming learned
in art, science, philosophy or U tters, they generally
remove from country to city life, where they can
have greater access to books and apparatus than the
farm affords. Hence a common, erroneous impres
sion that irreat minds are generally born and raised
in cities. The very reverse is true. Ths pursuit of
agriculture not only tends to develop the physical
iiml intellectual man, but to conserve and expand
his moral and virtuous emotions more than that of
any other vocation except that of the educator and
the preacher of "Christ and Him crucified." Hence
the more moral and religious communities are found
in the rural districts. They are reared upon the
farms, and there from early training and associa
tions, led to study books and nature, and discipline
their intellects to become the jrreat reasoners and
thinkers of their age.
Hut do not think I would underrate or depreciate
the importance and value of other pursuits. Mm
ing is the only ther original source of wealth. It
brings from the surface and interior of the earth the
coal. iron, jrold. silver, lead and other valuable min
rials and metals, which in their crude and manu
factured conditions enter into all the economica
purposes of civilized society, and from them im
mense values are created. l hen come the great
manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. They
take the original elements produced by the farmer
and miner and give them immense values and add
immeasurably to the wealth, comfort ond happi
ness of mankind. 1 hen follows the great cominer
rial interest, which gathers together the produc
tions of the farmer, miner and manufacturer and
distributes them throughout the civilized world
and enables all to utalizc and enjoy them accord
ing to their means and tastes. Then come the Min
ister, the Educator, the Doctor, the Lawyer all in
dispensahly necessary to constitute and maintain
organized society and government in its purity
i k-vaiing and enobling influences. Uut of all these
great, vocalious of mankind, agriculture is not only
the peir, but pre-eminent above all, as it virtually
feeds, clothes and maintains all other?.
It is, therefore, meet and proper that our farmers
nhould have their Fairs and Festivals, compare
views ami consult together for further improve
ment and development, which always redounds to
the public gcod. For the first six or eight j'ears
s.f tcr the late war between the States, the high price
of cotton, tobacco and naval stores absorbed the
agricultural mind, energies and resources in the
Southern Stales, the old methods were pursued and
very little progress was made. After the decline in
prices of these leading staples, a new departure had
to be made, old nu t hods to a great degree had to be
abandoned. 1 his has not been without its cones
ponding benefits. Some compensation has been
nalizcd. For in the la&t five years the opinion is
entertained, that we have made more progress in
TSorth Carolina than in anv ten years of our pre
vious history. This is owing in some degree to
deeper plowing, greatly improved agricultural lm
plemeuts and supei ior breeds of horses, cows, sheep
and hogs introduced into the country. In improved
breeds oi cattle L abarrus county probably excel
any portion of the State, while In all the stock of the
farm Mecklenburg will vie with any county in the
htate. in the successful culture of wheat Catawba
leads any other county in North Carolina.- There
are nearly two hundred Drills in the county, with
these, alter thorough preparation of the soil, the
wheat and fertilizers are applied in rows as regular
ana systematically as in cotton planting. Expe
nence has demonstrated that this mode of culture
requires less of seed and manure, and produces
more per acre than the old plan of sowing broad
cast. ithm a few j'ears larger areas have been
sown in the grass. The farmer fiirhts grass all
Spring and Summer in his various crops, yet it is
indispensible to the farm. By grass I include Clover,
Pens, Orchard, Herds and other cultivated grasses
useu ior siock. ah nesh is grass said the wise man
of old. Philosophically it is true. All flesh comes
from vegetable matter. In all the clay formations
it is the basis of all successful farming. What is
soil, that which imparts fertility to the land? It is
the grass and other vegetable matter that grows on
your fields and forests, shades them, retains the
moisture andammonia.and by decomposition.forms
the vegetable loam which makes your crops. With
out grass you cannot successfully raise horses, cows
sneep, uog9 or poultry. It is the cheapest subsis
tcuce for all the farm stock, whether in a green or
cureu siaie, wueiuer you turn it under as a green
crop, use it in the stables or compost it, it is the
uesianu mosi valuable oi all the fertilizers. Noth
ing so effectually absorbs and holds the liquid and
solid droppings of the stable and barn-yard. With
out grass or vegetable matter you cannot maintain
your lands in a high state of cultivation. The
highest priced lands in our country are those where
me grasses are cultivated with most care, and grow
With mOSt luxuriance, as in Vironnin nn1 KVnhiAbr
It is admitted that our lauds will not vie with these
limestone regions. But you say our climate is too
hot, will not grow grasses. This is a mistake. The
l ea, L.ucerne, Orchard and other grasses flourish
will in warm latitudes. But tic soil must be well
prepared and plowed deep. In all middle North
Carolina the grasses flourish under proper treat
ment, and will yield more per acre, with the same
culture than in New York, Pennsylvania and New
England with their more barren soil, rocks, short
Summers and cold long Winters. A wise Philoso
pher has Slid that he was a benefactor to his race
who caused two blades of grass to grow where only
one grew before.
It is also true, that with the same preparation
and culture of the cereals, Middle and Western
North Carolina will produce per acre of corn, wheat
a mt other grains as much or more than Pennsylva-
nia. New York, New Jersey, or any of the New J
i
England States. But we must prepare our news
and fertilize them aa they do in the Eastern States,
and our earth will yield forth abundantly.
The sneaker went on to show that the culture of
cotton, tobacco, and the products of the pine tree.
was more profitable in me esuinauu ui me mmm
than the cultivation of the grasses, grains, beef,
perk, butter and cheese. The Nortli could not
raise Southern staples ; while we could produce
them, and nearly everything grown in tue isortu.
Ours was a work of choice, theirs of necessity. If
we had large populations and crowded cities, with
their home markets, our prluctiens would be more
varied and profitable. ;
He then spoke of the importance ei more ni mu
facturing establishments especially in cotton, iron
and all agricultural implements and of diversified
ndustries. The wonderful em cis ine manuiaciuru
of tobacco has had m budding up in a lew years
Winston, Durham and Retdsville; that Uichmonci,
Dan villend Lynchburg owea ineir prosperny very
largely to the manufacture of tobacco cities make
markets forhe farmer ; mere labor was cheap ami
abundant with us. But few races or people, if any.
could successfully compete with it so well adapted
to the cultivation of Southern crops, uur greater
want was capital, and that within the reach or
honest working men. The importance of education
to every race and condition of life especially the
farmer was demonstrated.
The speaker then paid a tribute to our Constitu
tion and Union, if they could be carried out as de
signed by the framers. That sectionalism is bane
ful "the policy ot hate is tue poncy oi uisumuii.
That the South, rent and desolated by war, required
above all things peace, law and order, to revive
her great industries and restore thrift and prosper
ity to all interests, impart value to property aim
increase the wages of the laboring man. The coun
try is fast recovering from its great depression.
This lias been effected by the energy, industry and
economy of its laboring classes producing and sell
ing more than they buy tuus onnging g-.iu m me
country, giving value to property anu increases
wages to labor. Suppress sectionalism, stay un
hand of further contraction of the currency, and the
future appears to be auspicious to the "good old
North State."

The Internal Revenue Service.
The annual report of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue predicts that the re
ceipts from internal revenue taxes will, dur
ing the present fiscal year, reach the sum
of 11 5,000,000.
The great maionty of the tax-payers are
reported as having observed the laws, and
faithfully paid their taxes, and it is be
lieved that in the greater portions of the
cour.try violations of the internal revenue
laws are as infrequent as can reasonably be
expected. And in those districts where
the laws have been for years openly vio
lated, and the officers set at defiance, there
is a returning sense of a majority of the
people to the duty of tax-payers to observe
the laws, and of the officers of the govern
ment to enforce them.
Tables embodied in the report show that
during the last three years and four months
3,117 illicit distilleries have been seized,
G,3G3 persons arrested for illicit distilling,
and 27 officers and employes killed and 48
wounded while engaged in enforcing the in
ternal revenue laws.
These fact", coupled with others of a
similar character, showing that nearly all
seizures, arrests and resistance of authority
are confined to the districts long infested
with these troubles, the Commissioner says,
"indicates unmistakably that much remains
to be done to place the service upon a satis
factory footing. This can only be done by
constant, vigorous and courageous efforts of
repression with such a force of deputies,
armed when necessary, as will demonstrate
the ability and determination of the tov
eminent to collect its revenue and enforce
its laws. And I deem it my duty to again
call your attention to the fact that the ap
propriations have been, and now are made
quate to the proper enforcement of the
laws." An appropriation of $100,000 as a
deficiency is recommended for the present
fiscal year for this service.
During the year ending June 30, 1879
$113,449,621 of internal revenue taxes were
colled ed and raid into the treasury. The
quantity of spirits (71,892,621 gallons) pro
duced and deposited in distillery ware
houses during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1879, was greater than the quantity
produced during any other year. ' Ine re
ceiDts from distilled snirits amounted to
$52,570,284.69, an increase of $2,149,468.89
over the preceding year. lhe total re
ceints from fermented liquors amounted to
$10,739,320.08, an increase over the pre
ceding year ot $792,268.30. The increase
of production of manufactured tobacco dur
ing the last fiscal year was 12,026,821
pounds: of the number of cigars and ciga
rettes 194.177.719. The total amount of
collections from tobacco in all its forms, in
eluding the internal revenue tax upon im
ported tobacco, snuff and cigars, and the
special taxes paid to manufacturers of and
dealers in leaf and manufactured tobacco,
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, was
$40,135,002.65. As compared with the
total receipts from the same source for the
preceding fiscal year, this shows an increase
of $43,247.98.
The total amount realized by the tax on
the capital and deposits of banks and bank
era during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1878, was $3,490,913, and for the fiscal year
1879 was $3,184,979, showing a decrease ol
$305,934. A statement of the capital and
deposits of savings banks and bankers other
than national banks, shows an aggregate
ol $195,290,513 invested in government
bonds, against $158,882,800 reported last
year. The total value of property seized
during the year for violation of internal
revenue laws was $524,146.
The cost of collecting the Internal Reve
nue is not in the abstract report, but
it
must be equal at least to one-halt the re
ceipts. II proper economy was practiced
the Government could dispense with taxes
on home products like liquors and tobacco.
SS? The Philadelphia Record,
viewing the Presidential field, says:
in re-
"The
attempt ot the Washington Post to get up
a Seymour feeling has not been very sue
cessful. All the Democrats entertain the
highest possible regard for Mr Seymour.
and would be exceedingly glad to support
nun. ii ne was ten years younger than he
is, and was willing to be a candidate, there
would be little doubt of his nomination
but, inasmuch as he absolutely declines to
be a candidate, and inasmuch as it is well
known that his health is so, feeble that he
has been absolutely ordered by his physi
cian to avoid excitement, and inasmuch as
the attempt to force him to run without his
consent would most probably result in end
ing his life, sensible Democrats look upon
the attempt to nominate him as merely a
piece oi campaign talk, and hardly worth
serious consideration."
The President's Messasre.

Synojisis of President ILiya? Message de
livered to Conrress on Monday; Dec.
st 1879.
The President, in his annual Message,
says that the circumstances under which
Congress assembles the large measure of
prosperity which the country enjoys call
for mutual congratulation and grateful ac
knowledgement to the Giver of all .good.
Qongresg is congratulated on the su-cesjful
accomplishment of resumption. The de
mand upou the treasury for -gold and silver
in exchange for notes has been small ind
the voluntary deposit of gold and bullion
for these has been large. The excess of
metals deposited for no. e.- ovt r the amount
of these redeemed is about $40,000,000.
The revival in buitiess is ascribed to re
sumption, and the amount of the balance
of trade in our favor July 1st to November
15th n. placed at $59,O00,0CO. lhe public
credit has improved, tht 4 per Ctnt bonds
tave been sold at and above par, raising a
fund sufficient to pay off all the rsational
debt redeemable under present laws. The
amount of interest saved annually by the
refunding process since March I, 1877, is
$14,297,177. The amount of the National
lebt which matures within less than two
years is $792,12 1,700, of which $500,000,000
bear interest at the rate of five per cent,
and t he balance is in bonds bearing six per
cent interest. It is b.lieved that this part
of the public debt can be refunded by tha
issue of four per cent bonds, and, by the re
duction of interest which will thus be ef
fected, about eleven millions of dollars can
be annually saved to the treasury. To se
cure this important reduction of interest to
be paid by the United States, further legis-
ation is i- quired, which, it is hoped, will
be provided by Congress during its ptestnt
session.
rhe coinage of gold by the mints of the
United States, during the last fiscal year,
was $40,986,912. The coinage of siher
dollars, s-ince the passage of the act for that
purpose, up to xSov. 1, 1S79, was $45,000,-
850, of w hich $12,700,344 have been issued
from the Treasury and are now in circu
lation, and $32,300,506 are still in the ros-
e?sion of the Government.
Further experiments with the coinage, it
s advised, had best be postponed until
after the meeting of the Monetary Con
gress, but the suspeiwon of the coinage of
tiie silver dollar upon the present legal
ratio is advised. Coined without limit,
side by side, silver, it is maintained, will
soon become the only standard of value, on
the principle that the market value of sil
ver is uniformly below that of gold. What
is wanted is a currency of gold and silver,
each of equal value. The President takes
the ground that as it is only in time of war
or other pressing emergency that the issue
of notes, the worth of which is fixed wholly
by the Government, is authorized, and that
as no such emergency now exists, the cir-
dilating notes, i
e., the greenbacks, should
now De retired in some manner wisely cai
. . . . . . . .
ciliated to forefend any disturbance of the
present financial equilibrium. He also ar
gues that, as it has been the policy of the
Government ever since the adoption of the
Constitution to nay off all debts as Foon
after they are incurred as possible, a sink
ing fund should now be provided or the
existing laws relating to t hat fund amended
so as to fix a limit specified and distinct
within which the present public debt shall
be paid. He then recommends that if the
revenues of the government shall not be
sufficient to provide necessary funds to
meet the demand of such a policy, a tariff
should be placed on tea and coliee, as that
tax could be conveniently levied, and
would be less felt by the people than any
other.
The continued practice of polygamy in
Utah, the President urges, demands atten
tion at the hands of every department ol
the Government. Those practicing poly
gamy should be prosecuted and punished.
This Territory has now sufficient popula
tion to entitle it to representation as
State, but this change of its condition can
not be allowed until its citizens abandon a
practice which civilized communities recog
nize as criminal. The plea that polygamy
is a right guaranteed under the law grant
ing religious liberty to all people, no longer
holds good in the lace of the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States that
the regulation of the system of marriage
which now obtains in Utah is within the
legislative power of Congress. The law
which has been for seventeen years a dead
letter, but which, under this recent decision,
is made alive, should be vigorously en
forced, and if necessary the enjoyment of
the rights of citizenship should be withheld
from the polygamists who continue to vio
late the law of the United States making
the practice of their peculiar doctrines
criminal.
The recent elections have shown to th
President the purpose of the people to see
all sections secure in the enjoyment of their
personal and political rights, and he be
heves that "the power ot public opinion
will override all political prejudices, and
all sectional and State attachments, in de
manding that all over our wide territory
the name and character of citizens of the
United States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry with them unchallenged
security and respect. He believes that
when the public mind is set at rest upon
the subject of popular rights, pacification o
the whole country will come.
Considerable space is devoted to civi
service reform, and the President dwells
upon the evils and perils of the partisan
spoils system of appointment to office,
He maintains that political considerations
should not enter into appointments; that
the capacity of men and regard for the
public interest should alone control, and a
system which would change public officers
with every election, only on politica
grounds, is nighty miscinevous. i ne sys
tern of assessing office-holders is also de
nounced. It is maintained that office-holders
should feel at perfect liberty to give or
not to give to political campaign funds
He is opposed to any system of appoint
ment or tenure which would make the office
holder a mere servant of the party which
gave him office, and discourages the idea of
these giving unduly of their time to parti
san politics. In discussing this subject the
President recommends to Congress the re
vival of the Civil Service Commission,
which was in existence several years ago
for the purpose of examining and enquiring
into the capacity of applicants for offices
within the gift of the Government.
Our relations with foreign countries, it is
observed, have continued peaceful. Refer
ence is made to the unsettled condition of
the questions at issue between America and
Great Britain with reference to the fisheries,
but no congressional action is suggested in
the premises.
It is suggested that an appropriation be
made to have .the Uuited States , ivpre-.
sented at the exhibition at Melbourn, Aus
tralia, next year.
Questions of difference with Spain have
been settled. The East Florida claims are
again in dispute. A treaty with the Neth
erlands has been signed and ratified. Ques
tions of difference with Switzerland in re
lation to pauper and convict emigrants, are
in process of settlement.
The government of China has signified
its willingness to consider the question
the emigration ot its subjects to the United
States with a dispassionate fairness, and to
co-operate in such measures as may tend to
prevept injurious consequences to the Uni
ted stales, lhe negotiations are still pro
ceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.
Mexican raids and depredations have
greatly decreased. The third instalment
of the award against Mexico has been paid.
rso other facts of interest in regard to rela
tions between this and other countries are
mentioned, but it is regarded as a fit sub
ject for congratulation, that there isagrati
ying increase of trade with nearly all li.u
roDean and American countries.
Referring to the condition of affairs in
Alaska, he alludes to the fortuitous appear
ance and interference of the British vessel
Osprey at Sitka, during the troubles in
that vicinity last Spring, and then recom
menus the immediate establishment oi a
territorial judiciary in Alaska. The rea
sons advanced to support this suggestior
are, in effect, that the interests of economy
will be served by prompt trials of offenders
against the laws ot the United States, in
the Territory where the crimes may be
committed. Under the present system
prisoners and witnesses are transported at
great expense to Oregon and California,
where such trials are now held.
1 he l' resident directs an en i ion to the
which shows, among other things, that the
ordinary revenues from all sources for the
fiscal year ended June 30, IS 9, were $273,
827,184.46: the ordinary expenditures for
llm Knmo iuiMrl u-uro &Ofift OJ. 7 QOQ SQ .
leaving a surplus revenue for the year of
$6,879,300.93. The receipts for the present
fiscal year ending June 30th, 1880, actual
and estimated, are $288,000,000: exnendi

oi $y,uo,byo.ui. ine arrearages oi pen
sions for the last and current year, amount
ing to $21,747,249.60, have been substan
tially paid, and it is believed that, this
drain having been stopped, the sinking
fund can henceforth be maintained without
any change of the existing law. The Presi
dent traces the reports of the Secretaries of
the Treasury, of War, of the Navy of the
Interior, of the Postmaster-General and of
the Commisioner of Indian Affairs, con
curring in the main in their recommenda
tions to Congress. As a member of the
Washington Monument commission he ad
vises tne appropriation ot a surncient sum
and the change ot existing laws to permit
the completion of the monument at an early
date,
Referring to the deficiency which exists
in the appropriation for the Department of
Justice, he points out the necessity of an
immediate appropriation for the payment of
accrued dues and fees of United States
Marshals arising from the failure of Con
gress to provide at the late extra session for
their payment under the usual proces
Referring to the fact that the business of
the Supreme Court is now largely in arrears,
and that there is no prospect of the Jus
tices getting even with their work, the
President recommends the establishment
of an intermediate Court of errors and ap
peals, to the end that accumulated business
may be taken on the dockets of the Su
preme Court.
Regarding the Indians, the President,
while deploring the recent outbreaks, is sat
isfied that the general good behavior of the
tribes sustains the opinions of those who
believe that humane treatment will j'et in
duce them to abandon their savage modes
of life. He recommends the enactment of
a law enabling the Government to give the
Indians a title in fee, inalienable for 25
years, to the farm lands assigned to them
by assortment. He says the Indian schools
in v irgmia ana x ennsyivania nave neen
productive of good results, and the success
of these has led to arrangements for the
! . .1 y TT
esiaousnment oi anoiner in Oregon, ne
discourages a renewal of the discussions re'
garding the transfer of the Indian bureau
to the War Department, as that discussion
always serves to hamper the officials of the
Indian bureau in pending operations and
negotiations, and produces no correspond
ing good.
The discussion of the question of depre
dations upon the timber lands is not of
general public concern.
He commends highly the objects of the
Agricultural Department, and recommends
that its facilities be enlarged. He says the
omission to render such aid is not wise
economy; but, on the contrary, undoubted'
ly results in losses of immense sums an
nually that might be saved through well
directed efforts by the Government to pro
mote this vital interest.
The President is gratified to know ot ihe
extent to which educational privileges
throughout the United States have ad
vanced during the year, and commends to
the consideration of Congress the whole
question of popular education.
Considerable attention is paid to the af
fairs of the District of Columbia. It is re
commended that Congress look more closely
to the care of its streets, to the educational
wants of the District, and that the flats in
front of the city of Washington be filled ;
not only that this will add to the adjacent
parks and lands, but to . the end that the
permanent improvement of the river for
purposes of navigation may be secured.
The above comprises the main points of
the message, which is longer (or more wordy)
than any of the previous messages of Mr
Hayes.
OBITUARY OF DR. J. M. W. DAVIDSON
. r rom me vuihcj nnau.,
It U with sentiments of the tleepesUr'rret that
we chronicle the death of Dn John M. W. Da
vidson, who departed this life at the residence of
his son. Hon. R. II M. Davidson, on bunday morn
ing the 16th of Nov., after a lingering and pamfal J
illness of more than three weeks. W ith the death
of Dr. Davidson this community has lost a good
and valuable member, and another of the land
marks in the history of this section of the country
has passed away.
He .was born ia Mecklenburg count'. North
Carolina, about the 9th of Novembor, 1801, and
was at the date of his death 78 years and 7 days of
cge, . in IJeceniber, 1828, he came to this State fuojll
settled within a few miles of this place, from
whence he shortly afterwards removed to this
town and purchased and improved the lot now so
well known and recognized as the Davidson
Homestead. Our little town was then in its in
fancy and the surrounding country comparatively
new and sparsely settled by a few sturdy and de
termined pioneers. Mosi ot these brave and reso
lute men. the compeers and companions of the
Doctor, have gone before him to their final rest.
fessional
Upon settling here, Dr. Davidson offered his pro-
services to the public as a practicing pby
sician, and having ever been a hard student, method
ical, kind and attentive to the calls of the sick and
distressed, he was not long in acquiring a large
and remunerative practice coextensive with the
limits of the , county. ; For many, years, and until
admonished by the fast accumulating infirmities of
age that he must yield his enviable position to
younger and more active men, he retained his prao.
tice, and was regarded as one of the leading physi
cians of the county, admired and loved not alone
for the skill and success that attended his practice,
but also for the many manly and noble virtues that
characterized and adorned his life in whatever
sphere he was called to act.
In religion the Lioctor was a strict, ana we may
say, uncompromising fresoytenan. irameu up
under the influences and teachings of what is
known as "Scotch Presbyterian ism, he never de
viated or departed from that faith. Though
strong in the faith he professed and practiced, he
was not in any sense bigoted, selfopionated or in
tolerant, but at all times and under all circum
stances he exhibited the utmost consideration and
charity for all christian denominations who dif
fered from him in articles of faith. At an early
age he professed religion and united with the Pres
byterian church, where he at once became con
spicuous for his consistent christian course. His
general intelligence, his high christian character
and zealous labors for the welfare and upbuilding
of the church, soon recommended hun to his chris
tian brethren as well suited for the responsible
office of Ruling Elder. He was accordingly elec
ted and ordained to this high office and up to the
time of his death, a period of about forty-six years,
he filled the office with satisfaction and benefit to
the church and credit to himself. Foi the like
long period he filled in the most acceptable man
ner the office of Superintendent of the Presbyterian
Sundav School. Here his christian zeal and tue
love of his Master s work was indeed conspicuous,
Nothing but physical inability or the inexorable
calls of his profession to minister to the necessities
of the sick and distressed prevented his regular and
punctual attendance upon this institution, lhe
good seeds so generously sown in the Sunday
School by this christian worker has sprung up and
borne fruit not only in this county but in other
portions of this and adjoining States. He was a
man of strong feelings and positive convictions
aud when and wherever duty called whether in the
line of his profession, in the (Jhurcli, in tne feunday
School or as a private citizen he responded with
the utmost promptness-and performed the duty
with all the skill and ability at his command. The
Church of which he was such an exemplary and
distinguished member and officer will greatly miss
his counsel, christian precepts and zealous interest
and labors in its behalf. And it will be long be
fore his Sunday School scholars will forget the
scriptural admonitions that so regularly fell from
his hps, or become accustomed to the teachings ot
another.
This entire community sensibly feels the bereave
ment it has suffered, and the large concourse of
people irrespective of age, race or condition who at
tended his funeral and followed his remains to
their last resting place testify in tones loud and
eloquent that a good man has passed from time to
eternity. Of hun it may be truly said : ".Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from hence
forth ; yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from
their labors, and their works do follow them.
fThe deceased was the oldest brother of Mr A
Brevard Davidson of Charlotte.
