t.en. Pabcoch, as chief engineer of the Wash
irgton Ac4u? ilnct. firm notice to the public tha'
the wasted aqoednet water most be ?toppe I.
He attr?t>u?r# the deficiency of water to the fact
that householders and other* allow the water to
run to ??.?(*; to pr? Tent the pipes from freesing
No doubt there in waste. in thin and other way*

th;?t the gri at and extravagant waste of water is
by the guvrniii nt departments and n<?t by the
ritiieu (Irtat vigilance ha* been u-edhy th*
Water 1>? i artaaent to atop leaks and prevent
wa-.tr by the citixens. but at the governm^nt
departm. rt>. where the water officers have no
control, the naste is excessive, and the aqueduct
w atcr i> ?4<l an though it were as free as air.
And this waste of water is mainly for running
nisrhici ry and to effect a trivial saving in ex
pense of motive jower?a saving with a ven
gc?ntt n hen it deprives all the upper part of the
city ot wat? r and puts ill the city at the merry of
a centlagr?..?>n by reducing the water in the
miiins to th< minimum !
At the Tn a?ry Department a turbine wheel
if ran by water; at the Navy Department a con
tlessor is used. and the aqueduct water kept
rnnning t<> waste all day long through an inch
snd a half pip?* taring to the government by the
iw of water ovr the use of coal a pitiful dollar
or two a day. At other departments there is
similar watfr, either through the use of the
water for mechanical purposes, or from the
manner in which it is allowed to run perpetually
at water clouts and wash basins.
Of course the government has the first right to
the use of the Potomac water, but It never could
hare been contemplated to bring it here at such
heavy cost to be used in running machinery to
the deprivation of half lite city of water, and at
the risk of the sacrifice of valuable government
property by tire through inadequacy of water

Henry Ward Beecher deems it necewary to
explain his ?? rmoa of last Sunday night, on the
agency of spirits in the affairs of this world, and
write* to the New York TVt&nne that he did not
iliKiu* "spiritualism" as that term is now un
derstood, but the scriptural teaching respecting
the Divine Spirit. Modern "Spiritualism" waa
barely alluded to, but without affirmation or
denial. He acknowledges that he looks with
profound interest upon all wise efforts to eduoe
the scientific truth from that extraordinary class
of phenomena which have become so common in
c.nr day, and to which, at length?in England at
least?the attention of men of the highest scien
tific attainment has been serioosly turned; but
says he has never yet been convinced that these
remarkable nxxlern phenomena originated trom
the interposition of spirits outside of the human
l>ody. The reporters say that there was no
tipping of their table during the sermon of last
Sunday night the spirits seeming absorbed i:i
the eloqtn nt pastor*s discourse; but several wit
nesses testify that during the singing of the last
hymn Mr. Beecher's gum shoes became vio
lently agitated, and gave every evidence of the
frantic attempt* ot some "invisible ag?nt" to try
tk(m<m. All at once they were dashed against
the partition which separates the platform from
the v* stibule behind it, and this the witnewtea
declare clearly demonstrates that the "agent"
? a? liable to sudden 5ts of anger, and lost his
temper u| on discovering that number eight gum
shoes won i go over number nine boots even for
a spirit. ^
The d? m<H ratio member* of Congress seem to
l?e quite as muih at sea as the democracy at
large, in r? t,ard to the course to be pursued on
the question of "to be. or not to be"?of commit
ting snkuk by the "passive policy," or of
making another desperate effort for individual
c .isttnc?-. They find, after an interchange of
information that there is not a single one of the
1.3 republican m> mhers of the House who Is
v illing to ci nit out snuarely in opposition to
(?rant. Those who dislike him concede that if
1 e i> nominated they must sup]>ort him. The
democrat* cannot, therefore, quite figure out
? hat they will make by surrendering their quar
ter ol a million of voters to a mythical anti-Grant
republican party that has not a single represen
tative in t'ongreaa.
The republican voters of Webster, Mass., by
an arrangement cmiorsed by the representative
ot their district. Mr. Hoar, who will accede to
their wish. ? so far as his infiuenre goes, voted
yesterday by ballot" Yea" or " No" u|>on the
c uc?tion '? Do you think it expedient that there
be a charge of postmaster in the town of Web
ster If a majority of all ballots received shall
l>e in the negative, no other voting wdl be had;
but in case snob majority shall be in the affirma
tive. a meeting will be held to vote by ballot for
a person tn be- recommended as the succemor of
the present ncumbent. We have not yet been
informed of the result, and so far as the post
ma-terslup is concerned it is a matter of little
iiu!>ortanci. but a? a hint toward civil service
retorm in one dir. ction. at least, the arrange
ment is sicr.ilicant.
" .lobs In the District legislature," is the
lieaehng give n by the New York Herald corre
sjondent to bis notice of the report of the com
n.ttee recommending the Savage site for a mar
ket. He says:
" The ne-rthera residents of the capital want a
public nixiket, and Mr. Core*oran, the rich m in
ot Washington, tenders a vacant square on the
main line or traffic for #100,000, and otters to
Hive tbe money to the Nation*! Art GaUoi^r,

the city to the purchase of a piece of swamp

There is said to be a novel religious movement
. n foot, nothing lew than a revival among the
^eniety of Friends, which, commencing in the
V tat, has extended to New York. Thia denomi
i it.on, a* is well known, has hitherto been noted
.< r its conservatism and non-aggressive policy,
it a new spirit has taken poeneaeioa 9f the
i. embers, and they now propose to take a more
:j. five part in evangelical work. This move
vent is called a revival by tbe Friends thea
- Ives, and is now in blast in Brooklyn,
here largely attended meetings have been in
l ogress since the 30th ot November.
As the Prince of Wales gets better the mon
?'chy gets worse. There is something more in
the indifi.rewee of tbe English people to his re
cent dangerous condition than the personal un
l-opularity of the Pru.ce, and that Is the growth
Ot deanocratie sentiment and the decay of loyalty.
When the people begin to count the coat of
