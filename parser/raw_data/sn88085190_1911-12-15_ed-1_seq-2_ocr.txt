TAFT WRITES ON PEACE.
Second Message Tells of Movement
to Extend Arbitration.
Washington, D. C—President Taf t
Thursday sent to (congress, a message
dealing with foreign relations of the
United States. He says that the year
just passed has been noteworthy for a
general movement of the powers for
broader arbitration. He mentions
the settlement of the Alsop claims
against Chile and to the part the
United States played in facilitating
settlement between Panama and Costa
Rica and between Hayti and the
Dominican republic.
The insurrection in Mexico and the
ensuing mobilization of United States
troops along the border are reviewed,
and the president makes public the
text of his letter of instructions to the
chief of staff of which he said:
"It seems my duty as Commander
in-Chief to place troops in sufficient
number where, if congress shall di
rect that they enter Mexico to save
American lives and property, an effec
tive movement may be promptly
made. Meantime, the movement of
the troops to Texas and elsewhere
near the boundary, accompanied with
sincere assurances of the utmost good
will toward the present Mexican gov
ernment and with larger and more fre
quent patrols along the border to pre
vent insurrectionary expeditions from
American soil, will hold up the hands
of the existing government and will
have a healthy moral effect to prevent
attacks upon Americans and their
property in any subesquent general in
ternecine strife. Again, the sudden
mobilaiztion of a division of troops has
been a great test of our army and full
of useful instruction, while the ma
neuvers that are thus made possible
can occupy the troops and their offi
cers to great advantage.
"The assumption by the press that
I contemplate intervention on Mexi
can soil to protect American lives or
property is of course gratuitous, be
cause I seriously doubt whether I
have such authority under any circum
stances, and if I had I would not ex
ercise it without express congressional
approval. Indeed, as you know, I
have already declined, without Mexi
can consent, to order a troop of caval
ry to protect the breakwater we are
constructing just across the border in
Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado
river to save Imperial valley, al
though the insurrectos had scattered
the Mexican troops and were taking
our horses and supplies and frighten
ing our workmen away. My deter
mined purpose, however, is to be in a
position so that when danger to
American lives and property in Mex
ico threatens and the existing govern
ment is rendered helpless by the in
surrection, I can promptly execute
congressional orders to protect them,
with effect."
The president reviews the incident
at Douglas, Ariz., in which Americans
were killed and wounded by bullets
fired by belligerents across the bound
ary line, and tells of his unwilling
ness, even under great provocation, to
order an invasion, and how it was
urged upon the people of Douglas that
they place themselves temporarily out
of the zone of fire, rather than incur
the necessity for such action as might
have been followed by serious results
to a greater number of Americans
living in Mexico.
The message urges the completion
of conventions between the United
States and the Republic of Honduras
and of Nicaragua, and adds: "In
considering the ratification of the con
ventions with Nicaragua and Hon
duras, there rests with the United
States the heavy responsibility of the
fact that their rejection here might
destroy the progress made and consign
the republics concerned to still deeper
submergence in bankruptcy, revolu
tion and national jeopardy."
The section of the message dealing
with the Far East has to do chiefly
with the conclusion of the two inter
national Chinese loans — one for the
construction of Hukuang railways and
the other for the carrying out of the
currency reform to which China was
pledged by treaty.
Beavers Charm Turists.
Washington, D. C.—Tourists in the
Yellowstone National park have
shown co much interest in the beavers
that inhabit the streams that the de
partment of the Interior is consider
ing the advisabliity of placing colon
ies of the animals in some of the other
national parks. The beaver has been
one of the most potent factors in the
exploration of the rocky mountain re
gion because the early trappers were
generally searching for beaver when
they first penetrated the 1 fastnesses of
the mountains.
Wants Arbitration With Germany.
Berlin—The Tageblatt publishes,
under a Washington date, what pur
ports to be an interview with Presi
dent Taft upon the subjects of inter
national arbitration, armaments, Mr.
Shuster and the trusts. According to
the correspondent, the president is de
sirous of obtaining an arbitration
treaty with Germany. He foresees
that all nations that sign arbitration
treaties with the United States will
duplicate these among themselves.
Idaho Tract for Entry.
Washington, D. C—Nearly 2,500,
--000 acres of land in Idaho, withdrawn
from entry about a year ago for coal
land classification purposes, was re
stored by order of President Taft on
the recommendation of Secretary of
the Interior Fisher. Careful field ex
amination revealed, the fact that the
land was "without coal value." The
land restored is along the Snake
River.
PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
DEALS WflU TRUST EVIL
Would Have a "Trust Overseer" and
O. K. for "Good" Combinations.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—President
Taft's message to Congress, read in
both houses today, was devoted wholly
to the subject of trusts and the en
forcement of anti-monopoly laws.
The President begins by saying the
message is one of several he shall send
to Congress before the Christmas holi
days; that the number of important
subjects to be treated Is too large for
one. He then reviews the anti-trust
law and the Supreme Court decisions in
the tobacco trust cases. He says:
This message is the first of several
which I shall send to Congress during
the interval between the opening of its
regular session and its adjournment for
the Christmas holidays. The amount of
Information to be communicated as to
the operations of the Government, the
number of important subjects calling
for comment by the Executive, and the
transmission to Congress of exhaustive
reports of special commissions, make it
impossible to include in one message
of a reasonable length a discussion of
the topics that ought to be brought to
the attention of the National Legisla
ture at its first regular session.
It has been said that the court, by
introducing into the construction of the
statute common-law distinctions, has
emasculated it. This is obviously un
true. By its judgment every contract
and combination in restraint of inter
state trade made with the purpose or
necessary effect of controlling prices
by stifling competition, or of establish
ing in whole or in part a monopoly of
such trade, is condemned by the stat
ute. The most extreme critics cannot
instance a case that ought to be con
demned under the statute which is not
brought within its terms as thus con
strued.
Court Power Limited.
The suggestion is also made that the
Supreme Court by its decision In the
last two cases has committed to the
court the undefined and unlimited dis
cretion to determine whether a case of
restraint of trade is within the terms
of the statute. This is wholly untrue.
A reasonable restraint of trade at com
mon law is well understood and Is
clearly defined. It does not rest in the
discretioa of the court. It must be
limited to accomplish the purpose of a
lawful main contract to which, In or
der that it shall be enforceable at all,
it must be incidental. If it exceed the
needs of that contract, it is void.
The test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court at common law to
contracts or combinations or conspira
cies in restraint of trade whose pur
pose was or whose necessary effect
would be to stifle competition, to con
trol prices or establish monopolies. The
courts never assumed power to say that
such contracts or combinations or con
spiracies might be lawful if the par
ties to them were only moderate m the
use of the power thus 'secured and did
not exact from the public too great and
exorbitant prices. It is true that many
theorists, and others engaged in busi
ness violating the statute, have hoped
that some such line could be drawn by
courts; but no court of authority has
ever attempted it. Certainly there is
nothing in the decisions of the latest
two cases from which such a dangerous
theory of judicial discretion in enforc
ing this statute can derive the slightest
sanction.
We have been 21 years making this
statute effective for the purposes for
which it was enacted. The Knight
case was discouraging and seemed to
remit to the states the whole avail
able power to attack and suppress the
evils of the, trusts. • Slowly, however,
the error of that judgment was cor
rected, and only In the last three or
four years has the heavy hand of the
law been laid upon the great illegal
combinations that have exercised such
an absolute dominion over many of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and a number are pend
ing, but juries have felt averse to con
victing for jail sentences, and judges
have been most reluctant to impose
such sentences on men of respectable
standing in society, whose offense tvas
been regarded as merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better
understood and the committing of it
partakes more of studied and delib
erate defiance of the law, we can be
confident that juries will convict indi
viduals and that jail sentences will be
imposed.
Slse of New Companies.
Objection was made by certain Inde
pendent tobacco companies that this
settlement (Tobacco Trust) was unjust
because it left companies with very
large capital in active business, and
that the settlement that would be ef
fective to put all on an equality would
be a division of the capital and plant
of the trust into small fractions in
amount more nearly equal to that of
each of the independent companies.
This contention results from a mis
understanding of the anti-trust law
and its purpose. It Is not Intended
thereby to prevent the accumulation
of large capital in business enterprises
in which such a combination can secure
reduced cost of production, sale, and
distribution. It Is directed against
such an aggregation of capital only
when Its purpose is that of stifling of
competition, enhancing or controlling
prices, and establishing a monopoly.
If we shall have by the decree defeated
these purposes and restored competi
tion between the large units into
which the capital and plant have been
divided, we shall have accomplished
the useful purpose of the statute.
It is not the purpose of the statute
to confiscate the* property and capital
of the offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by fine or imprisonment of
the individual offenders, by fine of the
corporation or. by forfeiture of Its
goods in transportation, are provided
but the proceeding in equity Is a speci
fic remedy to stop the operation of the
trust by injunction and prevent the
future use of the plant and capital In
violation of the statute.
I venture to say that not In the
history of American law has a decree
more effective for such a purpose been
entered by a court than that against
the Tobacco Trust.
It has been assumed that the pres
ent pro rata and common ownership
in all these (tobacco) companies by
former stockholders of the trust would
insure a continuance of the same old
single control of all the companies Into
which the trust has by decree been
disintegrated. This is erroneous and
is based upon the assumed lnefficacy
and innocuousness of judicial injunc
tions. The companies are enjoined
from co-operation or combination; they
have different managers, directors,
purchasing and sales agents. If all or

in the statute which condemns combi

The President recommends Federal
incorporation, and refers to his spe
cial message to Congress on January 7,
1910, when he pointed out the disturb
ance to business that would prob
ably attend the dissolution of offending
trusts, saying: . , *.:&&&&&*
If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations ;lnf^trajlnt^
trade Is to be effectively enforced, it
is essential that the National Gov
ernment shall provide for the creation
of National ; corporations to carry on a
legitimate t■: business throughout the
United States, conflicting laws :of
the aifferent states of the Union with
respect to foreign corporations make
it difficult. if not impossible, for orie
corporation to comply with their re
quirements so as to carry on business
in a number of different states.
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation^ corpora-,
tions to engage in trade afp «cttnmerce
among the states and witKrforftgn lo
tions. Every argument whjgh mi imb
advanced for such a law, #d e*»ry mr,
pJanation which was at Cfeat tfcne ©f
fered to possible objections, have been
confirmed by.tour experience since the
enforcement of the anti-trust statute
has resulted in the actual dissolution
of active commercial organisations.
Recreative Laws Urged.
It Is even more manifest now than It
was then that the denunciation of con
spiracies in restraint of trade should
not and does not mean the denial of
organizations large enough to be in
trusted with our Interstate and for
eign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then that a
purely negative statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for the building
up and regulation of legitimate Na
tional and foreign commerce.
The drafting of the decrees in the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view of their reorganization into
legitimate corporations, has made it
especially apparent that the courts are
not provided with the administrative
machinery to make the necessary In
quiries preparatory to reorganiza
tion, or to pursue such inquiries,
and they should be empowered
to invoke the aid of the Bureau of
Corporations in determining the suit
able reorganization of the disintegrat
ed parts. The Circuit Court and the
Attorney-General were greatly aided
In framing the decree in the tobacco
trust dissolution by an expert from the
Bureau of Corporations.
For Special Bureau.
I do not set forth in detail the terms
and sections of a statute which might
supply the constructive legislation per
mitting and aiding the formation of
combinations of capital into Federal
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid rules as to their organization
and procedure, including effective pub
licity, and to the closest supervision
as to the issue of stock and bonds by
an executive bureau or commission in
the Department of Commerce and La
bor, to which in times of doubt they
might well submit their proposed plans
for future business. It must be dis
tinctly understood that incorporation
under a Federal law couia not exempt
the company thus formed* and its in
corporators and managers from prose
cution under the anti-trust law for
subsequent illegal conduct, but the pub
licity of its procedure and the oppor
tunity for frequent consultation with
the bureau or commission in charge of
the incorporation as to the legitimate
purpose of its transactions would of
fer great security against such success
ful prosecutions for violations of the
law as would be practical or wise.
Such a bureau or commission might
well be invested also with the duty, al
ready referred to, of aiding courts in
the dissolution and re-creation of trusts
within the law. It should be an execu
tive tribunal of the dignity and power
of the Controller of the Currency or
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
which now exercise supervisory power
over important classes of corporations
under Federal regulation.
The drafting of such a Federal incor
poration law would offer ample oppor
tunity to prevent many manifest evils
in corporate management today, includ
ing irresponsibility of control in the
hands of the few who are not the real
owners.
I recommend that the Federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experience justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of such
a charter would attract all who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fail to take advantage of the Federal
Incorporation will not have a right to
complain if their failure is ascribed to
unwillingness to submit their trans
actions to the careful official scrutiny,
competent supervision and publicity at
tendant upon the enjoyment of such a
charter.
The opportunity thus suggested for
Federal incorporation, it seems to me,
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great Industrial enterprises to the rule
of action laid down by the anti-trust
law. This statute as construed by the
Supreme Court must continue to be the
line of distinction for legitimate busi
ness. It must be enforced, unless we
are to banish individualism from all
business and reduce it to one common
system of regulation or control of
prices like that which now prevails,
with respect to public utilities, and
which when applied to all business
would be a long step toward state so.
cialism.
Efficacy Seem.
The anti-trust act is the expression
of the effort of a freedom-loving people
to preserve equality of opportunity. It
is the result of the confident determi
nation of such a people to maintain
their future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted the enter
prise of the individual, his Industry, his
ingenuity, his intelligence, and his in
dependent courage.
For 20 years or more this statute has
been upon the statute book. All knew
its general purpose and approved. Many
of its violators were cynical over its
assumed Impotence. It seemed Impos
sible of enforcement. Slowly the mills
of the courts ground, and only grad
ually did the majesty of the law as
sert itself. Many of its statesmen-au
thors died before it became a living
force, and they and others saw the evil
grow which they had hoped to destroy.
Now Its efficacy is seen; now Its power
is heavy; now its object is near achieve,
ment. Now we hear the call for its
repeal on the. plea that it Interferes
with business prosperity, and we are
advised in most general terms, how by
some other statute and in some other
way the evil we are just stamping out
can be cured.if we only abandon this
work of 80 years and try another ex
periment for another term of years. .
It is said that the act has not dons
good. Can this be said in the face of
the effect of tha Northern Securities
decree? That decree was in no way so
drastic or inhlbltlve in detail as either
the Standard 011 decree or the Tobacco
decree; but did it not stop for all time
the then powerful movement toward
the control of all the railroads of the
country in a single hand? Such a one
man power could not have been a
healthful influence in the Republic,
even though exercised under the gen
eral supervision of an interstate com
mission.
Do we desire to make such ruthless
combinations and monopolies lawful?
When all energies are directed, not to
ward the reduction of the cost of pro
duction for the public benefit by a
healthful competition, but toward new
ways and means for making permanent
in a few hands the absolute control of
the conditions and prices prevailing In
the whole field of Industry, then Indi
vidual enterprise and effort will be
paralysed and the spirit of commercial
freedom will be dead.

Early Reports of Attack Are Con
firmed —Explosion of Ship's Mag
azines Finished Destruction.
Washington, D. C. — The United
States battleship Maine, sank in Ha
vana Harbor in February, 1898, as a
result of an explosion, was blown up
from the outside. This was announced
by the naval board that has been ex
amining the wreck. The finding con
firms the report of the original inves
tigators, who made a superficial ex
amination of the wreck soon after the
disaster.
The statement was given out by the
Navy department in brief. Secretary
Meyer does not believe it necessary to
issue any extended explanation of the
board's conclusions beyond the flat
statement that an exterior explosion
was responsible for the loss of the
warship and the lives of many men.
The statement follows:
"The board found that the injuries
to the bottom of the Maine were caus
ed by the explosion of a charge of low
form of explosives exterior to the
ship, between frames 28 and 31,
strake B, port side.
"This resulted in igniting and ex
ploding the contents of the six-inch
reserve magazine, A-14-M, said con
tents including a large quantity of
black powder.
"The more or less complete explo
sion of the contents of the remaining
forward magazines followed.
"The magazine explosion resulted
in the destruction of the vessel."
Secretary Meyer announced that
there might be a further statement on
the report of the board after it had
been considered by the president. One
member of the board was of the opin
ion that the report never would be
publised in full The declaration that
"a low form of explosive" was used
in the outside explosion indicates the
belief that a mine, not a dirigible tor
pedo, was the instrument of destruc
tion.
ALL 1909 TOBACCO SOLD.
Pooling Arrangement to Last Ten
Years Now Being Made.
Lexington, Ky. — It is announced
here that the American Tobacco com
pany has bought from the Burley To
bacco society at 161 cents a pound, all
the tobacco remaining in the 1909
pool, about 8,000,000 pounds. This
closes out all the pool holdings and -
marks the end of one of the most
novel industrial wars ever waged.
The Burley Tobacco society was or
ganized five years ago and has pooled
tobacco four times. In the course of
its fight for higher prices the night
rider outrages that terrified many
counties in Kentucky, Southern Ohio
and Indiana occurred. The price of
tobacco rose from three to five cents
a pound to as high as 25 cents, and
many tobacco growers have become
relatively wealthy.
A pooling arrangement to last ten
years is now being made with growers
in this part of the South.
