How to Tax the People.
BY LEO.
There is an old saying that two
things are sure, namely, death
and taxes. But though sure m
fact, both vary in form. Death
may come in various ways ; and
so taxes. And just now there is
quite a discussion going on as to
how tax the people for the sup
port of civil government and oth
er necessary expenses. The mon
ey. and much of it, must come
from some source. The question
of the hour is. who should bear
the burden?
Of all forms of taxation that
of a tariff on foreign made and
imported goods is the surest
source of revenue and the one
least felt by the people. And
hence our government has al
ways, under both parties, col
lected its vast revenues from a
tariff, in the main. Of course,
eventually, much of this comes
from the consumer in enhanced
value of purchased goods, but
the pressure is lightly felt by the
masses because the collection of
it is indirect and widely spread.
For the above reasons all com
mercial countries, even Free
Trade England, rely on tariff
taxation.
Internal revenues come from
taxed home products seeking
markets at home. And much of
this comes from luxuries, such
as whisky and tobacco. Nobody
needs to contribute to the great
fund if he abstains from the use
of the two luxuries, and proba
bly all of us would fare all the
better by using neither of the
two luxuries. They are, how
ever, in general use, from which
the government derives a large
revenue. .
It is claimed by some that by
collecting taxes on whisky and
tobacco, the government enters
into partnership with the dealers
therein, but there is no more
partnership in it than when the
government makes an evil-doer
pay a fine for a transgression of
statute law. By fining the Stan
dard Oil Company nearly thirty
millions of dollars the govern
ment did not become a partner
ir Vio pntipprn. The aim of a
fine is preventive. The same is
true of the tax levied on the sa
loon. The object is to curtail the
traffic and make it pay a part of
the vast expense it puts upon the
nation in the incitement of crime.
President Roosevelt, in his late
message to Congress, recom
mends taxing wealth by taxing
incomes and inheritances. This
-is not particularly new, and real
ly nothing out of reason. The
wealthy classes do not pay m
. proportion to their wealth, con
sequently the comparatively poor
of the land must pay more than
their share. A graded income
tax would be just and proper. Jt
would make the millionaires con
tribute their just share of taxa-
To be sure, the Supreme
Mirt has declared such a tax un
at.itutional. but probably a law
could be framed that would pass,
muster in this great court. -
President, obviously, thinks so or
he would not recommend such a
1 1 tir
An inheritance tax would be
lust and prolific of revenue. Just,
because the heirs to great estates
exnend no energies in the gatn-
ering thereof, and much of it
romes from the growth in value
by reason of good government
w-tion. The government
that facilitates and protects ac
cumulation is really entitled to a

It's a heavy strain on mother.
Her system is called upon to supply

Some form of nourishment that will
be easily taken up by mother's system
is needed.

greatest possible amount of nourish

part of the wealth at the distri
bution of large estates. And it
would be much better for them
selves and the country if heirs
to estates got less by inheritance
and more by personal effort.
For these reasons we favor the
idea of taxing both incomes and
inheritances above a certain a
mount. We would be glad to see
such a taxing of wealth in gen
eral operation.

Official Report on Corn and Crop
Conditions Dec. 1, 1907
The following report of the es
timated corn production for the
present year and the condition of
other crops is computed from the
returns received from the official
township crop correspondents of
the Ohio Department of Agri
culture:
Wheat Condition compared
with an average, 80 ; amount of
crop of 1907 sold as soon as thre
shed, 43; damage to growing
crop by Hessian fly, 1, and by
white grub, 0.66.
Corn Area planted in 1907 as
returned by township assessors,
2,944,691 acres ; average yield per
acre, 34.7 bushels; total estimat
ed product for 1907, 102,284,045
bushels; put into silo, 4 ; aver
age date cribbing began, Octo
ber 31.
Clover Area sown in 1906 cut
for, seed,. 47 5 average yield per
acre, 1.02 bushels.
Apples-Probable total yield
compared with an average, 21.
Tobacco Probable average
product per acre, 910 pounds.
Cattle-Number being fed tor
spring market compared with last
vear. 62.
Sheep Number being iea ior
mutton compared with last year,
66.
Wheat shows a decline ot W
in condition from the estimate is
sued by this Department one
month ago, being now reported
t. 80 compared with an aver
age. This unsatisfactory condi
tion is due principally to the fact
that a greater percentage of the
wheat ground was seeded unus
uallv late, and . weather condi
tinna following the seeding were
unfavorable to its growth. Of
the 88 counties of the state but
two now report its condition as
iual to an .average; 14 counties
estimate its condition at 90 or
better, while for the balance of

the counties the estimates range
from 50 to 89. The damage re
ported by Hessian fly and other
insects is less than 2.
This is the first report of the
year estimating corn production
in bushels and shows that the
average yield per acre, 34.7 bu
shels, is almost 7 bushels per acre
less than last year. The total
production for the state as a
whole is estimated at 102,284,045
bushels, being approximately
25,000,000 bushels short of the
harvest of 1906 as returned by
the township assessors.
The quality of the crop is far
below an average, the correspon
dents generally noting the fact
that a large percentage is soft
and unmerchantable.
Apples are practically a failure,
the report showing that the pro
bable total jield is but 21 com
pared with an average.
The number of cattle being fed
for spring markets is estimated
at 62 compared with last year.
Our Hoosier Budget.
Portland, Ind., Dec. 9, 1907.
The great dredge of the Sala
monie river was completed last
week. It was the greatest dredge
contract in the Hoosier state and
we will not now dread to see a
cloud come up for fear of a flood.
The river channel is now twenty
feet wide and five feet deeper.
But the dredging spoilt our old
swimming hole and the place we
used to catch the little fishes.
Now our city has good sewerage
and twentyone squares of brick
streets completed.
Now we are getting private
ips on politics. A little over six
months hence there will be a Re
publican national convention held
and C. W. Fairbanks will be
here with both feet. We wrote
sometime ago of Bryan's assa-
nine predictions, and now we no
tice in one of his recent speeches
that he wants to adopt the don
key as the Democratic emblem,
to offset the teddy bear.
Our congressman, Adair, has
presented three bills already in
the House; one is to equalize wi
dows' pensions, the others are
mere bosh.
We are having nice weather
over here now and the farmers
are out in their cornfields every
morning early. Some have start
ed the shredder and one man in
Jay county had his fingers badly
hurt. But so far the shotgun
beats the shredder in this state.
TTT - .1 I m
wereaa 01 several young men
being carried home to their moth
ers killed or maimed. Oh, how
sad, and they all knew the gun
was loaded. But a3 yet we have
not heard of a dog being shot.
Health is good in our city and
the children are in school learn
ing the rules of football and bas
ketball. The three R's of olden
time can wait. You can take
- i 1 J 1 A
some 01 we graduates OI our
schools, get them a position in a
grocery store and when a coun
try woman comes in with a few
dozen eggs, see him grab a pad
and pencil to figure up the hen
fruit at 24c per dozen. No won
der the Japs want to enter our
schools! No wonder so many
college graduates are working at
ten dollars a week I ; His educa
tion is not of the practical kind.
When I see such specimens I feel
ike going to North Dakota to
cool off, or to a gypsy funeral to
quiet my risibility.
Our big meetings have done
some good in warming up some
of the members, and .there were
quite a number of accessions to
the several churches.
Some of our young people want
to get married and some want
connubial obligations severed in-
stanter. Well, this is natural.
Some people want to live always
and some to shuffle off this mor
tal coil; some people want the
world and to boss it, like Joe
Foraker; a Democrat that can
read wants office ! Oh, the wants
of the people are numerous. We
want Santa Claus and long for
the old swimming hole and "the
old oaken bucket that hung in
the well."
Ofttimes when we pick up the
Journal our mind reverts back to
times before the Civil war, when
paregoric and calomel was the
armament of the country doctor.
It was Dr. Curtis Otwell who
took us successfully through
teething, measles, mumps, pur-
tusis, and mayhap, the scabbies,
in our childhood. We often think
of our schoolmates, some of whom
have passed away, and a few are
still living who are reminded of
the "Darke County Boy'' when
they read our budget..
