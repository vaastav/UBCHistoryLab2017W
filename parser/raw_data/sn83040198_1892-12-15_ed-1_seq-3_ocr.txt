CHAPTER X. CONTINUED.
Clarimond smil$. very coldly. "If
you bad chosen to dwell here in peace,
you would have had slight cause to com
plain of tyranny. As it is, your con
ianuetl sojourn is one of sufferance
-lone."'
"Sufferance!" gasped the princess.
"Precisely. You came here with two
motives. The first was to pit yourself
against faiths and principles of mine
which are a part of mv very life. The
second was to try and force me into a
marriage of the merest loveless conven- j
lion. The weapons you have used in i
either case were the same that dealt ;
my dcd father the keenest grief, and
perhaps drove him prematurely to his
grave. fYours, madam, is a stormy and
Crneulest spirit. I inherit nothing of
it, but gossibly I inherit from you alone
the strcfcgth of will which too long has
clothed itself in forbearance. That
strength of will you chall now have a
chance to test. As I said, you will be
watched. Being the lady highest of
ran'.' in my kingdom, I will accord you
the right of receiving my guests on
Thursday. But if the least sign of dis
courtesy is shown by you toward any
guc.-t v. ho crosses the threshold of my
palaee. on the morrow yon shall be con
ducted where the turbulence and rebel
lion of your disposition may boil and
foment to the discomfort of others rath
er than my own. There, now, I think
it is all quite plain between us."
"Quite plain!" muttered the princess.
""Yes, I see I see. You wish to crowd
your rooms with vulgarians."
"You need not gaze urxm those vul
garians unless you so desire. Certainly
a number of people whom you will rate
as vulgarians will present themselves.
Among these will be a young lady an
American, or an Anglo-American, I
might more truly call her with whom
I shall open the ball, ller name is
Kathleen Kennaird, and I shall dance
the first quadrille with her. She is the
most beautiful woman I have ever seen,
the most beautiful I would ever expect
"to see. though I should live two lives in
stead of one. But were she a hunch
back negress, fresh from Africa in her
beads and warpaint, it need matter
nothing either to you or those assem
bled. I am master; I am king. For
my actions I account to no one save my
self." He passed, with an air of unwonted
but very distant pride, down along the
waxed floor of the spacious saloon. But
she, who had heard him with one or two
convulsive shudders, now gave a kind
of wrathful spring, both hands hanging
clenched at her sides.
"You will account to your emperor!"
she called. "You are not so great as
you vaunt yourself, Clarimond of Sal
travia! You you are just mad enough
to marry this creature. I recall now
that one of your cousins, the king of
Saxony's own nephew, too, disgraced
himself by a low marriage. No doubt
it is in your blood to do such horrible
things. But I will prevent this." The
princess' face glistened with little beads
-of sweat and her eyes were blazing. "I
will go to the emperor at once, I will."
She recoiled, for Clarimond hurried
back toward where she had stood, half
cowo. ing in her frenzy. It seemed to
the princess that perhaps he might
actually mean her some personal vio
lence, though if her mind had proved
less clouded by anger and dismay she
would have realized that from one of
his usually gentle spirit such a course,
in any circumstances, would have been
unthinkable.
All that the king meant to do was to
.seize the bell-rope which a brief while
ago he had desisted from seizing. But
now reaching the spot where it hung
he gave it a strong pull, and almost im
. mediately two footmen, in the royal
livery, answered his summons.
"You sliall go at once to the emperor,"
he said, in a low and very tranquil
voice. "I will give these men orders
for carriages and will see that a special
train is prepared for you the instant you
reach "
"No, no," broke hoarsely from the
princess. "Send them away! I I did
not mean what I said." In a trice she
had grown piteously humble. "I I
was more than half in joke, my dear
Clarimond:" and a little pathetic jet of
laughter broke from her lips, like an
effete spirit from a ruined fountain.
The Icing looked at her with great
steadiness for a second or two. "As you
wish," he then said, and gave a sign of
dismissal to the two servants, who
promptly vanished.
The princess had indeed puUed in
sail. Her son had seemed to her, dur
ing the few past minutes, like a rock
against which she would only waste
her strength in vain. Besides, she was
immeasurably proud of his kingship,
and would have suffered untold regret
if the emperor had presumed to attempt
his deposition! It was all quite clear
to her mind in this brief interval; she
Jiad gone too far. She might have
known that the lion in him would sud
denly ttfrVn on her like this. He would
keep the very letter of his menace, too,
unless bcr tactics were changed forth
with. Revolting in their democracy
though she held his views to be, here
after she must conform to them or leave
these lovely Saltravian hills. And sure
ly she was quartered here in a most
magnificent way. Her two or three
Italian palaces were nothing to this, in
which so lordly a suite of chambers had
been allowed her. And then this en
chanting vaUey, so radiantly improved
in spite of all her grumblings to the con
trary! And the waters, too; she had no
idea of the wondrous good they would
do her rheumatism. It might aU get
stupid in the winter, but the winter
was still a good distance off. Time
enough to slip off to Rome or Naples
again by the end of November. And
then there was Biancu dHste. The
girl's love for her son was now almost a
madness. For that most seemly of
unions there was yet a hope. Yes, a
ncpe way not? "School yourself,

Even roughly to put in words the sidrs had she not alreadv learned that
lightning-like reflections of Clarimond's
mother makes them seem deliberative,
not intuitive, as they surely were.
When she again confronted her son,
after the departure of the footmen, it
was to show, both in speech and mien, a
meekness and complaisance that she
had never remotely hinted until now.
"Henceforth you shall have no furth
er cause for complaint," she said; "I
shall abet you in all your plans and
purposes. Try me, and yon shall not
be disappointed. I admit myself thor
oughly vanquished. Your will is my
law."
She bowed her head, and Clarimond,
who knew her better than she knew
herself , smelt deceit as if it were some i
odor that suddenly had freighted the
an. At the same time his native gener
osity and fair-mindedness made him
hope this abrupt conversion meant
more than its first blush would imply.
"Agreed, then," he said, with a re
serve that expressed patience and sad
ness interblent "But pray bear in
mind one matter. If the emperor should
have the presumption, which I greatly
doubt, to concern himself in any of
my personal affairs, however important
or however trivial, I should as promptly
resent such meddling as though it were
the work of an officious subject.
Though my answer should cost me my
scepter, slight a one as it is, be assured
that I should not hesitate to make it,
and make it firmly. I am not so enam
ored of reigning that the empcror'3
frowns or smiles can appeal to me as
such mighty forces of my own destiny,
nor shall 3ou ever find me in the mood
to regard him as if he were a school
master with a birchen rod. And now,"
he proceeded, "I shall ask you kindly
to send me the list cf those whom you
have already invited to the state balL
Such a course on your part will enable
me to avoid errors which might other
wise occur, since I wish to make out a
list of my own, and desire that it should
not clash with yours."
"It shall be sent yon to-night," was
the reply, "or to-morrow, if you pre
fer." "To-morrow will be quite early
enough," answered Clarimond, and with
a bow he quitted the great, bright-lit
vacant apartment, ending an interview
which was least agreeable of the many
which he had held with his mother, and
which had perhaps caused him more
secret pain than any which he at all
had held since his accession to the Sal
travian throne.
CHAPTER XL
The court was already furnished with
rich material for busiest gossip; but a
few more morrows were destined to
cast in shade even so pregnant a topic
as Clarimond's cogent reprimand of
! Prince Philibert. The king had been
I seen publicly strolling through his own
grounds with Kathleen; he now as pub
licly visited her at the hotel, spending
; hours each day in the pretty sitting
j room which Mrs. Kennaird at once se
cured for his own and her daughter's
comfort, as downstairs they would al
most have been mobbed by gaping for-
j eigners. The mental condition of Mrs.
I Kennaird, at this particular time, was
j one of hysteria, narrowly verging upon
dementia. The king's open admiration
for her child filled her with a feeling
i toward him which might have given
: her, if she could have looked upon her
, self just as she now was, and looked
from normal eyes, many shivers of
shame. She had impulses to fling her
self on her knees before Clarimond, and
press her lips to his hand, telling him
that he was the most godlike being the
. world had ever seen, and that his good
i ness in gi-Hg heed to Kathleen roused
j her deathless maternal gratitude.
The American snob, who is apt to be
the most mettlesome and affirmative of
j all snobs yet recorded, had risen ram
I pant in Kathleen's mother. She could
! not sleep; she could scarcely eat a mor
1 sel, and then did not know of what
i food she partook. At first she had ideas
J of sending to Paris for a robe in which
I to array her child at the state ball.
: Then, after this plan had been vetoed
j by Kathleen, she grew reconciled to the
I idea that the girl might create a more
i striking effect if clad with the utmost
simplicity. After all, let her be attired
in the plainest of white frocks. What
j other beauty in all Saltravia could stand
so trying a test?
i "Yes, it is wiser," she said, excitedly,
to Kathleen. (Of late she had done and
j sai'1 everything excitedly, yet with her
effort to appear self-repressed hardly
better concealed than that of the fugi
tive ostrich.) "My dear, you are quite
right. People will look at you more,
and in so doing they will see you as you
i really are. Besides, it's in far nicer
; taste."
"Oh," said Kathleen, shrugging her
shoulders, "I should like a handsome
gown; what girl in the circumstances
wouldn't? But to telegraph to Worth or
I Felix, and to send either of them money
we could so ill afford! Why, the very
thought of it is pure nonsense, mamma,
as you must be aware."
"I wasn't thinking of the expense,"
replied Mrs. Kennaird, with a little ir
repressible catching of the breath.
"There are certain things one always
can afford."
Kathleen laughed and shrugged her
'. shoulders. "You mean, I suppose, that
j we could go back to Dresden and eeon-
omize more severely than we've yet
done."
"Oh, no; I didn't mean that. I I
didn't mean that in the least" said her
' mother.
Kathleen gave no answer, divining
what had really been meant. If her
mother only knew the actual substance
j of her late conversations with the kingl
They had princip aUy talked of her past
i engagement to Alonzo Lispenard. She
had been very frank; she had told
Clarimond everything and had found in
him a most gracious and friendly listen
er. He had asked her many ouestions,
to all of which she had replied with
thorough candor. As regarded the im
pression that she had made upon him,
she could not doubt that it had been
one of strong fascination. This in it
self was nothing new; most men, under
a certain age, had shown her but one
sort of homage. To have a Icing show
it was entirely novel, and not a little
dizzying. Moreover such a king as he,
filled to his finger-tips with all the
I graces that please women, handsome.
Clarimond was the most honorable man
in his own kingdom? Let people chat
ter, as they undoubtedly were chatter
ing. Among the hotel-residents it was
jealousy, pure and simple. What chief
ly concerned this very agitated lady
was the question of how Alonzo had
thus far acted and of how at any mo
ment he might take it into his head to
act. Here he was, returned to Sal
travia, the bosom friend of the king's
bosom friend. He must have heard
that Clarimond was intensely capti
vated with Kathleen. Everybody was
talking of the affair. Stories had got
afloat that the princess of Brindisi had
already pleaded by letter the interven-
tion of the emperor.
You are so reticent, my dear," she
said to Kathleen one evening at the end
of the king's third visit. "You never
will tell me what he says about Alonzo
to you. Does he not mention him?"
"Rarely, mamma, and then always
with kindness."
"Kindness, m yes."
pursed her lips a little.
Mrs. Kennaird
' They're still
friends, then?"
"Friends? Oh, yes."
"I suppose Alonzo hasn't dared to say
a word against you, Kathleen. Other
wise he'd certainly have relieved him
self of untold spleen, my dear."
"He never carried grudges," the girl j
said, as if her own thought was her sole
auditor.
"Well, even if he didn't! Heaven
knows he had a monopoly of most other
faults!" At this particular time any
praise of Alonzo w
lor some reason
specially nauseous to Mrs. Kennaird.
"And as for keeping silent about us to
the king, why, there isn't the least d ubt
that he'll do so. How would he dare
do otherwise, now that Clarimond has j nrovements. This is at once regarded
become your actual slave." j as OQe of the arguments nut forward
"Mamma! Mamma!" exclaimed Kath- j last SCSsion by Simpson at the instance
leen. "You will make me so ridiculous ; acd unjer the guidance of the cattle
if anyone by chance overhears you in j plutocrats, who are financially inter
these moods." j estej in keeping settlers out of the
moods? I'm excessively reticent! You
are so droll at times, Kathleen! As if
any mother could bear more calmly
than I do the splendid, the unparal- j
leled honor which overhangs you."
Kathleen looked fixedly at the speaker,
With her eyes moistening
" .c dUU ',

her under lip trembling
would not speak like this," she faltered.
"It distresses me sd."
Her mother continued, however, stat
ing that she had not the vaguest doubt
Clarimond would soon startle his court
more keenly than he had dreamed of
startling it before; that Kathleen had
only to wait a little while longer and
the stars would drop ripe and shining
in her lap; that all past annoyance,
mortification, defeat was to end glori
ously in unique triumph.
Kathleenlistened, and then slipped,
as soon as she could, into the privacy of
her own chamber. The king had said J order to retard, if not ultimately' pre
tnat he vould revisit her to-day. There ; vent any legislation. The intruder
was oniy an iiour yet ueiore ine time ox
bis coming. She did not want to see I
him again, and yet she did want to seo
him again. What was it? Did it mean
that he might bring her certain tidings
of Alonzo? Did it mean this? Did it
really mean this? Or was she infected
with the fervor of her mother's over
leaping ambition? Her mother! Tho
sense of that personality, that compan
ionship, so tremendous, so drastic in its
influence, its domination, terrified her.
She looked into her own brain, as it
were, and found there nothing but a
depressing tumult. How would she act
if action should indeed be required of
her? No, no; the need of suh action
would not, could not, come. He, a
king! It was fatuity to dream of what
her mother had so boldly prophesied.
Her hands were at intervals very trem
ulous while she dealt with her toilet;
and once or twice she felt as if she must
desist from it and seek the one sort of
aiu liiul jum meu womu uiive ueci
least to her taste.
But when the king came she received
him with much composure. Her mother
was to-day in visible throes. To Kathleen
her disarray was pathetic. The per
turbed lady gave one or two spasmodic
curtsies which were a mournful travesty
of her usual serene equipoise. She was
so drunk with the heady wine fur
nished by the fact of this fourth royal
visit that exhilaration made her almost
stagger. Clarimond, calm and gentle
manlike as usual, appeared to notice
nothing. "Perhaps," thought Kathleen,
"he is used to such grovelling servility.
Poor mamma, will she ever get out of
the room with a decent grace, she who
has prided herself for years on doing
nothing awkwardly?" 9
But at last the door closed on Mrs.
Kennaird's ducking and cringing figure.
As this happened Kathleen breathed an
audible sigh of relief. The sigh ended
in a feverish laugh, and she said, with
sudden candor, to her guest:
"It's dreadful how you've demoralized
my motner. lou must see, so l men
tion it."
"Demoralized her? I?"
"Oh! then you don't see, monsieur,
mamma isn't accustomed to kings; that
is all."
' 'And are you?" he said with his sweet,
kind smile. They were now seated op
posite one another, and near a large
window that gave one a fine view of the
mountains and a still finer view of hia
white, many-turreted palace.
"No," she answered. "But mamma
Oh! you must have noticed. You're a
royalty, as they call it, and you've

Americans."
He shook his head, smiling." "I have
always thought it rather hard to em
barrass Americans," he replied. "One
in particular," he added; and then his
smile deepened, as he watched her with
a glance full of drollery both frank and
sly.

turned, with a slight shrug, "I am
somehow proof against all surprises.

THE INTRUDERS.
Possibility That the Ope' ln?rth? fhmv
hee strip May Be Uelayed-Oosaip From
ITashioston.
Washington, Dec. 9. The house
committee on Indian affairs held a
meeting and discussed, in a rambling
way, the business before the committee.
Most of the time was devoted to tbe
Cherokee strip bilL
There was a general discussion of its
status and standing-. There was an ef
fort to estimate its chances for passing.
It was decided to await the arrival of
some reports being prepared on the in
truder question, which forms one of
the distinguishing features of the
Cherokee treaty. This provision makes
it imperative on the part of the gov
ernment to remove all intruders from
the home reserve of the Cherokees.
The Cherokees want the intruders re
moved by the government, and care
little about remuneration to the intrud
ers for their improvements. Some mem
bers of the committee insist that the
in traders should receive pay for improve
ments. If they should receive pay as
estimated it would amount to from
500,009 to $1,000,000. These same mem
bers of the committee who are so very
solicitous for the intruders, iasist that
the money that should go to the in-
traders should be taken from the money
paid the Cherokees for the strip They
hold that the improvements will be left
on the land in the home reserve, and
hence belonsr to the Cherokees, and
i, c.,i,i -Vw tknm
As a rebuttal the Cherokees reply
that the intruders have made money
off the lands, and this should be re
garded as full compensation for the im-
strip. The same old, many-headed
monster opposition appeared in the
committee yesterday morning, and how
it will end would, at this time, be folly
tn predict. Chairman Peel stated im
mediately after the meeting that it was
inmossihle to toll or nretiiet what would
be the result of the present session.

he was afraid the opposition forming
; on the intruder provision would prove
I dangerous if not fatal.
lie ventured the opinion that if the
treaty was not ratified as presented to
congress now, the strip would not be
! opened this session, and as the treaty
! expires if not approved by March 4, the
I question would revert to its old status.
I He favors approving the treaty as it is
I submitted. The objection he regards
as technical and intimated that possi
I Y1 u it, was insisted unnn mainlv in
provision conforms to a former treaty
with the Cherokees. '
A communication from the Cherokee
chief states that he hopes to be able to
send two delegates to Washington soon
to confer with the committee and look
after the interests of the Cherokees.
Also a similar communication was re
ceived from the intruders. The full
line of lobby will be on hand in a few
days, when the grand messiah dance
will commence.
The committee decided to call up dur
ing the morning hour, at the first oppor-
! tnnity, the Choctaw and Chickasaw res
j olution. This resolution expresses the
J opinion, for the benefit of the president,
j that the house can see no reason why
j the president should not pay the S3, 000,
i 000 awarded the Choctaws and Chicka
1 saws by a former congress for a shad
i ow title in the Cheyenne and Arapahoe
lands. The reference to this matter in
j the presidents message called forth im-
mediate action on the resolution.
The committee also decided to next
take up the Kickapoo bill. There is
apparently no opposition to this in the
committee, and it is thought it can be
passed at the morning hour under call
of committees. When the Cherokee
bill, however, is reached the committee
on rules will be asked to set apart a day
for its consideration.

Brussels, Dec. 9. In reply to an in
vitation extended to him Pro! Andrews,
of Brown university, an American dele
gate and a personal friend of President
elect Cleveland, made an address to the
monetary conference in which he said
he hoped the idea that America was
bent only upon increasing her national
wealth, and that she was merely acting
as the servile creature of mine owners
would forever be dismissed as being
equally as absurd as the idea that the
I main interest was mainly due to the
distress afflicting1 the American mone
tary system. Continuing he said:
"We have not and are not at present
likely to have a dollar in silver beyond
our needs in the United States. We
have no idea of soliciting any favors
from the people of Europe. What we
desire is as much to Europe's interests
as to ours. We wish to multiply our
trade with the world: to do a vaster
business with China, Japan, and Cen
tral and South America and at the same
time with Europe. This will never be
successfully accomplished so long as
two great groups of nations con
tinue to drift apart. The evils of fluc
tuating exchange which beset England
in her commerce with India we also .ex
perience in our trading with our nearest
neighbors, but we are determined not
to accomplish a desirable end at the
terrible cost of opening a similar chasm
between ourselves and the nations of
Europe."

'HE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Eepabllimi Should Remember That Con
ditions Ckangc.
"It is a condition and not s theory
that confronts us."'. Mr. Cleveland sakl
it, and all the republicans laughed.
They found tbe phrase funny to the
verge of absurdity, ao4 they laughed
over it aad made jokes about it, and
parodied and burlesqued it. And so
they had a great deal of fun with it
for a tbaae. It was only for a time,
however; and not a very long time at
that. We would not for a moment
deny that our estimable president-elect
occasionally lets down the tail-board of
the dictionary in places where, to our
own taste, a severer simplicity of lan
guage would be preferable. It may be
that there is rotundity and a pon
derosity abou this particular sentence
that makes it amusing to those who
are easily amused. But, like most of
Mr. Cleveland's utterances, it has a
large amount of horse sense behind it,
and it wears uncommonly well. This
is shown by tbe fact that it is a con
siderably more effective and punsrent
statement to-day than it was when Mr.
Cleveland first made it.
Mighty funny, wasn't it, gentlemen?
Mr. Cleveland stood up and said:
"Look here, things are not going the
way they ought to go. Here's a heavy
war tariff tax taking the pennies out
of hard working people's pockets, and
a lot of tbe loosest kind of legislation
using extravagant river and harbor
bills and dishonest pension bills to rob
the government revenues of dollars and t
millions of dollars. This sort of thinj?
is all wrong-. It is wrong in itself and
it breeds other kinds of wrong. It
needs reform and it needs it imme
diately. It isn't a thing to fool
with or to falter with or to
dawdle about, vjt ought to be put
right at once. There is no need of any
fine talk about the matter no need of
any metaphysical argument the thing
is as plain as the nose on your face. In
fact, it is a condition and not a theory
that confronts us."
You thought that was mighty funny.
and you laughed at it. Well, where is
the laugh now? No, we are not trying
to rub it in, to exult over your defeat,
or to be mean about it in am- way. We
simply ask you to speak up fair and
square and admit that Mr. Cleveland
was right about it, and that you might
have been better employed than in
laughing at him. You may be repub
licans, but you are, we hope, first of
all, and most of all, Americans. Now,
if yon really think to-day that Mr.
Cleveland was talking with his mouth
only, and not with his heart and his
brain, when he told you that the busi
ness system on which the government
of this country is being run was both
dishonest and dangerous, just step up
and explain why you think so: and
show what reason you have for your
belief. Here is Mr. Cleveland coming
back to office to meet a treasury deficit
of no human being knows how much.
He told you that such a condition of
affairs was threatened. Such a condi
tion of affairs exists to-day, and was
brought about under your own man
agement and in the pursuance of your
own theories. You laughed heartily
at Mr. Cleveland's clumsy phrase.
Well, what is it that confronts you
now a condition or a theory? What
do you call a treasury deficit, anyhow?
You made it. Are you proud of it?
You know perfectly well hat the gov
ernment was collecting more money
than it had any rational or decent use
for. You know perfectly well that
millions upon millions of the money
thus collected was paid out to satify
fraudulent pension claims not to help
honest, deserving, patriotic soldiers,
but to bribe worthless sneaks, who
neve smelt powder, to vote for your
party and your pensions. Now, is that
so, or isn't it so? If it isn't so, let us
hear from yow. We don't believe that
you can show us one township in the
United States where some rascal is not
drawing a pension who never got or
could have been got by any human
power within sight or hearing of the
rebel forces who threatened the unitv
. . , . j
of our nation. On such rascals, and on
the dishonest contractors who live on
government building and dredging ap
propriations, you have squandered the
money collected from the people, cent
by cent, dime by dime, dollar by dol
lar; not exactly without warrant of
law, but with the thinnest kind of war
rant ever devised by legislative inge
nuity. It is a condition and not a theory that
confronts you. if you are good Amer
icans you will face it frankly. Own up
to the fact that long years of prosper
ity have made you selfish, self-conceited
and disreg-ardful of the people's
needs and wishes. And then chip in
and help the people that have proved
that they are in the right. That's a
hard thing to do, but it's a manly,
Americau sort of thing, and well worth
doing. Put your self-conceit in your
pocket: remember, like the poor old
prize-fighter, that if you've been licked.
you've been licked bv Americans, and j th record or personality of the presi
rnake up your mind that, if vou cannot ! dent-elect to warrant such an assnmp
help the democrats, you will at least j tlon- Mr. Cleveland has never hown
offer them no hindrance when they set himself subservient to those influences,
out to make the pension-rolls honest which control the average politician,
and honorable, and to wine out the in- Ilis indifference to them has proved the
equalities and unfairnesses of the
tariff legislation which your party has
foisted upon the country to suit its
it's a mean word, but there is no other
customers. Puck.
A DULL DOCUMENT.
roe President Still Harpa I'pou the String;
of Protection.
That portion of the president's mes
sage which is not devoted to a review
of the reports from the several depart
ments of the government is mainly a
laborious and ridiculous argument de
signed to convince the great majority I
of the American people that they did
not know what they were doing when
they voted against the republican
party and the protective tariff thievery.
The very best that may be said of the
message as a whole is that it is a
powerful enunciation of a cardinal
principle of genuine republicanism
hat the people are incapable of self
government and lack the ability to de
termine for themselves what policy of
government is better calculated to ad
vance their prosperity.
The president draws largely on the
advance sheets of Commissioner Por
ter's census reports for figures to prove
that the business, wealth and other
material interests of the country have
enormousiy increased since 1S60. He
peaks of this development and prog
ress as though they had not been fully
understood or properly appreciated by
the people who enjoy the benefits and
blessings which come from them.
He
cites some estimates on the subject of
the tin plate industry, submitted by a
special agent of the treasury depart -
ment, and deduces therefrom tbe
pltaiing- assurance that "if existing
conditions wre to be costUmed" all
the tin plate we could use would bst
produced in tais country art sone in
definite period in the far distant future.
Professing a most solicitous interest
to preserve to our working- pecle"
higher rates of wages than are paid in
Europe, the president quotes, liberally
from "the renert or Labor Commis
sioner Peck, of New York," statistics
showing an increase both in tbe amount
and the rate ef wages paid in the man
ufacturing establishments, of that state
during the year following the passage
of the MeKinley tariff. By resorting
to tbe pages ol a discredited publica
tion, made by a discredited official, for
figures to sustain his "arguments"' tbe
president betrays a lack of decency,
which will occasion great pise
Statistics which it was scarcely per
missible to employ in a letter to a
political conrmittee accepting a pomi
nation for reelection are certainly oat
of place when used in an official com
munication addressed to the congress of
the United States.
Mr. Harrison claims, of course, that
the cause of the prosperity which
the nation has enjoyed for thirty years
is to be found solely in the protective
tariff. "I believe," he says, "that the
protective system has been a mighty
instrnment for the development of our
national wealth and in protecting the
homes of our workingmen from tf!e
occasion of want." Xow that the peo
ple have voted to abolish that system
be expects the most disastrous eonse-
quinces to tollow a change of policy.
ii, nowever. it snaa turn out test nis
foreb odings are unwarranted he carf af
ford to be disappointed.
The president recommends that the
republican majoritv in the senate do
nothing at this session toVard reducing
the tariff, but to refer the whole mat
ter to the next congress, which, he jp
timates, should be convened in extra
session as soon as possible after his
successor comes into office. He renews
his demand for a force bill in order, as
he says, "to secure free and fair federal
elections." and takes final occasion to
deplore the lawVe?s haiicing of negroes
at the south. Chicago Herald.
CONTEMPORARY COMMENT.
If anything is settled by this
election it is that the American people
are not in favor of taxing themselves
to death for the benefit of the tariS
barons. Indianapolis Sentinel.
Mr. Depew says that the repub
lican party will "take higher ground"
in regard to the civil service hereafter.
It could not well get much lower, than
it was when oue hundred and thirty of
President Harrison's office-holders
helped Mr. Depew renominate him.
N. Y. World.
There was a decrease of about
one million dollars in the treasury cash
balance during November, but it is still
large enough to answer all purposes
up to the advent of the next adminis
tration, and that is as far as the repub
licans are interested in th matter St.
Louis Globe-Democrat (reo. ).
Cleveland's triumph means new
freedom and wider scope to American
industry and American enterprise.
Democracy's rule will bring
prosperity to half a thousand interests
that have flourished despite an exor
bitant tariff. It will open new and
i broad fields to Yankee energy. Ubston
Globe.

often possible to learn too late. St.
Louis Republic.
Grove r Cleveland again will ?e
president of the United States. The
manly stand that he took in regard to
the tariff and other economic problems
was not in vain. After a defeat, which
was in reality a triumph, he has been
vindicated by the people of the United

( bility of tariff reform determined in
favor of those who are compeHad to
bear the burden of taxation. Buffalo
Enquirer.
The twenty-fourth president of
the United States will be inaugurated
under conditions of the happiest
auirury. The abiding principles of
political economy will be allowed ac
ceptance by the people. Centralization
of powers in the federal government
I has received a final check. Democracy
has won a victory more abiding, more
conclusive and more satisfactory to the
people of the country than it has
achieved in the century af is exist
ence. Buffalo Times.
It has been predicted that Mr.
Cleveland's second term will contrast
conspicuously with his first term in the
respect that it will be more partisan
j and will follow out more closely the
! Jackson ian idea that to the victor be
longs the spoils. There is nothing in
source of his greatest strength. Kan
sas City Star.
Mr. Cleveland, owing his election
to the popular strength of his cause
and the popular confidence inspired by
his character, is not indebted fr his
succes to any man or set of men. No
gratitude is dne from him except to a
large majority of the American people.
He is free to serve the country accord
ing to tbe dictates of his conscience
and his good sense, entirely unembar
rassed by any sort cf private obliga
tions. No president in American his
tory except Washington could enter
! upon the duties of his high office with '
a prouder sense of independence and a
stronger assurance of being trusted by
the people. Harper's Weekly.
The Plon llutlam
According to Secretary of the Treas
ury Foster, and his sources of informa
tion are the best, there will be a pen
sion deficiency of 530,000,030 to be pro
vided for by the present conirress. and
hereafter to meet the expenditures the
stupendous sum of S350.003.000 will
hare to be provided annually. It would
appear from these figures that the pen
sion sharks have so far overdone he
business as to call for a general over
hauling of the subject by congress.
The door has been opened so wide that
thousands of fraudulent pension claims
have been admitted to the exclusion,
owing to the rush, of hundreds ut mer
itorious claims. The pension list should
be purged of every fraudulent claim.
and every deserving case should receive
prompt attention. The interests of the
1 real soldier entitled to a pension wQl
