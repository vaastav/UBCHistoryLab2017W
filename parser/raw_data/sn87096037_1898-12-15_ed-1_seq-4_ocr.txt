AN odd marriage custom obtains in

it is peopled, earn their living by the
sponge*fisheries. No girl is allowed to
marry until She has brought up a cer

be taken from a certain depth. In
some of the other Greek islands it is
the men who must dive for the sponges.
If there arc several suitors for the hand

LAKE SUPERIOR may lose its distinc

so increases its known area as to make
it a question whether it is not larger

however, before a decision is reached.

Washington. Dec. 5.—Following is the
text of President McKinley's annual
message read at the opening of the last
session of the Fifty-first congress:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives: Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our people
re.iolce in a very satisfactory and steadily
Increasing degree of prosperity evidenced
by the largest volume of business ever re
corded. Manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abun
dant returns, labor in the fields of Industry
Is better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has In
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by its authors, the
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administered and its credit ad
vanced to the lirst rank, while its currency
has been maintained at the world's highest"
standard. Military service under a com
mon Hag and for a righteous cause has
strengthened the national spirit and served
to cement more closely than ever the fra
ternal bonds between every section of the
country. A review of the relation of the
United States to other powers, always ap
propriate, Is this year of primary Impor
tance in view of the momentous Issues
which have arisen, demanding in one in
stance the ultimate determination by arms
and Involving far-reaching consequences
which will require the earnest attention
of the congress.
Tlie War with Spain.
The president begins his history of the
war with a review of the events leading
up to it, in which he cites the suggestions
made in his message on the Cuban subject
one year ago, the destruction of the Maine
and the action of congress up to the adop
tion of the resolution which Spain accepted
as a declaration of war and which caused
the breaking off of diplomatic relations.
War la Declared.
Spain having thus denied the demand of
the United States and initiated that com
plete form of rupture of relations which
attends a state of war, the executive pow
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to mf\ot the enlarged con
tingency of actual war between Spain and
the United States. On April 22 I pro
claimed a blockade of the northern coast of
Cuba, including ports on said coast be
tween Cardenas ar.i Bahia Honda and the
port of Clenfuegos on the south coast of
Cuba and on the E3d I called for volun
teers to execute the purpose of the resolu
tion. By my message of April 25, the con
gress was informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25,
IS'JS,
declaring the
existence of such war, from and including
the 21st day of April, and reenacted the
provision of the resolution of April 20 di
recting the president to use all the armed
forces of the nation to carry that act into
effect. Due notification of the existence of
war as aforesaid was given April 25 by
telegraph to all the governments with
which the United States maintain relations
In order that their neutrality might be as
sured during the war. The various gov
ernments responded with proclamations of
neutrality, each after its own methods
If is Kot among the least gratifying inci
dents of the struggle that the obligations
of neutrality were Impartially discharged
by all, often under delicate and difficult
circumstances.
In further fulfillment of international
duty, I lssi ed April 20 a proclamation an
nouncing the treatment proposed to be
accorded to vessels and their cargoes as
to blockade, contraband, the exercise of
the right of subjects and the immunity of
neutral flags and neutral goods under ene
my's flag. A similar proclamation was
made by the Spanish government. In the
conduct of hostilities the rules of the dec
laration of Paris, Including abstention from
resort of privateering, have accordingly
been observed by both belligerents, al
though neither was a party to that dec
laration.
ltt'»IoiiNe to Cull for Volunteer*.
Our country thus, after an interval o'
half a century of peace with all nation^
found itself engaged in deadly conflict with
a foreign enemy. Every nerve was strained
to meet the emergency. The response to
the initial call for 125,000 volunteers was
Instant and complete, as was also the result
of the second call of Mav 25 for 75,000 ad
ditional volunteers. The ranks of the reg
ular army were increased to the limits
provided by the act of April 26. The enlisted
force of the navy on the 15th of August,
when !t reached its maximum, numbered
24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred
and three vessels were added to the navy
by purchase, one was presented to the
government, one leased, and the four ves
sels of the International Navigation com
pany, the St. Paul. St. Louis, New York and
Paris, were chartered. In addition to these
the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders
were turned over to the navy department
and became temporarily a part of the aux
iliary r.avy.
StrenKtli of the Navy.
The maximum effective fighting force of
the navy during the war. separated into
classes, was as follows: Four battleships
of the first class, one battleship of the sec
ond class, two armored cruisers, six coast
defense monitors, one armored ram, 12
protected cruisers, three unprotected
cruisers. IS gunboats, one dynamite
cruiser, 11 torpedo boats, 14 old vessels of
the old navy, Including monitors. Auxil
iary navy: Auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted
yachts: 27 converted tugs, 19 converted col
liers, 15 revenue cutters, four lighthouse
tenders and 19 miscellaneous vessels.
War Ue venue*.
The national defense under the $50,000,000
fund was expended in large part by the
army and navy and the objects for which
it was used are fully shown In the reports
of the several secretaries. It was a most
timely appropriation, enabling the govern
ment to strengthen its defense and making
preparations greatly needed In case of war
'i his fund being inadequate to the require
ments of equipment and for the conduct of
the war, the patriotism of the congress pro
vided the niear.3 in the war revenue act of
June 13, by authorizing a three per cent,
popular loan not to exceed $400,000,000 and
by levying additional Imposts and taxes.
Of the authorized loan, $200,000,000 were of
fered and promptly taken, the subscrip
tions so far exceeding the call as to cover
It many times over, while, preference bo
Ing given to the smaller bids, no single allot
ment exceeded $5,000. This was a mot en
couraging and significant result, showing
the vast resources of the nation and the
determination of the people to uphold their
country's honor.
llrlcf IllMtory of the AVar.
It is not within the province of this mes
sage to narrate the history of the ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21, but a brief recital
of its more salient features is appropriate.
The fiist encounter of the war in point of
date took place April 27. when a detach
ment of the blockading squadron made a
reconiioissance In force at Matanzas,
shelled the harbor forts and demolished
several new works in construction.
Dewey's Victory.
The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch In maritime war
fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore
George Dewey, had lain for some weeks at
Hong-Kong. Upon the colonial proclama
tion of neutrality being Issued and the
customary 24 hours' notice being given it
repaired to Mirs bay, near Hony-Kong
whence It proceeded to the Philippine is
lands under telegraphic orders to capture
or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet then
assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the
1st
of May the American force entered Ma
nila bay and after a few hours' engage
ment effected the total destruction of the
Spanish fleet, consisting of ten warships
a*-,d a transport, besldeR capturing the
naval station and forts at Cavlte, thus 'in
nlhllatlng the Spanish power In the Pacific
ocean and completely controlling the Bay
of Manila, with the ability to take the city
at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,
the wounded only numbering seven, while
not a vessel was materially injured. For
this gallant achievement the congress, up
on my recommendation, fitly bestowed up
on theactors present permanent and sub
stantial reward.
The effect of this remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon the
fortunes of the war was Instant. A pres
tige of invincibility thereby attached to
our arms, which continued throughout the
struggle. Iteenforceinents were hurried to
Manila under the command of Maj. tac-n.
Murrltt, and llrnily established within flight
of the capital, which lay hclplcsH before
our guns, On the seventh day of .May the
government was advised officially of the
victory of Manila, and at once Inquired of
the commander of our fleet what troops
would b» rwiulrml. Tin- Information was
rucelied on tho lGtli of May, und the lirst
tirmy expedition sailed May 2.1, and ar
rival off Manila June so. Other expidltlons
soon followed, (lie total force COIISINIIHK

and ID,OUT inuii.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at several
exposed points. On May 11, the cruiser
Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow
were unsuccessful In an attempt to silence
the batteries at Cardenas, against Matan
zas, Worth Bagley and four seamen fall
ing. These grievous fatalities were strange
ly enough among the very few which oc
curred during our naval operations in this
extraordinary conflict.
Advance of Cervera's Fleet.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor. A
powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera,
which had assembled at the Cape Verde
Islands before the outbreak of hostilities,
had crossed the ocean and by its erratic
movements In the Caribbean sea delayed
our military operations while baffling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were
felt lest the Oregon and Marietta, then
nnaring home after their long voyage from
San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might
be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet
hut their fortunate arrival dispelled these
apprehensions and lent much needed reen
forcements. Not until Admiral Cervera
took refugo In the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba about May 9 was It practicable to
plan a systematic military attack upon the
Antlllean possessions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurred on the
coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico In prepara
tion for the larger event. On May 13 the
North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan
do Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodore
Schley's squadron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.
Neither attack had any material result. It
was evident that well-ordered land opera
tions were Indispensable to achieve a de
cisive advantage.
Hobsou's Hand of Heroes.
The next act in the war thrilled not alone
the hearts of our countrymen but the world
by Us exceptional heroism. On the night
of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven
devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow
outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Mcrrimac In the chanpel, under a
fierce lire from the shore batteries, escap
ing with their lives as by a miracle, but
falling Into the hands of the Spaniards. It
is a most gratifying Incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of
heroes was cordially appreciated by the
Spaniards, who sent a flag of truce to notify
Admiral Sampson of their safety and to
compliment them on their daring act. They
were subsequently exchanged July 7.
Full of tiuantaiinmo.
By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban
cable Isolated the island. Thereafter the
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10. under a heavy protecting flre, a
landing of 600 marines from the Oregon,
Marblehead and Yankee was effected in
Guantanamo bay, where it had been deter
mined to establish a naval station. This
important and essential port was taken
from the enemy after severe fighting by
the marines, who were the first organized
force of the United States to land In Cuba.
The position so won was held, despite des-
Sune
erate attempts to dislodge our forces. By
16 additional forces were landed and
strongly intrenched. On June 22 the ad
vance of the Invading army tinder Maj.
Gen. Shatter landed at Baiqulri, about 15
miles east of Santiago. This was accom
plished under great difficulties, but with
marvelous dispatch.
The Suntliiuro Cuiupalitu.
On June 23 the movement against San
tiago was begun. On the 24th the first se
rious engagement took place, in which the
First and Tenth cavalry and the First
United States volunteer cavalry, Gen.
Young's brigade of Gen. Wheeler's division,
participated, losing heavily. By nightfall,
however, ground within five miles of San
tiago was won. The advantage was stead
ily Increased. On July 1, a severe battle
took place, our forces gaining the out
works of Santiago: on the second El Caney
and San Juan were taken after a desperate
charge, and the Investment of the city was
completed. The navy cooperated by shell
ing the town and the coast forts.
SinliiiiB of the Spanish Fleet.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3,
occurred the decisive naval combat of the
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the American
squadron under command of Commodore
Sampson. In less than three hours all the
Spanish ships were destroyed, the two
torpedo boats being sunk, and the Maria
Teresa, Almirante Oquenao, Vizcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span
ish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken
prisoners, while the enemy's loss was de
plorably large, some 600 perishing. On
our side but one man was killed, on the
Brooklyn, and one man was seriously
wounded. Although our ships were re
peatedly struck, not one was seriously in
jured. Where all so conspicuously dis
tinguished themselves, from the command
ers to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms, each and all contribut
ing toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a parallel
In the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casualties, it
would be invidious to single out any for
especial honor. Deserved promotion has
rewarded the more conspicuous actors—the
nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all
of those brave men who by their skill and
devotion in a few short hours crushed the
sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness and far-reaching con
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievements
of our builders, mechanics, and artisans
for their skill in the construction of our
warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's
effort upon the ocean virtually ceased A
spasmodic effort toward the end of June
to send her Mediterranean fleet under Ad
miral Camara to relieve Manila was
abandoned, the expedition being recalled
after it had passed through the Suez
canal.
Capture of Santiago.
The capitulation of Santiago followed
The city was closely besieged by land, while
the entrance of our ships Into the harbor
cut oft all relief on that side. After a truce
to allow of the removal of nonconibatants
protracted negotiations continued from
July 3 until July 15, when, under menace
of immediate assault the preliminaries of
surrender were agreed upon. On the 17th
Gen. Shatter occupied the city. The capitu
lation embraced the er.tlre eastern end of
Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers sur
rendered was 22,000, all of whom were sub
sequently conveyed to Spain at the charge
of the tfnlted States.
Uratltude of the Nation.
The story of this successful campaign Is
told in the report of the secretary of war
which will bo lair) before you. The Indi
vidual valor of officers and soldiers was
never more strikingly shown than In the
several engagements leading to the sur
render of Santiago, while the prompt move
ments and successive victories won Instant
and universal applause. To those who
gained this complete triumph, which estab
lished the ascendency of the United States
upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed
our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and
lasting gratitude of the nation is unspar
ingly due. Nor should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle and dis
ease must cloud any exultation at the re
sult and teach us to weigh the awful cost
of war, however rightful the cause or sig
nal the victory.
Occupation of Porto Itlco.
With the fall pf Santiago, the occupation
of Porto Rico became the next strategic
necessity. Gen. Miles had previously beer,
assigned to organize an expedition for that
purpose. Fortunately he was already at
Santiago, where he had arrived on the llth
of July, with reenforcements for Gen.
Shafter's army. With these troops, consist
ing of 3,415 Infantry and artillery, two com
panies of engineers and one company of
the signal corps, Gen. Miles left Guantana
mo on July 21, having nine transports con
voyed by the fleet under Capt. Higglnson,
with the Massachusetts (flagship), JJIxiP,
Gloucester, Columbia and rale, the two
latter carrying troops. The expedition
landed at Guanlca July 25, which port was
entered with little opposition. Here the
fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the
Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphltrite
went to San Juan and joined the New Or
leans, which was engaged Ip blockading
that port. The major general commanding
was subsequently reenforced by Gen.
Schwann's brigade of the Third army
corns, by Gen. Wilson, with a part of his
division, and also by Gen. Brooke, with a
part of his corps, numbering In all 10,973 of
ficers and men. On July 27 he entered
Ponce, one of the most Important ports In
the Island, from which he thereafter di
rected operations for the capture of the
island.
With the exception of encounters with
tlio enemy at Guayama, Henniguerez
Coamo and Yauco, and nil attack on a force
landed at Cape San Juan, there Was no se
rious resistance. The campaign was prose
cuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of
August much of the Island was In our pos
session and the acquisition of the remainder
was only a mattor of a short time. At
most of the points In the Island our troops
were enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta
tions 'if loyalty lo the flag ami gratitude re
delivery from Spanish rule met our com
manders at every stage. As a potent In
fluence toward peace, the outcome of the
Porto lllcan expedition was of great con
sequence, and generous commendation Is
duo to those who participated In It.

lantry in action, the nation is sincerely
grateful. Their long voyage was made
with singular success, and the soldierly
conduct of the men, most of whom were
without previous experience in the military
service, deserves unmeasured praise.
Our Losses.
The total casualties in killed and wounded
In the army during the war was as follows:
Officers killed, 23 enlisted men killed, 257:
total, 2S0 officers wounded, 113: enlisted
men wounded, 1,464: total, 1,577. Of the
navy: Killed, 17 wounded, 07 died as result
of wounds, 1: invalided from service, 6
total, 01. It will be observed that while our
navy was engaged In two great battles and
in numerous perilous undertakings in the
blockades and bombardment and more
tl.ari 50,000 of our troops were transported
to distant lands and engaged In assault
and siege and battle and manv skirmishes
In unfamiliar territory, wo lost In both
arms of the service a total of 1,608 killed and
wounded: and In the entire campaign bv
land and sea we did not lose a gun or it
flag or a transport or a ship, and with the
exception of the crew of the Merrlmac, not
a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.
Tribute to Patriotism.
It is fitting that I should bear testimony
to the patriotism and devotion of tha't
large portion of our army which, although
eager to be ordered to the post of greatest
exposure, fortunately was not required out
side of the United States. They did their
whole duty, and like their comrades at the
front, have earned the gratitude of the
nation. In like manner, the officers and
men of the army and of the navy who re
mained In their departments and stations
of the navy, performing most important
duties connectcd with the war, and whose
requests for aslgnment in the field and at
sea it was compelled to refuse because
their services were Indispensable here, are
entitled to the highest commendation. It
is my regret that there seems to be no pro
vision for their suitable recognition.
Peuce Overture**.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's
fleet, followed by the capitulation of San
tiago, having brought to the Spanish gov
ernment a realizing sense of the hopeless
ness of cfmtinulng
a struggle now becoming
wholly unequal, It made overtures of peace
through the French ambassador, who with
the assent of Ills government, had acted as
the friendly representative of Spanish In
terests during the war. On the 26th of July,
M. Cambon presented a communication
signed by the duke of Almodovar, the Span
ish minister of state, inviting the United
States to state the terms upon which It
would be willing to make peace. On July
30, by a communication addressed to the
duke of Almodovar and handed to M. Cam
bon, the terms of this government were an
nounced, substantially as in the protocol,
afterwards signed. On August 10, the Span
ish reply, dated August 7, was handed by
M. Cambon to the secretary of state. It ac
cepted unconditionally the terms imposed
as to Cuba, Porto Rico and an Island of the
I.adrones group, but appeared to seek to
Introduce Inadmissible reservations In re
gard to our demand as to the Philippines.
Conceiving that discussion on this point
could neither be practicable or profitable, I
directed that in order to avoid misunder
standing the matter should be forthwith
closed by proposing the embodiment in a
formal protocol of the terms in which the
negotiations for peace were to be under
taken. The vague and Inexplicit sugges
tions of the Spanish note could not be ac
cepted, the only reply being to present as a
virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol em
bodying the precise terms tendered to
Spain in our note of July 30, with added
stipulations of detail as to the appoint
ment of commissioners to arrange for the
evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On
August 12 M. Cambon announced his re
ceipt of full powers to sign the protocol
so submitted. Accordingly, on the after
noon of August 12, M. Cambon, as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secre
tary of state, as the plenipotentiary of the
United States, signed a protocol, provid
ing:
The Protocol.
"Article 1. Spain will relinquish all claim
of sovereignty over and title to Cuba.
"Article 2. Spain will cede the United
States the Island of Porto Rico and other
islands now under Spanish sovereignty in
'.he West Indies, and also an island In the
Ladrones, to be selected by- the United
"Article 3. The United States will oc
cupy and hold the city, bay and harbor of
Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty
of peace which shall determine the con
trol, disposition and government of the
Philippines."
The fourth article provided for the ap
pointment of joint commissions on the part
of the United Stales and Spain to meet In
Havana and San Juan, respectively, for
the purpose of arranging and carrying out
the details of the stipulated evacuation of
Cuba, Porto Rico and other Spanish Is
lands In the West Indies.
The fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not more than five commis
sioners on each side, to meet at Paris not
later than October 1, and to proceed to
the negotiations and conclusions of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratification ac
cording to the respective constitutional
forms of the two countries.
The sixth and last article provided that
upon the signature of the protocol hos
tilities between the two countries should be
suspended, and that notice to that effect
should be given as soon as possible by
each government to the commanders of Its
military and naval forces.
Hostilities Suspended.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the
protocol I issued a proclamation of August
12, suspending hostilities on the part of the
United States. The necessary orders to
that end were at once given by telegraph.
The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San
Juan de Porto Rico was In like manner
raised. On August 18 the muster out of
100,000 volunteers, or as near that number
as was found to be practicable, was or
dered. On December 1 101,165 officers an
men had been mustered out and discharged
from the service, 9,002 more will be mus
tered out by the 10th of the month. Also
a corresponding number of generals and
general staff officers have been honorably
discharged from the service.
Hrncuutlon Commission.
The military committees to superintend
the evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and the
adjacent islands were forthwith appointed.
For Cuba, Maj. Gen. James F. Wade, Rear
Admiral William T. Sampson, Maj. Gen.
Matthew C. Butler for Porto Rico, Maj.
Gen. John C. Brooke, Rear Admiral Win
tield S. Schley, Brig. Gen. W. Gordon, who
soon afterwards met the Spanish commis
sioners at Havana and San Juan, respect
ively. The Porto Rtcan joint commission
speedily accomplished Its task, and by Oc
tober 18 the evacuation of the island' was
completed. The United States flag was
raised over the Island at noon on that day
The administration of Its affairs has been
provisionally Intrusted to a military govern
oruntil thecongress shall otherwise provide.
The Cuban joint high commission has not
yet terminated its labors. Owing to the
difficulties in the way of removing the large
numbers of Spanish troops still In Cuba
the evacuation cannot be completed before
the 1st of January next.
Prace Commission Named.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the
protocol, I appointed William R. Day,
lately secretary of state Cushman K.
Davis, William P. Frye and George Gray,
senators of the United States, and White
law Reld to be the peace commissioners on
the part of the United States. Proceed
ing in due season to Paris, they there met
on the 1st of October flve commissioners
similarly appointed on the part of Spain.
The negotiations have made hopeful prog
ress, so that I trust soon to be able to
lay a definitive treaty of peace before the
senate, with a review of the step3 leading
to Its signature.
Our New Possessions.
1 do not discuss at this time the govern
ment or the future of the new possessions
which will come to us as the result of the
war with Spain. Such discussion will he ap
propriate after the treaty of peace shall be
ratified. In the meantime and until the
congress has legislated otherwise, It will
be .*n.v duty to continue the military gov
ernments which have existed Blnce our oc
cupation and guarantee the people se
curity in life and property and encourage
ment under a Just and beneficent rule. As
soon as we are in possession of Cuba and
have pacified the island, it will be necessary
to giveaid ar,d direction to its people to form
a government for themselves. This should
be undertaken at the earliest moment con
sistent with safety and assured success. It
is important tiiat our relations with these
people shall be of the most friendly char
acter and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist In every proper way to build up the
waste places oi the Island, encourage the
industry of the people and assist them to
form a government which shall be free and
Independent, thus realizing tho best as
pirations of the Cuban people. Spanish
rule must be replaced by a Just, benevolent
ar.d humane government, created by the
people of Cuba, capable of performing all
international obligations arid which shall
encourage thrift. Industry and prosperity,
whatever mny have been their will among
Mil
of tho Inhabitants, whatever may have
been their relations In the past. Neither
icvenge nor passion should have a place In
the new government. Until there Is com
plete tranquillity In the Island and a stable
government Inaugurated military occupa
tion will be continued.

project that has for so many years en
grossed the attention of the respective
countries.
As the scope of recent inquiry embraced
the whole subject, with the aim of making
plans and surveys for a canal by the most
convenient route, it necessarily Included a
review of the results of previous surveys
and plans, and in particular those adopted
by the Maritime Canal company under Its
existing concessions from Nicaragua and
Costa llica, so that to this extent those
grants necessarily held an essential part
in the deliberations and conclusions of the
canai commission as they have held and
must needs hold in the discussion of the
matter-by the congress. Under these cir
cumstances and in view of overtures made
to the governments of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica by other parties for a new
canal concession predicted on the as
sumed approaching lapse of the contracts
of the Maritime Canal company with those
states, 1 have not hesitated lo express my
conviction that considerations of expedi
ency and international policy, as between
the several governments Interested in the
construction and control of an lnter
oeeunic canal by tills route require the
maintenance of the status quo, until the
canai commission shall have reported and
the United Slates congress shall have had
the opportunity to pass finally upon the
whole matter during the present session,
without prejudice by reason of any change
in ihe existing conditions.
Nevertheless it appears that the govern
ment of Nicaragua, as one of its last sover
eign acts before merging Its powers in
those of the newly-formed United Slates
of Central America, has granted an option
al concession to another association, lo be
come effective on the expiration of the
present grant. It does not appear what
surveys have been made, or what route Is
proposed under this contingent granted, so
that an examination of the feasibility it
its plans is necessarily not embraced in the
report of the canal commission. All these
circumstances suggest the urgency of
some definite action by the congress at
this session, if the labors of the past are to
be utilized and the Unking of the Atlantic
and,Pacific oceans by a practical water
way is to be realized. That the construc
tion of such a maritime highway Is now
more than ever Indispensable to that Inti
mate and ready Intercommunication be
tween our eastern and western seaboards
demanded by the annexation of the Ha
waiian islands and the prospective ex
pansion of our influence and commerce to
Pacific, and that our national policy now
more imperatively than ever calls for its
control by this government, arc proposi
tions which I doubt not the congress will
duly appreciate and wisely act upon.
Puris Exposition.
There Is now every prospect that the
participation of the United States in the
universal exposition to be held in Paris In
1900 will he on a scale commensurate with
the advanced position held by our products
and industries in the world's chief marts.
The preliminary report of Moses P. Handy,
who under the act approved July 19, 1S'J7.
v:as appointed special commissioner, with
a view to securing all attainable informa
tion necssary to a full and complete under
standing by congress In regard to the par
ticipation of this government In the Paris
exposition, was laid before you by my mes
sage of December 6, 1897, and showed the
large opportunities opened to make known
rur national progress in arts, science and
manufactures, as well as the urgent need
of Immediate and adequate provision to
enable due advantage thereof to be taken.'
Mr. Handy's death soon afterwards ren
dered It necessary for another to take up
and complete his unfinished work, and on
January 11 last Mr. Thomas W. Cridler,
third assistant secretary of state, was des
ignated to fulfill that task. His report was
laid before you by my message of June 14,
1S98, with the gratifying result of awaken
ing renewed Interest in the projected dis
play. By r. provision In the sundry civil
appropriation act of July 1, 1898, a sum not
to exceed $050,000 was allotted for the or
ganization of a commission to care for the
proper preparation and Installation of
American exhibits, and for the display of
suitable exhibits by the several executive
departments, particularly by tho depart
ment of agriculture, the fish commission
and the Smithsonian institution, In the rep
resentation of the government of the
United States.
Pursuant to that enactment 1 appointed
Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of Chicago, com
missioner-general, with an assistant com
missioner-general and secretary. Mr. Peck
at once proceeded to Paris, where his suc
cess in enlarging the scope and variety of
the United States exhbit has been most
gratifying. Notwithstanding the compar
atively limited area of the exposition site
-less than one-half of the world's fail at
Chicago—the space assigned to the United
States has been increased from the abso
tute allotment of 157,403 square feet re
ported by Mr. Handy to some 202,000 square
feet, with corresponding augmentation ot
the field for a truly characteristic represen
tation of the various important branches
of our country's development. Mr. Peck's
report will be laid before you. In my judg
ment its recommenaations will call for
your early consideration, especially as re
gards an Increase of the jppropriatlon to
at least $1,000,000 In ill. so that not o^ly
may the assigned space be fully taken up
by the best possib.e exhibitor in every
class, but the preparation and installa
tion be on so perfect a scale as to rank
among the first In that unparalleled com
petition of artistic and inventive produc
tion and thus counterbalance the disadvan
tage with which we start, as compared with
other countries whose appropriations are
on a more generous scale and whose prep
arations are in a state of much greater for
wardness than our own.
On Friendly Footing.
Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing. As
senting to our request, the protection of
Americans and their interests In Spanish
jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic
and consular representatives of Great
Britain, who fulfilled their delicate and
arduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting
high commendation. I may be allowed to
make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr
Kamsden, her majesty's consul at Santiago
de Cuba, whose untimely death after dis
tinguished service and untiring effort dur
ing the siege of that city was sincerely
lamented.
The Canadian Negotiations.
li will give me especial satisfaction It 1
shall be authorized to communicate to you
a favorable conclusion of the pending ne
gotiations with Great Britain in respect
of the dominion of Canada. It Is the ear
nest wish of this government to remove "all
sources of discord and Irritation in our
relations with the neighboring dominion.
The trade between the two countries is
constantly Increasing, and It is Important
to both countries that all reasonable fa
cilities should be granted for its develop
ment.
Annexation of Han-all.
Pending the consideration by the senate
of ihe treaty signed June 16, 1S97, by the
plenipotentiaries of the United States and
of the republic of Hawaii, providing for the
annexation of tho islands, a Joint resolution
to accomplish the same purpose by accept
ing the- offered concession and Incorporat
ing the ceded territory inio the union was
adopted by the congress and approved
July 7, ISiS. 1 thereupon directed the
United States steamer Philadelphia to
con
vey Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu, and
entrusted to his hands this important leg
islative act, to be delivered to the presi
dent of the republic of Hawaii, with whom
the admiral and the United States minis
ter were authorized to make appropriate
arrangements for transferring the sover
eignty of the islands to the United States.
This was simply but Impressively accom
plished on the 12th of August, last, by the
delivery of a certified copy of the resolu
tion to President Dole, who thereupon
yielded up to the representative of the gov
ernment of the United States the sover
eignty and public property of the Hawaiian
islands.
Pusuant to the terms of the joint resolu
tion and in exercise of the authority there
by conferred upon me, I directed that the
civil, judicial and military powers there
tofore cxerelsed by the officers of the gov
ernment of the republic of Hawaii should
continue to be cxerclsed by those officers
until congress shall provide a government
for Ihe incorporated territory, subject to
my power to remove such officers and to till
vacancies. The president, officers and
troops of the republic thereupon took the
oath of ulleglance to the United States,
thus providing for the uninterrupted con
tinuance of all the administrative and
municipal functions of the annexed terri
tory until congress shall otherwise enact
Following the further provision of the
Joint resolution I appointed Hon. Shelby
M. Cullom, of Illinois John T. Morgan, of
Alabama Robert R. Hitt, of Illinois: San
ford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F.
Grear, of Hawaii, as commissioners to con
fer and recommend to congress such legis
lation concerning the Hawaiian islands as
they should deem necessary or proper. The
commissioners having fulfilled the mission
confided to them their report will be laid
before you at an early day. It Is believed
that their recommendations will have the
earnest consideration due to the magnitude
of the responsibility resting upon you to
give such shape to ihe relationship of those
mld-Paclllc lands to our home union as will
benefit both In the highest degree, realizing
the aspirations of the community that has
cast its lot with us and elected to share our
political heritage, while, at the same time
justifying tho foresight of those who for
three-quarters of a century have looked to
tho assimilation of Hawaii as a natural
and Inevitable consummation, In harmony
with our needs and In fulfillment of our
cherlahi'd traditions..
The questions heretofore pending be
tween Hawaii and Japan, growing out of
the alleged mistreatment of Jupunese
treaty Immigrants, were, 1 am pleased to
say, adjusted before the act of transfer by
the payment of a reasonable Indemnity to
tin- government of Japan.
Under the provisions of the Joint resolu
tion the existing customs relutlons of the
Hawaiian Islands with the United States

States consulate at Honolulu Is maintained
for all proper services peitaining to trails
and the revenue. It would be desirable that
all foreign consuls In the Hawaiian islands
should receive new exequateurs from this
government.
Our Flnnuci'H.
The secretary of the treasury reports
that the receipts of the government from
all sources during the fiscal year ended
June 30. 1SH8, Including TK4,7r.l,223, received
from sale of Pacific railroads, ammounted
to $405,321,335 and Its expenditures to $443.
36S,5t2. There was collected Trom cus
toms $149,575,062 and from Internal revenue
$170,000,641. Our dutiable imports amount
ed to $324,735,479, a decrease of $5S,15O.0|i0
over the preceding year, and importations
free of duty amounted to $2111.414,175. a de
crease from the preceding year of $90,
524.l'KS. Internal revenue receipts exceeded
those of the preceding year by $24,212,068.
The total tax collected on distilled spirits
was $92,54ti,999, on manufactured tobacco
$36,230,522, and on fermented liquors $39,
515,421. We exported merchandise during
the vear amounting to $1,231,482,330, an In
crease of $180,488, 74 from the preceding
vear. It is estimated upon the basis of
present revenue laws that the receipts of
the government for the year ending June
30, 18119, will be $577,874,007 and its expendi
tures $6S9.!74,647, resulting in a deficiency
of
$112,000,000.

Gold in the Treasury.
On the 1st of December, 1S9S, there was
held In the treasury gold coin amounting
to $138,441,547, gold bullion amounting to
$13S,502,545, silver bullion amounting to
193,359,250, and other forms of money
1 amounting to $451,963,981. On the same date
the amount of money of all kinds In cir
culation or not included in treasury hold
I ings, was $1,836,879,504, an increase for the
year of $165,794,966. Estimating our popu
latlon at 75,194,000 at the time mentioned
the per capita circulation was $25.09. On
I the same date there was In the treasury
gold bullion amounting to $13S,502,545.
I The provision made for strengthening
I the resources of the treasury in connection
I with the war has givsn increased conll
dence In the purpose and power of the gov
ernment to maintain the present standard,
I and has established more firmly than ever
tlie national credit at home and abroad. A
marked evidence of this is found In the In
flow of gold to the treasury. Its net gold
holdings on November 1, 189S, were $239,885,
160 as compared with $153,573,147 on Novem
ber 1, 1897, and an Increase of net cash of
$207,756,100, November 1, 1S97. to $300,238,275
November 1. 1898. The present ratio of net
treasury gold outstanding government lia
bilities, Including United States treasury
notes of 1890, silver certificates, currency
certificates, standard silver dollars, and
silver coin, November 1, 1898, was 25.35 per
cent, as compared with 16.96 per cent. No
vember 1,1897.
It cco in men da Ion lien wed.
I renew so much of my recommendation
of December, 1S7, as follows: '-Tnat
when any of the United States notes are
piosented for redemption in gold and are
redeemed In gold, such notes shall be kept
ar.d set apart and only paid out in exchange
for gold. This is on obvious duty. if
tl holder of the United States note pre
fers the gold and gets it from the govern
ment, he should not receive baclr from
the government a United States nott with
out paying gold in exchange for il. Tho
rea?on for this Is made all the more ap
parent when the government issues an in
terest-bearing debt to provide gold lor the
redemption of United States notes—u non
interest-bearlng debt. Surely it should not
pay them out again except on demand and
for gold. If they are put out In any other
way they may return again, to be followed
by another bond issue to redeem them
—another interest-bearing debt to re
deem a non-ir.terest-bearlr.g debt." This
hecominendatlon was made in the belief
that such provisions of law would Insure
to a greater degree the safety of the pres
ent standard and better protect our cur
rency from the dangers to which it is
subjected from a disturbance in the gen
eral business conditions of the country.
Other Currency I.eK'tslatlon Needed.
In my judgment the present condition of
the treasury amply justifies the immedi
ate enactment of the legislation recom
mended one year ago, under which a por
tion of the gold holdings should be placed
in a trust fund from which greenbacks
should be redeemed upon presentation, but
when once redeemed should not thereafter
be paid out except for go'd. It Is not to
he inferred that other legislation relating
to our currency is not required on the
contrary there is an obvious demand for
it. The importance of adequate provision
which will insure to our future a money
standard related as cur money standard
now and to that of our commercial rivals
Is generally recogniztd. The companion
proposition that our domestic paper cur
rency shall be kept safe and yet be so re
lated to the needs of our industries and
internal commerce as to be adequate and
responsive to such needs is a proposition
scarcely less Important. The subject, In all
lt3 parts. Is commended lo the wise con
sideration of the congress.
The Standing Army.
Under the act of congress approved
April 26, 1898, authorizing the pres.uent in
his discretion, upon a declaration of war
by congress, or a declaration by congress
thai war exists, I directed the Increase
of the regular army lo the maximum of
62,000, authorized in said act. There are
now in the regular army 57,862 officers and
men. In said act It was provided "that
at the end of any war in which the United
States may become involved the army shall
be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer
in the same arm of service or absorption
by promotion or honorable discharge un
der such regulations as ihe secretary of
war may establish of supernumerary com
missioned officers and ihe honorable dis
charge or transfer of supernumerary en
listed men: and nothing contained in this
act shall be construed as authorizing the
permanent Increase of the commissioned
or enlisted force of the regular army be
yond that now provided by the law in
force prior to the passage of this act, ex
cept as to the increase of 25 majors pro
vided for in section 1 hereof."
The importance of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest, and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualified approval. There can be no
question that at this time and probably
for some time in the future, lou.uoo men will
be none too many to meel the necessities
of the situation. At all events, whether
that number shall be required permanently
or not, the power should be given to the
president to enlist that force if in his dis
cretion it should be necessary and the
further discretion should be given him to
recruit within the above limit from the
Inhabitants of the Islands with the gov
ernment of which we are charged.
It Is my purpose to muster out the en
tire volunteer army as soon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be only
an uct of Justice and will be much appre
ciated by the brave men who left their
homes and employments to help the coun
try In its emergency.
The PuclUc Hallways,
In my last annual message I stated: "The
Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold
under the decree of the United States court
for the district of Nebraska, the 1st and
2nd of November of this year. The amount
due the government consisted of the prin
cipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,230,512 and
the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,511.07
making the total Indebtedness $58,4:8,223 75'
The bid at the sale covered the first mort
gage lien and the entire mortgage claim of
the government, principal and interest
This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon
cluded. By a decree of the court in that
case an upset price for the property was
fixed at a sum which would yield to the
government only $2,500,000 upon its lien
Tlie sale at the instance of the government
was postponed first to December
uP°n
15. 1897
the
application of the
United States was postponed to Februarv
1G, 1898. Having satisfied myself that the
Interests of the government required that
an effort should be made to obtain a larcer
sum I directed the secretary of the treas
ury, under the act passed March 3. 1SS7, to
pay out of the treasury to the persons en
titled to receive the same the amounts due
"Pon all prior mortgages upon the eastern
and middle divisions of said railroad out

ney general prepared a petition to be pre
sented to the court offering to redeem said
prior liens in such manner as the court
might direct, and praying that thereupon
the United States might be held to be
subrogated to all the rights of said prior
lien holders and that a receiver mleht b»
appointed to take possession of the mort
gaged premises and maintain and operate
the same until the court or congress other

tion committee agreed that If said petition
was withdrawn and the sale allowed to Dro

at the sale which would realize to the Gov
ernment the entire principal of its debt $0

be obta ned and appreciating
the
difficul­
ties under which the government would
labor If It should become the purchaser of
the road at the sale, In the absence of any
authority by congress to -take charge of

the guaranty of a minimum bid VhI?
