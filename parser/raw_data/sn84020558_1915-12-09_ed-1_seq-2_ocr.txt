BREAKMAN HURT IN
WRECK LAST NIGHT
S. V. Moberly, a hrakeman on the
Arizona Kastern railroad was badly
injured at 10:30 last night when a
f i eight train which had just entered
the local yards, collided with a train
of cars loaded with steel rails which
was standing on a siding between
Seventh and Eighth streets. Moberly
was standing on the end of the caboose
and the train was backing onto the
siding, which was supposed to be clear.
The caboose struck the cars loaded
with steel and was smashed into kind
ling wood, and several of the box cars
next to it were also badly broken up.
Moberly was thrown from the ca
boose as the crash came, and sustained
several bad bruises about the right
shoulder. Following the wreck h was
put into a p issing automobile and tak
en lo the Sister's hospital, where he
received medical attention from Drs.
Wiley and Brockway.
The total value of the cars and track
destroyed will amount to several thou
sand dollars.

SAYS MEDITERRANEAN SHOULD .
BE IDE A CLOSED SEA
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LOXDOX, Dec. !). The Morning
Post today gives prominence to a
suggestion by a correspondent that
the Mediterranean be declared a
closed sea and that no ship be al
lowed to trade there without a li
cense from the entente naval authori
ties. The step should be taken, the cor
respondent argues, in an effort to
combat Teutonic submarines which
he declares, are kept supplied with
oil, provisions and torpedoed by neu
tral steamers. He suggests that neu
tral ships on nearing the straight of
Gibraltar- should be given a course
which they would lie required to fol
low without deviation or delay and
says that no neutral ships carrying
oil fuel should be allowed in the
Mediterranean.
"Greek ships are probably- the
worst offenders," says the correspond
ent. "A short time ago one of our
largest transports carrying 6uH0
troops ran close to a Greek ship
which was in the act of supplying
oil to an enemy sumarine off Tunis,
while on an occasion a suspicious oil
tanker was close by when fine of
her transports was sunk and later
was seen exchanging signals with the
submarine."
IHARTO'S WORK GETS
PRAISE IN ECONOMIST
Republican Advertisement for New
York Store Described in Article in
Recent Issue of Magazine
In no uncertain terms, the Dry Goods
Economist, a journal devoted to de
partment store interests, praises the
double-page advertisement recently
prepared by. S. W. Marto of the Xew
Yolk Store for The Republican. The
following article appeared in the issue
of December 4. regarding Manager
Marto's "copy" and its results:
Excellent Type Display
Group of small ads devoted to gen
era! merchandising, and a 14-column
spread (reproduced on this page) ex
ploiting the store's first anniversary.
There are a good many things to be
said in favor of the merchandising, the
values and the policy back of this ad,
but it is most interesting from the
standpoint of layout, type display and
arrangement.
In the first place, every department
is laid out in such a way that it is of
some assistance to every other depart
ment in the ad, especially if two ad
joining sections are allied either in use
or in kind.
In the second place, the adman has
taken particular pains to feature one
section in a striking manner. The
great advantage of this skillful method
of display is that the featured depart
ment, while drawing attention to itsilf.
undeniably does not detract in the
least bit from smaller departments in
the ad.
The scheme of type display is es
pecially attractive. Practically all the
section captions of the r,d are set in
italics. Frequently the subcaptions
also are italicised. Then the body of
the item is set in a clear, easy-to-read
font that approximates italic in effect,
hut is really simply light-face, thin
type.
Taken in a big expanse, as they are
in the ad, these items present a gsay
space which is very attractire. Prob
ably the only faults in type display are
the dense black used in the main cap
tion of the ad and the stiff. wooden
looking reproduction of the store. Bet
ter have left out the picture of the
stole if a better cut was not obtainable.
However, the ad is so good generally
that this little fault does not seriously
detraet from it.
Adrnen who are looking for a good
method for pig layouts, will do well to
study this double-truck e.nniversarv
ad.

NO COMMENT ON MESSAGE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
THE HAGUE. Dec. 8 (Via London,
Dec. 9.) The Dutch newspapers al
most unanimously refraoin from com
menting on the president's message,
preferring to await the arrival of its
full text. The Nieuke C'ourant, how
ever, says:.
"The message contains nothing to
arouse a belief that there is a likeli
hood of a diplomatic breach between
the United States and Germany."
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
COLUMBUS, O., Dec. 8. A nation
wide movement to make the country
church the religious social and agri
cultural center for the farmer through
a federation of church in rural com
munities, was launched here today at
the opening session of the conference
of the commission on church and
country life which is being held under
the auspices of the federal .council
of the Churches of Christ in
America.
Speakers advocated the laying aside
of sectarian differences in the forma
tion of such a federation and agreed
that rural churches are too numerous,
country preachers are underpaid and
that their enegrics are divided among
too many charges.
Governor Frank B. Willis of Ohio,
and Gifford Pinchot, chairman of -the
commission, and Dr. Washington
Gladden of Columbus, reearded by
! many as the father of the movement
to bring about interdenominational
co-operation, were among the speakers.

INLAND CITIES W BEGIN
TERMINAL POINTS STATUS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAX FRANCISCO, Dec. 8. In re
storing the cities of Sacramento,
Stockton, San Jose and Santa . Clara
to the tatus of terminal points the
United States circuit court of appeals
opened the way today, according to
legal authorities here, for similar re
lief for 1S2. other inland cities which
enjoyed terminal rates prior to
April 30.
The circuit court issued an injunc
tion restraining the interstate com
merce commission from enforcing its
order of April 30, on B. and C. com
modity rates on westbound transcon
tinental freight to the four cities
above named While the decision ap
plied to these four cities, the opinion
was expressed by lawyers that the
other cities may now apply to the
court and receive the same relief.
Max Thelen, president of the state
railroad commission, said tonight, that
he had not seen a copy of the courts
order; that the fact that Judge Bled
soe dissented on the ground that the
commission's order should have been
annulled "in toto" and not in certain
of its applications, would indicate
that the order was limited in its ef
fect to the four cities named, but that
he believed that the order would
mean the eventual restoration to ter
minal status of the 182 other inland
cities.
received, it was probable that no
communication would be sent to
Vienna.
Tonight it was suggested in some
quarters that information of a most
conclusive nature had come to Secre
tary Lansing probably late .Monday
night, and that it had been decided
then that the protest should go for
ward immediately. Whether Am
bassador Penfield had transmitted the
rep'y of the Vienna foreign office to
the list of queries submitted by the
United States could not be ascer
tained. The belief prevails, however, that
the state department had received
answers of some son to the queries.
In the inquiry Austria-Hungary was
asked among other things whether a
warning shot had been fired before
the slip was shelled, whether time
was given the passengers to get
place of safety and whether
shots Wf-r fired at the ship
-she had come to a standstill
before the torpedo that sank her was
launched. The Austro-1 lungarian
embassy here had not been advised
tonight thit 'he inquiry had been
answered and it was said that the
Italian ambassador, who has trans
mitted much information upon the
smiting of the Ancona, had not fur
nished the United States with any
thing additional.
The Anccna was sunk in the
itcranean on November 9,

specifically that .the
pec'oed while the men, women and
children in the cabin and steerage
were scrambling to get into the
smail boats. The department has
been inclined not to accept, this single
statement as positive proof unless
corroboration was received from
some source.
Much weight was given, however,
to what Dr. Greil had to say. Her
testimony was considered of so much
importance that she was taken to
Rome, whoie she told her story to
Ambassador Page. A report of this
conversation reached the state de
partment reeefftly.
After the inquiry of the United
States had been before the Vienna
forcien office several days. Ambassa
dor Penfield reported that more time
was desired in which lo frame a re
ply. Late last week. Secretary Ran
sing instructed the ambassador to
urge -i prompt reply.
The American note, it is under
stood, sets forth that the United
States cannot believe that the com
manders of the Austrian submarine
have committed an alleged act of
lawless ness except under a misappre
hension of orders issued by the Aus
trian naval authorities. It is de
clared that under methods of war
fare such as those employed in the
sinking of the Ancona it practically
is impossible, under such circum
stances, to remain within the rules
of fairness, justice and humanity.
The principles of humanity and
justice which were championed in
notes to Germany, are understood to
also be called strongly- to the atten
tion of the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment in this communication. Warn
ing before submarine attacks is in
sisted upon. While every opportunity
is said to be left for an amicable
reply, the belief prevails in usually
well informed official circles th it the
communication is more vigorous than
anything dispatched to Germany
while the controversy with that coun
try over the conduct of submarines
in warfare was in progress.
No information could be obtained
tonight as to whether the United
States had determined whether any
"misinformation" appeared in the
statements of the occurrence which
have ben issued by the Austrian
admiralty. The Austrian contention
was that a warning shot was fired,
that the ship tried to escape, and
that when she finally came to a stop
after being hit several times, fifty
minutes was given in which the
passengers might have taken to the
boats.
At the end of that period it was
claimed another vessel approached
and the submarine submerged and
torpedoed the Ancona which sank at
the end of another period of 4 5 min
utes. It was 'deniod that any life
boats were fired at. but it was said
that some loss of life was caused by
the failure of the commander of the
Ancona to act promptly.
The Italian statement on the sub
ject alleged that no warning was
given before the submarine started
shellirg the ship, which immediately
came.. to a stop, and that shells were
exploded on the decks of the vessel
and in the lifeboats, killing and
wounding many passengers.
Just how many American lives
were lost on the Ancona never has
been definitely established. It is
known that, several naturalized citi
zens were lost. Reports on this point
however have been so conflicting- that
the state 'department never has been
able to compile an accurate list. The
texl of the American note, it was
said tonifrht, will be given out for
publication in morning- papers of
Friday.

LONDON. Deo. 9. In an editorial
this morning oeanrg with President's
Wilson's message to congress, the
Morning Post, referring to that pas
sage in which the president speaks
of the necessity of the United States
holding aloof from the conflict tso
"that some part of the great family
of nations should keep the processes
of pence alive," observes that if Mr.
Wilson regards the nation as making
one family and in thin domestic circle
the United States is included, it is at
least extraordinary that the l'nited
States should be so manifestly inde
pendent of the di sires and f( clings of
' her relatives.
j The editoii.il proceeds to argue
I that President Wilson strangely mis
! understands the nature of the conflict
j which it says is a struggle for the
j preservation of ehilization and not
a mere clash of contending ambitious.
Then, quoting passages from the
president's deiieneiotion of ihe dis
loyalty of naturalized citizens, the
Utorial contends th;;t they are proof
that the entente allies are fighting
indirectly for the United States.
"What," says the editorial, . "stands
between America and 'creatures of
passion, disloyalty anil anarchy' in
their armed millions but the
ence and of political liberty' she is
the object of German ambition which
