A STORY OF CITY LIFE
Lawyer Cheatham placed a watch, to
be kept up night and day', on the P.uella
street house and before this watch had
been established a week his suspicions
were confirmed, and he became convinced
that "the birds were safely caged."
For many years he had looked yearn
ingly forward to the time when he would
be master of the Hermann estate. Of
late he had looked upon the beautiful Mi
riam as a desirable mistress of the man
lion and though he had not relinquished
this wish, he decided not to wait for its
fulfillment in order to take possession.
The day on which Kitty left, Cheat
ham took charge, and the following day
he had his baggage moved from the hotel.
His tool, Clay, who had been hiding in
/fread, turned up opportunely, and wa»
'.Installed as cook.
The mansion was comfortably, even
luxuriously furnished and as Cheatham
•walked through the fine apartments he
felt himself to be lord and master of all
ho surveyed.
Charles Carpenter had made up his
own mind, npt only to remain at the man
juon, but to direct its affairs.
"You'll find it very lonely out here,
-Charley," said Cheatham, one evening.
"A man so used to a life of excitement
'Cannot long be content with these syl
van and entirely domestic surroundings."
"Jndeed!" said Carpenter, sarcastically.
"And," continued Cheatham, "you can
stop at the best hotel in the city, if you
want to. But I'd prefer to board—if I
were you:—down near the docks, where
you can see ships, salt water and sailors,
and be in your native element, as I might
say."
"I'm in my element here, Dave, and
you're my guest," Carpenter went on.
"I will engage a corps of servants, and
-entertain like a nabob. I'll have a yacht
'anchored at the wooden pier, and go out
on my native element Whenever
"I took an oath that I would kill you."
"Kill me, Charley?" exclaimed Cheat
•ham.
"Yes but don't feel frightened now.
I've revoked that oath. You've partly
•made amends for your misdeeds. You
sent me to the penitentiary in my youth,
and robbed me of the only beings I ever
.really loved, but in my middle age you
'bring me a princely fortune and place
me master Of a house that is an earthly
paradise. I come mighty near forgiving
•you, Dave. Ah! if money could only
bring back the dead, and I had them here
—I feel as if I might even reform and
fee some one again!"
There was a softer look in the fierce
*yes, but it was only for a moment.
"That's all right, Charley! all right!"
•aid Cheatham, moving uneasily in his
chair. "But let us talk about something
Ilore
lse. You promised to tell me something
about this Paul Neville."
"Well," drawled Carpenter, "there ain't
much to tell you. I hinted that I hated
the fellow?"
"You told me that he assaulted you on
one occasion. I suppose you were on the
same ship?"
"Yes," Carpenter hastened to say, "that
was it. Karl—I mean Paul Neville—was
•first mate of the ship Aurora, and we
were anchored off Nagasaki, Japan. That
was a little more than two years ago. One
of the natives was cheating me, and hav
ing a little liquor aboard I was about
•to knife him, when Paul Neville inter
fered so I cut him, and he knocked me
overboard with a marline-spike. I haven't
forgot that, even though he did leap over
among the sharks and hold me up till a
•boat was lowered."
"He must be a powerful man."
"Yes, strong, and brave as a lion, so
far as that goes but he's one of your pol-
1
Ished, goody-goody sort of fellows that I
have no use for. The idea of your em
.ploying such a man for a detective is
•bout the funniest thing I have heard in
all my life!"
"Yes, Charley, but supposing I had en
gaged a shrewder man—one who might
have found Hermann's nephew—where
would you be now?" asked Cheatham.
"That's true! You are generally right'
In such matters." -1
"The remarkable thing to me is your
coming back as you did, bearing the name
•Charles Carpenter."
"And my own name at that."
Just then .Clay came running into the
room, his black face filled. with alarm,
and his eyes principally whites.
"He's dar! He's a walkin' 'bout under
de trees!" gasped Clay.
"Who's under the trees?" demanded
Carpenter.
"It's de gemnien what uster teach
foung miss music."
"Neville?"
"Yes, sah! him dat blocked the game
dat night!"
Carpenter put on the belt containing
tis knife and pistols with as much regu
larity as he pulled on his bopts. He
drew the weapons within reach and half
way out, to make sure that they moved
without obstruction, and then said:
"Show me where he is."

'the envied of the envied. Don't look
blue about it, .Dave. I'll pay you more
than the legal fee for your efforts."
"Ha, ha, ha, very good!" laughed
Cheatham.'
"When I reached New York this last
time and got thinking about my impris
onment and my dead wife and child, the

curse you had made of my life, do you
know what I' had fully made up my mind

ley! Remember the law!" said Cheat
ham, rising, and extending his arms, as
if he would checlt his impetuous compan

"Doesn't the law protect a man that
defends his own property against
thieves?"
"Oh, certainly."

black man kept noiselessly by bis side
and led him towards-the river, where at
length a tall form came to view, standing
on the extreme end of the little wooden
pier and looking out at the water.
Like a' tiger-cat Carpenter crept down,
and as he neared the man standing there
in the moonlight, all his doubts vanished
as tp his identity. It was indeed Paul
Neville! Nearer and nearer the assassin
crawled, and like a snake in the 'grass,
he hissed:
"I wish he could know, before dying,
what hand strikes the blow."
Undetected by the young man, who
seemed absorbed in watching the river
sweeping by, Carpenter succeeded in get
ting within twenty paces of him. A rock
covered with creepers blocked his way.
Over this rock he threw his pistol arm,
so making a secure rest for the weapon.
Carpenter drew in his breath, glanced
along the shining barrel, and pulled the
trigger. A flash, a crack, a short, sudden
cry, followed by a splash in the river—
and the figure had disappeared.
1 CHAPTER XVI.
Lent Dodd sat up till midnight, waiting
for Paul Neville. He tried to shorten the
time by reading, but the most interesting
book in the world would not have fasten
ed his attention that night. Finally he
rapped at Mrs. Munroe's door and asked:
"Do you feel pretty sure that Mr.
Neville hasn't come home yet?"
"Why," replied the old woman, "if he
was to come home you'd be the first to
know it."
"Where did he go?"
He could hear Mary rising, and the in
tense whisper with which she said to
her mother:
"There is danger afoot. I will go out
there at once. They shall both explain
to me, as they value their lives."
Swift and noiseless as a cloud shadow,
she went down the many flights of stairs.
The streets were deserted. She overtook
street car after street car, and passed
them as if they were standing still. She
reached the iron gate and found it open,
just as Paul Neville had. She fairly flew
up the winding road under the trees, and,
reaching the door, she rang the bell con
tinuously, till a window was raised and
Cheatham called out, in frightened tones:
"Who is there?"
"I, Mary Cheatham!" she replied.
"What do you want here at this time
of night, woman? I'll call the police."
"I want to see you and my brother—
the man that calls himself Charles Car
penter. It is thought there has been a
murder committed here to-night. Open!
open!"
Again she rang the bell, and beat upon
the door with her fists.
'Merciful heavens!" said Cheatham,
running to Carpenter's room. "I never
thought of this woman and her mother!
Get up, Charley, get up! Your insane sis
ter is at the dpor, and she swears there
has been a murder
"A murder?" cried Carpenter, leaping
out of bed.
He ran into the hair, panting, his face
livid and his teeth chattering with fear.
He was half asleep, and did not com
prehend what Cheatham had said.
"A murder? Who says there has been
a murder? It is a lie, a hideous lie! There
has been no murder here—no murder that
we have anything to do with. Hark, the
bell! Who's ringing the bell, Cheatham
—who's at the door? Answer me, man,
or I will tear you to pieces!"
He seized Cheatham by the throat, and
shook him as a dog might a rat, in his
anger and fear.
"Don't, don't!" gasped Cheatham. "It
is your sister! Listen! she is calling to
you. That's her voice."
Carpenter caught Cheatham by the arm
and dragged him to the lower hall. Here
he turned up the light and opened the
door. His self-control and reckless dar
ing had come back to him but all his
force seemed but as reeds before a tor-

"He said he would walk out and take
a look at the Hermann place by moon
light. He was feeling particularly bine,
and he imagined the sight would bright
en him up a bit. He said he would be
back before ten, and now it is midnight."
"Do you think," asked Mary, "that!h«
would be so rash as to enter the
grounds?"
nado compared to the resafot* heroism
with which he found himself confronted.
"Where is Paul .Neville?" she demand
ed. "Answer ate at once—^-Where's Paul
Neville?"
"Paul Neville!" repeated Carpenter.
"I don't know him. I wasn't told to
take care of him, whoever he is."
''Why should you come bothering us
about this person?" interposed Cheat
ham, with weakly assumed indignation.
"He came here this night entered your
open gate. This is known." In her earn
estness Mary accepted this as a fact, in
addition to which she instinctively read
the men before her and saw that they
had lately seen the object of her search.
"What have you done with him?"
"We'd have put him in jail if we knew
he was here," said Cheatham. "What
right has he or any one else to enter our
grounds?"
"Your grounds!.. Charles Carpenter's
grounds!" she said, with biting bitterness.
"The Hermann property seems to be
owned jointly by murderers and thieves!
How long do you think you will be left in
peaceful possession? Find me Paul
Neville before the sun rises, or I and my
mother will forget, renounce and trample
under foot the ties of blood that bind us
to this wretch, and hand him over to
justice."
She pointed her finger at Charles Car
penter, and he staggered back as if her
hand held a pistol.
"And you"—she turned to Cheatham—
"you maker of criminals, and plunderer
of widows and orphans!—you monster of
wickedness—unredeemed by one manly
trait—obey rue in this, or take the conse
quences!"
She turned to leave, but Carpenter, as
If struck with a sudden resolve, called to
her to "wait." He ran upstairs and came
back in a minute with a pistol in his
hand, determined to destroy her.
"Where is she?" he asked.
"Gone, gone!" replied Cheatham,
clutching at his throat as if he weri
strangling.
"Gone?"
Lem Dodd was awake the following
morning by daylight. As he had not un
dressed it did not take him Ibng to make
his toilet. He found Mrs. Munroe up,
and Mary, looking paler with excitement
and want of rest, stiting beside the stove.
"Any news of Paul?" he asked.
"None," replied Mary, without looking
up. "I tear he is dead."
"Dead!"
"Yes, dead. If I tell you a secret, will
you pledge me your honor as a man not
to reveal it, until I- give you leave?"
"I give that pledge unhesitatingly," re
plied Lena, who had a professional love of
mysteries.
Mary began the story of her own life,
and as die related it she brought in her
mother and her half-brother. "As she

teres* deepened," Lem said, when sub
sequently speaking about this narrative.
She kept nothing back, not even the mis

such as to cause disrespect for her. Step
by step she told the story until at length
Lem Dodd saw the identity of Charles
Carpenter and Charles C. Bolton.
"I will keep your secret, Mary, as I
pledged to do," said Dodd. "But I must
confess I am dumb with amazement. For
the first time in my eventful career, I re

REPORT BY WILSON.
WORK OF THE AGRICULTURAL
BUREAU REVIEWED.
Department'* Head Telia of Efforts in
Behalf of Farmers—Weather Service
Good—Experiments in Treatment of
Cattlei Wheat Planting and Irrigation
Secretary Wilson of the Agricultural
Department, in his annual report, says
tihat important extensions of the weather
bureau have been made during the year.
Much stress is laid upon the continued
improvement of the forecast service and
the value of its warnings. The Secre
tary points out that notwithstanding the
great number of craft plying the Gulf of
$Iexico at the time of the Galveston
storm, the warnings were so timely that
there was no disaster, upon the open wat
ers. Successful experiments have been
made with wireless telegraphy.
During the quarantine season of 1899
over 1,000,000 cattle were moved under
the supervision of the bureau from the
district infected with the Southern cattle
tick. In Texas alone over 357,W0 cat
tle were inspected for shipment to other
sections.
The sheep industry has suffered greatly
from sheep scab, and much time and at
tention has been given to securing its con
trol and eradication. Results so far are
encouraging. Over 1,800,000 sheep were
inspected, and nearly 627,000 dipped, un
der the supervision of the inspectors. The
work of preparing.serum'for treating hog
cholera and swine- plague and experi
ments in treatment therewath are contin
ued, with results which' are encouraging.
Considerable space, is given to the con
sideration of tuberculosis, "the most prev
alent^ and most destructive disease affect
ing'mankind and the domesticated ani
mals."
Experimental shipments of dairy pro
ducts are still continued and shipments
of butter have been extended to Cuba and
Porto Rico. National legislation on. the
suhject of food adulterations is urged as
essential to supplement. the work done
by the several States... Little horse meat
'seems to be sold in the United States,
whether under its o.ym name or any other.
Secretary Wilsoh citfrS thenntroduction
of wheats from Russia, Hungary and
Austria, greatly -exceeding in yield our
present varieties, and points out that if,
as the result of these introductions, the
wheat yield of the United States should
be increased by one bushel per acre, this
would mean $26,000,000 added to the in
come of our farmers.
Warning is given of the possible danger
of the introduction and dissemination of
the Belgian hare and the destruction of
prairie dogs has become a practical ques
•tion of great interest to the farmers.
The Secretary notes a keener and wider
public interest in forestry. Much consid
eration is given in the report to the irri
gation investigations, which cover two
general lines of investigation.
Under the head of the section.of for
eign markets the report says that the
study of markets abroad with special ref
erence to extending the demands therein
for the agricultural products of the Unit
ed States has been prosecuted with zeal
and intelligence.
Five years ago our total shipments of
domestic merchandise to Asia and Ocean'
ica were valued at $43,000,000, of which
only $9,700,000 were agricultural. In
1900 our export trade with the Orient
amounted to $107,000,000, of which $30,
000,000 worth was farm produce.
SURRENDER TO BOERS.
Four Hundred British Soldiers Lay
Down Their Arms.
London has been startled by the news
of another British defeat at the hands of
the Boers. The Dewetsdorp garrison
has surrendered, and Gen. Dewet has
captured 400 British prisoners. This
news, coming after repeated dispatches
from the front saying the war was prac
tically over and only a few scattered
guerrilla bands remained to be-subdued,
has caused great alarm in England. The
story is told in the following dispatch
from Johannesburg by Lord Roberts:
The Dewetsdorp garrison of two guns
of the Sixtyeighth field battery, with de
tachments of the Gloucestershire regi
ment, the Highland Light infantry and
Irish Rifles, 400 in all, surrendered at
6:30 p. m., Nov. 23. Our losses were
fifteen men killed and forty-two wound
ed, including Maj. H. J. Anson and Cap
tain Digby. The enemy is said to be
2,BOO strong. Fourteen hundred men
were dispatched from Edenburg to re
lieve Dewetsdorp, but they did not suc
ceed in reaching there in time. Knox
joined this force and found Dewetsdorp
evacuated. Seventy-five sick and wound
ed had been left there. Knox pursued
and is reported to have successfully en
gaged Steyn and De Wet near Vaalbank
Nov. 27. They retired west and south
west. Knox's messenger- failed to get
through, so I have no details."
The disaster at Dewetsdorp has sent a
thrill of alarm through Great Britain.
Muddy Boots Cause Divorce.
Because her husband went to bed with
his muddy boots on, Mrs. Marie Schramm
of Omaha secured a di
vorce. The 1
ground of complain!
was as stated, ant
when this feature was
brought out before the
Court the crowd in the
court room was con
vulsed. At the same
time the judge's fea
tures hardened. "Your
honor," declared the
woman, who up to that
moment had been Mrs.
Schramm, "I did not
feel lake buying a pick and shovel to clean
mud from the bed, and 1 told Mr.
Schramm so, but it did no good." "Di
vorce granted," said the judge.
New Fast Mail.
The new daily fast mail train recently
put on by the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railroad for the government is
Che third now in operation over that road.
One leaves Chicago at 3 o'clock in the
morning, and another at 9:30 in the even
ing, both for Council Bluffs. The new
train leaves Chicago every morning at
8:48 for Lincoln, Neb., where it delivers
to the Burlington's express for the North
Pacific coast via Billings, Mont. The new
train carries a coach for passengers and
gives a quick day service Chicago to
Council Bluffs, Omaha and Lincoln.

On the face of it Minnesota appears to
have the best of it, but the Millers have
played few games with the big teams,
and Wisconsin and Chicago claim, they
are not .so good as Towa. Stagg insists
Wisconsin is the best team in the^West,
while Michigan men say that at this time
Chicago is the Strongest. The Maroons
admit they have no claim on- the cham
pionship, but declare they can beat Min
nesota. Northwestern is silent, but seems
to be tiiinking hard.
That Minnesota was by no means in*
vincible was proven by the scores of the
Chicago and Wisconsin game, but Ne
braska emphasized this by making two
touchdowns. Nobody will say Nebraska
is as good as Chicago or Wisconsin, and
the Iowa State eleven, which was badly
beaten by Iowa University, beat Nebras
ka. Accordingly, everybody can pick his
own favorite and argue that it is best.

Another snarl or two was put in the
Western football tangle on Thanksgiv
ing day when Chicago beat Michigan and
Northwestern tied with Iowa. As the
situation is now there are no Western
football champions. Iowa will claim the
honor, but Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Northwestern will say .the, Hawkeyes did
not .prove their superiority. They did
not bea.t Chicago as badly as Wisconsin,
yet Illinois and Northwestern tied and
Northwestern beat Chicago and tied
Iowa. Chicago tied Minnesota and Wis
consin lost to the Gophers. This makes
the. situation as mixed up as a Chinese
puzzle..
subsequently
was sent by King
Kalakaua to Italy to study in the schools
there. In Italy he married a princess.
Since his return to Hawaii in 1887 he
has remarried. He claims that he has
been divorced from the Italian woman,
but his enemies say that no decree was
"ver obtained and they may try to keep
him out of Congress on the ground that
he is a ,bigamist.
Wilcox has been a leader of the mon
archists in two revolutions, strenuously
opposing the efforts to establish the gov
ernment of the United States over that
country. In the uprising that followed
Liliuokalani's deposal in 1895 he was ar
rested and lodged in prison for a year.
According to the latest news from Ma

race.
On the first day of their crusade against
crime the Chicago police gathered in 400
disreputables. The crusade will now be
suspended while Chicago builds a few
new jails.
Other cities, kn^ving Chicago's pro
verbial enterprise, are probably wonder
ing why no effort is being made to have
the railroads grant excursion rates for
its celebrated carnival of crime.
The Boers seem determined to make it
cost the British more than it comes to
by several pounds.
Chicago should be better protected now
unless the hoid-up men put on a few ex
tra workers to offset the extra policemen
hired by the city.
Perhaps the Duke of Manchester has
decided to live in America because that
will be handier than drawing on his fath
er-in-law by cable.
There is fear that the plan to get the
tramps to build good roads will not work.
The fear is based on the belief that thf
tramps will not work.

CONGRESS IS AT WOJ
HEARS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
ON MONDAY. ,, 7
Very Bnsy Session Looked For on Ac
count of Many Important Legislative
Measures to Be Acted Upon Before
March 4 Next. jt-
Washington correspondence:
The second session of the Forty-sixth
Congress convened Monday at noon. Ihe
President's annual message was read,
and the Senate and House then adjBrn
ed out of respect for the memoj^HV,
Senator Davis of Minnesota.
work of the session began Tuesday-pon
gress must adjourn March 4, but airenor
mous amount of legislation will be ac
complished. Nearly every important
measure that has been selected for pas
sage at this session, including the army
reorganization, steamship subsidy, Nic
aragua canal, Pacific cable, rivers and
harbors, public buildings and amend
ments of the war tax bills, has been con
sidered in committee. The leaders do not
regard further hearings necessary or de
sirable, and will urge that the two houses
proceed to act without delay.
President McKinley's annual message
to Congress was presented immediately
upon the assembling of Congress at noon.
It had been planned to withhold the mes
sage until Tuesday, so that both houses
might adjourn immediately after assem
bling on Monday as a mark of respect
for the late Senators Davis and Gear,
but this plan was altered
after
a confer­
ence between the President and S»ator
Frye. The message was presented
usual manner and received by S^Bp
Frye, as president pro tem. of the wen
ate, and Speaker Henderson. It was read
in both houses. It was deemed best not
to violate the old tradition of Congress
regarding the presidential message and
its presentation on the opening day of
the session.
No business was transacted beyond the
reading of the President's message ow
ing to the death of Representatives Daly
of New Jersey and Huffecker of Dela
ware, and Senators Davis and Gear,
which occurred during the recess.
The leaders of the House are prepar
ing to press with great vigor the impor
tant business of the session. Alreati.,
considerable preliminary committee work
has been done on the important meas
ures, and the House found work cut out
for it as soon as it assembled.
In the Senate after the reading of the
President's message the formal announce
ment of the death during the recess of
Senators Davis and Gear brought the
sitting to a close. Senator Allison^ made
the announcement in the case of his late
colleague, Senator Gear. These^an
nouncements were preceded by
mony of swearing in the new mec^Hfep^
who this year are Mr. Dolliver, whaisas
been appointed to succeed Senator Gear,
and Mr. Dillingham, who takes the place
formerly occupied by Senator Ross of
Vermont, and the appointment of the
usual committees to wait upon the Presi
dent and the House of Representatives.
The opening of' this session of Con
gress, which will end with the first term
of Mr. McKinley, has much about it to
suggest the actual beginning of the sec
ond term without waiting for the inau
guration on March 4. The first Presi
dent directly to succeed himself since
Grant in 1872, Mr. McKinley and his
party associates intend to take'the ver
dict at the polls last November as an in
