public auction all the lots in Block No. 49,

Monday, December I Oth, at 1 o'clock p. m.
The sale will take plate on the premises,
but should the weather be unpleasant, then
at Mr. Ilo''iauer's Store, opposite the
Clock. For the first time these lots are
now brought into market. They are un
questionably in the healthiest locality and
present the finest locations for building of
any in the city. No more eligible and beau
tifully located property was ever offered for
sale in Evansville. These lots have stl'
been staked off and numbered, so that pur
chastis can now o, before the sale, and
pick out the lot they wish to buy. The
title is perfectly good. Warranty Deeds

The Atlantic Monthly. This sterling
periodical has been steadily growing in in
terest since its commencement, and the pro
posal for the Seventh Volume promises a
mora attractive bill of fare than ever. In
the seventh volume will be published a new
novel by Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, one
by Chas. Reude, one of the most distinguish
ed of English Novelists, and the usual varie
ty of entertaining stories from the pen of
Miss Harriet Prescott. fn addition to this,
the publishers of the Atlantic have secured
a list of contributors comprising the most
distinguished authors of the age, such as
Longfellow, Hawthorne, Holmes, Lowell,
Emerson, Whittier, Taylor, Whipple, Giles,
Kimball, Hillard, Rose Terry, Dr. Bellows,
Funny Kemble. Norton, Sargent, Higginson
and Trowbridge. With such contributors,
the Atlantic cannot prove otherwise than
successful.
The Monthly is mailed and the postage
prepaid to any part of the U. S. for S3 per
annum. Two copies are sent for $5, sub
scribers paying their own postage, which is
3t cents a year. Address
Tic knob & Fields,

desirable assortment in the City. His stock

ty cannot be surpassed. He has a very choice
assortment of Cloths, Cassirneres, and Jeans
which he will either sell by the quantity to
suit purchasers, or have them manufactured
into any garment required. He has a supe
rior Cutter in his Store we say this for the
benefit of the public.
The Student and Sliioolmatb is one of
the most entertaining monthlies for children
wf have had the pleasure of looking over.
The little folks eagerly seize them, upon
their appearance every month, and the phi
losophical disquisitions, learned trtlks about
dogs and cats, and the usual variety of enig
mas, conundrums, and charadcj, are read
and guessed at with the greatest interest
and enthusiasm. Any household where
children are found should not be without a
copy of the Student and Schoolmate.

our military organization. Is omcers naa

you know that our fellow-townsman, John h011 warred to committee of the
i- Uhr. A t h ctfita iif i ha I ninn
Smith Gavitt, has received the appointment
! from the Governor, of Brigadier General
for the first Covirerxioual District of In-
diana, and a most excellent appointment it
is, so we officers think. Gavitt is kuown
to be bri've, honorable, and liberal to- a
fault, which renders him iiiimeii?e'y popular
among .. A gnat mativ motions and
amendments were put, all of which, were
disposed of by the General in IVtliame-nt-

besides.
A large number of commissions were
distributed, and among the lucky dogs. I
whs not unlucky, there being a Captain's
commission for your humble servant. Ex
cept the appointment for General, I regard
my appointment as being decidedly the best
of them all. Some year, ho, 1 had the
honor of holding a Corporal's commission
in a mi'it:iry company, and it was said that
I made a most excellent ollicer, although I
never was engaged in any real eervife, emeu
as shooting and snch innocent ftmttseiirrnts.'
Our friend Herman Fendrich aTso.reeeiTi-d
a t aplain s ccmi'ii. -i,i:i, which was regard
ed as a good appoint meut, but all hands
agreed that he would make a. much more
favorable impression on hcrseh;ck. Capt.
Fendrich was also elected U the? very im
portant position of Treasurer.1 This-position
was given to the Captain 3 a. reward
for his bravery on election day, upon which
occasion he showed himself to 1 not only
a soldier that can Le relied iion in tiiriV of
need, but also showed" considerable legal
ability. . ' "'"..' "
Mine host of the Pavilion Hotel' waS also
one who was fortunate enough to receive a
Captain's commission. I do not think that
Capt. Cranmer has ever been engaged iu the
Military service of his country,-but I pre
sume his good looks, and that fancy mous
tache of his, did much for him in this mat
ter.
In my eagerness to announce that I had re
ceived the Captaincy of a company, I hud,
almost forgot to state that Bayless VV. Hanna
recently of the Suventh Cony regional Dis
trict, but now of the First, received the ap
pointment of Major. Mnjor Hnnna will
make a very excellent officer will show
fine on horseback, but some of us, who
have always been the particular friends of
the General, doubt the propriety ol the Ma
jor's appointment. It is feared that he may,
within a year or two, become somewhat fac
tious and refuse to obey the orders of the
General. Should the Major so far torjiet
himself as to refuse to obey his command
ing ofiicer, I want to give him notice now,
that he will be court martialed, and it is in
tended that us officers shall form the Court,
and in that case, he will have a " hard road
to travel." I believe that it is now the un
derstanding, that the general court will con
vene in about eighteen months, at Viu
cennes or Washington, in the First Cun
g regional District of Indiana.
There will be, however, Court Martials
held in all the counties in this Congression
al District, from time to time, for the pur
pose of trying us Captains, Lieutenants, Ser
jeants, and privates, should any of us be
guilty of any indiscretions.
There were seven Captains appointed for
Pigeon Township, besides Lieutenants, &c,
all of whom are good and reliable men
men who will stand by their colors through
good and evil report. The balance of the
officers will receive due attention -in a fu
ture communication ; consequently, ( hope
they will not think they are slighted by not
being noticed in this. Yours,
Ca pt. St'it(Mi(;iNS.

Bggf As it is altogether probable that the
volunteer militia will be called on by Presi
dent Buchanan to inarch to South Carolina
and put her through a course of discipline,
a communication headed "Our Military
Organization,'' written by one of the
botild soldier boys,'" will be perused with
interest. Evansville, it will be seen, is now
well supplied with ojlhtr.i. When the day
of trial comes, we doubt not the rank ami
file will be on hand. The e.tirir tie curpx is
alive in the breasts of aspirants for military
and civic honors. Another war only is
necessary to bring out as many applicants

the President's views and intentions regard
ing secession. It goes very much against
the inclinations of the disunionists, who
uver that they ought to be allowed to secede
peaceably if they can. Some are of the
opinion thatthe President's instructions to
tho commander of Fort Moultrie will cau30
a great deal of trouble, and serious appre
hensions are entertained with regard to it ;
hut this is altogether conjecture. Public
opiryon is not yet made tip in regard to the
matter. The conservatives ooiisider the
President's Message n c uuning production.
We I earn that the Hon. J. M. Botts ha3
written a long letter settiug forth his scheme
for settling the slavery question. It is an
entirely original scheme and if adopted
aill give satisfaction to both North and
South. It is anxiously looked for by the
Republican.

Lynchburg.

Complimentary,
Capt. Fowler, of the steamer Dunbar,
having presented a number of gentlemen
and ladies of L'niontown, Ky., with a com
plimentary card to Mt. Vernon, for the pur
pose of uniting with their neighbors in the
enjoyment of a social supper party, given to
the Mt. Vernon Sax-Horn Band, the under
signed embraced the opportunity of visiting
Mt. Vernon and also Evansville, on board
the Dunbar, where we found everything
preuared to our liking. The excellent
string band which belongs to the boat dis
coursed sweet music, while we did our best
to keep time with the band in cotillon, pol
ka, &c. At Mt. Vernon a large party came
from their Citizens' Hall and joined us on
the boat, and Capt. Fowler generously
"laid by " at the landing for five hours, for
the purpose of letting both parties enjoy the
dance on the boat. At the expiration of
five hours (it being mail time) 1 lie gallant
Danbar again started upon her trip, while
the dancing went on.
Nothing could have been more agp.-euble
than the whole trip, and no parly more
pleasant than the party on board the Dun
bar, for all of which we are under many
obligations to Capt. Fowler, and lor which
kindness he has our sincere thanks and our
prayers for his future success, and that of
his fine steamer. We heartily recommend
the Dunbar and her kind oflicera to the
traveling public :
