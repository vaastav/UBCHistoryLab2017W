Many persons mistake dyspepsia for re
ligion. Cleveland mistakes his personal
grudges for statesmanship.
Andrew Johnson also thought the coun
try would go to the dogs when he went out of
office. He also had a policy.
The Louisville Commercial says the Presi
dent's message was "ten columns long and
loaded to the muzzle with platitudes and re
morse.' Cleveland evidently thinks that when he
eeases to hold the country up by the tail it
will fall with a dull thud. We honestly be
lieve he is mistaken.
Popular government is very far from be
ing a failure when it can survive four years
of such a President as Cleveland, and laugh
at his gloomy prophecies.
Last year President Cleveland discussed
but cue subject in his message; this year he
doesn't let anything escape mention but the
civil service, which he unaccountably forgets
to say anything about
If ex-President Cleveland goes abroad, as
it is reported he wjll after hi3 retirement
from office, he should try and absorb a slight
knowledge of American institutions and a
few patriotic ideas before he goes.
The Anarchists voted with the Democratic
party, anyway, but if that message had only
oeen circulated before election they would
ach and all have tried to vote more than
jnce for a man so closely after thoir own
heart
Me. Cleveland seems to be under the im-
a
pression that the campaign is not over. Can
he possibly have the faintest, feeblest bit of
an idea that he will be a presidential candidate
gain in 1S02? If so, another sad disappoint
meat is vet before him.
It wasn't really necessary for Mr. Cleve
land to relate the year's history of the world
'.n his message. The trouble of compiling it
from newspapers and state documents must
nave been considerable, the encyclopedia not
bringing these subjects up to date.
M ANTON MARBLE, Dan Lam on t and half a
dozen others may have had a hand in writing
the free-wool message of last year, but no one
will accuse Mr. Cleveland of employing any
aid in the work this year. That sophomorical
assay and long-drawn-out wail could only
have emanated from the Great Defeated him
self. Tnxr.E isn't a penny's worth of manliness
.In the whole lot From Cleveland, all along
the line of defeated Democratic candidates
down to Matson, comes no sound but that of
tearful lamentation. It was hoped that at
least the President would not plead the baby
act, but the hope was in vain. He is the big
gest baby of all.
If Mr. Joseph E. McDonald, or Mr. Mat
ion, or any other man who talks so glibly
tbout corruption and fraudulent voting in In
diana wants to earn a hundred dollars, all he
has to do is to tell what he really knows
about it if ho knows anything to the Com
mittee of One Hundred. That committee
wants just the sort of information these gen
tlemen profess to have, and are ready to pay
for it Let them come on with their facts
and specifications, or else stop whining.
THE Louisville Courier-Journal accompa
nies Cleveland's farewell message with a por
trait of the President, which, it says, "wo
ish to remark, in strict confidence, was en
graved for use in our edition of Nov. 7, but
was withheld for reasons not necessary to be
dwelt upon in this connection." The portrait
shows much more faith in republican institu
tions and popular government than if it had
been taken after Nov. G. In this picture
there is an expression of hopefulness in the
double chin, the lines of the neck above the
collar show something of the milk of human
kindness, and the jowls have a buoyant tone
entirely at variance with the message.
The failure of the switchmen's strike adds
another to the long list of such failures. It
does not prove that there may not have been
an element of justice in the demands of the
switchmen, but it does prove that striking is
doubtful and dangerous remedy. The pro
portion of successful strikes is not large
enough to justify any workingman who has a
family to support in going on a strike with
out much mijgiving. Workmen and em
ployes often exaggerate the evilj of their situ
ation and talk themselves into a belief that
ther are being very badly treated, when, ia
fact, their employers are doing the best they
can, and would gladly do better if they could.
Under such circumstances, and, in fact, under
almost any circumstances, a strike is a rem
edy of very doubtful wisdom. It is essen
tially & violent method and very apt to drive
employers to use extreme measures rather
than submit to what they regard as dictation.
The country is so large, the facilities of com
munication and the number of men seeking
employment &o great, that the places of strik
ers in any business can be filled in a few days,
and employers are very apt to put up with
temporary inconvenience and los3 rather than
submit to demands made in the form of a
strike. One must always sympathize with
workingmen thrown out of employment es
pecially at the beginning of winter, but they
ought to consider the possibilities of failure
before entering on a strike.
AH UK-AMERICAN PEESIDE2JT.
Grover Cleveland's farewell message will be
a fruitful text-book for Communists and the
foreign enemies of the United States. Long
after he is dead it will be quoted as evidence
of the inherent weakness of popular govern
ment. The London News 13 right in saying
that "the message is likely to become a house
hold word for the orators of Hyde Park and
Clerkenwell" meaning the Socialist agitators
who harangue the motley crowds which gather
in those places. The enemies of popular gov
ernment will find in the message a perpetual
arsenal of arguments against our 3ystem, and
its false assertions and damaging insinuations
will be cited for years to come as official evi
dence of the practical failure of our institu
tions. Aaron Burr, the first of our unconvert
ed traitors, never questioned the wisdom or
ultimate success of republican institutions,
and Jeff Davis himself never made as damag
ing an assault on the principles of
our government as this vindictive ti
rade of Grover Cleveland. Lord Sackville's
offense was trivial in comparison. If any
foreign minister should publish, over his own
name, a paper containing one-tenth part of
the communism and malice of this message
the American people would rise in a body and
demand his expulsion from the country. The
Republic has been stabbed in the back by one
who should be its swift defender, and pilloried
in history as a failure by its own chief execu
tive. The President, in effect, informs the
world that one hundred years of republican
government is no assurance of continued suc
cess, that the policy of protection has under
mined the government, and that only by dis
carding that policy can we "furnish proof to
the world of the fitness of tho American peo
ple for self-government" No foreigner has
ever drawn as dark a picture of American
civilization and society as that which follows.
Read some of the sentences:
"A century has passed. Our cities are
abiding places of wealth and luxury; our man
ufactures yield fortunes never dreamed of by
tho fathers of the Republic; our business men
are madly striving in the race for riches, and
immense aggregations of capital outrun the
imagination in the magnitude of their under
takings." 'Upon more careful inspection we find the
wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with
poverty, and wretchedness, and unremunera
tive toil. A crowded and constantlv increas
ing urban population suggests the impover
ishment of rural sections and discontent with
agricultural pursuits."
"The gulf between the employers and the
employed is constantly widening and classes
are rapidly forming, one comprising the very
rich and powerful, while in another are found
the toiling poor."
"As we view tho achievements of acrsrre-
gated capital, we discover the existence of
trusts, combinations and monopolies, while
the citizen is struggling far in tho rear or is
trampled to death beneath an iron heel.
"Under the same laws by which these re
sult are produced, the government permits
many millions more to be added to the cost
of the living of our people, and to be taken
from our consumers, which unreasonably
swell the profits of a small but powerful mi
nority." "The government, under pretext of an ex
ercise of its taxing power, enters gratuitously
into partnership with these favorities, to their
advantage and to the injury of a vast ma
jority of our people."
"The grievances of those not included
within the circle of these beneficiaries, when
fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and
discontent"
"Communism is a hateful thing and a
menace to peace and organized government.
But the communism of combined wealth and
capital, the outgrowth of overweening
cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously
undermines tho justice and integrity of free
institutions, is pot less dangerous than the
communism of oppressed poverty and toil,
which, exasperated bv injustice and dis
content attacks with wild disorder the citadel
of rule."
These sentences are taken at random. '
There are nearly two columns of this kind of
stuff strung together with a lot o platitudes
only less mischievous, because their meaning
is more obscure. The sentences quoted indi
cate tho warp and woof of all that part of the
message which relates to the condition of the
country. It is a beautiful picture of
American civilization and society at
the beginning of our second hundred
years. No foreign writer on American insti
tutions has ever written anything worse,
while the really intelligent and friendly ones
have been infinitely more just. The Chicago
Anarchists, at their next Haymarket meet
ing, will not have to look beyond this message
for inspiration for their speeches. Commun
ist editors have been placed under police sur
veillance for utterances no more incendiary.
One of the most severe arraignments of
popular government ever made by a foreigner
was in a letter written by the lato Lord Ma
caulay, in 1337, to a distinguished citizen of
New York. In that letter Macaulay plainly
stated his disbelief in the principle of man
hood suffrage and in the permanency of
American institutions. lie said:
"I do not believe that it is possible to es
tablish institutions that will be permanent
based upon the votes of people counted by
the head. That proceeds upon the supposi
tion that the rich and the poor, the wise and
the ignorant, the virtuous and the vicious are
all counted as equal and endowed with
equal political power. That is the fatal vice
of your institutions that Jefferson founded.
Now your country can prosper 60 long as you
have great spaces of unoccupied land; a great
West for your surplus population; but the
time will come in your history when New
England will be as thickly populated as Old
England; when there will be uo more fertile,
unoccupied lands for your expanding popula
tion. Then will come the real strain and test
: of your institutions. There will be periods
of scarcity and distress. Thousands of labor
ers will be out of work, and men will begin to
say there is no justice in allowing one man to
have a million while another has not a meal;
no justice in letting one man rido in hi3 carri
age and dine sumptuously while another
bears his children cry for bread; and when
that hour comes your government will be
brought to its final and fatal test
So wrote Lord Macaulay, on the 23d of
May, 1S37, and he predicted the failure of our
attempt at self-government, "if not ia this
century, certainly in the next." Mr. Cleve
land comes to the support of Lord Macaulay,
and, with a pen dipped in gall, draws, almost
the very picture of American society which
the English historian predicted.
Twenty-one years later, after the civil war,
Mr. Garfield, then a member of Congress, and
afterwards President, repudiated Macaulay's
prophecy in a speech replete with patriotism
and eloauence. Among other things he said:
"With my whole soul I repel the indict
ment. Every instinct and conviction of mv
life denounces the prophecy as false.
Macaulay did not know, and it is hardly pos
sible for anyone reared under monarchical in
stitutions to understand that here, in Amer
ica, there are no fixed and permanent classes.
Our society does not resemble the crust of tho
earth with its impassable barriers of rock; but
resembles rather the waters of the mighty sea,
deep, broad and boundless, but yet so tree in
all its parts that the drop which mingles with
the sands at its bottom is free to rise through
all the mass of waters till it flashes in the
light on the crest of the highest wave.'
Contrast this firm confidence ia American
institutions and this indignant repudiation of
a foreigner's slur with the croaking lamenta
tion of Grover Cleveland! And the most
amazing feature of the whole business is that
all the evils and dangers he pretends to de
scribe are attributed to a protective tariff, and
the only remedy he suggests is free trade.
What a stupendous fraud he is, and what
great cause the people will have, when he
goes out of office, to thank God and take
courage.
THE WARLIKE ME. ENDICOTT.
Secretary of War Eudicott is a little par
ticular in the matter of paying out govern
ment money to women and children of Re
publican proclivities employed in the arsenals
of the country, but thero is nothing email
about him vhen it comes to figuring on ap
propriations for his department In this
direction he shows that largeness of vision
and lofty disregard of expense only possible
to great financiers when disposing of other
people's money. In times like the present,
the War Office is not generally regarded as
one of the most important divisions of the
government, and the public is inclined to
look upon its chief as a functionary of com
paratively little consequence. Mr. Eudicott
is by no means of this opinion. While the
country has been involved in no actual war
during the year other 4 ban that waged
against the Chiricahua Apaches, the mild
mannered man from Boston has smelled the
battle afar off and his martial spirit has been
aroused. Possibly the President's celebrated
retaliation message was taken without a grain
of salt by this solemn gentleman, and he was
led to believe that trouble with England was
imminent At all events, with one eye fixed
on the treasury surplus and the other oa a
posterity which is expected to regard him as
its country's preserver, the bold Secretary has
resolved to prepare for war in time of peace.
An ordinary official, with hi3 party just going
out of power, would content himself with
performing the routine dutie3 of the position,
and, after estimating the expenses of the
fiscal year according to requirements, would
consider his mission completed. No 60, Mr.
Endicott If recommendations will do it, he
will protect the country if it takes
the last dollar in the treasury. The
current expenses of the next fiscal year
are estimated with a liberality some
what startling, the total being somewhat
over $44,000,000. This amount includes
salaries and contingent expenses of tho de
partment, support of the army and Military
Academy, river and harbor improvements al
ready planned, and miscellaneous objects of
minor character. Forty-four millions seems
a good deal, but it is a mere nothing to the
man who comes from a State where a dollar
is commonly supposed to look unusually
large. With a sweep of his pen he airily
urges the construction of coast defenses and
an appropriation for the same of $2,S40,000.
For the repair and preservation of existing
works $200,000 is asked, and for working the
sub-marine and torpedo systems $1,290,000 i3
recommended. Other works are suggested
which would entail large outlays, but the
Secretary has not given his mind to the de
tails and the public is left in the dark as to
the probable cost The estimate of $44,000,
000 for a department of the government
which is in comparative disuse is, however,
enough to cause universal wonder at the
"nerve" cf the Secretary. All speculations
as to what would become of the surplus had
the Democracy remained in power must now
cease. Endicott would look after it, and, in
the vulgar language of the street, make it
look very sick.
CANADA AND THE UNITED STATE 3.
The discussion of the annexation of Canada
is probably untimely and calculated to post
pone the very end it aims to accomplish.
Annexation is not a happy word to use in this
connection; absorption or assimilation would
be better. Annexation implies aggressive
action on the part of the United States,
which could mean nothing but war. Great
Britain does nothing on compulsion, and is
not in the habit of being forced to relinquish
her possessions. Besides, wo do not want
Canada at tho cost of a war with England,
especially if we can got it without war by
waiting a few years. Time is a good ally. If
we were to undertake to annex Canada now,
or any time before England is ready and will
ing to part with it, we should have a war on
our hands that might cost more than Canada
would be worth to us, whereas if we wait till
the fruit is ripe it will drop into our hands.
Annexation cannot be forced, but absorption
will come in the natural course of
events. In nature two bodies do not
become amalgamated till they have first
become as&itniUtcd. They do not merge to
gether till they have closely approached one
another. Assimilation precedes consolidation.
The time has not yet come for tho United
States to absorb Canada. That it will come
admits of uo doubt Manifest destiny points
to the ultimate union of the two countries,
but in the natural course of events that will
be preceded first by the larger autonomy of
the Dominion, then by its practical inde
pendence, and finally by its complete separa
tion from the mother country. Those steps
are all in preparation and visible in the not dis
tant future. We can afford to wait, or rather
we cannot afford to crowd the course of events
and the evolution of history. Canada is com
ing our way, and will as surely gravitate to
the United States as an apple, separated from
its stem, falls to the earth. And it may be
added tho apple always falls when it is pretty
ripe. "
A correspondent of the New York Post
insults the farmers of the country by account
ing for the strong protection vote in agricult
ural localities on the theory that the voters
there were purchasable. "A given amount
of 'soap " says this writer, "will accomplish
greater results if applied among, agri
culturists than if applied among men who
work for day wages, no matter how small."
The public in general considers farmers one
of the most intelligent and upright classes of
men in the community; buthowover this may
be, they are quite capable of resenting insults,
and the circulation of such slanders as this in
Democratic papers is not likely to soften their
hearts toward that party. When the Post
and its friends want the farmers' votes next
time, these things will be remembered.
Indianapolis has been inclined to plume
herself on the absence from its limits of the
murderous Anarchistic element; but the
atrocious and unprovoked crime of Anarchist
Hacker shows that this boast wa3 unfounded.
If it be true, as suspected, that the murderer

are in sympathy with him the authorities
have need to be on guard and rid the com
munity of the scoundrels beforo they have
obtained a foothold such as their brethren

It is now admitted that the exclusion of, the

The Democratic ta!k about the alleged use of

sounds very foolish when the fact stands out

success. It is very certain that no money was
used to increase the Republican majorities in
such States, and yet the increase is there, ia

demand are reasonable rates steadily main
tained. No one objects to paying the railroads
such rates as will enable them to make fair earn
ings upon tho values of their properties, and if
tha railroads themselves would only adhere to
such a policy it would be infinitely better for all
interests concerned. The latter course is, how
over, out of the question as long as it is possible
for roads constructed and operated for illegiti
mate purposes to cut rates far below the earn
ing point. Kansas City Journal.
It is probably to be regretted that the laws of
this country are so lax in respect to such organi
zations anarchistj, and ia respect to treason
sonable utterances and plans before actual
treasdn is committed. The absence of such
law allows these organizations to grow and
flourish and become powerful in numbers and
resources, awaiting the time when their leaders
shall see fit to use the power behind them in an
attempt to strike a deadly blow at the founda
tion of our government. Jostiee should usually
be tempered with mercy, but ia this case mercy
should be largely tempered with justice. Ne

The State Tress oa the Message.
Terre Haute Express: Inasmuch as the Presl-.
dent chooses to lecture Congress and find fault
generally with the expressed will of the people,
he cannot expect any sympathy in his downfall.
That part of the message treating of the
tariff exhibits merely the stubbornness of con
ceit. There is no wisdom in it; simply the
desperation of defeat. It can have no effect
either on legislation in Congress or on the pub
lic mind.
Lafayette Courier: The Bowery parrot is
just as lucid as Mr. Cleveland, es its well-known
argument is but a condensation of all that is
practical and to the point in the wilderness of
language the President employs in treating of
the subject ''Tariff is a tax." The original
policy propounded by Mr. Cleveland had a fair
hearing and a fair trial before the peopio of this
country and they repudiated it. It ia, therefore,
unseemly that he should pit his judgment
against that of a large majority of the people
who are quite as competent to correctly 'judge
the question as he 13 himself. Aside from this
subject and a perfunctory review of the opera
tions of the several departments, there is no
recommendation or opinion in the message of
special significance.
Evansville Journal: It is rather a melancholy
document as was naturally expected from a
man who has so recently been condemned by
the people. In reading it one would think that
the country is going to the "bow-wows," but
there is no danger since Harrison is elected.
A Mischievous Document.
Nw York Tribune.
The message is not as carefully written as
the President's other official papers, bat its
crude or awkward phrases count for nothing in
comparison with its mischievous tone. It would
not be out of place for the Senate sharply to
rebuke a chief magistrate who sets himself to
inflame blind prejudice and lawless passion
against employers generally, whatever their
personal worth or merit, and against the in
stitutions and laws which the people have
recently sustained by their verdict Mr. Cleve
land gained a reputation for courage and candor
when he cut through disguises and avowed free
trade theories. But ho does not gain in any
respect when he gives vent to personal soreness
and passion in his last annual message.
Cleveland Rnseticts and Demagogy.
Cincinnati Commercial Gazette.
He goes oat as a scold, and there is a baseness
cf demagogy in two or three scraps of bis
tedious and tiresome message that we have suc
ceeded in looking at fcr reading the thing is
impossible that we think has never been found
in a President's message before. Thtre has
been a good deal of twadale, and false theory,
and expansive vanity ia messages, but the
vicious and vulgar squealing of this document
are novel, and a degradation. This man has
pulled down the high tone of the character of
the American people. It is time he was gone.
Thank the Lord aud the old soldiers and their
sons, there are only three months more of him.

that he thereafter refer to Mr. Miller as "tne

When the speaker mentioned Mr. Millers namt
again he had to stop, for a etorra of applausi

A TRIBUTE TO HAKKISON.
llow Hon. Patrick Egan Views the Life and
Character of the Fresident-Klect.
j irtcu at llacguet, Linccln, Sel., Not. ri.
j toast of the evening is to the standard
bea. r in this glorious fight the President-elect,
Benjamin Harrison. General Harrison is the
peer, in ability, in courage and in patriotism, of
Lincoln or of Grant. Of him it can with truth
be said that in every relation, whether starting
out in life in his humble cottage with his young
wife, whether in the arduous duties of his pro
fession, whether on the red field of rarest
battling for his country's honor and his
country's safety, aud fighting to wipe
from tha glorious flag of freedom the
foul blot of human slavery, whether in
generous acts of Christian charity, works of
statesmanship or deeds of war, be ever proved
himself a brave, manly man, a gentleman, an en
lightened statesman and a truo soldier. The fol
lowing eulogiuro contained m the form of a reso
lution passed at the State Republican convection
of Indiana in May last, will tell better than any
words of mine how our Presi Itnt-elect stands
amenest his life-long friends in his own State:
"A Republican without equivocation, always in
the forefront of every contest, devoted to the
principles of the party with which he has been
identified since its organization, prominent and
jealous in all its campaigns, wie and trusted
in its councils, cervine with honorable dis
tinction ia the military and civil service of the
government, his great abilities, long and distin
guished public life, and the force cf his high
character and unblemished reputation combine
to make him one of the best-equipped and most
available men that could be chosen to lead the
party."
Oar President-elect comes of a family of
American patriots. For at least three genera
tions have the Harrisons done yeoman service
for the cause of American freedom.
Long before I ever dreamed that I should be
come a resident of this country I regarded the
title of American citizen as a thousand times a
prouder honor than the proudest dukedom cf
Europe, and often, while I lived in Paris, have
I felt pained at seeing people, calling them
selves Americans, by their toadyism after for
eign titles subjecting themselves and their
country to the sneers of the half-starved aris
tocracy of Europe. We want in this country to
instil into our young people a more thorough
appreciation of the dignity, as well as the glory,
of American citizenship and a still more intense
feeling of broad American patriotism not alone
the love of home and the pride of State or sec
tions, bat a patriotism that will regard as sacred
every foot of ground and every inch of a ship's
deck over which floats the fclonous stars and
stripes.
In our President elect every legitimate Ameri
can interest will find a atalwart champion and
very veteran who served bis country the true)
friendshio of comradrie. The interests of labor,
of acrlculture, of manufactures, of commerce
and of finance will be judiciously cared for and
tha general property of the country, on which
the prosperity of each individual depends, will
be secured. It has been wittily said that under
his administration Mills of Texas will be shut up,
but all the other mills of the country will be
running full time. Already we see the results
of our victory ia increased manufacturing ac
tivity and improved commercial confidence.
Some of the iroa manufacturers, in
stead of curtailing their trade, as
they would have been obliged to do ia
view of the possibility of the Mills bill be
coming law, have already begun to increase
their capacity, and in many caees they have in
creased the wages of their employes as much
as 10 per cent. Under President Harrison's
administration American honor will be guarded,
respect for American citizenship and American
rights will be enforced, and the spirit of Amer
ican patriotism and American nationality will
be stimulated, and toadyism un-American
toadyism whether at the court of St. James
or elsewhere, will be rebuked. In a word, I
feel that the pages of American history will
record no administration more successful or
more thoroughly American, and no figure more
noble than that of our President elect, Benjamin
Harrison.
Something: for Grady to Think About.
Washington Special.
There has been considerable talk among
Sonthern Democrats here of late that the elec
tion of General Harrison as President would
have a bad effect upon the South and its ad
vancement Mr. L. S. Brown, immigration
agent here for North Carolina. Virginia and Al
abama, thinks differently. Mr. Brnwn is a
Southerner and has always votfd the Demo
cratic ticket. He is in a good position to know
what he is talking about, and gives good rea
sons to sustain himself in his views, lis said
to-day: "Since the election of General Harri
son, not quite a month ago, I have received
five times as many letters from people of the
North and Northwest asking for information
about the South, its climate and resources and
the chances of business success offered there as
I have ever received before in the same length
of time. I do not say positively that the in
creased demand for information about tht
South, and the increased desire shown to go
there, is doe altogether to the election of Gen
eral Harrison, and the success of the protective
principle, but following immediately after, it
shows that the result bad something to do with
it. Business men feel now that protection is
settled and that thsy can invest their money
without fear of a change. The South needs im
migration and outside capital to develop her
great resources, and it looks to me as if she is
going to receive more of it in the next four tears
than ever before."
A Prophecy.
New Albany Tribune.
We do not claim to be a prophet, but we do
not mind putting on record here a bit of proph
ecy. And it is this: The next Legislature of
Indiana, Democratic in both branches, will in
troduce bills in respect to elections, and some of
them will be good ones. No valuable law will
ba passed on this subject. If any measure at
all passes, it will bs one that leaves as many
open doors for fraud ae the preseut law, aud
will be rigid in remedies to prevent the dis
covery of frauds. The history of Democracy in
Indiana warrants us in making this prophecy,
and we wait with patience to learn what sixty
days' legislation will bring forth.

One of the mysterious disappearances of the

of Mr. Dickinson no one seems to know, or care

ment from eyry State into the bands of a
Dickinson it va!d have smashed the solid
South.
