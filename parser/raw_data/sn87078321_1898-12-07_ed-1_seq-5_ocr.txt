ing in a shanty near tho C. & M. R'y
Junction. Campolo died In one hour
after ho was stabbed. Gambling and
whiskey were the cause of the murder.
The murdered man leaves a wife and
two children in Italy. It is not likely
that Moro will be apprehended as the
Clearfield county officials never go to
much troublo or expense to have mur-
dorers run down.
Dangers Practice.
It will be our sad duty some of these
days to chronicle a horrible railroad
accident if the boys insist on keeping
up the practice of jumping on moving
trains. This practice is Indulged in
more at this place on the R. St F. C. R'y
than It Is on the A. V. R'y. A boy liv
ing1 near the R. St F. C. R'y Main street
crossing, who is more daring than other
boys that participate In this dangerous
practice, will jump on a fast moving
train for tho last time some of these
days. Besides being a dangerous prac
tice, a boy Is liable to be arrested, as
the law forbids such practice.

this place for many years, is compelled
to retire from Hotel Belnap on account
of falling health. Mr. Dlllman, who 1b
an accommodating gentleman, has many

In our mail yesterday morning we re
ceived two magnanimous offers, such as
are usually made by patent medicine
companies and monthly magazines.
The medicine company actually offered
to pay the Immense sum of $1.00 for an
inch and a half advertisement for one
year, or for seventy-five inch space
The monthly muguzine, prloe $1.00 per
year, offered to send us the magazine
one year as payment for a three inch
advertlsemontstx months or one year,
Great guns ! think of it ! If we had an
internal maohine we would like to turn
it loose on some of the people who make
us propositions like the above. These
are only two of the many that we re
ceive. (Of course we accept them not,
High Cluss Entertainment.
The McDowell Recital Company, tin-
dor the auspices of the Village Improve
ment Association, will give an enter
tainment In Assembly hall on Tuesday
evening of next week, December 13th.
From the press notices the members of
this company have reoelved, we do. not
hesitate to say that the people of Reyn
oldsvllle will have the opportunity next
Tuesday evening to hear something ex
ceptionally fine. Below we give ono
press notice for each member of com
pany. Robert J. McDowell has a magnifi
cent voice, and was obliged to sing to a
hearty encore. The gentleman Is all
that has been claimed for him. Mo
Kecsport JVnrn,
Charles Boyd's rendition brought
forth well deserved applause and recalls.
Steubenvllle Gazelle.

a few up-to-date selections during the
evening.
The price of admission for this excel
lent entertainment has been put at 35
cents for reserved seats and 25 cents for
general admission. Tickets ou sale at
Stoke's drug store.
Water Fountain.
Tho water fountuin at the cornor of
Main and Fifth streets Is now quenching
the thirst of those who want a drink of
sparkling spring water. The water was
turned Into the fountain last Thursday.
It will not be appreciated as much dur
ing the winter weather as It will be In
the summer. It was expected that the
fountain and the expense of getting the
spring walled and water piped to foun
tain would amount to about $350.00, but
there were difficulties in the way that
were not counted on and, henco, the
entire expense will run over $400.00.
There ts considerable that was sub
scribed which has not been paid yet,
and still there is a shortage of almost
$100.00. It Is hoped that those who
have not given anything yet will con
tribute to pay for the fountain, which
will not only be a great blessing to the
public, but will also be a credit to Reyn
oldsvllle. There Is a large street lamp
on top of the fountain.
Police Call Bell.
On account of drunken and disorderly
individuals occasionally making them
selves obnoxious in and around the A.
V. R'y ticket office at this place, Gov
ernor Hastings, at the request of the
R'y Co., gave Joseph McKernan, A. V.
R'y baggage master, special police au
thority over a year ago, and Joseph has
Bince been looking after the obstreper
ous chaps. It generally happens when
there Is somebody around who needs
the police's attention it is when Mr.
Farrell Is busy selling tickets and can
not well leave his office to call the
police, therefore, the company has had
an electrlo bell put in from tho ticket
office to the baggage room and the
ticket agent can touch the button and
call the policeman without leaving the
ticket office.
His Scheme Worked.
Recently a Reynoldsvllle man en
tered his home and found his wife
gottlng ready to go some place.
To tho Interrogation, "Where are you
going?" she answered, "To the Aid
Society." "Have you fixed ray cloth
ing?" was the next question the hus
band asked. The answer was, "No, I
have not had time." The husband went
up stairs and soon returned with the
clothing over his arm that he hnd been
trying to got his wife to fix. Now it
was the wife's turn to ask questions and
she said, "Where are you going with
those old clothes?" The answer was,
"To the Aid Society to have them
fixed." It is hardly necessary to add
that the man got his clothing fixed
promptly without taking them to the
Aid Society.
Former Citizen Dead.
W. W. Crlssman died at his home In
DuBois Wednesday afternoon from
heart trouble. He was fifty-four taars
old. He moved from Reynoldsvllle to
Llndsey a number of years ago and last
spring moved from Llndsey to DuBols.
He was candidate for county treasurer
in 1890. Mr. Crlssman was a. Grand
Army man, a member of the Knights
of Pythias and Ancient Order United
Workmen. He carried $2,000 insurance
in the latter order. He had been a
faithful member of the Methodist Epis
copal church for years. He was a quiet
and unassuming gentleman who bad a
host of friends.

Silk Mill Notes.
Tho early winter we have this year
Is a certain sign of prosperity for all
silk manufacturers of the country, tor
an early winter causes a great deal of
business in winter goods, whereas a late
winter hardly empties the shelves of
the dry goods retailer. Everybody by
putting off buying winter goods helps to
make business poor, nnd somo winters
heavy frosts come so late that It is not
worth the trouble for the lady to buy
her silk lined cloak. So, brother weav
ers, an early winter, es an early spring,
are sure signs of prosperity for us. Af
ter having run full time this fall the
looms will be heard humming this com
ing spring, and the merry click cluck of
the shuttle will animate the wilderness
around the silk temple erected recently
In our town.
Few people know that It requires the
work of over 500 silk worms to supply
tho material for tho poorest class of
silk.
The pean lie mir. or silk skin now
woven at tho mill Is a heavy contexture
of cloth with a soft gloss, well adapted
for the manufacturing of capes. A
black cape with a lining of light color,
like lilac, is highly stylish.
The annure rwd(e Is another weave
whose surface appears covered up with
tiny dots of sparkling effect, and of a
very elegant aspect when worn either
as a waist or skirt. But the triumph of
the manufacturing this year will be the
long lift of numberless shades, brighter
tlnin for years.
Some girls will be pretty well satis-
fled with their pay this coming pay day.
True, they have worked hard, but now
the reward is at hand.
