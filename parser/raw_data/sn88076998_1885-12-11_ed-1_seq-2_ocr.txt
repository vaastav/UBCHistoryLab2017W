Elsewhere we give a correct synopsis
of tlie President's message. The entire
document is seldom carefully read by
the average reader. In fact, but few pe
ruse it carefully, in detail—hence the
abridgment. It is a document, fully in
at cud with the President's policy, as
manifested by his acts and if not dem
onstrating that he is a brilliant states
man, it certainly is creditable to him as
a good cit.'zen, rallitr than a politician
The illustrations were not issued with
the message, and are merely intended to
throw an artistic halo around the sub
ject,—and sort o' rest the eye. like.
Congress met last Monday. The po

Also one independent republican, and a
democratic green backer.
Senator John Sherman was elected
president of the senate, by a strict party
vote. Senator Isham Harris was the
•democratic candidate but failed for the
want of eight votes.

Kalakaua, king of the Sandwich is
lands, wants to sell out his kingdom to
Uncle Sam, and become an America
citizen. Last week his liminca minister
was in Washington, and had several long
interviews with President Cleveland and
the secretary of state, relative to the
matter. Hawaii is 2,1
(JO from San Fran
cisco. Uncle Sam's "yellow boys*' are
used mostly as currency and the ex
ports aggregate a value of Ss.000,000 an
nually, the iet' :oJuct^be Mg sugar
and rice. The United Slates for years
controlled all the Hawaiian trade, and
American merchants are located all over
the dominion.
Serious charges are made against the
land office at Washington by the Duluth
Herald. That paper says that parties
in the land office at Washington offered
for SHOO to send a patent, no matter
whether proofs were good or bad. They
finally reduced the amount to
§7.5. This
was sent as a test, and in thirty days
patents were received on claims where
the proof was of a doubtful character,
while patents are withheld in cases
where proof is perfectly good. Kc

It is estimated that from 2,000 to 8.J00
immigrants have crossed the boundary
from Manitoba and settled on the .Mouse
this season. Immigrants have also
arrived by way of Bismarck. Jamestown
and J)evi!s Lake in large numbers.
Although the census taken last June
lirst shows this country to have but
2.000 population, yet the actual number
of people now livingin tliecountry tribu
tary to the Mouse is from eight to ten
thousand.—Immigration Bulletin.
A Grand-Forks man, Mr. Henry De
laney, has demonstrated that frosted
wheat makes as good bread as though it
had not been touched by frost. The
Grand-Forks Herald says that Mr.De
laney exhibited samples of biscuits
baked irom dilferent kinds of Hour, one
being ol McCormack sbest and theother
of frosted wheat ground at thapxehange
..mill. There was no perceptible differ
ence between the biscuits, in color,
..lightness, and taste, and the Hour from
the frosted wheat was as nice as the best.
Farmers knowing this fact by experince
would be well not to sacrifice their
wheat even if it is frosted.—Lurimore

Washington special, Dec. 7: Much
apprehension has been manifested in the

commissioner says that the decision will
