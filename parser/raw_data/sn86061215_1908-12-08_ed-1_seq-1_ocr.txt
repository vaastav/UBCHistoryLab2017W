Read Message.
Tomorrow will be given up by both
houses to the reading of the presi
dent's message. As this is the last.
annual message which the president
will send to congress there is unusual
1 interest in it. It is expected that, the
'use will begin business Wednesday
"iicrning with the consideration of the
.bill providing the means for the tak
ing of the thirteenth census.
If Republican leaders in the senate
and house retain their present views
the legislation in this session of con
gress will include very little ex
cept appropriation bills. Those bills
will carry in the aggregate about $1,
000,000,000 and the general opinion is
that in the time that will be allowed
the two houses will find they can best
serve the country by giving proper at
tention to these appropriations. As a
matter of fact, while the session will
last for almost thrae months the actual
fitting will cover only a little more
than two months.

cured the adoption of a resolution
authorizing the committee on ways
and means in their inquiry for the pur
pose of preparing a bill to revise the
present tariff laws, to subpoena and
fe examine witnesses under oath and to
js?, send for the necessary records, papers
and other evidence. After the dispo
sltion of some routine business resolu
tions were adopted expressive of the

tomorrow.

PAPERS WHO ACCUSED HIS
BROTHER-IN-LAW
Washington, D. C.. Dec. 7.—
The Democrats of the house are
planning to demand an investiga
tion of the purchase of the Panama
canal property and in conformity
with this program, Reprsentative
Rainey of Illinois today introduced
a resolution directing the speaker
to appoint a committee "to ascer
tain how much of $40,000,000 which
appears of record to have been
paid to the French company was
really paid to that company, "it is
said the national Democratic com
mittee requested Rainey to present
the resolution.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—Infam
ous falsifiers, suppressor* of truth.
anJ purveyors of maliciously manu
factured news are a few of the un
complimentary epithets used by Pres
ident Roosevelt in a statement issued
last night denying charges of graft in
connection with the $40,000,000 pur
chase of the Panama canal rights, etc.,
from the French republic.
His statement was brought bv a
letter of inquiry from William Dudley
Foulko of Richmond, Ind.. as to what
answer the President might have to
frequent charges made in the Indian
apolis News, of which Delavan Smith
is editor.
Mr. Smith is made the target for the
fiercest denunciation that has come
from the White House in many
months.
8cathing Fire From President.
After chastising Editor Smith the
President turns on Editor L^ffan of
the New York Sun in connection with
charges made that paper.
The President denies that there was
anything but a straight business deal
in the payment of the S40.000.000 to
France. He avers that the money was
paid to the French government direct,
and that- no American received a cent.
He asserts that the attempt to con
nect his brother-in-law. Douglas Rob
inson, with the deai is as infamous
as it is untrue—that Mr. Robinson
never had anything to do with the
purchase or the canal project In anv
capacity.
William Du.liev c'ouike. who ad
dresseu the letter to the President- is

IN
MYSTERIOUS MANNER
NA TRACE OF THIEF.
Sheldon, Dec. 7—When the First
National bank of Sheldon at. the close
of busiuess Saturday counted up its
cash it found that it was, in some un
accountable way, about $2,500 short.
is supposed that a sneak thief man
aged to get hold of the money, unob
sered, though at no time during the
day was there less than two men be
hind the counter and for the greater
part of the time there were no less
than five.
It is surmised that the person who
did it was an expert at: the business
and played it smoothly.
The First National is one of the
strongest banks in all northwestern
Iowa and handles a great deal of
money during any business dayt and
its officers and especially the cashier
and assistant cashier, have prided
themselves on the great care they
have exercised in handling cash at ail
limes during banking hours. The
loss of the money itself is a very
small matter to so strong a bank as
this but the part hardest, for the
bank people to stand is that the
money was taken right from under
their eyes.

Washington, D. C.. Dec. 7.
Senator Cummins may find early oc
casion to take part in the deliberations
of the senate. The postal savings
bank bill is a special order for the
senate on December 14 and will
pressed to vote. Cummins is not
friendly to the measure and it is under
stood he may go to the extent of op
posing it unless it can be amended
to conform to his ideas.
Wants Money Left at Home,
To this end he has in mind to off-jr
some amendments and urge them. He
l'eels that there ia small occasion "o
offer, attempting to do anything for
the banking facilities of the rural
communities when at the present they
are well supplied and the local banks
keep the money at home for home
users.
While the establishment of tire pos
tal banks, he suspects, would tend to
take money away to the larger cen
ters. he is anxious that the bill if it
shall pasB be amended to safeguard,
•v-bsotfiuMy siich possibility.
Greetpd by Colleagues.
Senator Cummins appeared in the
chamber a few moments before the
senate was called to order. He took
the seat assigned to him on the Demo
cratic side. Immediately around him
was a bodyguard of insurgent Republi
cans including Borah, Brown, Burkett,
Nixon, LaFollette and Bourne. They
were very cordial in their greeting.
After adjournment the Republicans be
gan to wander over from their side
and most of them were introduced to
Cummins by Senator Dixon of Nevad.i.
Senator Dolliver presently came
over with Senator Burrows, introduced
him and chatted awhile. The session
lasted only thirty minutes and the
lowans were the center of interest,
Mr. Dolliver presenting the resolution
of sorrow for the death of Allison and
securing an adjournment out of re
spect for him.
