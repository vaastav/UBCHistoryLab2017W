Thousand.
TT OLLOWING is the message or
! President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate and
bouse at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress Since I
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
. of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
international affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes, that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares that
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has inspired s us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own hands. Dut we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her in her distress and under
take to impose upou her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in the great
days in which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine is. "That government Is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the people,-
nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of
government, that is the best which Is
capable of producing the greatest de
fgree of happiuess and safety and Is
snost effectually secured against the
'danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
V inadequate or contrary to these pur
tposes a majority of the community
i hath an indubitable, Inalienable and
indefeasible" right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable With-,
in the. Next Generation.
" The moral is that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community . of . interest,
alike in matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and in the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep and true sense a unit'
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents pf
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries: united In spirit and pur
pose, they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in it. It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service.
The president calls attention to the
meeting in Washington recently of
representatives of the pan-American
republics and says that economic ad
justment is inevitable in the next gen
eration. No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fail to per--ceive
that their passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace., Great democ
racies are not belligeren t They do toot

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST
PICTURE.
(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.)
of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen, lines of nr.lional development.
We do more than that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusi.:.s::i for individual liberty and
free national development to the inci
dents ai:.l movements of affairs which
affect ou!y ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed it as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple agamst aggressionj And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as In times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and immediately effective. .And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their independence secure, and not
their own independence merely, but
tne rights alsp of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put in jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you, and which I urge you to sanction
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient.
They contemplate an increase of the
standing force, of the regular army
from its present strength of 5.023 offi
cers and 102.985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7.136 officers
and 134.707 enlisted men. or 141.843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a . great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen, force of
which I shall presently speak. 792 non
commissioned officers .for service in
drill, recruiting and the like-and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the -ordnance department and
other similar .auxiliary jservices. These
Declares That if Full Navy Pro
gram Is Carried' Out We Will
Have a Fleet For Defense That
Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs
and Worthy of Our'Traditions."
Greatest Danger to Country
Comes v From Within Our Bor
ders. are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also in the Philippines,
in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth
mus and in Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should "occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing, the army
by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in Increments of 133, 000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This it is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable metl of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purpose of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutermeut3 as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. The would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed . two months in
the year.
Tho president says it is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE FLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, but it does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held in the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy, upon a final footing pf strength!
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense; we have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship; the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines; the. fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarineone ammuni
tion ship and ue. fuel, oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tie cruiser, two scout" cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarine, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunbont. one am
munition ship and one. repair ship.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7.50O sailors
2,500 apprentice seamen and l.n00 ma
rines. This Increase would be suH
cient to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
the ships which will be . completed
early in 191 R. It is also ljscessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by nt least. 300 In order that
the for e nf ofiu-ers should be more

would be a navy fitted to . our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and Instruments of war
are - only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self suffirieu-
fy and security in all its aspects.
There , are other great matters which
will , be -thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not- There is. for
example, a very pressing question bf
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem , of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag into every sea,
and who were the pride and often, the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by inexcusable
neglecb and indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It is
high time we repaired our mistake ami
resumed our commercial independence
on the seas.
With a view to meeting these press
Ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the earliest possi
ble moment of the present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Ameri
cas together in bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity which
may : never return again if we miss it
now, proposals wjll be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned and
directed by the government similar to
those made to the last congress, but
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need was
then foreseen. It is now acutely felt
and everywhere realized by those for
whom trade is waiting, but who can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much interested in the par
ticulars of the program as I am in
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
we will but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as In all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POUCY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommends Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Justice.
The president recommends the early
adoptftm of bills for. the aIt"ration.aud
reform of the government or the Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
leal justice to the people of Porto Ilico.
which were submitted to the Sixty
third congress. The president refers
to the increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of the
nation and tells of the fiscal problems
confronting the government.
On the 30th of June last there was
an available balance in the general'
fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78
The total estimated receipts for the
year 1910. on the assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond Its present ' limit, the 31st of
-December, 1915. and that the present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the 1st of May.
191G. will be $670.3G5.500. The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774,535,605.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including twenty-fly millions for
the Panama canal, .twelve millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will be $753,891,000, and the bal
ance in the general fund of the treas
ury will be reduced to $20,C44.605.7&
The emergency revenue act if contin
ued beyond Its present time limitation
would produce during the half year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugar if continued would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the 1st of May
about fifteen millions. These two sums,
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, if added to the revenues of the
second half of the fiscal year would
yield the treasury at the end of the
year an available balance of $70,644.
605.78. . -
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have
spoken would, as at present estimated.
be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000
Those figures, taken with the figures
for the present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the taxes Imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontin
ued. and that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,605:78. that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about $25,000,000 and that? the addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by the congress,
.the deficit In the general fund of. the
treasury on the 80th of June, 1917.
wfll be nearly $235,0CO.00a, To this
smn tt least $50,000,000 should be add
ed to represent a safe working balance
for th treasury and $12,000,000 to to-
elude the usual-. JeJjciency estimates in vtatojeonspiracies-against the
1917. and these additions would make" of the government, thev hnneDtrality!

throughout ,4 his year . and the next,
however.' there wpuld be a balance in
the treasury Mfs some $70,500,000 at
J the end of the present fiscal year and
a deficit ntjrtbe end of the next year of
only some $50,000,000. or, reckoning in
$62,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury., balance at
the end of the yearj a total deficit of
some $112,000,000. The obvious moral
of the. figures is' that it is a;pla in coun
sel of 'prudence to continue all of the.
present tr.es or their equivalents and
, ronfiue ourselves, , to the problem of
providing. $112,000.000. of new revenue
rather than $297,000,000. " -'
How shall we obtain the ' new rev
enue ? We are frequently reminded
that there are many millions of bonds
which the treasury is authorized under
existing law to sell to rcibursa the
sums paid out of current revenues for
the construction of the Panama canal,
and it is true ; that bonds for the
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138,000,000 of. these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures, at -the isthmus, and now con
stitute, a considerable item of the pub
lic debt But I for one do not believe
that the people of this country approve
of postponing the payment - of their
bills. Borrowing money is shortsight
ed finance. It can be justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except in the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to. be done. In the interest of
posterity as well as in our own. It
seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled,
to know just.wliat burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset now. The new bills should be
paid by internal taxation. ,
NATION'S SECRET FOES
SHOULD BE CRUSHED.
Gravest Danger to Country Comes
From Within Our Own Borders.
The president says that the precise
reckonings of the problem to be met
are set forth in the, report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation-to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the impar
tial role in this hemisphere and in the
world; which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to it. I
have had in my mind no thought of
any Immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all the
nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach ov amicab'e relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the gravest
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of the
United' States, I blush to admit, born
under other flags, but welcomed under
our generous, naturalization laws to the
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica, who have poured the poison of dis
loyalty into the very arteries of our
national-life, who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our
government 'into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective .for , their vindictive, pur
poses to- strike at them and to "debase
bur politics to the , uses of foreign, in
trigue; Their n u m ber is not great as
compared with the whole number of
those- sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched in recent gen
erations out of. virile foreign stocks,
but it is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to have
made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America 'never witnessed anything
like this before. It never dreamed it
possible that men sworn into its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great
free stocks, such as supplied some of.
the best and strongest elements of that
little, but how heroic, natloa that in a
high' day of old staked its- very life to
free Itself from every entanglement
that had darkened the- fortunes of the
older nations and set up a new stand
ard here that men of such origins and
such free choices of allegiance would
ever turn in malign reaction against
the government and people who had
welcomed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle while ago sueh a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because it was in-,
credible we made no . preparation , for
it. . We would have been . almost
ashamed to prepare for it. as if we
were, suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the ugly
and incredible thing has actually come
about, and ' we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with it. I urge
you to enact such laws at the earliest
possible moment and feel that In doing
so I am urging you to do nothing less
than save the honor "and self respect
of the nation. Such creatures of pas
sion, disloyalty and anarchy must be
crushed out They are. not many, but
they are Infinitely malignant and, the
band of our power should close over
them at once. They have formed plots

industries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for
mobilization. It is the more impera
tively . necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for do
ing what we have not yeAoue-tliat
we should give intelligent federal aid
and stimulation to industrial and voca
tional education, as we have long done
in the large field . of our agricultural
industry; that at the sam; time that
we safeguard and conserve the natural
resources of the country we should
put them at the disposal of those who
will use "them promptly and intelli
gently, as was sought to be done ia
the admirable bills submitted to the
last congress from its committees ou
the public lands, bills which 1 earnest
ly recommend in principle to your con
sideration: that we should put imo
early opera'tioii some provision for
rural credits which will add to the ex
tensive borrowing facilities already
afforded the farmer by the reserve
bank act adequate instrumentalities
by which long credits may be obtained
on land mortgages and that we should
study more carefully than they have
hitherto been studied the right adapta
tion of our economic arrangements to
changing conditions.
Many conditions about which we
have repeatedly legislated are being
altered from decade to decade, it is
evident under our very eyes and are
likely to change even more rapidly
and more radically in the days imme
diately ahead of us .when peace has
returned to the world and the nations
of Europe once more take up their,
tasks of ' commerce and industry with
the energy of those who must bestir
themselves to build anew.
REGULATIONS TO MEET
RAILROAD PROBLEM.
Needed to Make Lines More Useful'
Servants of Country.
In the meantime may I make this
suggestion? The transportation prob
lem is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one in this country. There
has from time to time of late been rea
son to fear that our railroads would
not much, longer be able to cope-with,
it successVnlly. as at present equipped
and co-ordinated. I suggest that it
would be wise to provide for a. com
mission of inquiry to ascertain by a.
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be in the solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously
a problem that lies at the very foun
dation of our. efficiency as a people.
Such an 'inquiry ought to draw out
every circumstance and opinion wortn
considering, and we need, to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to
.do anything in the field of federal leg
islation. .
No one. 1 am sure, would wish ta
