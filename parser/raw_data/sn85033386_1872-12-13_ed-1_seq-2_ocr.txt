Feesideht Gbant,
Colfax. Chief Justice Chase, Sec
retary Fish, and other prominent of
ficials, attended the funeral of Hob
ace Geeelet last week. The ser
vices wero conducted by . Hexht
Wakd Beeches and Dr. B. IL Cha
vis. The great city was in mourn
ing. This is not the first time Gen.
Chant has shown a graceful feeling
to a fallen foe. When Gen. Lex
surrendered, Gen. Gbaht's magna
nimity was greater than could have
been expected from one of his heavy,
selfish nature. It is possible that he
would be generous to the whole
South, if he did not know that he
could not then be the leader of his
party. HJs splfishnees is therefore
greater than his generosity and pa
triotism. It should always be especially
gratifying to us, to mention the good
actions of those whose deeds in the
past we have been accustomed to
look upon as evil. Chables Slm
kek, whose fame was achieved as an
opponent of slavery, and by being
caned by a slaveholder, during the
lite Presidential canvass caused one
of the key-notes of the campaign to
be, "Reconciliation." Unlike a few
worshipers of success, he docs not
"no back" on bis former good words
and works, but advances in his states
manlike efforts to bring about an era
of feeling between the North and
South. He has introduced the fol
lowing bill in Congress, which evi
dently has for its object the noble
results of reconciliation :
Whereas, National unity and good
v411 among follow-citizens can be ensur
ed only through oblivion ol past differ
ences, and it is contrary to tho usage o
civilized nations to perpetuate the mem
ory of civil wan thorororo,
it enacted, etc., that the tiauies ol
battles with fellow-citizens shall not be
continued u the army register or plawd
on regimental colors ot the United
States.
I'CESibKai Gbaxt, in his recent
mc66ago to Congress, recommends
au extensive system of internal im
provements by the federal govern
ment, and particulaily by canals of
great length and cost, with a ylew to
promoto commerce between tic
West and Atlantic seaboard. He
recommends aid to tho James ltivci
and Kanawha Canal. Gov. Walkeb
in his annual message to the Legisla
ture of Virginia, opposes this policj ,
oj the gvouud that the general gov
ernment has no right to undertake
such a work. The Xcw York pa
pers arc also opposed to this feature
of the President's message. Their
opposition, however, is not based
upon any warm feeling for tho doc
trine of State rights, or fear of the
danger of centralization, but because
budi improvements would have a
tendency to turn, the channels o

The following remarks, contained
in a recent private letter of Col. J. J.
Tcisnei:, of Gallatin, to Maj. W. J.
ykes, arc worthy of being cugraved
ou the minds of all Southern men.
Col. Tlicxeb in known as one ol
Tennessee's noblest and most gallant
sons, and his words of advice are
worth the attention of all our people
He says ;
"Our only loio in the future is to go
to work and build up our waste placus,
and fully develop our glorious resour
ces. It this is done, wo can become in a
lew years rich, jotrcrfl and indcpt.n

' A iianuuet was given at Nashville

chairman of the ltadical State Exec
utive Committee, for his efficient
services in the lale canvass in Ten

leading Radicals made very gushing

to be jubilant The health of Git ant

was cordially responded to by all
present, Including tho editor and the
proprietor of the Banner. Thus, it
beems, tho Banner has got into conge

The Value r CelamMa Ball-
Some persons are making the ob
ectlon, that the $50,000 of bonds to
be issued by Columbia, will not sell
for more than sixty cents in the din
ar. If this were so, it would be the !
logsof the company, and not of the
corporation of Columbia, since the
citizens of Columbia will jceive
stock to the full amount of the bonds.
The company cannot use the bonds
at these rates, because they are re
quired to obtain a sufficient amount
of stock to grade, cross-tie and bridge
from Lewisburg to Centre ville, be
fore they can get the bonds, and this
they canntt do if these bonds should
only be worth sixty cents in the dol
lar ; and in that ' event the bonds
would not be called for, because they
could not be used, unless these bonds
can be negotiated at par, or nearly
par, they will not be called for.
There is no danger on this point.
The whole amount of the bonds can
be negotiated in Colnmbla and Mau
ry county at good ralra. It is the
best Investment for men who wish to
buy bonds or lend money. Norfolk
bonds, we are informed, sell at 87j?
cents, and Columbia bonds should be
worth more than Norfolk bonds, be
cause Columbia will owe less in pro
portion to her wealth than Norfolk.
Missouri Sixes sell at 03!g, because
the interest Is promptly paid. Co
lumbia Eights ought to sell at par,
because the interest will also be
promptly paid, and this is what
makes bonds valuable.
There is no danger of a deprecia
lion of these bonds; and if they
should depreciate to any extent, the
.corporation of Colombia or th
h could take them up, at
the eiti-
these
depreciated rates. But there is no
prospect of this. Capita can find
no safer Investment than these bonds,
and if the corporation did not have
the right to redeem them at any
time, they could not do so, because
they will be in demand. So much
for that objection.
Gen. Iba P. Jowes' address to the
Tennessee Press Association a few
days ago, is an unbroken chain of
common sense, all the way through
He is the business man of the Nash
ville Union and American, and
knows what he is talking about. He
starts" out with the proposition that
the the newspaper business is a bnsl
ness enterprise, and that it requires
money to carry it on. His detailed
account of the frauds perpetrated
upon the press is peculiarly strik
ing. We hope his speech will do
much toward informing the public
that newspapers are not public instl
tutions but private property, and not
at the disposal of politicians, specn
lators, adventurers, and stockhold
ers. He touched upon the dignity
and powers of the press with mas
terly ability. Nothing is truer than
his statements in regard to the fre
quent failures in tho business. He
said that there were one thousand
failures in 1871, and would be as
niaiiy more the present year. This
Is the reason : faWc do too much
work 'without compensation. We
pay out too much for work without
compensation whatever. We estab
lish an eleemosynary institution at
our own expense. We keep a char!
ty school on our own hook. We
conduct business as if we owe eve
rything to the public, and the public
arc not indebted to us a farthing.
The next reason is, that every man
who has literary attainments and can
write, and has three thousand dol-
lira, wants to start a paper some
where, for fame and for fortune. It
takes business men, not writers, to
make papers Bucceed. "I ' declare
that howsoever great an ass the edi
tor may make of himself, the busi
ness will go smoothly on if It is man
aged sensibly. Of course, if the edi
tor conducts the business and makes
a fool of himself, the concern starts
to a funeral at once. On the other
hand, if you have a very paragon cd
Itor, and the business goes loose, it is
appoplcxy instant death."

These two Stales arc now enjoying
all the chaos that a Radical adminis
tration brings. The difficulty in Al
abama isf that the Democrats have a
majority of nine, in the Legislature,
on joint ballot, which secures the
election of a Democratic United
States Senator. The liadical minor
ity have seceded from the Legisla
ture, and are holding forth in the
Court House. They have already
returned Senator Spexceb to the
United States Senate. The Demo
cratic majority are doing business in
the capitol, and declare that they are
the only L3gislature in the State, an u
threaten to impeach those State offi
cials who are siding with the sece-
ders. mere are eight contested
seats, and as the Legislature itself
determines the matter, the Radicals
say they know that they will decide
In favor of the Democrats ; and hence
they feel justified In revolting. They
only suppose that the Democrats
would decide against them they do
not know it. But this is the ouly
remedy that the law provides, and
the country would come to- a pretty
pass, if people should refuso to go
into court because they were not cer
tain of a favorable verdict. . The
Radicals are manifestly in the wrong.
Iu Louisiana, it is a family fuss.
Two branches of the Republican par
ty are fighting each other. Governor
Wabmotu is heading one faction, and
Pikchback, a negro, the other. The
former leads the Tusionists," and
would be Senator if they had a ma
jority ; and Casey, brother-in-law of
the President, would be Senator, if
the Radicals had a majority. The
Radical branch of the Legislature is
sitting in one place, and has adopted
articles of impeachment against
Wabmotu. The "Fuslonists" are
holding forth In another place.
Pinchback, by the aid of 6ol diary,
succcedci in getting possession of
the Governor's apartment, but Wab
motu has sued out a writ of injunc
tion, preventing him from exercising
the functious of the office.
C W. Blood worth, sentenced to
ten years' imprisonment from Rob
ertson county, for aiding and abetting
an illegal marriage, was brought to
Nashville Friday, and placed in jail
to await trial before the Supreme
Court to which he appealed his case.
It is said that he and two others im
posed upon a simple girl by pretend
ing to marry her to one of their num
ber, the second acting as a minister
in pronouncing the ceremony, while
tho third witnessed it One of the
parties subsequently left for parts un
